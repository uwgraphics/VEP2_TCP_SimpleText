The preface of sir Johan Bourchier knight lord Berners.
Sithe history (as I have in my Preface upon the first volume of this
chronicles declared) is the witness of times / the light of truth / the life
of remembrance / the maistres of the life / ye messanger of old season /
whereof innumerable co^modyties grown. I ne think the labors myspente / that
I at the high commandment of our most redoughted soueraygne lord Henry the
cyght / king of England and of France / high defender of the Christen
faith. etc. have e^ployed about the translacyon of now the four volumes of
sir Johan Froissa^t / out of French in to our English tongue. Certainly not
the bou^tie of the same chronicles / in whom are conteyg^^d the wars of these
parties: which wars (d^sc^yued in French by sir Johan Froyssa^^ right
o^nately) as many that have great understanding in diverse tongues / in whom
wars are written / plainly say: for knyghtly feate^ / manhood / and humanyte
/ pass right much the wars of far countries: nor the great pleasure that
thy noble country men of England took in redynge ye worthy and knightly
deeds of their valiant ancestors / encorageth me half so much / as the
princely exhort / which of all erthely kings the very worship and (...) /
ou^ foresaid gracyous soueraygne gave me. He / who forth manyfolde royal
virtues in his highness found / not of two or three small realms / (...) is
worthy to reygne and be king over the universal world / ^elyteth in nothing
(...) / than to (...) I said / the most famous (...) of his (...) and subict
(...) ou^ with all (...) So that it ^ought appear to every man's ^ight / over
what and how worthy people has (...) / and now his (...) lyaunt (...) /
contend by vigorous virtue and manhood to follow / yea to pass them if they
may. Truly / the images as they used in old time to erecte in worship and
remembrance of them that were descended of noble blood / he bear half the
witness / that the noble deeds set out in hystorye done. Which well
appears by the words of the prudent king Agesilaus / who dying commanded /
that neither image nor picture to his resemblau^ce should be made / for if I
have said he / any noble thing famously done / it shall bear witness enough
of me: if I have naught done / certainly all the images little aueylen / as who
says / such things inought be made in mind of them that were but dastardes
/ and never did worthy deed in all their life. Wherefore / for the love and
honor that I bear to our most puissaunt soueraygne / and to do pleasure to
his subie^tes / both nobles and commons: I have endeavored me to translate out
of French (as said is) in to English / the four volumes of sir Johan
Froissart / and reduced them in to twain. Wherein if I have erred / I pray
them that shall defaute find / to consider the greatness of the history and
my good will that ask nothing else of them for my great labor / but of their
curtesy to amend where need shall be / and yet for their so doing / I shall
pray to god finally to send them the bliss of heaven. Amen.

How sir John^ Bourchier governor of Gaunt during the truse / had new
vitayled the town of Gaunt / And how a manner of people called comporsels did
much hurt in the country. Capitulo Primo.
SIr John^ Bourchier who had ye gouernyng of Gau^t under king Richard of
England / and the capiteyns of the co^montie of the town / as Peter de Boys
/ fra^ces Atreman / and Peterle Myttre. They provided surely for the war /
and during the truse / they had greatly vitayled and refresshed the town with
all provision parteyning to the war: and also the castle of Gauure / and
other places under their rule.

In the same season there was a company of rutters gadered together in the wode
of Respayle / and there they had fortifyed a house / so that it could not
lightly be won. They were people chased out of Alos / of Grantmount / and out
of other places in Flanders / and had lost all that ever they had and wist not
how to live / but by robbyng and pillyng / wheresoever they could get it: so
that there was as than no speaking but of these pigs of Respayle. This wood
is between Reguays and Grauntmount / Anghien and Lysen: they did much hurt in
the lordship of Athe / and in the land of Floberge and of Lyssues / and in the
land of Danghien. and these pyllers were borne out by them of Gaunt / for
under the color of them they did much hurt as in robbynge and sleynge. They
would go in to Heynalte and take men and women in their beds / and lead them
to their forteresse and ransom the^ at their pleasure: they made war to
every man. The captain of Athe / who was called Baudrius dela Mocte / laid
often times awayte for them / but he could never trappe them / they knew so
many shyftes. They were so feared in the fro^ters of Heynalte and Brabant /
that none durst go that way in to the country.

THe duke of Burgoyne on the other part / for the war^ that he looked for / he
garnysshed and provided for all his towns in Fla^ders. There was captain of
Bruges the lord of Guystelles / and of Courtrey sir Johan Ieumount / and sir
Willyam of Namure. As than sir Willm^ of Guystels was lord of Dan / and of
Courtray sir Johan Ieumount and sir Peter of Neyper. In likewise in all the
towns on the fronter of France / there were men of war set by the duke of
Burgoyne. In the town of Ardenbourcke / there was in garyson sir Guy of
Pontaillyer marshall of Burgoyn / sir Ryflarte of Flaunders / sir Johan of
Ieumont / sir Henry of Coynge / the lord of Montigny in Ostrenant / the lord
of Longueuall / sir Johan Barnet / sir Peter Baylleull / Philpot Gany / Raoleyn
dela Foley / and diverse other. These men of arms were two hundred / and so
they took advise toguyder / and were in will to ride in to the four crafts
and distroy that country / for much vitayle came fro thens in to Gau^^. And so
on a day they departed and took that way / and the same day that the french
men were rydden forth / there was rydden forth out of Gaunt a two thousand
men mete for the war / and Frau^ces Arreman was their captain / And so
suddenly they met with the frenchmen in a village: and when each of them
knew other they saw well they should have battle. Than the frenchmen
valiantly set foot to the earth and approached their enemies / and the
gauntoyse in likewise set on them. There they began to shole and to fight
each with other: they were on such a place that the gauntoyse could not pass
at their aduau^tage. there was a sore battle and many feats of arms done on
both parts / and diverse cast to the ground. Sir Riflart of Flaunders was
the^ a good knight / and did valiantly. The knights and squyers fought
valiantly with the gau^toyse / and so it behooved them to do / for there was no
ransom. But finally the gauntoyse were of such nombre that they obtained the
place / and the frenchmen were constrained to lepe on their horses or else they
had been all lost / for the gauntoyse surmounted them. And there was slain sir
John^ Varlet / sir Peter of Bailleule Bell Forrier / Philyppe of Gancy / Raolen
dela Foley / and diverse other which was great damage. And the other were feign
to fly and to enter in to Ardc^bourcke / or else they had been deed without
recovery. And after this adventure the vycount of Meaulx was sent in garyson
to Ardenbourcke / with a certain nombre of men of arms / and they newly
repaired the town: and he had with him a hundred soeares of good men of arms.
And as than sir Johan of Ieumont was great baylye of Flaunders / and so he had been two year before. He was greatly douted in all the country of Flaunders
because of his valyantnesse / And when he might get any of the gauntoyse /
there went no ransom for them: For he outher put them to death / or else
cut of their hands and fete or put out their eyes and send them home /
to give ensample to the other gauntoyse. He was so renoumed in Flaunders to do
justice without pytie / in correctyng the gauntoyse / that there was no spekyng
in all Flaunders but of him.

THus in every Realm the world was in trouble / as well bitwene France and
England as Castle and Portyngale for the^ the war was newly renewed. and
the lady of Auiowe / who wrote her self queen af Naples and of Jerusalem /
was come to Iuygnon to the pope / and there kept her house and her son Loyes
with her / who was called king of Cecyle / the which his father had
conquered. The queen's entencyon was to make war in Prouence / without they of
that country would take her for their lady / and become under her obeysau^ce.
And sir Bernarde de la Salle was entered in to Pronence / and made war there
in her quarrel. The same season ye lord of Coucy was also at Auygnon / and had
layen a.xv. wekes in his bed / of a hurt that he had on his leg with
rennyng of a horse. And when he was hole / than he oftentimes did vyset the
queen and reco^forted her / the which he could do rightwell. The queen tarried
therefore to abide for the duke of Berrey / who was also coming to Auignon to
speak with the pope / and to aid his suster the queen. The french king and
his uncles had sent in to Prouence / sir Loyes of Sanxere marshall of
France with five hundred men of arms to war in that country / without they
would come to obeysaunce under the queen. Some submytted themself but not all
/ how be it the city of Marcell / and the grettest part of the country
yielded them to the queen / but the city of Ayes in Prouence / and Tarraston /
and diverse knights of the country would not yield them to the queen / saying:
how she had no right to demand the county of Prouence / till she were
peasably received for lady / and her son as king of Pulle and Calabre in
Naples and Cecile. and when she has possession of these / than Proue^ce shall
obey her / as reason requires. In those matchesse there made war for the
earl / Sir Charles dela Pa^^e / the earl Conuersaunt / and sir Johan of
Luzenbourge his son. And with me queen at Auignon as chief of her counsel
was sir Johan of Baylleule.

IN the same season there fell in Lombardye a marvelous insydence / which was
much spoken of / through out all the world. and that was of the Earl of
Vertus / called sir Galeas / and of his brother sir Barnabo / the grettest in
all Lombardy. They had raygned long and governed all Lo^bardy like two
brethren. The one of them ruled nine cities and the otehr ten. and the cite
of Millayne was governed one yet by the one and the other year by the other. When
sir Galeas dyed / he left behind him a son / who was than earl of Vertus /
and named like his father sir Galeas / but than swaged the love bitwene him and
sir Barnabo his uncle / for than sir Galeas doughted him of sir Barnabo his /
uncle leest that he would take away his lands fro him / like as he did fro
his father. For his uncle of old time took away the land fro their brother
sir Mauffe / and caused him to dye. So thus therle of Vertus douted him greatly
of his uncle. how be it he wrought subtelly to bring him self insuretie / I
shall show you how. Sir Barnabo had in usage / that all such lands as he
had rule of / he raunsomed the^ so grievously and would tax the men two or three
times in a year / to pay the half or third part of their goods / and none
durst say against him for fear. And sir Galeas earl of Vertus did otherwise
/ for the intent to get love he took none aid of his men / but lived all
only by his revenues / And that rule he kept a five year after the death of
his father / so that he had the love of all Lombardy / and every man said /
they would be glad to live under him. And every man spoke yuell of ser
Barnabo privily as they durst / because he took so excessyuely of them. So
finally the Earl of Vertus thought to execute his intent / as he that doughted
greatly his uncle / and as it was said / he saw some lykelyhode. On a day he
sent secretly for such as he trusted best / And to some he showed his intent
/ but not to all / for fear that his purpose should be known.

And so it fortuned / that sir Barnabo on a day rode forth fro one Castle to
another to sport him. The earl of Vertus his nephewe knew thereof and laid
for him three busshemeutes / to the intent that his uncle should not escape / for
he must needs at least pass by one of them. The earl commanded to take him
but not to slay him / without he made great defense. So as sir Barnabo roode
forth and thought none yuell / nor was in no fear of his nephewe / So he fell
in the danger of one of the busshmentes / the which opyned and approached him
with their speres couched in the rest. sir Barnabo had with him a squire of
Almaygne / who came to him and said. Sir / save your self / for yonder company
makes but yuell countenance against you / they are parteyning to your
nephewe sir Galeas / Sir Barnabo answered / I know not how to save my self
/ if they owe me any yuell will / But I have done no trespass to my nephue /
whereby that I ought to fly away. so always they of the busshement drew
nerer and nerer straight upon him. There was a knight of Almaygne with sir
Barnabo / and when he saw this company approach toward his master: He had
sir Barnabos sword in his hand and drew it out of the sheth / and took it
his master and said. Sir / defend your self / and than the knight drew out
his own sword like a valyant man to stand at his defense / how be it all
aueyled him no thing / For inco^tynent he was enuyroned / and his master also
with their enemies. and the said knight was the^ slain / because he put him
self to defense / whereof sir Galeas was afterward right sore displeased. So
sir Barnabo was there taken for he made no defense / nor none of his men / and
so he was brought to a castle when his nephue was / who was glad of his
coming. The same day ser Barnabos wife and children were taken / who were to
mary / and they were kept in Myllayne in prison. Than sir Galeas took all the
seignories / towns and castles / that parteyned to sir Barnabo in all Lombardy
to his possessyon: and his uncle dyed I can not say how. I think he was
let blood in the neck according to the blood lettyng in Lombardy when they
will auau^ce a man's end. Anon these tidings sprang abroad / some were glad
thereof and some were sort. For this sir Barnabo had done in his time / many
cruel and horrible deeds / and pytuous justice without reason / so that but
few people complained his trouble / but said / He had well deserved it.
thus ended sir Barnabo / who had in his days raygned puissauntly in Lombardy.

Now let us return to the duke of Burbons and the Earl of Marchesse army /
and what they did in Poictou and in Lymosyn.

THey depted fro Moleyns in Burbonoyse / and so rode forth with great revel:
And the duke had in his company his nephewe Johan of Harcourte. The special
nombre of his army came out of Berry / Auuergne / Poictou / Rouergue / Xaynton
/ and Lymosyn / And they met togider at Nyorte / a.xii. leages fro Poicters. In
this mean season sir Wyllm^ of Lynacke / a right valyant knight seneschall of
Xaynton / who was as than gouernoure of Myllayne (in those marchesse) and so he
came in to Angoulinoys / with a certain nombre of men of arms / a two
hundred: He rested before the castle of the Egle / in the which were
Englishemen. And all the winter and somer past before had greatly domaged the
country. than this sir Wyllyam lyghted a foot / and so did all his company /
and valyantly assailed the castle. It was a sore assaute and well continued /
for they within defended them self for fear of their lives. Sir Wylliam him
self that day did right nobly / and gave ensample how his men should assail
without any sparynge. This assaut was so well continued / that the Castle was
taken byforce: the French men entered in by ladders / and all that were within
slain and taken. Thus this sir Wylliam of Lygnac did the first enterprise in
that season / abydinge for the duke of Burbone and his route.

When the duke of Burbone was come to Nyorte / and his company: There he found
a great nombre of men of war / abydinge for him. And there was ready his cosyn
the earl of March / with a great no^bre / and also the Vycount of Tonnere /
and sir Henry of Thouars seneschall of Lymosyn / the lord of Pons / the lord
of Parteney / the lord of Thouars / the lord of Puyssaunce / and diverse other
barons of Poytou and of Xaynton. And than sir William of Lignacke came to the
duke / who had newly won the Castle of the Egle / wherefore the duke gave him
great thanks. When all these men of war were assembled toguyder / they were
a seuyn hundred spears beside the Geneuoys and other varlettes: They were in
nombre two thousand fighting men. Thasie they took advise whyder they should
go / outher to Vertuell or to Taylboure or to Mountlewe. And all things
considered / they determined to go to Mountlewe / by cause it was a castle /
standing on the laundes of Burdeaur. They thought if they might get that
castell^ all other should be the more easyer to win. And also / than should
no man come out of Burdeaur without their knowledge. so they rode thyderwarde
and passed Angolesme and so came before Mountlewe / and they laid their siege.
The chief leaders of all the dukes host / was sir James Pounsarte / and Johan
Bonne Lance. Incontinent they made ready to assyle the castle / and so
enuyroned the castle about / and gave assault with great courage / and they
within defended them self valiantly. Surely there was an hard assaute and
well continued / and many a proper deed of arms done / For the frenchmen
dilygently mounted up on their ladders / and fought with daggers hand to hand
on the walls. So much did the french men / that by pure assaute they wan
the castle / and they within slain / There were but a few that were saved.
When the fre^ the men had possession of Mou^tlewe / they new lie furuysshed it
with men of war and other prouisyon. And than they took the way to tail
bourcke / of the which forteresse Dynaudon of Perat was captain / a proper
man of arms he made but little count of the frenchmen. and while the duke
lay at siege before this castle / his company wanne two little fortresses /
which had sore harryed the fronters of Poictou and Lymosyn / by reason of the
Englyss^men that were in them. These two fortresses were called Troucet and
Archat / and all that were within were slain / and the castelles delivered to
the^ of the country / and they did beat the^ down to the ground.

How the bridge of Taylbourcke was won by the french men / and how the
English men fortifyed themself against the coming of the french men / And
how the admyrall of France and his rout arrived at Edenborowe in Scotland.
Cap. secundo.
THus the siege was laid before Tailbourcke by four bastedes* there was in Tail
bourcke a bridge on the river of Charent / and the English men and Gascoyns
had well fortifyed it / so that all the season before they could no ship
pass to Rochell nor in to Xaynton / without danger or by truage. Than the
french lords aduysed to win the bridge to have the less to do / and to lie
the more surer in their bastydes. They caused to come to Rochellshippes by the
river of Charent / and in them certain Geneuoys and crosbowes / and made them
to scrymysshe with them of the bridge. There was a sore assaute / for the
English men and gascons had right well fortifyed the bridge / and valyantly
did defend themself / So they were assailed by land and by river. Johan the
son of the earl of Harcourt was there made knight and raised his baner / the
duke of Burbone his uncle made him knight. This assault was well continued /
and many a feate of arms the^ done the Geneuoys and crosbowes that were in the
ships shot so rudely and so hole toguyder at them on the bridge / that none
of them durst scantely show any defense. What should I make long tale? By
force of assault the bridge on the river was won / and all that were found
thereon slain and drowned / none escaped. thus the french men had the bridge of
Taylbourc / their siege was the easyer. It was but three leages fro faint Iohn^s
Dangle / and two leages fro Xauntes / in the best country of the world.

OF the loss of Tayllebourke / they within Dynaudon and other were sore
dismayed / as they had good cause / for they had lost thereby the passage of the
river / how be it yet they would not yield them. They thought themself in a
strong place / and trusted on some rescue fro Bordeaux / For it was showed in
all those fronters and english forteresses / that the duke of Lancastre / or
else the earl of Buckyngham with two thousand men of arms and four thousand
archers / should come to Bordeaux to fight with the french men / and to reyse
all their siege. Of this they greatly trusted / but it fortuned otherwise / as
I shall show you. It was ordained in England / that the Duke of Lancastre and
sit Johan Hollande brother to the king / Sir Thomas Percy / six Thomas Tryuet
/ the lord Fitz water / six Wylliam wyndesore / sit John^ Fitzwaren / and
other barons knights and squyers with a thousand spears and three thousand
archers / should have gone to Bordeaux to have been there all the somer / and to
have refresshed Mortayne / Boutuyll / and other fortresses in Gascoyne and
La^guedocke / and to fight with the French men / if they found them in the
country. And after that they had tarried there a season / than to have gone fro
thens in to Castle / to Bayon / and to Navarre: For they were in treaty with
the king of Nauer. This was ymagined in England / but all turned to naught /
for when they knew the certaynte that the admyrall of France / with a
thousand spears of chosen knights and squyers were come in to Scotland.
Than they changed their purpose / and durst send none of their men out of
the realm / for they doughted greatly the deeds of the french men and Scotts
/ joined toguyder. Also the same time there ran a voice through all England
/ how they should be the same Somer assailed with the frenchmen in three
pertes. One by Bretaygne. for the duke there was become french: And another by
Normandye / for the which (as it was said) The constable of France made his
prouisyon at Harflewe and Deep / and so a long the Scesyde to saint Valeries
and to Crotoy: And the third by the Scotts so that for dought of this / they
would suffer no knights nor squyers to go out of England / but made prouisyon
to defend their hauyns and ports of the sea. The same season the Earl of
Arundell Richard was admyrall of the Sea / and was on the Sea / with a three or
fourscore great ships / furnysshed with men of arms and archers. And he
had small ships that ran in and out / and viewed the bounds of the yles
of Normandy to know tidings.

Now let us leave to speak of the duke of Burbone and of the siege of
Tayllebourcke / where as he lay a nine wekes: and let us show how the
admyrall of France took land in the realm of Scotland / and what chere they
had made to them at their first lodging.

tHe French army that went in to scotland had wind at will. It was in the
monethe of May / when the waters be peaseable and meke / and the air soft
and sweet. First they costed Fla^ders / Holande zelande / and Frise: and at
last aproched to the sight of Scotland. But are they aryued / the^ fell an
hard adventure / to a young knight of France a proper man of arms / called
sir Aubert Da^gyers. The knight was young and of haute courage / and to show
his strength and lyghtnesse of body / he lepte up clean armed on the wall of
the ship / and in the lightynge / his fete slypped / and so fell over the
board in to the sea / so that he could not be helped: For inco^tynent he sanke
down / because of ye weight of his harnes / and also the ship sailed ever
forth. Of this knights adventure / all the barownes and knights were sore
dyspleased / but there was no remedy. And so long they sailed that they
arrived at Edenborowe / the chief town in Scotland. And when as the king in
time of peace most commonly lay. And as soon as the earl Duglas and the Earl
Morette knew of their coming / they went to the hauyn and met with them /
and received them swetely: Saying / how they were right welcome in to that
country: And the barons of Scotland / knew right well sir Geffray de Charney
/ for he had been the somer before two months in their company: sir Geffray
acquaynted them with the Admyrall / and the other knights of France. As at
that time the king of Scotts was not there / for he was in the wild
scottysshe: But it was showed these knight^ / how the king would be there
shortly / wherewith they were well content: and so were lodged there about in
the vyllages. For Edenborough / though the king kept there his chief
resydence and that it is Paris in Scotla^de / yet it is not like Tourney or
Valence^nes / for in all the town there is not four thousand houses.
Therefore it behooved these lords and knights to be lodged about in vyllages:
As at Donfer / Me line / Castle / Do^bare / Aluest / and such other. Anon
tidings sprange about in Scotland that a great nombre of men of arms of
France were come into their country. Some thereat did murmr and grudge / and
said: Who the devil has sent for them? What do they here? Can not we
maynteyne our war with England well enough without their help? We shall
do no good as long as they be with us? Let it be showed unto them / that they
may return again? And that we be strong enough in Scotland to maynteyne
our war without them: And therefore we will none of their company. They
understand not us nor we them / therefore we can not speak toguyder. They will
anon ryffle / and eat up all that ever we have in this country. They shall
do us more dispytes and domages / than though the English men should fight
with us. For though the English men brinne our houses we care little
therefore / We shall make them again chepe enough / We axe but three days to
make them again / if we may geate four or five stakes and bows to cover
them.

How the French men found a wild country of Scotland / and were yuell
content with thadmyrall and how he pacifyed the^ with fair words: And how
Fraunces Atreman and his company had nere hand taken Ardenbourcke in
Flanders. Cap. iii.
THus the scotts said in Scotland / at the coming of the frenchmen thither /
for they did set nothing by them / but hated them in their courage and
diframed them in their language / as much as they might / like rude people
without hououre as they be. All things considered / It was to great an army
of so many noble men to come in to Scotland / and knew no reason why / a
twenty or thrittie knights of France / had been better than all that nombre
of five hundred or a thousand / and the cause why is this.

In Scotland ye shall find no man light / lie of honor nor gentylnesse:
They be like wild and savage people: They will be with no man acquaynted / and
are greatly enuyous with the honor or profit of any other man / and they
dought ever to lose that they have / for it is a poor country. And when the
English men makes any roode or voyage in to the country / as they have done
often before this time / If they think to live / they must cause their
prouysion and vitayle to follow them at their back / for they shall find
nothing in that country but with much pain. Nor they shall find none iron
to show their horses / nor leddar to make harness / sadelles / or bridelles:
For all such things comes to them ready made out of Flaunders. And when that
prouisyon fails / there is none to get in the country.

When the barownes and knights of France who were wont to find fair
hostryes / halles hanged / and goodly castelles and soft beds to rest in:
Saw them self in that necessite: they began to smyle / and said to the
admyrall. Sir / What pleasure has brought us hyder? We never knew what
poverty meant till now? We find now / the old sayenges of our fathers and
mothers true: Whan^e they would say. Go your way: and ye live long / ye shall
find hard and poor beds / which now we find. Therefore / let us go
our voyage that we be come for. Let us ride in to England: The long
taryenge here in Scotland / is to us / another honorable nor profitable. The
admyrall apeased them as well as he might / and said. Sirs / it behooves us to
suffer a little / and to speak fair / sith we be in this danger. We have a
great long way yet to pass / and by England we can not return: Therefore
let us take in gree that we find / We can not be always at Paris or Dygeon
/ at Beauty or at Chalous. It behooves them that will live in this world /
thinking to have honor / to suffer sometime as well poverty as wealth.

THus sir Johan of Vien admyrall of France / apeased to his companyons / with
these words and such other / which I can not all reherce They acquaynted
them as mothe as they might with the barownes of Scotland / but they were
visyted by them but very little: For as I have said before / there is in the^
little honor / and of all people yuell to be aquaynted withal. The most
company that the french men had was the earl Duglas and the earl Morette.
These two lords did them more solace / than all the resydue of Scotland.
yet there was another thing that was right hard to the frenchmen / For when
they were in Scotland and would ride they found horses to dear for that that
was not worth ten florens they could not bye under threscore or a hundred /
and yet with much pain to get any for money / and yet when they had any
horses / than had they another harness / sadell / nor bridell / without they
had brought it with them out of Flanders. In this trouble and danger were the
frenchemen: yea and moreover / Whan^e their varlettes went forth a forragynge
/ and had charged their horses with such as they could get / In their
retouruynge home / the scotts them self lay in wait for them / and all
that they had taken from them / and they well beten and some slain: so that
there was none that durst go a forragynge for fear to be slain. For in a
month the french men lost of their varlettes mo than a hundred: For if they
went forth three or four toguyder / they never returned again. Thus the
french men were handeled: And beside that / the king of Scotts was desired
to comeforthe / and so were the other lords / knights / and squyers of the
realm. But they answered and said: How they would make no war in to
England / as at that time. And that they said / to thentent that the French
men should pay well for their coming. For or the king would come out of the
wild scottysshe to Edenboroughe / he demanded to have a great sum of money
/ for him and for his people: And the admyrall of France was said to promise
and to seal / that the king should have a certain sum of money or he and
his company avoided the Realm: It he had not done thus / he should have had
none aid of the scotts: He was feign to make that marchaundise or else a
worse. And yet when he had made the best accord and a^oyntment that he could
make with them / he had by them but little profit nor help / as ye shall
here further in the history.

But now a little I will return and tell of the adventures of Flaunders and
of the marriage of the young french king / and how Ardenbourcke had nere
been taken by stelthe / where as the Vycont of Meaulx and sir John^ of Ieumont
lay in garyson.

AFter the disconfyture that sir Ryflarte of Flaunders had made in the land of
the four crafts with out Gaunt / than he came to Arde^bourcke: And thither was
sent in garyson sir Robert of Bethune vycou^t of Meaulx / and there he found
sir Johan of Iumont and his company: And thither was sent a.xl. spears
knights and squiers / such as desired to seek adventures. Whan^e the Vycount
was come thider / he intended to fortify and repair the town in all points.
Fraunces Atreman and they of Gaunte / subtelly ymagyned night and day / how
they might anoye and do damage to their enemies / as they showed rightwell to
their neighbors / as And warp / Teremo^de Ardenbourcke / Bruges / Danne^ and
Scluse. They ever ymagined / how to win any of them by craft: And to say
the troth / they had such company as were mete to execute such deeds. So it
fortuned / about the end of May Frau^ces Atreman and a seuyn thousand with
him departed fro Gaunt / to thentent to win Ardenbourke by stelth / and all
the knights and squyers therein: And specially they desired to have the
captain sir Johan Iumont / because he had done them many great domages / as
in taking and sleyng / and puttyng out of their cyen / and cuttyng of hands /
fete / and ears of their men. So thus on a Wednisdaye about the dawning of
they day / they came to Arde^bourcke / and had with them scalynge leddars ready.
The Vycounte of Meaulx / sir Johan Iumount / sir Ryflarte of Flaunders / the
lord of Damert / sir Tercelette of Montigny / and sir Parducas of Pount saint
Mark / the lord of Langueuall and sir Johan his son / sir Hew Desnell /
the lord de Lalayne / sir Reynolde of Lo^mye / and diverse other lay slepyng in
their beds / on trust of the watch. Now behold what adventure they were
in. The watch that had watched all night / was as than departed / and their
relief not come as than. The same season Fraunces Atreman and the gau^toise
with their ladders were ready come in to the dikes / and so ca^e to the walls
and dressed up their ladders / and began to mount. The same season by adventure
/ there was walking within the wall / the lord of saint Albyne / and with him
a squire of Picardy named Enguerant ze^dequyn a picarde with a morespike. I
think they had been of the watch the same night / and was not as than departed
/ To say the truth and they had not ben / Ardenbourcke had been taken / and
all the knights in their beds.

How the lord of saint Albyne and Enouerant zendequyn saved Ardenbourke fro
taking / and how the queen of Hungry sent ambassadors in to France / to mary
therle of Voloyes to her eldest daughter. Capi. iiii.
When sir Gousseaux of saint Martyne and Enguerant zendequen: saw how the
gauntoyse mounted up the walls by ladders / and they saw where there was one
putting his leg over the wall to have entered in to the town* they were tha^
sore abashed / but yet not so much but that they took conforte to them self:
For they saw well if they fled / the town were lost without recovery* for
they parceyued well that their entryng was between the departing of the watch
/ and the coming of the relief. Than Enguerant said to the mores pyke: Seppe
on forward: Behold yonder the gauntoyse are entering / help to defend us /
or else the town is lost. And so they three went to the same place where as
they saw the gauntoyse entering / and the Pycarde with the mores pyke / struck
him that was entering over the wall such a stroke / that he hare him clean fro
the wall and ladder / and so fell down in to the dyke. and therewith the watch
arose / and saw how there were in the dykes and there about / a great
battle of the gauntoyse. Than^e he sowned his trumpette: Treason treason.
Therewith the town styrred every man out of their beds / and harkened to the
cry / and saw how the gaunte is would have stolen their town. Than they
armed them as fast as they might: how be it for all this the gauntoyse did
all their best to have entered in to their town. And the said three persons
valyantly defended the walls / more than the space of half an hour / against
all the comers the which turned to their great praise. Than^e the other lords
and knights came thither in good array / as the Vycount of Meaulx with his
bauer before him / sir Johan of Ieumont his penon before him / and sir Ryflarte
of Flaunders / and other: and they found the knight / the squire / and the
mores pyke / fighting and defending the walls. Than^e they cried their cries
to the rescue. And when Fraunces Atreman and the gauntoyse parceyued the matter
/ and how they had failed of their ententes / they withdrewe themself fair
and casely / and reculed their people / and so departed and returned in to the
rule of the four crafts. And so than they of the garyson of Ardenbourke took
more head to the keeping of the town than they did before / and they honored
greatly among them / the foresaid three persons / for and they had not been /
the town had been lost and all their throtes cut.

yE have herd here before / how the duke of Aniou / who called him self
king of Naples / of Cecyle / and of Jerusalem / made war three years / In
Pule / Calabre / and in Naples / against sir Charles dela Paix: and in the
making of that war he dyed / and in likewise so did sir Charles dela Paix.
Some said he was slain in the realm of Hungry by the consentment of the queen
/ for after the death of the king of Hungry / because this sir Charles was
son to the kings brother / therefore he maynteyned that the Realm should
fall to him: For his uncle the king of Hungry after his death / left behind
him but daughters. So therefore the queen feared leest he would disheryte her
daughters: And therefore (as it was said) she caused this sir Charles dela Paix
to be slain / of whose death there was had great marueyle / and so thereby the
queen was sore enforsed / and of her young son the king being at Auignon /
and so they made wary in Prouence / the king of Hungry lyuenge. The barons and
prelates of Hungry cou^sayled him to give Margarete his eldest daughter /
which was likely to be a great enheritour to Loyes of France earl of Valoyes
son / and brother to the french king / because they thought he should than
abide among them in Hu^gry. And when the king was deed / they sent
ambassadors in to France to the king and to his uncles / showing how the
queen of Hungry would have for her eldest daughter the earl of Valoyes. This
request seemed to the king and to his uncles and to the barons of France / to
be right noble and profitable / except one thing. They thought thereby / that
the earl of Valoyes should be very far of fro his own nation / How be it
all things consydred / they thought it a noble and a right profitable thing
for the earl of Valoyes to be king of Hungry / the which is one of the
grettest realms in crystendome. So these ambassadors were greatly feested and
nobly received / and to the^ given many great gifts: And so again with them
there went to Hu^gry other ambass. out of France: As the bishop of
Maylleretes and sir John^ la Parson / who by procuracyon general / when they
were come in to Hu^gry / he wedded in the name of the earl of Valoyes the lady
Margarete / and thanne the bishop returned in to France. And also sir
Johan Parson / who had wedded the lady and lain by her a bed / curtesly /
according to the custom in such matters required. And of this when he came
in to France / he showed letters patentes and publyke instruments / so that
they of France were well content. And so long after / the earl of Valoys
wrote himself king of Hungry.

ALso ye have herd / how the duke of burgoyne and the duke Aubert of Bauier /
lord of Heynalte / Hollande zelande / and Frise / had married their children at
Cambray toguyder / At which marriage the french king was with great tryumphe.
Some said / how the same time that the french king and his uncles: the duke
of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone / and the duke Aubert were there at Cambray /
and the lady of Burgoyne / the lady of Brabant / and the lady of Heynalte. How
that by the procurement of the duchess of Brabante / there was secretly a
treaty of marriage moved between the young king Charles of France and the lady
Isabell / daughter to duke Stephyn of Bauyer. For king Charles of France that
last dyed before in his death bed / he ordained / that Charles his son
should be married in to Almaygne / if they saw any place co^uenyent / whereby
the almayns should be alyed to France: For he saw well / how the king of
England was married to the king of Almaynes suster / whereby he spedde much the
better. This duchess of Brabant / who was a right sore ymaginatyue lady /
showed many reasons to the kings uncles / and to his counsel: saying / how
this lady was daughter to a great lord in Almaygne / and the greattest of all
the Bauyers. And how that thereby / they should have great alyaunce in
Almaygne / For duke Stephyn (she said) was so great a man / that he might
well break the purposes of the great lords of thempyre / For he was as great
or greatter / than the king of almaygne / the which enclyned sonest the
counsel of France / to parceyuer in that matter / How be it the matter was
handeled right secretly / For there were but few that knew thereof till it
were done: And the cause why this was. It is the usage in France / that any
lady daughter to any great lord / if the King should mary her / first she
should be seen and viewed all naked / by certain ladies thereto admytted / to
know if she were proper and mete to bring forth children: and also because
this lady was of a far country / so that if she should be pleasant to the
king or not / or else all were broken. for these causes the matter was kept
secret / but the lady about the feast of Penthecost after / she was brought to
Brabant to the duchess there / who joyfully received her and ordered her /
according to the usage of France. And with her in company was duke Frederyke
of Bauyer her uncle / by whom to say truth the marriage was first procured /
by such ways as I shall show you.

How the duchess of Brabaunt wrote to duke Frederyke of Bauyer of the marriage
of the young french king with her nese Isabell of Bauyer: And how the duke
and the lady came to Quesnoy. Cap. v.
When that duke Frederyke of Bauier ca^e first in to France to serve the
french: king in his journey that he made in to flaunders / and came to the
siege of Boutbourcke. True it was / he was feested and received by the kings
uncles / because he was come so far of to serve the king / as out of the
country of Bauyer / the which was more than two hundred leages of. This was
reputed for a great service / and he was always loged nere to the king / in
token of good love and favor. And when he departed out of Bauyer he thought
surly that there should be battle between the French king and the king of
England / in the marchesse of Flanders or of france / for so ran all the
brute in all Almaygne. Therefore the king and his uncles gave him the more
thank. And thus as he was with the king in that voyage before Burbourke and
Bergues / the kings uncles curtesly demanded on a day of him / if he had any
daughters to mary* saying / how they lacked a wife for the king / and how
that they had rather the king should mary in Bauyer / rather than^e in any
other place / For aunciently the buyers were of the counsel of France. The
duke answered and said: surely I have no daughter to mary / but mine elder
brother / duke Stephyn of Bauyer has a right fair Lady to his daughter. Of
what age is she of quod the lords? Between. xiii. and fourtene quod the duke.
That is all that we desire / quod the kings uncles. Therefore sir / when ye do
return home in to Bauyer speak to your brother of the matter: and bring your
nese a pylgrimage to saint Iohn^s of Amyence / and the king shall be there if it
please him. We drink he will desire it / for he loves gladly to se fair
things. and if he wysshe to have her / she shall be queen: So this was the
first procurement: and as at yt time there was no more done nor said. The
king knew no thing of these words. And whan^e this duke Federyke of Bauyer
was returned home / he showed all this matter to duke Stephyn of Bauyer his
brother / who studied somewhat at his words / and at last said: Fair brother
/ I believe well it is as ye say. My daughter should be happy if she might come
to so high an honor / as to be french queen: But France is very far of /
and it is a matter wisely to be regarded / to make a Queen. I should be right
soore displeased / if my daughter should be carried in to France for such a
purpose / and than sent home again. yet I had rather mary her at mine ease /
nerer home. This was the answer that duke Stephyn gave to his brother duke
Frederyke / where with duke Frederyke was well content / and wrote all his
answer to France to the Kings uncles and to his uncle duke Auberte / and to
the Duches of Brabant. They had went that duke Frederyke had forgoten the
matter For they were about maryages for the king in other places. And the
king was nere agreed to the daughter of the duke of Lorayne / for she was a
fair damsel of her age, nere to the kings age. She was of noble and great
generacyon of the house of Bloyes. Also there was spekyng for the daughter of
the Duke of Lancastre / who was after queen of Portyngale: but there was no
conclusion / because of the war. Therefore the matter hanged still in suspense
(and as ye have herd before) The duches of Brabant wha^ she was at Camb^ay /
at the maryages of Burgoyne and Heynalte: and that the french king was they
and the duke of Burbone and Burgoyn were there / Than she moved forth this
marriage of Bauyer / for the king affirmynge that it was most profitable and
honorable for the king / because of the alyaunce with Almaygne. Madame quod
the kings uncles / we here nothing thereof. Well quod the duchess / I warrant
you ye shall here somewhat thereof / or this somer be paste. Her promise was well
fulfilled / for she did so much / that duke Frederyke / uncle to the damsel
was so agreed with his brother duke Stephyn / that he should be convey the lady
in to France: And that it should be noysed all the way / that they went a
pylgrimage to saint Iohans of Amyence. Every man supposed the same / for
Almayns go the often on pylgrimage it is their usage.

When duke Frederyke and his nese the lady Isabell of Bauyer / had been three
days at Brusels / than they took leave / but it was the duchess intensyon to
be as soon at Amyence / or sooner than they. So than they came in to Heynaulte
to Quesnoy / where they found the duke and the duchess / and sir Wyllyam earl
of Ostrenaunt and his wife. There thy were nobly received for duke Aubert was
her uncle / and had great marueyle what brought them in to that country: And
than demanded why they came thither? Certaynlye quod duke Frederyke / I have
had much pain to bring the matter to this purpose: And so there he showed him
all the matter / and said. I have brought my brother in that mind / that I have
brought my nese hyder as ye say / but when I departed my brother said to me.
Now Frederike my fair brother / ye lead with you Isabell my daughter without
any sure estate / For if the french king will refuse her / than is she shamed
for ever / therefore advise you well: For if the matter come not well to pass /
ye shall have me your enemy for ever. Therefore fair uncle / ye may se what
danger I have put my self in. Than duke Aubert said: fair nephue be not
dismayde / for by the pleasure of god / she shall be the french queen / and
than^e shall ye be quyte / and have the love of duke Stephyn your brother.

THus they tarried at Quesnoy the space of three wekes / and ye duchess who was
sage / endoctryned the young damsel of Bauyer / in manner and in countenance
/ and changed her appayrell / for she was but simplye arrayed / after the
state of France: Thanne she arrayed her / as though she had been her own
daughter. And when every thing was ready / ye duches and the damoselle rode
forth / till they came to Amience. And by that time was come thither / the
duches of Burgoyne and of Brabant / and also the french king and his
counsel / The lord de la River and sit Guy de la Tremoyle. Barownes and
knights issued out of Amyence to mete and receive them of Heynalte. Thus they
were brought in to Amyence and had much honor done to them / and the lords
and ladies each of them did vysite other louyngly. But with much pain the
king might sleep / for the inward desire yt he had to se her that should be
his wife. And he demanded of the lord de la River when he should se her. of
those words the ladies had great sport so that the Fridaye when the damsel
was ready / the three duchesses led the damsel to the king. and than she
kneled down / but the king took her up by the hand and beheld her well by
which regard / love entered in to his herre. Than the constable of France
said to the lor-Coucy. Sir / by my faith this lady shall abide with us / I se
well by ye king / for his eyes gothe never from her. So when they had been with
the king certain space / the ladies took leave of the king and went to their
lodgings as yet they knew not the kings intencyon. Than the duke of Burgoyn
charged the lord de la River to enquere of the king his mind / who did so
right dilygently / saying. Sir / and it like your grace / how like you this
young lady? Shall she abide with us? yea truly quod the king / she right well
pleases us. Therefore show? unto mine uncle of Burgoyne / that she may be
delyucred to us. When the lord de la River herd him say so / he incontinent
showed it to ye duke of Burgoyne. And he straight way went and showed it to
the ladies / whereof they had great joy and cried No well. thus the lords and
ladies were in great joy / and the kings uncles were in mind to have had the
marriage at Arras / but it pleased not the king to go so far. Therefore he
desired his uncle / that it might be done there. Well quod the duke in a good
hour be it / so let it be.

THan the duke of Burgoyne / the constable / the lord de la River / and the
lord de la Tremoyle / and diverse other in his company went to the lady of
Heynault / and found her with her nese by her / There he showed the^ these
tidings / how the king had broken their purpose / as the marriage to be had at
Aras / saying / how the matter touched the king so nere wherefore to morrow
next we must heal him of his sickness / the duches began to smyle. And so
than they departed each fro other with great joy and solce. The same saturday
at night Fraunces Atreman and the gauntoyse / with a seuyn thousand with him
went out of the lands of the four crafts / after he had failed of taking
of Ardenbourke. and he promised to them of Gaunt at his departing that he
would never return in to Gaunt / till he had won some good town / for the
gauntoyse did what they might to put the french men to such business /
that they should send no more company in to Scotland to the admyrall / to
make war against the Englysshmen / for there was a common brute / that the
Constable and diverse other men of arm / and certain cross bows of Gene /
should enter into the sea and go in to Scotland to reconforte their men that
were there allredy / making war against England. Fra^ces Atreman who was a
proper man of arms issued the said saturday out of the quarter called the
four crafts / and all night he went costyng Bruges / trustyng to have won
it / but it would not be. When he saw that he failed there / he went to
Danne: and there his spies met with him / and said. Sir / it were good ye
went to Danne / for sir Roger of Guystelles who is captain there / is not
now in the town. and true it was / he was goone to Bruges / wenyng that the
town of Dan had been strong enough for their defense / but he was disceyued.

How Frau^ces Atreman took the town of Dan / and how the french king wedded
the lady Isabell of Bauyer: and after went and laid siege to Danne.
WHan^e Fraunces Atreman knew by his espyes / yt sir Roger of Guystels was not
in Dan / he divided his company in two / and took him self the less nombre /
and said. Sirs / go you yonder ways to such a gate / and whasie ye here me
blow go to the barryers and back the^ down / and I and my company shall beat
down the gate / for it will be over long or we enter by ladders / the town
shall be ours I put no dout: It was done as he ordained and so went with the
less no^bre. And so the first went with ladders in to the dykes. They found
no withstandyng / and passed the mire and dressed up their ladders and so
entered in to the town and came to the gate / sownynge their horns without any
danger / for the good men of ye town were in their beds this was the.xvii.
day of July. thus they came to the gate and brake the barriers / and they
without brake down ye barriers there / so that every man entered. Than they of
the town began to styre but that was to late / for they were taken in their
houses / and as many as were found in harness and at defense / were slain
with out mercy. Thus the good town of Dan was taken. wherein was found great
richesse / and specially the sellers full of Maluesey and wine Granade. And it
was showed me / how there was great richesse there of the^ of Bruges / which
they had brought thither / for fear that they had of rebellyon of the common
people.

ERau^ces Atreman / when he saw that he was lord of Dan / he was greatly
reioysed and said. Now have I well kept my promise with them of Gaunte. This
town shall serve us well to master Bruges / Sluse / and Ardenbourcke. Than
incontinent he made a cry that no man should be so hardy to touch or do any
displeasure to any lady or ge^tylwoman in the town. There was the same time
there / a seuyn knights wives / who were come thither to se the lady of
Guystelles / she was ready to lie down a child beed. Thus after they had
pilled the town and slain all such as would not take their part / than they
went to repair the town again. When they of Bruges herd thereof they
werefore displeased / and not without a cause and armed them: And with baner
displayed came before the town of Dan / and began to scrimysshe / and to
assail the town / but all was for naught. they lost more than they wan / and
so returned again to Bruges. When these tidings came to Gaunt they were
greatly reioysed / and reputed that enterprise for a noble deed / and Frau^ces
Atreman for a valyant man. Now let us return to the french kings weddyng.

When the duches Margarete of Heynaulte, who had the young lady in her keeping.
When she saw the day was come she apparelled the lady honestly / and to them
came the duches of Burgoyne and the duches of Brabant / accompanied with many
ladies and damsels. These three ladies conveyed the lady Isabell of Bauiers in
a chair / rychelye covered with a crown on her heed / worth the richesse of
a realm / which the king had sent her before. and the bishop of the same
place did wedde them in the presens of all the lords and ladies. After the
mass and solempnyte finysshed the king and all they went to dinner / which was
great and sumptuous / and earls and barownes served the king in rich array.
Thus the day co^tynued in great sport till it was night / than the king went
to bed with his new wife / So the feast endured till the wednisday after.
Than tidings came to the king and his counsel / how Fraunces Atreman had
won the town of Danne. also there came an haraude from the duke of Burbone
and brought letters to the king / signifyeng him how Taylbourcke was won and
turned french / and how the duke of Burbone and his company was going to ley
siege to Vertuell and how they had in Poyctou / Xaynton / and Limosyn /
reco^quered six forteresses. These tidings somewhat reioysed the court / and
set at naught the lesyng of Danne / saving that it was concluded that the
king should do no thing till he had been in Flaunders / and won again Danne /
and to enter so far in to the four crafts / out of the which all the venym
issued / that he should leave no house standing / but to dystroy all. Than
messangers were sent over all the realm of France / co^mau^dynge all men of
war to be by the first day of August in ye marchesse of Picardy to ley siege
to Dan. These tidings spredde abroad in the realm of France / and every
knight and squire made them ready to come to the king / as they were commanded.
The same day duke Federyke of Bauyer and duke Aubert / and all the barony took
leave of the king / and every man returned home to their own / and left with
the king the lady Isabell of Bauyer / as than the french queen.

THe french king / who had made his commandment through all his realm /
said how he would never come in Paris till he had been before the town of
Danne. And so the.xxv. day of July he departed fro Amyence with the constable /
and diverse other lords of his house and went to Arras / where he tarried but
one night / and the next day he went to Lan in Atthoyse: and daily men of war
came to him fro all pertes / and so at last he came to Iprso that by ye first
day of August he was before Dan / and lay so nere to it / that the gonne shot
passed over his heed. A three days after came to the king Wylliam of Neynaulte
/ who was right welcome to the king and to the duke of Burgoyne. So there they
laid a goodly siege about Dan / and therein was enclosed Frau^ces Atreman / who
bare him self valiantly / for every day there was outher scrimyshe or assaut
without it were truse. The lord of Clary who was master of the ordinance
with the lord of Coucy / was stricken with a quarrel out of the town: of
which stroke he dyed / which was great damage / for he was a noble knight. To
the siege of Danne there came men out of the good towns of Flaunders: as Ipre
/ Bruges and out of Frank. At this siege were beyond a hundred thousand men.
The king lay between Dan and Gaunte: and captain of the Flemmynges was the
lord of saint Pie and the lord of Guystels with a.xxv. spears / and lay
mids among them for fear of discencion.

How diverse burgesses of Sluse were beheeded: and how Sluse was changed for
the land of Bethune: and how the siege of Danne contynewed long. Cap. vii.
AT an assault there was made knight by the king Wylliam of Heynalte: that day
he reared up his baner / and quytte him self like a good knight: But at that
assaute the French men lost more than they wanne / for Fraunces Atreman had
with him certain archers of England / who greatly grieved the assaylantes:
Also he had great plenty of artillary / for when the town was won it was
well furnyssed: And also he caused much to be brought fro Gau^t / when he
knew that he should have siege laid to the town. In the same season while
the siege lay thus before Danne / some of the greattest of the town of Sluse
/ such as than bare most rule in the town / were so wrapped with treason /
yt they would have delivered the town to the kings enemies / and to have
murdered their captain and his company in their beds / and to have set fire
in the kings navy / that lay there at ancre / laded with prouisyon for the
king. Before he went to Danne / he was in purpose to have gone in to
Scotland after his admyrall. And also these treators had thought to have
broken down the sea banks / thereby to have drowned the greattest part of the
kings host / Of all this they had made marchaundise with them of Gau^te / and
all these treasons should have been done in one night: but there was a good man in
the town as he was in an hostry herd all this treason / that they were
purposed to do / And incontinent he went to the captain and showed him the
matter / and named to him certain of them that had thus conspyred the treason.
When ye captain herd that he sore marueyled / and took a threscore spears
of his company and went fro house to house of the treatours / and so took and
set them in diverse prisons in sure keeping. Than he took his horse and rode
to the king and so came to his tente / before him and the duke of Burgoyne: he
showed all ye matter how the town of Sluse was likely to have been lost / and
all the kings host likely to have been in the water to the breasts / whereof
the king and the lords had great marueyle. And than the captain was
commanded that he should return to Sluse / and incontinent to stryke of all
their heedes without any respyte / thereby all other to take ensample. So the
captain returned / and incontinent struck of all their heedes / This was the
conclusion of that business. Than the duke of Burgoyne cast in his advise to
find some means to entreat his cosyn sir William of Namure / to have of him
the town of Sluse by exchange for other lands / and to join that town to
the county of Flaunders. And this was much by thaduyse of sir Guy de la
Tremoyle / who had the sormer before soiourned in Sluse with a certain nombre
of men of war.

wHan^e sir Wylliam of Namure herd first speaking of that matter / he was
marvelously displeased: for the town of Sluse / with the apendauntes and
profytes of the sea was a fair and a profitable heritage / and it was fallen
to him by his ancestors wherefore he loved it the better: How be it the duke
of Burgoyne lay so sore on him therefore that there was no remedy / but to make
the exchange: For the dukes entensyon was to make there a strong castle / to
subdue all comes and goers by the sea entryng in to the haven of Sluse and to
keep it with me^ of war / so that none should enter by the sea in those
marchesse / without their danger / and to make a tower so high to se troe^tie
leages in to the sea. So thus breuely this sir wylliam of Namure was so sore
desired by the duke of Burgoyne and his counsel / that he was content to
exchange Sluse for the lands of Bethune / which is a fair and a great
heritage in that country / he to have that to him and to his heirs for ever:
And so than incontinent the duke of Burgoyn set work men a work to make the
Castle of Sluse. Now let us speak of the siege of Danne.

THere was nere every day an assaute / and diverse scrimysshes at the gates and
barriers / so that diverse were hurt and slain day lie. The frenchmen could not
well come to the walls because of the dykes were full of mire / for if it had been rayny wether / the host should have had much a do / and should have been
feign to have dislodged wheder they would or not But by the space of a month
that the siege endured it never rayned / and they had vitayle enough: How be
it because of the yuell air and the stynkynge of deed beestes and horses the
air was so corrupt / that diverse knights and squyers were thereby sore sick
/ so that diverse went to refresshe them at Bruges and other places / to forsake
the yuell air.

tHe king him self went and lay at Marles / how be it his tents were still
pight up in the field. The intent of Frau^ces Atreman was to hold still the
town / till socours came out of England to reyse the siege / and surely they
of Gaunte had send in to England for rescue / and surely the king of
Englandes uncles had come over the sea sufficiently garnysshed with men of
war and at tillarye to have raised the siege / but that they were let
because of the admyralles being in Scotland / with acertayne nombre of men of
arms. And also it was said in the realm of England / that the constable of
France should come after in to Scotland with a great puissan^ce for to make
war into England / whereby the gauntoyse were not resrued. Where fore it
behooved them within the town of Dan to make an yuell bargayne.

Now the gauntoyse fled out of Dan by night / and how the french men took
the town and distroyed it And also how the king distroyed the country of the
four crafts. Cap. viii.
THe.xxvii. day of August the town of Dan was won For when Fraunces Atreman
parceyued that he had no socour / and that his artillary began to fail / than
he was some what disconforted in himself / and said to them of his counsel.
Sirs / I will that we of Gaunt go our ways and let us show this one to
another secretly for if they of the town knew of our depertyng / to save
them self / their wives and children: Paraduenture they will make a shrewdemar
chaundyse for us. yea / and deliver us to our enemies / so that they may be in
rest and peace / and that should cost us our lives / but I shall keep them
well therfro. Wherefore let us keep us all toguyder / and let us go about the
town to vysite the watch / and let us cause the men and women of the town
to go in to the mynster / making them to believe that to morrow next we shall
have a great assaute / and because we would yt they should have no damage /
therefore we will have them in surety in the church out of the way. And we
shall say to the watchemen / that we will go out and make a scrymysshe with
the host. And when we be in the feldes / let us ride on the spurs to
Gaunte. They of his counsel said: Sir ye have well said / so let it be. And
so every man ordained them self as they had purposed / and in the euenyng they
trussed ready all their goods / such as they might carry away / and put all
women and children and other prisoners in to the mynster / and specially all
ladies and ge^tyl women / Saying to them: Fair ladies / we shall have to
morrow in the morning a great assaute / and we would not that ye should be
abashed / or take any damage. So thus they left them in the church / and at
the first hour of the night the gauntoise went and did visyte the watch and
on the walls there were none but they of the town. Than Fraunces Atreman
said to them. Sirs / make this night good watch / and depart not fro the
walls for any thing ye here orse / for in ye morning we shall have an assaut /
but yet first this night I will awake the host / his words were well believed
every man went he had said truth. When he had ordained every thing
according to his mind / than he caused a gate to be opyned / and so he and
all his company issued out / and he was not half a leage fro the town but it
was day light. Than they of the town parceyued well that Fraunces Atremen and
all his company were gone. Than they thought them self desceyued / than ye
thief of the town began to entreat with the men of the kings / that were
there as prisoners / saying to them / how they had slain Fraunces Atreman
the same night.

When diverse of the town of Dan understood how Frau^ces Atreman and his
company were gone / and how the gate was opyn / they ran out of the town that
best might: and when this was known in thoost the bretons and burgonyons
desyring to win / mounted on their horses and fell in the chase / and pursued
the gauntoise till they ca^e within two leages of Gaunte. So in the chase there
were many slain and taken mo than five hundred / but of them were but few
gau^toise / but most of Danne / that fled out of the town. In the mean
season the town was assailed / where was made no defense. So the french men
entered on every side by ladders / and had passed the dykes with much pain.
And when they were within / they had wend to have won great riches / but they
found there nothing but poor people / men women and children / and great
plenty of good wynes / and so for dispyte and displeasure they set fire in
the town / so that it was nighe all brent / whereof the king and the duke of
Burgone was sore displeased / but they could not amend it: How be it the
ladies and gentyl women with much pain were saved fro hurt of their bodies or
loss of their goods.

AFter the taking of Dan / the king was counsayled to dissodge and so the king
went and lodged a two leages fro Gaunte / at a town called Artulle / and
whiles the king lay there / his men of arms rode in the country of the four
crafts and distroyed all the country: because in time past / the gauntoysehad
chief comfort ever fro them. Therefore they brent down towers / churches /
and houses / and chased the men women / and children in to the woods. When the
Frenchmen had done that destruction / than it was ordained to go and lay siege
to the castle of Gaure and than after to Gaunte / but all that turned to
nothing / for tidings came to the king being at Artuelle fro the queen of
Hungry / by the bishop of Wasselure / the said queen's ambassador with diverse
knights and squyers in his company: and they brought letters of credence /
certifyeng how the said queen was coming in to France / to fetch Jews of
France earl of Valoys / to have him in to Hu^gry to her daughter / Whom sir
Johan la Parson had wedded by procuracion in the name of the earl of Valoyes.
These tidings pleased greatly the king and his counsel / and so it was
thought that for the honor of the young Jews earl of Valois / that they
should return in to France / and thought they had done enough for that
season in the country of Flanders.

Now the french king departed out of Flaunders / and gave leave to his men to
depart / and how he ca^e to Paris to treat with the ambassadors of Hungry:
and how the Marquis of Blanquefort took by strength to his wife the same lady
enherytoure of Hungry. Cap. ix.
THan the french king departed fro Artuell the. xii day of Septembre / and
gave leave to all men of war to return to their own houses / of the which
depertynge the Gauntoyse were right glad. Than the king went to Craye where
the queen his wife was / for when he went fro Amyens to Flanders / he sent her
thither to keep her estate / and so he tarried they certain days and so the king
went to Paris and the queen to Boyse de Vyncens. And they the king and his
counsel intended for the ordring of the young earl of Valoyes for he would
that he should go nobly in to Hu^gry / where as they took him for king. But the
matter changed otherwise mashorte season after in the realm of Hungry as ye
shall here after. It is of truth yt the queen of Hu^gry mother to the young
lady / whom the earl of Valoys had wedded by proeuracion (as ye have herd
before) had all her intent to make that if god be pleased they would make such
a voyage / yt should be to their honor and profit The king than sent out his
commandment to assemble his power / and so at the day assigned he had ready
a.xxx. thousand men all on horse back / and as they came / they lodged
according to the usage of their country / I think not all at their ease.

SIr Johan de Vyen who had great desire to ride / and to enploye his time in to
England / to do some great enterprise / When he saw the scotts were come he
said. Sirs / now it is time to ride / we have lain to long still: so than the
setting for ward was publysshed to every man / tha^ they took their way to
Rosebourcke. In this journey the king was not / he abode still at Ede^borow but
all his sons were in the army. The thou sand complete harness that the
French men brought with the^ / was delivered to the knights of Scotland and
of Norwiche / who were before but yuell harnessed / of the which harness they
had great joy / And so they rode toward Northumberlande: And so long they
rode that they came to the abbey of Mauues / and there they lodged all about
the river of Tymbre / and the next day they ca^e to Morlane and than before
Roseboucke. The kepar of Roseboure under the lord Mo^tagu / was a knight
called sir Edward Clyfforde. The admyrall of France and the scotts tarried
and beheld well the castle / and all things considred / they saw well to
assail it should little aucyle them for the castle was strong and well
furnysshed with artillary. And so than they passed by and drew a long the
river side aprochyng to Berwyke. And so long they rode that they came to two
towers right strong / which were kept by two knights / the Father and the
son / both were called sir Johan Strande. About these towers were fair
lands and a fair place / the which incontinent were brent / and the two
towers assailed. There was many feats of arms showed: and diverse scotts hurt
with shot and cast of stones / Finally the towers were won / and the
knights within by plain assaut / yet they defended the^ as long as they
might endure.

How the frenchemen and scotts wanne the castle of Varley / and distroyed
diverse other towns in Nor thumberlande / and how they with drew again in to
Scotla^de when they knew that the king of England came on them with a great
puyssaunce. Cap. xi.
AFter the conquest of these two towers / than they went to another castle
called Varley / parteyning to the heritage of sir John Montagu and Captain
there under him was sir Johan of Lussenborne / who had there with him his wife
and his children / and all his good. He knew well before that the scotts
would come thither / therefore he had purneyed the castle to the best of his
power to abide the assaute. So about this castle tarried all the army. This
castle stood in a fair country / by a fair river which comes out of Tymbre
/ and ronneth in to the sea. So on a day there was a great assaut / and the
french men bare the^ well the same day / much better than the scotts did /
for they entered in to the dykes / and passed through with much pain / There
was many feats of arms done / what by them above and them beneth: The french
men mounted up by ladders and fought hand to hand with daggars on the walls.
Sir Johan Lusse^borne did quyte him self like a valyant knight / and fought
with the french men hand to hand on the ladders. At this assaute there was
slain a knight of Almaygne called sir Bleres Gastelayne / which was great
damage. There were many hurt that day / but finally there was so much people
and thassaute so well continued / that the castle was won / and the knight /
his wife and children taken / and a.xl. other prisoners. And than the castle
was brent and rased down / for they saw well that it was not to be kept /
seeing that it was so far in England as it was. Than the admyrall and scotts
rode toward Auwike in ye land of the lord Percy / and lodged there about /
and brent certain villages: and so came to another castle of therle of
Northu^berlandes / standing on the sea side / but they assailed it not / for
they knew well they should lose their pain. And so they rode all about that
fronter / halfwaye between Berwyke and Newcastell on the river of Tyne / and
there they understood / how yt the duke of Lancaster / therle of
Northu^berlande / the earl of Notingham / the lord Neuell / and the barons of
those marches of Northu^berlande / and of the bysshoprikes of york and Dyrham
/ were coming on them with a great power. When thadmyrall of France knew
thereof he was right joy full / and so were all the barons of France that were
in his company / for they desired to have battle / but the scotts cared
Iytell therefore. there they were counsayled to return again toward Berwyke /
because of their prouisyon that followed them: and also to be nere their own
country / and there to abide for their enemies. So thadmyrall believed the^ /
and returned toward Berwyke / whereof sir Thomas Redman was captain / and
with him right good men of arms. So the french men and scotts lay before the
town / but assailed it not / and so passed by the next day and took the way
to Burbourcke / to return to their own countrees.

Tidings was brought anon in to England how the frenchmen and scotts were
in Northum berla^de / and distroyed and brent the country. The king of
England knew rightwell before of their coming / wherefore ye lords were ready
in the field / and took their way toward the scotts. Thenglysshmen had made
that somer the grettest prouisyon / that ever they made to go in to Scotland
both by land and water. They had a.xxvi. vessels on the fee charged with
provision costyng the fro^ters of England / ready to enter in to every haven of
Scotland. And the king ca^e him self aco^panyed with his uncles / therle of
Ca^bridge and sir Thoin^s Holand: There was also therle of Salisbury / therle of
Atu^dell / the young earl of Penbroke / the young lord Spe^sar therle of
Stafforde / and therle Mysien / and so many barons and knights that they were
four.M. speres / beside them that were before with the duke of Lancaster / therle
of Northu^berla^de / therle therle of Notynghm^ / the lord Lucy / the lord
Neuell. The lords and barons that were on before pursuyng the scotts / were a
two.M. spears and.xv. M. archers / And the king and the lords were fyftie.M.
archers beside varlettes.

The king followed the duke of Lancastre so fast / that he and all his host came
in to the marches about york: for on the way tidings ca^e to the king / how
that his people that were before / were likely to fight with the scotts in the
marches of Northu^berlande / therefore he made the gretter have. and so the king
ca^e at last to sait Iohn^s of Beuerley in the marches of Dyrhin^ / And there
tidings came to the king / how that the scotts were returned in to their own
country: so all the men of war lodged about in the marches of Northumberland.
Now shall I show you of an adventure that fell in the^glysshe host / whereby
that voyage was broken and mortal war between certain of the lords.

How sir John^ Hollande slew sir Richard Stafforde / and how therle of
Stafforde came to the king to demand justice. Cap. xii.
IN the marches of sait John^ of Beuerley in ye dyoces of york / The king of
England was lodged with a great nombre of earls / barons / and knights / for
every man lay as nere the king as they might / and specially his two uncles /
ser Thomas Holande earl of Lien and sir Johan Holande his brother. In the
kings company there was a knight of Boesme was come to se the queen of
England / and for love of ye queen the king and the lords made him good
chere. His name was sir Miles / he was a fresshe lustye knight after the usage
of Almaygne. And so it fortuned beside a vyllage nere to sait Iohans of
Beuerley / yt there fell words bitwene this knight and two squyers of sir
Johan of Hollandes brother to the king / and to the words there came two
archers of sir Johan Staffordes. The words so multiplied / that the two
archers took part with the stranger / and blamed the two squyers / sayng:
Sirs / yedo wrong to medyll with this knight / for ye know he is belongyng to
the queen / and of her country. ye ought rather to support him than otherwise
Than one of the squyers said: What enuyous knave? Have thou to do though I
blame him for his folly. What have I to do quod the archer? I have right well
to do therewith / for he is companyon to my master / Therefore I will not be in
the place / to suffer him to receive any villainy. yea quod the squire / if I
thought thou would aid him against me / I would put this swerd through thy
body / and made cou^tnau^ce / as though he would have stryken him. The archer
stepped back with his bow / which was ready bente: And set an arowe therein
and drew it up / and shot against the squire that the arowe pearsed
thoroughe body and heart / and so fell down deed. When the other squire saw
his fellow deed he fled away / and sir Miles returned to his lodging. The
two archers went to their master and showed him all the adventure. Sir
Richard Stafforde said / Thou have done right yuell. Sir quod the archer / I
could do none otherwise without I would have been slain my self / and I had
rather have slain him tha^ he should have slain me. Well quod sir Richard /
Go thy way that thou be not found / and I shall entreat for thy peace with
sir Johan of Holande / by my father or by some other. So the archer deperted.

Tidings anon was brought to sir Johan of Holande / that an archer of sir
Richard Staffordes / had slain a squire of his / yt man that he loved best in
all the world / and it was showed him the manner how: And that it was for the
cause of sir Miles the stranger. When sir Johan of Holande was well enfourmed
of this adventure / he was right sore displeased and said. I shall never eat
nor drike till it be revenged. Than he lepte on his horse and took certain of
his men with him / and departed fro his own lodging. It was as than right
late and so rode in to the feldes / and enquered / Where sir Miles was lodged.
It was showed him / he was lodged in the reregarde with the earl of Deuurynters
and therle of Stafforde. Than sir Johan Hollande took the way thither ward /
and sought to find sir Miles: And as he and his men rode up and down among
the hedges and busshes / in a strait way he met at adventure with sir
Richard Stafforde / and because it was night he demanded who was there? I am
quod he Richard Stafforde. And I am Hollande quod the other / and I seek for
the. One of thy servants has slain my best beloved squire: And therewith
drew out his sword and struck Richard Stafforde / so that he slew him and
fell down deed / which was great pytie. So he passed for the and knew not
well what he had done / but he saw well one fall to the ground. Sir Richard
Staffordes men were sore dismayed when they saw their master deed. than they
cried: A Holande Holande / ye have slain the son of therle of Stafforde.
This will be heavy tidings to the father whan^e he knows thereof. Some of sir
Johan of Holandes servants herd well these words / and said to their
master. Sir / ye have slain sir Richard Stafforde. Well quod sir Johan
Hollade / what than? I had leauer have slain him than a worse: The better have
I revenged the death of my squire. Than sir Johan of Hollande went straight to
saint Iohans of Beuerley / and took the fraunchesse of the town and abode
there still / For he knew well there would be much a do in the hooste / for
the death of that knight: And he wist not what the king would say or do in
the matter. So to eschew all paryllce / he took sentuarye in the town of saint
Iohans of Beuerley.

Tidings anon came to the Earl of Stafforde / how his son was slain by
yuell adventure. Thafie the earl demanded who had slain him: And such as
were by him when he was slain said. sir / the kings brother / sir Iohen of
Holande did slay him: And showed him the cause why / and how it was. ye may
well know / that he that loved entierly his son and had no mo but him /
and was a fair young knight and a coutagyous / was marvelously sore
dyspleased / and sent incontinent for all his friends to have their counsel
/ how he should use him self in the reuengynge of his death. The most wysest
man of his counsel said. Sir / to morrow in the morning / show all the
matter to the king / and desire him to have law and justice. Thus they suaged
some what his ire / and so passed that night. And the next morning Richard
Stafforde was buried in the church of the vyllage thereby. And at his buryeng
were all those of his lynage / barons / knights and squyers that were in
army. And the obsequy done / the earl of Stafforde and a three score of his
lygnage mounted on their horses and so came to the king / who was well
informed of that yuell adventure. And so the Earl found the king and his
uncles toguyder / and a great nombre of knights with them. When the earl came
before the king he kneled down / and all weeping / said with a soroufull
heart. Sir / ye are king of England / and have solemly sworn to keep
England in all right / and to do justice. ser / ye know how your brother
without any tytell of reason has slain my son and air. Sir / I require you
do me right and justice / or else ye shall have no worse enemy than I will be.
And sir / I will ye know / the death of my son touches me so nere / that and
it were not for brekynge of this voyage that we be in / I should bring the host
in to such trouble / that with honor it should be amended / and so
cou^teruenged / that it should be spoken of a hundred years hereafter in
England: But as now I will cease till this voyage in to Scotland be done /
for our enemies shall not rejoice of the trouble of the earl of Stafforde. The
king answered. Know for truth that I shall do you justice and reason / as
fatforthe as all my barons will judge. I shall not fail thereof / for no
brother that I have. Than they of the earls lynage said. Sir / ye have said
well / we thank you thereof. Thus the lynage of sir Richard Stafforde was
apeased / and so held on their journey in to Scotland. And all the journey
the earl of Stafforde made no semblant of the death of his son / wherein all
the barons reputed him right sage.

How the king of England caused to be distroyed the church of meurous in
Scotland / and how the barons of Scotland answered the admyrall of France /
and deuyied to leave Scotland / and to let the Englesshe men alone. Cap. xiii.
THus auaunsed forth the king of England with seuyn thousand men of arms
and threscore thousand archers. All the strength of the realm of England was
there: For it was said how the admyrall of France would fight with the^ / and
in deed he had great desire and will so to do / for he said to the barons of
Scotland or they came forth. Sirs / make your sommons to get as much
strength as ye can / for if the English men come in to Scotland / I will
surely fight with the^. The scotts said as than how they were content
therewith / how be it after they took other advise. The king of England
passed forth so fary / that he passed Duresme and New castle on the river of
Tyne / and all the land of Northumberlande: and so at last came to Berwyke /
whereof sir Mathue Redman was captain who received the king joyfully / and
the king tarried not there long / but passed forth over the river of Twede / and
took his lodging at the abbey of Mewrous / the which for all the wars that
had been between England and Scotland had never no hurt nor damage but as
than it was clean brnet and exiled: For it was thentent of the englyssh men not
to return again in to England / till they had distroyed all Scotland /
because they were fortifyed at that time by the french men. Whan^e the
admyrall of France / knew that the king of England was passed the river of
Twede / and was entered in to Morlane in Scotland: Than he said to the barons
of Scotland. Sirs / why do we sytte still? Let us go forth and advise our
enemies and fight with them. It was showed us or we came here that if ye had
out of France but one thousa^de of good men of arms / ye should be strong
enough to fight with the English men. And I ensure you / ye have mo than a
thousa^de and five hundred cror bows. And surely the knights and squyers that
be here in my company ar parfyte men of arms / and the flower of chiualrye /
and will not fly / but abide such adventure as god will send you and them.

TO these words answered the barons of Scotla^de / who knew so well the
puissaunce of the English men / that they had no will to fight with them:
Wherefore they said Sirs / we believe well that ye and your company be chosen men
and of great valor: But sir we have knowledge that all the power of England
is here / there were never so many English men toguyder assembled / as be
now / And ye will / we shall bring you in to such a place / that ye shall
well se and advise them. And thanne if ye counsel that they shall be fought
with all / it shall not be refused by us. For surely sir / all such words as
ye have said we did speak them. A gods name quod the admyrall / let me ones
se the^. And so anon after therle Dugles and other barons of Scotla^de brought
thadmyrall unto a high mountain / and under the hill there was a passage /
whereby the^glysshe host must pass: on this hill was thadmyrall / with diverse
knights of France in his company / And there clearly they saw the English
men and all their puissaunce / and there they nombred them as nere as they could
to be a sire thousand men of arms / and threscore thousand archers and
other. Than all things co^sydred they said how they were not of puyssaunce
suffycient to fight with the Englysshemen / for they passed not a thousand
spears and a.xxx. thousand of all other men / and but yuell armed. Than the
admyrall said to the etle Duglas and to therle Morette. Sirs / ye say but good
reason / though ye have no will to fight with the Englisshe men. Therefore
advise you what ye will do / they are strong enough to over ride all your
country / and to distroy it. And sith ye may not fight with them / I pray
you bring me through your country / by some priuye way in to England if it
may be: and we shall make them war in some other part as they do to us
here. Sir quod the barons / that shall we well do / for we know diverse ways.

TO thus the admyrall and the barons of Scotland determined to forsake
Scotland / and to let the Englyssh men alone / and to go and enter into
Wales / and to go to the city of Carlyle and there to revenge them. So they
left the English men and took the forestes and mountayns / and as they rode
through out Scotland / they distroyed all as they went and brent towns /
vyllages / and manners: and caused all the men / women / and children of the
country to drive all their catayle / and to go into yt wild forestes / for
they knew well the Englisshe men would not follow them thither. And the king
of Scotts went in to the wild scottysshe / because he was not i^ good point
to ride a warfare / and they he tarried all the war during / and let his
men alone. So the French men and Scotts passed the high mountayns / between.
Northumberla^de and Scotland / and entered in to the land of Wales / and began
to brenne villages / and did much hurt in the Mombrayes lands. And the earl
of Notyngham / the earl of Stafforde / and the barone of Grasoppe / and the
Mosgr^ues lands / and so they took the way to the city of Carlyle.

How the king of England took Ede^borowe the chief city of Scotland: and
how the duke of Lancastre was in purpose to return in to wales / to close in
the frenchmen and scotts: and what the french men and the scotts did in the
said country. Cap. xiiii.
THe admyrall of France was the earl of Grant Pre / and the lord of saint
Croix / sir Geffray of Charney / ser Will lyam de Brume / sir James of Boesme /
the lord of Pegny / the lord of He Is / the lord of Marnell / sir Valeran of
Rauenall / the barone D^^ery / the barone of Fountayns / the lord of Croye /
sir Brake of Braquemont / the lord of Landury / and well a thousand speres of
barons and knights of France. And so they and the lords of Scotland rode in
Northu^berlande between the mountayns on the fronters of Wales / brennyng
towns / manners / and countrees: And the king of England and his uncles / with
barons and knights of England and their companyes entered in to Scotland /
and brent and exyled on their part. And so the king came and lodged in
Edenborowe / ye chief town in all Scotland / and there tarried five days /
and at his departing it was set a fire and brent up clean / but the castle had
no hurt / for it was strong enough and well kept. While the king lay at
Edenborowe / thenglysshmen rode abroad in the country and did much / hurt /
but they found another man nor be abroad / for all was withdrawn in to the
forestes. In the English host were mo than a hundred thousa^de men / and
well as many horse / whereof they had need of great prouisyon / and they found
none in Scotland / but out of England there ca^e to the^ great plenty /
both by land and by see. Than the king departed fro Ede^borowe and rode
toward Estruleyn a good town / wherein there was a great abbey of black
monks / and most commonly the kings of Scotland are there buried. The king
lay in the abbey and at their depertyng / abbey and all was brent. Than they
passed the river of Tax / which ronneth to saint Iohn^s town / at the
castle of Strulyn there was a great assaute / but it would not be won: yet
the town and all the lands of the lord Vercy they brent.

THe intent of the duke of Lancastre and of his brethren / was to pass
through Scotland and to pursue the scotts and french men / for, they knew
well they were gone the way to Wales to go to Carlyle: And so they thought to
enclose the^ between England and Scotland / and to fight with them at their
advantage. This purpose they thought verily to hold. Thenglysshe men spredde
abroad in Scotla^de / there was no resystence against the^ for the country was
void of all men of war: they were gone in to England with the admyrall of
France. And so there the Englysshmen brent the town of saint Iohn^s / where
as the river of Tax rynneth / and there is a good haven to sail thens over
all the world / and after they brent the town of Donde. The Englyssh men
spared another abbeys nor minsters but set all on fire. And so they of the
vowarde ran to Bredan / which is a city on the sea side / It is on thentre of
the wild scottysshe / but they did no hurt thereto / how be it they of the
country were right sore afraid. They of that city thought to have assaute /
for they feared leest ye king of England would have come thither / and have
over ron all that country.

THus in likewise as the Englysshemen did in Scotland / so did the french
men and scotts in England / in the marchesse of Northumberlande and Wales.
and they brent a great country as they went out of Northumberlande and entered
in to Wales / which was otherwise called Wynslande / and passed by the lands
of the lords of Graystocke and Clyfforde / and brent in their voyage diverse
great villages / for they were no men of war in that country as than / for
they were all with the king. So they came to the cite of Catlyle in Wales /
which was well closed with gates / walls / and dykes: It was a place that of
ancient time king Arthure loved rightwell / because that there were great
woods / and many deeds of arms there was done. There lay in Carlyle in
garrison sir Jews Clyfforde / brother to sir Wyllm^ Neuell / and with him sir
Thom^s Mosgraue and Dauy Holgraue his son / and sir Dongorsse / and diverse
other of the marchesse and fronters of Wales / for the cytte of Carlyle was
chief city of all that country / and it was need full for good men of war
to be the^: for when the admyrall of France came thither he assailed the city
by great force / the which assaute was cruel and fierce. So thus before the
city there were many noble deeds of arms done.

How the earl of Oxenforde brake the pursuit that the king of England had
thought to have made in to wales after the french men and scotts And how the
king returned the same way that he came / and how the french men and
scotts determined to return again in to Scotla^de. Cap. xv.
THe king of Englandes uncles knew well what way the admyrall of France and
the scotts held / and said how they thought it for ye best to follow them /
and to search till they might find them / and so to fight with them: Saying /
how they could in no wise escape them. In this purpose was the duke of
Lancastre and his brethren / and diverse other of the great barons of England
/ and the most part of the commons of the host. And as than all their
prouisyon was come as well by land as by see / and the king also was agreed
to the same purpose and than on a night the earl of Oxenforde / who was as than
chief of counsel with the king and bare all the rule: the king trusted no
man so much. He turned the king cleue fro his purpose I can not show you for
what cause / but the informed the king as it was known after / and said: sir
What think ye to do? Will ye follow the way that your uncles has counsayled?
Sir know for troth that if ye do so / ye shall never return again. For sir
/ the duke of Lancaster desires none other thing but that ye were deed / that
he might be king. How durst he counsel yor grace to go this winter season in
to a strange country? Sir / I would not counsel you to pass the mou^tayns
of Northumberlande / for there be mo than.xxx. streightes and passages / that
if ye were closed in them / ye should never come out again without danger of
the scotts. Sir / put not your self in to that danger / what soever they
say to you. If the duke of Lancastre will go let him go / and have the
charge thereof / but by my counsel ye / shall not go. Sir / ye have done
enough for this one time. your father was never so far within Scotland /
nor yet King Edward your grant father. Therefore sir / this ought to
content you / and save your own person. ye be young and lusty: And such
there be / that shows you sayre semblant and loves you but l^tell. The king
gave such audyence to the saying of this earl / that it went never out of his
mind / as ye shall herafter.

THe next morning the lords of England and their people / ordered them self
to deperte out of Scotla^de / and to follow their enemies to fight with them:
as it was concluded the night before. Than the duke of Lancastre came to the
king his nephue / not knowing of the trouble and change of his purpose* and
the king being in his malencoly / as soon as he saw him / he said in great
ire. Certesse uncle of Lancaster / ye shall not attain as yet to your intent.
Think you for all your words / yt we will lose our self folisshely? I will
not believe you nor yet your counsel? for I se thereby more damage than profit
/ to us and to our people. For if ye will make this voyage / do it and ye list
/ but as for me I will not: For I will return into England the next way /
and all such as love us will follow us. Than the duke of Lancastre said: Sir /
I shall follow you for ye have never a man in your company / that loves you so
well as I do / and also my brethren And if there be any man will say (except
your person) that I would any thing otherwise than well to you or to your
people / here is my guage to the contrary. So there was none that would speak
any word: And the king held his peace and spoke to other of his servants
of other matters / and orderyng himself to return into England the same way
yt he came / and the duke of Lancaster departed fro the king right sore
troubled in his mind / and returned to his company / and made new ordinance
/ for in the morning they had thought to have followed the frenchmen in to the
marches of Wales / but they did not so for they returned the next way in to
England. Lo / thus ye may se how thetle of Oxe^forde who was great with the
king brake all this voyage / and diverse of the great lords / said that the
king was yuell counsayled / Seeing / that all the prouisyon was come / For they
said they might well have followed the scotts in to Wales / For in their so
doing / they should ever have drawn in to England ward. And some persons
that were weary of pain and travel said / how that all things co^sidred /
they were better to return than to go any further: Saying / how a great
provision must be had to scrue such an host / and how it was yuell to pass
the mountayns that winter season / whereby they said they might rather lose than
win.

THus in his season brake up the journey and army of England: and the king and
his lords returned in to England / the same way they came / but they had
distroyed the most part of the realm of Scotland. These tidings came to
the admyrall of France and to the scotts / than they took counsel what was
best for them to do / and so concluded to return again in to Scotland / for
their vitails began to fail and they were in a poor country / for they had
distroyed the marches of Carlyle / and the lands of the barone of Clyfforde /
the lord Maubray / and the bysshoprike of Carlyle / but the city they could
not win. And the french men said / how they had brent and distroyed in the
bysshorike of Dyrhame and Carlyle / that was better worth than all ye towns
in Scotland. So the frenchmen and scotts returned in to Scotland the same
way they came: And when they came into Scotla^de they found the country
distroyed / but the people of the country did set but little thereby and said
/ how with three or four poles / shortly they would make again their houses /
for they had saved much of their catayle in the forestes: But all that the
french men took they were feign to pay truly therefore / and dear. The
french men were often in great danger / for the scotts and they were at many
debates for vitayle: And the scotes said / how the french men did them more
demage than the English men had done: and when it was demanded of them why
so they answered and said: how the french men as they rode abroad they beat
down and desoyled their corns / as whete barley / and otes: and would not
keep the high ways / but rather ride through the corn. Of which demages /
they said they would have of them a true recompense or they departed out of
Scotland: and said / How they should another have ship nor maryner to pass
the^ over the sea / without their leave and lyce^ce. and diverse other knights
and squyers complained / that their woods were cut down by the french men
to make their lodgings.

How the French lords were in great paryll in Scotla^de / and could not
find the means to pass over the sea: and how they showed therles Duglas and
Morette / the hardness that they found in that country / and what answer
they made to them. Cap. xvi.
When the admyrall and his company were returned in to Scotland / and were
come to Edenborowe / they had endured great pain / and as than they could
find nothing to bye for their money wynes they had but little / and but small
ale or bear / and their bredde was of barley or of otes / and their horses were
deed for hunger and fou^dred for poverty. And when they would have sold the^
they wist not to whom / nor there was none would give the^ one penny / another for
horse nor for harness. The soudyers showed to their capitayns how they were
delte with all / and they knew it right well by experyence of them self: And
their men said / how they could not long endure in that pain: They said that
the realm of Scotland was such a country not to keep an host in winter /
and if they should abide there till somer they should be deed for poverty. And
if they should depart a sonder and search for their lyueng abroad i^ the
country / they douted that the scotts would slay them in their beds. The
admyrall consydred well all these things: and saw clearly how it was likely
to be as they said / how be it he was in purpose to abide there all the
winter / and to send to the french king and to the duke of Burgoyne /
certifyeng them what case they were in / and to have new prouisyon of money
and vitayls / and to make a new fresshe war again the next somer to in
England / how be it he saw well the yuels of the scotts / and consydred the
yell of his people. Than he gave leave to depart / all such as would / but at
their departing was the mischefe / for the lords could find no passage for
themself nor for their men. The scotts would that such knights and squyers
as were but poor should depart / to thentent that they might rule the remnant
at more ease: and said to the admyrall. Sir / let your men depart when they
will / but as for your self / ye shall not depart out of this country / till
we be full satisfied of all such charges as we have borne all this season for
your army.

THese tidings were right hard to the admyrall and to the other barons of
France / and showed all the matter to the earl Duglas and to the earl Morette /
who besemynge were right sore displeased / that they were so hardely dalte with
all / and said: We be right sorry / For this dealing will cause that never
scottysshe knight shall come in to France to have good there. And so these two
earls spoke to the other earls and barons of Scotland / who said / how they
had lost as well as they / wherefore dissymule you with them / for we will be
reco^pensed Than these two earls said to the admyrall and to the other lords
of France / how they could not rule the other lords nor the commons /
Wherefore it behooved them if they purposed to go out of the realm / to satisfy
the commons and to restore again all their domages. And when the admyrall saw
that it would be non otherwise / he thought he would not lose the more for the
less. He consydred well / how he was without conforte and closed in with the sea / and saw how the scotts were of a wild opynion / wherefore they were
feign to agree to the scotts intent and caused a cry to be made / that all
manner of persons should come to the admyrall of France and prove that any of
his men had done the^ any damage / and he would recompense them to the value
thereof / which cry apeased the scotts* and so the admyrall became de^tour to
them all and said / how he would not depart out of Scotla^de till all the
complayna^tes were fully satisfied and paid. Than diverse knights and squiers
had passage and so returned some in to Flanders / and as wind and weder
would briue them / without horse and harness right poor and feeble / cursyng
the day that ever they came in Scotland. Saying / how there were never men
had so hard a voyage, wysshing that the french king had peace with England
one year or two / and so both kings togider to go in to Scotland / utterly
to distroy that realm for ever: For they said / they never saw so yuell people
nor so false traitors / nor more folysshe people in feats of war.

THe admyrall of France by the^ that departed first / wrote letters to the
french king and to the duke of Burgoyne / certifyeng them what case he was in
/ and how the scotts delte with him / and that if they would have him to come
home / they must send thither such so^mes of money as he was become dettoure /
for to be paid to the knights / squyers / and commens of Scotland / for the
scotts said plainly / that the war that they made in to England at that
season / was for France and not for them self. therefore all such domages as
they have taken by that journey / they would be fully recompe^sed again or he
deperted out of scotland / to the which he had sworn and agreed The french
king and his counsel were bound to redeem again the admyrall / for they
send him thither. Than^e the so^mes of money were ordained for / and the money
paid by excha^ge in the town of Bruges / so that the scotts were content.
Than the admyrall departed out of Scotland when all things was paid / and so
took his leave of the king who was in the wild scottysshe / and of the earls
Duglas and Morette / who conueye^ them to the seesyde / and so he took
shyppynge at Edenborowe and had wind at will and arrived at Sluse in
Flanders. Some knights and squyers of his company returned not again with
him / they thought they would se other countrees / and so they went in to
diverse parts. The most part returned in to France so poor / that they
were not able to get the^ self any horse. some bought them horses / and
specially the burgonions / the ca^penoise / the barroise / and the lorayns.

How the admyrall informed the french king and his counsel of the state of
Scotland / and how the duke of Burgoyne had great desire to cause the french
king to make a journey in to England. Cap. xvii.
When the admyrall was returned in to France to the young king Charles and
to ye duke of Burgoyne they made him good chere / as it was reason / and
demanded of him the condycion of the king and of the lords of Scotland: He
said / how the scotts somewhat resembled, the English men / because they be
enuyous over strangers: And moreover he said / that he had rather be earl of
Sauoy or earl of Arthoyse than to be king of scotts / and said / how he had
seen all the power of Scotland in one day to gyder / as the scotts said them
self / and yeche never saw together past five hundred spears and about a.xxx.
thousand other men of war the which nombre against Englisshe archers or
against a thousand of other good men of arms could not long endure. Than the
admyrall was demanded / if he had seen the puyssaunce of England. He answered
yea. For on a day quod he / when I saw the scotts fly away for fear of the
Englysshmen / I desired them to bring me where as I might se and advise the
English host / and so they did / I was set in a strait passage where as
they must needs pass / and to my demyng / they were a.ix thousand men of
war. And the scotts said that it was all the power of England / and that
there were none abydinge behind. Than the king and his counsel studied a
little / and at last said. It is a great thing of threscore thousand archers
and of six or seuyn thousand men of arms. It may well be quod the Constable
that they may make that nombre / but yet I had rather fight with them at home
in their own marches than with half the nombre here / and so I herd my
master say often times when I was young. By my faith quod the admyrall / if
ye had been there with a great nombre of men of arms as I supposed ye should
have be^ I think we had famysshed all Scotland. Thus the constable and
admyrall devised toguyder / and they set the duke of Burgoyne in great desire
to make an army in to England. Now let us leave a little to speak of the^
and return to the business of Flaunders.

IT is of truth / the duke of Burgoyn had ymagined in his mind to make the
next Somer following / which should be in the year of our lord god / a
thousand three hundred fourscore and five / a great army / and to move the
french king as much as he might to go into England. And also the constable
of France / who was an expert knight and well beloved in the realm of France
/ and had been brought up in his youth in the realm of England: He in likewise
gave counsel to the same enterprise / and so did the lord dela T^emoyle.
And because yt the duke of Berrey was in Poictou and Lymosyn / and knew
nothing of this counsel / the duke of Burgoyne who was chief about the
king / he had diverse ymaginacions. he thought well that as long as the war
continued in Flanders / the voyage over the sea in to England / could not
well be done: Wherefore he was more troubled with them of Gaunte / and enclyned
rather to their desires. for he knew well how they were alyed to thenglysshe
men. And how they had in Gaunte a knight of England called sir Johan
Bourchier / sent thither by king Richard to govern the town and to counsel
them: How be it the gauntoyse desired to have peace for they were so ouerlayd
by the war / that the most rich and notablest persons of the town / were
not masters of their own goods for the wild soudyours governed them. And
the wise men saw well / that at length it could not endure / but that they
were all in great parell. And when they were toguyder / diverse of ten times
marueyled / how they had endured so long as they had done: they saw well
it was rather by force than by love / For Peter de Boyse always parceyuered in
his yuell opynions and domages / So that non durst speak before him of peace /
for if he knew any person though he were never so sage that spoke of any
treaty of peace / inco^tynent he was slain and murdered without pytie or
remedy.

THis war that they of Gaunte had maynteyned against their lord therle
Loyes of Flaunders and the Duke of Bourgoyne had / endured a seuyn year /
whereby there was such hurt done / that it were great marueyle to rehearse. The
turks / paynims / and sarasyns sorowed that war: For of truth the
marchaundyses of eightene realms / arrived lightely at Sluse / and had their
delyueraunce at Danne or at Bruges / which was all let by this war. Than
behold and co^sydre if these far perties sorowed this war: Much more
ought to be sorry the lands next adioynynge thereto / and there was none could
find any mean of peace. And so first by the grace of god and divine
inspyracion / and by the humble prayers of good folks / that god opened their
ears / and had pytie of the poor people of Flaunders. And how the peace came
by them I shall show you fro point to point / as I showed you before the
beginning / so shall I declare the ending. The beginning of the hatte was by
John^ de Bare / Johan Piet / Gylbert Mathue / Johan Lion and such other / and
I desire you to harken thereunto.

How by the grace of god two burgesses of Gaunt enteredde to treat with the
duke of Burgoyne for peace: And how they gave the charge thereof to a knight of
Flaunders / and what answer the duke gave unto them. Cap. xviii.
IN this season in the town of Gaunt was sir Johan Bourchyer ruler there under
the king of England / and Peter de Boyse did assyst him and susteygned all
their yuell opinyons. There were some wysemen right sore displeased with the
dysce^cion between their natural lord and the town: how be it they durst not
show forth the ententes of their hearts / but one of them to another as they
durst secretly. For if Peter de Boyse had known that they had made any
^^blant of peace / they should have been slain without mercy. In like manner as he
and Philyppe Dartuell had slain sir Simon Bec^e and sir Gylbert Brute / and to
keep the people of Gau^t in fear: He had caused diverse to be slain in that
season. In that season before or Fraunces Atremau was put out of the town of
Dan by the french king / and had distroyed the country of the four masters
/ and that the king was returned again in to France (as ye have herd
before) They of Gau^t began to dout and the notable men of the town supposed /
yt the next Somer the french king would return again and besiege the
town / but Peter de Boyse and such other of his sect made but light thereof:
Saying / how they would gladly se the king before their town / for they
said / they had such alyaunce with the king of England / that they should
soon be aided and conforted. In this season there was in the town two valyant
men of good life and of good conuersacyon / of a mean lygnage / not of the
best nor of the worst. Which persons were sore displeased to se the discord
between the town and their natural lord / how be it they durst not speak
thereof for fear of Peter de Boyse / One of them was a maryner and the other a
bocher / the one called Roger de Creuyn / and the other Jacques Dardenbourke.

^I these two persons the matter was first set a warke / and with the^ a wise
knight of Flaunders called sir Johan Delle / who took great pain therein: But
he nor all the knights in Flanders could never have brought it to pass / and
it had not ben by the means of these two persons. This knight sir Johan Delle
was well-beloved in the town of Gaunt / and came and went at his pleasure
without any suspection. These two foresaid persons had great displeasure of this
debate^ and spoke privily together thereof: And Roger said to Jacques. Will there
be no remedy found between the town of Gaunte (in the which we were borne /
and is now in a hard case) and the duke of Burgoyn our natural lord? It
were a great alms deed to make a peace^ and they that so could do / should
have thank of god and great praise of the world: for by that means ye
trouble should be ceased for ever, ye say truth quod Jacques: But it is a
hard thing to bring about: for Peter de Boyse is a paryllous man / there is
none dare speak of peace for fear of hi^. Well quod Roger / yet it can not be
always thus / at last it must needs have an end. Show me quod Jacques by what
means it might be / and I will gladly here you. Than quod Roger / ye be the
chief of all the bochery / and most beloved and dradde. ye might secretly
show your courage and intent to them that be your fre^des / and as ye se how
they enclyne / ye may speak further little and little. And on the other side /
I that am a maryner and beloved with all manner of men. and I know some of
their corages how that the war displeases them / for they have great damage
thereby. And I shall show my mind to some / who shall draw other to ye same
purpose. And if we may get these two crafts of our accord / the other
crafts and other good people such as desires peace / wyllnsone euclyne to
us. Well quod Jacques / and I shall speak gladly to the^ of my craft / and
speak you to yours. And as they devised so it was done / right secretly and
wisely / so that by the grace of the Holygost / Jacques Dardenboure found all
tho of the bochery well enclyned to his will And Roger on his part by means of
his fair language / found the maryners right well agreed thereto / for their
craft was nere lost for lack of usage.

Hus these two wise men showed each to other / how they found their people
disposed to have peace. Than they said / how they must have some other sage
person to show all this matter to their lord. At last they remembered them of
a knight called sir Johan Dell / and so they went to him and discovered to him
all their ententes secretly / and said. Sir / we have labored so much to the^
of our crafts / that they be well enclyned to have peace / so that our lord
the duke of burgoyn would pardon them / and to grant us our au^cyent
fraunchesses / according to the tenours of our charters and bulls. Than this
sir Johan said / I shall gladly go and entreat him. And so this knight went
out of the town to ye duke / who was in France with the king / and he showed
him all the forsaid matter / and did so much with his fair langage / that the
duke enclyned to here what he would say: And for the desire that the duke had
to make a voyage in to England / the lightlyer he condiscended to have peace
with them of Gaunt: And also his counsel sir Guy de la Tremoyle and sir Johan
de Vyen / and the constable and the lord Coucy / counsayled him to take peace
with the^: than the duke answered and said to sir John^ Delle I am content to
do in this matter as ye will deuyse / and so return ye again to the^ that
sent you hyder: And the duke demanded of him / if Fraunces Atreman were a
counsel of this treaty or not. Sir quod he / I think he knows nothing
thereof / he keeps the Castle of Gaure / and I know not if they that sent me
hider / would that he should know it or not. Tell the^ quod the duke that they
speak hardely with him in the matter / for I think he will not be against me /
for as I understand he desires greatly to be at peace with me. as the duke
commanded so this knight did / and returned to Gaunt and brought these good
tidings. And than he went to the castle of Gaure to speak with Fraunces
Atreman / and discovered all his intent secretly to him. And when Fraunces had
a little studied / merely he said. And if my lord the duke will pardon them of
Gaunt and uphold their frauncheses / I shall not be rebel against him but be
right diligent to have peace. Than this knight departed fro him and went again
in to France to the duke / and showed him all the matter. The duke herd him
gladly / and wrote letters open and close sealed with his seal / to the^ of
Gau^te. And this knight with those letters returned in to Flaunders / and so
came to Gau^t / but he showed not the letters as than / but he promised Roger
and Jacques to acco^plysshe their ententes. Behold now what perell this knight
and they were in: For if sir Johan Bourchier and Peter de Boyse had known of
the matter all the world should not have saved their lives.

How these two foresaid burgesses assembled their friends to accomplysshe
their enterprise / and sent sir Johan Delle for the dukes letters of peace.
Cap. xix.
THan^e Roger and Jacques said to sir John^ Dell / Sir / ye shall come on monday
next coming in to this town at nine of the clock / and bring with you the
dukes letters / and show them openly to the commons of Gaunte / whereby they
shall give the more credence / for by that hour / we will be lords of the
town / or else slain in the quarrel. Well quod sir Johan / be it as ye say:
and so ended their counsel for that time And sir Johan Delle went out of the
town to accomplysshe his purpose. These other two wysemen studied how to
bring about their purpose / and so spoke with some of their friends and
aldermen of the crafts / so that they had a great nombre of their accord: And
determined that on the next monday at nine of the clock / they should depart
out of their houses / with the banner of Flanders before them: Cryeng the Lion
of Flanders / the lord of the country / has given peace to the good town
of Gaunte / and has pardoned clearly all trespasses. For all this matter was
sagely ha^deled yet it came to the knowledge of Peter de Boise. And as soon as
he knew thereof / he went straight to sir Johan Bourchyer / who was soueraygne
captain there under the king of England / and said to him: Roger Creuyn and
Jacques Darde^bourke / will be to morrow by nine of the clock in the market
place / with the banner of Flaunders before them: And they will cry through
the town / the Lion of Flanders lord of this country / has given peace to
the town of Gaunte / and has perdoned all trespasses. What shall we do? The
king of England shall not be than^e obeyed / without we prevent them / and
put them out of our iurysdyctions. What is best than to do quod sir Johan
Bourchier? Than answered Peter and said. It behooves / that to morrow in the
morning / we assemble in harnes all our men in the house de la Vale: And than
let us go through the town with the king of Englandes baner before us / and
let us cry also: The Lion of Flaunders king of England / lord of this
country and town of Gaunte. And when we come in to the market place / such
as be on our party will draw to us / and than let us flee all the other
treatours. It is well devised quod sir Johan Bourchier / let it so be done.

Now behold / if god did not much for these two / Roger and Jacques: For
they were enfourmed of Peter de Boyse deuyse. and when they knew it they were
not abashed: But late in the evening they sent to all their friends / that
where as they should be the next day in the market place by eight of the
cloak / in any wise they desired them to be there by seuyn of the clock / and
that they did to prevent Peter de Boyse. To this poyntment every man was
agreed / and on the monday in the morning sir Johan Bourchyer and his company
came to the house called de la Vale / and with him a threscore / and Peter de
Boyse came thither with a xl. there they armed the^ / and in good ordinance
set them self forward. And Roger and Jacques assembled their friends together
/ and the most part of the aldermen and burgesses of Gaunt came to them. Than
they took the earls baner and went through the town / cryeng the foresaid cry
/ and such as herd the cry / and saw the aldermen of their crafts and the
baners of the earl / they followed after and came to the same company: And so by
seuyn of the clock they came to the market place / and there set the^ self in
good order / with therles baners before them / and ever there came mo and mo to
them. These tidings came anon to sir John Bourchier and to Peter de Boyse /
who were assemblynge of their people. Than they went forth with the baners of
England before them / and as they went / they cried their cries before
devised. And so they came to the said market place / and there araynged them
self before the other / but ever such as came / the most part went to the
Earls baners / so that if a hundred came fourscore went thither: In so much /
that all the place was full of men of arms / and so they stood each regardyng
other.

When Peter de Boyse / saw how the aldermen of the crafts drew to Roger and
Jacques he was sore abashed and douted greatly of his life: For he saw such
as were wont to serve him / fly away fro him: and so privily he stale away
out of the prease / and hid him self for fear of death. And when Roger and
Jacques saw yt / nighe all the people drew to their part / they were right
ioyouse and well comforted / and not without good cause: For than they saw
well / that the people of Gaunt would be in peace with their lord / Than they
departed with a certain of their company / with the baners of Flaunders before
them / and so came to sir Johan Bourchyer and to the Englysshemen / who were
not very sure of their lives / when they saw them come toward them. Than
Roger demanded of sir Johan Bourchier / where Peter de boyse was and what was
his intent / and whyder he was their friend or enemy. The knight answered and
said. I think Peter de Boyse be here by me / and when he saw that he was gone
/ he said. I know not where he is become: I went he had been in my company. But
as for me / I am and will be servant to my natural lord the king of England
/ who send me hyder at your own desires / if ye well remember. It is true
quod they / for if ye had not ben desired to come hyder by the town of Gaunte
/ ye should have been slain. But for the honor of the king of England who
send you hyder at our request / ye shall not need to fear nor non of yo^s ye
shall have no hurt. We shall save you from all domages / and conducte you to
the town of Calayes: Wherefore depart to your lodgings peasably / and ^lyrre
not for any thing ye here or se / For we will be under the obeysau^ce of our
natural lord the duke of Burgoyne / and will make no more war. The knight
was right Ioyouse of that answer to be so quyte / and said. Sir / sithe it
will be none otherwise so be it: and I thank you of that ye offer me at this
time.

How sir Johan Dell came to gau^t to the markette place: where as Roger and
Jacques and the aldermen of the city: where and how he delivered them letters
fro the duke of Burgoyne: and how they of Gaunt sent to Turney / and of the
confyrmacion of the peace and of the charters that were made thereof. Cap. xx.
THan sir Johan Bourchier departed peasably fro the place with all thenglissh
men / and such Gauntoyse as were in his Company fled away and hid the^
self. And anon after entered in to the town sir Johan Delle / and came in to
the market place with the dukes letters / send thither by the duke: And there
they were opyned and reed to all the people / which gretlye pleased them.
Than Fraunces Atreman was sent for fro the castle of Gaure / who inco^tynent
came to them and agreed to the treaty / and said it was well: And so thereupon
sir Johan Delle was sent again to the duke / who was as than at Arras / and
showed him all the demeanor of the gauntoyse: And how that Peter de Boyse had
as than no rule nor audyence in the town: and how that if he had been found
he had been slain: and how that Frau^ces Atreman did acquyte him self
valya^tly and confyrmable to the Peace. All these things pleased much the
duke: and so he sealed a charter of peace and a truse to endure / until the
first day of Ianuarye / and in the mean season a counsel to be had for that
matter in the city of Tourney / And all the sir John^ Delle brought again
with him to Gaunte / whereof all the people had great joy / For they showed
than how they had great desire to have peace All this season sir Johan Bowser
and the English men and Peter de Boyse were still in Gaunte / but there was
no man would do any thing after them: and Peter de Boyse lived still in rest.
With that he swear that he should not procure nor move any thing that should
cause any war between the town and their natural lord. And thus was done
by the means of Fraunces Atreman who spoke for him whereby Peter lived in rest
/ for they knew well that Peter always held with their opynions / and was a
true and a good captain.

THis truce during / they of Gau^te appointed them that should go to Tourney
to conclude this treaty / And Frau^ces Atreman was sent thither as chief /
because he was a man reasonable and well known with all lords / and with him
went Roger Creuyn and Jacques Darde^bourke / and they came to Turney in the
vtas of saint Andrewe with a fyftie horse / and were all lodged toguyder at the
sign of the Samon / in the street of saint Brise And the.v. day of Decembre /
thither came the duke of Burgoyne and the duchess his wife / and the lady of
Neuers their daughter / and they entered into Turney at the gate toward Lyle
And against their entering the gau^toyse that were there issued out to mete
with them. And when they saw the duke / they enclyned them self on their
horses bare heeded: And the duke passed lightely by them / for he made haste
to mere with the duchess of Brabante / who was coming to the city by the
gate of Malynes / and she was lodged in the bysshoppes palace. So thus began
the treaty between the Duke and the town of Gaunt / and sir Johan Delle took
great pain to go and come between the perties / and at the desire of the
duches of Bourgoyne and of the lady Neuers / the duke forgave all his yuell
will: And the peace was made / cried / accorded / written / and sealed between
the parties / in manner as follows.

Here after ensues the tenoure of the letters and charters of peace.
PHilyppe the son of Frau^ces duke of Burgoyn earl of Flaunders / Artoyse /
and Palatyne / lord of Selynes / earl of Rethell and Malynes / and Margarete
duchess and countess of the said cositreis. To all them that heateth or seyth
this present writynge / we send gretynge. We will that it be known / that
our well-beloved subjects / aldermen and commons of our good town of Gaunte /
has right humbly required our lord the king and us / that we should have
pytie and mercy on them / and to pardone all offenses by them or any for them
done to the king or to us / and for pytie and compassyon of our said subjects
by our letters / we have pardoned the^. And also we have confyrmed their
ancient priuyleges / frauncheses / customs / and usage / in case that they
will plainly obey the king and us. Which pardone they of Gaunte and their
part takers / have received right humbly by such letters and messa^gers as
they sent to us in great nombre to Turney / and they have clean tenounsed all
debates and wars / and with good hearts are returned to true obeysau^ce to
the king and to us. Promysyng from hens forth to be true friends and faith
full to the king and to us / to the king as their soueraygne lord / and to us
as their natural lord / by reason of Margarete our wife as their natural
lady and heretour. Wherefore the king and we have received to our grace our
said subjects / and have given them letters of perdon and pure remyssion /
with restytucyon of their priuyleges / customs / and vsages / the which more
at large appears / by the content of our letters. After which pardons our
said subjects have made to us diverse supplycacions / the which we have
received and have caused them by good delyberacyon to be seen / vysited / and
examyned / by our counsel / the which well seen / and for the common profit
of all the country / and to eschew all disce^sions that herafter might fall. of
our special grace / and by the conte^placion of our good subjects / we have
ordered and determined in manner as follows. First where as they desire that we
should confyrme their ancient privileges of Tourney / Danduarde / Grauntmont /
Meule Teremounde / Ruplemount / Abste / Atharcle / Breuelies / Douse and of the
Chateleyns / and plain country / parteyning to the same towns. We have
ordained that the inhabytau^tes of the said towns should come to us / bri^gyng
with them their priuyleges / which shall be seen by our counsel: And that done
/ we shall so do that our said subjects of Gau^t and they of the said good
towns / shall by reason hold them content. And if any of the said priuyleges
be lost by any case / fortune / or otherwise / we shall make good reformacion
thereof. Also where as they have desired for the course of marchaundyse / we
have consented / that they have all their ancient course payeng their custom
of old time contynewed. Also where as they desire / that if any of the
inhabytauntes of our town of Gaunt / or any of their adherentes / hap to be
arrested in time to come in any country / out of the country of Flaunders /

cause them to be released / and to live in rest. And in that case / we have
granted / that if any of them be arrested for yt cause / We shall aid /
conforte / and defend them with our power / against any that so should trouble
them / as we be bound to defend our good and true subjects. Also they
require / that all such prisoners as we have / which were of their pertie /
that they should be delivered. We have ordained and do ordain / that all such
prisoners / if they be put to their rau^some / that they pay their ransom
and be delivered / payeng also their reasonable expenses / So that if any of
these prisoners or their friends or kynne / have in their hands any fortresses
of ours keeping it against us / First that they deliver such forteresses in to
our hands / and also in likewise / that they deliver all such prisoners as
they have in their hands.

Moreover by our habundant grace / we have ordained and do ordain / that all

AFter the making of these present letters and charters of peace / and engrosed
and Sealed they were publysshed / and the duke had the one part of them / and
the town of Gaunt the other part. Than Frau^ces Atreman and the commons of
the town of Gau^t being there / took their leave humbly of the duke and of the
duchess / and also of the lady of Braba^t / Thankyng her a thousand times of
her aid and help / in making of their peace / and offered them self ever to
be ready to do her service The good lady thanked the^ right swetely / and
exhorted them ever to keep fermely the peace / and so to stir ye people /
that they never rebel against their lord and lady: So than every body
departed and went home to their own. The duke and duches returned to Lyle /
and they of Gaunt returned to their town. When Peter de Boise saw the sure
confyrmacion of the peace / and that all the people of Gaunt had great joy
thereof / and were in mind and will never to rebel more nor to have war / he
was thereof greatly abashed / and had diverse ymaginacyons / Wheder he should
abide stylle in Gaunte (for all things was pardoned by the dukes charter
sealed with his seal) or else to depart in to England with sir Johan
Bourchier and with the English men / who apparelled them to go. And all
things consydred / he thought in him self / that he could not trust this
peace nor to abide in Gaunte. And when Fraunces Atreman saw that he would not
abide / he said to him: Peter / what think ye to do? Why do ye fear? ye know
well / that by this treaty sealed by ye duke that for any thing that is past /
there shall never challenge be made to you for that. Than Peter answered and
said. yea. in letters written lies not all true perdons. Some pardons well
by mouth and gives writing thereof / but yet the hatered remains still in
their corages: As for me I am a man of the town of Gaunt of small reputacion /
and of base lynage / and to my power I have sustained the rightes / lyberties /
and fra^cheses of the town. Think you that wtin this two or three year the
people will remember it? I fear nay: There be great lygnages in the town of
Gylbert Mathewes and his brethren / They will return and they were enemies
to my master Johan Leon / gladly I would never se them / nor the parents of
sir Gylbert Brute nor of sir Simon / Becte / who were by me slain / wherefore
in this case I can not be sure of my life. And as for you Fraunces Atreman will
you abide among such a sort of treatours / who have so falsely broken their
oath and promise to the king of England? I swear to you truly ye will
repent it / for it will cost you your life. I can not say quod Fraunces /
but I trust so well in this peace / and in the duke and duchesses promise /
that I will ieoparde to abide.

THan Peter de Boyse made a request to the aldermen and counsel of the town:
Saying / Fair lords / to my power I have truly served the town of Gau^t and
have been in many an hard adventure in that be half. And for all the good
service that I have done / In the name of reward / I ask none other thing /
but that I may be sauely conducted with sir Johan Bourchier / whom ye send
in to England: This is all that I demand. And they all answered / it should
be done. And as for sir Roger Emeryne and Jacques Dardenbourcke / by whom this
treaty was first moved / they were right glad of his departure / and so
were diverse other notable persons in Gaunt / such as loved the peace. So thus
Peter de Boyse departed from Gaunte in the company of sir Johan Bourchier /
and took with him all the substance that he had: He was well furnysshed of
gold / silver / and ieowelles. And sir Johan Delle did conducte them under
the dukes salve conducte to the town of Calais / and than the gauntoise
returned. Sir Johan Bourchier and Peter de Boyse as soon as they might they
went in to England / and came to the king and to his uncles / and showed them
the deeds of them of Gaunte. The king made Peter de Boyse good chere / and so
did the duke of Lancastre and his brethren / and gave him great thank in
that he was come to them / and had abandoned them of Gaunte to come in to
England. The king incontinent retaygned him and gave him an hundred mark
sterlynge / yearly to be paid out of the Staple of the wolles in London. Thus
Peter de Boyse abode still in England / and the good town of Gaunt in peace
And sir Roger Emeryn was made chief alder man of the flete of Gaunt / which
was a good office and of great profit / when the ships might have their
course with marchaundyse: And sir Jacques Darde^bourc was made chief ruler of
all the mean Crafts in the town of Gaunte / which also was a great and a
profitable office.

How sir John^ Froyssart auctour of this cronycle / departed out of France
and went to the earl of Foiz / and the manner of his voyage. Cap. xxi.
IT is long now since I made any mention of the busynesses of far Countries
/ for the busynesses nerer home has been so fresshe that I lafte all other
matters to write thereof: How be it all this season valyant men desyring to
auau^ce them self on the realm of Castle and Portyngale: In Gascoyne / in
Rouergue / in Quercy / in Lymosyn / and in Bygore: Every day they ymagined / by
what subteltie they could get one of another by deeds of arms / or by
stealyng of towns / castles / and fortresses. And therefore I John^ Froyssart /
who have taken on me to cronycle this present history / at the req^st of the
high renomed prince sir Guy of Chatellon earl of Bloyse / lord of Dauesnes /
Beauuoys / Destonhon / and of la Guede / my sovereign master and good lord.
Co^sydring in my self / how there was no great deeds of arms likely toward
in the parties of Picardy or Flanders / Seeing the peace was made between the
duke and them of Gaunt. And it greatly anoyed me to be ydell / for I knew well
that after my death this noble and high history should have his course /
wherein diverse noble men should have great pleasure and delight. And as yet / I
thank god I have understanding and remembrance of all things passed / and my
wit quick and sharp enough to conceive all things showed unto me / touching
my princypall matter / and my body as yet able to endure and to suffer pain.
All things co^sydred / I thought I would not let to pursue my said first
purpose. And to ^^tent to know the truth of deeds done in (...) countrie^/ I
found occasion to go to the ^^ghe and mighty prince Gascone earl of Foiz and
of Byerne / for I knew well yt if I might have that grace to come in to his
house and to be there / at leysar I could not be so well informed to my purpose
/ in none other place of the world for thither resorted all manner of knights
and strange squyers / for the great noblenes of the said earl / and as I
ymagined so I did / And showed to my redoubted lord the Earl of Bloyes mine
intent / and he gave me letters of reco^mendacions to therle of Foiz. And so
rong I tode without parell or damage that I ca^e to his house called Ortaise /
in the country of Berne on saint Katheryns day / the year of grace.M. three
hundred fourscore and eight. And the said earl as soon as he saw me / he made
me good chere and smylyng said / how he knew me / and yet he never saw me
before / but he had often herd spekyng of me / and so he retained me in his
house to my great ease / with the help of the letters of credence that I
brought unto him / so that I might tarry there at my pleasure. and there I was
enfourmed of the business of the realms of Castyle / Portyngale / Nauar / and
Aragon / yea and of the realm of England / and country of Burbonoyse and
Galcoyne. And the earl him self if I did demand any thing of him he did
show me all that he knew / Saying to me how thy story that I had begone
should hereafter be more praised than any other / and the reason he said why /
was this. How that.l. year passed / there had been done more marvelous deeds
of arms in the world / than in three hundred year before that. Thus was I in
the court of the earl of Foiz / well cherysshed and at my pleasure / it was the
thing that I most desired to knew news / as touching my matter. And I had at
my will lords / knights / and squiers ever to inform me / and also the
gentle earl him self. I shall now declare in fair langage all that I was
enfourmed of / to increase thereby my matter / and to give ensample to the^ that
list to auaunce them self. Here before I have recounted great deeds of arms
/ taking and sautynge towns and castelles / and batayles and hard
encountrynges / and yet here after ye shall here of many mo / the which by the
grace of god I shall make just narracion.

ye have herd here before / that when the lord Edmonde / son to the king
of England earl of Cambridge / was deerted fro the realm of Portingale and
had take shypping at Lustbourke / and how he had made c^u^nant that Johan to
recover our heritage. So thus we become byder / paradue^ture not so many as ye
wrote for: but such as I have here be of such good wylles / that they dare
well abide the adventure of battle against all those yt be now present with
the earl of Tryslmate / and surely we shall not be content with you without we
have battle. Such words or like / the Earl of Cambridge showed to the king
of Portingale or he departed / the which king herd the^ well / how be it he
never durst give battle on the plain of Saluence / whafic he was before the
spaynierdes / nor they of the country would not give him counsel thereto / but
said to him. Sir / the puyssaunce of the king of Castle is as now so great /
and that by fortune or mysad ^enture that ye lose the ^elde / ye lose than
your realm for ever. Wherefore it were better ye suffered than to do a thing
whereby ye should have damage and parell. And when the earl of Cambridge saw it
would be none otherwise / Here turned to Lusenborne and aparelled his ships
and took leave of the king of Portyngale / and so took the sea with his company
/ and would not leave Johan his son in Portingale with the king / nor with
the lady that he should mary with all: The child was but young / and so thus
the earl reteurned in to England. Thus was the dealyng as than of the journey
in Portyngale.

THe earl of Cambridge returned in to England on the manner as ye have her de
before, and showed his brother the Duke of Lancastre all the dealing of king
Ferant of Portyngale. The duke was sorry thereof, for he saw thereby that his
conquest of Castle was far of / and also king Richard of England had
abouth him c^u^sayle that were not after his apetyte / and specially the^le of
Or^forde / who was chief in the kings favor. This earl did set as great
trouble between the king and his uncles as he might / and said oftentimes to
the king. sir / ^fye will follow the minds of your uncles the duke of
Lancastre and the crle of Cambridge / it shall well cost all the treasure in
England about their war in Spain / and yet they shall ce^quere nothing. It
were better for you to keep your own people and your money than to spend it
abroad where as ye can get no profit / and keep and defend your own he
rytage / wherein ye have war^e on all sides / as well by France as by Scotland
/ rather than to enploy your time in other countries. The young king enclyned
lightely to his words / for he loved him with all his heart because they had
been norisshed up toguyder. And this earl had great alyaunces / with diverse
lords and knights of England / for he did all his matters by the counsel
of sir Simon Burle / sir Robert Treuelyen / ser Nicholas Brambre / sir Johan
Beauchampe / sir Johan Salisbury / and sir Mychaell de la pole. And also sir
Thomas Tryuet and sir Wylliam Helmon / were named to be of the same perte / so
that by the dyffernes and discord bitwene the king and his uncles / and the
nobles and commons of the realm / many yuels came thereby in England / as ye
shall here hereafter in this history.

IT was not long after that the earl of Cambridge departed out of Portyngale /
but that the king Feraunt fell sick / and so continued a hole year and dyed.
and than he had no mo children but the Queen of Spain. Than king Johan of
Castle was informed of his death / and how that the realm of Portyngale was
fallen in to his hands / and how that he was ryghtfull heir thereunto / by
reason of the death of the king. Sother was diverse cou^sayls kept on that
matter / and some said / how that the Portingales were so hard hearted people /
yt they would not be had without it were by conquest. And in deed when the
portyngales saw how they were without a king than they determined by
counsel to send to a bastard brother of the kings / a sage and a valyant
man called Deuyse / but he was a man of relygton / and was master of the
hospytals in all the realm / They said they had rather be under the rule of
this master Denyse than under the rule of the king of Castle / for they
reputed him no bastard / that has good courage to do well. When this master
Denyse understood the co^mens will of four chief cities of Portyngale (for
they had great affectyon to crown him king) whereof he had great joy / and
so wrote secretly to his friends and came to Lurbone / which is the kay of
the realm. The people of the town received him with great joy and demanded
of him / if they crowned him king: wheder he would be good to the^ or not / and
keep the land in their fraunchese. And he answered and said / he would be to
the^ as they desired / and that they had never a better king than he would be.
Than they of Luxbone wrote to Connubres / to Pount de portugale / and to them
of Dourke: These were the kayes of the Realm / and so they determined to
crown to their king this master Denyse / who was a sage and a valyant man and
of good governance / and was brother to king Ferant for they saw well the
realm could not be long without a king / as well for fear of the spay mardes
as of the myscrea^tes of Granado and of Bongie / who marched on them. So these
said towns and certain of the lords of the land inclined to him / but some
of ye lords said that it was not mete a bastard to be crowned king: And the
people of the good towns said that it should be so: for of necessyte they must
so do / sith they had none other / and seeing that he was a valyant and a sage
man / both in wy^te and in deeds of arms. And they took ensample by king
Henry / who was crowned king of Castle by electyon of the country / and for
the common profit / and that was done king Peter being a live. So thus the
electyon abode on this master Denyse / and solemynely he was crowned in the
Cathedral church of Connubres / by the accord and puyssaunce of the commons
of the realm. And there he swear to keep justice and to do right to his people
/ and to keep and maynteyne their frauncheses / and to live and dye with them /
whereof they had great joy.

When these tidings came to the hearing of don Johan king of Castle / he was
sore displeased therewith / and for two causes. The one was because his wife was
enheryter there / and the other because the people by election had crowned
master Denyse king there. Wherefore this king Johan took tytell to make war
and to demand of them of Luxbone the so^me of two hundred thousand florens /
which Ferant promised him when he took his daughter to his wife. So than he
send the Earl of Term / therle of Ribydea / and the bishop of Burges in to
Portyngale / as his ambassadors to them of Luxbone. and when they were at
saint prayne / the last town of Castle toward Luxbone: Than they sent an
haraulde to the king and to them of Luxbone / to have a save conducte to go and
come and to furnysshe their voyage / which was granted lightly / and so they
came to Luxbone / and so the town assembled their counsel toguyder / and the
ambassadors showed why they were come thither / and finally said. ye sirs of
Luxbone / ye ought justly not to marueyle / if the king our sovereign lord
demands of you the so^me of money that ye are bound for: And is not content
that ye have given ye noble crown of Portyngale to a clerk a man of relygion
and a bastard: It is a thing not to be suffered / for by rightful election /
there is non nerer to ye crown tha^ he: And also / ye have done this without
the assent of the nobles of the realm. Wherefore the king our master says /
that ye have done yuell. And without that ye shortly do remedy the make / he
will make you sharp war^. To the which words don Feraunt Gallopes de vile
fois / a notable burgess of the cite / answered and said. Sirs / ye reproach
us greatly for our electyon but your own election is as much reprouable / for
ye crowned in Spaygne a bastard / son to a jew: And it is clearly known,
that to the ryghtfull election / your king has no right to the realem of
Portyngale / for the right rests in the daughters of king Peter / who be in
England married / both Constau^ce and Isabell / married to the duke of I an
castre and to therle of Cambridge. Wherefore sers / ye may depart when ye will
/ and return to them that sent you hyder / and say that our electyon is good
/ which we will keep / and other king we will have none / as long as he list
to be our king. And as for ye so^me of money that ye demand of us / we say we
are nothing bound thereto / take it of them that were bound therefore / and of
such as had the profit thereof. At this answer the king of Portyngall was
not present^ howbeit he knew well what should be said. And wha^ these
ambassadors saw they could have non other answer / they took their leave and
departed / and returned to Cyuell / where they lafte the king and his
counsel / to whom they showed all the said answer. Than the king of Spain
took counsel what was best to do in this matter. Than it was determined that
the king of Portyngale should be desied / and how that the king of Spain had
a good quarrel to move the war for diverse reasons. So than king Denyse was
defied and all his helpers in Portyngale. Than the king of Spain made a great
so^mons of men of war^ to lay siege to the city of Luxbone / and the king said
/ he would never depart thens till he had it / for they had answered him so
proudely / that they should derely repent it / if he might ouerco^e them. Thus
the king of Castle with all his puissau^ce came to saint yrayne. At yt season
there was a knight chased ^ut of his court / who was called sir Nauret / For if
the king might have get him / it should have cost him his h^ed. the knight
had knowledge thereof / for he had many good friends. So he avoided the Realm
of Castle and came to Luxbone to the king of Portyngale / who had great joy
of his coming / and retained him and made him a great captain / and he did
after much hurt to the spayniardes. The king of Castle departed fro saint
yrayne / and came and laid siege before the city of Luxbone / and enclosed
therein the king of Portyngale. The siege endured more than a hole year / and
constable of the host was the earl of Longueuyll / and Marshall of the host
was sir Raynolde Lymosyn / he was a knight of Limosyn / who long before came in
to Spaygne with sir Bertram of Clesquy in the first wars that he made in
Spaygne. This sir Raynolde was a valiant knight and well proved / And the king
had well married him to a fair lady / and to a fair heritage: And by her he
had two sons Raynolde and Henry. And he was greatly praised in the realm of
Castle for his prowes / and with the king of Castle there was Dagheynes
Mandake / sir Dygo Persement / don Peter Roseament / don Maryche de Versaulx
portugaleys / who were turned spaynisshe / and the great master of Calestrane
and his brother / a young knight called don Dighemeres / Pier Goussart of selme
/ Johan Radigo de Hoyes / and the great master of saint Jacques. The king had
well with him a thyrtie thousand men. There were diverse assautes and
scrimysshes / and many feats of arms done / on the one part and on the
other. The spaygnierdes knew well that the king of Portyngale should have
none aid of the nobles of his realm, for the commons had made him king
against their wylles. So the king of Castle had intensyon to co^quere Luxbone
and all the country / or he returned / for he saw well they should have none
aid without it were out of England / whereof he had most doubt. And yet when
he had well ymagined* he saw well the English men were far of / and he had
herd how they king of England and his uncles were not all of the best
acorde. wherefore he thought him self the more of sur^tie at his siege / which
siege was right plentyfull of all things. There was in no market in Castle
more plenty than was there. And the king of Portyngale lay still in the city
of Luxbone at his case / for they could not take the Sea fro him. And he
deimyned to send in to England to the king and to the duke of Lancastre
trusty ambassadors / to renew the aliances made before / between the king
and king Ferant his brother: And also the ambassadors had in charge to show
the duke of Lancastre / that in marriage he would gladly have his daughter
Philyppe / and to make her queen of Portyngale / and to swear and seal a
perpetual peace and alyance between them: And also promising him (that if he
would come thither with two or three thousa^de men of war / and as many
archers) to help and aid him to co^quere his enherytaunce of Castle. On this
message was appointed two knights / sir Johan Rade go and sir John^ Tetedore /
and an archedeaken of Luxbone / called March de la Fugyre. So they made them
ready and took the sea and had good wind / and so sailed toward the fronters
of England. On the other perte the king of Castle lay a siege / and he was
counsayled to write in to France and in to Gascoyne / for some aid of
knights and squyers. for the spaynierdes supposed well / that the king of
Portyngale had send for socoure in to England / to reyse their siege: and
they thought they would not be so taken / but that their puissau^ce might be
strong enough to resyst the Englysshmen and portugaleyse. And as he was
counsayled so he did / and send letters and messangers in to France / to
diverse knights and squyers / such as desired deeds of arms / and specially
in the country of By^rne in the county of Foiz / for there were plenty of
good knights desyring deeds of arms: For though they had been brought up with
the earl of Foiz / as than there was good peace bitwene him and therle of
Armynake. So these messages of these two kings were not sone brought about /
how be it the wars in other places ceased nevertheless as in Auuergne / in
Tholousyn / in Rouergue / and in the land of Bygore. Now let us leave to
speak of the business of Portyngale a little / and speak of other matters.

How the prince of wales and the princes came to Tarbe / and of the request
that the countess of Armynake made to the prince and princess: and how the
country of Gascoyne was newly again in war. Cap.xxii.
BItwene the county of foiz and the country of Bierne / lies the cou^tie of
Bigore / which county perteyned to France / and marchesed on the country of
Tholousin on the one part / and on the county of Con^uges and of Bierne on
the other part. And in the county of Bygore lies the strong castle of
Lourde / which was english ever sithe that the county of Bigore was yielded
to the king of England and to the prince / for the redemption of king Johan of
France / by the treaty and peace made at Bertigny before Charters / and after
confyrmed at Calais / as it has been showed before in ye other history. When
the prince of Wales was come out of England / and that the king his father bad
given him in heritage / all the land and duchy of Acqustayne / wherein there
were two archebisshoppes and.xxii. other bysshoppes / and that he was come to
Burdea^x on the river of Gyrone / and had taken the possessyo^s of all these
lands and lain there a year. Than he and the princess were desired by the
earl Johan of Armynake / that they would come in to the country of Bigore / in
to the city of Tarbe to se that country which as than he had not seen before.
And the earl of Armynake thought that if the prince and princess were in
Bygore / that the Earl of Foiz would come and se them: and where as he did owe
him for his ransom two hundred and fyftie thousand frankes / he thought he
would desire the prince and princess to require the earl of Foiz / to forgive
him the same so^me or part thereof. So much did the earl of Armynake that at
his instance / the prince and princes ca^e to the city of Tarbe. This town is
fair and stands in a plain country / among the fair vynes: And it is a
town / city / and castle / closed with gates and walls / and separated each
fro other. Fro the mountayns of Byerne and Catheloyne comes the fair river of
Lysse / which ronneth through Tarbe / and is as clear as a fountain. And a
five leages thens is the town of Morlance / parteyninge to the earl of Foiz /
at the enter of the county of Bierne / and under the mountain / a site leages
fro Tarbe is the town of Pan / which also perteyneth to the said earl. The
same time that the prince and princes was at Tarbe / therle of Foiz was at
Pan. He was there bylding of a fair castle / ioyninge to the town without
on the river of Grane. As Soon as he knew the coming of the prince and
princess being at Tarbe / He ordained to go and se them in great estate /
with mo than six hundred horses and threscore knights in his company. And of
his coming to Tarbe / was the prince and pri^cesse right ioyouse and made him
good chere: and there was the earl of Armynake and the lord Dalbret / and they
desired the price to require the earl of Foiz to forgive therle of Armynake all
/ or else part of the sum of florens that he ought to have. And the prince
who was wise and sage / considering all things / thought that be might not do
so / and said. Sir earl of Armynake / ye were taken by arms in yt journey of
battle / and ye did put my cosyn the earl of Foiz in adventure against
you. And though fortune were favorable to him and against you / his valor
ought not than to be made less. By like deeds / my lord my father nor I would
not be content that we should be desired to leave that we have won by good
adventure / at the battle of Poicters / whereof we thank god. Whan^e the earl
of Armynake herd that he was a basshed / for he failed of his entente: How be
it / yet the left not of so / But than he re^red the princess / who with a
good heart / desired therle of Foiz to give her a gift. Madame quod the^le / I
am but a mean man therefore I can give no great gifts. But madame / if the
thing that ye desire pass not the valor of threscore thousand frankes / I
will give it you with a glad chere. yet the princess assayed again / if she
could cause him to grant her full desire. But the ^rle was sage and subtell /
and thought verily that her desire was to have him to forgive clearly the Earl
of Armynake all his debt. And than he said again. Madame / for a poor
knight as I am / who buyldeth towns and castelles / the gift that I have
granted you ought to suffyce. the princess could bring him no farther: and
when she saw that / she said. Gentle earl of Foiz / the request that I desire
of you / is to forgive clearly the earl of Armynake. Madame quod the earl to
your request I ought well to condiscend^. I have said to you / that if your
desire pass not the valor of threscore thousand frankes / that I would
grant it you. But madame / the earl of Armynake owes me two hundred and
fyftie thousand frankes: and at your request / I forgave him thereof threscore
thousand frankes. Thus the matter stood in that case / and the earl of Armynake
/ at the request of the princes wan the forgyueng of threscore thousand
frankes. And anon after the earl of Foiz returned to his own country.

I Sir Johan Froissarde make narracion of this business / because when I was
in the county of Foyz and of Bierne / I passed by the cou^tie of Bygore. and I
demanded and enquered of the news of yt country / such as I knew not
before: And it was showed me / how the prince of wales and of Aquitayne /
while he was at Tarbe / he had great will to go se the castle of Lourde /
which was a three leages of / nere to the enter of the mountain / And when he
was there / and had well aduysed the town / the castle / and the country / he
praised it greatly: as well for the strength of the castle / as because it
stood on the fronter of diverse countries / For the garysone there / might run
well in to the realm of Arragon / in to Catellon / and to Barselon. Than the
prince called to him a knight of his household / in whom he had great trust /
and loved him entierly: and he had served him truly / and was called sir Pyer
Ernalde / of the country of Bierne / an expert man of arms and cosyn to the
earl of Foiz. Than the prince said to him. sir Ernalde / I instytue and make
you Chateleyn and captain of Lourde / and governor of the country of Bygore.
Look that ye keep this castle / se well that ye make a good account there of /
to the king my father and to me. Sir quod the knight I thank you / and I shall
observe your commandment. There he did homage to the prince / and the prince
put him in possession. It is to be known / that when the war began to renew
between England and France as it has been showed before: The earl Guy of
saint Poule and sir Hugh of Chatellon master of the crosbowes in France / in
that time beseged the town of Abuyle / and wan it / with all the country of
Poitou. The same time two great barons of Bigore / the one called sir Marnalte
Barbesan and the lord Danchyn turned french / and took the town / city /
and castle of Tarbe / which was but easily kept for the king of England:
But still the castle of Lourde / was in the hands of sir Pier Ernalt of
Bierne / who would in no wise yield up the castle / but made ever great war
against the realm of France / and sent for great company of adventurers in to
Bierne and Gascoyne / to help and to aid him to make war / so that he had
together many good men of arms. and he had with him six capitayns / and every
man fyftie spears under him.

The first was his brother Johan of Bierne a right expert squire / and Pier
Danchyne of Bygore / brother germayne to the lord Danchyne / he would never
turn french / Nandon of saint Colombe / Ermalton of mount Ague of saint
Basyll / and the Bourge of Carnela. These capitayns made diverse iourneys in to
Bygore / in to Tholousyn / in to Carcassene / and in to Albygoise: For ever
as soon as they were out of Lourde / they were in the land of their enemies /
and sometime they would adventure thyrtie leages of fro their hold. And in
their going / they would take nothing / but in their return there was
nothing could escape the^. Sometime they brought home so great plenty of
beestes and prisoners / that they wist not how to keep them. Thus they
rau^somed all the country except the earl of Foiz lands / For in his lands
they durst not take a chekyn / without they paid truly therefore: For if
they had displeased the earl / they could not long have endured. These
companyons of Lourde ran over all the country at their pleasure / and I rode
not far fro them. Thus the city of Tarbe was in great doubt / so that they
were feign to make couynaunt with the^. And between Tarbe and Lourde / there
was a great vyllage and a good abbey called Gynors / who in likewise were feign
to agree with them. Also on ye other part on the river of Lysse / there was a
great town called Bagueres / they of that town had a hard season / for they
were so haryed by the garyson of Maluoysen standing on a hylle / and the river
of Lysse rynnyng underneath / unto a walled town called Turney / in to the
which town they of Lourde and of Maluoysen had ever their recourse / to the
which town they did no hurt / because they had their resort thither: And
they of the town had ever a good market of their pyllage / and so dissymuled
ever with them / which they were feign to do / or else they could not have
lived / for they had no aid nor socoure of any person: the captain of
Maluoysen was a gascoyne / and his name was Remonet de Lespe / an expert man
of arms. He and his company and they of Lourde / rau^somed as well the
merchants of Aragon and Catheloyne as of France / without they agreed with
them.

In the season that I enterprised to go se the earl of Foiz / and to se the
dyuersities of the countries / where as I had never ben before. When I departed
fro Carcassene / I left the way to Tholous and went to Monterorall and so to
Fonges / than to Bell / and than to the first town of therle of Foiz / and
than to Masters / and so to the castle of Sanredyn. And than I ca^e to the
good city of Pauyers / perteyning to the earl of foiz / and there I tarried /
abydinge for some company going in to the country of Byerne / where the earl
was: And when I had tarried there a three days in great pleasure / for yt city
was deleetable / sta^dyng among the fair vynes / and enuyroned with a fair
river large and clear / called Liege. And on a day it so fortuned / that thither
came a knight of the earl of Foiz fro Auignon ward / called sir Espaenge de
Lion / a valyant and an expert man of arms / about the age of.l. years. And
so I gate me in to his company / and he was greatly desirous to here of the
matters of France / and so we were a six days in our journey / or we came to
Ortayse. And this knight every day after he had said his prayers most part
all the day after / he took his pastyme with me / in demaundyng of tidings:
and also when I demanded any thing of him / he would answer me to my purpose.
And when we departed fro Pauyers we past by the mount of Cesse / which was an
yuell passage / and so we came to the town and castle of Ortayse which was
french / but we passed by it / and so came to dinner to a castle of the^le of
Foiz half a leage thens called Carlat / standing high on a mountain. and
after dinner the knight said to me. sir / let us ride toguyder fair and easily
/ we have but two leages to ride to our lodgyng / and so I was content to do.
than the knight said / we have this day passed by the castle of Ortayse /
which does much damage in this country. Peter Danchyn keeps it / and bath
taken and stolen out of the realm of France / more than threscore thousand
fra^kes. than I demanded how that might be. I shall show you quod the knight.
On our lady day in August there is ever a great fair / and all the country
resorteth thither / for there is much marcha^dise. That day Pier Danchyn and
his companions of Lourde had taken their advise / and were determined to get
this town and castle. And so they sent two simple varlettes (by semyng) to
the said town in the month of May / to get them self some service in the
town / and so they did / and were retained with two masters / and they did
right dilygent service to their masters. And so went in and out on their
masters busynesse^ without any suspeciousnes of the^. and so on our lady day
in August there were many marchantes strangers. of Foiz / of Bierne / and of
France. And as ye know well / when machantes do mete that saw not together
long before / they will make good chere together. and so in the same houses
where as these two varlettes were i^ service / were many marchantes drinkyng
and making good chere / and their ostes with them. and by apoyntment about
midnight / Pier Da^chin and his company ca^e to Ortaise / and enbusshed
themself in a wode which passed through. And so they sent six varlettes to
the town with.ii. ladders / and they passed the dykes and came to the walls
and reared up their ladders / and the other.ii. varlettes that were in service
in the town did aid the^ / while their maysts sat making good chere: so these
said varlettes did put the^ self in adventure / and one of the said two
varlettes brought the other six to the gate within / where there was two men
keeping the keys / than this varlet said to the other six. sirs* keep your
self here privy and close / and stir not till ye here me whistle. I trust to
make the porters to open the gate of their ward / they have the keys of the
great gate / and therefore as soon as they have opyned their ward I will
whystle: Than step forth and slay the porters / I know well enough the
keys of the gate / for I have often times helped to keep the gate with my
master / and as they devised so they did. and so the varlet went to the gate /
and saw and herd how the porters were dri^kyng within their ward: than he
called the^ by their names and said. sirs open yor door / I have brought you of
the best wine that ever you drank / which my master has sent you / to the
intent you should keep your watch the better. And they who knew right well
the varlet / believed that he had said truth and opyned the door / and than he
whistled / and the other six stepped forth and entered in at the door / and there
they slew the porters so privily / that none knew thereof. tha^ they took the
keys and went and opyned ye gate / and let down the bridge easily yt none
knew thereof: Than they blewe a blast in a horn / so yt they that were
enbusshed mounted on their horses / and came on the spurs and entered on the
bridge and come in to the town: and so took all the men of the town syttyng
dri^kyng or^ls in their beds. Thus was Ortayse taken by Pier Danchin of
Bigore and by his co^panyons of Lourde / than I demanded of the knight how
they gat the castle / I shall show you quod he. The same time that Ortaise
was thus taken / the capiten of the castle by his yuell adventure was in the
town and supped with certain merchants of Carcassen / and was there taken
among other: and in ye next morning Pier Da^chyn brought him before the castle
/ where as his wife and children were / and made the^ believe that he would
strike of his heed / without his wife would deliver up the castle. and if she
would so do / he promised to deliver her husband quyte / and to suffer him and
all his to deperte with bag and baggage without any hurt. and the lady who saw
herself in a hard case / and saw she was not able to make ware her self /
and for saving of her husbands life / she yielded up the castle: and so her
husband and she and all theirs / deperted and went to Pauiers. Thus had Pier
Da^chin the town and castle of Ortayse. and the same time that they entered /
he and his company wan above.xxx.M. fra^kes / what in merchandise and prisoners
of France: but all such as were of the cou^tie of Foiz or of B^erne / were
clean delivered without any damage. and this Pier Danchyn kept Ortaise after /
the space of.v. year: and he and his company oftymes would ron to the gates of
Carcasson / which was a six leages thens and did great damage to the country
/ as well by raunsomynge of the towns / as by pyllage over all the country.

In the mean season that Pier Da^chin was in the garrison of Ortaise / On a
night certain of his company went out and came to a castle called Paiel^er a
good leage thens / whereof a french knight called Raymon du Pailier was owner
they had been there often before and failed of their purpose but as tha^ their
hap was such that they scaled the castle and took it / and the knight and
the lady in their beds: And let the lady and her children go fre / but they
kept still the knight in his own castle the space of four months / and at
last he paid a.M. fra^kes for his rau^some. And fi^ally when they had sore
ouerryden the country they sold these two castles / Ortaise and Paielier to
the^ of the country for.viii.M. frankes / and than they went to Lourde their
pri^cipall garyson. So thus in this adventure knights did put the^ self
daily. also the same time there was an expert man of arms in ye castle of
lourde a gascone borne / he was called le Me^geant of saint Basyll: On a time
he and.xxx. with him deperted fro Lourde and rode at all aduenturee in to
Tho^ousyn / and had thought to have got the castle of Pen in Allugois / but
he mist of his ^^^ent. and when he saw that he failed of his purpose / he ca^e
to the gate and made a great scrymisshe: and the same proper hour the seneshall
of Tholous rode forth and with him sir Hughe de Froid will and a.lx. spears /
and came by adventure to Pan while the said scrimysshe was in doing. Than
incontinent they set foot to the earth and came to the barryers: and so than
the Mengeant was over matched / but there he fought valiantly hand to hand /
and wounded the other knight in two or three places / how be it finally he was
taken by force / and his men outher taken or slain / there were but a few that
escaped. So this Me^geant was led to Tholous / and than the commons of the
town would have slain him bitwene the hands of the seneshall / he had much
pain to save his life / and so brought him in to the castle / for he was
right yuell beloved in Tholous. yet after it happed so well for him / that the
duke of Berry ca^e thider / and this knight had such friends that he was
delivered / and the seneshall had a thousand frankes for his rau^some: and
when he was delivered he returned to Lourde / and began again to make new
enterprises. And so on a time he departed fro Lourde and five with him without
any armoure / and he did on the abbyt of a monk and like other three monks
with him / and they had all shaven crowns / so that every man that saw them /
wend surely that they had been monks / the abbit and gesture be came them so
well. And in this manner he came to Mountpellyer and took up his lodging at the
sign of the Egle / and said how he was an abbot of high Gascon / and was
going to Paris on certain business perteyning to his house. and so he gate
famylier aquayntau^ce with a rich man of the town called Bare^ger / who had
also to do at Paris for certain business. Than this abbot said how he would
pay for his costs if he list to go in his company Whereof the good man was
right ioyouse / in that he should have his charges borne / and so he and one
varlet with him went forth with this monk. And when they had ryden a three
leages / this cou^terfet monk sir Me^geant took him prisoner / and led him
secret ways to his garrison of Lourde / and after did rau^some him at.v.M.
fra^kes. than I said ah saint Mary / was this Me^geant such an expert man of
arme^* ye truly sir quod he / and in war he dyed / in a place where as we shall
pass with in this three days / in a country called the Layre i^ Bigore / by a
town called Lachmache. well sir quod I / and I shall remember you thereof when
we come there. and so we rode till we came to Mo^ste que^ a good town closed /
perteyning to therle of Foiz / which the Armynagois and the labrisye^ce took
by stelthe on a season / but they kept it not but three days. and in the
morning we deperted fro Mo^stequen and rode to the town of Palamuche a good
town closed on the river of Garon / perteyning to therle of Foiz: And when we
were almost there we had thought to have passed the bridge of Garon / to have
entered in to the town / but we could not / for ye day before it had so sore
rayned fro the mou^tayns of Chataloyne and Aragon / whereby another river was so
increased which was called Saluz and ran so fast / that it raised up the river
of Garon in such wise / yt it brake one of the arches of the bridge / which
was of tymbre / wherefore we returned again to Montestquen / and tarried there
all the day. Than the next day the knight had counsel to pass the river by
botes by the town of Casseres: so we rode thider and did so much yt we past
the river of Garon with great pain and perell / for the boat that we were in
was not very great / it could not take at one time but two horses and their
kepars / and they that ruled the boat: and so when we were over we rode to
Casseres and a bode there all that day / and in the mean time yt our supper
was a dressyng / this knight said to me. sir Johan / let us go and se the
town: and so we passed a long through the town and ca^e to the gate toward
Palamuche and went out thereat and came to the dykes: Than the knight showed me
a pane of the wall and said. sir / se you yonder par^e of the wall which is
newer than all the remnant? yea sir quod I* well quod he / I shall show you
why it is so / it is a ten year past sith it fortuned. ye have herd or this /
of the war that was between the earl of Armynacke and therle of Foiz / how
be it now they are in peace: But the armynagoise and Labrisience wan but
little by that war. For on a saint Nycholas even / the year of our lord a
thousand three hundred threscore and two: Therle of Foiz took in battle therle
of Armynake and the lord Dalbret his nephue / and all the noble men that were
with them / and so led the^ as prisoners to Ortaise / whereby the earl of Foiz
has received ten times a hundred thousand frankes. And it fortuned after /
that the father of the earl of Armynake now lyueng / called sir Johan of
Armynake / made a journey and took this town of Casseres / and they had with
them a.ii. hundred men of arms / and so thought to keep the town by strength.
These tidings when they came to the knowledge of the earl of Foiz / being as
tha^^e at Pan. He like a sage and a valyant knight / called to him two
bastard brethren of his* called ^ Arnalt Guyllam and sir Pier de Bierne / and
said to them. sirs / I will ye ride incontinent to Cass^eres / I shall send
you men on every side / and within three days I shall be with you my self: and
let none come out of the town / but that ye fight with the^ / for ye shall be
strong enough. And when ye come there / cause the men of the country to bring
thither great plenty of wode / busshes / and fagottes and choke the gates
therewith: and than without that / make strong barryers / for I will yt they that
be within be so enclosed / that they issue not out of the gares / I shall cause
them to take another way. These two knights did his commandment and so went
to Palamuche / and all men of war of Bierne followed them / and so they came
before this town of Casseres. they that were within set little by them / but
they were not were how they were enclosed within the town / so that they
could not issue out at any gate. And the third day / the earl of Foiz came
thider with five hundred men of arms: and as soon as he came / he caused
barryers to be made round about the town / and also barriers round about his
host / because they should not be troubled in the night time. so in this case
they lay long without any assaut / in so much that vitayle began to fail
them within / for though they had wine great plenty they had nothing to eat:
Nor they could not fly away by the river / for it was as than^e to deep.
Than they thought it were better to yield the^ self as prisoners / than to dye
so shamefully for famyne / and so fell in treaty. Therle of Foiz agreed to
their treaty / so that they should not issue out at no gate / but to make a
hole in the wall and go out thereat / to come one by one without armoure / and
so to yield them as prisoners. It behooved the^ to take this way / and so made
a hole in ye wall and issued out one by one. And there was the earl ready and
all his people in order of battle to receive them as prisoners. and ever as
they came out / the Earl sent them to diverse castelles as prisoners: and his
cosyn sir John^ of Armynake / sir Bernarde Dalbret / and sir Manalt of
Barlabason / sir Raymo^de de Benache sir Benedicke de la Corneyle / and a
twenty of the best personages he led with him to Ortaise / and or they
departed / he had of them two hundred thousand tra^ke^: and thus was this hole
in the wall made / and than we went to our supper. And the next day we rode a
long by the river of Garon and passed by Palamuche and than we entered in to
the land of the earl of Comynges and Armynake / and on the other side was the
river of Garon / and the land of therle of Foiz. And as we rode / this knight
showed me a strong town called Marteras the Toussa^ / perteyninge to therle
of Comynges / and on the other side of the river on the mountain He showed me
two castelles parteyninge to the earl of Foiz / the one called Mountarall and
the other Mountclare. And as we rode between these towns and castelles a long
by the river of Garon in a fair medowe / this knight said to me. sir Johan / I
have seen here many fair scrimysshes and encountrynges / between the foizois
and armynakes / for as than there was no town nor castle but that was well
furnysshed with men of war / and so they warred each upon other. The
armynakes against yonder two castelles made a bastyde / and kept it with men of
war / and did much hurt in the earl of Foiz land: But I shall show you
how it fortuned. The earl of Foiz on a night sent his brother Peter de Bierne
with two hundred speres / and with them a four hundred villayns of the country
/ charged with fagottes much wode and busshes / and brought it to the bastide.
and than set fire thereon and so brent the bastyde / and all them that were
within without mercy. and sith it was never made again. So in such deuyses
we rode all that day a long by the river of Garon / and what on the one side
and on the other / we saw many fair castelles and fortresses. All that were
on our lift hand parteyned to therle of Foiz / and the other side parteyned
to therle of Armynake. And so thus we passed by Montpesac a fair castle and a
strong standing on an high rock / and underneath was the town and the high
way: and without the town a little / there was a place called ala gardea / and
a tower bitwene the rock and the river / which tower had a gate and a
portcolyse of iron. six men might well keep this passage against all the
world / for there could no man pass but two on a front / what for the tower
on the one side and the river on the other side. than I said to the knight /
sir / here is a strong passage and a myghtie country / it is true quod the
knight: and though thentre be strong / yet the earl of Foiz did conquer it
ones / and he and all his passed the same way with the help of the archers of
England / that he had as than in his company / and the great desire that they
had to pass in to the country. Come ride nere me sir quod he / and I shall
show you how it was / and so I rode just by him ^ and than he said: Sir / on
a time the Earl of Armynake and the lord Dalbret with a five hundred men of
war / ca^e in to the country of Foiz and to the marches of Pauyers. And this
was in the beginning of August / when men did gather in their corns and ye
grapes were ripe / at which time there was great habundaunce in the country.
Than sir Johan of Armynake and his company lodged before the town Sauredun / a
little leage fro the city of Pauyers. And he sent to them of Pauyers / that
without they would bye their corns and wynes / and pay for them: they said else
they would brinne and distroy all together. Than they of Pauiers were in great
fear / for the Earl their lord was far of fro them: for he was as than in
Byerne. And so they were feign to bye their own corns / and paid for them
five thousand frankes / but they desired fyftene days of respyte / which was
granted them. Than the earl of Foiz was informed of all this bu^synesse / and
he hasted him as much as he might / and assembled toguyder his men and came
suddenly in to the city of Pauyers with.xii. hundred spears. And so had
fought with sir Johan of Armynake if he had tarried / but he departed and went
in to the county of Comynges. So he had no money of them of Pauyers / for they
had no leysar to tarry therefore. But than therle of Foiz claymed the same some
/ for he said he was come / and saved their money and corn: and had put away
all their enemies. And so he had it to pay his men of war therewith / and
there he tarried till they had inned all their corn and vyntage. And so we
passed than foreby a castle called Bretytte / and also by another castle
called Bacelles / all parteyninge to the earl of Comynges: and as we rode a
long by the river / I saw a fair castle and a great town / and I demanded
of the knight what the castle was called. and he said it was named
Montesplayne / parteyninge to a cosyn of the earl of Foiz / called sir Roger
Despaygne / a great barone in the country / and in Tholousyn: and as than was
seneshall of Carcassoney. Than I demanded of this knight / if he were a kynne
to sir Charles of Spain / who was constable of France: and he answered and
said / no / he is not of that blood. For sir Loyes of Spaygne and this sir
Charles that ye speak of^came both out of the realm of Spain / and were
lynially extraught of spain and of France / by their mothers side / and were
cosyn germayns to king Alphons of Spaygne: and I served in my youth / sir
Loyes of Spaygne in the wars of Bretaygne / for he was always on the party
of sir Charles of Bloyes / against the earl Mou^tforde. And so we left
spckynge of that matter / and rode to saint Gouffens / a good town of the
Earl of Foiz. and the next day we dyned at Monreyle a good strong town of the
French kings / and sir Roger de Spaygne kept it. And after dinner we rode the
way toward Lourde and so rode through a great launde / endurynge a fyftene
leages / called the laundes Lann^ de vous / wherein were many dangerous
passages / for thieves and yuell doers. And in this launde stood the castle of
Mesere / parteyninge to the earl of Foiz / a good leage fro the town of
Tourney / the which castle the knight showed me and said. Sir / behold
yonder is Maluoysen / But sir / have ye herd here before how the duke of
Aniou / when he was in this country and went to Lourde? What he did in this
country / and how he laid siege to Lourde / and wanne it. And also the
castle of Gryngalet / on the river side that ye se yonder before us /
parteyneth to the lord de la Batte. Than I remembered my self / and said. Sir
/ I trow I never herd thereof as yet / therefore I pray^ you show me the
matter. But sir / I pray you show me where is the river of Garon become for I
can se it no more. ye say truth quod the knight / it departs here / in
thentryng of these mountayns / and it grows and comes out of a fou^tayne a
three leages hens / the way to Chatelomy / by a castle called saint Beart / the
fronter of the realm of France toward Aragon: And there is as now / a
squire called Ermalton / otherwise called Bourge de Spaygne. He is lord thereof
/ and ^hatelayne of all the country / and he is cosyn germayne to sir Roger de
Spain / if we se him I shall show you him. He is a goodly person and a good
man of arms / and he has done more damage to them of Lourde / than any other
knight or squire of all the country: and the earl of Foiz loves him ryghtwell
/ for he is his companyon in arms. I will leave to speak of him / for I think
at this feast of Christmas / ye shall se him in the earl of Foiz house: but
now I shall show you of the duke of Aniou how he came in to this country /
and what he did. Than we rode forth fair and easily / and he began to say
as follows.

Of the War es that the duke of An ^^u made against the Englysshmen and how
he recovered the castle of Maluoysen in Bigore: which was afterward given to
therle of Foiz. Cap.xxiii.
AFter the beginning of the wars / whan^e they began to win on the
English men / that they held in Acquitayne / and that sir Olyuer lesquyn was
become french. He led ye duke of Aniou in to Bretaygne / on the lands of
sir Robert Canoll* who was at the sege before Dyriuall / as ye have herd
before: as I think and of the treaty that six Hughe Br^ce his cosyn made to
the duke of Antou / as to re^dre the castle and deliver good hostages / so
that the duke of Aniou should not come to reyse the siege But when sir Robert
Canoll was within the castle of Dyriuall / than he would hold no tretie. All
this is true sir quod I. well quod he / but have you herd of the scrimysshe
that was before the castle / where a^ sir Ol^uer de Clesquyn was wounded? Sir
I can not tell you quod I / I can not remember all. Wherefore sir I pray you
show me of the scrimysshe / and of the siege what came thereof / For
paraduentureye know it some other ways than I do / and ye shall return
again well enough to your purpose of them of Lourde and of Maluoysen. It is
true quod the knight: it was so that sir Garses of the castella right valiant
knight of the country and good french / went to the duke of Aniou / to cause
him to come before Beauuosyn. The duke had made his sommons to hold his
journey before Dyriuall / and made this sir Garses for his valyantnesse
marshall of his host* and true it is as I herd say / yt wha^ he saw that sir
Robert Canoll would not keep the tr^atie that was made before / nor would not
deliver the castle of Dyriuall. Than he came to the duke and said. Sir What
shall we do with these hostages? It is no fault in them that the castle is
not given up / and it were great pytie that they should dye / for they be
ge^tylmen and have deserved no death. Than the duke said: Were it good than to
deliver them? yea truly sir quod the knight / it were great ^ytie otherwise.
Well quod the duke / do therein as ye list. Than this sir Garses went to
deliver them / and as he went / sir Olyuer Clesquyn met him and demanded
wheder he went and fro whens he came. I come fro my lord the duke of Aniou /
and am going to deliver the hostages. To deliver them quod sir Olyuer abide a
little and return again with me to the duke. and so they ca^e to the duke
who was in his lodging in a great study sir Olyuer saluted him and said. Sir /
What is your intent? Shall not these hostages suffer death? By my faith they
shall / in the dispyte of ser Robert Canoll and sir Byrre / who has falsed
their faith. Wherefore ser I will ye know without they dye / I shall wear no
armure this hole year after / in none of yor watres. If they should escape thus
it were good chep^. The siege has cost you threscore. M. frankes / and new
you will show grace to your enemies, who ^epeth with you another faith nor
truth. With those words the duke began to chafe and said* sir Olyuer do
therein as ye think best. Than quod sir Olyuer / I will that they lose their
lives / there is good cause why / sith they keep not their promise. Than sir
Olyuer departed fro the duke and came to a place before the Castle / and sir
Garses durst not speak one word for them / for if he had / he should have lost
his labor / since sir Olyuer had taken on him the enterprise, than he called
the hangman / and made him stryke of the heedes of two knights and two squyers
/ which was great pytie / and there were mo than two hundred in the ho^st that
wept / for them. And incontinent sir Robert Canoll opyned a posterne gate /
and on the brimme of the dykes in dispyte of the french men / he caused to
stryke of the heedes of all the prisoners that he had without any respyte / and
incentynent opyned the castle gate and let down the bridge / and issued out
and (...) to the barryers / and scrymysshed with the french men. And as sir
Garses showed me / they was a sore scrimysshe / and there sir Olyuer Cl^squyn
was hurt / and so returned to his lodgyng. There were three good men of arms
(two squyers of the country of B^erne) Bettram de Baruge and Eualton de Pain
/ and they were both sore hurt. and the next day the duke dislodged and went
fro Dyryuall to Tholous to the entente to distroye Lourde / for they of Tholous
co^playned greatly of the garyson of Lourde.

So than the duke went first and laid siege to Maluoysen / which we may se
yonder before us: and the duke had in his company an vi^i. thousand men of
war / beside the geneuoys and the commons of the good towns. Captain as
than of Maluoysen / was a squire of Gascoyne called Raymonde de Lesp^an expert
man of arms. Every day at the barriers there was scrimysshes and goodly feats
of arms done: and the duke lay in yonder fair meadows / between the town of
Turney and the castle by the river side of Lysse. This siege enduryng sir
Garses marshall of thoost / went with five hundred men of arms and two hundred
archers and crosbowes / and a two thousand of other commons / and laid siege
to the castle of Trygalet / which we have left here be hynde us / which
castle a squire of Gascoyne kept / for the lord de la Barde: for he was his
cosyn / and was called the Bastot of Manlyon and he had within the castella.xl.
companyons and they did in that country such maystries / that none could go
that way but they were taken prisoners / without it were the pylgrimes that
went to saint James / with the aid of a another fortress called Nemeluz. In
these two garysons all the robbers and pyllers of the country assembled / And
ever they were against the earl of Foiz / and also against the earl of Army
nake / wherefore they cared not / though the duke of Aniou came in to that
country. And when sir Garses was come before the castle of Trygalet / he
could not approach on the one part for the river / and so gave a great
assaute / and many men hurt both within and without with shot and five days
together this sir Garses made assautes / so that at last the artillary within
began to fail them / and the french men perceived it very well. Than by
gentylnesse / sir Garses caused the captain to come and speak with him under
save conducte / and said to him. Bastot I know well what case ye be in. ye
have no artillary within / nor nothing to defend you fro the sante / but
spears. Know for truth / that if ye be taken by force / I can not save your
life nor none of your company / for the commons of the country will slay you
all / which I would be loathe to se / for ye are my cosyn. Therefore I counsel
you to yield up the fortress: And sithe yt I desire you so to do / ye can
bear no blame in your so doing / and depart hens wheder as ye list / for ye
have kept this castle long enough Sir quod the squire / I would gladly follow
your counsel / if it were out of deeds of arms for in deed I am your cosyn.
But sir / I can not yield up this fortress all alone / for such as be within
/ have as good part thereof as I have / though they hold me for their
captain. Sir I shall go to them and show them as ye have said / if they
accord to render it up / I shall not say nay: and if they will keep it still
whatsoever adventure fall / I shall take such part as they do. It is well
said quod sir Garses / deperte when ye will / I know your intent. Than the
Bastot of Manlyon returned to the castle of Trygalet / and called all his
company toguyder / and there showed them all the saying of sir Garses / and so
demanded of them what they thought was best to do. And so they counsayled
toguyder a long space / some would abide the adventure and said / how they
were strong enough: and some would depart and said / how it was a good time
so to do / seeing that they had no more artillary / and saw well how the duke
of Aniou was cruel / and the commons of Thoulous / of Carcasson^y / and of
other towns there about / sore displeased with them / for the great domages
that they had done to the^. So all things consydred / they concluded to yield
up the castle / so that they might be safely conducted and all theirs to the
castle Culyer / the which was kept by some of their companyons / on the
fronter of Tholousin. So thus the captain returned again to the host to
speak with sir Garses / and he agreed to their desires: For he saw well the
castle would not lightely be won by assaute / without loss of much people.
So than they prepared to depart and trussed all their baggage / for they had
much pyllage / they took with them the best and left the resydue. And sit
Garses conveyed the^ to Culyer without danger. Thus the french men at that
time gate this castle Trygalette. Than sir Garses did give the castle to the
co^mens of the country / and they did raze it down / as ye se: so that there
was never none sith that would reedify it again. And so fro thens sit Garses
went toward the castle Nantylleur / standing on these laundes nere to the
castle Lameu. And as he went thyderwarde / one showed him yt the castle
Nantylleur was void / and they departed that kept it. Than^e sir Garses
tarried in the selde and devised what was best than to do. Than the seneshall of
No besen said. sir / this castle of Nantylleur is in my bayliwyke / and it
ought to parteyne to the earl of Foiz. I pray you let me have it / and I shall
make it to be so kept / on my proper cost and charge / that no man that will
any hurt to the contrary shall never enter therein. Sir quod they of Tholous /
he says well / and he is a valyant man / it were better he had it than
another. Well quod sir Garses I am content. Thus the castle of Na^tylleur was
delivered to the seneschall of Nobesen / who incontinent rode thither and found
it clean void. Than he newly fortifyed that was broken / and heset therein a
captain / a squire of the country called Fortefey saint Poule / and than he
returned to the siege of Maluoysen / where ye duke was and also thither was
come sir Garses and all his company / and showed the duke all that he had done.
This siege endured about a.vi. wekes and nighe every day there was
scrimysshinge at the barryers / at last they without stopped their water / so
that their sesterns began to dry and in six wekes their fell not a drop of
rain / the season was so dry and hot / and they without had ease enough by
reason of the fair river. When they wtin saw what case they were in / they
were sore abashed / for they saw well they could not long endure. Wine they
had plenty / but fresshe water failed them: Than^e they aduysed to fall in
treaty with the duke / and so they did: And Raymonde de lespee purchased a
save conduct to go in to the host to speak with the duke / and so he did / and
said. Sir / if ye will be courtesse to me and to my company / I shall render in
to your hands the castle of Maluoysen. What curtesy would ye quod the duke /
that I should show you? Depart your way / you and all yours in to your own
countries / and enter not in to no forteresse that holds against us / for if
ye do: and if I get you or any of you / I shall deliver you to Ioselyn / that
shall make your beerdes without any rasoure. Sir quod Raymonde / if we shall
deperte shall we have with us all our bags and baggages / for that we have
won it by arms / and in great adventure? Than the duke studied a little and
said. I am content that ye bear with you / as much as ye may bear in males
and summers / and none otherwise. And if ye have any prisoners / that ye deliver
them to us. I am content quod Raymonde. Thus all they within deperted and
yielded up the castle to the duke of Anto we: But Raymonde de lespe turned and
be came french / and served the duke of Aniowe long time after / and went
with him in to Italy / and there dyed in ascrimysshe before Naples / when the
duke of Aniou and the duke of / Sauoy made their voyage.

How the garrison and castle of Lourde was cast down and disconfyted by / the
great dilygence that the Earl of Foiz made. Cap. xxiiii.
THus quod the knight the duke of Aniou gatte the castle of Maluoysen / whereof
he great joy / and made it to be kept by a knight of Bygore / called sir
Cyquart of Luperier / and after he gave it to the earl of Foiz who keeps it
yet / and will do as long as he lives: And he has made captain there a
knight of Bygore / one of his own lynage / called sir Raymon de Lane / and
when the duke of Aniou had the possessyon of Maluoysen / and had delivered his
country fro the Englysshmen / and fro the pyllers of the conntre. Than he
went and laid seige before the castle of Lourde. Than therle of Foiz douted
greatly the duke of Aniou / because he came so nere him / and wyste not what he
intended. Than therle of Foiz assembled together knights and squyers / and sent
the^ about to diverse garysons / and set his Brother sir Arnolde Guyllame in
the town of Morlens with two hundred spears in the town of Pan / and sir
Peter of Cabeston in to the cite of Lestrade with other two hundred spears /
and sir Monant of No^nalles went in to the town of Heart let with a hundred
spears / and Arnolde Gehe rell in to the town of Montgeberell with a hundred
spears / sit Foulquant Dortery in to the town of Sanetere with a hundred
spears / and I Espaygne of Lion was sent to the Mount Marson with two hundred
spears. There was no castle in all Bierne / but that was well provided with
men of war / and the earl himself lay still at his Castle of Ortayse by
his florens. Why sir quod I / has he so great plenty of florens? sir quod he
at this hour / I think he has well to the no^bre of.xxx. times a hundred
thousand. There is no lord lyuenge as now / that is so large and lyberall in
gyueng of gifts / as he is. Than I demanded of him to what manner of people he
was so lyberall / he answered and said / to strangers / to knights and
squyers coming through his country / and to haraldes and mynstrels / and to
every man that speaks with him / there is none departs fro him without some
reward / for if any refuse his gift he is not content. A saint mary sir quod I
/ to what intent keeps he so much money / and where does he get it. Is his
renenues so great to gader toguyder such treasure? sir / I would gladly know
this / if it pleased you. Well sir quod the knight ye shall know it / but ye
have demanded of metwo things. First ye have demanded of me / to what intent
he keeps such treasure / I shall show you. Therle of Foiz always douteth of
the war that he had with therle of Arminake / and also for the business of
his neighbors / the french king and the king of England / whom he would not
wyllingly displease: For he has always dissymuled between them / during all
the wary season unto this present time / for he never armed him self for any
of their parties / He has always been ever in good case with both parties I
say to you: and so ye shall say youreselfe whan^e ye have ones knowledge of
him and herd him speak / and ones know the order and state of his house / ye
shall se that he is at this day / the most sage prince in the world. And
there is none so great a lord / another the french king nor the king of
England / yt will wyllingly have his yuell will: as for his other neighbors /
as the king of Arragon or the king of Nauer / he estemeth them but little / for
he will find mo men of arms (by reason of such friends as he has got with
his gifts / and money that he has in treasure) than both those kings can
do: For I have herd him say / that when the king of Cyper was in his country
of Byerne / and moved him to have gone to the voyage of the holy Sepulture. He
had thought the same time to have made such a journey / that if the french
king or the king of England had taken that enterprise / how there should have been no lord should have brought such a company as he would have done / and as
yet he is of the same mind: and in part / that is one of the causes that he
gadereth such treasure.

tHe prince of Wales / the season that he reigned in the country of Acquitayne
being at Burdeux on the river of Geronde / thought to have made him war. The
prince manassyde him for the country of Bierne and would have had him to have
hold his country of him / and the earl said he would not: and said / how his
country of Bierne was so free a land / that it ought to do homage to no man of
the world. And the prince / who at that time was great and sore feared / said
how he would compel him perforce / for therle of Armynake and the lord
Dalbret who loved not therle of Foiz because of such victories as he had won
on them before. They tytled the prince ever in his ear / and entysed him to
have made war against the earl of Foiz / but the voyage that the prince made
in to Spain brake his purpose. Also sir John^ Chandos / who was chief of
counsel with the Prince was against it / that the prince should make any
watre to the earl. The earl of Foiz loved right well sir Johan Chandos and he
him / but the earl douted the prince / because he was fierce and coragious. and
therefore he gadered together as much treasure as he could get / to thentent
therewith to defend him if need were. And so he set great tails and taxes in
all his country and in every town / which as yet endures / and shall do as
long as he lives. He had of every fire every year two fra^kes / and the rich
to bear out the poor / thereby he gadered and yet does great riches / and the
people pays it with a marvelous good will. For by reason thereof / there is
another English nor french / nor robbers nor reyuers / yt does them any
hurt / to the value of one pe^ny. And so his country is in sauegarde and
justice truly kept / for in doing of justice he is right cruel: he is the
most rightful lord yt is now lyueng. And so with these words we came to
the town of Turney / where as we should rest all night. So than the knight
seized of his talkyng / and I remembered well where we left against the next
day / and we were lodged at the sign of the Star and took our ease. And at
supper time the captain of Maluoysin / called sir Raymonde of Lane / came to
se us and supped with us / and brought with him four flaggons of the best wine
that I dra^ke of in all my journey: those two knights talked long togider: and
when it was late the knight departed and returned to the castle of Maluoysin.
and the next morning we mounted on out horses / and departed fro Tourney and
passed by a gyde the river of Lysse / and rode toward the city of Tarbe / and
entered in to Bigore: And we left the way to Lourde / to Bagueres / and to the
castle of Mountgaylliard on the lift hand. And we rode toward a vyllage
called Teracimytat / and did coost it / and came to a wode in the land of the
lord of Barbasan / and we came nere to a castle called Matheras / at the
enter of the country of Layre. Than the knight said to me. Sir Johan / behold
here the place of Layre / and behold it well and advise the country / which
seemed to me right strange / I thought my self but as lost there / if I had not
ben in the company with that knight. Than I remembered the words that this
knight had showed me.ii. or three days before of that country of Layre / and of
the Me^geant of Lourde. Than I said to him. Sir / ye showed me the last day /
that when we should be in the country of Layre / that ye would show me the
manner of the Me^geant of Lourde / and how he dyed. It is true sir quod the
knight / come on and ride by me and I shall show you. Than I rode nere him to
here his words / and than he said. Sir / in the season that Peter Danchyne
held the castle and castle of Ortyngas / as I have showed you before this
time. They of the garrison of Lourde sometime rode forth at adventure far fro
their garyson / how be it they had not always the advantage / for ye may
behold here the castle of Barbason and the Castle of Martheras / wherein
there was always many men of war there / and in other garysons / as Bagueces
/ Tourney / Mountgalyarde / Salenges / Benache / Gorre / and Tarbe / all
french towns and garysons. And when these garysons knew that they of Lourde
rode outher toward Tholous or Carcassone: Tha^ they would lay busshementes
for them / and sometime take fro them of Lourde their pray and pyllage / and
sometime they escaped without any rencounter. And on a time it fortuned / that
Eruaulton of saint Colombe and the Mengeant of saint Cornyle / and to the
nombre of sixscore spears of good men of war departed fro Lourde / about the
mou^tayns / between these two ryuers Lysse and Less / and so rode nere to
Tholous / and at their retournyng they found in the meadows a great nombre of
beestes / oxen and keen / hogs / mottons / and lambs: and also they took
diverse of the good men of the country prisoners / and so drove all their pray
before them. Than it was showed to the captain of Tarbe a squire of Gascoyne
/ called Erualton Bysette / an expert man of arms / How they of the garyson
of Lourde were abroad / and were coming homewarde with a great pray: than he
sent to the lord of Benache and to Enguerose / eldest son to sir Raymonde /
and also to the lord of Barbason / Certifyeng them how he would ride out
against them of Lourde. The knights and squyers of the country of Bigore
agreed to ride forth / and assembled to guyder at Tourney / and with them there
was the Bourcke of Spaygne / who came fro his garyson of saint Bearte. So they
were to the nombre of two hundred spears / and they had their spies abroad in
the Country / to know what they of Lourde did. On the other side / they of
Lourd had abroad their spies to know if any men of war were abroad to let
them of their enterprise. And so much did these yt either party knew what
other did. Whan^e they of Lourde knew how they of the french garysons were
abroad and tarried for them at Tourney / Than they were in doubt / and took
counsel what they might best do / to save their pray. Than they determined to
depart their company in two. The one company to drive before them their pray
with all their varlettes / and to go covertly by the lane of Bourge / and so to
pass the way by the bridge of Tourney and to pass the river of Less /
between Tourney and Lymosyn. And the other company to ride in battle by the
mountayns / and to make show to go again in to the country of Layre by
Martheras / and so to fall in between Barbason and Mountgalyarde: And said /
that if they mete toguyder about Mountgaylliarde / than they should be in
sauegarde / for than we shall be soon at Lourde. Thus as they ordained so they
did. And the bastard of Caruyllacke / Guyllonet of Harmyes / and Perot
Burcyer / John^ Calleuyn of Basile / the reed squier and forty spears with
all their varlettes with all their pray / took the way by the lane of Burge /
and so to pass the river at the bridge bitwene Tourney and Maluoysin /
thinking to mete all together between Eynitat and Mou^tgaylyarde: and so they
departed / and the other company as Erualton of Restue / Erualton of saint
Colombe / and the Me^geant of saint Coruyle with fourscore men of arms / there
was not.x. varlettes among them. So they made the^ self ready and rode close
toguyder / ever lokyng for their enemies: For they knew well they were abroad
to watch for them. In like manner as they of Lourde had taken their advise and
counsel how to return / in likewise the french men took counsel how
they might encounter their enemies / and sir Monant of Barbasan and Erualton
Bysset / said to their company. Sirs / we know well how they of Lourde are
abroad in the feldes / and drives before them great pray and many prisoners.
It should be a great dyspleasure to us / if they should escape: Therefore let
us put our self in to two busshementes / we are company enough so to do. Than
it was ordained that Erualton and the Bourge of Spain / sir Raymonde of
Benache and Anguerot Lane with a hundred speres / should keep the passage at
Tourney: For they knew well that they of Lourd with their pray must needs
pass the river of Lysse. and it was ordained / that the lord of Barbasone and
Erualton Byset with a hundred spears / should ride at adventures. So this they
deperted / and the lord of Benache and the Bourge of Spaygne put them self in
a busshment / between Maluoysin and Turney / and the other company rode and
took the same way that we be now in / which is called the Layre / and here
they met with the^ of Lourde. And when each of them saw other / they a
lyghted and made them ready to fight / And so came each against other cryeng
their cries / saint George Lourd and the other our lady of Bigore. and so there
each came to other with hand strokes / foyninge with their spears each at
other a great space / and as I herd reported of them that were there / at the
first brunt there was none overthrown. And so when each of the^ had a great
space foyned each at other / they cast down their spears and took their axes
and gave therewith each to other great and horrible strokes / every man with his
match / and in that manner they fought toguyder more than two hours: And when
any of them had fought so long that they lacked brethe / than they would fair
and easily depart / and go sytte down by a dyke side that was full of water /
and put of their bassenettes and refresshe them self. And when they were well
refresshed / they put on their bassenetes and returned again to fight. I
believe there was not such a business nor a battle so well fought (sith the
battle yt was in Bretayne of.xxx. against as many) As this was here at
Martheras in Bigore. Thus they fought hand to hand / and Erualton of saint
Colombe was at the point to have been disconfyted by asquyer of the country
called Guyllonet of Salynges. This Erualton of saint Colombe had a varlet / who
stood by and saw the battle and fought not / for there was none that said any
thing to him. And when he saw his master almost at vttraunce he was sorry /
and so came to his master and took his axe out of his hands and said.
Erualton / go your way and rest you / ye can no lengar fight. And than he with
the axe went to the squire and gave him such a stroke on the heed that he was
astonished and had nere hand fallen to the earth. Whan^e Guyllonet felt him
self stryken he was sore displeased / and came against the varlet to have
stryken him / but the varlet stepte under the stroke and enbrased the squire /
who was sore traueyled with so long fightyng / and so the varlet ouerthrewe him
wrestlyng under him. tha^ the varlet said. I shall slay the / without thou
will yield thy self to my master. Who is thy master quod the squire?
Erualton of saint Colombe quod the varlette / with whom thou haste fought all
this season. The squire saw that he had not the vauntage / but that he was
under the varlette / who had a daggar ready to stryke him. So he yielded him to
render his body prisoner at Lourde within fyftene days after / rescues or no
rescues. This service did this varlet to his master. And sir John^ / I assure
you / there were many feats of arms done and many overthrown and taken
prisoners / some to yield them self in a certain space at Tarbe / and some to
come to Lourde. They fought this day hand to hand / Erualton By set with the
Mengeant of saint Basyll / they did many a feate of arms between the^: and
they fought so long till they were so weary / that they could aid them self no
lengar. and there was slain on the place two capitayns / the me^ geant of
Lourde / and on the other part Erualton Bysset. Than ceased the battle by
agreement of both parties / for they were so weary / that they could scante
hold their axes in their hands. Some unarmed them to refresshe the^ self /
and left their armure in the place. They of Lourde bare away with them the
Mengeant slain / and the french men bare Erualton Bysset to Tarbe. And to
thentent that this battle should be had in remembrance where as the two
squyers fought / there was set a Cross of stone / behold yonder is the
Cross. and with those words we came to the Cross / and there we said for
their souls a Pater noster and an Aue maria. By my faith sir quod I / I am
glad I have herd this / for this was a sharp business of so little people.
But sir / what became of them that went with the pray? I shall show you quod
he. They came to the perte of Tourney beside Maluoysin / to have passed there
as they had ordained / And there they found the busshment of the Bourge of
Spaygne / who brake out of their busshment / and they of Lourde could not
recule back / they had no remedy / but to adventure their self. And I tell
you truth / there was as sore a fight and as long endured or lengar / than
that at Martheras: and there Erualton of Spain did marvelous in arms / He
had an axe in his hand / who soever he struck therewith went to the earth for he
was bygge and well made / and not over charged with much flesh. He took there
with his own hands the two capitayns / the Burge of Coruyle and Perot
Palatyne of Bierne and there was slain a squier of Nauar called Fera^do of
Myrando / who was an expert man of arms. some that were at the business said
that the Bourge of Spaygne slew him / and some said he was overcome for heat
in his harness. Finally the pray was rescewed / and all taken or slain that
went therewith / there were but three saved them self / and they were varlettes^
who departed and went over the river of Lysse. Thus became of this adventure:
They of Lourde never lost before so much as they did than: They were
courtesly raunsomed / and diverse delivered by exchange one for a another / For
diverse of them that fought here at the place of Layre / were taken by the^ of
Lourd Therefore every part were courteyse one to another / in raunsomyng of
their companyons. Ah saint Mary sir quod I / is the Bourge of Spaygne so bygge
a man as ye speak of? yea sir truly quod he / for in all Gascoyne there is
none like him in strength of body / therefore the earl of Foiz has him ever in
his company. It paste not a three year that he did in a sport a great deed /
as I shall show you.

So it was on a Christmas day / the Earl of Foiz held a great feast and a
plentiful of knights and squyers / as it is his usage: And it was a cold day
/ and the earl dyned in the hall / and with him great company of lords. And
after dinner he deperted out of the hall and went up in to a galarye of.xxiiii.
stayres of heyght / in which galarye there was a great Chymney wherein they made
fire / when therle was there. and at that time there was but a small fire / for
the earl loved no great fire / how be it he had wood enough there about /
and in Bierne is wode enough. The same day it was a great frost and very
cold: And when the earl was in the galarye and saw the fire so little / he
said to the knights and squiers about him. Sirs this is but a small fire /
and the day so cold: than Erualton of Spain went down the stayres and beneth
in the court he saw a great meny of Asses laden with wood to serve the house
/ Than he went and took one of the grettest Asses with all the Wood and laid
him on his back / and went up all the stayres in to the galary / and did cast
down the Ass with all the wood in to the chymney / and the Asses fete
upward / Whereof the earl of Foiz had great joy and so had all they that
were there / and had marueyle of his strength / how he alone came up all the
stayres with the Ass and the wood in his neck. I took great pleasure in this
tale and in other that this knight sir Espaygne de Leon showed me / whereby I
thought my journey much the shorter. And in showing of these matters / we
passed the pase of Layre and the castle of Martheras / where as the battle
was / and so we rode nere to the castle of Barbason / which is strong and
fair / and is within a leage of Tarbe / which we saw before us / and a fair
way costyng the river of Lysse coming fro the mountayns. Than we rode fair
and easily at our leysar to refresshe our horses. and there he showed me the
river / the castle / and the town of Mountgalyarde / and the way that lay
to Lourde. Than^e it came to my remembrance to demand the knight / how the
duke of Aniou when he was in the country / and that the castle of Maluoysin
was yielded to hi^ / came before Lourde / and what he did there. and with right
a good will he showed me and said. When the duke of Aniowe departed from
Maluoysin withal his host / he passed over the river of Lysse at the bridge of
Tourney / and went and lodged at Baguiers / where as is a good river going to
Tarbe / for this river of Tourney comes not thither / but falls in to the
river of Garon beside Mou^tunllyon / and so the duke went and laid siege to
Lourde. sir Peter Erualton of Bierne and Johan his brother / Peter Danchyn /
Erualton of Restue / Erualton of saint Colombe / and the Mengeant / who as than
was lyueng / and Ferando of Myrando with Olyuer Barbe / the Burge of
Coruyllacke / and the Burge Canuse / and certain other companions being within
Lourde. When they were well enfourmed of the dukes coming thither / they
fortifyed them and their garyson against him / and held the town of Lourde
for all the sautes that the duke made / Which fyftene days contynually
endured / and there were many feats of arms done. The duke ordained many
Instruments of war for the saute / so that finally the town was won / but
they lost neither man / woman / nor good: for they were all withdrawn in to
the castle / For they knew well at length the town would not hold / for it
was closed but with dykes and pales. When the town of Lourde was won the
French men had great joy / and so lodged in the town round about the
castle / which was not prignable without it were with long siege There the
duke tarried more than six wekes / and lost more than he wanne / for they
without could do no hurt to them within / for the Castle stands on a
round rock / made in such manner / that no man could aproche it by scalynge
nor other wise / but by one enter: And there at the barryers were many
scrimysshes and many feats of arms done / and diverse knights and squyers of
France were hurt / such as would prese to nere. When the duke saw how he
could not have his intent to get the castle of Lourde / than he fell in
treaty with the captain within / and offered him much money to give up the
garyson. The knight who was of great valyantesse excused himself and said.
How the garyson was not his / but it parteyned to the heritage of the king of
England / and said: How he could not sell it nor give it nor put it away /
without he should be a tray tour / which in no wise he would be / but true to
his natural lord during his life: and moreover said / that when the castle
was delivered him / it was on a condycion / which he swear solempnely by his
faith in the prince of Wales hand / yt he should keep the castle of Lourde
against all men during his life / except it were against the king of
England. The duke could never have other answer of him / for gift nor
promise that he could make. And when the duke of Aniou and his counsel saw
how they could have nothing else / and saw that they lost their pain / they
dislodged / and at their departing they clean brent the town. Than the duke
of Aniowe drew back in coostynge Bierne / and rode toward the Mount Marsen /
and had knowledge how the earl of Foiz had fortifyed all his garysons with men
of war / whereof he was nothing dyscontent / but he was displeased / in that
the knights and squyers of Bierne held Lourde against him The earl of Foyz
(as I have showed you here before) doughted greatly the duke of Aniowe /
though the duke did him no hurt: But the earl of Arminake and the lord
Dalbret would have had the Duke to have made him war / but the duke had no
will there to: But while he lodged between Mount Marsen and the Boce Dalbret /
he sent to the earl to Ortaise sir Peter of Beule / whom the earl received
honorably and lodged him in the castle of Ortaise / and made him as good chere
as he could / and gave him mulettes and coursers / and to his men great gifts.
And he sent by him to the duke of Aniowe four coursers and two Allans of
Spaygne / fair and good. And there were secret treaties between the earl and
this sir Peter of Beule: of which treaties no man knew the intent thereof of a
good space after. But after by such euydent tokens as appeared we supposed
somewhat / and the matter I shall show you / and by that time we shall come to
Tarbe.

Anon after that the duke of Aniou had made his voyage / and that he was at
Tholous / Than the earl of Foiz send by his letters / certain messangers to
Lourde to his cosyn sir Peter Erualton of Bierne / desyring him to come and
speak with him at Ortayse. And when the knight had reed therles letters / and
saw his notable message / he had diverse ymaginacions / and wist not wheder he
might go or abide. All things consydred / he said he would go / because in no
wise he would displease the earl. And when he departed fro Lourde / he said to
Johan of Bierne his brother / in the presens of all the companyons of the
garyson. Brother Johan / the earl of Foyz has sent for me / I can not tell
you why / But sithe it is his pleasure to speak with me I will go to him. I
fear me greatly that I shall be required to give up this fortress of Lourde:
For the duke of Aniou when he was in the country he costed Bierne / and entered
not therein. And the earl of Foyz has long intended to have the castle of
Maluoysin / to the intent to be lord of the lanede Bourge / and of the
fronters of Comynges and of Bigore. I know not what treaty there is made /
between him and the duke of Aniou / But one thing I say plainly: as long as
I live / I shall never yield up the garyson / but to mine own natural lord
the king of England. Wherefore brother Johan / in case that I stablysshe you in
mine absence to be Captain here / that ye shall swear to me by the faith of
your gentylnesse / that ye shall keep this castle / in like manner and form
as I do / and that for life or death ye fail not. And Johan of byerne swear to
fulfill his desire: Than sir Peter Erualton went to Ortayse and a lyghted at
the sign of the Moon / And when he thought it was time / he went to the
castle of Ortayse to therle / who with great joy received him and made him
sit at his board / and showed him as great semblant of love as he could. And
after dinner he said. Cosyn Peter / I have to speak with you of diverse things /
wherefore I will that ye depart not without my leave. The knight an swered and
said. sir / I shall not depart till it be your pleasur. Than the third day
after the earl of Foiz said unto him / in the presens of the vycount of
Gousserant his brother / and before the lord Da^chyn of Bigore / and diverse
other knights and squyers. The earl said a loud yt every man might here him:
Peter I send for you and ye become. I will ye know / the duke of Aniou would
me much yuell because of the garrison of Lourde / which ye keep: for the
which cause my land was nere hand ouerron and good friends had not been. And
it is his opynion and diverse other of his company / that he hates me / because
(as they say) how I maynteyne and sustain yon / because ye be of Byerne: And
it is not mete for me to have the yuell will of so great a prince / as the duke
of Aniowe is. Wherefore I command you as ye will eschew my displeasure / and
by the faith and lignage that ye owe to me / that ye yield up the garyson of
Lourde in to my hands. When the knight herd these words he was sore abashed
/ and studied a little / remembringe what answer he might make / for he saw
well the Earl spoke in good faith. How be it all things consydred he said.
Sir / true it is I own to you faith and homage / for I am a poor knight of
yo^ blood and of your country: But as for the castle of Lourde / I will not
deliver it to you / ye have sent for me / do with me as ye list. I hold it of
the king of England he set me there / and to none other lyueng will I
deliver it. When the earl of Foyz herd that answer his blood chafed for ire /
and said drawyng out his daggar: A treatour / say thou nay? By my heed thou
have not said that for naught: and so therewith struck the knight that he
wounded him in five places / and there was no knight nor barone yt durst step
between them: Than the knight said. Ah sit / ye do me no gentylnesse / to send
for me and slay me. And yet for all the strokes that he had with the daggar /
therle commanded to cast him in prison down in to a deep dyke / and so he was
and there dyed / for his wounds were but yuell looked unto. Ah saint Mary quod I
to the knight / Was not this a great cruelty? Whatsoever it was quod the
knight thus it was. Let one advise him well or he displease him / for and he
be angry there is no pardon. He held ones his cosyn germayne the vicou^t of
Chateau Bein / who is his heryter eight months in the tower of Ortaise in
prison / and after rau^somed him at forty thousand frankes. Why sir quod I /
has the earl of Foyz no children? No truly sir quod he by any wife / but he
has two young knights yt be his bastardes / whom ye shall se / and he loves
them as well as him self / they be called sir Johan and sir Gracyen / Than I
demanded if ever he were married. yea truly quod he / and is yet / but his
wife is not with him. Why sir where is she? Sir quod he she is in Nauar / for
the king there is her cosyn / she was daughter to king Loyes of Nauar. yet
than I demanded if ever the earl had any children. yes sir quod he / he had a
fair son who had the fathers heart / and all the country loved him / for by
him all the country of Biern was in rest and peace / where as it has been since
in debate and strife / for he had married the suster of therle of Armynake. Sir
quod I / what became of that son / and it may be known? Sir quod he I shall
show you / but not as now / for the matter is over long / and we are nere the
town / as ye se. Therewith I left the knight in peace and so we came to Tarbe /
and took our lodging at the Star / and there tarried all that day / for it
was a town of great easement / both for man and horse / with good hay and
otes and a fair river.

THe next day after mass we mounted a horsbacke / and departed fro Tarbe /
and came to a town called Iorre / which valyantlye always held against them
of Lourde: and so we passed by the town without / and than entered in to the
country of Bierne. Than the knight stood still and said. Sir / behold here is
Bierne / and we stood in a cross way: The knight aduysed bym which way to
take / outher to Morlens or to Pan. At last we took the way to Morlens /
ridynge over the lau^des of Bierne / which were right plain. Thafie I
demanded of him / if the town of Pan were nere us / and he said yes: and
so he showed me the steple. How be it the distau^ce was farther of than it
seemed / for it was anyuel way to ride because of the myres / to the^ that knew
not the country / and not far thens was the castle of Lourde: and I
demanded who was as than captain there / He said. that as than the
seneschall of Bigore was captain there / admytted by the king of England /
brother to ser Peter of Bierne (as ye have herd before) That is true sir quod
I: But did he never after go to se the earl of Foiz / He answered and said.
Sith the death of his brother he never came there / but other of his company
has been often with the earl / as Peter Dauchyn / Erualton of Restue / Erualton
of saint Colome / and other. Sir quod I / has the earl of Foiz made any
amends for the death of that knight / or sorry for his death? yes truly sir
quod he / he was right sorry for his death / but as for amends I know of none
/ without it be by secret penance / masses / or prayers: He has with him
the same knights son called Johan of Byerne a gracyous squire / and the earl
loves him right well. Ah sir quod I / the duke of Aniowe who that would so
feign have the castle of Lourde / ought to be well content with the earl of
Foyz / when he slew such a knight his own cosyn / for to accomplysshe his
desire. By my faith sir quod he / so he was: For anon after that the duke
came to the French king / the king sent in to this country sir Roger of
Spaygne / and a presydent of the parlyament chamber of Paris / and letters
sealed / making mention how the king did give to the earl of Foiz the
cou^tie of Bygore / during his life / to hold ye same of the crown of
France. The Earl thanked greatly the king / for the great love that he showed
him / and for that great gift / without any request making. But for all that
the said sir Roger of Spaygne could do^ say / or show / the earl in no wise
would take the gift / but he took the castle of Maluoysin / because it was a
fre land: For that castle and the purteynau^ce holds of no man / but of
God: and also auncyently it parteyneth to his enherytaunce. The french king by
the means of the duke of Aniowe / did give it him: And the earl swear and
promised to take it on a condycion / that he should never set man there that
should do any yuell to the realm of France: and so he did / For such as
were there feared as much thenglisshe men / as any other French garysons in
Gascoyne / but the Bernoyse durst not tonne in to the country of Foyz.

How the peace was made bitwene the duke of Berry and therle of Foiz and of
the beginning of the war / that was bitwene therle of Foiz and the earl of
Armynake. Cap. xxv.
ALl these matters that sir Espayne de Leon showed me / right well contented me
/ and every night as soon as we were at our lodgings / I wrote ever al^ that I
herd in the day / the better thereby to have the^ in remembrance / for writing
is the best remembrance that may be^ and so we rode the said morning to
Morlens but are we came there I said. sir / I have forget to demand of you /
when ye showed me the adventures of Foiz / did dissymule with the duke of
Berrey / who had to wives / the daughter and suster of therle of Armynake / and
wheder that the duke of Berry made him any war / and how he did: How he did
quod the knight I shall show you. In time past the duke of Berrey would him as
much yuell as he could ymagyn / but as now / by means which ye shall hereof
when ye come to Ortaise / they be accorded. Why sir quod I / was there any
cause why the duke should be displeased with him? As help me god quod the
knight non / but I shall show you the cause. When Charles the french king /
father to king Charles that now is was dyssessed / the realm of France was
divided in two parts / as in the gouernyng thereof. For the duke of Aniou who
intended to go in to Italy as he did / he gave us the rule: and than his two
brethren the duke of Berry and the duke of Burgoyne had ye rule. The duke of
Berry had the gouernynge of Languedocke / and the duke of Burgoyne ruled
Languedoyle and Picardy. When they of Languedocke understood yt the duke of
Berry had the gouernyng over them / they were sore abashed / and specially
they of Tholous / for they knew well that ye duke was a sore taker of gold
and silver / and a sore oppressar of the people. Also there was in Carcassone
and in Rouergue / bretons and tholousins which the duke of Aniou had left in
the country and they robbed and pylled: and the brute ran / yt the duke of
Berry maynteyned them / to the^tent to over master ye good towns. but in this
season that I speak of / the duke of Berrey was not in the country there / he
was with the king in Flanders. They of Tholous who be great and puissant /
parceyued how the french king was young / and was greatly busyed in Flaunders
/ for the aid of his uncle the duke of Burgoyn. And they saw well how they
were daily robbed and pilled by the britons and other / so that they wyste not
what to do. Than they sent and treated with the earl of Foiz / desyring him for
a certain so^me of money that they offered him every month to be paid / that
he would take on him the gouernynge of Tholous / and of the country of
Tholousin: and also he was desired of other towns in likewise. they desired
him because they knew him for a just man and a rightwyse in justice /
redouted of his enemies / and fortunate in all his business / and also they of
Tholous loved him / for he had been ever to them a good neighbor. Thus he took
on him the charge and the gouernynge / and swear to maynteyne and keep the
country in their right against all men that would do any wrong thereto /
reseruyng all only the french kings person. Than he set men of war to
watch the ways and passages / where as these robbers and pyllars used to
pass / and on a day he took / slew and drowned of them at Robeston in
Tholousin mo than four hundred / whereby he gate great grace and honor of them
of Tholous and of Carcassone of Besyers / and Mountpellyer / and of other good
towns there about / so that the renome ran in France / how they of
Languedoke were turned / and had taken to their lord the earl of Foyz. And
the duke of Berry who was sovereign there / took thereat great displeasure: and
had therle of Foiz in great hate / because he meddled so far in the business
of France / and whereby he maynteyned them of Tholous / still in their
rebellyon against him. Than he sent men of war in to the country / but they
were fiersly driven back again by the earls men / so that wheder they would
or no they were feign to draw back / orels they had lost more than they
should have won. With this the duke of Berrey was sore displeased with the earl
of Foiz / and he said: How therle of Foiz was the most presumptuous and
proudest knight of all the world: The duke as than could suffer no good to be
spoken of him / how be it he made him no war / for the earl of Foiz had
always his towns and castelles so well provided for / that none durst enter
in to his land. But when the duke of Berry came in to Languedocke than he left
his rule / for he would tha^ no lengar exercise against the duke / but the
displeasure rested still after a certain space: But now shall I show you by
what means the peace was norisshed between them.

IT was a ten year paste that the lady Ellyanour of Comynges / as now
countess of Bouloyne / and nere cosyn to therle of Foiz / and right enherytour
to the county of Comynges / though that the earl of Armynake had it in
possession. She came to Ortaise to therle of Foiz / and brought with her a
young daughter of three year of age. Therle her cosyn made her good chere / and
he demanded her of her busynesse^and wheder she was going. Sir quod she / I
am going in to Arragon to mine uncle and Aunte / the earl of Vrgell / and
there I purpose to abide: For I have great displeasure to abide with my
husband sir Johan of Boloyne / for I thought he would have recovered mine
enherytaunce of Comynges fro the earl of Armynake / who keeps it fro me: And
he has my suster in prisone / and he will do no thing in the matter: He is so
soft a knight that he will do nothing / but take his ease and eat and drink
/ and to spend that he has folysshlye: and I think when he is earl / he will
take his pleasure more. Therefore I will no lengar abide with him / and I have
brought with me my daughter / whom I will deliver in to your hands / prayenge
you to keep and to norisshe her up / for I trust by reason of her lygnage / ye
will not fail thus to do / for I have hoope in you that ye will keep her. I
had much pain to get her away out of the country / and out of the hands
of my husband her father: But because I take the^ of Armynake mine adversaries
and yours^ who would gladly steal my daughter away / because she is
enherytour of Comynges / therefore I have brought her unto you. Wherefore sir / I
require you fail me not at this business: And I am sure her father my
husband when he knows yt I have left her with you / he will be right
joyful* For he has said often times to me / that this his daughter should put
him to great doubt. And when the earl had well herd the words of the lady
Elyanour his cosyn he was right joyful: And ymagined in him self / how that
child after should do him some pleasure / as by the means of her mother / to
have a ferme peace with his enemies / or else to marry her in so high a place /
that his enemies should doubt him thereby: Than he answered the lady and said.
Madame and cosyn / all that ye desire I shall do it with right a good will / for
I am bound thereto by lynage: and as for your daughter my cosyn I shall keep
her as well / as though she were mine own proper child. Sir quod she / I
thank you. Thus the young daughter of Bouloyne abode with the earl of Foiz at
Ortaise / and she never departed thens sith: and the lady her mother went to
Arragon. She has been sith ones or twyse tose her daughter / but she never
desired to have her again / for therle kept her as well as if she were his
own child. And to the purpose as to the mean of the peace that I showed you
/ the earl ymagined to get by her / the love again of the duke of Berrey:
And as now at this present time the duke of Berry has great desire to be
married: and I think by that I herd at Auygnon by the Pope / who is cosyn
germayne to the ladies father. He showed me how the duke of Berrey desires to
have her in marriage. Ah saint Mary sir quod I / how your words be to me right
agreeable / for it has done me great pleasure / all that ever ye have showed me
which shall not be lost / for it shall be put in remembrance and cronycled
/ if god will send me the grace to return to the town of Valence^nes /
where as I was borne. But sir / I am sore displeased of one thing. What is
that quod he? I shall show you. By my faith that so high and valyant a
prince as the Earl of Foiz is / should be without laufull issue. sir quod the
knight / if he had one as ones he had / he should be the most ioyouse prince of
the world / and so would be all the country. Why sir than quod I / is his
land than without an heir? Nay sir quod he / the Vycount of the castle Bone
his cosyn germayne is his heir. Is he a valyant man in arms quod I? Nay be my
faith sir quod he / and therefore the Earl loves him not / and thinks to
make his two bastard sons / who be right valyant / his heirs. and thinks
to marry them in an high lygnage / for he has gold and silver enough /
whereby he thinks to get them wives / such as shall aid and conforte
them. Sir quod I / it may well be. How be it the thing is not reasonable /
that bastardes should be made herytours of lands Wherefore not sir quod he / if
there lack good heirs. Se you not how the spaynierdes have crowned Henry a
bastard to be king? and also they of Portyngale crowned a bastard to their
king. It has been seen in the world in diverse realms / that bastardes by
force has reigned. Was not Wyllyam Conqueror bastard son to a duke of
Normandy / who conquered all England / and was king there / so that all the
kings sith are descended fro him? Sir quod I / all this might well be / there
is no thing but that may fall / but they of Armynake are right strong: and so
thereby this country shall be ever in war and strife. but sir / I pray you
show me the just cause why the war first moved between them of Foiz and
Armynake. I will show you quod the knight. I ensure you it is a marvelous
war / for as they say / each of the^ have cause. Sir aunciently about a
hundred year past / there was a lord in Byerne called Gascone / a right
valyant man in arms / and is buried in the freres right solempnely at Ortaise
/ and there ye may se what person he was of stature and of body / for in his
life time his pycture was made in latin / the which is yet there. This Gascone
lord of Bierne had two daughters / the eldest was married to the earl of
Armynake that was than^e / and the youngest to the earl of Foiz / who as than
was nephue to the king of Aragon / and as yet therle of Foiz bears his arms
/ for he descended out of Aragon his arms are palle gold and goules: And so
it fortuned / that this lord of Biern had a great war against the king of
Spain that was than / who came through all Bisquay with a great nombre of men of
war to enter in to Bierne. The lord Gascone of Bierne when he was informed
of his coming / he assembled people on all sides / where he might get men of
war / and wrote letters to his two sons in law / therle of Armynake and
therle of Foiz / yt they should come to serve and aid him to defend his
heritage. These letters seen / the earl of Foiz as soon as he might assembled
his people / and prayed all his friends / so much / that he had a five hundred
knights and squiers armed / and two thousand varlettes with spears / darts
/ and pauesses / all a foot: And so he came in to the country of Bierne to
serve his father / who had of him great joy. And so all they passed the bridge
at Ortaise over the river / and lodged between Sanetere and thospytall. and the
king of Spain / who had.xx.M. men was lodged not far thens and there the lord
Gascon of Bierne and therle of foiz tarried for therle of Armynac / and thought
ever yt he would come. and so tarried for hi three days and on the.iiii. day
therle of Armynac sent his letters by an haraulde to the lord Gascoine of
Bierne / and sent him word how he might not come / nor how he had nothing
to do to bear arms for the country of Bierne. When the lord Gascoyne herd
those tidings of excusacions / and saw how heshulde have none aid nor
conforte of the Earl of Armynake / he was sore abashed / and demanded
counsel of the earl of Foiz / and of the other barons of Bierue / how they
should maynteyne the^ self. Sir quod the earl of Foiz / sith we be here
assembled let us go and fight with our enemies. this counsel was taken / than
they ordained their people / they were a twelfe hundred men of arms and six
thousand men a foot. The earl of Foiz took the first battle / and so came on
the king of Spaygne and set on his lodgings. And there was a great battle
and a fierce and slain mo than ten thousand spayniardes / and there therle of
Foiz took prisoners the king of Spaygnes son and his brother / and sent them
to his father in law the lord Gascoyne of Bierne / who was in the areregarde.
and there the spaynyerdes were so disconfyted / that the earl of Foiz chased
them to the port saint Adrian in Bisquay / and the king of Spain took the
abbey / and did on the vesture of a monk or else he had been taken. Than the
earl of Foiz returned to the lord Gascone of Bierne / who made him good chere
/ as it was reason / for he had saved his honor and kept his country of
Bierne / the which else was lykely to have been lost / because of this battle
and disconfyture that the earl of Foiz made on the spaygnierdes and for the
taking of the kings son and brother / and the lord of Bierne had peace
with the spaygnierdes / at his own will: And when the lord Gascoyne was
returned to Ortaise / there before all the barons of Foiz and Bierne / that
were there present: Hesayd to his son of Foiz. Fair son / ye are my true
and faithful son / ye have saved mine honor and my country. The earl of
Armynake who has married mine eldest daughter / has ercused him self fro this
business / and would not come to defend mine heritage wherein he should have
part / Wherefore I say / that such part as he should have by reason of my
daughter / he has forfait and lost it / And here clearly I enheryte you my
son of Foiz after my dyscease of all the hoole land / and to your heirs for
ever. And I desire / will / and command all my subjects / to seal / accord
/ and agree to the same. And all answered / how they were well content so to
do. Thus by this means / as I have showed you / aunciently the earls of Foiz
were lords of the country of Bierne / and bare the cry / arms / and name:
and had the profit thereof. How be it / for all this they of Arminake had not
their clay me quyte. This is the cause of the war by / twene Foiz and
Armynake. By my faith sir than quod I / ye have well declared the matter; I
never herd it before. And now yt I know it / I shall put it in perpetual
memory / if god give me grace to return in to my country. But sir / if I
durst I would feign demand of you one thing. by what insydent the earl of
Foiz son dyed? Thafie the knight studied a little and said. Sir / the manner
of his death is right pytuous / I will not speak thereof: When ye come to
Ortaise / ye shall find the^ that will show you if ye demand it: And than I
held my peace / and we rode till we came to Morlens.

Of the great vertuousnesse and largess that was in therle of Foiz / and the
manner of the pytuouse death of Gascone the earls son. Cap. xxvi.
THe next day we departed and roode to Dinner to Mou^tgarbell and so to Ercye /
and there we drank: And by son setting we came to Ortaise. The knight a
lighted at his own lodging and I a lyghted at the Moon / where dwelte a squier
of the earls Erualton de Pyne / who well received me / because I was of
France. Sir Spain of Leon went to the castle to therle and found him in
his galarye / for he had but dyned a little before: For the earls usage was
always / that it was high noone or he arose out of his bed / and supped
ever at mydnight The knight showed him how I was come thider / and incontinent
I was sent for to my ladgynge / for he was the lord of all the world yt
most desired to speak with strangers / to here tidings. When the earl saw
me he made me good chere and retained me as of his house / where me was /
because I had brought with me a book / which I made at the conte^placion of
Vmslance of Boesme / duke of Luzenbourge and of Brabant: Which book was called
the Melyader / conteyninge all the songs / baladdes / rundeaux / and vyrelayes
/ which the gentle duke had made in his time / which by imagynacyon I had
gadered toguyder / which book the earl of Foiz was glad to se. And every
night after supper I reed thereon to him / and while I reed / there was none
durst speak any word / because he would I should be well understand / wherein
he took great solace. And when it came to any matter of questyon / than he
would speak to me / not in Gascoyne / but in good and fair french. And of his
estate and house I shall somewhat record / for I tarried thereso long / that I
might well parceyue and know much. This earl Gascone of Foiz with whom I was
/ at yt time he was of a fyftie year of age and nine: and I say / I have in my
time seen many knights / kings / princes and other / but I never saw none
like him / of personage nor of so fair form / nor so well made. His vysage
fair / sanguyne / and smylyng: his eyes gray and amorous / where as he list to
set his regard: in every thing he was so parfite that he can not be praised to
much. He loved that ought to be beloved / and hated that ought to be hated: He
was a wise knight / of high enterprise / and of good counsel: he never had
myscreant with him: He said many orisons / every day a nocturne of the psalter
/ matyns of our lady / of the holy ghost / and of the cross: and dirige every
day. he gave five florens in small money at his gate to poor folks / for the
love of god: he was large and courtesse in gifts: He could right well take
where it parteyned to him / and to deliver again where as he ought: He loved
hou^des of all beestes winter and somer: He loved huntyng: he never loved folly
outrage nor folly larges: Every month he would know what he spended. He took
in his country to receive his revenues and to serve him notable persons / that
is to say.xii. receyuouts / and ever fro.ii. months to two months / two of
them should serve for his receyte: For at the two months end / he would
change and put other two in to that office / and one that he trusted best
should be his comptroller / and to him all other should account: and the
comptroller should account to him by rolls and books written / and thacco^ptes
to remain still with therle. he had certain cofers in his chamber / out of
the which often times he would take money to give to lords / knights / and
squyers / such as came to him: for none should depart fro him without some
gift and yet daily multiplied his treasure / to resyst the adue^tures and
fortunes that he douted: He was of good and easy acquayntance with every man /
and amorously would speak to the^: He was short in counsel and answers: He
had four secretaries / and at his risyng they must ever be ready at his hand
without any calling. And when any letter were delivered him / and that he had
reed it / than he would call them to write again / or else for some other
thing. In this estate therle of Foiz lived / and at mydnight when he came out
of his chamber in to the hall to supper / he had ever before him.xii. torches
brennyng / borne by.xii. varlettes standing before his table all supper: they
gave a great light / and the hall ever full of knights and squyers / and many
other tables dressed to suppe who would: There was none should speak to him at
his table but if he were called: his meat was lightlye wild soul / the
legs and wings alonely / and in the day he did but little eat and drike: He
had great pleasure in armony of instruments / he could do it right well him
self: he would have songs song before him: he would gladlye se conseytes and
fantesies at his table. And when he had seen it / than he would send it to ye
other tables / bruely all this I consydred and advised. And or I came to his
court I had been in many courts of kings / dukes / princes / earls and great
ladies / but I was never in none yt so well liked me / nor there was none more
reioysed deeds of arms / than the earl did. There was seen in his hall /
chamber / and court / knights and squyers of honor going up and down / and
talkyng of arms and of amors. All honor there was found / all manner of
tidings of every realm and country there might be herd for out of every
country there was resort / for the valyantnesse of this earl. There I was
enfourmed of the most part of the deeds of arms yt was done in Spain / in
Portyngale / in Aragon / in Nauar / in England / and in Scotland and in the
fronters and lymitacions of La^gue docke: For I saw come thither to therle
while I was there / knights and squyers of all nacyons: And so I was informed
by them and by the earl him self of all things that I demanded. There I
enq^red how Gascon therles son died for ser Espayn of Leon would not show me
any thing thereof. and somoch I enq^red / yt an ancient squire and a notable
ma^shewed ye matter to me / and began thus. True it is quod he / that the earl
of Foiz and my lady of Foiz his wife agrees not well toguyder / nor have not
done of a long season. And the discord between the^ first moved by the king of
Nauar / who was brother to the lady: For the king of Nauar pledged him self
for the lord Dalbret / whom the earl of Foiz had in prisone / for the so^me of
fyftie thousand frankes. And the earl of Foiz / who knew that the king of
Nauarr was crafty and malycious / in the beginning would not trust him /
wherwt the countess of Foiz had great displeasur and indignacyon against the
earl her husband / and said to him. Sir / ye repute but small honor in the
king of Nauar my brother / wha^ ye will not trust him for fyftie.M. frankes /
though ye have no more of the armynakes nor of the labrisyence than ye have /
it ought to suffyce. and also ser / ye know well ye should assign out my
dower / which mou^teth to fyftie thousand fra^kes / which ye should put in
to the hands of my brother the king of Nauarr: Wherefore sir / ye can not be
yuell paid. Dame quod he ye say truth / but if I thought that the king of
Nauarr would stop the payment for that cause / the lord Dalbret should never
have gone out of Ortayse / and so I should have been paid to the last penny.
And sith ye desire it I will do it / not for the love of you but for the love
of my son. So by these words and by the king of Nauars oblygacion / who
became dettoure to the earl of Foiz / the lord Dalbret was delivered quyte and
became french / and was married in France / to the suffer of the duke of
Burbone and paid at his ease to the king of Nauar the so^me of fyftie
thousand frankes for his ransom: For the which so^me the king was bound to
therle of Foiz / but he would not send it to the earl. Than the earl of Foiz
said to his wife Dame / ye must go in to Navarre to the king your brother /
and show him how I am not well content with him / that he will not send me
that he has received of mine. the lady answered / how she was ready to go at
his commandment. And so she departed and rode to Panpylone to the king her
brother / who received her with much joy / the lady did her message fro point
to point. Than the king answered / fair suster / the so^me of money is yours /
therle should give it for your dowre / it shall never go out of the realm of
Nauarr / sith I have it in possessyon. Ah sir quod ye lady / by this ye shall
set great hate between therle my husband and you / and if ye hold your
purpose / I dare not retoure again in to the county of Foiz / for my husband
will slay me / he will say I have disceyued him. I can not tell quod the king
what ye will do / outher tarry or deperte / but as for the money I will not
depart fro it / it parteyneth to me to keep it for you / but it shall never go
out of Nauer. the countess could have none other answer of the king her
brother. And so she tarried still in Nauar and durst not return again. The
earl of Foiz when he saw the dealing of the king of Nauar / he began to hate
his wife and was yuell content with her / how be it she was in no fault / but
that she returned not again when she had done her message / but she durst
not: for she knew well therle her husband was cruel where he took
displeasure. Thus the matter stands. The earls son called Gascone / grew
and waxed goodly / and was married to the daughter of therle of Armynake a fair
lady / suster to therle that now is / The lord Bertrande of Armynake. and by
the contu^ctyon of that marriage / there should have been peace between Foiz and
Armynake. The child was a fyftene or sixtene year of age / and resembled
rightwell to his father: On a time he desired to go into Nauar to se his mother
and his uncle the king of Nauarr / which was in anyuell hour for him and for
all this country. When he was come in to Navarre / he had there good there /
and tarried with his mother a certain space and than took his leave: but for
all that he could do / he could not get his mother out of Nauer / to have
gone with him in to Foiz / for she demannded if the earl had commanded him so
to do or no: and he answered / that when he departed / therle spoke nothing
thereof. Therefore the lady durst not go thider / but so tarried still / Than the
child went to Panpylone to take his leave of the king his uncle. The king
made him great chere and tarried him there a ten days / and gave to him great
gifts and to his men: also the last gift that the king gave him was his
death. I shall show you how.

When this ge^tylman should depte / the king drew him a part in to his
chamber and gave him a little purse full of poudre / which poudre was such /
that if any creature lyueng did ete thereof / he should inco^tynent dye without
remedy: Than the king said / Gascone fair nephue / ye shall do as I shall
show to you: ye se how the earl of Foiz your father / wrongfully has your
mother my suster in great hate / where of I am sore displeased / and so ought ye
to be: How be it to perform all the matter / and that your father should love
again your mother / to that intent ye shall take a little of this powder / and
put it on some meat that your father may eat it / but beware that no man se
you. and as soon as he has eaten it / he shall entende to nothing / but to
have again his wife / and so to love her ever after / which ye ought greatly
to desire: And of this that I show you let no man know / but keep it secret
/ or else ye lose all the deed. The child who thought all that the king said to
him had been true / said. Sir / it shall be done as ye have devised / and so
departed fro Panpylone and returned to Ortayse / the earl his father made him
good chere / and demanded tidings of the king of Nauar / and what gifts he
had given him. And the child showed him how he had given him diverse / and
showed him all except the purse with the powder. Often times this young Gascone
and yuan his bastard brother lay toguyder / for they loved toguyder like
brethren / and were like arrayed and apparelled / for they were nere of a
greatness and of one age. And it happened on a time as their clothes lay
toguyder on their beds / yuan saw a purse at Gascons cote / and said. What
thing is this that ye bear ever about you? Whereof Gascoyne had no joy / and
said. yuan / give me my cote / ye have nothing to do therewith: and all that day
after Gascone was pensive. And it fortuned a three days after / as god would /
that the earl should be saved. Gascone and his brother yuan fell out toguyder
playeng at tennes / and Gascone gave him a blow: and the child went in to
his fathers chamber and wept / and the earl as than had herd mass. And
when the earl saw him weep he said. Son yuan / What aylest thou? Sir quod he
/ Gascone has beaten me / but he were more worthy to be beaten than I. Why so
quod therle? and incontinent suspected some thing. By my faith sir quod he /
sith he returned out of Nauar / he bears privily at his breast a purse full
of powder / I wot not what it is / nor what he will do therewith. But he has
said to me ones or twyse / that my lady his mother should shortly be again
in your grace / and better be loved than ever she was. Peace quod the earl and
speak no more / and show this to no man lyuenge. Sir quod he no more I shall.
Than the earl entered in to ymaginacyon^ and so came to the hour of his dinner /
and washed and sat down at his table in the hall. Gascone his son was used to
set down all his service / and to give the says. And when he had set
down the first course / the earl cast his eyes on him / and saw the strings
of the purse hangyng at his bosom: Than his blood changed and said. Gascone
come byder / I will speak with the in thine ear. The child came to him / and
the earl took him by the bosom and found out the purse / and with his knyfe
cut it fro his bosom. the child was abashed and stood still and spoke no
word and looked as pale as ashes for fear / and began to trymble. The earl of
Foiz opyned the purse and took of the powder / and laid it on a trenchour of
bredde / and called to him a dog and gave it him to eat: and as soon as the
dog had eaten the first morsel / he turned his eyes in his heed and dyed
incontynent^. And whan^e the earl saw that he was sore displeased / and also
he had good cause: and so rose fro the table and took his knife / and would
have stryken his son. Than the knights and squyers ran between them and said.
Sir / for gods sake have mercy / and be not so hastye: Be well informed first
of the matter / or ye do any yuell to your child. And the first word that
therle said was. A gascone treatour / for to increase thine heritage yt should
come to the / I have had war and hatered / of the French king / of the king
of England / of the king of Spain / of the king of Nauar / and of the king of
Arragon. and as yet I have borne all their malesses / and now you would
murder me / it moves of an yuell nature / but first thou shall dye with this
stroke / and so stepped forth with his knife and would have slain him / but
than all the knights and squyers kneled down before him weeping / and said.
Ah sir / have mercy for gods sake / ^^ee not Gascone your son / remember /
ye have d^ more children. Sir / cause him to be kept / and take good
enformacion of the matter. Paradnenfure he knew not what he bare / and
paraduenture is nothing gyltie of the deed. Well quod the earl incontinent put
him in prisone / and let him be so kept / that I may have a reconyng of him.
Than the child was put in to the tower. and the earl took a great many of them
that served his son / and some of them departed / and as yet the bishop of
Lascalle is at Pan out of the country / for he was had in suspect / and so were
diverse other. Therle cansed to be put to death a fyftene right horribly / and
the cause that the earl laid to them was / he said. It could be none
otherwise / but that they knew of ye chyldes secrets / wherefore they ought to
have showed it to him / and to have said. Sir / Gascone your son bears a
purse at his bosom. Because they did not thus / they dyed horribly / whereof
it was great pytie / for some of the^ were as fresshe and as ioly squyers / as
were any in all the country / for ever the earl was served with good men. This
thing touched the earl nere to the heart / and that he well showed: For on a
day he assembled at Ortaise / all the nobles and prelates of Foiz and of Bierne
/ and all the notable persons of his country. And when they were all assembled
/ he showed them wherefore he sent for the^ / as how he had found his son
in this defaute: For the which he fayd / his intent was to put him to death
/ as he had well deserved. Than all ye people answered to that case with one
voice / and said. Sir / saving your grace / we will not that Gascoyne should
dye / he is your heir / and ye have no mo. And when the earl herd the people
how they desired for his son / he so^what refrayned his ire. Than he thought
to chastyce him in prisone a month or two / and than to send him on some
voyage for two or three year / till he might somewhat forget his yuell will / and
that the child might be of greatter age and of more knowledge Than he gave
leave to all the people to depart but they of Foiz would not depart fro
Ortaise till the earl should assure them / that Gascoyne should not dye: they
loved the child so well. Than the earl promised them / but he said: he would
keep him in prisone a certain space to chastise him. And so upon this promise
every man departed / and Gascone abode still in prisone. These tidings spredde
abroad in to diverse places / and at that time pope Gregory the.xi. was at
Auygnon. Than he sent the cardynall of Amyens in legacion in to Byerne: to
have come to therle of Foiz for that business. and by that time he came to
Besiers he herd such tidings / that he neded not to go any further for that
matter / for there he herd how Gascon son to the earl of Foyz was deed.
Sithe I have showed you so much / now shall I show you how he dyed.

THe earl of Foyz caused his son to be kept in a dark chamber / in the
tower of Ortayse a ten days / little did he eat or drink / yet he had
enough brought him every day: but when he saw it he would go therfro / and
set little thereby. And some said / that all the meat that had been brought
him stood hole and entier / the day of his death: wherefore it was great
marueyle that he lived so long / for diverse reasons. The earl caused him to be
kept in the chamber alone without any company / outher to counsel or
conforte him. And all that season the child lay in his clothes as he came in
/ and he argued in him self and was full of malencoly / and cursed the time
that ever he was borne and engendered / to come to such an end. The same day
that he dyed they that served him of meat and drink / when they came to him /
they said. Gascone / here is meat for you: he made no care thereof / and
said: Set it down there. He that served him / regarded and saw in the
prison all the meat stand hole as it had been brought him before: And so
departed and closed the chamber door / and went to the earl and said. Sir / for
gods sake have mercy on your son Gascone / for he is nere famysshed in
prisone there he lies. I think he never did eat any thing sithe he came in
to prisone / for I have seen there this day / all that ever I brought him
before / lyeng toguyder in a corner. Of those words the Earl was sore
dyspleased / and without any word spekyng went out of his chamber / and came
to the prisone where his some was / and in anyuell hour. He had the same time
a little knyfe in his hand to pare withal his nails: He opyned the prisone
door and came to his son and had the little knyfe in his hand / not an ynche
out of his hand. And in great dyspleasure he thruste his hand to his sons
throat / and the point of the knife a little entered in to his throat in to a
certain vain / and said. Ah treatour / Why do not thou eat thy meat? And
therewith the Earl departed without any more doing or saying / and went in to
his own chamber. The child was abashed and afraid of the coming of his
father / and also was feeble of fasting / and the point of the knyfe a little
entered in to a vain of his throat / and so fell down suddenly and dyed. The
earl was scante in his chamber / but the kepar of the child came to him and
said. Sir / Gascone your son is deed. Deed quod the Earl? yea truly sir quod
he. The earl would not believe it / but sent thither a squire that was by him /
and he went and came again and said. Sir / surely he is deed. Than the Earl
was sore displeased / and made great complaynt for his son / and said. A
Gascone: What a poor aducnture is this for the and for me? In an yuell hour
thou wentest to Nauar to se thy mother: I shall never have ye joy that I had
before. Than therle caused his harbor to shave him / and clothed him self in
black / and all his house. and with much sore weeping / the child was borne
to the Freres in Ortaise / and there buried. Thus as I have showed you / the
earl of Foyz slew Gascoyne his son / but the king of Nauar gave the
occasyon of his death.

How sir Peter of Byerne had a strong disease / and of the countess of
Bisquay his wife. Cap. xxvii.
When I had herd this tale of the death of Gascone son to the earl of Foyz /
I had great pytie thereof / for the love of therle his father / whom I found
a lord of high reco^mendacyon / noble / lyberall / and curtesse: And also for
love of the country / that should be in great strife tor lack of an heir.
Than I thanked the squire and so departed fro him / but after I saw him diverse
times in the earls house / and talked often times with him. And on a time I
demanded of him of sir Peter of Byerne / bastard brother to therle of Foyz
(because he seemed to me a knight of great valor) wheder he were rich / and
married or no. The squire answered and said. Truly he is married / but his wife
and children be not in his company: And why sir quod I? I shall show you quod
the squier. This sir Peter of Bierne has an usage / that in the night time
while he slepeth / he will rise and arm him self / and draw out his sword
and fight all about the house / and can not tell with whom / and than gothe
to bed again. And when he is waking / his seruautes do show him how he
did: And he would say / he knew nothymg thereof / and how they lied. sometime
his seruautes would leave non armure nor sword in his chamber. and when he
would thus rise and find non armor / he would make such a noise and rumoure /
as though all the deuylles of hell had been in his chamber. Than I demanded if
he had great lands by his wife. yes truly sir quod he: But the lady by whom
comes the land / ioyeth of the profytes thereof. This sir Peter of Bierne has
but the fourth part. Sir quod I / where is his wife? sir quod he she is in
Castle with the king her cosyn. her father was earl of Bisquay / and was
c^syn germayne to king Dampeter who slew him: and also he would have had the
lady to have put her in prisone. And he took the possession of all the land /
and as long as he lived the lady had nothing there. And it was said to this
lady / who was countess of Bisquay / after the dyssease of her father. Madame
/ save your self / for king Dampeter if he may get you / will cause you to
dye / or else put you in prisone. He is so sore displeased with you / because he
says ye should report and bear witness / yt he caused the queen his wife to
dye in her bed / who was suster to the duke of Burbone and suster to the
french queen / and your words (he says) are believed / rather than^e another
/ because ye were preuy of her chamber. And for this cause / the lady Florens
countess of Bisquay / departed out of her country with a small company / as
the common usage is: to fly fro death as nere as men can. So she went in to
the country of Bascles and passed through it / and so came hyder to Ortayse
to the Earl / and showed him all her adventure. The earl who had ever pity of
ladies and damoselles / retained her: and so she abode with the lady of Carase
/ a great lady in his country. As than this sir Peter of byerne his brother was
but a young knight / and had not thanne / this usage to rise a nyghtes / as he
does now. The earl loved him well and married him to this lady / and recovered
her land* And so this sir Peter had by this lady a son and a daughter / but
they be with their mother in Castle / who be as yet but young / therefore the
lady would not leave them with their father. Ah saint Mary quod I / how did
sir Peter of Bierne take this fantasy? First that he dare not sleep alone in
his chamber / and that when he is a sleep / ryseth thus and makes all that be
synesse / they are things to be marueyled at. By my faith quod the squire /
he has been often demanded thereof / but he says he can not tell whereof it
comes. The first time that ever he did so / was the night after that he had been on a day a hunting in the wodes of Bisquay / and chased a marvelous great
Bear: and ye bear had slain four of his hounds / and hurt diverse / so that
none durst come nere him. than this sir Peter took a sword of Burdeanx and
came in great ire / for because of his hounds / and assayles the bear and
fought long with him / and was in great parell / and took great pain or he
could overcome him. Finally he slew the bear / and than returned to his
lodgyng to the castle of La^guedon in Bisquay / and made the bear to be
brought with him. Every man had marueyle of the greatness of the beast and of
the hardness of ye knight / how he durst assail the bear. And whan^e the
countess of Bisquayes wife saw ye bear / she fell in a sown and had great
dolor / and so she was borne in to her chamber / and so all that day / the
night after / and the next day she was sore disconforted / and would not show
what she ayled. On the third dayeshe said to her husband: Sir / I shall not
be hoole / till I have been a pylgrimage at saint James. Sir / I pray you give
me leave to go thither / and to have with me my son and Adrian my daughter:
her husband agreed thereto. She took all her gold / towels / and treasure with
her / for she thought never to return again / where of her husband took no
head. So the lady did her pylgrimage / and made an errande to go and se the
king of Castle her cosyn / and the queen. They made her good chere / and there
she is yet / and will not return again / nor send her children. And so thus
the next night that this sir Peter had thus chased the bear and slain him /
while he slept in his bed / this fa^tasy took him. And it was said / that the
countess his wife knew well / as soon as she saw the bear / that it was the
same that her father did ones chase. And in his chasyng / he herd a voice and
saw nothing / that said to him. Thou chasest me and I would the no hurt /
therefore thou shall dye any yuell death. Of this the lady had remembrance /
when she saw the bear / by that she had herd her father say before: and she
remembered well how king dan Peter struck of her fathers heed / without any
cause / and in likewise she feared her husband. And yet she say the and
maynteyneth / yt he shall dye of an yuell death / and that he does nothing as
yet / to that he shall do herafter.

Now sir / I have showed you of sir Peter of Byerue / as ye have deman^ded of
me / and this is a true tale / for thus it is / and thus it be fell. How
think you quod he thereby? and I who mused on the great marueyle said. sir / I
believe it well / that it is as ye have said. sir / we synde in old writing /
that au^ciently such as were called gods and goddesses / at their pleasure /
would change and transform men in to beestes and in to fowls / and in
likewise women. And it might be so / that this ^ere was before some knight
chasyng in the forest of Bisquay / and paraduenture displeased in yt time /
some god or gods / whereby he was transformed unto a bear / to do there his
penance / as aunciently Acteon was changed unto an heart. Acteon quod the
squire / I pray you show me that story / I would feign here it. Sir quod I
according to the ancient writings / we find how Acteon was a iolye and an
expert knight and loved the sport of hunting above all games. And on a day he
chased in the wodes / and an Heart arose before him / marvelous great and
fair: he hunted him all the day / and lost all his company / servants / and
hou^des / and he was right desirous to follow his pray. And followed the few of
the Harttyll he came in to a little medowe / closed round about with wodes and
high trees. And in the medowe there was a fair fountain / in the which
Dyana / goddess of Chastyte was bayninge her self / and her damoselles about
her. The knight ca^e suddenly on them or he was ware / and he was so far
forward / that he could not go back. And the damoselles were abasshad to se
a stranger / and ran to their lady and showed her / who was a shamed / because
she was naked. and when she saw the Knight she said. Acteon / they that sent
the hyder / loved the but little. I will not that when thou art gone hens in
other places / that thou should report that thou haste seen me naked / and
my damoselles. and for the outrage that thou have done / thou may have
penance. Therefore I will that thou be tranformed in the likeness of the Iame
Heart / that thou haste chased all this day, and inco^tynent Acteon was
turned unto an Heart / who naturally loves the water. In likewise it might be
of the bear of Bisquay: and how that the lady knew paraduenture / more than
she would speak of at that time / therefore she ought the better to be excused.
The squier answered and said. Sir / it may well be. Than we left our
talking for that time.

Of the great solemynetie that the earl of Foyz made at the feast of faint
Nycholas: and the tale that the Mastot of Banlyon showed to sir John^
Froyssart. Cap. xxviii.
Among other solemynities that the earl of Foyz kept on the high feestes of
the year / he kept ever the fest of saint Nycholas in great solemynytie / he
and all his land / as great as at the fest of Ester. And this was showed me by
a squier of his house the third day that I came hyder / and I saw it my self
right well apparent / for I was there on the same day. First all the clergy of
the town of Ortayse / and all the people / men / women / and children with
processyon came to the castle to fetch the earl / who all a foot departed fro
his castle / and went with the clergy a processyon to the church of saint
Nycholas / and there the clergy sange a psalm of the psalter. Benedictus
dominus deus meus, qui docet manus meas ad praelium, et digitos meos ad bell
lum. etc. And when this psalm was song / than they began to sing as they did
on Christmas day or Eester day / in the popes chapel or in the French kings
/ for he had with him many syngars / the bishop of Pauyers sange the mass /
and there I herd as good playeng at organs / as ever I herd in any place. to
speak breuely and according to reason / the earl of Foiz than was right parfyte
in all things / and as sage and as parceyuing / as any high prince in his
days. There was none could compare with him in wit / honor / nor in larges
At the feestes of Christmas which he kept ever right solemyne / came to his
house many knights and squyers of Gascone / and to every man he made good
there. There I saw the Burge of Spain / who laid the wodde and the Ass on
the fire toguyder / of whom sir Espayne de Lion showed of his force / and I was
glad to se him: and therle of Foiz made him good se^blant. There I saw also
knights of Aragon and of England of the duke of La^castres house / who as
than lay at Burdeux. The earl made them good chere and gave them great gifts
/ I acquaynted my self with those knights / and by them I was informed of
many things that fell in Castle / in Nauar / and in Portyngale: of the which
I shall speak of when time re^reth herafter. And on a day I saw asquyer of
Gascone called the Bastot of Manlyon / a man of a fyftie year of age / an
expert man of arms and a hardy / be semynge. He a lighted at my lodging in
Ortaise at the sign of the Moon / at Erualton de Pyns. He brought with him
his summers and caryages / as though he had been a great barone / and was served
both he and his servants in silver vessel. and when I herd his name and
saw therle of Foiz and every man do him so much honor. than I demanded of
sir Espaygne de Lion / and said. Sir / is not this the squire that departed fro
the castle of Trygalet / when the duke of Aniou lay at siege before
Maluoysin? yes truly quod he it is the same / and he is a good man of arms
and a good captain. and so than I fell in aquayntaunce with him / for he was
lodged there as I was. and a cosyn of his called Erualton capitayn of Carlate
in Auuergne / with whom I was well acquaynted / helped me to be aquainted with
him and in likewise so did the Burge of Compare and at a time as we were
talkyng and deuysinge of arms / sytting by the fire abiding for mydnight /
that therle should go to supper / than this squiers cosyn began to reken up his
life / and of the deeds of arms that he had been at. saying / how he had
endured as much loss as profit Than he demanded of me and said. sir John^
have ye in your history / any thing of this matters that I speak of? and I
answered and said. I could not tell / till I here the^ / show forth your
matter and I will gladly here you: For paradue^ture I have herd some what but
not all. that is true quod the squire / than he began to say thus. The first
time that I bare armure was under the captall of Beufz at ye battle of
Poyters. and as it was my hap / I had that day three prisoners / a knight and
two squiers / of who^e I had one with another four.E. thousand fra^kes. The
next year after I was in Pruce with the earl of Foyz and the Captall his son
/ under whom I was / and our return at Meulx in Brye / we found the duchess
of Normandy that was than / and the duchess of Orlyance / and a great nombre
of ladies and damoselles / who were closed in and besieged by them of the
Iaquery: and if god had not helped the^ / they had been enforsed and defouled /
for they were of great puissance / and in no^bre mo than ten thousand and the
ladies were alone / and so we in ye aid of those ladies did set on the^ /
and there were slain of the Iaquery mo than six thousand / and they rebelled
never sithe. at yt time it was truse between France and England / but the
king of Nauar made war in his own quarrel / against the french king and
Regent. the earl of Foiz returned in to his own country / but my master the
captall and I and other abode still with the king of Nauar for his wages. and
than we and other that aided us made great way in France / and specially in
Picardy / and took many towns and castelles in the bysshoprike / these of
Beauuoise and Amyens / and as than we were lords of the feldes and ryuers /
and conquered great fynance. And when the truse failed between England and
France / than the (...) of Navarre seized his war / and took a peace between
the Regent and him. Than the king of England with a great puyssance passed the sea / and came and laid siege to the town of Remus. Than the king of England
sent for my master who was at Cleremont in Beamoysin / and there made war
for the king against all the country. Than we came to the king of England
and to his children. and than ^^od the squire to me. Sir Johan / I think ye
know all ready all that matter / and how the king of England wedded his wife /
and how he came before Charters / and how the peace was made there between
these two kings. That is true sir quod I in writing I have it / and the
continue of all the treaties. Than the Bastot of Manlyon spoke again and
said. when this peace was thus made bitwene these two kings / It was ordained
/ that all men of war and companyo^s should a void / and leave their
fortresses and castles that they held. than all manner of men of war and
poor companyons drew toguyder / and the capitayns took counsel what they
should do. And than they said. Though these two kings have taken peace
toguyder / yet we must live. Than they went in to Burgoyne / and there were
capitayns of all nacyons / English / Gascons / Spany / ardes / Naue^o^se /
Almayns / Scotts / and of all manner of nacyons: and there I was as a captain
/ and there we found in Burgoyne and about the river of Loyre of our company /
a.xii. thousand of one and other. And in the same company there were a three or
four thousa^de of good and chosen men of war / and as subtell in all deeds of
arms as might be / and apt to advise a battle / and to take their advantage
/ and as hardy to scale and assail town or castle. and that was well seen at
ye bataile of Brinay / where as we ouerthrue the constable of france and therle
of Forestz / and two thousand spears knights and squiers. This vataile did
great profit to the co^panyons / for before they were but poor / and than
they were all rich by reason of good prisoners / towns and castles that they
wan in the bisshoprike of L^on / and on the river of Rone and when they had ^he
proont saint Esprite they departed their war / and made war to the pope and
to the cardynalles / who could not be quyte of them / nor had not ben till they
found another remedy. The pope sent in to Lo^bardy for the Marquis of
Mou^tferant a right valyant knight / who had war with the lord of Myllayne.
Wha^ he was come to Auignon the pope and the cardynals spoke to him in such
wise / that he entreted with the capitayns / English gascons / and almayns
for threscore thousand fra^kes / that the pope and cardynals should pay to
certain of these capitayns and to their co^panyes / as sir Johan Hastourde a
valyant english knight / sir Robert Briquet / Carsnell nandon le bagerant /
the bourge Camus / and diverse other: and so than went in to Lo^bardy / and gave
up ye pou^t saint Esprite. and of all their routes they took but the.vi. part
/ but we tarried be hynde. sir Seguin of Bate^oile / sir John^ ioell sir James
Pla^chyn / sir John^ Aymery / the burge of Piergourt / Espiot / Loys Ra^balt /
Lymosyn / Jacques tryturell / I / and diverse other. and we kept still and lay
at saint Clement / at Barell / at Terrare / at Brinay / at the pont saint Denis
/ at thospitall of Ortifart / for we had mo than.xl fortresses and houses / in
the conutreis of forestz / Velay / base Burgoyn / and on the river of Loyre and
we rau^somed all the country / they could not be quyte of us / another for payng
well nor otherwise. and in a night we took the fortress of Charity / and there
we abode a year and a half and all was ours fro Charity to Puy in Auuergne:
sir Seguyn of Batefoile had left his garrison of anse and held Bride in
Auuerne / whereby he had great profit / what there and in the country / to the
value of a.C.M. frankes / and on the river of Loyre to Orlians and the river of
Dalyer was all ours. and the archprest who was captain of Neuars and was good
french could not remedy the country / but in that he knew many of the
co^panyo^s and so by his desire sometime the less hurt was done / and the
archprest did the same time much good in Neuernoise / for he caused ye cite of
Neuers to be closed / else it had been ouerron and robbed diverse times / for we
had in those marches towns / and castelles / mo than.xxvi. There was neither
knight nor squire nor rich man / with out he were agreed with us / that durst
look out of his house. And this war we made in the tytell of the king of
Nauar.

How diverse capitayns englisshe and other were disco^fited before the town of
Sa^xere by the frenchmen.

IN the same season fell the battle of Cocherell / where the captall of Beufz
was captain: for the king of Nauar and diverse knights and squyers of our
company went to him. sir Jacques Planchyn and sir Johan Ioell went to serve him
with two hundred spears. The same season I kept a castle called the Beck
Dalyer nere to Charity / going toward Barbanoise / and I had under me a.xl.
spears / and I made in the country mylles greatly to my profit / about saint
Purcyn and saint Peter de moustier. and when I herd how the captall my
master was in Constantyne and assembled men of war. for the great desire
that I had to se him / I departed fro my garyson with a.xii. spears / and I
fell in company with sir Johan Ioell and sir Jacques Planchyn / And without any
business or reencounter we came to the captall. I think sir Johan ye have all
ready the knowledge what became of that business: That is true quod I / for
there was taken the captall of Beusz / and sir Johan Ioell slain and sir
Jacques Planchyn: That is true quod the B^tefoyle of Manlyon / there I was also
taken / how be it I fortuned metely well: there was a cosyn of mine who was
called Bernard of Terryde / he dyed after in Portyngale at the battle of
Iuberot. and this Bernarde who was as than under sir Aymenon of Pomyers / he
took me and rau^somed me in the field at a thousand frankes / and gave me a
good saueco^ducte to return to my garyson of Bec Dalyer. as soon as I came to
my castle I sent a servant of mine with a thousand frankes / to my cosyn to
Paris / and had my quytaunce for the same. The same season sir Johan Aymery an
English knight and the greattest captain that we had rode forth / costyng
the river of Loyre to come to Charity / and he was encou^tred by abusshment of
the lord Rugemo^t and the lord of Wodnay / and by some of the archprestes
men. They were far stronger than he and so there he was taken and overthrown
/ and raunsomed to a.xxx. thousand frankes / which he paid incontinent. Of
his taking and loss he was sore displeased and swear / that he would never
enter in to his own garyson / till he had won again as much as he had lost.
Than he assembled together a great nombre of companyons / and came to Charity on
Loyre / and desired the capitayns there / as Lamyt and Carsnell and the burge of
Piergourt and me / for I was there as than to sport me. There he desired us all
to ride forth with him: We demanded of him wheder he would ride? By my faith
quod he / we will pass ye river of Loyre at saint Thybalte: and let us scale
and assail the town and castle of Sa^xere. For quod he / I have sworn and
auowed / that I will not enter in to no fortress that I have / till I have
seen the children of Sanxere. And if we may get that garyson and the earls
children within / John^ / Loys / and Robert: Than we shall be well revenged /
and thereby we shall be lords of the country / and I think we shall lightly come
to our intent / for they take no head of us / and this lyeng still here does
us no manner of profit. That is true sir quod we / and so all we promised to
ride with him / and incontinent we made us ready. And so it fortuued / ye all
our purpose was known in the town of Sanxere. The same time there was* there
a capitayn a valyant squire of But goyne of the low marchesse called
Guyssharte Albygon / who took great head to keep well the town and castle of
Sanxer / and the children within. This sir Guysshart had a monk to his brother
/ of the abbey of saint Thybalt / which is nere to Sanxere. This monk was
sent to Charity on the river of Loyre for his brother / to bear a certain
rau^some thider yt the towns owed by couynant. so we took no head to him and
he knew all our ententes / how I can not tell / and all our names that were
capitaynes there / and what nombre we were of / and what hour we should
depart / and how we were determined to pass the river at the port of saint
Thybalte: And so he returned and went to Sanxere / and showed his brother all
our minds. Than therle there and his brethren provided for remedy / and they
sent for knights and squyers of Berry and Burbonoyse / and to the capitayns
and garysons therabout / so that they were a four hundred spears of good men
of war and made abusshment of two hundred spears without the town of
Sanxere in a wode. and we knew nothing of all this / and at the son going
down / we departed fro Charity and rode a good pase till we came to Penly /
and at the port there / we had ready boots and barges to pass us over and
our horses. And so we paste over the river of Loyre as we had ordained / and
we were over by mydnight / and because ye day came on / we ordained a hundred
spears to abide there to keep our horses and boots / and the remynaunt of us
passed forth / for^ by the french busshment. When we were paste a quarter of
a mile / than they brake out of their busshment / and rode to them that we had
left behind us at the river side. and anon they had disconfyted them and all
slain or taken / and our horses won / and the botes arested. and than they
mounted on our horses and came after us on the spurs / and were as soon in
the town as we. They cried our lady of Sa^xere for the earl was there him
self with his men / and his brethren / sir Loyes and sir Robert had made the
busshement. So thus we were enclosed on all parts / for they a horse back
as soon as they ca^e to us / they a lighted afote and assailed us fiersly. And
the thing that most grieved us / was we could not enlarge our self to fight /
we were in such a narowe way closed on both sides / with hay / hedges / and
vyngardes / and also some of our enemies such as knew the country were rydden
about and get in to the vyngardes / and did hurt us sore with castyng of
stones and we could not go back / and much pain to get to the town / it
stood so high on a mountain. So we were sore traueyled / and sir John^ Aymery
was hurt our sovereign capitayn / by the hands of sir Guysshart Albygon / who
took him prisoner and had much a do to save his life he put him in to a house
in ye town / and made him to be laid on a bed / and said to the owner of
the house. keep well this prisoner / and / se his wounds staunched / for if he
live / he shall pay me.xx. thousand frankes. and so sir Guysshart left his
priso^er and returned to the battle / and quytte himself like a good man of
arms. and there was with the children of Sa^xere / come thider to their aid and
to the countries / sir Guysshart dalphyn / the lord Marney / sir Gerarde and
sir Wylliam Burbone / the lord of Cousant / the lord de la Pier / the lord
de la Palys / the lord of Neutry / the lord de la coise and the lord of
Syette / and diverse other. I say sir to you / this was a battle right fell and
cruel. we defended our self as long as we might so that on both parts there
were slain diverse persons / and many hurt: for by that they showed they had
rather have taken us a live than to slay us / and finally we were all taken /
Carsayle launt / Nandon / le bourge de Pyergourt Espyot / the burge of Lespare
/ Angerot le mount gyse / Philyppe of Roe / Peter of Corthue / the Pesat of
Palyuiers / the bourge of Darusen / and all our capitayns^ and I my self and
we were brought to the castle of Sa^xere. Never before in the realm of
France / the companyons lost so much as they did at that journey / how be
it Guysshart Albygon lost his prisoner by negligence / he bledde so sore that
he dyed^ for defaute of lokyng unto. Thus ended Johan Aymery / by this journey
that was thus done beside Sanxere / Charity was delivered / and all the
garysons therabout by composycion / that we should be quyte out of prison / and
so we had save conducte to depart out of the country whider we list. And it
fortuned as than for us / that the same season sir Bertram of Clesquy / the
lord of Beayne / sir Arnolde Dandrehen / and the earl of March / they took
their voyage to go in to Spaygne to aid the king Dampeter / but first I was in
Bretayne at the bataile of Alroy under sir Hughe Caurell / and there I
recovered my loss / for the journey was ours. and I had to my perte good
prisoners / by whom I had two.M. frankes. Than I went with ten spears with sir
Hugh Caurell in to Spain / and there helped to put king Dampeter out of his
realm. And than when ye alyances were made between the king Dampeter and the
prince of Wales / and that he would abide in Castle / I was there in the
company of sir Hugh Caurell and I returned with him in to Acquitayne. Than the
war renewed between the french king and the prince: than we had much a do /
for we had sore war / and many capitayns english and Gascoyns were slain /
and yet I thank god I am a live. There dyed sir Robert Briquet between the
land of the duke of Orliance and the country of Bloyse / in a place called
Oliuet / and there he and all his company were overthrown by asquyer of
Heynalt a valyant man of arms and a good captain / called Alars Doustienes /
surnamed Barbason / for he was of that lynage. He was as than gouernoure of
Bloys / and kepar of all the country / set there by the lords thereof / as
Loys / John^ / and Guy. So it was his fortune to encou^tre with sir Robert
Briquet and sir Robert Cheney. and they and all their company were slain / for
there were non taken to ransom. and at the battle of Nyorthe in Xayntaine /
Carsnell was slain by sir Bertram of Clesquy / and a seuyn.C. englyssh men
were slain there / and at saint Severe were slain other english capitayns /
as Rychard Elys and Richard Helyn. I knew but few expert my self but yt
were slain. I have hold fronter and made war for the king of England for
mine heritage lies in Burdelois. Sometime I have been so overthrown and pulled
down / that I had not wherewith to lepe a horse back. And another time I have
been rich enough when good fortunes came / and in a season I and Raymonet de
la Pee were companions together: and we had in Tholousyn on the fro^ters of
Bygore. The castle of Maluoysin / the castle of Trygalet / and the castle of
Va^teulx / which as than did us great profit. Than^e the duke of Anion took
them fro us / byforce of puyssaunce. but than Raymonet de Pee turned French /
and I abide still good englisshe and shall do while I live. True it was / when
I had lost the castle of Trygalet / and was co^ducted to the castle Cuyllet
/ and that the duke was gone back again in to France / I determined to do
somewhat / outher to get some profit or else to lose all / or to dye in the
pain. I caused by spyall / the town and castle of Thury in Albygo is to be
well a viewed / which castle after aueyled to me / what by good fortunes and
^atesfyeng of the country a hundred thousand frankes. I shall show you how
I wanne it.

WIthout the town there is a fair fou^tayne / and of usage every morning /
the women of the town would come thither with pottes and other vessels on
their heedes / to fetch of the clear water there. Than I took fyftie co^panyons
of the garyson of Cuillet / and we rode all a day through wodes and busshes /
and the next night about mydnight / I set a busshment nere to Thury / and I
and a six other all only / did on us women's array and with pottes in our
hands. And so we ca^e to a medowe right nere to ye town / and hid ourselfe
behind great cocks of hay that were there standing / for it was about the
feast of saint Johan / when they make hay. and when the hour came that the gate
was opyned to let the women go out for water / we seuyn took our pottes and
filled them at the fountain and went toward the town / our faces wrapped
in kerchers / so that we could not be known: the women that we met going for
water said to us. Ah saint Mary gosseppes / ye were up be times: We answered
in their lauguage with a faint voice / that is true. And so paste by them and
came to the gate / and we found no body there but a souter dressynge forth of
his baggage. Than one of us blewe a horn to draw thither out company out of
the busshment. The souter took no head but when he hard ye horn blow he
demanded of the^. What is this? Who was that blewe the horn? One answered and
said. It was a priest went into the feldes. Ah that is true quod the souter /
it was sir Frau^ces our priest / gladly he gothe a mornings to seek for an
Hare. Than our company came and we entered in to the town / where we found no
man to draw his sword to make any defense. thus I took the town and castle
of Thury / whereby I have had great profit yearly / more than the castle of
Trygalet with the appurtenau^ce is worth. But as now I wot not what to do
for I am in a treaty with therle of Armynake and with the dolphyn of Auuergne
/ who has express authority by the French king / to bye all towns and
fortresses of the companyons / such as they hold in their hands whersoeuer
they be / outher in Auuergne / Rouerg^e / Lymosyn / Quercy / Pyergourt /
Albegois / Again and of all such as has or does make any war in the king of
Englandes tytell / and many are departed and have rendered their fortresses / I
can not tell if I will render mine or not: With that word said the Burge of
Compayne. Cosyn / it is true: For of Carlat which I hold in Auuergne / I am
come hyder to here some tidings / For sir Loys of Sanxere marshall of France
will be here shortly / he is as now at Tarbe / as I have herd of such as
come thens. with these words they called for wine and drank. Than the Bastot
said to me. sir Johan / are ye well informed of my life? yet I have had other
adue^tures which I have not showed / nor will not speak of all. sir quod I / I
have well herd you.

How a squire called Limosin turned french / and how he caused Loys Rambalt
his companyon in arms to be taken. Cap. xxx.
THan again I demanded of him / where Rambalt an expert squier and a great
captain of me^ of War was beco^e / because I saw him ones in Auignon in
great array. I shall show you quod the Bastot of Manlyon. In time past when sir
Seguyn of Batefoyle held Bride in Velay / a ten mile fro Puy in Auuergne / and
that he had made war in the country and conquered much / than he returned
in to Gascon and gave to Loyes Ra^balt and to another co^panyon of his called
Lymosin / Bride and Anse / on the water of So^me / the country as than was so
desolate and full of co^panyons in every corner / yt noue durst go out of their
houses / and bitwene Bride in Auuerne and Anse / is more than.xxvi. mile / a
country full of mou^tayns. and when Loyes Rambalt would ride for his pleasure
fro Bride to Anse / he rode without doubt or fear / for he held diverse
fortresses in the county of Forestes / and therabout / where he refresshed him:
For as tha^ the gentylmen of Auuergne / of Forestz / of Velaye / and the
fronters were sore traueyled / and over laid with the war. they were so
taken and raunsomed that they doughted the war / For there was none of the
great lords of France that sent any men of war in to the country / for the
french king was young / and had much a do in diverse pertes of the realm /
for in every part / the companyo^s and companyes rode and did much hurt / so
that the realm could not be quyte of the^ / And also diverse of the lords of
France were in England in hostage / and in the mean season their countries
and men were pylled and robbed / and had no remedy: for the men of the country
were without courage to defend themself. And so it was / that Rambalte and
Lymosin / who were companyons in arms fell out / I shall show you how.

LOyes Rambalte had at Bride a fair woman to his lover / whom he loved
parfitely: and when he rode fro bride to Anse / he commanded Lymosin to take
good head to her. And Lymosin who was his companyon in arms / and in whom he
most trusted / he took so good head to the damsel / that he had his pleasure
of her when he list / so that Loyes Rambalte was enfourmed thereof / and he
could suffer it no lengar: So that he took such a hate against his companyon /
that he caused him to be taken by his servants / and made him to be driven
all naked save a breche: about the town / and beaten with scourges / and
tru^pettes to be blown before him: And at certain places his deed to be
openly cried and than banisshed the town like a treatour / and in a simple
cote put out. This dispyte did Loyes Rambalte to Lymosin / which dispyte
Lymosin took grievously / and said: How he would be reue^ged if ever it lay in
his power / as he was anon after. And this Lymosin while he was in prosperity
/ in ridyng between Bride and Anse he ever forbear the lands of the lord of
Voult dwelling on the river of Rone / for he had served him in his youth. Than
he thought to go to him and to cry him mercy / and to desire him to make his
peace in France. and so in his cote a foot he went to Voulte / for he he knew
right well the way / and so went in to a house / and when he saw his time he
went to the castle / and the porter would not suffer him to enter / but at
last he spoke so fair / that the porter did let him in / and commanded him
to go no farther in without he were commanded / and he obeyed. When the lord
was up he went down in to the court to sport him / and so came to the gate:
Than Lymosin fell down on his knees / and said. sir / do ye not know me? by
my faith quod the lord no: He thought little it should have been Lymosin: and
when he had well aduysed him he said. Thou resemblest well Lymosin / who was
ones my servant. Sir quod he ^ Lymosyn I am and your servant. than he cried
him mercy for all things paste before / and showed him fro point to point all
his business / and how Loyes Rambalte had dalte with him at the end. Than
the lord said. Lymosyn / Is it as tho say / and that thou will beco^e good
french I shall make thy peace. By my faith sir quod he / I never did so much
hurt to the realm of France / but I shall do again more profit thereto /
that would I se gladly quod the lord of Voult. the lord kept him in his house
till he had made his peace in every place. and wha^ Lymosin might in surety
ride / than the lord of Voult armed him / and brought him to the seneshall of
Velay and acquaynted him there. and there he was examyned of the state of bride
and of Loyes Rambalte / and when he rydeth what way he takes: and than he
said. When Loyes rydeth he has not with him past a.xxx. or a.xl. spears: and
the ways that he keeps I know them by heart. For with him and without him /
I have rydden them often times. And sir / if ye will send forth a company of
men of arms / on ieopardy of my heed / ye shall have him within fyftene days.
The capitayns there took head to his saying and sent out spies / and Rambaulte
was spyed as he was rydinge fro Bride to Anse beside Lion / on the river of
Rone. When Lymosin knew it / he showed it to ye lord of Voult and said. Sir /
Loyes Ra^balte is now at Anse / and at his retournyng I shall bring you to a
straight / where as he must needs pass by. Than the lord of Voult made an
assemble and was captain himself / and sent for the bailey of Velay / the
lord of Mountelan sir Gerarde of Salyers and his son / sir Pla^seart of
Vernet / the lord of Newcastell / and for other men of arms therabout: so
that he was a three.C. spears / and they all assembled at Nonnay / and by the
counsel of Lymosin they made two busshmentes. the vicou^t of Polygnac and the
lord of Chalencon had the rule of the one / and the lord Voulte and the lord
of Mount Clan had the guydynge of the other busshment / and with them sir Loyes
of Tornon / and the lord of Salyers: and they had equally divided their
company. The first company kept the pase nere to saint Rambart in Forestes /
where as Loyes Rambalte should pass the river of Loyre / or else he must have
gone by Guide or Pynne. And when Loyes Rambalt had done that he came for to
Anse / he departed with a.xl. spears / and thought not to have any rencounter
/ and douted nothing of Lymosin / it was the leest thought he had. And
lightely ever the way that he rode outward he would not come homewarde. And as
he came outward he ca^e by saint Rambalte / and at his return he took
another way / and took the mountayns above Lion and above Vyenne / and under
the Burge Darlentall / And rode straight toward the Mounastier / a three little
mile fro Puye. And he had passed between the castle of Monestrole and
Mountfaucon / and so came about the country / toward a vyllage called Batery
/ between Nonnay and saint Iulyane. And in the wode there was a straight
passage / which he muste^ needs pass / or else to go by Nonnay. at which
straight lay the lord of Voult with two hundred spears / and Loyes Rambalt
took no head till he was among them. Than the lord of Voulte / who was ready to
do his enterprise / laid the spear in the rest and came cryinge la Voulte /
and dasshed in among the companyons / who rode abroad without good arraye. And
so at the first metyng / many of them were overthrown to the earth / and Loyes
Ra^baulte was stryken fro his horse / by a squire of Auuergne called Amblardon:
and so he took him prisoner / and all other taken or slain none escaped. And
there they found in boiettes a three.M. frankes / which Loyes Ra^balte had
received at Anse / for trybute of certain vyllages therabout / whereof they
were glad / for every man had his part. And when Lymosin saw Rambalt this
trapped he came before him / and said in reproach. Loyes Loyes: here fauteth
company. Remember ye of the blame and shame that ye did put me to at Bride for
your maystres? I would have thought little for a woman / ye would have put me
to that ye did. For if ye had done as much to me / I would not have been so
angry. for two such co^panyo^s in arms as we were / might have past our time
well enough with one woman. With those words the lords laughed / but Loyes
Ra^balt had no sport herat. By the taking thus of this Loyes Ra^balte Bride
was delivered to the seneshall of Auuergne / for after they had lost their
captain and the chief men they had / they would keep it no le^gar: And in
likewise so did they of Anse / and other fortresses in Velay and Forestes /
that was on their part. for they within any of these for / tresses were right
ioyouse to yield up their holds to save their lives. Than Loyes Ra^balte was
brought to Nonnay and there set in prisone / and the french king had great
joy of his taking. and as I herd reported / he was beheeded at Newcastell
beside Auygnon. Thus Loys Rambalt dyed / god have mercy on him. Thus sir quod
the Bastot of Manlyon / I have hold you with talkyng / to pass away the
night / how be it sir / all that I have said is true Sir quod I / with all my
heart I thank you. Sir / I trust your sayenges shall not be lost. For sir /
and god suffer me to return in to mine own country / all that I have herd
you say / and all that I have seen and found in my voyage / I shall put it in
remembrance / in the noble cronycle that the earl of Bloys has set me a warke
on: For I shall write it and cronycle it by the grace of god / to the intent it
shall be in parpetuall remembrance. Than the Bourge of Compayne / called
Erualton began to speak / and would gladly that I should parceyue by him / that
he would I should record his life / and of the Bourge English his brother /
and how they had done in Auuergne / and in other places. But as than he had no
leysar / for the watch of the castle sowned to assemble all me^ that were in
the town to come up to the Castle / to suppe with the earl of Foiz. Thanne
these two squyers made them ready and lyghted up torches / and so we went up to
the Castle / and so did all other knights and squyers that were lodged in
the town.

Of the state or ordinance of the earl of Foyz: and how the town of yran
rebelled / for the great traueyle / damage / and outrage that was don there to.
Cap. xxxi.
OF the astate and order of the earl of Foiz can not be to much spoken nor
praised: For the season yt I was at Ortaise / I found him such / and much
more than I can speak of: But while I was there / I saw and herd many things
that turned me to great pleasure. I saw on a Christe^mas day sytting at his
board / four bysshoppes of his country / two Clementynes and two Vrbanystes:
the bishop of Pauyers and the bishop of Lescalle Clementynes / they satte
highest. Than the bishop of Dayre and the bishop of Rone on the fronters of
Burdeloys and Bayon / Vrbanestes: Than satte therle of Foiz / and than the
vycount of Roquebertyn of Gascone / and the vycount of Brunyquell / the vycount
of Iosserau^t / and a knight of England of the duke of Lancasters / who as than
lay at Narbone / the duke had sent him thither: The knight was called sir
Wyllyam Wylloughby. And at another table satte five abbottes and two knights
of Arragon / called sir Raymonde de Mount florentyne and sir Marten de Ruane:
And at another table satte knights and squyers of Gascone and of Bigore. First
the lord of Daychin / than sir Gaylari de la Mote / sir Raymo^de of Newcastell
/ the lord of Chamo^t / Gascone / the lord of Compane / the lord de la Layne
/ the lord of Mountferant / sir Wylliam Bernarde / sir Peter of Corton / the
lord of Valenchyn / and sir Aungalle named the Basell. and at other tables
knights of Bierne a great no^bre / and the chief stewardes of the halle were
sir Espaygne of Leon sir Siquart de Boys Verdune / sir Nonnans of Nonnallys /
and sir Peter of Vaulx of Bierne / and the two Earls bastard brethren served
at ye table / sir Erualton Guyllame and sir Peter of Byerne: And the earls two
sons. sir yuan of Leschell was shewer and sir Gracyen bare his cup. And
there were many Mynsttelles / as well of his own as of strangers / and each
of them did their deuoyre in their faculties. The same day therle of Foiz gave
to harauldes and minstrelles / the so^me of five hundred fra^kes: and gave to
the duke of Tourayns mynstrelles gowns of clothe of gold furred with Ermyns /
valued at two hundred frankes. This dinner endured four hours. Thus I am
glad to speak of the earl of Foyz / for I was there in his house a xii. wekes
/ and well entreated in all things / and while I was there / I might learn and
here tidings of all countries. And also the gentle knight sir Espaygne of
Leon / in whose company I entered in to the country: He caused me to be
acquaynted with knights and squyers / such as could declare to me any thing
that I roude demand: For I was informed of the business of Portingale and of
Castle / and what manner of war they had made / and of the batayls and
rencounters between those two kings and their assysters / of which busynesses
I shall make just report.

yE have herd here before: How king don Johan of Castle had besieged the
castle of Luxbone / and the king Johan of Portyngale therein / whom the good
towns had crowned to their king for his valyantnesse / how be it in deed he
was a bastard. And also ye have herd how the same king send in to England
to the duke of Lancastre and to the earl of Cambridge / who had in marriage his
cosyns / to have socour of the^. These messangers were two knights and a
clerk / sir Johan Radyngos and sir John^ Door / and with them a clerk
lycensiate in the law / arche deaken of Lysbone. These messangers did so much
by the sea / that they came to Hampton and there tarried a day / and there gate
horses for they had none of their own / and so rode to London. This was in the
month of August. And the king was in the marches of Wales a huntyng at his
pleasure / and his uncles / the duke of Lancaster / therle of Ca^bridge / sir
Edmonde and sir Thomas earl of Buckyngham / were also in their own countries a
sporting / wherefore the king of Portyngales messangers had more to do: so
first they spoke with the duke of Lancastre / who was at Hertforde / a twenty
mile fro London. The duke received them ioyously / and opyned ye letters that
they brought him / and the duke reed them three times / the better to
understand the^ / and than he said. Sirs / ye be right welcome in to this
country / but ye be come in the worst time of the year / to have spedy
delyuerau^ce of your ambassade / for the king and my brethren are sparcled
abroad here and the^ / and ye can have no full answer till the counsel come
toguyder at London at the feast of saint Mighaell: But sithe the great part of
your message touches me and my brother / therefore I will write to him / that
he and I shall be shortly at London / or therabout: and than we shall take
counsel / toguyder. Wherefore as now ye shall return to London / and when
my brother is come nere ye shall have tidings fro us. The ambassadors of
Portyngale were content / and so returned to London and were well lodged and
took their ease. The duke of Lancastre forgate not that they had said to him /
and so incontinent wrote to his brother therle of Cambridge of that business.
and when therle had reed his brothers letters / he prepared him self and rode
to Hertforde beside Ware when the duke was / and there they were three days
together in counsel. and so ordained to go to London as the duke had promised
to the ambassadors / and so they came to London. Than these two lords and
they of Portyngale had great cou^sayls between them / For the earl of Ca^bridge
who had been before in Portyngale / was nothing content with king Ferant of
Portyngale last deed / for he said he made his war but slackely. and also
against t^^wyll of him and all the Englyssh men / he took peace with the
spanyerdes / wherefore the earl said / he had doubt that at the counsel at
Myghelmas / the co^montie would not agree lightly to make another vyage in to
Portyngale / for the journey thither before had cost greatly the realm of
England / and no profit thereby. The ambassadors co^ceyned well the earls
words / and said. Sir / than was than and now is now. The king whom god
pardon / redouted greatly ye fortunes of the world but the king our master
that now is / has another mind and ymaginacion / For if he find in the
field his enemies / though he be less of power / yet he will give the setting
on / whatso ever fall thereby. And this sir / we dare faithfully assure you. and
my lords beside / that your quarrel is clear to ouerron and to conquer the
realm of Castle / for the enherytaunce parteyneth to you and to your wives /
and to your children. and to conquer it / ye can not have so good an enter in
to Castle / as by Portyngale / sithe ye have all that realm according thereto.
Therefore sir / and one of you will come thither with such a suffycient nombre /
and by the aid ye shall have there / ye shall be able to keep the field The duke
of Lancastre answered. Sirs / this lies not in us / but in the king and in the
realm / but we shall do our good wylles / ye may be sure thereof. Thus they
ended their counsel / and the portyngalo is lay still at London abydyng
Mighelmas / and the duke of Lancastre and the earl of Cambridge returned in to
their own countries on the marches of the North. Than came Myghelmas and the
parlyament at Westmynster / and the king approached and came to Wyndesore and
so to Chertsey / and the queen with him / and than to Stanes / and also his
chief of counsel the earl of Oxenforde / for by him every thing was done /
and without him nothing. The same season there was in Flanders between the
duke of Burgoyne and the gau^toise great war. And the^ were newly returned
out of Flaunders in to England the bishop of Norwiche / sir Hugh Caurell /
sir Wylliam Helman / sir Thomas Tryuet / and other / who had in the same somer
ben at the siege with the gauntoise before Ipre / Than came the french king
and closed them in / in Burbonoise (as is rehearsed here before i^ this
history) but as than there was truse between France / England / and
Flaunders / to endure till mydsomer after / but the scotts had much to do.
also there was at London the counsel of Gau^t / and they desired to have a
governor to help to sustain the keeping of their town: They desired one of
the kings uncles / or else the earl of Salisbury. So at this counsel at
London there were many counsayls / as well for the fle^mynges as for Portyngale
and Scotland / who made the^ war. The duke of Lancastre drew to that part
that he might have a no^bre of men of war and archers / to go in to
Portyngale. And he showed the lords / prelates / and commons / how they were
all bound by faith and oath / to aid him and his brother to win the
heritage in Castle: and that he said / they promised when the king his nephue
was crowned. and it apered by their letters sealed. and moreover / the duke
complained him how they of the realm did him and his brother wrong / in that
when his brother therle of Cambridge was in Portyngale / that they kept but
smally the couynaunt that they had promised: For he said / it was promised to
send to him thider two thousand spears and as many archers / and nothing was
done / Whereby their quarrel of the right of their enherytaunce was greatly
hyndred. The dukes words were well hard / as it was reason / And the most
notablest persons of yt counsel said / how he had right to speak as he did
how be it they said / that the busynesses of the realm that touched them nere
/ must first be proferred. Some would that his will should have been
accomplysshed / and some other said / that it should be a great outrage to
send out of the realm two thousand men of war and four thousand archers /
to so long a journey as i^ to Portugale / for the fortunes of the sea be
dangerous and the air of Portyngale marvelous hot / saying / that if the
realm of England should lose such a company / it should be a damage
irrecuparable: How be it all things alleged / finally it was ordained / that
the duke of Lancastre should pass the Sea with seuyn hundred spears and four
thousand archers / and every man paid for a quarter of a year. How be it they
reserved / that if any accydent touching the realm of England by the means
of France or Scotland / should happen to fall before their departure in to
Portingale / than to tarry. The duke agreed thereto sithe he saw it would be
none otherwise: And than as ye have herd before / whan^e the duke of Lancastre
was ready with all his men at Hampton / to take his voyage in to Portyngale /
and that the ambassadurs were returned and had brought word in to Portyngale
/ how the duke of Lancastre was coming with such a nombre of men of war /
Than the portyngalois had great joy. So it fortuned than that a let fell in
England / which tarried the duke of Lancastre for a season / for the admyrall
of France sir Johan of Vien with a thousand spears of good men of arms /
took shippyng at Scluse and sailed in to Scotland and made war in to
England / so that all the realm came to resyst the^. All this is showed here
before in this history / wherefore I need not to speak thereof again / but I
will speak of the siege of Lixbone and of the king of Spain / of whom I
shall make true relacyon / according as I was informed.

King don Johan of Castle being at siege before Lixbone / tidings came in to
his host by merchants of his country that came fro Flaunders / how the
duke of Lancastre with a great nombre of men of war were coming thyderwarde
/ to reyse the siege the^. These tidings were well believed / for the
spanyardes knew well / how the duke of Lancastre would do his pain and
dilygence to make war on the realm of Castle / because he claymed part
thereof by the right of his wife / how be it the king held still his siege /
and he had sent messangers and letters to have aid out of France and
specially he sent in to the country of Bierne / and in to the land of the earl
of Foiz. And out of Byerne there issued in a four days respyte / a three
hundred spears of chosen men of arms and there was come to Ortaise out of the
realm of France to go into Castle to serve ye king there / Sir Johan of Rue
burgonyon / and sir Geffray Richon breton / and sir Geffray de Partenay / and
each of the^ had a company by them self. Than they of Bierne made the^ ready /
as the lord of Lynguasshe a great barone / and companyon to the earl of Foiz /
and sir Peter Liar / sir Johan de Lespres / the lord of Bordes / sir Bertrande
of Baruge / the lord of Moriage / sir Raymonde Dansac / sir John^ of Salagre /
sir Monan of Saruen / sir Pyer of Robier / sir Stephyn of Valentyne / and sir
Raymonde of Rarasse / sir Peter of Hanefan / sir Ogert of domesson / and diverse
other. And sir Espayngnolet of Spaygne eldest son to sir Roger of Spaygne /
cosyn of lygnage and arms to the earl of Foiz / he went in the company of them
of Bierne. These lords and knights of Bierne made their assemble at Ortaise
and therabout / and it was showed me by them that saw them deperte fro
Ortaise. how that they were the best armed and appointed company / that went
out of Byerne many a day before. And when the earl of Foiz saw surely how
they would deperte to go in to Spaygne (though at the beginning he somewhat
consented thereto / and that they should receive the king of Castelles wages)
yet he was angry and soroufull of their departing / for he saw well that his
country was sore febled thereby. Than he sent sir Espaygne de Leon and sir
Cabestan to these said lords knights and squyers / desyringe them to come
toguyder to his castle of Ortaise / to the intent to give them a dyuer to
their farewell. The knights obeyed as it was reason / and came to Ortaise to
se the earl / who received them with glad chere / and after mass caused the^
all to come to him in to his secret chamber / and than in manner of counsel
he said to them. sirs / it is than your ententes to deperte out of my country /
and to leave in my hands the war with the earl of Armynake / and ye to go
and make war for the king of Spain. This departure touches me right nere.
Sir quod they / we must needs go / for to that intent we have received ye king
of Castles wages. And sir / the war between Spain and Portyngale ones
atchyued / than we shall return again in sauegarde. atchyued quod therle /
nay not so soon: for as now it does but begin / for there is a new king in
Portyngale / and he has sent for aid in to England: therefore this war is
likely to endure a long season / and ye to keep the field / for ye shall not be
fought with / till the duke of Lancastre and his company be come thither: and so
ye shall derely bye the wages ye have received. Sir quod they / sithe we have
done so much we must needs parforme our voyage. Well god speed you quod the
earl / let us go to dinner it is time. and than therle with these lords and
knights went in to his hall / and there the tables were. There they had a
great dinner at great leaser / and was served with every thing that to that day
perteyned. And after dinner therle led with him all this company in to the
galarye / than he entered in to comunyng with them and said. Fair lords and
friends / it shall grieve me to se your departing out of my country / not for
that I am dyspleased with your auauncementes and honors / for in all cases I
would gladly augment and exalte your honors and profit: But I have great
pytie of you / for ye are the chief flour of chiualry of my country of Bierne.
and ye thus to go in to a strange country / I would counsel you yet again
to leave this voyage / and to let the king of Castle and the king of
Portyngale make their war between them self / for ye are not bound none
otherwise. Sir quod they / saving your displeasure / we can not do thus. And
sir / ye know more than ye speak of. We have taken wages and gifts of the
king of Castle / wherefore we must needs deserve it. Well quod therle yespeke
well / but I shall show you what shall come of this vyage: Outher ye shall
return so poor and so naked that life shall stra^gle you / or else ye shall be
all slain or taken. The knights began to laughe and said. Sir we must abide
the adventure. Than therle fell in other talkyng and left that in rest / and
that than he showed them in manner of communycasion / all the nature of the
Spanyardes / how they be sluttysshe and lousy / and enuyous of other men's
welthe. Wherefore quod he / I reed you take good counsel / and than he
demanded for wine and spyce / and he made every man drink: and than took
every man by the hand and badde them farewell / and departed fro the^ and went
in to his chamber. And at the foot of the castle the knights mounted on their
horses and so rode to Sanetere / and the^ lodged that night. And the next day
they departed and entered in to the land of Baseles and took the way to
Panpylone / and they passed surely / for they paid truly for all that they
took. And in the same season while the king lay in Lixbone / and had layen
there the space of a year: Than they of the town of saint yrayne rebelled
against ye king of Castle / and closed their gates and said. that another
French nor spaynisshe should enter in to their town / because of the damage
that they had done to them / and oppressyons. And some said / it was in the
fault of Geffray Rycous company and sir Parteney / who had a company of bretons
/ who took ever that they might get / for they set nothing by peace. Than the
cytezins took the two castelles and said / how they would keep them and their
town against all persons that would do the^ any hurt. and the same day that
they rebelled / they slew mo than threscore bretons / and had nere slain sir
Geffray Partenay / but that he saved him self under ye walls of the town yt
were nere his lodging. Than the frenchmen and bretons that were there fiersly
assauted them of saint yrayne / but they lost more than they won / and so did
nothing. These tidings came in to the host to the king of Castle / how
that they of saint yrayn were tourued portyngalois / and how they were in
mind to deliver the town and castelles to the king of Portyngale. Of which
news the king was not content / and called to him his marshall sir Raynolde
Lymosin and said. take a hundred or two hundred spears and go to saint yrayne
/ and know why the men of the town do rebel / and what occasion they have to
do as they have done. So the marshall rode forth and with him a two hundred
spears and came to saint yrayne: and he sent before him an haraulde to show
them of his coming / and how he would speak with them at the barryers / and so
he did his message: and it was answered him by the^ of the town / saying. Sir
haralde / we know right well / Sir Raynolde Lymosin is a gentylman and a
valyant knight / and is marshall with the king / he may rightwell come hyder if
it please him unarmed in to the town / or else not. This was all the message
that the haralde brought to his master. Than^e sir Raynolde said / I am not
come hyder to do the^ any damage / but to know their ententes. It is all one
to me to enter armed or unarmed / to know their wylles. And so he and six
with him rode thither unarmed / and left all his company behind him: and so he
a lyghted before the barryers / and when they within saw him in that estate /
they opyned the gate and received him in to the town and made him good chere /
and than he assembled the people in the market place and said. Sirs / all ye
that dwell in this town take heed what I say. I am sent hyder by the king
of Castle to demand of you / for what ente^cion ye do rebel and close your
gates / and have slain of them that be come hyder to serve the king. Know
for truth / the king is sore displeased with you / and also he is enfourmed /
how that ye have taken in possessyon the two castelles of this town / which
parteyneth to his enherytaunce / and how that ye will deliver them to his
adversary the king of Portyngale. Than they answered and said. Sir Raynolde /
saving the kings grace we are not so disposed nor to render them to any
man's hands / but to our king. The king of Castle of whom we hold them /
so that he govern us in peace and justice and yt we do or have done / was in
ye faut of these robbers and pyllers the bretons / who were lodged in this
town / for if we had been sarazyns or worse people / we could not have been
worse dalte withal than we were. as in rauysshinge of our wives and daughters
breaking up our coffers / and breaking out of the heedes of our vessels of
wine / beatynge and meamynge of us / when we speak any word to them. Therefore
it can not be marueyled (when we saw these outrages done to us and to ours by
the^ that should defend us) though we were displeased. Men will be displeased
for less cause. Sir / ye may show all this if it please you / for we be of
one accord: that whosoever come / we will receive in to our town another
french nor breton / nor none but the kings own person / with such as shall
please him / so that we be not traueyled nor put to vyolence. Whan^e sir
Raynolde herd them say so / he was a peased: for it seemed to him / that they
did no wrong to put out of their town their enemies / and than he said. O
ye good people / I have well herd you and well understand you. ye shall abide
in peace / and I will return to the king / and show him all that ye have
said / and in good faith I shall do for you as much as in me is possible to
do. Sir we thank you quod they / and we trust in you that if the king have any
yuell informacyon of us / yt ye will be our good mean. And than sir Raynolde
took his leave and departed and returned to his company / who abode for him
in the feldes. And so he rode till he came to the host before Lixbone and
lyghted at his lodging / and went to the king and showed him all that he
had hard and found with the^ of yrayne. When the king knew the truth he
said: By my faith they have done wisely / for no man can be sure of these
robbets.

And when sir Geffray Richone and sir Geffray Partenay and their companyes /
saw how they could have none other remedy of them of saint yrayne / and that
the king of Castle dissymuled with them: They were sore displeased and said
among them self. We have well left the realm of France to come hyder / to
serve the king of spain / thus to be shamed and domaged by a sort of villayns
/ and we can have no right. We trust shortly hyder will come a sort of
knights of Gascone / we will suffer till they come / And than we will all
agree together / and reueng our companyons that they have slain and yuell
entreated. Tidings came in to the host to the king and to his counsel /
that the bretons sore manasshed them of saint yrayne / and makes their auaunte
/ that the Gascoyns ones come / how they should derely pay for that is done.
Wherefore the king was counsayled to depart fro the siege / and to go and
refresshe him a season at saint yrayns / and to set the matter in a good way
/ and so the^ to tarry the coming of the gascoyns / of whom there were a four
hundred spears of good men of war. Whereof they king was joyful / and would
not that they should find the country in trouble at their coming. And also
much of his people desired to refresshe them / for there they had layen long
/ and nothing done. Than it was commanded every man to dislodge / and to
draw toward saint yrayne. Than the spanyardes dyslodged and all other / and
so came in to the marchesse of saint yrayne. When they of saint yrayne knew
how the king of Castle was coming toward their town / They ordained twelfe
men / the most notablest persons of their town to mount on their horses / and
so they did / and rode till they came where the king was to know his
pleasure. And the king was a lighted under the shadow of Olyue trees / to
refresshe him / for the great heat that was than: And this was a two leages
fro saint yrayne. and there was sir Raynolde Lymosin marshall of the host /
who knew of their coming. and so he was present by the king when they came
and kneled down / and said as follows.

How the king of Castle left the siege of Lixbone: and how they of saint
yrayne excused them self. Cap. xxxii.
RIght redouted prince and noble king of Castle / we are come hyder to your
presens / send fro the poor co^mynaltie of your poor town and bayliwike of
saint yrayne. To the^ it is given to understand / how ye be greatly with them
displeased. And sir / wheder it be thus or shall be right redouted sir / the
fault came not by them / but by reason of the iniuryes and oppressyons that the
bretons has done to the^ / such as were in their town. Sir / all their yuell
deeds can not come to knowledge. sir / we blame not the masters / squiers /
nor knights / nor capitens / but all only them that dyded us hurt. For sir /
these pyllers and robbers bretons / have done with us such deeds / that it
were marueyle to think or to record it. Sir / they held a season in
subiectyon / the town and country about saint yrayne / so that we herd of
them many great complayntes. And sir / in the dispyte of us / they would
break up our cofers / and take all that we had: and vyolate our wives and our
daughters before our faces. And when we spoke any word / we were beten /
maimed / or slain: In this poverty we were a two months or more: wherefore
right redouted and noble king / we beseech your grace / if we have displeased
you for this cause or for any other / that it may please you / that we may
have true justice / and laufull informacyon / and to maynteygne us in our right
/ as ye promised and swear to us / to keep us in our lyberties / the first time
we swear you king / in the town of saint yrayne. sir / ye shall do great
alms on us. For sir / when ye be come thither / we trust in you and in your
counsel to be such nobleness / that the town of saint yrayne shall be opyned
against your coming. And that it may please yor grace / your poor people
there cryeng for mercy / and complaining of their iniuryes and oppressyons
done to them. That your royal majesty and your noble counsel / will grant
them grace and remyssyon of that is paste / and to remedy their wrongs. The
king stood still a little: and sir Raynolde Lymosin kneled down and said. Dear
sir / ye have herd your people of saint yrayns complaynt / showing what has been don to them: Wherefore may it plase you to answer them. Raynold quod the
king / we know well they had a just cause to do as they did. Go to them and
bydde them rise and go their ways to saint yrayne / and make ready for my
coming for the^ we will lie this night: And also show the^ / how they shall be
well maynteyned in their right. Than sir Raynolde rose and went to the^ and
said. Sirs a rise / the king has well conceived your saying / ye desire but
right and justice / and that ye shall have. Go your ways and apparel as ye
ought to do the town of saint yrayns against the kings coming / and do so
that he may give you thank: your matters shall come well to pass / by such
means as ye shall have in your aid. Sir quod they we thank you: Than they
took their leave of the king and returned to their town / and showed all that
they had herd of the king / and the answer that sir Raynolde Lymosin made
them / on the kings behalf / whereof all they of the town were glad. Than
they apparelled their town richely against the kings coming / and strawed the
streets with fresshe grene herbs. So the king entered in the euenyng / and
lodged at the castle called the Lion / and his men in the town as many as
might / and the most perte in the feldes and in the villages therabout. The^
the king was well a month / and so ye matter stood / for if they had done more
/ more had they lost.

Of the marvelous battle that was at Iuberoth / between the king of Castle
and king John^ of Portyngale Cap. xxxiii.
While the king of Castle was at saint yrayns / the^ come to him the gascons
of Bierne with a fair company sir Raynolde Lymosin rode to receive them and
welcomed them right swetely / as he that could right well do it / and brought
the^ to the king / who had great joy of their coming / and commanded sir
Raynolde Lymosin to se them well lodged at their ease / and he did so that
they were contented. Thus these busynesses rested / and the king lay still at
saint yrayns and his people there about. The king of Castle had as than
abroad lodged in the feldes and therabout / a four thousand men of arms
and.xxx. thousand of other. And on a day he called the barons of France to
counsel to know their minds / how he should me^tayne forth his war /
for he had layen at great cost before Li^bone and had done nothing. And surely
if the gascoins had not come and encoraged the king / he had deperted fro
saint yrayns and gone outher to Bergus or into Galice / for his people were
sore anoyed to lie so long in ye feldes. When the knights of France and of
Bierne were come before the king / he said. Fair sirs / ye be all good men
of war / wherefore I would have your counsel / how I may maynteyne my war
against the lyxbonoyes and portyngaloyes / that have kept me here in the field
a year / and yet I have done nothing to them. I had thought to have got them
out of Lixbone to have fought with them / but they would in no wise issue out /
wherefore my people give me counsel / to give every man leave to depart to
their own houses / wherefore I pray you give me your advise. The knights of
France and of Byerne who were but newely come / and desired arms / and as
than had nothing done / thynking to deserve their wages that they had received
/ answered and said. Sir / ye be a puyssant man of lands / and little
costeth you the pain and traueyle of your people / and specially sith they be
in their own country. We would not say so much if they were in a strange
country clean without prouysion / but as now we say / they ought not to give
you any such counsel / for they be here in as great ease / as we se / as
though they were at home. Sir / we say to you not in manner of a determynate
counsel / for ye are wise enough but we think by your high prudence / the
best were to choose / as yet to keep the field. ye may well keep it till the
feast of saint Michaell / and paradue^ture by that time your enemies will
assemble together and draw out in to the field when ye take leest head thereto /
and so tha^ without fail they shall be fought withal. Sir / we have great
desire to win so^what / for this journey has cost us much / and great pain
and traueyle / both to our self and to our horses / or we came in to this
country. Therefore sir / it shall not be the opinyon of our company thus to
depart again. By my faith quod the king / ye speak well and truly. In this
war and other / I shall use fro hens forth after your counsel: for the
king my father and I also / have found always in your countries great
truth and faythfulnesse. And god have mercy of sir Bertram of Clesquyes soul
/ for he was a true knight / by whom in his time we had many recoueraunses /
and good iourneys.

THe words and counsails that the king had of them of France and of Bierne /
were anon known among the lords and knights of Spaygne / wherewith they were
sore displeased / for two causes. One / because it seemed to them / that their
king had more trust and co^fydence in strangers / than in them who were his
liege men / and had crowned him king. the second was / in that they of France
counsayled the king to keep still his war / and they felyng them self so
weary of the war: and so spoke among them self in diverse manners / not openly
but privily. They would say the king could make no war but by the frenchmen
/ and in likewise no more could his father. so they had great envy at the
french men / which well appeared: For when the french varlettes went out a
forragyng / if the spaynisshe forrengers were stronger / than they would take
their forage fro them and beat them and mayme them / so that complayntes came
thereof to the king / and he blamed therefore his marshall sir Raynolde Lymosyn
/ and said. Why have ye not provided for this matter? The marshall excused him
and said: As god might help him / he knew nothing thereof / and that he
would provide a remedy fro thens forth. Incontinent he stablysshed men of
arms to keep the feldes / that the french forre^gers rode at their surety /
and also he made a cry and a commandment / that every man that had any
vitayle or provision to sell that they should bring it to the field before
saint yrayns / and they should have a prise reasonable for every thing. So than
the strangers had largely their part / for the king ordained that they should
be served before all other / whereof the spanyardes had great dispyte.

So it was the same weke / that the king of Castle departed fro the siege of
Lixbone: three great ships of men of war and English archers aryued at
Lixbone / they were to the no^bre of five hundred one and other: And the third
part of them were of the co^panyons adventurers / having no wages of no man.
some were of Calys / of Chierburge / of Breast in Bretayne of Mortaygne in
Poytou: They had herd of the war between Castle and Portyngale / and they
came to Burdeux and there assembled and said. Let us go at adventure in to
Portyngale we shall find them there that will receive us and set us awarke.
Sir Johan Harpedan / who as than was marshall of Burdeux / counsayled the^
greatly thereto / for he would not they should abide in burdeloys / for they
might there have done more hurt than good / because they were companyons
adventurers / and had nothing to lose. Of them that arrived at Lixbon I can not
name all. There were three squyers english that were their capitayns: One was
called Northbery / and another Morbery / and the third Huguelyn of Harcerell.
And there were none of them paste the age of fyftie year / and good men of
arms / and well used in the feats of war^. Of the coming of these English
men they of Lixbone were right glad / and so was the king of Portyngale who
would se the^ and so they went to the palace where the king was / who made them
great chere: And demanded of them / if the duke of Lancastre had sent them
thither. Sir quod Northbery / it is a long season sithe he had any knowledge of
us or we of him. Sir / we be men of diverse sorts / seeking for adventures /
here be some are come to serve you fro the town of Calays. By my faith quod
the king / you and they both are right heartily welcome / your coming does me
great good and joy / and shortly I shall set you a warke. We have been here
enclosed a great season / so that we be weary thereof / but now we will be at
large in the field / as well as our enemies has been. Sir quod they / we
desire nothing else: and sir / we desire you that shortly we may se your
enemies. The king made them a dinner in his palace at Lixbone / and commanded
that they should all be lodged in the city at their ease / and to be paid for
their wages for three months. Than the king set his clerks awarke and made
letters / and sent the^ over all his realm / co^maundynge every man able to
bear harness to draw to Lixbone.

ALl such as these letters came unto obeyed not / for many abode still i^
their houses / for three parts of the Realm dissymuled with the king / and
with them of Lixbone / because they had crowned king / a bastard / and spoke
great words there against privily: And because of the great trouble and
dyffere^ce that the king of Castle and his counsel saw in the realm of
Portyngale / made him to auaunce him self / to the intent to have conquered
the country: Saying / how all should be won with one days journey of
battle / and that if they of Lixbone might be overthrown / the resydue of the
country would not be sorry of it / but put out of the realm that master
Denyce / or else slay him / and than it should be a land of conquest for him
/ for his wife was right enherytoure. yet with a good will king Johan of
Castle would have left the war / but his people would not suffer him for
they ever gave him courage: Saying / how his quarrel and cause was just. And
when the king of Portyngale saw that his commandment was not observed / and
that much of his people disobeyed to serve him / he was right pensive and
malencolyous: He called to him such as he trusted best of Lixbone / and of the
knights of his house / who did their pain to crown him / and also they had
served king Ferant: As sir Johan Radygos and sir John^ Teatedore: the lord of
Siegere / and sir Go^me of Tabeston / Ambrise Condricho and Peter his brother /
ser Ouges of Nauaret a knight of Castle / who was turned Portyngaloyes / for
king Johan had chased him out of his realm / and the king of Portyngale
had retained him and made him a chief captain. At this counsel the king
showed many things and said. Sirs / ye that be here I know well ye be my
fre^des / for ye have made me king. Behold now / how diverse folks of my
realm excuses them self / so that I can not get them to the field / for
if they had as good will to fight with our enemies / as I have / I would be
right glad thereof / but they be not so dysposed: I se how they refrain and
dyssymule the matter / wherefore I have need of counsel on this matter / how I
may order myself: and therefore I pray you let me have your advise. Than
sir Go^me of Tabeston a knight of Portyngale said. Sir / I counsel you for
your honor / that as soon as ye may / draw your self and all your
people in to the field / and adventure you and we also / and we shall aid you
to dye in the quarrel / for ye be our king / And if there be any in Portyngale
rebels and disdaynfull to serve you. I say and so says diverse of this
town / that it is because ye have not issued out to show your face against
your enemies. ye have the grace as yet to be reputed a valiant man in arms:
and they say / that now at need your valyantnesse fails you. This it is
that has set your enemies in pride / and has cooled your subjects / For if
they saw in you deeds of valor and of prowes / they would obey and dout you /
and so would do yo^ enemies. by my heed quod the king ye say well / and so it
is. wherefore sir I will incontinent / that every man make him redy^ for we will
ride out shortly and look on our enemies / outher we will win all at this time
or lose all. Sir quod the knight / it shall be done: for if the journey be yours
/ and god send you good fortune / ye shall be king of Portyngale for ever /
and ye shall be praised in all strange realms / where as the knowledge thereof
shall come. and to the parfyte heritage of Portyngale ye can not attain / but
by battle. ye may take ensample of king don Henry your cosyn / father to king
Johan that now is king of Castle / of Spaygne / of Tolle^ / of Galyce / of
Corduane / and of Sibyle. He came to all these herytages by battle / otherwise
he had never had them. For ye know how the puissaunce of the prince of Wales
and of Acquitayne put king don Peter yo^ cosyn in to possession o^ all these
herytages and lands closed within Spain / and afterward by a journey of
battle yt don Henry had at Nauntuell against don Peter / who there lost all
again / and don Henry put in possession as he was before / at which journey
he adventured himself and his / or else he had not ben king there. In likewise
sir ye must adventure if ye think to live with honor. sir quod the king ye
say true / I will have none other counsel but this / for this is profitable
for us.

THus departed that counsel / and than it was ordained yt within three days /
every man should draw in to the feldes and there to take some ground to abide
their enemies. Those three days they kept the gates so close of Lixbone / that
another man nor woman could issue out / for they would not yt their enemies
should be preuy of their entensyon. and when the Englysshmen that were there
understood that they should issue out and draw toward saint yrayns to look
on their enemies / they were joyful. Than every man made him ready / and the
archers dressed ready their bows and arowes and all other / in every thing
that they neded. And on a thursdaye they departed out of Lixbone / and that day
they lodged by a little river side a two leages fro Lixbone / with their faces
toward saint yrayns. And every man said with good heart and will / that they
would never return to Lixbone / till they had seen their enemies: Saye^g /
how it was better for them that they should go and require battle of their
enemies / rather than they should come on them. For they said / they had seen
and herd diverse ensamples of requyrers and not requyrers: and ever of five /
four has optayned / and in a manner all the vyctories that the englysshmen
have had in France / they were ever the requyrers. For naturally the secars
for battle are more strongar and couragyous in assaylinge / than the defendars
be. Of this opinion they were nere all and some of the burgesses of Lixbone
said. We were at Bruges in Flanders when the gauntoyse came before the town
/ and required battle against the Earl of Flaunders / and all his puissaunce.
And we know well that Philyppe Dartuell / Petre de Boyse / Johan Clyquetiell /
Frau^ces Atreman and Peter le Myttier / who as than were capitayns of the
gauntoyse. They brought out of Gaunte no mo but seuyn thousand men / and yet
they required battle of their enemies / and over came and disconfyted a.xi.
thousand. This is true / and this was without any treason / but by clean
fortune of battle. This was done on a saturdaye a leage fro Bruges / as we
herd reported the next day when they had won the town of Bruges. So thus
they did put in adventure / outher to win or to lose: and thus must we do
if we think to have any good speed. Thus these lixbonoyse that thursday spoke
one to another: and when the king was informed of their words and of their
great confort he had great joy.

ANd on the Friday in the morning / they sowned their trumpettes and made them
ready / and took the way on the right hand following the river and the plain
country / for their caryage that followed them / and so rode that day four
leages. That day tidings ca^e to the king of Castle where he lay at saint
yrayns / that the Portyngalois and the Lixbonoyes were coming toward him.
These tidings anon were spredde abroad in the host / whereof the Spaygniardes
/ French men / and gascoyns had great joy / and said: Behold yonder
Lixbonoyes be valyant men / sith they come to seek for battle. Shortly let
us go in to the feldes / and let us close them among us and we way / to the
intent that they return not again. Than^e it was ordained and publysshed in
the host / that every man the Saturdaye in the morning a foot and a
horseback / should issue out of saint yrayns / and draw toward their
enemies to fight with them / every man made him ready and were joyful of that
journey. And on the saturday in the morning they sowned their trumpettes: And
the king herd mass in the castle and dra^ke / and than lepte on his horse /
and every man with him / and so drew in to the field / in good array of
battle. Sir Raynolde Limosin marshall of the host formast / and he sent
forth scurrers to advise the dealing of their enemies / and to se where they
were / and what nombre they were of: and the frenchmen sent forth two squyers
one a Burgonion and the other a Gascone. the burgonyon was called Wylliam of
Mo^tigny / and he was there with sir Johan of Rey: and they of Gascoyne and
Bierne sent forth Bertrande of Barge / and they were both the same day made
knights. And with them rode forth a Chatellayne of Castle a good man of arms
called Peter Ferant of Medyne. He was on a marvelous light Genet. and while
these three rode forth to advise their enemies / ye resydue of the host rode a
soft pase / and they were in nombre two thousand spears knights and squiers
/ Gascoyns / Burgonyons / Frenchmen Picardes / and Bretons: as well appointed
and armed as any men might be / and a twenty thousand spanyardes all a
horsbacke / they had not rydden forth a vow shot but they stood still On
the other side the king of Portyngale in likewise had sent forth three
scurrers to a vieu justly the demeanyng of the spaniardes / whereof two of them
were English squyers / expert men of arms / one called Iaquyne Dartebery and
the other Philippe Barqueston / and with them Ferrant de la Gross of
Portingale. they were all well horsed and rode forth till they came to a
little hill / and there they might well se the behauynge of the spanyardes.
Than they returned to the king of Portyngale and to his counsel / and there
made relacyon of that they had done / and said. Sir / we have been so far
forward that we have seen your enemies. sir / surely they be a great nombre /
they are well a thyrtie thousa^de horse. Therefore sir / take your advise. than
the king demanded if they rode all in one battle or not. Sir quod they /
sutelye they be in two batayls. Than the king turned him toward his people /
and said a loud Sirs / now advise you well / for there needs now no
cowardnesse / for we shall fight shortelye / for our enemies be coming / and
has great desire to find us. and so they shall / for we can not fly nor
return: We are issued out of Lixbone a great nombre of people. Think sirs to
do well / and let us selle our lives dear. ye have made me king. This day
shall I se if the crown of Portyngale will abide with me peasably or not. And
sirs / of one thing be yesure / I shall not fly / but abide the adventure with
you: than they all answered / with a good will so be it / and we shall all
abide with you. Than the English capitayns were called forth / as Northbery
and Hartefell / and other of the^ that were most expert in arms. The king
demanded of them what counsel they would give him: how to abide the
adventure of the battle. for he said / he knew well they must needs fight /
for his enemies aproched fast / and they be in nombre four against one of us.
than the Englysshmen said. Sir / sith we shall have bataile / and that they be
greatter in nombre than we be / wherefore it is a hard pertie / we can not
co^quere / without we take some aduau^tage of some hedges or busshes. Let us
take such a ground as we may fortify / and that they shall not enter upon us
so lightely / as they should do on the plain field. Sirs quod the king / ye
speak wisely / and it shall be as ye have devised.

On this counsel of the Englysshmen / the king rested and there took advise
what ground they might take: and not far of fro them was the town of
Iuberothe a great vyllage. Thither the Lixbonoyes had sent all their provision
summers and caryages: For it was their entension that night to lodge there /
wheder they had battle or no / if they might escape with honor And without the
town a quarter of a leage or therabout / there was a great abbey of monks
whyder they of Iuberothe and of other vyllages were wont to come to here
mass. And the church stands a little out of the way in a moote /
enuyroned about with great trees / hedges / and busshes: it was a strong place
with a little help. Than the Englysshmen were called to counsel to the king
/ for though they were but few / yet the king would follow much their
advise: Than^e they said. Sir / we know hereby a place / the mynster without
Iuberoth among the trees / it stands in a strong place / with a little
amendment and help. and such as knew the country said. sir / it is true.
Than the king said / let us draw thither and let us order there our self / as
men of war ought to do / so that when our enemies come / let the^ not find
us un provided. inco^tyne^t it was done / and so they came where as the church
was. Than when the English men and sir Monges of Naueret / and diverse other
valya^t men of Portugale and of Lixbone / had well aduysed the place round
about: they said. This place is strong enough with a little help / so that we
may here abide the adventure. Than on the side next the feldes they cut
down the trees and laid them one over another / to thentente that horsemen
should not come with full course on them / They lafte one way open not very
large / and such archers and cross bows as they had / they set them on every
side of the way / and their men of arms all a foot in a plain within the way
/ and the church on their one side / and there was the kings baners pight up.
And when they had thus ordered every thing they were in great joy and said.
That if it pleased god they were well / and in such a place to keep long /
and to make a good journey. than the king said. Fair sirs / this day every
man do his part and think not to fly / for that can not aueyle us. We are
far of fro Lixbone / and also in the chase there is no recoueryng / for three
will slay and beat down.xii. that be flyenge. Therefore show this day that
ye be men of prowes / and selle derely your lives / and ymagyn in your self /
how the journey shall be ours / as it shall be if god be pleased / and than shall
we be much honored and spoken of in strange countries / where as the
tidings shall come / for always the victours be exalted / and they that be
disconfyted dispraysed. and sirs / think how ye have made me king / wherefore
ye ought to be the more hardy and coragyous. And of one thing be ye sure / that
as long as this axe endures in my hands I shall fight / and if it fail
orbreke I shall get another / and show my self / that I will mentayne and
defend the crown of Portyngale for my self / and for the right that I have
by succession of my brother / the which I take on my soul that mine enemies
traueyleth me wrong fully / and that the quarrel is mine.

Than all such as hard the king said / sir of your grace and mercy / ye
admonest us wyselye. And sir / we shall help to aid and maynteyne that we
have given you / which is your own. Sir / we shall all abide with you here in
this same place / and shall not depart / without god depart us. Sir / make a
cry to all your people / for every man has not herd you speak co^maundyng
on pain of death no man to fly And sir / if there be any that are faint
hearted to abide the battle / let them come forth / and give the^ leave to
depart fro the other / for one faint heart may dyscourage two dosyn of good
men or else stryke of their heedes in your presens / to give ensample to other.
The king answered / I will it be so. Than there were two knights ordained to
go and sertche every company / and to demand if any were abashed to abide
the battle. The messangers reported to the king when they returned / that
they could find no man but that was ready to abide the adventure of battle. It
is so much the better quod the king. Than the king caused all that would be
made knights to come before him / and he would give them the order of
knighthod / in the name of god and of saint George. and as I understand there
were made a threscore new knights / whereof the king had great joy / and did
set them in the front of the battle / and said to the^. sirs the order of
knighthode is as noble and high / as any heart can think. and there is no
knight that ought to be a cowarde nor shameful / but ought to be fierce and
hardy as a lion / wha^ his helm is on his heed and seyth his enemies. and
because I would ye should this day show prowes / where it ought to be showed:
therefore I ordain you in the first front of the bataile. and sirs do so that
we may have honor and you also / otherwise your spurs are but yuell set on.
and every knight answered as his turn fell / as he passed by the king. Sir /
with the pleasure of god we shall so do / to have your grace and love Thus the
portyng alois ordered them self / and fortifyed them beside the church of
Iuberoth in Portyngale. That day there was no Englisshman that would be made
knight / yet they were desired of the king and other / but they excused them
self for that day.

Of the spanyardes / how they ordered them self and their battle. Cap.
xxxiiii.
Now let us return to the king don Johan of Castle / and of the knights
and squyers of France and of Gascone / who were there with him: And such as
they had sent to advise their enemies / returned again and said. Sir king /
and ye lords and knights here present / we have rydded so forward / that we
have seen our enemies. And according as we can judge / they be not paste ten
thousand men in all / one and other / and they be about the mynster of
Iuberothe / and there they be rested and set in order of battle / and there
they shall be found / who soever will seek for them. Than the king called to
him his counsel / and specially the barons and knights of France / and
demanded of them what was best to do: They answered and said. Sir / we think
it were best let them be fought with all incontinent / we se nothing else. For
by that is reported / they be a frayed and in great doubt / because they be so
far of fro any fortress. Lixbone is far of a six leages / they can not
run thither with their ease / but they shall be overtaken by ye way / without
they take the aduau^tage of the night. Therefore sir / we counsel sith ye
know where they be / order your batayls and go and fight with them / while
your people be of good will to do well. Than the king demanded of the^ of his
own country their opinyons / as of sir Dangonyes Mendant / sir Dygo Parsement
/ Pier Goussart of Mou^tdasque / and Pier Ferrant of Valesque / and of the
great master of Caletrane: They answered the king and said. Sir / we have
well hard the knights of France / how they would have you hotely to set
on your enemies. Sir / we will that ye know and they also / that are we can
come to the^ it will be night / for ye se the son draws down ward / and
as yet ye have not ordered your batayls. Sir / therefore we think it were good
ye tarried till the morning / and let us draw so nere them and lay so good
spyall in diverse places / that if they would dislodge about mydnight and
depart / than let us also dyslodge / for they can not fly nor escape us /
the country is so plain. and there is no place to hyde them by Lixbone /
which we can not get with our ease. sir this counsel we gyne you. Than the
king stood still a little and cast down his look to the earth / and after he
turned his regard on the strangers. Tha^ the marshall sir Raynolde Lymosin
said to please the frenchmen / in the langage of Spaygne / to the intent he
might the better be understand of every man: and so turned him to the
spanyardes / such as had given the king that counsel / Saying and calling
every man by his name. sirs / how can ye be more sage in batayls or more used
in arms / than these valyant knights be that be here present? How can ye
deuyse any thing beyond them / that should be of any valor? for they have done
nothing else all their life days / but traueyll fro realm to realm to find
and to do deeds of arms. How can you or durst you devise any thing against
their words / which are so noble and so high for to keep the honor of the
king and of his realm / wherein ye have greatter part than they? For ye have
there your herytages and your bodies / and they have nothing there but now al
only their bodies / which they will first and formast put in adventure: and
so they have desired of the king to have the first battle / and the king has
granted them. Than regard their great and noble courage / when they will
first of all adventure the^ self for you. It should seem that ye have envy at
them / and that ye would that profit nor honor should come to them / which
ye ought not to do / but to be all of one accord and will. And also / by you
and by your counsel / the king has been here in the feldes long at great
cost and charge / for him and for all his / and layne at siege before Lixbone /
and could never have the adventure of battle till now with him that writes
him self king of Portyngale / wherein he has no right / for he is a bastard
and not dyspensed with all: and now he is in the field with such fre^des as he
has / which is no great nombre. And if now by craft he should again
withdraw him self and not fought with all / ye put your self than in
adventure / that all the hole host should rise on you and slay you / or else
that the king should repute you for traitors / and strike of your heedes and
co^fyske all your lands. Therefore I se no better way for you than to be still
/ and let them alone that has seen more than you in such busynesses / for ye
never saw that they have done nor never shall. And than ye king looked up and
by semynge was glad with those words / and the spanyardes were abashed /
and feared they had done gretter trespace than they did / for though the
marshall reproved them and spoke against them / yet they had well spoken and
truly cou^sayled the king / but what for valyantnesse and to please the
strangers / who desired battle / the marshall spoke as he did.

Than every man was still / and the king said. I will in the name of god and
saint James / that our enemies be fought with all: and all such as will be
made knights to come forth before me / for I will give the^ thordre of knight
hode / in the honor of god and saint George. Than there came forth many
squyers of France and of Byerne / and there they were made knights of the
kings hand: as sir Roger of spain / Edmo^de son to sir Roger of the cou^tie
of foiz / ser Bertrand of Barroge / sir Peter of Salebere / sir Peter of
Valentyne / sir Wylliam of Quere sir Angers of Sollenayre / sir Peter of Vande
sir Wyllyam of Montigny / and of one and other / to the no^bre of a hundred
and.xl. and there were certain barons of Bierne that raised up there first their
baners / and also diverse of Castle / and also sir Johan of Rey. There might
have been seen among these new knights great nobleness / and they maynteyned
them self so goodly / that it was pleasure to behold the^ / for they were a
fair battle. Than the lord of Loyngiache came before the king / and all
other that were strangers / what soever nacyon they were of / so they were no
spanyardes / they were all named in the name of strangers. Than they said to
the king. Sir / we become fro far parts to serve you. Sir / we require you
do us that grace / to let us have the first battle. I am content quod the king
/ in the name of god and saint James / and saint George be in your aid. than
the spanyardes said one to another softely / behold for goddessake behold /
how our king puts all his trust in these frenchmen. He has no parfyte
trust in none other: they shall have the first battle / they praise us not so
much yt they will take us with them / they will do their deed by them self /
and than let us do ours be our self / let us let them alone with their
enterprise: they have made their auaunt / how they be strong enough to
discomfyte the Portugaloys. Let it be so we are content / but it were good we
demanded of the king / wheder he will abide with us / or else go with the
frenchemen. So thereupon they were long in murmuryng / wheder they should
demand it or else be still / for they douted greatly the words of sir
Raynolde Lymosin / how be it all things consydred / they thought it none yuell
to demand him the questyon. Than six of the most notablest of them went to
the king / and enclyned them self and said.

RIght noble king / we se and understand well by aparent signs / that this day
ye shall have battle with your enemies / god send grace it be to your
honor and vyctorie / as we greatly desire. Sir / we would know wheder your
pleasure lies / to be among the fene^chmen or else with us. Fair sirs quod
the king / though I have granted the first battle to these knights and
squyers strangers / who are come far of to serve me / and are valyant and
expert men in wars / yet for all that I renounce you not / for I will be and
abide among you: therefore sirs / help to defend me. Of this answer the
spanyerdes had great joy and were well contented and said. sir / so shall we do
/ and not to fail to dye in the quarrel. for sir / we are sworn to you and so
have promised by the faith of our bodies when ye were crowned. For sir / we
loved so well the king your father / that we can not sail you in any wise.
that is our trust quod the king. So thus the king of Spain abode among his
own men / who were well a twenty thousand horsemen / all covered in steel.
Sir Raynolde Lymosin was in the first battle / for it was his right so to be /
by cause he was marshall.

The same saturday was a fair day / and the son was turned toward
euynsong. Than the first battle came before Iuberoth / where the king of
Portugale and his men were ready to receive the^. Of these french knights
there were a two thousa^de spears / as fresshe and as well ordered men as
could be devised. And as soon as they saw their enemies / they joined
toguyder like men of war / and aproched in good order till they came within a
bow shot And at their first coming there was a hard re^countre / for such
as desired to assail to win grace and praise / entered in to the strayte way /
where the Englysshmen by their policy had fortyfied the^. And because thentre
was so narowe there was great prease and great mischefe to ye assayla^tes / for
such english archers as were there shot so holly toguyder / that their
arowes pearsed men and horse / and when the horses were full of arowes they
fell one upon another. than the Englysshmen of arms / the portugaloys / and
Lyxbonoyes / came on them cryeng their cries our lady of Portugale / with good
spears and sharp heedes / wherewith they struck and hurt many knights and
squyers. There was the lord of Lanache of Bierne beaten down / and his baner
won and he taken prisoner / and many of his men taken and slain. also sir
Johan of Ree / sir Geffray Richon / sir Geffray of parteney / and all their
co^panyes that were entered within the strayte / There horses were so hurt with
tharchers / that they fell on their masters and one upon another. There these
frenchmen were in great danger / for they could not help one another / for
they had no room to enlarge them self / nor to fight at their will. And when
the portugaloys saw that myschefe fall on the first assaylers they were glad
/ and as fresshe and coragyous to fight as any men might be. There was the
king of Portugale with his baners before him / mounted on a good horse /
trapped with the arms of Portugale / and he had great joy to se yt myschefe
fall on his enemies: and to conforte his people he laughed and said a high. On
forth good men / defend you and fight with good will / for if there be no mo
but these we need not to fear / and if I knew ever any thing in battle /
all these be ours. Thus the king of Portugale reconforted his people who fought
valia^tly / and had enclosed in the straight all the first assaylers / of whom
there were many slain. True it was that this first battle which these
knights of France and of Bierne led / had thought to have been quickelyer
aided of the spaynerdes than they were / For if the king of Castyle and his
company / who were a twenty thousand men / had come by another part and
assailed the portugaloys / it had been lykely the journey to have been theirs /
but they did nothing / wherefore they were to blame and received damage. Also
in deed the frenchmen set on to soon / but they did it to thentent to have
won honor / and to maynteyne the words they had spoken before the king: and
also as I was informed / the spaynierdes would not set on so soon / for they
loved not the frenchmen / for they had said before: Let them alone / they
shall find right well to who^e to speak / these frenchmen ar great vantours
and high minded / and also our king has no perfect trust but in the^ / and
since the king would they should have the honor of the journey / let us suffer
them to take it / or else we shall have all at our ente^tes. Thus by thse means
the spanynierdes stood still in a great battle / and would not go forward /
which was right displesant to the king / but he could not amend it / but the
spaynierdes said / because there was none returned fro the battle. sir /
surely these knights of France have disconfyted your enemies / thonour of
this journey is theirs / God give grace quod the king that it be so / Let us
ride than somewhat forward / that they rode a crosbowe shot forward and than
again rested: It was a great beauty to se them / they were so well mounted
and armed / and in the mean season the frenchmen fought / and such as had
leysar to a light fought valia^tly. diverse knights and squyers of either
party did many feats of arms one upon another / and when their spears
failed / they took axes and gave many great strokes on the helmes / sleyng and
maymynge each other.

Who soever were in such case of arms as the frenchmen and portugaloys were
at Iuberoth / must abide the adventure as they did / without they would fly
away / and in flyeng there is more paryll than to abide the battle / for in
flyeng lightly are most slain / and in battle when one seith he is
ouermatched he yeldeth him self prisoner: It can not be said but that the
knights of France / of Bretayne / of Burgoyne / and of Byerne / but that
right valiantly fought / but at their first encountre they were hardely handled
/ and all that was by the counsel of the Englysshmen to fortyfie their place.
So at this first batyle the portugaloys were stronger than their enemies / so
they were all taken or slain / but few that were saved / so that there were
at that first brunt a thousand knights and squyers taken prisoners / whereof
the portugaloys were joyful / and thought as that day to have no more battle
/ and so made good chere to their prisoners / and every man said to their
prisoners. Sirs be not abashed for ye are won by clean feate of arms / we
shall keep you good company as we would ye should do / if ye had us in like
case / ye shall come to Lixbone and refresshe you there / and shall be at your
ease / and they thanked them when they saw none other bote. and so there some
were put to their fynaunce inco^tynent / and some would abide their adventure /
for they ymagined that the king of Spaygne with his great army would shortly
come and deliver them.

How the french knights and gascoyns such as were taken prisoners at
Iuberoth by the portugaloys were slain of their masters and none escaped.
Cap. xxxv.
Tidings came in to the field to the king of Castyle and to his company / who
were aprochynge to Iuberoth by the^ that fled / who ca^e cryeng with great
fear and said. sir king auaunce your self / for all they of ye vowarde are
outher taken or slain / there is no remedy of their delyueraunce / without it
be by your puyssaunce / And when the king of Castyle herd those tidings he
was sore displeased / for he had good cause / for it touched him nere. Than he
commanded to ride on and said auau^ce for the baners / in the name of god and
saint George / let us ride to the rescue / sith our men have need thereof.
Than the spaynierdes began to ride a better pase cloose toguyder in good order
/ and by that time the son was nere down / tha^ some said it were best to
abide till the morning / because it was so nere night / they said they could
make but an easy journey. The king would they should set on incontinent /
and laid his reasons and said. What / shall we leave our enemies in rest now
they be weary / to give them leysar te refresshe them self / whosoever do give
that counsel loves not mine honor. Than they rode forth making great
noise and brunt / with so wnyng of trumpettes and tabours to abasshe therewith
their enemies. now shall I show you what the king of Portugale did and his
company.

AS soon as they had disco^fited the vowarde and taken their prisoners / and
that they saw none other battle coming wtin their sight yet for all that they
would put no trust in their first vyctorie. Therefore they sent six notable
persons to go and aui^we the country / to se if they should have any more to
do: They that rode forth came and saw the king of Castelles great battle
coming to them ward / fast approchynge to Iuberothe / more than twenty
thousand horsemen. Than they returned as fast as they might / and said all an
high to the people. Sirs advise you well for as yet we have done nothing.
behold yonder comes the king of Castyle with his great battle / with mo than
twenty thousand men there is none tarried behind. Wha^ they herd those
tidings they took short counsel which was of necessyte. Than incontinent
they ordained a pyteous deed. for every man was commanded on pain of death to
slay their prisoners without mercy / noble / gentle / rich / nor other / none
except. Than the lords / knights / and squyers that were prisoners were in a
hard case / for there was no prayer that auayled them fro the death / and so
they were slain some in one place and some in another as they were spredde
abroad unarmed / wenyng to have been saved but they were not. To say troth it
was great pytie for every man slew his prisoner / and he that did not / other
men slew the in their hands: And the portugaloys and the Englysshmen who had
given that counsel / said it was better to slay than to be slain / For if we
kylle them not / while we be a fighting they will escape and slay us / for
the^ is no trust in a man's enemy. thus was slain by great mischief the
lord of Longnache / sir Peter of Byerne / the lord of Lespres / the lord of
By^rne / the lord of Boordes / sir Bertrande of Bergues / the lord of Morayne
/ sir Raymo^de of Douzanche / sir Johan of Fologe / sir Manant of Sarenen / sir
Peter of Salybers / sir Stephyn Valentyne / sir Raymon Courase / sir Peter
Hansame / and to the nombre of three hundred squyers of Byerne and of France /
sir Johan of Rue / sir Geffray Richon / sir Geffray Partenay / and diverse
other. Lo / behold the great yuell adventure that fell that saturday / for
they slew as many good prisoners as would well have been worth one with
another / four hundred thousand frankes.

How the king of Castle and all his great battle were disco^fyted by the
king of Portugale / before a vyllage called Iuberoth. Cap. xxxvi.
When the lixbonoise / english / and Portugaloyse / had delivered the place
and slain all their prisoners / never a one escaped without he were before
conveyed to the vyllage of Iuberoth / where as all their caryages were. Than
they drew all together with a feirse will / on the same place where as they
were first assailed / and as than the son was going down. Than the king of
Castle in a puyssant array with his baners and penons dysplayed and mounted on
their horses well covered / came on cryeng Castle / and began to enter in to
ye place that was fortified / and there they were received with speres and axes
/ and at the first coming the shot of arowes grieved sore their horses / so
that many thereby were slain and overthrown. And all that season the king of
Castle nor his men. knew not of the myschiefe that was fallen to the vowarde
/ not how they were all slain / but he believed they had been still prisoners /
thinking to recover them again / as ye have herd.

There was a hard battle and a fyerse / and many a man cast to the earth /
the portugalois had no such aduau^tage / but and they had not fought valiantly
they had been lost and disco^fyted: that saved the^ / was their enemies could
not come on them but by one narowe way. There the king of Portyngale lyghted
a foot and took an axe in his hand and did marvelous in arms / and beat
down a three or four with his own hands / so that he was feared / that none
durst aproche nere him. I shall show some part of the co^dycions of the
spaniardes.

True it is / at their first setting on they are fierce and coragyous / and of
great advantage / and high minded if they have advantage: They fight well a
horse back / but as soon as they have cast two or three darts / and given a
stroke with their sword / and se that their enemies be not disco^fyted
therewith / than they fear and turn their horses and fly away to save them
self that best may. And at this bataile of Iuberoth they used the same play
/ for they found their enemies hard and strong / and as fresshe in the
battle as though they had done nothing of all the day before / whereof they
had marueyle / and also that they hard no tidings of the vowarde / nor where
they were become. There the spayniardes that euenyng were in the hard fortune
of battle and perylous for them / for as many as entered into their strength /
were by valyantnesse and feats of arms all slain. They took no man to
rau^som whatsoever he were noble or other. so the Lixbonoys had ordained / for
they would not be charged with prisoners: The^ were slain of them of Castle
such as follows. Sir Dangonnes Nendreche / sir Digo Persement / sir don Peter
of Rosermont / sir Mare of Versaux / the great master of Calestrane and his
brother / who was that day made knight / called sir Dygomor / sir Peter
Goussart of mo^desque / don Peter Goussart of Sonuyll / don Johan Radigo of
Rousell / and a threscore baronnes and knights of Spaygne. At the battle of
Naders / where the prince of Wales disconfyted king don Henry of Castle /
there were not slain so many noble men of Castle / as there was at this
battle of Iuberoth which was the year of grace / a thousand three hundred
fourscore and five / on a saturday on our lady day in August.

When the king of Castle understood and saw how his men were thus
disconfyted / and how that his vowarde was clean disconfyted without recovery
/ and that sir Raynalt Lymosin was deed / who was his marshall / and saw how
all his noble chiualty were lost / as well of his own realm as of France /
and else where / such as were come thider to serve him with their good
wylles: He was than sore displeased and wyste not what counsel to take / for
he saw his me^ began to fly on every side / and he herd how some said to
him / sir deperte hens it is time / the matter is in a herd case. ye can not
alone disconfyte your enemies / nor recover your domages: your people flies
all about / every man intends to save him self. Sir / save your self and
ye do wisely / if fortune be this day against you / another time it shall be
better. The king of Castyle believed counsel and than changed his horse and
mounted on a fresshe courser / strong and light / whereon no man had rydden
before of all day. Than the king struck the horse with his spurs / and
turned his back toward his enemies / and took the way toward saint yrayne
/ whyder all such as would save themself fled. The same time the king of
Castle had a knight of his house who bare his bassenet / whereupon there was
a sercle of gold and stones / valued to twenty thousand frankes. It was
ordained or they went out of saint yrayne / that this knight should bear it
till they came to the business / and than to deliver it to the king to wear
on his heed / but this knight did not so / For when they came to the ioyninge
of the battle the prease was so great / that this knight could not come to the
king / nor also he was not called for / wherefore he aproched not to ye king.
And when he saw how his company were discomfyted / and that the portugaloys
optayned the vyctorie / and saw how every man fled on every side / he
feared than the lesyng of such a rich iowell / and set than the bassenet on
his own heed and so fled / but he took not ye way to saint yrayne / but took
another way to the town of Arpent. Thus some fled this way and some that
way / like people sore disconfyted and abashed / but the most part fled
to saint yrayne: and that evening thither came the king sore abashed.

AT this disconfyture of the spaynierdes at Iuberothe / where the Portugaloys
and lixbonoys optayned the place / the^ was a great slaughter of men / and it
had been gretter if they had followed in the chase / but thenglissh men when they
saw the spaygniardes turn their backs / they said to the king of Portugale
and to his men. Sirs / demand for yo^ horses and follow the chase / and all
they that be fled shall be outher taken or slain. Nay not so quod the king /
it suffyceth that we have done / our men be weary and sore traueyled and it is
nere hand night / we shall not know whyder to go. And though they fly yet
they be a great nombre / and paraduenture they do it to draw us out of our
strength / and so to have us at their ease: Let us this day keep them that be
deed / and to morrow take other counsel. By my faith sir quod Hartesell an
Englysshman / the deed bodies are easy to be kept they shall never do us any
hurt / nor we shall have of them no profit. We have slain many good
prisoners / and we be strangers and are come far of to serve you / therefore
we would feign win somewhat of these calves that fly without wings / with
their banners wauyng with the wind. Fair brother quod the king / they that
all coueteth all leseth: It is better we be sure / sithe the honor of the
vyctorie is ours / and that god has send it us rather than to put our self
in paryll / when it needs not: We thank god we have ynowe to make you all
rich. Thus in this case the business rested.

THus as I have showed you / fell of the business at Iuberothe / where as the
king of Portugale optayned the vyctorie: and the^ were slain a five hundred
knights and as many squyers / which was great pytie and damage / and about a
six or seuyn thousand of other men / god have mercy on their souls. And all
that night till on the so^day to the hour of prime / the king of Portugale and
his men removed not fro the place that they were in nor never unarmed the^ /
but eat a little and dra^ke every man as they stood / which was brought them
fro the vyllage of Iuberothe. And on the sunday in the morning after the son
rysinge the king caused twelfe knights to mount on their horses / and to ride
forth to sertche the felde^ to se if there were any new assemble and when
they had ^ydden here and there / they returned and showed how they found no
body but deed men. Well quod the king of them we need not to doubt. Than it was
publysshed to depart thens and to go to the vyllage of Iube rothe thereto
abide all that day and night till monday in the morning. So thus they departed
and left the church of Iuberothe / and went to the vyllage and there lodged /
and tarried out all that sunday and the next night: And on the monday in the
morning they cou^sayled to draw toward Lixbone / Than they sowned trumpettes
to dislodge / and so in good order they deperted and rode toward Lixbone / and
the tuesday the king entered into ye town with much people / glory / and
tryumphe / and was received with processyon and so brought to his palace: And
in ryding through the streets the people and children made feast and reverence
/ and cried with high voice. Live the noble king of Portugale / to whom god
has given that grace to have vyctorie of the puyssaunt king of Castyle / and
has disconfyted his enemies.

By this journey that the king of Portugale had of the king of Castyle / he
fell in to such grace and love of his country and realm of Portugale / so
that all such as before the battle did dissimule with him / than came all to
him to Lixbone to do to him their homage: saying / how he was well worthy to
live / and how that god loved him / in that he had disconfyted a more
puissau^t king than he was himself / wherefore he was worthy to bear a
crown. Thus the king gatte the grace of his people / and specially of all the
commons of the realm. Now let us a little speak of the king of Castyle / who
after he was thus disconfyted / went to saint yrayn we pynge and lamentyng for
his people / and cursyng his hard fortune / that so many noble me^ of his own
country and of France were slain in the field.

THe same time that he entered in to saint yrayne / yet he knew not the damage
that he had / but on the so^daye he knew it / for he had send his haraldes to
sertche out the deed bodies. And he thought before / that the most part of
all such as the harauldes found deed / had been but prisoners and saved a
live / but they were not as it appeared. than he was so sore displeased and
sorry / that no man could comfort him. When he herd the report of the
harauldes / and knew the certentie of them that were deed / Than he said and
swear / that he should never have joy sithe so many noble men were deed in his
quarrel. And after the third day that the king had tarried at saint yrayne /
there came to him his knight with his bassenet / who was called sir Martyn
Haren / and delivered the bassenet to the king / which was valued as ye have
herd before: And before there had been herd words spoken of him. Some said
that falsely he was run away fro the king and would never return again.
Than the knight kneled down before the king and excused him self so largely /
that the king and his counsel were well content with him. Than a fyftene
days after the king of Castyle returned to Bergus in Spain / and gave
every man leave to deperte. Than after the^ was means and treaties made
between the king of Castyle and the king of Portugale: Than a truce was taken
fro the feast of saint Mychaell to the first day of May / both by land and by
See. And the deed bodies slain at Iuberothe / were buried in the church of
Iuberoth and in mother churches there about: and the bones of diverse carried by
their servants in to their own countries.

How a spyrite called Orthone served the lord of Corasse a long time and
brought him ever tidings from all parts of the world. Cap. xxxvii.
IT is great marueyle to consider one thing / the which was showed me in
therle of Foiz house at Ortayse / of him that enfourmed me of the business at
Iuberothe / He showed me one thing that I have oftentimes thought on sith /
and shall do as long as I live. As this squire told me / that of truth the
next day after the bataile was thus fought at Iuberoth the earl of Foiz knew
it / whereof I had great marueyle: For the said sunday / monday / and tuesday /
therle was very pensyfe / and so sad of chere / that no man could here a
word of him. And all the same three days he would not issue out of his chamber
/ nor speak to any man though they were never so nere about him. And on the
Tuesday at night he called to him his brother Arnault Guyllyam / and said to
him with a soft voice. Our men has had to do whereof I am sorry / for it is
come of them by their voyage / as I said or they departed. Arnault Guyllyam who
was a sage knight / and knew right well his brothers co^dicions / stood still
and gave none answer. And than therle who thought to declare his mind more
plainlye (for long he had borne the trouble thereof in his heart) spoke again
more higher than^e he did before / and said. By god sir Arnault it is as I say
/ and shortly ye shall here tidings thereof / but the country of Bierne this
hundred year / never lost such a loss at no journey / as they have done now
in Portugale. Diverse knights and squyers that were there present and herd him
say so / stood still and durst not speak but remembered his words. And within a
ten days after they knew the truth thereof by such as had been at the
business / and there they showed every thing as it was fortuned at Iuberothe.
Than therle renewed again his dolor and all the country were in sorrow / for
they had lost their parents / brethren / children / and friends. Saint Mary
quod I to the squire that showed me this tale. How is it that therle of Foiz
could know on one day / what was done within a day or two before / being so
far of? By my faith sir quod he as it appeared well / he knew it. Than he is
a deuyner quod I / or else he has messangers that flies with the wind / or
he must needs have some craft: The squire began to laughe and said. Surely he
must know it by some art of Nigromansye / or otherwise. To say the truth
we can not tell how it is / but by our ymaginacions. Sir quod I / such
ymaginacion as ye have therein / if it please you to show me I would be glad
thereof: and if it be such a thing as ought to be secret / I shall not
publysshe it / nor as long as I am in this country I shall never speak word
thereof. I pray you thereof quod the squire / for I would not it should be
known that I should speak thereof / But I shall show you as diverse men speaks
secretelye / when they be together as friends. Than he drew me a part into a
corner of the chapel at Ortayse / and than began his tale and said.

IT is well a twenty years paste / that there was in this country a barone /
called Raymon lord of Corasse / which is a seuyn leages fro this town of
Ortaise This lord of Corasse had yt same time a plee at Auygnon before the
pope / for the dysmes of his church / against a clerk curate there: the
which priest was of Cateloygne. He was a great cleke / and claymed to have
right of the dysmes in the town of Corasse / which was valued to a hundred
florens by the year / and the right that he had he showed and proved it. And by
sentence diffynityue / pope Vrbane the fyfte in consistory general /
condemned the knight and gave judgment with the priest. and of this last
judgment he had letters of the pope for his possession / and so rode till he
came in to Bierne / and there showed his letters and bulls of the popes for
his possession of his dismes. The lord of Corase had great indignacion at this
priest and ca^e to him and said. master Pe^ or master Marten / as his name
was: Thynkest you that by reason of thy letters / that I will lose mine
heritage? Not so hardy yt thou take any thing that is mine / if thou do it
shall cost the thy life / Go thy way in to some other place to get the a
benefyce / for of mine heritage thou gettest no part / and ones for always I
defend the. The clerk douted the knight for he was a cruel man / therefore he
durst not parceyuer. Than he thought to return to Auygnon as he did / but
when he departed he came to the knight the lord of Corasse and said. Sir / by
force and not by right / ye take away fro me the right of my church / wherein
ye greatly hurt your conscience. I am not so strong in this country as ye be.
But sir / know for truth / that as soon as I may / I shall send to you
such a champyon / whom ye shall doubt more than me. the knight who douted
nothing his thretnynges said: God be with the / do what thou may / I doubt no
more death than life / for all thy words / I will not lose mine heritage. Thus
the clerk departed fro the lord of Corasse / and went I can not tell wheder /
to Auygnon or into Cateloygne / and forgate not the promise that he had made to
the lord of Corasse or he departed. For afterward when the knight thought
leest on him / about a three months after / as the knight lay on a night a
bed in his castle of Corasse with the lady his wife / there came to him
messangers in visyble / and made a marvelous tempest and noise in the castle
/ that it seemed / as though the castle should have fallen down / and struck
great strokes at his chamber door / that the good lady his wife was soore
afraid. The knight herd all but he spoke no word thereof / because he would
show no abashed courage / for he was hardy to abide all adventures. This noise
and tempest was in sondrie places of ^ castle / and dured a long space / and
at last cessed for that night. Than the next morning / all the seryau^tes of
the house came to the lord when he was risen and said. Sir / have you not
herd this night that we have done? The lord dyssymuled and said no / I herd
nothing. What have you herd. Than they showed him what noise they hadd herd /
and how all the vessel in the kechyn was ouertourned. Than the lord began to
laughe and said. yea sirs / ye dremed / it was nothing but the wind. In the
name of god quod the lady / I herd it well. The next night there was as
great noise and greatter / and such strokes given at his chamber door and
wyndowes / as all should have broken in pieces. The knight starte up out of his
bed / and would not let to demand who was at his chamber door that time
of ye night: and anon he was answered by a voice that said / I am here. Quod
the knight / who sent the hyder? The clerk of Catelloygne sent me hyder quod
the voice / to whom thou do great wrong / for thou have taken fro him the
ryghtes of his benefyce / I will not leave the in rest till thou haste made him
a good account / so that he be pleased. Quod the knight / what is thy name /
that art so good a messangere? quod be I am called Orthone. Orthone quod the
knight / the service of a clerk is little profit for the / He will put the
to / to much pain if thou believe him. I pray the leave him and come and serve
me / and I shall give the good thank. Orthone was ready to answer / for he
was in amouts with the knight and said. Would thou feign have my service?
yea truly quod the knight / so thou do not hurt to any person in this house.
No more I will do quod Orthon for I have no power to do any other yuel but to
awake the out of thy sleep or some other Well quod the knight do as I tell the
/ and we shall soon agree / and leave the yuell clerk for there is no good
thing in him / but to put the to pain / therefore come and serve me. well quod
orthon and sithe thou will have me we are agreed.

SO this spyrite Orthone loved so the knight / that often times he would come
and vysite him / while he lay in his bed a sleep / and outher pull him by
the care or else stryke at his chamber door or wyndowe / to awake him. And when
the knight awoke than he would say. Orthon let me sleep. Nay quod Orthone that
will I not do / till I have showed the such tidings as are fallen a late. The
lady the knights wife would be sore afraid that her here would stand up /
and hyde her self under the clothes. Than^e the knight would say. Why / what
tidings haste thou brought me? Quod Orthone / I am come out of England or out
of Hungry / or some other place / and yesterdaye I came thens / and such
things are fallen or such other. So thus the lord of Corasse knew by Orthon
every thing that was done in any part of the world. And in this case he
continued a five year and could not keep his own counsel / but at last
discovered it to the earl of Foiz / I shall show you how.

THe first year the lord of Corasse came on a day to Orthayse to the earl of
Foiz / and said to him. sir such things are done in England / or in
Scotland / or in Almaygne / or in any other country. and ever the earl of
Foiz found his saying true / and had great marueyle how he should know such
things so shortly. And on a time therle of Foiz examyned him so straightly /
that the lord of Corase showed him all toguyder how he knew it / and how he
came to him first. When the Earl of Foiz herd that he was joyful and said.
Sir / of Corasse / keep him well in your love / I would I hadd such a
messangere: He costeth you nothing / and ye know by him every thing that is
done in the world: The knight answered and said. sir / that is true. Thus the
lord of Corasse was served with Orthon a long season / I can not say if this
Orthone had any mo masters or not. But every weke twyse or thrice he would
come and vysite the lord of Corasse / and would show him such tidings of
any thing that was fallen fro whens he came. And ever the lord of Corasse when
he knew any thing / he wrote thereof ever to the Earl of Foiz / who had great
joy thereof / for he was the lord of the world that most desired to here
news out of strange places. And on a time the lord of Corasse was with the
earl of Foiz / and the earl demanded of him and said. Sir of Corasse / did ye
ever as yet se your messangere? Nay surely sir quod the knight / nor I never
desired it. That is marueyle quod the Earl / if I were as well acquaynted with
him as ye be / I would have desired to have seen hi / wherefore I pray you
desire it of him / and than to tell me whet form and facyon he is of: I have
herd you say how he speaks as good gascone as outher you or I. Truly sir
quod the knight so it is / he speaks as well and as fair as any of us both
do. And surely sir / sith ye counsel me I shall do my pain to se him and I
can. And so on a night as he lay in his bed with the lady his wife / who was
so enured to here Orthon / that she was no more afraid of him. Than came
Orthon and pulled the lord by the ear / who was fast a sleep / and therewith he
awoke and asked who was the^. I am here quod Orthon. Than he demanded / fro
whens come you now? I come quod Orthon fro Prage in Boesme. How far is
that hens quod the knight? A threscore days journey quod Orthone. and art
thou come thens so soon quod the knight? ye truly quod Orthon / I came as
fast as the wind or faster. have thou than wings quod the knight? Nay truly
quod he. How canste thou than fly so fast quod the knight? ye have nothing
to do to know that quod Orthone. No quod the knight / I would gladly se the /
to know what form thou art of. Well quod Orthon / ye have nothing to do to
know / it suffices you to here me / and I to show you tidings In faith
quod the knight / I would love the much better and I might se the ones. Well
quod Orthone. sir sith ye have so great desire to seem / the first thing
that ye se to morrow when yt rise out of your bed / the same shall be I. that
is sufficient quod the lord. Go thy way I give the leave to depart for this
night. And the next morning the lord rose / and the lady his wife was so
afraid that she durst not rise / but feigned her self sick / and said she
would not rise Her husband would have had her to have risen. sir quod she than
I shall se Orthone / and I would not se him by my good will. Well quod the
knight I would gladly se him. and so he arose fair and easily out of his bed
/ and sat down on his bed side / wenyng to have seen orthon in his own
properforme / but he saw nothing whereby he might say / Loyonder is Orthon /
So that day passed and the next night came and when the knight was in his
bed orthon came and began to speak / as he was accustomed. Go thy way quod
the knight / thou art but alyer: Thou promysest that I should have seen the /
and it was not so. No quod he / and I showed my self to the. that is not so
quod the lord. why quod Orthon / wha^ ye rose out of your bed saw you
nothing? Than the lord studied a little and aduysed himself well. yes truly
quod the knight now I remember me / as I satte on my beds side / thinking
on the / I saw two strawes on the pauement tumblyng one upon another. That
same was I quod Orthone / in to that form I did put my self as than / That
is not enough to me quod the lord. I pray the put thy self in to some
other form / that I may better se and know the. Well quod Orthon / ye will
do so much yt ye will lose me and I go fro you / for ye desire to much of me.
Nay quod the knight thou shalt not go fro me / let me se the ones and I will
desire no more. Well quod Orthone ye shall se me to morrow / take heed / the
first thing that ye se after ye be out of your chamber it shall be I. Well quod
the knight I am than content / go thy way let me sleep. And so Orthone
departed / and the next morning the lord a rose and issued out of his
chamber and went to a wyndowe / and looked down in to the court of the castle
/ and cast about his eyes. And the first thing he saw was a Sow / the
greattest that ever he saw / and she seemed to be so lean and yuell favored /
that there was nothing on her but the skin and the bones / with long ears
and a long lean snout. The lord of Corasse had marueyle of that lean Sow /
and was weary of ye sight of her / and commanded his men to fetch his hounds
/ and said. Let the dogs hunt her to death / and devour her. His
servants opyned the kenelles and let out his hounds / and did set them
on this sow. And at the last the sow made a great cry / and looked up to the
lord of Corasse as he looked out at a wyndowe / and so sodaynely vanysshed
away no man wyste how. Than the lord of Corasse entered in to his chamber
right pensive: and than he remembered him of Orthon his messangere and said. I
repent me that I set my hou^des on him: It is an adventure and ever I here
any more of him / for he said to me often times that if I displeased him I
should lose him. the lord said truth / for never after he came in to the
castle of Corasse / and also the knight dyed the same year next following. Lo
sir quod the squire / thus I have showed you the life of Orthone / and how a
season he served the lord of Corasse with new tidings. It is true sir quod I
/ but now as to your first purpose / Is the earl of Foiz served with such a
messangere? Surely quod the squier it is the ymaginacion of many that he has
such messa^gers / for the^ is nothing done in any place / but and he set
his mind thereto he will know it / and when men think leest thereof. And so
did he when the good knights and squyers of this country were slain in
Portugale at Iuberothe. Some says the knowledge of such things has done
him much profit / for and there be but the value of a Spone lost in his
house / a none he will know when it is. So thus than I took leave of the
squire and went to other company / but I bare well away his tale.

Now I will leave to speak of the busynes of Portugale and of Spaygne / and
speak of the business in Languedocke and in France.

How a siege was laid to Breast in Bretaygne / and how diverse english
fortresses about the country of Tholous were recovered and turned french. Cap.
xxxviii.
IN the season while these adventures thus fell in Castyle and in far^
marchesse / it was ordained by sir Olyuer of Clysson constable of France / to
make a bastyde before the strong castle of Breast in Bretaygne / which the
Englysshmen held and had done long / and would not depart / another for the
french king nor for the duke of Bretayne / to whom the castle should
partayne. The duke of Berrey and the duke of Burgoyne / and the french kings
counsel / had oftentimes written to the duke of Bretayne / desyring him to
put to his pain and dilygence to get again his enheritau^ce the castle
of Breast / for it was greatly to his preiudyce to suffer the Englysshmen to
enjoy it. And the duke / what for the prayer of the said lords / and also
because he would gladly have had the possession of Breast in his own hands. On
a time he laid siege thereto but nothing he wan there / and so departed thens
and said / how he could do nothing the^ / whereat some knights and squyers
murmured and said / how the duke did but dissimule / for such as were the^
he took them not for his friends / nor would not / for all the Peace that was
made / that the castle of Breast should be in the french kings hands / for
if the frenchmen held it / he should not be lord thereof / yet he had rather
it were in the English men's hands / for the English men durst not
displease him. wherefore all things co^sydred / the constable of France
thought that the castle of Breest and the town / were not mete to be enemy to
the realm of France / And thought it not honorable for the duke nor for the
knights of Bretaygne / to suffer it as they did. Therefore he ordained to lay
siege thereto / with a great nombre of knights and squyers of Bretaygne: and he
made chief capitaynes of them / the lord of Molestroyt / the vycount of
Barleere / Morfane / and the lord of Roche Duraunt: These four valyant men
went and laid siege as nere to Breast as they might / and made a bastyde and
closed it about with pales and stones / and took fro Breast all their issues /
except the Sea / which was not in their power to close fro them. And often
times there were scrimysshes and feats of arms done before ye barryers / for
such as were without / desyringe deeds of arms / would come valyantly to the
barryers / and they within received them as valyantly / so that often there
were diverse hurt on both perties. There were but few days but that some
deeds of arms were done.

THe same season there was in the marchesse of Tholousyn a valyant knight of
France / called sir Galtier Paschac / a good captain of men of war / he
was of the nacyon of Berrey / on the fronters of Lymosyn / and or his coming /
the seneschall of Tholous sir Roger of Spaygne / and sir Hugh of Frodeuyll /
and the seneschall of Carcassone / had written in to France to the Constable
there / of the state of the country of Tholous and Robestan / and how that
diverse of the companyons adventurers / such as were issued out of Lourde and
of castle Cuyllet / and had made war for the Englysshmen / held in their
hands the fortresses following. As saint Forget / the Bassere / the Mesuylle
Purpuron / Co^uall Roch^fort / Th^dos Iulyen / Naueret / and diverse other /
whereby they had so enuyroned the city of Tholous / that the people could not
issue out to labor their vynes and lands / nor go on marchandyse / but in
great paryll / without they had truce / or patesed with them. And of all these
castles / the chief captain was an expert man of war of Basque / called
Espaigoullet / he did many marvelous deeds in arms. He took on a time by
scalynge the castle of Armayle / while the lord thereof / sir Raymonde was
gone to Tholous / and he kept it more than a year. and in the mean season
while he kept it / he caused to be made a mine and a cave / which went out of
the castle in to the feldes: And when the cave was made / he closed up the
enter with stones / so that it could not be parceyued that any way was there
under the yerthe. And in the same mean season the lord Raymonde of Armayle
treated with Espayguollet / to have again his castle for money. When the cave
was finysshed / he agreed with the lord to deliver up the castle for two
thousand frankes / and he and all his to deperte Than the lord entered again
in to his castle and repaired it where it was in defaulte. And a fyftene days
after Espaiguollet with his company in a night came to the wode where the issue
of the cave was / and entered in to it. And so at the hour of mydnight they took
the castle / and the lord lyenge in his bed / and raunsomed him again at
two thousand frankes / and than let him go / but Espayguollet kept still the
castle and a good garrison / which after sore traueyled the country with
other of his alyaunce and company.

FOr these manner of people that robbed and pylled thus in the marches of
Tholous / of Rouergue / and there about / under the color of the Englysshmen /
Therefore thither was sent sir Gaultier of Paschac with a certain nombre of men
of arms / to deliver the country fro their enemies. And so he came to Tholous
/ and sent for the knights and squyers therabout / and wrote to sir Roger of
Spaygne seneschall of Carcassone who came to serve him / for sir Gaultier had a
co^missyon general over all the officers of Languedocke and so all such as
were sent for / came with such nombres as they might make. Sir Roger of Spain
came with a threscore spears and a hundred pauesses / and the seneschall of
Rouergue and sir Hugh Frodeuyll came with as many or mo. So when they were all
together / they were a four.C. spears and a.M. pauesses. And also there was the
son of therle of Tereache with a fair company / the lord of barbason sir
Benedic of Faguell / and Willm^ Caudron breto^ and their co^panyes: so one day
they departed fro Tholous and came before saint Forgette / and there rested:
and there was captain a man of Bierne a great robber / called the bourge of
Taylsacke. When these lords and their companyes were come before Forget / they
incontinent went to the assaut / and the genowayes began sore to shote / so yt
scant they within durst apere at their defense / but the frenchmen mist of
their purpose at this first assaute* and so there they lodged all night and
took their ease / for they had enough wherewith. In the morning betymes they
armed them through the host / and sowned their trumpettes to the assaute / and
so they came in good order to the foot of the dyke / he that had seen than (the
men of arms enter in to the dykes with their targettes over their heedes / and
tasted the dyke with their spears and passed over to the foot of the wall)
would have taken great pleasur. When the first were passed over the dyke / and
had showed the way to other: than other followed with great will / for it had been great blame to them / if they had than tarried behind / and their company
before. and such as followed them had matockes and pykes in their hands to
pearse withal the walls / and covered their heedes with targettes to receive
the stones that were cast down / which were no great plenty / for the
genowayes shot so surely with their crosbowes / that non durst put out their
heedes to their defense / for the genoways crosbowes shot so surely / that
lightly they mist not of their level / so that there were many within sore
hurt with their quarelles / in so much that they doughted sore the shot.
This saute was so sore continued that the mynours ouerthrewe a pane of the
wall: Than they within were sore abashed and would than have yielded them
their / lives saved / but their enemies had no lust thereto / for they fell in
to so good hands that they were all slain. for sir Galtier their captain
commanded that it should so be. so there were none taken to mercy / but all
slain / not one that escaped. Thus these lords of France at their first
coming had the castle of Forget / and sir Gaultier delivered it to the owner
thereof / who lost it the same year before for lack of good keeping / as diverse
other castelles had been before in France.

AFter the taking of the castle of Forge^ and that sir Gaultier had delivered
it to ye owner / the knight new repaired it where as need was / for the
french men had sore dystroyed it in ye assayling thereof or it were won. Than
they went to the castle of Basse / of which Erualton of Batefoyle was
capitayn / and had greatly fortifyed it / for he thought the french men would
visyte him / as they did. And when the french men came thither they laid
siege thereto / and than aduysed on which perte they might best for their
advantage give assaute / and determined on a place / and so on a day they came
to the saut on that part as they thought most feeble. There the Genowayes
crosbowes were ordained to shote / and the assauters behind the^ / and they
acquyted them self truly in doing of their feate / for they shot so rudely at
them within / that non durst show themself. Erualton of Batefoyle was at ye
gate where there was a great assaute / and there he did marvelous in arms /
so much / that his enemies said among them self. Behold yonder is a squire
of great heart / on whom his harness is well enployed / for he valyantly
defended him self. It were well done some body to show him / that it were
best for him to yield up the castle / and to depart some where else / And to
show him that if sir Gaultier of Paschac win him parforce / there is no man
can save him fro the death / for he has sworn as many as he wynneth parforce
/ shall all dye or be hanged. Than the seneschall of Tholous commanded a
squire of Gascoyne called Wyllyam Alyedell / who knew right well Erualton /
for he had been diverse times with him in arms as his companyon / and he was
glad to go / for he was loathe that Erualton should have hadd any damage / if
he might do him any good: And so he came to the assaute and made token / that
he would speak with Erualton for his great profit / and he answered he was
content. Than the saut rested on that side but not on the other part: Than
this Wylliam said. Erualton ye are happy / for certain of yonder lords have
send me to you for they have pity on you / for if ye be taken parforce there
is no remedy but death: Our soueraygne captain has so ordained / that you
nor none of yours shall escape death / but to be served as they were of saint
Forget. therefore they and I also would counsel you to yield up ye fortress /
rather than to abide thadue^ture: for of one thing ye may be / sure / we shall
not depart hens till ye be taken / Than Erualton said / William / I know well
though at this time ye be against me / that ye would not counsel me to any
thing to my dishonor. Know for truth that if I render up the hold / it
shall be so that I and all mine may safely depart / and carye with us as much
as we may / and to be safely conducted to the castle of Lourde. On this
condycion I will her ken to you or else not. Sir quod Wylliam / I have not so
far charge to commen with you / but gladly I shall speak for you to my
masters And so he returned to the seneschall of Tholous and showed him all
these words / Than sir Hughe of Frodeuyll said. Let us go and speak with sir
Gaultier / for I can not tell what he will do / sith I have gone so far in
the matter I will se what he will do. Than they came to sir Gaultier who was
still at the saute / and sir Hughe of Frodeuyll said. Sir Gaultier / I have
treated with the captain of the castle and he is well willing to yield up
the castle to us as it is / so that he and all his may go quite with all that
they may carry with them / and to be safely conducted to the castle of Lourde.
Therefore now sir look what ye will do / if we should lose one of our knights
or squyers / outher by shot or cast of stones / or by any perylous accident
it should be gretter damage than we can have any profit by puttyng of them to
death when we have won them / which is not yet / for or they be won it will
cost us some of our people. sir that is true quod the seneschall of Carcassone
/ such assautes can not be without some death and sore hurtyng.

TO those words sir Galtier of paschac said. I am well content / cease the
assaut we have more to do in other places. Thus little and little we shall
win the castelles that these pyllers hold / though they depart now with a
good market. Paraduenture herafter they may fall again in our hands / and
than one time they shall pay for all / ever yuell deeds come to an yuell end.
In my days I have hanged and drowned of such robbers five hundred / and
hereafter they shall come to the fame prick. Than they that went on this
treaty / came again to the barryers to Erualton Batefoyle: Than Wylliam said
/ by my faith Erualton / you and all yours may thank god and sir Hughe of
Frodeuyll / for he has made your treaty as ye demand. ye may depart safely
and all yours / and bear away as much as ye can / and ye shall be safely
brought to Lourde. Well quod Erualton I am content / sithe it will be no
better. Know for truth Wylliam / I shall depart fro this fortress sore
against my will / for I have had great profit thereby / sith I was taken at the
bridge at Turnay beside Maluoysin / by the Burge of spaygne / who had of me for
my rau^some two thousand frankes. To say truth / I have well recovered my
self here / and ever have been here in these fronters which I love well / for
when so ever I rode forth / lyghtely I found some good aue^ture / outher by
some merchant of Robeston of Tholous / or of Rodes / for the most part ever
I gatte somewhat: Than Wylliam said / sir I believe you well / but and ye will
become french I undertake ye shall be clean pardoned / and to have a thousand
fra^kes given you / and I will become your surety that ye shall be ever good
french / if ye will swear your self so to be. Sir quod Erualton I thank you
/ but as for that I will not / for I will be still as yet English: as god
help me I can not find in my heart to be good french. Return to your
company and show them that this day we will order our business / and to
morrow in the morning we shall deliver up the castle / and depart / Wherefore
se that our conducte be ready.

So than ceased the saute and the frenchemen went to their lodgings / and so
passed the night at their ease / they had well wherewith. and in the morning
when every man was ready in the host / and that they were ready yt should
conducte the co^panyons to the castle of lourde Than sir Hughe Frodeuyll
seneschall of Tholous went to take possessyon of the castle: and when he came
to the castle / he found Erualton of Batefoyle and his company ready to
depart / and had trussed all that they would carry Than a knight of Lourde
called sir Monant of Salenges conveyed the^ safely wheder they would. Thus the
castle of Basse was won / and a squire of the country had the keeping
thereof given him / and of the country / who was called Bertram of Montesquyen.
Than these frenchmen went forth and came to the castle of Pulpuron / whereof
the little Mechyne was sovereign capitayn / who had done great damage to the
country therabout / wherefore sir Galter of paschac swear by his fathers soul
yt non there should be take to (...) nor rau^some but all to be hanged if he
might get the^ / and so there (...) his siege. This castle stood on a rock
a goodly castle to look on / and there sir Gaultier swear never to depart
thens till he had them at his pleasure / the^ were many assautes but they wan
but little / for the castle was well defended. Well quod sir Galtier / I can
not tell how it will be. The french king is rich enough to keep a sege here
/ but as for me I will not depart in one year / without I have the castle at
my pleasure / and such as were with him believed him well / and ordered them
self thereafter: And I shall show you how it fortued. When the capitayns
within saw surely how the frenchmen would not deperte thens till they had the
castle / what soever it cost them: Than they douted the^ / and aduysed to
depart thens wheder the frenchmen would or not / which they might well do /
for they had a cave that went out of the castle under the ground in to a
wode half a leage of: so when Angerot capiteyne of the castle saw the
dealyng of the frenchmen / and knew how they had promised not to deperte
thens till they had the castle / outher by famyne or otherwise / than he
douted and said to his company. Sirs / Ise well sir Gaultier of Paschac has
us greatly in hatered / and I fear by long siege he should famysshe us / and
that to do he needs not / but to make a bastyde and let it be kept but with a
hundred spears so that none of us than dare deperte: Therefore I shall show
you what we shall do Let us take all that we have and in the night we will
depart by this cave under the earth / which is fair and great and without
faut it shall bring us in to a wode a leage hens / than shall we be out of all
parell / for there is no man in the host that knows it. They all agreed to
his counsel / and in a night when they had all trussed than they took
torches and fagottes and entered in to the cave / which was fair and clear /
and so they issued out thereof in to a wode half a leage fro the castle / Than
the^ were ynowe that knew the ways to other forteresses in Lymosin and in
Rouergue / and some of them when they were out of all parelles / took other
ways and said / How they would follow the wars no lengar / Angerot and five
with him went to a town and a castle in Piergourt called Mountroyall / and
the lord thereof received him swetely / for he and all his lands were good
english / nor he would never turn french when other did howbeit there were
diverse other of his opynion.

THus they of the garyson of Pulpuron saved them self / and left no person be
hynde them / and were nere the^ as they would be / or the frenchmen knew of
their depertynge / The third day after their departing / the fre^chemen
ordained to give assaut / and they had made an ingyn with four stages / and in
every stage there might be twenty cross bows: And when all was ready they set
forth this ingyn / the which they named / Pass on before to the weykest side
of the castle / and the geno ways within the ingyn: and when it was there as
they would have it / there they shot against the castle and no body did
appear. Than anon they parceyued that the castle was void / because no body
came to their defense / than they ceased their shot because they would not
lose their quarelles. Than they came down fro the ingyn and came to ye
capitayns who had marueyle what they meant / and than they said. Sirs / without
fail there is no body within the castle. How know you that quod sir
Gaultier? Sir quod they we know it / for there is none appears at their
defense for all our shot. Than the^ were ordained ladders to set up against
the walls / and they that mounted on them passed over the walls and entered in
to the castle / and found no creature therein: And than they went to the gate
and there they found a great bundell of kayes / and among other they found
the kaye of the gate and opyned it / and than all the barryers one after
another / whereof the lords had great marueyle / and specially sir Gaultier of
Paschac / he wend they had been deperted out of the castle by enchau^tment /
and than demanded of them that were about him how it might be The seneschall
of Tholous said to him. Sir surely they can not be thus gone without they have
some secret way under the earth / which I think there be. Thanne all the
castle was sought in every corner / where any such way should be. There they
found in a Cellar the mouth of the alley open / and there all the lords did
behold it / and sir Galtier had great marueyle thereof / and demanded of the
S^neschall of Tholous if he knew before of any (...) sir quod he / I have
herd or this thereof / but I thought nothing that they would have thus departed
by that way. By my faith quod sir Gaultier / they begone the same way Have
the castelles of this country such ordinance: Sir quod sir Hughe / there be
diverse such castelles as of old time perteyned to Raynalt of Montabon / that
has such co^ueyau^ce / for when he and his brethren kept war against
king Charlemayne of frannce they were made all after this manner by the
counsel and advise of Maugis their cosyn / for when ye king besyeged them by
puyssaunce and that they saw they could not resyst him then they would
depart without any leave taking by means of these passages under the earth.
Surely said sir Brews I lawde greatly yt ordinance / I can not say if ever I
shall have any war against me or not other by king duke / or by any other
neighbor that I have / but as soon as I am returned in to my country I
shall cause such a mine to be made in my castle of Pasac. So thus they took
possessyon of the castle and set therein men of war to keep there a garyson /
and so then they went further toward ye castle of Conuall where Espaygnolet
of papereaw basque was capytayne and with him a good nombre of these pyllers
and robbers.

SO these lords and their company came to the garyson of Conuall in Robestan
and laid syege thereto / and then sir Gaultyer demanded of the seneshall of
Tholous if Conuall auncyently perteyned to raynalte of Monutalban / and he said
yes / then there is a cave under the ground said sir Gaultyer / sir that is
true said sir Brews for by reason there of Espaygnolet wanne it the second time
and the owner within it / then fyr Gaultyer sent for ye knight that was owner
thereof and said to him / sir it were good ye enfourmed us of the mine yt is out
of this castle and the issue thereof Then sir Raymonde of Conuall said / sir
surely there is a way under the ground for there by I was taken and lost this
my castle / it was before of long time decayed and destroyed but these robbers
new repaired it / and by yt way they came on me / and sir the issue thereof is
in a wood not far hence / well said sir Gaultyer all is well / and so.iiii.
days after he went to the same wood and had with him.CC. men well armed / and
when he saw the hole where the issue was he caused the earth and busshes to be
avoided / and then he lyghted up many fagottes and said to them yt were
ordained to go into the cave / sir follow this cave and it shall bring you in
to the hall of Conuall and there ye shall find a door break it up ye are
strong enough so to do and to fight with them with in / so they entered and
came to ye greece nere to the hall door in ye castle / then with great axes
they struck at the door and by yt time it was nere night / they within the
castle made good watch and perceived how by the mine they would have entered
in to the castle and Espaygnolet was going to his rest / then he came thither
/ and there they cast stones / benches / and tymbre before the cave door to ye
entente that none should enter there though the door were broken up. This was
done for other shyfte had they none of defense / but for all that they with in
the mine anon brake the door all to pieces / and yet were. never the nere / for
then they had more to do then they had before / and when they saw it was
impossible for them to enter there they returned again to the oost / and by
that time it was myduyght / the^ they showed what they had found and how they
of Conuall had perceived them and had so fortefyed the cave door that it was
not possible to enter by that way in to the castle.

How the castelles of Conuall / of Bygore and of Mesnyll were taken and all
they within taken slain and hanged. Ca. xxxix.
THen sir Gaultyer of Paschat sent to Basse for the great engyne which was
taken down and brought thither and raised up on his wheles as it should be /
and also they apparelled other instruments for ye assawre / and when al was
ready then sir Gaultyer who greatly desired to win this castle caused his
Trompettes to sown to the assawte / there was the seneshall of Toulouse with
his company on ye one side and sir Roger of spain seneshal of Carcasso^ on the
other side / also there was the lord of Barbaran / sir Benedic and lord of
Benoch / the lord of the countye of Desterac / sir Raymonde of lysle and other
knights and squyers of the country / then they began the sawte and they
within to defend themself which was need for they saw themself in a hard
part / they knew well how sir Gaultyer would take none to mercy / therefore
they thought to defend themself as long as they might and to sell their
lives derely / there the Geneways cross bows shot sore and hurt many within
so that there were none within but doubted gretely / and there sir Gaultyer of
Pasac did meruayles in arms and said to his company / what syr^ shall these
rascalles hold us in hand all this day thus / if it were against good men
of arms I would not marvel / for in them were mo feaces of war then in
these rascalles that be within. It is mine intent to dyne within the castle.
Now it shall be seen if ye will accomplysshe my desire / with those words
such as desired his good will aduau^ced themself forth / they took many
ladders and set them up against the wall where as the engyne stood with the
cross bows / who shot so fyersly that none within durst show themself Thus
by clean assawte ye Frensshe men entered in to ye castle of Conual their swords
in their hands chasynge their enemies / and there were many slain and the
other taken / then every man entered in at ye gates / then it was demanded of
sir Gaultyer what should be done with the^ that were taken. By saint George
said he / I will they be all hanged / and incontinent his commandment was
done / and Espaygnoy let began first. So the lords dyned in the castle / and
the other people in the town / and there they tarried all that day^. And sir
Gaultyer delivered again to ye lord of Conuall his town and castle / and
then ordained to depart thens.

THus after the taking of the castle of Conuall as ye have herd / the
Frenssh men went to another hold called Mastull which had done great damage
to ye country with other and there they made assawte / and they wtin defended
themself / but yt was not long for by clean assawte they were won and the
castle also / and all that was within slain and hanged up. And when they of
Ratchfort and of other castelles knew how sir Gaultyer had won so many
castelles / and that he took none to mercy / but outher slain or hanged / they
doubted much for coming to the same end / wherefore they departed in ye night
time I can not tell whether they went under the ground or above / for between
ye castle of Rochefort and the castle of Royr were caves under the earth /
for auncyently they perteyned to Raynolde of Mountalban. So the Frensshmen
found these castelles clean void when they came thither / then they newely
repeopled it with men of war and prouysyon. Then they took their way toward
Tholous to go in to Bygore / for on ye fronter of Tarbe there were two
castelles the one called Thedos Iulyan / and the other Nauaret which gretely
trauayled the country and ye good town of Tarbe and the lands of the lord
Dauchyn.

WHen sir Gaultyer of Pasac and the lords of France and of Languedoc had well
refresshed them in the Cite of Tholous then they departed and took the way in
to Bygore / and so came before the castle of ledos July a^ / and there tarried
and said they would goo no further till they had won it / thither came to sir
Gaultyer of Pasac ye Seneshal of Nob^san perteynynge to the Earl of Foys for
sir Gaultyer had sent for him to help to drive out of the country the
pyllers and robbers who had run as well in the country of Nobessan as in
other places. Also ye Earl of Foys consented that he should so do / or else he
durst not have done so / they were before dos Iulya^ xv. days or they had it /
yt castle was strong and a good capytayne therein a squire of Gascoyn called
Bruer de Brom. Howbeit they at the last had it / not by assawte / but by
treaty / they within departed their lives and goods saved. And also they were
falsely conuayed to Lowrde by a squyre called Bertram of Mountdyghen. And when
these lords of France had Dos Iulyen then they took advise whether they might
keep it still or raze it down to the earth / then it was counsayled to beat it
down because of them of Lowrde who were crafty and subtyle / fearing yt when
they should be gone that they would win it again / so it was better down
and as yet the stones lie on a hepe and lykely never to be builded again /
thus became of Dos Iulyan / the^ they went before Nauaret wherein there was
also companyons adue^turers who had kept it more then a year / and when they
knew how they of dos Iulya^ were departed in like wise did they and had a
saufconduyte and went to lowrde which was their chief refuge for they knew
well no man would seek the^ there with out they would lose their pain for ye
castle of Lowrde was impossyble to be taken by force.

WHen the Frensshe men had rased the castle of Dos Iulya^ / then they went to
Nauaret and found it all void / then it was ordained to be beten down and so
it was / Whereof they of Tarbe were nothing myscontent / for yt garyson had
done the^ great damage / then they went to the castle of Dauchen in Bygore
standing among the mountains in the enter of Byerne. And there they were
a.xv. days and in that season made diverse assawtes and wanne the base court
and al their horses / but there was a strong tower on the rock yt could not
be won. And when the lords saw how they lost there but their pain / and
yt Wyllyam Morenton who kept ye hold would not yield it up / nor sell it /
nor herke^ to no treatye / the^ they departed and returned to Tarbe / and then
sir Ganltyer of Passac gave leave to all his men of war to depart / and they
were paid of their wages / or had suffycyent sygnement / so yt they were
pleased / and he went to Carcasson and theraboute / and refresshed him. And
while he lay there / tidings came to him out of France and a commandment
fro the king that he should draw to the garyson of Bounteuyll Xainton on the
marches of Burdeloys and Poyctou / which garyson was kept by a capytayne
called Saint Foy a gascoyne. And it was said in france yt sir John^ Harpedan
seneshall of Burdeaus made a great assemble of men of war at Lyborne to raise
the bastydes yt they of Poictou and of Xainton had laid before Bounteuyll.
To the kings commandment obeyed sir Gaultyer as it was reason and took with
him a.lx. speres and a.C. cross bows Geneuoys / and so departed fro Carcasson
/ and passed by Rouergue / Again / and costed Pierregourt and so came to
Bounteuyll and found there the seneshalles of Rochel / of Poictou / of
Pierregourt / and of Dagen and a great nombre of men of war. In far
countres it may be well meruayled of the noble royalme of France / therein is
so many Cytees / towns / castelles / which be without nombre / and that as
well in farte parties thereof / as in the heart of the royalme / ye shall find
going from the cite of Tholous to the cite of Burdeaus stondynge on the river
of Garon. First Langurant / Rions / Caldiac / Bangou / saint Macayre / the
castle of Dorthe / Candoch / Geronde / larull myllant / saint Basyll /
Marmande / Co^mont / Tannus Lemnas / Dagenes / Montour / Agyllon / thouars /
port saint Mary / clermont / Again / ambyllart / castle sarasyne / Iehedo /
verdun / and vell mote / and then taking the way by the ryuere of Dordone
which falls in to Garon / ye shall find these castelles on the one side and
on ye other. Brouech / Frousach / liborne / saint Milion / Chatellon / the mote
/ saint Pesant / Montremell / and saint Foy / Bergerach / Mortquinormons / and
the castle oftene. And these castles some were English and some Frensshe and
so contynewed all the war season / the Gascoynes would have had it none
otherwise to have chosen / for in.xx. year they never made oath nor promise to
any man / true it was of ye Gascoynes. First by their means king Edward had
chief possessyon of Gascoyne / and also the prince his sone and after they put
the again fro it as it is clearly contained in this hystory / and by the good
wit and aduyce of king Charles sone to king John^ / he drew to his love by
fair means and great gifts ye grettest lords of all Gascoyne / as ye earl
of Armynake and the lord Dalbret. The prince lost them by pride / for I Johan
Froysarde who wrote this hystory the same season that I was at Buroeaus / and
yt the prince went in to Spain ye English me^ were so proud yt they set
nothing by any nacyon but by their own / for the gentylmen of Gascoyne and of
Acquitayne such as lost their goods in ye war / yet they could get no
manner of office in their coun^rees / for the Englysshemen said they were not
worthy nor able to have any wherewith they were sore grudged in their minds /
and when they might they showed it for because of the hardness that ye Earl of
Armynacke and the lord Dalbret found in ye prince / they forsook him and
became Frensshe / and so did diverse other knights and squyers of Gascoyne /
king Phylyp of France / and king John^ his sone had lost the^ by pride and
high mind / in like wise so did ye prince and king Charles win them by
fayrnes / by larges and humylyte / for so would Gascoynes be delte withal /
and king Charles to the entente that the love of these lords should the
longer contynewe / he made a marriage between the sister of the lady Isabell of
Burbon / and the lord Dalbret / and between them were fair children / and for
this cause the love endured the longer / and on a time at Paris where as I was
I herd the lord Dalbret speak a word / which I well noted / but I believe he
spoke it but in sport / howbeit he spoke it in great sadness to a knight of
Brytayne who had served him before / for the knight had demanded him of ye
busynes of his country / and how he was content to be frensshe / he answered
and said / I thank god I do metely well / howbeit I had more money / and my
me^ also / when we made war for the king of England then we have now for when
we rode forth at adventure we found ever some rich merchaunt other of
Tholous / Condon / or Bergerath lyghtely there was no day but we gate cuer some
good pray Then we were fresshe and Ioly / and now we be as deed then the
knight began to laughe and said truly this is a life of Gascoynes / lightly
they would ever have other me^nes damage Therefore I that hard these words say
as I thought yt the lord Dalbret repented him in yt he was become frensshe as
ye lord of Musydent Gascoyne who was taken at the battle of Anne^ / and swear
in to the hands of the duke of Aniow yt he would come to Paris / and become
frensshe ever after / so he came to Paris and king Charles made him good chere
/ but for all yt ever the king did / ye lord of Musydent departed again fro
Paris without any leave and went in to his country and became again English
/ and brake all ye promyses yt he had made with the duke of Aniow. In likewise
so did the lord of Rousen / the lord of Duras / and the lord of Languerant.
Such is the nacyon of Gascoyne they be not stable / for they love yet the
English men better then the frenssheme^ for their war against ye Frensshe
men were more profytabe for them then against the English men / this is the
pryncypall incydent yt most inclyneth them thereto.

How the king of Cypres was slain and murdered in his bed by his own
brother by exhortacyon and corrupcyon of the infydelles / for the bountye and
hardness that was in him Capitulum.xl.
IN this same season there came other tidings i^ to frau^cefor th^der came
king Lyo^ of Armony / not with no great company / but as a man chased out of his
royalme whereof he was king / by the turks / and al his royalme was won /
except one castle standing on ye see / called Courthe / which was kept by
the Gen^uoys / because that castle was the key / issue and enter by the sea /
to go to Alexandria / and in to the Sowdans land for these Geneuoys gothe a
marchaundyse by the means of truage yt they pay in to Rude / and in to Prester
Iohn^s land / and in every place they are welcome / because of ye gold and
silver yt they brought thither / and for other merchau^dy se yt they exchange
in Alexandria / in Cayr / in Damas / and in other places among the Sara syns /
for in such manner the world is gouerued / for yt is not in one country is in
another and thereby every thing is known / and the Geneuoys be those yt
furthest does adventure their merchau^dyse. They be lords of ye ports of ye
se above ye Venisia^s / and more feared and doubted among the sarasyns the^
any other people on the sea / they be valiant men and of great entrepryse. A
Galy well furnysshed of ye Geneuoys dare well assay.iiii. Galeys of the
Sarasyns The turk and Tartaryes should do much damage to crystendome if the
Geneuoys were not / because they be renomed to be chief lords of the sea /
marchynge on infydelles / therefore they have ever.l. Galeys and great ships
rynnynge on the sea to defend the Isles / as ye I Will of Cypres the I Will of Rodes
/ ye I Will dostye and all the bounds of the sea and Greece unto Turkye / and they
have the town and castle of Pere sto^dynge on the sea before Constantyne le
noble / which is kept at their cost and charge / and.iii. or iiii. times
every year it is refresshed with yt / yt is necessary / the Tartaryes and
Turks have diverse times assayed to get it / but they could never attain
thereto / for they have ever lost there more then they have won / for ye
castle of Pere stondeth on a rock / and there is but one enter / which the
Geneuoys gretely did fortefye. Also the Geneuoys have the town and castle of
Jason / which is right noble and a great profit to them and to other nere
countres of crystendome / for if Pere / Jason / Stycye / and Rodes were not
with the aid of the Geneuoys / the infydelles would soon come to Gaiet / yea
and to Naples / to the port of Cornet / and to Rome but ye said garysons /
which always be well provided for with men of war / and Geneuoys with the
ships and galeys are ever ready to defend them / wherefore the Turks dare not
adventure on that parties / but yt they do is on ye fronters of Constantyne le
noble / and toward Hungery / if the noble king of Cypres Peter of Liesieguen
who was so noble and valynnt a prince and had conquered ye great cite of
Alexa^drie and Satalye if he had lived longer he would have given the Sowdan
and Turks so much a do / that sith Godfrey of Boloyns days they had never so
much / and yt right well knew the Turks / and Tartaryes / and infydelles /
such as knew his prowes and high deeds / and therefore to have him dystroyed
they made merchaundyse with the kings brother called Iaquet yt he should slay
the king his brother / and so he did for he slew him in his bed / which was a
foul deed for blood / to slay so valiant a man as was the king of Cypres /
who intended and ymagened night and day on none other thing but how he might
win the holy land / and to have it out of the hands of ye infydelles / and
sir Phelyp of Maysyeres chancellor to Peter of Liesiegnen king of Cypres
wrote on his tomb as it follows / the copy whereof is in ye chapter house of
the freer Celestynes in Paris Peter of Liesiegnen ye.vi. king latyne of
Iherusale^ after Godfrey of Boloyne / and king of Cypres / who by his great
prowes and high empryse took by battle at his cost these Cytees. Alexandrie
in Egypt / Triple in Surie Layas in Armony / Sytalie in Turkye / and diverse
other Cytees and castelles on ye infydelles and enemies of the law of Ihesu
Christ (Animaeius requiescat in pace) And when the Geneuoys who loved him
gretely as it was reason / when they knew of his death they prepared.vii.
Galyes and sent them in to Cypres and took there perforce the cite of Samagose
and Iaquet within it / and over ran the best part of ye royalme / and would
have destroyed the royalme but because there were strong towns and fortresses
to keep fronter war against the turks / therefore they left them still in the
men's hands of the country / except the cite of Samagose / which they kept
still and fortefyed it / but when they wanne it first they had there great
riches / and so they led with them to Genes this Iaquet who had murdered his
brother True it was this king of Cypres had a fair sone whom they married and
crowned king / and put this Iaquet in to strayte prison / and would not put
him to death / and kept still in their hands Samagose / I know not if they
keep it as yet or no / then within a season after ye young king of Cypres dyed
in his bed / whereof ye Geneuoys were sore dyspleased / but they could not
amend it / so ye land was without any heir / I can not tell who governs it
now / but the same year yt I was in the earl of Foys house / it was showed me
by a knight of Biern the lord of Valenchyn / how the Geneuoys had a great
part of the land / and held still Samagose / and how they of the country had
crowned to their king / the said Iaquet for lack of other heir / I can not
tell by what means he came out of prison and out of the hands of ye Geneuoys
/ when the said king Lion of Armony came first in to France / ye king there
and the lords made him good chere / as it was reason / for he was come thither
out of a far country / and so by him and his was known tidings of the
royalme of Greece / and of the Empire of Constantyne le noble / for he was
examyned of the puyssaunce of ye Turks and of the Tarcaries who had put him
out of his royalme / he answered and said yt the great Taco^ of Tarcarie had
always made him war / and it was he yt had put him out of his royalme / the^
he was demauded if yt Tacon of Tartarie were puys;saunt / ye truly said he /
for by his puyssaunce with the puyssaunce of the sowdan he has subdued the
emperor of Constantyne le noble kept the laws of the Tartaries. The king
answered and said nay. But the Tacon of Tactarie and the sowdan have long made
war against the Emperor of Constantyne le noble / at the last he was feign
to make his end or else he could have no peace / which emperor of
Co^stantyne le noble was sone to my lady Mary of Burbon / and sone to the
emperor Hugues of lesiegne^ / which emperor was feign to give his daughter
in marriage ^o ye sone of ye Taco^ of Tarcarie. Howbeit the emperor abides
still in his cry^te^ law / and all is by reason of comyctyon of this marriage.
The^ it was demanded of him what ye earl Co^^er of Sauoy did in yt country
seeing he was so valiant a man and had so great a puyssaunce / then the king
answered and said / yt when the earl of Sauoy was in ye empire of Hu^gry and
made war against the turks and tartaryes / there by his valyauntnes he
conquered on the Tartaryes / and on the Sowdans land two good towns / as
Calipole / and Lobeme / and left men there to keep them and after the return
of the earl of Sauoy / the towns were kept still cryste^ as long as the good
king of Cypres lived / but as soon as the Sowdan and the Tacon of Tartarie
knew of his death / they feared nothing the Empeof Constantyne le noble / but
raised an army of a.C.M. horsemen / and so came and ran before Co^stantyne le
noble / and fro thens they went and besyeged Calipole / and conquered it
perforce / and slew all the christian men yt were within it / and had made so
great war against the Emperor of Co^stantyne le noble yt all his puyssau^ce
could not resyst the^ / but they forbear him by reason of his daughter whom
the sone of ye great tacon coueted to have in marriage / which is a hard case
for the time to come / for the officers of the Tacon be as now in the cite of
Constantyne le noble / so yt the greeks there live under the^ / and by truage /
and if the kings christian put not thereto a remedy / or at length the matter
shall go so evil yt the Turks and Tartaries shall conquer all Greece / and
turn it to their believe / for so they make their auauntes / they do mock the
popes / whereof one is at Rome / and another at Auignyon. They say yt the.ii
gods of crystendome warreth each against other / whereby they afferme our law
to be the more feeble and the lyghter to be dystroyed / and condemned / they
lay thereto reason in yt they that should cxalte the christian faith / are ye
first that mynyssheth it / and dystroy it / then it was demanded of the king
of Armony whether that the Sowdan / and the Tacon of tartarie were.ii. of the
grettest princes among the infydelles yt were known with the Greeks / the
king answered and said / nay surely / they be not ye gretest for always the
turks are more noble / more greter / more sage / and more redoubted in war
as long as they have a good heed and governor / as they have had this.C. year
/ for though ye Tacon of Tartarie hold in subieccyon the Emperor of
Constantyne le noble / yet ye lord of Turkey holds in likewise ye Taco^ and
this lord of Turkey is called Lamorabaqum / and to say the truth he is a
valiant man in arms / and a wise man in his law of Lamorabaquin I compain
me not / for he never did me hurt / for he has always kept his war
against the Emperor of Hungery. Then ye lords of France demanded of him if
this Lamorabaqum were so great / and so feared as he said / ye truly said the
king of Armony / and more then I speak of / for the Emperor of Co^stantyne le
noble / and the Emperor of Hu^gery fears him in likewise does the Sowdan of
Babylon / and the Tacon of Tartarie / and as I have herd say of ye Tartaryes /
yt Tacon would or this time further have put under ye Emperor of Constantyne
le noble / but for doubt of Lamorabaqum / ye Tacon knows him and his nature
so well / for as soon as he knows one gretter then himself / he will never
have joy till he have put him under / Wherefore the Tacon will not do to
Co^stantyne le noble yt he might well do if he would / then he was demanded if
this Lamorabaquin had any great power of men / ye king said / ye surely / for
in.xxx. year where soever he went / he had ever in his company a.C.M. horses
always lodged in ye feldes / and never enters in to any town / and for his
guard he has ever.xx.M. turks ^ whereso ever he goes he has his fader with
him / and he himself is of a.lx. year of age / and his fader.lxxx. and.x. and
he loves much ye frenshe language / and such as comes thens / he desires
to se all the great lords of ye world / and ye frensshe king and his estate
and order / and one speak to him of France he is well content. Then ye king
was demanded why ye Lamorabaqum suffered ye Tacon in peace sith he was so great
an Emperor / because said ye king yt the Tacon fears him and dare make him
no war / and also there be certain towns and ports in Tartarie yt yearly
pays trybute to Lamorabaquin / and also they are al of one law / and they
will not lightly dystroy their own law / and he meruayleth gretely of ye war
among cryste^ me^ how each of them dystroyeth other / wherefore he is often in
mind to come in to cryste^dome and to win all before him I would he had won my
land rather the^ ye Tacon / for it had been better for me / he was demanded
why / and he answeswered and said. Lamorabaquin is a lord of noble co^dycyon /
and if he were.xxx. year younger he were lykely to make great co^questes where
as he would employ his war / for when he has won a country / town / or
sygnory / he desires nothing but truage / and leueth still every man in his
own believe / and he puts never no man fro his heritage / he desires
nothing but the sovereign domynacyon / Wherefore I say if he had conquered ye
royalme of Armony / as the Tartaries have suffered me in peace / and my royalme
still in our own believe by knowled gynge him as my sovereign / as other great
lords do / yt march nere him / as the Greeks and Tracyens who take him for
their sovereign lord / whereby they are out of doubt of the soueraynte of the
Sowdan / and of the Tacon of Tartarie / the lord of Satalie / and the lord
dela Palice / and the lord of Hawlte lodge / these.iii. lords and their
lands are in peace by reason of a truage yt they pay to Lamorabaquin / there is
no Turk nor Tartarien yt dare do the^ any wrong or damage / then it was
demanded of ye king of Armony if his land were so clearly lost that it might
not be recovered again / truly said the king it is without recovery /
without the puyssaunce of crystendome come thither stronger the^ the Turks and
Tartaries for as I have said / the ferther they come forward / more they are
lykely to co^quere / for except one town called Courth / which is the first
town of the royalme of Armony / and is as yet in the christian men's hands /
al ye resydue of ye royalme is in ye infydels hands / and where as ye chyrches
were wont to be / there they set up their ydolles and their mawmettes / then
it was demanded if the town of Courth were strong / ye truly said ye king
/ it will not be won without it be by long syege / or else betrayed / for
it stands nere to the sea in a dry place between.ii. rocks / which ca^ not
be approached / for if yt Turks or Tartaries had it in their hands and another
good town not far thens called Adelphe / all Greece were dystroyed / and
Hungery should have much a do. Then it was demanded if Hungery marched nere
to Tartarie and to the Turks / the king said / ye truly and nerer to the
Turks and Lamorabaquin then to any other / then the lords said / it is great
marvel ye Lamorabaquin suffers him to be in rest sith he marches so nere
to Hungery / and he being so valiant a man and so great a conqueror. In the
name of god said the king of Armony / or this time he has studied as much as
he might how to have done damage to the royalme of Hungery / and if an incydent
had not ben or this / he had been far in the country of Hungery / he was
demanded what incydent it was / and the king said I shall show you.

How the king of Armony was examyned / and how.xxx.M. Turks were slain and
dystroyed in the royalme of Hungery. Ca. xli.
WHen Lamordbaquin saw yt all ye lords yt marched nere to him fered and
doubted hi^ what for his co^questes and prowes / and how yt all the bounds of
ye see to hu^gery obeyed to him / also he saw well how ye valiant king of
Hungery Frederycke was deed / and how the royalme was fallen to a woman /
wherefore he aduysed him to conquer yt royalme / and so made a great somons in
Turkye / and such as he sent for came to him / and so the^ this Lamorabaquin
went forth and lodged in ye playnes of Satalie between Palice and Haulte lodge
/ to give more fear to his enemies / and his entencyo^ was to enter in to ye
royalme of Hu^gery / and because yt Hungery is a royalme and country closed
and en^yronned with high rocks and mountains / whereby it is ye stronger / the^
he sent before him his ambassadors and heraldes with a mulet charged with will /
and he commanded the^ to go in to Hungery to ye earl of Lazaran whose lands
lies by twene ye mountains of Melcabe and of Robee / which way he purposed
his army should pas and to show him how he commanded him if he think to live
in rest / and to have his land in peace yt he obey to us / in likewise as the
lord of Palice and the lord of Satalie / and the lord of Haulte lodge has
done / and yt he open and give us fre passage thrughe his lands / and if he
say s^ay and be rebel against us / then show him on our behalf yt I shall
bring as many men to dystroy his country as there be graynes of mylle in the
sack. The ambassadors departed well i^structed of yt they should do / and so
rode by their iourneys till they came in to Hungery in to ye land of the earl
Lazaran / and sou^de him in a castle of his called Archforme / and the earl
like a sage lord received these ambassadors right swetely and made the^ /
good chere / but he had marvel when he saw enter in to his court the mule
charged with a sack / and wist not what it was / he thought it had been gold
or precious stones yt Lamorabaquin had sent to him / to draw him thereby to
consent to suffer him to have fre passage through his country / howbeit he
said to himself yt he would never be corrupted for no manner of riches yt
should be presented to him. The^ these messagers came before the earl and said
/ sir of Lazaran understand / we be sent fro the high and redoubted lord
and sovereign king Lamorabaquin lord of Turkye with the apertenau^ces / and we
say to you on his behalf yt he commands you to come to his obey saunce / in
like manner as ye know yt your neighbors have done / as the lord de la Palice
ye lord of Haulte lodge / and the lord of Satalie have done to him homage /
and yt ye open to him the passages of your country / if ye thing to live in
rest / and in your so doing ye shall deserve gretely his grace and love / and
if ye rebel and disobey we are charged to say to you yt our lord Lamorabaquin
will bring in to your country mo me^ of arms then there be graynes of mylle
in this sack / and therwt they opened ye sa^ and showed him what was wtin it /
and when ye earl of Lazaran understood ye ambassadoure of Lamoraba^quin / and
determined in himself to answer temporatly / and would not dyscouer his
thought suddenly but said / close up ye sack I se right well what is therein /
and I have well hard what thing Lamorabaquin demands of me / and wtin
these.iii. days I shall make you an a^swere / for his request demau^deth
cou^sayl they answered and said / sir ye speak well / so trustyng to have
an^swere they tarried there.iii. days. Now shall I show you what ye earl of
Lazaran did in ye space of these.iii. days / he sent and provided in to ye
castle mo then.ii.M. capo^s and he^nes and closed the^ up in to a house without
any manner of mete / so yt in.iii. days they etc no thing / And when the day
came that he would answer the ambassadors / the^ he sent for them in to a
galary lokynge down in to a court and said / syrs come hyder and lean here
with me / and I shall show you a new thing / and so answer you / and they
knowing not what he would do / leaued down in a wyndowe by him / then the
gates were closed / and the court was great / so his men were ready to do as
he had ordained / then they opened a chamber door or.II. where as all the
pollayne were yt had eten no mete of.ii. days before. Then the servants took
the grain yt was in the sack / and cast it all about before the capons and
hens / so yt within half an hour all the corn was ete^ up clean / and would
have eten more if they had had it / then the earl said to the messagers / syrs
ye have seen how this grain which you have brought hyder from your master
is clean eten / and devoured / and brought to no thing by these pollayne / and
yet they would ere more if they had it yt is truesyr said they / whereby speak
you yt / I say said ye earl your answer lies therein / as by ensample ye have
seen / Lamoraba quin says yt if I obey him not he will bring in to my land
men of arms without nombre wherefore say unto him fro me / I will abide it and
he shall not bring so many / but they shall be al devoured as this corn is
devoured by this pollayne.

WHen the ambassadors hard this an swear they were right pensive / and so
took their leave and departed / and did so much by their iourneys yt they came
to Lamorabaquin and showed him what the earl said saying by semynge he set but
little by his manassyng / with this answer Lamorabaquin was sore dyspleased /
and said how the matter should not rest so / but whether the earl would or not
/ he would enter in to his country and in to hu^gery and how he would dystroy
the earls country by cause he answered him so presumptuously. Now shall I
show you what the crle did for he saw well he was defied of Lamorabaquin /
and knew well he should shortly here other tidings of him therefore he made
prouysyon to defend him / and wrote to al knights and squyers / and to other
to come to him to stop the enter of Lamorabaquin in to Hungery / co^maundynge
every man after the sight of his letters to draw to him / certefyenge the^
how Lamorabaquin was as then in ye playnes of Haulte loge / all such as the
earl sent for obeyed wyllyngly / and so came to the earl to defend christian
dome / and diverse came to him yt were not sent for / such as hard thereof /
to exalte christian faith / and to dystroy ye infydelles. Also the earl Lazaran
caused forestes and high trees to be hewe^ down / and laid trauers one over
another / whereby the Turks should not find out any new way / and then he
with all his power came to a certain passage / where as Lamorabaquin should
pass / to enter in to Hungery / the earl had with him a.x.M. men of Hungery
and x.M. cross bows and did set the^ on both sides of the way. And also he
had ready.ii.M. me^ of the country having great axes to cut down the trees
when he would have them / and when all this was done / then he said to them yt
were about him / syrs without doubt Lamorabaquin will come / sith he sent me
word he would do so / therefore syrs quyte yourselfe well and valyauntly to
keep and defend this passage / for if yt Turks win it al Hungery is in
great peril to be lost / we be here in a strong place / one of us is
worth.iiii. of them / and also we were better to dye with honor in defending
our herytages / and the faith of Jesus christ the^ to live inshame and seruage
under the dogs infydels though Lamorabaquin be a noble wise man in his law
/ sir said they we shall abide y^ adventure with you / let the Turks come when
they will / we shall be ready to receive them / of this ordenaunce and passage
the Turks knew nothing / for the earl of Lazaran for doubt of spies had set
men such as he trusted as well as himself to keep ye passages yt no man
should go to the Turks another day nor night.

LAmorabaquin forgate not his entrepryse / but said how he would go vysyte the
land of the earl of Lazaran / to his great damage / for he would not be
reputed for a liar in yt he had promised / so he took.lx.M. of his me^ / and
set over the^.iiii. capytaynes of his house hold / as the duke of Mansyon of
Mecque / ye keeper of Dan^et / Alphalor^ of Samarie / and ye prince of Cord
called Brachyn / and at their departing he said to the^ / syrs go your way with
your company / ye be suffycyent to open ye passages in to Hu^gery / and enter
in to ye land of ye earl of Lazaran / and dystroye it / and as soon as I may
know ye ye be there I shall come thither to you with all ye resydue of my people
/ for I will put all Hungery under my subiectyon / and after the royalme of
Almayne / the enchauntours of my country and of Egypt say it is my desteny
to be lord and king of all the world / and the place that I would most
gladlyest se is Rome / for auntyently it was of our enherytau^ce / for our
predecessors conquered and governed it diverse times / and there I will be
crowned / and Galafre of Landas / the racon of Tartarye / and the Sowdan of
Babylone shall crown me / then they who were before him on their knees answered
and said / sir we shall accomplysshe your desire: and commandment / and so
they departed with a.lx.M. Turks / among whom there were.xx.M. of the most
expert men of war and best armed of all Turkye / and they led the vowarde.
So long they iourneyed yt they came in among the mountains of Lazaryn they
found no let in the entering in to y^ country so ye vowarde entered in / and
the duke of Mecque and the duke of Daniuet led them / and so this vowarde
passed the Earl of Lazaryus enbusshement / and when the earl and the Hungeryons
saw their time they set their work me^ a work to cut down trees and to
stop so ye ways yt there could no mo enter / nor they that were comen in to
recule they were so closed in yt it was not possible for any man to go any
further / so there was thus enclosed a.xxx.M. turks / who we refyersly
assailed by the Hungaryons / and so handeled on both sides of the way that
they were there all slain / not one yt skaped / and the.ii. dukes also slain
/ some thought to have saved themself in the woods / but they were so chased
yt they were all slain / then they of the areregarde turned back when they
saw they could not enter for the trees yt stopped ye way so they returned to
Lamorabaqum and showed him the great myschef yt was fallen on his people /
whereof he was meruayllous sorry and dyspleased / the^ he called his counsel to
know what was best for him to do / for he had lost ye flower of all his
chyualry / and so returned and did no more at that time.

WHen ye king of Armony had showed all this / and his own estate to the
frenshe king / and to the barons of Fran^ce and to his counsel / they had of
him great pity and because he was come fro so far a country as Greece to seek
counsel and aid there / and because he was a king and chased out of his
royalme / and had as then no thing to live on to maynteyne his estate. The
frensshekynge as young as he was said / we will yt the king of Irmony who is
come hyder to se us in hope to have some comfort / help and aid of us to
keep his estate as it aperteyneth to him / who is a king as well as we be / and
when we may weshal aid him with men of war / and help to recover his
^herytau^ce whereto we have good will / for we are bound to exalte ye christian
faith. The frensshe kings words were well hard and understand / as it was
reason / and there were none yt said the contrary / the kings uncles and
counsel were desirous to accomplysshe his intent / so the king of Armony to
maynteyne his estate there was assygned to him a certain rent and revenues
out of the chamber of accomptes / and so was well and truly paid every month
/ his assygnement was a.vi.M. frankes by the year / and he had delivered him at
the first.v.M. fra^kes to provide for his lodgyng vessel and other things
necessary / and his lodging appointed at saint Andon beside saint Denyce there
to keep his house. Thus ye king of Armony was retained by ye Frensshe king at
his first coming / and daily he increased / and not apayred / and was sometime
with the frensshe king / and specially at high feestes.

How pope Urban and pope Clement were at great dyscorde together / and how the
christian kings were in varyaunce for their lectyons / and of the wars between
them. Ca. xlii.
THe same season there came to Au^gnyon to se the pope Clement / sir Oaths of
Bresnyl to have money for ye war he had made for him against ye Romans and
Bertram of A^gles / who wrote himself pope Urban ye vi. as it is contained in
his hystory here before and there sir Oaths showed diverse things to the pope /
and to ye Cardynalles / wherein he was well byleued and hard / but as for money
he could get none / for ye popes chamber was so clean voyded fro gold and
silver / yt ye Cardynals could not have ye money yt perteyned to their hattes.
So this sir Oaths of Bresnyll departed fro the^ not well content. At Auyg^yon
there was delivered him a.M. frankes / and he set little thereby / whereby pope
Clementes war was sore weked / for sir Oaths would in no wise meddle any more
in the popes wars. The^ Margaret of Duras who was at Gaiecte / and was
adversary against the queen of Naples wife sometime to king Jews duke of Aniow
She sent for this sir Oaths to aid her in y^ war yt she made against the
Napolytanes / and this sir Oaths a certain space exscused himself / and
dyssymuled and foded forth the time as he that wist not what to do / then some
of his counsel did put him in mind to go to this Margaret of Duras who was
enherytoure to Naples and to Cycyle / and to help to aid and to defend her
heritage / and to take her to his wife / for she was content to mary him
because he was of a noble blood and of high extraccyon / and was lord and
king of the country called Daure / and some other of his counsel counsayled
him contrary / saying how he might thereby come to an evil end / for the
children of king Jews of naples who was crowned king in the Cite of Bare
though they were but young / yet they had great friends and kynsmen / and
specially the frenlshe king their cosyne germayne who will aid them / and
their mother Johan duches of Amowe and of Mayneal these doubts some of his
counsel showed him / wherefore sir Oaths forbear a long season and dyssymuled
the matter and took none of both parties. The same season ye sowdyours of pope
Clement enclosed in ye Cite of Peras pope Urban / and was besyeged by the lord
of Moctroy a valiant knight of the countye of Genes and of Sauoy sir Talebart
a knight of the Rodes / and sir Bernarde de la sale. And there pope Urban was
sore constrained and on yt point to have been taken / for as I was then
informed for the some of.xx.M. frankes a capytayne almayne / who had a great
company with him called the earl Courant would have delivered pope Urban in to
ye hands of pope Clement / whereupon sir Bernarde de la sale was sent to
Auygnyon to pope Clement for ye said some of money / but the pope nor the
Cardynalles there could not make the money for ye popes court was so poor
that they had no money / and so sir Bernarde de la sale returned evil content
to the syege of Pruce / and so then they dyssymuled the matter / and the
Prucyens in likewise / and also this earl Courant and so pope Urban issued out
of Pruce and out of peril and went to Rome and abode there

I Know right well that in time to come there would be had much of these
things how the church should fall in such troubles and endure so long /
but it was a plage sent fro god / for the clargy to advise and to consydre well
their great estate and superfluyte that they were in but many did set little
thereby / for they were so blinded with pride that each one thought to be as
good as another / wherefore it went evil / and if our faith had not ben
confyrmed in ye hands and grace of ye holy ghost who ^nlumyned the heart of
them yt were gone out of the right way / and held them ferme in unity else
our faith had be gretely defourmed / but the great lords of the earth at the
beginning did nothing but laughe at the church / till I Cronycled these
Chronicles in the year of our lord Ihesu Christ.M.CCC.lxxx. and.x. much of the
common people meruayled how the great lords as the Frensshe king / the king
of Almayne / and other kings and princes of crystendome / did provide no
remedy in that case. There was one thing reasonable to appease the common
people / and to escuse the high princes and kings / dukes and Earls / and
other lords. As by ensample the yolke of the egg can not be without the white
/ nor the white with out the yolke / no more may the Clergy and the lords be
one without another / for the lords are governed by ye Clergy / or they could
not live but as beestes and the Clergy were not / and ye Clergy counsayleth and
exhorts the lords to do as they do. And I say surely I have been in my time
in diverse parties of the world / what for to accomplysshe my pleasure / and to
se noueltyes in the world / and to have knowledge of the conquestes and
adventures written in this book. And truly the season yt I went thus about in
the world I could lightly se no great lord / but that he had a marmoset / or
of ye Clergy / or a boy of simple lygnage mounted up to honor / by reason of
their Iangelyng and raylynge / except the earl of Foys / for he had never none
such / for he was naturally sage / for his wisdom was better / than any yt
could be given him / yet I say not that such lords as are ruled by such
marmosettes be fools / but rather more then fools / for they be sore blinded
/ and yet they have two eyes / when the knowledge came first to ye frensshe
king Charles of the dyfference between these two popes he did put the matter
on ye Clergy which way he should take them / they of the clergy of France
determined and took pope Clement for the most surest part / and to the
Frensshe opinion acorded the king of Castle and the king of Scotts because
all the season that the scysme was thus in the church / France / Castle and
Scotland were joined together by alyaunce / and the king of England / and ye
king of Portyngale were of the contrary oppynyo^ against their enemies / the
earl of Flaundres never inclined in his courage to pope Clement yt he should be
right pope because Vrba^ was first chosen at Rome / who was archebysshop of
Bare. This Clement being Cardynall of Geane wrote lettres unto the noble Earl
of Flaunders how there was a pope chosen by due electyon at Rome and named
Urban / wherefore he would not believe after on yt Clement / and as long as he
lyned he was of that opinion / so was the king of Almayne and all the Empire /
and also ye king of Hungry. Thus then I put in writing the state and
dyfferences yt I had seen in my days in the world and in ye church / it was
no marvel though ye lords of the world suffered and dyssymuled ye matter.
This brought to my remembrance how yt when I was but young / and pope
Innocent caygned in Auygnyon / he held in prison a freer mynoure called freer
John^ Roche Tayllad / this clerk as it was said / and I have herd it pryuely
in diverse places / he showed and aledged diverse auctorytes of the incydentes
and fortunes yt fell after in his days in ye royalme of France. And also he
spoke of the taking of king John^ / and showed certain things reasonable
how the church should suffer much for ye great superfluytes yt he saw in
them and while he was in prison it was showed me what he said to the Cardynall
of Ostie called Dearras / and to ye Cardynall of Auxere who went to vysyte him
and to argue with him / the^ he laid to them an ensample as hereafter ye shall
here.

Lords said this freer / there was ones a foul appeared in this world without
any feathers / and when al other fowls knew yt he was borne they came to se him
because he was so fair and pleasant to behold. Then they ymagyned among
them what they might do for this bird / for without feathers they knew well he
could not live / and they said they would he should live because he was so
fair / the^ every foul there gave him of their feathers / and the fayrer bird
the mo feathers he gave him / so that then he was a fair bird and a well
fethered and began to fle. And ye birds that had given him of their feathers
when they saw him flee they took great pleasure / and when this bird saw
himself so well fethered and that all other fowls honored him / he began to
ware proud and took no regard of them that had made him / but pycked and
spurred at them and was contrary to them. Then the other birds drew together
and demanded each other what was best to be done with this bird that they had
made up of naught and now so dysdayneth them / then the Pecocke said / he is
greatly beautyed by reason of my feathers / I will take them again fro him / in
the name of good said the Fawcon so will I have mine / and so said all the other
birds. And then they began to take again fro him all the feathers yt they had
given him. And when this bird saw that / he humbled himself and knowledged of
ye wealth and honor that he had / not of himself but of them / for he knew
that he came in to ye world naked and bare / and ye feathers that he had they
might well take fro him again when they list / then he cried them mercy / and
said that he would amend himself and no more be proud / and so then again
these gentle birds had pity on him and fethered him again / and said to him
we would gladly se ye f^e among us / so thou will be humble as thou ought
to be / but know surely / If thou be any more proud and dysdaynous we will
take from you all thy feathers and set the as we found you first Thus said ye
freer John^ ye Cardynalles that were in his presence. Syrs thus shall it fall
on you of the church / for the Emperor of Rome and of Almayne and the other
kings crystened / and high princes of the world have given you the goods
and possessions and riches to the entente to serve god / and ye spend it in
pride and superfluyte. ye read not the life of saint Syluester pope of Rome
after saint Peter / ymagyne and consider how the Emperor Co^stantyne gave him
first ye dysmes of ye church and on what condycyon. Saint Syluester rode
another with.CC. nor.CCC horse abroad in the world / but he held himself
symply closed in Rome / and lived soberly with them of the church / when the
angel of god showed him how ye Emperor Cousta^tyne who was as then but an
infydell should fend for him / in likewise the Emperor had it by reuelacyon
of an angel that Syluester should show him ye way of health / for he was
syke of the lypper / so yt his fless he fell in pieces and when Syluester came
before him he showed him the way of baptyme / and so crystened him / and
incontinent he was hole / for the which ye Emperor Constantyne byleued in
god and all his Empire / and gave to Syluester and to the church all the
dysmes / for before the Emperor of Rome held them / and beside that gave him
many fair gifts and great sygnyoryes augmentynge out faith and the church
but it was his entencyon that the goods and syguyoryes that he had given him
yt he should govern it humbly and truly / and not to spe^de it in pomp and
pride / but now a days they of the church do the contrary wherewith god is
dyspleased / and hereafter will be more dyspleased / so that the great lords
of the earth will ware cold in their deuocyons / and not be so lyberall in
gyuynge any thing to ye church. But rather to be ready to take fro it / yt was
given before and I think it will not be long or this besene. Thus this freer
John^ of Roche tayllayd whom the cardynalles held in prison in Auignyon
showed to them these words / and diverse other whereof the cardynalles were
abashed / and would gladly have put him to death if they might have found any
just cause against him. But they could find none / and so suffered him to live
/ but they durst not let him out of prison / for he showed his matters so
parfyte / and laid for him high scryptures / that peradventure he might have
made many in the world to have arred / Howbeit such as took more head to his
saying then I did saw many things fall after according as he said and
wrote in prison / and all yt he said he would prove by the apocalypse the true
prowes wherewith he armed himself who saved him fro brennynge / and also some
of the Cardynalles had pity on him and would not do their vttermoost to him.

Now let us leave to speak of these narracyons and return to our pryncypall
matter and hystory of Spain / of Portyngale / of France and of England / and
record the fortunes that fell in that season which be not to be forgotten. ye
have herd here before how king John otherwise called master denyce of
portyngale bastard brother to king Don Ferant was in possessyon of the royalme
of Portyngale / by the help all only of.iiii. Cytees in Portyngale. But as
for the nobles and knights of the royalme of Portyngale at the beginning
acquyted them truly to king Don Peter and to king John^ of Castle and to
his wife the lady Beatryce and yet though some held the opinion of that lady
/ nevertheless other named her a bastard for she was daughter to a lady in
Portyngale called Elynoure / who had as then her first husband on live a
knight of yt country sir John^ Laurence of Coygne / and ye king of Portyngale
had taken her fro him / and the king married her and put her husband out of
Portyngale who went and dwelled with the king of Castle for he durst not
dwell in Portyngale for fere of the king who held his wise / and yet he was
of high lygnage. These things are to be meruaylled at. For king Ferant of
Portyngale reputed his daughter as lawfully begotten for he had a dyspensacyon
of pope Urban the.vi. And then ye peace was made between the.ii. kings of
Castle and Portyngale and that a knight of the royalme of Portyngale called
sir John^ Ferant Andere who was chief of counsel with the king of Portyngale
treated of peace and made ye marriage between king Ferant of Portyngalles
daughter and king John^ of Castle who was as the^ a wyddower / and had married
before ye daughter of Don Peter king of Aragon / though ye king of Castle
and his counsel did cast all these doubts / and how they fered lest the
king of Portingales daughter should not be taken as heir of Portyngale after
her faders dysseas but to put in suretye thereof ye king of Castle the king
of Portyngale caused diverse of the chief lords of Portyngale to swear that
after the kings dysseas to take her as their lady / and to turn the royalme
of Portyngale to ye king of Castle. Also ye king of Portyngale had bound
certain good towns to the king of Castle to take him as their king on ye
pain of forfayture of.ii. thousand frankes / and though this knight Johan
Ferant Andere did his busynes for a good entente to make peace and concord
between Castle and Portyngale at ye instaunce of his lord / yet ye commons of
Lyrbone slew him / and chase to their king this master Deuyce / for they
said they would not be under the subiectyon of them of Castle / they hated
them so much / for they could never love together / and also they said yt the
crown of Portyngale might not go to a woman / and that the queen of Castle
was not true herytour but a bastard and worse then a bastard for king
Ferantes lyuynges / and after his death Johan Ferant of Coygne lived / who was
husband to that ladies mother / and therefore they chase this master Denyce and
was crowned by these.iiii. Cytees Lyrbone / Vyc / Eure / and the port of
Portyngale / they said they would have a king among them / and one of the
chief incydentes that moved ye commons to be against the king of Castle was as
I shall show you. The Spanyardes whom I call Castellyans when the marriage was
made between them and Portyngale / and that ye king of Portyngale had granted
that after his dysseas the royalme should go to the king of Castle / ever when
the Spanyardes met any of the Portyngales they would mock the^ and say /
syrs whether ye will or not now ye shall come to our danger / we shall hold
you under subiectyon and seruage / and keep you like slaves and Iues / and do
with you as we list / and they would answer and say they trusted that should
never be / and never to be under subiectyon of any other man living except god
/ and for such causes and words reprouable of the Spanyardes / ye Portyngales
took this master Denyce basterde brother to king Ferant and made him king /
in his broders days there was no reckoning made of him / nor the king / that
the commons would never have chosen him to their king / and forsake his
daughter as they did. Howbeit often times this said knight sir John^ Ferant
Andere said to the king / how that this master Denyce his basterde brother had
gretely the grace of the commons of the royalme / wherefore he said it had been
good he had been put to death / but king Ferant answered and said how the
commons should never have puyssau^ce to do any thing against the will of the
noble men of his country / and how that his sone in law the king of Castle
should ever be puyssaunt enough to constrayne them / and to chastyce them if
they rebelled after his dyssease / Wherefore he said there was no cause to put
his bastard brother to death nor put him in prison / sayng how he was his brother
and a man of relygyon and had enough to live on beside the crown of
Portyngale / and so he was left alive.

THese foresaid points and artycles be true / for I the auctoure of this book
have been sufficyently enfourmed thereof by the nobles of Portyngale / it is a
thing to be meruayled at / to make a bastard a king / and they of Portyngale
say / and as yet says / that the queen of Castle the lady B^autryce /
daughter to ye lady Elynour of Coygne was a bastard therefore they would not
take her as queen of Portyngale / nor none heir that came of her / the same
opinion the earl of Foys laid to ye knights of his country when they went
in to Spain to aid the king of Castle / for he had been suffycyently
infourmed in the matter between Portyngale and Castle / wherefore he said to
the^ at their departing. Syrs ye have nothing to do to busy yourselfe between
Castle and Portyngale / for the queen of Castle who was daughter to king
Ferant of Portyngale / it is a war evil begone / there may much evil come
to them that be busye in that matter / but they answered him sith they had
received wages of such a man as the king of Castle was / they must needs go
and serve him / and so they went / and most part of them there dyed / as ye
have herd here before.

Now let us return to the busynes of Portyngale. For they be not for to be
left for the great adventures that there has fallen. And to cronycle al
things as they have fallen / to the entente that in time to come they should
be found / written / and regystred / if adventures were not known it were
great damage. And by clerks yt auncyently have written and regystred the
hystoryes and books / thereby ye hystories are known / there is not so
perpetual a memory as is writing / and truly I say to you and will that
they that come after me should know / that for to know the troth of this
hystory I have taken therein great pain in my days / and have serched many
royalmes and countries to know the truth / and have had acquayntau^ce of
many valiant me^ and have seen diverse both of France / of England / of
Scotland / Castle / Portyngale / and of other lands / Duchyes / and Countyes
/ such as they and their lands has been conjoined in these wars / and with
them I have spoken and ben instructed and infourmed / and I would not that any
enquest should pass unknown / sith I knew it to be true and notable. And
while I was in Byerne with ye earl Gaston of Foys / I was there enfourmed of
diverse busynesses / such as fell between Castle and Portyngale / and when I
was returned again in to my country in the countye of Heynalte / and in the
town of Valencennes / and that I had refresshed me there a season / then I
determined me to follow the hystory yt I had begone / then I aduysed in mine
ymagynacyon / how I could not suffycyently be instructed by the herynge of
them that sustained the opinion of the king of Castle / but that in likewise
I ought to here the Portyngales as well as the Gascoynes and Spanyardes that I
herd in the house of the earl of Foys / and in the way going thither and
retournynge / I took no regard to the pain or travail of my body / but so I
went to Bruges in Flaundres to find there some of yt royalme of Portyngale
and of Lyxbone / for there were ever some of y^ country / behold if mine
adventure were good or no if I had sought a season.vii. year I could not have
come to a better point then I did then / for then it was showed me that if I
would go to Meldeboure in Selande I should find there a knight of Portyngale /
a valiant man and a sage / and of the king of Portyngales counsel / who was
newly come thither / and was going thens by see in to Pruce / and how he
could justly and plainly show me of the busynes and adventures of Portyngale
/ for he knew and had been over all the country. These tidings reioysynge me
and so I went fro Bruges with one of Portyngale in my company / who knew
right well this knight / and so we came to Sluse and there took the sea / and
did so much by the grace of god that we came to meldeboure / and the
Portyngales that were in my company aquaynted me with this knight / and I
found him right gracyous / sage / honorable / courtoys / amyable / and
acquayntable / and so I was with him.vi. days or there about. And this knight
enfourmed me of all ye busynes between the royalme of Castle and Portyngale
sith the death of king Ferant till the departing of that knight out of that
country / he showed me every thing so plainly and so gracyously that I took
great pleasure to here him / and to write it. And when I was enfourmed by him
of all that I desired to know / I took leave of him / and he conveyed me to my
ship / and so did diverse other rich merchauntes of his country / who were
come fro Bruges / and fro other places to se him / and in his company there was
the sone of Navarre in Portyngale / and diverse other knights and squyers of
that royalme / but he had the chief honor among them / and certainly by that
I could se and ymagyne of him and of his estate he was worthy to have honor /
for he was of noble port / and goodly stature / and lykely to be a valiant
man. And when I return again fro Rome in to mine own country I shall busy
me to make relacyon of the words of this gentle knight called sir John^
Ferant Porteler / and shall cronycle all that has fallen in Portyngale and in
Castle unto the year of our lord.M.CCC.lxxx. and x.

How they of Portyngale sent out messageres in to England to show tidings
of their country to the king of England and to the great lords there. Ca.
xliii.
How shows the hystory yt after this master Denis king John^ of Portyngale
had dyscomfyted king John^ of Castle at yt battle of Iuberoth nere to ye
abbaye called ye Cabbase where as so many noble knights and squyers of France
/ Gascoyne / and Byerne were slain / and that the king of Portyngale for that
fair and vyctoryous journey was gretely doubted and honored of the
Portyngales / and was received after his vyctory in to Lyxbone with great glory
of all the people / and there with great tryumphe was crowned with laurel / as
auncyently kings were wont to be crowned / after they had dyscomfyted any
king in battle and there in Lyxbone was great feast or the departure of such
knights and squyers as were there / and the counsayles of the good towns and
cytees of yt royalme. Then there was a parlyament and a counsel holden / how
they might perceyuer in their opinyon on honorably / for certain of the sages
of the royalme said how it was necessary for them to se how they might
fortefye themself against ye king of Castle and his puyssaunce / so yt they
might honorably abide in their victory / and multiply and exalte in this
parlyament at Lyxbone holde^ in the cathedral church of saint Dominicke.
There were many deuyses recyted which need not to be rehearsed / but the rest
and conclusyon of this parlyament was that they should send in to England to
the duke of Lancastre who claymed of right the enherytau^ce of Castle / by
reason of yt lady Constaunce his wife eldest daughter to king Don Peter of
Castle / and to write to him that if ever he would claim any right in the
royalme of Castle / and to set forward his busynes / which long has hanged
in balaunce / and in adventure to be lost / yt would come in to Portyngale with
a company of men of arms and archers / for as then it was time conuenyent for
him so to do Then the earl of Navarre constable of Portyngale in fair language
said. Sith we be agreed to send in to England to the duke of Lancastre by
whom we think to be aided / which is the most profytablest way for us / to
cause our enemies to fear us / therefore let us advise in our royalme sage
personages and notable to do this message / and to enfourme so ye duke of
Lancastre and his counsel to come in to this country so strong as to resyst
our enemies with such aid as he shall have of us / for we may well suppose
that the king of Castle will get great aid of the Frensshe king. The
Frensshe men of war wot not where better to enploy their season / for they
have peace with England unto the feast of saint John^. And also the Frensshe men
have ferme peace with yt Flemynges / who has occupied them before diverse years.
The earl of Nauerres words were well accepted / and every man said how he
spoke well to the point / and yt so they would do. Then there were named by
sad dely beracyon of counsel that the great master of saint Jacques in
Portyngale and Laurence Fongasse a right sage and dyscrete squire who could
right well speak ye language of France / how they should goo on this message
in to England / for they could send none of the counsel of Portyngale that
better could do that message then they. Then there were letters written in
good Frensshe and in Latin to the king of England / to yt duke of Lancastre /
and to his brethren ye earl of Cambrydge and Bokyngham. And when these letters
were written and grosed up in Frensshe and in Latin / then they were read
before yt king and his counsel there / and well lyked / and so sealed and
delivered to the great master of saint Jacques / and to Laurence Fongase / who
took on the^ ye charge to bear them in to England / so they might pass the
daungere of the sea / and encou^teryng of any enemies and robbers of ye see /
for as well there were robbers on ye see as on ye land So they took a ship
called ye Lyn which would sail with all manner of wyndes more surelyer then
any other ship. So on a day they took their leave of the king and of the
archebysshop of Connymbres / and of the great counsel of Portyngale / and
went to the sea / and sailed toward England / and were.iii. days on ye see
without sight of land / and on the fourth day they saw Cornwall.

THey sped so well by their iourneys / and by the aid of god and good wind yt
they costed Cornewell and yt bounds of England / and so aryued saufely
without peril in the haven of Hampton / and there cast ancre and so issued out
of their ship / and went and refresshed them in yt town / and there they
were examyned by the baylyffe of Hampton and such other as were kepers of y^
cost of what country they were / and fro whens they came / and whyther they
would / they answered to all their demaundes / and said how they were of the
royalme of Portyngale / and sent thither fro their king and his counsel /
then they were welcome and had good chere / and when they had refresshed them
there and provided for horses for them / and for their servants. Then they
rode to London by guydes / for they knew not the country / and so were lodged
at the sign of the Fawcon / and sent back again their horses / and it
fortuned so well for them that ye king and his uncles were at Westmynstre /
whereof they were joyful / they came to London in the fore noone / and so dyned
/ and after dinner they took their letters and went to the duke of Lancastre
and to the duches. And when yt duke and the duches knew of their coming they
were right joyful / for they desired to here tidings fro Portyngale / there
had been showed the^ diverse tidings / but gretely they did nor believe it /
because they had no letters thereof out of y^ country. Then ye great master of
saint Jacques and Laurence Fongase entered in to the dukes chamber / and the
duches there present / and because yt Laurence Fongase could speak frensshe he
spoke first / and when he had made his reverence to the duke and to the duches
/ and delivered them letters fro Portyngale / ye duke took his / and the duches
hers / and so red their letters / and then the duke said to the messageres Syrs
ye be right welcome into this country and to morrow ye shall go to the king /
and we shall do you the aid we can / as it is reason. Then the duches drew
Laurence Fongase a part and demanded of him tidings out of Castle and
Portyngale / to every thing this Laurence answered. Then yt duke called for
wine and spyce / and so they drank / and took their leave and returned to
their lodging / and in ye morning they went again to ye duke / who had herd
mass / and so then they entered in to a barge and went by water to Westmynstre
/ where ye king and the most part of his counsel was. The duke entered in
to the counsel chamber and said to the king. Sir here is ye great master of
saint Jacques in Portyngale who has brought you letters fro ye king / will it
please you to se them / with a good will said ye king Then the.ii. messagers
kneled down before the king / and Laurence Fongase delivered his letters /
the king took them / and caused them to be read / also they delivered letters
to the earl of Cambrydge / and to the earl of Bokyngha^ each of them read
their letters. The king answered ye messageres right swetely and said.

Syrs ye are welcome in to this country / your coming does us great joy /
and ye shall not depart without answer such as shall please you and all your
busynes / let mine uncles here have them in remembrance / so they thanked the
king and departed out of y^ counsel chamber / and went down in to the
palace abiding for the duke of Lancastre who tarried till it was high noone.
Then the duke of Lancastre took his two brethren with him to dinner / and went
by water / and these messageres with the^. The earl of Cambrydge knew right
well the great master of saint James and Laurence of Fougase / for he had seen
them before in Portyngale / wherefore after dinner he comoned with the^ of diverse
things in the presence of his other two brethren and demanded them of the
marriage of Castle / and of her that should have been his daughter in law the
lady Beautyce. To all his demaundes the ambassadors answered wisely and truly
/ whereby the lords were right well content and pleased.

True it was that before these ambassadors were comen into England the duke
of Lancastre / and the earl of Cambrydge his brother had diverse counsayles
together for the right they claymed by their wystes. The Earl of Cambrydge as ye
have herd before / was not well content with king Ferant of Portyngale nor
with the men of war there / for they had lodged.xv. days in the feldes
before ye Castellyans / and yet king Ferant nor the Portyngales would never
fight with the^ yet the earl the same time showed ye king his defaulte and
said / sir I have here in my company of poor English me^ a.C. speres and
a.M. archers. And al we are wyllyng to fight with our enemies / and to abide
the adventure that god will send us / but king Ferant answered ever that he
was not counsayled to fight / wherefore when the Earl saw that he departed thens
/ and took with him again his sone out of Portyngale / and when he was
departed / then the king of Portyngale accorded with king John^ of Castle /
and married his daughter to him to make the peace / and this treatye was made by
sir John^ Audre a knight of portyngale. The king there had all his trust in
him. The king of Portyngale demanded of his daughter whether she had rather
have the king of Castle / or the earl of Cambrydge sone. She answered and said
how she loved better John^ of England then John^ of Castle The king
demanded why she said so / she answered / because John^ of England was a
goodly personage and of her age / and that was the cause she would not have the
king of Castle / howbeit her fader to have peace with the Spanyardes made that
marriage. Also the earl had said to the duke of Lancastre his brother that king
Ferant ones deed / he doubted that the commons of the royalme of Portyngale
would rebel against the lady Beautryce / for the most part of the royalme
(For all yt their king had married her mother the lady Elyanoure of Coygne.) yet
they held not the kings daughter to be borne in lawful marriage but reputed
her as a bastard / and mermured thereon while the earl was there. Wherefore he
was the gladder to take away his sone thens. The duke of Lancastre to whom y^
matter touched nerer then to the earl of Cambrydge because he had married the
eldest sister heir to Castle / and he had a fair child by the lady
Constaunce his wife / wherefore he ever desired to be truly and justly
enfourmed of yt busynes in those parties / and did set his mind how he might
exalte and further his title / and he saw clearly that as then he could not
have so good an enter in to Castle as by the royalme of Portyngale / specially
seeing how he was desired and required of the king of Portyngale / and of the
barons and commons of the royalme / and also considering how the king of
Portyngale that was then was a noble sage prince and valiant / seeing how he
had dyscomfyted the king of Castle in plain battle and all his puyssaunce /
Whereby the duke ye sooner enclyned to go in to Portyngale. And also the king of
England and his counsel was agreed thereto / but to the entente to be justly
enfourmed of all the busynes / state / and condycyon of the country of Castle
/ and of the right that the lady Beautryce claymed to the crown of Portyngale
/ and also of the right of king John^ of Portyngale whom the commons had
crowned to their king. For this entente on a day the duke made a dinner to
these ambassadors of Portyngale in his own lodging / and after dinner he made
every man to depart / and called these ambassadors to him right amorously /
and demanded of them of the busynes of Portyngale / and because that Laurence
Fougase could speak / Frensshe the duke addressed his words unto him and
said. Laurence I require you to show me from point to point the conducyon and
manner of your land of Portyngale / and what has fallen there / and in Castle
sith my brother the earl of Cambrydge was there / for the king of Portyngale
has written to me that there is no man in Portyngale yt can inform me more
justly then ye can do / and in this ye shall do me a great pleasure / sir said
y^ squire I shall fulfill your pleasure / and then began to speak and said in
this manner.

Syrsyth the departure of your brother the earl of Cambrydge out of Portyngale
there has fallen great trouble and dyscencyo^ in the royalme / and in great
adventure to have been lost / but thanked be god the busynesses there / are as
now in good point and fermely stablysshed / but and god had not wrought by
his grace the matter had gone evil / and all thrughe the defaulte of king
Ferrant last dysseased. This is the oppynyon of the most part of the royalme
/ for king Ferrant in his days loved sore a lady wife to a knight of his
called sir John^ Laurence of Coygne / and because of her beautye he would have
her by force. The lady withstode the kings desire as long as she might / but
at the last he had her and said. Dame I shall make you queen of Portyngale /
for though I love you / it is not for your hurt / but to exalte you / for I
will mary you. Then the lady on her knees weeping said / sir saving your
dyspleasure. I can have none honor to be queen of Portyngale for you know and
so does all the world that I have an husband all ready / and have had
this.v. year / Elyanoure said the king make none escuse / for I will have none
other wife but you / but I shall quyte you from your husband or I mary you.
The lady could get none other words of the king / and she showed all the
matter to her husband / and when yt knight knew thereof / he was sorry and
maleneolyous / and regarded and studied what were best for him to do / and said
to himself / I will not thus leave my wife / howbeit he doubted the king / and
went out of the royalme of Portyngale / into Castle to king Henry who
received him / and retained him to be of his house as long as he lived / and
so does king John^ that now is. Thus the king of Portyngale to
accomplysshe his folysshe pleasure / sent for the knight and for the lady but
the knight was goone. Then the king sent for the bysshophe of Connymbres /
who was as then chauncelloure of Portyngale / and of the kings counsel / and
the king showed him his intent / how he would wedde Elyanoure of Coygne / and
the bishop fered the king because he knew him of an high and a fyerce
condycyon / therefore he durst not say contrary to the kings pleasure / and
also sir John^ Ferant Audere / who was chief of counsel with the king to
please the king aid to ye bishop. Sir ye may wed them well enough / ones ye
king shall make recompense for all / so ye bishop wedded them / and this lady
was crowned queen / and so reputed in all ye great Cytees in Portyngale / and
had as much honor and reverence as ever had any other queen in the royalme
of Portyngale / and the king had by her a daughter / who as now is queen of
Castle. True it was that while king Ferant lived / he sent on a day / to
Lyxbone for all the prelates and noble men of the country / and for the
counsayles of the Cytees / ports / and towns of Portyngale / and this was or
your brother the earl of Cambrydge came in to Portyngale / and there the king
made every man to swear and to promise that after his dyssease they should take
his daughter the lady Beautryce / Who was as then but five years of aege / for
herytoure of ye royalme of Portyngale every man swear whether they would or
not. Howbeit the most part of them yt were there knew right well that she
was but a bastard / and borne in aduoutrye / for her moders husband was still
living / called sir John^ Laurence of Coygne / who lived in Castle with the
king there as long as king Ferant of Portyngale lived / and longer / how
bert sir I think surely if the kings daughter had been a sone / that all the
comonaltye of Portyngale would sooner have agreed to him the^ to his daughter.
For to her they said they would never agree / but had rather dye then to be
under the subiectyon of the royalme of Castle. For as yet the royalme of
Portyngale and the royalme of Castle never loved parfytely together / But has
often times haryed / and made war each with other / In likewise as the
royalme of Scotland does with yt royalme of England.

THen the duke of Lancastre demanded of Laurence Fongase / where king John^
that now is brother to king Ferrant was in king Ferrantes days. Sir said the
squire he was in the royalme of Portyngale in a house of relygyon wherein be
knights of an order in white habytes with a reed cross and he was sovereign
of that house / and was called master Deuyce. The king set little by his
brother but made him ruler of that house of Denyce / nor also king John^ that
now is / meddled nothing with the busynes of the royalme / nor thought nothing
of the crown thereof. For if king Ferrant of Portyngale had thought any thing
of that is fallen sith he loved his lady Elyanoure and the lady Beautryce her
daughter / he would have slain his brother who is now king / but because he
saw that he kept his house with the brethren of his order so mekely and
duly he had no suspecte in him / but so let him live in peace. And sir as for
the dyssencyon that is now bytwe-Portyngale and Castle / surely sir to say
the truth therein / ye Spanyardes are cause there of / Why so said ye duke / I
shall show you said the squire. The Castellyans when they saw that king
Ferrant had married his daughter to their king / then they began to be proud /
and began to speak great words / which sore greueo the Portyngales / for the
Spanyardes would say. Oye Portyngales rude people like beestes / The time now
is come that we shall have a good market of you / for ye have been and shall be
ours / we shall deuyde and set you in companyes as we do the Iues who dwells
by truage under us / ye shall be our subjects with other venymous words /
often times they said thus when they met the Portyngales. And while king
Ferrant lived / and had married his daughter in to Castle / they engendered
such an hate that they murmured and said / it were better to be deed the^ to
be under the danger and subieccyon of ye Castellyans / and so king Ferrant
fell syke which endured a hole year. And when he was deed and buried in the
church of saint France a relygyous house of freers in the cite of Lyxbone
Then the cytees / good towns / and castelles in Portyngale closed their gates
/ and they sent for the king that now is to Lyxbone / who knew right well
the ententes of the.iii. other cytees / as Connymbres / Port / and Eure. Then
they said. Master Deuyce (so he was called as then) We will make you king of
this royalme though ye be a bastard / but we say that your cosyn the lady
Beautryce queen of Castle is borne rather a basterde than you for as yet
lives her moders first husband. / And sith it is so that the crown of
Portyngale is fallen in two ways / we will take for us the most profitable /
and also the most part of the royalme enclyneth to make you our king / and
that the crown of Portyngale shall not go to a woman / nor we will not be
under the subieccyon of the king of Castle / nor of the Castellyans / we had
rather ye should take all that we have / to aid and to maynteyne us and our
fraunches / the^ the Castellyans should be masters over us / wherefore sir
receive our gift / for we will it shall be thus / then this master Denyce who
is as now king would not receive their offer at the first nor second request
but answered and said. Good people I know well of good affection and entyer
love ye offer me the crown of Portyngale / which is a great thing / and
where as ye say that I have as great right or more to the crown as my co^yn
the queen of Castle. In likewise I think the same / for true it is she is a
basterde for as yet lives her moders husband and is in Castle / but there is
one point / ye all alone can not do this matter / it behooves that all the
nobles or great part of them agree thereto / the^ they of Lyxbone answered and
said / sir we have ynowe / We know all ready the courage of diverse / and also
the oppynyon of them of the.iii. chief cytees of this royalme beside us / as
Connymbres / Port / and Eure / then the king said / let it be as ye will I am
content / ye know well that this lady Elyanoure who is called queen of this
royalme is as yet here in this cite / and her counsaylloure with her sir John^
Ferrant Audere who will keep the crown of Portyngale and the heritage thereof
for ye queen of Castle / for he made first the marriage to make peace between
Castle and Portyngale and peradventure the king of Castle will send for him
hastily to help to subdue his rebels. Wherefore now at the obsequye of my
brother which shall be shortly / whereat most part of the nobles of this
royalme and Cytees will be / it were good to provide for remedy in that behalf
/ then they that were present said / sir that ye say is true we shall provide
therefore / as we shall here sir John^ Ferrant speak / and so as then their
counsel ended.

IT was not long after but that the obsequye was kept at Lyxbone in the
freers where as king Ferrant lies / and there were many of the nobles of
Portyngale / for they were desired so to be by ye queen and by sir John^
Ferrant Audere who governed the queen / and there was the king that now is
with a great nombre of the commons of the country / and specially of the three
cytees Connymbres / Eure / and ye port of Portyngale / for they all agreed and
consented to them of Lyxbone. And when the obyte was done sir John^ Ferrant
Audere desired in the queen's name the nobles that were there present that they
should not depart thens that day nor the next / saying how the queen would
have their counsayles what should be done to send in to Castle for king John^
and his wife the lady Beautryce their lady / who was herytoure by right to the
royalme of Portyngale / all the nobles or a great part of them that herd his
words made little there of / for they doubted sore the commons that were there
essembled / for they had herd diverse of them murmr saying how they would
crown to be their king master Denyce. Also sir John^ Ferrant Audere had
herd like words Therefore he desired the nobles of the royalme to abide there
with him to aid and sustain his opinion / but they failed him / for as soon as the kings obyte was done in the foresaid freers / and yt queen Elyanour was
returned to her lodgyng / then every man cried to horse and so al or the most
part mounted on their horses / and so departed fro Lyxbone / some tarried ftyll
such as were on the kings party yt now is / and they went to their
lodgings / and kept themself pryuely and dyssymuled the matter / for they
well ymagyned the matter to fall as it fell / as I shall show you how. when
the kings obyte was done the commons of Lyxbone and of the other three cytees
such as were there returned not shortly to their lodgings but went to the
cathedral church of Lyxbone called saint Domynycke / and there they assembled
and master Denyce with them / there they had great counsel together Which
counsel endured not long. For the king that now is said unto them. All ye
good people I understand ye would make me your king. And surely I say it is
my right. And if ye will perceyuer in that purpose it is time to set a work
/ and to show your deed and ^uyssaunce / for ye know right well that sir
John^ Ferrant Audere does procure the nobles of the royalme to send for ye
king of Castle / and he says and maynteyneth that the crown of Portyngale
perteyneth to the king of Castle by the right of my cosyne his wife / and I
say if ye will aid me it is my right rather then hers / ye know all the
manner / for I am a man / and brother to king Ferra^t and sone to good king
Peter of Portyngale who governed you valyauntly. True it is my cosyne the queen
of Castle was daughter to king Ferrant / but that was not by lawful marriage.
Then they of Lyxbone said unto him. Sir all this is true / we will have none
other king but you / and we will make you our king / look thereon who will /
but ye shall swear unto us that ye shall be good to us and keep Justice / and
ye shall not flatter no more with the great lords then with the small people /
and ye shall keep and sustain with good heart with the aid that we shall give
you / all the right perteynynge to Portyngale. Then the king answered and
said. Syrs all this I swear / but pryncypally I require you to go with me to ye
lodging called ye Monnoy where sir John^ Ferrant Audere is with Elyanoure of
Coygne / for I will that he be slain for he has deserved it against me / and
against you when he susteyneth and maynteyneth other quarelles against your
wylles / t^enne they all with one voice answered. We will that this be done /
for surely he is disobeysaunt and a rebel against you / Wherefore let him be
put to death / and all the other that be rebellyons against you Whereby other of
the royalme shall take ensample. Then they departed together from the mynstre of
saint Domynycke to the nombre of.xv.C. all of one oppynyon / and the king that
now is with them / and so they went thrughe the town to the lodging called
the Monnoy where the queen and sir John^ Ferrant Audere were. And when they
came there / they brake up the gates of the lodging and entered therein perforce
and they went in to the chamber where as the queen was / Who was right sore
afraid when she saw so much people coming upon her / then incontinent she
fell down on her knees before this master Denyce / and prayed him to have
pity and compassyon upon her / saying unto him that she knew nothing of any
dyspleasure that she had done against him or against any other. And also she
said unto him how that as touching the crown and heritage of Portyngale she
claymed no part But master Denyce I require you and all the people here
present to consydre how king Ferrant made me queen against my will / then this
master Denyce said. Fair lady doubt ye nothing / for ye shall have no hurt
/ for we be not come therefore / but for this traytoure / John^ Ferrant Audere /
he shall dye to begin withal / and then let the king of Castle revenge his
death if he can / he has been to long his proctoure in this country / with
that word auaunced forth such as was ordained there to / who took the knight
and put him to death and more hurt they did not to no person / but so
returned to their lodging / and the king yt now is went to his.

ANd after the death of John^ Ferrant / the lady Elyanoure who had been queen of
Portyngale / took counsel and determined herself to go out of Portyngale in
to Castle to the king there / and to the queen her daughter / for she was in
such fray by the death of her knight sir John^ Ferrant Audere that she thought
no longer to abide in Portyngale / for she saw she could have there no there
honor nor rest / then she caused master Denyce now king to be desired to
suffer her to depart / and he lightly agreed thereto / and said how that it
pleased him well yt she should peparte / for he said she had good cause so to
do. The lady departed fro Lyxbone with all her company / and she rode so long
by her iourneys that she came to Syuyll where the king of Castle and the
queen lay / and the same season that this lady came thither / there were
assembled nere all the nobles of Castle / for there they had a great counsel
on the busynes for Portyngale / for king John^ there took counsel how he
might do / scynge the royalme of Portyngale was fallen to him by succession /
by the death of king Ferrant / fader to the queen his wife / Who agreed or he
dyed that it should so be / and all the country in like wise. This lady
Elyanoure was received with the king and with the queen her daughter right
honorably as it was reason Then she was examyned of all the busynes in
Portyngale / and she showed them the truth of that she had seen and known
/ and also she said how that it well appeared that by all lykelyhede the commons
of Portyngale would crown to their king master Denyce / with out the king
of Castle there against made resystence and defense / and for that cause they
had slain her knight sir Ihon^ Ferrant of Audere because he sustained / and
always he had done the king of Castelles quarrel / and in all that this lady
said she was well byleued for they saw it well apparent. And also certain
barons and knights of the royalme of Portyngale such as had better
affection to the king of Castle / then to she king that now is / because
of king Ferrantes daughter / and for to accomplysshe and fulfill their oaths
that they had made to the king of Castle / at the desire of their king John^
Ferrant when he gave his daughter in marriage to the king of Castle / therefore
to acquyte their promise they departed out of the royalme of Portyngale and
went in to Castle / and left their own lands and herytages on the
adventure to recover them again / as the earl Alphons Seroll / ye great pryour
of saint Ihn^s in Portyngale / sir Delagare his brother Ange Syluaste of Geneull
/ John^ Aussall and diverse other to the nombre of.xxv. Whereby ye royalme of
Portyngale was sore febled / and the royalme of Castle enforced. Then the
king of Castle made his somons thrughe out all his royalme that all noble men
/ and all other able to bear armure between.xv. and.xl. should in all have come
to him in to the field of Sebyll / for he said he would with puyssaunce enter
in to the royalme of Portyngale / and conquer it as his own heritage / at his
commandment every man obeyed as it was reason / for such as held of him /
and so they came to the field of Sebyll / and there assembled to the nombre
of.lx.M. men of one and other.

ANd when sir Laurence of Coygne husband to the lady Elyanoure whom king
Ferrant of Portyngale took to his wife and was queen of Portyngale understood
that she was come out of Portyngale in to Castle. Then he went to certain of
the king of Castelles counsel / and said to them as in demanding of them
counsel. My lords and my great friends how shall I do with Elyamoure my wife
who is come out of Portyngale in to this country / I know right well king
Ferrant took her by force against her will / and now king Ferrant is deed /
and ye know well by reason I ought to have my wife again / what counsel
will ye give me therein / and such as he spoke unto gave him counsel and
said. John^ we counsel you to make no sc^^blaunt thereof / nor demand her
not again / nor take her not / for if ye do ye shall gretely abate the honor
of the lady and also blemyssheth the honor of the queen of Castle her
daughter / for then ye should make her worse then a basterde / ye se how ye
king of Castle will demand and think to conquer the royalme of Portyngale
as his own ryghtfull heritage by the right of his wife. Thus ye shode open
clearly which is now somewhat in doubt and trouble / and without ye take good
head it will cost you your life if ye make ye queen of Castle a bastard / for
they of this country sustain her quarrel / and say that she was borne in just
marriage by dyspensacyon of the pope. Well said the knight / then what is it
best for me to do / we shall show you said they / the best that we think is
yt as soon as ye can get you out of Castle and go again to your enherytaunce
in to Portyngale / and leave the lady Elyanoure here with her daughter / we se
none other saufegarde for you but this / by my faith said ye knight I believe
you well for ye counsel me truly and like good friends. So this sir John^
Laurence of Coygne tarried not long after in Castle / but departed and went
to Lyxbone / and there he found master Denyce now king and said how he was
come to serve him / and would be under his obeysaunce / for he would take him
for his king. Master Denyce had great joy and said how he was welcome to
him / and so gave him again all his heritage and made him capytayne of
Lyxbone. Thus sir as I have showed you fell the busynes between Portyngale and
Castle.

How Laurence Fongase ambassadoure fro the king of Portyngale in to England
/ showed to the duke of Lancastre the manner of the dyscorde that was between
the royalmes of Castle and Portyngale. Ca. xliiii.
THe duke of Lancastre took great pleasure to (...) Laurence Fongase spe^^ he
spoke so attemperaci^^ ^o good Frensshe / and (...) because the matter touch^^
him nere and to the en^e^^ that he would come to the botom of his desy^^ he
said Laurence speak on hardely / I (...) hard no stranger speak this two year
tha^ had rather here speak then you / for ye go to^ truth of the matter. Also
the letters that (...) have brought to me fro the king of Portyngale /
testefyeth how there is nothing th^^ has been done between Portyngale and
Castle / but that ye can justly inform me ther^* Sir said the squire little
thing has the^^ ben done as in deeds of arms / but that I have been at them /
wherefore I can well speak of them / and sith it is your pleasure and volante yt
I shall pursewe my words I shall show you every thing as I know. Thus as I
showed you before king John^ of Castle ass^bled his people as soon as he
might / and so came with a great puysaunce and strength toward Lyxbone or the
king of Portyngale that now is was crowned to put the Portyngales in fear /
and to show how he had right to the heritage of Portyngale. And so first he
came before saint yrayne which was the enter of Portyngale / and there he
rested two days / they of the town with the governors thereof were in great
fear with his coming / because of ye great nombre of men of war yt were
with him / and so they yielded up their town to him. And after he had taken
their possessyon / and left men of arms to keep the town for fear of
rebellyon. Then he departed with all his oost / and so went till he came
before the town of Tuy which was right strong / there he laid his syege /
and a great part of them of Tuy held with the queen of Castle / For the lady
Elyanoure had it lymytted to her for her dowry / Wherefore lyghtely they yielded
them to the king of Castle / and became his subjects / and was under his
obeysaunce. And when the king of Castle had taken possessyon there / he
left men of arms to keep it. And when he had so done / he passed the river
and went to the town of Valencennes in Portyngale / and thereto laid his
syege / and he sent his messagere unto them that were whithin / that they
should yield them and their town unto him. And they of Valence answered and
said / let the king of Castle pass forth and go to Lixbone / and as soon as
they might know that he has won that cite outher by love / fear / or
perforce / that then incontynente they would deliver up the keys of their
town to him This answer pleased right well the king of Castle / and so
departed fro Valence / In likewise did they of another cite called Serpe which
was strong and fair / the king thought to have gone thither / but when he
knew their composycyon / he was content and came not there / but so took the
way to Lyxbone / for he knew if he might subdue that cite he should have all
the resydue of the country at his case / and where soever he went he had with
him the queen his wife to show thereby to ye Portyngales that the right was his
and that by good and just cause he would conquer his wy^^es heritage.

THus king John^ of Castle came with all his oost before Lyxbone / and there
laid a great syege / and showed well by his syege that he would not depart
thens till he had ye cite at his pleasure / and greatly thretened master Denyce
/ who was within ye cite and said how that if he might get him / he should
dye an evil death / and all the rebels with him. The king of Castelles oost
was great for he had much people / for the Spanyardes and Frensshe men that
were there closed so ye Cite about that none could issue out nor enter with out
he were taken or slain / and sometime it fell by skyrmysshes and otherwise that
the Spanyardes took some Portyngales / then ye Spanyardes would put out their
eyes / or stryke of a foot or an arm or some other membre / and so sent them
in again in to the cite commau^dynge them to say that they did / they did in
dyspyte of ye Lyxbonoys and of their master Denyce whom they would make their
king and also show them plainly that we shall hold this syege here so long
that we shall have them perforce / by famyne or otherwise / and then they shall
all dye an evil death / and set fire on the cite without mercy or pyre. And
when the Lyxbonoys took any of them they did not so / for the king that now
is of Portyngale made them to be well kept at their ease / and so sent them
again in to the oost without any hurt or damage of their persons / wherefore
some said in ye oost that it was done of a great gentylnes / for he rendered
good for evil. And sir while this syege endured which was an hole year and
more / every weke there was one or two skyrmysshes and deeds of arms done /
and some hurt and slain on the one part or on the other. The king of
Castle held as well his syege by water as by land and had plente of
vytaylles / for it came to his oost from all parties out of Castle / and on a
day it happened at a skyrmysshe that was made at one of ye gates / sir John^
Laurence of coygne who was capytayne of the Cite issued out of the barryers
with his penon of the arms of Coygne before him / and with him a good nombre
of propre men of war / and at that skirmysshe there was done many a propre
feate of arms / and many a darte cast. By my faith said the duke of Lancastre
of all the feats of arms that the Castellyans and they of your country does
use / the casting of their darts best pleases me / and gladly I would se it
/ for as I here say if they stryke one aryght / without he be well armed the
darte will perce him thrughe / by my faith sir said the squire ye say truth
/ for I have seen many a great stroke given with them / which at one time cost
us derely and was to us great dyspleasure / for at ye said skyrmysshe sir John^
Laurence of Coygne was stryken with a darte in such wise that the heed perced
all the plates of his cote of mayle and a jack stopped with sylke and passed
thrughe his body / so that he fell down deed / and therewith seized the
skyrmysshe because of ye death of yt knight and so was the lady Elyanoure a
wydowe in one year of both her husbands.

FOr this sir Johan Laurence of Cygne was made great moan / for he was a
valyau^t knight and full of good counsel / and after his death there was
chosen to be capytayne of Lyxbone a cosyne of his a right valiant man called
pouuasse of Coin / he made against ye Spanyardes three or four yssues / and
did to them great damage. Thus continued the syege at Lyxbone / and surely
often times they within the town were sore abashed / for they could se no
comfort come to them from any part / and when they saw that none came out
of England whereon lay all their trust. The^ the king that now is was
counsayled to have taken a ship / and so to have come hyder in to England /
for sir John^ Vadigothz of pass sir John^ Cete Door / and the archedeacon of
Lyxbone whom they had sent hither in to England to the king here and to you /
and to the earl of Cambrydge your brother for to have some comfort and aid /
when they returned in to Lyxbone they brought tidings how yt ye would have
comforted them / in the name of god said the duke / all that is of truth /
and so had I done and was ready and at ye point to have departed / but as then
the war of Flaundres and of Gaunte did let me / for the Gauntoys came hyder
for aid and help / and so all such or the most part of them that should
have gone with me in to Portyngale went in to Flaundres with ye bishop of
Norwyche sir Henry percy and so that let my journey in to Portyngale / in
the name of god said ye squire / it was thought among us that there was some
great let in England so yt you could not come hyder / howbeit we did as well
as we might / and maynteyned ourselfe valyauntly against the king of Castle
and all his puyssaunce / which was no small thing / for he had mo then.lx.M.
me^ by see and by land / and thretened to byrne / and to exyle us without
mercy. And sir thus while this syege endured an earl of our country of
Portyngale called the earl of Angouse did us on a day great socour / whereby he
attained great honor / for he with.xx. Galeys aryued at the port of
Portyngale with a good nombre of men of arms and prouysyon / and so came
saylynge by ye see before Valence / and thrughe ye grace of god he came by ye
king of Castelles army as they lay at ancre before Lixbone who were mo then
a.C. great vessels / howbeit he did his entrepryse so gracyously / and had
the wind at so good a point / that in dyspyte of all his enemies / he entered
saufely without peril with all his galeys in to the haven of Lyxbone / and at
his coming in conquered.iiii. ships of his enemies / and brought them with
him in to ye haven / of whose coming all that were in Lyxbone were right
joyous / for it comforted them gretely. By my faith said the duke of Lancastre
the earl of Angouse at yt time did you a fair service. But now fair Laurence
show me how was this syege raised / and by what manner / I would gladly here
you speak thereof / sir said the squire I shall show you with right a good will.

AS I have showed you the syege endured more then a year before Lyxbone / and
the king of Castle had sworn and auowed that he would not depart from the
syege till he had the cite under his obeysaunce / without the puyssaunce of a
gretter king then he was raised him therfro by force. And truly al things
considered the king of Castle kept well his auowe / for ye puyssaunce of a
gretter king then he was raised him / and caused him to depart / I shall show
you how / a pestylence and mortalyte meruaylous ferefull fell in his oost in
such wise that me^ dyed suddenly / spekyng one to another / there dyed mo
then.xx.M. persons / whereof ye king was sore afraid / wherefore it was
counsayled him to depart thens / and to draw to saint yrayne / or to some
other part / and break up the syege / and to give leave to his people to
depart till the pestylence were seized / which he did sore against his will /
because he had sworn so solemply to keep ye syege / howbeit of necessyte he
was feign to depart. Therefore sir we say / and has been said in Portyngale /
and it is the common opinion / that god did send that pestylence in to the king
of Castelles oost to aid us and our king that now is / for in the cite
wherein we were closed / there dyed another man nor woman of y^ sykenes / this
grace god did for us. And when the king of Castle dyslodged fro Lyxbone / the
king of Portyngale that now is caused all such as were within the cite to be
armed / and to lepe on their horses / and to follow the train of the king of
Castelles oost and there we did then great damage / for they dyslodged not in
good array / whereby they ^ost part of their men and promocyon / but the king of
Portyngale made a cry / that on pain of death no ma to take any thing yt
they found in the field / nor to bring any thing thereof in to the cite / but
commanded every thing to be burnt to the intent that it should bring no
infeccyon in to the cite. So prouysyon and every thing was converted in to
flame of fire / howbeit I think such as found other gold or silver in money
or place brent it not / but saved it as well as they might. So thus the king of
castle went to saint prayne at ye enter of his country / and there tarried a
season / and sent for more socour in to France / and specially in to Gascoyne
and Byerne / and in to ye lands of ye earl of Foys / and he sent thither.iii.
summers laden with nobles of castle and floreyns to give in pressed to knights and
squyers / for he knew well otherwise he should not have them come out of their
houses. And when the barons and knights of ye royalme of Portyngale on ye
party of ye king that now is saw how the king of Castle had raised his
syege / which had endured more then a year / they took then great courage /
and so did all the commons of the country / and specially they of Port Ewre /
and Connymbres Then they took counsel together shortly to crown to their
king master Denyce whom they had chosen and given him their love / and said
how that it was gods will yt he should be their king / for he had showed his
virtue against the Spanyardes / then a commandment was made thrughout all
Portyngale every man to come to Co^mmbres at a certain day lymytted to the
Coronacyon of master Denyce / all such as took his part came thither / and
according to the puyssaunce of that royalme there was much people / there
king John^ of Portyngale was crowned by the bysshoppes and prelates of the
royalme with great solempnyte as it aperteyned / on trynyte ^ondaye the year of
our lord god.M.CCC.lxxx. and.iiii. In the cathedral church of Co^nymbres
called saint Mary's / which day ye king made new knights / what of his own
country as of strangers to ye nombre of.lx. There was kept a great feast.ii.
or.iii. days and there the king renewed all homages of Earls / barons /
knights / and squyers / and such as held of him / and there the king swear
to keep the royalme in right and Justice / and to maynteyne al their
iurysdyccyons / and every man swear to take him for their king and his heirs
coming of him / male / or female that to dye in the pain never to forsake
them thus king John^ of Portyngale was crowned king.

WHen the king of Castle knew how the commons of Portyngale had crowned
master Denyce to their king / and had sworn to him faith and homage / then
he was more dyspleased then he was before / for he had thought they would not
have done it so suddenly because he had many of the nobles of Portyngale with
him / then he said. I se well it behooves me perforce to conquer yt is mine if
I will have it / there shall never be peace between Castle and Portyngale till
ye Portyngales have amended yt they have done And so after the king was
crowned he came to Lyxbone / and there tarried and took great dylygence to set
in a good way ye busynes of his royalme / and to get thereby the grace / good
will and love of his people / and sent his knights and men of war in to
diverse garysons / in to towns and castelles on the fronters of Spain / for ye
king of Castle lay at Sybyll. The king of Portyngale sent in garyson to
Trentouse sir John^ Ferant Perteler / an expert man of arms / a valiant
knight and of high entrepryse / and with him sir Martyn Vas of Coygne / and
his brother sir Wyllya^ Vas two expert knights / and they had under them.CC.
speres of good men of war well horsed / and to ye castle of Lene toward
Iuberoth was sent sir John^ Radygos with a.l. speres / and to ye cite of
Valence in Portyngale was sent sir John^ James of Saulles / to lie in garyson
against the strong town of Tuy / which was as then yelden to ye king of
Castle when he came toward Lyxbone / and in Tuy there lay in a garyson a
great nombre of men of arms Frensshe and Castellyans / and to ye cite of Serpe
was sent sir Nondech Radygo a noble knight with.l. speres / but to Port / to
Ewre / and to Connymbres was sent no men of war / for the king thought them
strong enough of themself / and true and faithful to him. Thus sir in the
same year yt the king was thus crowned / the garysons were well provided for /
and often times there were encountrynges / skyrmysshes / and assawtes on both
parties / one time our men wanne / and another time they lost as the adventure
of arms falls / but specially there was before encountre by them of the
garyson of Treucouse against the Castellyans. A Laurence said ye duke of
Lanclastre pass not the matter so breuely / but let me know how it was and
what was done when they met in the feldes / for I would gladly here spekyng
of deeds of arms Sir said the squire I shall show you what was there done /
for at the same renconntre I was present and bare yt day ye baner of sir John
Ferant Perteler by whom the busynes began for he was as then capytayne of
Treutouse.

THe king of Castle had provided me^ of war on ye fronters of Portyngale
who sometime do to us damage assembled the^ self together and took ye feldes /
and sometime lost and sometime wanne. And so on a season a vii. capytaynes of
Spanyardes good knights and of high lygnage assembled them together with the
nombre of.iii.C. speres well horsed having great desire to do us damage as
they well showed / for they came and entered in to Portyngale and took a great
pray and many prisoners / and if they had would they might have entered again
in to Castle with out any encountrynge / but they were so high minded and
proud that they said they would goo and se the garyson of Treutouse / they of
ye plain country fled before them / so that tidings of them came in to
Treutouse / and when sir John^ Ferrant Partelere knew the Castellyans rode
abroad / he called for his harneys / and caused the trompettes to besowned /
and so awoke all the knights and squyres in the town / every man armed him in
great haste / and mounted on their horses / and issued out of Treutouse / and
when they were in ye feldes they were a.CC. and so put themself in good order
/ and showed how they had great affection to find their enemies / and
demanded of them that came flyenge in to ye town where their enemies were /
and they answered and said how they were not far thens / and how they rode
but a soft pace because of the great pray that they carried with them / With
those tidings sir John^ Ferrant Partelere was right joyous and said to his
company / as to sir John^ Martyne of Vas / and sir Wyllyam Vas his brother. Syrs
I require you let us auaunce forward I will not enter in to any town or
Castle in Portyngale till I have seen our enemies / and fight with them / and
put to my pain and travail to recover the pray and prisoners that they leede
with them / and then he said to me. Laurence dysplay my baner / for it is time
/ we shall find shortly our enemies / then I did as he commanded me / and so
we rode forth a good pace / and at the last we saw where the dust rose with
the horses of our enemies / then we took the vauntage of the sone and came on
them / and when ye Castellyans saw us they held themself close together / and
ordered themself / and set their prisoners and pray on their one side and we
approached so nere together that we might speak to them / and they to us / and
then we saw how they had.iii. baners / and.iiii. penons / and to our
Judgment a.CCC. horse. First there was sir John^ Radigos de Castenans knight
and baron in Castle / sir Sylue grefye of Albenes / sir Adioutall of Tolet of
Cassell / sir John^ Radigo of Eure / and Diostenses of Angouse / and when we
were before the^ we lyghted on foot / and in likewise so did they / and
delivered their horses to pages and varlettes / and or we began to cast darces
or to do any feate of arms the capytaynes spoke each to other / I that was
there present herd all the words that were spoken on both parties / for my
master sir John^ Ferrant Partelere whose baner I bare was one of ye formest
and ye words that were spoken were by him and to him. First he demanded why
they rode in Portyngale ledynge away such prays and prisoners as they had
taken / then sir Adioutall of Tolet answered and said they would ride as they
list / to punysshe them that be dysobeysaunt to the king of Castle to whom the
heritage of Portyngale perteyned / and by rause they found them rebels /
therefore they said they over rynne y^ country and take prays and prisoners.
Well syrs said sir John^ Ferrant ye shall not led them long / for we will
rescue them / ye have no right to come and to over rynne this country / ye
know well enough we have a king all ready who will keep his royalme in right
and keep Justice / and punysshe thieves and robbers. Therefore we say unto you
in his behalf / all that ye have taken in the royalme of Portyngale leave it
behind you and depart hens / or else in our right and just quarrel we will
fight with you / then the Spanyardes answered / ye prisoners that we have taken
we will not deliver again / but as for ye other pray we will take advise.
The^ the.vii. capytaynes of Castle drew them together / and showed that for
all that they were come to se the garyson of Treutouse / yet they would have been glad to have departed without battle / and when they had counsayled / the^
they said how they would leave their pray behind them / but the prisoners they
would led with them / Nay not so said the Portyngales / for we will ye leave
all / or else ye shall have battle / and so went together / and there was a
sore battle for there were on both parties good men of war / and the field
where as they fought was fair and plain they cast each at other darts so
sore that who so ever was stryken without he were well armed was slain or sore
hurt / there were many propre feats of arms done / and there sir John^
Ferrant Partelere fought with an axe right valyauntly / and so did his.ii.
companyons / on the other party the Spanyardes fought right valyauntly. Thus
they fought the space of.iii. hours / which was marvel that me^ could
endure so long in their armure fighting / but the great dysyre that either
party had to win honor caused them to endure the more pain / and sir
surely Spanyardes and Portyngales are hard men in battle / and specially when
they se it is of necessyte / thus they fought long that no man knew who had
the better / their battle was so egall. And sir thanked be god there was
another baner nor penon on our side that day overthrown / but finally their
side began to open and were beten down on every side / so that the
dyscomfyture fell on them / then their pages fled away to save themself / and
of the.vii. capytaynes yt were there present / there escaped away but one and
that was ye means of his page who brought him his horse / he did his master
good service that day / and yt was Adyentall Cassel all the other.vi. were
slain / for there was never a man taken to ransom. Thus sir John^ Ferrant
Partelere and his company obtained the vyctory of their enemies / who were three
against two / and this was on a tuysday in the month of Octobre nere to
Treutouse / in the year of our lord.M.CCC.lxxx. and.iiii.

How Laurence Fongase showed the duke of Lancastre the manner of the battle of
Iuberoth between the king of Castle and the king of Portyngale. Ca.xlv.
ANd after this dyscomfyture on our enemies our men mounted on their horses /
and there we delivered such prisoners as the Castellyans had taken before /
and also gave them such pyllage as their enemies had gotten / except ye
beestes which were in nombre an.viii. hundredth all those we drove in to the
garyson of Treutouse for vatayllynge of the town as it was reason / and there
we were received with great joy they wist not what chere to make us because we
had delivered y^ country of their enemies / and rescued that they had lost /
whereby we had great praise thrughe all ye towns of Portyngale / and sir in the
same year our men had another fair journey on their enemies in ye field of
Sybylle / but sir first I shall show you the most happyest journey that the
king of Portyngale had or any king before him in.CC. year before / which was
done within.iiii months before that yt king sent us hither our enemies
were.iiii. against one of good men of war and of high empryse / wherefore our
journey ought to be ye more praised. But sir I think ye have herd thereof al
ready / wherefore I think best to speak not thereof / nay said the duke ye shall
not leave so / ye shall show me the hole process / for I would gladly here you
speak thereof / yet of truth I have an heraulte here with me called Derby who
was there at the battle as he says / and he showed me that such English
men as were there did meruaylles in arms / and more by his report the^ I
bileue was of troth / for there was no great nombre of them whereby any great
feate should be done by them / for my brother ye earl of Cambrydge when he came
out of Portyngale brought again with him such Englysshmen as went thither.
But there be many of these Heraultes be such liars that they will exalte such
as they list beyond measure / But for all that the noblenes of them that be
good is not lost nor enpayred though it be not showed by them. Therefore it is
good to know it by the report of other that knows it. Sir said Laurence of
all the strangers that were at the battle of Iuberoth with ye king of
Portyngale / there passed not a two hundred men English / Gascoynes / and
Almaynes / and the grettest capytaynes that were there of the strangers were
two Gascoynes / and one of Almayne of the duchy of Guerles. The Gascoynes were
called sir Wyllyam of mountferrant / and Bernardon / and ye Almayne Albert of
Englysshme^ there were a certain archers but I herd none named / but.ii.
squyers Northbery and Hartecell / and they were called to counsel with the
king and other lords before the battle. Well said the duke prosede forth
and tell me of that journey and how it was fought I require you / sir said ye
squire with right a good will / for sir to show you and other how it was I am
sent hither fro the king my master.

THen Laurence Fongase renewed his tale and spoke of the busynes of Iuberoth
and said thus / sir ye have herd by me / and also by other that after the
coronacyon of the king of Portyngale at Connymbres / yt king of Castle who
had raised his syege fro Lyxbone / for the death of pestylence that fell in his
^ost / and so went to yrayne / and it was said how it grieved him sore when he
was enfourmed of the coronacyon of my redoubted lord king John^ of Portyngale
/ for the king of Castle claymed and yet does right in the heritage and
crown of Portyngale by the title of his wife daughter to king Ferrant which
we denied and yet do / for such cause as I have showed you before / so thus
the king of Castle was counsayled to send for me^ of war where he might get
them / and specially in to France / for ye frensshmen had always aided him
and sustained his quarrel / and ye king his fader in likewise / and it was
said to him by his counsel / ye need nothing but one journey against them of
Portyngale / for by puyssaunce if ye may keep the field and fight with them
the^ ye shall come to your entente / for there is great varyaunce all ready in
Portyngale as ye se and perceive well / for there is here with you of the
noblest persons of ye royalme / and they have submytted themself under your
obeysaunce / which thing gretely furdereth your war / if ye auaunce
yourselfe with puyssau^ce to fight to this basta^rde of portyngale whom yt
commons have crowned to their king or he get aid of the Englysshemen / ye are
like to overthrow him / and if ye win the journey all the royalme is yours /
for it is no great matter to win it after / so by such counsel and other
things John^ of Castle auaunced him self to send letters and messageres in
to France / Poictou / Bretayne / Normandy / Borgon and in to diverse other
places where as he thought to have men of arms / knights and squyres for his
money or for love / or such as held any thing of him / and specially there
came many knights and squyres to him out of Byerne / and so on a day as he
was at saint yrayne he auewed his people to ye nombre of.vi. or.vii.c. speres
and.xxx.M. spanyardes all on horsoacke all having desire to do us damage.

Tidings came in to Portyngale to the king and to ye lords there / and to
them of the good towns and cytees such as were of the kings party / and it
was showed there what nombre and puyssaunce the king of Castle was of / and
how he was fully determined to come and lay fyege again to Lyxbone then the
king of Portyngale and his counsel assembled together / and there the most
notablest persons of his royalme said yt the king were best to go out of the
cite and to mete with his enemies rather then to be enclosed in any cite or
town in Portyngale / for if they were besyeged they should have much busynes
to defend them and their cite / and in the mean season ye Castellyans might
ride abroad at their ease where as they list and conquer towns / Cytees / and
Castelles / outher by force or by love and dystroy all ye plain country / and
peradventure at length them within the cite / wherefore they said to the king.
Sir if we go out against them and take a place conuenyent to fight / we think
this were best and most profitable / for sir we know well ye shall not
peasybly enjoy the crown of Portyngale wherewith we have crowned you without it
be by battle / and that at the leest ones or twyse to overthrow your
adversary the king of Castle and his puyssaunce and if we may dyscomfyte him
/ then we shall be lords of the country And if we be overcome the royalme is in
adventure / but better it were for us to seek battle then to be sought on /
and more honorable it were for us / for sir it has been often times seen that
the setters an has advantage of the defenders / therefore sir we will counsel
you to send forth your letters and messagers to all such as ye think will
serve you. Then ye king answered and said / syrs ye speak well and I will do as
ye have ordained. Then ye king set his clerks on warke to write letters and
wrote to every man that they should come to the port of Portyngale or nere
there about at a certain day lymytted / howbeit all such as were written unto
came not thither / for as then all the royalme took not full part with him /
but dyssmuled and tarried to se how ye matters should frame at length / and
some were gone out of their own country to the king of Castle because they
said that the king of Castle had more right to the crown of Portyngale then
our king had / howbeit for all yt the king my sovereign lord went to
Connymbres and there made his assemble of such men of war as he could get
/ and truly he had with him yt choice men of all Portyngale and of most
auctoryte as of Earls / Barons / knights and squyers / and also he had a.xxv.
hundred speres of squyers / and a.xii.M. foot me^ Then he ordained a Constable
and marshall The constable was the earl of Nauare / ye marshall sir Alne
Perriere both right sage knights to conduyte men of war / then they
departed fro Connymbres and took the way to Cabase that is Iuberoth and rode
fair and easily to ease themself and their horses / and yt their / prouysyon
might follow them in good order / and they had rore ryders one before to a^ewe
the demeanynge of the Castellyans / at this time sir John^ Ferrant Pertelere
was not come to the king / he was at the garyson of Dorech a.v. legs fro
Iuberoth / and I think he knew not as then that the king should fight with
his enemies.

I Suppose the king of Castle was well enfourmed how the king of Portyngale
was coming to him ward with his puyssaunce / and when he knew it he had
thereof great joy / and so had all his men as they showed / and anon they
determined to come on against us / and to tyght with us / and specially ye
gascoynes of Byerne that were there sore desired to fight with us / for they
desired to have ye first battle / and so they had / and sir Wyllyam of
Mounferrant a Gascoyne who was there on our party said surely how we should
have battle because they of Byerne were against us who ever desires nothing
but battle. Then the king of Castle with all his battle came the next day
and lodged at the castle of Lerre a two legs fro Iuberoth / and the next
day we came to the Cabase and lodged there and yt night the king of Castle
lodged but a little leg fro Iuberoth / for he knew well what way we took /
and how we lodged at Iuberoth.

Sir the Portyngales has had always gre^e trust and confydence in god and in
ye good ^ortune of yt place of Iuberoth and therefore they at that time rested
there / Why said ye duke have they so good hope in that place rather then in
another / sir laid the squire / auncyently ye great Charlemayne who was kyngge
of France and of Almayne / and Emperor of Rome who was in his time a great
conqueroure at this place of Iuberoth / he dyscomfyted.vii. kings of ye
mysereauntes / and there were slayned of ye infydelles a.C.M. This sir is
auncyently found in hystoryes and chronicles and by reason of that battle he
conquered Coanymbres and all the country of Portyngale and brought it in to
christian faith / and because of ye great victore yt he had there against gods
enemies he founded there an abbaye of black monks / and gave them great rent
in Portyngale and in Castle / and also sir about a CC. year past there was at
the same place a great betayle and fair journey acheued by a lord that was at
that time brother to the king of Castle / for before that time there was never
king in Portyngale / it was called the countye of Portyngale / and so it was
that these.ii. brethren ye king of Castle and the earl of Portyngale had
mortal war together for partycyon of lands so yt there could be found no
peace between them but mortal war together. The matter touched so much the
earl of Portyngale and the Portyngales yt they had rather to have been deed then
to have been under the subieccyon of the king of Castle / and so they took a
day of battle / and there the king of Castle was so puyssau^t yt he was.x.
against one so yt he set nothing by the Portyngales / so at the cabase of
Iuberoth was their battle right cruel / and finally the Portyngales obtained
y^ vyctory / and the Castellyans dyscomfyted and the king of Castle taken /
by whose taking the earl of Portyngale had peace as he list / then the bounds
were set of the departing of Castle and Portyngale.

ANd then because ye Portyngales saw yt god had sent them the vyctory with so
small a nombre against so great a puyssaunce / then they thought to augment
their land and to make it a royalme / so ye prelates and nobles of the
country crowned their first king at Connymbres and made him to ride thrughout
his royalme with a crown of Laurel on his heed / sygnyfyenge honor and
vyctory as aunently kings were wont to do / and so ever sith the royalme has
had a king / for sir surely rather then the Portyngales would be under ye
subieccyon of the Castellyans they would take one or other that were far of
fro the blood of ye king of Portyngale / and the king were deed without issue
male / and sir when ye king of portyngale that now is came to the place of
Iuberoth / all these matters were showed him / and thus whiles that the
constable and marshall were ordering of their batayles there came to the king
sir John Ferrant Partelere who came the same morenynge fro his garyson of
Dorech and brought with him.lx. speres / ye king had great joy of his coming
/ and when all our bataylles were ordained and that we abode for nothing but
for our enemies / and that our fore ryders were sent forth to aspye their
dealing / the king then my sovereign lord came in among his men and caused
fylence to be made / and then he said / syrs ye have crowned me king / show
now your troth and faythfulnes for sith I am so forward / and specially in
this place of Iuberoth I shall never return again in to Portyngale without I
fight with mine enemies / then every man answered and said sir we shall all abide
with you / and know for truth we shall not fly this day.

TThus the batayles approached / for the Castellyans had great desire to find
us and to fight as they well showed / and we sent forth our fore ryders to se
and know what our enemies did / and they tarried fro us more then.iii. hours /
and that we herd no / tidings of the^ so that we thought we had lost them /
howbeit at ye last they returned and brought us sure word of them and what
nombre they were of by all lykelyhode / and they showed us how their vowarde
were a.vii.M. men of arms armed capa pee as fresshe and as well horsed as
could be devised / and in ye king of Castelles rerewarde there were a.xxx.M.
horse of good men of arms. And when our king and his company knew the nombre
of their enemies and how yt their vowarde were a.ii. legs before ye king /
for the Gascoynes and strangers were not well of accord with the Castellyans
/ then we determined to keep us close together in our strength / and to make.ii.
wings to our battle and our men of arms whereof we had but.ii.M. and.CCCCC.
speres to be between the.ii. wings / sir there might well have been seen good
order of battle and people well recomforted / and then it was commanded by
the king on pain of death yt no man take that day no prisoner / this was
determined among us for the best / for as ye lords and capytaynes said / if
we should entende to take prisoners it should deceive us and make us take no
head of yt we should do / for it was said that it were better for us to fight
well then to take heed of taking of prisoners and to sell our lives derely as
good people ought to do. This word was vpholden and observed then our enemies
came before us close together like good men of war / and then alyghted on
foot and trymmed their harneys and let their horses go / and so came and
approached us fyersly / surely there was the flower of chyualry / and that they
showed well / between us and them there was a lyt^ell dyke no gretter but yt a
knight armed might well pass over / howbeit to us it was a ly^tell advantage
for in ye passing there of our m^en yt were on both wings with their darts
d^yd hurt and mayme diverse and did sore trouble them / and when they were over
the dyke then they assembled them against us / for they thought yt the king of
Castle with his great battle had followed them at hand but it was not so /
for they were all dyscomfyted and slain or the king of Castle came nere
hand us / I shall show you by what means they were closed in between us / and
the commons of our country / who laid on behind them with axes and other
wepons without sparynge and our men of arms who were fresshe came on against
the^ / and caused the^ to recule back / and to fall in ye dyke one upon
another / sir all this was done in less then half an hour / and there was
slain in the field of men of arms mo then.iiii.M. and none taken to rau^some
/ for when any knight or spear of ours would have taken any prisoner / other of
their company would slay the^ in their hands.

THus clearly without recovery the vowarde of our enemies were dyscomfyted /
then came the king of Castle with his battle wherein he had.xxx.M. men well
horsed but when they approached it was nere night / and they knew nothing what
myschefe was fallen on their vowarde / and then they came and mustred themself
before us and a.CCCCC. of the^ lepte with their horses over the dike / but sir
al such as passed over never repassed again / for there was slain a great
part of the noble men such as desired feats of arms and a great nombre of
the barons and knights of Portyngale such as were there with ye king of
Castle against us / and when our people saw our enemies so dyscomfyted / then
we passed over the dyke for m.xl. places ye dyke was stopped with deed me^ / and
took our horses and followed ye chase but yt was not far for it was night / we
would not folysshly go far for doubt of busshme^tes / nor also we were not
so well horsed as the Castellyans / for surely if we had they had received more
damage then they did / and ye king of Castle taken or slain / but the night
came on so dark saved him and many other / sir I shall show you the names of
ye most part of the noble men of France / Gascoynes / and Portyngales that
dyed in the field at the battle of Iuberoth.

FIrst the earl Don John^ Alphons / Serole of Portyngale / the great pryour of
saint Iohn^s in Portyngale / Don Dilgaures his brother / Ange Saluace of Geneue
/ Don John^ Ausalle / sir dangoues / Medrich / dricho Persement / Peter
Resermant / Lugares of Versaunt / the great master of Calestrane / and his
brother called Don Dygo Dygares / Peter Goussart of Seball / John^ Radigo of
Herriers / the great master of saint Jacques. And of Fresshmen / sir John^ of
Rys / sir Ieffrey Ricon / sir Godfrey Pertenay / sir Espaynolet of Spain / sir
Reynolde of Solyere / a knight called Lymosyn marshall of the king of
Castelles oost / and of gascoyns of Bierne / the lord of Bierne / ye lord of
Mortan / ye lord of Bryngoles / sir Raymonde Durach / sir Bertram of Varuge /
sir John^ of Asolgme / sir Raymonde of Valentyne / sir Adam of mourase / sir
menuent of Sarement / sir Peter of Sarembiere and diverse other / mo then.xii.C.
knights and squyers all gentle men. Now sir I shall show you ye names of
them that were slain on our party. First ye earl of Nauare constable of
Portyngale / Galopes Porteke / Peter Porteke / and Agalype ferrant Porteke his
brother / Po^nase of Coygne / Egeas Toille of Podich / Dassue and vasse martyne
of mielx / and his sone vasse martyne who was stryken with a darte clean
thrughe his body. Also there was slain Goussalenas of Merlo / Alue Porie
marshall of ye oost a good knight / Radigos Perriere / John^ James of Salues /
John^ Radigo cosyn to ye king of Ammoudesque / Radigo Radiges Valero^ceaux
mendignes of valconseaux. Then the duke of Lancastre began to laughe / and
Laurence Fongase demanded and said / sir why do you laughe / Why said the duke
/ there is good cause why / I never herd so strange names as I have herd you
reherce. Syrsayd he by my faith all these names we have in our country and
more stranger / I believe you well said the duke. But Laurence what became of
the king of Castle after this dyscomfyture / made he any recovery / or did he
close himself in any of his towns / or did ye king of Portyngale follow him
the next day. Nay surely sir said Laurence we followed them no further but abode
still in the same place where yt field was all night / and the next day till
noone / then we returned to the castle of Alerne a.ii. little legs fro
Iuberoth / and so fro thens to Connymbres / and ye king of Castle went to
saint yrayne and there took a barge and.xiiii. we him / and rowed to a
greteshyp and so went by the sea to Sybyll where ye queen was and his men
went some one way and some another like people dysmayde with out recovery / for
they lost much / and of their damage they are not like to recover it of a
great soason without it be by ye puyssau^ce of ye frensshe king / and because
the king of Portyngale and his counsel know well yt the Castellyans will
pourchace aid out of France because they be alyened together. Therefore we be
sent in to this country to ye king of England and to you / then ye duke said
/ Laurence ye shall not depart hens till ye bear with you good tidinges But I pray
you show me of the other encountrynge yt your men had in the field of Sybyll
as ye spoke of right now / for I would gladly here of deeds of arms / though
I be no good knight myself / sir said ye squire with right a good will I shall
show you.

AFter the fair and honorable journey ye king John^ of Portyngale had at the
Cabase of Iuberoth / and that he was returned with great tryumphe to ye cite
of Lyxbone / and yt there was no tidings of any new assembly of ye
Castellyans or Frensshmen / but held the^ in garysons. Then the king of
Castle departed fro Sybyl and the queen his wife with him and went to Burgus
in Castle / and so our men and theyrs made war together by garysons / and so
on a time the earl of Nauare constable of Portyngale entered in to Castle in to
the feldes of Sybyl with.xl. speres / and came before a town called Valewyde
within which there was a.CC. men of arms of castle / ye earl of Nauare came
to the baryeres and showed well how he demanded battle of the^ within / who
made no semblau^t to issue out / howbeit they armed the^ and when our men had been there as long as it pleased the^ / the^ they returned / and they had not
ryden past a leg of yt country but yt they saw the^ of ye garyson of
Valewyde come galopyng after them / and the capytaynes of the^ was Diogenes of
Padillo an expert man of arms / and ye great master of saint Jacques in
Galyce / and when our men saw the^ so coming they lyghted on foot and
delivered their horses to their pages / and the Spanyardes who were a great
nombre would have set on ye pages and varlettes to have taken their horses fro
them / some said let us wyn their horses / we can not do them a gretter
dyspleasure / nor put the^ to more pain then to make them return on foot /
then the master of saint Jacques said / nay let us not do so / for if we win the masters we shall soon have ye horses / let us alyght a foot and fight with
the^ / they shall not endure against us / and thus while ye Castellyans were
arguing our me^ passed our a little water yt was behind the^ / and there
took a great ground and fortefyed it / and made semblaunt as though they
carried nothing for their horses / and when the Castellyans saw yt they were
passed the water / then they repented the^ yt they had not set on sooner the^
they did howbeit they thought soon to overcome our men / and so came on them
and began to cast darts and when the Castellyans had enployed al their
artyllery and had no mo darts to cast / and had so continued their assault
fro noone till it was nere night. When our men saw yt their enemies had spente
all their artyllery / then ye earl of Nauare made his baner to pass the water
and all his company / so and dasshed in among the Castellyans who anon began
to open for they weresore trauayled / weryed / and chased in their harneys / so
yt they could not help themself / but were all overthrown and dyscomfyted /
and the master oesaynt Jacques slain / and mo then.lx. with him and the other
fled / and so they saved their horses and wan many other fro the Castellyans.
How say you sir had not our me^ yt day a fair adventure / yes by my faith
said the duke of Lancastre.

How the ambassadors of Portyngale had answer of the king of England / and
great gifts / and how they took their leave and went in to their countries.
Ca. xlvi.
And sir because of such rencountres and deeds of arms yt our men have had on
their enemies sith ye eleceyon of king John^ of Portyngale / the Portyngales
are entered in to great joy and most commonly say ye god is for them and their
right / and sir they say not much amys to say ye god is with the^ / for in every
thing as touching any deed of arms little or much ever sith the death of
king Ferrant / they have had the vyctory / and ye earl of Foys yt now is one
of ye gretest lords of the world and full of high prudence / as we know by
them of his country / he said yt fortune was with us of Portyngale / and if
the knights of Byerne had byleued him wha^ he departed out of his couutrey /
they should not have armed themself against the king of Portyngale yt now is
a wise and a dyscrete man and fereth god and loves holy church / and exalts
it as much as he may / and is often times in his oratory on his knees in
herynge of deuyne service / he has ordained yt for what so ever busynes it be
yt none speak to him till he be out of his oratory / and is a great clerk /
and takes little head of any great sermones / and specially he will have
justice kept in all his royalme and poor men maynteyned in their right. Thus
sir at your request I have showed you the manner of our country / and all yt I
know of the king and all his counsel / and by the^ I was commanded at my
departing fro them to show you every thing yt I knew. Wherefore sir it may
please you that I might have an answer / Laurence said the duke or this time*
I have showed you / and yet again I say it that your coming and these
tidings does me great pleasure / and ye shall not depart fro me till ye be
satysfyed of all your requests / and well answered in that ye be come for /
sir said the squire I thank you / then the duke called for wine and spyces /
and so took their leave and went to their lodging to Arcorch to the house of
ye Fawcon in London / there they were lodged with Thomelyn of Colebrunque.

ANd it was not long after but that the duke of Lancastre and the earl of
Cambrydge his brother had counsel together of yt busynes* of Castle and
Portyngale / whereof ye earl of Cambrydge was well content / for he had been in
yt country before / more then a year and he was glad to here of the condycyons
and tytles of the king of Portyngale / and of the queen of Castle / and said
to his brother / sir when king Ferrant lived / the Chanon Robsart and sir
Wyllyam Wyndesore and diverse other knights yt were there with me showed me as
it is now fallen / for they said how they had herd diverse of ye same country
murmr on the queen of Castelles title to Portyngale therefore I took away with
me my sone / and had no great affection to that marriage / In the name of god
said ye duke / the squire that is here of Portyngale has declared all the
matter / and I think we can not have so fair an enter in to Castle as by
Portyngale / for the royalme of Aragon is far of / and also the king there
and his children have always ben more favorable to the frensshe party then
to us / Therefore it were not good sith the king of Portyngale makes for us
this good (...) to refuse it. So on a day for this matter there was a
parlyament holden at Westmynstre / and there it was accorded yt the duke of
Lancastre should have at the costs of ye royalme bitwene a.M. and.xii.C.
speres of chosen men / and.ii.M. archers / and a.M. of other yomen / and they
were all paydein hand for half a year and therewith all the kings uncles were
well content and specially the duke of Lancastre to whom pryncypally ye matter
touched / and as he yt should be chief of ye army / and to dyspatche these
ambassadors of Portyngale / the king of England wrote to the king of
Portyngale loving letters conteynyng great amyte yt he would bear to
Portyngale / and great gifts were given to ye master of saint Jacques in
Portyngale / and to Laurence Fongase who was always with ye duke of Lancastre
/ and with the earl of Cambrydge and so on a day these ambassadors took their
leave of ye king and his counsel / and dyned yt day with ye duke of Lancastre
and the earl of Cambrydge / and the next day they were delivered / and as I un
derstode the duke of Lancastre sent letters to the king of Portyngale / and
also by credence yt he should send a.vii. galeys / and an.xviii. or.xx. other
vessels to the port of Brystowe on the fronters of Wales for him and his
company to pass in to Portyngale / so the ambassadoures departed and went to
Hampton / and there found their ship yt tarried for them / and so entered in to
the sea and had wind at their will / and so entered in to ye high Spaynysshe see
/ and within.v. days they were in the haven of the port of Portyngale / at
which time the king was there and was right joyful of their coming.

ANd there ye great master of saint Jacques in Portyngale and Laurence Fongase
showed ye king and his counsel al yt they had seen and herd in England as
well of ye king as of his uncles and delivered their letters which certefyed
al their saynges / then anon after the king of Portyngale (Who gretely
desired the aid out of England to ye entente to cause his enemies to have the
more fere) determined with his counsel yt master Alphons V^etat chief patron
and master of all his ships and galeys in Portyngale yt he should prepayre
ready.vii. galeys and.xviii. other great Chyppes / and to sail in to England
to fetch ye duke of Lancastre and his company / and so Alphons was commanded
thus to do / and he incontinent did so and so on a day departed fro the port
of Portyngale and in.vi. days he arrived at Brystowe / at which season the
lords of England / for ye most part were about ye marches of Wales / for
the king was there when the duke of Lancastre knew of the coming of these
ships he was right joyful. Then knights and squyers and al such as should
go with him were sent for / so that in the port of Brystowe there were.CC.
vessels with the flete of Portyngale ready apparelled for ye duke and his
company / and the dukes entencyon was to have with him his wife and his
children and to make with them some good maryages in castle and in Portyngale
or his return again in to England / for he thought not shortly to return
/ for he saw the busynes in England lykely to be hard and sharp / and how
the king his neuewe was young and had about him peryllous counsel / wherefore
he was ye gladder to be gone / and or he departed in the presence of his
brethren / he ordained his sone ye lord Henry earl of Darby his lieutenaunt
of all yt he had in England and set about him wise and sad counsel / he was
a lusty young knight / and was sone to the duches of Lancastre the lady
Blaunche daughter to queen Phylyp of England / I never saw.ii. better ladies
nor of more noble condycyon nor never shall though I should live this thousand
years which is impossyble.

WHen duke John^ of Lancastre had ordered all his busynes in England the^ he
took leave of the king and of his brethren / and so he went to Brystowe / and
there tarried a.xv. days and shypped all his horses and bagages mo then.ii.M.
with hay / lytter / and fresshe water for them. Then the duke entered in to a
galey well apparelled and had by him a great ship yfnede were for him / and for
the duches Constaunce his wife who went in this journey with a good courage /
for she trusted then to recover her heritage of Castle and to be queen there
or she returned again / and she had with her a daughter called Katheryne /
and by her first husband.ii. other daughters Izabel and Phylyp / which Phylyp
was married to sir John^ Holande who was constable of ye oost and the marshall
was sir Thomas Mor^aur who had also in marriage one of his daughters / howbeit
she was a bastard and was mother to ye lady mercell damoysel Mary of saint
Hyllary of Hauman / and admyral of ye dukes nauey was sir Thomas Percy / also
there was sir yon fythwaren / the lord of Lucy / sir Henry Beaumond de poumins
/ sir John^ of But nuell / the lord Talbot / the lord Basset / sir Wyllyam
Bea^champ / sir Wyllyam Wyndefore / sir Thomas Tracon / sir Hughe Spenser / the
lord Wylloughby / the lord Braston / sir wyllya^ Fermiton / sir John^
Dambricourt sir Hughe Hastynges / sir Thomas Wancestre / sir Mauburyn Liniers /
sir Loys of Rochestre / sir John^ Soustre / sir Phylyp Tacyel / sir John^
Bouboufer / sir Robert Clycon sir Nycholas Trenton / Hugyn of Caurele / Dauyd
Houlegiax / Thomas Allerey / Hobequyn Beaucestre / and diverse other all with
penons beside ye barons they were a.M. speres of knights and squyers of good
men of arms / and.ii.M. archers / and a.M. of other tawle yome^ / they had a
fair season as in ye month of May which is lightly pleasant and peasyble /
and so they sailed coostynge the I Will of wight and Gernsey till they came open
on ye coost of Normandy they were.CC. sails and it was a great beautye to se
the galeys glyde on the sea approchynge the land full of men of arms and
arches seeking for some adventures / for it was said to them that the army of
Normandy was on the sea / and truly so they were till the English flete
appeared before ye bounds of Ouarentyne / but they knew by their balengers
that the army of England was coming / and therefore they withdrewe themself
in to the haven of Harflewe.

THere is lyghtely nothing but that it is known / and specially of deeds of
arms / for lords / knights / and squyers will gladly talk together thereof /
When the dyscomfyture was at Iuberoth where as the king of Castle took such
loss as ye have herd / tidings thereof came in to Franuce as it was reason /
for there were many there that had lost at ye battle their friends and kynsmen
/ and as then there was no war so lykely to be as in Castle / also they
herd true report how ye duke of Lancastre claymed as his right enherytaunce
the heritage of Castle / and how he had raised in England a great army to
the entente to draw in to Castle or in to Portyngale / so then knights and
squyers of ye low marches to auaunce their honor drew and sent each to
other to determyne how they might best draw in to Castle / some cou^sayled
to go thither by land to eschew ye perils of ye see / and also to escape fro
the encountrynge of ye English nauye / and some said nay thereto / for they
said ye passage by land was over long. And also they thought yt the king of
Nauare was not clearly favorable to ye frensshe party / for the frensshmen
and he loved but smally together / for it was said / and true it was the
frensshe men had taken fro him all his enherytau^ce in Normandy / howbeit I can
not tell if his quarrel were just or not / so thus these co^panyo^s doubted
gretely the perils yt myyght fall by going by land as well for the king of
Nauare as for other / and they thought they should never come there by the way
through Aragon / so at last they concluded to go to Rochell as they did / and
there to take these / there they rygged an.xviii vessels and took but few
horses with them / and when they were all ready and had wind at their will / they
entered in to their vessels and so sailed toward Bayon / for yt way or nere
thereto / they must needs pass / and in yt company there was ye lord of
Coursey / sir John^ Handoy / ye vycou^t of Verliere / sir Peter of Vellamines /
sir Guy of Baueux / sir John^ of castle Morant / ye lorof saint Liger / sir
James of Fougeres / ye lorof Bellannes / sir Trystram of Langurant / ye lord
Bartoys of Bars / and diverse other / so yt they were a.CCC. knights and
squyers of chosen men desiring arms / thus they sailed by the sea and had
wind and wether as they would wysshe / and so aryued without peril or damage
at the port of saint Andrewe in Bysquay / in ye year of our
lord.M.iii.C.lxxx. and.vi. ye.xiiii day of the month of May.

WHen these knights and squyers of Frau^ were aryued at saint Andrews there
they refresshed them.ii. days / and in that space they drew out of their
ships their horses and bagages / then they set forth and demanded where
they should find the king of Castle / and it was showed them how they
should find him in the cite of Burgus in Spain where as the^ he had a great
counsel for ye busynes of his royalme. These knights and squyers took their
way to Burgus / and so came thither / and the king of Castle was right joyful
of their coming / and demanded of them tidings of France and what way they
came thither They answered how they came by the sea fro Rochel and how it was
said in france yt the duke of Lancastre had a great army of me^ of arms and
archers to come ye same season in to Castle or else in to Portyngale / and
also how ye king of Portyngale had sent a no^bre of galeys and other ships
in to England for him / of these tidings ye king of Spain was more pensive
the^ he was before / how be it he made no semblaunt but well he thought he
should have sore war in that season / how be it he made good chere to these
knights and squyers of France and thanked them gretely of their coming. And
then he said to sir Robert of Braquemont / and to sir John^ his brother. Syrs
when ye departed fro me the year that is past I desired you that when soever ye
returned again hyder that ye should bring with you tenyse balls of Paris
for us to play together / how be it it had been better I had charged you to
have brought good ba^senetes / and good harneys / for I think we shall find
the season well to enploye them. Sir said the knight / we have brought of both
/ sir always we can not be armed nor always play. Thus the king of Castle
made them right good chere / then they had affection to god on pilgrimage to
saint James sith they were in ye country and some of them had auowed so to do
/ so they rode all together for company / and trussed with them all their
harneys as thought they should have gone to battle / and they did wisely in
their so doing / for it stood them in good stead or they returned again as
ye shall here after. Now let us return to ye duke of Lancastres army who
were on the coost of Normandy.

IN like manner as by co^paryson as fawcons / pelegrynes that have stand and
^ested long on the perch has great desire to fly abroad / In like manner the
knights and squyers of England desired to find deeds of arms to auaunce
themself / and said each to other / Why do ye not aryue and go se the bounds
and ports of Normandy / there be knights and squyers to awake us / and to
fight with us / these words multyplyed that it came to ye dukes eyres / and
the duke or he departed out of England knew that sir John^ of Malestroyt /
and the lord of Cambor and Morfonac / and a great nombre of knights and
squyers of Bretayne lay at the syege in bastydes before the castle of Breast by
the commandment of the constable of France. So when ye duke herd of the
great desire yt his men had to find some deeds of arms / then he said to his
admyrall sir Thomas Percy / and to the constable of his army sir John^ Holande
commaundynge them to address their nauey toward Bretayne saying how he
would goo and se the castle of Breast to vysyte and comfort ye companyons
therein and to look on the^ yt be without in the bastyde / of these tidings ye
English men were joyful. Then Alphons Vietat chief patron of the nauey of
Portyngale who knew right well the way and the entrees in to Bretayne / which
were right peryllous and dangerous / he made his Galey to lead the trace and
showed ye way to other. The season was sayre and pleasant / and the sea
peasyble / so they sailed toward the haven of Breast / and then tarried for the
tide / for they knew well with the fludde they should in to ye haven of Breast
/ great pleasure it was to here the trompettes and claryons The same season sir
John^ of Malestroyt the vycount of Combor and Morfonac were sitting at dinner /
when tidings came to them how the English army was come then they rose and
armed them / for they knew well that when ye duke of Lancastre had taken land
he would fight with them and raise their bastydes / so they were all well
armed and of good mind to defend them if they were assaylled. They were
a.CCC. knights and squyers / the English men were right joyful when they
were in the haven of Breast / and understood how ye Bretons held their
bastydes / and said how they would go and se them and fight with the^ for they
had great desire to do some deeds of arms.

How the duke of Lancastre assailed the lords / knights / and squyers / that
were in the bastydes before breast in Bretayne / and how they defended
themself. Ca. lxvii.
THus the duke of Lancastre and his company took land a little beside the
castle of Breast and left all their horses and prouysyo^ still in their ships
/ but all the ladies and damoyselles took land to refresshe them ye first day
they did no thing but apparelled themself to lodge on ye earth / for.ii.
or.iii. days in pauylyons along ye see side / and so there they lay all yt day
and that night / and the next morning ye constable and marshall of the army
sowned their trompettes to cause every man to be armed / and so they did and in
good order went toward ye castle to ye bastydes which were strongely made
in manner to have endured a.ix. or.x. years and about ye bastides / there were
dykes / gates / towers / and good walls all made of great tymbre / then the
knights and squyers of England such as desired deeds of arms came to the
barryers of ye bastides / and there began to skyrmysshe with fervent will to win
ye bastydes / and the Bretons knights / and squyers that were within the
bastydes were ready to defend them / and to the entente to fight more at large
hand to hand / they did put away the barryers of their defenses wherein they
did great folly / but they trusted to much in their own chyualry / there was
done many a goodly feate of arms / and herd rencountrynges / and sore
foynynge with speres / and they did best that had best breath / howbeit there
were many of ye Englysshmen / and therefore they gave the Bretons much a do /
and so by clean force of arms the Englysshmen wanne the baylles so yt within
the closure of ye town there were mo then.C. men of arms so that ye Bretons
were at the point to have lost all / and when sir John^ of Malestroyte and the
vycount of Combor saw the manner / then he cried his cry and said what how
syrs / shall we lose all thus / on forward in fighting we should not faynte
but outher death or honor. Then the bretons closed together with great courage
/ and pytched their speres and glayues in the earth and held strongly their
place and fought couragyously / there were many fair deeds of arms done / so
that by force the English men were feign to recule back / for they were so
well resysted that they could get no ground on them / so that they were clean
beten out of ye baylles / and so as on that day they could not win it again.
And at another corner of their bastydes they had a tower of stone descendynge
down from a rock / which the Bretons held to their aduau^tage for keeping
of their bastydes. Thereat was made a great assault with archers and other in
the mean season while the other men of arms were fyghtyng at the barryers /
and there the English men passed over a little dyke that was there / and so
came to the foot of the tower with pycke axes and mattockes in their hands /
and so began to mine sore ye tower / and such as were with in defended
themself and their tower valyauntly / but the English archers shot so
holy together that none durst appear at their defense without they were sore
pauessed / and ye English men undermined so sore the foundacyon of the tower
that it rave clean in sondre / and the one part fell down / and they yt were
with in when they saw it would fall / they drew them all in to the part that
stood. Then ye English men made a great showte / and by that time it was late
/ then they sowned ye retrayte for they said they had done enough for that
day. So then the English men departed and said to the Bretons / syrs abide
there al night and make good watch / for to morrow we will come / and look on
you again / ye se well enough what case ye be in / there is nothing before
you to shadow you from us.

THe entente of the English men was the next day to return again to
assail the bastydes / and to conquer them and all such as were within them /
which was right well in their puyssaunce so to have done So thus the
English men passed the night it is often times said / much things should
fall of men's thoughts if there were no country thoughts there against / I
say it because though there were in the English oost subtle and wise men of
war / yet the Bretons yt were within the bastydes were suffycyently provided
with wisdom / and welconsydered what thing might avail them / and what
thing was for their damage / they saw well they must needs depart thens / or
else to be taken or slain / then they determined to truise that they might /
and to depart and leave their bastyde / as they ordained so they did / and
lepte on their horses / and left their bastydes and took the feldes / and so
took the way to Hambont a.iiii. mile thens / they did wisely therein / for they
feared no pursuit of the English men / because their horses were not a land.
Thus sir John^ Malestroyte and his company rode ye same night to Ha^nybout /
they found it open then they feared but little the English men The next day
the trompettes blewe and every man in the oost armed him / and drew toward
the assault of the bastyde. Then they herd tidings how the Bretons were
departed and had left the bastyde void / then ye Englysshmen repented them in
that they had not laid a busshment for them / whereby they should not have lost
so their pray. Then they brake down the bastyde and set fire thereon. Thus by
the duke of Lancastre ye bastydes were raised before Breast / and the same day
the duke and sir John^ Holande and certain other lords went to se the
castle of Breast and the ladies with them and there they ete a dra^ke and made
chere and so went again to their lodgings / and ye next day which was
ye.iii. day they refresshed their ships with fresshe water and the.iiii. day
took shyppynge and so departed.

THe fourth day after the duke and his company and the maryners took counsel
together which way they should draw and whether they should take land at
Lyxbone or at the port of Portyngale / or in Bysquay / or at Coulongne / and
long they were in counsel or they were fully determined / and Alphons Vietat
patron of the galeys of Portyngale was sent for to them / and ye questyon was
demanded of him / and he answered and said. Syrs for this cause I was sent to
you out of Portyngale fro the king my master and sir know for truth that
where soever ye aryue in his country / ye shall be right welcome to him / and
it shall be right joyful to him for gretely he desires your coming and to se
you. So thus the space of an hour they were at a point to have landed at the
port of Portyngale a.xxx. mile from Lyxbone / Howbeit after they changed
their purpose / for it was said among them that it were far more honorable
for them to land in the marches of their enemies then in the land of their
friends / saying also that if their enemies know yt they be landed on them
they shall be the more feared then they rested to take land at Coulongne in
Galyce / ye maryners set their course that way / and had wind and wether at
will and so after they departed fro Breast ye.v. day they came to the haven of
Coulongne and tarried for the fludde / wherefore they should not approach nere to
the land.

Now shall I show you of the knights of France as the lord of Barroys sir
John^ Braquemont / sir John^ of Castle Morant / sir Peter of Bellames / sir
Trystra^ and other that were come in pilgrimage to ye town of Compostella /
where lies the body of saint James / and when they had done their pilgrimage /
and offered / and were in their lodgings tidings came to them how the
English men were on that coost / and by lykelyhode to aryue at Coulongne or
they could untruss their harneys and discharge their mules. Then they armed
them quyckely / and determined to go thither to defend the port / castle and
town there / and such as knew ye country said syrs auaunce forward
shortly for if the English men happen to win the town or Castle of
Coulongne they will be lords of all the country about / these knights did
such dylygence that they came the same night to the town of Coulongne which
was a.xiiii. long miles thens / and a country full wild to labor in. They
came so to the point that they entered in to ye town and Castle the same
season that the Englysshmen came in to the haven / and of their coming they of
the town and castle were right joyful / and all that night came after them
their caryages and summers / and in the morning it was great beautye to behold
entering in to the haven ye galeys and ships charged with men and prouysyon /
and to here the trompettes and claryons sound / and the trompettes and
claryons of ye town and castle did sound in likewise against them / the^ ye
English men knew well that men of war were in the town and Castle. Then
they issued out of their galeys and ships in to ye feldes / not as then
approchynge the town / for they saw well ye town was strong and well
provided of men of war / and without the town there were certain fissher
houses. There ye English lords made their lodgings / and so lay still
a.iiii. days doing none other thing / but dyschargynge of their ships /
they had so great prouysyon / and their horses were set a land / which had been on ye see a.xv. days sore oppressed what with the furoure of the sea / and
with the nombre of people in every ship / yet they had been well kept / and
had hay / ootes / and fresshe water sufficyent / wha^ every thing was voyded
out of the galeys and ships / then it was demanded of ye duke what he would
have done with his nauey / he answered and said / I will that all the maryners
be paid of their wages / and then let every man do his own profit I give
them good leave / for I will that every man do know that I will never pass
again the sea in to England till I have my full pleasure of the royalme of
Castle / or else I will dye in the quarrel / then ye maryners were paid so
that every man was content / and so departed when they might out of the haven
of Coulongne / and some went in to Portyngale / and some to Lyxbone / and some
to Bayon or to Albay in Bretaygne / or in to England so that none abode there
behind. Thus the duke of Lancastre and his men lodged without Coulongne in
such little houses as they found there / and abroad in the feldes in bowers
made of grene bows like men of war.

About the space of a month and more the duke lay at Coulongne and remeued
not without it were a hunting or a hawkynge / for ye duke and other lords of
England had brought with them hawks and hounds for their sport / and
sparowe hawks for the ladies. Also they brought with them in ye ships mylles
to grynde corn and ouyns to bake in / their foragers went daily a foragynge
where as they thought to speed / howbeit they found no great plenty of forage
/ for they were lodged in a poor country and a deserte / Wherefore they were
driven to go far of for forage. And also they of the garyson of Coulongne as
ye barroys of bars who right well could take a vauntage of his enemies if
need were and his other companyons / When they saw the English foragers ride
forth so folysshly / they thought on a day to be before the^ and to make them
pay for all they had before / so on a day they armed them a.CC. and rode by
guide in the night about the woods and mountains / and so at the brekyng of
the day they came to a wood and to a mountain called the Espynet and there
tarried / For it, was showed them how the English foragers rode abroad / and
true it was to ye nombre of.iii.C. And when these foragers had been a broad
a.ii. days and gotten much forage / then they returned toward their oost /
and their way lay to pass the pace of the pynet. Then they of the busshment
brake out on them and cried Barroys of bars. Then the foragers were abashed
/ for the most part of them were unarmed / they had a six socore archers who
did put themself in good order of defense / and began to shote / and did hurt
and wound men and horses / and when their shot was past they cast away their
bows and fell to other defense with such wepons as they had / and some hyd
them to save themself / what should I make long tale of these English
foragers / there were slain a.C C. and the other saved themself as well as
they might in busshes and hedges where as horsemen could not come to them / and
such as fled came to Coulongne and there showed how ye barroys of bars had
overthrown them / then they of the oost began to styre and to arm them / and
sir Thomas Moreaux marshal of the oost with a.CCCCC. mounted on their horses
with the penon of saint George and set forth with great desire to find the
frensshe men / and rode so long that they came to the Espynet / and there
they found their men lyenge deed / and no thing else / for the frensshe men
were departed / so they returned without doing of any thing else / and when
they were wtin half a mile of their oost they saw where the frensshmen entered
in to their garyson of Coulongne / Wherewith they were sore dyspleased / but
they could not amend it / and that day the marshal was sore blamed of some of
the oost in that he sent forth or suffered to go forth any foragers without
sure conduyte / considering their enemies being lodged so nere them in a sure
hold / and of such nombre able to overthrow.v. or a.vi.C. foragers / the
duke of Lancastre and the Constable so blamed him that he was sore ashamed
thereof / but he excused himself and said how they had been forth more then.x.
times before / and had no hurt Well said the duke take better head another
time / for a case may fall in an hour or in a day that peradventure shall not
fall again in an hundredth days.

How the duke of Lancastre and his oost when they had soiourned a momoneth at
Coulongne / then they departed and rode toward saint James in Galyce. Ca.
xlviii.
ANd when the duke of Lancaster had soiourned at Coulongne ye space of a month
and more / then he was cou^sayled to dyslodge the^s and to draw toward saint
James in Galyce / where was a better country and a more plentyfull for men and
horses / so he departed and rode in three batayles. First the marshal with.CCC.
speres and.vi.C. archers. Then the duke with.CCCC. spear and all the ladies and
damoyselles in his company / and in the arrere guard the constable sir John^
Hollande with a.CCCC speres and.vii.C. archers. Thus they rode fair and easily
in.iii. batayles / and were riding three days between Coulongne and saint
James. The country of Galyce was sore afraid of the dukes coming thither /
for they fered gretely his puyssau^ce. The marshall with his vowarde came to
Compostelia where ye body of saint James lies / and the town was closed
against him / howbeit there were no men of war there in garyson / but men of
ye town yt kept it / for there were no frensshmen would undertake to keep it
to the vtteraunce / for it was not strong enough to be kept against such
men of war as the duke had brought thither. The marshall of the oost sent
thither an heraulde of arms to know their ententes what they would do / the
heraulde came to the barryers and there found ye capytayne of ytwarde called
Alphons of seen / then the heraulde said sir capytayne here a little beside is
the duke of Lancastres marshall who has sent me hyder and he would gladly
speak with you. Well said yt capytayne / it pleseth me well / let him come hyder
and we shall speak with him / ye heraulde returned and showed the marshall as
they said / then ye marshall with.xx. speres with him went thither and found at
the barryers ye capytayne and certain of ye chief heedes of the town / then
ye marshal lyghted on foot and.iii. with him and the lord Basset and sir
Wyllya^ Fremyton / then ye marshall said / ye capytayne and your men. My lord
the duke of Lancaster and my lady and your lady of Lancastre daughter to king
Don Peter your lord and king has sent me hyder to speak with you to know
what ye will do or say / outher to receive them as ye show do your sovereign
lord and lady / or else they to assail you and take you perforce / and
surely know for troth if ye be taken perforce al ye within the town shall
suffer death with the sword to give ensample to all other / sir said the
capytayne we will not use us but by reason we would gladly acquyte us to them yt
we belong / we know right well yt my lady Co^stau^ce or Lancastre was daughter
to king Don Petero of Castel^s yt if king Don Peter had abyden peasybly still
king she had been then ryghtfull enherytoure of Castle / but the matter
changed otherwise / for all ye royalme of Castle abode peasybly to kynge^ Henry
his brother by reason of the battle yt was at Na^tuel / so yt we al of the
country swear to hold king Henry for our king / and he kept it as long as
he lived and also we have sworn to hold king John^ his sone for our king /
but sir show us what have they of Coulongne done or said to you / for it may
be so sith ye have line there more then a month yt they have made some manner
of treaty with you / yt is true said the marshal we are at a treaty with them /
or else they had not escaped as they did / and yet the town of Coulongne is
twyse so strong as is this town / I shall show you what treaty they have made
with us ye me^ of ye town have pryuely made a composycyon with us saying how
they will do every thing according as ye do but though ye will suffer yourselfe
to be assailed and dystroyed / yet so will not they do / for if the country
of Galyce do yield them to my lord the duke and to my lady / they will do in
like wise / and in this we have good pledges and suffycyent / that is well said
said the capytayne / we in likewise will hold the same treatye / there be in
the royalme many mo good cytees and towns / ride on forth and leave us in pease
/ and we will do as they do / and in yt we will deliver you good pledges and
ostages Nay sir not so said the marshall. My lord ye duke nor my lady will not
suffer yt / for they will come and lodge here in this town and keep their
estates as they should do in their own heritage / therefore answer us shortly
what ye will do / outher to yield or to be assailed and taken by force and
destroyed / sir said the capytayne give us little leisure yt we may speak
together and we shall answer you shortly / I am content said the marshall /
then the capytayne entered in to ye town and caused every man to come before
him. Then wisely he showed to them from point to point as ye have hard
before / and finally they agreed to receive the duke and ye duches peasybly as
their lord and lady / and to abide in their town as long as it pleased them
without the puyssaunce of king John^ did drive them thens / and also that when
they had tarried there as it pleased them a year or.ii. longer or shorter / and
that when they departed out of ye country without they left there a
suffycyent garyson to defend them fro their enemies / else they to render it
again to king John^ or to his marshall if they were / so commanded / and so
they to be quyte of their faith and promise then made. This treatye ye marshall
sir Thomas Moreaur accepted and said how they said as they ought to do and that
the duke and ye duches desired nothing else of them. Then the marshall
returned to his men and so to the duke who tarried for him in the feldes /
there he showed ye duke this trety where with the duke was content / and so in
good order of battle the duke rode to the town of saint James.

WIthin.ii. little frensshe miles of saint James in Galyce there came in
processyon all the clergy of y^ town with crosses and relykes and me^ women
and children tomete with the duke and the duches / and the men of the town
brought the keys with the^ which they presented to the duke and to the duches
with their good wylles by all semblaunt / I can not say if they did it with
their good hearts or no / there they kneled down and received their lord and
lady / and they entered in to ye town of saint James and the first voyage they
made they went to the church and all their children and made their prayers
and offrynge with great gifts / and it was showed me yt the duke and ye duches
and their.ii. daughters Phylyp and katheryn were lodged in an abbay and there
kept their house and ye other lords as sir John^ Hola^de / and sir Thomas
moreaux and their wives lodged in y^ town / and al other barons and knights
lodged abroad in ye field / in houses and bowres of bows / for there were
ynowe in the country they found there flesh and strong wine enough whereof
ye English archers dra^ke so much yt they were often times dro^ken / whereby
they had ye fevers / or else in ye morning their hedes were so cuyl yt they
could not help the^ self all the day after.

ANd when ye Barroys of bars and John^ of Castle morant and ye other knights
and squyers as were in ye castle of Coulo^gne herd how ye duke and duches were
entered peasybly in to saint James / and yt they were there received / the^ they
took counsel together what was best for the^ to do / and said it was but folly
to tarry there any longer / for here we can have no good adventure / let us go to
Burgus to ye king and se what he will do / it can be none otherwise but that he
will go against these Englysshmen / for if he suffer the^ to lodge thus in rest
by little and little they shall co^quere and be lords of Castle wherefore it
is more honorable for us to go thither the^ to abide here / this counsel they
held for ye best / so they made the^ ready to depart and trussed yt they had /
and so issued out of ye castle of Coulongne / and took their leave of them yt
they found there when they entered first / and they took gydes such as knew y^
country / else they had been encou^tred / so they rode through Bysquay costyng
Galyce / and so came to Lion in spain / and as then ye king and the queen
were there / ye king there welcomed the frensshe knights as it was reason and
demanded of the^ tidings / howbeit he knew enough al ready / they showed him
how they entered in to coulongne ye same time yt the englysshmen entered in to
the haven / and how the englysshmen found in the haven.vii. galeys and other
vessels of Bysquay laden with wynes which the englysshmen had to their
profit / the merchauntes had sone sold it / ye said the king so it goth by
the war / they were not wise to tarry when they knew the army of England on
these they might have gone in to some other quarter / sir said ye knights they
were come thither in trust of saufegarde for they said the wynes and other
marchaundyse yt they had should go in to flaundres / for they had her de well by
ye maryners of saint Andrews yt the englysshmen were on the sea / and on the
bounds and coost of Bysquay / and true it is y^ king of Portyngale sent to
the^ galeys and great ships thyn king how they would have landed at ye port
of Portyngale or at Lyxbone / but they did the contrary as it appeared / for
they entered in to Galyce by Coulongne / Well syrs said the king / among you
knights of france who knows more of deeds of arms the^ me^ of this
country / for ye have more haunted and used the war the^ they have / how
think you by the englysshme^ how have they borne themself all this season /
sir said they they have borne themself like good me^ of war / for they be so
close and pryuy yt hard it is to know what they entende to do / but supposyng
we think ye duke of Lancaster will abide all this next winter in saint James
town and his people theraboute and over rynne ye country of Galyce and wyn ye
small holds and get vytayles and prouysyons / and till somer come by
lykelyhode there shall be some treatye made between him and the king of
Portyngale or else never / there is one point yt causes us to believe yt some
alyaunces shall be concluded between the^ / and yt is ye duke has brought out
of England with him al his daughters married and to mary he has.ii. to mary
and we think ye king of Portyngale your adversary shall have one of them well
said ye king what thing were best for me me to do / sir said ye knight we shall
show you / cause al your towns and castles on ye ^ron^er of galyce to be well
kept such as be of strength / and such as be of no strength cause the^ to be
beten down / it is showed us how men of ye country do fortefy minsters
chyrches and steples / and bring in to the^ al their goods / sir surely this
shall be the loss and confusyon of your royalme / for when ye englysshmen ride
abroad / these small holds chyrches and steples shall hold no while against
the^ / but they shall be refresshed and nourysshed with such prouysyon as they
shall find in them / which shall help to furteth them to win all ye resydue
/ therefore sir we say yt and ye do well cause al such holds to be beten down
now why le ye have leisure and make a cry yt without every thing be avoided in
to ye good towns and in to strong castelles between this and the feast of all
saints / and else let it be forfayte and abando^ tt to your me^ of war who
so ever can catch it / or at the furchest by the feast of saint Andrewe / it
were better your own me^ had the profit there of rather then your enemies /
and sir send specially certain persons of your counsel to ye frensshe king
certefyeng him what case you and your country is in / thus sir send to the
king and his uncles ye duke of Berrey and ye duke of Borgoyne showing the^
surely yt by all lykelyhode in this next somer ye shall have ye grettest war yt
ever was made in spain other by ye prince or by any other / sir write pyteous
letters desiring the king and his uncles to comfort you in this your great
need with some good me^ of arms to resyst your enemies and to keep and def^de
your royalme / there is great alyaunces all ready between the frensshe king and
you / and in likewise was by him and your fader / and sir surely in no wise ye
frensshe king and the noble royalme of france which may do more in deed the^
england and Portyngale joined together / in this case will not fail you / for
when ye fre^sshe king and his counsel be justly enfourmed of every thing /
ye shall well perceive they will take such regard thereto yt ye shall take but
little damage by this war / for knights and squyers of france desyring to
auaunce their deeds with a little word or commandment will draw in to these
parties to find deeds of arms / for as now they wot not where to employ
their time better for france and flanders as now be accorded which has been
at war a long season / and also there is a truce between france and england
as beyond ye river of Loyre to endure to ye feast of saint John^ baptyst /
therefore sir ye shall se knights and squyers of france come hyder in good
nombres as well to find deeds of arms as to se this country and to mete ye
englysshme^ / but sir we counsel you for your profyre yt al these small holds
chyrches mynsters and steples abroad in ye country let the^ de put down if ye
think to have joy of ye resydue / the^ the king of Castle said / syrs ye
counsel me truly / and thus will I do fro hence forward / the^ without
taking of any further counsel he commanded al such holds as were of no
great strength to be beten down / and abandoned to ye frensshe knights al yt
they found in the^ and to se yt it were done as they had devised / syrsayd
they yt is well said / sir we shall se it acco^plysshed and shall help to save
all the resydue / this word yt the king of Castle said to the^ of france and
the auctorite yt he gave to the^ was well worth to the^.CC.M. frankes of profit
and specially to the^ yt came first in to Castle / when the duke of Lancaster
aryued at coulongne. Thus thrughout all the royalme of Castle al small holds
chyrches and steples and such as were not sufficyent to be kept were put
down and all ye goods in the^ abandoned to the me^ of war so the people of
ye country were atrapped and begyled such as had fortefyed such places and
put in the^ their goods as wine corn^ flesh and other things thynkyng there
to have kept the^ sure / but it fell the contrary / for knights and squyers
sent thither their me^ and took al and brought such prouysyon as they found
there to their masters lodgings / but as for gold and silver such as they
found and such money as they made the vylaynes to pay for their own goods /
yt money never came to no knowledge / for yt they kept still in their purses /
and some of ye poor co^panyons such as were more subtyl the^ other most
adventured and thereby wan most / often times such as comes fro their own
howses most porest in such cases be sonest mounted on good horses and
genettes.v. or.vi. in their stable / gyrdelles of chains of gold and silver /
and a.M. or.ii.M. frankes in their purse / and when they were in their own
country / were feign to go a foot or on a nagge / thus ye co^panyons yt came
first in to Castle wan much riches and the poor me^ of ye country paid for all / for they were robbed and ryfled with their own me^ / for they would not yt
their enemies should have had any profit thereof / and when these tidings came
in to france to other co^panyons how ye pore knights and squyers yt were gone
in to Castle were made so rich / they were the more eger to go out of their
houses and to draw in to spain co^sideryng how they might there as well pyll
and rob on their friends as on their enemies.

Of the great apparel and prouysyon that generally was made in the royalme of
france by the king there and by his counsel for a journey to be made in to
England / and also of the death of Frauncis Atreman. Ca. lii.
THe frensshe king and his counsel were well enfourmed of ye voyage yt the
duke of Lancaster should make in to Castle or he departed / for ye voice flewe
quyckely yt the royalme of Castle should have much a do yt somer and to find
some remedy theragaynst / the duke of Burgoyne made so lightly peace with the
gau^to^ se to ye entente to aid ye necessyte of ye king of Castle / whereto the
frensshe king and the royal me of france were bound for diverse reasons for by
ye king of Castle and his men and ships on ye see the busynes of ye royalme
of france were in good state / and also beside yt the young king Charles of
france had great affection to go with an army in to ye royalme of england / all
knytes and squyers of france were well agreed thereto and specially his uncle
ye duke of Burgoyne and the constable of france for all yt he had to his wife
the sister of king Richard of england and also ye lord of Coucy / these
lords and the most part of ye chyualry of france said / why should we not
ones go into England to se the country and the people there and teache them
the way as they have done in france / and so in ye year of our
lord.M.CCC.lxxx.vi. what to ye entente to break ye duke of Lancastres voyage
and to cause him to return out of Castle and to give fear to ye englysshme^
/ great ordenauu^ce for yt voyage was made in trau^ce and taxes and tallages
set and allysed in cytees and good towns and in ye plain country yt in a.C.
year before there was none such seen / and also great apparel made by the sea
al y^ somer till ye month of septembre they did no thing else on y^ see coost
but grynde corn and bake bysket / and at Tournay / lysle / doway / arras /
Amyas / bethune / saint omers / and in all the towns about Sluse / for ye
frensshe kings entencyon and his counsel was to take ye see at Sluse and so
to enter in to england to distroy ye country / they yt were rich men in ye
royalme of france to ye aid of this voyage were taxed and tayled to the.iii.
and.iii. part o^ their goods and many paid more the^ they were worth beside
to acco^plysshe ye payment for men of war.

FRo Spain and fro the port of sybyll to Pruce there was no great ship on ye
see yt ye frensshmen could lay their hands on nor under their own obeysaunce
but were retained for ye frensshe king and his men / prouysyon came fro al
parties and aryued in flaunders / both wine / salt / flesh / hay / in tonnes
/ otes / any ons / bysket / flower / eggs in pypes and of al manner of things
yt could be devised / so yt in time to come it could not be byleued but by
the^ yt saw it / lords / knights / squyers and men of war were written unto
and desired to come and serve ye king in his journey / as out of Sauoy /
Almayne / and fro y^ sone going down to ye land of ye earl of Amynacke / and
so these lords of far countries as the earl of Sauoy was retained with.v.C.
speres / also ye earl of armynacke and ye dolphyn of Awuergne / and these
lords though they were of far countries and knew not what end this war
should come to / yet they made their prouysyons so great and costly yt it was
great marvel to think thereof / and it was wonder to consider fro whens all
such prouysyon came what by land and by see in to flanders as to bruges / to
dan / and to Sluse / and so there was sent for in to Hola^de / zelande /
meldebourge / zerechyel dourdrest / stonehone / and to all other towns on ye
see coost and to ye ryuers entryng in to ye see for all manner of ships yt
could do any service / and al were brought to Sluse / but ye holanders and ye
zelanders said to the^ yt retained the^ / if ye wy^ have our service pay us our
wages clearly or else we will go to no part / so they were paid / wherein they
did wisely / I trow sith god created ye world there was never seen so many
great ships together as was yt year at sluse and at Blanquerge / ^or in ye
month of septe^bre in ye said year they were nobred a.xii.C.lxxx.vii. ships
at Sluse / there mastes seemed in ye se like a great wood / and the constable of
France ship was apparelled at Lentregmer in bretaygne / also the constable
caused to be made in bretaygne of tymbre a closure of a town or like a park
yt when they had taken land in englade to close in their field to lodge theri^
more at their case without waking or skries / and whensoever they should remove
their field y^ closure was so made yt they might take it a sonder in pieces /
and a great nombre of carpe^ters and other receyned in wages to atende thereon
/ I herd not yt ye duke of bretaygne made any prouysyo^ to go in this journey
nor the duke of Tourayne the kings younger brother nor the earl of Bloys / al
might not go for some must abide behind to keep ye royalme.

WHo so had been y^ season at bruges / at dan / or at sluse and seen ye busynes
there in chargynge of ships with hay / sackyng of bysket and ladyng in of
onyons / peson / benes barley candelles / hosen / shoos / spurs / knyues /
daggers / axes of war / axes to hew wtal / mattockes nails / beds / couches
/ horseshoos / pottes / pa^nes / ca^delstyckes / and al manner of necessaryes
for kechyn / botery / and al other o^^yces / and of every thing yt could be
thought of / necessary to serve man and horse / al was had in to ships in one
thing or other who so ever had seen it if he had been seek / I think he would
clean have forgoten al ye pain / ye co^panyons of france rekened none
otherwise among themself when they spoke together / but yt the royalme of
england should clean have been lost and exyled without recovery / and al ye men
women and children therein slain and taken and carried in to france in
seruytude.

OF this great apparel thus made to come in to england / ye king of england
and his counsel were well enfourmed thereof / and it was surely affyrmed that
the fensshme^ would come thither for so they had surely sworn / it was no
marvel though this great apparel somewhat at ye beginning abashed ye
englysshme^ / and also y^ matter was showed much more then it was in deed /
and also yt englysshmen were in no sure cer^aynte whether this preparacyon was
to come in to England or else to lay syege to Caleys both by land and by
see / for the englysshme^ knew well yt of all the towns in the world ye
frensshmen most desired to have caleys / wherefore the king of england sent to
Caleys great prouisyon of whete and other corns / salt / flesh fysshe /
wine / bear and other things / and thither was sent sir Thomas Hola^de earl of
kente / sir Hughe Caurell / sir wyllya^ Helman / sir Dangouses / sir water of
Vurnes / sir Water paulle sir Wyllya^ Toucet / sir Loys of Mountalban sir
Colars of Da^brychcourte and.v.C. men of arms / and.v.C. archers / and ye earl
Richard of Aru^del and sir Henry spenser were ordained to keep the sea
with.xl. greteshyppes well decked with men of arms and archers to ye nombre
of.CCC. men of arms and.vi.C. archers.

ON the other side it was said in diverse places in france / in haynalte / and
in pycardy yt ye fre^sshe army yt was thus apparelled in flauders was another
to go in to england nor to Calays / but rather to return al ye matter and
set on ye town of Gaunte / and as it was enfourmed ye town of Gaunte y^ same
season doubted gretely yt all ye apparel was for to come on the^ / but they
were in a wrong believe / for ye duke of Borgoyne their lord would nothing to
the^ but good rest and peace / though yt Frauncis Atreman were slain anon
after the making of the peace at Tournay for of his death ye duke was nothing to
blame / nor the duke had none evil will to him though in ye season of war he
did many feats of arms for ye town agay^st the duke as it has been declared
more plainly here before / for though he came to an evil end it was his own
defaulte / for if he had byleued Peter du boys it had been otherwise with him
for when the peace was made between ye duke of Borgoyne and them of Gaunt / when
he returned fro Tournay to Gaunt / and yt Peter du boys made him ready to go in
to England with sir John^ Bourser / then Peter said to him / Frau^cis what
will ye do / will ye go in to England with us / then he said he would abide
still in Gaunt / why said Peter think you to abide here in peace there is great
hatred against you and me / I will abide for nothing here / it is not to tryst
in ye comontye / ye have herd how they of Gaunt slew and murdered the valiant
Jacques of Artuell who had done so much good to the town both in counsel
and in arms / and for a little cause the vyllaynes slew him / and the honest
men of the town did not save him but rather dyssymuled and was glad of his
death / in likewise Frauncis will they do with you and me if I abide here / but
as for me I will not tarry / therefore adue. Why said Frauncis the duke of
Borgoyne has pardoned all things / and has retained me if I will to go with
him to be as a squire of his stable with.iiii. horses / and he and also sir Guy
of Tremoyll shows me great sign of love. In the name of god said Peter du
boys / I speak not of my lord ye duke of Borgoyne nor of his knights I think
they will keep well the peace / but I speak of the commons of Gaunt / there be
some yt ye have not always pleased / remember ye not of the lord of Sargelles
whom ye made to be slain and other / know for troth yt these passed hatredes
will continue in their hearts / if ye abide among the^ yet it were better for
you to go and dwell with ye duke of Borgoyne. Well said Frauncis I shall take
advise / but in to England I will not go Thus Frauncis Atreman abode still /
and peterdu boys went with sir John^ Bourser / and anon after yt the peace was
cried and publysshed in all the parties of Flaunders / then there was made a
cry that none should bear any armure or sword after him / and Frauncis
Atrema^ who was still in Gaunt and had kept a great estate the war during /
thought to continue somewhat his honestye / ever where he went he had a.iii.
or.iiii. servants waiting on him armed and beryng swords and other wepons
on the^ and when this cry was made in the dukes name he thought it should not
rynne on him nor none of his servants / he thought himself so well in
favor with them of the town / but he was deceived / for within a.vii.
or.viii. days after the cry was proclaimed ye dukes baylyffe came personally to
him and said Frau^cis ye put my lord the dukes officers in great suspecte /
why do you go about in ye town in harneys and your servants beryng swords
and wepons of defense as though it were in y^ time of war which pleases not
us / Wherefore we command you in the dukes name to lay them down / Frauncis
who thought none evil in yt he did but to maynteyne his estate answered and
said / sir baylyffe I will obey as it is reason / and I thank god I hate no
person nor would not yt any should have any hurt for my sake / howbe it I had
thought to have had that aduau^tage in ye town of Gaunt yt I might have had my
servants were their swords after me. Nay said the baylyffe not so / for
such of the town as ye have done service unto speak theragaynste and have
marvel thereof / and demand of me why I do suffer it / they say it seems
that I would renew again the old war / which they will not suffer /
Wherefore Frau^cis I pray you do so that I here no more thereof / for if ye will
not obey I must repute you as an enemy to my lord the duke and to my lady of
borgoyne and so the baylyffe departed fro him / and frauncis went to his
lodging and caused his servants to lay down all their armure / and so
entered in to such a fantasye that most part after he went in ye town all
alone or but one with hy^ child or servant. So it was on a day there was a
feast kept without the town of Gaunt in the abbey of saint Peter's / and
Frauncis Atre man went thither / and but one servant with him without armure
or wepyn / he was spyed and poursued with a bastard sone of the lord of
Harzelles whom he had caused to be slain be fore / wherefore the^ his sone
thought to be revenged of his faders death / this bastard was provided for the
matter / and poursued Frauncis till he came out of the town and far fro any
company and cried on him and said. A thou Frauncis Atrema^ thou shalt dye /
thou caused my fader to be slain / and I shall slay the / and as Frau^cis
turned him the bastard struck him on ye heed with his sword so weyghty a
stroke that he claue his heed to the tethe / and so fell down deed to the
earth and the bastard went his way fair and easily no man poursued him / so
this Frauncis Atreman was well worthy to dye in that he would not believe Peter
du Boys / and when tidings came in to england and that Peter du boys knew
thereof he took but small thought for him and said / or I departed fro Grant I
well aduysed him / let us se now who will amend it / not they that during the
war did gretely honor him / for such doubts I byleued sir John^ Bourser
and came in to england

Now let us return to the prouisyons that were made at this season at Dan
and at Sluse / it is not had in remembrance of man nor by writing never none
like seen nor herd of / Gold and silver was no more spared then though it
had rayned out of the clouds / or scomed out of ye see / the great lords of
france sent their servants to Sluse to apparel and make ready their
prouysyons and ships and to furnysshe them of every thing needful / the
king himself as young as he was had more will to this journey then any other
and that he alwayed showed to the end thereof / every man helped to make
prouysyo^ for other and to garnysshe their ships and to paynte them with
their arms / paynters had as then a good season / for they wan and had what
soever they desired and yet there could not ynow be gote^ for money / they
made baners penons standerdes of sylke so goodly yt it was marvel to behold
the^ / also they painted their mastes of their ships fro the one end to the
other glyteryng with gold and deuyses and arms / and specially it was showed
me yt the lord Guy of tremoyle garnysshed his ship rychely / the payntynges yt
were made cost more then.ii.M. frankes whatsoever any lord could deuyse for
their pleasure made in ships / and the pore people of the royalme paid for all / for the tallages were there so great to fournysshe this voyage / that they
yt were most rich sorewed for it / and the poor fled for it.

ALl yt ever was done in France / in flanders and other places / for this
voyage was well known in England and it was made much gretter then it was in
deed / whereof the people in diverse places of the royalme were sore abashed /
and there were made general processyons in every good town and cite by
prelates and men of the church.iii. times every weke which were made in great
devotion with the hearts with holy prayers and orysons to god to deliver them
fro y^ peril / howbeit there were in england a.C.M. that desired heartily that
ye frensshmen might come and aryue in england and such light companyons in
comfortynge of themself and of them that were abashed said / let these
frensshmen come / there shall not one tail of them return again in to
france / and such persons as were in det and cared not for ye payment thereof
were gretely reioysed of ye coming of the frensshmen / and would say to their
credytours when they demanded their det / syrs hold you still / they forge in
France new floreyns wherewith ye shall be paid / and in ye trust thereof they
lived and spente largely and when they might not be trusted they would say what
would ye have of us / It were better for you that we should spend freely the
goods of this royalme / rather the^ the frensshmen should find it and have it
/ and so by that means there was spente in outrage in England a.M. pound
sterlynge.

IN this season ye king of england was in ye marches and walls and with him the
earl of Oxenforde by whom every thing was done in england and without him
nothing done / and chief of ye kings counsel were sir Simon Burle sir
Nicholas braule / sir Robert tauylyon / sir Robert beauchamp / sir John^ salwen
and sir mychel de la polle / and also there was named ye bishop of Norwyche
and sir wyllya^ Neuell brother to ye lord Neuel / al these as it was said did
with ye king what they list / as for ye kings uncles ye earl of Cambrydge and
the earl of Buckyngha^ could do nothing without it were agreeable to ye other
before said and this trouble and difference among themself was well known in
france which greatly auaunced their journey / they would have had ye duke of
Lancaster to have withdrawe^ his journey out of Castle / but he took no head
thereof to let his voyage / when ye lords of england and the prelates and ye
people of ye good towns and cytees and commons of the royalme were justly and
credybly enfourmed how ye frensshe king was ready to come in to england to
dystroy it / then they drew togider to counsel / the^ ye king was written unto
by his uncles yt he should come to London / certefyeng him how ye commons of his
royalme were not content with hy^ nor his counsel / ye king and his counsel
would not refuse ye going thither but so departed for ye marches of wales where
they had been long and the queen also / and so came to Wyndesore and there
tarried a certain days / and then ye king left there ye queen and so went to
Westmynstre to his palace and there tarried / and thither came to him al such as
had to do / and there they took counsel how they should be demeaned against
this journey of ye frensshe king / then the earl of Salysbury who was a right
valiant and prudent knight said before ye king and his uncles and before al ye
prelates and lords of england yt were there p^sent / sir my souerayn lord
and al ye my lords and other / it ought not to be meruayled of our adversary
ye frensshe king will come and ryn upon us / for sith ye death of the last noble
and puyssaunt king Edward of noble memory this royalme here has been in great
adventure to have been lost and dystroyed with ye vyllaynes of y^ same / and
also it is well known in france / how we be not al of one accord / wherefore
this trouble appears ye which is not little / for he is but a fool yt fereth
not his enemies / and as long as the royalme of England was in unity / ye
king with his people and they with him / the^ we prospered and reigned
vyctoryously / nor we saw nor found none yt did us any great wrong /
wherefore it is now nedeful never more need apperd in england / yt we co^ferme
ourselfe to rest love and unity if we think to come to any honor / and yt we
ordeyne at ye ports and havens of england such prouysyon and defense that
our country receive no blame nor damage.

THis noble royalme of England has been a lo^g^ season in tryu^phaunt flower /
and every man knows well a thing yt is in flower has more need to be well
kept the^ when it is turned to parfyte fruit / therefore we ought to se and
consider how this royalme is in his flourysshynge flower / for within this.xl.
years knights and squyers thereof both within ye royalme and without have had
more honor then any other nacyo^ / therefore let us put to our pains yt as
long as we live we may keep this honor the^ every man said yt it were good yt
it wereso.

The earl of salysburies words were well herd and accepted as the words and
counsel of a noble valiant and sage knight all yt was said by him / and
devised among the^ I will not long rest thereon / for I think not to know al /
but I know well yt the town of Caleys was kept as I said before / and they
ordained to keep ye hauyns and ports where as they supposed yt ye frensshme^
would aryue / ye earl of salysbury because part of his land marched nere to
ye isle of wight which is right oueragaynst Normandy and the country of ^aulx
/ therefore he was set there with his me^ and archers of y^ country / and the

/ and sir henry percy and faulx percy were at yarmouth with.iii.C. me^ of arms
and.vi.C. archers / and sir Simon burle was capytayne of Dover ca^^el / al ye
hauyns and ports between ye river of Humbre and Cornewal were refresshed with
me^ of war and archers / and on ye mountains and hills costyng the sea on the
fronters against flanders and france were set watch me^ and watchers in
diverse manners I ca^ not tell how they had empty pypes filled with sa^de one set on
another / and on the hight of the^ were places for me^ to sir on / which night
and day kept watch lokynge in to the sea / and they were charged yt if they
saw ye frensshe navy aproche toward the land / the^ to make fyers alofte on
ye hills to styre ye country to draw to ye coost where ye fyers apered / and
it was ordained yt they should suffer ye frensshe king peasybly to take land
and al his and to suffer him to enter in to ye land a.iii. or.iiii days / and
so the^ first to go to ye see where he landed and to fight with the ships and
to win them if they cold to dystroy the^ and take al their prouysyon / and
th^^^ follow ye frenssh^e^ / not inco^tyne^t to fight with the^ but to hary the^
and to keep the^ waking and to keep the^ fro going a foragynge / and to
dystroy the^ all yt were abroad in ye country so yt thereby they should
famysshe the^ / this was ye opinion and counsel in england / and Rochestre
bridge was broken where is a great river rynnynge fro arundel in to ye cou^tye
of Essex and enters in to ye see and in to Tamyse against ye isle of Tenet /
this bridge they of London bet down to be ye more surer / and where as taxes
and tallages were great in france on ye men of ye towns in likewise they were
great y^ season in england so yt ye royalme sorowed it a great season after /
but they were glad to pay ye sowdyours to be thereby defended / there were ready
in england a.C.M. archers and.a.x.M. men of arms beside ye great company ye
the duke of Lancastre had in to castle / of whom now we will speak somewhat and
show of ye aquayntau^ce yt was between him and ye king of Portyngale / and then
I shall return to speak again of england / for ye matter requires to speak
as well of ye one as of the other.

How the king of Portyngale wrote amyably to the duke of Lancastre when he knew
that he was aryued at saint James in in Galyce / and of the socours that the
king of Castle sent for in to france / and how the town of Ruelles in Galyce
was taken by the english men. Ca.liii.
YE have herd before in this hystory how ye duke of Lancaster with a fair
company of me^ of arms and archers were aryued at Coulongne in Galyce and how
by co^posycyon ye town not ye castle was yelden to h^ / thus they said they
would do as other towns in Galyce did / and so thereby they were not assailed /
and the^ ye duke his wife and children came to the town of saint James called
Co^post^lia and there laye^ and was in purpose to do till he herd other
tidings fro ye king of Portyngale who knew of a surty yt the duke was at
saint James / whereof he had great joy / thynkyng yt between the^ they should
make a goodly war in to Castle / the^ he wrote letters right amyably with great
salutacyons and sent the^ by certain messagers to ye duke and the duches who
received ye letters right ioyously / for ye duke knew well he should have
gretnede of ye king of Portyngale / for without him or his comfort he saw well
he should make but small speed in his busynes in Portyngale or in Castle / then
ye duke gave to ye messagers great gifts and wrote again letters with great
salutacyons and amytyes to ye king of Portyngale / certefyeng him in his
letters yt he desired gretely to se and speak with him / thus in the mean season
ye letters and messagers went between ye king of Portyngale and the duke of
Lancaster y^ time passed / and king John^ of Castle fortefyed him in all yt he
might and sent of^e in to france letters and messagers desyryng to have aid
of me^ of war to defend and keep his royalme of Castle / sayng yt in ye somer
following he thought he should have great war / because ye king of Portyngale
and the englysshmen were joined together in alyaunce whereby they should be
strong enough to over ryn ye royalme of castle without they were withsta^ded /
ye fre^sshe king and his counsel wrote again to ye king of Castle / byddyng
him to take no thought nor doubt / for within y^ month of January he would
give england so much a do yt they should not know what to do saying yt when
they had dystroyed al England the^ in ye somer they would take ye see again
and so pass in to Galyce and in to portyngale and yt if ye englysshme^ there
and ye portyngales kept ye field they would cause the^ to flee / so yt within a
year they would make an end of al ye wars / so the king of castle co^te^ted
himself with this a^swere for he saw well he could have none other as at y^
time / so there came none out of France to hy^ but such as were there before
/ for all knights and squyers far and nere went to Paris and in to Pycardy
and so to Lysle / to do way and to tournay y^ country.iii. mile of length was
full of me^ of war / y^ nombre was so great yt such as had ye rule of the
navy said yt they could not pass at ye first passage but.xl.M. me^ / the^ it
was ordained and aduysed yt they should suffer no man pass without he were a
propre man of arms and yt every knight should have but one varlet / and a
baron.ii. squyers and that no horse should pass but all only for ye lords /
and to execute this there were me^set at Sluse to se yt none other should pass
howbeit there were such a nombre of rascalles in flau^dres and theraboute yt
they ete up al in the country / and the pore men of the country paid for all
their charges / for they durst not speak against the^ / they were worse to ye
country the^ if englysshmen their enemies had lain there and it was great
doubt yt the king and the lords ones passed over in to England and such
people to abide behind lest they assembled together and dystroy al / and surely
so they had done if the journey had done amysse. Now let us return to the
duke of Lancastre. In the mean season while the duke of Lancastre the duches
and his children with his company lay at saint James knights and squyers of
his company lived at adventure where they might catch it / and on a day sir
Thomas Moreaulr marshal of the oost and (...) him sir Mauburne of luners / sir
John^ da^brychsourte / Tyrry and wyllya^ of Sonnayne and a.CC. speres and.v.C.
archers rode forth in to Galyce / and so came to a walled town a.vii. miles
fro saint James called Ruelles / for the vylaynes yt dwelte therein would not
turn to ye duke / but were rebel and had often times overthrown of the
dukes foragers as they passed by ye barryers of their town / for they had
broken so ye ways yt they could not repasse none other way but by their
barryers / and when they saw a vau^tage they would issue out like thieves and
dystroy foragers or other that passed by whereof ye co^playntes came to the
marshal yt he should provide some remedy acordyng to his offyce^ wherefore he
came before this town of Ruelles / ye watch of ye town had well blown their
coming / whereby ^hey within closed fast their barryers and gates so yt none
abode without / ^^so mounted upon the walls / the marshal when he saw their
demeanyng saw well they^ would abide the saulte / then he said to sir John^
Da^brychcourte and to Tyrry of Sonnayne / syrs take your horses and ride about
the town and be hold well where we may best assail ye town with leest
hurtynge of our men / so they mounted on their horses and rode about the town
it was of no great crycute wherefore they returned again the sooner and had well
aduysed every place and so came to the marshal and said / sir in all this town
there is but.ii. gates / ye one here be fore you and the other right over
against it / sir we think these.ii. places are most easy for us to give any
assault / for round about ye town else are great dykes and deep right
evil to go down and worse to mount up again / for hedges and busshes of
thorn yt grow therein / I believe it well said the marshal you sir Mauburne
shall have a certain company with you and go to the other gate / and I shall
abide here and let us give assault both at ones I wot not what shall come to
us / but gladly I would se yonder vyllaynes yt are lenynge on ye batylmentes of
the walls of their town / they look on us to se what we will do / they are
like apes etynge of peers and children would take it fro them.

OF ye marshalles words his company laughed and looked up to ye walls to
behold ye vyllaynes / the^ sir Maulburyne went forth with his peno^ and with
him.C. speres and.iii.c. archers and went to ye gate and there tarried / so
the^ anon ye assault bega in.ii. parts right sharp and fyers and the me^
within the town were over ye gates and threw down darts so fyersly yt it
troubled ye archers and crosbowes / but they hurt many of the^ with their shot
because there were none at the barriers to defend the^ / for they were al
closed wtin the town and defended themself with shot and cast of darts / so
the englisshme^ brake up ye barryers and came to ye gate / and bet and russhed
so thereat ye they made the gate to trymble and shake when they wtin saw their
gates lykely to be broken up they went down fro the walls in to ye street and
bare great tymbre and wood to the gates / the^ women children and al manner of
people bare stones and filled empty tonnes and pypes and set the^ against their
gates / and so set other above on the^ and filled the^ in likewise one upon
another / and some were still over the gates and did cast down great bars of
iron / so yt none durst aproche nere ye gate without he would be slain / thus
the vylaynes of Ruel kept their town against ye Englyssh men / so yt they
lost but little yt day / and so the Englysshme^ returned back alo^ge mile of
yt country to a town where was no person abiding / and there they lodged
till the next morning yt night the me^ of Ruelles counsayled together to know
what they should do / and how they should maynteyne themself against ye
englysshme^ and they sent out their spies to se where ye englyssh men were
such as were sent forth returned again and reported surely how they were
lodged at the bace town of senace / and yt by all symylytude they would
return again to ye assault the next morning / the^ they said among the^
self / folly it was to begin and more folly to contynewe / we can have no blame
though we yield us to the duke of Lancastre or to his marshall for we have
defended our town an hole day among ourselfe without counsel or comfort
of any gentle man or any man of war. and at length we cannot endure against
them / Now sith they know the way thither and what we can do it were better for
us to yield then to be any more assailed / for if we be taken perforce we shall
lose our bodies and goods / so they were al of this opinion yt if the
English men returned ye next day they would treat with the^ and yield up
their town / their lives and goods saved.

THe Englysshmen in the morning returned / anon upon the sone rysynge to go
to the saulte. When they of y^ town saw yt / they sent out.iiii. of their men
to make their treaty / and as the marshal rode under his penon he saw in the
field these.iiii. me^ and said / yonder I think be of the men of Ruelles
coming to speak with us / bring the^ hyder / and when they were come before
yt marshal they kneled down and said / sir the me^ of ye town of ruelles have
sent us hider to speak with you / pleases it you to here us / yes said the
marshal / say what ye will sir said they we are ready to put you in possession of
ye town of Ruelles / so that you will save our lives and goods and we will
accept my lord the duke of Lancastre and my lady the duches for our lord and
lady / in like manner as they of Coulongne and saint James have done. well said
the marshal I am content and will assure you of your prouysyon / for it behooves
our men to live / sir said they yt is but right / there is prouysyon enough in
this country / sir pleseth you to tarry here a little and we shall return in
to the town and show what you have said / and sir we tryst ye will uphold
this covenant / ye truly said ye marshall / therefore return again breuely
/ so they returned to their town / and showed how they had spoken with yt
dukes marshal / and how they had made with him such a treaty yt they should be
in saufegarde of their bodies and goods except vytayles / then they of the
town said god grant it so to be / the^ they did rydde their gates of the
tonnes with stones and tymbre yt they had set there / and opened the gate wide
/ and so came to the barryers with the keys in their hands sayng / sir we know
well ye be hider sent fro my lord the duke of Lancastre and fro my lady his
wife / sir we render to you the keys of this town and put you in possyssyo^
thereof on such co^dycyons as our men have made report to us / on the same
condycyon said the marshal I receive it / so he entered in to the town / and he
and all his menlodged here and there at their pleasure and there tarried al a
day / and or he departed he said to sir maulburyn / sir I deliver you this
town for you and your company / ye shall have here a fair garyson / sir said
he yt is true / and I take it with a good will / for the garyson pleases me well
/ then sir Maulburyn of Luners abode in the garyson of Ruelles in Galyce / and
had under him a.lx. speres and a C. archers / and sir Thomas moreaulx returned
to ye duke and to the duches to saint James.

How the duke of Lancasters marshall and his men assailed the town of
Vyeclope in Galyce / which yielded by co^posycyon / and of the ambassadors
that the duke sent to the king of Portyngale. Ca. li.
Anon after yt the marshal was returned fro the town of Ruelles on a day he
rode forth again with a.iii.C. speres and a.vi.C. archers / and so rode a
long days journey came to a town called Vyleclope which was kept but by
such villaynes as dwelte in it / the^ yt marshal caused ye town to be auewed
to se if it were pregnable or not and when they had well aduysed it they said it
might be well won by assault / the^ they lyghted on foot and sent their horses
back by their varlettes / and divided themself in.iiii. parts / and made
themself ready like men of war / sir Thomas Moreaulx had the guydynge of one
company / these conde had sir yon Fythwaren / the third sir John^
Dambrychcourte / and the fourth had another knight / and every party had
four score men of arms / and a.vii. score archers. Then they approached to the
town and went down in to the dykes for therein was no water / and then
mounted up again on the other side well pauessed / and the archers stood on y^
side of the dyke / and shot so fyersly that none durst appear at their defense
/ howbeit for all their shot they within defended themself valyauntly / for
they were a great nombre within they cast out darts with long feathers and
sharp heddes so rudely yt who so ever was fully stryken with the^ without they
were well armed / they were outher slain or sore hurt / howbeit knights and
squyres to auaunce themself came to ye foot of ye walls / for all ye stones yt
fell on their basenettes and on their bodies / and the.ii. squyers of Haynalte
Tyrrye and Gyllya^ of Sonnayne did diverse goodly fetes of arms and made a
great hole thrughe the wall with such help as they had / and ^ought sore
hand to hand with them within / and these.ii. brethren wan a.vii. darts
that were cast at them / thrughe y^ hole they pulled them out of their enemies
hands / these.ii. brotherne were under y^ standarde of ye lord Fyth waren /
on ye other part sir John^ Dambrychcourte showed valyauntnes like a noble
knight / and he had at the foot of the wall his penon pytched in the earth by
him / and he had a pykeaxe in his hand and mined therewith to the best of his
power to break the wall / it ought to be meruayled how these vylaynes were not
abashed to se themsefe so assailed on al parts / howbeit they could not so
long endure / but that they had many hands to defend themself withal / but
at the last they aduysed them (When they saw that the assault seized not) to
yield themself. Then ye baylyffe of the town who had caused them so long to
continue came and said to the marshall / sir cause your assault to sease / for
ye men of this town will treat with you / well said the marshall / I am
content. Then he caused an heraulde to ride about ye town who said to every
man / syrs sease your assault till ye here the marshalles trompet blow again
to ye assault / for he is in treaty with them of ye town / and with those
words they seized and rested them / and some of them had need thereof / for
they were very weary with assaylynge. Then they of the town entered in to their
treaty and said how they would yield themself lives and goods saved as they
of other towns had done in Galyce. Nay said the marshall ye shall not escape
so good chepe as other have done / for ye have put us in much pain / and
hurt diverse of our men / and we se clearly that ye can not long endure
against us / Wherefore it must be houe you to bye your pease and our love / or
else we will return again to the assault / and win you perforce. Why sir
said ye baylyffe what ransom will ye ask of us / in gods name said the
marshall.x.M. frankes / ye ask to great a some sir said ye baylyffe / I shall
if it please you cause you to have.ii.M. frankes / for sir this town is but
poor and has been sore charged with taxes. Nay said ye marshal we will not of
yt / we will give you respyte to take counsel together / for as for.iii.
or.iiii. M. frankes ye shall nor escape / for all is ours if we list / and also I
am blamed of my company to make any treaty with you. Therefore shortly
determyne you outher to do it or to leave it. Then the baylyffe went in to the
town and called every man before him and said. Syrs what will ye do / if we
suffer any mo assaults the English men will conquer us perforce so we shall
all dye and lose al our goods / they demanded of us.x.M. frankes / and I have
offered them.ii.M. I know well it is over little / for they will never agree
thereto / therefore we must exalte ye ransom a.ii. or.iii.M. frankes more. Then
they of ye town who doubted to lose all yt they had and their lives also said
/ baylyffe forsake not to marchaundyse with them / for rather then we will be
any more assailed we will pay.iiii.M. frankes / than said the baylyffe / yt is
well said / yet I will treat with them / then he came again to the marshall /
and as I understand their pease was made by paynge of vi.M. frankes. Then the
gates were set open and every man entered and were lodged where they list / and
tarried there.ii. days / and the marshall delivered the town to yon Fythwaren
with.CC. speres and.CCCC. archers and there he lay in garyson more then.viii.
months / but the ransom of the town went to the duke of Lancasters
profit / and the marshall had a.M. frankes.

ANd after that the town of Vyleclope was yelden up to the dukes marshall /
then he returned to saint James to the duke for the duke would have him about
him / and sometime he rode to the fronters of Castle and Spain to give fere
to the frensshe men / but as long as the Englysshemen kept the field in
Galyce there were none that came against them / for the king of Castle was
counsayled not to ride forth with any oost / but to keep war by garysons / and
to abide forsocours out of France. Then ye duke of Lancastre was cou^sayled /
and it was said to him / how yt it were good that he and the king of
Portyngale might speak together / saying also / sir the writing that rynneth
thus between you is good but that is not enough for the frensshe men be
subtyle and se ferther in their busynes the^ any other people / if covertly
they happen to make a treaty with the king of Portyngale / and also the king
of Castle has about him and of his counsel diverse lords in Portyngale as
we be infourmed / and so peradventure by their means / they might make a pease
by marriage or otherwise / so yt then by him ye should have no comfort / what
should fall then / ye should be then in worse case then ever ye were / for the^
the Castellyans would set little by us / the Castellyans are the most
subtylest people of the world / trow you yt the king of Portyngale would not
be content to be at rest of this busynes if the king of Castle would suffer
him to be king of Portyngale all his life / and after him ye king of castle /
sir it is to be doubted though he have sent for you / and so or ye could
turn back again we might be overthrown / and also sir ye know the state of
England which has as now enough to do to keep themself against their
enemies as well frensshmen as Skottes / therefore make as good war as ye ca^ with
such people as ye have / for trust not of no comfort nor aid out of England
outher of men of arms or archers for surely ye are not like to have any / ye
were two years about to get that ye have / the king your nephewe sees not
all things / he is young and byleueth young counsel whereby the royalme of
England lies and is in peril and great adventure / wherefore sir approach as
soon as ye can to the king of Portyngale and speak with him your word shall
do you more profit then all the letters ye can write in.iiii. months / the
duke of Lancastre noted well these words and knew well yt it was true and that
it was truly counsayled / then the duke said to them that gave him that
counsel / what will you that I should do / they answered and said / sir send
to the king of Portyngale.v. or.vi. of your knights and at the leest a baron
/ and let them show the king how ye have great desire to se him / let them
be wise yt ye send / and let the^ find the means that ye may speak together
shortly / I am content said ye duke. Then there was sent in to Portyngale fro
the duke / ye lord poynynges / a great baron of england / and sir John^
Abruell / sir John^ Dambrychcourte and sir John^ Souster bastard brethren to
sir John^ Holande constable of the oost / these departed fro saint James with
a.C. speres and CC. archers.

ANd on a day when al these letters were made and sealed there came to the duke
fro the king of Portyngale a knight and a squire with.xii. speres called sir
Vase Martyne of Cougne and the squire Ferrant Martyne of Merle they were of the
kings house and nere to his person they were lodged at their ease in the town
of saint James / then they were brought to the duke and to the duches and so
presented their letters / and also they presented to the duke and to the duches
and to their daughters fair white mules well aumblynge whereof they were glad /
howbeit for all that the journey of the englysshmen to the king of Portyngale
was nor broken but they were stopped for a.iiii. days / and on the.v. day
departed and this knight and squire all together in company / and the duke sent
to the king of Portyngale in token of love.ii. fawcons pelegrynes as good as
could be devised / and.vi. english greyhoundes good for all manner of bee^tes
/ ^o the Portyngales and the Englysshmen rode together over all the land of
Galyce they were in no fere of ye Castellyans / for they were far enough
ofrro them / and on the way as they rode sir John^ Dambrychcourre and Martyn
Ferrant of Merle fell in talking together / for before that season the squire
had been in arms with sir Eustase Dambrychcourte who was uncle to the said sir
John and was with him when he dyed at Quarencyne / and as they talked together
they rode behind their company / they met an heraulde and a varlet coming fro
Connymbres where the king lay and was riding toward saint James to the duke
of Lancastre / this heraulte perceyned to ye king of Portyngale / and was
called Connymbres. The heraulte had spoken with the lords and showed them
such tidings as he knew / and when Ferrant Martyn of Merle saw him coming
he said to sir John^ Dambrychcourte behold yonder comes an heraulte of ye
king of Portyngales / it is long sith he was in this country I will demand
of him some tidings / and when they met together ye squire said a Connymbres
where have you ben so long / it is more then a year sith I saw you or that ye
were in this country / sir said he I have been in England and have seen the
king and lords there / and they have made me rich with great gifts that I
have had of them / and fro thens I returned by ye see in to Bretayne and was
at ye marriage of the duke of Bretayne / and at the great feast that he kept at
the cite of Nauntes about a.ii. months past / he has wedded ye lady Iahan
of Nauare and fro thens by the sea I went in to Irelande / and fro thens to the
port in Portyngale / and as they talked together the squire beheld a scochyn
that ye heraulte bare on his breast wherein were graued and inamyled ye king of
Portyngales arms and ye arms of diverse other lords / then the squire set his
finger on one of the arms perteynynge to a knight of Portyngale and said / ase
here ye arms mes of the gentle knight sir John^ Partelere by my faith I am
glad to se them for they perteyne to a gentle knight who on a time did me
great profit I ought well to remember it and therewith he took.iiii. floreyns
of gold out of his purse / and gave them to the heraulte who thanked him / and
sir John^ Dambrychcourte beheld well the arms the field silver an endenture
gooles with.ii. chanders fables / and so the heraulte departed / then the
squire said / sir John^ saw you never this knight that bare ye said arms /
whom I praise so much / I can not tell said sir John^ / but at the leest I
pray you show me what was yt courtesy that ones he did to you / I would be
glad to here it / we have nothing else to talk of / I am content said the
squire to show you / for the knight is well worthy to be spoken of / then he
began his tale thus.

SO it fortuned a little before the battle of Iuberoth when the king of
Portyngale went fro Connymbres thyderwarde / ye king sent me in to the
country to warn certain knights to come to him to be with hy^ at that
journey / so I rode forth and but one page with me / and as I rode I happened
to mete a xxv. speres gascoynes / and I was not ware till I was among them /
then they took me and demanded whether I went / and I showed the^ I was
riding to the castle of Ronte / and they demanded what to do / and I said to
go seek sir John^ Ferrant Partelere to come to ye king of Portyngale of
Iuberoth / why said they is sir John^ Ferrant Parteler capytayne of the castle
of Ronte / is he not all ready with ye king of Portyngale / no surely syrs said
I but shortly he will be there / if he ones know the kings pleasure / well
said they he shall know it / for we will ride thither / so they took the way
to ye castle of Ronte / and when they were within the sight of the castle /
the watch of the castle said he saw men of arms approchyng toward the
castle / then sir John^ Ferrant demanded fro what part they were coming /
ye watch said they were coming toward the port A said he they be then
Castellyans and rydeth at adventure toward saint Irayne I will go and look on
them they shall tell me tidings where the king is / so he lepte on his horse
and a xx. with him and took his penon before him / and rode out of the castle
a great galop to come to ye Castellyans who as then were drawn in to a
busshment / and had made one of their company to ride forth on a genet / and
when sir John^ Ferrant saw the geneture he said to a squire of his / galop
forth thy genet and assaye to speak with yonder geneture then the squire
galopped forth and followed him nere ever lykely to take him / for he fled but
softely before him to ye entente to bring him in to ye busshment / and when he
was nere them / the busshment brake out at him / and then he turned quyckely
his back and they that chased him cried Castle / and sir John^ Ferrant being
under his penon seeing his squire returned in such have said / they that
chase my squire be none of our company / they be castellyans set on them / cry
Portyngale for I will fight with them / then he took his spear and ran at
them / the first that he met withal went to the earth / and the second also
/ of.xxv. Castellyans yt were there x. of them lay shortly on the ground and
the other chased / and some were overtaken and slain and hurt / and all this
I was glad to se / for I saw my delyueraunce and in a short season I was left
all alone / then I came to ye knight and saluted him / and as soon as he saw
me he knew me / and demanded of me fro whens I came and what I did there /
then I showed him all mine adventure and how the Castellyans chased me and took
me / well said he and what know you of the king of Portyngale / by my faith
sir said I to morrow he shall have battle at Iuberoth against the king of
Castle for he sent me in to this country to give warning thereof to ye
knights and squyers that knows it not to the entente that they should
resort to him / to morrow said he / ye truly sir said I and if ye believe not
me / demand of these Castellyans that ye have taken / then he demanded of
them tidings they said how surely the next day there should be battle
between the.ii. kings / of which tidings he was right glad and said openly
to the Castellyans / syrs for the good tidings yt ye show me / I quyte you of
your raunsomes / depart when ye will so ye acquyte this squire / so thus he
caused me to be quyted fro them and so they departed / and we y^ same day
returned to ^onte then he made him ready and departed thens at mydnyght and I
in his company / and fro thens to the Cabase of Iuberoth which was a.vi. miles
of yt country / and to eschew encountrynges we rode somewhat out of our way /
and in the morning we herd that there should be battle the same day or we
saw the batayles and when we approached the batayles were raynged in the feldes
/ the king of Castle on ye one party and the king of Portyngale on ye other
/ and at the first we knew not which were Castellyans and which were
Portyngales till at the last sir John^ Ferrant Partelere said I believe surely
the gretter oost be the Castellyans / then we rode forth fair and easily till
we came nere / and then we saw well it was the Castillyans / and I trow some
of the gascoynes brake out against us / then sir John^ Ferrant said / let us
auaunce forth / we se yonder our enemies coming on us / the^ we struck our
horses with ye spurs and rode cryenge Portyngale and they followed us / then
when our company of portyngules saw us / they came forth and rescued us / and
for all that the batayles brake not their array / and so sir John^ Ferrant came
to ye king and acquyted him that day with ye best Thus sir I have showed you
how he did me great courtesye / for he delivered me out of prison / and I had
not ben at ye battle and he had not ben / Therefore sir did he not me a goodly
pleasure / yes truly said sir John^ Dambrych court / and also by you he knew
of the battle yt is true said the squire / and then they rode forth till they
had overtaken their companuy and came the same day to Connymbres.

ANd of the coming of these English knights ye king of Portyngale was
right joyful / and commanded that they should be well lodged at their ease /
and when they were ready / then Martyn of Coygne and Ferrant Martyn Merle / and
the english knights went to the king who received them ioyously / the^ the
Englysshmen did their message and presented the king with the Fawcons and
greyhou^des / of the which the king had great joy / for he loved hounds and
hawks / then they thanked the king on the dukes part for the goodly mules
that he had sent to the duke / and to ye duches / then he said that was but a
small present another time I will send them gretter gifts / this was but for
aquayntaunce of love as lords ought to do one to another to nourysshe love and
amyte / then wine and spyces were brought and the knights of England drank
and so took their leave for that time and returned to their lodgings to souper
/ ye next day they dyned at the kings palace / and ye lord Poynynges and sir
John^ Bancell sat at ye kings table / and sir John^ Dambrychcourt and sir
John^ Soultyer sat at another table with ye barons of that country such as
were there and there was Laurence Fongase a squire of honor of the kings who
knew right well all the knights and squyers of England / for he had seen
them in England he made them ye best chere he could / they were well served
at this dinner / and after dinner they were brought in to the counsel chamber.
Then ye english knights began to speak to ye king and to.ii. earls that
were there present / ye earl of Angose / and the earl of Nauare and said / sir
and it like your grace beside all ye recommendacyons that the duke of Lancastre
has sent unto you he gave us in charge to say to you that he desires sore to
se you / then the king said / and I as glad to se him / and I require you that
shortly we may se and speak together / sir said the earls it were good that it
were so / for till ye be together ye shall not love parfytely / and then ye may
take advise together how ye may maynteyne your wars against ye king of
Castle sir this is true said the knights of england then said the king let
it be done shortly / for if the duke desire to se me / in like wise I desire
to se him / so then they fell in other talking for then ye king charged his
counsel to agree and assygne a certain day when they should mete together and
to assure the english knights thereof / and so they did / and it was agreed
that the king of Portyngale should come to a cite in his country called the
Port / and that the duke of Lancastre should ride alonge by ye frontere of
Galyce / and so there at the partyng of both royalmes to mete and speak
together / and so on that conclusyon the messagers departed and returned
toward Galyce and rode as they came till they came to saint James / and there
showed to the duke and the duches how they had sped / of which tidings ye
duke was joyful and so he had cause for his busynes began then to approach.

ANd when ye season came yt the duke of Lancastre should depart fro saint
James / he left there still his marshall and al his company except.iii.C.
speres / and.vi.C. archers / and sir? John^ holande who had wedded his eldest
daughter with him and many other knights and squyers / and the duke rode the
fronters of Galyce and approached nere to Portyngale / and the king who lay at
the Port knew well of his coming / and so departed with.vi. hundredth speres
and came to the fronters of Portyngale and lodged at a town called Mouson the
last town of Portyngale on on that side / and the duke of Lancastre came to
another town the first town of galyce ioynyng to Portyngale called Margasse /
and between Mouson and Margasse there was a river and fair meadows and a great
plain and a bridge called the mor bridge / and on a thursday in the morning
the king of Portyngale and ye duke of Lancastre with all their companyes met
together there was a goodly and a loving metynge and there were lodgings made
in the feldes of the kings side and thither went the duke of Lancastre to dinner
/ which dinner was well ordered / and there sat at ye kings table ye bishop
of Connymbres / ye bishop of Port the archebysshop of Bargus in Portyngale /
and the duke of Lancastre and a little byneth late sir John^ of holande / and
sir Henry beamonde of England / and there were plentye of mynstrelles and so
were in sport till it was night that day the king of Portyngale was
apparelled all in white with a reed cross of saint George for that is the
habyte of ye house called Mouson otherwise called Denyce in Portyngale / of the
which order the king was and or he was crowned was called master thereof. But
ever after he bare still that deuyse in the honor of god and saint George /
and all his men were arrayed in white and reed / then when it began to be late
they returned to their lodgings till the next day. The king went to
Mouson and the duke to Margasse and between both there was no more but ye
medowe and the river to pass / then on the friday when they had herd mass
they took their horses / and so rode again to mor bridge / and there they met
again / there they had goodly lodging made. The king and the duke had their
chambres hanged with tapyceryes and curteynes as well as and the king had been
at Lyxbone and ye duke at London / and before dinner they counsayled together on
the state of their busynes / and how they should maynteyne their war and when
they should set forth / then it was determined that all the winter ye king
should tarry in his own country and the duke at saint James and to let their
marshal dele / and in march the king and the duke and their men to assemble
together and to go and fight with the king of castle where soever he should be
as the^ / for they said they should be English and Portyngales together a.xxx.
thousand / and when all this was concluded then the kings counsel comoned
among themself for a marriage for their king / for it was time and the
royalme would that he were married to his honor and profit / and for to have
good alyaunces in time to come / and they said they knew not as then where he
should mary more to his profit nor to the welthe of his commons then in the
house of Lancastre / and this they showed to ye duke / and when he saw the
kings entencyon and how that he was in the kings danger seeing he was come
out of England in to the fronters of Portyngale to demand his heritage of
Castle / then he answered smiling and said to the king / who was there
present / sir I have in the town of saint James two daughters I will give you
one of them whom it pleases you to chose. Sir send thither your counsel /
and I shall send her to you / sir said the king I thank you ye offer me more
then I desire / as for my cosyn Katheryne I will leave her still with you / but
as for Phylyp your daughter her I demand and will wedde her and make her queen
of Portyngale / and so brake up their counsel and went to dinner and sat as
they did the day before / they were served notably according to the usage of
ye country / and after dinner the duke returned to Margasse and the king to
Mouson.

THe saturday after mass they met again at the said place / and that day the
duke of Lancastre made the dinner for ye king of Portyngale and his company /
and there were chambres and halles hanged with arras and enbrowdery as rychely
as though they had been at London / and the Portyngales praised much the
English manner / and at that dinner there were three archebysshoppes and.vii.
bysshoppes sitting at the high table. The bishop of Lyxbone / the bishop of
Port / and the bishop of Connymbres / the archebysshop of Bargus and other /
and the king sat in ye mids of the table / and the duke a little bynethe
him / and bynethe the duke ye earl of Nauare and the earl of Angosse / and at
another table sat first the master Denyce / then the great master of saint
James in Portyngale and the pryour of saint Iohn^s / then Don galopes percler /
and John^ Ferrant his sone / the ponnayse of Congne and Vas Martyn of Congne /
ye Podych of Senede Vas Martyn of merle albarons / the abbot of the cabase of
Iuberoth / ye abbot of saint mary of Eure / sir Alue Perere marshall of
Portyngale / John^ Radygosdesar / and diverse other knights and squyers of
Portyngale / for there sat that day no Englysshmen / for all knights and
squyers of england served / and there were many mynstrelles and the duke gave
them a.C. nobles and the herauldes as much / after dinner when all things was
accomplysshed they took leave amyably each of other till another season / the
king returned to Port / and ye duke to Marga^se and took his way in to
Galyce / and the earl of Nauare conveyed the duke with a.C. speres till he was
out of all danger / and then ye earl took his leave and returned in to
Portyngale and the duke rode to saint James in Galyce.

Much desired the duches of Lancastre the return of ye duke her husband and
to here tidings what conclusyons were taken And so the duke was well welcomed
home as it was reason / and the duches demanded of him how he lyked the king
of Portyngale / by my faith said ye duke he is a gracyous man and is of body
and manners like to be a valiant man / and I think he shall reygne in great
puyssaunce / for he is well byloued of his me^ / they say they had no king
this.C. year that so well pleased them as he / and he is of age not past
a.xxxvi. year / he is a strong knight and a hardy according to the nature of
Portyngale / and he is well made of body to endure great pain ye but sir said
yt lady what says he to any ma marriage / I have agreed to him said the duke
that he shall have one of my daughters I did put him to the choice outher of
Katheryne or Phylyp / whereof he gave me great thank / how be it he rested on
Phylyp / he has good reason said ye duches / for my daughter Katheryne is yet
to young for him / thus the duke and the duches passed that day / and so ye
time passed / for winter approached / howbeit in ye countries of Galyce and
Portyngale there is but little winter for it is always hot / and graynes and
fruytes grows there quyckely / for there be diverse fruytes ripe in march /
benes / person and cheryes and al fresshe crbes grows in February / and in so
me place they make wine by mydsoner / and by yt time harvest is past.

ANd though yt the duke and ye duches tarried in the town of saint James and
lay still / yet his men styred abroad / and conquered in the country of
Galyce towns and castelles / and how they were won I shall show you ye
truth and the names of the^ / for I was justly thereof infourmed both by
knights and squyers as well of england as of Portyngale such as had been
present at all their conquestes and specially by ye gentyl knight of portyngale
/ or who I have spoken here before / who right amyably at Myddelbourge in
zelande as he came fro his voyage out of Pruce enfourmed me / I have here
before named the knight / and yet again I name him / his name was sir John^
Ferrant Partelere / so it was sir Thomas Moreaulx marshall of the duke of
Lancastres oost. when the duke was returned fro the fronters of Portyngale and
was come again to the town of saint James / he said he would not sy^te still
sith he was in the country of Conquest but said he would ride forth and set
his company a work / which they sore desired and so made his assemble and
said he would enter further in to Galyce to bring the towns and castelles
under the dukes obeysaunce. And so on a day he departed fro saint James with
a.vi.C speres / and.xii.C. archers / and took the way to a good town in Galyce
called Poceueyed / which was rebel against them / they of the town had
knowledge of ye englysshmennes coming for all the common people fled out of
their country in to the good towns. So they took counsel what they should
do outher yield or hold as long as they could endure / so they were not all
of one accord / the comen people would have yielded / but the baylyffe who was
(...) there by the king of Castle / and the rychemen would not yield so sone /
for they said they should norher have honor nor profit in their to doing /
so they were in cou^saylynge together when ye watch of ye town sowned and gave
knowledge of ye englysshmens approchyng / the^ they brake up their counsel
and every man went to his defense / and ran to ye walls and bare bars /
stones / darts / Iauelyns / and showed well how they would defend themself
and not yield so lightly.

WHen the dukes marshall and his company were come before the town of
Ponceuayde / they lyghted on sore and delivered their horses to their varlettes
/ and then divided their companyes to give assault / and the archers araynged
themself about the town with their bows ready to shote / and men of arms well
pauessed and armed entering in to ye dykes / then the marshalles trompettes
sowned to the sowte / and the men of arms then clame up the dykes with
pykeaxes and mattockes to win the walls / and the men of the town wtin cast
down stones and other things yt troubled the mynours sore and had done more
and the archers had not ben / but they shot so holy together that none durst
appear on the walls / and they did hurt many of them within and specially the
baylyffe of the town was stryke^ with an arowe that persed his basenet and
entered in to his heed so yt he was feign to be borne out of the place to his
lodging / yet ye evil people of ye town would not yield for all that the
baylyffe was sore hurt / but were ye rather more angry and more ready to
defend them / thus the saulte endured till it was night / then they sowned
their retrayte / there were men hurt on both parties / the englysshmen
rotourned fro the saulte and went to thery lodgings / and were of entency on
ye next morning to return to the saulte / and not to leave till they had
gotten it / the same night they of Ponce void took counsel together and said
among themself we are but folysshe people thus to be hurt and troubled for
nothing / why do we not as Vylodes and they of Coulongne has done they are
yielded to the duke of Lancastre / and to my lady Custaunce daughter to king
Don Peter let us yield like as other good towns have done / wherein they were
wise for thereby they sat in rest / well said other let us do in like wise /
but our baylyffe has counsayled us the contrary / therefore he has his payment
for he is lykely to dye / then some of them said / yet let us go to him and
here what he will say / for certainly to morrow the englysshmen will return
they will not let us be in peace they will outher have us perforce or by love.

TO that counsel they all agreed and a xii. of the best of the town went to
the baylyffes lodging whose name was Dyon table of Lion / and there they
found him on his bed newely dressed of his wound / and so he made to them
that came to him semblau^t of good chere whatsoever he felt and demanded the
of the assault / and how they perceyuered there in / then they answered and
said how they did well thanked be god / for except your hurt we have taken
but small damage / but to morrow lies our doubt / for we are sure to have a
new assault / and we be no me^ of defense we are but simple people and wot
not what it means / therefore we are come to have your counsel what is best
for us to do / ye Englysshmen sore threteneth us that if we be taken perforce
we shall be put to the sword and lose lives and all yt we have in the name of
god said the baylyffe / ye can have no^ blame though ye yield / but make a
wise treaty yt they be no rulers in your town / ye may say that ye will
gladly be under the obeysaunce of the duke of Lancastre and of the duches in
like manner as they of Coulongne be / so that no englysshmen come within ye
town / but to send them prouysyon out of the town for their money / thus do
if ye can / I thy^ke they will be glad of the obeysaunce / for they have many
moo towns to win in Galyce / wherefore I think they will the lyghtlyer go
house / ye say well syrsayd they / we shall do thus sith you counsel us to do
it / so they were / determined on this purpose / and so passed y^ night as well
as they might / and in ye morning at the sone rysynge they ordained certain
me^ to go out of the town instructed and charged what truce they should make
with the marshal if they could / there were.vii. of them and they came to the
marshall who was ready to return to the saulte / and kneled down salutynge
him and said / sir we be sent hyder to you fro them of the town of Ponce
void / who have commanded us to say in their names yt gladly they will put
themself under ye obeysaunce of the duke of Lancastre and of my lady the
duches in manner and form as they of Coulongne has done / and as for
prouysyon ye shall have enough out of the town payenge courteysly therefore /
and sir it is the entencyon of them that has sent us hyder / that ye should
not enforce the^ any further / nor you nor none other to enter in to the town
with any army / but if you and some of your company will enter symply / ye
shall be welcome. The marshall had an englysshman by him that understood the
speech of Galyce / he showed the marshall in English the words that they had
spoken. The marshall answered and said / syrs shortly return again to your
town and cause to come to the barryers such as sent you hyder to speak there
with me / I will give the^ assurau^ce this day / and to morrow the sone rysyng
without we be agreed / so they departed and went to their town and found at
the barryers the most part of them of the town / and there they made
relacyon of their message saying how incontinent the marshall would come to
ye barryers to speak with them / and if ye be not company ynowe send for such
mo as ye will have so then all the notablest men of ye town drew together /
then the marshall with a.xl. speres came thither and alyghted and came to ye
barryers and said thus.

YE syrs of Ponce void ye sent to us.vii. of your men / and I believe surely
ye did put your trust in them and they said how ye would gladly knowledge my
lord the duke and my lady for your soueraynes in manner and form as they of
Coulongne has done / but ye will not have none other governors but your self
within the town / I pray you what soueraynte should they have over you without
they had men set in the town under them else when ye will ye will be under
him and when ye list forsake him / surely it is mine entencyon and al my
company to ordeyne you a good capytayne true and wise to gouer you and to
mynystre true Justice / and to put out al officers set there by the king of
Castle and if ye will not do thus answer me / for we are determined what we
will do / then they desired a little to take counsel together / and so they
did and then said / sir we have good trust in you / but we doubt these pyllers
and robbers / for we have been sore beten with such people in time past / when
sir Bettram of Clesquy and the bretons came first in to this country / for
they lift us nothing / and therefore we fere / nay syrs fere not that said the
marshall / there shall no pyllers and robbers enter in to your town / nor ye
shall lose nothing by us / for we desire no thing but obeysaunce / and so
with those words they were accorded / then the marshall and certain of his
men entered in to the town and the oost abode without in tents and pauylyous /
and there was sent out of the town to the lords.iiii. summers laded with good
wine and as much bread / polayne great plenty / the marshal abode all yt day
in the town and set officers there for ye duke of Lancaster / and he made a
capytayne there a Galysyan who had always ben in England with ye lady
Custaunce with whom they of the town were well contented / and the next day
ye marshall returned to ye oost.

THe^ he determined to go to another town a.vi. miles thens in Galyce called
Dyghos and so rode forth thyderwarde / and when they were wtin.ii. miles they
sent a messagere to ye town to know whether they would rebel or else yield
the^ as they of Ponce void have done if not they should be saulted ye next
day they of Dyghos made no care for that message and said we care for none
assault we have be^ assailed or this time and lost nothing when that answer
was said to the marshall / he said / by saint George and they shall be fyersly
assailed are these vyllaynes so proud to give such an answer / so they
passed yt night and took their ease / the next morning at ye sone rysyng they
dyslodged / and so came before the town and lyghted a foot and set them in
order to go to the assault / and they within made them ready to defend them
and their town / this town was not great but it was strong / and I believe if
they had had any good me^ of war in their town the englysshmen had not so
soon have had the^ for as soon as they within the town saw how they were
assailed and felt the arrows of ye archers of England and saw how diverse
of the^ were sore hurt / for they were but evil harney sed / then they began
to be abashed and said / why do we suffer ourselfe thus to be slain and
hurt for the king of Castle / it were as good for us to have to our lord
the duke of Lancastre sith he has married the daughter of king Don peter / as
ye sone of king Henry / we know well if we be taken perforce / we shall all dye
/ and we se no comfort fro no part / it is more then a month sith we sent to
the king of Castle to Burgus in Spain / and there it was showed to his
counsel the peril that we were in / for we knew well the englysshmen would
come on us as they do / and the king then spoke to the knights of France /
who are of his special counsel but they gave him counsel to send no
garyson hyder nor to no part of Galyce / by semynge the king had as leave all
Galyce were lost as saved / he answered to our messagers / syrs return to
your town and do ye best you can for yourselfe / whereby we may well
understand that we need not to suffer ourselfe to be slain nor taken perforce
/ and therewith ye men of the town came to the gate and mounted up to a wyndowe
and made sign to speak and to treat / they were herd and the marshall came
thither and demanded what they would / they answered and said / sir marshall
cause your men to sease the assault / we would yield us to you in the name of
ye duke of Lancastre / and of my lady Custau^ce like manner as other towns in
Galyce have done and shall do / and if ye well have any prouysyon out of our
town / ye shall have right courteysly to refresshe you / but with an army
there shall none enter. This is the treaty that we will desire / the marshall
then answered and said / I am agreed to uphold all that ye demand / but I
will ordeyne you a good capytayne to defend you / and to counsel you in all
your busynes / then they answered and said well sir we are content therewith / so
the assault seized / and the marshall sir you Fythwaren / the lord ^albot /
sir John^ Aburnell / ye lord Popnynges / sir John^ Dambrychcourre and certain
other knights entered in to the town to refresshe them and there tarried all the
day and they yt were without had bread and wine and other vytayles enough out
of the town / thus after / ye taking of the town of Dyghos in Galyce and
that the lords were well refresshed / then the marshall set there a capytayne
asquyer of England called thomas Albery a sage man and a valiant and.xii.
archers with him / and then the marshall departed and entered in to the country
of Galyce costynge Spain and ye mountains of Castle to come to a great town
called Bayon in the Maroll / and when they were a ii. mile thens they lodged /
and ye next day in good a^aye they came nere to the town and then divided
them in two bataylles / and sent an he^aulte of arms to them of the town to
know what they would do / and whyder they would come to obeysaunce without
assaylynge or no The heraulte came to the barryers and there found a great
nombre of the vyllaynes evil harneysed and said to them in their language the
heraulte was of Portyngale and was called Connymbres syrs among you in this
town what thing think you to do / will ye be assailed or else yield you
and be under the obey ^aunce of my lord the duke of Lancastre and of my lady /
the marshall has sent me hyder to know what ye will do / then the men of ye
town drew to counsel and began to murmr and said one to another / what
shall we do yield ourselfe symply or defend us / then an ancient man who had
seen moo then many other said syrs it is nedeful to take short counsel ye
englysshmen do us great courtesy sith they suffer us to take counsel / ye se
well there appears none aid fro no part to comfort us / and also the king
of Castle knows well what case we stand in / and has done ever sith the
duke of Lancastre aryued first at Coulongne and he prouydeth nothing for us /
nor is not about to provide / if we suffer to be assailed it is of troth this
town is great in cyrcute and of small defense it will be hard for us to
attend to every place / the englysshmen are subtle in war and will do much
pain to win us in try^ of pyllage for they be covetous and so be all men of
war / and this town is reputed to be more rycher then it is in deed /
wherefore I would counsel you for ye best to put ourselfe and town under the
obeysaunce of the duke and of the duches / let us not be so rebel to cause our
self to be taken perforce sith we may come to peace by a mean / this is the
counsel that I give you / then all the other answered and said we will do thus
we believe you / for ye are a man in this town of great parage and may do
much. And we desire you to make the answer to ye heraulte with a good will
said he / but it were reason ye gave the heraulte a reward / he will do us the
more courtesye and report good of us to the lords that sent him hyder.

How they of Bayon yielded them to the duke of Lancastre / and how the marshall
of his host entered in to the town and took possessyon thereof. Ca. liii.
THen this au^cyent man came to the heraulte and said Sir return to your
masters that sent you hyder and say to them fro us that we will amyably put
us under the obeysaunce of my lord the duke of Lancastre and of my lady the
duches his wife in like manner and form as other towns in Galyce have done
and will do / and we / pray you to be our friend and we will give you.xx.
moryskes of gold / when ye heraulte herd him say so / he said where be ye
floreyns / there they did give them to him / and so he returned to his lords
/ then the marshal demanded of him what tidings / what say yonder vyllaynes
will they be assailed / nay truly sir said the heraulte they have no will
thereto but have said to me that ye should come thither / and they will amyably
receive you and put themself clearly under the obeysaunce of my lord the duke
and of my lady the duches as other towns have done / well said the marshall so
be it it is better for us this treaty then the saulte / at the leest our men
shall not be hurt. Then the marshall with all his company came to ye town and
lyghted on foot / and at the barryers he found much people of the town but
all their armure was not worth.x. frankes / there they were to see the
Engglysshmen / and there was the ancient man to make their treatye / as soon
as the heraulte saw him he said unto the duke. Sir speak unto yonder ancient
man who makes courtesye to you / for he has the auctoryte of the town in
his hands / then the marshall stepte forth and said / sir what say you what
will ye do / will ye yield you to my lord of Lancastre and to my lady as to
your sovereign lord and lady / ye sir said he we yield us to you in the name
of them and put this town under their obeysaunce as other towns in Galyce
have done / and if it please you to enter in to the town / ye shall be welcome
/ paynge for prouysyon if ye take any / well said the marshall it suffyseth / we
will nothing but obeysaunce and love of the country / but ye shall swear yt if
the king of Castle come hyderor send hyder yt ye keep you against hy^ and his
alyes then they answered and said / sir we will swear it with good will / and if
he come hyder with puyssaunce or send we shall close our town against him / and
send you word thereof / and if be stronger than he we will abide still under
you / for ye shall find in us no manner offrawde. That is enough said the
marshal / I ask no better / or it be a year to an end the matter shall be
determined / for the heritage and crown of Castle of Spain / of Cordewayne /
of Galyce / and of Syuyll shall abide with him that is strongest for there shall
be seen in these countries or the end of August many deeds of arms done / and
as great an army appear in Castle as has been seen there this.C. year past /
well said the ancient man / let it be as it will be / and let the right go to
the right / we in this country of Galyce dare well abide the adventure / then
ye rebels were brought forth and they of the town swear to govern their
town well and truly as subjects should do to their sovereign lord and lady
/ and to knowledge the duke of Lancastre and his wife for their lord and lady
as other towns in Galyce had done / and ye marshall in their names received
their oaths and swear again to keep and maynteyne them in peace and good
justice.

ANd when all this matter was done sworn and promise then they opened their
gates and barryers and every man entered who would and lodged all abroad in the
town and were the re a.iiii. days to refresshe them and their horses and to
abide for a fair season / for in.iiii. days before in never seized raynynge.
wherefore they were loath to depart / for ye ryuers were waxed so great yt no
man could pass without great danger / and also in that season they aduysed
themself whyder they would go to Bezanses or to Rybadane another strong town
wherein were the most prowdest people and most traitors of al ye country of
Galyce / and on the first day ye marshal departed fro ye town of Bayon in
Marol / and when they were in the feldes they found ye ryuers withdrawn
whereof they were right joyful / then they rode forth toward Rybadane and had
with them great caryage and much prouysyon and rode all in peace / there were
none yt stopped them of their way / for there were no lords of Galyce yt
styred / so they rode till they came nereto the town / and then lodged them
under ye olyues in a fair plain within half a leg of the town / and there
determined to send their heraulte to speak with them of Rybadane / ye marshall
had well herd how they were the falsest people and of the merueylest
condycyons yt were in all the royalme / as great a royalme as it was / for they
did never set by ye king nor no man else / but held alonely of the^ self /
for their town was strong / so ye heraulte was sent to them to know their
entencyons. And when he came thither / the barryers were closed and the gate
also / then he began to call and to knock / but no man would answer him /
yet he saw men go up and down on the garettes of the gate and walls / but
for nothing that he could do / there was no creature would speak one word to
him so there he stood calling and making of signs more then an hour / then
he said to himself / when he saw he could have there nothing else / I
trow these men of Rybadane have spoken with them of Bayon and are dyspleased
that they gave me xx. floreynes and did so little therefore / now they will
make me bye it dear / I fere they would have me tarry here till it were late /
and then take and hang me / and so therewith returned to the marshall who
demanded what tidings whyder they would be assailed or yield as other towns
had done / sir said the heraulte / surely I can not tell they be so proud that
for any cryenge and calling yt I could make / there was none yt would give me
any answer / then sir John^ Abaurell said / saw thou no person there /
peradventure they be fled away for fere of us / fled away said ye heraulte /
sir saving your grace they think scorn thereof / for or ye have that town
they will put you to more pain then all the other towns in Galyce / sir know
for truth therein be men ynowe / for I saw great nombre of the^ / and called
to the^ on high and said / syrs I am an heraulte sent to speak with you /
therefore here me / but they held their peace and looked on me and laughed. A
said ye marshall the false vyllaynes shall well be chastysed / for I will not
depart thens till I have brought them to obeysaunce with out my lord the duke
of Lancastre communde me the contrary / let us ete and drink and then go to
the assault / for I will se them a little nerer sith ye vyllaynes be so proud
/ and it was done as ye marshall ordained.

ANd when they had eten and dronken they lepte on their horses and sown^ted
their trompettes making great noyes / and within a while they came before the
town / and some knights and squyers ran before the barryers but there they
found no body / but over ye gate there were many cross bows and they began
to shote and did hurt diverse horses / then the english archers araynged them
before ye barryers and on ye dykes and began to shote against the cross bows
/ so there was a sore assault which long endured / true it is the town of
Rybadane is right strong it could not be won on ye one side / for it
stands on a rock so yt no man can mount thereto / on the other side where ye
saulte co^tynued was plain ground / but there were great dykes dry without
any water / but they were evil to mount upon knights and squyers auayled
down and then began to mount again with targes and pauaises over their
heedes for defense of stones that were cast down / and the archers were
raynged alonge on the dykes who shot so holy together that the defendauntes
durst not appear abroad / that day there was a great assault and diverse hurt
both within and without / and at night they sowned the retrayte / Then the
saulte seized and the englysshmen drew to their lodgings and took their case
and dressed them that were hurt / and the same day Thyrty of Sonnayne was
stryken with a quarrel in the arm so yt in a month after he could not aid
himself with yt arm but bare it in a towell.

Hoowe the duke of Lancastre and the Duches held them at saint James in Galyce
/ and of the comfort that the frensshe knights gave unto the king of
Castle. Ca. lii.
THe same season yt the duke of Laucastres marshal rode abroad in ye country
of Galyce and made ye country to turn to ye obeysaunce of ye duke and duches
who lay at the town of compostella otherwise called saint James in galyce /
often times they herd tidings fro ye king of Portyngale / and ye king fro
them / for they sent and wrote each to other wekely / and on the other party
king John^ of Castle lay that season at Valeolyue and ye knights of france
with him with whom he spoke often times of his busynes and demanded of them
counsel and sometime he said to the^. Syrs I have great marvel yt there
comes no more aid to me out of france / for I lose my country and am like
to lose without I find some other remedy / the englysshmen keeps ye feldes
and I know well that the duke of Lancastre and the king of Portyngale have been together / and mine adversary the king of Portyngale shall have in marriage
one of ye dukes daughters / and as soon as they be wedded / ye shall se both
their puyssaunces join together and enter in to my royalme and so give me to
much to do. Then the frensshe knights answered to comfort the king and said
sir take no thought therefore / for if the englysshmen wyn on ye one side they
lose on ye other / for we know surely that the frensshe king with mo then a.
C.M. men of war is as now in the royalme of England and dystroyeth and
conquereth the country / and when they have done and brought al England in
subieccyon / then ye frensshe king will take again ye se / and or somer be
past aryue at coulogne in galyce and wyn again more in a month then ye have
lost in a hole year / and the duke of Lancastre shall so be enclosed yt he shall
be feign to fle in to portyngale and so ye shall take vengeance of your enemies
/ for sir know surely yt if the busynes offrau^ce had not ben so great as it is
for the voyage in to england ye should have had here or this.iii. or.iiii.M.
speres of frensshmen / for ye frensshe king his uncles and counsel have
great affection to comfort and aid you to bring your wars to an end sir
care not though ye englysshmen now keep ye feldes and wyn a little of your
country. Surely sir or it be ye feast of saint John^ baptyst they shall al be
driven away / ye king took these worcester for good / and took comfort in the^ / and
ye frensshe knights said nothing but as they thought was true for they reputed
surely as then ye frensshe king to be aryued in England / and so it was
brewted in all Spain / Galyce / and Portyngale / and surely the fourth part
of the tidings yt the englysshmen herd of pilgrims and merchauntes coming
fro flaunders was not showed to the duke of Lancastre / and also the king of
Portyngale for all that he wrote often times to the duke / yet he somewhat
dyssymuled and was not over hasty to send for the lady Phylyp to be his wife /
for his counsel said to him / sir surely there is tidings come out of
France and out of flaunders yt the royalme of England is in a great adventure
to be dystroyed / and if yt be so what should it avail you the comfort of the
duke of Lancastre or to wedde his daughter / it should nothing avail you /
wherefore covertly he delayed his busynes to the entente to se the end of yt
matter / howbeit by letters and messagers he retained still the duke in love
and favor. Now let us leave a season to speak of the busynesses of Castle
and Portyngale / and let us treat of the matters of france.

Of the great apparel of ships and galeys that the frensshmen made on the sea to pass in to England. Ca. liii.
THe apparel of ships galeys and vessels that ye frensshe king made to
pass in to England was so great and sumptuous yt the eldest man tha^ living
never saw nor herd of the like / ye knights and squyers reioysed when they
departed fro their houses to go with the frensshe king in to England and said /
now let us go on these cursed Englysshmen / who have / done so many euylles
and persecucyons in france / now shall we be revenged for our faders
brethren and kynsmen whom they have slain and dyscomfyted / surely it was
more then.xii. wekes a doing / the pourueynge of such prouysyons as the
frensshe lords made / it was so great that it was marvel to consider it /
and it was said in all flaunders / the king comes to morrow and also men came
thither out of Gascoyne / armynacke / Comynges / Tholowsyn / and fro all the
lymyttes of france / and all came and lodged in flaunders and Artoys / and
when it came to the mids of August and that ye voyage should approach / and
to the entente to make them of far countries to make ye more have and to give
ensample yt the king took his voyage with great desire / the king took his leave
of ye queen his wife / and of queen Blaunche and of ye duches of Orlyaunce /
and of ye other ladies of france and herd mass solemply in our Ladies
church in Paris / and his entencyon was never to return again to Paris till
he had been first in England / so the king rode to Senlyse / but al yt season
the duke of Berrey was still in his country of Berre / howbeit prouysyon was
made in Flaunders and at sluse for him as it was done for other / also ye duke
of Borgoyne was in his country / and so then he took leave of the duches and of
his children / and determined to take his leave of his great aunte the duches of
Brabant / so he departed out of Borgoyne and rode in great estate and the
admyrall of france in his company and sir Guy of Tremoyle / and so they came
to Bruzelles / and there found the duches and other ladies who received him with
great honor / and.ii. days he tarried there with them / and then took his leave
and fro thens he rode to Mons in Heynalte and there he found his daughter ye
lady of Ostrenant / and duke Aubert and his sone sir wyllyam of Heynalte earl
of Oftrenant / who received the duke with great joy / and so brought him to
Valencennes / and the duke was lodged in the earls palace and duke Aubert in
the lodging of Vycongnet and the lady of Ostrenant / and fro thens ye duke
rode to Doway / and so to Arras / and there he found the duches his wife
taryenge for him. Then the frensshe king came to Compaygne and so to Noyon /
and fro thens to Perone / and to Bapalmes / and so to Arras / and daily there
came down people fro all parts so great nombre that ye country was clean
eten up / nothing was left abroad in the country but it was taken without
payenge of any thing / so yt the poor common people that had gadered together
their corns had nothing left them but straw / and if they spoke thereof they
were beten or slain / their waters were fysshed / their houses beten down for
fire wood / if the englysshemen had aryued in the country / they could not
nor would not have done so great dystruccyon nor hurt then the frensshmen
themself did / and they said to the poor men / syrs we have as now no silver
to pay but when we return we shall have enough / and then ye shall be clearly
paid / but the poor people when they saw their goods taken and spente away /
and durst not speak theragaynst / they cursed between their tethe saying / go
in to England or to the devil and never return again.

How the frensshe king and his uncles aryued at Sluse in flaunders. Ca. liiii.
THe frensshe king came to Lysle in flaunders and his two uncles with him ye
duke of Borgoyne and the duke of Borbon / for as the^ the duke of Berrey was
behind in his own country and ordained for his busynes and with ye king at
Lysle there was the duke of Bare / the duke of Lorayne / the earl of Armynacke
/ the earl of Sauoy / the earl Dalphyn of Awuergne / the earl of Geneue / the
earl of saint Poule / the earl of Ewe / ye earl of Longueuyle and other great
lords of France in such nombre that I can never name them all / it was said
there should pass in to England.xx.M. knights and squyers which to say
troth is a fair company / and also.xx.M. cross bows with the Geneways and
beside them other.xx.M. of other men of war / and as then sir Olyuer Clysson
was in Bretayne and ordained therefore his busynes and nauye and should bring
with him ye closure of the field made of tymbre / which they ordained to be
set up every night when they were ones in England / and with sir Olyuer
Clysson constable of France should come out of Bretayne the best knights and
squyers therein / as the vycount of Rohan / ye lord or Rays / the lord of
Beawmanoyre / ye lord de la Vale the lord of Rochforte / the lord of
Malestroyt sir John^ of Malestroyte / and a.v.C. speres Brerons chosen men of
war / for it was the constables entencyon that no man should enter in to
england without he were a man of arms chosen / and he gave charge to the
admyral sayng take heed ye charge not our ships with varlettes and boys /
for they shall do us more damage then profit / so that.ii. or.iii. knights
without they were great masters / though they hired ships for their money /
yet they should have but one horse over and one varlet to say truth they
ordained al their busynesses in good order / and it was the opinion of diverse
that if they might aryue all together in England where as they intended to
land / and that was at Orwell haven / how they should sore abasshe the
country and so they should without doubt for the great lords spyrytuall and
temporal and the people of the good towns were in great doubt / but the
commons and poor companyons cared nothing therefore / no more did pore knights
and squyers / for they desired the war outher to win or to lose all / and
they said one to another / god has sent to us a good season sith the frensshe
king will come in to this country / he is a valiant king we think this.CCC.
year passed there was not in france a king of yt courage as he is of / he
makes his men good me^ of war / blessed may he be sith he will come to
vysyte us for now we shall dye / or else be rich it can be none otherwise.

How the frensshe king tarried at Sluse with his great oost to the entente to
enter in to England. Ca. iv.
IF the apparel for this voyage was great and sumptuous in Flaunders and at
Sluse / in likewise was it in England I have showed you somewhat thereof / here
before / wherefore I pass it over breuely / if the taxes and tallages were
great in france in likewise they were in england / so that many a man sorowed
long after / but because the commons saw it was needful said / it is not
against reason though we be taxed now and to give of our goods to knights
and squyers to defend their herytages and ours. There was raised the same time
in England for the defense of the country more then.ii. mylyons of floreyns /
and receyuours thereof were the archebysshop of york brother to the lord Neuell
/ the earl of Oxenforde / sir Nycholas Branbre / sir Myghell Polle / sir Simon
Burle / sir Peter Gauloufer / sir Robert Tryuylyen / sir John^ Beauchamp / Sir
John^ Salysbury and other of the kings pryuy counsel / as for the kings
uncles there was nothing done by them / nor they would not meddle therewith nor
bring the royalme in trouble but they took good head to maynteyne the honor
of ye royalme / and to keep ye passages and ports for they byleued surely to
have y^ same year / ye frensshe king with his puyssau^ce to aryue in England /
so these said lords and knights received the taxes and did what they list /
and the chief of them and he that had most profit was ye earl of oxenforde /
for by him every thing was done / and without him nothing done so that after
when their busynesses were passed the people made trouble to know where ye
money became / and some of the cytees and good towns of England would have
accomptes thereof / with ye aid of the kings uncles as ye shall here after when
time shall be to speak thereof / for it shall not be forgotten out of the
hystory.

How sir Simon Burle would have had by his counsel saint Thomas of
Cauntorburyes shryne removed to the castle of Dover / whereby he acheued great
hate. Ca. lv.
SIr Simon Burle was capytayne of the castle of Dover / and he herd often
times news out of Calays by the fysshers / for they kept still their custom
of fysshynge. Sometime before Boloyne and before the port of Whytsande and when
other frensshe fysshers met with them they would tell each other tidings
sometime more then they knew / for the fysshers of the sea what so ever war
was between England and France / they did no hurt one to another / but were
as friends aydynge each other and bought and sold each with other fysshe if
one sped better then another for if they should have made war one with another /
there durst none have gone a fysshynge without conduyte of men of war / thus
sir Simon Burle understood by ye fysshers that surely the frensshe king would
pass over in to England and take landyng at Dover and at Sandwytche / sir
Simon byleued well those words and thought it was true and so did all england
/ so on a day he came to Cauntorbury and went to the abbaye / and there they
demanded of him tidings / and he showed as much as he knew / and by his
words he showed that saint Thomas shryne which is goodly and rich was not
there in surety because the town was not strong / and he said that if the
frensshemen should come thither which by all lykelyhode they would do / for
Couetyse of winning the robbers and pyllers would rob that town and abbey
church and all / and they will carry away with them the shryne if they find
it here / wherefore I would counsel and advise you to carry it to ye castle of
Dover there it shall be in suretye though al england were lost / then the
abbot and all the covent took his counsel / though he meant well in great
dyspyte and dyspleasure / saying sir Simon will ye depose our church fro our
sygnory / yt ye be afraid make yourselfe sure / for though ye close yourselfe
with in ye castle of Dover forfere / yet the frensshmen shall not be so hardy
to come hyder to us / and so Simon Burle multyplyed so much inwardes in
maynteynynge his request ye the commons of the country were sore displeased
with him and reputed him not profitable for yt country / and right well they
showed after their dyspleasure as ye shall here in the story / So sir Simon
Burley went to Dover again.

THe frensshe king came to Lysle to show that ye journey pleased him / and to
approach the sooner to his passage / so the king approached / and it was said in
Flaunders and in Actoys / they shall take shyppyng outher on Satterday / monday
/ or tuysday / so that in every day in y^ weke it was said he should depart to
morrow or ye next day after / and his brother the duke of Tourayne / and the
bishop of Beawuoys chancellor of France and diverse other great lords took
their leave of ye king at Lysl and they returned to Paris / and it was showed
me how the king had given the gouernyng of the royalme to his brother the duke
of Tourayne till his return again / with the aid of diverse other lords of
France such as were not ordained to go in to England as ye earl of Bloys and
other / and yet all the season ye duke of Berry was behind and came but fair
and easily / for he had no great appetyte to go in to England / and his long
taryeng was dyspleasau^t to the king and to the duke of Burgoyne and to the
other lords / they would gladly he had been come / still great prouysyon was
made which was costly and dear a thing not worth a frank was sold for.iiii.
howebeit for all that money was not spared / for every man desired to be well
stuffed of every thing / in manner of envy every man to be better appointed
then other and though the great lords were well paid their wages other poor
companyons bought the bergayne / for they were owing for a months wages /
and yet could get nothing / the treasourer of the wars and clerks of ye
chamber of accomptes said / syrs abide till the next weke and then ye shall be
paid / and so they were answered wekely / and if any payment were made to
them / it was but for.viii. days / and were owing.viii. wekes / so that some
when they saw the manner of dealing and how they were so evil paid / they
were sore dyspleased and said / surely this voyage shall be but of small
effect / for by all lykelyhode when the money is gadered of ye taxes / then
they will break this journey and return home again in to their own countries
/ such as did cast such doubts and provided thereafter were wise but the
poor knights and companyons such as were re^eyned by ye great lords spente
all that they had / every thing was so dear in Flaunders / that hard it was
to get outher bread or drink / or if they would sell their wages or armure
there was no money to get / and if any were bought it was dear / there was so
much people about Dan / Bruges / and Ardenbrughe / and specially at Sluse /
for when the king came thither they wist not where to lodge / the earl of saint
Poule the lord of Concy / the dolphyn of Auuergne / the lord Dantoygne / and
diverse other lords of france to lie more at their case lodging at Bruges /
and sometime went to Sluse to the king to know when they should depart and
ever it was said to them within.iii. or.iiii. days / or when the duke of
Berrey is come and yt we have wind to strue us / so ever the time passed and
the day shortened and began to be foul and cold and the nyghtes long /
wherewith diverse of the lords were not content to tarry so long / and also
their prouysyons mynysshed.

How the king of Armony passed in to England in trust to find some mean of
peace or good appointment between the king of England and the king of France.
Ca. lvi.
THus in abiding for the duke of Berrey and for the constable who were behind
then king Lion of Armony who was in france and had assygned him by ye
king.vi.M. frankes by ye year to maynteyne his estate / he took on him for a
good entente to go in to England to speak with the king there and his
counsel to se if he might find any manner of peace to be had between the two
royalmes of England and france and so he departed fro his lodging of saint
Albeyne beside saint Denyee alonely with his own company and with no great
apparel So he rode to Boloyne / and there he took a ship and so sailed forth
till he came to Dover and there he found the earl of Cambrydge and the earl of
Buckyngham and mo then a.C. me^ of arms and a.ii.M. archers who lay there to
keep that passage / for the brute ran that ye frensshmen should land there
or at Sandwyche / and the king lay at London and part of his counsel with
him / and daily herd tidings fro all the ports of England / when the king
of Armony was aryued at Dover he had there good chere because he was a
stranger / and so he came to the kings uncles there who swetely received him
/ and at time conuenyent they demanded of him fro whens he came and whether he
would / the king answered and said that in trust of goodness he was come thither
to se the king of England and his counsel to treat for peace between
england and France for he said that he thought the war was not mete / for
he said by reason of war between these.ii. royalmes / which has endured so
long / the sarazyns / Jews / and turks are waxed proud / for there is none
that makes them any war / and by occasyon thereof I have lost my land and
royalme / and am not like to recover it again without there were ferme peace in
all crystendome / and I would gladly show the matter that touches all
crystendome to the king of England and to his counsel / as I have done to
the frensshe king then the kings uncles demanded of him if the frensshe king
had sent him thither or no he answered and said / nay / there is no man yt
sent me / but I am come hyder by mine own mocyon to se if the king of
england and his counsel would any thing lean to any treatye of peace / then
he was demanded where the frensshe king was / he answered I believe he be at
Sluse I saw him not sith I took leave of him at Senlyze / then he was demanded
how he could make any treatye of peace and had no charge so to do / and sir if
ye be conuayed to the king our nephewe and to his counsel / and the frensshe
king in the mean season enter with his puyssannce in to England ye may
happen thereby to receive great blame and your person to be in great ieoperdy
with them of the country / then the king answered and said I am in suretye of
the frensshe king for I have sent to him desiring that till I return
again / not to remove fro Sluse / and I repute him so noble and so well
aduysed yt he will grant my desire and that he will not enter in to the sea
till I be come again to him Wherefore syrs I pray you in the instaunce of love
and yeas / to convey me to speak with the king / for I desire gretely to se
him / or else ye that be his uncles if ye have auctoryte to give me answer to
all my demaundes / then the earl of Buckyngham said / sir king of Armony we be
ordained here to keep and defend this passage and the fronters of England by
the king and his counsel / and we have no charge to meddle any further with
the busynes of ye royalme without we be otherwise commanded by the king / but
sith ye be come for a good entente in to this country ye be right welcome /
but sir as for any ferme answer ye can have none of us / for as now we be not
of the counsel / but we shall convey you to the king without peril or damage
/ the king thanked them and said / I desire nothing else but to se the king
and to speak with him.

How the king of Amony returned out of England and of the answer that was
made to him. Ca. lvii.
WHen the king of Armony was refresshed at Dover a day and had spoken with the
kings uncles at good leisure / then he departed toward London with a good
conduyte that the lords appointed to him for fere of any rencountres / so
long he rode that he came to London / and in his riding thrughe London he was
well regarded because he was a stranger / and he had good chere made him and
so was brought to the king who lay in the ryall at the queen's warderobe and
his counsel were in London at their lodgings / the Londonners were fore
fortefyenge of their cite / When the coming of the king of Armony was known
/ the kings counsel drew to the king to here what tidings the king brought
in that troublous season / when the king of Armony was come in to the kings
presence he made his salutacyon and then began his process on the state how
he was come out of France pryncypally to se the king of England whom he had
never seen before and said how he was right joyous to be in his presence
trusting that some goodness should come thereby / and there he showed by his
words that to withstand the great pestylence yt was lykely to be in england
therefore he was come of his own good will to do some good therein if he might /
not sent fro the frensshe king willing to set some accord and peace between
ye.ii. royalmes england and france / many fair plesaunt words the king of
Armony spoke to yt king of England and to his counsel / then he was shortly
answered thus / sir king ye be welcome in to this royalme / for the king our
sovereign lord and all we are glad to se you here / but sir we say yt the
king has not here all his counsel / but shortly they shall be here / and
then ye shall be answered / the king of Armony was content therewith and so
returned to his lodging / with in.iiii. days after the king was counsayled /
and I think he had sent to his uncles to know their ententes / but they were
not present at the answer gyuynge / to go to the palace of Westmynstre and his
counsel with him such as were about him / and to send for the king of
Armony to come thither / and when he was come in to the presence of the king of
England and his counsel / the king sat down and the king of Armony by
him / and then the prelates and other of his counsel / there ye king of
Armony rehearsed again his requeites yt he made / and also showed wisely how
all cryste^dome was sore decayed and feblysshed by occasyon of the wars
between England and France / and how that all the knights and squyers of
both royalmes intended to nothing else but always to be on ye one part or
of ye other Whereby the empire of Constantynoble leseth and is like to lose /
for before this war ye knights and squyers were wont to adventure themself
/ and also the king of Armony showed yt by occasyon of this war he had lost
his royalme of Armony / wherefore he desired for gods sake that there might be
some treatye of peace had between the.ii. royalmes of England and France. To
these words answered the archebysshop of Cauntorbury for he had charge so to
do / and he said / sir king of Armony it is not the manner nor never was seen
between.ii. such enemies as the king of England and the Frensshe king yt
the king my sovereign lord should be required of peace / and to enter his
lands with a puyssaunt army / Wherefore sir we say to you yt if it please you
ye may return to the Frensshe king / and cause him and all his puyssaunce
to return back in to their own countries / and when every man is at home /
then if it please you ye may return again hyder / and then we shall gladly
entende to your treatye. This was all the answer the king of Armony could
get there / and so he dyned with the king of England and had as great
honor as could be devised / and the king offered him many great gifts of
gold and silver / but he would take noone though he had need thereof but
alonely a ring to the value of a.C. frankes. After dinner he took his leave and
returned unto his lodging / and the next day departed / and was in two
days at Dover / and there took his leave of such lords as were there / and so
took the sea in a passagere and aryued at Calays / and fro thens went to Sluse
/ and there he spoke with the frensshe king / and with his uncles / and showed
them how he had been in England and what answer he had. The frensshe king
and his uncles took no regard to his saying / but sent him again back in
to france / for their full entencyon was to enter in to England as soon as
they might have wind and wether / And the duke of Berre and the constable came
to them / the wind was sore contrary to them for therewith they could never
enter in to England / but the wind was good to goo in to Scotland.

How the duke of Berre departed from Paris to come to Sluse / and how the
constable of France took the sea / and of the wind that was contrary to him.
Ca. lviii
THus the duke of Berre herd mass in our Lady church in Paris / and there
took his leave / and said how he would never enter there again till he had been in England / howbeit for all his words he thought the contrary / for he
had no desire thereto / for the winter season was sore come on and all the way
as he came he had letters fro the king and fro the duke of Borgoyne in
hastynge of him / certefyenge him how they tarried for no thing else but for
his coming. So the duke of Berre rode always forward / but it was but by
small iourneys. And the constable of France departed fro the cite of
Lentryngyet standing on the sea side in Bretayne / with great nombre of men of
arms and prouyson / he had a.lxxii. ships / and with him he had the
closure of the field made of tymbre / the constable and his company had good
wind at the beginning but when they approached nere to England / the wind
rose fyerse and great / and at the enter of margate at Tames mouth / the wind
was so great that whether they would or not their ships departed so
that.xx. abode not together / and some were driven perforce into Tames / and
there were taken by the englyssh men / and specially there was taken.iii. or.
iiii ships laden with part of the closure of tymbre ordained to close in the
field / and certain masters carpenters and artficers with them and so they
were brought to London / whereof the king had great joy / and so had all the
Londonners / and.vii. of the constables ships were driven with the wind with
all the prouysyon and taken in zelande / and the constable and other lords
with great pain came to Sluse to the frensshe king.

OF the constables coming and his company the frensshe king was right joyful
/ and the king said to him. Sir constable when shall we depart / certainly we
have great desire to se England / wherefore I pray you auaunce forth all our
busynes in hasty manner / and let us enter in to the sea shortly / mine uncle
the duke of Berre will be here with us within these two days / he is at Lysle.
Sir said the constable we can not depart till the wind serve us / for ye
wind is so sore against us and so straynable that the maryners say they have
herd none such of a great season before / Constable said the king I have been
in my vessel and it pleases me gretely the air of the sea / I believe I shall
be a good maryner / for the sea did me no hurt / in the name of god said the
constable / it has done hurt to me / for sir we were in great peril coming
fro Brytayne hyder / the king demanded hywe so / Then the constable said /
by fortune of the sea and great wyndes that rose against us in the fronters of
England / and sir we have lost of our ships and men whereof I am right sorry
if I might amend it / but sir it is without remedy for this time. Thus the
king and the Constable devised together in words / and always the time passed
/ and the winter approached / and the lords lay there in great cold and
peril.

THe flemynges gladly would not have had them return again thrughe their
country and they said one to another / why the devil does not the frensshe
king pass over in to England / why taryeth he so long in this country /
are we not in pouertye enough though the frensshe men make us no poorer / we
think they will not pass in to England this year / for the royalme of
England is not so easy to be won / englysshme^ be not of the condycyon of
frensshemen / what will they do in England / when ye englysshme^ were in
France and over rode their countries / the^ they hyd themself in their
fortresses and fled before them as the lark does before ye hawke and in the
town of Bruges where as most resort was of the frensshmen they murmured and
were ready for waggyng of a rysshe to make debate and strife / and al began by
the frensshe lakeys / who had beten and hurt some of the flemynges / so that
if the honest men of the town had not armed them and drawn in to the market
place to appease the riot / there had not a lord knight nor squire of France
have escaped vnslayne / for the common people of the town bare a grudge in their
minds for the battle of Rosebeque where their faders br^ther ne and friends
were slain by the frensshmen god sent thither at that time for the frensshmen
the lord of Guystell who as then was at Bruges / when he understood how ye
commons went to harneys / he fered all should be lost without remedy / howbeit
he lepte on his horse with v. or.vi. with him and rode into the streets / and as
he met with any armed going to the marget place ward he said to them / syrs
whether goo you / will you lose yourselfe / have ye not had war youghe / so
that ye have much a do to get your living / return in to your houses there
is nothing to do / ye may put yourselfe and your town in such ieoperdy that
all shall be lost / do you not know how the frenssh king and all his
puyssaunce and army is here in this country / so with fair words he
appeased them and caused them to return in to their houses / which had
not so lightly have been done / if he had not ben there / the frensshmen there
were in such fere that they closed themself in their lodgings there to abide
their adventure.

How the voyage in to England was broken by reason of the wyndes and of
winter and by counsel of the duke of Berre. Ca. lix.
SO finally the duke of Berre came to Sluse to the king / and the king said
to him / a fair uncle how gretely I have desired to se you / why have you
tarried so long we had been as now in England and fought with our enemies if ye
had been come / the duke began to smyle and to exscuse himself / and showed not
incontinent what lay in his heart / first he thought he would se what
prouysyon and ordenaunce was made. and to se the nauey that was named so goodly
So they were there a.vii. days that every day it was said we shall depart
to morrow / howbeit surely the wind was so contrary that in no wise they
could sail in to England / winter was well on / it was past saint Andrews
tide / it was no good season for so many noble men to take the sea / and many
of their ships were ready crossed in a redynes to depart / some were in their
ships to be the foremost should pass / as sir Robert / and sir Phylyp Artoys
/ sir Henry of bare / sir Peter of Nauare and diverse other. Then the kings
cou^tayle drew together to se how they should perceyuer in their journey / but
the duke of Berre brake all and showed so many reasons reasonable that such as
had most desire to goo were gretely dyscouraged / he said it was a great folly
to counsel the frensshe king who in a manner was but a child to take the sea
in that season of the year / and to go fight with such people as we know not
their condycyon / nor the way thither / and as it is said it is an evil
country to make war in / for though we were al there a land yet they would
not fight with us but when they list / and we dare not then leave our prouysyon
behind us / for if we do it will be lost / and they that will make such a
voyage so far of has need to begin in the heart of ye year and not in winter
/ call all the maryners together and look if they will not say that my words be
good / for though we be as now a thousand and.v. hundred ships / yet or we
come there we shall not be.iii. hundred / then be hold what peril we should
put ourselfe in / I say it not because I would have the journey left / but I
speak it by way of counsel / and sith that the most part of the royalme
enclyneth to this journey / therefore fair brother of Borgoyne I would that you
and I should go but I would not counsel that the king should goo for if any
mysfortune should fall it shall be laid to us / well said ye frensshe king who
was present at all those words / if none will go I will go. Then the lords
began to smyle and said / the king has a couragyous will / Howbeit they took
counsel to defer that voyage till Aprell or May next after / and their
prouysyons as Bysquet / powdered flesh / and wine should be kept saufely till
then / and there they ordained that the lords and their companyes should
return thither again in the month of March / anon this was known / and so
brake the voyage for that season / ye whicost the royalme of France a.C.M.
frankes xxx. time told.

How king Charles of france and the frensshe lords returned evil content
fro Sluse and out of Flaunders where as their prouysyons were made / to have
gone in to the royalme of England / and of the feast that was made at London.
Ca. lx.
AS ye have herd before / there was made a great apparel in France by the
king there / and the lords with great cost and charge with ships and
galayes to pass the sea in to england to make war there. And how this
voyage was broken by wether / and because yt winter was so nere hand. Then it
was ordained by the counsel that the king and the lords should return
every man to his own home / and every thing to abide in the same state unto
the month of March or Aprell / and then every man to be ready at the kings
commandment.

THen there might well have been seen lords and knights soore dyspleased And
specially such as were of far countries and had sore trauayled their bodies
and spente their money in trust to have had a good season / as the earl of
Sauoy / the earl of Army^ake / and the earl Daulphyn of Awuergne and a C. other
great lords that departed in great dyspleasure because they had not ben in
England / in likewise so did the frensshe king but as then he could not
amend it. So thus departed all manner of people / some merry and some gretely
dyspleased and angry / and the officers abode still there behind / for too
make shyfte to sell their prouysyons for their masters profit and to take
money for them if they might / but they wist not to whom nor where / for it
that cost a hundred frankes was sold for.x. frankes and for less money. The
earl Dalphyn of Awuergne said unto me that by his faith he had there
prouysyons the which cost him ten thousand frankes / and when he returned
homewarde again he lost all together / and so said many knights and squyers
and other people of France. And when these tidings were known in the royme
of England / some were right joyful and glad thereof as such people that
doubted the Frensshe men's coming. And some were angry and dyspleased
therewith / which was such people as thought to have some promocyon and
profit by them.

SO then there was made at the cite of London a great feast / and thither
came all the lords such as had kept the ports and passages of the royalme
of England. And then the king held also a noble feast at westmynstre on
Crystmasse day And there were three dukes made. First the earl of Cambrydge was
made the duke of york. The earl of Buckyngham his brother was made duke of
Glocestre. And the third was the earl of Oxenforde and he was made the d^ of
Irelande / This feast endured with great reuelles and tryumphes. So thus the
people of the royalme of England (as they thought themself) that they had
escaped a great peril / and then diverse of them said among themself that
they would never set more by the Frensshe men / and they thought that all the
assemble of the Frensshe men that was made at Sluse was but to fere the
English men / and to have caused the duke of Lancastre and his company to
return again out of Spain.

How a squire called Jacques le Grys was accused in the parlyament house at
Paris before all the lords there present / by a knight called John^ of
Carongne / and what Judgment was given upon them / and how they Iusted at
vtteraunce in Paris / in a place called saint Katheryne behind the temple. And
how Jacques le Grys was confounded. Ca. lxi.
IN this time great brute there was in france and in the low marches of a
feate of arms that should be done at Paris in vtteraunce / for so the matter
was Judged in the parlyament chamber at Paris. The which plee had endured a
year between these two parties / the one was asquyer called Jacques le Grys /
and the other party was a knight called John^ of Carongne / and they were
both of the land and household of the earl Peter of alanson / and they were
welbyloued of their lord / and specially this squire Jacques le Grys was
byloued and trysted with his lord above any other person in his court or
household / and because that mortal battle followed between them / and they
being both of one lords household / every man had great marvel thereof.
So that out of diverse countries great multitude of people came to Paris at the
day of battle for to se it / I shall show you the hole matter I as was then
enfourmed.

So it was that on a season this knight called John^ of Carongne took an
entrepryse upon him to goo over the sea for the auauncement of his honor /
where unto he had been long time to accomplysshe So he departed from his
lord the earl of Alanson to do his voyage. And also he took his leave of his
wife / who as then was reputed a fair lady and a young / and he left her in a
castle of his own on the marches of Perch / otherwise called Argentuell /
and so entered in to his voyage / and his wife lay still at her castle in a
wise and sage manner.

So here began the matter by the deuylles temptacyon which entered in to the
body of the squire Jacques le Grys / who was with the earl of Alanson his lord
/ for he was as one of his counsel. And so he determined in his mind to do
an evil deed which he derely bought afterward. Howbeit the evil that he did
could never be proved in him / nor he would never confess it: This squire
Jacques le Grys set his mind on the wife of the foresaid knight John^ of
Carongne in the absence of her husband / and he knew well that she was in the
castle of Argentuell but with her own company and household servants.

And so on a morning he took a good horse and departed from Alanson and so
rode on the spurs with great haste till he came to the ladies castle / and
when he was thither come the ladies servants made him good chere because their
master and he were companyons and fellows together / and served both one lord
and master / and as for the lady she thought none evil in him for she knew
nothing of his entente / nor wherefore he was come thither / Howbeit swetely
she received him / and led him in to her chamber / and showed him part of
her busynes: Then this squire Faques le Grys to accomplysshe his folysshe
appetyte desired the lady that he might se the dongeon / for he said it was a
great part of his coming thither to se it. The lady lightly granted him his
desire / and so she and he went thither all alone / and another chamberer nor
varlet entered with them / for the lady had no mystrust in him of any
dyshonoure / and as soon as they were entered in to the dongeon Jacques le Grys
closed the door after them. The lady knew not thereof / for she went on
before / and thought that the wind had shot the door and so when they were
together thus alone Jacques took the lady in his arms and enbraced her / and
dyscouered to her his intent The lady was sore abashed and would gladly have
gone to the door / but she could not for he was a bygge man / and so laid her
down on the carpe^ and so by force did his pleasure with her and when he had
done what he list he opened the door and so departed / and the lady sore
dyspleased and abashed of yt adue^cure (...) alone in the donteonbut at the
knights departed she said wypynge / Iaket Iaket ye have not well done thus to
shame me / but the blame shall not rest on me / but on you if god suffer my
husband ones to return home again. So Iaket took his horse and departed
and rode again to his master the earl o^ Alanson and was there at his rysynge
about.ix. of the clock and at.iiii. of ye clock mo^e morning he was seen
there before / I shall show you why I speak these words because of the great
plee that followed after / for ye comyssaryes of the parley ament of Paris had
the matter in eramynacyon. Thus the lady of Carongne abode still in her castle
after this sorrowful deed was done to her / and dyscouered the matter to no
creature / but kept her sorrow as secret as she might for she saw well to
speak as then thereof the might have more blame then honor / but she remembered
well the day hour and time that the deed was done / and so after the time
came that the lord of Caroagne came home from his voyage / the lady his wife
made him good chere / the day passed and the night came / and the knight went
to bed and the lady would not / whereof the knight had great marvel and
often desired her to come to bed and ever she blessed her and walked up and
down the chamber studyenge and musing finally when all her servants were
gone to bed / then she came to her husband and fell down on her knees and
lamentably showed him all her adventure / the knight could not believe her.
Howbeit the lady (...) so much that he agreed well that it was so and said
certainly lady sith ye matter is so as ye show me I pardon you / but the
knight shall (...) or his deed by the advise and counsel of (...) friends and
youres. And if your (...) be found untrue ye shall never come in my company.
The lady ever more and more (...) that it was true so that night passed. The
next day the knight wrote many letters and sent them to all his wyffes
friends / and also to his own / so that in a short time they were all come
and assembled together at the castle of Argentuell / and when they were all in
a chamber / then he began to show them the cause why he had sent for them /
and there made his wife to show them all the matter fro point to point /
whereof they all had great marvel / so there he demanded of the^ counsel
/ and he was counsayled that he should draw to his lord the earl of Alanson
and show him all the matter / and so he did / and the earl who gretely loved
this foresaid Jacques le Grys would not believe him / and so gave day to the
parties to be before him at a day lymytted. And also he commanded that the
lady that had appeched Jacques le Grys should be there present for to show
the more plainly the truth of the matter / and so she was with a great
nombre of her lygnage / so the pletynge was great and long in the earls
presence. And Jacques le Grys was accused of his deed by the knight the lord of
Carongne by relacyon of his wife who showed there the case as it was fallen /
Jacques le Grys exscused himself saying how he was not gylty therein / and the
lady laid it sore to his charge / and he ever denied it / and had marvel
by his words why the lady did hate him / he proved by them of the earl of
Alansons house that the same day at four of the clock in the morning he was
seen there in his masters castle / and his master said and affyrmed that
at.ix. of the clock he was with him at his up rysynge / wherefore the earl said
it was not possible for him to go and come and to do that deed in four hours
and an half to ride.xxiii. miles wherefore the earl said to the lady how she
did but dream it / wherefore he would maynteyne his squire and commanded the
lady to speak no more of the matter. But the knight who was of great courage /
and well trusted and by leued his wife would not agree to that oppenyon / but
so went to Paris / and showed the matter there at the parlyament / and there
appeled Jacques le Grys who appeared and answered to his appele and there laid
in pledges to accomplysshe the ordenaunce of the parlyament.

THe plee between them endured more then a year and an half / and they could
not be agreed / for the foresaid knight held himself sore of the informacyon
of his wife and because the matter was so sore publysshed abroad he said he
would maynteyne his quarrel to the death / wherewith the earl of Alanson was
sore dyspleased with the poor knight / and often times would have had him
slain / but that the matter was in the parlyament / so long their plee
endured yt the parlyament determined because the lady could make no proffe
against Jacques le Grys but by her own words / that there should be battle at
vtteraunce between them / and so on a day prefyxed the knight and his wife /
and the squire being present Judgment was given / that the next mondaye
after mortal battle should be done between the knight and the squire / which
was in the year of our lord god.M.CCC. lxxx. and.vii. At which time the
frensshe king and his lords were at Sluse to the entente to pass over the sea in to England / and when the king herd of that matter how a day of
battle was taken to be at Paris / the king said he would se that battle
between the knight and the squire / the duke of Berre / the duke of Borgoyne /
the duke of Borbone / and the constable of France / who had also great desire
to se that battle said to the king / sir it is good reason that ye be there
and that it be done in your presence / then the king sent to Paris comaundynge
that the journey and battle between the squire and ye knight should be
relonged till his coming to Paris / and so his commandment was obeyed.

SO the king then returned fro Sluse and held the feast of Crystmas at Arras
/ and the duke of Borgoyne at Lysle. And in the mean season all other men of
war passed and returned in to France / every man to his place as it was
ordained by the marshalles / but the great lords returned to Paris to se the
said battle. Thus the king and his uncles and the constable came to Paris.
Then the lystes were made in a place called saint Katheryne behind the temple
/ there was so much people that it was marvel to behold / and on the one
side of the lystes there was made great scaffoldes that the lords might the
better se the battle of the.ii. champyons / and so they both came to the
field armed at all peaces / and there each of them was set in their chair /
the earl of saint Poule governed John^ of Carongne and the earl of Alansons
company with Jacques le Grys / and when the knight entered in to the field he
came to his wife who was there sitting in a chair covered in black / and he
said to her thus / Dame by your enformacyon and in your quarrel I do put my
life in adventure as to fight with Jacques le Grys / ye know if the cause be
just and true / sir said the lady / it is as I have said wherefore ye may fight
surely / the cause is good and true / with those words the knight kyssed the
lady and took her by the hand and then blessed him and so entered in to the
field / the lady sat still in the black chair in her prayers to god and to
the vyrgyne Mary humbly prayenge them by their special grace to send her
husband the vyctory according to the right he was in / this lady was in great
heaviness ^or she was not sure of her life / for if her husband should have been
dyscomfyted she was Judged without remedy to be burnt and her husband hanged
/ I can not say whether she repented her or not yt the matter was so forward /
that both she and her husband were in great peril / howbeit finally she must
as then abide the adventure. Then these two champyons were set one against
another and so mounted on their horses / and behaved them nobly / for they
knew what perteyned to deades of arms / there were many lords and knights
of France that were come thither to se that battle / ye two champyons iusted
at their first metyng but none of them did hurt other And after the Iustes
they lyghted on foot to perform their battle and so fought valyauntly. And
first John^ of Carongne was hurt in the thyghe whereby al his friends were in
great fere / but after that he fought so valyauntly that he bette down his
adversary to the earth / and threst his sword in his body and so slew him in
the field / and then he demanded if he had done his deuoyre or not / and they
answered that he had valyauntly acheued his battle. Then Jacques le Grys was
delivered to the hangman of Paris / and he drew him to the gybet of
Mountfawcon and there hanged him up. Then John^ of Carongne came before the
king and kneled down / and ye king made him to stand up before him / and
the same day the king caused to be delivered to him a thousand frankes / and
retained him to be of his chamber with a pencyon of.ii. hundred pound by the
year during the term of his life / then he thanked the king and the lords
and went to his wife and kyssed her and then they went together to the church
of our Lady in Paris and made their offering and then returned to their
lodgings / then this sir John^ of Carongue tarried not long in France but
went with sir John^ Boucequant sir John^ of Bordes / and sir Loys Great / all
these went to se and vysyte the holy sepulture / and to se Lamorabaquyn of
whom in those days there was much speaking / and with them went Robonet of
Bolowne a squire of honor with the Frensshe king who in his days made many
voyages about in the world.

How the king of Aragon dyed and how the archebysshoppe of Burdeaus was set
in prison in Barcelona. Ca. lxi.
THe same season about Candelmas king Peter of Aragon fell syke in his bed /
and when he saw yt he should dye he caused his two sons to come before hy^
John^ the elder and Martyne duke of Blasmont in Aragon and said to them / fair
sons I leave you in good point / and all the busynes of the royalme stands
well and clear keep peace and love between you / and keep faith and honor each
to other ye shall do the better as for the feats of the church according to
my conscience and for the most sure way / I have always holden the new
tralyte between ye.ii. popes / and so I would ye should do till the
determynacyon between them apere more clearly. The two sons answered and said
/ sir gladly we shall obey that ye command and ordeyne as it is reason / thus
in this case dyed king Peter of Aragon who had been a right valiant prince in
his days and gretely had augmented the crown and royalme of Aragon and had
conquered the royalme of Mayiorke / and had anexed it to his own crown / and
he was buried in the good cite of Barcelona / and there he lies / and when his
death was known in Auygnyon with pope Clement and his Cardynalles they wrote
incotynent to ye frensshe king and to his uncles / to the duke of Bar and to
the duches who was of their oppynyon / and they were fader and mother to the
young queen that should be in Aragon the lady yolent / and also they wrote to
her that all these should styre and move the young king of Aragon to be of
their opinion / the frensshe king / the duke of Berre and the duke of Borgoyne
sent in to Aragon in legacyon a cardynall to preche / and to styre the young
king and his brother and the people of that royalme of Aragon to take the
oppynyon of Clement / the Cardynall did so much with the aid of the lady
yolent of Bar as then queen of Aragon who gladly enclyned to that way because
she was so instantly required thereto by her fader and mother / and by the
frensshe king / and dukes of Berre and Burgoyne her cosyns so that she
brought the king and the royalme to be of the oppynyon of pope Clement.
Howbeit the king would have been still a newter as his fader was.

IN the same season that the king of Aragon thus dyed / there was at Barcelona
the archebysshoppe of Burdeaus whom the duke of Lancastre had sent thither in
ambassade / I shall show yon / the cause why. The prince of wales because he
was duke and lord of the country of Acquytayne and that all his neighbors
doubted him / as the Frensshe king / the king of Aragon / the king of Spain
/ and the king of Nauare yea. And also kings that were sarazyns that hard
great speaking of him / for the good fortune and noble chyualrye that he was of
/ and he had a certain alyaunce and confyderacyon with king Peter of Aragon
/ which leage was sworn and sealed between them / and it was confyrmed by the
king of England fader to the prince.

ANd among other things it was comprysed that the king of England nor the
duke and lord of Acquytayne should make any war nor consent to make any
war against the roayalme of Aragon / for the which the king of Aragon swear
and sealed for him and for his airs that every year he should serve the prince
of Acquytayne with the nombre of five hundred speres against who so ever he
had to do withal / or else to send unto him as much money as should wag^
five hundredth speres. And so it was that as then there was.x. years rynne in
aterages that the king of Aragon had paid nothing nor done any service to ye
king of England nor to his deputyes / and when the duke of Lancastre went
out of England / he had with him letters patentes sealed with the great
seal of England / whereby he was stablysshed to be the kings Lyeutenaunt in
the marches of Burdeaus / Bayon / and Acquytayne / and the king gave him fall
puyssaunce and auctoryroyall to demand all ryghtes and due accyons as well of
the royalme of Aragon as else where / and would that the duke should have y^
profit without any excepcyon / and what so ever he did / to be ferme and
stable so thus when the duke of Lancastre had been a season in the town of
saint James in Galyce / he remembered himself of the busynes of Aragon / and
perceived well by reason of his commyssyon / how the king of Aragon was sore
in his det in a great some of money long run in arerages which he thought
if he might get / it should gretely aid him in his wars of Castle / and
so he sent to the archebysshop of Burdeaus / and to sir John^ Harpedan who
was senesshall of all Burdeloys commaundynge the^ both or at the leest one of
them to go in to Aragon to ye king there / and to show him plainly how he
was in great arrerages with the king of England and with the duke of
Acquytayne / the archebysshoppe and the Senesshall beheld well the duke of
Lancastres letters / and so took counsel together thereon / and there they
determined that it was best yt the Senesshall should ^^ry still at Burdeaus and
the bishop to take on him the charge of that voyage / and so he did / and he
came in to Aragon in so evil a season that the king the relaye syke and dyed
/ and after the kings death the archebysshop poursued his cause and followed
the kings children and ye counsel of the royalme who came to the kings
enterment to ye cite of Barcelona / and this bishop pursued his ambassade so
affectuously that he was set in a courtoyse prison so that he could not
depart when he would / when these tidings came to Burdeaus to ye senesshall
there / he said I thought never none other wise / for ye archebysshop is hasty
and heedy / I think now it had been better that I had gone / for I would have
spoken moore mekely / there is a manner thrughout all the world how to
demand a man's right / the senesshall sent these tidings to the duke of
Lancastre in to Galyce who was therewith right sore dyspleased and evil
content with the king of Aragon and his counsel that they had put the
archebysshop in to prison for doing of his ambassade / then the duke of
Lancastre wrote to the companyons of the garyson of Lourde / that they should
make war against them of Barcellona where as the archebysshoppe of Burdeaus
was in prison.

John^ of Byerne who was capytayne there and senesshall of Bygore / Pier
Dauchyn / Ernalton of Resten / Ernalton of saint Colombe and other of the
garyson of Lourde were gretely reioysed when they herd that tidings / and
then began to rynne in to the royalme of Aragon to the ports of Barcelona so
that no merchaunt durst go abroad. Also in Aragon there was another myschefe /
for the young king John^ of Aragon would have been crowned king of Aragon /
but the good towns would not consent thereto without he swear first solemply
that he should never demand tail / tax / nor inposycyon in all ye country
and diverse other things that he should swear and put it in writing sealed if
he would be crowned king / which thing seemed to him and to his counsel to
be right preiudycyall Wherefore he thretened to make them war / and specially
to them of the cite of Barcelona for the king said they were to rich and to
proud.

IN the same season there was in Langue docke and on the fronters of Auuergue
and of Rouergue to ward Pezanas and ye cite of Duzes / a manner of men of arms
called ye Rowtes / and they daily multyplyed to do evil / and.iiii. men of
arms were capytaynes who demanded war against every man / they cared not
against whom / their names were Peter of Mount fawcon / Geffray Chastelyer /
Hamgue de forge / and the goulent. They had a four hundredth men under them /
who ryfled and pylled the country where as they were conuersaunt / and when
they were enfourmed that ye archebysshop of Burdeaus was in prison in Aragon /
and that the duke of Lancastre was not content with the Aragonoys / and also
that the king of Aragon was evil pleased with the good towns of his royalme
and country. And they were of these tidings gretely reioysed / for such
people as they were are rather pleased with evil deeds then with good. They
took counsel between them and determined to approach to Aragon and to get
some forterers on those fronters / thinking then that the duke of Aragon or
else some of ye good towns would entreat with the to their profit. So they
rode costynge the country and set their minds to get if they might the
castle of Dulcen being in ye archbysshopryche of Narbone between the royalme
of Aragon and France on the departing of both royalmes / they came thither at
such a point and by night / that they found it but symply watched nor kept
/ they did so much yt they wan it and were lords thereof / whereby all the
country was afraid and specially they of Parpygnen / for it was but.iiii.
legs thens / also they of Lourde gate ye same weke a castle in Aragon
a.iiii. legs fro Barcelona called the old castle of Rolbays perteynynge to
the countess of Castle Boze cosyn germayne to the earl of Foys. The lady was
gretely abashed when her castle was so taken / she sent to her cosyn the
earl of Foys desynge him for gods sake to render again to her the said
castle which they of his country of Berne had taken fro her ye earl sent to
her yt she should not be afraid for any thing / certefyenge her yt it was
taken but alonely to make war against the^ of Bercelona who held in prison for
a small cause ye bishop of Burdeaus / saying how she should have it right
well again without any damage / ye lady was well peased with his answer and
dyssymuled the matter and went and lay at another castle nere to Roqueberton
and they of the castle of Rolbays / and of Dulcen and of Lourde made sore
war on the fronters of Aragon / and to say the troth the king there
dyssymuled ye matter to chastyse thereby ye good towns yt were against hy^ / so
that ye good towns were sore dyspleased with the king / for they of Barcelona
of Perpygnen and of other towns could not exercise their merchau^dyse / but
they were taken and raunsomed / then they of Barcelona aduysed to deliver the
archebysshop of Burdeaus out of prison and for his delyeraunce to speak with
the king as it was reason / and so pryuely by a mean they treated with the
kings brother sir Martyne duke of Blasemont who was greatly in ye grace of all
ye people desiring him to be mean to the king his brother yt they might be in
peace with them of Lourde and of Rolbays he promised them to do his best / to keep
them in his favor / and he did so much with the king his brother that the
archebysshop of burdeaus was delivered out of prison and sent in to Burdeloys
/ and alone after the earl of Foys did so much that the vycountesse recovered
again her castle / and such as held it departed / this service did the earl
of Foys that year to the duke of Lancastre.

WHen the king of Aragon saw that the countess of castle Boze had so soon
again recovered her castle he sent for her / and she came to him / then the
king laid to her charge how she had suffered ye englyssh men to enter in to
her castle to make war to his royalme / saying how she had done to him a
great trespace / the lady truly excused her and said / sir as god knows and
by the faith I owe to you / the day and hour that tidings came to me of ye
taking of my castle by the of Lourde I never had before no treaty with the
englyssh me^ / but sir inco^tynent I sent to my cosyn ye earl of Foys prayng
hy^ for gods sake to get me again my castle / seeing that they yt had
gotten it were of his country of Byerne and were issued out of Lourde / and
the earl sent to me and bad me not doubt / saying how the taking of it was
but to make war against them of Barcelona / well said ye king prove your
words by your cosyn the earl of Foys and ye shall enjoy peasybly still your
castle with a good will sir said ye lady / she sent to her cosyn the earl of Foys
/ who was at Ortays in Byerne / prayng him to apease the matter with ye king
of Aragon. The earl then sent letters to ye king by a knight of his called sir
Cycarte of Saurelyn desiring the king to suffer his cosyn the vycountes to be
in peace and to live in rest under him / or else surely he would dysplease him
/ ye king of Aragon took the excusacyons in gre and made great chere to the
earls knight / and said how the countess had but well donesyth her cosyn the
earl of Foys did so largely excuse her / thus the lady lived in peace / but the
merchauntes of Barcelona and of ye fronters there about were not in no rest
for them of Lourde but often times were taken and pylled without they were
agreed and patesed with them and so they had diverse in Castellon and in Aragon
/ In like wise so did they of ye garyson of Dulcen and did worse then they did
before for they were more egre and over ran ye country of Aragon / then they
of Lourde did / because they were poor they cared not whom they took as well
officers of the kings and squyers as merchauntes / so that the kings
counsel took advise because the good towns murmured and said how the king
dystroyed them and he ought to sustain them.

WHen the young king of Aragon understood yt his men murmured and spoke of him
otherwise then they should do because of them of the garyson of Dulcen / he was
therewith sore dyspleased / because he was newly fallen to his faders heritage
who was so well byloued in his royalme of all his people / then he spoke to a
cosyn of his a great baron in Aragon sir Raymon of Baghes and said sir Raymon I
desire you to ride to Dulcen / and demand of them that be there what thing
they desire of me or of my royalme / and trete so with them that they may
depart the^s outher by fayrnes or otherwise. The knight departed and sent to
Dulcen an heraulde before him showing them how he would trete with them /
when Mountfawcon and le Goulus and the other capytaynes understood that sir
Raymon of Baghes would trete with them / then they thought at the leest to get
some money / and said to the heraulde / sir say to your master fro us / that
he may come to us surely for we will no hurt to him. The heraulde returned
to sir Raymon who upon his words departed fro Paregant and came to Dulcen /
and demanded of them why they tarried there on ye fronters of Aragon / they
answered and said we abide here the army of france yt should go in to Castle
to go in company with them. A syrs said sir Raymon if ye tarry therefore ye shall
abide a great season. The king of Aragon will not retain you so long nor yet
the country suffer you so long / well sir said they if he will not enterteyne
us so long we can not do withal / yet we must live / if he or the country
will by this our garyson we will depart or else not / well said sir Raymon
what will ye desire to depart / they answered.lx.M. frankes / we be.iiii.
capytanes that is to each of us xv. M. frankes / in the name of god said sir
Raymon that is money enough. I will speak with the king and so departed / and
said it were better for the common profit of ye country that the king paid
that money then to take a greter damage / and that he said to appease them.
Howbeit he thought the contrary.

THus he departed fro them and gave them understanding that they should have
as much as they desired and more / and rode to the king to Perpyghnen and
showed him what these pyllers desired / Well said ye king it is behoueable
that ye country be delivered of them / and that they be paid as thieves and
brybours should be paid / if I may get them they shall be hanged / other
payment get they none of me / but all the dyffyculte is how to get them out
of their garyson / sir said sir Raymon yt shall be done right well / let them
alone Well said the king do as ye think best / I will meddle no more therein /
but that I would they were delivered out of the country / then on a day sir
Raymon gathered a company together of men of arms a.v. hundred speres secretly
and made a squire of Gascoyne capytayne a valiant man of arms called Nandon
Seghen and laid them in a busshment within a little mile of Dulcen and said to
them / syrs when they of the garyson issue out do so that they may all be taken
or slain that the country may be clean ryd of them. Then sir Raymon sent to
them of Dulcen that they should lepe on their horses and issue out and rynne
before ye town of Perpyghnen to put the vyllaynes thereof in fere / else they
would not obey nor give nothing. They of Dulcen were right joyful of these
tidings thinking that all had been troth and so armed them the same day that
the busshment was laid for them / and so departed fro the garyson and rode
toward Perpyghnen and so came to the barryers and made their musters and in
their retournynge thynknge to have passed surely in peace when they were in the
mids of the way they were suddenly encountered by Nandon Seghnen and his
company to the nombre of.v.C. speres / and so dasshed in among them / then
they saw well how they were dysceyued and trapped / and then they drew together
and fought as long as they might endure / which was not long for there were
many of them were evil armed and so shortly they were dyscomfyted / There was
slyne Geffray chastelyer / Hauge desorge Guyot Moresque / John^ de Guenlant /
and many other / and there was taken Peter of Mountfawcon / Amlardan of saint
Just and a.xl. other and brought prisoners to Perpyghnen / and as they passed
thrughe the streets / they of ye town issued out of their houses and hallowed
after them as though they had been wolves / and so they were set in prysones.
The same season the duke of Berre was come to Carcassone / and on ye fronters
of Aragon he came fro Auygnyon fro the pope / and there he herd how they of
Dulcen were slain and taken / then he wrote to the king of Aragon and to his
cosyne yosant of Bare desiring them to send Peter of Mountfawcon and his
company / who incontinent were delivered and sent to the duke of Berre / that
grace yt duke did to them / or else they had all dyed.

How a battle of arms was done at Burdeaus before the lene shall there and
diverse other. Ca. lxii.
THe same season there was at Burdeaus a feate of arms done before the
seneshall sir John^ Harpedon and other between the lord of Rochfoucaulte a
frensshma^ sone to the captall of Buze (...) and sir wyllyam of Mountferant an
Englysshman to rynne.iii. courses with.iii. speres.iii. strokes with a
sword.iii. with a dagger / and.iii. with an axe. This deed of arms was done
before ye lords and ladies of ye country then being at Burdeaus. The earl of
Foys sent thither knights of his house to serve and to counsel ye lord of
Rochfoucaulte sone to his cosyn germayne / and also he sent to him good ho^^
and harneys spear heedes / daggers* words and a^es./ Howbeit he was right well
purueyed of them before on a day these.ii. knights armed them well accompanied
with great cheualry on either party. The lord of rochfoncaulte has in his
company a.CC. knights and squyers all of his lyg^age / and sir wyllyam of
Mountferant had as many or mo with him was the lord of Rohen / the lord of
(...) lord Duras / the lord of Curton (...) of Languras / the lord de la
Barde / the lord of Mountcroy at in Pyergourt and all (...) of his lyguage.
Because this feate of (...) should be done between such.ii. noble (...)
knights many came thither (...) them far and nere / when these two knights
were mountedon their horses with their (...) and targes ready apparelled / their
speres were (...) them and ran together fyersly / (...) each other on their
helmes that ye (...) and their helmes stryken of their heedes in to the field
and so passed forth their course bare heeded except their coyues. The^ all the
lords and ladies said and every man to other how they had nobly encountered
at their first metynge / then their helmes were new set on and fastened / and
so they ran valyauntly their.ii. course / and also the.iii. breuely / al
their feats were nobly accomplysshed to the great pleasure of all the lords
and ladies and other regarders / and every man said how each of them had
valyauntly acheued their feats / and the seneshall of Burdeaus sir John^
Harpedon gave the same day a supper to them and to all the lords and ladies yt
were there present. And the next day every man went to their own herytages
/ and the lord of Rochfoncaulte prepayred himself to go in to Castle / for
the king John^ there had sent for him / and the season drew nere / and sir
wyllyam of Mountferant ordained to go in to Portyn gale / for the king there
had also sent for him.

IN such a noble hystory as this is / which I sir John^ Froysart have pursued
hitherto / and that god has sent me that grace to live so long to se so many
things as I have done / then it were no reason that I should forgete out any
thing that I have known to be done / and because that by ye wars of
Brytayne the.ii. sons of Charles of bloys who of long season called himself
duke of Bretayne by marriage of ye lady Iahan of Bretayne who ought to have been
ryghtful enherytour of Bretayne as it has been showed before in this hystory
whose sons were in England in hostage for their fader / as yet I have made no
mencyon of them where they became / nor how they came out of prison and danger
of the king of England / wherein their fader ye lord Charles of Bloys had
left them / ye know well and it has been written here before how king Edward
of england to make his war of france the fayrer and stronger he alyed
himself with the earl of Montforde and always did counsel and aid him to his
power / and did so much that the earl of Monforde came to his entente and was
duke of Bretayne otherwise he could never have come thereto / for in Bretayne
ye lord Charles of Bloys of.vii. he had ever.v. on his party / it has been
showed before how in the year of our lord a.M.CCC. and xlvii. there was a
great battle in Bretayne before the Ree doryent where the countess of
Mountfordes party / as sir John^ of Harcell and other dyscomfyted sir Charles
of Bloys and there he was taken prisoner and led in to england where he had
good chere / for the queen of England ye good queen Phylyp whose servant I was
in mine yongth / she was of ryghtfull gouernacyon cosyn germayne to ye lord
Charles of Bloys / and she did put to her pain for his delyuerauce / howbeit
the counsel of England would not that he should be delivered / the duke
Henry of Lancastre said and other lords of england that if he were out of
prison by him might be made many great recoueraunces for the royalme of France
/ for king Phylyp as then frensshe king was his uncles / and they affyrmed
that as long as he were kept in prison / their war in to France should be
ye easyer / howbeit for all those words that was showed to the king by the
good means of the noble and good queen he was set to his fynaunce to
pay.CC.M. nobles / which was as then a great some to be paid for lords as
then lived in another manner the^ they do now / for as now men may pay more
then their predecessors might have done / for now they tail their people at
their pleasure and before they lived but on their rentes and revenues / for as
now the duchy of Bretayne wtin a year or two is able to pay to help their
lord.ii.M. nobles or more. The lord Charles of Bloys laid to the king of
England his.ii. sons in pledge for ye said some / and afterward the lord
Charles of Bloys had so much to do in pursuyng his war for the duchy of
Bretayne and to pay his souldyours / and to keep his estate always hoping to
come to a good end of his war so yt he was not able to quyte out his sons
out of England for ye holy man in pursuynge of his heritage dyed as a saint in
a battle in Bretayne before aulroy by the aid of the English men who were
against him / when he was deed yet the war ended not / but then king Charles
of france who in his life doubted greatly the fortunes of the wars / when he
saw that the earl Mountforde and the English men seized not but still went
forward / and wanne towns and fortresses in Bretayne / he fered yt if ye earl
Mountforde might come to his entente of the duchy of Bretayne / that he would
not hold nor do homage to him / for he had promised his alleageaunce to the
king of england who aided and always had done to maynteyne his war / then
he treted with the earl Mountforde and his counsel as it has been showed here
before / wherefore I will speak no more thereof / but ye earl of Mou^tforde abode
as duke of Bretayne with that he should do homage and hold soueraynte or the
crown of france / and by the same trety ye duke should aid and help to get
delivered out of prison in england his.ii. cosyns sons to the lord Charles
of Bloys / which article he never did accomplysshe / for always he doubted
that if they returned they would put him to some busynes for ye duchy of
Bretayne and fered lest they of Bretayne would receive them as their lords /
for they more enclyned to the^ then to him / wherefore he would not speak for
their delyueraunce. Thus these.ii. children abode so long in England in
prison / sometime in ye keeping of the lord Roger Beawchamp and the lady Sybyll
his wife / and sometime with sir Thomas Dambrychcourte / on a time the younger
Guy of Bretayne dyed / then John^ of Bretayne abode still in prison alone / he
was often times sad of his being in prison / but he could not amend it. And
often times when he remembered the loss of his young days as he that was of
the most noble generacyon of the world / and was lykely to lose / he would
often times weep / and wysshed himself rather deed then a live / for a.xxxv.
years or theraboute he had been in the danger of his enemies in England / and
could se no manner of means of his delyueraunce / for his friends and kynne
drew of fro him / and the some that he lay for was so great that he wist not
how it should be paid without god helped him / and the duke of Anioy for all
his puyssaunce and prosperyte and that he had wedded his sister germayne / by
whom he had.ii. fair sons / Loys and Charles for all this he did nothing for
him. Now shall I show you how this John^ of Bretayne was delivered.

How John^ of Bretayne sone to sir Charles of Bloys was delivered out of
prison by the means of Olyuer of Clysson the constable of France. Ca. lxxii.
IT has been showed here before in this hystory how the earl of Buckyngha^
made a voyage thrughe the royalme of France and came in to Bretayne / the duke
of Bretayne had desired him so to do because part of his country would not
be under his obeysaunce / there the earl of Buckyngham and his company lay al
y^ winter and the beginning of somer (...) in great pouerte / before Nantes and
Wennes till it was May and then he returned in to england / and when the
earl. Thomas of Buckyngham and his company lay before Wennes in lodgings
without. There were diverse skyrmysshes between the englysshment and frensshmen
/ and thither came Olyuer Clyu^on constabable of France to se the war yt was
there made / and to speak with ye english knights / for he knew them well /
for in his yongth he was brought up among the^ in England / and so he made
good company with them in diverse manners as noble men of arms will do each to
other / and as frensshmen and englysshme^ have always done / and as then he
had good cause so to do / for he intended a purpose which touched him right
nere / but he would dyscouer his entente to no man living but alonely to a
squire that was there who had always before served ye lord Charles of bloys
for if the constable had dyscouered his entente to ouy man he had been out of
all hope to have sped and brought about his purpose which by the grace of god
he atteyned unto. The constable could in no wise love ye duke of Bretayne nor
he him long time or they showed it. And where as he saw John^ of Bretayne in
prison in england he had thereof great pity / and when he saw the duke of
Bretayne in possessyon of the heritage of Bretayne / and when he thought that
he was in most love with ye duke then he said sir why do ye not put to your
pain that your cosyn John^ of Bretayne were out of the king of Englandes
prison sir ye are bound thereto by oath and promise / for sir when all the
country of Bretayne was in treaty with you / ye prelates noble men and good
towns and the cite of Nantes and Archebysshop of Reins / sir John^ Craon /
sir Boncequalte / as then marshall of france ^reted with you for the peace before
Compercorentync / than and there ye swear yt ye should do your full puyssaunce
to deliver your cosynes out of prison and sir ye have done nothing in that
matter. Wherefore be you sure the country of Bretayne loves you the less and
owes you the smaller favor / ye duke to his demand dyssymuled and said /
hold your peace sir Olyuer / where shalde I get.iii. or.iiii.M. frankes that
is demanded for their raunsomes. Sir said the constable if the country of
Bretayne saw that you were well willing to the matter / they would be content
to pay a tax ^a fowage to deliver the prison ers who are like to dye in prison
without god help them / sy-Olyuer said ye duke as for my country of bretayne
shall not be taxed for me / my cosynes have great princes of their lygnage as
ye frenssh king / and the duke of Anioy / they may help to deliver them / for
they have always sustained the war against me / and when I swear to aid to
their delyueraunce mine entencyon was none otherwise but that ye frensshe king
or their kynsmen should pay their raunsomes the constable could get of ye
duke none other answer / thus as I have begone to show you. The constable saw
clearly how ye earl of bu^kyngham and the barons and knights of england
such as had been with him in the voyage thrughe france and so in to Bretayne
were nothing content with the duke of Bretayne because he would not open his
towns to them like as he had promised when he departed out of England / but
whiles the englysshmen lay before wennes and in the subbarbes of Nanibont they
endured great pouerte / for they had nothing to ete and their horses dyed
for fawte of food. The englysshmen were feign to gather the thystelles in the
feldes and braye them in a mortar and tempre it with water and make there of a
paast and so bake it to ete / such pouerte they endured / and they said among
themself / the duke does not acquyte himself nobly against us sith we have
put hy^ in possessyon of ye sygnory of Bretayne / and if we should do well we
should take it fro him again and get out of prison John^ of Bretayne his
adversary and make him duke / the country loves him better then he that is
now duke / We can not better be revenged of him nor sooner to cause him to lose
the duchy of Bretayne / the constable of france knew right well what words
and sore murmuracyons the englysshmen had among themself against the duke of
Bretayne / wherewith he was nothing dyspleased / for every evil word that
they spoke he would it had been.xii. Howbeit he made thereof no semblaunt / no
more did a squire of Bretayne to whom he had broken his mind / to go in to
england on his message / this squire was called Rollant / and so it was that
sir John^ of Harleton capytayne of Chyerbourge was with the constable at the
castle Iosselyn under saufconduyte / and there the constable made him good
chere and to his company and kept the englysshmen as good company as he could
the rather thereby to get their good wylles / then ye constable squire auaunced
forth and spoke to sir John^ Harleton before the constable and said / sir John^
ye should do me a great pleasure to do one thing for me which shall cost you
nothing / sir said y^ knight for the love of the constable though it be to my
cost I am content to do that I can for you what is that I should do / sir said
the squire yt I might be assured to go in to England to semyne old master
John^ of Bretayne / the grettest desire that I have in this world is to se him
/ by my faith said sir John^ harlton it shall not be let for me but that ye shall
go as soon as I am returned to Chyerbourge I will go in to england / and ye
shall go with me I shall bring you thither / for your request is not to be refused
/ sir said the squire I thank you / and I repute it for a great curtoysy. Thus
this squire went with sir John^ Harlton to Chyerbourg and when he had made
every thing ready he departed and entered in to the sea with John^ Rollant in his
company and so came to London and brought the squire to ye castle where as
John^ of Bretayne was who knew him not at the first metynge / at ye last he
called him to his remembrance and so spoke together / and there he showed John^
of Bretayne / how that the constable of france did and would do his pain for
his delyueraunce / how can yt be said John^ of Bretayne / sir said y^ squire I
shall show you / my lord the constable has a daughter to mary / so that if
ye will swear and promise when ye be returned in to Bretayne to take her to
your wife he will deliver you out of england / he has found well the means
how / sir how say you will ye do thus / ye truly said he / ye shall return
to the constable and say in my name how there is nothing I may do to be
delivered but I will do it / and as for his daughter gladly I will take her to
my wife / thus the squire and John^ of Bretayne departed and passed out of
england and returned in to Bretayne and recorded to the constable all yt he
had seen and hard / and the constable who desired the advancement of his
daughter as to be married so highly as to John^ of Bretayne was not neglygent in
his busynes and studied for a mean in England to bring about his purpose /
and without he had found out a means as he did he should never have come to
his purpose / which was to get ye earl of Oxenforde on his part who was most
pryuy with ye king of England as then / but this matter was not shortly
brought to pass / for as long as ye duke of Lancastre was in england and
before his journey in to spain / there was no dyscouerynge to the king of the
tretye for delyueraunce of John^ of Bretayne / for when ye earl of Buckyngham
returned out of Bretayne the renome ran thrughe all the royalme how ye duke of
Bretayne had falsely acquyted him self to the Englysshmen wherefore was spoken
all ye evil that could be devised / and then John^ of Bretayne was brought in
to the kings presence and to his uncles / and then it was said to him / John^
of Bretayne if ye will releue and hold the duchy of Bretayne of the king of
England ye shall be delivered out of prison and set in possessyon of the
sygnory of Bretayne / and shall be right hyghly married in this country as ye
ought to be / for ye duke of Lancastre wo^de have given him to his daughter
Phylyp in marriage who was after queen of Portyngale / John^ of Bretayne
answered yt he would never agree to that tretye nor never would be enemy nor
contrary to the crown of France he said he was content to take the duke of
La^castres daughter in marriage so he might be delivered out of prison and out
of england / when they saw he would do none otherwise he was set again in
prison / and after the earl or Oxenforde whom we called duke of Irelande saw
that the duke of Lancastre was gone out of england in to Castle / and that
the tretye of the marriage of his daughter with John of Bretayne was passed /
for ye duke of Lancastre had his daughter with him in to Castle / then he
thought to ratrete ye king of england to give him in reward for such service
as he had done and intended to do John^ of Brtayne / for if he could get him
of the king he was agreed with the constable of France to have for his
ransom at two paymentes.vi. score.M. fra^kes / ye first.lx.M. to be paid as soon as John^ of Bretayne were sent and delivered in to ye town of Boloyne /
and ye other.lx. M. to be paid at Paris whersoeuer he would have it delivered
/ ye duke of Irelande coueted these floreyns and did so much with the king of
england yt the king gave him John^ of Bretayne clearly / whereof many in
England had great marvel / but they that list to speak would speak / there
was none other thing / the duke of Irelande caused him to be delivered in to
Boloyne / and there the constable had made ready every thing for him / dnd so
he rode to Paris and there found the king and other lords of his lygnage who
made him good chere and the constable also who brought him in to Bretayne / and
there Johan of Bretayne wedded his daughter as he had promised / and when ye
duke of Bretayne knew that John^ of Bretayne was returned in to France and
clean delivered out of England by the aid and purchase to the constable of
France / then he had ye constable in double hatred and said / what / weneth
sir Olyuer of Clesson to put me out of mine heritage / he shows well the
tokens thereof / he has delivered out prison John^ of Bretayne and has given
him his daughter in marriage which things are to me right dyspleasaunt and
surely that shall I well show ones on a day how he has not well done
peradventure when he takes leest head thereof / he said truly for he showed it
quyckely or ye year passed / as ye shall here after in the story. But first we
will speak of the busynes of Castle and Portyngale and of an army on the sea
yt the englysshmen made to come to Sluse.

HEre before ye have herd how ye frensshe kings army by the sea to have gone
in to england was broken up in the same season not by ye frensshe kings good
will / for always he showed good courage to have passed in to England / and
when he saw how ye journey brake he was more dyspleased then any other / and
all the fawte was laid upon the duke of Berre / howbeit it was to be thought
yt he saw more depelyer in the matter then any other / and in his counsayllynge
to leave the journey was for the honor and profit of the royalme of france*
for who so ever enterprysed to do a thing ought to regard what end may
come thereof and the duke of Berre had been before so long in england in
hostage for ye king his fader and had been so co^uersaunt among ye englyssh men
/ and had seen so much of ye country that he knew by reason what effect the
going in to england should have come to / and ye cause most exscusable not
to go was because winter was so far run. But then it was said yt the
constable of france the next somer should goo in to england with a.vi. M.
men of arms and as many cross bows / for it was thought by himself and said
how that nombre was sufficy to fight with the english men / by reason the
constable ought to have known it / for he had been nourysshed there in his
young days / when these lords were returned in to France / the^ it was
determined to send socours in to Castle to aid the king there against the
king of Portyngale and the duke of Lancastre / for it was thought that
shortly there should be some deeds of arms / for the englysshmen kept the
field. And it was considered yt they could send no men of war thither
without great cost and charge / for the journey was far of / and there was
but little money in the kings treasoury nor in treasourers hands / for the
some of money that had been gadered of the people before in the royalme was
spente and wasted wherefore they studied how to get more / and so a new
tail and tax was devised to ryn thrughout all the royalme of France / to be
paid incontinent without delay / noysynge how it was for the comfortynge of
ye king of Spain and to drive the englysshmen out of his royalme. This tail
was publysshed in every place / and the kings commyssyoners sent in to every
good town and Cite / who said to the governors of the towns. Syrs thus much
your town is taxed at / the which ye must pay incontinent / then the rulers
said / syrs we shall gather this some and then send it to Paris / nay syrs not
so said the commyssaryes / we will not abide so long / we will do otherwise
then so / and commanded in the kings name a.x. or xii. of the best of the
town to goo to prison without they paid the some without any longer delay /
the honest men fered the prison and the kings dyspleasure / wherefore they
drew them together and paid the money incontynente / and recovered it again
of the poor me^ thus they did in every good town / so that there were so many
tails and taxes one after and there / for the first was scante paid when
another began / thus in that season the noble royal me of france was governed
and ye poor people over led. So that many avoided out of their towns and
forsook their herytages and houses / for they were feign to sell all that they
had / and some went to dwell in Haynalte and in to the bysshopryche of Lyege /
where as there ran no tax nor tayllage.

How the duke of Borbon was chosen to goo in to Castle and diverse other / and
how sir Johan Bucke admyral of flaunders was taken prisoner by the English
men. Ca. lxxii.
THen yt was devised what capytaynes should go in to Spain. First they
appointed ye gentle duke of borbone yt he should be sovereign capytayne above
all other / and or he departed there was appointed.ii. other capytaynes to be in
ye vowarde / and the duke of Borbon in the rerewarde with.ii.M. speres knights
and squyers these.ii. capytaynes yt should be in ye vowarde were sir Wellyam of
Lygnac / and sir Gaultyer hf Passac / these.ii. lords when they knew yt they
should be the capytaynes of certain men of arms to go in to Castle / they
prepayred the^ self for yt journey then knights and squyers were sent for
all about the royalme of france to go to Castle / and the passages were
opened as well in Nauare as in Aragon / then knights and squyers departed
fro Bretayne Poycton / Aniowe / Main / Torayne / Bloys / Orleaunce / Beause /
pycardy / borgoyne / berre and Awuergne / and fro all the bounds of the royal
me of france / every man took their way to go in to Castle / and of all the
formest company sir wyllyam of Lygnac / and sir Gaultyer of Passac were leders
/ and to exalte their honor they departed in good array / and all their
companyes in good order.

THus whiles these knights and squyers of the royalme of france prepayred
the^ to goo in to Castle / and such as were first ready first departed and
specially they yt were of far countries / for there were many yt desired
deeds of arms / the same season the englysshmen were on ye see between
England and Flaunders whereof Richard earl of Arundell was admyral and in his
company ye earl of deuonshyre and ye earl of Notyngha^ and the bishop of
Norwyche / they were a.v.C. men of arms and. M. archers / they had lain at
ancre a great season abydyng some adventure and often times refresshed the^ on
ye cost of england and about ye yles of Cornwall / bretayne and Normandy /
and they were sore dyspleased in yt the flete of flaunders was escaped fro the^
/ and were gone to rochell / and specially yt the constable of france was gone
fro Lentrygner to sluse and passed by Calays and met not with him / for gladly
they would have fought with him / and yet ye constable had as many ships as
they / but they passed by the^ by reason of ye wind and the fludde yt they had
in ye night time / ye english navy lay at ancre before Mergate at ye Tames
mouth toward Sandwyche abiding their adventure / and specially abydyng for
ye ships yt were gone to Rochell / for they thought they would shortly
return and so they did / for when ye merchauntes of flaunders / of rochel /
of Haynalte and other places / who for doubt of ye englysshmen were conjoined
together / departed out of flauders / they promised each other to go and to
return together / and to take each others part / and when they had all done
their busynes in Rochel and in ye country of Xainton and had charged their
ships with wynes / then as soon as they had good wind they dysancred and
departed out of ye haven of Rochell and took their way by ye see to goo in to
flaunders and to Sluse and fro whens they departed / they sailed so long yt
they passed ye raze saint Mathewe in Bretayne without peril or damage and so
costed base Bretayne / and the^ nor mandy and so came right over ye Tames mouth
where as ye english navy lay / the flemynges perceived where they lay / and
they in the high ships said to their company / syrs advise you well we shall
be met by ye english army / they they have perceived us they will take ye
aduau^tage of ye wind and tide / we shall have battle or it be night / yt
tidings pleased not well al parties and specially ye merchauntes of flanders
/ of Haynalte / and of other countries who had their merchau^dyse there abroad
/ they would gladly have been thens if they might. Howbeit sith they saw no
remedy but fight / they ordered the^ self thereto / and they were cross bows
and other me^ harneysed defensably arrayed mo the^.vii.C and among the^ there
was a valiant knight of flaunders who was their capytayne and was as then
admyrall of the sea set there by the duke of Borbone called sir John^ Bucke
right sage and hardy in arms / and had done before great damage on the sea to
the englyghmen / this sir John^ Bucke set every thing in good order and decked
his ships well and wisely as he yt could right well do it and said syrs be not
abashed we are me^ ynowe to fight with ye english army and ye wind will serve
us yt ever as we be fyghtyng we shall aproche nerer and nerer to Sluse we shall
coost flaundres / some took good comfort with those words and some not / so
they put themself in good order and defense / and made ready their cross bows
and gonues.

THe english ships aproched and they had certain galays fournysshed with
archers / and they came formest rowing with owers and gave the first assault
and archers shot fyersly and lost much of their shot for the flemynges
covered them under ye deckes and would not apere but drove ever forth with the
wind and when they were out of ye english archers shot then they did let fly
their quarelles where with they hurted many / then approached ye great ships of
England / the earl of Arundel with his company and the bishop of Norwyche with
his / and so the other lords they russhed in among the flemynges ships and
them of Rochell / yet the flemynges and cross bows defended the^ self right
valyau^tly for their patron sir John^ Bucke did ever comfort the^ / he was in
a great strong ship wherein he had.iii. gonnes shotynso great stones that where
soever they lyghted they did great damage / and ever as they fought they drew
little and little toward flaunders / and some little ships with their
merchauntes took the coostes of Flaunders and the low water and thereby saved
them / for ye great ships could not follow them for lack of water / thus on
ye se there was a hard battle and ships broken and sunken on both parties
/ for out of the tops they cast down great bars of iron / where as they
went to the botom / this was an hard battle and well fought / for it endured
a.iii. or.iiii. hours / and when the day failed they withdrewe each fro other
and cast ancre and there rested all night and dressed their hurt men / and
when ye fludde came they dysancred and drew up sails and returned again to
the battle / with the englysshmen was Peter du Boys of Gaunt with a certain
archers and maryners / who made the flemynges much a do / for he had been a
maryner wherefore he knew the art of the sea / and he was fore dyspleased yt
the flemynges and merchauntes endured so long / always ye englysshmen wanne
advantage of ye flemynges and so came between Blanqueberg and Sluse against
Gagant there was ye dyscomfyture / for they were not socoured by no creature /
nor also at yt time there were no ships at Sluse nor men of war / true it
was there was a squire a man of arms at Sluse called Arnolde the mayre / when
he hard how there was battle on the sea between the army of England and
them of Flaunders he took a bark of his own and entered therein and with him a
certain men of Sluse / and twenty cross bows / and rowed by force till he
came to the battle / but yt was at the point of the dyscomfyture / for by
that time the englysshmen were seized of the most part of the flemysshe
ships and had taken sir John^ Bucke their capytayne and his ship and all that
were within it / and when this Arnolde the mayre saw ye manner of that battle
he made his cross bows to shote.iii. times and then returned and was chased
into the haven of Sluse but the englysshmennes ships were so great that they
could not approach so nere ye land as the bark did / and thereby he saved
himself and his company.

THe men of the town of Sluse were sore abashed when they hard of those
tidings so that they wist not what to do other to give up their town and
forsake all or else to enter in to the ships that lay there and so defend
the haven / surely if the Englysshmen had known the case they were in / they
had been lords of the town and of the castle or if they had byleued Peter du
Boys / for he sore counsayled them that they should incontinent have set on the
town of Sluse / they had won it if they had so done / but the englysshmen
had no courage thereto but said it were a great folly for us to enter in to ye
town of Sluse / for then they of Bruges / of Dan / and of Ardenbourge shall
come and besyege us / and so peradventure shall lose all that we have won / it
is better for us to keep it and to make wise war then folysshly to lose all /
thus the englysshmen kept still the sea but they determined to brenne the
nauye of ships yt lay at ancre in the haven of Sluse / of such ships as
they had won they took part of the^ such as were most old and dry and
lyghtest and gresed them well both within and without and set fire on them and
so let them go with the wind and with ye tide in to the haven to ye entente
that they should have fastened and set fire on other ships yt lay there of
Spain and of other places / howbeit as god would that fire did no hurt nor
damage to none other ship.

How the englysshmen aryued / and burnt diverse vyllages. Ca. lxxiii.
AFter that the englysshmen dyscomfyted sir John^ Bucke as he came fro Rochell
whereby they had great profit specially of wine / for they had a.ix. M. tonne
of wine whereby wine was the derer all the year after in Flaunders / Holande /
and in Brabande / and the better chepe in England as it was reason / such are
the adventures of this world if one have damage another has profit. Thus
still ye english men lay before Sluse at an an^r^ / and sometime with their
barks and barges they set a land on the other side against Sluse where as
there was but a river to pass / and there they burnt a mynstre and other
towns alonge on the sea side and on the dygnes called Torn Hoque and
Murdequer and took men prisoners in the country and were there lyenge a.x.
days and laid bysshmentes between Dan and Sluse on the way of Coceler / and
there was taken John^ of Lannay a man of arms of Tourney who was come thither
with the lord of Estrynay and sir Blanquart of Calomne came thieves on ye
spurs fro Tourney with.xl. speres / and also sir Robert Merchaunt a knight of
flaunders who had to his wife a bastard daughter of the earl of flaunders was
as then at Bruges / when the tidings spread abroad of the Englysshmen so he
departed and came to Sluse and entered in to ye castle which he found in
small defense / for if the englysshmen had taken land at Sluse as they did on
the other side of the water they had taken at their ease the castle and all
the town / for such as should have defended the town were so abashed yt
there was no man took any head of defense / then this knight gave them heart
and said. Ayesyrs and good men of Sluse how maynteyne you yourselfe / by yt ye
show yourselfe dyscomfyted without any stroke strykynge / men of valor and of
good defense ought not so to do / they should show forth a good vysage as
long as they could endure at the leest till they were slain or taken /
thereby they should attain to the grace of god and praise of the world / thus
said this sir Robert when he came to Sluse.

IN ye mean season while ye englysshmen were before Sluse and theraboute al ye
country to Bruges were afraid / for they were every day abroad a foragynge a
foot for they had no horses / and sometime they would enter far in to the
country. On a day they burnt ye town of Cocesy on the downs a great vyllage
in the way toward Ardenbourge / and so to the sea side called Hosebourcke /
they did there what they list and might have done more if they had known what
case the country was in / and when they had tarried there at their pleasure and
saw that no man came against them / then they took their ships and drew up
sails and so returned in to England with.CC.M. frankes of profit / and so
came in to Tames straight to London where as they were received with great joy /
for the good wynes of Poycton and Xamton that was determined to have been
dronken in flaunders / in Haynalte / Brabant and in diverse other places in
pycardy / the englysshmen brought all with them in to england / and was lord
and departed at London and in other places of England / wine was sold then
for.iiii. pens the galon / and certain merchauntes of zerecyell in zelande
lost part of the same wine / but they had restytucyon again of all their
losses / for they of zercyell would never agree to go to make war in to
england nor would suffer none of their ships to goo in ye journey whereby
they atteyned great love of the Englysshmen / sir John^ Bucke was put in prison
curioysly at London / he might go where he list but every night to lodge in ye
cite / he could never come to his ransom / yet the duke of Borgoyne would
gladly have had him by exchange for a bastard brother of ye king of
Portyngalles whom they of Breuelet had taken on the sea coming to Meldeboure /
thus sir John^ Bucke was prisoner three years in England and there dyed.

How the duke of Lancastres marshal took the town of Ribadane which was
strongly kept. Ca. lxxiiii.
How yt is time that we return to the busynes of Castle and Portyngale and
to speak of the duke of Lancastre being in Galyce / and of such busynes as
fall in yt season which were not small and also to show what aid and comfort
ye frensshe king sent yt time in to Castle / or else king John^ of Spaynes
busynes had but easily gone forward / I say surely y^ same year yt the duke
aryued in his country he had lost all his land if ye aid of the frensshe
king had not ben / ye know well yt tidings spredeth ever far / the king of
Portyngale knew as soon as ye duke of Lancastre or any other man / how ye
frenssh kings army yt lay on ye see to have gone in to Euglande brake their
journey / for the king of Portyngale lay as the^ at ye cite of Port a strong
town and a have well used by reason of merchau^tes yt resorted thither / and
when he knew of ye brekynge of ye frensshe kings army he was glad thereof / for
it had benshewed him before that all england was lykely to have been lost.
Wherefore he some what dyssymuled with the duke of Lancastre dryuynge of the
taking of his daughter in marriage / but still he drove him of with fair words
and salutacyons / and when he was justly enfourmed of the departing of ye
frensshe king fro Sluse / then he called his counsel and said / sir ye know
well how ye duke of Lancastre is in Galyce and the duches our cosyne with him
and it is not unknown to you how he was here and had counsel together and
how it was agreed that I should have his daughter in marriage / so it is I will
perceyuer in ye same estate and will demand her honorably as it is reason
and apertenent to such a prince as the duke of Lancastre is and to me as king
of Portyngale / I will make that lady queen of Portyngale / sir said they of
his counsel / ye do in this according to reason / for ye have so sworn and
promised / well said the king / then let us send for her to the duke then
there was appointed the archebysshop of Braschez / and sir John^ Radyghen of
Sar to go an that ambassade / they were sent for to the king / and so they
took on them that voyage / and with them they had a. CC. speres. Now let us
speak of ye syege that sir Thomas Moreaus marshall of the duke of Lancastres
cost had laid before the town of Rybadane / and show what became thereon.

I Believe that they of Rybadane thought to have been comforted by king John of
Castle and by the knights of France who lay in ye town of Valcolyue or
else they would never have endured so long / for I have marvel how such
a sort of vyllaynes could endure against such a sloure of archers and men of
arms and were not abashed / for every day they had assault and it was said
to sir Thomas Moreaus in manner of counsel by the most valiant knights of
his company sir leave this town here / then an evil fire may b^enne it and let
us go further in to the country to Maynes / to Noye / or to Besances / always
we may return again when we list by my faith said sir Thomas that shall
never be said that vyllaynes have dyscomfyted us / I will not depart hens
though I should tarry here.ii. months without y^ duke send for me. Thus the
marshalles mind and oppynyon was to keep still there his syege / the king of
Castle who lay at Valeolyue and had sent specially for aid in to France /
he hard daily how they of Rybadane defended themself valyauntly and would
not yield / in the name of god said the Barroys of Barrers it gretely
dyspeaseth me yt we sent not thither our frenssh men / they would gretely have
recomforted the men of that town / and also I am not content that I am not at
the syege / for then at the leest I should have the honor as these vyllaynes
have now / and surely if I had known the truth of the strength of that
town I would have refresshed it and have put myself at adventure therein / as
well god should have sent me the grace to have defended the town as these
vyllaynes do. Thus he devised in the kings presence and before the frensshe
knights who desired deeds of arms. Then it was said to the king / sir send
a. C. speres in to these towns of Noye and of Calongne / for who so has
those. ii. castelles has the.ii. sides of ye land of Galyce / and to go
thither diverse did present themself before the king / as sir Trystram of Roy
and sir Raynolde his brother / sir Aulberte of Braquemont / sir Trystra^ of
Galle / sir John^ of castle Morant / and sir Barroys of Barrers. The king
herd them well and was content with their offres / and said / fair syrs I
thank you of your good wylles / howbeit ye may not all go / some of you must
abide still with me for adventures that may fall / but at this present time I
desire the Barroys of Barrers to take on him that charge if it please him / ye
knight was right glad of yt journey / for he thought he had lain there to long
and said to the king / sir I thank your grace and shall keep and defend it
to my power / and shall not depart thens till ye send for me / so be it a
goods name said the king / we think to here shortly some tidings out of
france / as then the knights knew not of the frensshe kings departing fro
Sluse / but the king knew it well enough / for the duke of Borbon had written
to him of all the busynes in france / and how he was appointed to come in to
Castle with.iii. M. speres and before him to open ye passages should come.iii.M.
speres under the gydynge of sir Wyllyam of Lygnac / and sir Gaultyer of Passac
/ the frensshe knights desired ye king to show them some tidings out of
France with a good will said the king.

THen the king said syrs surely the duke of Borbon is chosen pryncypal
capytayne to come in to this country for ye frenssh king and his counsel
has appointed him to come with.vi. thousand speres knights / and squyers /
and also two valyaunte knights are chosen capytaynes for to come before him as
sir Wyllyam Lygnac / as sir Gaultyer of Passac / they shall come first with
a.iii. M. speres as for the voyage by ye see in England is broken up for this
season till the constable of France and the earl of saint Poule and ye lord
of Concy with.iiii. M. speres shall goo in to England this next May. How
say you syrs to this said the king / sir said they these be rich tidings we
can have no better for this next somer deeds of arms shall be well showed in
your country / if there be.vi. M. appointed there will come.ix. M. we shall
surely fight with the englysshmen / they keep as now the field / but we shall
close them together or it be mydsomer / sir these knights that come are right
valiant and specially the duke of Borbon and the other are proved knights and
worthy to be governors of me^ of arms / anon was spread abroad in ye town of
Valeolyue and abroad in Castle the great comfort and aid that should come
out of France by the first day of May / whereof knights and squyers were
right joyous.

THus the Barroys of Bars departed with a.l. speres and rode to the castle
of Noye / tidings came to the duke of Lancastres marshall how the frensshmen
were a broad riding with a.l. speres to come to reyse the syege before
Rybadane / When the marshal hard those tidings / he byleued it lightly / for
they that showed him thereof affyrmed it to be true saying how they had seen
them ride over the river of Dorne and took their lodgyng at ye town of Arpent.
Then ye marshal was in doubt and took counsel / and determined to send
word thereof to the duke of Lancastre his lord and so he did / and he sent
sir John^ Dambrecycourt and a heraulde who knew all the ways in Galyce / and
then the marshall made ever good watch and spyal / for he doubted to be
ascryed in the night half the do watched every night while the other slepte
/ sir John^ Dambretycourt and the heraulde came to the town of saint James to
the duke and to the duches / when ye duke knew of their coming he said /
surely we shall here some tidings / as soon as they came to his presence /
the duke demanded what tydynge / sir said they none yt be good / but your
marshall has sent us hyder to you / to know your pleasure what he should do
for it is reported to him for certain that the frensshmen are assembled
together in Castle and ride fast to pass the river to come and fight with your
men lyenge at syege before Rybadane / sir these be the tidings yt we have
brought. In the name of god said the duke these be none evil tidings that we
shall shortly provide for them / he beheld sir John^ Holande his constable /
and his admyrall sir Thomas Percy and said to them / syrs take a CCC. speres
and. CCCCC. archers / and go to your company before Rybadane / they are in a
doubt yt the frensshmen should come and assail them / then these.ii. knights
made them ready and took with them.iii. C. speres and.v. C. archers and departed
fro the duke and rode so long that they came before Rybadane where their
co^panyons were lodged / who were greatly reioysed of their comyge / then sir
John^ Holand said to the marshall / what say they of Rybadane will they not
yield them / by my faith said the marshal / they are proud people they se that
all the country about them do yield / yet they keep still their opynyons /
and yet they be but a many of vyllaynes / there is not among them one
gentylma^ of name / sir hold your peace said sir John^ Holande / for within
these. iiii. days we shall bring them to that point that they shall be glad to
yield themself to any that will take them to mercy / but sir I pray you do ye
frensshmen ride abroad / ye surely sir said he I have been well enfourmed how
they ride to the nombre of.v. C. speres in one company which may well be /
for daily to them there comes men of war out of France / and as I have
knowledge it is the Barroys of barrers / he is in the castle of Noye with.l.
speres this is all that we know / thus they were all lodged together as well as
they might and made great prouysyon that came after them.

About a.iiii. days after that John^ holande and sir Thomas Percy were to men
to the marshalles do they ordained to make a great assault and caused to be
made a great engyne of tymbre with wheles to be removed with strenthe of men
whyther they list and within it might easily be a. C. knights and a. C.
archers / and they had filled ye dykes where as this engyne should pass / then
began the assault / and the engyne to approach with strength of men and therein
archers well provided with arowes fyersly shotynge at them within the town / and
they within casting out darts and stones meruaylously / but they byneth were
covered with mantelles and ox hydes to defend the^ fro ye stones and darts and
under yt couerture men of arms approached well pauessed with pyke axes to perse
the wall / so that they enpayred the wall / for they within could not
defend the wall because of the archers who shot so holy together that none
durst appear at their defense so with hewynge they reuersed in to the dyke a
great pane of the wall / when they with in saw themself in so great myschefe
/ they were gretely abashed / and then cried out a loud we yield ourselfe /
we yield us / but there were noone that made them any answer / The English
men did laughe at them and said. These vyllaynes have put us to much payne^
and now they mock us when they would have us to take them to mercy / now ye
town is our own / some of the English men answered them within and said.
Syrs we know not what ye say / we can not speak no Spanysshe / speak good
frensshe or english if ye will that we should understand you. Thus they
cu^red and passed forth and chased these vyllaynes / who fled before them
and slew them by hepes. That day there were slain what of one and other with
the Jews yt were there moo then.xv. hundred. Thus the town of Rybadane was
taken by force / and such as first entered had there great pyllage / and
specially they found more gold and silver in the Jews howses then in any
other place.

AFter the taking of Rybadane which was won by pure assault / and that the
English men had pylled it at their pleasure then they demanded of ye
marshall what should be done with the town if it should be burnt or not /
nay said the marshall we will keep it and new repair it. But now whether
shall we prepayre / and they determined to draw to Maures a good town in
Galyce Then they were appointed that should abide in Rybadane and repair it /
there was left sir Peter of clynton a right valiant knight with.xx. speres
and.lx. archers / they made great prouysyon with that they found there
specially of yokes and good wynes / which were so strong and mighty that the
english men could not drink thereof if they drank much they were in that
case they could not help themself in two days after. Thus they dyslodged
fro Rybadane and rode toward the town of Maures / and carried in pieces with
them y^ great engyne / for they saw well it did good service / and was
ferefull to men in the towns. When they of Maures understood how the
englysshmen were coming to them ward to have the town under the duke and
duches of Lancastres obeysaunce / and knew how Rybadane was taken by force /
and how that they brought with them a devil instead of an engyne / for it was
so great that it could not be dystroyed / they doubted greatly the oost and
this engyne / then they went to counsel to se what were best for them to do
outher to yield or to make defense. And when they had well counsayled together /
they could se none other thing but yt it was far better for them to yield
then to defend / for they considered if they were taken by force / they should
lose body and goods / and no comfort appeared to them fro any part / they
that were sage said. Syrs behold how they of Rybadane were taken at their
defense / and yet they were as strong as we or stronger / and they were
besyeged more then a month / and yet they had another aid nor socoure / as
we understand the king of Castle accompteth at this season al ye country of
Galyce lost to the river of Dorne / nor we think that this year there comes
no frensshe men to our aid / wherefore let us yield ourselfe mekely without
damage as other towns have done / every man beheld the same oppynyon / but
some said how may this be done / well enough said the sages / we shall go
and mete them on the way and bear the keys of ye town with us and present
them to the english men / they be courtoys people / they will do us no hurt
if we receive them curtoysly / to this they were all agreed / then there issued
out of ye town a fyfty persons of them yt were most noble as soon as they
knew yt the english men approached they issued out / and about a quarter of
a leg of / they tarried for the Enghysshe men:

Tidings came to the English men how they of the town of Maures we re
issued out / not to fight but to yield them and the keys of the town which
they brought with them. Then ye lords rode on before to se what the matter was /
and caused all the archers and oost to tarry behind / then the Galycyens came
forth / and it was said to them / Syrs behold here the lords of England
sent by the duke of Lancastre to conquer this country / speak to them if ye
list. Then they all kneled down and said. Syrs we be of the poor men of
Maures who^wyllyngly will be under the obeysau^ce of the duke of Lancastre and
of my lady the duke of Lancastre and of my lady the duches / wherefore we desire
you to accept us to mercy for all that we have is yours / the.iii. lords of
england by each others advise answered and said / ye good people of Maures we
shall go with you in to the town and part of ^ur oost not al and there ye shall
make promise and oath as good people ought to do to their lord and lady / syrs
said they this shall we do with good wylles. Then said the lords go your
ways on before and open the gates / for ye are and shall be received to mercy
/ then they went to their town and opened their gates and barryers and
suffered the constable and the other lords to enter and a.iiii. C. speres with
them / and the resydue of the oost lodged without in the feldes and had
prouysyon out of the town suffycyent / the lords lodged within the town and
took the oaths of them of the town of Maures as it is said before.

How the duke of Lancastre sent for the admyrall and mershal and his other
officers to come to the wedding of his daughter and the king of Portyngale.
Ca. lxxiiii.
THe next day after the town of Maures was given up and that every man made
them ready to go to the cite of Besances / there came tidings and letters fro
the duke of Lancastre commau^dynge them on the sight of his letters what so
ever estate they were in / to repair to his presence / certefyenge them that
he looked in a short season / for the archebysshop of Braghes and for sir John^
Radyghes de Sar ambassade fro the king of Portyngale who were coming to wedde
his daughter by procuracyon and to lead her to the cite of Port where the
king of Portyngale tarried for her / When these lords understood these
tydy^ges they returned their way and said it was requysyte for the duke to
have his lords and counsel about him at ye receyuynge of these ambassadors
/ and so returned and left men of war in ye garysons that they had won /
and so came to the town of saint James as the duke had commanded them / and
within.iii. days after thither came ye bishop of Braghes / and sir John^
Radyghes de Sar with a. CC. horses / they were all well lodged / then when they
were ready apparelled ye ambassadors and other lords in their company went to
the duke and to the duches in good array / where they were received with great
joy and there declared the cause of their coming The duke herd them well and
was well rejoiced therwt because of ye auauntement of his daughter and for the
alyaunce of the king of Portyngale which he thought right behouable for him
if he would enter to conquer Castle / the bishop showed the duke and the
duches and their counsel how he had auctoryte by procuracyon personally to
wed the lady Phylyp of Lancastre in the name of the king of Portyngale /
wherewith the duke and duches were well content / thus sir John^ Radyghes de
sar by virtue of procuracyon wedded ye lady Phylyp of Lancastre in the name of
and king of Portyngale and the bishop of Braghes wedded them / and so were
laid curtoysly in bed as husband and wife ought to be / and the next day
after the lady with all her company were ready to depart and so took leave of
her fader / mother and systers / with ladies and damoyselles with her and her
bastard sister wife to ye marshall with her / and with her went sir John^
Holande sir Thomas Percy / and sir John^ Dambrychcourte and. C. speres and. CC.
archers and so rode to the cite of Port in Portyngale.

Against the coming of the young queen of Portyngale issued out of the cite of
Port to do her honor and reverence prelates of the church / as ye bishops
of Lyxbone of Deure / of Connymbres / and of Port / and of temporal lords /
the earl Dangose / the earl of Nouayre / the earl of Lescal / Galope Ferant
Patryke Pymasse / Martyne de Marlo and mo then.xl. knights / and great nombre
of their people and many ladies and damoyselles / and all the clergy reuested
in habytes of processyon thus the lady Phylyp of Lancastre was brought in to
the cite of Port in Portyngale and so^ to the kings palace / there the king
took her by the hand and kyssed her and all the other ladies and damoyselles
that were come with her and brought her in to her chamber / and then took leave
of all ye ladies / and the lords of england that were there lodged at their
ease and all their men in the cite of Port / for it is a great cite / and yt
night they kept the vygyll of the feast to the next day / the ladies
daunsynge and passing their time that night / and on the Tuysdaye ye king of
Portyngale with the prelates / and lords of his country were ready in the
morning and kept on their horses at the palace and so rode to ye cathedral
church called saint Maryes / and there carried for the queen who came
accompanied with ladies and damoyselles / and though sir John^ Radyghos de Sar
had wedded her before in the kings behalf / yet then again openly there ye
king wedded her / and so returned to ye palace and there was made a great
feast and a solemn / and after dinner Iustes and tournays before the king and
queen and at night the pryse was given of the^ without to sir John^ Holande /
and of ye chalengers a knight of the kings called sir John^ Tet door had the
pryse so that day and night they perceyuered in great tryumphe and joy / and
the king lay with the queen / and as the reuome ran in the country and
court ye king was as then a clean maid / the next day the feast renewed
and new Iustes / and the pryse of the chalengers had Vas Martyne of Merlo and
of them without / and sir John^ Dambretycourte and ye night there was great
daunsyng singing and sporting / and every day there were knights and squyers
that Iusted.

WIth such tryumphes Iustes and sportes as ye have hard the queen of
Portyngale was received at her first coming in the cite of Port / and these
feestes endured more then.x. days and the king gave great gifts to all the
strangers so that they were well content. Then the knights of England took
their leave of the king and of the queen / and returned to ye cite of saint
James to the duke and duches / who of them demanded tidings and they showed
all yt they had seen and hard / and how the king of Portyngale and the queen
did command them to them / and said / sir the last word yt the king said to
us was how he desires you to draw in to ye field when it please you / for in
likewise so will he do and draw in to Castle. These be good tidings said the
duke. Thus about a.xv. days after the constable and admyral were returned
fro ye king of Portyngales marriage ye duke of Lancastre prepayred for his
journey to go and conquer castells and towns in Galyce / for as then the duke
was not lord of all ye towns in the country / and it was ordained yt when
the duke should depart fro saint James that the duches and her daughter
Katheryne should in likewise depart and goo to the cite of Port in Portyngale
/ to se the king and ye young queen their daughter / and the town of saint
James was delivered to the keeping of an english knight called sir Loys
Clyfforde and.xxx. speres with him and an. C. archers.

How the duke of Lancastre and his men rode toward the cite of Besances /
and how the town made composycyon with them Ca. lxxv.
THus the duke Lancastre departed and all his me^ and such as were ordained to
abide in garyson abode and the duke and the duches rode toward Besances / one
of ye last towns between Galyce and Portyngale the right way to Port and to
Connymbres / and because ye duches of Lancastre and her daughter should go to
se the king of Portyngale therefore they held that way / when they of Besances
knew yt ye duke was coming on them with all his oost then they drew to
counsel and were of many oppynyons. Finally they determined for ye best and
sent to the duke and duches.vi. of the chief of the town to desire and trete
for an abstynence of war for.viii. days / and in ye mean seaseon they to
send to the king of Castle / showing him without he came so strong to
fight with the duke / to yield up their town without any other mean. Then
there departed fro Besances.vi. men and rode to mete with yt englysshmen. First
they encountered with the vowarde which the marshall led. There they were
stopped and demanded what they were and what they would / they answered how
they were of Besances and that by appoyntemente of the town they were charged
to goo and speak with the duke / the marshall said to sir John^ Soustre / sir
go and bring these men to ye duke in saufgarde for fere lest our archers do
slay them / and then he said to them / syrs goo your ways this knight shall be
your guide / so they rode forth and at the last found out the duke and duches
and her daughter and sir John^ Holande / sir Thomas Percy and diverse other with
them sporting them under the shadow of the fair Olyue trees / and they
beheld well sir John^ Soustre coming to themwarde. Then sir John^ Holande
demanded of him and said / sir John^ are those your prisoners / nay sir said
he they be no prisoners / they are men of Besances sent by the mershall to
speak with my lord ye duke as I think they will make some tretye the duke and
the duches herd al those words Then sir John^ Soustre said to them ye good
men auaunce forth / behold here your lord and lady* Then these.vi. men kneled
down and said My right redoubted lord and lady the comonaltye of the town of
Besances have sent us to your presence / sir they understand how ye are
coming or sendynge your army against the^ they desire of your specyal grace
to forbere them these.ix. days / and in the mean season they will send to
the king of Castle to the town of Valcolyue and show him what danger they
be in / and sir without there come with in these.ix. days such socoure to
them as to fight with you / they will yield them unto your obeysaunce / and if
ye lack any prouysyon of vytayles or any other thing in the mean season / ye
shall have out of the town for your money at your pleasure for you and for all
your men. Therewith the duke stood still and spoke no word / and suffered the
duches to speak because it was in her country / then she beheld the duke and
said / sir what say you / madame said he and what say you / ye are herytoure
her / that I have is by you / therefore ye shall make them answer / well sir
said she / me think it were good to receive them as they have demanded / for
I believe the king of Castle has as now no great desire so shortly to
fight with you / I can not tell said the duke would to god he would come
shortly to battle / then we should be the sooner delivered / I would it should
be within.vi. days / wherefore as ye have devised I am content it so be / then
ye duches turned her toward the.vi. men and said / syrs depart when ye list
your matter is sped / so that ye deliver in hostage to our marshall.xii. of
the best of your town for suretye to uphold this tretye / well madame said
they we are content / and sir John^ Soustre was commanded to show this
tretye to the marshal / and so he did wherewith the mershall was well content /
and the.vi. men returned to Besances / and showed how they had sped /
then.xii. men of the most notablest of the town were chosen out and sent to
the marshall. Thus the town of Besances was in rest and peace by the foresaid
tretye. Then they of the town sent the same.vi. men that went to ye duke to
the king of Castle and his counsel. The king as then knew nothing of
that composycyon nor how the english men were before Besances.

IN the mean season that these six men were going to the king of Castle /
the duke ordained that the duches and her daughter Katheryne should goo to the
cite of Port to se the king of Portyngale and the young queen her daughter /
and at their departing the duke said to the duches. Madame Costaunce salute
fro me the king and the queen my daughter and all other lords of Portyngale /
and show them such tidings as ye know and how they of Besances be at
composycyon with me / and as yet I know not whereon they ground themself /
nor whether that our adversary John^ of Trystmor have made them to make this
tretye or will come and fight with us or no / I know well they look for great
comfort to come to them out of france / and such as desire deeds of arms
and advancement of honor will come as soon as they can / wherefore it
behooves me always to be ready and to abide battle / this ye may show to the
king of Portyngale and to his counsel / and if I se that I shall have any
thing to do / I shall shortly send the king word thereof / Wherefore say
that I desire him to be ready to aid and to defend our right and his / in like
manner as we have promised and sworn together / and madame when ye return
again to me leave our daughter katheryne there still with the queen her sister
/ she can not be in better keeping / sir said the lady all this shall be done.
Then the duches and her daughter and all other ladies and damoyselles took
their leave and departed sir Thomas Percy the admyral accompanied them and sir
non Fythwaren / and ye lord Talbot and the lord John^ Dambretycourte / and
sir Namburyne of Lyuyers and a hundred speres / and two hundred archers and so
came to the cite of Port in Portyngale.

How the duches and her daughter went to se the king of Portyngale and the
queen. And how the town of Besances submytted them under the obeysaunce of
the duke of Lancastre. Ca. lxxvi.
WHenne the king of Portyngale understood that the duches of Lancastre and her
daughter were coming to him ward / he was thereof right joyful / and sent to
receive them of the grettest me^ of his court. The earl of Angoses / and the
earl of Nouayre sir John^ Radyghos de Sar sir John^ Ferrant Perteke sir Vas
Martyne of Marlo sir Egeas Colle and a.xx. other knights who met with the
duches a two great legs of / and joyfully received them / and the duches made
friendly chere to all the lords and knights both with words and countenance.
Thus they came to the cite of Port / and all ye ladies and damoyselles were
lodged in the palace and the king came and met with the ladies and kyssed them
all / then after came ye queen who received the duches her mooer and her sister
right honorably as she that could right well do it / all the kings court
were right joyful of the coming of these ladies and damoyselles / I will not
speak of all their acquayntau^ces and good chere. for I was not there present I
know nothing but by the report of that gently knight sir John^ Ferrant
Perteke who was there present / and he enfourmed me of all that I know in that
matter and of many other There the duches devised with the king of Portyngale
when she saw her time / and showed him all the words that the duke her
husband had given her in charge to show. The king answered her right sagely
and said. Fair lady and cosyn I am all ready if the king of Castle come forth
in to the feldes within.iii. days I shall have r^dy.iil.M. speres / they be
ready in the field on the fronters of Castle / and also I have ready.xx. M. of
the commons of my royal me who be not to be refused / for they did me good
service on a day at the battle of Iuberoth. Sir said the lady ye speak well
and I thank you thereof. And sir if any things happen to fall to my lord and
husband he will incontynente sygnyfye you thereof / with these words and other
the king and the duches devised together. Now let us turn to them of
Besances / and show how they sped.

WHen these.vi. men of Besances were before the king of Castle they kneled
down and said. Right redoubted lord may it please you to understand that we
be sent hyder fro your town of Besances who are by force in composycyon with
the duke of Lancastre and with ye duches and has obtained a sufferaunce of
war for.ix. days / so that if ye come or send such a strength able to
resyst the duches puyssaunce / then ye town to abide still under your
obeysaunce else they are bound and have laid hostage to deliver up the town
to the duke of Lancastre / wherefore may it please your grace to give us
answer what we shall do in this case. The king answered and said / syrs we
shall take advise and then give you answer therewith the king departed fro
them and entered in to his secret chamber / I cannot tell what counsel he took
nor how ye matter went / but these.vi. men were there.viii. days and had no
manner of answer nor saw no more the king. So the day came that the town
should be given up and as the^ their messagers were not returned again. Then
ye duke of Lancastre sent to Besances his marshall the.x. day to speak with
them and to command them to render up their town / or else to stryke of the
heedes of the hostages / ye marshall came to Besances to the barryers and there
spoke with them of the town and said / ye syrs of Besances take heed what I
say. My lord the duke of Lancastre has sent me to you to demand why ye
have not brought to him the keys of your town and submyt you to be under his
obeysaunce as ye ought to be / the.ix. days be past as ye know well / and if
ye will not thus do / your hostages shall lose their heedes here before you /
and after we shall assail you and take you perforce / and then ye shall all
dye without mercy like the^ of Rybadane / when ye men of Besances herd those
tidings / they greatly doubted and also fered to lose their friends that were
in hostage with the duke / and said to the marshall / sir my lord ye duke has
good cause to say and do as ye have reported / but sir as yet we here no
tidings fro our men whom we sent to the king of Castle for the same cause /
we wot not what is become of them. Syrs said the marshall peradventure they
are kept there still for the tidings they have brought to the king of
Castle which are not very plesaunt to him to here / but my lord the duke will
abide no longer / wherefore advise you to make me short answer / else
shortly ye shall have assault / then they spoke again and said / sir we
require you let us assemble together in the town to take advise and then we
shall answer you / I am content said the marshall / then they returned in to
the town and by the blastes of trompettes in every street they assembled to
gather in ye market place / then they declared to all the comonte all the
foresaid words / and so finally they accorded to render up their town / and
to save their estates yt were in prison / then they returned to the marshall
and said / sir in all your demaundes we can find nothing but as reason
requires / we are content to receive my lord the duke and my lady the duches
in to this town and to put the^ in possessyon thereof / and sir here be the
keys / and we shall goo with you to the^ to their lodging if it please you to
bring us thither / with right a good will said the marshal / then there issued
out of Besances a.lx. me^ berynge the keys of their town with them / and the
marshall brought them straight to the duke and showed him all their ententes /
the duke received the^ and delivered the^ their hostages and the same day
entered in to the cite of Besances and there lodged and all his company as many
as might.

How they of Besances that had been sent to the king of Castle came home to
their town after it was rendered up to the duke of Lancastre. Ca. lxxvii.
AFoure days after that Besances was given up the vi. men that were sent to
Valeolyue to ye king of Castle returned home to their town / then it was
demanded of them why they had tarried so long / they answered how they might
not do therewith nor amend it / saying how they had spoken with the king who
had promised the^ to take counsel and then to give answer / which answer
we tarried on.viii. days / and as yet they said they were returned without
answer / then they were asked no moo questyons but they said how the king of
Castle looked for much people to come out of france and diverse were come and
lodged abroad in the country / but the capytaynes as sir Wyllya^ of Lygnac and
sir Gaultyer of Passac were not as then come / but all such knights and
squyers in Spain that should be under the guydynge of those.ii. capytaynes
were ready apparelled / but all such as were retained and appointed to be under
the duke of Borbon were still in their own houses upon a redynes. Thus as ye
have herd here before sir Wyllyam of Lygnac and sir Gaultyer of Passac passed
thrughe the royalme of France and came in to (...) / they were mo then a. M.
speres knights and squyers of al countries / they assembled in Carcassone / in
Narbonoys and in Thoulousayne and as they came so they lodged in this good
country / many there were that paid little or nothing for that they took.
Tyoynges came to the earl of Foyze being at Ortays that men of war of
France approached nere to his country and would pass thrughe to go in to
Spain and it was said to him / sir they pay for nothing that they take /
Wherefore all the common people flies before the^ as though they were
englysshmen / and the capytaynes be at Carcassone / and their men theraboute
and so passes the river of Garon to Thoulouse / and then they will enter in to
Bygore / and so incontinent in to your country / and if they do then as they
have done all the way they shall do great evil in your country of Byerne.
Therefore sir take good head what ye will do in this hehalfe / ye earl of Foyze
who was soon counsayled in himself said / I will that all my towns and
castelles as well in Foyze as in Byerne be provided for with men of war / and
all the country to be in a redynes to enter in to battle if need be / I will
not bye derely the war of Castle / my lanoes be free / if frensshe men will
pass thrughe they shall pay truly for every thing that they take or else
all the passages in my country shall be kept close against them / and syrs ye
sir Arnalte Wyllyam and sir Peter of Byerne I charge you to defend and keep
the country / these.ii. knights were bastard brethren and right valiant
men in arms / they took on them this charge. Then in all the earl of Foyze
country it was ordained that every man should have armure ready as they were
wont to have or better / and to be ready daily whenever they were commanded
/ then in Byerne and in Foyze and in Thoulouse every man was ready to enter in
to battle / and there was sent to ye cite of Palms a. C. speres of good men
of arms / Sir Espayne du Lion was sent to Sanredun / sir Cycart of saint
Lygyer / to Maryzes / and sir Peter of Byerne was with a. C. speres at
Bellpount / and at the enter of the erldome of Foyze at saint Thybaulte on ye
river of Garon was sir Peter of Calestan / and sir Peter Meaus of Noyalles
with.l. speres at Polamnuche / and sir Peter of Toce at the castle of Mesun /
the bastard of Esperung at e Morleus / sir Arnolde Wyllyam with a. C. speres
at Pan / sir Guide de la mote at mount Marsen / sir Raymon of new castle at
Sauuetere / syryuayne of Foyze The earls bastardes sone at Mountesquyn / sir
Ve^doll of Neuosan / and sir John^ of saint Marcell at Oron / sir Hector de la
guard at mount Garbell / John^ of Now castle at Ertyell / and the earl sent
to sir John^ lane being at the castle of Beawuoyson to take good head to all
his fronters / and he sent to saint Gaudes a cosyn of his sir Ernalton of
Spain / Breuely there was another town nor castle in Foyze nor in Byerne but
were refresshed with new men of war and they said they were men ynowe to resyst
double ye nombre of other me^ of arms / for they were in all to ye nombre of
a.xx.M. men of war of chosen men.

Tidings came to sir Wyllyam of Lygnac being at Thoulouse and to sir Gaultyer
of Passa^ being at Carcassone / how ye earl of Foyze provided men of arms
and furnysshed every garyson / and the renome ran that he would suffer none
to pass thrughe his country / whereof these.ii. capytaynes were sore abashed
/ and then they appointed to mete in the myd way to speak together at the castle
of Daurey how they should do with the earl of Foyze then sir Wyllyam said /
sir Gaultyer to say truly it is great marvel that the frensshe king and his
counsel have not written to him to open peasybly his country. Well sir said
sir Gaultyer it is necessary that ye go and speak with ye earl and show him in
curtoys manner that we be sent by the frensshe king this way to pass peasybly
and to pay for all that we take / surely the earl of Foyze is so great and
mighty that if he list we get no passage thrughe his country / then we must
pass thrughe Aragon / which is far of I can not tell why the earl makes
such doubts nor why he so fortefyeth his garysons / nor whether he have made
any alyaunce with ye duke of Lancastre or no. I desire you go to him and know
the truth / ye se how our men daily pass in to Bygore / I am content said
sir Gaultyer and so took these.ii. capytaynes leave each of other / sir Wyllya^
of Lygnac returned to Thoulouse / and sir Gaultyer with.xl. horse went and
passed ye river of Garon at saint Thybaulte / and there he found sir Menalte
of Nouayles who made him great chere / sir Gaultyer demanded of him where he
should find the earl of Foyze / he answered him at Ortays. These.ii. knights
were a season together and comoned of diverse matters / then sir Gaultyer
departed and came to saint Gaudes and there he had good chere / the next day
he rode to saint John^ de Ryuyer and rode all the lawne of Bonc and costed
Mauuoysyn and lay at Tournay a close town / and ye next day he rode to dinner
to Tarbe and there tarried all day / and there found the lord Dauchyn and sir
Menalte of Barbason two great lords of Bierne / they spoke with him of many
things and because that the lord of Barbason was of the party of the earl of
Armynacke he could speak no good word of the earl of Foyze. The next day he
departed and went to Morlaus in Byerne and there he found sir Raynolde
wyllya^ bastard brother to the earl of Foyze who receyned him with good chere /
and he showed sir Gaultyer how he should find the earl of Ortays and how he
would be right glad of his coming / God grant it said sir Gaultyer for to
speak with him I am come in to this country. So they dyned together / and
after dinner sir Gaultyer went to his lodging to mount Gabryel and the next
day by.iii. of the clock he came to Ortays and could not speak with the earl
yt day till the next day at after noone when the earl accustomed to come
abroad.

THe next day when the earl of Foyze knew that sir Gaultyer of Passac was
come to speak with him somewhat he made the more have to issue out of his
chamber / then sir Gaultyer did salute him / and the earl who knew as much of
honor as any knight did saluted him again / and took sir Gaultyer by ye hand
and said / sir ye be right heartily welcome what busynes has brought you in to
this country of Byerne / sir said the knight sir Wyllyam Lygnac and I are
committed by the frensshe king to conduyte in to Castle certain men of arms
as ye have herd or this / and how yt ye will let our journey and close your
country of Byerne against us and our company / then the earl of Foyze said /
sir Gaultyer that is not so / for I will not close nor keep my country
against you nor against any man yt will peasybly pass and pay to my people for
that they take / which fredome I have sworn to keep / and to maynteyne and
mynystre to them Justice as every lord is bound to do to his subjects / for
that entente lords have their sygnoryes / but it has been showed me that ye
bring with you a manner of Bretons / Barroys / Loraynes and Borgonyons who
know not what pain means / and against such people I will close my
country / for I will keep my people in their fraunches and ryghtes / sir said
the knight the entente of me and my companyon is that none shall pass thrughe
your land without they pay peaseably to the agreement of the poor me^ or else
to be taken and corrected according to the usage of your country / and they
to make restytucyon for every damage by them done or else we to satysfye for
their trespasses / so their bodies may be delivered to us / and without he be a
gentle man we shall make Justice to be done of his body before your men / that
all other shall take thereby ensample / and if he be a gentyl man we shall cause
him to render and restore any damage by him done / or else we shall do it for
him / this cry we shall make with a trompet in every man's lodging / and
also declare it again to them or they enter in to any part of your land / so
that none shall exscuse them of negligence / sir may this suffyse and content
you Then ye earl said / sir Gaultyer if this be done I am well content / and
ye shall be welcome in to this country / I will be glad to see you / let us
go^ to dinner and then we shall talk more together.

Sir said the earl cursed be ye war between Portyngale and Castle / I ought
greatly to complain of it / for I never lost so much as I did at one season in
ye war between those two royalmes / for all my chief men of war of Byerne
were there slain / and yet I showed them or they went that they should make
their war wisely / for I said the Portyngales were hard men to mete withal
and cruel of deeds / if they have the over hand of their enemies / they have
no mercy / sir Gaultyer I speak it that when ye and your companyon come in to
Castle sith ye two be the chief capytaynes of them that are passed and shall
pass / and peradventure ye shall be required by the king of Castle to give
your counsel and advise / be well aduysed that ye give not to hasty counsel
to advance to fight with your adversaries / ye duke of Lancastre / the king
of Portyngale the English men or the Portyngales / for all these be famylyer
together and be all as one / and the english men desire to have battle by.ii.
reasons / one is of a great season they have had no profit / they be poor
and have won nothing of a long time but rather spend and have lost.
Wherefore they will be ready to auaunce themself in hope to get some new
profit / and such people as be adventurers desiring other men's goods will
fight with a hardy courage and often times fortune serves them well / the
other reason is / the duke of Lancastre knows surely that he can not come
parfytely nor peasybly to the heritage of Castle which he demands to have
by the right of his wife whom he calls ryghtfull enherytoure / but all only
by battle / for he knows well if he might have and obtain one journey
against the king of Castle that all the country then would yield to him and
trymble before him / and for this entente he is come in to Galyce and has
given one of his daughters in marriage to the king of Portyngale to the entente
that he should aid his quarrel / and syrs I say this to you / for if the
matter should fall otherwise then well ye and your fellow shall bear more blame
then any other. Sir said sir Gaultyer I thank you of your good aduertysement
and sir my service shall be ready to do you pleasure / for at this day ye be
among other christian princes reputed for one of the most sagest and happest in
all your adventures / but sir my companyon and I have one above us who is chief
sovereign of all our company that is the duke of Borbon / and till he be come
in to Castle we shall make no have to fight with our enemies what soever any
man say / so they entered in to other talking till the earl of Foyze demanded
for wine. Then they drank and so took leave / the earl entered in to his
chamber and sir Gaultyer returned to his lodging well accompanied with the
earls knights and so supped together.

THe next day after dinner yr Gaultyer took his leave of the earl of Foyze / and
be side other things the earl gave hyym a fair courser and a mule / sir
Gaultyer thanked the earl and so departed out of Ortays and lay / the same
night at Ercyell and the next night at Tarbe he rode that day a great journey
/ and then he determined to send fro thens to sir Wyllyam of Lygnac / and so
he did aduertysynge him how he had spedde with the earl of Foyze / and
desiring him to come on forward with all their companyes and showing him
how the country of Byerne and all the good towns should be open / payenge
trewely for that they take or else not. This messagere did so much that he
came to Thoulouse and did his message and delivered his letters. And when sir
wyllyam had read the contynewe hereof he made it to be known to all his
company that they should set on forward / so that as soon as they entered any
part of the earl of Foyze land to pay for every thing that they should take
/ else their capytaynes to answer for every thing / this was cried by the
sound of a trompet fro lodging to lodging / to the entente that every man
should know it / then every man dyslodged out of ye marches of Toulouse /
Carcassone / Lymous / and of Marbon / and so entered in to Bygore / and sir
Wyllyam of Lygnac took his horse and rode to Tarbe to sir Gaultyer his companyon
/ and there made good chere together / and their bands and row^es passed by and
assembled together in Bygore to ride in company thrughe the country of Byerne /
and to pass at Ortays ye river of Gaure which renneth to Bayon.

AT the yssuynge out of the country of Byerne is the enter of the country of
B^squey in ye which country as then ye king of england held great lands in
ye bysshopryches of Burdeaus and Bayon / there were a.lxxx. towns with steples
that held of the king of england / and when they understood of ye passage of
these frensshmen through their country they were in doubt of over rynnynge /
brennynge and exylynge / for as then there were no men of war of their party
in all that country to defend their fronters / the sage men drew together and
sent to trete with the frensshe capytaynes and to bye their peace / then they
sent to Ortays.iiii. men having auctoryte to make their peace. These.iiii. men
met by the way with a squire of the earl of Foyze called Ernalton du Pyn / and
showed him all their matter desiring him to help the^ to speak with sir
Gaultyer of Passac and sir Wyllyam of Lygnac / when they came to Ortays which
should be within.iii. or.iiii. days after / and to help to aid to make their
peace / and he answered that he would do so with a good will. The night that the
capytaynes came to Ortays they were lodged at ye same squyers house / and there
he aided them of Bysquey to make their apoyntment / and they to pay.ii.M.
frankes and their country saved fro brennynge and robbynge / the earl of Foyze
gave a dyuer to these capytaynes / and to sir Wyllyam of Lygnac a fair courser
/ the next day they passed to Sameterre and entered in to the country of
Bysquey which was redeemed / they took vytayles where as they might get it /
and so passed thrughe the country without doing of any other damage / and so
came to saint Iohn^s de Pie of Port at the enter of Nauare.

How sir John^ Holande and sir Raynolde de Roy fought together in lystes before
the duke of Lancastre in the town of Besances. Ca. lxxviii.
Here before ye have herd how the town of Besa^ces was put in composycyon
with ye duke of Lancastre and how it was yelden up to him / for ye king of
Castle did comfort it nothing / and how ye duches of Lancastre and her
daughter came to ye cite of Port in Portyngale to se the king and the queen
there / and how the king and ye lords there received them joyfully as it was
reason / and thus while the duke of Lancastre soiourned in the town of
Besances tidings came thither fro Valeolyue brought by an heraulde of france
who demanded where was the lodging of sir John^ Holande / and so he was
brought thither / then he kneled down before him and delivered him a letter and
said / sir I am an offycer of arms sent hyder to you fro sir Raynolde du Roy
who saluteth you / if it please you to read your letter / then sir John^ said
with right a good will / and thou art right welcome and opened his letter and
read it wherein was contained how sir Raynolde du Roy desired him in the way
of amors and for the love of his lady to deliver him of his challenge / iii.
courses with a spear.iii. strokes with a sword iii. with a dagger and.iii. with
an axe / and that if it would please him to come to Valeolyue he would provide
for him and.lx. horse a sure saufco^duyte if not he would come to Besances
with.xxx. horses so that he would get for him a saufcondyte of the duke of
Lancanstre / When sir John^ Holande had red these letters he began to smyle and
beheld the heraulde and said / friend you art welcome / thou have brought me
tidings yt pleases me right well / and I accept his desire you shalt obyde
here in my house with my company and to morrow you shalt have answer where our
arms shall be accomplysshed outher in Galyce or in Castle / sir said ye
heraulde as it pleases god and you. The heraulde was there at his ease / and
sir John^ / went to the duke and found him talking with the marshall / then
he showed them his tidings and the letters / Well said the duke / and have ye
accepted his desire ye truly sir said he / and I desire nothing so much as
deeds of arms / and the knight has desired me / but now sir where shall it
be your pleasure that we do our arms / the duke studied a little and then
said / I will that they be done in this town / make a saufconduyte for him as
it shall please you and I shall seal it. In the name of god said sir John^
that is well said / the saufcondyte was written for him and.xxx. knights and
squyers to come saufe and go saufe / then sir John^ Holande delivered it to the
heraulde and gave him a mantell furred with myneuer and.xii. angel nobles.
The heraulde took his leave and returned to Valeolyue to his master and there
showed how he had sped and delivered the saufconduyte / on ye other part
tidings came to the cite of Port to the king of Portyngale and to the ladies
there how that these deeds of arms should be done at Besances / Well said the
king I will be thereat and the queen my wife with other ladies and damoyselles
/ and the duches of Lancastre who was as then there thanked the king in that
she should at her return be accompanied with the king and with ye queen / it
was not long after but the time approached. Then the king of Portyngale / the
queen / the duches and her other daughter with other ladies and damoyselles
rode ^orth in great array toward Besances / and when the duke of Lancastre knew
that ye king came thither he took his horse and many other lords and issued out
of Besances and met the king and ye ladies / there ye king and the duke made
great chere together / and so entered together in to ye town and their lodging
appointed as it aperteyned according to the manner of ye country / and that
was not so easy nor large as though they had been at Paris.

About a.iii. days after that the king of Portyngale was come to Besances
thither came sir Reynolde du Roy well accompanied with knights and squyers he
had a vi. score horses / and they were all well lodged / for the duke of
Lancaste had prepayred ready their lodgings. Then ye next day sir John^
Holande and sir Raynolde Roy were armed and mounted on their horses and so
came to a fair place ready san^ed where they should do their arms / and
scafoldes ready made for the king and for the ladies / and for the duke and
other lords of england / for they were all come thither to se ye deeds of
arms of these.ii. knights / they came in to the field as well appointed as
could be devised / and there was brought in their speres / their axes and
their swords and well horsed / and so each of them a good dystaunce fro other
made their tournes and fryskes fresshly / for they knew well they were
regarded / every thing was ordained at their desire and all their arms
granted except the vtteraunce / howbeit no man knew what should fall of their
bodies for sith they were thither come they must needs mete at ye point of
their speres / and after that with their swords / and then with axes and
daggers / loo what danger they were in to the entente to exhaulte their
honor / for their lives lay but in the mysaduenture of one stroke / thus they
ran together and met as even as though they had rynne by a line and struck
each other in the vysoure of their helmes so that sir Raynolde du Roy brake his
spear in.iiii. pieces and ye sheuers flewe a great hight in to ye air / which
course was gretely praised / sir John^ Holande struck sir Raynolde in likewise
in ye vysoure but the stroke was of no force / I shall show you why / sir
Raynolde had the vysoure of his helm made at auau^tage for it was tied but
with a small lase / the lase ^rake with y^ stroke and the helm flewe of his
heed so that the knight was bare heeded / and so passed forth their course /
and sir John^ dyscharged and bare his staff fresshely / then every man said it
was a goodly course.

THen these knights returned to their own places and sir Raynolde was helmed
again and had a new spear / and so they ran together again they were both
well horsed and could well guide the^ / they struck each other on the helmes so
that the fire flewe out / ye speres brake not / but sir raynoldes helm again
flewe of his heed. A said the Englysshmen ye frenssheman has advantage / Why
is not his helm as fast bocled as sir John^ of Holandes is / we think he
does wrong / let him set his helm in like case as his companyon has done
his / hold your peace syrs said the duke of Lancastre / let them dele in arms
/ let every man take his advantage as he thinks best / if sir John^ Holande
think yt the other knight have advantage let him set on his helm in like
manner / but as for me said the duke and I were in like arms as these.ii.
knights be I would have my helm as fast bocled as I could / and I think
here be many of the same oppynyon. then the english men spoke no moo words /
and the ladies and damoyselles said how the knights had iusted well and
goodly / and the king of Portyngale said the same and spoke to sir John^
Ferant and said / sir John^ in our country knights just not in this goodly
manner / sir said he these knights do just well / and sir I have seen or this ye
frensshmen just before ye king your brother when we were at Elyres against the
king of Castle / like iustes I saw there between sir wyllyam Wyndsore and
another frensshe knight / but their helmes were faster tied then this knights
helm is / then the king regarded again the two knights to se their third
course.

THus they ran together ye third course and regarded each other wisely to
take their advantage / they might well so do / for their horses served them
at their wysshyng and so they struck each other again on the helm in such
wise yt their eyes trimbled in their heedes and their sta^es brake / and again
sir Raynoldes helm flewe of his heed and so each other passed forth their
course and demeaned themself fresshly / so that every man said how they had
nobly iusted / but the englysshmen blamed gretely sir Raynolde du Roy in that
his helm was no faster set on his heed / but the duke of Lancastre blamed him
nothing but said I think him wise that can in feats of arms seek his lawful
advantage / it seems well yt sir Raynolde is not to learn to just / he
knows more therein then sir John^ does / though he have borne himself right
well. So thus after their courses with their speres they took their axes and
did their arms with them and gave each other.iii. great strokes on their
helmes / and then they fought with their swords and after with their daggers /
and when all was done there was none of them hurt. The frensshmen brought sir
Raynolde to his lodging / and the Englysshmen sir John^ Holande to his / the
same day the duke of Lancastre made a dinner to all the frensshmen in his
lodging and the duches set at the table by the duke / and sir Raynolde du Roy
bynethe her / after dinner they went in to a counsel chamber / and ye duches
took sir Raynolde by the hand and made him to enter as soon as herself / and
there she comoned with him and other of the frensshe knights till it was time
to call for drink / then ye duches said to the frensshe knights / syrs I have
marvel of you / that ye do sustain ye wrong oppynyon of a bastard / for ye
know well and so does all the world that Henry that was sometime called
king of Castle was a bastard / therefore what just cause have you to sustain
that quarrel / and aid to your power to dysheryte the right air of Castle /
for I know well and so does all the world that I and my sister were
daughters by lawful marriage to king Peter Wherefore god knows what right we
have to the royalme of Castle / and the good lady when she spoke of her fader
she wept / then sir Raynolde du Roy made his obeysaunce and said. Madame we
know right well that all is of troth that ye have said / howbeit ye king our
master is of the contrary oppynyon against you / and we be his subjects and
must make war at his pleasure / and go where as he will send us / We may not
say nay. So the duches departed to the duke / and ye frensshe knights drank
and then took their leaves / and went to their lodging / and there every
thing was ready to depart / and then they mounted and departed fro Besances
and rode the same day to Noy / and there they rested / and then rode forth
till they came to Valeolyue.

How the king of Portyngale and the duke of Lancastre determined to enter in
to the royalme of Castle. Ca. lxxix.
AFter these deeds of arms done as I have recorded The king of Portyngale and
the duke of Laucastre took counsel together and determined to ride and to
enter in to Castle within a short space / and that the king of Portyngale
with all his power should ride on the fronters and so to enter in to Castle /
and the duke and his rowte to enter on the bounds of Galyce and to conquer
such towns and fortresses as were against him / and if John^ of Castle did
assemble his oost against them to make battle / the^ both their oostes to
draw together / It was thought most necessary to have their oostes a sondre
till need were rather then together / to exchewe sykenes yt might fall and to
have the more easyer lodging and foragynge in exchewyng of debates and
dyscordes / for englysshmen be hasty and proud in ye field / and the
Portyngales hot and dysdaynful and can not sustre / but it was thought yt in a
great journey of battle they should right well agree together / this counsel
was determined and the king said to the duke / sir as soon as I have
knowledge that ye set forward I shall do in like case for I and my men be
ready / and they desire nothing else but battle / sir said the duke and I
shall not long sir still it is showed me how as yet there be certain towns
in Galyce yt rebel against us / I will goo and vysyte them / and after that I
will seek out for our enemies / whersoeuer I can find them. Thus the king of
Portyngale took leave of the duke and duches / and in like wise so did the queen
Phelyp and her young sister katheryne for it was ordained that the young lady
should abide all the war season with her sister the queen at the cite of Port
in Portyngale / it was thought she could be in any better keeping / and ye
duches returned to saint Jacques in Galyce / so thus every body departed thither
as they should do / the king to the cite of Port / and the duches to the
town of saint Jacques well accompanied with knights and squyers / and the duke
tarried at Besances and there about / and prepayred shortly to set forward /
he was desirous to depart because it was in the ioly lusty month of Aprell at
which season in Galyce the grass is full grown and all their corn and
herbs flowers and fruytes ready ripe the country is so hot yt in the
beginning of June harvest is past / the duke thought the season goodly to set
forward his army. Now let us somewhat speak of the ordering of the frensshmen
and of king John^ of Castle as well as we have done of the english men.

How sir Wyllyam of Lygnac / and sir Gaultyer of Passac came to the aid of
king John^ of Castle. Ca. lxxx.
HEre before ye have herd how sir Wyllyam of Lygnac and sir Gaultyer of
Passac did so much by their wise entreatynge of the earl of Foyze yt he
suffered them peasybly to pass thrughe his country of Byerne to go in to
Castle and beside that the earl gave them great rewards / for there were no
knights nor squyers strangers that came to se him / but that he would largely
reward them according to their degrees / to some a.C. floreynes / to some CC.
floreynes and.xxx. or.xl. so that this said first passage of the Frensshe men
cost the earl of Foyze as his own treasourer showed me the some of a.M.
frankes beside horses and other things that he gave / to say troth surely it
is great damage yt such a person should be old or dye / he had no
mermosettes about him / to say sir take here / and give this / and pynche and
pyl the people / surely he had none such about him ^ he did every thing on
his own mind / for naturally he had great wisdom and could give where need
was and take as it became him best and by reasan of his larges and great
expenses sometime he trauayled his subjects / for his revenues were not
suffycyent to bear out his gifts which were yearly.lx.M. frankes / ye which
like have not ben seen nor herd of any other / yet he assembled his treasoure
for doubt of all adventures in.xxx. year.xxx. times a.C.M. frankes / and yet
for all that his people always prayde to god for his long life / and I herd
it reported how when he dyed there were in Foyze and in Byerne.x.M. persons
that said yt they would gladly have dyed with him whereby it is to be thought
that they said not so without it had been for great love yt they had to their
lord / and surely if they loved him they did but right and according to
reason / for he always maynteyned them in their right and kept ever true
justice / for all his lands and the people therein had as great lyberte and
fraunchesse and lived in as good peace as though they had been in paradyse
terrestre / I say not this for flattery nor for favor nor love that I bear him
nor for the gifts that he has given me / but I can well prove all that I have
said / for I am sure there be a.M. knights and squyers will say the same.

Now let us return to sir Wyllyam of Lygnac and to sir Gaultyer of Passac
who were capytaynes and sovereign leders of all the frensshe army / when they
were passed the country of Bysquey and the pase of Rounceuall / which cost
them.iii. days a passing. The mountains were so full of snow for all that
it was in the month of Aprell / yet they and their horses had much pain to
pass thrughe. Then they came toward Panpylona / and there they found the
royalme of Nauare ready open for to suffer them to pass thrughe. For the king
of Nauare would not do no dyspleasure to the king of Castle because his sone
sir Charles of Nauare had to his wife as then the king of Castelles sister /
and when the peace was made between king Henry and the fader of king John^ of
Nauare they made and promised great alyaunce together which they long kept /
for the king of Nauare was not able to resyst the king of Castle without he
had great alyaunce and comfort of ye king so Aragon / or else of ye king of
england.

THese capytaynes of France came to Pampylona where the king of Nauare was
who received them joyfully and made them to dyne with him in his palace after
dinner he led them in to his chamber and there comoned with them of diverse things
/ for ye king there was a wise man and a subtell and well langaged / and
among other things he showed them how ye frensshe king and his counsel
had been dyspleased with him without a cause / and wrongfully had taken fro him
his heritage and lands in Normandy which he ought to have by succession of
his predecessors kings of france and of Nauare which he said he could not
forgete seeing he had taken fro him in Normandy / Languedoc / and in the barony
of Mountpellyer the some of.lx.M. frankes of yearly revenues and he said he
wist not to whom to complain to have right / but all only to god / syrs said
the king I say not this to you because ye should address my wrongs for I
know well it lies not in your power / for I think the frensshe king will do
but little for you in that behalf / for ye be none of his counsel / ye be
but knights adventures and sowdyours to go where soever he send you.

But I speak this in manner of complaynte to al knights in France that pass
by me / then sir Gaultyer of Passac said / sir your words be true if that you
say that our king for all us will another give nor take / for surely sir we be
not of his counsel but ready to go where as he will send us / but sir the
duke of Borbon who is our sovereign capytayne and uncle to our king comes
after us this same way / outher going or retournynge ye may show him your
busynes / by him ye may be addressed of all your complayntes / and sir we
pray to god that he may reward you of the honor that ye have done to us /
and sir we shall show your curtoysye to our king and to his counsel when we
return in to france / and also to the duke of Borbone who is our chief
capytayne whom we trust to se or we se the king / and then wine was brought
and they drank and took their leave of the king / and ye king rewarded them
largely and sent to each of them to their lodgyng goodly horses whereof they
had great joy.

THus these men of war passed through the royalme of Nauare and came to Groyne
/ and there demanded where they should find the king of Castle / and it was
showed them how he had lain at Valeolyue a great season / but as then they
said they thought he was at Burgus in Spain there making his prouysyon / then
they took the way to Burgus and left the way to Galyce / for that way was not
sure for them / for the English men were sore abroad in the country.
Tidings came to the king of Castle how socoures came to him out of france
to the nombre of.ii.M. speres / whereof he was right glad and so departed fro
Valeolyue and rode to Burgus with a.vi.M horse. Thus these frensshmen of arms
came to Burgus and lodged theraboute abroad in the country / and daily thither
came men of war And sir wyllyam of Lygnac / and sir Gaultyer of Passac came
to the king in to his palace / who received them swetely and thanked them of
the pain and great travail that they had taken for his sake as to come thither
to serve him. The knights made their reverence and said / sir if we may do
you any service to please you / our pains shall soon be forgoten / but sir
and it please you to take advise how we shall do / outher to ride against our
enemies or else to make them war by garysons till such season as the duke
of Borbon be come / and sir if it please you ye may send for sir Olyuer of
Clysquy we know well he is in his country and for sir Peter of Vyllaynes /
the Barroys of Bars / Chatell Morant and the other companyons who have
haunted this country more then we have done / for they were here long before
us / and then let us al counsel together and with gods grace you and your
royalme shall have honor and profit. Syrs said the king ye speak wisely and
thus shall it be done Then clerks were set a work and letters made and
messagers sent forth in to diverse places to the knights and men of war
there as they were spread abroad in the country / and when they knew that sir
Wyllyam of Lygnac and sir Gaultyer of Passac were at Burgus with the king they
were gretely rejoiced thereof / then these knights and other companyons
departed fro their garysons and left them in sure keeping / and so rode to
Burgus in spain / so that there was a great nombre of Frensshe men of war.

THen the king of Castle and his lords and knights of france went to
counsel together to se how they should maynteyne their war / for they knew
well their enemies rode abroad and kept ye feldes / wherefore they thought to
provide some remedy to the honor of the king and profit of the royalme of
Castle So there were many matters debated in this counsel / and then all
their people were nombred / and it was said that of the royalme self they
might well bring together a.xxx.M. horses and the men well armed after the
usage of Castle with darts and Iauelyns / and foot men casting stones out
of slings other.xxx.M. The frensshe knights among themself considered all this and said one to another this is a great nombre of people and they were
good men of war / but they be little worth / for we have seen such slowfulnes
in them that we have no great trust to them / as it appeared as well in the
battle of Marres where the prince of Wales had the vyctory as (...) ye battle
of Iuberoth where as the Portyngales and Gascoynes were / and always the
Spanyardes were dyscomfyted. Then the earl of Lune in susteynynge ye
Castellyans and in exscusynge of them said / syrs as to the battle of Marres I
shall answer you / it is of truth yt sir Bertram of Clysquy and a great
nombre of knights of France were there and fought valyauntly / for they were
all taken or slain / but ye have herd and ye know well that against them was
the flower of all the chyualry of the world both in wisdom valyauntnes and
prowes the which is not now with the duke of Lancaster / the prince at teh
battle of Marres had.x.M. speres and.vi.M. archers / they were such men that
there were a iii.M. of them every man worth a Rowlande or an Olyuere / but the
duke of Lancastre has none such / he passes not a.xii. or a.xv.C. speres /
and a.iiii.M. archers / and we be a. vi.M. speres / nor we shall not fight
against Rowlande nor Olyuer. Sir John^ Chandos / sir Thomas Felton / sir Olyuer
Clysson / sir Hughe Caurel / sir Richard Pountchardon / sir Garsis / the lord
of Ryeux / and sir Richard Dangle I could name.v.C. such that were there /
they be deed / we shall find none such now / Wherefore the matter is not so
peryllous as it was in time past / for if ye will believe me / we shall go fight
with them and pass the river of Derne / it shall turn us to great
valyauntnes The counsel that the earl of Lune did give was well herd / and
there were many that held ye same oppynyon / then sir Olyuer of Clysquy said
sir earl of Lune we know well all that ye have said proceeds of your great
wisdom and valyauntnes / but sir take it so that we goo and fight with the
duke of Lancastre / if that were all we should do well enough / but sir ye
leave ye grettest matter behind / as the king of Portyngale and his puyssau^ce
/ for as we be enfourmed they be a.xxv.C. speres / and.xxx.M. of other men of
war / for on the trust of the king of Portyngale ye duke of Lancastre is
entered in to Galyce and they have made a great alyaunce together / for the king
has married the dukes daughter / now sir what say you to this / in the name
of god said the earl of Lune ye knights of France are suffycyent to fight
with the duke of Lancastre / and the king of Castle and the Castellyans who
be as they say.xx.M. horse / and xxx.M. a foot / they may fight with the king
of Portyngale I dare well abide ye adventure among them / When the frensshmen
saw how the earl of Lune laid it so sore to their charge said sir ye be in ye
right and we be in ye wrong for sir we should have said as ye do / and sir let
it so be and you will / there is none of us shall say against your will /
syrs said the king I require you all counsel me truly and not in have nor
by pride / but by sad advise and humylyte / and then let us take the best way
/ I will not conclude to accept this journey / I will we mete again together to
morrow in this same chamber / and ye sir Wyllyam of Lygnac and sir Gaultyer of
Passac who are sent hyder in to this country by the frensshe king and by the
duke of Borbon / I require you go together and take advise and counsel me to
that shall be thought most best and honorable to me and to my royalme / for
it shall lie in you whether we shall fight with our enemies or not / They made
their reverence and said they would obey his commandment and so departed.

THus every man that day departed to their lodgings and the frensshmen as
they were together had great communycacyon some said we can not honorably fight
with our enemies till the duke of Borbon our sovereign capytayne be come / We
can not tell if he would fight with them or not / be it so that we fight with
them and have the vyctory / the duke of Borbou will be sore dyspleased with us
and specially with us that be the frensshe capytaynes / and if the fortune
should fall against us / we should then both lose our bodies and the royalme /
for if we were overthrown there were no recovery in the Castellyans but that
the king of Castle were like to lose all his royalme for this time / and we
should bear more fawte then any other for it should be laid how we had caused
the battle and gave no good counsel / nor also we be in no suretye if the
royalme be all sure on the kings party or not / or whether they have covertly
sent for the duke of Lancastre and his wife or not who is reputed for heir of
Castle / for she was daughter to king Don Peter all the world knows that
so that when the people se the duke and his wife with ye englysshmen in the
field demanding the crown of Castle affyrmynge how they have right thereto /
for king John^ who was king as then was sone to a bastard / then
peradventure they may turn to their part as they did in ye great battle of
Maures / and so should we abide deed in the field / so we think there is
double peril both to the king and to us / but such folysshe people give the
king counsel to battle and are herd before them that should speak / well
syrs said sir wyllyam of Lygnac and sir Gaultyer of Passac to morrow shall be
known every man's opinion. So that day and night the frensshmen were at
diverse communycacyons / and in like wise so were the spanyardes / Such as
loved the king would not counsel him to fight for diverse reasons one was if
he fought and lost the battle he lost his royalme without recovery / the king
himself thought it not good to fight / he fered sore the fortune of the war
/ nor also he knew not every man's mind who loved him and who did not. Thus
the matter rested till the next day then every man returned to the palace /
and the king entered in to counsel.

IN this counsel were many opynyons for every man to his power would truly
counsel the king / diverse counsayled him that he should not enclyne hastily
to battle / putting him in remembrance of the hard journey that he had at
Iuberoth where as the king of Portyngale dyscomfyted him / whereby he had such
damage that if such another chance should fall he should lose his royalme for
ever / when the king had demanded every man and herd all their oppynyons.
Then he said to sir wyllyam of Lygnacke and to sir Gaultyer of Passac / syrs
let me here your oppynyons for by you all shall be ordained seeing ye be the
chief capytaynes of the frensshe men sent hyder by the frensshe king and his
counsel. These.ii. knights regarded each other and sir Wyllyam said to sir
Galtyer / sir speak you / and he answered and said / nay I will not / speak you
/ ye have used arms more then I have done. Then sir Wyllyam aduysed himself
and said / sir and it like your grace me think ye ought gretely to thank the
noble chyualry of France / who are come hyder to serve you so far of / and
sir it has showed well how they have none affection nor will to be closed in
any cite or town castle / or garyson / that ye have. But they are and have been desirous to keep the feldes / and to find out / and to fight with your
enemies / the which thing now saving your grace can not be suffered for
diverse reasons / the pryncypall reason is / sir we tarry for the duke of Borbon
who is onr sovereign capytayne who will be here shortly and he shall gretely
enforce us with new fresshe men / there be many now here with us that were
never in this country before / it were necessary that they learned the manner of
this country a two or a three months / for it proves but seldom well to
hastily to fight with our enemies / But let us make wise war by garysons a
two or a three months / and let the Englysshemen and Portyngales ride abroad
in Galyce where they list / if they conquer certain towns it is but a small
matter / as soon as they be departed out of the country they will be soon
won again. Also sir there is one point / in arms lies many adventures /
sir let them ride abroad in the country which is hoote and of a strong air
/ they may take such travail and sykenes that they may happen repent them
that they have come so forward / for they shall not find the air so
attemperate there as it is in England or in france / nor the wynes so
pleasant / for in Galyce the ryuers be troublous and coolde because of the
snowes that dyscende down from the mountains whereby they and their horses
after their travail all the day in the hoote sone shall be morfoundred or
they be ware / they be not made of stele nor yet of iron / but at length they
shall not endure the hot country of Castle / they be men as we be. Thus I
think we can not better beat them / but to let them go where they list they
shall find nothing in the plain countries nor no delectable places to
refresshe them for as I understand all the open country is all ready dystroyed
with our own men / and I allow well that advise / for if it were to do I
would counsel the same / syrs if there be any here can speak better let him
speak / we shall be glad to here him / and this sir Gaultyer and I desire you
all thus to do / then they all answered with one voice / let this advise be
admytted / we can consider no better nor more profitable way / for the king of
Castle and his royalme.

SO it was there they concluded that they should make no countenance of war
till the duke of Borbon and all their prouysyons were come / but that their men
of war to be put in to diverse garysons on the fronters of their country and
suffer the englysshmen and Portyngales to go in and out in to the royalme of
Castle at their pleasure / saying how they could not bear away the
country with them when so ever they returned / thus ended the counsel / the
king of Castle had the same day all them at dinner with him in his palace at
Burgus in Spain / right plentyfull after the usage of Spain / by the next
day at none all the men of arms departed thither as they were appointed by
their capytaynes / sir Olyuer Clysquy and the earl of Longueuyle with a
thousand speres went to a strong town on the fronter of Galyce called
Vyllesaunte / and sir Raynolde and sir Trystram of Roye was sent to another
garyson a.x. legs fro he fronter of Galyce called Agyllar in the field with
three hundred speres / Sir Peter of Bellysme with two hundred speres went to
Pouelles / the vycount^ of Lune went to the town of Marolle / sir John^ of
Bars with three hundred speres was sent to the castle of Noye within Galyce.
Sir John^ of castle Morant and sir Trystram of Iayell and diverse other were
sent to the cite of Palance. And the vycount of Belyer went to the town of
Rybede and with him sir John^ of Braquen / and sir Robert of Braquen* Thus
these men of arms were divided / and sir Olyuer of Clysquy was made their
constable / and sir Wyllyam of Lygnac and sir Gaultyer of Passac abode still
with the king at Burgus / In this case standing was the busynes of Castle
abiding the coming of the duke of Borbon who was still in France making
prouysyon for his journey. Now we will suffer in rest a season the army of
Castle and of the duke of Lancastre and also of the king of Portyngale / and
when the time requires we shall return there to again. And now let us
speak of the adventures that fell in the same season in France and in england
the which were troublous and peryllous for both royalmes and sore
dyspleasaunt unto the kings and to both their counsayles.

How a great myscheffe fell in England between the gentle men and commons for
account of such money as had been raised of the commons. Ca. lxxxi.
HEre before ye have herd how the Frensshe army with ships on ye se that
were assembled at Sluse to have gone in to England was dasshed and broken up /
yet to show courage and desire to goo another season in to england / and that
it should not be said that the Frensshe men were recreaunt to have made that
voyage. Therefore it was ordained that incontinent at the enter of May and that
the sea might be fair and pleasant. The constable of France should make a
journey in to england with.iiii. M. men of arms and.ii.M. cross bows / and
they should all assemble together at a cite against the fronter of Cornwall
called Lentrygnyer and there to be made all their prouysyon and it was ordained
every man to have a horse the more easily to ^yde abroad in England / for it
was thought without horse they could make no war that should avail them /
so there was assembled at this haven of Lentygnyer a goodly apparel of
ships / barks / Bagengers and galeys well fournysshed with wynes / salt
flesh and bysquet and other things so largely that it was suffycyent for
them to live by a four or five months without taking or byenge of any
thing in the country for ye constable and his company knew well that as
soon as the English men knew of such a company of men of war coming on
them / they would dystroye their own goods abroad in the plain country
rather then we should have any case thereof. Therefore the constable made his
prouysyon ready on that side the sea. Also there was ordained another flete of
ships at the haven of Harflewe for the lord of Coucy / the lord of saint
Poule and the admyrall of France should there take shyppynge with two
thousand speres in likewise to goo in to England / and as the brute went all
this was done to draw back again the duke of Lancastre and the duches out of
Castle. The same season the duke of Borbon was at Paris and thought surely
that the duke of Lancastre should return home again in to England /
wherefore he though he should have no thing to do to go in to castle nor to
travail his body so far forth. So it was determined that in the Constables
army should goo / Bretons Augenyms / Poyetenyns Manceaus and Xayngrons / with
knights and squyers of the low marches / and with the lord of saint Poule
and with the lord of Coucy should go frensshmen / Normans / and Pycardes / and
with the duke of Borbon should goo two thousand speres of Berrey / Auuernake /
of Lymosyn / Borgoyne and of the bace marches. Thus in that season the matters
were concluded in France and every man knew what he should do / outher to go
in to England or in to Castle.

ANd true it was the royalme of England the same time was in great peril and
in a gretter ieoperdye then when the vyllaynes of Essex and Kent rebelled
against the king and the nobles of the royalme at which time they came unto
London / I shall show you the reason why / at that season all the noble men of
the royalme took one part together with the king against the commons / but now
it is not so / the nobles vary among themself. The king is against his own
uncles / the duke of york and the duke of Glocestre and they were against him
and all this varyaunce did rise by the means of the duke of Irelande who bare
all the chief rule about the king / and the commons of England in diverse
cytees knew well of this dyscorde / they that were sage men reputed it for a
great evil and fered that much trouble should grow thereby / but such as were
light persons made no reckoning thereof / some saying that it was for envy
that the kings uncles had against the king their nephewe / and because they
saw how the crown of England began to grow far of from them / and some
other said how the king was but young / and byleued young counsel / and how
that it were better for him to believe his uncles who mente no thing to him
but al honor and pro^yte nor to the royalme of England / rather then to be
ruled by the proud duke of Irelande who never saw any thing perteynynge to
honor / nor never was in any battle. Thus every man dyffered from other in
the royalme of England / Which trybulacyons were well known in France /
wherefore they made this great prouysyon to goo thither with all their puyssaunce
thinking to do a great feate / on the other side / the prelates of england
were in hatred one with another as the archebysshop of Cauntorbury who was of
the Neuelles blood / with the archebysshop of york. And yet they were country
men borne / but they hated mortally each other because the lord Neuell had
the rule and governance of Northumbrelande and so to the marches of Skotlande
above the earl of Northumbrelande and his children / the lord Henry and the
lord Raffe of Percy / which rule the lord Neuelles brother had gotten him /
for he was one of the chief about the king with the duke of Irelande.

Of the great dyscordes that were in England after the brekynge up of the
Frensshe army / army / and how the governors about the king were
constrained by the commons of the good towns to make accomptes of such money
as was come in to their hands the season that they ruled. Ca. lxxxii.
AS soon as the englysshmen knew that the voyage by the sea that the
frensshmen should have made being at Sluse was dasshed and broken. Then in
England began diverse murmuracyons in sundry places / and such as loved evil
rule rather then good / said / Where be now these great entrepryses and these
valiant men of england yt were in the days of king Edward the third / and
with the prince his sone / we were wont to go in to France and put back our
enemies in such manner that none durst make battle with us / if they did
they were soon dyscomfyted.

O What a deed was that when the noble king Edward aryued in Normandy / and
in Constantyne and passed through the royalme of France / and what goodly
entrepryse he acheued in his way / and after at Cressy he dyscomfyted king
Phylyp and all the puyssaunce of France / and or he returned he wan the town
of Calays / But as now the knights and men of war in England do none
such feats. Also the prince of Wales sone to this noble king / did he not
take the Frensshe king. John^ and dyscomfyted his pyssaunce at Poycters with a
small nombre of people against the people that king John^ had / In those
days England was fered and doubted / and were spoken of thrughe all the world
for ye flower of chyualry / but as now no man speaks of us / for now there
is no war made / but at poor men's purses / thereto every man is enclyned /
in France as now the king there is but a child and yet he has done more
against us then any of his predecessors. And also he showed great courage to
have come in to England / the let thereof was not by him / but by his men.
The time has been seen that if such an apparel of ships had been made at
Sluse they should have been foughten withal in their own haven / and now the
noble men of England are joyful when they may sytre at rest and suffer them
in peace / but yet for all that they suffer not poor men to be in rest / but
put them to busynes to pay money. The time has been that great conquestes have been done in france without payenge of any money / but such riches as has been
gotten there it has been spread abroad in the royalme. where is become ye great
fynaunces and tails that has been gadered in this royalme with the kings
rentes and accostomed revenues / outher they have lost it or taken fro them /
it is behouable that it be known how the royalme of England is governed /
and how the king is led / it were not good that it should be long or it
were known / for this royalme of England is not so rich nor so puyssaunt to
bear like charges as the royalme of France does. Also it appears well that we
in this royalme of england are febled of wits and of grace. We were wont to
know every thing that was done in France a three or four months or the
case fell / whereby we might conuenyently make prouysyon and resystence / but as
now we know no thing / But the Frensshe men knows all our secrets and
counsayles / we cannot tell in whom is the fawte / it will be known upon a
day. There be some preuy traitors / and it were better it were known betymes
then to late / for it may be known so la^e that it will be past remedy.

THus dyuersely men talked in England as well knights and squyers as the
commons so that the royalme lay in a hard case and great peril. And the
great assembly that the king and his uncles and his counsel had made with
great expense in diverse manners to resyst the frensshe king being a Sluse ready
to enter in to England / such knights and squyers / and other as were in a
redynes would as then be paid of their wages / and so for that entente there
was a parlyamente somoned to be holden at London by the nobles / prelates / and
commons of England / and pryncypally it was ordained that there should be
raised a great tail and subsydye thrughe out the royalme of England / the
rich to bear out the poor. This parlyament was removed to westmynstre / and
thither came all such as were sent for / and many moo to here tidings. There
was the king and his two uncles Edmunde and Thomas with many other nobles of
the royalme. And among other things yt was said that in the kings treasoure
there was substance skante to maynteyne the kings estate soberly. Wherefore
they of his counsel said how there must be leuyed a subsydye thrughe out all
the royalme of England if such costs and charges should be paid as has been done / for the defense of the royalme of england against the frensshe men.
To this agreed well they of the bysshopryche of Norwyche / and also the
archebysshopryche of Cauntorbury / and the countye of Essex / the countye of
Hampton and Warwykeshyre / and the land of ye earl of Salysbury / they agreed
sooner then they of ferther countries as they of the north and marches of Wales
/ and of Cornwall / al these rebelled and said / We have not seen none of our
enemies come in to this country / why should we be grieved and have done no
fawte / yes yes said some let the bishop of york be spoken withal and the
kings counsel / and the duke of Irelande who has.lx. thousand frankes of
the constable of france for the redempcyon of Johan of Bretayne / this money
ought to be turned to the common profit of all England. ye and speak with sir
Simon Burle / Sir Wyllyam Helmen / Sir Thomas Branbe / Sir Robert Tryuylyen /
and sir Johan Beauchampe who have governed the king and the royalme / if they
make a good account of that they have received and deliver it / the commons
shall sytte in rest / and every thing paid as it ought to be. When these
words came abroad and to the herynge of the kings uncles / they were right
glad thereof / for that made well for them / for all those before named were
against them. Nor they could bear no rule in the court for them. Wherefore
they aided the people in their oppynyons and said. These good men that thus
speaks are well counsayled / in that they desire to have account / and will
not pay any more money. For surely outher in the kings treasure / or else in
their purses that govern him there must needs be great treasure. Thus by
little and little multyplyed these words / and the people began to wax
bold to deny to pay any more money by reason that they saw the kings uncles
of their accord / and sustained them. And the archebysshop of Cauntorbury /
the earl of Salysbury / the earl of Northumbrelande / and diverse other lords
of England put of this tax for that time and deferred their counsel to
Myghelmasse after / at which time they promised to return again / but the
knights and squyers such as had thought to have had money for the arrerages
of their wages had no thing / Wherefore / they were in dyspleasure with the
king and his counsel. They were apeased as well as might be / and every man
departed / the king took no leave of his uncles / nor they of him.

THen the king was counsayled to draw in to the marches of Wales and there to
tarry till he herd other tidings / and so he was content to do / and
departed fro London without leave taking of any man / and took with him all his
counsel except the archebysshop of york who went back in to his ^^ne
country / which was happy for him / for I think if he had been with the
other / he should have been served as they were / as ye shall here after. But it
is requysyte that I speak as well of France as of England / for the matter
requires it.

How the constable of France and diverse other lords and squyers of the
royalme apparelled great prouysyons to go in to England to win towns and
castelles. Ca. lxxxiii.
ANd when season of somer was come and the ioly month of May in the year of
our lord god. M.CCC. four score and.vii. In the same season that the duke of
Lancastre was in Galyce / and conquered there / and that ye king of Portyngale
with great puyssaunce rode abroad in Castle without any withstanding. Then
was it ordained in France as ye have herd before how the constable of
France with one army / and the earl of saint Poule / the lord of Coucy and
sir Johan of Vyen with another army / the one at Lentrygnyer in Bretayne / and
the other at Harflewe in Normandy should the same season make a voyage in to
england with a.vi. thousand men of arms and two thousand cross bows /
and.vi. thousand other men of war / and it was ordained that none should
pass the sea to goo in to England without he were well armed / and prouysyon
of vytayles for the space of three months with other prouysyon of hay and
ootes for their horses and a day was prefyxed among the capytaynes when they
should depart / and were determined to land in england in two havens at
Dover / and at Orwell / thus the day approached of their departure. At
Lentrygnyer prouysyon was made and put in to the ships for them that should
pass from thens / and in like wise was done at Harflewe / and every man of war
was paid their wages for.xv. days. This journey was so far forward / that
it was thought it could not have been broken. Nor also it brake not by no
cause of the capytaynes that were ordained to goo in that voyage. But it brake
by another incydent and by a meruayllous matter that fell in Bretayne wherewith
the Frensshe king and his counsel were soore dyspleased / but they could
not amend it / wherefore it behooved them wisely to dyssymule ye matter for it
was no time then to remedy it. Also other tidings came unto the Frensshe king
out of the parties of Almayne as I shall show you hereafter when time and
place shall require it. But first we will speak of the matters of Bretayne
before them of Almayne / for they of Bretayne fell first / and were worste
reputed / though other cost more.

IF I should say that such matters fell in that season and not open clearly
the matter which was great / peryllous and horrible / it might be a cronycle /
but n^o hystory / I might let it ouerpasse if I list / but I will not do so /
I shall declare the case sith god has given me the knowledge thereof / and
time and leisure to cronycle the matter at length. ye have herd here before
in diverse places in this hystory how sir John^ of Mountforde named duke of
Bretayne / and surely so he was by conquest and not by right line / howbeit
always he maynteyned the war and oppynyon of the king of England and of
his chydren against the frensshe king. Also he had good cause so to do on
his party / for without the aid of england he had not atteyned as he did
another before Alroy nor in other places. Also ye have herd here before how
the duke of Bretayne could not have his entente of all the nobles of his
country / nor of all the good towns specially of sir Bertram of Clesquy as
long as he lived / nor of sir Olyuer of Clysson constable of France / nor of
the lords de la Vale / and of Beawmanoyre / nor the lord of Raze / of Dygnant
/ the vycount of Rohan / nor of the lord of Rochforde / for whereas these
lords enclyned nyghe all Bretayne followed. They were content to take part
with their lord the duke against all manner of men except against the crown
of France. And surely I can not se nor ymagyne by what way / but that the
Bretons pryncypally regarded ever the honor of France / it may well appear
by that that is written here before in this hystory. I say not this by no
corrupcyon nor favor that I have to the earl Guy of Bloys who has been good
lord unto me / and I have had much profit by him who was nephewe and next
to the earl Loys of Bloys brother germayne to saint Charles of Bloys / and as
long as he lived he was duke of Bretayne. Truly I say not this for no cause
but all only to declare the truth And also the gentle prince and earl that
has caused me to write this story would in no wise that I should swerve from
the troth.

Now to return to our purpose ye know well as long as duke Johan of
Bretayne lived he could never attain to have all his men in every point to
agree to his oppynyons. And he sore fered them lest at the last they should
have taken him and put him in prison in France. Wherefore he departed out of
Bretayne and went in to England with all his householde / and ye lady his
wife Iahan of Holande daughter sometime of the good knight sir Thomas Holande /
and thus a season he became servant to king Richard of England / and
afterward he went in to Flaunders to ye earl of Bloys who was his cosyn
germayne and there tarried more then a year and an half. Finally they of his
own country sent for him / and so by good accord thither he went. And when
he came in to his country there were certain towns closed still against him
and rebelled / and specially the cite of Nauntes. But all his lords / knights
and prelates were all of his accord except the lords before rehearsed / and
to have the sygnory of them / and to get the favor and good will of the good
towns and Cytyes / and to put the Frensshe king in more fere because he would
ouerpresse them with taxes and subsydyes as they did in France and in Pycardye
which they would not suffer in Bretayne. Therefore he sent unto the king of
England for socoure and aid of men of war and archers / promising that if
the king of England would come in too Bretayne / or else one of his uncles
with a great puyssaunce of men of arms and of archers how that his country
of Bretayne should be opened ready to receive him and his company. The king of
England and his counsel were glad of those tidings and thought them good
and concluded to send thither / the^ prouysyon was made / and thither was sent
the earl of Buckyngham with.iii. M. men of arms and.viii. M. archers who
aryued at Calays / and passed through the royalme of France without any
resystence as it has been showed here before demanding no thing but
battle / and so they came in to Bretayne trusting to have found the country
ready open for them to receive and to refresshe them / for ^^rely they had made
a long voyage. Howbeit they found it contrary dysposed / for the duke of
Bretayne was so led by his men and so wisely entreated that they made a peace
between him and the young Charles king as then in france / but with king
Charles his fader he could never have peace he hated him so sore. The duke of
Borgoyne who was one of the chese governors in the royalme of France aided
gretely to make this peace / he was so desired by the lady his wife because the
duke of Bretayne was nere of their lygnage so he was feign to break all his
promyses with the Englysshmen for he could not be suffered to accomplysshe his
covenant / for the Bretons would not consent to yield them to the king of
England to make war against France / they said they were never of that
oppynyon nor never would be / so that it behooved the Englysshmen to take their
lodgings in ye marches of wannes where they suffered as much pouerte as ever
did men for one time / and specially their horses dyed for hungre and pouerte /
and so in the time of somer they departed out of Bretayne as evil content
with the duke of Bretayne as might be / and not without a cause. And specially
the earl of Buckyngham and the barons of England that were in his company /
and when they were returned in to England they made great complayntes to the
king and to the duke of Lancastre and his counsel. And then it was devised
and ordained that John^ of Bretayne should be delivered / and to bring him
with puyssaunce in to Bretayne to make war there against the duke of Bretayne
/ and the English men said how sir John^ of Mountforde knew well how they
had put him in possessyon of the sygnory of Bretayne for without us he had
never come thereto. And now to play us this turn to cause us to travail our
bodies and to spend the kings treasoure / it behooves us to show him his
fawtes. And we can not better be revenged then to deliver his adversary and to
bring him in to Bretayne / For all the country will deliver him towns Cytees
/ and fortresses / and put the other duke clean that thus has mocked and
dysceyued us. Thus the English counsel were all of one accord / and then
John^ of bretayne was brought in to the kings presence / and there it was
showed him how they would make him duke of Bretayne and recover for him all
his heritage of Bretayne. And he should have to his wife the lady Phylyp of
Lancastre / so that he would hold the duchy of Bretayne in faith and homage of
the king of England / the which point he utterly refused. But to take the
dukes daughter in marriage he was content / But to swear to be against the
crown of france in no wise he would consent / but rather to abide in prison
all his life.

WHen the king and his counsel saw that / they withdrewe the grace that
they had thought to have showed to him / and then he was delivered in to
the keeping of sir Johan Dambretycourte as ye have herd before / I have made
as now relacyon of all these matters because of the incydentes that followed
after and appeared by the duke of Bretayne / for the duke knew well how he was
gretely out of the favor of the noble men of the royalme of England / and
also of the commons there. And he ymagened that the hatred that they bare to him
was for the voyage that the earl of Buckyngham had made thrughe France to
come in to Bretayne / wenynge to have found the duke there and country open
against them / as the duke of Bretayne had promised / which the English
men found contrary. Also he saw well how the king of England had not
written unto him so amyably as he had done often times before. And specially
as he had done before the earl of Buckynghams voyage. And also he doubted
that the king of England should deliver Johan of Bretayne to the entente to
make him war. Then the duke cast his ymagynacyon how he might find remedy
in this matter / and to bring it in to a good point / And to do his entente
so secretly that the English men should be well content and pleased with
him. For he knew well the man in the world whom the Englysshmen hated most
was sir Olyuer of Clysson constable of france. For in deed sir Olyuer of
Clysson ever studied night and day how he might do dyspleasure to the
English men / and the duke knew right well of the army that was made to god
in to England bocke at Harflew: and at Lentrygnyer / then he said unto
himself to the entente to please the English men and to show that he did
not set much by the Frensshe men / he found the means to break that voyage
not in commaundynge his men of Bretayne on pain of lesynge of their heritage
not to go in to England / nor to aid the frensshe party this he did not /
but he showed outwardly that the war was for him / but he did his entrepryse
more covertly / he cast in his ymagynacyon that he might not do more
honorably / nor more to his profit / then to take the constable of France
prisoner or else to slay him / thereby he knew well he should please the
English men / for they hated him / for he thought if he were out of the way
he cared not for the resydue of his lygnage / for he knew well they were not
able to make him war / for the constable had but two daughters / the one
was married unto John^ of Bretayne / and the other daughter was maryded unto the
earl of Rohans sone / he thought to withstand them well enough and all his
lygnage / for if he had slain him he said he had slain but a baron and
that there were none that would make him any war for his sake.

How the duke of Bretayne sent for all his lords and knights to come to
counsel unto wannes and after counsel he desired the constable to goo and
se his castle of Ermyne / and how he took him there prisoner / and the lord
of Beaumanoyre with him. Ca. lxxxiii.
ON this foresaid ymagynacyon the duke of Bretayne rested / and to come to his
entente he somoned his counsel to come to Wannes / and desired all the lords
and knights of Bretayne effectuously for to come thither / and he did send out
his letters unto them / and specially he required sir Olyuere of Clysson
Constable of France that he should not fail but for to be there / saying
how he would gladlyer se him then any other. The constable would not exscuse
himself because the duke of Bretayne was his natural lord / and was glad
to have his good will / and so he came to Wannes / and so did a great
nombre of other lords of Bretayne. This counsel was long and many matters
debated therein touching the duke and his country without any word speaking
of the voyage that they were in purpose to make in to England. The duke
dyssymuled the matter. This counsel was in the cite of wannes in a castle
called the Mote.

The duke made all the lords a great dinner / and fed them with fair loving
words till it was nere night / and then they returned to their lodgings in
to the subbarbes without the cite. And the constable of France to please the
knights and squyers of Bretayne he desired them all the next day to dyne
with him some did so and some departed to their own howses to take leave of
their wives and parents / for the constable was purposed as soon as h^
departed thens straight to goo unto his nau^e at Lentrygnyer / the duke of
Bretayne knew it right well / but spoke no word thereof making semblaunte as
though he knew no thing. So this dinner ended where as were the most part
of the barons of Bretayne / and suddenly unto them came the duke of Bretayne
right amorously by semynge / but he thought otherwise in his heart. None knew
thereof but such as he had dyscouered his mind unto. As soon as he entered
in to the constables lodging / some said / behold here comes the duke / then
every man rose as reason was and swetely received him as they ought for to do
their lord / and he delte right getylly and he sat down among them and ete
and drank / and kept good company and showed them more tokens of love then
ever he did before / and he said unto them / fair lords my lovers and
friends / god send you well to goo and well to come again / and send you
joy / and that you may do such deeds of arms as may / please you / and
that it may be honorable unto you all / and when they herd these swear
words of the duke / they all answered and said. Sir we thank you / and god
reward you of your great kyndnesse that it pleases you to come and se us at
our departing.

THis same season the duke of Bretayne was making of a Castle nere to Wannes
called the castle of Ermyne the which as then was nere furnysshed and to the
entente to attrappe the constable / there he said unto him and unto the lord
de la vale and to the lord of Beawmanoyre and to other lords that were there.
Syrs I require you or ye depart to come and se my new castle of Armyne / ye
shall se how I have devised it / and also how I purpose for to do. They all
agreed unto him / because they saw him come so louyngly among them / for
they thought none evil. And so the most part of them mounted on their
horses and rode forth with the duke to the castle of Armyne. Than the duke /
the constable the lord de la vale / and the lord of Beawmanoyre and diverse
other lords and knights alyghted of their horses and entered in to the castle
/ and the duke led the constable by ye hand fro chamber to chamber and in to
every house of office and made them drink in the seller. Then the duke brought
them to the chief tower and at the door thereof he said to the constable. Sir
Olyuere I know no man on this side the sea that knows more in building
then ye do / wherefore I pray you mount up the stayres and behold the
building of the tower / if it be well I am content / and if any thing be
amysse / yt shall be reformed after your deuyse / ye constable thinking none
evil said. Sir with right a good will please it you to goo before and I shall
follow you / nay sir said the duke goo your way up alone and in the mean
time I will talk with the lord de la vale / the constable went up the
stayres and when he was above and paste the first stage / there were me^ in a
chamber laid in a busshment and they opened the door / and some wents down
and did shote the door bynethe and the other went up all armed to the
constable / there they took and led him in to a chamber and fetered him
with.iii. boltes of iron / and said to him / Sir pardon us for we must needs do
that we do / we be thus commanded by our lord the duke of Bretayne / if ye
constable were abashed at that time it was no marvel.

THe constable ought not to have great marvel of ye chance for after that
the dyspleasure fell between the duke and him / for any letters that the duke
could write to him or for any desire or saufconduyte to come and goo saufely /
yet for all that the constable would never come in the dukes presence / for he
durst not trust him / and now he is come to his mysfortune / for he found
the duke in great dyspleasure with him / and that was well showed / and when
the lord de la vale being bynethe at the stayre foot saw the door closed /
his blood began to trymble and had great fere of his brother and beheld the
duke who waxed pale and grene as a lefe / then he knew that the matter went
amysse and said. A sir for gods sake have mercy / what will you do / take
none evil will against the constable / sir said the duke / take ye your horse
and depart / ye may goo when ye will / I know well enough what I have to
do. Sir said the lord de la vale I will not de part hens without I have my
brother the constable with me / with those words there came unto them the lord
of Beawmanoyre whom the duke also hated / and he in like wise demanded to
have the constable. Then the duke drew his dagger and came unto him and said.
Beawmanoyre will thou be in the same point as thy master is in. Sir said he
I trust my master is in good case / well said the duke / I demand of the if
thou will be in like case. ye sir said he. Then the duke took his dagger by
the point and said / if thou will be in like case it behooves the to put out
one of thine eyes. The lord of Beawmanoyre saw well the matter went not well
and saw the duke wax pale for anger. Then he kneled down on his knee and
said. Sir I repute so great noblenes in you that I trust in god and you that
ye will do us right / we be at your mercy / and we are come hyder at your
request / we trust ye will not dishonor yourself^e to accomplysshe any evil
will that ye have to us / it should be a strange nouelte. Well said the duke
come on thy way / for thou shalt have no more nor no less then he shall
have. So he was led in to another chamber and fetered also with three pair
of yrons / If he were abashed he had a great cause / for he perceived well
the duke loved him but little / nor the constable also / but then he had no
remedy.

AN one tidings spredde over the castle and also the town how that the
constable of France and the lord of Beawmanoyre and also the lord de la Vale
were taken prisoners. And how the lord de la Vale might depart when he would
/ For the duke demanded no thing of him / whereof the people had great
marvel and also great cause why / for every man said how the duke would put
them both to death / he hated them so mortally. The duke was gretely blamed of
all knights and squyers that herd thereof / and they said there was never a
gretter dyffamacyon on any prince then was on the duke of Bretayne seeing that
he had desired the constable to dyne with him and to se his house / and to make
him good chere and so to take him prisoner / they said they never herd of
case like / wherefore he was infamed and never man more dishonored / nor thereby
no man should trust in any prince sith the duke had dysceyued these noble men
/ what will the frensshe king say when he knows this / for by this his
voyage in to England is broken / there was never so great a shame ymagyned /
but now the duke shows what lay in his heart / we tro we there was never
seen in Bretayne case like nor in none other place / if a poor knight had done
such a deed he were dishonored for ever / in whom should a man trust but in
his lord / and ye lord should maynteyne him in his right and do him Justice
/ who shall make correccyon of this deed / none but the frensshe king / now
ye duke shows plainly how he is on the english part and will sustain and
hold with the oppynyon of the king of England / sith he has thus broken the
voyage by the sea that should have gone in to England / What shall become now
of the knights and squyers of Bretayne when they shall here these tidings
nothing but in contynent come fro their houses and lay syege to the castle of
Armyne and close the duke within and there tarry till they have taken him outher
deed or quycke and led him like a false prince to the frensshe king. Thus the
knights and squyers about the marches of Wannes spoke and comoned together /
and such as were come thither to that counsel with the said lords / and they
were in great doubt that the duke would put them to death / then some other
said / as for the lord de la Vale is in no ieopardy / he is so wise that he
will tempre the duke in all his busynes / and truly so he did / for and he had
not ben the constable had been deed the first night if he had had a. M. lives.

IT ought to be byleued that sir Olyuer of Clysson was not at his case when he
saw himself so taken and attrapped / and fetered and kept with.xxx. persons
/ and had no comfort by them / for they knew not the will of their lord /
so that he rekened himself but as a deed man / and also he had no hope to
live till the next day / and surely he was in great daungere / for.iii. times
he was vnfetered and brought to have been beheded or else drowned / and surely
so he had been if the lord de la vale had not ben / but when this lord de la
vale herd the dukes strayte commandment to put him to death / he kneled
down before him lyftynge up his hands sore weeping and said sir for gods
sake take mercy / advise you show not your cruelte against the constable / he
has deserved no death / sir of your grace that it may please you to show me
the cause of your dyspleasure against him / and sir I swear unto you any
trespace that he has done he shall make you such amends with his body and
goods / or else I for him as ye yourselfe shall demand or Judge / sir
remember you how in your yongth ye.ii. were companyons together and brought up
both in one house with the duke of Lancastre who was so gentle a prince that
there was none like him. Also sir remember how before his peace was made with
the frensshe king always he truly served you / he aided you to recover your
heritage / ye have always found in him good comfort and counsel / if ye be
now moved or enfourmed against him otherwise then reason should require / yet
he has not deserved death / sir de la vale said the duke let me have my will
/ for Olyuer of Clysson has so often times dyspleased me / and now is the
hour come that I may show him my dyspleasure. Wherefore depart you hens and
let me show my cruelte / for I will he shall dye. A sir said the lord de la
vale / refrain your evil will and moderate your courage and regard to reason
/ for if ye puth ym to death there was never prince so dishonored as ye shall
be / there shall not be in Bretayne knight nor squire cite nor castle nor good
town / nor no man but he shall hate you to the death / and do that they can
to dysenheryte you / Nor the king of England nor his counsel shall give you
no thank therefore / sir will you lose your self for the death of one man / sir
turn your ymagynacyon / for this thought is no thing worth but
dyshonourable / that ye should cause such an honorable knight as sir Olyuere
of Clysson is to dye coming unto you at your own desire. Surely sir this deed
should be treason and great reproach both before god and the world / to
desire him thus to dinner and he coming to you / and after that ye went to him
in to the town desiring him to se your new buyldynges / and he obeyed in
every thing to you and drank of your wine / and is this ye great love that ye
showed him / to put him to death / there was never so great blame laid to any
lord as shall be laid to you / all ye world shall reproach you and hate you
mortally and be glad to make you war. But sir I shall show you what ye shall
do sith ye so sore hate him / put him to ransom to a great some of Floreynes
this ye may well do / and if he hold outher town or castle that should be
yours demand the^ again and ye shall have them / and look what covenant ye
make with him I shall become pledge therefore / and when the duke herd the
lord de la vale speak so reasonably and pressed so sore on him / as in a manner
all that night he would not depart from him / then the duke studied a little
and somewhat refrayned his evil will / and at last spoke and said / sir de la
vale ye be a good mean for him / howbeit I will ye know sir Olyuer of Clysson
is the man in the world that I most hate / for and ye were not he should not
skape without death this same night / your words has saved him / go to him
and demand if he will pay to me a. C. M. frankes incontynente / for I will
another have him nor you to pledge nor nothing else but the ready money / and
beside that to yield to me.iii. castelles and a town such as I shall name /
the castle of Breath / the castle of Iosselyn / the castle of blancke and the
town of Iugon and put me in possessyon of them or my deputyes / this done I
shall deliver him to you / this shall be done said the lord de la vale / and
sir I thank you that ye will thus do at my desire / and sir be you sure all
that ye have demanded shall be done / these castelles and town delivered and
these. C. M frankes paid or he depart.

THen the lord de la vale was gretely rejoiced when he saw the constable out
of peril of death. Then the tower door was opened and ye lord de la vale
mounted up and came there as ye constable was syttyng sore abashed for he
looked for nothing but for death / and when he saw the lord de la vale his
heart reuyued and thought there was some tretye in hand. Then the lord de la
vale said to them that were there by syrs take of his yrons yt I may speak
with him fro the duke and said to him / sir how say you will you do that I
shall show you / ye truly sir said the constable / then his yrons were taken
of / and the lord de la vale drew him a part and said. Fair brother with
great pain and much busynes I have saved your life and made your end / but
ye must pay or ye depart hens in ready money a. C. M. frankes and more over to
yield up to the duke.iii. castelles and ye town of Iugon / otherwise ye can
have no delyueraunce / then the constable said I will not refuse ye bargayne /
but who shall go to Clysson to fetch this money / fair brother said the
constable I think ye must be feign to go therefore Nay sir not so said the
lord de la vale / for I have promised never to depart out of this castle
till I have you with me / for I know well the duke is right cruel / and
peradventure in mine absence will repent him by some light informacyon and so
then al were lost / why who shall go then said the constable / sir said he the
lord of Beawmanoyre shall goo / he is here in prison as well as ye be / he shall
make all this prouysyon / that is well said said the constable / go your way
down / and ordeyne every thing as ye list.

How the constable of France was delivered at the request of the lord de la
vale payenge certain ransom / and how the constable delivered to the
duke.iii. castelles and a town and paid. C. M. frankes. Ca. lxxxv.
THus the lord de la vale went down of the tower to ye duke who was going
to bed / for of all that night he had not slepte / then the lord de la vale
kneled down and said / sir ye shall have al your demand / but sir ye must
deliver the lord of Beawmanoyre that he may speak with ye constable / for he
must go and fetch this ransom and put your men in possessyon of the
castelles that ye desire to have / well said the duke deliver them out of prison
and put them into a chamber / and be you the mean of their tretye / for I will
not se them / and return again to me when I have slepte and I will speak
with you Then ye lord de la vale issued out of the chamber and went with two
knights thither where as the lord of Beawmanoyre was in prison / who was
gretely abashed and doubted sore the death / he fered when he herd the door
open that they were come to have put him to death / But when he saw the lord
de la vale enter his heart reuyued / and more when he herd him speak saying /
sir of Beawmanoyre your delyueraunce is made / wherefore ye may be glad then
his fetters were taken of / and so he went in to another chamber / and then
the constable was also brought thither / and mete and wine was brought to them /
for all the servants of the house were glad of their delyueraunce / for
they were sorry of that case / howbeit they might find no remedy / it behooved
them to obey their masters commandment in right or in wrong / and as soon
as the castle gate was shote and the bridge drawn / there entered nor issued
another man nor woman / for the keys were in the dukes chamber / and he slepte
till it was.iii. of the clock / and the knights and squyers that were without
abiding for their masters were sore abashed and said. Now our season and
voyage by the sea is lost and broken A constable what myshap is fallen to you
what counsel has dysceyued you / the counsel ye was made and assembled at
Wannes was made for none other entente but to atrappe you / ye were wont to be
of the oppynyon that if the duke had sent for you and had made you a. M.
assuraunces / yet ye would not have gone nor come at his commandment / ye
doubted him so sore / and now ye went symply at his desire / every man
thrughe the duchy of Bretayne complained for the constable and wist not what to
do nor say / and all knights and squyers said / what do we here / why do we
not go and enclose the duke in his castle of Ermyne / and if he have slain the
constable / serve him in like manner / and if he keep him in prison let us do
so that we may have him again / there fell never such a myschefe in
Bretayne / thus one and other said / But there were none that styred forward
but tarried to here other news. Thus tidings spread abroad so that within two
days it was at Paris / wherewith the king and his uncles the duke of Berrey
and the duke of Borgoyne had great marvel / as then ye duke of Borbon was
gone to Aupgnyon to go in to Castle and had seen the pope Clement on his way /
these tidings came to him as he was at Lion sure le Rone / and with him the
earl of Sauoy.

ANd the earl of saint Poule / the lord of Coucy and admyrall of france
being at Harflewe ready to have entered in to the sea toward their voyage when
they herd how the duke of Bretayne had taken the constable of france
prisoner in his castle of Ermyne / and the lord de la vale and the lord of
Beawmanoyre with him. And they that brought those tidings said how the bruyte
ran in Bretayne how the duke of Bretayne had put to death the constable
of France / and the lord of Beawmanoyre. These were hard tidings to these
lords / and they said. Now our voyage is broken / let us give leave to all
our men of war to depart and let us goo to Paris to the king and se what he
will do / then ye admyrall said / it is good we do so / but let not our men
depart / peradventure the king will send them to some other part / may
happen in to Castle for ye duke of Borbon is going thither / or else
peradventure he will send them in to Bretayne to make war against the duke.
think you yt ye frensshe king will suffer ye matter thus to ouerpas. Nay
surely for ye king shall receive by this bergayne damage to the some of.ii. C.
M. floreynes beside ye loss and hurt that is done to his constable / if he
escape the life was there ever case like. Thus ye king to break his voyage who
was in good mind to have done damage to his enemies. Let us tarry here still
a.ii. or.iii. days / and peradventure we shall here some other tidings out of
france or out of Bretayne.

How wrytynges were made at the duke of Bretaynes deuyse / for the constable
to render his town and castelles to the duke / and to his heirs for ever /
and how they were delivered to the duke. Ca. lxxxvi.
How let us speak a little of the duke of Bretayne who when he had slepte
rose and made him ready / and then he sent for the lord de la vale who came to
him / and there they were together a long space. Finally letters were written
according to the dukes will / making mencyon yt the constable sir Olyuer of
Clysson renounced clean his title for ever of the said town and castle and
yielded them purely to the duke of Bretayne and to his heirs for ever / and
that / these wrytynges should be permanent without any repel / and then ye
lord of Beawmanoyre was ordained by the constable to goo to these castelles
and to cause them that had the rule of them to depart thens / and to put in
possessyon ye dukes men / and beside that to leuy in ready money a.C.M. frankes
to pay to the duke. When all this was concluded the gates of the castle was
opened and the lord of Beawmanoyre issued our charged and ordained by ye
constable to accomplysshe all these ordeynaunces / and he was desired to make
all the dylygence that might be And with him went servants of the dukes / and
noysed as they went how the constable was sure of his life ^and was put to
ransom / all such as loved him knights and squyers were glad thereof and so
thereby sat still / for they were determined to have gone and laid syege to
the castle of Ermyne and have closed the duke therein / they never did thing
that they would have been gladder of. So these tidings ran abroad with the
wind / so that the lords and knights being at Harflewe herd thereof and had
certain knowledge that the constable had been deed and the lord de la vale had
not ben / and they said as for the delyueraunce of his town and castelles he
shall recover them again / or else other at time and leisure / the frensshe
king has ynowe for him if he need. Now we may depart fro hens / our voyage
is broken let us give our men leave to depart / and let us goo to Paris and
learn tidings there / for we here say that all such as were at Lentrygnyer
are countermaunded / ye which is a sign that we shall go no where at this
season / thus they gave license to al their men of war to depart and
themself departed toward Paris where the king was.

THe lord of Beawmanoyre did so much that within.iiii. days he had set the
duke of Bretaynes servants in possessyon of the foresaid castelles and town
of Iugon / and after he paid the.C.M. frankes for the constables ransom
there as the duke commanded when all was done the lord de la vale said to ye
duke / sire have now that you demanded the.C.M. frankes the town of Iugon /
the castle of Boureke and the white castle of Iosselyn / therefore sir now
deliver me the constable I am content said the duke let him goo when he will I
give him leave / thus ye constable was delivered and he and the lord de la vale
departed fro the castle of Ermyne / when they were abroad in the feldes / ye
constable made no long taryenge in Bretayne / but mounted on a good horse and
his page on another and so rode that within two days he came to Paris and
alyghted at his own house and then went to the castle of Lowre to the king
and his uncles the duke of Berrey and of Borgoyne / his men followed after him
at their leisure / the king knew of his delyueraunce / but he knew not that
he was so nere / and was glad when he herd thereof and caused the chamber doors
to be set open against him and so he came in to the kings presence and kneled
down before him and said. Right redoubted lord / your fader whom god pardon
made me constable of France / which office to my power I have well and truly
exercysed and if there be any except your grace and my lords your uncles that
will say that I have not acquyted myself truly or done any thing contrary to
the crown of france I am here ready to cast my gage in that quarrel / the
king nor none other made none answer to those words / then he said further /
right dear sir and noble king it fortuned in Bretayne in doing of mine office
/ the duke of Bretayne took me and held me in his castle of Ermyne / and
would have put me to death without reason by reason of his fyers courage / and
god had not ben and the lord de la vale / so that I was constrained if I would
be delivered out of his hands / to deliver to him a town of mine in Bretayne
and iii. castelles / and the some of a.C.M. frankes / Wherefore right dear sir
and noble king the blame and damage that the duke of Bretayne has done
gretely regards your mageste royal for y^ voyage that I and my company
should have made by the sea is broken / Wherefore sir I yield up the office of
the constableshyp / sir provide for another such as shall please you / for I
will no more bear the charge thereof / I should have none honor to do it.
Constable said the king we know well that ye have hurt and damage and is a
thing gretely to the preiudyce to our royalme. We will incontynente send for
the peers of France to se what shall be best to be done in this case /
therefore take ye no thought for ye shall have right and reason. Then the king
took the constable by the hand and raised him up and said. Constable we will
not that ye depart from your office in this manner But we will that ye use it
till we take other counsel. Then the constable kneled down again and said.
Sir this matter touches me so nere that I cannot use it. The office is great
/ for I must speak and answer every man and I am so troubled that I can
answer no man. Wherefore sir I require your grace to provide for another for a
season / and I shall always be ready at your commandment / sir said the duke
of Borgoyne he offers enough ye shall take advise / it is true said the
king. Then the constable arose and went to the duke of Berre and to the duke
of Borgoyne and aduysed to show them his busynes / and to inform the^ justly
all the matter / seeing the case touched them gretely in that they had the
gouernynge of the royalme / but in speaking with them and herynge the hole
matter / they perceived ye matter touched not them so sore as he made of / so
that finally they blamed him for going to Wannes / saying to him / sith your
navy was ready and that knights and squyers tarried for you at Lentrygnyer. And
also when ye were at Wannes and had dyned with the duke and returned again
to your castle of Bourke / what had you then any thing to do to tarry there
any longer nor to goo again to the duke to the castle of Ermyne. Sir said the
constable he showed me so fair semblaunt that I durst not refuse it.
Constable said the duke of Borgoyne / in fair semblauntes are great decepcyons
/ I repute you more subtel then I take you now / go your way / y^ matter shall
do well enough / we shall regard it at leisure. Then the constable perceived
well that these lords were harder and ruder to him then the king was. So he
departed and went to his own lodging / and thither came to him certain of
the lords of the parlyament to se him and said to him that the matter should
do right well / and also there came to him to counsel him the earl of saint
Poule / the lord of Coucy and the admyrall of France / and they said to him
Constable make no doubt / for ye shall have reason of the duke of Bretayne /
for he has done against the crown of France great dyspleasure and worthy to
be shamed and put out of his country / goo your ways and pass the time at
Mount le Herry / there ye shall be on your own / and let us alone with the
matter / for the peers of France will not suffer the matter to rest thus. The
constable byleued these lords and so departed fro Paris and rode to Mount le
Herry. So the office of constableshyp was void for a season as it was said
that sir Guy of Tremoyle should be constable / but it was not so / he was so
well aduysed that he would not take it out of the hands of sir Olyuer of
Clysson.

How tidings came to the frensshe king from the parties of Almayne the
which were to him right dyspleasaunt and unto his uncles. Ca. lxxxvii.
THe same weke that tidings came to Paris of the taking of the constable
there came also tidings from the parties of Almayne / which were right
dyspleasaunt to the king and to his uncles / I shall show you how and
wherefore / the duke of Guerles sone to the duke of Iulyers was alyed with the
king of England to make war against France / and had taken a pencyon of
four thousand frankes by the year / which pencyon the duke of Iulyers his
fader had in time past out of the king of Englandes cofers / but or he dyed
he renounced it / and then his sone who was but young took it again at the
king of Englandes desire so that he would defye the frensshe king and to make
war against him / and he was enclyned to take the english part because he
had war with the lady of Brabant / for he saw well that the duchy of Brabant
was favorable to the royalme of france / for it should after return to the
duke of Borgoyne and to his children. Therefore the duke of Guerles would show
that the matter touched him so nere that he would do the damage that he might
to the royalme of France and to all their alyes. So he sent letters of
defyaunce to ye frensshe king which were no thing pleasant / accepted of
the king nor of his counsel as I shall show you hereafter in the hystory
when it shall be conuenyent to speak thereof in the showing of the war of
Bretayne and of Guerles / the frensshe king made no semblaunt thereof / but
made good chere to the squire of Guerles who had brought the defpaunce
howbeit he was afraid for when he came to the cite of Tourney he would have
gone no f^rther / but he had showed the defyaunce to the pro^ost of the town /
and so would have (...) again saying that it was suffycyent to declare his
message in so noble a town as Tourney but they of the town were not so (...)
/ but arested the squire and put him in sure prison / and then they sent word
thereof to the duke of Borgoyne to know his pleasure. Then the duke wrote to the
prou^st of Tourney that he should send to him ye squire with his defyauces /
and so he was brought to Paris / and he fered lest he should dye / but when he
came to Paris the king and his uncles and the other lords did no thing to
him but all courtoysye. And the frensshe king gave him a goblet of silver
weynge.iiii. mark and.l. frankes within it / and they gave him a sa^f^onduyte
to return in to his country / so by reason of these tidings ye court of
france was sore troubled / and the frensshe counsel was sore troubled when
the constable of france came and made his complaynte of the duke of Bretayne /
for they saw well that trouble and expense began to rise on every side / and
they saw well how they must enploy all their wits to exchewe such
inconuenyentes / they thought that the constable who had served the king so
long in ^launders and other places should have some help in that the duke of
Bretayne had raunsomed him and taken his castelles without title or good
reason / and specially the lord of Coucy and the admyrall was sore dyspleased
with it. Now let us return to the duke of Lancastre and to the king of
Portyngale who were in Galyce and made sore war against the king of Castle.

How the duke of Lancastres men assailed the town of Aurene and took it / for
it gave up as other did. Ca. lxxxviii.
HEre before ye have herd how deeds of arms were done between sir Johan
Holande and sir Raynolde of Roy in the presence of the king of Portyngale and
his wife / and at the kings departing he promised to the duke that as soon
as he was returned to the cite of Port / that he would not tarry past.vi.
days / but that his army should set forth. Then the duke sent Constaunce
his wife to the town of saint James under the guydynge of the lord Fythwater
/ a great baron of England with a hundred speres and two hundred archers and
ye duke said to her. Madame ye shall keep you in the cite of Compostella and
the king of Portyngale my sone / and our people shall goo in to Castle to
seek for our enemies to fight with the^ wherso ever we find them / and now it
shall be seen if ever we shall have any thing in the royalme of Castle or
not. Sir said the lady as god will so be it / thus they departed for that
present time / and sir Thomas Percy / and the lord Fythwaren conveyed the
duches with two hundred speres out of all dangers / and then returned to
the duke who was as then departed fro Besances toward a town in Galyce named
Aurene which rebelled against him and would not obey because it was strong
and therein a garyson of Bretons who had on their parelles undertaken to keep
it / and they had well fortefyed it because they had knowledge that the duke
would come thither / the marshall of the dukes oost had well herd how they
of Aurene in Galyce would not obey / but daily fortefyed them / he counsayled
the constable to goo thither / and so every man drew to that part / and so
came and lodged nere to it / the season was fair about the Ascencyon time /
then tents and pauylyons were pyght up in the fair playnes under the Olyues /
and so lay all that first night / and the next day without gyuyng of any
assault / thinking that the town would have given up / and in deed the men
of the town would gladly have yielded them. But the lords and capytaynes would
not suffer the^ who were Bretons and companyons adventurers two Bretons were
capytaynes called the basto^ of Alroy / and the other the bastard of Peneforte
/ they were good men of war and that well appeared in that they took on them
to keep yt town so far out of all socour against the duke of Lancastre.

ON the.iii. day that the Englysshemen were thus lodged about the town and
had well regarded how they might at their advantage / assail the town.
Then the constable / the marshall and the admyrall caused their trompettes to
sound to the assault / and then every man drew forth in to the field / and
there divided them in to.iiii. bands to assail the town iii.iiii. parts /
and so in goodly order approached the town and tarried on the dykes / wherein
there was no water. But it was well fortefyed with pales and hedges / then the
assault began iii.iiii. parts. Then men of arms and other went down in to
the dykes with axes in their hands and therewith cut down the hedges / and
they within cast down darts and other things that if they had not ben well
pauessed / there had been many sore hurt and slain. And also on the edge of
the dyke the archers shot so fyersly that they within durst not appear / the
duke of Lancastre came to behold the assault which made it ye more fyerser /
he sat there on horsbacke the space of three hours / he had such pleasure to
regard the^ / at this first assault the dykes were cleansed of all the thycke
hedges so that men might goo to the pales / then the retrayte was sowned for
that day / the^ the duke said to the marshal / sir Thomas our men have done
their deuoyre for this day / let them withdraw and case themself / sir it
shall be done said the marshall / so ye assault was seized and every man went
to his lodging / and the hurt to be dressed / and so passed that night / they
had wynes to drink plentye / but they were so hoote and mighty that it was
much pain to drink them / and such as drank of them without water were in
that case yt they could not help themself the next day.

THe next day it was aduysed that they should make none assault because the
day was so hoote / and their men so weary and overcome with strong wynes /
but determined that the next day after they should begin their assault at
the sone rysynge / and to endure till.iii. of the clock at after noone / and
so every man was commanded to take their ease till they herd the sown of the
marshalles trompet / and the same day ye duke of Lancastre herd tidings of
the king of Portyngale how he was departed fro the cite of Port / and drew
toward the port saint yrayne / that way he was purposed to enter in to
Castle and both oostes to mete on the river of Derne beside ye town of
perpygnen or else before the town of Arpent / thus the Portyngales had
devised / if the king of Castle and the frensshe men did not encountre them
before / and if they were lykely so to do then to draw together sooner / of
these tidings the duke was right joyous and gave the messagere for his
tidings.x. nobles.

ANd in the morning whenne it was day the marshalles trompet began to sown
before ye lodgings to reyse up every man / then knights and squyers began to
make them ready every man under his own standerde. Then the marshall drew in
to the field / and all such as were ordained to goo to ye assault / they of
the town had knowledge how the Englysshemen would assail them by their
watch men who had herd the mershalles trompet / then the Bretons raised up
every man and woman in the town and said to them / syrs show yourselfe like
good men and be not abashed for nothing that ye se / we are strong enough /
we have darts and speres and stones and other artyllery suffycyent to
withstand our enemies / and if the worste fall at all times they will take us
to mercy / worse they can not do to us / we have been or this in diverse places
far febler then this is / and yet we have kept it without danger or damage
/ so by reason of their words the Galycyens were encouraged / for of
themself they had rather have yielded them up / for according to truth the
commons in Castle and Galyce are little worth in battle / they are but evil
armed and small of courage. The gentle men are right good on horse back.

THus the Englysshemen ready apparelled to the assault about the sone rysynge
came in to the dykes just unto the pales / and with ares and other wepons bet
down the pales to their feet / but yet for all that they were not on the
wall / for then they had another dyke to pass as large as the other was /
then with much pain they passed that dyke and came to the walls. And when
they within saw them come so nere they defended themself valyauntly. Then
the Galycyens cast out darts in such wise that whom so ever they struck
were soore hurt without he were well pauessed / Then they raised up ladders
for to mount up too the walls. There knights and squyers auaunced themself
to mount with targyes over their heedes / and swords in their hands / and so
came and fought hand to hand with the Bretous who defended themself right
nobly / for I repute it for a great valyauntues that they wol^e abide the
assault / for they knew well they should have as then no socoure. For it
was determined between the king of Castle and the Frensshe men to suffer the
Englysshmen at that time to do what they lift in Galyce or else where and to
pass without battle. Then some of the english men said if other towns in
Castle give us as much to do as this does it shall be long or we win the
royalme / and then other said / there is much pyllage within the town
brought thither out of all the country about. And therefore they are loathe to
yield up the town. Then some demanded who were capytaynes within ye town /
and such as knew them said / two basterdes Bretons borne good men of arms
and expert in all syeges / and the one is called the bastard of Pennefort /
and the other the basterde of Aulroy / but what soever they be they be valiant
men of arms / for they se none appearance of socoure / and yet they will not
yield up. And such as were mounted up were beten down again perforce. And
when the duke of Lancastre was up and ready and herd the bruyre of the assault
said he would goo and behold them / and so lepte on a courser and unarmed
rode to the assault and his standerde before him with the hele arms of
England and of France / and at his coming the assault increased. Then
every man auaunced himself to get lawde and praise / and in like wise they
within. Whenne they saw that the duke was there / they enforced themself to
show their valyauntnes. Thus in assaylynge and defending they continued till
it was three of the clock. And it was not apparent that they should have won
ye town at that assault. Then the duke demanded who were capytaynes within
the town / and it was showed him. Then he said I would the marshall should
speak with them to know if they will yield them or not / I think they have not
as yet ben demanded / wherefore bid the marshall come and speak with me / A
knight went to him and said. Sir my lord ye duke would ye should come and
speak with him / then he came to ye duke / and the duke said. Marshall know ye
if these Bretons will put themself under mine obeysaunce or not / we travail
sore our men / and there be diverse of them sore hurt / and we waste our
artyllery / and we can not tell when we shall have need thereof. Wherefore I
pray you goo to them and take some treatye with them. Sir said he it shall be
done / sith ye will take them to mercy it is reason they be herd speak.

THen the marshall went from the duke to ye assault and said to an Heraulte /
go thy way and find the means to speak with ye capytaynes within the town
and show the^ how I would speak with them. The heraulte departed and went in
to the dykes with his cote armure on his back with the arms of the duke of
Lancastre / and so his comoany made him way by the commandment of the
marshall. The bastard of Alroy saw well the heraulte and so came to the wall
and said Heraulte what would you / I am one of the capytaynes / I think ye be
sent to me / that is true sir said the heraulte / who was called Percy. And
sir the marshall desires you to come to the barryers and speak with him / I am
content said the bastard / so that ye cause your men to leave the assault /
otherwise I will not come / I think that shall be soon done said the heraulte
/ and so he returned to the marshall and showed him as ye have herd. Then
the marshall called his trompet and caused him to blow the retrayte and so he
did / then the assault seized on all parties. Then the capytaynes came
to the barryers / and there was ready the marshal sir John^ Holande / and sir
Thomas Moreaus / and diverse other Englysshemen. Syrs said the Englysshemen will
ye be taken perforce and be utterly lost and slain poor and rich / We know
well that the comonte of the town would gladly yield them to my lord ye duke
and to my lady the duches / for they had given up this town or this and ye had
not ben / wherefore if ye be taken it is evil for you and one thing ye may be
sure of / We will not depart hence till we have it / outher by fair means or
otherwise / therefore speak ye together and advise you and give me an answer /
for I know my charge. Sir said the basterde we are agreed all ready together /
and that is if ye will cause us surely to be conduyted to the town of Arpent
without danger or peril / we shall yield up the town to you So that the men
and wom^n within may live in peace and surety under the obeysaunce of the duke
in like manner as other towns do in Galyce / and none otherwise / we know well
ye be the marshall of the oost and that all treatyes perteyneth to you / and
what soever ye do the duke will agree to the same / that is true said sir
Thomas / it shall be as ye desire / so that ye bear with you nothing but that
is your own and not to rob nor pyll the town / nor that ye have won in ye
country for that may cause riot to be made between you and our men / sir said
the bastard we shall carry nothing with us but that is our own / and if any
of our company have bought any thing of any of the town and are but evil
paid / yet we shall make no riot therefore / I think as for mete and drink
sith we came hyder in garyson our men have paid no thing as for that said the
marshall is except / take all vytayle in advantage for so will our men do /
but I say ye shall carry away no mouables. Sir said the barstarde we be not so
wise men but that some of our company will take somewhat / Well said sir Johan
Holande let them pass that is their own is their own / we will not go so nere
them as to search their males / so be it said the marshall then there was an
abstynence made for that day / and the next day they should depart. Then ye
englyssh men went to their lodgyng and unarmed them / and took their ease and
ye Bretons all that day trussed and gad^red together great pyllage that they
had won before in ye country of Castle for all was abandened to them / so
that thereby such as came first in to that country wanne great good / and so
in the trussynge of their baggage they took many things from the men of the
town as clothe and feathers and other stuff such as they found. And when any
of ye poor men spoke to them saying / syrs that good ye take is none of yours
it is our good ye brought it not hyder / then ye Bretons would say again hold
your peace ye vyllaynes we have a commyssyon of the king of Castle to pay
ourselfe of our wages / ye will not pay us / and though ye had paid us
well and truly yet we must have new wages again / therefore this that we take
is our own.

THen the next day the marshall lepte on his horse and a.lx. speres in his
company and so came to the barryers of the town and there tarried a space.
Then the capytaynes of the Bretons came thither and the marshall said. Syrs be
ye ready to depart / ye sir said they so we may have conduyte to guide us /
whether will you go said the marshall / to the town of Arpent said they / well
said quod the marshall / behold here them that shall conduyte you / then he
called forth a knight of England called sir Steven Stebery and said to him /
take.x. speres with you and bring these Bretons to Arpent and return you to
morrow / he did as he was commanded and so guyded forth these Bretons with
much baggage. And whenne they were al departed then the marshall and his
company entered in to the town / and the people of the town made him great
reverence / for many of them thought it had been ye duke himself / when the
marshall saw these Bretons depart with so great caryage he demanded of them
of / the town if they had taken away any of their goods or not / ye sir
truly said they and yt to a great substance / Why did you not said the
marshall show me yt betymes / for I should have caused them to have rendered it
again / sir said they we durst not for they thretened to slay us if we spoke
thereof / sir they be cursed people / there is none of them but he is a strong
thief / it is no marvel though they rob us / for each of the^ will rob
other The marshall smyled and then he sent for the chief men of the town /
and they came before him / then he made them to swear to hold the town of
Aurene of the duke of Lancastre for ever in like manner and form as the other
towns in Galyce had done before.

Then he ordained new officers / and took of every man their faythes and oaths
/ and so drank and returned to the duke in to the field under the shadow of
the Olyue trees / for the hete of the sone which was so excessyue hoote that
man nor horse could abide it / nor no man durst ride a foragynge till after
the hour of.iii. for the hete.

THe gretest ymagynacyon that the duke had / was for that it was showed him
how the king of Castle was abroad and with a great army coming against him
to fight / for he saw well that he could not perfytely come to the challenge
of Castle but by force of battle / and so he sent out spies in to every
coost / but then it was surely enfourmed him by his spies / and by pilgrims
that the king of Castle made none assembly for to come in to the field / but
kept himself and his men in garysons. And also that the duke of Borbon was
not as then come in to Castle nor no tidings there of his coming. So when
the duke had tarried five days in the marches of Auranches / he determined to
goo to Noye / and there to assaye by assault to pass the bridge over the
river of Erne. Then the knight that had conduyted the Bretons to the town of
Arpent returned again. And it was demanded of him what company of men of
war were there in garyson / he said how sir Olyuer of Clesquy was there with
a thousand speres Bretons and Frensshemen. Then the constable and marshall
said to the duke / sir it were well done we went and scrymysshed with them
peradventure they will issue out to demand deeds of arms. For there be some
of them has great desire thereto / I am con^ente said the duke / let us
dyslodge / here we take no profit / then it was ordained to dyslodge the
next morning / and to goo to Noye / and then after to Arpent.

Now (...) speak of the king of Portyngale and of the way that he took for to
enter in to the royalme of Castle / and then we shall return again to the
duke of Lancastre.

How the king of Portyngale burnt a town when he was departed fro Port and
besyeged.ii. castelles. Ca. lxxxix.
THe king of Portyngale departed from Port and left there ye queen his wife
and her sister / daughter to the duke of Lancastre and to keep them and the
cite he ordained ye earl of Nowar to abide there with a hundred speres of
Portyngales and Gascoynes such as were come to serve him / and then he rode
forth and the first night lodged a three legs from the cite of Port / and
the next day departed in three batayles a fair soft pace because of his footmen whereof there were a.xii. thousand with all the caryage / and after the
king followed with a thousand speres / there was with him Don Galoys / Ferrant
Partecke / and Ponnase de Cougne / and Vas Marten de Cougne bare the kings
baner. Also there was John^ Radyghes de Sar / and the master Denyce called
Ferrant Radyghes with other great barons and knights / and the reregarde led
the constable of Portyntyngale / the earl of Angouse and the earl of Escall the
little Dan de Mondest / Radygo Radyghes of Vale / Conseaulx / Auge Saluage of
Geneue / Johan Ansale of Popelan / and other lords and knights to the nombre
of five hundred speres. Thus they rode forth and took the way to saint yrayne
by small iourneyes / for they took their lodging ever by three of the clock
and so came to the cabase of Iuberoth and there tarried.ii. days / and from
thens at two iourneys they rode to Aurach in Portyngale and there rested
other.ii. days / and then they came to saint yrayne and there lodged / the
town was left void ever sith the battle of Iuberoth / the people were
drawn in to Castle / exepte the castelles wherein were Bretons and Poyctenyns
in garyson. The king of Portyngale determined that both the castelles should
be assailed / for he thought with his honor he might not pass by without
showing of some deeds of arms / for the Castellyans had won the castelles
/ therefore he thought to assaye for to win them again. The king had
brought with him from the cite of Port certain engynes for he knew well he
should have some assaults in his way.

THus the king of Portyngale and his men lodged in the matches of saint yrayne
which was the enter in to the royalme of Castle all a long by the river of
Pese rynnynge to Syuyll the great. By this foresaid river might well be brought
in to the oost all manner of things from Lyxbone and from Port / and so
they were a thyrty thousand one and other. The constable and his rowte with
half of the comonte lay before the castle Perrade in to the eest part and
about ye other castle in the west part called Tayllydon lay ye marshall and
his company / in the castle Perrade was capytayne a knight of Bretayne called
sir Moreys Fouchance an expert man of arms / and in the castle Tayllydon was
sir Jacques of Mountmellyer a knight of Poyctou / and each of them had a.l.
speres / the syege thus lay a.xv. days without doing of any thing saving
there were engynes raised up. And they did cast.x. or.xii. times a day great
stones against the walls / but little hurt they did / but on the covering of
the houses / for the houses within were well vawted with stone / so that the
engynes nor spryngalles did the men but small damage / When the king saw that
the castelles would not be won / and that his men began to waxewery / he
determined then to dyslodge and to enter in to Galyce and to approach nerer to
the duke of Lancastres oost to the entente that they might determyne together
what way were best for them to take. So on a day they dyslodged and trussed
and departed fro saint yrayne / at which time they burnt the town in such
wise that there was not a place left vnbrente able to lodge in horse / when
they of the castle saw them depart they were right joyous and sowned their
trompettes and made great chere and melody till they were all paste / that day
the oost went and lodged at Pount Ferraunt in Galyce / and the next day in
the vale saint Katheryne / and on the.iii. day they came before Feroull in
Galyce a strong town holding on the king of Castelles part / and there
they rested.

How the king of Portyngale and his oost came before Feroull / and assaulted
it / and it was won and brought under the obeysaunce of the duke of
Lancastre. Ca. lxxxx.
WHen the king of Portyngale and his men were before Feroull they found there
a good country / and the constable and marshall said it should be assaulted
affyrmynge how it was preygnable / they were two days without any assault
gyuynge trusting they would have given it up / but they did not / for within
were Bretons and Borgonyons that said they would defend it / by the third
day the engynes were raised up / and the marshall sowned his trompettes to the
assault / then every man made him ready to approach the town / and they within
when they herd the trompettes blow to the assault they drew every man to
their defense and women carried and brought stoones to cast / for in Castle
and Galyce women be of great defense and of great courage in manner as great as
the men / the Portyngales came to the dykes which were deep / but there was no
water in them then they boldly entered in to the dykes and clymed up again on
the other side / but they had much a do / saving they were well pauessed for
they on the walls cast down stoones and hurt many and caused them to reeule
/ also there was good casting of darts both outward and inward. Thus the
assault endured till it was three of the clock / and the men were fore chaced
/ for the sone was hoote / and they in the dykes had none air nor wind / so
that they thought they perysshed for hete / so that thereby the assault seized
/ and all that season the engynes did cast in to the town at adventure /
then the marshall counsayled no moore to assault the town / but still to
let the engynes cast and to scrymysshe at the barryers and to show some deeds
of arms and so as he devised it was done / and daily scrymysshes made And
they within often times were closed with out the gate between the barryers and
the gate for to scrymysshe moore at their ease. And whenne the marshall of
Portyngale saw their manner he devised thereon and said to sir John^ Ferrant / I
se well the sowdyours within at some season are closed between the gate and the
barryers / let us take a.v. or.vi.C. of our men and lay a bysshment and with a
few persons let us scrymysshe a while / and then withdraw little and little
and we shall se that they will issue out on trust to win some what of us /
then let us turn again sodaynely to the barryers and busye them somewhat /
and then our enbusshe of horse men suddenly to come on them And when they se
that they will forsake their barryers and open the gates to enter / and so
peradventure we may enter with them / and at the leest if they within open not
the gate / they that be without shall be al ours / that is true sir said sir
John^ Ferrant. Well said the marshall who was called sir Alue Perreer / do you
ye one feate and I shall do the other / goo you and sir Martyne de Marlo / and
Pomas de Congne and keep the enbusshe and I shall go and make the scrymysshe it
perteyneth to mine office / as they devised so they did / there were appointed
out.v. C. horse men for to keep the enbusshe / and so of.iii. days they made
no scrymysshe whereby they within of the garyson had marvel and said to the
galycyens within the town / loye unhappy people / ye would have given up this
town at their first coming and we had not ben / We have gretely preserved
the honor of your town / for ye shall se the king of Portangale and all his
oost shortly depart hens without doing any damage to us.

ON the fourth day the marshall as was devised began the scrymysshe with a
small company / and the horse men lay still pryuely in their busshment and the
Bretons within when they saw their enemies in trust to get some good prisoner
opened their gate and left it still open to the entente it should be the more
redyer at their return / for they trysted not gretely the Galycyens within
the town / so they came to the barryers and did there as it apperteyned to a
scrymysshe / then when the marshall saw his time he made s^mblaunt as though
he and his men had been weary and as half dyscomfyted reculed little and
little / and when the Bretons saw that they thought to have won all and
opened their barryers all at ones and issued out. and came out and took.xxv.
prisoners / and they had so much haste to get them in to the town that
they left their barryers still open / then the marshall made a sign to the
busshement / and they brake out a.v.C. horse and came more then a galoppe and
entered the barryers / and when the Frenishemen and Bretons saw that they would
have reculed to their barryers but they could not / for the Portyngales entered
as soon as they in to the town. Thus was the town won and diverse slain /
and the sowdyours that were therein garyson were taken prisoners except such
as saved themself by another gate / and so issued in to the feldes and rode
to Arpente where as sir Olyuer of Elysquy was and a thou^ande speres with him
and there they showed how the town or Feroull was lost.

THus as I have showed you fell of this town of Feroull in Galyce. The
Portyngales wanne it and did put it under the obeysaunce of the duke of
Lancastre / in whose title they made that war. The king of Portyngale was
gretely rejoiced of that his men had done so well / and incontynente he
sent word thereof to the duke of Lancastre / showing him how he had
increased his heritage / for he had won him that town and he trusted to win moo. The duke was gretely rejoiced of those tidings who was as the^ come
before Noy. Wherein was the Barroys of Barreys / and sir John^ of Chatelet
Mouraunte / and sir Trystram de la Gayle / sir Raynolde du Roy / sir Wyllyam of
Mongteney and diverse other knights and squyers of France. And when the dukes
marshall saw the castle of Noye he said / look as Coulongne is one of the
keys of castle toward the sea / so is this castle of Noye another keye
toward Castle for he is no lord of Castle without he be lord of Coulongne
and of Noye. Let us goo look what company there is there / it is showed me
how the Baroys of Bars an expert man of arms of France is there / I
think at the entrey of the bridge we shall have some scrymyssh Sir said sir
Lamburyne of Luners / and sir John^ Dambreticourte that would we gladly se. The
vaungarde wherein were a.v.C. speres of good men of arms rode forth in good
order / and the duke sent part of his company thither to make the gretter
mustre / for he knew well that his marshall would show there some deeds of
arms.

WHen the watch of the castle saw the vowarde approach he sowned alaram.
Then the capytaynes knew incontynente that the Englysshmen came thither. They
armed them and put themself in good order / they were a hundred men of arms /
and some came to their barryers with a.xii. penons. But sir Barroys of Bars
was most of reputacyon And also he had the chief charge / and also sir Johan
of Chatell Morant was the next. And when sir Thomas Moreaus marshall of the
oost saw that he was nere the town he alyghted a foot and all his company /
and delivered their horses to their pages and so came together to ye barryers
with their speres in their hands / and at every.vi. paces they rested to keep
themself close together / it was a goodly sight to behold them / and so on a
front they came to the barryers / and there they were received valy auntly /
and I think if they had been in the plain field there had been no goodlyer
deeds of arms done then was done there / and yet the barryers was between them
/ and there the marshall without was matched with sir John^ of ye chateau Morant
within and each of them sore trauayled to hurt each other / but their armure
was so good that noone of them took damage / and sir Thomas Percy was coped
with le Barroys and Mauburyn of Lyuyers with sir wyllyam of Mongteney / and sir
John^ Da^ bretycourte with sir Reynolde of Roy / and the lord Talbot with
Trystram de la gayle / thus they were matched and scrymysshed together with their
speres / and when they were weary they rested / and other knights and squyers
came / and scrymysshed in their places / this scrymysshe endured till high
noone / then archers came to ye place / but then the gentylmen departed and set
cross bows to shote against the english archers and spanyarde with darts /
and they scrymysshed till it was past one of the clock. Then came other yomen
and varlettes / and so scrymysshed till it was night. Then the englysshemen
returned / and they of the castle returned in to their garyson and made good
watch about half a leg from the castle of Noye / alonge by the ryuers
side the English men lay / the which river did them great ease for their
horses / for they had great lack of water till they came there / there they
refresshed them a.v. or.vi. days / and then went before ye town of Arpente
to se the dealing of the constable of Castle and of the frensshmen / and
there they herd tidings of the king of Portyngale who lay in the playnes of
Feroull and all his oost / and was in purpose to come to the town of Padron in
Galyce / which was in ye way toward the duke and the Englysshemen / and
there it was ordained that the king and ye duke should mete together to common /
and determyne how they should perceyuer in their war. They had been a month
a broad in the country and had nere hand brought all Galyce in to their
obeysaunce / and they could here no tidings of ye king of Castle nor of ye
frensshe men / Wherefore they had great marvel / for it was said yt the
king of Castle had somoned his people at Burgus fro all the parties of the
royalme / as of Castle / Syuell / Cordowayne / Collede / Spain / Lion /
Struges / Vale olyue and of Sury / and yt he had.lx.M. men / and vi.M. speres
of pure frensshe men. And how that thither should come ye duke of Borbon who as
it was said was departed out of France to come thither / therefore the
Portyngales and the Englysshmen thought to draw together to be the more
stronger and redyer if their enemies come on them / and they byleued these
tidings to be of truth / wherefore they were joyful / for they would gladly
have made an end by battle / for otherwise they saw well they could not
atteyne to their desired entrepryse / and sir Wyllyam of Lygnac / and sir
Gaultyer of Passac were always about the king of Castle / and every weke
they had tidings out of France what busynes there was there / and of the
departing of the duke of Borbon / and how he took in his way of Auygnyon to
se pope Clement and the cardynalles there / ever they counsayled the king not
to fight till the duke of Borbon were come / and among other tidings they
herd of the duke of Bretayne how he had taken in the castle of Ermyne ye
constable of france / and raunsomed at a.C.M. frankes and of his.iii.
castelles and town that was delivered to the duke of Bretayne / and how that
thereby the journey and boyage in to England was broken / they had marvel of
this / and to what purpose the duke of Bretayne did it / they supposed that the
counsel thereof came out of England.

THus as I have said before the royalme of France was brought in to trouble /
and specially the kings uncles were sore moved with the defyaunce that came
fro the duke of Guerles / for they were fell and rude and out of the course of
other defyaunces as I shall show you when I declare the matter. And also the
frenssh king and his uncles were sore dyspleased in yt the duke of Bretayne
had broken their voyage in to England by ye see / and he that was chief of the
entrepryse taken / that was the constable of france and raunsomed as before is
said at a.C.M. frankes and taken fro him.iii. castelles and a town / which
was a thing gretely preiudycyall to the king and to the royalme of france /
howbeit the king son passed over all the matters / for he was but yo^ge /
wherefore he regarded it not so sore as though he had been of perfyte age / but
such as were ancient and wise said yt by such like matters the royalme of
france has had much a do in time past / as when the king of Nauare caused
sir Charles of Spain constable of France to be slain / for which cause
king John^ never loved after the king of Nauare and took fro him all his
lands in Normandy. Then some other would say if king Charles fader to the
king that now is were a live (he loved the constable so well) surely he
would be revenged and make war to the duke of Bretayne and to take fro him
all his lands what so ever it cost him. Thus every man spoke of this deed /
and said it was evil done / then the kings uncles and the counsel of the
royalme / somewhat to satysfye the people who were sore dyspleased with ye duke
of Bretayne determined that a prelate and.iii. barons should be sent to the
duke to speak with him and to here his reasons / and to commau^de him to come
to Paris to make his exscuse of yt he had done / thither should go the bishop
of Beawuoys / and sir Miles of Dornams a sage and a right valiant man / and
well langaged / and with him sir John^ of Bean / sir John^ of Beuell / and the
lord de la River who had their charge what they should say and do / and the
bishop of Beaw^oys took his way by Mount le herry where as the constable
was / for ye town of Castle perteyned to him king Charles had given it to
him and to his heirs And while the bishop was there a sykenes took him and so
lay in a fever a.xv. days and dyed / then in his stead was sent the bishop
of Langers and he took his way with the other in to Bretayne.

IT might be demanded of me how I knew all these matters to speak so
proprely of them. I answer to all such / that I have made great dylygence in
my days to know it and have serched many royalmes and countries to come to
the true knowledge of all ye matters contained in this hystory written and to be
written / for god gave me the grace to have the laysure to se in my days / and
to have the acquayntaunce of all the high and mighty princes and lords as
well in France as in England / for for in the year of our lord god
a.M.iiiC.iiii. score and.x. I had labored.xxxvii. years / and as then I was of
the age of.lvii. years / and in.xxxvii. years a man being in strength and well
retained in every coost as I was (for after my young days I was in the king
of englandes court.v. years with the queen. And also I was welcome to king
John^ of France and to king Charles his sone) might well learn many things /
and surely it was always my chief ymagynacyon and pleasure to inquire and to
retain it by writing / and how I was enfourmed of the taking of the
constable of France I shall show you. A year after this matter fell I rode
from the cite of Angyers to Towers in Towrayne. And I lay on a night at
Beauforte in ye vale / and the next day I met with a knight of Bretayne called
sir Wyllyam Daucemys / he was riding to se my lady of Mayll in Towrayne his
cosyne and her children / she was newly a wydowe / and I fell in aquayntaunce
with this knight and found him right curtoys and sweet of words / then I
demanded of him some tidings and specially of the taking of the constable /
which matter I was glad to here and to know the troth thereof / and he showed
me and said how he had been at ye parlyament at wannes with ye lord of Aucemys
his cosyne a great baron of Bretayne. And in like manner as sir Espayne de Lion
enfourmed me of all things that had fallen in Foyze in Byerne / and in
gascoyne / and also as sir John^ Ferrant parteke showed me of all the matters
of Portyngale / and of Castle. In like manner this knight showed me many
things / and more would have done if I had ryden longer in his company. Thus
between Mount le herry and Premylly was.iiii. great leages and we rode but
softely / and in this way he showed me many things / ye which I bare well in
my remembrance / and specially of the adventures of Bretayne. And thus as we
rode and that we came nere to Premylly / we entered in to a medowe there this
knight rested and said A god have mercy of the soul of the good constable of
France / he did here ones a goodly journey and profitable for the royalme
under the baner of sir John^ de Bewell for he was not as then constable but
newly come out of Spain / and I demanded of him how it was / I shall show
you said he when I am on horseback and so we mounted: than we rode forth
fair and easily / and as we rode he said.

In the season that I have showed you quod this knight / this country here was
full of Englysshmen / robbers and pyllers of Gascoyne bretons and almayns / and
adventurers of all nations: For all the country on both sides of the river of
Loyre / were replenysshed with them: For the war between France and England
was newly renewed / so that all manner of thieves and robbers entered in to this
country / for here they assembled and fortifyed the^ self / to conquer the
castle of Beauforde in the valey / that ye saw but late / was in their hands
/ and all the country about. Thus to come to my purpose / the Englysshmen and
gascoyns had in their hands / the town and castle of Prinulley / and had
greatly fortifyed it. And they held also other small forteresses a long by
the river of Loyre: And when so ever they would ride / they were to the nombre
between a thousand and eight hundred fighting men: Than sir Bertram / sir
Johan of Beull / and the lord of Mailly and other knights of this country
set their ymaginacions / how they might deliver the country of these people
/ and gathered toguyder a five hundred spears / and had spies / and knew when
the English men would ride / and were in purpose to come before Samure / For
the capytayns of all their fortresses were assembled to guyder at Prinully /
which is a little here before us. The frenchmen rode and passed the water that
ye se here by us / and laid themself in a busshment in a wode / a little here
beside on our right hand. And in the morning at the son risynge / the
English men and other departed from Prinully / and they were a nine hundred
men. And when our men saw them / they knew well they must fight / and
there they co^muned toguyder / what cry they should call on that day. Some
would have cried the cry of sir Bertrame / but he would in no wise agree
thereto: And more over he said / that he would displaye no baner that day / but
that he would fight under the baner of sir Johan de Beull. Than our enemies
came in to this medowe / where as I lyghted right now. and as soon as they
were entered we brake out of our busshement and entered in to the medowe. And as
soon as they saw us they a lyghted a foot / and we in likewise: and so entered
each within other / the^ was sore foynynge each against other / and diverse of
both parties overthrown. Thus our battle endured a long space / without
knowing who should have the vyctorie / but to say ye troth / we were all
chosen men of arms / and many of our enemies were but yuell armed / and were
but thieves and robbers / Howbeit they found us work enough / and our hands
full. But than sir Moris Cresiquede and sir Geffray Richone / sir Geffray
Caresnell and Morsonase / followed sir Bertam at the spurs. They came and
refresshed us with a threscore spears of good men of arms. and they russhed
in with their horses and brake our enemies so a broad / that they could not
assemble toguyder again. And when the capytayus of these pyllers saw that
the journey went against them / they took their horses / not all / for there
abode in the field a three hundred slain and taken: and the chase endured to
saint Mors on the river of Loyre / and there they entered in to a bastell. sir
Robert Sem / Robert Herne / Richard Gylle / and Iacomyne Clerk. These four
saved them self and passed over the river of Loyre / and so entered in to four
fortresses / that their men held on that side the river / but they tarried not
long there / but rode in to Auuergne and Lymosyn.

THus by this journey / all the country here about was delivered / for the
robbers nor they assembled no more toguyder after. Therefore I say / that ser
Bertram the constable was a valiant man / and profitable for the realm of
France. sir quod I it is true / he was a valiant man / and so is sir Olyuer
of Clesquyn. and when I named him Clesquyn the knight smyled / And I demanded
of him where at he smyled. sir quod he I shall show you / because ye name him
Clesquyn / for that is not his right name nor never was / though every man
call him so / yet all we of Bretayne call him the same. And ser Bertram while
he lived would gladly have had it reformed / but he could not amend it /
for the word is redyer to fall on a man's tongue / than his right name. Than
I desired him of his courtesy / to show me if there were any great difference
between his names. Nay sir quod he there is no great difference / but where he
is called Clesquyn / he should be named Glaye aquyne. And I shall show you as
I have herd it reported / how that name came to him / and it is of truth /
For ye shall find it written in the ancient chronicles of Bretaygne. The
words of this knight greatly pleased me / and I said to him Sir / ye shall do
me great pleasure / to show me the matter / and I shall never forgete it / for
sir Bertram was so valiant a knight / that his deeds ought to be put in
remembrance. That is true quod the knight / and I shall show you. Thus sir
Wyllyam of Aunsiens began his tale.

In the season when Charles the great reigned in France / who conquered and
augme^ted the faith / and was Emperor of Rome and king of France and of
Almaygne / and lies at Ayes the chapel. This king Charles / as we read and
find in the ancient crony cles / For ye know well that all the knowledge in
the world is known by writing / for we have nothing to sound upon truth
nor to aproue it but by scripture. this king Charles was in Spain diverse times
/ and at one time he was still there a.ix. year / without retournyng in to
France / but still went forth on his conquest. In the same season the^ was a
king sarazyn called Aquyn / he was king of Bougie in Barbary / right over
against spaigne / for Spaygne is a great country / beginning at saint Iohn^s
Pie du port / for the realm of Arragon and Nauer / of Bisquay / of Portugale
/ of Co^nymbres / of Lixbone / of Ciuyle / of Tollet / of Cordwayne / and of
Lion. All these be enclosed within Spain / and other. And this great king
Charlemayne / co^querid all these countries. And in this season that the king
tarried there so long / this king Aquyn of Bougy in Barbary / assembled his me^
and came by see in to Bretaygne / and arrived at the port of Wannes / and he
had there with him his wife and children / and there he conquered and went
forward. King Charles was well enfourmed of this viage / and how king Aquyn
prospered in Bretayne / but for all that he would not break his vyage / and
said. Let him alone in Bretaygne / it shall be but a small matter to deliver the
country of him and of his. When we have ones ^ubdued his country here / and
brought it in to the holy faith. This king Aquyn builded a tower by the Sea
side: not far of fro Wannes / a goodly and a fair tower / and it was called
Glaye / And there this king Aquyn lay much. And when king Charles had
accomplisshed his vyage / and acquyted all Galyce and Spaygne from all the
myscreantes / and the kings Sarazyns deed and slain / and all the land
turned to the Christen faith. than he returned in to Bretaygne / and on a
day had a great battle against this king Aquyne / and nyghe all the
myscreantes slain. And so this king Aquyne fled in to the castle of Glaye
/ and there he had ready at the foot of the tower a ship / and therein he
entered / and his wife and his children. But he and his wife made such haste he
was so nere chased / that they had no leysar to take with them a young son
that lay and slepte in the tower / of a year old. Thus the king and his wife
departed by the sea / and this child was found in the tower of Glaye / and
was brought to king Charlemaygne / who was right ioyouse of him and said /
how ye child should be baptized / and so he was: and Rouland and Olyuer held
him over the font / and was named Olyuer. And the king gave him all the lands
that his father Aquyn had conquered. This child when he came to the age of a
man was a good knight / and his men called him sir Olyuer de Glaye aquyn /
because he was found in the tower of Glaye / and some to the king Aquyn.

Thus I have showed you the first fouudacyon of sir Bertram of Clesquyn / who
should be called Glaye aquyne. And sir Bertram in his days / after the
putting out of king Do^peter of Castyle / and had crowned king Henry / said
how he would go in to Bougy to demand his heritage / And without fail so he
had done / for king Henry had lent him men and ships to go in to Bougye with
a great army / if a great let had not broken his voyage. And that was whan^e
the prince of Wales made war upon the said king Henry / and did put him
down / and by puissaunce did set in to Castyle again Do^peter. And than at
the battle of Marres sir Bertram was taken prisonner by sir Johan Chandos /
and was set to ransom at a hundred thousand frankes. And at another time
he was also taken at the battle of Alroy / and raunsomed again / at a hundred
thousand Frankes. So thus sir Bertrams purpose was brokenne / for the wars
between England and France was renewed / So that they had enough to do.
Thus he was lynially descended fro the king of Bougy named Aquyne / whose
kingdom is in Barbarye. Thus I have showed you the right discente of sir
Bertram of Clesquyn / I thanked him / and so we came to the town of Prinulley.

How the french ambassadors came to the duke of Bretayne / upon the taking
of the constable of France / and of the answer that was made to them. Cap.
xci.
IF I had been as long in company with this knight sir Guyllyam of Aunsens / as
I was with sir Espayn de Leon / wha^ I rode with him fro the cite of Pauyers to
Ortayes in Byerne / Or else as long as I had been with sir John^ Ferant
Pertelette of Portyngale. He would have showed me many things / but it was not
so / for after dinner when we had rydden a.ii. leages we came to a forked way /
the one way was right to Towers in Towrayne / whether as. I supposed to ride /
and the other way was to Maylle / whether the knight was determined to ride.
So at this way we brake company taking leave each at other / but between
Prinulley and our departing he showed me many things / and specially of the
business in Bretayne / and how the bishop of Langers was sent in the stead
of the bishop of Beawuoys / who dyed by the way. and how the bishop of
Langers with sir Johan de Bowyll and other / came to the duke of Bretayne / and
of the answer that they had. and on the informacyon of this knight I took my
foundation / and have written as follows.

yE have herd here be fore / how these ambassadors departed fro Paris / fro
the king and his counsaye / well in structed what they should say and do: and
so long they rode by their iourneys / that they aryued at Nauntes. Than they
demanded where the duke was / it was showed the^ how he was about the
marchesse of wa^nes / when as most accustomably he lay. They rode thither / and
so came to the city of Wannes / it is but.xx. miles between. The duke was in
the castle called le Mote: than they came before the duke / who by semblant
made to the^ good and sweet recule. The bishop of Langers because he was a
prelate / began to speak and to make his preposicyon well and sagely / and
said. Sir duke / we are here sent to you fro the king our master and fro
his uncles / the duke of Berrey and of Burgoyne / to show unto you / how they
have great marueyle / in that the voyage that they would have made in to
England is by your means broken / and have taken and raunsomed the Constable
of France / at so high a rau^some / that they are right sorry thereof. And
moreover ye will have three of his castelles in Bretaygne / the which shall be a
great anoyau^ce to all the resydue of the country / if they shuloe be hold
against them / with the aid of the town of Iugone / the which is pertaining
to the Constables heritage. Therefore we are charged to show you / and we say
unto you as messangers fro the king our master / and from his uncles / that
ye render again to the constable of France his heritage / that ye with hold
from him / and set him again in peasable possessyon / according unto right /
in like manner as they were before / when they were delivered you perforce / and
by none other right nor tytell / that ye have to them. And also / that ye
restore again entierlye / all the money that ye have had of him. And this is
the commandment of the king and his counsel / that ye come personally to
Paris / or where as it shall please the king to assygne you / there to make
your excuse. And we repute him so benygne and pacyent / with that ye be of the
blood royal / that he will here your excuse: And if he be not reasonable / the
duke of Berrey and the duke of Burgoyne will so temper him / that ye shall be
friends and cosyn to the king / as by reason ye ought to be. Than the
bysshopp^ turned him to sir Johan of Beull and said. Sir / is not this the
kings pleasure? and he said yes / and so did sir Johan de Vyen. At these
words there were no mo present but they four.

When the duke of Bretaine had herd the bishop of Langers speak / he
studied a little and good cause why for it was a great matter / and at the
last he said. Sirs / I have well understand your words / and it is good
reasone that I so do / because ye be sent from the king and his uncles.
Wherefore in their behalf I will do you all the honor and reverence that I can
do / I am bound thereto / but your demand and request requires counsel.
Wherefore I shall take counsel with mine / and make you such answer / that
ye shall be contented. Sir / ye say well quod they / it suffyceth us. Than
they departed and went to their lodgings. At night they were desired to dyne
the next day with the duke. So the next day they came to the duke and were
well received / and so washed and went to dinner and satte down. First the
bishop of Langers because he was a prelate / and than the duke / than the
admyrall of France / and thanne sir Johan de Beulle: They had a great dinner
and were well served / and after dinner they entered in to a counsel chamber /
and there they talked of diverse matters / and herd mynstrelsy.

These lords of France thought surely to have had an answer / but they
had none: Than wine and spyces were brought in / and so made collasyon / and
than took their leave and departed to their lodging. The next day they were
appointed to come to the duke / and so they did / and the duke received them
swetely and at the last said. Sirr / I know well ye look to be answered /
for by the words that I have herd you say / ye are charged by the king and
his uncles to bring them an answer. Wherefore I say to you / yt I have done
nothing to sir Olyuer of Clesquyne / whereof I should repent me / saving of
one thing / and that is / That he had so good a markette / as to escape a
live. And in that I saved his life / was for the love of his office / and not
for his person / For he has done me so many displeasures / that I ought to
hate him deedly. And saving the displeasure of the king and of his uncles /
and his counsel. For all the taking of sir Olyuer / I have not thereby broken
their voyage by the sea. I will well excuse my self therein / for I thought non
yuell the day that I took him / a man ought to take his ennemy whersoeuer he
find him And if he were deed / I would think the Realm of France to be as
well ruled or better / than it is by his counsel. And as for his castelles
that I hold / the which he has delivered me / I am in possessyon of them /
and so will be / without the puyssaunce of a king take them fro me. And as
for rendringe of his money / I answer / I have had so much to do in time
paste / by the means of this sir Olyuer of Clysquyn / that I ran in debt
gretlye thereby: and now I have paid them that I was bound unto / by reason
of this debt. This was the answer that the duke of Bretaygne made to the
kings ambassadors / Than they laid forth other reasons / to enduce the duke
to some reasonable way / but all his answers turned ever to one conclusyon.
And when they saw none other way / they took their leaves to depart / and ye
duke gave them leave. Than^e they returned and did so much by their iourneys
that they came to Paris / to the house of Beauty / beside Wynsentes. There was
the king and the queen and thither came the duke of Berrey and the duke of
Bourgoyne / having great desire to know what answer the duke of Bretaygne
haddemade.

THe answer ye have herd here before / I need not to show it again / but
the king and his counsel were not content with the duke of Bretaygne / that
his ambassadors had made no better exployte: and they said / how the duke
was a proud man and a presumptuous / and that the matter should not so rest in
peace / seeing the matter so preiudyciall for the Crown of France. And the
entensyon of the king and his counsel was / to make war against the duke
of Bretayne / and the duke looked for nothing else / For he saw and knew
well / how he had greatly displeased the king and his counsel / but he hated
so mortally the constable / that it took fro him the good order of reason / for
he repented him sore / that he had not put him to death / when he had him
in his danger. Thus the matter continued a long season / and the duke of
Bretayne lay at Wannes / and little and little rode over his country / for he
freared greatly embusshmentes. He kept still in love and favor his cities and
good towns / and made secret treaties with the Englysshmen / and made his
castelles and forteresses to be as well kept / as though he had had opyn
war / and was in many imaginacions on the deed he had done Sometime he would
say / he would he had not taken the constable / how be it he said ever to
stop men's mouths / that sir Olyuer of Clesquyn had sore dishleased him /
so that many a man said / that else he would never have done it / thereby he
brought his country in fear / for it is but a small signorie / if a prince be
not feared and douted of his men / for and the worste fall / he may have
peace when he list. Now let us leave to speak of the duke of Bretaygne / and
let us somewhat speak of the business that was in the realm of England /
which was in the same season / horrible and marvelous.

How the king of Englandes uncles were of one accord and aliau^ce against the
king and his counsel / and of the murmuring of the people against the duke
of Irelande / and of the answer of the londoners to the duke of Gloucestre.
Cap. xcii.
YE have herd here before / how the king of Englandes uncles / the duke of
york and the duke of Gloucestre / with therle of Salisbury and the earl of
Arundell / the earl of Northumberlande / the earl of Notyngham / and the
archebysshoppe of Canterbury. All these were of one alyaunce and accord /
against the king and his counsel / for these lords and other / were not
content with the kings counsel / and said among them self. This duke of
Irelande does with the king what he list / and with all the realm. The king
will not be counsayled but by unhappy men / and of base lynage / and takes no
regard to the great lords of his realm. As long as he has such counsel
about him / the business of England can not do well for a realm can not be
well governed / nor a king well counsayled / by such ungracious people. It is
seen a poor man mounted in to great estate and in favor with his master /
often times corrupts and distroyeth the people and the realm. A man of base
lynage / can not know what parteyneth to honor / their desire is ever to
enryche and to have all themself / like an Otter in the water / which
coueteth to have all that he fyndeth. Who has any profit by that the duke of
Irelande is so great with the king? we know full well fro whense he came / yet
we se that all the realm is ruled by him and not by the kings uncles / nor by
none of his blood. This ought not to be suffered. We know well enough / that
the Earl of Oxenforde had never ye grace to do any valiant deed in this
realm: his honor / wisdom / counsel or gentylnesse / is right well known
/ and that was well known ones by sir Johan Chandos / in the prince of Wales
house at saint Andrews in Bordeaux. Another demanded what matter was that / I
shall show you quod the other knight / for I was there present. There was wine
brought on a day into the princes Chamber / where as there were many lords of
England with him. and when the prince had drunk / because sir John^ Chandos
was constable of Acquitayne / the prince sent him his cup first to drink /
and he took the cup and drank / and made thereof none offer first to the
Earl of Oxenforde / who was father to this duke of Irela^de: and after that sir
Johan Chandos had drunk / a squire bare the cup to the Earl / who had
such dispyte that sir Johan Chandos had dronke before him / that he refused
the cup / and would not drink / and said to the squire in manner of a mock.
Go to thy master Chandos / and bydde him drink. Shall I go said the squire /
he has drunk all ready? Therefore drink you sithe he has offered it to you /
if ye will not drink / by saint George I shall cast the drink in your face.
Therle when he herd that / douted that the Squire would do as he said / and so
took the cup / and set it to his mouth and drank / or at leest made
semblant to drink. And sir Johan Chandos who was not far thens / saw well
all the matter and held him still till the prince was gone from them: Than he
came to the Earl and said. Sir Aubery are ye displeased / in that I drank
before you? I am Constable of this country / I may well drink before you /
sithe my lord the Prince and other lords here / are co^tente therewith. It is
of truth ye were at the battle of Poycters / but such as were there knows
not so well as I what ye did the^/ I shall declare it.

When that my lord the Prince had made his voyage in Languedocke and
Carcassone to Narbone / and was returned hither to this town of Bourdeaux /
ye took on you to go in to England / What the King said to you at your
coming I know right well / yet I was not there. He demanded of you if ye
had furnysshed your voyage / and what ye had done with his son the Prince.
ye answered / how ye had left him in good health at Bourdeaux: Than the king
said. What and how durst ye be so bold / to return without him. I
commanded you and all other when ye departed / that ye should not return
without him / on pain of all that ye might forfayte. And you this to return
/ I straightly command you / that within four days ye avoid my realm / and
return again to him / For and I find you within this my realm the fifth
day / ye shall lose your life / and all your heritage for ever. And ye feared
the kings words / as it was reason / and so avoided the realm / and so your
adventure and fortune was good / for truly ye were with my lord the prince a
four days before the battle of Poicters / And so ye had the day of the
battle forty spears under your charge / and I had threfore. Now ye mayese
wheder I ought to drink before you or not sith I am constable of ^ equytaygne.
The earl of Orenforde was a shamed / and would gladlye he had been thens at
that time / but he was feign to suffer and to here those words. This sir Johan
Chandos said to him in opyn presence. Therefore it is not to be marueyled /
though this duke of Irelande / who is son to the said earl of Oxenforde / be
disdaynfull / in following the steps of his father. For he takes upon him to
rule all England above the kings uncles. Well quod some other why should he
not / sithe the king will have it so.

THus the people in the Realm murmured in diverse places / against the duke of
Irelande / And he did one thing that greatly abated his honor / and that was
/ he had first to his wife the daughter of the lord of Coucy / the lady
Isabell / who was a fair Lady and a good / and of more noble blood than he is
of. But he fell in love with another damsel of the queen's of England an
Almaygne borne / and did so much with pope Vrbayne at Rome / that he was
deuorsed fro the daughter of the lord Coucy / without any tytell of reason /
but by presumpcion / and for his synguler appetyte / and than wedded the queen's
maid / and king Richard conse^ted there to. he was so blinded with this duke
of Irelande that if he had said. sir / this is white / tho it had been black /
ye king would not have said the contrary. This dukes mother was greatly
displeased with him for that deed / and took in to her company his first wife
the lady of Coucy. The duke did yuell / and therefore at length yuell came to
him. and this was the first princypall cause that he was behated for in
England / every thing that turns to yuell / must have a beginning of yuell.
This duke of Irelande trusted so much in the grace and favor of the king /
that he believed / that no man should trouble him. And it was a common renome
through England / that the^ should be a new tax raised through the realm /
that every fire should pay a noble / and the rich to bear out the poor. The
kings uncles knew well it would be a hard matter to bring about. And they
had caused certain words to be sown abroad in the cities and good towns of
England / as to say / how the people of England were sore grieved with tares
and talenges / and how there was great richesse raised / and that the common
people would have accomptes of the governors thereof / as the archebysshop of
york the duke of Irelande / sir Simon Burle / sir Mychaell de la Pole / sir
Nycholas Bra^ble / sir Robert Try^^lyen / ser Peter Golouser / sir Johan
Salisbury / sir Johan Beauchampe / and the masters of the Staple of the
wolles. The commons said / that if they would make a true acco^pte / there
should be found gold and silver suffycient / without raising of any new
subsydies. It is a common usage / none is glad to pay money nor to opyn their
purses / if they may let it.

THis brute and noise spredde so a broad in England / and specially in the
city of London / which is chyefe city in the realm / that all the commons
rose and said / how they would know how the realm was governed. saying /
how it was long sith any account was made. First these londoners drew
them to sir Thomas of Woodstocke duke of Gloucestre / though he were younger
brother than sir Edmonde duke of york. The common people reputed the duke of
Glocestre for a valyant and a sage discrete parson. And when they came before
him they said. Sir the good city of London reco^maundeth them to you / and
all the people ingenerall requires you to take upon / you the gouernynge of
the realm. For they know well it is not unknown to you / how the king and
the realm is governed. The common people complayneth them sore / for the
kings counsel demands / tails upon tails / aids upon aids / so that
the realm has been more grieved with tails and other subsydies / not
accustomed / sithe the kings Coronacyon / than in fyftie year before / and it
is not known where the richesse is become. Wherefore sir / may it please you
to provide some remedy / or else the matter will go yuell / for the commons
cries out thereon. Than the duke answered and said / fair sirs I have herd
you well speak / but I alone can not remedy this matter / how be it I se well
ye have cause to compain / and so has all other people. But though I be
uncle to the king and son to a king: though I should speak thereof / yet
nothing shall be done for all that / For the king my nephue has such counsel
as now about him / whom he believes better than him self / which counsel
ledeth him as they list. But if ye will come to the effect of your desires /
it must behoue you to have of your accord and agreement / all the cities and
good towns of England. And also some prelates and noble personages of the
realm / and so come toguyder in to the kings presens / and I and my brother
shall be there. And than ye may say to the king. Right dear sir / ye were
crowned very young / and yuell ye have been counsayled / as yet hither unto /
Nor ye have not takenne good regard to the business of this your Realm / by
reason of the poor and young counsel that ye have about you. Whereby the
matters of your realm has had but small and yuell effects / as ye have
seen and known right well. For if God haddenat showed his grace / this realm
had been lost and distroyed. Therefore sir / here in the prensens of your
uncles / we require your grace / as humble subjects ought to desire their
prince / that your grace will find some remedy / that this noble Realm of
England / and the noble crown thereof / which is descended to you / from the
noble king Edward the third / who was ye most nobles king that ever was /
sithe England was first enhabyted / that it may be sustained in sprosperyte
and honor / and your people that complayneth / to be kept and maynteyned in
their right / the which to do / your grace did swear the day of your
Coronacion. And that it may please you to call together the three estates of
your Realm / prelates and barownes / and wysemen of your cities and good
towns. and that they may regard if the gouernyng of your realm that is past
/ be well or not. And sir / if they parceyue that it has been well / thanne
such as be in office to remaygne still / as long as it shall please your
grace: and if they be found contrary / thau^e they in courtesse manner to be
avoided fro your person / and other notable and dyscrete persons to be set
in to office. First by your noble advise / and by the consent of my lords your
uncles / and noble prelates and barons of your realm. And sirs quod the duke
of Gloucester / when ye have made this supplycacion to the king / he will
thanne make you some manner of answer. If he say that he will take counsel
in the matter / than desire to have ashorte day. And peyse so the matter before
hand / to put the king and such marmosettes as be about him to some fear.
Say to him boldly / that the Realm will no lengar suffer it / and that it is
marueyle / how they have suffered it so long / and I and my brother / and the
bishop of Caunterburye / and the Earl of Salisbury / the Earl of Arundell /
and the earl of Northumberla^de will be by / for without we be present speak no
word thereof. We are the greatest personages of England / and we shall aid to
sustain your words. For all we shall say / how your desire is but
reasonable. And when he hereth us speak / he will agree there to / or else he
does amysse / and thereupon apoynt a time: This is the best counsel I can
give you. Than the Londoners answered and said. Sir / ye counsel us nobly.
But sir / it will be hard for us to find ye king and you / and all these
lords toguyder in one place. Nay nay quod the duke it may well be done /
saint Georges day is now within this sire days. The king will be than at
wyndsore: and ye know well the duke of Irelande will be there / and sir Simon
Burle and many / other and my brother and I and therle of Salisbury shall be
there / therefore provide for y^ matter against that time. Sir quod they it shall be
done / and so they departed right well content with the duke of Gloucester.
Than when saint Georges day came / the king and the queen were at Wyndsore /
and made there a great feast / as his predecessors had done before / the
next day after the feast of saint George. Thither came the londoners to the
nombre of threscore horse / and of york as many / and many oaths of diverse
good towns of England / and they lodged in the town of Wyndsore / The king
was determined to depart to place a three leages thens / and when he knew of
the coming of the people to speak with him / he would the sooner have been gone:
He said he would in no wise speak with them. But than his uncles and therle of
Salisbury said. sir / ye may not with your honor thus depart. The people of
your good towns of England / are come hyder to speak with you. Sir / it is
necessary that ye here them / and to know what they demand / and there after
ye may answer them or else take counsel to answer them. So thus full sore
against the kings mind he was feign to tarry. than they came into his pres^ns
in the great hall allow / there was the king and both his uncles / and the
archebysshoppe of Caunterbury / the bishop of Wynchester / and the Chaunceler
/ and the earl of Salisbury / the earl of Northumber / land and diverse other.
There this people made their request to the king / and a burges of London spoke
for them all / named sir Simeon of Subery / a sage man and well langaged / and
there declared well and boldly the effect of thinformacyon that the duke of
Gloucester had showed the^ / before as ye have herd When the king had herd him
well / he said. Among you commons of my realm / your requests are great and
long / they are not over soon to be spedde / we shall not be toguyder again a
long season / and also great part of my counsel is not here present.
Therefore I say unto you / get you home again and sytte in rest / and come
not again till the feast of Myghelmas / without ye be sent for / at which
time our parlyament shall be at Westmynster. Than come and bring your requests
and we shall show it to our counsel / and that is good we shall accept it /
and that ought to be refused we shall condemn. But sirs / think not that we
will be rewled by our common people / that shall never be seen / as for our
gouernynge nor in the governance of them yt rule under us / we se nothing but
right and justice. Than a seuyn of them all with one voice answered and said.
Right redouted sovereign sayng your gracyous displeasure / as for justice in
your realm is right feeble / your grace knows not all / nor can not know.
your grace nouther demands for it nor enquereth therefore / and such as be
of your counsel forbere to show it you / because of their own profit. For
sir / it is no justice to cut of heedes / hands / and fete / such manner of
punysshmentes be not laudable. But sir / good justice is to keep your people in
right / and to set such ways and order / as they might live in peace / that
they should have none occasyon to grudge or to make any commosyon. And sir / we
say that ye set us to long a day / as to Mighelmas. sir / we may be never
so well eased as now / Wherefore sir / we say all by one assente that we will
have account / and that shortly / of them that has governed your realm /
sithe your Coronacyon. And we will know Where your Revenues is become / with
all the taxes / tails / and subsydies this nine years paste / and whereon they
have been bestowed. If such as are your treasourers make a good account / or
nere thereunto / we shall be right ioyouse / and suffer them to govern still.
And if they can not acquyte them self therein trewly / they shall be reformed by
your deputyes establysshed to that purpose / as my lords your uncles and
other. With those words the king beheld his uncles and held his peace / to
se what they would say. Than sir Thomas duke of Gloucester said. Sir / in the
request and prayer of these good people the commons of your realm / I se
nothing therein but right and reasone. Sir quod the duke of york it is of
truth / and so said all the other prelates and barons that were there
present. Than the duke of Gloucester said again. Sir / it is but reason that
ye know where your good is become. The king saw well / how they were all of
one accord / and saw how this chafe Marmosettes durst speak no word / for
there were to many great men against them. Well quod the king I am content.
Let them be rydde away / for summer season comes on and hunting time /
whereunto we will now entende: Than the king said to the people. Sirs / would
ye have this matter shortly dispatched? yea sir quod they / and that humbly we
beseech your grace. And also we beseech all my lords here / and specially my
lords your uncles to be there at. We are content quod they / for the apeysyng
of all parties / as well for the king as for the Realm / for our part lies
therein. Than they said again. We desire also the reverend father in god /
the archebysshoppe of Caunterbury / the bishop of Lyncolne / and the
bishop of Wynchester to be there. They answered and said / they were
content so to be. Than again they desired all other lords to be there / that
were there present / as the earl of Salisbury and the Earl of Northumberlande /
sir Reynolde Cobham / sir Guy Brian sir John^ Felton / sir Mathewe Gourney. and
moreover they said / they would ordain that of every good city and town in
England / there should be a three or four notable persons / and they should
determyne for all the hole co^montie of England. Than this matter was
determined / and to assemble the vtas of saint George at Westmynster. And there
all ye treasourers / collectours / and officers of the kings to be there / and
to make there accomptes before these said lords. The king was content therewith
/ and was brought to it by fayrenesse and not before / by the desire of his
uncles and other lords: It seemed to him behouable / to know where his
treasoure was become. Thus amiably every man deperted fro Wyndsore / and the
lords went to London / and the treasourers and other officers were send for
throughout the realm / to come with their full accomptes on pain of
dishonourynge / and loss of all that they had / and life.

How the day of account came / and there the officers appeared in the presence
of the kings uncles and commens of England / and how sir Simon Burle was
prisoner i^ the toure of London / and how sir Thomas Tryuet dyed. Cap. xciii.
THe day prefixed came that all pertes apered at westmynster / and such as
should make their accomptes apered before the kings uncles / and such other
prelates and lords / with other as were assigned to here the^. This account
endured more than a month / and some there were that made their accomptes
another good nor honorable / and such were punisshed both by their bodies and
by their goods. sir Simon Burle was cast in arerage of.ii.C. and l.M. frankes
/ because he was one of the governors in the kings youth. And he was
demanded where this good was bestowed / he excused him self by the bishop of
york and sir Wylliam Neuell saying how he did nothing but by their counsel
/ and by the kings chamberleyns / ser Robert Tryuilyen / sir Robert Beauchampe
/ sir John Salisbury sir Nycholas Braule / sir Peter Goufer / and other. And
when they were demanded thereof before the counsel / they denied the matter /
and laid all the fault in him. And the duke of Irelande said to him privily
between them two. Sir Simon / I understand ye shall be arested and set in
prison / and hold there till ye have paid the so^me that is demanded /
nothing shall be abated. Go your way whether soever they send you / I shall
rightwell make your peace / though they had all sworn the contrary. I ought
to receive of the constable of France threscore.M. frankes / for the ransom
of Johan of Bretaygne / son to saint Charles of Bloys / the which so^me ye
know well is owyng to me / I shall present the counsel therewith at this
time. And finally the king is our sovereign lord / he shall pardon and
forgive it you clearly / for ye profet ought to be his and no man's else. Sir
quod sir Simon Burle / if I thought not that ye should help against the king
/ and to bear out my deeds / I would depart out of England and go in to
Almayne / and to the king of Beam for thither I could be welcome: and so let
the matter rynne a season till the world be better apeased. Than the duke
said. I shall never fail you / we are companyons and all of one sect. ye
shall take day to pay their demand / I know well ye may pay and ye list in
ready money / more than a hundred thousand frankes ye need not fear the death
/ ye shall not be brought to that point / ye shall se the matter otherwise
change before the feast of saint Michell / when I have the king ones at my
will / whereof I am sure. For all that he does now at this time is by force
and against his will. We must apease these cursed londoners / and lay down
this slander and brute that is now raised against us and ours.

SIr Simon Burle had a little trust on the words of the duke of Irelande /
and so came before the lords of England dukes / earls / barons / and
counsel of the good towns. Than it was said to him. Sir Simon / ye have
always ben a notable knight in the realm of England / and ye were well
beloved with my lord the prince. And ye and the duke of Irelande have had in a
manner the gouernynge of the king. We have seen all your matters and well
examyned them / the which be another good nor fair / which greatly displeases
us / for your own sake. It is clearly determynyd by the hole general
counsel that ye must go to prison / in to ye tower of London / and there to
remain till ye have brought into this chamber the money of the kings / and of
the realms that ye have gathered. the which as it apereth by the treasourers
rolls draws to the some of two hundred and fyfty thousand frankes. Now
look what ye will say. Than sir Simon was half discomforted and said. Sirs I
shall with a good will / And also it behooves me so to do / to fulfill yo^
commandment. I shall go where as ye command me. But my lords I require you
let me have a clerk assigned to me / that he may write all such expenses as
I have laid out in time past / in Almayne and in Beam / in procuring the
kings marriage. And if there be any reast / I beseech you let me have the
kings grace and yours / that I may have reasonable days to pay it. Sir quod
the lords we are content. Thus sir Simon Burle was in prison in the tower of
London.

THan the constable spoke of ser Willyam Helmon and of sir Thomas Tryuet / for
they were not greatly in ye favor of some of the barons of England / nor of
the commontie of the realm / for the vyage that they made in to Flaunders /
For it was said / that never Englysshmen made so shameful a vyage. The
bishop of Norwyche and sir Hughe Caurell / that was as than captain of
Calais were excused. and laid to the others charge / how they had taken
money for the gyueng up of Burbourcke and Grauelyng / Some said / that that
deed was trayson. they were sent for and sir Wylliam Helmon came / but sir
Thomas Tryuer was excused I shall show you how. The same weke that he was
sent for / being in his own house in the North perte / he rode out into the
feldes upon a young horse that he had and spurred him so that the horse ran
away with him / over busshes and hedges / and at last fell in a dyke and
brake his neck / and so sir Thomas Trivet dyed which was great do^mage / and
his death was greatly complained with many good men of the realm. yet for
all that his heirs were feign to pay a certain sum of Floreyns to the
Counsel to the kings behoue / as they said. But the chief encytyng of
those matters came by the kings uncles / and by the general counsel of the
country / as it appeared after in England. For of truth / though the duke
of Gloucestre was the youngest brother in age / yet he was most ancient in the
business of the realm / for he drew to that opinyon that most of the noble
men / and prelates and the commons held. When that sir Them^s Tryuettes
co^posicion was made after his death / by the manner as ye have herd here
before / thereby the penance of sir Wylliam Helmon was greatly assuaged. He
entered with the counsel / and by the means of the valyantnesse of his body /
and the good service that he had done diverse times for England / as well in
Bourdeloyes as in Guyen and in Picardye / where he was always proved a good
knight. There was nothing laid to his reproach / but taking of the money /
for the delyuerau^ce of Burborcke and Grauelynge. Than he excused himself with
fair and sweet words / and made diverse reasonable reasons / and said. My
lords / who so ever were in like case as we were in yt time in the garyson of
Bourburke / I think would do as we did. I have herd sir John^ Chandos and sir
Gaultier of Manny say diverse times / who were right wise and of great valor.
How that a man ought of two or iii. ways chose the best way / and whereby
most to endomage his enemies. And thus sir Thomas Tryuet and I / being in the
garysons of Bourburke and Grauelyng / and saw how we were enclosed on all
parties / and no conforte aperyng to us from any part. And parceyued well /
how we could not endure many assautes / for they that lay about us / were as
chosen men of arms / as ever I saw / or I trow any other Englysshemenne. For
as I knew justly by the report of our harraude / they were at leest / a
syxtene thousand men of arms / knights and squyers / and a.xl. thousand of
other. And we were not paste a three hundred spears and as many archers. And
also our garysone was of such cyrcuyte / that we could not ente^de on every
place. And that we well perceived by an assaut that was made us on a day / For
while we were at our defense on the one part / they cast in fire on the
other part / whereby we were greatly abashed and that our enemies right well
parceyued. And therefore to say the truth / the French king and his
counsel wrought by great ge^tylnesse / seeing ye case that we were in / to
give us trewse. For if they had given us another assaute the next day / as
they were ordained to do / I think they had taken us at their pleasure. yet
for all this / they courtesly treated with us / by the means of the duke of
Bretayne / who took great pain in that matter. And where as we should have
given them money for our raunsommes / if we had been taken / as it was lykely
/ they gave us money / whereby we did them dommage / and it was in them to have
endomaged us. We thought we conquered greatly on them when we had of their
money / and departed our self safe and without trouble / and had with us
all that we had won in all the war time / on the fronters of Flanders. And
my lords beside that / to pourge me of all blame / if there be any person in
England or without / knight or Esquyer / Except the persons of my lords the
dukes of Lancaster / york / and Gloucester / that will say and abide thereby /
that I have done any untruth to the king my natural lord / or accuse me of
any trayson. I am here redye to receive his gauge / and to put my body in
adventure by deeds of arms to prove the contrary / as the Judge thereto
assigned shall ordain. These words and such other / and the valiantness of
the knighte excused him greatly / and saved him from the parell of death: And
afterward he returned again in to his fourmer estate / and was after that a
right valiant knight / and auaunsed in to the kings Counsel. But as at that
time / sir Simon Burle was not delivered out of prisone / for the kings uncles
hated him gretlye / and so did all the commontie of England. The king did
all that he might to have had him delivered / all the seasone that he lay at
Shene / but his counsel said it might not be / for his rekenynges were not
clear. Than the king departed and ye duke of Irelande in his company / and
rode toward Bristowe: and the Queen with other ladies and damoselles with
her.

How the king of England departed from London / and how sir Simon Burle was
beheded at London and his nephue also / and how the duke of Lancaster was
dyspleased. Cap. xciiii.
FOr all that the King departed from the marchesse of London / yet the kings
uncles nor their counsel departed not / but tarried still about London. ye
have herd often times said / that if the heed be sick / all the members can
not be well / the malady must first be pourged. I say it / because this duke
of Irelande was so great with the king that he ruled him as he list. He and
sir simon Burle / were two of the princypall cou^saylours that the king had:
for they had a long season governed the king and the realm. And they were
had in suspecte that they had gadered richesse without nombre / and the
renoume ran in diverse places / that the duke of Irelande and sir Simon Burle
had a long season gathered toguyder money and sent it in to Almayne: For it
was come to the knowledge of the kings uncles / and to the counsaylours of the
good cities and towns of England / that held of their party / how they had
sent out of the castle of Dover by see in the night time in to Almayne /
certain cofers and chestes full of money. They said it was falsely and
felonously done / to assemble the richesse of the realm / and to send it in
to other strange countries / whereby the realm was greatly impouerysshed / and
ye people were soroufull and said / that gold and silver was so dear to get
/ that all marchandyse were as deed and lost / and they could not ymagin how
it was / but by this means.

THese words multiplied in such wise that it was ordained by ye kings uncles
/ and by the counsayles of the good towns that were anne^ed unto them / that
ser Simon Burle had deserved punisshment of death And also the archbysshoppe of
Caunterbury said / that in the season when the french king should have come
with his army in to England / this sir Simon Burle gave counsel that the
shrine of saint Thom^s of Cau^terburye should have been taken down and brought
in to Dover castle. And the noise was that he would have had it so / to
thentent that if he had been in any danger / to have taken and stolen it / and
conveyed it out of England These matters were so laid to his charge / yt none
excuse could be herd / but on a day he was brought out of the tower and
beheeded like a traitor / god have mercy on his soul. To write of his
shameful death / right sore displeases me / how be it I must needs do it to
follow the history. Greatly I complain his death / for whan^e I was young I
found him a gentle knight / sage and wise / but by this enfortune he dyed.

HIs nephewe and heir sir Richard Burle / was with the duke of Lancastre in
Galyce the sameseason that this case fell in England / and one of ye most
renoumed in all his host / next the Constable / for he was as sovereign
Marshall of all the host / and was chief of counsel with the duke ye may
well believe that when he knew of the death of his uncle / he was sore
displeased: And also this ge^tyll knight sir Richard Burle dyed in the same
journey on his bed by reason of sickness / as many other did: as ye shall
here after / at place and time conuenyent. When king Richard knew of the
death of this knight / as he was in the marchesse of Wales / he was sore
dyspleased / and swear / how the matter should not pass / sith they had so
put to death his knight / without good reason or tytell of right. The queen
also was sorry and wept for his death / because he fetched her out of
Almaygne. Such as were of the kings counsel douted greatly / as the duke of
Irelande / sir Nicholas Bra^ble / sir Thomas Tryuilyen / sir John^ Beauchampe /
sir Johan Salisbury / and sir Mychaell de la Poule. Also the kings uncles had
put out of office the archebysshoppe if york named Wylliam Neuell / brother
germayne to the lord Neuell of Northu^berlande / which bishop had long
ben treasourer of all England. And the duke of Gloucestre had charged him to
medell no more with the business of the realm / on pain of his life / but
that he should go to york or therabout / when it pleased him in his benifyce /
and dwell there and medell no further. And also it was showed him / how the
honor of his lynage / and in that he was a priest / excused him of many great
matters / sore prejudicial to his honor And also it was showed him / that the
most part of the counsel of the co^montie would have had him disgrated and
put to death / in like manner as sir Simon Burle was.

So he departed fro London and went in to the North to dwell on his benifyce.
with this he and all his lynage were sore dyspleased / and thought surely that
the earl of Northombrelande had brought that matter to pass / for all that he
was of his lygnage / and were neighbors. In to his rome was chosen a right
valyant / a wise / and a sage clerk / ye archebysshop of Caunterbury / who was
gretely in the favor of the kings uncles. He was come of the Mountague and
Salysburies / and was uncle to the earl of Salysbury. there was made of the
kings counsel by the advise of all the commons / therle of Salysbury / the
earl Richard of Arundell / the earl of Northumberlande / the earl of
Deuonshyre / the earl of Notyngham / ye bishop of Norwyche called sir Henry
Spenser. the bishop of Wynchestre chancellor of England abode still in his
office / and was with the kings uncles. the most renomed man in ye counsel
next ye duke of Gloceste was sir Thomas Mountague archbisshop of Canterbury /
and well he was worthy / for he was a dyscrete prelate / and took great pain
to reform the royalme and to bring it in to the right way / and that the
king should put from him the marmosettes that troubled all the royalme. often
times he would speak with the duke of york in yt matter / and the duke would
say to him / sir bishop I trust the matters shall otherwise fall little and
little / then the king my nephewe and ye duke of Irela^de thinks / but it
must be done according to reason / and to abide the time to be to hasty is no
good mean / for surely / if we had not perceived them be times they would
have brought the king and the royal me in such case / that it should have been
at the point of lesynge. The Frensshe king and his counsel knew right well
our dealyng and what case we were in / and that caused yt frensshe men to
auaunce themself to have come hyder so puyssauntly as they would have done /
to have dystroyed us.

How the counsel drew together for the reformacyon of the king and of the
realm / and how by the counsel of the duke of Irelande the king was of the
accord too make war against his uncles / and against the cytees and towns.
Ca. xcv.
IN like manner as the kings uncles and ye new counsel of England being at
London / devised of the business of England to reform it / and to bring it
into good estate. So on the other side / the duke of Irelande and his counsel
ymagined night and day / how they might continue in their estates / and to
conde^pne the kings uncles / as ye shall hereafter. When king Richard was
come to Bristowe and the / queen with him: they kept them self in the Castle
there / and men that were far of / believed that ye king lay there for savor
of the duke of Irelande / who said that he would go in to Irelande / and it was
said / that the king would se him dispatched It was agreed by the general
counsel / that if he would go in to Irelande / he should have at the cost of
the realm five hundred men of arms / and fyftene hundred archers / and that
he should abide there three year / and to be well and trewly paid / How be it
the duke had no great will to make that vyage / for he saw well the king was
young / and as than he might rule as he list. Therefore he feared if he should
go far of / that the love and the favor that he was in with the king should
assuage. Also beside that / he was in such love with one of the queen's
damoselles / called Lancegrone / yt in no wise he could leave the sight of her.
She was a fair and a pleasant vamosell / and was come with ye queen out of
the realm of Beam. This duke loved her so entierlye / that he would gladly be
deuorsed fro his own wife / who was daughter to the lord of Coucy / and did
send for that entente to Rome to pope Vrbayne. All the good people of the
realm had marueyle thereof / and dispreysed him greatly / for that the good
lady was dought^ / to the daughter of good king Edward / and of ye good queen
Philyppe. The duke of york and the duke of Gloucestre took that deed in great
dispyte but for all their hate the duke of Irelande set little thereby / for he
was so blinded with loving of this damsel / that he promised to be deuorsed
/ and to mary her. He douted not the popes grant / so that he might get the
kings and the queen's good will / for he reputed his wife that he had french /
and brought up in France / and so was her father ye lord of Coucy / and he
had made war against pope Vrbayne / in the tytell of pope Clement / wherefore
pope Vrbayne loved not yt blood. Therefore he said / the pope would enclyne the
lyghtlyer to his deuorse. This matter the duke did put forth / and promised
to La^cegrone to mary her. This duke had a mother a wydowe / called the old
countess of Oxenforde / she agreed not to the opynion of her son / but
blamed him greatly of his folly / and said: How god would be sore displeased
with him / and pay him one day for all / and than^e it would be to late to
repent. and she took the duchess to her / and kept her still in her estate.
And such as ought the lady any good will / gave her great thanks therefore.

THus I have showed you part of the business of England / that fell in this
season. And yet I shall proceed further / as I was enfourmed. ye have herd
how the duke of Irelande was about the king in the marches of Wales / and
night and day ymagyned on none other thing / but how he might bring about
his intent. And so served the king and the queen with fair words to please
them / and caused all other knights and squyers there about / to come to
Bustowe to se the king and ye queen and made them great sport in huntyng. the
king suffered him to do what he list. The same season that the king lay at
Bristowe on the river of Syuerne / in the marches of Wales / The duke of
Irelande took great pain to ride in and out / and specially in to Wales / and
said to such as would here him gentylmen or other. How the kings uncles / to
have the soueraygntie of the realm / had dismyssed out of the kings
counsel / noble / valiant and sage personnages / As the archebysshoppe of
york / the bishop of Dyrhame / the bishop of London / sir Mychaell de la
Poule / sir Nicholas Bramble / sir Johan Salisbury / sir Robert Tryuilyen sir
Johan Beauchampe / and him self / and had put to death a valiant knight
sir Simon Burle / So that and they multiplye in their estate / they will
distroye all England. This duke of Irelande did so much / and preached so to
the people / and to the knights and squyers of Wales / and of the countries
there about / that the most part believed him. And on a day they came
ingenerall to the king to Bristowe / and demanded of him / if that it were
his pleasure / as the duke of Irelande had showed them. The king answered
and said / yea truly. And prayed and commanded them / as they loved him / to
believe him / and said he would auowe all that he should do / affyrmyng how he
thought his uncles were to high minded so that he feared lest they would
surmounte him / and take away his realm from him. And they of the marches of
Wales / always loved the prince of Wales / father to ye king. For by ye
tidings they herd out of the marches of London / they thought justly / that
the king and the duke of Irelande had good cause: And so demanded of the king
what his pleasure was to do. The king answered and said / how he would
gladly that the lo^doners that had done him so great trespasses / that they
were corrected and brought to reason / and his uncles in likewise. They of
Wales said / they were bound to obey their king / nor they ought no faith nor
homage to no man but to him / for he was their king and soueraygne lord.
Wherefore they said / they were ready to go whyder soever the king did command
them. The king was well co^tente with that answer / and in likewise so was
the duke of Irelande. When the Duke saw that the king would show that the
business was parteynynge to him self / and that he had so good desire to
distroye his adversaries / and to bring them to reason. He had thereof great
joy / and said to the^ of his counsel. We can not do better than to
return to London / and show our puissaunce. And so to do / outher by fair
words or otherwise / to bring the Lo^doners to their accord / and to be
obeysaunt to the kings commandment. Always they enfourmed the king / how
that it was a great loss to a realm / when there be many heedes and chief
governors / and how there could no good come thereby / and the king affyrmed
ye same and said / how he would no longer suffer it / but that he would find
such remedy / that other Realms should take ensample by his realm.

Now sirs. I report me if I have not good cause to say / ye the realm of
England in this season / was in great paryll and adventure to have been lost /
without recovery? For the king was moved against his uncles / and against a
great part of all ye great lords of the realm / and they against him: And
the cytes and good towns one against another: And the prelates had great
indignacyon one against another / so that none could remedy it / but alonely
god. When the duke of Irelande saw that he had the agreement of the king / and
of the most perte of the^ of the country of Wales: than he came to the king
and said. sir / if ye will instytute and make me your lieutenaunt / I shall
take a.xii. or a fyftene thousa^de men with me / and go to the marchesse of
London or to Oxenforde / your cite and mine / and there we will show our
puyssaunce against these Londoners and your uncles / who have so great
indignacyon against you. They have put to death some of your counsel. And
sir / outher by fair words or otherwise / we shall bring them to reason. The
king said he was content / Saying / I will and ordain you / to be the chief
sovereign of my Realm / and to reyse up men where ye can get them / and
lead them wheder ye think best / to augment our sygnorie and realm. And to
the intent that every man shall clearly se that the hoole Realm parteyneth to
me / I will that ye bear with you my banners and standerdes / and other
abylmetes of war / such as I would bear my self in battle. And I think
that if the people se my banners displayed / they shall take courage and
hardynesse to sustain my quarrel. And I will ye punysshe such rebels as
will not obey you / in such wise / as all other may take ensample by them. I
believe all such as shall se my banners wave in the wind / shall put them
self under them / and shall be afraid to disobey our commandment. These
words greatly reioysed the duke of Irelande.

oHwe the king of England made his so^mons to draw toward London: and how
sir Robert Tryuylyen was taken at westmynster and beheeded / by the
commandment of the kings uncles. Capi. xcvi.
THe king made his assemble in the country of Wales / and about the fro^ters
of Bristowe / a long the river of Syuerne. Diverse lords and knights were
send for / some excused them self laufully / and some came at the kings
commandment / how be it they douted lest great yuell should come of that
enterprice. In this mean season / the king and the duke of Irelande had a
secret counsel between them / and determined to se^de some of their men in
to the marchesse of London / to se and to know how the kings uncles did /
and what they purposed to do. they studied whom they might send in that
business to know the truth. than a knight cosyn to the duke of Irelande and
of his counsel / called sir Robert Tryuilyen said. sir / ye make doubt whom
to send that is trusty to London / For the love of you I shall take on me to
do that journey. whereof the Duke thanked him / and likewise so did the king
Therewith this sir Robert Tryuilyen departed from Bristowe disguysed / in manner
of a poor merchant upon a little Nagge / and so came to London / and took
his lodging where he was unknown / and so tarried there a certain space and
learned what he could. At last he understood that the kings uncles and the
new counsel of England would keep a secret Parlyament at Westmynster /
wherefore he thought to go and lie there / to learn what should be done there.
And so he came and lodged at Westmynster / the same day that their counsel
began / and lodged in an al^house / right over against the palys gate / and
there he was in a chamber lokyng out at a wyndowe down in to the court / and
there he might se them that went in and out to the counsel / and he knew
nereha^de every man but none knew him / because of his apparel. At last on a
day asquyer of the duke of Gloucesters knew him / for he had often times ben
in his company. And as soon as sir Robert Triuylien saw him he knew him well
and withdrewe him self out of ye wyndowe The squire had suspecious thereof /
and said to him self. Me think I se yonder sir Robert Triuylen / and to
thentent to know the truth he entered in to the lodgyng and said to the wife.
Dame who is that that is above in the chamber? is he alone or with company? Sir
quod she I can not show you / but he has been here a long space. Therewith
the squier went up the better to advise him and saluted him / and saw well it
was true / but he feigned himself and turned his tale and said: God save you
good man. I pray you be not myscontented / for I took you for a farmour of mine
in Essere / for ye are like him. Sir quod he I am of Kente / and a farmour of
sir Johan of Hollandes / and there be men of the bishop of Cau^terburyes that
would do me wrong / and I am come hither to complain to the counsel. Well
quod the squier if ye come in to ye palys I will help to make your way / that
ye shall speak with the lords of the counsel. Sir I thank your quod he /
and I shall not refuce your aid.

THan the squire called for a pot of ale and drank with him / and paid for
it and badde him farewell and departed / and never seized till he came to the
counsel chamber door / and called the vssher to open the door. Than the
vssher demanded what he would / because the lords were in counsel? He
answered and said / I would speak with my lord and master the duke of
Gloucester / for a matter that right nere touches him and all the counsel.
Thanne the vssher let him in / and when he came before his master he said.
Sir / I have brought you great tidings. What be they quod the duke? Sir quod
the squire I will speak a loud / for it touches you and all my lords here
present. I have seen sir Robert Triuylyen disguysed in a vyllayns habytte / in
an alehouse here without the gate. Triuylien quod the duke? yea truly sir quod
the squier ye shall have him or ye go to dinner / if you please. I am content
quod the duke / and he shall show us some news of his master the duke of
Irelande. Go thy way and fetch him / but look that thou be strong enough so
to do that thou fail not. The squier went forth and took four sergiauntes
with him / and said. Sirs / follow me a far of / and as soon as I make to
you a sign / and that I lay my hand on a man that I go for / Take him and
let him not escape. Therewith the squire entredde in to the house where
Tryuylien was / and went up in to the chamber / and as soon as he saw him he
said. Triuylien / ye are not come in to this country for no goodness. My lord
the duke of Gloucester commands that ye come and speak with him The knight
would have excused him self and said. I am not Triuylien / I am a fermour of
sir Johan of Hollandes. Nay nay quod the squire / your body is Triuylien but
your habytte is not / And therewith he made token to the sergiauntes that they
should take him Than they went up in to the chamber and took him / and so
brought him to the palace. ye may be sure there was great prease to se him for
he was well known. Of his taking the duke of Gloucestre was right ioyefull /
and would se him. And when he was in his presens the duke said. Triuylien. What
thing make you here in his country? Where is the king? where left you him?
Triuylien wha^ he saw that he was so well known / and that none excusacion
could aueyle him / said. sir / the king sent me hither to learn tidings /
and he is at Bristowe and hunteth along the river of Syuerne. What quod the
duke / ye are not come like a wise man / but rather like a spy. if ye would
have come to have learned tidings / ye should have come in the state of a
knight. Sir quod Triuylien / if I have trespassed I are pardone / for I was
caused this to do. Well sir quod the duke / and where is your master the duke
of Irelande. Sir quod he / of a troth he is with the king. it is showed us
here quod the duke that he assembleth much people / and the king for him.
Wheder will he led that people? Sir quod he / it is to go in to Ireland. In to
Irelande quod the duke of Gloucester / yea sir truly quod Triuylien. And than
the duke studied a little and said. A Triuylen Triuylien / your business is
nouther fair nor good. ye have done great folly to come in to this country /
for ye are not beloved here / and that shall well be seen. you and such other
of your affinyte have done great displeasures to my brother and to me. and ye
have troubled to your power and with your yuell counsel / the king / and
diverse other nobles of ye realm. Also ye have moved certain good towns
against us. Now is the day come that ye shall have your payment / for he that
does well by reason should find it. Think on your business / for I will
another eat nor drink till ye be deed. That word greatly abashed Triuylen /
for gladlye there is no man would here of his end. He would feign have excused
him self with fair language / in lowly humblyng him self / for he could do
nothing to apease the duke / for he was so enfourmed of him / and of other of
the duke of Irelandes sect / that nothing aueyled him. Where to should I make
lengar the matter / sir Robert Triuylien was delivered to the hangman / and so
led out of Westmynster and there beheeded / and after hanged on a gibet. Thus
ended sir Robert Triuylien.

How tidings came to the king of the death of his knight / and demanded
counsel thereon: And how he ordained the duke of Irelande soueraygne of all
his men of war. Capi. xcvii.
Shortly these tidings came to king Richard and to the duke of Irelande
being at Bristowe / how sir Roberte Tryuylyen was shamefully put to death.
The king took that matter in great dispite and said and swear / that the matter
should not rest in that case. And how that his uncles had done yuell without
title or reason / to put to death his men and knights / and such as had
truly served him and his father the prince: Whereby he said / it seemed that
they would take fro him the crown of England / and that ye matter touched him
nere. Than the archbysshope of york who was sovereign of his counsel / and
had been long / said. Sir ye demand counsel and I shall give you counsel.
your uncles and such as ben of their accord / erreth greatly against you: for
it seems by the^ they would show how ye be cou^sailed but by traitors. They
would have none to beat any rule but them self. It is great parell for all ye
realm for if the commons should rise and rebel great myschefe should fall in
England / if the lords and great men be not friends toguyder and all one.
Wherefore sir / I counsel you find remedy with puissau^ce. ye are as now here
in a country well peopled and named / Send out your commandment to all
such as are bound to serve you / gentylmen and other. And when they be all
assembled / send them in to the marchesse of London / and make your general
captain the duke of Irela^de who gladly will take on him ye charge / and let
no baner nor penon be borne but all only yours / to show thereby that the
matter touches no man but you. and all the country in going thither / will
turn and take part with you and draw to your baners. and parauenture the
landoners will take your part / for they hate you not / for ye did them never
displeasure: All the hurt ye have had your uncles have caused it. Sir / here
is sir Nicholas Bramble who has been mayre of London / and ye made him knight /
for such service as he did you on a day / who knows and ought to know the
manner of them of London for he was borne there / and it can not be but yt he
has good fre^des there. Therefore sir / desire his cou^sail in this matter yt
touches you so nere. For sir / by yuell enformacyon and rumoure of the people
/ ye may lose your signorye. Than the king spoke to sir Nicholas Bramble and
required him to speak. And at the kings request sir Nycholas said. Sir / and
it like your grace / and all my lords here present / I shall speak gladly /
after the little knowledge that I have. First I say I can not believe but that
the most perte of the londoners owes love and favor to the king that here is
/ for perfitely they loved the prince his father / and that they well showed /
when the villayns rebelled / for according to ye truth if they had taken
part with the villayns / they had distroyed the king and the realm. And
moreover / the kings uncles have as now a good time / for they disport them
self among them / and inform the people as they lift / for there is none to
say against them. They have put me out and all the kings of fycers / and have
put in them of their affynite and have sent the king hyder to one of the
borders of his realm. There can no good be ymagined of this / nor it can not
be known per^^rely what they entende / it is a herd matter. but by that they
show they would put the king out of his realm / for they go all by
puyssaunce / and the king does all by gentylnesse. They have put to death
that gentle knight sir Simon Burle / who has done the king much fair
service / in the realm of Englade and in other places. They laid great
falsenesse in him / that he should have delivered the castle of Dover to the
french men. And they informed the people / that he caused the frenchmen to
come in to Flanders and to Sluse / which was nothing so. And also in the
dispyte of the king / they have sha^fully slain sir Robert Triuylien / and so
they will do other / if they may atteygne to their ententes. Wherefore I say /
that it were better for the king to use rygour and puyssau^ce than gentylnesse.
Every man knows thorough the realm that he is king / and how that at
Westmynster ye noble king Edward made every man to be sworn / both lords /
prelates / and all the good Towns / that after his dyscease / they should take
the king here for their soueraygne lord: and the same oath made his three
uncles. And it seems to many as men dare speak / that they hold him not in
the state and form of a king / for he may not do with his own what he list.
they drive him to his pensyon / and the queen also which is a herd thing for
a king and a queen It should seem they would show that they had no wit to
rule themself / and that their cou^saylours be traitors. I say these things
are not to be suffered: As for me I had rather dye / than long to live in
this danger or peril / or to se the king to be led as his uncles would
have him. The king thanne said. Surely it pleases not us. and I say / ye
have counsayled me as honorably as may be / for the honor of us and our
Realm.

AT this counsel at Bristo we it was ordained / that the duke of Irelande
should be soueraygne of all the kings men of war such as he could get / and
to go to London / to know the perfyte ententes of the londoners. Trusting /
that if he might ones speak with them to ^ourne them to his acorde by reason of
such proftes as he would make them / in the kings name. And so within a
short space after / the duke of Irelande with a fyftene thousand men deperted
fro Bristowe and rode to the city of Oxenforde / and there about he lodged
and all his people / and had baners displayed of the kings arms / and none
other / to show that all he did was in the kings tytell and quarrel.
tydinges came to the kings uncles / that the duke of Irelande aproched
toward London with a.xv. thousand men / with the kings baners displayed.
And on a day all the lords were at counsel at Westmynst^r / and had with
the^ the chief of London / such as they trusted best and there they showed
them / how the duke of Irela^de was coming against them with an army royal.
The londoners who were enclyned to their party said. sirs / let the^ come in
the name of god. if the duke of Irelande demand of us battle he shall have
it inco^tynent / we will close no gate we have for. xv.M. men / not and they
were.xx. The dukes were right joyful with that answer / and inco^tynent they
sent out knights / squyers / and messangers / to assemble men of war together
fro diverse perties: and such as were sent for obeyed / for so they had sworn
and promised before. Men came fro ye bysihaprike of Canterbury and Norwiche /
and out of the cou^ties of Arundell and Sussex / and of Salisbury and
Southampton / and out of all the countries therabout London. And so great
nombre of people came to London and knew not what they should do.

How the duke of Irlande sent three knights to London / to know some
tidings. And how the kings uncles and they of London went in to the feldes
to fight with the duke of Irelande and his affinyte. Cap. xcviii.
Now let us so^what speak of the duke of Irelande and of his counsel being at
Oxford with a.xv.M. men / howbeit the most part of them were come thither by
constraynt / rather than of good courage. Than ye duke of Irlande advised to
know thente^tes of the^ of London / and to send sir Nicholas Bra^ble / sir
Peter Golofer / and sir Michaell de la Pole to the tower of London / and to go
thither by water / and to set the kings baners in the hight of the tower / to
se what the londoners would do. These three knights at ye duke of Irlandes
request deperted fro Oxe^forde / and the next day they passed the Te^mes at the
bridge of Stanes and rode to dinner to Shene ye kings place / and there tarried
till it was late: and fro thens rode to another house of the kings called
Kenyngton / and there they left their horses / and took botes and went down
the water with ye tide and passed London bridge and so came to the tower / and
was not known: for no man was ware of their coming. And there they frou^de
ready the captain of ye tower / whom the king had set there before. and by
him these knights knew much of the dealyng of them of London / and of the
kings uncles. And the captain showed them / how they were come thither to
lodge in great danger. Why so quod they? We be the kings servants / and we
may well lodge in his house. Not so quod the captain. All this city and the
counsel would gladly be under the obeysau^ce of the king / so that he would
be ruled by his uncles / and by none other. And this that I show you is of
good will / for I am bound to show you / and to counsel you to the best of
my power. but I am in dout to morrow when day comes / and that it be known in
London that servants of the kings become hither. ye shall se this tower
besieged / both by land and water by the londoners / and not to deperte hens
till they se and know who is lodged within it. And if ye be found here / ye
shall be incontinent presented to the kings uncles: And than ye may well ymagin
what end ye shall come to. I think they be so sore displeased against the
kings counsel / and against the duke of Irela^de / that and ye be taken / ye
shall not escape with your lives. study well upon these words / for I assure
you they be true.

Than these three knights who had wend to have done marueyls were fore
abashed / and there determined to tarry all night as secret as they could /
for fear of spyeng. And the captain promised to keep them sure for that
night / and so kept the keys with him. And in the morning these kynghtes had
diverse ymaginacions and counsayles / to se how they should deal. And all
things co^sydred / they durst not abide the adventure to be known there /
they feared greatly to be there beseged And or day came when the fludde was
come they took a barge and passed the bridge and went to Kenyngton. And when
it was day they took their horses and rode to Wyndsore / and there tarried all
that night / and the next day they rode to Oxe^forde / and there found the
duke of Irlande and his men / to whom they showed all these tidings / and how
they durst not tarry at the tower of London. the duke was pensyfe of those
tidings and wist not what to say nor do / for he knew well all the people yt
he had assembled there / were not all of one courage / wherefore he wist not
wheder it were better to return to ye king or to abide there He took
counsel with his knights / and finally their counsel rested / that sithe
ye king had ordained him to be Constable over all his people / and to correct
and to punysshe all rebels / that he should keep the field / for if he should
do otherwise / it should be to his great blame and rebuke / and to bring him in
to the indignacion of the king / and to show that his quarrel were another good
nor right. And also they said / that it was better for him to dye with honor
and to abide the adventure / than to show any false courage. but they
counsayled him to send word what case he was in / to the king to Bristowe. As
yet they said blessed be god they kept the feldes / and none to recou^tre
them. So thus ye duke sent to the king / desyring him to send him more aid /
which the king did daily.

Tidings came to the kings uncles being at London that the duke of Irlande
with his company were in the marchesse of Oxenforde / There they took counsel
what was best for them to do. There was with the kings uncles / the
archebysshop of Canterbury the earl of Arundell / the earl of Salysbury / the
Earl of Northumberlande / and diverse other lords and knights of Engla^nde /
and the rulers of London. There it was ordained by the duke of Gloucester /
that without delay they should issue out in to the feldes / and that the mayre
of London should put in to harness all the people in every ward / such as
would aid them. Saying surely / how they would go and fight with the duke of
Irlande / whersoeuer they could find him. the mayre of London was as than a
man of arms. He took chosen men between the age of twenty years and.xl. And
the lords were a thousand men of arms. They departed fro London and went and
lodged at Braynford and there about / and the next day at Colebroke / and
daily the nombre increased / and so took the way to Redyng / to pass the
temmes there about / for the bridges between Wyndsore and Stanes were broken /
by the commandment of the duke of Irelande. So long they iourneyed that they
aproched nere to Oxenforde. tidings thereof a none came to the duke of Irelande
/ than he began to dout and took counsel. Than he was cou^sayled to take
the feldes / and to put his people in order of battle / and to display yt
kings baners / saying by the grace of god and saint George the journey should
be his. As it was devised so it was done. Than they sowned their trumpettes /
and every man armed him and issued out of Oxenforde in order of battle / with
the kings baners displayed / the day was fair and clear and a pleasant
season.

How the kings uncles wan the journey against the duke of Irela^de and how he
fled / and diverse other of his company. Cap. xcix.
TIdinges came to the duke of Gloucester being within three leages of Oxenforde
/ by a river side / which falls in to the te^mes a little beside Oxenforde.
how that the duke of Irelande was drawn in to the feldes / in order of
battle / whereof the duke of Gloucester had great joy and said / how he
would fight with him if he might pass the river. Than trumpettes sowned ye
dislodging and ordered them self ready to fight. They were within two leages of
their enemies and sertched to pass the river / and sent out people to
sertche the depnesse of the water. and they found the river in such apoynt /
than in.xxx. years before it was not so base. And so ye scurers passed at their
ease / and rode and aduysed the manner of their enemies / and than returned to
the duke of Gloucester and said. Sir / god and the river is this day on your
part / for the river is so low that it is not to the horse belly. And sir / we
have seen the manner of the duke of Irela^de / they be ready raynged in the field
in good manner. We can not say if the king be there or no / but the kings
baners be there with the arms of England and of France / and none other.
Well quod the duke a gods name so be it / of that arms I and my brother have
part: auau^ce forward in the name of god and saint George / let us gose the^
nerer. Than every man rode forth with great courage / when they knew they
might pass the river at their ease / and so shortly all their host passed
the river.

Tidings came to the duke of Ireland how the kings uncles were passed the
river of Te^mes / and how they should have battle brefely. Than the duke of
Irelande was abashed / for he knew well if he were taken / ye duke of
Gloucester would cause him to dye shamefully / and that nouther gold nor silver
should ransom him. Than he said to sir Peter Golofer and to sir Mychaell
Pole sirs surely my courage bears yuell against this journey / nor I dare not
abide ye bataile against the kings uncles / for if they take me I shall dye
shamefully. How the devil is it / that they be passed the river of Te^mes? It
is but a poor token for us. Why sir quod the two knights / what will ye do? I
will save myself and you also quod the duke / and the rest save them who can.
Well sir quod the knights / than let us draw our self out a side on a
wynge / and so we shall have two strings on our bow. We shall se how our men
do / if they do well / than we shall abide for the honor of ye king who has
sent us hither / and if they be disco^fited we shall take yt feldes / and take
the advantage by flyeng / and save our self where we may. This counsel was
holden good. Than the duke and these two knights rode a long their battle /
and made good vysage and said. Sirs keep your batayls in good order / and by
the grace of god and saint George / we shall have this day a fair journey /
for the right is ours / it is the kings quarrel / therefore we shall speed the
better. Thus they rode up and down dissymulynge / at last they get them
self out of the prease / and so came to one of the corners of the battle and
made a wynge / and therewith there came on the duke of york and the duke of
Gloucestre and other lords / with their baners displayed / making great noise
with trumpettes. And as soon as the duke of Irelandes company saw them
coming in so good order / and so fiersly / They were so aba^shed that they
held none arraye / but turned their backs and fled. For ye noise ran /
how the duke of Irelande and his counsel were ^edde and gone. And so than
every man fled / some hither and thither they wyste not whyder / without
making of any defense. And the duke of Irelande and the two knights of his
counsel fled biforce of their horses / and had no mind to return to the
town of Oxenforde / but withdrewe thens as much as they might.

When ye duke of Gloucester saw the the demeanor of his enemies / and saw
how they fled / he had remorse in his conscience / and would not do ye
yuell he might have done: for he knew well that many of them that were there
present / were there rather by constraynt and by insytacion of the duke of
Irelande / than for any good love. Therefore he said to his men. Sirs the the
journey is ours. I charge every man on pain of death / that ye slay no man /
without he make defense / and if ye get any knights or squyers bring them to
me. His commandment was done / so that there were but few slain / without
it were in the prease as they rode one over another. In ye chase there was
taken little sir Johan Beauchampe and sir Johan Salisbury / and they were
presented to the duke of Gloucester / who was right joyous of them. Than the
duke took the way to Oxenforde / and gave leave to all his men of war to
return to their own houses / and thanked them of the service they had done
to him and to his brother / and said to ye mayre of London and his company.
Sirs / depart you all home again / whereof they were all glad. Thus departed
that army.

How the duke of Irelande and his company fled / and how the kings uncles
were at Oxenforde. And how sir Nycholas Bra^ble was beheeded / and how the
king was sent for by the bishop of Caunterbury. Capi. C.
How shall I show / what became of ye duke of Irelande and of sir Peter
Golofer and sir Michaell de la Pole. As I showed before they saved themself /
as it was needful for the^ / for if they had been taken / they had suffered
death without mercy. I can not say if they went to the king or not / if they
did they tarried not long / but departed the realm of England as soon as they
could. and as I have herd reported they rode through Wales / and took shypping
at Carleon and sailed in to Scotland and came to Edenborowe / and there they
took another ship and sailed costyng Friselande and the isle of Theseley and
the country of Hollande / and so came and arrived at the town of Dondrest.
Than were they glad and as I was informed the duke of Irela^de had long
before conveyed by lo^bardes / much gold and silver to Bruges for fear of
all casueltes / for though he was great with the king / yet always he douted ye
kings uncles / and the commons of the realm. Wherefore he made prouisyon
before hand of money / to aid him when need were / and as it was showed me /
the threscore thousand frankes that he had received for the redempcyon of the
children of Bretayne / and specially for John^ of Bretayne for Guy was deed.
Which money (as it was said) he found ready there at his coming / and he
should receive more: In three year other threscore thousand frankes. Wherefore
he was not abashed for he had substance suffycient for a long space. And
when duke Aubert of Bauyer / who had Haynalte / Holande and zelande in
governance / under the earl Willyam his brother / who as than was living.
When he understood that the duke of Irelande was come / as a fugetyue out of
England / in to the town of Dordrest. He studied and imagyned a little / and
thought he should not long abide there / seeing that he was fled out of
England / and had the yuell will of his cosyn germayns / to whom he bare his
love and favor. And also he consydred / how the duke of Irelande had dalte
but yuell with his cosyn germayen / the lady Isabell of England / who had been
lady of Coucy. Wherefore he commanded the duke of Irelande / because he had
displeased his cosyns of England and had broken his laufull marriage / and
would mary another wife / That he should depart out of that country / and
get him another lodging / And that he should not be suffered to abide in no
town of that country. When the duke herd that / he douted that he should be
taken / and delivered in to the hands of his enemies. And he humyled him self
greatly to them that were sent to him / and said he would gladly obey the
duke Aubertes commandment. And so paid and trussed / and entered in to a
vessel and all his / on the river of Mornegue. And did so much by water and
by land / that he came to Berette / which town pertayned to the bishop of
Trece. There he was well received / And there he tarried till he hard other
tydinges. Now let us leave spekyng of him / and speak of England.

AFter the ending of this journey that the kings uncles had against the duke
of Irela^de beside Oxenforde / and that every man was gone home. The bishop
of Caunterbury and the two dukes tarried still at Oxenforde / I can not tell
how long. And there was beheededde the little Beauchampe and sir Johan of
Salisbury. After that justice the two dukes returned to London / and there
tarried a season to here some tidings fro the king / and they could here none
/ but that he was at Bristowe. Thanne the lords at Westmynster by the
instigacion of the archebysshoppe of Caunterbury / determined / that it should
be honorable for them to send to the king to Bristowe / and to show him
amyably that he has been a certain spape / against the most part of his
realm / who loved him better and are gladder to keep his honor / than such
marmosettes as he has believed / by whom his realm has been in great trouble
and peril. In this mean season was brought to London sir Nycholas Bramble /
who was taken in Wales / as he fled from the journey / to have saved him
self / of whose taking the kings uncles were right joyful and said / how
they would make no stoore of him / but he should go the same way as the other
had done before. he could never excuse himself but that he must dye. He was
beheeded without London / his death was sore complained of some men of London /
for he had been mayre of London before / and had well governed his office /
and did one day great honor to the king / when he slew with his own hands
Lyster / whereby all the rebels were disconfyted / and for that good service
the king made him knight. But in the manner (as I have showed you) he was
beheeded / by reason of the ouermoche beleuynge of the duke of Irelande.

AFter the death of sir Nicholas Bramble / the kings uncles saw / that all
such as they hated / and would have out of the kings counsel were deed and
fled a way. Than they thought the king and the realm should be brought in
to good order / for though they had slain some of the kings counsel / and
chased them away / yet they could not take away the signorie of the king /
but thought to rule the realm in good form / to the honor of the king and
his realm. Than they said to the bishop of Canterbury. Sir / ye shall go
like your self to Bristowe to the king / and there show him what case the
business of his realm is in / and reco^maunde us to him / and show him in
our behalf / that he give no credence of light enformacion against us: He has
believed some to much for his own honor / and for the profit of his realm.
And say also to him / that we require him / and so do all the good people of
London / that he would come hyder / he shall be welcome and received with great
joy. and we shall set such counsel about him / yt he shall be well pleased.
And we charge you return not again without him / and desire him not to be
displeased / though we have chased away a meny of traitors that were about
him / for by them his realm was in great paryll of lesynge. The bishop said
he should do right well his message / and so departed and rod forth like a
great prelate / and so came to Bristowe / and the king was there but with a
priuye company: For such as were wont to have been of his counsel were deed
and fled away / as ye have herd before. The bishop was in the town two
nights and a day or ye king would speak with him / He was so soore dyspleased
with his uncles / for driuynge away of the duke of Irelande whom he loved
above all men / and for sleeynge of his knights. Finally he was so entysed /
that he consented that the archbysshop should come in to his presens. When he
came before him he humyled him self greatly to the king / and there showed
the king every word as the kings uncles had given him in charge. And showed
him / that if it were his pleasure to come to Londou to his palys of
Westmynster / his uncles and the most part of all his realm would be right
ioyeouse / else they will be right sort and yuell displeased / And said sir.
Without the comfort / aid / and accord of your uncles / and of your lords /
knights / and prelates: and of your good cities and towns of England ye
can not come to any of your ententes. He spoke these words boldelye / and
said moreover. Sir / ye can not rejoice so much your enemies / as to make
war with your friends / and to keep your Realm in war and myschiefe. The
young king by reasone of the bysshoppes words began to enclyne / how be it
the beheedynge of his knights and counsaylours / came sore in to his courage.
So he was in diverse ymaginacions / but finally he refrayned his displeasure /
by the good means of the queen / ye lady of Boesme / and of some other wise
knights that were about him / as sir Richard Stoner and other. Thanne the
king said to the bishop. Well / I am content to go to London with you.
whereof the bishop was right joyous / and also it was to him a great honor /
that he had spedde his journey so well.

WIthin a short space after / the king departed and lefce the queen still at
Bristowe / and so came toward London with ye archbysshoppe in his company /
and so came to Wyndsore / and there the king tarried a three days. Tidings came
to London how the king was coming / every manne was glad. Than it was
ordained to mete him honorably. The day that he departed fro Wyndsore / the
way fro Braynforde to London was full of people / on horse back and a foot to
mete the king. And his two uncles / the duke of york and the duke of
Gloucester / and Johan son to the duke of york / the earl of Arundell / the
earl of Salisbury / the earl of Northumberlande / and diverse other lords and
knights. and prelates departed out of London / and met with the king a two
mile fro Braynforde. There they received him swetely / as they ought to do
their soueraygne lord. The king / who bare yet some displeasure in his heart
passed by / and made but small countenance to the^ / and all the way he
talked most with the bishop of London: at last they came to Westmi^ster. The
king alyghted at his palis which was ready apparelled for him. There ye king
drank and took spyces / and his uncles also / and other Prelates / lords /
and knights. Than some took their leaves. The kings uncles and the
archebysshoppe of Caunterburye with the counsel / tarried still there with the
king / some in the Palais and some in the abbey and in the town of westminster
to keep the king company / and to be nere toguyder co commune of their
business. there they determined what should be done.

How by the king and his uncles all the lords of England were sent for to
come to westmynster / to a general counsel there to be holden. Cap. C.i.
A General Parlyament was ordained to be holden at Westmynstre / and all
prelates / Earls / Barons / and knights / and ye counsayles of all the good
towns and cytees of England were sent for to be there / and all such as
held of the king. The archebysshoppe of Cauntorbury showed to the kings
uncles and counsel that when king Richard was crowned king of England /
and that every man was sworn and made their releues to him / and that wha^ he
received their faythes and homages he was within age / and a knyge ought not to
govern a royalme till he be xxi. years of age / and in the mean season to be
governed by his uncles / or by his next kynne / and by wise men. The bishop
said this because the king as then was but newlye come to the age of.xxi.
years / wherefore he counsayled that every man should be new sworn / and
renew their releues / and every manne new to knowledge him for their
soueraygne lord. This counsel was excepted of the kings uncles / and of all
other of the counsel. And for that intent all prelates and lords / and
counsayles of good cities and towns were sent for to come to Westminster at a
day assigned. Every man came thither / none disobeyed / so that there was much
people in London and at Westmister. And king Richard was in his chapel in the
palys / rychely apareyled with his crown on his heed and the archebysshoppe of
Canterbury sang the mass. And after mass ye bisshoppe made a collasyon. And
after that the kings uncles did their homage to the king and kyssed him / and
there they swear and promised him faith and homage for ever And than all other
lords swear / and prelates / and with their hands joined together they did
their homage / as it aparteyned / and kyst the kings cheke. Some the king kyst
with good will and some not / for all were not in his in ward love but it
behooved him so to do / for he would not go fro the counsel of his uncles /
But surely / if he might have had his intent he would not have done as he did
/ but rather have taken crewell vengeance / for the deche of sir Simon Burle /
and other knights that they had put fro him and slain without desert as he
thought. Than it was ordained by ye counsel / that the archebysshop of york
should come and pourge him self / for he had always been of the duke of
Irelandes part / against the kings uncles. When yt bishop of york herd of
this he douted him self / for he knew well / he was not in ye favor of the
kings uncles. Therefore he sent his excuse by a nephue of his / son to the
lord Neuell and he came to London / and came first to the king / and showed
him his uncles excuse / and did his homage in the bysshoppes behalf. The king
took it well / for he loved him better than the bishop of Caunterbury / and
so he him self excused the bishop / or else it had been yuell with him /
but for the kings love they forbear him and took his excuse / and so he tarried
still in his bysshoprike a long space and durst not lie at york / but tarried
at New castle on the river of Tyne / nere to his brother the lord Neuell and
his cosyns. In this estate was at that time the business of England / and so
of a long space ye king was not master over his counsel / but his uncles
and other bare all the rule. Now we will leave to treat of the matters of
England and speak of the business of the king of Castyle and of the king of
Portyngale / and of their wars.

How the king of Portyngale with his puissan^ce assembled with the duke of
Lancastre and his puyssaunce / and how they could not pass the river of Derne
/ and how a squire of Castyle showed the^ the passage. Cap. C.ii.
IT is reason sithe the matter so requires / that I return again to ye duke
of La^castres journey / and how he perceyuered all this season in Galyce / I
shall begin there as I left / for I have great desire to make an end of that
story. When the duke of Lancastre had won and conquered the town and castle
of Dauranche in Galyce / and brought it under his obeysaunce / and refresshed
him there four days / for there he found well wherewith. Than the fyfthe day
he departed / and said he would go to the castle of Noy / and so he did /
and lay four days in a fair medowe alonge a river side. But the ground was
dried up by reason of the heat of the son / and the water corrupted / so
that their horses would not drink thereof / and such as did / dyed. Thanne it
was ordained to dislodge thens / and to turn again to Auranch / for sir
Richard Burle and sir Thomas Morryaulx marshalles of the host / said it was
not possible to get the strong rastell of Noy but by long siege / by great
wisdom and dispense / and much artillary. And also tydinges came to the duke
of Lancastre / that the king of Portugale approached with all his host / to
the nombre of a thousand spears / and ten thousand able men. So that the
two hoostes together were lykely to do a great deed / for the duke of Lancastre
had a fyftene hundred spears knights and squiers / and a six thousand
archers. These tydinges reioysed greatly the duke of Lancastre / and so
dislodged fro Noy and went again to Auranche in Galyce / and the duke sent
for the duchess his wife / and the other ladies and damoselles: for the duke
said he would abide there for the king of Portugale / and so he did.

yE shall know / that when king Johan of Portugale and his marshalles had take
the town of Feroulles they rode and aproched Auranch to come to the duke of
Lancaster. And in their way they found the town of Padrone / which rebelled
against the^ / but at their first coming they yielded them to the kings
obeysaunce. The king tarried there and in the marches there about a fyftene
days / and wasted greatly the country of vitayls / and yet they had great
plenty coming daily fro Portugale. Thus these two great hoostes were in Galyce
/ and greatly impouerysshed the country / and the days waxed so hot / yt no
man could stir after nine of the clock / without he would be brent with the
son. The duke of Lancaster and the duchess were at Aurache / and their men
abroad in the country in great pouerie for lack of vitayls / for the^ self
and for their horses. Nothing that was good or sweet could grow out of the
ground / it was so dry / and brent with the son / and that grew was little
worth / for the season was so hot that all was brent. And the English men /
if they would have any thing for them selfs or* for their horses / it behooved
them or their servants to go a forragyng / a.xii. sixtene / or twenty miles
of / which was great pain and danger. And the Englysshmen found the wynes
there so strong / hoote / and brynning that it corrupted their heedes and
dried their bowelles / and burnt their lights and lyuers / and they had no
remedy / for they could find but little good waters to temper their wynes nor
to refresshe them / which was contrary to their natures. For English men in
their own countries are swetely norisshed and there they were bre^t both
within and with out / they endured great poverty. The great lords wanted of
that they were accustomed unto in their own countries.

When the knights and squyers and other of England / saw the danger and
myschefe that they were in / and were likely to be / what for lack of vytayle
and heat of the son / which daily increased. Than they began to murmr and
to say in the host in diverse places. We fear our journey will come to a small
effect and end We lie to long in one place. that is true said other. There is
two things greatly contrary for us. We lead in our company women and wives
who desires nothing but rest / and for one days journey by their wylles /
they would rest fyftene. This distroyeth us and will do / for as soon as we
came to Coulongne / if we had gone forward we had spedde well / and brought
the country to good obeysaunce / for none would have been against us. But the
long taryeng has enforced our enemies / for now they have provided them of
men of war out of France / And by the^ their towns / cities / and passages
be kept and closed against us. Thus they disconfyted us without battle: They
need not to fight with us / for the realm of Spain is not so pleasant a
land to traueyle in / as is France or England / wherein are good villages /
fair countries and sweet ryuers / fair meadows and attemperate air for men
of war / and here is all the contrary. What meant our lord the duke of
Lancastre (if he thought to win this country) to lead in his company women
and children? This is a great let and without reason / for it is known in all
Spaygne / and else where / that he and his brethren are the true enherytours of
the country / at leest their wyfes daughters to king Don Peter. As for doing
of any conquest or tournyng of any towns / the women do little therein.

THus as I have showed you the people langled in the duke of Lancasters host /
one to another. Than tidings came to the duke that the king of Portugale
aproched nere whereof he was joyful. And when the king was within two leages /
the duke with his knights mounted on their horses and rode to mete him / and
there they met amiably and all their companyes. The kings hole host was not
there but tarried behind / in the guydyng of six great lords of Portugale /
as Ponnase of Congne / Vase Martyn de merlo / Posdiche de asne degouse Salnase
de Merlo / sir Anlne Perrier marshall / and Johan Radighes Desar / and diverse
other / and the king had with him a three hundred spears. So at Aura^che the
king and the duke were together. a five days and took counsel toguyder. The
fynall conclusyon was / that they should ride together and enter in to the
country of Camp and to go to the town of Arpent / where sir Olyuer of
Clesquyne constable of Spaygne was / but they wist not how to pass ye river of
Derne which was fell and orgulous at certain times / and specially rather in
somer than in winter / for when the snow and froste melts on the mou^tayns
by reason of the son / than is the river most depest and most dangerous to
pass / for in winter it is frosyn / and than the ryuers are but base and low.
yet for all yt they concluded to ride in to the country of Camp / trustyng at
some place to find some passage This conclusyon was publysshed through all
their hoostes / whereof every man was joyful / for they had lain along space
sore oppressed and in great danger at Auranche and there about / and many were
sore diseased.

Thus the king of Portugale and yt duke of Lancaster departed fro Auranche and
rode toguyder / but their hosts were separated in to two parts / because none
of them understood other / nor had no manner of aqueynta^ce toguyder: And also
to eschew riottes or debates that might have fallen between them / for
portugales are hot and hastye / and in likewise Englysshmen be dispytefull and
fierce. Thus they were appointed by the man hals of both hosts to lodge and to
forage in diverse parts / and not toguyder. Thus they rode forth and were of
chat. puyssaunce able to fight for a journey with king Johan of Castle / and
all his adhenrentes. So long they iourneyed that they came to they river of
Derne / which was not easy to pass / for it was deep and with high banks /
and full of great broken stones / so that but at certain bridges which were
broken / or else so well kept / yt it was in manner impossyble to pass they
might not get over. So these two hosts had great ymaginacio^s how they might
pass. Than so it fell that sir John^ Holande who was constable of the
English host / and the marshalles / sir Richard Butle and sir Thomas
Moreaulx / and their forragers as they rode before / they encountered a squier
of Castle / called Donnage Bangher. He knew well all the passages of the
country / and he knew where there was one passage / that both horsemen and
footmen might easelye pass the river / and he came over at the same passage /
and was taken and brought to the said lords / of whom they were right glad.
And there he was so streitly examyned / and also by the words of the constable
/ who said to him / how he would quyte his rau^some and give him a good
reward if he would show them where they might pass surely the river / for
they said they had herd how there was one sure passage over the river. The
squire who took but light aduysement / and was covetous of the constables offer
/ and was glad to be delivered out of their hands / said. Sirs / I know
well the passage / and I shall show it you and shall be your guide where as ye
and all your men may pass without any danger.

Of this the constable and marshalles had great joy and so rode forth
toguyder / and sent word of this tydinges to the duke of Lancastre / and so
followed the vowarde / and the constables and marshalles came to the passage.
Than the spanysshe squire entered first in to the river / and showed them the
way. And when they saw the passage so pleasant they were right joyful / and
so every man passed over. And when the vowarde was over / they lodged there to
give knowledge to all other that followed after. Than the constable kept his
promise with the squire that was their gyde. And so he departed fro them and
rode to Medena del campo / where the king of Castyle lay / a good town in the
country of Camp. Than the king of Portugale and the duke of Lancastre came
to the passage / which was called Plasce ferarde / because the gravel and
sand there was firm and stable / and without parell. There they and their
hoostes passed over / and the next day the rerewarde / and than they all lay in
the country of Camp. Tydinges came to them of Ruelles / of Cateseris / of
Medena / of Vile arpente / of saint Phagon / and to other cities / towns / and
castles of the country of Camp and Spain / how the englysshemen and
portugaloyse were passed over the river of Derne / and had found the passed /
whereof every man had maruayle and said. This can not be done without trayson /
for they should never have found out the passage / but if some of the country
had showed it to them. The king of castelles lords knew how the squier of
Castyle had showed it them / and was their guide. Thereupon he was taken and
knowledged the troth / as he had done. Thanne he was iuged to dye / and was
brought to Vile arpent and there beheeded.

How the tydinges spread abroad that the king of Portugale and the duke of
Lancastre were passed the river of Derne / and how it came to the king of
Castles knowledge. and how certain of the english knights came and rode
before Vile arpente / and how the king of Portugale and the duke of Lancastre
determined there to tarry the coming of the duke of Burbone. Cap. C.iii.
When the king of Castyle knew how the king of Portugale and the duke of
Lancastre were in yt feldes with a great puyssance and daily aproched whereof he
was sore abashed / and called to him sir Gaultyer of Passac and sir Willyam of
Lignac / and said. I have great maruayle of the duke of Borbon / that he
comes not. Our enemies aproche and keep the feldes / and none encou^treth
them. they waste our country / and the people of my realm are yuell content
that we fight not with them. Wherefore sirs / I require you give me counsel
what is best to do. These two knights who knew more of deeds of arms than
the king did / for they had more used it / and therefore thither they were sent
out of France / they said: Sir / surely the duke of Borbon comes without
fail. And when he comes we shall take counsel what we shall do / but till
he come / let us make no countenance of battle. Let our enemies go and come
whyder as they list / let them keep the feldes and we shall keep the towns
that be strong / and well provided both with men and vytayles. They shall be
in the son and in great heat / and we shall be in the shadow and in the
fresshe air. They shall find ye country wasted and pylled / and the more
forewarde that they go / the less sustynau^ce shall they find. And therefore
sir / at the beginning to eschew all inconuenyentes / all little hooldes were
beaten down / and manners and churches such as men of the country would have
put in their goods / and this was wisely done. or else now your enemies should
have found places to have rested in / and as now they shall find nothing
without they bring it with them / but heat and the son on their heedes /
the which shall burn and slay them. And sir all your towns / cities / and
castelles are well garnysshed and provided for with good men of arms /
artyllery / and vytayles. I think they shall be skrymysshed withal / for that
is the life and norysshynge of men of war and their pass time / for they
ride about all the world to seek adventures. Therefore sir be nothing
abashed for we trust in this besynes / we shall have no great damage. The
king by reason of these knights words was greatly reco^forted / for he
perceived well they showed him the troth and reason.

Now let us speak of the duke of Lancastre and of the king of Portugale / who
were in the feldes in the country of Camp. They would gladly have been in
some town to have refresshed them / For their foragers when so ever they went
/ could find no thing and for fear of encountrynges / they rode not but in
great companyes. And sometime when they saw a village on a hill / or on the
plain / than they reioysed and would say. Go we thither / for there we shall be
all rich / and well provided / And thither they would ride in great haste. And
when they were there / they found no thing but bare walls / and the howses
broken down / and another catte nor dog / cock nor hen / man / woman / nor
child there / it was wasted before by the frenchemen. Thus they lost their
time / and their horses were lean and feeble / by reason of their poor
norisshyng. They were happy when they found any pasture / and some were so
feeble that they could go no further / but dyed for great heat and poverty.
ye and also some of the great men dyed and were sore dyspleased with hoote
fevers / and had not wherewith to refresshe them / and some time by sodeyn
coldee that took them sleping in ye night. In this case they were in / and
specially in the duke of Lancastres host / for the englisshmen were of a
febler complexion than the portugaloys / for they could well endure the pain
/ for they he hard and accustomed to the air of Castyle. In this case as I
have showed you the englisshmen were in / and many dyed / and namely such as
had but small prouisyon for them self.

SIr Richard Burle / ser Thomas Moreaulr / sir Thomas Percy / the lord
Fitzwater / sir Mabetyne of Linyers sir John^ Dam breticourt / Thyrrey and
Guyllyam of Souuayne / and with them a two hundred horse men / knights and
squyers / such as would auaunce them self / and desyringe deeds of arms. It
a time mounted on their horses the best they had / to the entente to ride to
Vile Arpente / to awake the frenchmen that were therein / for they had herd
surely how sir Dlyuer of Clysson was within that town / who was constable of
Castyle / and with him a great nombre of good men of arms. These lords with
their company rode forth in a morenynge / and came to a little river that
ran before the town / and passed over. The larome rose in the town and
brute that the english men were come to the barryers. Thanne knights and
squiers armed them quickly / and came to the co^stables lodginge / and their
varlettes sadled their horses and brought the^ to their masters. the constable
would not by his will have suffered them to have issued out against the
englysshmen / but he could not let them / their corages were so fierce: And so
they issued out well horsed / and in good order. First issued sir Johan of
Bars / the vicounte of Barlier / sir Johan of Brakemou^t / sir Pyer of
Wyllannes / sir Tristam de la gayll and diverse other / with great desire to
fight against the englisshmen. And when the englysshmen had made their course
before the town / than they passed again the river / where as they had paste
/ and drew to gyther on ye sands / and fair and easily with drew fro the
river a three bowshottes. Than the french knights came cryeng their cries
every manne his spear on the thyghe. And when the Englysshmen saw them /
suddenly they turned with their spears in the restes. There was a sore
rencou^tre / and diverse over thrown on the sands / on both parties. And when
that course was done they left not so / but skrymysshed to gyther / but the
powder of the subtyle sands rose up so thycke / that one of them could natse
a another / nor know each other / so that themself nor their horses could
skant draw their brethes / their mouths were so full of dust / So that thereby
each party was feign to withdraw by their cries. Thus they departed / and no man slain / nor greatly hurt. And because of this course that the english
knights made / they paste that day but one leage fro the town of Arpente /
and so returned to their lodgings / and sycknesse took them / heat / cold /
and fevers. The duke of Lancastre wyste not what to say nor do / for he saw
well how his men fell sick daily and lay in their beds. And he was himself
so weary and heavy / that gladly he would have layen in his bed / and it had
not ben for discoragynge of his people. And on a day he spoke with the king of
Portugale / and demanded counsel of him / desyringe him to give his best
advise what was best to do / for he feared great mortalyte to fall in his
host. than the king said. Sir / it seems well how that the spaynyardes nor
frenchmen will not fight with us at this time / they purpose to suffer us to
waste our selfs and our prouysions. Why sir quod the duke / and what will ye
than counsel us to do? I shall show you quod the king Portugale. as for this
season while the son is so hoote / that ye and your people draw again in to
Galyce / and let every man refressh him self / and at March or April than
come to the field again. and do so much that new aid and comfortemaye come
to you out of England by one of your brethren. A realm is not so soon
won / and specially to agree with the air not acustomed before. Let your men
go and pass their time in such towns and forteresses as ye have in Galyce /
under your obeysaunce. This may well be quod the duke / but than may fortune
to fall / as I shall show you / that is. When our enemies sees that we be
departed one fro another / you into Portugale and I into Galyce / at saint
Jacques or at Colongne. Than the king of Spain will ride with great puyssaunce
/ for I have herd that he has four thousand spears / frenchmen and
bretons / and he shall find as many mo in his own country. And also the duke
of Burbon uncle to the french king comes after with two. M. spears / and
as soon as he comes he will set forward: so that and we be than at home in
our countries / or we can assemble together again / as we be now / out
enemies shall do us great damage. Thanne the king said. Well / than let us
keep still the feldes in the name of god / as for my men be fresshe enough /
and are of good mind to abide the adventure / and I with them.

THus they determined to abide the coming of the duke of Burbon / to se if
they should be fought withal thanne or not / for they all demanded nothing
but battle. The time went ever forward and the son mounted / and the days
chafed meruaylously for it was about mydsomer / when the son was in his
strength / and specially in Spain and Granade / and in the far countries of
Septentryon. Nor after Aprell there fell no rain nor swetnes fro Heuyn /
whereby every thing was burnt on the earth. The englissh men eat grapes when
they might get them / and drank of the hot wynes / and the more they drank
the more they were set a fire / and thereby burnt their lyuers and longes / for
that dyete was contrary to their nature. Englyssh men are norisshed with good
metes and with ale / which keeps their bodies in temper: and there the nyghtes
were hoote / because of the great heat in the day / and the morning
meruaylously cold / which dysceyued them. For in the night they could suffer
no thing on them / and so slepte all naked / and in the morning cold took
them or they were wax / and that cast them in to fevers and flyxes without
remedy. And as well dyed great men as mean people.

How the duke of Lancastre gave license to his men / and how a haraulte was
sent to the king of Castyle / and how three knights of England went to
speak with the king of Castyle for a saueconduct / for the dukes men to pass
through his country. Cap. C.iiii.
Behold now and se how fortune turned. ye may well believe that the duke of
Lancastre being in the realm of Castyle / could never have lost by battle
/ nor his men dyscomfetted / nor lost his men as he did in that voyage / by
reason of sycknes. And him self also nygh deed. And sir Johan Holande who was
constable of the host / when he saw his friends and men thus infected with
this malady / without remedy / and herynge the complayntes of one and other /
saying each to other. Ah the duke of Lancastre has brought us to dye in
Spaygne / cursed be this voyage? He will never have Englysshman more to come
out of England to serve him. He spurneth against ye prick / he would his men
should keep the country when it is won. And when his men be all deed / who
shall thanne keep it? He shows not that he can any skyll of the war / sithe
he sees that none comes against us to fight in battle. why does he not
draw than into Portugale or into some other place? than he should not have the
damage nor loss that he heth / for thus we shall all dye without any strokes.
When sir Johan Holande herd and understood these words / for the honor and
love of his lord the duke of Lancastre / whose daughter he had married / he
came to the duke and said quickly to him. Sir / it must behoue you to take new
and short counsel / your people be in a hard case / and lykely to dye by
syckenesse / if need should fortune they are not able to aid you. they be weary
and in a hard case / and their horses deed / so that noble men and other are
so discoraged that they are not like to do you any good service at this time.
Than said the duke. And what is best than to do / I will believe counsel for
it is reason? Sir quod the constable. Me think it were best ye gave license
to every man to depart where as they think best / and your self to draw
outher into Portugale or into Galice / for ye are not in the case to ride
forewarde. That is true quod the duke / and so I will do. Say you to them
how I do give them leave to depart whyder it please the^ / outher in to
Castyle or in to France / so they make no false treaty with our enemies / for
I se well for this season our war is paste / And pay every man their wages /
and reward them for their costs. Sir quod the constable this shall be done.

SIr Johan Holande made it be known by a trumpet in every lodgyng / the
entencion of the duke of Lancastre / how he did give license to every man to
depart / whyder they list / and that every capytayne should speak with the
constable / and they should be so paid that they should be content. This
tidings reioysed some / such as desired to depart to change the air. Than
the barons and knights of England took counsel / how they might return
in to England. it was thought impossyble for them to return by the sea / for
they had no ships ready / and were far fro any port. And also their men
were so sick with fevers and flixes / that there were many deed / and so sick
/ that they could not endure ye travail on the sea. So all things considered
they thought it best to repair home thorough the realm of France. Than some
said / how may that be? for we be enemies too all the realms that we must
pass through. First through Spain / for we have made them open war. The
king of Nauer in likewise is joined in this war with the king of Castyle /
and also the king of Aragone / for he is alyed with the french king. and
also he has done to us a great dyspite / he has take and laid in prison at
Barselona the archebyhop of Bordeaux / who went thither to demand the
arerages that the realm of Aragonoweth / to the king of England our
soueraygne lord. And to send to the french king it is hard for us to do. it
is far of / and peradventure when our messanger comes to the king (he is
young) and peradventure his counsel will do nothing for us. for sir Olyuer
of Clysson constable of France hates us mortally / for he will say that the
duke of Bretayn his great adversary / will become englissh. Than some other
that were of great wisdom and imaginacyon said. All things consydred / we
think it best to assay the king of Castyle / we think he will lightly
condyscende to suffer us to pass through his country peasably / and to get
a saueconduete fro the kings of France / Aragon / and Nauer.

THis counsel was taken / kept and herd / and a Haraulde called Derby was
sent forth to the king of Castyle with letters. This haraulde rode forth
and came to Medena de campo / and there he found the king of Castyle / and
than he kneled down and delivered his letters. And the king opened them and
read them / they were written in french. When he had well understand them
he turned him and smyled / and said to a knight of his. Go and make this
haraulde good chere / he shall be answered to night and depart to morrow. Than
the king entered in to his secret chamber and sent for sir Wyllyam of Lygnac
and for sir gaultyer of Passac / and red to them the letters / and demanded of
them what was best to do. I shall show you the substance of the matter. Sir
Johan Holande constable of the duke of Lancastres host / wrote to the king of
Castyle / desyring him to send by the herault letters of safeco^ducte for.ii.
or three english knights to go and come safe / to speak and to treat with
him. Than these knights answered and said. sir / it were good ye did this /
for than shall you know what they demand. Well quod the king / me think it
is good. Than there was asafeco^ducte written / co^teyninge that six knights
might safely go and come at the poyntyng of the constable. This was sealed with
the kings great seal and sygned with his hand and delivered to the heralt /
and xx. frankes in reward. Than he returned to Aura^che where the duke and ye
constable were.

THe herault delivered the safeco^duct to the constable. Than the knights were
chosen yt should go. sir Mauberyn of Linyere / sir Thom^s Morell / and sir
Johan Dambreticourt. these three knights were charged to go on this message to
ye king of Castile. and they deperted as soon as they might for some thought
long / for there were many sick and lacked phisicions and medicines / and also
fresshe vitaylles. These English ambassadors passed by the town of Arpent /
and there the constable of Castyle sir Olyuer of Clesquy made the^ good chere /
and made them a supper. And the next day he sent with them a knight of his of
Tyntemache a breton / to bring them the more surelyer to the king / for
encou^tryng of ye bretons of whom there were many sprede abroad. and so long
they rode that they came to Medenade Campo / and there they found the king
who had great desire to know what they would. and when they were a lyghted at
their lodgyng and changed and refreshed the^ they went to the king / who made
to the^ good semblaunt / and were brought to hiby ye knights of his house Than
they delivered to the king letters fro the dukes Constable / but none fro him
self / for as than he would not write to the king / but they said. Sir king /
we be sent hyder to you fro the earl of Huntyngdon / Constable with the duke of
Lancastre / A certaynynge you of the great mortalyte and sickness that is
among our men. Therefore the constable desires you / that ye would to all
such as desires to have their health / opyn your cities and good towns / and
suffer them to enter to refresshe them / and to recover their health if they
may. And also that such as have desire to pass in to England by land /
that they may pass without danger of you / of the king of Nauer / and of the
French king but pesably to return in to their own coutreis. sir / this is
the desire and request that we make unto you / as at this time. than the king
answered and said soberly. Sirs / we shall take counsel and advise what is
good for us to do / and than ye shall be answered / than the knights said. sir /
that suffyceth to us.

How these three knights obtained a saueconduct of the king of Castyle for
their people to pass / and how diverse of the^glysshmen dyed in Castyle / and
how the duke of Lancastre fell in a great syckenesse. Cap. C.v.
THus they departed fro the king at that time / and went to their lodgings /
and there tarried all yt day and the next day till none than they went to ye
king. Now I shall show you what answer ye king had of his counsel. This
request greatly reioysed the king / for he saw well his enemies would deperte
out of his realm / and he thought in himself he would agree thereto / yet he
was cou^sayled to the contrary but / he sent for the.ii. french capitayns /
sir Gaultier of Passacke and sir Willm^ of Lignac. and when they were come he
right sagely showed the^ the desire and req^st of ye constable of the English
host / and hervpon he demanded of them to have their counsel. First he
desired sir Water Passacke to speak. He was loathe to speak before other of the
kings counsel there / but he was feign so to do the king so sore desired
him. and so by the kings commandment he spoke and said. Sir ye are come to
the same end that we have always said. and that was / yt your enemies should
wast the^ self / they are now disconfyted without any stroke strikyng. sir /
if ye said folks desire to have comfort and refresshyng in your country / of
your gentylnesse ye may well grant it them / so that wha^soeuer they recover
their health / they return not again to the Duke nor to the king of
Portugale / but than to deperte the straight way in to their own countries:
And that in the Term of six year they arm them not against you nor against
the realm of Castyle. We think ye shall get rightwell a safeconducte for
them of the king of France and of the king of Nauerre / to pass peasably
through the realms. Of this answer the king was right joyful / for they
counsayled him according to his pleasure / for he had not cared what bargeyn
he had made / so that he might have benquyte of the Englysshmen: Than he said
to sir Water Passacke. Sir / ye have well and truly counsayled me I thank you
/ and I shall do according to your advise. Than the three English knights
were sent for.

When they were come they entered into the counsel chamber. Than the bishop
of Burges chaunceller of Spain / who was well langaged said. sirs ye knights
of England perteyning to the duke of Lancaster / and sent hyder fro his
constable: understand that the king here of his pytie and gentylnesse / will
show to his enemies all the grace he may. And sirs / ye shall return to
your constable / and show him fro the king of Castyle / that he shall make it
to be known through al his host by the sown of a trumpet / that his realm
shall be open and ready to receive all the Englysshmen hole or sick / so that at
thentre of every cite or town / they lay down their armure and weapons: And
there shall they find men ready to bring them to their lodgiges. And there all
their names to be written and delivered to the captain of the town / to
thentent they should not return again in to Galyce nor in to Portugale / for
no manner of business / but to deperte in to their own countries as soon as they
may. And as soon as the king of Castyle my sovereign lord has optayned your
safeco^ducte / to pass through the realms of Nauer and France to go to Calis
/ or to any other port or haven at their pleasure: outher in to Bretaygne /
Xaynton / Rochell / Normandy / or Picardy. Also ye kings pleasure is / that
all such knights or squiers of any nacyon what soever it be / that entered in
to this vyage: In any wise arm not them self for ye space of six year
against the realm of Castyle / and that they swear thus to do when they take
the safeco^ducte. And of this co^posycion / ye shall have letters open to bear
to your constable / and to such co^panyons as sent you hyder. These knights
thanked the king and his counsel of their answer and said. sir there be
certain artycles in your answer / we ca^ not tell if they will be accepted or
not. If they be not / we shall send again to you our heraulte / if he come
not we shall accept your saying. Well sirs the king is content (quod they of
his counsel) than the king went in to his chamber. And sir water Passacke and
sir Wyllm^ Lignacke kept still company with the English knights and brought
them in to a fair chamber / where their dinner was ready apparelled for the^ /
and there dyned with them. And after dinner had wine and spyces in the kings
chamber and took their leave. Their letters were ready / and they took their
horses and so departed and rode to Vile cloppes / and the next day they came to
the town of Arpent and dyned / and at night lay at Noy in Galyce / and the
next day they came to Auranche and there found ye constable So it fortuned
that in this mean season / one of the duke of Lancasters great barons died a
right valyant man / called the lord Fitz water: He was greatly bemooned / but
against death none may strive. His enterment was honorably done / the king of
Portugale and the duke of Lancaster present. and when these three knights were
come to the Dukes lodgyng / they showed all that they had done / and showed
their letters of confyrmacion of the same. Than some said it was a herd
covenant / and some said nay: holdyng opinyon that it was right courtesse /
perfitely consyderyng the danger that they were in. These tidings anon sprede
abroad in the host / how the duke had given license every man to depart who so
list. Than such as were sick and feeble / desyring a fresshe air / deperted
as soon as they might / and took their leave of the duke and of the constable
/ and than they were truly paid their wages as curtesly as might be. And some
were content with fair words / and so they departed by co^panyes. some went
to Arpent / some to Ruelles / some to vilcloppes / some to Noy / so^e to Medena
de Ca^po and other places: and in every place they were welcome and brought to
their lodgings / and their names presented to the captain. The greattest
part of the gentylmen went to Arpent / because in that town there were many
strangers / Bretons / frenchmen / normayns and poicteuyns / over whom sir
Olyuer de Clesquyn was captain. The Englysshemen trusted better in them than
they did in the Spaynyerdes / and good cause why.

THus as I have showed you / the duke of Lancastres army brake up at that time
in Castyle / and every man sought the best for him self. ye may well believe
that this did greatly trouble the duke of Lancastre / and great cause why. for
he saw his enterprise ^ore put a back and brought in to a herd case / How
be it like a valiant sage price as he was / he comforted him self as well as
he might / for he saw well it could none otherwise be. And when the king of
Portugale saw how the matter went / and yt their army was broken of / He gave
license to all manner of men / except a three hundred spears that were come to
serve him. He retaygned them still / and so departed fro Aura^che with the duke
of Lancaster and his wife / and rode to saint Jacques called Co^postella. And
when the king and the duke were there / the king tarried there four days: And
than departed with all his men / and returned to his country to his wife /
who lay at Port / a good city in Portugale.

Now shall I show you what befell of diverse knights and squyers / such as
were departed fro the duke and gone in to Castile. Diverse that were entecte
with sickness / for all their chaungynge of new air and new medycins / yet
they could not escape the peril of death. Diverse dyed in Arpent / in the mean
season that the king of Castyle sent to the king of Nauerre and to the french
king for their saueco^ductes / to pass pesably (which was not soon
optaygned) diverse lords / knights / and squyers of England dyed in their
beds which was great damage / and a great loss to their country. In Arpent
there dyed three great barons of England / and rich men. The first was sir
Richard Burle who had been marshall of ye dukes host / another the lord
Ponynges / and the third the lord Percy / cosyn germayne to the earl of
Northumberlande. And in the town of Noy dyed sir Mauberyn of Lymers a poyteuyn
/ a right noble and an expert knight. And in the town of Ruelles there dyed a
great baron called the lord Talbot: So that there died here and there a.xii.
great lords / and a fourscore knights / and two hundred squyers. This was a
great dysconfetture without any stroke stryken / and there dyed of other mean
men / mo than five hundred. And I herd it reported of a knight of England /
as he returned through France (his name was sir Thom^s Quynbery) that of
fyftene hundred men of arms and four thousand archers / that the duke of
Lancastre had brought out of the realm of England / there never returned
again the half part.

THe duke of Lancastre fill in a perylous sickness in the town of saint
Jacques / and often times the brute ran in Castyle and in France how he was
deed / and surely he was in a great adventure of his life. Thyrrey of Souuayne
a squire of honor / and squire for ye dukes body was taken with sickness and
dyed at Besances / he was naturally borne of the county of Heynaulte. And his
brother Wyllyam of Souuayn was with him till he dyed / who in like wise was in
great adventure of his life. Of a truth there was none so hardy / so rich /
nor so tolye / but that they were in fear of the^ self / and every day looked
for none other thing but death / and with this sickness there were none
infected but alonely the duke of Lancasters company. Among ye frenchmen there
were none sick / whereby diverse murmuracyons were among the spanyerdes / saying
/ ye king of Castyle has done great grace to these Englysshmen to suffer them
to lie and rest them in his county / and in his good towns / But we fear it
will cost us greatly / for they have or are like to bring in to this country
great mortalyte. Than other would say: Ah / they are christenmen as we be /
there ought compassion and pity to be taken one of another. this was the
co^munyng among them: And true it was / yt same season a knight of France dyed
in Castile for whom great sorrow was made: For he was gracyous / courtesse / and
hardy in arms / and was brother to sir Johan / sir Raynolde / and sir
Launcelotte of Voy / and he was called sir John^ of Voy / but how he dyed I
shall tell you. He was in a town of Castyle / called Seghome / and lay there
in garyson: he had an Impostume in his body / and he was young and lusty and
took no head thereof / but on a day lept on a great horse and rode out in to
the feldes / and spurred his horse / so that by gambaldyng of the horse the
impostume brake in his body / and when he was returned to his lodging he was
laid on his bed sick / and that seemed well / for the fourth day after he
dyed / whereof his friends were right soroufull.

How sir Johan Hola^de / the duke of Lancastres constable took his leave of the
duke / and he and his wife returned by the king of Castyle / who made him good
chere / and how sir Johan Dambreticourt went to Paris to acomplysshe a deed
of arms / between him and Bouciqualt. Cap. C.vi.
YE may well know that every man eschewed this sickness that was among the
Englysshmen / and fled therfro asmoche as they might. All this season sir
Johan Holande the dukes constable was still with the duke / and certain
knights and squyers / seeing the season of war paste / thinking to eschew
the peril of the sickness / said to the constable. Sir / let us return and
we will go to Bayone or to Burdeux to take fresshe air / and to esche we this
sickness / for when so ever the duke of Lancastre will have us again / let
him write for us / and we shall soon be with him / which were better than to
keep us here in danger and parell. They called so often on him that on a day
he showed the duke their murmuraryons. Than the duke said. Sir Johan / I will
ye return and take my men with you / and recomende me to my lord the king /
and to all my brethren in England. With right a good will sir quod the
constable. But sir / though sick men have had great curtesy by the constable
of Castyle / as in suffering them to enter to a bide there at their case till
they recover their helthes / yet they may not return again to you in to
Castyle nor in to Portugale. and if outher they or we take our way to Calays
through France / than we must be bound to bear none armure in six year
after against the realm of France / without the king our sovereign lord be
present in propre person. Than the duke said. Sir Johan / ye know well that
the frenchemen will take on you and on our men (in case they se them in
danger) all the vau^tage they can do. Therefore I shall show you which way ye
shall pass curtesly through the realm of Castyle. And when ye come in to the
enter of Navarre send to the king / he is my cosyn / and in time past we
had great alyaunce to guyder which are not as yet broken / for since the
war began between ye king of Castyle and me / we have amiably written each to
other / as cosyns and friends / nor no war has been made by see bitwene us
but the frenchmen have. wherefore I think he will lightly suffer you to pass
through his realm. and when ye be at saint Johan Pie de port / than take the
way to Bisquay and so to Bayon / than ye be in our heritage: And fro thens ye
may go to the city of Burdeux without danger of the french men / and there
refresshe you at your ease. And when ye have wind and weder at will / than ye
may take the sea and land in Cornwall or at Hampton / or there as the wind
will serve you. Than sir Johan said your counsel shall be fulfilled without any
fault.

IT was not long after but that the Constable and his company departed / and
there tarried with ye duke and duches / no mo but his own household servants.
And sir Johan Holande had his wife with him and so came to the city of Camores
and there he found the king of Castyle / sir Gaultier of Passacke / and sir
Wyllm^ of Lignacke / who made him good chere / as lords and knights do when
they mete each with other. And truly the king of Castyle was glad tose the
departing of the Englysshmen / for than it seemed to him yt his war was at an
end / and thought that there would never issue again out of England so many
good men of war / in the duke of Lancasters tytell / to make war in
Castyle. Also he knew well how there was great trouble and dyscorde within
the realm of England. When the tidings sprede abroad in Castile / in the
good cities and towns (where as the English men lay sick and were there to
seek for their health) how that sir Johan Hollande was ^ome thither to return
again in to England. They were right glad thereof / and so drew to him / to
the intent to return with him / As the lord of Chameulx / sir Thomas Percy /
the lord Lelynton / the lord of Braseton / and diverse other / to the nombre
of a thousa^de horses. such as were sick thought them self half hole / when
they knew they should return / their voyage paste was so paynfull to them.

When sir Johan Hollande took leave of ye king of Castyle / the king gave to
him and to his company great gifts / with mules and mulettes of Spaygne / and
paid for all their costs. And than they rode to saint Phagons and there
refresshed the^ three days / and in every place they were welcome and well
received / For there were knights of the kings that did conducte them / and
paid always for their costs. So long / they code that they passed Spaygne
and came to Naueret / where as the battle had been before / and so to Pauyers
and to Groyne / and there rested. for as than they were not in certain if the
king of Nauerre would suffer them to pass through his realm or not. Than
they sent to him.ii. knights / sir Peter Bysset and sir Wylliam Norwiche. They
found the king at Tudela in Nauer / and there spoke with him / and spedde so
well / that they had grant to pass through Nauer / payeng for that they
should take by the way: and as soon as these knights were returned / they
departed fro Groyne and so came to Pampylona and passed the mountains of
Rou^ceaux / and left the way in to Bierne / and entered in to Bisquay so to go
to Bayon / at last thither they came / and there sir Johan Holande tarried a long
space with his wife / and other of the Englysshmen rode to Bordeaux. Thus this
army brake up.

So it was / in the season while these wars endured in Castile / and that yt
englisshmen kept the feldes. The lord Bouciqualt the elder of the.ii.
brethren sent by an herault to sir Johan Da^breticourt / desyring to do with
him deeds of arms: as three courses with a (...)/three with an axe / and three
with a dagger all or (...) the knight was agreed thereto. And after that sir
Johan Dambreticourt sent diverse times to acco^plysshe their feate / but
Bouciqualt came not forward / I can not tell what was ye cause / nor I will
not say but that he was a tight good knight / and mete to have done a greatter
feate in arms than that was. And when sir Johan Da^breticourt was come to
Bayone in the company of sir Johan Hola^de / he was in diverse ymaginacions on
his challenge / and thought that honorably he might not depart out of those
parts (seeing he was challenged to do deeds of arms / and had granted thereto)
without he fulfilled the same / for if he returned in to England without doing of
any thing / he thought that the frenchmen would say that he deperted for
fear. Than he took counsel of sir John^ Hola^de and of other / what were
best for him to do. He was counsayled to take the way through France / with
the safeconducte yt the duke of Burbon had got him / and so to go to Paris /
and there to demand for sir Bouciqualt or else by the way / thereby at lest his
honor should be excused. This counsel the knight believed and followed the
same / and so deperted fro Bayon and entered in to Biern / and so came to Artoys
and there found therle of Foiz who made him good chere / and at his depertyng
the earl gave him.ii.C. Florens and a good horse. Than he rode forth through
Byern and entered in to the country of Bigore and so in to Tholousin and in to
Carcassynois / and in his company was Wylliam of Souuayne and other squiers of
Heynault / retournyng in to their countries. So long he rode that he came to
Paris / and at that time the king was in Normandy / and sir Boucikalt as it was
showed him was in Aragon. Than sir John^ Dambreticourt to acquyte his
enterprice / presented him self before certain of the great barons of France
being at Paris / and showed the^ how he was come thither to acquit himself of
his challenge. And when he had tarried there.viii. days he deperted and came
to Calais and they of Heynault in to their own countries. Thus little and
litell the army yt went into Spain and into Portugale brake up.

How the duke of Burbone deperted fro Auygnon to go in to Castyle with all his
host / and came to Burgus in Spain / and there found the king of Castyle: and
how the duke of Lancastre herd those tidings: and how the duke of Burbone
departed fro the king / and went straight again in to France. Cap.C.vii.
IT ought to be supposed / that the duke Loys of Burbon (who was at the
beginning of this enterprise and army / in to Castyle / ordaynedde to be as
chief) was well informed how the matters went. If he had known yt it should
have been so / he would have made the more haste / for it was long or he entered
in to Spaygne / for he took a long way by Auignon to se him that wrote
himself pope Clement / and there tarried a long space / and when he departed he
rode to Mountpelyer and there tarried a five days / and also at Besyers and
Carcassone / Narbone and Parpinyon / and than entered in to the realm of Aragon
/ tose the young king there and his cosyn ye queen yolant of Bare / and so
rode to Baselona and there found the king and the queen his cosyn / and a
great nombre of the lords of the country that were come thither to sest him /
and so they did. and when he had been there a six days he went to Vale^censia
the great and there he herd sure tidings how ye English army was
withdrawn and passed homewarde / and how that sir Johan Hollande was in Nauer
going ho^warde / with a great part of his company / and how there had been a
great death among them. And also he herd how his cosyn the duke of Lancastre
lay sick in Compostella in Galyce: and in diverse places it was said / how
he was deed. How be it though there were as thanne but little to do in Spaygne
/ yet he thought to pass further and send word of his coming to the king of
Castile who was right glad thereof and to mete with him / came to Burgus in
Spain / and there provided greatly for his receyuynge / and such as were
there with him of France / were right glad to se the duke of Burbone. Thus
the duke passed Valencensia and Saragosa and all the ports / and entered in to
Spain and came to Burgus / and there he was well received / and there was sir
Olyuer of Clesquyn constable of Castyle and sir Wylliam of Lignacke / sir
Gaultier of Passacke / sir Johan of Bars / sir Johan and sir Raynolde of Roy
and diverse other knights of France / who left their garysons to come and se
the duke of Burbone / for there was as than no doubt of the Englysshmen nor of
the portugalois / for they were all withdrawn. And the Englysshmen forsook
their garysons that they had won in Galyce / for they knew well they could not
resyst the army of France / seeing their compaignyons were departed diverse
ways / as ye have herd before.

TIdinges came in to Galyce how the duke of Burbon was come in to Spaigne /
and had brought with him great no^bre of knights of France / brute and noise
was more thanne it was in deed / by the one half, The commons were in great
dout / that ye duke of Burbon would have entered there with great force and
puissaunce / but that the duke of Lancaster was there among them / who greatly
conforted them. Tidings came to the duke of Lancastre / how that his cosyn
the duke of Burbone was come in to Spain / and was at Burgus with the king /
and incontinent he sent word thereof to the king of Portugale / desyring him
to gather again toguyder his people / for he knew not what ye french men
would do / seeing the English men were avoided the country. The king of
Portugale / by reason of such alyaunce as was between them he consented / and
departed fro Lirbone and came to Conymbres / and there made his so^mons through
out his realm / every man to be ready. And than he came to the city of Port
to draw nere to the country of Galyce / and to his father in law the duke of
Lancastre / who was not as than in good point to ride / for the sickness
that he had / how beit he began to amend. Now let us speak of the duke of
Burbon / who was with the king of Castyle / who made him as good chere as he
could / and all other prelates and lords of the realm. And many counsayles
there was between them / to determyne what they should do / outher to ride in
to Galyce or else to return. The king of Castyle and they of his counsel saw
clearly / how the matter should best be for their profit / and said each to
other when they were together. By reason of these frenchmen our lands are
wasted and dystroyed / though they be come to keep it / we have taken by them
great damage? wherefore we think it should be good / to thank the duke of
Borbon for the pain and travail that he has endured in cominge hyder. and
let us desire him louyngly to with draw his men of war / seeing henedeth
not to tarry here for any war that is apatente (for as for Galice) the
recovery thereof shall be but a small matter for us. Thus they of the kings
counsel comuned each with other / and further they said. If we ones receive
these people they must be paid of their wages / if not / they will pyll and
rob all the realm / for the common people all ready begins to complain:
and therefore we think it were best to give the^ an honest congy to depart.
This counsel was vpholden and the king well consented there to / for he saw
well it was the most proftye for his people and realm / for they could take
no hurt but it should be to his damage and prejudice. So that one day in the
kings presence the archebysshop of Burgus to the duke of Burbon / and before
many of the knights of France showed and declared to them their ententes /
as ye have herd before. And the duke of Burbon and diverse other knights of
France / who had rather return than to a bide there for the country was not
mete for their complerions) were well content to return / and prepared
themself thereupon. and because the duke of Burbone was last that came / he
returned first / and took his leave of the king / and said how he would
return by the realm of Nauerre. There were great gifts given him or he
departed / and might have had more if he would have taken it / but he refused
every thing / except mules and mul^tte^/and dogs of Spain. Than it was
publisshed that all frenchmen might at their pleasure depart out of Spain /
and return in to France. but there tarried still sir Olyuer of Clesquyn
constable of Spain and the marshals / and a three hundred spears of bretons /
poicteuyns and xayngtons. Thus the duke of Burbone returned. When he had taken
his congy of the king and the queen / and of other lords of Castyle / he was
conveyed to Groyne / and so in to Navarre. And where so ever he came he was
welcome and well received. for the duke of Burbone was gracyous / curteyse /
honorable / and well renomed. And the king of Nauer received him louyngly /
and never showed any manner of yuell will toward the french king / in that
he had taken a way fro him his enherytau^ce of the countye of Eureur in
Normandy / for he saw well the french king that was as than nephewe to the
duke of Burbon / was in no defaute thereof / for wha^ it was done he was but
young. But swetely he showed the duke all his business / desyringe him to be a
good mean between him and his cosyn the french king. The duke promised him
so to be. Than the duke departed / and passed thorough the realm of Nauer
peasably / and all other such as would pass. and thus they passed the
mountayns of Rouseaulx / and all alonge the country of Bastelles / and so
entered in to Bierne and in to Saluaterra.

How therle of Foize received honorably the duke of Burbon / and of the great
gifts that he gave him / and how sir willyam of Lygnac and sir Gaultier of
Passackes company departed out of Spain / and of the incydent that fortuned in
the town of saint Phagon. Cap. C.viii.
When the Earl of Foyz being at Ortays / understood that the duke of Burbon
was at Saluaterra he was glad thereof / and sent for his knights to be about
him. And on a day in great array he rode with a five hundred knights and
squyers two leages out of Ortays / and met with the duke of Burbon / who in
likewise rode with a great rout of knights and squiers / and there they met
amyably / as great princes ought to do. And when they had comuned together a
certain space (as it was showed me) when I was at Ortays. The earl of Foize
drew him a part in the field with all his company / and the duke abode still
in a another part. Than the Earl sent to the duke three knights named sir
Espayne de Lion / sir Peter Capestan / and sir Menaunt of Nowalles. And when
they came before the duke they said. Sir / here is a present that my lord the
earl of Foiz has sent / to you at your returning out of Spain / for he
knows well ye have been at great dyspence / Therefore sir he does give you at
your entering in to his country of Bierne / eight thousand frankes / and this
mulette / and two coursers and two palfreys. Syrs quod the duke / I thank the
earl of Foyze / But as for the floreyns I will take none / as for the other
present I will receive them with a good will. thus the florens were refused /
and the Mules and horses received. Than the earl of Foyz came to the duke / and
brought him in to the town of Ortays / and lodged him in his own place / and
all other were lodged in the town. the duke was three days in Ortays / and had
great there with dyners and suppers. And there the Earl of Foize showed ye duke
a great part of his estate. On the fourth day the duke departed / and the
earl gave to ye knights and squiers great gifts. As it was showed me / the
coming thither of the duke of Burbon cost the earl of Foize ten thousand
frankes. Thus the duke departed and went in to France / and rode by
Mountpelyer and by the city of Puy / and by the countye of Forestes whereof he
was lord by the lady his wife.

FOr all the departing of ye duke of Burben (as ye have herd) out of Spain /
sir Willyam Lignac and sir Gaultier of Passac departed not so soon / nor the
companyes to the nombre of a three thousand spears and sire thousand of other
men of war / and little and little ever they departed. They were many out of
wages and weary of the wars / and so returned yuell horsed and yuell
aparelled / all to torn and ragged. The metynge with such people was nothing
profitable / for they unhorsed whom soever they met / and made war to all
merchants and to men of the church / and to poor people of the country
where any thing was to get. These rutters said how the war had undone
them / and how the king of Castyle had yuell paid them their wages /
wherefore they said they would pay themself. And surely such cities / castles
/ and good towns as were not strong in Castyle / douted them greatly. and
against them towns and cities closed their gates for fear of parels / for all
was havoc with them without it were well defended. Such knights and squyers
as came by the earl of Foyze to se him were well received / and had gifts and
rewards given them right largely. As it was showed / the coming and
retournynge of men of war / that passed by therle of Foize for the said
journey / cost him the some of.xl. thousand frankes.

THis season there fell an incydent in the town of saint Phagon in Spaygne
after the departing of the duke of Burbone / the which cost five hundred
men's lives. So it was that when sir Gaultier of Passar and sir Willyam of
Lignac entered first in to Spain / their companyes spredde abroad in to
diverse places in the country / and about the town of saint Phagon / which
was a good plentuous country. There were many of the bretons / poicteuyns /
and augenyns / of rainton and men of the low countries. And when they entered
first in to saint Phagon / they entered by six / ten / fyftene and twenty / so
that at last there were mo than five hundred of one and other / masters and
servants / and ever as they came they lodged them self / and pilled and
robbed their hosts / and brake up cofers and cupbordes / and would take what
they found. And when the citezyns saw their demeanoure / to the intent that
there should no mo enter. when these strangers were at their rest they cried
alarm in the town / and the spanyardes were ready for the same all the day
before. And so they entered in to the lodginges where the strangers were / and
as they were found they were slain without pytie or mercy / and happy were
they that were saved. the same night there were slain mo thanne five hundred.
The next morning these tydinges came to the capytayns that were coming to the
same town ward. than they drew them together to take counsel / And the
capitayns determined that it was no time than to be revenged. for if they did
/ they should find all other towns and cities against them / whereof their
enemies would/be right joyous / but they said that when their voyage should
have an end / yt in their retourning they would thank them according to
their deserts. So they passed forward and spoke nothing thereof / but they
thought the more.

Now than so it happend that when every man returned / except such as were
still abydinge with the constable sir Olyuer of Clysson / and specially those
of ye low countries / when they came together they said each to other. Now
let us pay for our welcome that we had at saint Phagon? Let us quyte them
at our departing. To this they were all agreed / and so gathered together to the
so^me of a thousand fighting men / and they aproched saint Phagon / and
entered in to the town (without any mystruste that they of the city had to
them / for they trusted all things had been forgoten) The strangers cried
alarm in a hundred places / and cried slay the villayns of the town / and
take all that they have / for they have well deserved it. Thanne these bretons
and other entered in to the howses where they thought to win most / and brake
up cofers / and slew the me^ down in every place. They slew the same day mo
than four hundred / and the town robbed and spoiled / and more than half
burnt / which was great damage. Thus these rutters were revenged for the
death of their companyons / and than they departed fro saint Phagon.

How the king of Castle and his counsel were yuell content with sir
Willyam of Lignac and sir Gaultier of Passackes company / and how the duke of
Lancastre departed fro saint Jacques to Bayon. Cap. C.ix.
Tidings came to the king of Castyle how these companyons had robbed and
pylled the good town of saint Phagon / and slain the cytezyns to the nobre of
a four hundred / and nigh brent the town. And it was said that if the
english men had won it with assaute / they would not have daulte so cruelly
as they did. The same time the two knights were present with the king / and
they were greatly reproved by the king and his counsel. They excused them and
said: as god might be their helps they knew nothing thereof. but they said /
they had herd how they were not content with them of that town / because
when they entered first in to the realm and came to saint Phagon / there were
certain of their company slain / which grudge by lyklyhode they have borne
ever sithe in their hertes. It behooved the king of Castyle to let this matter
pass / for it would have cost him over much to have had it amended. But he
bare not so good will to the capytayns after / as he did before / and that was
well seen. for when they departed and took leave of the king to return in to
France / if he had been pleased with them / it ought to be supposed they should
have been better paid of their wages than they were. For the duke of Burbone
that came last and was first that departed / he and his company had all the
chere / and well rewarded. Thus these people issued out of Castyle by diverse
ways / some by Bisquay and some by Aragon. Such as were noble and honest
knights and squyers / and lived well and kept good rule / they departed pore
and yuell horsed. and such as were hardy and adventured to rob and pylle /
they were well horsed and well furnisshed with gold and silver / and their
males full of baggage. Thus it falls in such adventures / some wyn and some
lose. The king of Castyle was joyful when he saw he was clean delivered of
such people.

Now let us somewhat speak of the duke of Lancastre / who lay sick in his bed
in the town of saint James / and the duches his wife with him and his daughter
Katheryn. It is to be thought that the duke day and night was not without
anoyau^ce / for he saw his busynes in a hard part / and many of his good
knights deed / such as he with much pain had brought with him out of
England. Nor there was none that would treat for any composicyon to be had
between him and the king of Castyle / nor that he would take the duches his
wife for enheritour of Castle / nor give her any part there of. But he herd
his men say / that they were enfourmed by pilgrims that came to saint Jacques
/ out of Flaunders / Brabant / Heynaulte / and other countries / as they came
through the realm of Spaygne: They herd the men of war say to them. Sirs
ye shall go to saint Jacques and there ye shall find the duke of Lancaster /
who keeps his chamber for fear of ye light of the son. Reco^maunde us to
him and demand of him in our behalf if we have made him fair war / or
that he be content with us or not. The Englisshmen were wont to say that we
could better dau^ce than make war. But now is ye time come that they rest
and sing / and we keep the feldes / and our fronters / in such wise that we
lose nothing nor take any damage. Such tales were told to the duke and he
took all in worth for he had none other remedy. And as soon as he might ride
he departed / and ye duches and his daughter fro saint Jacques / For the king of
Portugale had sent for him by the earl of Noware his constable with a five
hundred spears / and with him sir John^ Ferant the Ponase of Congue / Ageas
Coylle / Venase Martyn de Malo / Galope Ferrant / sir Aulde Perre / I can
Nedighes de Fay / Gannes de Falues / all barons. Thus they departed fro
Compostella / and so rode till they came to the city of Port. There the king
and the queen of Portugale made them good chere. And anon after the king and
the queen deperted and went to Conymbres / a days journey fro thens / and the
duke tarried there a.ii. months. In the mean season he ordained for all his
business and had galyes of the king / and they were apparelled / and had
with him the master patron of Portungale / named Alphons Brecart. And when
they saw good time to take the sea / ye duke and all his entered in to their
vessels / and disacred and took the sea / and were within a day and a half
of Bayon which was more than threscore and. (...) leages of. And there the
duke took la^dynge and found not there sir Johan Hollande nor the other
English men / for they were departed and gone to Burdeux / and there took
shippyng and so in to England. The duke tarried at Bayon a long space / and
lived there of the revenues of Bayon and Burdeux and of the land of
Acquitayne / of all that was under the obeysaunce of king Richard of England
/ for he had commissyon suffycient to receive the profytes of all those lands
/ and was called duke and governor of them. Now let us leave to speak a
season of the duke of Lancastre and of ye Englysshmen / and let us treat of
other matters.

How the earl of Armynake took great pain to treat with the co^panyons / to
depart out of the realm of France. Cap. C.x.
IN this reason the earl of Armynake was in Auuergne / and was intreatyng of
the companyons such as lay in fortresses in garyson. In Auuergne / Quersy /
and Lymosen. This earl had great desire to cause these capitayns to depart
out of the realm of France / and to leave such holds as they were in / for
these lands were sore oppressed by them and greatly impouerisshed. And so he
was in co^munycacion with them all / except Geffray Teate Noyre / who held
Wenchadore against the earl of Armynake. These said capitayns should receive at
one payment / two hundred and.l. thousand fra^kes. And to pay this so^me the
said lands were bound / for they were glad to be delivered of these people /
for otherwise they could not labor the earth / nor occupy their feate of
marchaundise / nor do any thing for fear of these pyllers / without they were
patesed by them. And ye charge of their patesyng drew well yearly to the so^me
that they should pay to have them delivered. And though these countries had
war with the Englysshmen yet there were among them but few of the nacyon of
England: But there were Gascoyns / bretons / almayns / foyzons / and men of
diverse countries / who were gathered toguyder to do yuell deeds. And when the
co^posycions of the redemption was made and agreed: they excepted Geffray Teate
noyre and his forterers / for he would do nothing for them. Than the earl of
Armynake prayed the earl Dolphyn of Auuergne / who was a great captain / that
he should treat with ye said Geffray / and that he would do so much to go in
to France to the king and his counsel / the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyn /
who as than had the gouernyng of ye realm to have their counsel and
assystence. For without their advise and agreement / they durst reyse up no
tail in the country. The Earl Dolphyn of Auuergne at the request of the earl
of Armynake took his journey to Paris as than the king was not there / he was
at Roane. Thither rode the earl / and there showed all the matter to the king
and his counsel / but he was not shortly dispatched / for they douted the
treaty of these people / and said Sir earl Dolphyn / we know well that the
earl of Armynake and you would right gladlye the honor and profit of the
realm / for your parts lies therein. ye have fair lands there / But we
doubt greatly / that when these capitayns gascoyns / bernoyes / and other be
paid such somes of money as the composicyon requires / whereby the country
should be enpouerisshed / yt than within three or four months after they
should return again and make worse war than they did before / and enter
again in to these fortresses. than the earl of Dolphyn answered and said. sirs
it is our ententes / the tail cessed and gadered / that the money shall not
pass out of Cleremonde or Ryon / till we be certifyed and in surety of these
people. Well quod the dukes we are content that the money be leuyed and put in
sure keeping in some place in the same country / for at the leest it shall serve
to make them war / if they will not come to some amyable treaty. And that
the earl of Armynake and you / the bishop of Cleremonde and the bisshoppe of
Puy / take ye the charge of this matter / and do so as it may be for your honor
/ and profit to the country. With right a good will sir quod the earl / and so
deperted fro the king and his uncles fro Roane / and found the earl of
Armynake his brother at Cleremont in Auuergne / with many lords of the country
taryenge there upon his coming. and there he showed word for word that he
had with the french king and his uncles / and the doutes that were made in ye
matter: And how it was their ententes that the tail should be gadered / and
the money there of gadered toguyder and put in surety in some certain place
/ till the very entente of these pyllers might be known / who keeps castles
and garrisons against the realm. the same is our entencion quod the earl of
Armynake / and sith it pleases the king and his counsel we shall go
further in the matter: but for the more surety it must behoue us to have a good
and a sure truse with the^ for all the country / till the tail be cessed and
gadered. Than there were ambassadors assigned by the earl of Armynake to go
and speak with Perot le Bernoys and Amergot Marcell. These two were as
souerayns of the fortress that they held on that side the river of Durdone /
and also to speak with the Borge of Compaigne / with Bernarde of ye Isles /
with Olyuer Barbe abton / with Seghewe the lord of Laenplayre / and diverse
other. All these capitayns acorded not together / for that the one would ye
other would not. I shall show you the reason why.

THey were of diverse opinyons and of diverse countries. They of Armynake / such
as were under the obeysaunce of the Earl of Armynake were soon agreed / but
all the other would not be ruled by him. for the chief company of them and
such as were most renomed to use great robbery and pillery were of Bierne /
and of the county of Foiz. Howbeit I say not but that the earl of Foiz would
the honor of the realm of France. But when he herd first how the earl of
Armynake did treat with them / for such fortresses as they held in Auuergne
/ in Quercy / and in Lymosyn: as he that desired to know the hole substance
of the matter. Demanded of them that enfourmed him thereof / what the earl of
Armynake was minded to do with ye men that were in the garysons / when they
were departed out of their holds / and whyder he would set the^ in any
business or not. Than he was answered / and it was said to him. Sir / the earl
of Armynake would keep them in wages and occupy them in to Lombardy: for as ye
know well his suster is married there / and before she had Gascone your son^e /
for it is thought there shall be much a do in Lombardy. whereunto the earl of
Foiz gave none answer but fell in to other talkyng / howbe it he thought
nevertheless (as it apered af^) for he handled the matter covertly. I shall
show you how.

The earl of Armynake for any treaty that he could do to them that were of the
country of Bierne / or of the teneurs of therle of Foiz or such as owed him
any favor / could never cause any of them to agree to depart out of their
garrisons. Nor would not go another to the earl of Armynake nor to Bernarde his
brother in law. For therle of Foiz who was full of great prudence / consydred
that these two lords of Armynake and there cosyns / and with the labriciens
were puissaunt men. and saw how they gate them friends on every part / he
thought they should not be renforsed / with them that ought to serve him. And
one thing that was reasonable the Earl of Foiz ymagined. sir Espaygne de Leon
showed it me when I was at Ortays / and in likewise so did the earl of Compane
/ captain of Carlot in Auuergne: and also so did the Bourge of England.
They said how the earl of Foiz regarded how he had had open war with them
of Armynake / though it were peace between them (as than) which was but a
truese / the which was diverse times renewed between them. Therefore he thought
that if the earl of Armynake had all those companyons under his governance /
his wars should be the fayrer. So that the armynakes and the labricience with
their alyes / might do him a great displeasure.

This was the cause that such as owed favor to therle of Foiz / would not
agte to the earl of Armynake. How be it they made the^ believe that they would
/ but they did but dissemble / for they brake all their apoyntme^tes. how be
it they rode not abroad so much as they did before / Whereby always the Earl
of Armynake thought to have come to his purpose. They that agreed to him were
Perotte de Bernoys / who held the strong castle of Salucette / which is
chief and soueraygne of all Auuergne and Lymosyne / for their patesyng endured
to Rochell. And also Guyllyam of saint Foye / who held the castle of
Bonteuyll / and also Margote Marcell / who held Loysse before saint Flour in
Auuergne / and the Bourge of Compaygne and the English Bourge / who held
Carlotte. Margote Marcell said he was content / so that he might have in
likewise Perotte / Bernoys / and Geffray Teate Noyre / who held Va^dachore /
who was sovereign above all other. But he did but mock and dissemble the
matter / for he disdayned to fall to any treaty of the earl of Armynakes / or
of any other. For he thought his castle imprignable and well provided for
seuyn or eight years / for he had a passage or two that could not be taken fro
him / but that he might issue when he list / to refresshe him self and his
company. This Geffray wrote him self in his saueconductes. Geffray Teate Noyre
duke of Vandachore / earl of Lymosyn / lord and soueraygne of all the
capitayns of Auuergne / Rouergue / and Lymosyn.

NOw let us leave to speak of these matters of far countries / till we have
cause to return thereto again: And now I will speak of matters nerer home /
as of mine own nacyon (as it has been showed here before) when I treated of
the end of the war of Flaunders / and of the charter of peace that the duke
of Burgoyne / and the duchess did give and grant / and sealed to them of
Gaunt / in the good town and noble city of Tourney. Therefore now to enforce
our matter and history / we will speak now of the wars of Guerles and of
Brabant. And I am quickened so to do / because that the French king and the
duke of Burgoyne (to whom the matter greatly touched / by the insydentes that
gendred thereby) were feign to set to their hands to the same war / and to
come to the bottom thereof: And to continue at length the true history and
matter / I say thus as follows.

How the earl Reynolde of Guerles / who had laid all his lands in guage and
wist not what to do / ca^e for refuge to the archebysshoppe of Coleygne his
Uncle / who blamed him. and how ambassadors went to Berthaulte of Malygnes.
Cap. C.xi.
ALonge season it was that they of Guerles and they of Brabant had great
hatered toguyder / and so did the countries to them adioyninge / by reason of
certain bonds one against another. And the most hatered that the brabanders
had to the duke of Guerles and to his heirs / was for the town of Grave /
which the dukes of Guerles had holden per force a long season against the
brabansoys. For they said / because yt the town of grane stood on that side of
the river of Muese toward Brabant / that the duke of Guerles held it
wrongfully. and before yt time diverse co^munycacions had been and poyntmentes
taken / howbeit always the guerloys stacke in their hertes. Also ye guerloys
hated the braba^soys / because of three fair castles yt were on that side the
river / as Gaulech / Buthe / and Nulle. Which castelles the duke of Braba^t
held also peforce: And by reasone (as in redynge I shall begin at the duke
of Guerles) These hatereddes were often times renewed between them of Guerles
and Brabant. And it was supposed by diverse knights and squyers that knew of
their deeds of arms / that if sir Edward of Guerles who was slain by a
marvelous incydent at the battle of Iulyers / by ye shote of an archer that
was with the duke Vyncelant of Boem duke of Lusenbourge or of Brabante / If he
had lived (with that that his men had had the vyctorie) he had come to his
entente in gettyng again the three castelles. for he was lo valiant a man and
so hardy / that he would have conquered them again. Now I will declare (as I
have promised) how and in what manner these foresaid castelles came in to the
signorie of the brabansoys / and first I will begin with the dukes of Guerles.

IN the time when I wrote and ordained this history / there was an Earl of
Guerles / called Raynolde / and because that Guerles is no rich country / nor
so great as the duchy of Brabant. This earl came to his land a young man / and
had a frewyll to dispende largely / and thought full little of the end that
might come after. He cared for nothing but for to accomplysshe his pleasure /
and haunted iustes and tourneys to his great cost / to get him renome. And
every year he spended four times as much as the value of the revenues of his
lands. He borrowed of the lombardes in diverse places / he was so lyberall and
outrageous: He ran so in debt / that he could not aid him self with any
thing that he had / so that his parents and friends greatly blamed him / and
specially an uncle of his by his mothers side / He came of the house of Orcle
/ and was archebysshop of Coleygne / who said to him in manner of gyueng him
counsel. My fair nephewe Raynolde / ye have so demeaned your self / that
now ye are become a poor manne / and your lands lies in pledge in diverse
places. And through all the world there is but little account made of poor
lords. Think you that such as have had these great gifts of you and
profit will render it again / as god aid me no? But when they se you in this
poor case and have no more to give them / they will fly fro your company and
mock you and your foul larges. ye shall find them no friends. Think not
though I be bishop of Coleyne / that I ought to break or mynisshe mine
estate to help you / nor to give you of the patrimony of my church? Surely I
will not do it / nor my conscience? shall never agree thereto / nor also ye pope
nor the cardynals will not suffer it: Therle of Heynalt has not behaved him
self (as ye have done) who has given Margarett his eldest daughter in marriage
to the king of Almayne Loys of Bauyers / and yet he has three other / he will
marry them all highly. if ye had well borne your self / and not have laid
your heritage to pledge / nor put out of your hands none of your castles nor
towns / ye might rytwell have fortuned to have had one of his daughters in
marriage / but in the case ye be in now / ye shall never come thereto ye have (as
now) another towns nor castles that ye may endowe any woman with all / not so
much as a poor lordshyppe. This earl of Guerles was sore abashed with the
words of the bishop his uncle / for he knew well he showed him but truth:
And than for love and kyndred he desyredde his counsel. Counsel fair
nephue quod the bishop: it is to late. ye will close fast the stable when the
Horse is lost: How be it I se in all your business but one remedy. What
remedy quod the earl? I shall show you quod the bishop.

BErthaulte of Malygnes (who is as now renomed the rychest man of silver and
gold / that is known in any place / by reason of the course of marchaundise
that he uses / both by land and by see. He occupyeth to Da^mas / to Cayre /
and to Alexa^dre. His galyes and marchau^dyse are worth an hundred thousand
floreyns) has to pledge part of your heritage. this Berthault has a fair
daughter to mary / and he has no mo children / Great and high barons of
Almaygne in those marches have desired her in marriage / for them selves and for
their sons. This I know well / and yet they could never come to their
ente^tes / for some he refused and some he thought not worthy. wherefore I would
counsel you yt ye should treat with this Berthault / desyring to have his
daughter in marriage / so yt he will redeem all your lands and pay all your
dettes / and bring again in to your hands / your towns / castelles / and
lordshippes / perteyning unto your herytaunce. And I suppose because ye be of
an high lynage and of great signorie / and have many towns cities / and
castles / between ye ryuers of Meuse and Ryne / that he will enclyne to your
request. Sir quod therle of Guerles / ye counsel me truly and I shall so do.
Than after therle of Guerles assembled togider his counsel and friends /
such as loved him best / and discovered his intent to them. and desired them
to go in his name to ye said Berthault of Malignes / and to treat honorably
with him for that matter. When these knights and clerks came to Berthalt /
sent fro the earl of Guerles / he made them good chere and made them a curtesse
answer / and said he would take aduysement. And he was rich beyond measure /
as worth a.v. or six hundred.M. florens. And desired the aduau^cement of his
daughter / Thinking that he wist not where to mary her more highly / tha^ to
therle of Guerles (thought to accept this marriage) but or he fullye assented
thereto in himself / he had diverse ymaginacions / and cast many doutes and said
to himself. if I mary my daughter to this Earl / and he have children by her
and than she happen to dye / as all things fall daily. than he that shall be
made rich with my goods / and put again in to possessyon of his towns and
castelles / Hap to mary again secondly in to some high blood / and have
children again by her Those children than coming out of noble lynage by
their mothers side / shall be more made of than ye children issued of my
daughter. yea? And moreover like to be dysenheryted. Wherefore without this be
artycled I will never consent thereto. How be it I will answer these messanges
that their coming pleases me greatly / and that my daughter should be happy
if she might come to so great a perfection / as to be conjoined in marriage to
the earl of Guerles / though it should cost me right derely / so that ye
matters were clear. But as now / every man knows well they be not clear / but
in sore trouble. And also he has forfayted all his heritage between the ryuers
of Muese and Ryne. Wherefore to be quyte of this / every man may se clearly /
he demands my daughter in marriage. and if I give her to him / I will know
how it shall be. And also / if case that my daughter have son or dough^ by
him / I will know if they shall be heirs of Guerles or no / for any other
marriage that the earl may hap to have after. And of this alyau^ce I will have
good surety of him and of them that be next of his blood / and of such as
have any right to demand any succession in the country of Guerles / and also
promise of the noble men and good towns of the country. Thus Berthaulte of
Malygnes determined him self to make answer to therle of Guerlrs
co^myssyoners.

THe next day at an hour assigned the earls messanges came to Berthaldes
lodging / and there he showed well that he was a rich man. Berthault met
them in his hall / and swetely recyued the^ and spoke to them merilye / and
than led them in to a fair chamber apparelled and dressed / and it had
benfor a king / and had there about him some of his friends. And when they were
all there assembled and the door closed: Than Berthaulte desired them to show
the cause of their coming / whereupon he would make them a fynall answer /
and so they did. And the deane of Coleygne a right sage Clerk and cosyn to the
earl of Guerles spoke / and there showed theffecte of their ambassade / in
such wise / that it was joy to here him. Of his words nor of his requests I
need not to speak any more / for they have been showed here before / and touched
at length. Than Berthaulte answered as he had devised in him self the day
before / and said. Fair lords I repute my self greatly honored and my dough^
also / if we might come to so high an en^prise as the earl of Guerles desires.
And when a matter is begone / it would not be prolo^ged. I say this because that
alyaunce by marriage made between the high prince and redouted lord the earl
of Guerles / and Mary my daughter pleases me rightwell. ye make me request
that his lands (which at this present time / are so sore charged and laid
to pledge / in the hands of certain lombardes and other / by reason of this
marriage should be quyt / and that I should rydde him out of debt / And all
things that are now dark / I should make them clear. I thank god of his
puissau^ce that it lies in me thus to do / and I am in good will so to do. But
first or this covenant be fully agreed / written or sealed / that I may be in
surety without trouble or debate / that ye children coming of my daughter may
be enherytours to the Erldome of Guerles / as the lymites thereof do stretche.
and that if my lord therle of Guerles fortune to dye before my daughter /
without issue between them / that than my daughter may enjoy the heritage of
Guerles during her life / and af^ her dyscease / to return to ye rightful
heir. And also I say / if my daughter have heir or heirs by my lord therle
/ and than she fortune to dye / though the earl than remacy again the second
time / and have issue by the second wife / yet for all that my daughters heir
or heirs shall not be disheryted. how be it if it please the earl to remary
again / I am content that he make his second wife a dower of all such
lands as he has beyond the river of Muse / marchyng to the bysshoprike of
Liege / and to the duchy of Brabant / and not to charge the princypall signorie
of Guerles. And thus if the earls friends and parents / and such as be next
of blood / and have any challenge to the signory of Guerles with the good towns
of the country / will seal to uphold these deuyses and couenau^tes / than I
am content and will assent to this marriage. ye may now answer to this if ye
have any charge so to do. Than the knights answered when they had a little
counsayled toguyder. Than one for them all said / sir we have well herd your
answer / but we have none auctorite to confyrme nor to grant so farforthe as
ye demand / But we shall return to our lord therle and to his counsel
and show him your answer and demand / and shortly ye shall here fro him
again. Than Berthalte said. sirs / as god will so be it. Thus they deperted
out of the chamber.

How the earl Raynolde of Guerles was married to Mary daughter to Berthault of
Malignes / by who^ he had a daughter / and after married again in England /
and had issue two sons and a daughter / and how sir John^ of Bloyes wedded
theldest daughter of the earl of Guerles. and how after the cou^tie of Guerles
remained with therle of Guerles youngest daughter. Cap. C.xii.
YE have well herd all the answers and demaundes between the foresaid parties
/ wherefore I speak no more thereof. But (as ye have herd) when therle of
guerles messangers were returned home again / The earl was hoote in the matter /
for he saw well he could as than do no better / tha^ to mary Berthalt of
Malygnes daughter / he was so rich a man. Than the earl and his counsel made
and devised writings sufficient and therle set to his seal / and his next
fre^des and pare^tes / in likewise so did other knights of Guerles and good
towns. And when all was confyrmed and done as Berthaulte was content / ye
marriage was made / and the earls dettes paid / and his Lands clearly quytte
out of danger. Than the Earl took new counsel / and began a new life and
state / if he were called good before he was named better after / for than he
had well wherewith. he lacked nothing of that Berthault of Malygnes might aid
him. The earl bare him to his wife right honorably / for she was a fair lady
good / sage / devout / and prudent: but they were not toguyder past a four
years / but that the lady dyed / And she had a daughter called Isabell. when
therle of guerles was a wydower he was but young. Than he married again right
highly / For king Edward of England / father to the good king Edward who
beseged Tourney and wanne Ealis / he gave to this earl Raynolde a daughter of
his named Isabell / and by her this earl had three children / two sons and one
daughter / sir Raynolde and sir Edward / and Jane / who afterward was duches
of Guerlers. For in likewise as Bertram of Malignes had ymagined in the
beginning / when his daughter married the earl of Guerles / even so it fell /
for there was no truth kept to him. For when king Edward of England / who
was uncle to the earl of Guerles children / came first in to Almayne to the
Emperor Loyes of Bauyers / which Emperor instytuted king Edward to be his
vycar general / through all the marches of the Empire / as it is contained in
the beginning of this book. Than the cou^tie of Guerles was made a duchy / and
the county of Iulyers was made marquis of Iulyers to augment their dignities.
And to come to our matter / the duke Raynolde of Guerles / nephue to king
Edward dyed without issue / and sir Edward of Guerles was married in Heynault /
and had to wife the youngest daughter of duke Aubert / but the lady was so young
/ that this sir Edward never touched her carnallye. And so this sir Edward
also dyed without issue / who was a right valiant knight. He was slain in
the battle yt was between the duke of Brabant and duke Wincelant before
Iulyers. His suster Jane who was married to duke Guylliam of Iulyers had
children. And she by succession of her brethren said and took upon her to be
heir to the duchy of Guerles / and in likewise so did her eldest suster by
the first marriage / For the two brethren by the second marriage were both
deed / without laufull issue. Wherefore she said / she was enherytoure. Thus
fell the difference between the two susters / and some of the country would
have the one and some the other. And the eldest suster was counsayled to mary
in to some high lygnage / that might aid her challenge and defend her
heritage. Than there was treaty made by the bishop of Coloygne that was
than: to the lord sir Johan of Bloyes / For therle Loyes his brother as than
lived. and the bishop said / that he should thereby be duke of Guerles / For
by succession of the two brethren deed without issue male / Therefore by right
of marriage / ye right should return to her / for none other could challenge any
right but she. And sir Johan of Bloyes who always had been nourisshed and
brought up in the parties of Hollande and zelande (for there he had fair
heritage / and had the language of that country. And he never had will to mary
in France) laid his ear glad lie to this treaty / and saw well he might
thereby have great possessions in the marches / that he loved best. And also
the knights of Hollande that were of his counsel / counsayled him thereto. So
he accepted that marriage / but first or he would conclude / he said he would
ride in to Heynault and Quesnoy to speak with his cosyn the duke Auberte / to
se what counsel he would give him. But to say truth / duke Aubert wist not
what to counsel him. And if he did / he made no semblaunt thereof / but
dissymuled the matter a little / So that sir John^ of Bloyes would no lengar
tarry to have his counsel / But took his horse and returned as soon as he
could in to Guerles / and wedded this lady / and did put her in possession of
the country. But some there were that would not receive him to their lord /
nor her to their lady: For the most part of the knights and squiers and good
towns of the country / held with the duchess of Iulyers / for that lady
had fair children / wherefore they of Guerles loved her the better.

THus sir John^ of Bloys had his wife and possessions / which cost him much
after: For the earl Loys his brother dyed And than he was earl of Bloyes and
lord Dauenes in Heynault / and had all the lands in Hollande and zelande /
and had in the said cou^ties great heritage. and always his counsel
counsayled him to pursue for his right that he ought to have by his wife in
Guerles / and so he did to his power. But the almayns are so covetous / they
would make no war for him no lengar than his money endured. and the challenge
yt he made to the duchy of Guerles did him never profit / but great damage.
Than dyed this gentle knight sir Johan of Bloyes / in the castle and town of
Eslone Houe / the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred fourscore and
one / in ye month of June / and was buried in the freres at Valencenes /
beside sir Johan of Heynault his. And than was his brother sir Guy of Bloyes
earl / and held all the lands by right succession yt his two brethren had
held / as well in France / Picardy / Heynalt Hollande / and zelande / as in
the county of Bloyes.

I Know not how many years after the lady dyed / who had been wife to therle
John^ of Bloys / her suster the duches of Iuliers abode pesably duches of
guerles It was ordained by thaccorde of the country / and at the request of the
knights and good towns of the duchy of Guerles / yt they should take to their
lord sir Willm^ of Iuliers / eldest son to the duke of Iuliers / for the land
came to him rightfully by succession of his uncles. and by reason thereof / duke
Aubert and ye duches his wife gave him there daughter in marriage / who before
had been married to sir Edward of Guerles. Thus the lady was daughter of Heynault
and duches of Guerles. and when she married the duke of Guerles / son to the
duke of Iulyers they were both of one age / wherefore the marriage was the more
agreeable. This young duke of Guerles held him in his own country / and
thelder he waxed / the more he loved deeds of arms / as iustes and tourneys.
and always the duke was rather English than tre^che / and that he showed
well as long as he lived: And always he bare in his mind / the yuell will
that his predecessors had to the duchy of Brabant. and always he sought
occasion how he might make war there for two reasons. the one because he was
alyed by faith and homage to king Richard of England: the other was because
Wyncelant of Boesme duke of Luse^burge and of Brabant / had bought of therle of
Mors a great lord in Almayne / the three foresaid castelles / the which I
shall name again to quicken the matter / Gaulech / Buch and Nulle / on the
othersyde of the river of Muse in the land of Falquemount: which castles
aunciently perteyned to ye duke of guerles and was enherytour to the^. And
therefore the yo^g duke Willm^ of Iuliers duke of guerles was sore displeased /
that he might not recover his heritage. as long as duke Wyncelant of Braba^t
lived he spoke no word thereof. Now shall I show you how it fortuned / to
thentent the matter should be ye clerer to be understood.

How these castelles of Gaulech / B^th / and Null came to the duke of Brabant
/ and how the duke of Iuliers sustained the linfars in his country / Who
robbed all manner of people. And of the great assemble that the duke of Brabant
made to go to Iulyers / and how he was disco^fyted. Cap. C.xiii.
SO it was that duke Reynolde of Guerles / cosyn germayne to the prince of
Guerles / and his brother had before that enguaged the threfor said castles for
a so^me of florens / to an high baron of Almayn called therle of Mors. This
earl held these castles a season / and when he saw yt he could not get his
money that he had lend on them. He was sore displeased and sent suffycient so^
monynge to the duke Raynolde of Guerles. The duke made no compte thereof / for
he had not wherewith to redeem them again. and the earl of Mors saw that he
came to ye duke of Brabant / and treated with him to have again his money for
the said castelles. The duke herd him well / because the castles marched on
the land of Faulquemou^t / of the which land he was lord / for ye duke was
glad to encrese his enheritau^ce / as he that thought well to over live ye lady
Jane duches of Brabant his wife / and so he gate i^ to his possession ye said
three castelles. And in the first he set the lord of Kalle / to be as chief
sovereign. and when this duke of Guerles was deed / than sir Edward of Guerles
took on him the heritage and sent to ye duke of Brabant ambassadors / desyring
him that he might have again the three castelles / for the money that was paid
for the^. The duke would make no such bargayne / but denied it. With which
answer sir Edward of Guerles was not content / and dalte hardely with the
wydowe the lady Isabell of Brabant / younger suster to the duches / which lady
had wedded the duke Raynolde of Guerles. but thus he troubled her for her
dowry. The lady went in to Brabant and complained her to the duke of Brabant
her brother and to the duchess / how that sir Edward of Guerles did her
great wrong and injury. And because there was a grudge between the Brabansoys
and the guerloys / for the land and town of Grance / which was in Brabant on
that side the river of Muese Therefore the duke and the brabansoys were more
enclyned to aid the lady. and on a day there were assembled together at the
calling of the duke of Brabant a great no^bre of men of war / a.xii. hundred
spears. And sir Edward of Guerles made his assemble on the other part / and
were in that case that it was likely to have had a battle between them. But
the duke Aubert / the duke of Mours / and the duke of Iullyers met together by
a treaty / and so this assemble departed a sondre with out any thing doing. The
same year ye duke Wyncelant of Brabant ouerthrewe the companyons in the
country of Lusenburge / who had greatly wasted that land / and put many to
exyle: and in the tower of the castle of Lusenburge dyed their sovereign
captain called the little Meslyn. And also in ye same year sir Charles of
Boesme / who as than reigned and was king of Almaygne and emperor of Rome /
instytuted duke Wyncela^t of Boesme and made him sovereign regarder / by an
instytucion and ordinance called in Almayne / Le langue fride / that is to say
/ holding the covert and sure ways. So that all manner of people might go and
come / and ride fro town to town surely and in sauegarde. And the Emperor
gave him a great part of the land and country of Dauffay / on both sides
the river of Ryne / to defend him therein against the lynfars / who were a
manner of people right peryllous / and great robbers without pytie. And also the
Emperor gave him the souerayntie of the good and rich city of Straubourcke /
and made him Marquis of the holy Empire / to augment thereby his estate. And
surely he could not give him to much / for this Duke Wyncelant was lyberall /
sweet / courtesse / amyable / and noble in arms: and was likely to atchyue
many things if he had lived long / but he dyed in the flower of his youth.
Whereof I that have written this history make great complaynt for him / that he
lived no lengar / but till he was a.xxiiii. year of age. Thescisme that was in
the church greatly displeased him / and that he showed me often times for I
was prive of his acquayntau^ce. in that in my days I traueyled a great part
of the world / two great princes I knew and non more humble nor tretable than
they were (that was this noble prince one / and the other my good master the
lord Guy of Bloys / who commanded me to make this history) These two princes
were in my days / and wereful of humilyte / larges / and bounty: without any
malice. They lived lyberally of their own / without oppressynge their people /
or reysing up of any yuell customs in their lands. Now let us return to
the pythe of the matter / that I have begone.

When ye duke of Iulyers and sir Edward of Guerles / who called themself
brethren / and their hertes good Englisshe / for they had been long alyed with
ye king of England / and with love and favor had always aided them in their
wars. When they saw that the duke of Brabant had so high a signory / as to
be lord and sovereign regarder by the Emperonr / and was chief correctour of
all mysdoers and robbers / that he found lyueng by the high ways of
Almaygne. They had thereat indygnacion and envy / not for that he did well and
held justice / and corrected yuell doers: but of that he had the sovereign
regard and signory over la^gue fride / which was part in their land which
office was first instytued yt marchautes might pesably pass fro Brabant to
Heynault / to Flaunders / to France / or fro Liege to Coleyne / and to other
cities / towns and fortresses of Almayne. And another merchants nor other
could not pass nor enter in to Almayne / by the lands and dangers of the
duke of Iulyers and ye duke of Guerles. And so it was / that certain robbers
were in the ways of Linfars. And it were they that had done the vyolence and
passing through the lands of the duke of Iuliers. It was showed me that the
duke had lent them horse and castles. Great complayntes came to duke Wyncelant
of Brabant and of Luzenbourge / who as than was at Bruselles / how that the
Languefryde whereof he was sovereign regarder and keeper / was broken and
violated. and how they that did that vyolence / and robbed the country /
soiourned and ever returned in to the duchy of Iulyers. The duke of Brabante
(who as than was young and lusty / and puyssaunte of lynage and of lands) took
in great dispyte the offenses that his people had complained of / and said how
he would find some remedy / seeing he had in charge to keep and defend the
Languefride. He would not that through his neclygence he should take any
reproach or blame. and to conclude his deed and to set reason in their
demand / and by the counsel and advise that he had / he sent to the duke
of Iulyers notable persons / as the lord of Vrquon lord of Bourguenall / sir
Scelar archedecon of Heynalt / Geffrey de la tower / great rowter of Brabante /
and other. showing to him in wise and sweet manner the offense / which greatly
touches and is preiudyciall to the duke of Brabante / who is keeper and
sovereign regarder of the Languefride. The duke of Iulyers fayntely excused him
self / for by that he showed he had as lefe have had the war as the peace /
so that the duke of Brabantes messangers were not well content: and so took
their leave of the duke of Iuliers / and reiourned and showed the duke of
Brabant all as they had herd and seen. When the duke herd that / he demanded
what was best to do. He was answered by his counsel saying. sir / ye know
best your self. Well quod the duke / and I say yt it is my entensyon that I
will not sleep so in this blame / nor that it shall be said that for sloth or
faynte heart / that I should suffer under my sauegarde robbers to do vilaynes
and robories unpunished. I show and will show to my cosyn of Iuliers and to
his aids / that this matter touches me nere. This duke cooled not his intent /
but in contynent set clerks a warke / and sent to them that he thought would
aid him. Some he prayed / and some he commanded / and sent sufficyent
knoledge of his mind to the duke of Iuliers and to his alies. both these
lords made great preparacion. The duke of Iulyers had but little aid / but of
his brother sir Edward of Guerles / he greatly comforted him with men and with
friends. These two lords sent privily for men far in to Almayne. And because
that almayns are covetous / desyring to win / and it had been long before or
they were in any place / where they might get any good adventure. They would
have come in more habundaunce and they had not known that they should have had
to do against the duke of Brabante. The duke of Brabante in great array
departed fro Bruselles / and went to Louayne / and fro thence to Treete on the
river of Muese / and there he found a thousand spears abydinge for him / and
always there came men to him fro all parties / fro France / fro Flanders /
fro Haynalt / fro Namure / fro Lorayne and other countries / so that he had two
thousand and five hundred spears of good men of war. and also there came to
him out of Burgoyne the lord of Grant / and with him a four hundred spears
/ but they came to late / for they knew not the day of the business that I
shall show you / wherewith they were sore dyspleased / when they herd that
the matter was done without them. The duke of Brabant being at Trect / herd
but little news of his enemies. Than he departed fro Trect the wednysdaye /
and went and lodged in the land of his enemies / and there lay all that night
/ and the thursday till he herd certain tidings. It was showed him by his
corours that his enemies were abroad. Than he rode forward / and commanded to
burn in the duke of Iuliers land/and the thursday took his lodginge betymes.
And the vowarde kept the earl Guy of Ligney / earl of saint Pole and sir
Valeran his son / who as than was but young / of a sixtene year of age / and
there he was made knight. The duke of Iuliers came the same thursday / and lay
nere one to another. and by all lyklyhode ye almaynes knew the demeanor of
the brabansoys / better than they did theirs / for on the fridaye betymes when
the duke of Brabant had herd mass / and that all were in the field and thought
not to have fought so soon. Than came ready the duke of Iuliers and sir Edward
of Guerles well mounted with a great battle. Than one said to the duke of
Brabante. sir / behold yo^der your enemies put your helmes on your heedes / in
the name of god and saint George. Of that word the duke had great joy. The
same day he had by him four squiers of great price / worthy to serve an high
prince and to be about him / for they had seen many deeds of arms. they were
called Johan de Valcon / Baudwyn of Beauforde / Gyrarde of Byes / and Roulande
of Colongne. About the duke were the bruselloys / some a horseback with their
varlettes behind them / with botelles of wine trussed at their sadelles / and
pastyes of samonde / troutes / and elys wraped in towels. These horsemen
greatly combred the place / so that there was such prease that no man could
stir. Than Gyrarde of Bi^^ said to ye duke / si^ command these horses to a
void the place they shall greatly let us / we can not se about us nor have
knoledge of your reregarde / nor vowarde / nor of your marshall sir Roberte of
Namure. So let it be quod the duke / I command so. Than Gyrarde took his
glayue in his hands and so did his companyons / and began to stryke on their
helmes and on their horses / so that a none the place was voyded of them / for
no man was glad to have his horse slain or hurt. Than the duke of Iuliers and
pro Edward of Guerles and their company came on them / and found the earl of
saint Poule and his son in the vowarde / and dasshed in so fersely among
them / that anon they were broken and discomfited / and there were many slain
/ taken / and hurt. that was the battle that had most to do. There was
slain Guy the earl of saint Poule / and sir Valeran his son taken. The
battle turned to a herd part for the duke of Brabante / and for them that
were with him. for of men of honor there were but a few saved / but outher
they were slain or taken / The duke of Brabante was taken / and sir Roberte of
Namure / and sir Loys of Namure his brother / and sir Willyam of Namure son
to the earl of Namure / and many other. Also on the duke of Iulyers part there
were some slain and hurt. but ye know well it is a general rule / the great
loss ever rests on them that be disconfyted. how be it for all the damage
the duke of Brabante had in that journey / yet they had one great point of
remedy and comfort / for sir Edward of Guerles was wounded to death. And this
I say because it was the opinyon of diverse / that if he had lived he would
have rydden so forward / that with puyssau^ce he would have come to Bruselles
and conquered all the cou^treye / for none would have resysted him. He was
hardy and fierce / and hated the brabansoys / because of the three castles that
they held against him. This journey and victory had the duke of Iulyers in ye
year of our lord god / a thousand three hundred and a leven / on saint
Bartylmewes even / on a fridaye.

THe duches of Brabant purchased her friends / and had counsel of Charles the
french king / who was nephue to the duke of Braba^t an all his brethren / for
they were children of his suster. she was counsayled by the king to go to the
king of Almayne emperor / brother to the duke of Brabante / for whose sake
the duke her husband had taken all that damage. The lady did so and came to
Conualence on the river of the Ryne / and there found the Emperor / And
there wisely she made her complaynte. The emperor herd her well / the which
he was bound unto by diverse reasons. The one because the duke was his brother
/ and another because he had institude him to be his vycare / and sovereign
regarder of the Languefryde. he comforted the lady and said / that at the next
so^mer he would find some remedy. The lady returned into Brabante well
comforted. And the emperor sir Charles of Boesme slept not his busynes / but
waked the matter / as ye shall here. For as soon as winter was past he aproched
to the noble city of Coloyne / and there made his prouysion / in such wise as
though he would go to conquer a realm of defense / and wrote to his dukes and
earls that held of him / and commanded them at the third day of June they
should be with him at Ayes / with fyfty horse a piece / on pain of lesyng of
their lands. and specially he commanded three / as duke Auberte earl of
Haynalte / that he should come to Ayes with fyfty horse / and so he did. When
these lords were come / there was much people. And than sir Charles his son
said that he would go and enter in to ye lands of duke Iulyers and destroy it
/ because of the great outrage that he had done / as in enteryng in to the
field with an army against the emperors vycaire his brother. this sentence was
given by plain judgment in the emperors chamber. Than to that matter regarded
the archebysshoppe of Treues / the archbysshoppe of Coloyne / the byssop of
Marauce / the bishop of Liege / the duke Aubert of Bauier / the duke Oste
his brother / and diverse other barons of Almayne (that thought) to dystroy the
lands of so valiant a knight as was the duke of Iulyers / should be yuell
done / and also he was nere of their kynne. They said it were better first to
send for him / that he might come to obeysaunce. That apoyntment was holden
for the best / for the love of both parties. Than duke Auberte and his brother
came to Iuliers / and found there the duke / who was abashed / and wyste not
what counsel to believe / for it had been showed him that the assemble that the
emperor had made was to come on him / without his friends did stop it. When
these lords were come to the duke he was gladd / specially by the coming of
his two cosyns germayns / the duke Aubert of Bauiers and the duke Oste his
brother / for he knew well that they would not his dyshonoure / but rather to
give him good counsel / as they did. Their counsel was to show you breuely
/ that he should send some honorable persons for the duke of Lusenburge and
of Brabant / whom he held in curtoyse prison in his castle of Nideque / and
so he did. And when he was come all those lords did him great honor / as
reason was. And than they all departed together / and came to Ayes and took
their lodgings. Than the duke Auberte and his brother / and the foresaid
prelates / who were the means of this treatye. they sore entreated the
emperor and his counsel / and showed the emperor how ye duke of Iuliers
his cosyn / of his own free will was come to se him / and to put him self
poorly with out any reseruacyon / into his obeysaunce and commandment / and
to knowledge him for his soueraygne and liege lord. These sweet and amyable
words molefyed greatly the emperors ire that he had before. Than the
emperor said. Let the duke come to me? and so he did / and kneled down
before the emperor and said. My right redoubted sovereign / I believe well ye
are dyspleased with me / because of your brother in law the duke of Brabante /
whom I have held long in prison / for the which cause I submytte my self to
abide your order and your counsayles. To that word the emperor gave none
answer / but his son sir Charles / who was called king of Boesme /
answered and said. Duke of Iulyers / ye have been to outragyous to keep our
uncle so long in prisone. And if it were not at the desire of your well be
loved cosyns / duke Auberte and duke Oste of Bauyers / this business would
have been soer laid to your charge than it is / for ye have well deserved to be
hyghly punysshed. but change your copye so that we have no cause to renew our
yuell wylles against you / for and ye do it will be costly to you. Than the
duke of Iulyers being on his kne before the emperor (where as he sat in his
chair imperial) said. My right redoughted sovereign lord / by your
puyssaunt hyghnes / I knowledge my self to have trespassed your majesty / in
that I with an army came against my cosyn your vycaire of the empire / and in
that I have held him as my prisoner / I deliver him unto you freely and quyte
/ and I require your grace that you nor he bear me any yuell will fro hence
forth. Than the prelates and the princes there being present / to help
forward his words said. Right noble prince this suffyseth that your cosyn of
Iulyers has said. Well quod the emperor / we are content / and so took him up
by the hand. And as it was showed me for the confyrmacion of more love / he
kyst the duke on the mouth and also his son the king of Boesme. And than the
duke of Brabante was delivered out of prison / and all such as were prisoners
under the duke of Iulyers / and were not raunsomed before / were delivered
quyte / by reason of the composycion of the treaty. and this done every manne
returned to their own. The emperor went to Prage in Almayne / and the duke
of Brabant in to Brabante / and when the duke of Brabante was returned /
than he raised a new tail in his country to restore to his knights part of
their domages.

How the duke of Brabante dyed / and how the duke Guylliam of Guerles treated
with the duches of Brabante / to have again the three castles / and what
answer he had / and how he made alyau^ce with the king of England. Cap.
C.xiiii.
I Am yet willing to treat of this matter more at length / to renforce this
hystorye / and to bring it to the point that I would come unto. and to
declare the truth / why Charles the french king came with a great puyssaunce
in to Almayne. I might have showed this before but I have prolonged it (for all
things though the date and season be paste yet they ought to be showed in this
hystory) for when I know that the french king and the king of England began
to be besy / than I began to wake to proceed this hystory / more than I did
before. Therefore I say thus. When duke Wyncelant was returned in to the
country / and clearly delivered out of person (as ye have herd before) Than
he was in will to vysyte his lands and castles / as well in the duchy of
Luzenbourge / as else where. and took his journey to the good city of
Strawesbourge / through the land of Fauquemount and beheld ye three castles
which were the occasion of the duke of Guerles yuell will. He found them
strong and fair / if he loved the^ before / he loved them much better than:
and caused them to be newly fortyfied / and set workmen a work / as masons /
carpe^ters / and dykemakers / to amend every place. and at his departing he
set a valiant knight to be soueraygne keeper of these three casteles. This
knight was called sir Johan Grosset / who at the dukes commandment took on
him the charge / at his parell. The duke passed further and vysited his
country / and at his pleasure returned again in to Brabante / for there was
his abiding. In this season sir Johan of Blo^s had wedded the old lady and
duches of Guerles / for the heritage by right came to him / by the death of sir
Edward of Guerles his brother / who was slain (as ye have herd / in the
battle of Iulyers) But his suster the duches of Iulyers strove with him and
made challenge / and the most part of the knights and good towns inclyned
most to the ladies part / because she had a fair son / who was able than to
ride. and that was well seen / for always he was in the wars / so that sir
John^ de Bloyse nor his wife could never have peasable possessyon. But the
challenge of the right of his wife and the pursuit thereof / cost him above a
hundred thousa^de frankes. For the son of duke Wyllyam of Iuliers showed well
in his youth that he was noble and hardy / and loved deeds of arms / for he
came of noble ertractyon. and so was duke of Guerles / and had in marriage the
eldest daughter of duke Auberte / who had been wedded before to sir Edward of
Guerles / but he had never carnally coupyled with her / for she was to young.
Thus she was married to the lord Willyam of Iulyers / and he and she were much
of one age. And so she was still duches / as she was before. This young duke
increased in honor / wit / and prowes / and in great will to hau^te deeds of
arms / and to augment his heritage. And his he^e was rather english than
french / and said always (as young as he was) that he would aid to insteyne
the king of Englandes quarrel for he was nerer of blood to him than to the
French king. It was showed him diverse times how the brabansoys did him great
wrong / to keep fro him the three castles. Than he answered and said. Let us
suffer a senson / every thing must have his turn? It is no season as yet for
me to awake / for our cosyn of Brabante has many great friends / and he is a
sage knight / but a time may come yt I shall a wake. Thus the matter stood a
season / till god took out of this life duke Wyncelante / who dyed duke of
Boesme / duke of Lusenbourge / and of Brabante / as it has been contained
before in this hystory. By the death of this duke the duches of Brabant lost
much. Than the young duke of Guerles / who was right valiant / and lykely to
dysplease his enemies / and thought than to get and recover again his three
castelles / because of the debate that was and had been between Brabante and his
uncle the lord Edward of Guerles. Than he sent to treat with the duches of
Brabant / to deliver his castelles / for the sum of money that they lay in
pledge for / always affyrmynge how they lay but in guage. The lady answered
the messangers how she was in possessyon of them / and held them as her own
right and enherytaunce. But because she would the duke should be a good
neighbor to Brabaunte / that he should leave and give up the town of Grave /
the which he held in the duchy of Brabant. When ye duke of Guerles had herd
this answer / he was nothing well content: and thought great dispyte
thereof. And thought and ymagined many things / and covertly he treated with
the knight / called sir Johan of Grosselotte / chief captain of the said
castelles / to assaye if he could get them of him / by byeng for money / or
otherwise. The knight who was true and sage / would in no wise harken thereto.
And sent to the duke / desyringe him to speak no more thereof: For to dye
therefore there should never faut be found in him nor that he would consent to
do any trayson to his natural lady. And when the duke of Guerles saw that (as
I was enfourmed) he did so much to sir Raynolde of Dyscouorte / that he took
for a small occasyon a displeasure against the knight: So that on a day he was
met with all in the feldes / and there slain / wherewith the duchess of
Brabante was sore displeased and so was all the country / and the castelles
were put in other keeping / by the agreement of the duches and of the
counsel of Brabant.

THus the matters stood certain years / and ever there norisshed covert hate /
what for the town of Grave on the one part / and for the three castelles on
the other part: Between the duke of Guerles and the duches of Brabant / and
their countries. and they of the fronter of Guerles bare always yuell will
couerlly against them of Brabant such as marched nere to them: and did ever to
them as much dyspleasure as they could do / and specially such as were in the
town of Grave. And between the dukes wood and the town of Grave / there was
but four leages and a plain country / and fair feldes to ride in. And they
of Guerles did always there as great dispyte to the brabansoys / as they
might. And the matter went so forward / that ye duke of Guerles passed the sea
/ and went in to England to sekyng Richard his cosyn / and his other cosins:
as the duke of Lancastre / the duke of york / ye duke of Glocestre / and other
great barons of England. He had there good chere for they desired to se him /
and to have his acquayntaunce for the English men knew well that this dukes
heart / courage / ymaginacion / and affection / was rather English than
French. In this vyage he made great alyaunce with the king of England / and
because at that time he held nothing of the king of England / whereby he
should bear him faith / homage / or service. Therefore king Richard gave him
in pencyon out of his coffers / a thousand mark by year: And was counsayled
to assaye to get his right fro the duches of Brabant / and was promised to
have aid of the English men / in such wise / that he should take no damage.
And by this means he swear to be true and faithful to the king / and to the
realm of England. And when this alyaunce was made / he took his leave of the
king and of his cosyns / and other barons of England / And returned in to
his own country of Guerles: and showed the duke of Iulyers all that he had
done / and how he should have aid and help of the English men. And the
duke of Iulyers / who by experyence of his age knew farther than the duke his
son did / made no countynaunce of no great joy: but said. Son Wyllyam /
ye have done so much / that both you and I may fortune to repent your going
in to England. Do ye not know how puyssaunt the duke of Burgoyne is? no duke
more myghtie than he: And he looks for the heritage of Brabant. How may ye
resyst against so puyssau^t a lord? How may I resyst quod the duke of Guerles
to ye duke of Iulyers his father? The rychee and myghtier that he is / the
better it is to make war against him. I had rather to have a do with a
rich man that has great possessions and heritage / than with him that has
nothing to lose / for there is nothing to be conquered. For one Buffet that I
shall receive I will give sire. And also the king of Almayne is alyed with the
king of England. If need be I shall have aid of him. Well quod the duke of
Iuliers. Wylliam my fair son / I fear me ye will play the fool / your
wysshes and enterprises are more like to be vnacomplysshed than atchyued.

I shall show you why the duke of Iulyers spoke somewhat against the will of
his son the duke of Guerles / and made dout in his enterprise. King Charles
of France last discessed before this season yt I speak of he did as much as
he could always to get him friends on all parts / for it stood him in
hand so to do / and for all that he could not do so much as to make
resyste^ce against his enemies. How be it he did as much as he could by
gifts and fair promyses / to sytte in rest and to have aid / so that he gate
him self many friends / in the Empire and other places. So that when the duke
of Iulyers was quyte delivered out of prisone / and was come to the duke of
Brabant. The king and he were great friends toguyder / and by the ordinance
the Emperor of Rome did set. The duke of Iulyers went to Paris to se the
king / and there he was nobly received / and great gifts given to him and to
his knights. And than he made relefe to the king for the signorie of Vyerson
/ which parteyned to the cou^tie of Bloys which land lay between Bloys and
Berrey / and was worth by year a five hundred pound of money / curraunt in
France. And there the duke of Iulyers swear yt he should never bear armure
against the Crown of France. And so as long as the king lived he kept his
oath: For surely as long as king Charles lived he did him no manner of damage /
nor consented to none to be done to the crown of France. But when king
Charles was deed / and that Charles his son was king. By reason of the
wars of Flaunders (as it has been showed before in this history) And after
he took his Creacyon at Paris / He had so much to do that he could not take heed in every place. The duof Iulyers than came not in to France / nor made no
relyefe for the lands of Viersone. Wherefore the duke of Berrey who took him
self as soueraygne / said. How the relefes parteyned to him: And so ceased
the lands and took ye profytes thereof / and by puyssau^ce put out fro his
right the Earl of Bloyes: How be it the same time I saw them both oftentimes
together / and never debate made between them for any of the said lands / nor
any yuell will showed. There was good cause for them to be friends toguyder /
for Loyes son to the earl of Bloyes had in marriage the lady Mary daughter to
the duke of Berrey. The duke of Iuliers would gladlye have entered in to his
heritage / but he regarded his son / who should be his heir. Therefore he
made but little count of the alyaunce that his son the duke of Guerles had
made in England. And by this reason he spoke the words (that ye have herd
here before) to the duke of Guerles / when he was returned out of England.
How be it the duke of Guerles who was young and coragyous / took little
regard to his fathers words / and said. Sir / that I have done I will
uphold: for I had rather have warr^ with the French king than peace / and
rather with him than with a poor man.

How the duchess of Brabante sent messangers to the French king complaynyng
of the duke of Guerles / And how the king and his counsel were sore busyed
with insydentes that fell in the realm of France / as well for the defyances
of Guerles as the business in Bretaygne. Capi. C.xv.
THe duchess of Brabant being at Bruselles / was well informed of all these
troubles: And how the duke of Guerles thretned them of Brabante to make them
war: The duchess feared the same and said. Ah / god assoyle the soul of my
lord and husband / for if he had lived / the Duke of Guerles durst not have
spoken of any such matters. But now because I am a woman and aged he will
make war against me. Than the lady called toguyder her counsel to know
what she were best to do / for she knew well the duke was hot / hasty / and
coragyous.

THe same seasone while this lady was taking of counsel with her friends /
the French king was defied by the duke of Guerles / whereof ran a great
brute through all the Realm / and in other realms thereto adioynyng. They had
marueyle of these news / Because the duke of Guerles was but a small prince /
to the regard of other / and but of small lands. Men spoke thereof in diverse
manners / every man after his own opynion: Than^e the duchess counsel said.
Madame / ye have need of counsel: And we shall counsel you to send to the
French king / and to the duke of Burgoyne be times: For ye have herd how
the duke of Guerles has defied the French king / and all his alyes. If he
be in purpose to make war to the realm of France / as the brute ronneth
that he will / because the Englysshemen and the almaygnes are of his alyaunce:
He can have no better enter in to the realm of France than through your
country. Wherefore it is good that the king and the duke of Burgoyne be
aduertysed thereof: And that your castles on the fronters be well fortifyed and
garnysshed. For there is not so small an enemy / but he is to be doubted. We
say not that ye should have great need to seek for any aid or confore all
only for them of Guerles / but it is good to regard the alyaunces / that he
may lightlye get / as well of English men as of almaygnes / who always
are covetous / and desires to make war to the realm of France on trust of
wynnyng. Than the duchess said to her counsel. sirs ye say truth / it
shall be as ye have devised. Than such as should go on that message were
appointed out: As the lord of Bourguenall chief Steward of her house / sir
Johan Opeyn a gracyous knight / a clerk and a squire of honor. The clerk
called sir Johan Grane / and the squire Nycholas de la Monoy. All four were of
the preuy counsel with the duchess of Brabant. They departed fro Bruselles
with letters of crede^ce and rode to Paris. At that time another the king nor
the duke of Burgoyne was natte there / they were at Rohane in Normandye. Than
they went fro Paris to Roane where the king was.

When these ambassadoures came to Rohane / first they treated with the duke of
Burgoyne and he made the^ good chere / for he knew them well / they delivered
letters to him / and he received and reed them. Than wha^ time was he brought
them to the king / who for love of their lady received the^ louyngly. Than the
king reed their letters and herd them speak / and answered and said. Sirs /
your words and requests demands counsel. Resort always to our uncle of
Burgoyne and he shall here you / and dispatche your business (as shortly as
may be) Those words contented greatly these ambassadors / and so went to
their lodgings. The king and his uncles with other of his counsel / were
daily toguyder in counsel for diverse causes and insydentes new fallen. The
defyance of the duke of Guerles was nothing pleasant to them / nor also they
knew not what the duke of Bretayne was purposed to do / because he had taken
the constable of France prisoner / and set him to rau^some to a.C.M. frankes /
and had taken fro him three castelles and a good town: and had greatly
fortifyed with men / vitayls / and artyllary / all his garysons and towns /
and had sent diverse times letters and messangers in to England to the king and
to his uncles: As for the duke of Lancastre was at that time in Galyce. The
counsel of France had much a do to provide for every business / whereby it
was the lengar or ye duches of Brabantes ambassade had their answer. Finally
ye duke of Burgoyn made the^ an answer and said. sirs / ye shall return to
your lady our aunte and salute her fro us / and deliver her these the kings
letters and ours. and show her yt her business is ours / and let her not be
abashed for any thing / for she shall be comforted in such wise / that she
shall well perceive that her country of Brabant shall take no damage nor
reproach. This fair answer contented greatly the ambassadors of Brabant. Thus
they departed and returned to Paris and fro the^s to Brusels / and made
relacion of their answer (as ye have herd before) wherewith the duches was
well content.

THe same season news were sprede abroad of holy saint Peter of Lusenbourge
cardynall / whose body did miracles in the city of Auygnon.

This holy cardynall was son to the Earl Guye of sant Poule / who dyed in the
battle of Iulyers. This holy Cardynall in his time was a good man / noble /
holy / and devout of life / and did many deeds pleasant to god. He was sweet
/ courtesse / meke / and a maid of body: A great alms man in gyaynge to
poor people. He kept nothing to him self of the goods of the Church / but
his bare lyueng: The most part of the day and of the night he was in his
prayers / always he fled fro the vanyties and superfluyties of the world /
so that in his young days god called him to his company: And anon after his
discesse he did great miracles / and ordained to be buried among the poor
people: All his days he used humylyte / and was buried in the chapel of saint
Mychaell. The Pope and the cardynalles when they saw the miracles that his
body did daily increase and multiplye: They wrote to the French king / and
specially to his brother the Earl Valeranne of saint Poule: desyringe him to
come to Auygnon. The Earl would not excuse him but went thither / and there
gave goodlye Lamps of silver to hang before his altar / and had great
marueyle of the great believe and visytacion that the people made there daily*
and for to se him I went thither fro the county of Foize / and daily his
works increased (and it was said) that he should be canonised. I can not tell
what fell after.

Now yt I have showed you of his death / I shall show you of the death of
another / for I have not spoken of the death of a king of whom great mencyon
has been made of in this history: How be it the did many deeds unreasonable
/ for by him and his means / the realm of France had much to do in his
time. This was by the king of Nauer.

How by a strange fortune the king of Nauer dyed in the city of Pampilona /
and how Charles his son was crowned: and how Va^chadore was beseged by the
duke of Berrey: and how the duke of Burgoyne sent to the duchess of Brabant.
Capi. C.xvi.
IT is said: and it is of truth / that there is nothing more certain than
death. I say it because yt king of Nauer when he dyed / thought full little
that he had been so nere to his end as he was. If he had known thereof /
paraduenture he would have taken better head than he did. He was in the city
of Pa^pylona in Nauerre / He ymagined how he would reyse a great taylage in
his realm / to the so^me of two hundred thousand florens / and he sent for
his counsel and said / how he would have this money raised. His counsel
durst not say nay / for he was a cruel prince. Than the most notable
persons of other cities and towns in his realm were sent for / to come to
Panpylona. They came thither / for they durst not disobey. When they were come
all together in to the kings palace / the king him self declared forth the
matter why they were sent for. He was a king right subtyle / sage / and well
langaged / and at the conclusion said / how toward his needs he must have
the so^me of.CC.M. florens / to be raised of his subjects / After this manner.
the rich to pay.x. frankes / the mean to be cessed at five frankes / and all
other at one frank. This request abashed greatly the people / for the year
before there had been a battle in Nauer / by reason whereof a tail was raised
to the sum of hundred thousand floreyns: And beside that he married his
daughter the lady Jane to duke Johan of Bretaygne / and a great part of that
money as tha^ not paid and vngadered. When the king had made his demand /
he desired to have an answer: Than they required to take counsel and to
speak toguyder. The king gave them respite.xv. days. than the chief of them to
make answer. The brute of this taylage spredde abroad through Nauerre / and
every man was a basshed thereof. At the.xv. days end / the most notable
persons of the good cities and towns returned to Panpilona / to the nombre of
a threscore persons / who had charge to answer for all the hole realm. The
king was present at their answer making / which was done in a fair garden /
far of fro any people / and closed about with high walls. Than they
answered all with one accord / and showed the pouerte of the realm / and
alleged how the former tail was not as than all leuyed nor gadred / wherefore
they besought him for goddessake to have pytie of them / for they said surely
the realm was not able to bear it. and when the king saw that he could not
easily attain to his purpose / he was sore dyspleased / and departed fro them
and said. Sirs / ye are yuell counsayled / take counsel again / and speak
yet again together. And so he went in to his chamber / and his counsel with
him. Than all these good persons were together in this garden fast closed in
with high walls / and the king commanded in no wise to suffer them to issue
out / and to have but little meat nor drink. Than they were there in great
doubt of their lives / and there was none that durst speak for them. and so it
was supposed that by constreynt he had his desire / for he struck of a three of
their heedes / such as were most contrary to his entente to ^ give fear and
ensample to other. Than there fell a strange insydence by a marvelous sudden
adventure / the which god sent like a miracle. I shall show you how / as I
was enfourmed in the county of Foize at Ortays at the earls house / by men of
Panpylona / it past not a three or four days journey thence. It was showed me
how this king of Nauer in his days loved well women / and at the same time
he had a fair damsel to his lover / for he was a wydower a long season. On
a night he lay with her a space / and than returned to his chamber in a fever
/ and said to his servants. Dress my bed / for I will rest me a season /
and so went to his bed / and trymbled for cold / and could take no heat. He
was an aged man about a threscore year of age / and of usage his bed was
wont to be chased with a basin with hot coals / to make him sweet / which
often times he used / and did him no hurt. At this time his servants did the
same / but outher as god would or the devil / a burning flame took in the
shetes / in such manner that or he could be reskewed he was burnt to the
bowels / he was so wrapped between the shetes. So that he lived fyftene days
after in great pain and mysery / inso much that physyke nor surgery could
help him / but that he dyed. This was the end of the king of Nauerre. And so
the poor men of the country were quyte of their taylage / and delivered fro
payenge there of to Charles his son / who was a noble good knight and a young
/ and was king of Nauerre / and crowned king the same seasone that I wrote
this hystory / anon after the obsequy done of his father / in the city of
Paupylona.

yE have well herd here before of the treatyes that had been made in the
counties of Armynake and dolphenty / in Auuergne and Lymozyn / who were enemies
to all their neighbors. Many of them were well content to depart / for they
thought they had warred and traveled the realm of France long enough /
thinking than to goo and rob and pyll in other places. The duke of Armynake
promised them to lead them in to Lumbardy / But the earl of Foyze who would
not lightly be dysceyued thought the contrary. He held him self still to se
the end of that business / and ever dylygentely inquired / how the treatyes
went forward in those parties / and when these men of war should depart /
and whyder they should draw. And the men of his country said / that the
renome was / how they would go and rynne a bowfe a robbynge and pyllynge.
Thanne the Earl cast down his heed and said. Always news rynne among of
war. The earl of Armynake and Bernarde his brother are young / and I know
well they love me not nor my country. These men of war may hap by his
means to rynne on me and my country / how be it I will provide there fore in
such wise / that I trust I shall take no damage. It is said / long prouysion
before makes sure possessyon. Thus the earl of Foyze said to his counsel /
and it was no folysshe imagynacyon / as it apered after / if I may atteygne to
the tretynge thereof.

yE have herd here before rehearsed / how Geffrey Tete noyr breton / who had
long kept the garyson of the strong castle of Vandachor in Lymozyn / on the
fronter of Auuergne and Burbonoys / would in no wise depart out of ye castle
/ for he held it as his own propre enherytaunce / and had patysed all the
country there about / and under their patesyng the people labored in pease
and rest. Thus this Geffrey kept the estate of a great lord. He was a
cruel man in his dyspleasure / he had no more pytye to slay a man than a
be. Now to come to purpose. when the tydinges spread abroad in Auuergne and
Lymozyn / of the tail that was gathered in the countries / to the entente to a
void out of the country these men of war. Than it was brewted that the men
of war in the fortress of Vandachor should depart / and to give up the
fortress to the duke of Berrey. By reason of that tidings the people were
content to pay this tail. But when they saw the contrary (for the most hurt
that they had / was by them of the garyson of Vandachor) thought the money that
they had paid at the first gatherynge but lost / and said how they would
pay no more cross nor mayle / without they of Vandachor were constreyned to
depart out of the country. These tidings came to the he^yng of the duke of
Berrey / who had all the soueraygne charge of the country of Auuerge / Lymozyn
/ and Gelnadan. Than the duke and his counsel said. Surely these poor men
have good cause to say so / and to be loathe to pay their money for nothing /
and more over said / how he him self and his counsel were to blame / that
they laid not a siege about that fortress / to keep them of that garyson fro
issuyng out. Thanne the duke of Berrey ordained at the cost and charge of the
country four hundred spears of good men of arms / to besiege Vandachor by
bastydes. And sovereign capytaynes of that company was sir Willyam of Lygnac
and sir Johan Boesme lance / a valiant knight of Burbonoyse. These men of
arms and knights / as nere as they might laid siege to Vandochor / and made
ba^tydes in four places / and by men of the country they made great trenches
and defense upon the straytes, to stop their issuinge out. But the capytayne
Geffrey set little thereby / for he knew well his garrison was well furnysshed
with all manner of things / though there came no new vytayle to them in seven
year. Also the castle stood in so strong a place upon a rock / that it could
take no damage for any assawte. And for all this siege and bastydes / they
within would often times issue out by a preuy posterne / which opened between
two rocks / so that they would issue out under couerte / and ride abrod in the
country / and took prisoners. Other thing they would bring none to their
fortress / they could not because of the strayte ways / and strong
mountains that they must pass by. And this issue could not be stopped fro
them for the aley under covert endured fro their garyson a seven or eight
leages / or they came out in to the feldes / and when they returned again /
by that time they were entered a three leages / they were as sure there as
within their castle. This manner they used a long season. The siege lay more
than a year before the castle. Now let us leave speaking of Vandachor till a
another season / and speak of other new matters.

THe duke of Burgoyne forgate not the promise that he had made to his aunte the
duches of Brabante. He ordained a four hundred men of arms / burgonyons and
other / and made two knights capytayns / the one sir Guylliam of Tremoyle
burgonyon / the other sir Geruays of Merande almayne. And the duke said to
them. sirs / ye shall go to your charge on the fronters of Brabant and Guerles
/ there as the duches of Brabante will apoynt you and make to her enemies as
good war as ye can. The knights said they should do their best / to
fulfill his commandment. They made them ready and gadred their men / and
went forth as soon as they might / and drew in to Brabante / and sent
word of their coming to the duches of Brabante / and so passed through the
land of Lusenburge. And than by the ordinance of the marshall of Brabant /
they were sent in to the three castles that the duke of Guerles chale^ged and
would have again / because they had been laid but to pledge. that is to say /
Buth / Gaulyth / and Nulle. There they held them in garyson and made good
fronter war / and sometime rode abroad to encountre their enemies. The duke of
Guerles fortefyed him self against them / and furnysshed his towns and
castles against them / for he saw well the war was as than open. So it
fortuned that sir Willyam of Tremoyle / desyringe to auaunce him self to do
some thing that might sownde to his honor. He set his imagyncion on a day on
a town in Guerles / a four leages fro his fortress. this town was called
Seaulle / and he showed secretly his entensyon to sir Geruays of Merande his
companyon / who lightly accorded to his mind. So they gathered their company
together and departed about mydnyght / and rode a round pase too this town /
and had guydes that brought them to Seaule / by that time it was daylight. Than
they rested them and appointed what they would do. And as it was showed me / sir
Geruays with.xxx. spears / went on before for to wyn^e the gate / and sir
Willyam of Tremoyle to follow after / because they feared if they should have
rydden all together to have been spyed. but they thought how they of the town
should think none other / but that they should be a certain nombre of men of
arms / sent thither by the duke of Guerles to refresshe the garyson. Thus this
knight sir Geruays with.xxx. spears rode before to the town of Seaulle. In
the morning they found men and women going to the town / for it was
markette day / they saluted them in the langage of Almayne and rode forth.
The poor men went surely they had been men of the country perteynynge to the
duke of Guerles that were riding to the garyson. Sir Geruays and his company
rode forth till they came to the gate and found it open with a small ward /
it was so erly that the most part of the people were in their beds. They
rested there and were lords of the gate. Than incontinent sir Willyam of
Tremoyle and his route came galopynge thither as fast as they might / and
entered into the town / and cried their cries. Thus the town was won without
any defense / for the men of the town thought full little that the frenchmen
would have done such an enterprise / and ye most part of the^ were in their
beds.

How the french men after they had burnt and ryfeled the town of Seaulle
returned to their garyson / and of the joy that the duke of Burgoyne and the
duches of Brabante made for that deed / and how sir John^ Boesme lance
discomfyted the englysshmen. Cap. C.xvii.
THis enterprise was done on the night of saint Marten in winter / and a three
days before there came thither a knight of England with ten spears and.xxx.
archers / sent by the king of England. This knight was called sir Guylliam
Fykaole. When the larum began he was rysinge out of his bed. He herd that the
town was won / and demanded by whom. he was answered that it was done by
bretons. Ah quod the knight bretons are yuell people / they will burn and pyll
the town / and than depart. What cry do they cry? sir quod they / they cry
on Tremoyle. Than the english knight closed the castle / and held him self
and his company within / to se if any reskewe came. but every man was so
abashed that they fled hither and thither. The poor people fled in to ye
mynster / and some avoided ye town by another gate. the frenchmen set fire
in the town in diverse places / how be it there were many howses of stone and
brick / that ye fire could not lighty burn them. The most part of the
town was brent pylled / and robbed / so that nothing was left that was good /
and the rychest men of the town taken prisoners. The english knight was
taken at last / For when he saw that all was lost he opened the house that he
was in / for he douted the fire / when he saw the flames and smoke in every
corner of ye town / and so came out with his penon before him and his company
archers and other / and there valiauntly defended them selfs a long season.
But finally he was taken and yelden prisoner to sir Guylliam of Tremoyle / and
all his company taken / but few slain. When the frenchemen had done their
wylles with the town of Seaulle in Guerles / and their varlettes driving their
pyllage before them they departed for they thought it folly too a bide there /
and went to their garrison fro whence as they came. Thus the duke of Guerles had
the first buffet and damage / wherewith he was sore dyspleased when he knew
thereof. and so came thither with a great nombre of men of war / and thought
well to have found there the french men / but they were gone. Than he new
renpayred the town and furnished it with new men of war / who were more
dilyge^t to keep the town / thanne they that were there before. Thus daily the
adue^tures of war fell / some lost one day and some another. The duches of
Brabante / and all tho of her country were greatly reioysed of this adventure /
and sir Gillyam of Tremoyle / and sir Geruais of Merande atchyued great grace.
Than they of the country said / that in the next summer following they would
win it again. When the duke of Burgoyne herd these tydinges / and how that
his men yt were in garyson in Brabant did well and valyauntly / he was glad
thereof / and to incorage them he wrote pleasant letters often times to sir
Guylliam his knight. Thus they tarried there all that winter / kepinge well
their fronters / and defending them self fro damage. And after the castelles
and forteresses of Guerles / were better taken head unto than they were before.
Now shall I show you of another enterprise / that Perote of Bernois did in
Auuergne / where he gate great profit / and by what means he did it I shall
show we you at lenght.

IT fortuned the same year and season about the time of the mids of May /
a.xl. companyons adventurers issued out of Caluset / the which Perot of
Bernoys held. This fortress stood in Lymozyn. These companyons rode forth at
adventure in to Auuergne / and a Gascoyne squire was their capytayne / called
Geronet Durante / an expert man of arms. And because the country was always
in doubt of ye men of war that were on the fronters of Burbonoys / there was
a knight of the duke of Burgoynes / called sir Johan Boesme Lance / a
gracious and an amorous knight / having great courage to auaunce himself.
While these english men rode a broad / he deman^ded what nombre they were of.
And it was showed him how they were about a.xl. spears. What quod he / it is
little to regard for.xl. spears / I will set as many against them. and so
depart fro thence as he was as than / and went there as his chief charge was /
and that was before Vandachor He gate together. a.xl. or a fifty spears of
Lymozyn and Auuergne / and Burbonoyse / and with him there was a knight called
sir Loys Dambter / and also sir Loys Dabton / and the lord of saint Obyse.
And so took the feldes without keeping of any high way / they knew the country
/ and came to a passage where their enemies must needs pass / by reasone of
the mountains and ryuers which were great and deep / by occasion of the
snow falling fro the mountayns. They had not ben there half an hour / but
that thenglysshment came thither and was not ware of that rencountre. Than
Boesme lance and his company / cauched their spears and came against their
enemies and cried their cries. when the englisshment saw how they must needs
fight / they turned their faces to their enemies / and defended them self.
There was a sore rencountre / and certain over thrown on both parties. But
to say the troth the frenchmen were better expert men of arms than the
auenturers / and that seemed well / for there were none of the adventurers that
returned again without it were the varlettes / who fled and saved them self
while other did fight. There were.xxii. taken and syxtene slain on the place /
and the captain taken prisoner. and thus they departed.

How sir Johan Boesme launceled these prisoners to Mou^te Ferant and how they
of the country were glad when they herd of this enterprise / and how Generot
and his company were set to ransom and delivered by the money that Perot of
Bitrne lent him. Cap. C.xviii.
IN rydyng and ledynge these prisoners / Boesme lauce aduysed and remembered
himself how that a month before he had been in the town of Mount ferante in
Auuergne / sportyng among the ladies and damsels there / and how they had
desired him at a time / saying. Fair brother Boesme lance / ye ride often
times abroad in to the feldes. may it not so fortune yt at sometime ye might
rencounter your enemies? I shall show you why quod one of the damsels (such
one as was in great favor with Boesme lance) Sir quod she / I would feign se
an englysshman? asquyer of this country called Gurdines / has showed me
often times how the englysshmen are expert men of arms / the which seems
right well to betrewe / for they ride often times abroad / and do many propre
deades of arms / and takes diverse of our castles / and keeps them. At
which time this ge^tleman Boesme lance answered her and said. Dame / if ever
it be my fortune to take any / ye shall se him. Sir I thank you quod the
damsel. Thus after the foresaid enterprise / when this promise came in to
his mind / he forsook than the way to Cleremonte / which was not far of /
and turned to the way to Mountferant / not far thence. Of his coming to
Mountferant and of the journey yt he had atchyued against the adventurers (who
sore troubled the country) all the people of Mou^tferant were right joyful /
and made him good chere. Than he took his lodging and unarmed him / the ladies
and damsels came to make him chere / and received him right swetly / he was a
sage knight. Than he thanked them / and said to her that had desired him
before to se some englysse man. Dame / I will acquyte me to you I made you
promise not past a month a go / that if it might be my fortune to take any
english man / to show him to you / and as this day god has given me ye
grace to mete with some that be right valyant / for in arms they have given us
enough to do / how be it we had the victory. They be no english men
naturally borne / they be gascoyns / and make war for the englysshmen. they
be of Byerne and high Gascoyne / ye shall se them at good leyser / for the
love of you I have brought them to this town / and he^ they shall remain till
their rau^somes be paid. The ladies and damoselles laughed at him / and
turned the matter to a great sport / and said to him. Sir / all we thank you.
And so there he tarried a three days among them / and he kept good company with
his prisoners / and put them to ransom for he saw well they were but poor
companyons adventurers / and he thought it were better to hang them / drown
them / or ransom them / rather thanne to suffer so many of them to abide
still in the town. And so when he departed thence he said to Geronet. Sir / ye
shall abide here with a certain / for all the rest of your company / and the
other shall depart and go seche your ransom / And that ye shall pay / I
shall apoynte them that shall receive it / and when the money is paid ye
shall depart. Therefore remember well now what I do for you? if any of ours
herafter hap to be in like case / do in likewise. Sir quod Geronet / I am
bound so to do / and so we be all. Thus Boesme lance departed / and returned
again to the syege of Vandachor. And a twelve of the prisoners tarried still in
Mounteferante / and the other departed and went to Galuset / to Perot of
Bernois to have of him.xxii. hundred frankes. They that tarried still at
Mou^tferant lay and made good there / and no great watch laid on them / but
they went up and down in the town at their pleasure / and so were there a
fyftene days / and in that season they learned much of the state of the town
/ the which cost after a hundred thousand frankes.

When the capytayne of Galuset was infourmed of the adventure of Gere not of
Mandurant / how that he and his company were over thrown by sir Johan Boesme
lance / he made little thereof / and said to them that came to him for the
money for their rau^somes. Syrs / ye are come for money for their delyueraunce
/ how say ye it is not so? yes truly sir quod they / we trust they shall not
be always in this loss / they have no gages. well sirs quod he / as for me I
another care for their pledges nor yet for their losses / they shall have
nothing of me. I made them not to go for the / they rode at their own
adventure / therefore ye may show them / let adventure deliver them. Think you
that I will enploye my money after that sort? nay surely. I can have always
co^panyons ynowe to ride more sagely than they did. As form I will quyte out
no man / without he be taken in my company. This was the fynall answer that
they could get for Geronet. Than they said among themself / it were best
that two or three of us return again to Geronet / and show him all the case.
So three of them returned to Mountferante / and as they rode they passed by
Cleremou^t / and saw well the walls were not of no great heyght. Than they
said one to another. this town is prignable / if we come hyder on a night we
may get it / there is no great watch kept. We must one time bargayne and
another time bye / we can not both bargayne and bye all in one day. Thus they
rode forth and rode to Mountferante / and there found Geronet and his
companyons / and there showed him all the answer that they had of Perot of
Bernoys / whereof they were a basshed / for they wyste not how nor where to
get their ransom. Thus all a day and a night they were in great
dyspleasure. the next day Geronet said to them that had brought those news.
Syrs / I require you return again to our capytayne / and show him fro me yt
I have to my power while I was with him / served him truly / and will do yet
if it be his pleasure. And show him if I turn and become French to deliver
my self / he shall wyn but little thereby. And if I do it god knows it shall
be full sore against my will / and I shall forbear it as long as I can. And
show him that if he will now deliver us fro hence / that within a month
after I shall bring him to such a botye / that he and his company shall win a
hundred thousand frankes. With that message the three companyons returned
again to Galuset / and showed Perot their message. Thanne he studied a little
and said. It may well be as he says / at adventure I shall deliver him
incontyuent. and so opened a cofer wherein was more than threscore thousand
frankes / not gathered of his rentes that he had in Byerne / but the most
part of pyllage. For the town he dwelte in be fore the wars was but of
twelve houses / and the earl of Foiz was chief lord thereof / and the town was
called Dadam / within three leages of Ortays. Than he told out.xxii. hundred
frankes / at a pynch a friend is known / I shall put them in adventure / he is
well able to win them again and mo / and he will. Thus they departed fro
Galuset and returned to Mount ferante / it was a.xiiii. great leages between /
but they had a good saueco^duct / whereby they passed in and out without danger.

When Geronet knew how he and his company should be delivered / he was right
joyful and sent for them that should receive the money and said. Syrs /
hold tell your money / here is all that we owe you. So they told out xxii.
hundred frankes. Than they rekened for their expenses in their lodgings / and
paid every thing with the largeste / so that every man was content. And when
all was paid / than Gerenot hired men and horses to bring them to Galuset.
When sir Johan Boesme lance was certifyed of the receyte of the money / I
think he did send for it / or else left it still there on trust of the
strength of the garyson. For the same season sir Peter of Gyache / as than
chancellor of France / left the^ his treasoure / the which he lost the same
year all / or most part. When Geronet was returned to Galuset / the
companyons made him good chere / and after a three or four days Perot le
Bernoys called him and said. Geronet / the promise that ye made to my
servants was cause of your delyueraunce / and nothing else / for I was not
bound to pay your ransom / seeing ye departed without my leave / ye rode
forth but at adventure / therefore now hold your promise / or else there shall
be displeasure between you and me / for I would ye know I have not learned to
lose / but rather to win. Capytayne quod Geronet / ye have reason to say as
ye do / and sir I say thus to you that if ye list I shall set you in the
town of Mount ferant within.xv. days / in the which town is great treasure
and pyllage / for it is rich of marchaundyse / and rich villaynes be therein
great plenty. the chancellor of France sir Peter of Giache / as it is
infourmed me / has great riches within the same town. And I know well it is
the town most symplest kept and lest taken head to of any town in the
realm. Sir this is that I can say / and this is the promise that I have made.
In the name of god quod Perot le Bernoys / it is well said and I consent
thereto / ye know well the manner of the town / and how it is kept and
fortifyed. This enterprise does it require any great nombre? Sir quod
Geronette / a three or four hundred spears shall well accomplysshe our feate /
for within the town there be no men of great defense. Well quod Perot I am
content / and I shall singnyfye other capytayns of the fortresses here about
of the matter / and we shall assemble to gyder and go thither.

How Geronet of Mandurante with twelve of his company returned to Mountferant
/ and how Perot of Bernoys with four hundred spears went to Mount ferant /
and would not enter in to the town by none other way but in at the gate. Cap.
C.xix.
ON this determynacion Perot sent to the capytaynes next about him / and
appointed every man to mete at Ousac / a castle in the bysshopriche of
Cleremount / not far thence. Whereof sometime Barbe a great pyller a gascoyne
was capytayne. The companyons of seven fortresses assembled together at Ousac
english men / and they were a four hundred spears well mounted / and than
they had but six leages to ride. The first that came to Ousac was Perote of
Bernoys / to show that it was his enterprise / and to take counsel with the
other capytayns / by the advise of Geronet and according to the informacyon
that he had given him. Than Geronet and a twelve other with him / arrayed them
like rude vyllayne merchants in cotes of fryse / and led horses tied one to
another with baggage on them / according to the custom of the country. And
thus they departed fro Ousac in the brekynge of the day / and so rode toward
Mountferant / and like merchants they entered into the town about noone.
There were none that took any head what men they were / they thought full
little they had been men of war. They of the town demed surely they had been
merchants / come thither to the fair to have bought cloth and dyaper / for
they said they came fro Mount Pellier / to bye marchau^dyse for against the
fair there was come thither much marchaundyse fro other cities and towns of
the realm. Than Geronet and his company went to their lodging / to the syne
of the Crown / and set up their horses and took up a fair chamber for the^
/ and kept them still therein without going about in the town for fear of
spyenge / and so sat and made merry / and thought well they would pay nothing
for their expenses.

AT night they were besy to dress their horses and said to their host and
ostes / that their horses had sore trauayled all that day / wherefore they had
need of rest. They provided them of plenty of candels / and so went in to their
chamber and drank and made merry / but they would not go to bed. So the host
and the hosts went to their beds and let them alone / and had no suspecte
of them. Now shall I show you what Perot and his company did. The said day he
and with him seven other capytayns / first Perot le Bernoys as chief / than
the Bourge of Compaygne called Arnaldon / the bourge Anglois / ye Bourge of
Carlat / Apthon Seguyn / Olyue Barbe / and Bernadon of the isles / and with
them there was a great routter of Byerne the lord of Lance plain. By him and
by the bourge of Compayne I was afterward enfourmed of this enterprise /
which was done about Candelmas / when the nights be long and cold. and all
the same night it rayned / and the wind blewe so that it was a stormy season /
wherefore the capytayne of the watch of Mountferant issued not out that night
of his lodging / but he sent his son forth who was but young / of a syxtene
year of age. And as he went fro the one gate to the other / he found four
poor men watchinge / nygh deed for cold / and they said to the young man. Sir
/ take of each of us a blanke / and let us go home and warm us / it is paste a
leven of the clock. The young man coueted the money and took it / and they
departed fro their watch / and went to their own houses. Than Geronet and
his company watched at their hosts door / to se when the watch men should
return. Than they saw when the young man came fro the watch / and the
watch men with him. Than Geronet said / the matter goes well / this is like
to be a good night for us / every manne in the town is as now gone to bed /
the watch is paste / we need to take no care for that. And on the other part
/ I am sure Perotte le Bernoys and his company are riding hyder ward as fast
as they may. And in deed ye same time they were coming and came nere to
Cleremounte / and met with Aymergotte Marcell with a hundred speres /
capytayne of the fortress of Alose beside saint Flower. when each of them
knew other they made good chere / and demanded each other whyder they would /
and what they sought in that country. Amergot answered and said / I come fro
my fortress of Alose / and ame going to Carlate. In the name of god said two
of the capytaynes / the Bourge Angloys and the Bourge Compaigne. Sir we be here
/ would ye any thing speak with us? yea quod Amerigot / ye have certain
prisoners of the country of Dolphyn of Auuergne / and ye know well we be in
treating together by the means of the earl of Armynake / wherefore we would
gladly make an exchange with certain prisoners that I have in my garyson. I
am sore desired thus to do by the cou^tes of Dolphyn / who is a right good lady
and is well worthy to be done pleasure unto. than the Bourge of Compaigne said.
Aymergotte ye are greatly bound to do some pleasure to that lady / for within
this three year ye had of her silver three hundred frankes / for the redemynge
of the castle of Mercyer. But sir / I pray you where is therle Dolphyn at this
season? Sir quod the other / it is showed me that he is in France / comunynge
upon the treaty that ye know that we be in hand with the earl of Armynake /
and with earl Dolphyn. Than Perot le Bernoys said. Sir / leave their comunynge
and come on with us / and it shall be for your profit. and ye shall have part
of our botye. Sir quod. Aymergot / and whyder go you than? By my faith sir quod
Perot / we go straight to Mount ferante / for this night the town shall be
yelden to me. than Aymerygot said. sir / this is yuell done that ye go about /
for ye know well we be in treaty with the earl of Armynake and with this
country / wherefore all towns and castles rekeneth themself half assured /
wherefore we shall be greatly blamed thus to do / and ye shall break out
treatye. By my faith quod Perot / as for me I will agree to no treatye / as
long as I may keep the feldes / it behooves companyons to live. come on your
way with us / for ye shall have nothing to do at Carlat / for here be the
companyons of that fortress / and such as be left behynd will not suffer you
to enter till their company come home. Well ser quod Aymerigot / with you will
I not go / but I will return again in to my fortress / sith the matter is
thus. Thus they de parted one fro a another. Perot held the way to Mountferant
/ and when they were under Cleremount there they rested them / and imagyned on
a new enterprise / specially certain of the gascoyns / who knew not of the
enterprise of Geronet. Than they said to the capytayns. Sirs / behold here
this city of Cleremonte / the which is a rich city / and rather more
prignable than Mount ferant / we have ladders here / let us scale it / we shall
have more profit here than at Mount ferante. To this point they were nere a
greed / but thanne the chief capytayns said. Sirs Cleremonte is a puissant
town and well peopled and the men well harnessed / if they be ones moved they
will assemble together and put them self to defense. it is no doubt but we
should have no great aduaunatage by them. And if we should be reculed perforce
and our horse taken or lost / we should yuell escape / for we be far fro
home. and if the country than should rise and pursue us / we should be in
great danger. we think it were better to go on forth and follow our first
enterprise / for the seeking of a new enterprise per adventure might cost us
dear.

THis counsel was taken / and so rode forth without making of any noise /
so that about.xi. of the clock they were nere to Mount ferant. When they saw
the town they stood still a three bow shot of fro ye town. Than Perotte said
/ behold here is Mount ferant / our company that went before are with in the
town. keep you all still here close to gyder / and I will go down this valaye
to se if I may se or here any news of Geronet / who has brought us to this
enterprise / and depart not till I come to you again. sir quod they go your
way / we shall abide you here. Therewith Perot departed and four with him. The
wether was so dark that no man could se an acre bread fro him / and also it
rayned / blewe and snewe / that it was a meruaylouse yuell wether. Geronet was
as than on the walls and tarried to here some news. He looked dowe over the
walls / and as he thought he saw the shadow of some men going a long by the
dyke side. than he began a little to why / stell softely. And wha^ they without
herd that they came nerer to the wall / for the dykes on that side had no
water. Than Geronet demanded who was there without. Perot knew his voice and
said / I am Perot le Bernoys / Geronet art thou there? yea sir quod he I am
here. Make you ready and aproche your men / for I shall let you in here in to
the town / for all tho within the town be a sleep in their beds. What quod
Perot / should we enter here where as ye stand / god keep me fro that? I will
not enter there / if I enter I will enter in at the gate / and at none other
place. No will quod Geronette / and I assure you that lies not in my power to
do. but sir bring your ladders hyder and spare not sckale / for I assure you
there is none shall let you. Well quod Perot / thou haste promised to let me
in to the town / but surely I will not enter without it be by the gate. Well
quod Geronet and I can not a mende it / for I can not let you in at the gate
/ it is fast shytte / and the kepers be within / but they be a sleep. While
they were at this strife certain of Geronettes company within went up and
down upon the walls / to se if they might here any noise. A little there by
there was a poor house at the foot of the wall / this house stood alone far
of fro any other house / and a poor man dwelte therein a taylour / who had
watched all the night till the same time / and thanne was going to bed. And
as the wind caryeth noise far of / he herd as he thought men speaking on
the walls. For by night time a man shall here far of. therewith he went out
of his house and went upon the walls / and so met with the men / and as soon
as he saw them he began to cry. Than one of them stepped forth and took him by
the throat / and said. Vyllayne thou art but deed and thou speak one word?
And so he held his peace / for he feared death. Than Geronet (who had herd
the noise) said. Sirs slay him not / for he shall do us good service / god
has sent him to us / for by him we shall furnysshe all our enterprise. Than
Geronet said to Perotte le Bernoys. sir / return to your company / and when
ye here the first gate open come forth / and with your axes break down the
gate next you / and showed him the adventure of the man that they had taken on
the walls. Thanne Perot departed and went to his company / and showed them
all the matter (as ye have herd before)

How Geronet let in Perot le Bernoys and his company in to the town of
Mountferant / whereof the country was a frayde / and how the king and his
uncles being at Paris were therewith sore dyspleased / and also the earl
Dolphyn of Auuergene. Cap. C.xx.
THan Geronet said to the man yt they had taken. Without thou fulfill our
desire thou art but deed incontynente. What would you that I should do quod
he. I will quod Geronet that thou go to the gate and a wake the porters / and
say how the capytayne would have the gate opened / or else let them deliver to
the the keys / to let in a certain merchants of Mount Pellyer / who be
without with fardelles of marchandyse to come in to the fair. Sirs quod the
man / What and they will not believe me. yes I warante the quod Geronet / tell
them by the token that he was not at the watch this last night / but sent his
son. And without thou do this message well and wisely I shall slay the with
my dagger / and do so that through thy fault I lose not mine enterprise. When
the poor man saw how he was manassed / and perceived how they were ready to
slay him / he was sore abashed / and said. Sir I shall do that ye command /
to the vttermest of my power. And so he came to the gate and knocked so long
till he a woke the porters. Than they said: What art thou that wakest us this
time of the night? I am such a one quod he / and named his name / I have been
all this night busy in making of certain gear of the capytayns / and so have
borne it home / and while I was there / word came to him how certain
merchants of Mount Pellier are without the gate with their marchandyse / and
are sore trauayled and weate with the foul wether / wherefore the captain
commaundes you by me to open the gates and let them come in / or else give me
the keys and I shall let them in / by the same token that he was not at the
watch him self this night / but sent his son. That is true quod the
porters abide a little / thou shall have the keys incontinent. Than one of
them rose and took the keys hanginge on a pyn / and opened a little wyndowe and
delivered out the keys. The man took them And than incontynente Geronet took
them / and at adventure put in the right key in to the lock and opened ye gate
/ and than went to the utter gate / but in no wise he could open it. Perot and
his company were without taryenge for opening of the gate. Than Geronet said /
sirs help your self / auaunce forth for I can in no wise open this second
gate / break it up with your axes / otherwise ye can not enter in to the town.
Than they without had ready axes and wedges and hewed ye gate like carpenters.
And as soon as they could get in a hole they put in axes and wedges to
Geronet / that he and his company should hew a sonder the bars of the gate.
Than diverse men herynge that noise arose out of their beds / and had
marvel what it might be / for they thought full little that the english men
should have raised them out of their beds / at that time of the night. Than
the kepers of the gate who had yuell kept their ward / herynge men speak and
horses braye and cry / knew well they were dysceyued / and rose and came to
the wyndowes of the gate / and began to cry with an high voice / trayson
tray^on. than all the town began to rise in great fear / and many thought to
save their goods and them self and fled to the castle / but the^ were but
a few that entered. For the Chatelyn within the castle when he understood
that the english men had won the town / for fear of lesynge of more / he
would not let down his bridges. Some of his friends that came first he let
them come in by means of a planke / And when he herd the great brewte in
the town / than he drew in a gain the planke / and after that he would no
more put it forth / but went about to se what defense he should make if the
castle were assailed. thus I have showed you how the first gate was opened /
and the second broken with axes and wedges / and than they entered fair and
easily. These capytayns and their companyons or they entered in to any house /
they rode all the streates in the town together / to se if there were any
assemble to make any defense. And when they had sertched every place / and
found no man to make any resistance / but a certain such as were gone to
have entered into the castle made a little defense / but soon they were taken
and slain. What should I make long process / Thus the town of Mount
Ferante in Auuergne was taken on a thursday at night / the thyrtenth day of
February / by Perot le Bernoys and his company? And when they saw how they
were lords of the town they took up their lodgings at their ease / without
setting of any house a fire / or doing of any other vyolence. For Perot le
Bernois had charged on pain of death no man to vyolate any manner of woman or
maiden / nor to set any house a fire / nor to take no good nor prisoner
little nor great / till he had first knowledge thereof. And also / that no man
should be so hardy to hurt any church or trouble any man of the church / nor
to take any thing out thereof. This manner ever Perot used when so ever he wanne
any town or fortress. But Geffary Tele noyre did always the contrary / for
he never cared for church nor for nothing else / so that he might have it and
get good / he cared not how.

THe same morning when tydinges of this deed came to the knowledge of them
of Cleremounte / which was but a small leage thens / they were sore abashed
and good cause why / for their enemies were nere them. They wyste not what to
say or do / but took good bid to defend their town. These news spredde a
broad to the castle Neuffe / to Thyon / to Vyc / to Issoire / to Ryon / and
fro thence to Auige Perse / and to castle of Mount Pencyer. And all these
towns and countries that I have named / the most part pertayned to the duke
of Berrey. In far countries these tidings spread a broad / how these
english men and gascoyns had won and taken the good town of Mount ferante
in Auuergne. As many as herd thereof meruayled greatly / and were in doubt /
and the countries adjoining were half a frayde / as Auuergne / Burbonoys /
Forestes / and to Berrey. When these news came to Paris the king and his
uncles were sore displeased / which was good reason / for the same time the
earl Dolphyn was at Paris for the ordering of that country / for he had the
soueraygne charge of keeping thereof / with the earl of Armynake. Therefore this
deed was greatly to their displeasure / for they thought they should bear some
blame for that deed / because it was under their rule: But their excuse was
reasonable / for it was well known how they were in treaty with all the
companions / wherefore they thought the country at that time had been in good
surety. Than incontinent the earl Dolphyn departed fro Paris to go in to
Auuergne / to set an order in the country and left all his train behind
him: And so rode but alonely with his page / and took his way by Moulyns in
Burbonoyes to go to Auuergne / and changed every day fresshe horses. And as
he rode in this haste at saint Pier the mynster he herd other tidings / yt he
had not herd before / as I shall show you.

How Perot le Bernoys and his company took their counsel and determined not
to keep the town of Mountferante: and how the said Perot and his company
deperted thens by night with all their pyllage and prisoners / and went and
refresshed the^ in the town of Ousac. Cap. C.xxi.
When it was Fridaye morning after the town was won on the thursdaye at
night (as ye have herd here before) and that these Capitayns were lords of
the town they bound fast all the men / so that they could do the^ no
dommage. Than they sertched all about and trussed in to fardelles: Clothe /
naprye / gowns / furs / and other things / such as they thought to have
any profit by. And tha^ they took counsel whether they should keep still the
town or no. Some were of the opynion to keep it still and to fortifye it: But
the most part said / that to abide there it were great follye / For so they
should be enclosed round about / and should be far of fro their socours and
fortresses / so that if they should be there besieged / they should not be able
to withstand their enemies and lykely to have no socours / so that by long
siege they should be famysshedde / for there about were many great gentylmen /
cities and good towns. And also when the duke of Berrey should know of this
enterprice / he will se^de hither the mareshall of France sir Loyes Sanxere.
And also the earl Dolphyn of Auuergne and the earl of Armynake will come or
send and besiege us / with many great lords: As the lord of the Tower / the
lord Dapthon / the lord Dapthyer / the lord of Revel / the lord de la
Palayes / and diverse other. yea / and specially hither shall come sir Johan
Boesme Lance with a great no^bre. All these doutes the sage Perot le Bernoyes
and Olyue Barbe did cast and co^iecte / and said. If they were there taken
they should lose all they have / and feign to deliver up all their fortresses.
So these capitayns concluded the same night to depart and to take with them
all their botye and prisoners / of whom they had mo than^e two hundred. Than
they set a sure guard at the gates / to thentent that none should issue out to
bewray their entreprice. Now shall I show you of a scrymysshe that they of
Cleremount made with them.

How they of the town of Cleremont made a scrimysshe with these pyllers (that
had taken and robbed the town of Mountferante) at the gates of the town. Cap.
C.xxii.
WHan^e these tidings were known at Cleremo^t that the English men had
takenne Mou^tferant / they were soore abashed / for they were nere neighbors
/ So they of Cleremont took counsel toguyder / And without the town of
Cleremounte on the way toward Mountferant. There was a church of Friars as
fair / as strong / and as well builded / as any was in the realm of France:
Whereunto parteyned a great close / enuyroned with strong high walls / and
with in the close full of Vynes: for one year with another the friars had
thereof / a sixscore vessels of wine. Than some said within the town that it
should be best to beat down the Friars / because it joined so nere to the
gate or else it might be to their destruction. Some other said nay /
affyrmynge how it should be great pytie and dommage to distroye so goodly a
house / and said. Sirs / let us go to Mount ferant / and sermyss he there
with our enemies / and let us besiege them / there they shall never escape us.
For the knights and Squyers of this country of Burbonoys and of Forestes will
draw hither: So that within these four days surely they shall be besieged.
While they were thus debatynge of the matter / there were a threscore
compaygnions made them self ready to depart out of the town / to go se their
enemies / and to serimysshe with them. There was no man did let them /
for of the best of the town were in that company / desyringe to win honor:
and took with them a.xxx. crosbowes / and so rode toward Mount feraunt.
Thanne after them issued out of Cleremounte mo than two hundred men a fore /
and followed after. Thanne horsemen rode straight to the Barryers of Mount
feraunte. Tidings came in to the town to the Capitayns / how that they of
Cleremount were come to vysette them / and were before the barryers / of which
tidings they were greatly reioysed / and a hundred armed them and mounted on
their horses / and opyned the gate and issued out on a front and cried saint
George. And when the cleremo^toys saw them coming so fiercely they were
afraid and vanquysshed within them self and began to recule without
showing of any face of defense / and so fled hither and thither: They that
were best horsed at the coming out of Cleremount and were the formast /
saying: how they would be the first that should make assaute / were than the
first that returned again to the town / and the gascoyns after them: So that
if the gascons horses had been as go as the Cleremontoys / there had but a
few of them entered again in to their town: How beit they were chased till
they met with the footmen / who in likewise than fled and kept none order
/ and lepte into the Vynes and in to the dykes to save themself. The crosbowes
that came out of Cleremount / kept better array than their company did: For
they close toguyder took a vine yard and bent their bows / and made vysage of
defense: and kept them self there till all the English men were
withdrawn back again to Mountferant. They of Cleremont lost twenty of their
men six slain and fourtene taken. Thus it fell of that enterprice / and all
that day every man trussed and made ready to depart the same night after / and
by six of the Clock every man had trussed up their baggage / and laded
their horses and set them selte a foot. They past not a threscore on
horseback / and so set forward in the streets their summers and caryages:
they had well a four hundred horse charged with clothes / naprie and furs
/ and other things necessary. They found in the town cofes and presses full
of stuff / but they lafte them clean void. They bound their prisoners two
and two toguyder: And when they were all ready and that it was night / they
opyned the gate and issued out: They had tarried in Mount feraunt no more but
eyghtene hours. They set their carriage before them / and tha^ their
prisoners and foot men / and the capitayns on horseback came after them. The
night was dark and the country not aduysed of their departing / wherefore
they were not pursued / and about mydnight they came to Ousacke / fro whens
they came the second day before: there they rested them.

It was showed me that they wanne by the same voyage a hundred thousand
frankes / beside their prisoners. Sir Peter of Gyache chauncelloure of France
lost for his part in ready money / thyrtie thousand frankes or above.

THe companyons were well counsayled to leave Mount feraunt in Auuergne so
soon as they did / For if they had tarried there two days lengar than they
did / they had not departed without great danger / and paraduenture with
loss of their lives. For all the knights and squiers of the country gathered
toguyder and came thither with puyssaunce to have laid siege to the town / and
the lords of the country (as ye have herd before named) none tarried behind.
And the earl Dolphyn was come within two days journey / but than he herd
tidings how the Englysshmen and gascoyns were departed to their own
forteresses: and there the truth of the hole matter was showed him. Whan^e he
knew the truth / he rode than more at his ease and came to saint Pursayne /
and fro thens to Moulyns in Burbonoyes: And there he found the duches of
Burbone his daughter / who was sore a frayde of that adventure / How be it
when she knew that the adventures were gone she was glad thereof / for thanne
she thought her country more surer than it was before. By my faith quod the
earl I would it had cost me greatly / that they had tarried still at Mount
Ferant till I had come thither: For if they were there now they should have an
yuell end. We could not have had a better enterprise in all Auuergne / whereby
to have recovered all the fortresses that they hold. It seems well they are
skylfull men of war / that they tarried there no lengar: they are gone to
their own holds with all their pyllage and prisoners. Thus the Earl and the
duchess his daughter co^muned toguyder. And Perot le Bernoys and Olyue Barbe /
the Bourge of Co^payne / the Bourg angloys / Apthon Seguyn / and the other
capitayns of the fortresses when they were come to Ousacke / they departed
their botye / pyllage / and prisoners. And some they raunsomed / and the other
they led to their fortresses / Some to Carlat / and some to Gaslucet / All
the country of Auuergne took better head to they holds / than they had done
before: How be it the earl of Armynake and the earl Dolphyn sent to Perotte
le Bernoys / saying: how falsely and traytourously he had taken and stolen
the town of Mountferant and robbed it / and led away the prisoners
counsaylynge him to make thereof amends. Consydringe how they were in treaty
toguyder ^or a peace. Perotte answered and said: Saving their graces / as for
my self and seuyn other Capitayns that were with me at the taking of
Mountferant / were never at no manner of treaty with these Earls / nor we took
not this town fraudulently / nor stale it: But I entered in at the gate which
was opyned ready to receive me. If I and my company had been sworn to any
treaty / we would have kept it surely / But we were never of that entencyon
nor will be. In this case the matter stood and the lords could have none other
answer. Sir Peter of Gyache was sore displeased / for the loss that he had:
And as for them of Mount ferant / recovered them self as well as they might.
Thus this adventures fell.

How the duke of Berrey married the lady Mary his daughter to the earl of Bloys
son: And how the same year the son of the duke of Berrey married the lady
Mary of France / suster to the young king Charles of France. Cap. C.xxiii.
IN the year of our lord God / a thousand three hundred fourscore and six /
in the month of August / Guye the earl of Bloyes and the Lady Mary his wife
departed fro ye town of Bloyes / well acompanyed with knights and squyes /
ladies and damoselles to go in to Berrey / and they had with them their young
son / who had fyaunced the year before / Mary daughter to the duke of
Berrey. and the entencyon of the earl of Bloyes and of the countess his wife /
was that when they should come to Burgus in Berrey / to proceed to ye said
marriage. In likewise it was the entencyon of the duke of Berrey and of the
duches his wife. Thus wha^ all these perties were come together / than these two
children were joined togider in marriage in the church of saint Stephyn in
Burgus by a Cardynall / the chancellor of Berrey and the bishop of Poyters
had the year before ensured them toguyder. It this marriage of Loyes of Bloyes
and of the lady Mary of Berrey in the city of Burgus / was made great feast
and tryumphes with iustes and turneyes. This feast endured eight days. wha^
this was accomplysshed / the earl of Bloyes and the countess took leave of
the duke of Berrey and of the duchess / and so returned to Bloyes and had
with them their young daughter. Also in the same year John^ of Berrey son to
the duke of Berrey called Earl of Mountpensier married the lady Mary of France
suster to the young king of France. In the same year that these Maryages were
thus made: In the time of lent / the duchess of Berrey and Mary of France
her daughter / and her son rode to the town of Bloyes / to se the Earl
Bloyes and the countess / and their children. They were received in to the
Castle of Bloyes with great joy. At all these matters I sir Johan Froissarte
was present: And when they had been there in great Feast three days / they
departed and took their way to Poyters: but they went by water by the river of
Loyre to Amboyse / and fro thens in chares and on horseback / till they came
to Poytou. There the duchess held her house most commonly in a good castle
and good town called Chynon In this year dyed Mary of France being young /
who was wife to the earl of Mountpenlier. In likewise soon after dyed the lady
Jane of Armynake duchess of Berrey. Thus the duke of Berrey and his son were
to marry again (as they did) but not over soon. Of the which maryages / and
specyallye of the dukes: I shall show you here after / when the matter shall
require to have it declared.

YE have well herd here before / how the duke of Guerles had defied the
French king dispyte fully / which was spoken o^ sar and nere. For as the brute
was / it was not done in no curtesse manner / but out of the style and usage of
all other defyances. Truth it is / I saw my self certain writings in
paper / the which was said to be the true copy: But because I saw it not
vnderseale / nor aproued as such matters ought to be that touch great princes /
such as is the French king / therefore I gave no greatcredence thereto: How be
it / it seemed well that this defyaunce was displeasaunt to the realm / and
would have it amended. And that the duke of Guerles should excuse him of the
spytefull words that were in the defyaunce. The kings counsel would in no
wise that the matter should rest so / for the great lords of France said.
Without the king found some remedy / they and all the realm should be greatly
to blame: And they said how the king was young and forward / and yt was well
seen in his journey in Flaunders. And if he go not forward now to revenge
this deed / men would speak dyuerslye of the nobles of the realm of France /
who should counsel the king / and are sworn to keep and defend his honor
/ and to refourme all that is mysordred. And to the intent that the king nor
the realm should bear no blame the lord of Coucy took pain in the matter:
And showed well how the matter touchedde him nere. He knew the almayns better
tha^ he did any other / for he had been often in their co^panyes / as well
for the challenge that he made to the duchy of Austryche / as for other
insydentes that he had among them.

THe kings uncles saw well how all the nobles of the Realm were well
enclyned to have the matter redressed / and specially the duke of Burgoyne had
great affectyon thereto / for the duke of Guerles haryed and pylled the duchess
of Brabantes country / The which enherytaunce should return to him after ye
death of the two ladies who were right aged / both the duches and her sustre.
wherefore he would that outher by war or other means / that the duke of
Guerles were apeased. How be it first of all it was requisyte to make all the
members of France one and of one opinyon: For it should be a far journey for
the king to go out of France in to Almaygne to conquer lands and countries
/ The which the king could not do / without he had all his hole puyssaunce
with him / for it was not known whyder the almaygnes / who be covetous people
/ would help and assyst the duke of Guerles or not. Also furthermore / the
duke of Burgoyne and the other noble men of France / saw well how the duke
of Bretayne was in great difference with the realm of France and began
marvelously. and showed by his deeds that he had as live have war with ye
realm of France as peace: And the lords knew well how he provided his
towns / castles / and cities with great prouisyon of men / vitayls / and
artillary / to defend any siege. And besides that / often times he wrote in to
England with loving treatable words to make alyaunce for ever: And the
Englysshmen were wyllyng thereto to the intent that their war with France /
might be the better for them after. Thanne the counsel of France would not
that there should be left behind them such a mist in Bretaygne / but that
first it might be put a way by good means and condute. They thought they
would not put the realm in that doubt: If the king should go in to Almaygne
and leave the realm destytute (as this the Kings uncles ymagined) They wyste
not how to stop the duke of Bretayne / for as than such as they had sent
thither were returned: as the bishop of La^gers / sir Johan of Vyen / and
sir Johan de Beull. They showed the king and his uncles how they had done
nothing to purpose. tha^ the duke of Berry aduysed to send to Bretayne to
entreat with the duke his cosyn / the earl of Stampes who was a sage person
and a treatable. Than the duke desired him and said. Fair cosyn / it behooves
that ye go in to Bretaygne to speak with our cosyn the duke there. If ye find
him hard and high of words / chafe not with him / treat him swetely and
after a good manner. And speak sagely to him / and bring him in to good reason
and it may be: And show him how the king and I and my brother of Burgoyne /
would nothing to him but good love and peace And if he will abide and hold
with us / we shall always be ready to do him pleasure. and also show him that
as for the castles that he holds of the co^stables / how that for a small
occasion he has ceased them. But and it would please him to render them again
/ it should be greatly to his honor. And how that the king shall give him as
fair and as good as they be / in any other place where he will chose in the
realm. Good cosyn do so much as to bring us some good tydinges / and for any
tarieng there / depart not fro him till ye bring some matter to pass: and have
well in your remembrance all this business and all his answer / and the
order of his estate. The earl of Stampes answered and said. Sir / all this
shall be done right gladly.

AFter that the earl of Sta^pes had this charge fro the duke of Berey to go in
to Bretayne to the duke his cosyn: He tarried not long but made himself ready
and passed by Chartres / and through the good country of Main / and so came to
Angers and there found the queen of Naples / who had been wife to the duke of
Aniou: Who was called king of Naples / of Cicyle / of Jerusalem / and duke of
Pole / of Calabre / and earl of Prouence: And in her company her two fair
sons Loyes and Charles. The lady received her cosyn the earl of Stampes
joyfully / and there was John^ of Bretayne who loved not the duke of Bretayne /
but he was not in power to show forth his yuell will / nor to amend it. When
therle of Stampes had been there a day and a night / he took his leave and
departed and rode to Chasteaulx / and iourneyed so long that he came to the
cite of Nau^tes and there refresshed him. And than he demanded where the duke
was / and it was showed him how he was in the marches of We^nes and
therefou^de the duke who received him ioyously / for they were nere cosyns
togider. The earl of Stampes who right well could acquyte himself among great
princes and ladies (for he had been brought up among them in his youth)
acquytedde him self right sagely with the duke. And showed not the princypall
affectyon of his courage at his first coming / but dissymuled two or three
days / and when he saw his time he humyled him self greatly to the duke /
the rather thereby to draw him to his intent / and than said. Sir and my right
dear cosyn / ye ought not to marueyle though I am come so far of to se you /
for greatly I have desired it. And than notably he showed him the charge that
he had to say to him / on the behalf of the duke of Berrey / of the which
words the duke made light. And for resolucion of answer at that time / the
duke said. Cosyn we know well this that ye have said is true. I shall
remember me and ye shall abide here with us as long as it shall please you /
for your coming does us great pleasure. Other answer the earl could not
have / as at that time. The earl tarried there a fyftene days / and the duke
showed him great love / and showed him the fair castle of Ermyn / which was
nere to Wannes the which the duke had newely made / and there he took part of
his pastau^ce. And always when he saw a conuenyente time / he showed
swetely and sagely the cause of his coming. And ever the duke answered him so
covertly / that the earl could have no surety in any answer / to make any
restytucion of a hundred thousand frankes nor of the castles that he held of
the constables / the which yet at the end he did / and that was without
request of any person / when it was lest looked for (as I shall show you
hereafter as I was enfourmed) When ye earl Stampes saw that he lay there in
vain / than he thought to take his leave / and to return in to France / and
so he did. The duke gave him leave / and at his departing gave him a fair
white palfrey / aparelled and it had been for a king / and gave him a fair
ring with a stone / well worth a thousand frankes. Thus the earl departed
and returned by Angers / and there found the queen of Napoles / and Johan of
Bretayne / who greatly desired to here tidings and said. Fair cosyn / I
think ye have sped well / for ye have tarried long out. Than the earl showed
part of his business but finally how he had spedde nothing. When he had
tarried there a day / he departed and went to Towrs / and at last came in to
Berrey / and found the duke at Mehyn / a castle of his / which he had newly
made / and had workmen daily thereon. When the duke of Berrey saw the earl of
Stampes he made him good chere / and demanded tydinges of Bretayne. There he
declared fro point to point all that he had sent and herd / and said: how
in no wise he could break the duke of Bretayne fro his purpose. The duke of
Berrey passed the matter lightly / when he saw it would be none otherwise. And
so returned in to France to the king and to the duke of Burgoyne his brother
/ and showed them how he had sent in to Bretaygne to the duke his cosyn the
earl of Stampes / and declared in every point how he had spedde. Thus the
matter rested / when they saw none other remedy.

How after the departing of the duke of Lancaster all that ever he had won
in Galyce / the frenchmen recovered it in less than fyftene days / and how
the englisshmen that had been there i^ that war defamed and spoke yuell of the
country of Galyce / and how the french king sent for the duke of Irelande.
Ca. C.xxiiii.
IT has been resyted here before in this hystory / how the englisshmen did in
Galyce / and how the duke and the duchess / and his daughter came to ye Port
of Portyngale / and there tarried a season with king Johan of Portugale / and
with the young queen / daughter to the duke of Lancastre (as ye have herd here
before) It anoyed greatly the duke / and not without a cause / in that he had
done nothing for his profit all that season in Castyle / but that he had
done was to his great damage / his men deed of sykenes of the best of his
company / knights and squyers. And such conquest as he had made with great
pain and cost / he saw well it should besoone recovered again by the king
of castle. And in deed so it was. for as soon as he was departed and entered in
to Portugale / and that the spanyardes and knights of France / such as were
tarried there with sir Olyuer of Clesquyn constable of Castyle / saw that the
duke of Lancastre was departed / and that in manner all his english men were
departed fro him. Than they set forward to reconquere again all that had been lost of the realm of Castyle / the which was sone done / for they of the
towns / castles / and cities in Galyce / had rather to have been under the
obeysaunce of the king of Castyle / than under the duke of Lancaster / without
he had been able to have kept the field / to have defended the country. For
they of Castyle / Lombardy / and of Italy / of usage ever they say (Live he
that is strongest / and he that wynneth) All that ever the duke of Lancastre
had won fro the feast of Easter to the beginning of July / all was won
again and refresshed with new frenchmen and men of Castyle / and the
englysshmen that were left there by the duke in garysons (who thought to have
tarried there peasably all the winter) were sone put out / outher by fair
means or perforce / and some slain / such as would not yield up / and some
returned by saueco^ducte to pass by Portugale / and so to Bayon or to
Bordeaux. And of all this the duke of Lancastre was well aduertysed / he being
in the city of Port in Portugale / but he could not remedy it / which was
ryghtsore dypleasaunte to his heart. It is not to be believed the contrary / for
the more noble / valiant / and sage that a man is / displeasures to him be the
more bitter and paynefull. how be it the duke would say often times (and bare
out a good face) If we have lost this year / by the grace of god a another
season shall be for us. the fortunes of this world are meruaylous / they can
not be always permanente. Also the king of Portugale gave him always good
comfort / and said. Sir ye may abide here and keep your astate / and write to
your brethren and friends in England / that they may send you this next
March a five or sire hundred spears / and two thousand archers / and I shall
gather to gyder my power and people / who have good minds to make war into
Castyle / and so we shall make a good war. sometime one country wynneth and a
another leseth. The duke of Lancastre thanked the king of Portugale of his good
comfort and offer. How beit for all that the king was ye dukes son in law
/ and had married his daughter / and that he said was of a good will. yet for
all that the duke discovered not all his courage / for he knew well England
was in trouble / and great debate a monge the lords / and how the lords
had matters yno we to attend unto / as well for the keeping of the fronters
against Scotland / as for to treat with the duke of Bretaygne. And the king
knew well that when the duke came out of England / there was a do to set
forward his army / wherefore he thought it should be hard to get any new
aid thence / saying the realm at so many great charges all ready / and also he
thought well that such englysshmen as were returned would no more come thither
again / but thought rather that they should dyscorage other to come. the duke
considered all these matters in his mind / and when he had been a season at the
city of Port with the king of Portugale / than on a day he said. Sir / it
should be for my profit to return to Bayon / and to the marches of Burdeaulx
for diverse reasons. He saw well his being in Portugale could do him little
aduau^tage / for there he was not on his heritage that he desired / but he
said his going in to the archebysshoppriche of Bordeaux and of Aulose / and
so to return by Bygore / and so by the land of the lombrisience / of the
county of Foyze / and county of Armynake / and so by Garonne / Dordone / and
entering in to Pier gourte and Querchyn / Rochelloys / Xayntone / Cristynge /
Poictou / Auuergne and Lymosyn / wherein were many garysons and castles holden
of the englisshe part / who would all make war for his sake. Wherefore he
said it were better for him to be among them to counsel and encorage them /
than to be in any other place. And also he said how Portugale was far of to
here any news out of England / and also he knew well yt the englyssh men
would be loathe to come thither because of the long voyage by see / and also he
knew well that ships of Spaygne / of Galyce / and of Castyle were going and
coming on the sea in and out to Flaunders with their marchandyses / which was
also great danger for encountrynge of them. All these things consydred / the
duke of Lancastre prepared for his departing / and had ships appointed him by
the king / and a patron called Alphons Bretat. When these galyes were ready
and the wind good / the duke and the duches and her daughter / took leave of
the king of Portugale and of the queen / and so took shyppynge and entered on
the sea / abiding gods pleasure and wyndes. They had wind and wether at
pleasure / so that they aryued at Bayon of whose coming they of the country
were joyful / desyringe sore to se them.

When the duke and the duches and their daughter were aryued at Bayon. Tidings
thereof spredde abroad / and they of Burdeloys were right joyful thereof. Than
sir Johan of Harpdame senesshall of Bordeaux / and the senesshall of the lands
came thither to se the duke / and so did other gentlemen of the country / as
the lord of Mucydente / the lord of Duras / the lord of Rosem / the lord of
Landuras / the lord Lespare / the lord of Newechasteaur / and other knights
and squyers of the country. Thus they came daily / some at one time some at
another / all they offered him their service / as they ought to do to their
lord. Thus the duke tarried at Bayon / and often times sent in to England to
the king his nephewe / and to his other brethren. But for all his writynge he
was nothing comforted / another with men of arms nor archers / for as the
world went than / the dukes business was little taken head unto / nor lord
/ knight / nor squire to make any have to auaunce forward to the aid of the
duke of Lancastre. for such as had been in Portugale made such report through
the realm of England / that no man had courage to auaunce thither / but every
man said. the voyage in to Castyle is to far of fro us. It is more profitable
for us to have war with France / for that is a good sweet country and
temperate / and good lodgings and fair sweet ryuers. And in Castyle there is
no thing but hard rocks and Mountains / which are not good to eat / and
an intemperate air / and troubled ryuers / and diverse meats / and strong
wynes and hot / and poor people / rude / and yuell arrayed / far of fro our
manner. wherefore it were folly to go thither / for if we enter in to any great
city or town there wenynge to find maruayles / we shall find nothing but
wine / larde / and empty cofers. This is contrary to the realm of France /
for there when it is fortune to win any town or city / we find such
richesse that we be a basshed thereof / and it is good to make war where we
may have profit. let us adventure there / and leave the unhappy war of
Castyle and Portugale / where is no thing but pouuertye and damage. Thus the
english men said in England / such as had been in Castyle / so that the
lords perceived well how that voyage was out of the favor of the english
men. Also the realm was in trouble / and the justice of Triuylyen and outher
but newly done / and the duke of Irelande departed out of the Realm / and
king Richard came to the guydynge of new counsel / the which he had not
well learned. So by reason of such insydentes the matters abode in hard case
for the duke of Lancastre / being in the city of Bayon / where he held all
that season.

ALl these busynesses as well in Castyle and Portugale / as in England (and of
the departing of the duke of Irelande) was well known with the french king
and his counsel. Than to have more parfyte knowledge / it was ordained by the
french king and by his uncles to send to Trecte to ye duke of Irelande /
where as he was / and to give him a sure saueconduct to come into France and
to tarry there as long as both parties were pleased. It was behouable to
send for him by special messangers / and sure writing fro the king / or else
the duke of Irelande would not have come there / for he knew well that he was
out of the love and favor of the lord Coucy / who was a great baron in the
realm of France / and was of a great lynage. He had no cause to love him (as
ye have herd before) for acordynge to the truth the duke had not well
acquyted himself to his wife / who was daughter to the lord Coucy. And
certainly it was the principal thing that took away the good renome of his
honor / both in France and in other places. And in likewise he was blamed /
defamed / and hated in England / as well as in France. When the french king
had concluded to send for the duke of Irelande / the lord of Coucy spoke as
much against it as he might / but there were so many reasons laid to him (and
also because the king would have it) that he was content to suffer it. The
french king who was but young desired greatly to se the duke of Irelande /
because he was reputed to be a good knight / and also because it was said how
he was so well beloved with the king of England. Thanne he was sent for by a
knight and a clerk / a notary of the kings. When the Duke of Irelande herd
first how the french king had sent for him / he had maruayle thereof / and
had diverse imagynacyons for what entente he should be sent for in to
France / how be it finally he thought the might go surely in to France to se
the king by reason of his saueconducte / and to return again at his
pleasure. Than he departed fro Trecte / and rode forth with them that the
king had sent to him / and rode so long that they came to Paris / for as than
the king was there in his castle of Lowre. There the duke was well received of
the king and of his uncles. The french king desired him to abide there still
and appointed him a place to keep his house and astate in / for the duke had
enough so to do / for he had conveyed out of England good enough. And also ye
constable of France ought him certain money for the ransom of Johan of
Bretayne / the which was not all paid as than. Thus the duke went when it
pleased him to se the king / and had good chere. and at all feasts / iustes
/ and triumphs the duke was always sent for.

How the Constable of France would not acorde that the king should go in to
Almayne / because of the insydentes of the realm / and how the duke of
Bretaygne fournysshed his garysons and made alyaunce with the king of England
and with the king of Nauerre / and of the army made by the english men. Cap.
C.xxv.
YE have herd before how the earl de Stampes was sent in to Bretayne by the
duke of Berrey / thinking to have brought the duke of Bretayne with fair
words to his mind and entensyon / But he could not bring it about / but
returned again without atteynynge any thing of his purpose. whereof they in
France were greatly abashed / and specially such as were of the kings
counsel / for they knew well the king had great desire to go in to Almayne /
to se the lands of his cosyns the duke of Iulyers / and to be revenged of the
high words and cruel defyaunces of the duke of Guerles. The wise men of the
counsel of France such as conceived well the matter imagyned therein great
parell to the realm / for they clearly perceived how the duke of Bretayne
would in no wise condyscende to reason / but held still his purpose. They
thought it was greatly preiudycyall to the honor of the realm of France /
for him to take the constable of France / and to set him at ransom at a
hundred thousand frankes / and to keep three of his castelles and a good town.
And also they saw how the duke of Bretayne was making of great alyaunces
with the king of England / and knew well how the duke fortifyed greatly his
towns and castles in Bretayne / and went about to get him friends in diverse
parties / in so much that many of the noble men of Bretayne wyste not what
to do / outher to go in to France or to a bide there still with the duke and
to take his part against the king or the realm of France / the which they
never thought to do / for the most part of the knights and Squyers of
Bretaygne were always good french / But the counsel of France doubted that
if the king went out of the realm with his puyssaunce / the which he must
needs do if he should goo in to Almaygne / that than the duke of Bretayne to
bring in to his country the englysshmen / outher at saint Malowe / at saint
Mathewes / or at Lamballe / or Camperle / or Lantriguier at Guerrando / or
Bownte / or at Wennes / or on the sea cost. For the englysshemen could not
have a better enter in to France than by Bretayne. So that they knew not (the
kings honor saved) how to break the duke of Bretayne fro his purpose. Some
of the kings counsel said / it shall be to the kings dishonor if he break
not the dukes purpose / for ye duke is not lord peasably over his own
country / for we think the lords / knights / and squyers of Bretayne will
not be against us / to maintain the dukes opynion / therefore in the name of
god let the king keep on his voyage / and let the constable and other
lords a bide in their countries and defend the Realm. This opinion was well
uphold with many of the kings counsel. but than some other said nay
thereto / and said how the king could not well go out of his realm without
he had his constable with him / for he is more wyser and has more experyence
in war than a great nombre of other. Thus they argued. Than some other said /
let two of the kings uncles go or one of them at the lest / and laid it to
the duke of Burgoyne that he should go with two thousand spears / and sire or
seven thousand of other men of war / and said / it was most metest for him
to go / for that war touched him nere / because it moved by reasone of the
duchy of Brabante / and that he should have with him them of Brabante / of
whom he should find in nombre to the some of seven hundred spears / and.xx.
or thurty thousand of other commons of the country of Brabante. Than a another
sort said. sirs / your opynyons be not good for the king will go / he names
himself the chyefe of this war / for he is defied / wherefore he must go /
consydrynge the charge is his / it is good that he go / for he is young / and
the more he contynueth the war the better he shall love it. than some other
said. Who is he that is so hardy to counsel the king to go in to Almayne /
in to so far a country / among them that be high and prowed people / and
great parell it is to enter upon them. And if the king were entered / yet it
were great danger the retournynge again. for when they shall know the king
and all the nobles of France to be entered in to their country / they will
than assemble all together / and keep such a country as they know / and we
not / and so they may do us great damage / for they are covetous people above
all other. And they have no pytie / if they have the upper hand / and are
hard and yuell handelers of their prisoners / and puts them to sundry
pains / to compel them to make their raunsomes the greater. and if they have
a lord or a great man to their prisoner / they make great joy thereof / and
will convey him in to Boesme / or in to Austryche / or in to Xasenne / and keep
him in some castle inhabytable. They are people worse than sarazins or paynyms
/ for their excessyue covetousness quenches the knowledge of honor. Let
us go and put the king in danger among these people / and if any thing
happen to fall a mysse / as the chances of fortune are maruaylous / what shall
be said than? how we have brought the king thither to betray him / and to the
dystructyon of the realm / and not for the augmentynge thereof. God defend the
realm fro all damage and parell. If the king go he must have part of his
noble men with him. And if mysse fortune fall / the realm of France is lost
without recovery. Therefore look wisely if it be good to counsel the king to
go that voyage in to Almayne. Than some other / such as had wisely coniected
all parelles in their imagynacyons said. In the name of god let another the
king go / nor yet send thither no puyssaunce. For though the duke of Guerles
who is but young / and that youth of wit have made him to defye the king /
which was not done by no great wisdom / nor good counsel / but rather done
by folissh pride of young people / who would fly or they have wings. And
sithe he has thus defied the king / let him alone and suffer him to
pursewe his desyaunce / the realm of France is great / if he enter in to the
realm in any manner of wise / the king shall sone be enfourmed thereof / and
than he shall have a just cause to styre up his people / and to go and fight
against him / where so ever he find him / or else to make him fly or yield
him in the field / and thereby the king shall have more honor and less charge
than to go in to Guerles / for such as know the country say / that or we
can come to the duke if he list / we must pass a four great ryuers / the
list of them as great as the river of Loyre at Namurs or Charity. Also they
say / it is a foul country and yuell lodgings.

THe noble men and counsaylouts of France were thus in diverse imagynacyons on
this voyage / that the king would make in to Almayne / and surely it had been
auaunsed the sooner forward and they had not douted the venym that might grow
by the occasyon of Bretayne / and of the duke there / that matter drew them a
back. And indede they had good cause to doubt it / for the duke of Bretayne
was well infourmed of the defyaunce that the duke of Guerles had made to the
French king / and how that the young king Charles would go in to Almayne.
The duke looked for nothing else / but that the king should be ones departed out
of his Realm of France / he had ordained and concluded between him and the
english men / to suffer the englisshe army to enter in to his country. And
also he had by subtyle means drawn to his acorde the most part of the good
towns of Bretaygne / and specially Nauntes / Wennes / Rennes / Lentriguier /
Guerra^do / Lambale / saint Malo / and saint Mathewe defyn poterne / but the
noble men he could not get to his opinion. Than the duke imagyned if the
lords should go with the constable of France in to Almayne / thanne his war
and entente should the sooner come to pass. He caused his towns and castles to
be well provided for / with vytayles and artyllary / and he showed well how he
inclyned rather to the war than to have pease. Also he had great alyaunce
with Charles they young king of Nauerre / and the duke promised him / that if
he might come to his intent (to have puyssaunce of men of arms and archers out
of England) he would bring them straight in to Normandy / and recover first
the good towns and castles that king Charles of France uncle to the king of
Nauerre / had taken fro him by his men / as the lord of Coucy and outher. Of
this the king of Nauer had great trust / and by reason thereof he held in
humble love the duke of Lancastre who was at Bayon / for between them was
great alyaunces. And of all this I saw great appearance / as I shall show
after.

IN the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred fourscore and eight /
the seventh day of Aprell / it was concluded by the king of England and his
counsel / and by his uncles / the duke of york / and the duke of Glocestre /
that the earl Richard of Arundell should be heed and chief of an army on the sea / with him a thousand men of arms / and three thousand archers / and to
be at Hamton the fyftene day of May / and there to find his navy ready
apparelled. And every man that was appointed to go to be there ready at that
day. And the king of England on saint Georges day next after / held a
great feast at his castle of Wyndesore. And there were the chief lords that
should go with therle of Arundell / and there they took their leaves of the
king and of the queen / and of all other ladies / and so came to Hampton at
their day appointed / and entered in to their ships the twenty day of May /
which was a fair clear day. There was the earl of Arundell / the earl of
Notyngham / the Earl of Deuonshyre / sir Thomas Percy / the lord Clifforde /
sir John^ of Ware / wyke / sir Willyam de la Selle / the lord Cameux / sir
Stephyn de Libery / sir Willyam Helman / sir Thomas Moreaur / sir Johan
Dambreticourt / sir Roberte Sere / sir Peter Mountbery / sir Loys Clombo / sir
Thomas Coq / sir Willyam Pulle / and diverse other. They were of good men of
arms a thousand spears / and about a three thousand archers. They had with
them no horses / for they trusted if they might come to their ententes to
enter in to Bretayne / and there to refresshe them where as they should find
horses ynowe at a good price to serve them. The day that they departed fro
Hampton was so fair and peasable that it was marvel. they drew toward
Normandy not purposyng to land in any part / but to pass by the fronters of
Normandy and Bretayne / till they herd other news. They had in their navy
certain vessels called Ballengers / who sailed on before to se if they might
find any adventure / in like manner as knights do by land go before the
bataylles to dyscouer the country and enbusshes. Now we shall leave a season
of speaking of this army / and speak somewhat of the business of Guerles and
Brabant / and show how the siege was laid to Grave.

How the brabansoys laid siege to the town of Grave. And how the constable
of France took saint Malo and saint Mathewes / and set there men in garyson
/ and how the duke of Lancastre was at Bayon greatly dyscomforted / in that he
could get no manner of aid. Cap. C.xxvi.
AS it has been showed here before of the ancient dukes of Guerles / and how
the eldest son of the duke of Guerl^s (of whom I treat at this present time)
was married to the daughter of Berthalce of Malynes / thereby to bring him out
of danger / and to redeem again his heritage / the which was in sore trouble
before. and the duke of Guerles son to the duke of Iulyers to entertayne and
to keep ye town of Grave against the brabansoys / as he had cause and just
title. When he saw how he could not get again his three castles / Gauleth
/ Buth / and Nulle on the river of Muse / pertaining to his heritage / and to
the country of Guerles / thought than to attrybute the town of Grave to his
heritage for ever. this duke had a bastard daughter / married to the son of
the lord Bruke / who was enherytour to the town of Grave. So there was an
amyable treatye between them / as between the fader and the son. and there
the lord of Bruke gave the town and sygnory of Grave to the duke of Guerles /
in presence of the knights of Guerles and Iuliers. and for that cause the duke
of Guerles did recompense the lord of Bruke with the lands of Bresde / on the
river of Lighen in the duchy of Guerles / marchyng on the country of Holande
above Brabaunte. At this town of Bresde there was a fair castle / and the
town great and profitable / how be it the town of Grave was better. This the
duke of Guerles did to the intent to have a just title to keep the town of
Grave against the brabansoys. The duches of Brabant and the brabansoys said /
how the lord of Bruke had it but to pledge / and that they might quyte it out
when they would / but the duke of Guerles said nayetherto. By reason whereof the
war moved. So that in the month of May / the brabansoys came and laid syege
to the town of Grave / with many lords / knights / and squyers / and with
the puyssaunce of other good towns in Brabante. And thither they brought engyns
/ springals / and other habylimentes of war. They were a.xl. thousand one
and other / there was skrymysshynge daily. The town of Grave stands on the
river of Muese on the side of Brabante / and there is a bridge over the river
to go in to the country of Guerles. At this siege every thing was plenty /
and as good chepe of every thing / as though they had been before Brusels.
Every day there was skrymysshynge at the barryers of Grave / of such as would
adventure them self. Sometime they were put a back / and some time they drove
their enemies in to their town / as chance of adventure fell. The duke of
Guerles was well infourmed of this siege. He lay a four leages fro Nymarse /
and wrote often times in to England / where he trusted to have socoure by
reason of the english army / whereof the earl of Arundell was capytayne on the sea / as soon as wind and wether will serve them. to come to Guerles to reyse
the syege before Grave. The duke of Guerles knew well that the town of Grave
was strong and well forty fyed / so that he thought it could not be won by
none assaute / but outher by trayson or by treatye. He trusted them of Gruae
to be sure and faithful to him. Thus the siege endured long before Grane. And
the earl of Arundels army was on the sea / and took no land / but still kept
on the fronters of Normandy / So that the normans fro against Mount saint
Mychell / and down alonge to Deep to saint Valery and to Croty / were not well
assured whereto they should take heed. The ports and havens of Normandy were
refresshed by the french king / with good men of arms and crose bows / to
resyste against all parelles. And by the marshall of Blankewyll was set in
the town of Carentyne / standyge on the sea (which before of old time
pertayned to the heritage of king Charles of Nauerre) the lord of Ambre and
the lord Coucy / two great lords of Normandy. And the Constable of France
took the town of saint Malo and the town of saint Mathews / and as soon as
they knew that the english men were on the sea / they set men in to those
towns in the name of the french king. In this season they thought surely to
have open war with the duke of Bretayne / for the knights and squyers said
/ that the army on the sea of the englysshmen were sent thither for none other
purpose / but sent for by the duke of Bretayne to land in his country. They
said it was none other lykely / for always the ships kept on the cost of
Bretaygne / without force of wethersome time caused them to depart. yet
always breuely they returned again to the same cost.

yE have herd here before / how the duke of Lancaster was departed out of the
realms of Castyle and Portugale. the imagynacyons that he had turned him to
great dyspleasure / for he saw well his business was sore troubled and darked
/ as fortune often times falls in sondrie persons / sometime good sometime
yuell / when it is lest thought on. For when the duke of Lancastre departed out
of the realm of England / aco^panyed with good me^ of arms and archers he
thought than to have sped otherwise than he did. He saw and herd / how that
in xv. days he had lost all Galyce / which was a long season or he had won
it / the space of xvi. wekes. And beside that his men deed and sparcled abroad
/ some here and so^e there / and hoped of no conforte out of England / for the
Englysshmen were weary of the war of Spaygne. They thought it over long and
far of fro them. So the duke of Lancastre thought his business in a hard
case / seeing no comfort / he spoke little but he thought much more. In his
ymaginacyon he lyconed his journey to the voyage that the duke of Aniou made in
to the realm of Naples: For when he departed out of the realm of France / he
was well furnysshed of all manner of thing / and went with great richesse /
puissaunce / and a great nombre of noble men of arms knights and s^^uiers:
and at the end all were slain and lost. Thus the duke of Lancastre reckoned
his v^yage to come to nothing / by reason of such disconforte as he had. The
earl of Foiz / Who was in his country of Bierne / and was eight sage and
ymaginatyue / said and accompeed the duke of Lacasters vyage but lost / as
inrecoueryng of the realm of Castyle / which he challenged. The duke of
Lacastre who was a sage and a wise prince / and valiant among all his
disconfytures / yet sometime he took comfort to him self. I shall show you
how and by what means.

He saw well he had a fair daughter by the lady Custaunce his wife / daughter
to done Peter king of Castyle / in whose right and claim he made his war in
Castyle. He thought though fortune were against him at that time / yet it
might turn good to his daughter / who was fair and young / for she had right
to the heritage of Castyle / by reason of her mother. and thought yt some
valiant man of France would be glad to covet to have her in marriage / as
well for the right that she had to the realm of Castyle / as for her high
lynage: For it might well be said / that her extraction was of the highest
lynage of Christendom. Wherefore the duke of Lancaster would gladly have had
some treaty of marriage with some noble man of France. He knew well the
French king had a young brother called the duke of Towrayne / who he thought
should be able to recover his daughters right in Castyle: For he knew well
that the puyssaunce of France held in his adversaries / in the heritage of
Castile. wherefore he thought yt if they would take his part / they might
lightly put his daughter in possessyon of the realm of Castyle / if he might
marry her to the French kings brother.

How the duke of Berrey sent letters to the duke of Lancastre to Bayon: and
how the duke sent the copye of the same letters in to Foiz and in to Nauer /
to thentent to have them publysshed in Spain: And how the duke of Bretayn
demanded counsel of his men in all his business. Cap. C.xxvii.
ON this ymaginacyon rested the duke of Lancastre / not all only on the duke
of Towrayne / but also on the duke of Berrey / For (as ye have herd here
before) ye duke of Berrey and his son were wodowers both their wives deed.
This matter I the auctour of this book knew of surety / for the same time I
was on the fronters of Berrey and Poitou / in the county of Bloys / with the
right honorable lord Guy earl of Bloys by whom and at his desire / I followed
the co^tynuau^ce of this history. The duke of Berrey set all his entencion and
pleasure to be again married: And often times he would say among his men / how
that a lord was little worth without a lady / nor another man with out a
wife. Than some of his counsel said to him. Sir marry again your son /
thereby your house shall be the more joyful. Asirs quod the duke my son is
young. Why sir quod they / have ye not seen how the Earl of Bloyes has married
his son / who is as young as he to your daughter? That is truth quod the
duke / let se name a wife for him. sir quod they / we shall name the duke of
Lancasters daughter. With that word the duke studied a season and gave none
answer / and ymagined sore: and than to such as were of his secret counsel
/ he said. ye speak to mary Johan my son to my cosyn the duke of Lancasters
daughter by saint Denyce ye have well devised but she should be a good wife for
our self and shortly I shall write to our cosyn the duke of Lancastre: He is
at Bayone as I am informed / I would send him word how I shall send
shortly to him some of my counsel to treat of this marriage: But I say not
for my son / I shall marry him in some other place. When his counsel herd
him say so they smyled / Than ye duke demanded whereat they smiled. Sir quod
they we laughed / at that ye had rather have a good turn your self than your
son should. by my faith quod the duke and good reason why: For my fair
cosyn of Lancastre will not so soon agree to my son as to my self. Than
incontinent letters were written in to high Gascoyne to Bayon to the duke of
Lancaster / and sent by honorable messangers. When they came to ye duke they
delivered their letters. The duke took and reed the^ / and when he had well
parceyued theffecte of the matter / he was right joyful and made good chere to
the messa^gers and showed that he was well content therewith / and wrote again
by them other letters right amiably. Certifyeng the duke of Berrey how he was
right joyful of his letters. These messangers returned and found their lord
in Poitou / preparyng him self to go in to France: for the French king and
the duke of Burgoyne had sent for him / for to common of the state of
Bretayne. Than he oppned the letters that his cosyn the duke of Lancastre had
sent him / and had joy of the answer / and thought surely to pursue the
matter to effect but he might not leave his voyage in to France and so went
thither as shortly as he could. Thanne he wrote to a knight of his called sir
Helyon of Lignacke who as than was seneschall of Rochell / and of the country
of Rocheloys. Co^maundyng him that incou^ynent on the sight of his letters he
to set all thing there in good order and than to come to him to Paris
without fail. When sir Helyon of Lignac who was at Rochell understood those
tidings / and parceyued by the duke of Berreys letters / how he was sent for
in all have / he made him ready / and in his absence he made two capitayns at
Rochell / two valiant men to be gouerners of all Rocheloys. They were of the
country of Becaulse / the one called sir Peter of yon / and the other sir Peter
of Tayllepy. This done sir Helyon took his way in to France the shortest way
he could / for he knew not what the duke would do with him / that he sent for
him so hastily.

Now let us so^what speak of the duke of Lancastre who was at Bayon / and had
great ymaginacions of yt business that his cosyn the duke of Berrey had
written to him of. First he would not that it should be hydden but rather
publysshed abroad / to the intent that his enemies should know it / and
specially in the house of king Johan of Castyle. And so the duke of Lancastre
wrote to diverse / and sent them the copye of the duke of Berreys letters:
Showing by his writing / that he had great affectyon to treat of the marriage
/ between his daughter and the duke of Berry. First he sent his letters to the
earl of Foiz / because he knew well yt to the earls house prepared all manner
of gentylmen knights and squyers / as well coming and going to the king of
Spain / as on pylgrimage to saint James. Also he wrote to the king of Nauer /
who had to his wife ye king of Castles suster / and had by her many children:
to thentent that the brute thereof should the better be certifyed in the king of
Castles court / rather than by flyeng words. also the duke wrote of his matter
to the king of Portugale / but he wrote no word thereof i^ to England to the
king nor to his brethren / for he knew well he should have no thank for his
enterprice / as they were not content in deed / (as ye shall here after) when
ye matter requires it. In the mean season we shall speak of other matters / as
of the duke of Bretayne / the matter lies there after.

When the duke of Berrey was come into France to the king and to the duke of
Burgoyne his brother / and to other of his counsel: As the bishop of
Langers / the bishop of Laon / ye lord of Coucy / and other barons of
France / than being thereof the kings secret counsel. They had many
metynges to common toguyder / as well of the state of Guerles (whyder the king
had great affection to go) as of the duke of Bretaygne / whom they could bring
to no reason / nor would not obey / nor wyste not whom to send to him that he
would believe / for there had been many valyant men and sage with him / but all
that aueyled nothing / for they could bring nothing to pass as they desired /
whereof the king and his counsel was sore troubled. For they understood well
that the duke of Bretaygne had all that winter provided and fortifyed his
towns and castelles / and showed how by lykehode he had rather have war
than peace: and the wysest of the counsel said. We speak of going in to
Almayne / but we ought rather to speak of going in to Bretaygne / and to put
down the duke there / who is so high minded that he will here no reasone /
and is always against the crown of France / and disdayneth to be obedyent
thereunto. we shall have no reason of him without we force him thereto: For and if
he be suffered he will be to presumptuous he fears no man / nor he loves nor
prayseth no man but him self / this is a clear case. If the king go in to
Almaygne and leave his realm bare of men / as he must do if he go thither /
The duke of Bretaigne than will suffer the Englisshe men to come in to his
country / and so enter in to France. The apparaunce hereof is great / for
there is all ready a great army of archers on the sea and they keep still on the
cost of Bretaygne for if wind and wether put them of / yet ever they draw
thither again / and lies there at ancre / besemyng taryeng till the war be
opyn / Wherefore we think it were good yet to send again to the duke / the
bisshoppe of Langers and the earl of saint Poule / for the duke and the earl
have married two susters. Nay sirs not so quod master yues / who was a very
Breton. If ye will send to the duke again / ye can not send one more
agreeable to him than the lord of Coucy / for in likewise they have married two
susters / and have loved marvelously together / and have ever written each to
other. Fair brother / and with the lord of Coucy send whom ye will. well
quod the duke of Burgoyne: Master yues / sith ye have begone name you the
rest. Sir / with right a good will sith it pleases you / With the lord of
Coucy send sir Johan of Vyen and the lord de la River. These be such three
lords as shall bring him to reason / if he will ever come to any. Thus let it
be quod the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne. than they were appointed and
charged what they should say / and whereupon they should groude their matter /
and to handell him by fair words. Thus they tarried a certain space or they
departed fro Paris. The duke of Bretayne knew well of their coming or they
deperted fro Paris / but he could not tell when. And he saw well the matter
touched highlye in that the lord of Coucy came. The duke had many ymaginacyons
on that matter and discovered his mind to certain of his counsel: as the
lord of Mountbouchier / and demanded counsel of him and of other / and
said. Sirs / I here as the brute ro^ueth / that the duke of Lancaster should
mary his daughter in to France to the duke of Berrey: and the matter is so
forward / that sir Helyon of Lignacke is going to the duke to Bayon / and the
duke greatly enclyneth to this marriage / whereof I have great marueyle / for my
fair brother of Lancastre has not written to me thereof / so that I know
nothing of the matter but by heryng say: He was not accustomed so to do / for
in all his matters touching France / he was wount to write to me. than his
counsel answered and said. Sir / if it be thus / it must behoue you to
change your purpose / or else it shall be greatly to your loss and danger / and
bring your country in to war / which were good to eschew: For ye need not
to make war sithe ye may be in peace / yea? and desired thereto. Also my lady
your wy^e is great with child / the which ye ought to regard. The king of
Nauer can but tytell aid you / for he has enough to do for him self. Also
the duke of Lancaster who is a sage and a valyant prince (as it is said) shall
mary his daughter to the duke of Berrey. This shall be a great beginning to enter
in to a treaty of peace between England and France / or else a long truse:
And by reason thereof ye shall se at the end the king of Castle put out of
his realm / as they have kept him in and the rather if the duke of Lancastre
and the English men be agreed with him: and also it is of truth / that the
lord Coucye admyrall of France and the lord de la River / are coming hyder.
ye may well know that is for some great cause touching the king / who
busyeth him self for his constable and for his Realm. And by lykelyhode the
king and his uncles will know presisely what ye will do / and wheder ye will
keep still your opinyon or not. And if ye keep still your purpose / it is to be
ymagined / that the great army that is prepared for to go in to Guerles shall
turn against you. Now remember well what conforte ye are likely to have if
ye have war with France / which ye are most lykely to have if the duke of
Lancaster marry his daughter into France / as be semyng he will / for he can
not bestow her better to recover her heritage. Also ye know well that the
most part of the prelates / barons / knights and squyers / and cities and
good towns / are in manner ye against you. Therefore sir / sith ye demand
counsel of us / We say that ye had never so much cause to advise you (as ye
have now). Therefore put to your hand to keep well your heritage / which
has cost the shedyng of so much blood / sweat / and traueyle: and refrain
somewhat your ire and hatered. We know well ye bear great dyspleasure to sir
Olyuer Clysson. he has done you many displeasures / and ye him / and
paraduenture may do / though he be not like unto you. the French king and his
uncles will maynteygne him against you / for he shall he Constable. And if
king Charles that last dyed (who loved him so well) had lived / and ye done
as ye have done: We know well it should rather have cost the king half his
realm / thanne he would have suffered it. But king Charles his son is young
/ he takes not ^o good head to all matters now / as he would do ten years
here after. He comes on and ye shall go. If ye encre in to a new war
against the French men (beside all that we have showed you) ye shall do it
without our counsel and without the counsel of any man that loves you. It
behooves you to dissemule whatsoever ye purpose to do here after. What need you
to keep the three castelles parteynyng to sir Olyuer of Clyssons heritage /
after the manner took them? Wheder it be so ye have peace or war / they shall
cost you more the keeping of them in three years / than they shall profit you
in twelve years. Sir deliver them again out of your hands without any desire
/ and when the renome thereof spredeth abroad (as there is nothing done but it
will be known) yt without co^streynt ye have delivered them of your own mind
/ ye shall thereby attemper and molifye every man's displeasure / and it shall
greatly please the duke of Burgoyne / who ye know well has not done so much
against you as he might / in all your business. And that is by the means of
the good lady his wife your cosyn / She has many fair children who are next
of blood to you. therefore sir / consider fro whens ye came and are issued /
depart not far of fro thens that ye ought to approach nere it were follye /
in England ye had never thing to do. Also the Englysshmen have enough to do
among themself. They show you fair semblaunt of love / and promise to do
for you all yt they may / but they do it for their own advantage and for
nothing else. ye have proved them or this? ye were norisshed among the^ in
your youth?

How the duke of Bretayne delivered up the three castelles of sir Olyuer
Clissons: and how he received ioyously the lord of Coucy and his company
ambassadors fro the french king: And how the duke of Lancaster made great
chere to sir Helyon of Lignacke seneschall of Xaynton / ambassadoure fro the
duke of Berrey. Cap. C.xxviii.
When the duke of Bretayne had herd his counsel speak / and cast so many
reasonable doubts / he was abashed / and stood still a season without
speaking of any word / leanyng in a wyndowe lokyng down in to the court /
his counsel being about him / he stood in a great study: at last he turned
and said. sirs / I se well that ye have highly cou^sayled me / and I se well I
have need of nothing so much as of good counsel: But how may any love be
norisshed / where is no thing but hate? How may I love Olyuer of Clysson /
that has done me so many dyspleasures / Wherefore of all the things that ever
I did in this world / I most repent me of that I did not put him to death
when I had him in my castle of Ermyne? In the name of god sir quod they of his
counsel / (if he had been slain) but ye ought not to have raunsomed him / nor
taken his heritage. For Johan of Bretayne and the Vycount of Rohers son be
his heirs / and herytours to all his lands: for his daughters are their
wives. Wherefore they would have entered in to the heritage as their own / for
their resort is in to the Parlyament chamber at Paris. For ye have received all
ready great blame in France for that ye have done / and keeping of the three
castelles. The constable has entered his quarrel and plee against you in the
parlyament house of Paris / and there sentence will be given against you / for
there is none to answer for you against any article that the Constable has
laid against you. Than sir Olyuer of Clysson and his heirs shall have just
cause and quarrel to make war against you in his own tytell. And if the
king with other of your own country of Bretayne will make you war and aid
your enemies / ye have need than^e to have more puyssaunce to defend you /
thasie we can se that ye are like to have. Wherefore sir / while the plee
hangs / ye were best to deliver again the three castelles and have thank /
than to abide the sentence to be given against you. Sir agree / for such
dommages as ye have done as well as ye can / thereby shall you wade out of all
sclaundre / the which a prince ought to dout for his dishonor And sir /
co^ferme you to peace / and continue in love with them that ye ought to do /
that is the French king your soueraygne and natural lord / and my lord the
duke of Burgoyne and your cosyns his children. ye may take ensample by that ye
have seen in your days: your cosyn germayne therle of Flanders / who was a
might prince and a sage / yet by insyde^tes in the end of his days there fell
to him such marvelous adventures / yt without he had humyled him self to the
french king / to his uncles / and to the nobles of the realm he had lost
his heritage / and by their aid and help he recovered it. Well sirs quod the
duke / sith I have demanded counsel it behooves me to take it / and I
accept your words that ye have spoken.

THis matter went so forward that the duke of Bretayyne / who was in
possessyon of the three castelles of the constables (as ye have herd here
before) he sent for his men that was in them / and rydde his hands clean of
them: and there were stablysshed men in them for the constable: But this
restytuicion was not suffycient in the opynion of the French kings counsel
/ without the duke restored again the money that he had taken of the
Constable: and beside that the duke to come personally to the king to Paris to
make his excuse before all the peers of the realm / and to abide on the mendes
making / such as the king and his counsel should judge by good
delyberacion. And when the knowledge of the restytucion of these castles was
come to the lord of Coucye / and to the other lords that were appointed to go
in to Bretaygne to the duke. Than the lord of Coucy said to his company. Sirs
/ we have the less to do / I believe the duke will give credence to us when he
hears us speak. I was enfourmed that before these three barons departed fro
Paris / the dukes of Berrey and of Bourgoyne had them in counsel and said.
Sirs / ye must entreat the duke of Bretaygne with fair and sweet words /
and not rigorously. And show him how ye duke of Bourgoyne would that he
should come to Paris to the king: but at leest show him how he must come to
the half way to the town of Bloyes / and there we shall mete with him and
speak toguyder These three lords said they would do as they were commanded.
They rode forth and came to the city of Rennes in Bretayne / and there
demanded tidinges of the duke / and it was showed them how he was at Wannes
and than they rode tyhder. Their coming was anon known in the dukes court /
for they had sent before their herbygers to take up their lodgings. The duke
had about him his counsel and great lords / such as he trusted most the
more honorably to receive these lords. When they entered in to the town of
Wa^nes they had good chere / and lords and knights of the dukes met them /
and specially the lord de la Wall. there they a lyghted at their lodgings and
refresshed them self / and after mounted on their horses and rode to the dukes
castle called la Mote / where they found the duke who came against them / and
received the^ right ioyously and said: How they were all right hertely welcome
/ and took the lord of Coucy by the hand / and made him good chere and said.
Fair brother ye be welcome / I am glad to se you in Bretayne. I shall show
you sport of huntyng at hearts and flyeng with hawks or we deperte a so^dre.
Sir quod the lord of Coucy I thank you / I and my company shall be glad to
se it. There was showed between them great lykelyhode of love: and the duke
brought him to his chamber / sportyng and talkyng of many ydell matters / as
lords do often times when they mete / and have not seen toguyder long before
/ they will find many sondrie pastymes. and specially I knew four lords the
best entertayners of all other that ever I knew / That was the duke of Brabant
/ the earl of Foiz / the earl of Sauoy / and in especial the lord of Coucy:
For according to mine advise in all goodly pastymes he was a sovereign master
^ which brute he bare among all lords and ladies / in France / in England
/ in Almaygne in Lombardy / and in all places where as he had been conversant
And in his time he had been sore traueyled and seen much in the world: and
also he was naturally enclyned to be gentle. and thus while these lords were
merry talking toguyder / there was brought spyces and wine and so they drank /
and than took their leaves and returned to their lodgings. Thus the matter
went for the ye first day / without making of any mencyon of any thing that
they were come for.

Now let us somewhat speak of sir Helyon of Lygnacke / whom the duke of Berrey
had sent to the duke of Lancastre. The knight came to Bayon and a lyghted at
his lodging / and apparelled himself to go and speak with the duke of
Lancaster / who knew well of his coming / and sent right honorably two of
his knights to mete with him / and they brought him to the duke. And when sir
Helyon was in the dukes presens he kneled down / and saluted him as it
aperteyned. The duke received him right honorably and took him up in his arms
/ and took him by ye hand and led him in to his chamber / for he met him
in the hall. Thanne the knight delivered his letters fro the duke of Berry. The
duke reed them and thanne he drew to sir Helyon / and the knight declared to
him the cause of his coming. Than the duke answered right courtesly and said.
Sir / ye be right welcome / and said how the matter was weyghtie that he was
come for / wherefore it required counsel and delyberacion. Thus sir Helyon
tarried at Bayon with the duke of Lancastre more than a month / and always he
was served with fair words: And the duke always foded him forth and made
semblant that he had great affection to treat for this marriage with the duke
of Berrey / How be it the truth was contrary / for all that he showed was
but dissymulacion. and the cause that he was held there so long with him / was
for none other thing / but that the brute thereof might run abroad / and
specially in to ye realm of Castyle / for there lay all his affection: The
duke said to sir Helyon. Sir / if I treat with the duke of Berrey to have my
daughter in marriage / than^e he must join with me with all his puysau^ce to
encounter mine adversaries of Spain / If he will recover the heritage of my
daughter / whom he should have to wife: Than sir Helyon said. Sir / I have no
charge to confyrme any thing so forward. But sir / if it please you or I
deperte / ye may write all your pleasure by me / and I shall return and show
my lord the duke of Berrey all your intent: And I am sure (he has such
affection to the matter) he will agree to every thing that he may do by reason.
I desire no more quod the duke of Lancastre. Thus sir Helyon of Lygnacke tarried
a season at Bayon / and had good chere made him by the dukes commandment.

How the king of Castyle sent his ambassadors to the duke of Lancaster to
treat for a marriage / to be had between his son and the dukes daughter / and
how at the request of the duke of Berrey a truse was made by the duke of
Lancastre in the countries of Tholousyn and Rouergne. Cap. C.xxix.
TIdinges came in to the realm of Castyle in to diverse places / and specially
to king Johan of Castyle / and it was said to him. Sir / ye know nothing of
the treatye that is between the duke of Berrey and the duke of Lancastre The
duke of Berrey would have in marriage the lady Katheryne / daughter to the duke
of Lancastre and to the lady Custance his wife. And if this marriage take
effect (as it is like to do) it shall be a great alyaunce: For the duke of
Berrey is now / as one of the chief rulers in the realm of France / and is
uncle to the king. He shall be believed what soever he say or purpose to do (as
it is reason) wheder is be by means of peace or long truse / On the other
part / the duke of Lancastre is eldest of all his brethren / that be uncles
to the king. He shall also be believed / for he is sage and puyssau^t: and by
that it seems the Englysshmen are weary of the war. This marriage between the
Duke of Lancasters daughter and the duke of Berrey / is lykely to be a great
mean to make a good peace between France and England / and than shall we here
stick still in the war / for the duke of Lancaster will follow and pursue
his challenge of the realm of Castyle / and the right yt he has by his wife he
shall give it to his daughter / and so than shall we have war both with
France and England. These doutes were laid to the king of Castyle. And at
that time all the Frenchmen that had served long in the realm of Castyle were
returned in to France: and the chief of the king of Castyls counsel said
to him. sir take heed to us. ye never had so great need of good counsel / as
ye have at this present time. For sir / a peryllousmyst is like to be
engendered between you and the duke of Lancaster / and that shall come by the
means of France. How so quod the king / how may that be? In the name of god
sir quod they / the brute and renome spredeth through all this country / and
else where / how the duke of Berrey shall mary the duke of La^casters daughter.
And sir / ye may be sure that shall not be / but by the means of a great
alyau^ce: so that thereby here after / ye may be as far cast behind by them
/ as ye have been auaunced. When the king of Castyle knew those tidings he was
right pensive / and saw well how his counsel showed him the truth Than he
demanded rounsayle of them that he trusted best / how he should perceuer and
deal in all his business / and they counsayled him well and truly / as the
matter required: as I shall show you.

YE know well (as ye have herd before in this history) How king Henry of
Spaygne made a peace / with Peter king of Arragone / on the full poyntment
that the king of Arragon should give his daughter in marriage to the king of
Castyle. This was Johan who is now king: and by this conjunction of marriage /
they were i^ peace and their realms. Of this Johan son to Henry / and of the
daughter of Arragon there came a son. Than dyed the lady: and after the death
of king Henry of Castyle / this king Johan by the counsel of his men married
again the lady Beatrice daughter to Fernando king of Portugale / and they
had a son called Henry / he was but young. Than the counsel of Castyle
said to the king. Sir / we se in all these doutes but one remedy. What is that
quod king Johan? Sir we shall show you quod they your young son Henry may
well break this marriage / between the duke of Berrey and the duke of Lancasters
daughter / for it is to be believed / that the duke of Lancaster and the duches
his wife / had rather merchant with you and with your son than with the duke
of Berrey. In the name of god quod the king ye say well / I shall harken to
this matter / I think our people will lightly enclyne thereunto: by that marriage
we should have peace with England ^ both by land and by water. Therefore sirs
/ those out them that were mete to go in our name to treat on this matter with
the duke of Lancastre. Sir quod they / it is requisyte that they be discrete
persons / and that the matter be wisely handeled / and in the secretest manner
that may be: to the entente that ye run not in the indignacyon of the
French king. For now a days envy rayneth greatly / and sooner report is
made of yuell than of good / and the yuell sooner raised up than the good. For
if they of France know that ye treat with the duke of Lancaster / the
French king and his counsel will demand whereupon ye treat with the duke
/ by reasone of the great alyaunce made in time past / between your father and
France. And also the French men have always sustained your war. Wherefore
sir ^ your treaties must be done secretly / and send to the duke sage men and
secret / and well enstructed of your business: And send not forthewith boost
and pride / till every thing be in a sure case. It is true quod the king /
name them that be mete to go on that voyage. Sir quod they send your
confessor friar Ferna^do of Far and the bishop of Geghene / who was
sometime confessor to the king your father / and Peter Gardelopes / who is
well languaged. I am content quod the king / let them be sent for / and
well enfourmed what they shall say / they would or this time have treated for a
peace but we would natte here them. For the duke of Lancastre would none other
wise but that I should have forsaken the Crown of Castyle / the which I will
never do. Than these three were sent for to Burgus in Spain where the king was
Than it was said to them by the king and his priu^e counsel. Sirs / ye must
go to Bayon to the duke of Lancastre and showed them all their instructions.
They said they were ready to accomplysshe the kings comman^dement: And so
set forth on their journey ^ not in no great estate but symply / for they
would not be known that they went to the duke of Lancaster / as ambassadors
to treat for any alyaunce for they knew not how to speed. Thus they entered
in to Nauerre and came to Pampylona / and there found the king and the queen.
First they came thither because the queen was suster to the king of Castyle.
There they had good chere / but they nouther showed the king nor the queen
where about they went: And so passed thorough the country by the mountayns of
Roseaulx and entered in to Bisquay / and so rode till they came to Bayon.

WHan^e they were come to the town of Bayon / sir Helyon of Lignacke was still
there / who was sent fro the duke of Berrey (as ye have herd here before) But
after the coming of the castilyans they tarried not long after / for friar
don Fernando the king of Castyls confessor came to the duke of Lancastre /
for he knew him better than any of the other. He began somewhat to break the
matter / and to show the cause of their coming. The duke opyned his eats to
his words / and was glad to here those tidings / and said. Friar Fernando
ye be welcome. And the same day sir Helyon of Lignacke was delivered. And as I
understood / the duke accorded the same time to a truse on all parts. for such
as made war for him in Acquitayne / Bygore / Thoulous / and other place / to
endure unto to the first day of May / in the year of our lord god a
thousand three hundred fourscore and nine. this truse to continue all the
country to the river of Loyre / and no further. This truese was concluded at
the request of the duke of Berrey / to the intent that he might send in and
out to the duke of Lancastre. For before they of the fortresses of Mortaygne on
ye see / of Bonteuyll / of Rouuergue / of Quercyn / of Pyergourt / and they on
the river of Garon / were people without mercy / they would know no man /
wherefore these two dukes accorded to this truese / the which was well kept.
When sir Helyon of Lignacke departed fro ye duke there was great love showed /
for the duke said how the matter pleased him right well: How be it the duke
said plainly he would never marry his daughter in to France / without the
consent and accord of the king of England his nephue. And also by the
agreement of the counsel of England but he said / he trusted so to order the
matter / that all should do well. Thus sir Helyon of Lignacke departed and
returned in to France / and showed the duke of Berrey his letters that the
duke of Lancastre had sent him / and showed him by mouth all the manner / how
every thing went / and so ye duke was well content. Now let us speak of the
king of Castyls ambassadors / to whom the duke of Lancaster gave good ear
and so did the duches / for all their hertes and ymaginacions lay ever on their
challenge of Spayn.

THe duke made these ambassadors good chere / they came before the duke and
the duchess / and there showed their message. first they treted for peace /
and there the friar preached in the dukes chamber / the duchess present: And
she showed the duke the intent of all his words / for ye duke understood him
not parfitely: The lady understood him well / for in her youth she was brought
up in Spaygne. The duke for all that the matter of their coming was pleasant
to him / yet he discovered not to hastily his entente / but said. Sirs / it
will be very hard to make peace in that place / where as great hatered and
war is resydent / and specially with them that be disheryted and kept from
their heritage: Saying / how he would not leave the war without he might
have the crown of Castyle / the which he said was his right: The friar and
the bisshoppe said. Sir / between your right and ye right of the king our
lord there is but one mean / and we have found it / if it may please you.
What way is that quod the duke? Sir quod they it is this. ye have by my lady
your wife a feyre young lady to marry / and the king of castile our sovereign
lord has a feyre young son / if they two might mary toguyder the realm of
Castyle should be in peace / and all that is your right should return to you.
and sir / better can ye not bestow your heir who is disce^ded of the right
line of Castyle. The intent ye arm you (fight / adventure your self / and
traueyle your body) is all only for the right of your heir. That is true
quod the duke / but than I will that the costs yt I have sustained in the
pursuit there be recompe^sed. For I will ye know it has cost me and the
realm of England / five hundred thousand fra^kes / whereof I would gladly se
some recouerau^ce. Sir quod the friar / if our treaty be agreeable to you / we
trust to find such a mean that the matter shall take good effect Well quod the
duke ye be welcome / and how soever it be or how soever it shall be / or I
return in to England (outher in to Castyle or in to France) I shall mary my
daughter for I have diverse offres moved unto me / but matters of so great a
weight are not lightly concluded / at the first time. For my daughter whom I
repute (as rightful enheritour to spain) I will know him well yt shall have
her in marriage. that is but reason quod the friar. Thus as I have showed you
this treaty began / between the duke of Lancaster and these parties / as well
of Castyle as of France. He made every party good chere / and made no full
answer: but in his ymaginacion the treaty of Spain (the kings son to mary
his daughter) seemed best to his purpose / because in time to come his daughter
should be queen of Castyle. also the duches his wife enclyned most to that
treaty. Now let us leave to speak of the duke of Lancastre and of all these
treatise / and return to speak of the duke of Bretaygne.

How the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne departed to go to Bloys and how the
duke of Bretayne ca^ethyder / and how the dukes did so much that they had
him to Paris in manner against his will. Cap. C.xxx.
AS I have showed you here before / ye duke of Bretayne made good chere to the
French ambassadors and specially to the lord of Coucy. For as I was informed
/ he was ye chief that brake the duke fro his purpose / by reason of his fair
and sweet words: How be it the lord Johan of Vyen and the lord dela River
did right well their deuoyre. but often times great princes and lords will
sooner be entreated by one man / rather than by another. Much pain it was to
cause the duke of Bretayne to agree to go to the town of Bloys / to mete there
the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne / but he was brought thither by fair
words: And he said / surely he would go no further thanne to the town of
Bloys / and the lord of Couey said he desired nothing else. These the lords
were with the duke of Bretaynge certain days / and than took their leaves and
returned in to France / and showed the dukes of Berry and of Burgoyne how
they had spedde. Thereupon these two dukes made them ready to go to Bloyes to
mete there with the duke of Bretaygne / and sent thither before to make
prouisyon / as apertayned. First thither came the duke of Berrey and he was
lodged in the Castle / and there he found the countess / her son / and her
daughter. They received him honorably. The earl Guye of Bloys was as than in
his own country at the castle Reygnaulte / and made no great count of the
coming of the duke of Bretaygne / he thought it sufficyent that his wife and
children were there. Than thither came the duke of Burgoyne with a goodly train
and in his company came sir Wyllm^ of Heynaulte and his son earl of
Ostrenante / and Johan of Burgoyne son to the duke called earl of Neuers. The
duke lodged also in the castle / and there held his estate. Than after came
the duke of Bretaygne with no great train / other than of his house: He passed
not a three hundred horses / for his ente^cyon was / that when he had ones seen
the two dukes and spoken with them / to return in to his own country /
without going any further in to France / But the entente of the other two
dukes was otherwise: for they said whyder he would or not / he should go to
Paris.

THe duke of Bretaygne him self lodged in the castle of Bloyes / in a chanons
house of saint Savior: and his men lodged down in the town / and so did ye
other of all the dukes servants: but the lords lay in ye castle the which
was fair great / and strong / one of the fairest castelles in all the realm
of France. There these Dukes made good there together and showed great (...)
and they thanked the duke of Bretayne of his coming to the town of Bloyes:
And the duke answered and said / how he was come thither for the love of them
with great pain (for he feigned him self not well at ease) Than these two
dukes fell in communynge with the duke of Bretayne / showing him sith he was
come so far forward that he had done nothing without he went to Paris to se
the king / who greatly desired to se him. The duke of Bretaygne began greatly
to excuse him self of that voyage / and laid many reasons / and said how he
was not well at his case to make so long a journey / nor also he was not
accompanied thereafter. Than he was swetely answered that saving his displeasure
/ he should need no great train to go se his soueraygne lord / and as for his
rydinge / he should lack nouther chair nor lytter to labor at his ease / For
they said he was bound to do homage to the king / for as than he had not done
it before. The duke said (excusing himself) that when the king were come to
his laufull age / and had the hole Realm in his own governance / than he
would come to Paris (or whyder to should please the king) and than do his
homage acordyng to reason: The other dukes said / that the king was of age and
wisdom suffycient to receive homage: and how that all other lords of the
realm except he / had done their homage and made relief / affyrmynge how
the king was.xxi. year of age. When the duke of Bretaygne saw how his
excuses could not be taken nor herd (said) Well sirs / if I go to Paris it
shall be greatly against my will / and to my preiudyce: For when I come there /
I shall find and se daily before me sir Olyuer of Clyssone / whom I can not
love nor never did / nor he me (who shall attempt me with rygorous words) My
lords / regard well what inconuenyentes shall ensue of my going thither. Sir
quod the duke of Burgoyne / fair cosyn have ye no dout therein for we shall
swear solempnely to you / that without it shall be your own pleasure / ye
shall nouther se nor speak with the Constable nor with Johan of Mountforde / as
long as ye shall be there. Of this sir ye shall be sure / but ye shall se the
king who desires to se you / and other lords / knights / and squyers of
France / who shall make you good chere. And when ye have done that ye look
for / ye shall return again without peril or dommage (Whereto should I make
long process) So much the duke of Bretayne was desired with fair words
that he consented to go to Paris / on the promise that the Constable nor Johan
of Mountforde should not come in his presence / the which the dukes swear
faithfully to uphold / and thereupon he promised to go to Paris. A five days
these dukes were at Bloyes / and each of them feested other right nobly / and
the countess and her children in like manner. And when every thing was
accomplysshed / the two dukes took leave of ye duke of Bretaygne and returned
to Paris: But sir Wylliam of Heynaulte returned not to Paris with the duke of
Burgoyne his fair father: but rode first with the countess of Bloyes who made
him right good chere / and tarried there a three days / and than took his leave
and returned in to France / by the Castle Dune and Bonyuall.

How Jews king of Cycyle entered in to Paris in estate royal / and how the
duke of Bretayne entered on the night of saint John^ the Baptyst: The year of
grace / a thousand three hundred fourscore and seuyn. and of a deed of arms
done before the king at Mountereau fault you / between a knight of England
called sir Thom^s Harpingham / and a french knight named sir John^ de Bars.
Cap. C.xxxi.
THe duke of Bretaygne rode to Boygency on the river of Loyre / and there he
ordered his business to go to Paris. The same time before ye duke of Bretaygne
entered in to Paris / there entered the queen of Cycyll and of Jerusalem /
sometime wife to the Duke of Aniou / who was called king of those countries /
and also of Naples / and with her was her young son Jews / who was as thanne
(in all France) named king of all the said lands. And in their company was
Johan of Bretaygne brother to the lady. She sent word before of her coming
to the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne / aduertysyng the^ / how she brought in
her company her young son Jews their nephue / desyring to know whether he
should enter into Paris as a king / or else symply as Jews of Aniou. The two
dukes sent her word (aduisynge and cou^sayling her) that he should enter as
king of Naples / of Cycyle / and of Jerusalem. And sent her word / that
though he were not as thanne in possessyon of the Realms / yet they would
entyse the French king that he should aid him to conquer them / for so they
swear to do to their brother king Lois. After this manner the lady prepared for
her self / and came and entered in to Paris / and made her son to ride
through the high streets by saint Jacques / so to his lodging in grene in
estate royal / accompanied with Dukes / earls / and prelates a great nombre.
There the lady tarried with her son / and thanne went to se the king at his
castle of Loure / abydinge there the coming of the duke of Bretaygne.

How the duke of Bretaygne entered in to Paris / and came to the castle of
Loure to the French king. Cap. C.xxxii.
When the duke of Bretayne aproched nere to Paris / he rested one night at the
queen's Bourge / and the next day he entered in to Paris. great lokyng for him
was in Paris / because he had before put in danger the Constable of France
/ and had been sent for diverse times and would never come till than. Men spoke
thereof dyuersly / and on a sunday being Mydsomer day at ten of the clock
before noone / the duke of Bretaygne entered / the year of our lord god a
thousand three hundred fourscore and eight in to Paris / at hell gate / and
passed a long the street of ye Harp / and over the bridge saint Michell / and
so before the palais well accompanied with lords and knights. There was sir
Wyllyam of Heynaulre earl of Ostrenaunt / and his fair brother Johan of
Burgoyne / and before him roode sir Wyllyam of Namure. Thus he came to the
Castelle of Loure / and there alyghted / as he rode through the streets / he
was greatelye regarded of the common people / And when the duke was a lyghted
and entered in at the gate / he remembered what he should do and say. And before
him was the lord of Coucy / the earl of Sauoy / sir John^ of Vyen / sir Guye
de la Tremoyle. sir John^ of Vernayle / the earl of Meauir / sir Johan of Voye
/ sir Johan of Bars / and nere to him was sir Wyllyam of Namure / Johan of
Burgoyne / and the earl of Ostrenaunte. And behind him the lord Mountforde of
Bretayne and the lord of Malestroyt / they were of his kynne and privy
counsel. there was great preace to se him and the halle but little / and the
boordes were covered for the king to go to dinner. And the king stood there
ready before the table and his.iii. uncles beside him / dukes of Berrey / of
Burgoyne and of Burbone. As soon as the duke was entered every man made place /
so that ye duke might se the king. First he made one curtesy and so passed
forth a run or.xii. paces Than he made the second curtesy and rose again /
and so passed forth till he came before the king: Than the third time he
kneled down bare heeded and saluted the king and said. Sir / I am come to se
your grace / god maynteyne your prosperyte. I thank you sir quod the king /
and we have great desire to se you: We shall se and speak with you at more
leysar / and therewith took him up by the arms. Than the duke enclyned him self
to all the other princes each after other. than he stood still before the king
without speaking of any word. The king sore beheld him. Thanne the Stewardes
and officers came forth with water and ye king washed and the duke of
Bretaygne put his hand to the basin and to the towell. And when the king was
set the duke took his leave of the king and of his uncles. and the lord of
Coucy and the earl of saint Poule with other lords conveyed him in to the
court where his horses were. and there mounted and so returned to his lodging
in the street of yt Harp / and none tarried with him of them that conveyed him
/ but such as came with him out of Bretaygne to Paris.

AFter all this the duke of Bretaygne spoke at leysar with the king and his
uncles / so that every man was well content with him / and he took well every
thing that had been promised to him / for he saw nouther the constable nor
John^ of Bretayne. When ye lords saw that every thing was in good state / and
that they neded not to doubt the duke of Bretaygne / seeing they had him at
Paris (for they thought he should not depart thens till he had done in manner /
every thing as the king would) than it was thought good time to ordeyne forth
for the voyage in to Guerles (whyder the king had great affection to go) to
subdue the duke of Guerles / who had so shamfully defied the king (the which
co^sydred) was not thought good to be suffered. Than it was ordained / that the
lord of Coucy should draw to the marches of Rennes and Chalous in Champayn /
and to regard for the kings passage that way / and to move the knights and
squyers in Bare and in Lorayne to go with him / whyder he would led them / not
speaking of the king / but bearyng them in hand that he would go to recover
his right in Austryche. The lord of Coucy thus departed fro Paris / and went
to Chalous in Champayne / and there tarried a month and retaygned on all parts
knights and squyers i^ Bare and in Lorayne / in Champaygne / and in Retheloys.
And the French king departed fro Paris when he had co^muned with the duke of
Bretaygne of diverse matters (and not fully accomplysshed) For the suit in the
court of France is long when they list / and right well they can food
forth the people to make them spend much / and bring little to effect.
The king came to Moustreau on fault you / in the marchesse of Brie and
Gastenoys / and there he held his court / and of ten times chased hearts and
other wild beestes in the forest of Brie. The same seasone there was a deed of
arms done there / bitwene an Englisshe knight who was there with the duke of
Irelande / called sir Thom^s Harpyngham / and sir Johan of Bars / whereof
great brute was made in France and other places. Their challenge was / five
courses with a spear / five strokes with the sword / five with a daggar / and
five with the axe: and if any of their weapons brake than they to get new /
till their challenge were acco^plysshed. These two knights on a day lept on
their horses well armed / as appertayned (The king and all other lords being
present and much people) and ran toguyder four courses right valiauntly
(and as me thought the usage was than^e / their Helmes were tied but with a
lace / to the entente the spear should take no hold). the first course sir
Johan of Bars struck the English knight on the targe / in such wise / that
he bare him over the horse crope / so that he lay stonyed on the ground / and
much pain to releue. Than they performed forth all the rest of their
challenge / in so goodly manner / that the king and all the other were well
content with them.

How the earl of Arundell being on the sea more than a month came to the
hauyn of Marante / a little fro Rochell: And how he sent a messa^gere to
Perotte le Bernoys / that he and other capitayns should keep the feldes. Cap.
C.xxxiii.
IT is long sithe I made any mencyon of the English army on the sea / whereof
Richard Earl of Arundell was captain / and with him many knights / squyers /
and archers of England. I shall now somewhat speak of him / for the matter
requires it.

yE have herd here before of the treaty that the king of England made with
the duke of Bretaygne. This navy on the sea all this season / lay ever
coostynge the fronters of Bretaygne and Normandy / if ioynde and wether drove
the^ thens / they ever came thither again. And they had in their flete some
small vessels called Balyngers / who went ever and scoured the sea The flete
had layne at ancre more than a month against the ysle of Breshatte in
Bretayne. And there they herd tidings / how the duke of Bretaygne was gone
to Bloyes to speak with the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne / And how they
were so agreed / that the duke was gone to Paris. And the renoeranne through
Bretaygne / how the duke had good chere of the French king / and was
welcome to him and to all his cousayle at Paris / and should not depart thens
till the matters were in good estate. When the earl of Aru^dell herd those
tidings he was pensive: and went to counsel what was best to do / and
whyder they were best to draw to enploye their season. Than they determined to
draw to Rochellois though they had no castelles there / yet they had men
ynowe there to keep the Field / and to abide all the puyssaunce of Xaynton and
of Poyctou / so that they should signify their estate in to Auuergne and in to
Lymosynne / so that they might send to pass through Bretaygne. As than the
treuse was not confyrmed on the river of Loyre: but they were a treating to
begin the first day of Auguste. And sir Helyon of Lignacke was going or
coming (as the earl of Arundell ymagined) outher to the duke of Lancastre to
Bayone / or else retournynge in to France. They had in their nauye a Breton
bretonaunt of the nacyon of Wannes / servant to sir Wyllyam Helmon / who could
speak well four manner of languages / That is to say / Bretysshe / English /
Spaynysshe / and French: and gave him in commandment to go a land and said
to him. Go thou the most preuyest ways thou canste (thou know all the
preuy ways of the country) and get the to the garyson of Chaluset / and
have us all recommaunded to Perotte le Bernoys / and show him fro us / that he
set forth a company of men of arms / such as be in garysons forth king
of England / and make war in his tytell / you shalt bear no letters for
fear of taking. Thou may go like a merchant of Rochell to by wynes: and
say to Perot that he reyse up these men of war and keep the countries of
Berrey / Auuergne / and Lymosyn in doubt / and keep the feldes / for we shall
land in Rocelloyes / and shall make there such war / that it shall be herd
of and well known. The Breton said he should do his message / if he had no
great let by the way. He was set a land on the sands / and (as he that
knew all the country of Bretayne) went of from all the great towns / and
passed by the country of Poyctou and entered in to Lymosyn / and so came to
Chalucet / whereof Perot le Bernoys was captain. The messangere came to the
barryers / and gave knowledge of his coming to them of the garyson. After he
had been examyned at the gate he was let in / and so brought before Perotte /
and did well his message / whereof Perot had great joy / For he greatly
desired to here tidings of the army on the sea. Than he said to the Breton /
thou art welcome: Both I and all my companions have great desire to ride
forth abroad / and so shall we do / and accomplysshe that thou have showed us.

THus Perotte le Bernoys made him pressed and sent to Carlate to the Bourge of
Champaygne / to the captain of Ousacke / Olyue Barbe / and to the capitayn of
Aloyse beside saint Flower / Aymergotte Marcell / and to other capitayns a
long the country in Auuergne an Lymosyn. oesyryng all these to make the^ ready
/ for he would ride out abroad / for he saw it than a good season for them.
co^maundynge them to leave sure men in their garrisons till their return. These
companyons who had as great desire to ride abroad as Perot (for they could
not ware rich without some other lost) made the^ ready and came to Chalucet /
where they assembled. They were well to the nombre of four hundred spears /
they thought themself suffycient to do a great feate. they knew no lord in
the country as than able to resyste them / nor to break their enterprice. for
the siege of Vandachore of sir Wyllyam of Lignacke nor of Boesme Lau^ce / was
not defeated as than. Thus they rode forth and were lords of the feldes and
passed Auuergne on the right hand / and took the right way to Berrey: for
they knew well ye duke was not as than there / but was in France with the
king at Mou^tereau or fault you. Now let us leave to speak of Perot le
Bernoys and of his enterprice / and speak of the earl of Arundell and of his
army on the sea / and show how he perceuered after he was departed fro the
cost of Bretayne.

When the earl of Arundell and such lords as were with him were departed fro
the cost of Bretayne / they sailed with good wynd and wether / for ye time was
fair and pleasunt / and goodly to behold ye ships on ye see. They were a
sixscore one and other / with baners and stremers wauynge in the wind /
glytrynge with the lords arms against the son. Thus they went saylyng by
the sea fresshly (like a horse new coming out of the stable brayeng and
cryeng / and fomyng at the mouth) The sea was so prompt and so agreeable to the^
/ as though by figure the sea should have said to them. be merry sirs I am for
you / and I shall bring you to good port and haven without peril. Thus these
lords sailed frontyng Poyctou and Xaynton and cast ancre before Rochell / in
ye haven toward Marant. Than some of their company seeing the fludde coming /
entered or it were full water in to bottes mo than two hundred one and other /
and arrived nere to the town of Marant. The watch of Marant had spied the
English flete / and saw how the bottes were coming to land ward with the
fludde. Than he blewe his tru^pe and made great noise / to awake the men of the
town to save them self / so that many men and women took their goods and
went and saved them in the Castle / the which came well to pass for them /
or else they had lost all. When they saw the Englysshmen come at their he lys /
they took that they had and left the rest / and saved their bodies. The
English archers and other entered in to the town / and fell to pyllage
(therefore they came thither) but little they found there / saving coffers void
and emptye / all their goods was withdrawn in to the Castle. As for Corn /
wine / salt becone / and other provision they found enough / for there was
more than four hundred tonne of wine in the town. Wherefore they determined to
abide there a certain space to keep that prouisyon. It came well to pass for
them / for they said if they should depart thens / all should be withdrawn
in to the fortresses / and carried away by the river to Fountney / as much as
they might / and the rest distroyed. They tarried all that night in the town.
They came thither in the euenyng / and sent word to them on the sea what case
they were in / and the cause why they tarried. The earl of Arundell and the
other lords said / how they had done well. This night passed. The next
morning when the tide began to return / they disancred all their small
vessels / and every man went in to them / and put all their harness in to
bottes and barges / and lafte their great ships still at ancre / for they
could not cum nere to the land for lack of water. and they last an hundred
men of arms and two hundred archers still there to keep their ships which
lay at the mouth of the hauyn. tha^ with their small vessels they arrived
at Marant / and took land at their leysar / and so lodged all between Marant
and ye town of Rochell / the which was but four leages fro thens. Tidings
spredde abroad in the country / how the English men were arrived at Barante
/ a four hundred fightyng men: the plain country / the good towns and
castelles were a srayde and made good watch. Than they of the vyllages fled
amaye / and carried their goods in to Forestes and in to other places / as
shortly as they might.

How they of Marroys and Rochellois were sore afraid of the Englysshmen that
were a land / and how they of Rochell made a serimysshe with them / and how
after the Englysshmen had pylled the country about Marant / they drew again
to the sea with their pyllage which was great. Cap. C.xxxiiii.
IF the Englysshmen had been furnysshed with horses it had been greatly to their
profit / for ye country as than was vnpro^^ded of men of war / namely of
such as were able to have merre with them. True it was / the lord of Parteney
/ the lord of Pons / the lord of Lymers / yt lord of Tanyboton / sir Geffray
of Argenton / the lord of Montendre / sir Aymery of Roch chouart / the vycont
of to wars / and diverse other knights and squyers of Poictou and of Xaynton /
were as than in the country: but they were not toguyder / for every man was in
his own fortress / for they were not ware of the English men's coming
thither. If they had known a month before that the English men would
have ryued there / they would have provided therefore / but they knew it not.
This fell suddenly / wherefore they were the more afraid and every man took
head to keep his own / and the men of the country to get in their corns /
for it was about the beginning of Auguste. Also there was no heed Capitaygne
in the country to bring men toguyder. The duke of Berrey who was chief
soueraygne of Poittou / was but newely gone to Paris. The seneschall of Xaynton
was not in the country: And the Seneschall of Rochell sir Helyon of Lignacke
was not at Rochell / nor in the country / He was in great business to ride in
and out between ye duke of Berrey and the duke of Lancastre. By these reasons
the country was the more feeble / for where there is defaulte of good heedes /
there must needs be defaulte in the body and in the foot: And he that has no
foot can do nothing that is worth. Thus these lords were in fear two
ways. They had the Englysshmen armed before them that came fro the sea: And on
the other side they herd news fro Berrey and fro Limosyn / that Perot le
Bernoys rode abroad with five or six hundred fighting men with him / and was
entered in to Berrey. So they wist not where to they should take heed / but every
manne to keep his own. For the renome went / how these two hoostes should
mete toguyder / outher in the country of Poictou or Xaynton. This was the
opinyon of diverse.

TRue it was / that in the town of Rochell / the same season that the
English men were landed at Marant there was two valya^t knights / the one
called sir Peter of Iouy / and the other sir Taylle Pie / whom sir Helyon of
Lignacke had left at Rochell to keep the town and country therabout. When
tidings came to Rochell how the earl of Arundell and the army that had been so
long on the sea were a land and lodged beside Marant. Than these two knights
said to the^ that were under their charge (and to the mayre of Rochell and men
of the town) sirs it must behoue us to go and look on these English men.
It is showed us how they be arrived in these parties. I and my companion will
go and give them there welcome / for the which they shall pay us / or else we
them: For we shall be blamed if we suffer them to rest in peace / sithe we have
the charge of the keeping of this country. there is one point good for us /
they have no horses: They are men of the sea / and we be well mounted: We shall
send our crosbowes be fore / they shall wake them / and shote and hurt them /
and when they have done they shall return. Than the English men will issue
out after them a foot / and we shall suffer our crosbowes to pass homwarde /
and than we shall receive our enemies at the spear point We shall have of them
such aduau^tage / that we shall do them great damage. Every man that herd
these knights speak / reputed the^ for noble valiant men / and agreed to
their counsel: And there assembled toguyder / what one and other a twelve
hundred. The next morning at the breakyng of the day / every man was ready
and assembled togider. and the crosbowes and men a foot issued out and went a
great pace to reyse the Englysshmen out of their lodgings. and in the mean
season the horsemen made them ready upon a.iii. hundred / for there were diverse
knights and squyers come to Rochell. Certainly / if by any manner inspyracion
thenglysshmen had known of their coming / that they might have made an
embusshe (but of two hundred archers and a hundred men of arms) there had not
one Frenchman returned again. Wha^ they of Rochell came to the English men's
lodgings / it was carely in the morenynge / and their watch was returned to
their lodgings. Than the French crosbowes began to shote and entered in among
their lodgings / and hurt many. The English men lyeng on the straw had
marueyle of the noise / and many were hurt or they knew that they were
French men. And when the crosbowes had shot every man a six shottes / or
there about / they returned (as it was before appointed). Than aproched the
horsemen and entered among the lodgings / therewith the host began to stir /
and knights and squyers drew toguyder in to the field. And when the French
men saw the host stir and draw toguyder / they drew back and returned
toward Rochell a good pace / for fear of the shot of English men / who
followed them nere to Rochell. Than the Earl of Arundell with four hundred men
of arms followed after a great pace / every man his spear in his hand or on
his neck. The preace of the French fotemen was great at the entering in to
Rochell / and always the two French knights were behind / and set their
men forward till they were within the barriers: and ever the English men
followed / in such wise / that ye two French knights were in great danger to
be taken or slain They were sore set at / because they seemed to be the chief
capitaynes (as they were in deed) so that sir Peter Iouy had his horse slain
under him / and with great pain his men saved him / and drew him within the
barryers. And sir Peter Taylle Pie was stryken through the thye with a glayue /
and with an arrowe through ye bassenet in to the heed / and his horse fell
down deed within ye gate. At the entering in to the town there were many
slain and hurt / mo than.xl. the men of the town were above over the gate
and cast down stones and shot out bombardes / so that the English men
durst aproche no nerer.

Thus went the first scrimysshe between them of Rochell and the English men
/ and when they had scrimysshed nere to noone / The earl of Arundell sowned
the retrayte: Than they withdrewe in good order / and returned to their
lodgings and unarmed them and took their ease / and they had well whereof. they
lacked nouther wine nor flesh. The English men tarried there about a fyftene
days / abydinge all adventures. But after that / they of Rochell issued no
more out to scrmysshe / for they saw well the Englisshe men were wise and
valiant / and also ye two capitayns were hurt / wherefore the other had good
cause to sytte still in rest. The Earl of Arundell sent a three or four times
abroad in to the country of Rochelloys toward Bresmure / and in to the land
of Towars / and did great do^mage / whereof all the country was a frayde. The
Englysshmen had done a great enterprice if they had been furnysshed with horsemen
/ and in the country they gatte but sewe: for as soon as they herd of their
landynge / every man carried all that they had in to the fortresses. And when
this army had tarried there a fyftene days / and were well refresshed / and
saw that no man came against them and parceyued the wind good for the^ / they
drew them in to their ships / and carried with them much wine and fresshe
flesh and so entered in to their vessels / and drew up their sails and
took the sea: and the same day they met with.xii. ships of Bayon going in
to England / charged with wynes and other marchau^dises: so they joined
toguyder and made good chere. They gave to the earl of Arundell two pieces of
Gascoyn wine. Thus they sailed forth at adventure. Now let us speak of
Perot le Bernois and of the other capitayns that were in his company / how
they drew again in to their fortresses.

How Perot le Bernoys and his co^panyons resorted again to their holds with
great pyllage. and how the duke of Guerles could have no aid of the
English men / to reyse the siege before Grave: and how the brabansoys made a
bridge over the river of Meuse / the which they of Guerles did break / brinne
/ and dystroy: as ye shall here after. Cap. C.xxxv.
THe same seasone that the English army was at Marant / Perot le Bernoyes
and his route / to the no^bre of four hundred speres were abroad and passed by
Lymosyn and came to Berrey. And on a day they took all the merchants that
were in the town of Blake in Berrey / on the which day there was a great
fair / whereby they had great profit and good prisoners / and than passed
further and came to Selles in Berrey / and pylled and robbed the town. Thus
Perot and his companyons rode abroad in the country and did great do^mage /
for there was none that came against them. The country was sore a frayde on
both sides the river of Loyre / unto the cou^tie of Bloys and of Thourayne
They could not ymagin what these two armies were purposed to do / some said
they should mete togider but they did not. for the army on the sea drew again
to the sea / and Perot in likewise to his fortress. Wha^ they had pylled and
won great richesse in the country / every man went to their own fortress
to save that they had got. There was none other deed of arms done that
season in Auuergne and Lymosyn. Than^e began the truce on that side the river
of Loyre the which should endure to the month of March: But still the siege
endured before Vandachore / by sir Wylliam of Lignacke / sir Johan Boesme
Lance / sir Johan Butlere and other. For sir Geffray Teate noyre was so proud
and cruel / that he set nouther by truce nor peace / and all on the trust
of the strength of his fortresses. Now let us leave speaking of the siege of
Vandachore / and show here after what end it took / and speak now of
Brabaunte and of Guerles.

yE know well (as it has been contained here before in this history) the
duchess of Brabant was determined to make war against the duke of guerles /
and caused the siege to co^tynue before the town of Grave / with a great
puyssaunce of knights and squyers / and other men of the good towns of
Brabante: and their entencion was not to depart thens / till they had the
town of Grave at their will. And the duchess to show yt the matter touched
her nere the lay at (...) a four leages thens. The host was plentiful of
every thing. They were often times refresshed with new prouisyon coming fro
diverse parts / as well by see by fresshe water and by the river of Muse as by
the land of Brabant. This siege long endured and they had there great ingyns
be sore the town to cast in great stones / which did great damage. And
beside that to enfecte the people within / they cast in to the town all deed
careyne: and the wether was hot / the which greatly anoyed them within. The
clear air was sore corrupted with the yuell air. Sometime the knights and
squyers of Brabant would come to the barryers and scrimysshe with them of ye
town / and there were many feats of arms done / For there were men in the
town (set there by the duke of Guerles) that were redye to show forth
their prowes when time was. The duke of Guerles lay at Nimay and could not
remedy the matter nor reyse the siege / nor yet fight with his enemies / for he
had no puissaunce thereto / But he had sent in to England certifyeng what
case he stood in / trusting to have had socours fro thens / but he had none /
For at that time there was much trouble in England. For there was set a
new counsel about the king by the means of his uncles and tharchbysshop of
Canterbury About the feast of saint Johan the Baptyst there was a counsel in
England to know if there should be sent any aid of men of arms and archers
to the duke of Guerles or not: But every thing consydred / they thought it best
nay. For renome ran in England how the French king made a great assemble but
no man knew whyther they should draw. The English men by ymaginacyon
douted that they would come to Ca^^^s: On the othersyde they douted the scotts
wherefore they would not send their men of arms and archers out of the realm.
Also they knew how there were many men of war on the sea wherefore it was
co^uenyent to keep their own realm / Therefore the noble men of England said:
Let the duke of Guerles alone he is right valyant and is i^ a strong country
he will do well enough against the brabansoys. Also he shall be conforted by ye
almayns if need be / for they be alyed with him and his neighbors. They have
been with him or this against the French men. Thus the matters went in
England / but they within the town of Grave endured the pain / with sautes
and sore scrimisshing They of Brabante devised while they lay at the siege /
to make a bridge of tymbre over the river of Meuse / thereby to enter in to the
duchy of Guerles: And to over run the country / and to keep that no vitayle
should come to the town of Grave. And thereby to besege it both before and
behind / and on all parts / to keep it fro vitayling / for they had men ynowe
so to do. They set many carpentars a work with all dilygence / and they did
so much that their work was so forward / yt the bridge was nere over the
water within a spears cast. The duke of Guerles had perfect knowledge of the
making of this bridge and did let them alone till it was nyghe made. But
when he saw it was nerehande fynisshed / than he came before it with gonnes
and other artillarye: And shot fire to the bridge / in such wise / that the
bridge was burnt and broken / and the brabansoys lost all their labor /
wherewith they were sore displeased / and than took counsel what was best for
them to do.

How the brabansoys passed the river through the town of Rauesten / over the
bridge there / and so entered in to Guerles. Than the duke departed fro Nimay
with three hundred spears / and came against the^ and disconfyted them between
Rauesten and the town of Grave. Cap C.xxxvi.
A Three little leages fro ye town of Grave is the castle of Rauesten /
parteyninge to the lord of Bourne / who was subject and held of the duchy of
Brabant. He was desired by the duchess counsel and by other lords and
knights / that he should open the town of Rauesten / and suffer their host
to pass through / to enter in to the country of Guerles / And at their
desires he was content. The duke of Guerles lyenge at Nymay was surely
infourmed (by such spyall as he had) how the lord of Bourne would give his
enemies fre passage to enter into his country / through the town of Rauesten
/ whereof he was pensive and male^colyous / for he saw well he had not men
ynowe to resyste the puysaunce of Brabante / for they were well a.xl. thousand
men one and other. On this the duke had many ymagynacions. And finally all
things consydred / he determined in his mind to assemble all his men toguyder
and to take the feldes / and to come toward the town of Grave / to the
entente that if they of Brabant entered in to Guerles / than he would enter in
to Brabant. For he thought surely not to be enclosed within the walls of any
town. Than the duke spoke to the lord of Ghesime / a great baron of Guerles /
who was his princypall counsaylour / and showed him his said mind and entente.
And first this lord was not of the opinion that the duke should take the
feldes with so small a nombre. Well quod the duke / and what shall I do than?
Shall I suffer my self to be enclosed in one of my towns? and in the mean
time they shall brynne and exyle my country. That should be over dear to me to
abide. I make a vow to godde and to our lady quod the duke / I will draw in
to the feldes / and resyst my damage as nere as I may. And as he ordained so he
did. The next morning he departed fro Nymay (after he had been at church / and
made his offrynge to our lady of Nymay) Than he and his men drank a little /
and so mounted on their horses. He was a three hundred spears / rather less
than mo / and took the feldes / and drew toward their enemies the next way.
Behold what a great courage this duke was of. Some said it was a great outrage.
Howbeit he like a coragyous knight full of comeforte said. On on forward in
the name of god and saint George against our enemies / for I had rather dye in
the field with honor / than with dishonor to be closed within a town. With
him was the lord of Ghesime / a valyant and a sage knight / chyefe ruler of
his army / and the lord of Hauseberth / the lord of Huckelin sir Ostez lord
of Vaspre / and diverse other good knights and squyers of valiant courage.

THe same day that the duke of Guerles was in the feldes early in the morning
/ the seneschall of Brabant with his men knights / squyers / and men of the
good towns in Brabant / by the consent of the lord of Bourne / passed the
river by the bridge of Rauesten / to the nombre of ten thousand men. The
seneschall of Brabante / the lord of Lygnier / the lord of Bourguenall / the
lord of Gence and other / were right joyful when they saw they were over
the river of Meuse. They said than among themself / how they would go the
same day and make a course before Nymay / and burn the mylles and fawbours and
the villages there about. but soon after that they herd other tidings by
their fore ryders / such as they had sent to discover the country. Than
tydinges also came to the duke of Guerles / how a ten thousand of his enemies
were passed the river of Meuse / at the bridge of Rauesten. Than the duke stood
in a stay / and took counsel what was best to do. Some were sore abashed
because they were but a handefull of men to the regard of their enemies / who
were thurty or.xl. against one. Some said / how might endure three hundred
spears against ten or twelve thousand men. It lies not in our puyssaunce to
overcome them. But it lies well in their power soon to overcome us. Some
knights came to the duke / and cou^sayled him to draw toward Grave. Thanne
the duke said he would not / for in no wise he would be closed in any town
that he had / but said surely he would go and fight with his enemies / for
his courage he said gave him to dyscomfyte them. and said as he did before /
that rather he would dye with honor / than to live with shame. We shall quod he
this day overcome our enemies / Whereby we shall have great profit and
honor. Therefore all that love me / set forward and follow me quyckly.

THe words that the duke spoke incoraged all his men / and specially such as
herd him / and every man showed semblante to be of great courage to fight.
every man made him ready and lased on his basnet / and gyrte their horses / and
set them self in good array together / and rode forth an easy pass to keep
their horses well brethed. there were certain new knights made. Thus they
rod in good array toward Rauesten. By that time the brabansoys were over the
river. Thanne tidings came to the Seneschall of Brabante / how the duke of
Guerles was in the field / and so nere them that incontinent they should mete
together. Such as herd those tydinges first had marvel of that adventure.
Than they believed surely that for every man that the duke of Guerles had / that
he had been sire. Than they rested to set them self in order / but they had
no leysar. For there with came on them the duke of Guerles with his route close
together / as fast as spurs would drive their horses / cryenge their cries /
our lady of Guerles / with their spears in the restes. There was a squier of
Guerles greatly to be praised / for the great desire that he had to exalte his
renome. he galoped before all the batayls / and was the first that iusted /
and entered in among his enemies. the squier was called Arnolde Morber. With
that course he bare one to the earth rudely / I can not tell if ever he was
releued or not / for the prease was so great / that hard it was / if one were
down to be releued again / without it were by great help. At this first
rencountre there were of the brabansoys a sire score borne to the earth. There
were many beaten down / and small defense made by the Brabansoys / for they
were suddenly taken. and so should men of war do / that think to do damage to
their enemies. For the brabansoys for all that they were so great a nombre /
and so many great men / yet they were so far a sonder / and out of array /
that they could not get together in order of battle / but their battle was
pearsed through and sparkled a broad / some here and some there / so that the
lords of Brabante could not come to their own men / nor their men to
them. And such as were behind / when they herd the noise and brewte / and
saw ye dust and powder rise / it seemed to them properly that the voice of the
dyscomfetture came on them / and how all their company were overcome. So that
the fear thereof caused them to turn and to fly toward Rauesten again /
and some took the river at adventure both a foot and a horseback / without
serrchyng of the depenesse / or without having of any guide. And as they
fled they thought ever their enemies had been at their backs. By this
dyscomfettynge of them self there were drowned and in parell / moo than twelve
hundred in the river of Meuse / for they lepte in one upon a another like
beestes / without order or reason And some of the great lords and barons of
Brabante / whom I will not name / for it should be blame to them and to their
heirs / to be noted to fly away so shame fully / and to seek for their
sauegarde another the right passage of the river / nor yet the high way to the
town of Rauesten / but rather other strange ways to fly fro their enemies.
In this myschyefe fell that day the chyualrye of Brabante / between the town
of Grave and Rauesten many were slain and taken / For such as came to
ransom yielded lightly / and the almayns were glad to take them / for the
profit that they thought to have by them. And such as returned to the
lodgings before Grave abashed them that were there lyenge at the syege / for
they came like men clean discomfyted. They came flyenge so fast that they
lacked brethe / so that they could skante speak any word (that they said /
was) Syrs get us all hence for we be all dyscomfyted / there is no comeforte.
When they in the host understood the truth of the matter / and saw their
company in that case / they were than so a basshed and a frayed / that they had
no leysar nor puyssaunce to take their own goods / nor to take down their
tents nor pauylyons / nor to trusse horse / carte / nor wagon / but sodaynely
departed without bidding adewe / and left all behind. They were so a frayde
that they made no countenance of a bydynge. They took with them another
vytayle nor caryage / but such as had horses lepte on them / and fled a
way toward the dukes wodde / or else toward Hondan / or to the mount saint
Geruays / or to Gertras / and Dordec. They had none other care but to save them
self fro their enemies. And if they within the garyson of Grave had sooner
known of the dyscomfetture / it had been greatly for their profit / and had
slain or taken many of their enemies in their flyenge / but they knew it not
till it was late / howbeit when they issued out they found great plentye of
Tents and pauylyons / and prouysion of engyns / gonnes / and artyllery / which
they brought in to their town at good leysar / for there were none to say
them nay. Thus brake up the siege of Grave to the great damage of all the
brabansoys / whereof great brute ran in diverse countries / how that a
handefull of men dyscomfyted.xl. thousand / and raised the siege. there was
taken the lord of Bourguenall / and the lord of Linyer / and other to the
nombre of seuentene baners / they were hanged before the image of our lady of
Nymay / for a perpetual memory.

How the duke of Guerles after he had dyscomfyted the brabansoys he went
again to Nymaye. And how tidings came to the french king / and how the
king sent ambassadors to the king of Almayne. Cap. C.xxxvii.
I Have great pain to record or to write of this shameful dyscomfyture of
the brabansoys / for blemysshynge of their honors. but because I promised /
and said in the beginning of my book / that if I shall write truly this
hystory / I must make true relacion of the matter / who so ever it do touch.
Now to proceed further / the young duke of Guetles had and optaygned this
journey / in the year of our lord god a thousand / three hundred / fourscore
and eight / about Mawdlyn tide / in the month of July. And when this
dyscomfyture and chase was passed / and the field clean delivered (which was
done within the space of two hours) Than the guerloys assembled together in the
field / and mad good chere and were joyful. They had good cause so to be / for
their good adventure / for they had as many prisoners or mo / than they were
themself in nombre. Than their haraudes sought out the deed bodies of both
parties / and among other there was slain a young man / son to therle of
Namure / called Vassyer of Colles / lord of Balaster / of whose death the duke
of Gnerles was sorry and sore dyspleased / and that he showed well / for greatly
he complained his death / and said / how the death of a young knight
dyspleased him greatly / for he was a right lusty knight / pleasant and ioly
/ and also the year before he had been in Pruse with the duke of Guerles. Some
counsayled the duke to return to the town of Grave / and there to refresshe
them / and to bring thither their prisoners. Nay not so quod the duke / for
army departing fro Nymay I auowed to our lady there that if I spedde well / to
return thither to offer to our lady / wherefore I will with a merry chere that we
all return thither / and thank our lady / who has sent us the vyctory of our
enemies. No man durst say nay against the dukes mind. And so they rode
thither a good pase / it was but two good leages fro thence as the battle was /
anon they came thither. When tidings came to Nymay of the truth of that
busynes / men / women / and children were joyful / and the clergy issued out
and received the duke with great joy. and the duke of Guerles incontinent with
his knights went to the church / where the image of our lady was / in whom
the duke had great affyaunce / and there in the chapel he was unarmed of all
his pieces in to his doublet / and gave all his armure to the church / in the
honor of our blessed lady / thanking her of the journey that he had
atchyued. And there all the penons of the lords that were taken that day were
hanged up before our lady. I can not tell if they be there as yet or not.
Than the duke went to his lodging / and so did every manne with their
prisoners / for they thought surely they should well pay for their scot /
therefore they made good chere.

GReat brute spread abroad of this duke of Guerles / who had thus over thrown
the brabansoys / whereby he was more douted than he was before. The duches of
Brabante (who lay at the dukes wood with her train) when she saw how yuell
the matter went against her / and that the syege of Grave was raised / she was
sore displesed and good cause why / for it touched her nere. Than she set a
garysone at the dukes wood / to keep fronter there / and so returned through
Champayne and came to Bruselles / and wrote often times to the duke of Burgoyne
/ aduertysynge him of her a state / for all her hope of recoueraunce was in
him. ye may well know and believe that this discomfyture of the brabansoys was
soon known in the french kings court / but they made little acco^pte thereof
/ sith they saw the king had such affection to go to Guerles. The kings
counsel wrote to sir Wyllyam of Tremoyle and to sir Geruais of Myrande / who
were soueraygne capytays of the men of war that the duke of Burgoyne had
sent in to the country / and to the kepers of the three castles on the river
of Meuse / Buth / Gaulgeth / and Nulle. Commaundyng them to keep well their
fronters and not to make any issue out whereby to take any damage / till they
here more / showing them surely how the king in pr^pre person shortly
would go se the duke of Guerles in his own country. This sir Willyam was sore
dyspleased of the adventure that was fallen on their party. but the tidings of
France comforted him again / and ordered him self acordynge as he was
commanded.

Now let us return to the counsel of France who had great desire to go
in to Guerles. They took such dyspleasure with the defyaunce that the duke had
sent to the king / that they another regarded the beginning / mids / nor
end / and said / what so ever it cost / they would make the duke repent his
deed and to deny it / or else they would distroy and burn his lands and his
fathers also / the duke of Iulyers. Dukes / earls / barons knights squyers /
and all other were warned every man to be ready / acordyng as it apertayned for
so long a voyage. And it was ordained that one of the marshals of France
should abide still in the realm / that was sir Loys of Porteuyr / and he to
take heed of the fronters on the other side of the river of Dordone to the sea
/ for in Languedoc / bytwne the river of Gyronde / dyscendynge to the river of
Loyre there was truce had between them. And it was ordained that the other
marshall sir Moton of Blamuyll should go with the king. It was maruayle to
think of the great prouysyon that the lords made. First for the king / and
for the dukes of Berrey / Burgoyn Tourayne / and Burbon / at the cities of
Reins / Chalous / Troys and in all the countries of Champayne / Raynes / in
the bysshopprike of Laon / and Landers. And carts and caryages were taken up
in all parties. It was marueyle to consider the great aparell that was made for
this journey in to Guerles. All this season the duke of Bretaygne was at Paris
/ and could not be delivered by the king / who was most part all that season
of Moustreuell Fault yon. But always he had good chere / and was always
served with fair words and curteyse / and the lords would desire him not to
think long / for shortly he should be delivered / but they showed him that
the king had so much a do for his vyage in to Almayne / that he could attend
to nothing else. The duke was feign to suffer for he could do none other seeing
he was at Paris / and he thought he would not depart without the good will of
the king. There he lay at great cost and charge.

When the certain was known of this voyage in to Guerles / and tails raised
through the realm to pay every man their wages that should serve the king.
Many of the wise men of the realm as well some of the counsel as other /
said / how it was a great outrage to counsel the king to go far of to seek
for his enemies / and that he should thereby put his realm in a great adventure
/ for the king was young / and greatly in the favor of all his people.
Wherefore it had been suffycyente for him to have suffered one or two of his
uncles to have gone thither with the constable of France / and a six or seven
thousand spears / and not the king in propre person. The kings uncles were
of the same oppynyon / and often times they counsayled the king to forbear
his journey him self. But when so ever they spoke to him thereof he was
dyspleased / and would say. If any of you go without my company / it shall be
against my will / and beside that ye shall have no money / otherwise I can not
restrain you. When the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne herd the kings
answer / and saw the great affection that the king had to go that voyage /
they answered and said. Sir / a gods name ye shall go / and without you we
will do nothing therefore sir be of good comfort. Than the kings counsel
regarded one thing the which they thought right necessary (and that was this)
Between the french king and the king of Almayne of long time there had been
ordynaunces made between them / and that was / that none of them should enter
with any army in to any of their neighbors lands / nor the french king to
make no war against the king of Almayne / nor he against the king / on
pain to ryn in the sentence of holy church. and thereto they were bound and
solempely sworn the day of their coronacyon / to the entente to keep their
realms in peace and rest. wherefore than it was aduysed that if the king
should go this voyage in to Guerles (the which is holden of the king of
Almayne) that first he and his counsel should suffycyently inform the king
of Almayne / how the duke of Guerles had shamefully defied the french king /
with fell words / out of the style and usage that lords are wont to dfye
each other in war. and to the entente to cause the duke to deny his deed /
and to repent him / The french king will come in to Almayne / not against
the king of Almayne nor his signory / but against his enemy / and to seek him
out where so ever he can find him. To go on this message was charged sir Guy
of Hancorte / a right sage and dyscrete knight / and with him one of the
masters of the parlyament / called master yues Orient. These two were called
before the counsel and charged to go this voyage to the king of Almayne /
and they were well informed what they should do and say.thus they departed and
took their way by Chalous in Champayne / and rode with a good train like
notable persons / ambassadors fro the French king. And they found the lord
of Coucy at Chalous / who lay there and retained knights and squiers of Bar
/ Lorayne / and Champayne / to go in that voyage with him in the vowarde. He
made to these ambassadors good chere / and made them a great dinner at their
lodging / and the next day they departed and rode toward saint Menehont /
and toward the country of Lusenburgh / there to here certain tidings of
the king of Almayne.

How the french king gave leave to the duke of Bretayne to return in to his
country / and how the country of Brabant would not consent too the kings
passage nor his aremy / and how the ambassadors of France sped. Ca.
C.xxxviii.
While these french ambassadors went to speak with the king of Almayne / in
ye mean time the french men let not still to make their prouysions / and
commandment given / every manne to be in the field by the mids of Auguste /
in Champayne or there about / for the king would be ready by that time they
would not tarry for any answer fro the king of Almayn. Than the french king
and his uncles thought it good that the duke of Bretaygne should depart home.
He was sent for to the king / to Monstreuell fault you / and there he had
good chere of the king and of the duke of Burgoyne / and of the duke of
Tourayne / for as than the duke of Berrey was not there / he was in his own
country assemblyge men together / and had sent his commandment in to Poyctou
to knights and squyers there / that they should draw in to the field. The
king and the duke of Burgoyne treated amyable the duke of Bretaygne / and
showed him nothing but love. ye have herd here before how the duke had rendered
again to the constable his three castles / and the town of Iugon / but as for
the hundred thousand frankes that he had received / he was loathe to render
them again / for he axed alowaunce for such prouysyons as he had made / and
fortifyenge of his garysons / castles / and towns / and retayning of men of
war / and keeping them all the winter / for he thought to have had war.
but the king and his counsel fed him with so sweet pleasant words / that
finally he was agreed to pay again the hundred thousand frankes in five
year.xx. thousand every year till it were paid. Than the duke of Bretayne
departed right amyably / and the king gave him many fair iouels. And so he
returned to Paris / and there the duke of Burgoyn made him a great dinner / and
there they took leave each of other. Thanne the duke of Bretaygne paid for all
his dyspenses / and took the way to Estampes / and rode through Beaulce to
Bogency on ye river of Loyre / and there his men went on before and passed
through the countries of Bloys / Main / Thourayne / Aniou / and entered in to
Bretayne / but the duke him self had ready at Boyge^cy his navy / and there he
entered into a fair ship / and with him the lord Mountforde and the lord of
Malestroit / and so sailed down the river of Loyre / and passed under the
bridge of Bloys / and so went a long the river to Nau^tes in his own
country. Now let us leave to speak of the duke of Bretayne / and as far as
I could here he held well the couenaunte made between the french king and
him / and did nothing after to be remembered till I closed this book / I can not
tell what he will do herafter / if he do I shall speak thereof acordyng as I
shall know. Now I will return to the french king / who prepared for his
journey in to Guerles.

When ye lord of Coucy was come to the king to Monstreau / he showed the king
and his counsel how he had sped / and how that all the knights and squyers
in Bare / in Lourayne / in Burgoin / and to the rivers of Ryne and Some were
ready to go with him. the king had thereof great joy / and said by the grace of
god he would the same yerese his cosyns the duke of Iuliers and Guerles. First
they determined which way they should take / for the surest and way shortest
(some said) yt the right way was to go by Thyreashe and to pass by the fronter
of Haynalt / and of Liage / and to pass through Braba^t / and so to enter in
to Guerles / and to pass the river of Meuse at Trecte / and so to enter into
the land of Iuliers and fro thence in to Guerles. Of this determynacion the
king and his counsel wrote to the duches of Brabant and to the country /
shewnge them the way that the french king purposed to keep. It pleased right
well the duches / but the country would not agree thereto but said how the
king and the frenchmen should have no passage that way for it should be
greatly to their damage. The good towns and the knights of Brabante were of
ye opinion / and said to their lady the duches / that if she consented to
suffer the french men to enter into her country / they would never aid nor
socoure her against the duke of Guerles / but surely they said they would close
their towns / and go and defend their lands against ye frenchmen / saying
how they should lose more by their passinge through their country / than if
their enemies were in the mids thereof. when the duches parceyued the wylles
and ententes of the people / as well knights as other / she saw no remedy /
but to dyssymule the matter. than she charged sir Johan Orpen and sir Johan of
Grave / and Nycholas de la Money / to go in to France to speak with the
french king and with the duke of Burgoyn / to excuse the country of Brabant /
that he should not take his voyage that way / for they of the country think
they should be sore grieved and distroyed if he should pass through their
country / and she commanded them to say / that as for herself she could be
well content therewith / and had done all that she could that it might so have been. They acordynge to their ladies mind departed fro Brusels and rode
toward Paris / and did so much by their iourneys that they came to Moustreau
fault yon / where the king and his uncles were / and there was nothing spoken
of / but of their going in to Guerles. The duchess ambassadors first came
to ye duke of Burgoyne / and showed him their letters and their message. And he
at the request of his aunte was mean to the king and to his counsel / and
also the lord of Coucy did what he might. In so much that their first
purpose as passing through Brabant to enter in to Guerles was broken / and the
duches and the country excused. Than it was aduysed that they should go along
the realm / which way they said was most honorable for the king / and also
for the brabansoys / burgonyons sauoysyns / and other.

THan it was concluded / and such named as should go in vowarde. There were
ordained a.xxv. hundred hewers of woods / hedgers and dykers / to make plain
the ways. The french men had way good enough thorough the realm till they
came to Ardayne. Than their good ways began to fail / than they found high
wodes diverse and savage / and walls / rocks / and mountains. These pyoners
were sent before the vangarde with a thousand spears / to advise the best
passage for the king and for the host / and for their caryage / whereof they
had a.xii. M. carts beside other caryages / and they to hew down the high
wodes of Ardane and to make them plain / and to make new ways where never
none was before / nor no man passed that way. Every man took great pain to do
their dylygence / and specially such as were about the king / for they had
never so great affection to go in to Flanders / as they had than to go into
Guerles. and the lord of Coucy was sent to A^^gnon / to him that called him
self pope Clement / I know not for what cause / and the vicount of Meaulx /
sir Johan Roy / and the lord de la Bone / had the goueruau^ce of his men till
he returned again.

Now let us somewhat speak of sir Guy of Ha^court and of master yues Orient
who were sent to the king of Almayne. They rode so long that they came to
Co^ualence where the king was. And when they had refresshed the^ they went
toward the king / who was informed of their coming before: and he had great
desire to know what intent they came for. He assembled his counsel / and than
these two lords came before the king of Almayn and curtessy did salute him and
delyuerd their letters of crede^ce fro the french king. ye king took and reed
them / and than regarded the^ and said. sir Guy / show forth your charge / ye
knight spoke right sagely and by great leysar: and showed the king and his
counsel how the french king with his army royal will come in to the fro^ters
of Almayne / not to make any war against him / but against his enemy ye duke
of Guerles / who had highly defied the king their master with shamfull words
/ and out of the style of all other defyau^ces / ye which the french king nor
his counsel can in no wise suffer. Wherefore sir quod they / the king
requires you / as ye be a noble king and of his blood and he of yours / as all
ye world knows: yt ye will not sustain / aid nor mentayne the pride of
this duke: but ye to hold ye aliances and co^fyrmacions sometime done and
sworn between thempire of Almayne and the realm of France ye which he will
fermly keep on his perte: Than ye king answered and said. sir Guy we are
informed yt our cosyn the french king will assemble togider great no^bre of
people He neded not for so small a matter to assemble such people / and to
spend so much to seek his ennemy so far of / for if he had desired me / with
less travail I could well have caused ye duke of Guerles to hame come to
mercy and reason. sir quod the knight / we thank you yt it pleases you to say
so / but the king our master regards but little his expenses nor travel of
his men / but he regards his honor / and to this his counsel is agreed.
and sith yt you nor your counsel is not myscontent with our master (who will
in no wise violate nor break ye ordinances and confirmacio^s of old time made
bitwene ye two realms of France and almain) but keep and mentayne it / on the
pains ye is ordained / therefore sir we be sent now to you. Well quod the king
I believe you well. and as for our cosyn ye french king shall be welcome in to
these pertes / as form I think not to stir There with the messa^gers were
right joyous / and thought they had sped very well. tha^ they desired to have
letts again / ye king said they should have. That day they tarried and dyned
with the king and had good chere / and after dinner they went to their
lodgings. Whereto should I make long process / they sped so well that they had
letters and such answer as pleased the^ well. Than they took leave of ye king
of Almayne / and returned the same way they came. Now let us speak of the
french king.

How therle of Bloys sent to the french king.ii. C. spears / and the duke of
Loraine and the lord Henry of Bare came to the king. And how the dukes of
Iullyers and Guerles knew that the French king came on them. Cap. C.xxxix.
TO acco^plyshe this vyage / every lord in France aperelled the^ self of
every thing needful. ye lords / knights and squiers / and other men of war
departed fro their own places / as well fro Auergne / couergne / quercy /
lymosyn / poytou / and xaynton: as fro Bretayne / normandy / aniou / tourayn /
and cha^payn / and fro all the lymitacio^s of ye realm of France. Fewest men
came out of fardest countries and ye most no^bre out of Burgoyn / picardy /
bare / and lorayne. and because they of the body of France were in the way /
therefore they were best traveled. It was ordained by ye king and his counsel
/ yt no man should take any thyg in ye country without payeng therefore / to
the^cent that ye pore men should not be grieved. but for all yt ordinance / ye
which was well known and sprede abroad / and upon pain of great punissyon.
yet the men of war often times sore traveled ye countries as they passed
through / they could not absteyne / for they were but yuell paid of their
wages / and they must needs live. That was their excuse when they were blamed
for their pyllage by the constable / marshalles / or capitaynes. The earl of
Bloyes was sent unto / to send two hundred spears of chosen men / and was
promised well to be paid. I can not say how he was dalte with all / but he
sent to serve the king two hundred spears / out of the county of Bloyes.
And capitayns of them was / the lord of Vyenne / sir Guyllyam of saint Martyne
/ sir Wyllyam of Chaumont / and the lord Montigny: these four had the
governance of the earl of Bloys band. They drew little and little toward
Cha^payne thither they were ordained to go. Than the French king departed from
Moustreau Fault yon / and took the way to Chalous in Champayne. As than the
duke of Berrey was not come / for or his departing he looked to here tidings
fro sir Helyon of Lignacke whom he had sent to the duke of Lancastre to Bayon
/ to have to his wife ye dukes doghter: as ye have herd before. But he had her
not / For the duke of Lancastre dissymuled with him / and held still the
knight with him at Bayon. He treated with two parties but he rather enclyned to
the king of Castyle than to the duke of Berrey / and in like wise so did the
lady Custaunce his wife. The duke made good chere to both parties to the
intent to inflame them the sooner to the marriage of his daughter. The king of
Castyls messangers sore traueyled in treatyng of this marriage: They rested not
to ride in and out between the parties: They offered great gifts to those
messangers / but they of fred nothing to sir Helyon of Lignacke. When it was
known in ye realm of France that the king was at Chalous on his way
toward the duchy of Guerles / than every man departed fro their houses and
drew after the king. Than came the duke of Berrey and lodged at Espinay / and
the duke of Burbone at another place / the earl of March / ye earl Dolphyn of
Auergne / the earl of saint Pole / and the earl of Tourayne. And with the king
was the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Lorayne / the duke of Tourayne / the
constable of France / sir Guye of Tremoile sir Johan of Beull: And the
country about Chalous and Raynes / more than.xii. leages all about was clean
eaten up with the men of war. As than the lord of Coucy was not returned
fro the pope: Than returned sir Wyllyam of Ha^court and master yues Orient /
and found the king and his uncles at Chalous. The king was ioyouse of their
coming and demanded tidings. They showed the king what they had found and
done / and said how the king of Almaygne had made them good chere / and said
to the king. Sir / when the king had reed the copye of ye defyaunce that the
duke of Guerles had sent to you / both he and his counsel were yuell content
therewith: and said how it was done by great presu^pcyon and pride. And we can
parceyue none other / but he and his counsel is well content with your
enterprice / and ye shall have no let by him: and the king is well content to
uphold and maynteyne the ancient alyau^ces that is between the empire and
France: he says ye shall have no dout there of. Hereof the French king was
right joyful how be it some said / that wheder the king of Almayne would or
not / the king had puissaunce suffycient to do what he would without danger /
for all him. than the king ordained to depart fro Chalous in Champayn / and so
deperted and took his way right to great Pre.

When the king came to great Pre he tarried there a three days / he could make
no great iourneys / there was so much people before him and behind / and
round about him / so that he was constrained to ride easily to have good
lodgyng / and because of the great prouisyon that followed after the host. Fro
the first company to the last contained.xxiiii. leages of that country / and
still daily came people. Therle of great Pre received the king in to his town
and country / and offered all at the kings pleasure. The king was well content
with him / and therle was appointed to the vantgard. Thither came to the king ye
duke of Lorayne and sir Henry of Bare / with a fair company of men of arms.
The duke of Loraine was ordained to be with his son the lord of Coucy / and
sir Henry of Bare to abide with the king. the pioners were sore besyed in the
forest of Ardane / to cut down wode and to make ways where never non was
before. they had great pain to fill the valeys to make the way plain for the
caryage to pass. There were a three. M. that did nothing else. When ye duches
of Braba^t knew surely how the king was on his way / and approached the
foreste of Ardayne / she was thereof right joyful / for she thought at that
voyage she should be well revenged of the duke of Guerles / and how the
French king should bring him to reason. And also his father the duke of
Iulyers / who had done to her many anoyaunces: Than she departed fro Bruselles
/ and in her company the earl of Sammes in Ardain / the lord of Bocelairs and
diverse other / and took her way to Lusenbourge to se the king and to speak
with him. She passed ye river of Meuse and the river of Huy / and at last came
to Basconque and there tarried the king / for he should pass thereby / and so
he did: For when he departed Grant Pre / he passed the River of Meuse at
Morsay with all his host / and rode small iourneys. Than tidings came in to
the duchy of Iulyers and in to Guerles / that the French king was coming on
them / with a hundred thousand men: And that he had never so much people
toguyder before. He was not so great a company when he came to Burboure /
where he thought the English army had been gretter than he found them. The
duke of Iulyers than began to dout / but the duke of Guerles made nothing
thereof / but said. Let them come / the further they come the more weryer
shall they be and they and their caryages shall wax feeble and their prouisyons
shall waste and winter shall draw on / and I am in a strong country. They
shall not enter at their ease. They shall recule back sometime otherwise than
by the sown of the trumpettes / and it shall behoue them to be always
toguyder / which they can not be / if they will enter in to my country: And if
they disrought and be out of order / they shall soon be taken up wheder they
will or not. How be it to say the truth quod the duke / our cosyn of
France is of a good courage: he shows and does as I should do. Thus the duke
of Guerles devised among his knights / but the duke of Iulyers was sore
abashed / for he saw well the French king would his land were but burnt
and lost. Than he took counsel of his brother the Archebysshoppe of Colonge
and of his cosyn the bishop. Leage / sir Arnolde of Horns / how he should do
to save his land fro brennyng and exylyng. These two prelates counsayled him
and said. how it must needs behoue him to humble him self to the French king
and to his uncles. The duke said / he was well content so to do.

How sir Helion of Lignacke made his report to the duke of Berrey And how
the lords of Scotland assembled toguyder in the City of Berdane / and
determined to reyse up an army to enter in to England And of an English
squire / Who was takenne by the Scotts / who knew the secretnesse of both
realms England and Scotland. Cap. C.xl.
THan by the counsel of the bishop of Trect and by the advise of the
bishop of Colonge / ye bishop of Laege was sent to the French king to
treat for ye duke of Iulyers. The king approached / but he passed not two or
three leages a day / for his train was great between Morsay and our lady of
Amount / where as the duke of Berey and all his route / with mo than five
hundred speres was lodged. Thither came to the duke of Berrey sir Helyon of
Lignacke / and sir Wyllyam his brother. Sir Wyllyam came fro the siege before
Vanchadore / for the duke had sent for him / and the duke of Burbone had sent
for sir Johan Boesme lance. and they had left still at the siege all their
companyes / and had left for capitaynes sir Johan Butlere and sir Loyes
Dambier: And sir Helyon of Lignacke came out of Gascon fro Bayon / fro the duke
of Lancastre. The duke of Berrey made him good chere / and demanded tidings.
Sir Helyon showed him and said. Sir / the king of Castyle seeks on the duke of
Lancastre to have peace with him / and treats sore to have his sone the
prince of Wales / to marry with the dukes daughter. With that word the duke of
Berrey was pensyfe and said. Sir Helion / yet I shall send you ones again to
know more certain / and the bishop of Poycters with you / but as at this
time we have enough to do. Also the same weke the lord of Coucy returned fro
Auygnon and came to the king to Ardane / every man was glad of his coming.

yE have herd here before / how king Richard of England had some trouble:
He against his uncles / and his uncles against him / with other diverse
incydentes / as by the duke of Irelande and other / and many knights in
England deed and beheeded / and the archebysshop of york brother to the lord
Neuell was at a point to have lost his benefyce. And by the new counsaylers
about the king / and by the arch bishop of Caunterbury: the lord Neuell
(who had been the chief ruler and kepar of the fronters of Northumberlande
agayst the scotts five years together) was as than put out of wages. He had
before every year sixtene thousand frankes / out of the county of york and
bysshoprike of Durham. And there was set in his stead the lord Henry Percye
/ and he had to wages by the year but a.xi. thousand Frankes. Whereof other
lords of his lygnage / though they were of his kynne / yet they had thereat
great envy and indignacyon one against another: And all this knew right well
the scotts. Than the lords and knights of Scotland determined ones again
to reyse up an army / and to make a journey in to England. they said it was
as than good time and hour / for they saw the Englysshmen were not all of one
accord. And where as often times past / they had received great buffettes /
than they said it was good time for them to be revenged. And to the intent that
their purpose should not be known / they ordained a feast to be holden on the
fronter of the wild scotts / at a city called Berdane / where assembled in
manner all the lords of Scotland. At this feast they concluded and made full
promise / that in the mids of August / the year of our lord god / a
thousand three hundred fourscore ano eight / They should mete all with their
puyssaunce on the fronters of Gales / at a castle in the high forest called
Gedeours. Thus at that time they departed each fro other. And of this covenant
there was none of them that made their king privy thereto / For they said among
themself / their king was no man of war. There came to Gedeours at the day
appointed. first the earl James Duglas / sir Johan of Morette / earl of March
and or Donbare / sir Wyllyam de Fu / and sir Stephyn Earl of Monstres / sir
Aucebauce of Duglas / sir Robert Auerceque / sir Mark Odremneu / sir Wyllyam
Lymsey / and sir James his brother / Thomas of Berry / sir Alysaunder Lymsey /
the lord of Sechyn / sir Johan of Sobelas sir Patryke of Do^bare / sir John^
Senclere / sir Patryke of Hoteborne / sir Johan son to ye lord Momogomercy /
sir Adam of glass diuyn / sir Wyllyam Reduryn / sir Wyllyam Stonacke / sir John^
of Halpe breton / sir Alider / and sir Robert Lander / sir Stephyn freseyle /
sir Alysander Ramsey and sir Johan his brother / sir Wyllm^ Morbereth / sir
Maubert Here / sir Wylliam of Waleran / sir John^ Amonstan / and Dauy his son
/ Robert Colemney / and diverse other knights and squiers of Scotland. In
threscore year before there was not assembled toguyder in Scotland such a
nombre of good me^ / they were a.xii. hundred spears and.xl. thousand men
beside with their archers: but i^ time of need the scotts can little skyll
with their bows. They rather bear axes / wherewith they give great strokes.

When they were thus met together in the marchesse of Gedeours they were merry
/ and said / they would never enter again in to their own houses till they
had been in England and done such deeds there / that it should be spoken
of.xx. year after. And to the intent to make sure poyntment / they assigned a
day to mete at a church in a fair lau^de called zedon. Tidings came in to
Northumberlande (as nothing can be hid if men put to their dilygence to
know) both to therle and to his children / to the seneschall of york / and
to sir Mathue Redman captain of Berwike / of this great feast that had been at
Bredane. And to the^rent to know wherefore it was / these lords sent to
sertche covertly by heraudes and mynstrels. The scotts could not do their
matters so secrerly / but ye lords of England knew how men rose in scotla^de
/ and how they should mete again at Gedeours. Brute of this came to Newcastell
vpontyne: And when the lords knew of this / every man took good head to his
charge / and provided them self ready to assemble if need were / and this they
did secretly / because their enterprice should not be broken. Every man held
him self in their own houses / and were determined to mete toguyder / as
soon as they knew that the scotts came forward and said. If the scotts
come forth we shall have knowledge thereof / If they draw toward Carlyle we
shall enter at another part in to their country / and we shall do them more
dommage than they can do us / for their country is all open. We may go where
we list / and our country is strong / and the towns and castelles well closed.
And the better to know the state of the scotts / they sent a gentylman of
England / who knew right well the marchesse of Scotland / and specially the
forest of Gedeours where ye scotts should assemble. And the Englisshe squire
went so forward / that without espyeng he came to the church of zedon / where
the scottyss he lords were. And he encred in among them like one of their
servants / and there he herd and knew a great part of thententes of the
scotts. and at the end of their counsel the squire went to a tree where he
had tied his horse / and thought to have found him there / but he was gone.
for a scotte (who be great thieves) had stolen him away. He durst not speak
for him / but so went forth a foot boted and spurted. And when he was gone fro
the church two bow shot / than there were two scottyss he knights devised
between them self and said one to another. fellow / I have seen a marueyle /
behold yonder a man gothe alone / and as I think he has lost his horse / for
he came by and spoke no word / I wene he be none of our company / let us
ride after him to prove my saying. They rode after him and soon ouertoke him.
Whan^e he saw them coming / he would gladly have been thens. They came to him
and demanded whether he would and from whens he came / and what he had done
with his horse. He began to varry in his saying / and answered not directely to
their purpose. They turned him / and said he should go and speak with their
lords. They brought him again to the church of zedon / and presented him to
the earl Duglas and to other lords: they examyned him and parceyued well he
was an English man. Than they said they would know the truth why he came
thither. He was yuell willing to show the truth / but they handled him in
such wise / that he was feign to show all the matter / for they bare him in
hand / without he would show the truth / inco^tynent he should lose his
heed: and if he would show the truth / he should have none yuell. There they
knew by him that the lords of Northumberlande had sent him thither: to know
the estate of their ent^price / and which way they would draw. Hereof the
scotts were right joyous / and would not for a great good / but that they had
spoken with this squire. Than they demanded again of him / in what part the
English lords were / and whyder there were any aparence that they would
assemble toguyder / and what way^ they would take to enter in to Scotland:
Outher by the sea side by Berwyke / or else by Donbare: or else the high way by
the county of Monstres toward Streuelyn. The squire answered and said. Sirs
/ sith it behooves me to say the truth I shall.

When I departed from them fro Newcastell there was none aparence of their
assemblyng / but they be on a redynesse to depart / as well to day as to
morrow. And as soon as they know that ye set forward and enter in to
England / they will not come to mete with you / for they be not of ye power so
to do / nor to fight with you / sithe ye be so great a nombre / as it is said
in England that ye be. Why quod the earl of Moret: what nombre do they repute
us at? Sir quod he it is said how ye be a.xl. thousand men and.xii. hundred
spears. And sir / if ye take the way in to Gales they will go by Berwike /
and so to Donbare / to Edenborome / or else to Alquest. and if ye take not that
way than they will go by Carlyle / and in to the mountayns of yt country.
When the lords herd that / each of them regarded other. Than the English
squire was put to the keeping of the Constable of Gedeours / and commanded
that he should be surely kept: than in the same place they went again to
counsel.

THe lords of Scotland were right joyful of that they knew surely the
intent of their enemies / and than they demanded counsel what way was best
for them to take. The most wysest and best expert in war spoke first / and
that was sir Archanbas Duglas and therle of Fenne / sir Alysander Ramsey / sir
Johan Saint clear / and sir James Lymsey: They said for fear of faylynge of
our intent / we counsel that we make two armies / to the entente that our
enemies shall not know whereunto to attend. And let the most part of our
host and caryage go by Carleon in Galls / and let the other company (of a
three or four hundred spears and two thousa^de of other well horsed) draw
toward Newcastell upon Tyne / and pass the river and enter in to the
bysshorike of Durham / and burn and exyle the country. We shall make a great
breull in England or our enemies be provided / And if wese that they do
follow us (as they will do) Than let us draw all our companyes toguyder /
and take a good place and fight with them. We doubt not but we shall have
honor. Than let us be revenged of the dommages they have done to us. This
counsel was accepted / and ordained that sir Archanbas Duglas / therle of
Fenne / the earl of Surlancke / the earl of Monstres / the earl of Mare /
therle of Astroderne / sir Stephyn of Freseyle / sir George of Donbare / and
sirtene other great lords of Scotland should led the most part of the
army toward Carlyle. And the earl Duglas / sir Orge earl of Mare and of
Donbare / and the earl Johan of Morette. These three to be capitaynes of three
hundred spears of chosen men / and of two thousand other men and archers /
and they to go toward Newcastell and enter in to Northu^berlande. Thus these
two hoostes departed each from other / each of them prayenge other / that if
the Englysshmen followed any of their armies / not to fight with them / till
both their armies were joined toguyder. Thus in a morning they departed fro
Gedeours and took the feldes.

How the earl Duglas wanne the penon of sir Henry Percy / at the barryers
before Newcastell vpontyne: and how the scotts burnt the castle of Pondlen
/ and how sir Henry Percy and sir Rafe his brother took advise to follow the
scotts to conquer again the penone that was lost at the scrimysshe. Cap.
C.xli.
WHan^e the English lords saw that their squier returned at again / at
the time appointed / and coud know nothing what the scotts did / nor what
they were purposed to do / than they thought well ye their squire was taken.
The lords sent each to other to be ready when soever they should here that the
scotts were a broad / as for their messanger they thought him but lost. Now
let us speak of the earl Duglas and other / for they had more to do than they
that went by Carlyle.

When the earls of Duglas / of Moret / of de la Mare / and Donbare departed fro
the great host: they took their way / thynkyng to pass the water / and to
enter in to the bysshoprike of Durham / and to ride to ye town and than to
return / brinnyng and exyling the country / and so to come to Newcastell /
and to lodge there in the town in the dispite of all the English men. And as
they determined so so they did assaye to put it in ure / for they rode a
great pase under covert / with out doing of any pyllage by the way / or
assautyng of any castle / tower / or house: But so came in to the lord
Percyes land and passed the river of Tyne without any let / a three leages
above Newcastell not far fro Braspathe / and at last entered in to the
bisshoprike of Durham / where they found a good country. Than they began to
make war / to slay people and to brinne vyllages / and to do many sore
displeasures. As at that time the earl of Northumberlande and the other lords
and knights of that country knew nothing of their coming. When tidings
ca^e to Newcastell and to Durham / that the scotts were abroad / and that they
might well se by the fires and smoke abroad in the country. The earl sent to
Newcastell his two sons / and sent commandment to every man to draw to
Newcastell / saying to his sons. ye shall go to Newcastell and all the
country shall assemble there / and I shall tarry at Nymyche / which is a
passage that they must pass by / if we may enclose them we shall speed well.
Sir Henry Percy and sir Rafe his brother obeyed their fathers commandment /
and came thither with them of the country. The scotts rode burning and
exylynge the country / that the smoke thereof came to New castle. The scotts
came to the gates of Durham and skrymysshed there / but they tarried not long /
but returned as they had ordained before to do / and that they found by the
way took and distroyed it. Between Durham and Newcastell is but twelve leages
englyssh and a good country. There was no town without it were closed / but
it was burnt / and they repassed the River of Tyne / where they had passed
before / and than came before Newcastell / and there rested. All the English
knights and squyers of the country of york and bysshoprike of Durham were
assembled at Newecastell / and thither came the seneschall of york sir Rafe
Mombraye / sir Rafe Redmayne capytayne of Berwyke / sir Roberte Angle / sir
Thomas Gray / sir Thomas Holcon / sir Johan Felton / sir Johan Lyerborne / sir
Thomas Abyton / the baron of Helcon / sir Johan Copuldyke and diverse other / so
that the town was so full of people that they wist not where to lodge.

When these three scottysshe earls (who were chyefe capytaynes) had made their
enterprise in the bysshoprike of Durham / and had sore over rynne the country
/ than they returned to Newcastell / and there rested and tarried two days /
and every day they skrymysshed. The earl of Northumberlandes two sons were
two young lusty knights / and were ever formaste at the barryers to
skrymysshe. There were many proper feats of arms done and archyued / there
was fighting hand to hand (Among other) there fought hand to hand the
earl Duglas and sir Henry Percy / and by force of arms the earl Duglas wanne
the penon of sir Henry Percyes / wherewith he was sore dyspleased / and so were
all the englysshmen / and the earl Duglas said to sir Henry Perey. sir / I
shall bear this token of your prowes in to Scotland / and shall set it on
high on my castle of Alquest / that it may be seen far of. Sir quod sir
Henry / ye may be sure ye shall not pass the bounds of this country till ye
be met withal / in such wise that ye shall make none auaunte thereof. Well sir
quod the earl Duglas / come this night to my lodging and seek for your penon /
I shall set it before my lodging / and se if ye will come to take it away.
As than it was late and the scotts withdrewe to their lodginges / and
refresshed them with such as they had they had flesh enough. They made that
night good watch / for they thought surely to be a waked / for the words they
had spoken / but they were not: For sir Henry Percy was counsayled not so to
do. The next day the scotts dyslodged and returned toward their own
country / and so came to a castle and a town called Pouclan / whereof ser
Haymon of Alphell was lord / who was a right good knight. There the scotts
rested / for they came thither by times / and understood that the knight was in
his Castle. Than they ordained to assail the castle and gave a great assaute
/ so that by force of arms they wan it / and the knight within it. Than the
town and castle was brent / and fro thens the Scotts went to the town and
castle of Combur / and eight english mile fro New castle and there lodged.
That day they made none assaut / but the next morning they blewe their horns /
and made ready to assail the castle which was strong / for it stood in the
maresse. That day they assauted till they were weary / and did nothing. Than
they sowned the retrayte / and returned to their lodgyng. Than the lords
drew to counsel to determyne what they should do. The most part were of
the acorde that the next day they should dyssoge without gyuynge of any assaute
/ and to draw fair and easly toward Carlyle. but therle Duglas brake that
counsel / and said. in dispyte of sir Henry Percy (who said he would come and
win again his penon) let us not depart hence for two or three days / let
us assail this castle / it is prignable? we shall have double honor? and
than let us se if he will come and fetch his penon / he shall be well
defended. Every man acorded to his saying / what for their honor and for the
love of him. Also they lodged there at their ease / for there was none that
troubled them / they made many lodgings of bows and great herbs / and
fortityed their camp sagely with the maresse that was thereby / and their
caryages were set at the enter in to the maresses / and had all their beestes
within the maresse. Than they aparelled for to saute the next day / this was
their entensyon.

Now let us speak of sir Henry Percy and of sir Rafe his brother / and show
some what that they did. They were sore dyspleased that therle Duglas had won
the penon of their arms also it touched greatly their honors if they did not
as sir Henry Percy said he would. For he had said to the earl Duglas that he
should not carry his penon out of England / and also he had openly spoken it be
fore all the knights and squiers that were at Newcastell. The englysshmen
there thought surely that therle Duglas band was but the scotts vangarde /
and that their host was left behind. The knights of the country such as
were well expert in arms / spoke against sir Henry Percyes opinyon / and said
to him. Sir / there fortuneth in war often times many losses / if the Earl
Duglas have won your penon / he bought it dear / for he came to the gate to
seek it / and was well beaten / Another day ye shall win as much of him or
more. Sir / we say this because we know well all the power of Scotland is
abroad in the feldes / and if we issue out and be not men ynowe to fight with
them / and peradventure they have made this skrimysshe with us / to the intent
to draw us out of the town / and the nombre that they be of as it is said /
above. xl. thousand men / they may soon enclose us / and do with us what
they will. yet it were better to lose a penon / than two or three hundred
knights and squyers / and put all our country in adventure. These words
refrayned sir Henry and his brother / for they would do nothing against
counsel. Than tidings came to them by such as had seen the Scotts / and
seen all their demeanoure / and what way they took / and where they rested.

How sir Henry Percy and his brother with a good nombre of men of arms and
archers went after the scotts to win again his penon / that the earl Duglas
had won before Newcastell upon Tyne / and how they assailed the scotts
before Mountberke in their lodgings. Cap. C.xlii.
IT was showed to sir Henry Percy and to his brother / and to the other knights
and squyers that were there by such as had followed the scotts fro Newecastell
/ and had well aduysed their doing / who said to sir Henry and to sir Rafe.
Syrs / we have followed the scotts privily / and have discovered all the
country. The scotts be at Pountclan / and have taken sir Haymon Alphell in
his own castle / and fro thence they be gone to Ottenburge / and there they
lay this night / what they will do to morrow we know not. They are ordained
to abide there / and sirs / surely their great host is not with them / for in
all they pass not there a three thousa^de men. When sir Henry herd that he was
joyful and said. Syrs let us leap on our horses / for by the faith Iowe to
god and to my lord my father / I will go seek for my penon / and dyslodge
them this same night. Knights and squiers that herd him agreed thereto and
were joyous / and every man made him ready. The same evening the bishop of
Durham came thither with a good company / for he herd at Durham how the
scotts were before Newcastell / and how that the lord Percies sons with
other lords and knights should fight with the scotts. Therefore the bishop
of Dutham to come to the reskewe had assembled up all the country / and so was
coming to Newcastell. But sir Henry Percy would not abide his coming / for he
had with him sire hundred spears knights and squiers / and an eight thousand
fotemen / they thought that sufficyent nombre to fight with the scotts / if
they were not but three hundred spears / and three thousand of other. Thus they
departed fro Newcastell after dinner / and set forth in good order / and took
the same way as the scotts had gone and rode to Ottebourge a seven little
leages fro thence / and fair way / but they could not ride fast because of
their fotemen. And when ye scotts had supped and some laid down to their
rest / and were weary of trauaylynge and sautynge of the castle all that day /
and thought to rise erly in the morning in cole of the day to give a new
assaute. Therewith suddenly the englysshmen came on them and entered in to the
lodginges / wenyng it had been the masters lodgings / and therein were but
varlettes and servants. Than the englysshmen cried Percy Percy / and entered
into the lodgings. and ye know well where such affray is / noise is sone
raised. and it fortuned well for the scotts / for when they saw the
englysshmen came to wake them / than the lords sent a certain of their
servants of fotemen / to skrymysshe with the englysshmen at the enter of the
lodgings / and in ye mean time they armed and aparelled them / every man
under his baner and under his capytaynes penon. The night was far on / but
the moon shone so bright as and it had been in a manner day / it was in the
month of August and the wether fair and temperate.

THus the scotts were drawn to gyder and without any noise departed fro their
lodgings and went about a little mountain / which was greatly for their
advantage / for all the day before they had well aduysed the place / and said
among them self. If the englysshemen come on us suddenly / than we will do
thus and thus / for it is a ioperdous thing in the night / if men of war
enter into our lodgings / if they do than we will draw to such a place / and
thereby outher we shall wyn or lose. When the englysshmen entered in to the field
/ at the first they soon overcame the varlettes / and as they entered further
in always they found new men to besy them and to skrymysshe with them. Than
suddenly came the scotts fro about the mountain / and set on the
englysshmen or they were ware / and cried their cries whereof the english
men were sore astonyed. Than they cried Percy / and the other party cried
Duglas. There began a cruel battle / and at the first encountre many were
overthrown of both parties. And because the englisshmen were a great nombre
and greatly desired to vanquysshe their enemies / and rested at their pas and
greatly did put a back the scotts / so that the scotts were nere
dyscomfyted. Than the earl James Duglas (who was young and strong / and of
great desire to get praise and grace / and was willing to deserve to have it
/ and cared for no pain nor travail) came forth with his baner and cried
Duglas Duglas. And sir Henry Percy and sir Rafe his brother / who had great
indygnacion against the earl Duglas / because he had won the penon of their
arms at the barryers before Newcastell / came to that part / and cried Percy
/ their two baners met and their men / there was a sore fight. The
englysshmen were so strong and fought so valyauntly that they reculed the
scotts back. There were two valiant knights of scotts / under the baner of
the earl Duglas called sir Patryke of Helborne and sir Patryke his son / they
acquyted them self that day valy auntly. the earls baner had been won and they
had not ben / they defended it so valyauntly / and in the rescuynge thereof did
such feats of arms / that it was greatly to their recommendacyon / and to
their heirs for ever after.

IT was showed me by such as had been at the same battle / as well by
knights and squyers of England as of Scotland / at the house of the earl of
Foiz. for anon after this battle was done I met at Ortays two squyers of
England called Johan of Newecastell / and Johan of Cauteron. also when I
returned fro Auignon I found also there a knight and a squire of Scotland /
I knew them and they knew me / bysuche tokens as I showed them of their
country / for I auctor of this book in my youth had rydden nygh over all the
realm of Scotland / and I was as than a fyftene days in the house of earl
wyllyam Duglas / father to the same earl James of whom I spoke of now.

In a castle a five leages fro Edenboro win the country of Alquest / the same
time I saw there this Earl James a fair young child / and a suster of his
called the lady Blaunche / and I was enfourmed by both these parties / how
this battle was as sore a battle fought as lightly has been hard of before
of such a nombre / and I believe it well / for englysshmen on the one party
and scotts on the other party / are good men of war / for when they mete
there is a hard sight without sparynge. there is no hoo between them as long
as spears / swords / ares / or dagers will endure / but lay on each upon
other. and when they be well beaten and that the one part has optaygned the
victory / they than glorifye so in their deeds of arme^ and are so joyful /
that such as be taken they shall be raunsomed or they go out of the ^elde / so
that shortly each of them is so content with other / that at their deparrynge
curtoysly they will say / god thank you. But in fighting one with another
there is no play nor sparynge / and this is true / and that shall well apere
by this said rencountec / for it was as valyauntly foughten as could be
devised / as ye shall here.

How the earl James Duglas by his valya^tnesse encouraged his men who were
reculed: and in a manner discomfyted / and in his so doing he was wounded to
death. Cap. C.xliii.
Knights and Squyers were of good courage on both parties to fight valyauntly.
cowardes there had no place / but hardynes rayned with goodly feats of arms /
for knights and squiers were so joined to gyder at hand strokes / that
archers had no place of another party. There the scotts showed great hardynesse
/ and feught meryly / with great desire of honor. the englysshmen were three to
one / how be it I say not but englysshmen did nobly acquyte them self for
ever the englysshmen had rather ben slain or taken in the place / than to
fly. Thus as I have said the baners of Duglas and Percy and their men / were
met each against other / enuyous who should win the honor of that journey.
At the beginning the englysshemen were so strong / that they ^eculed back
their enemies. Than the Earl Duglas who was of great heart and high of
enterprise / seeing his men recule back / than to recover the place and to
show knightly valor / he took his are in both his hands and entered so in to
ye prease / that he made him self way / in such wise / that none durst
aproche nere him / and he was so well armed that he bare well of such strokes
as he received. thus he went ever forward like a hardy Hector / willing a
lone to conquer the field / and to dyscomfyte his enemies. But at last he was
encountered with three spears all at ones / the one struck him on the shulder /
the other on the breast / and the stroke glented down to his belly / and the
third struck him in the thye / and sore hurt with all three strokes / so that
he was borne perforce to the earth / and after that he could not be again
releued. Some of his knights and squyers followed him / but not all / for it
was night and no light / but by the shynynge of the moon. the englisshmen knew
well they had borne one down to the earth / but they wist not who it was / for
if they had known that it had been the earl Duglas / they had been thereof so
joyful and so proud / that the vyctory had been theirs. Nor also the scotts
knew not of that adventure till the end of the battle / for if they had
known it / they should have been so sore dyspayred and dyscoraged / that they
would have fled away. Thus as the earl Duglas was felled to the earth he was
stricken in to the heed with an axe / and another stroke through the thye. The
english men passed for the and took no head of him / they thought none
otherwise / (...) that they had slain a man of arms. On the other part the
earl George de la Ma^^he and of Donbare fought right valyantly / and gave the
englissh men much a do / and cried follow Duglas / and set on the sons of
Percy. Also Earl Johan of Morette with his baner and men fought valyauntly /
and set fyersly on the englisshmen / and gave them so much to do / that they
wyste not to whom to attend.

How in this battle sir Rafe Percye was sore hurt / and taken prisoner by a
scottysshe knight. Cap. C.xliiii.
OF all the bataylles and encountrynges that I have made melicion of here
before in all this hystory / great or small / this battle that I treat of
now / was one of the sorest and best foughten / without cowardes or faynte
hertes. for there was another knight nor squire but that did his deuoyre and
fought hand to hand. this battle was like the battle of Bechercll / the
which was valyauntly fought and endured. The earl of Northumberlandes sons /
sir Henry and sir Rafe Percy / who were chief sovereign capytayns acquyted them
self nobly / and sir Rafe Percy entered in so far among his enemies that he
was closed in / and hurt / and so sore handeled that his brethe was so short
that he was taken prisoner / by a knight of the earl of Morettes / called sir
Johan Makyrell. In the taking the Scottysshe knight demanded what he was (for
it was in the night / so that he knew him not) And sir Rafe was so sore
overcome and bledde fast that at last he said / I am Rafe Percy. Than the
scotte said / sir Rafe reskewe or no reskewe I take you for my prisoner / I am
Makyrell. Well quod sir Rafe I am content / but than take heed to me / for I
am sore hurt / my hosen and my greues are full of blood. Than the knight saw
by him the earl Moret / and said. Sir here I deliver to you sir Rafe Percy as
prisoner / but sir / let good head be taken to him / for he is sore hurt.
The earl was joyful of those words / and said. Makyrell thou have well won
thy spurs. Than he delivered sir Rafe Percy to certain of his men / and they
stopped and wrapped his wounds / And still the battle endured / not knowing
who had as than the better / for there were many taken and reskewed again /
that came to no knowledge.

Now let us speak of the young James earl of Duglas / who did maruayls in
arms or he was beaten down. When he was overthrown the preace was great
about him / so that he could not releue / for with an axe he had his dethes
wound. His men followed him as nere as they could / and there came to him sir
James Lymsey his cosyn / and sir Johan and sir Water saint clear / and other
knights and squiers / and by him was a gentle knight of his who followed him
all the day / and a chapelayne of his / not like a priest / but like a valiant
man of Arms / for all that night he followed the earl with a good are in his
hands / and still skrymysshed about the earl / there as he lay / and reculed
back some of the englisshe men with great strokes that he gave. Thus he was
found fighting nere to his master / whereby he had great praise / and
thereby the same year he was made archedecon of Abredan. This priest was called
sir Willyam of Norbernyche / he was a tall man and a hardy and was sore hurt.
When these knights came to the Earl they found him in an yuell case / and a
knight of his lyenge by him / called sir Roberte Heart / he had a fyftene
wounds in one place and other. Than sir Johan Sayncte clear demanded of the
earl how he did. Right yuell cosyn quod therle / but thanked be god there has
been but a few of mine auncytours that has dyed in their beds. But cosyn /
I require you think to revenge me / for I recon my self but deed / for my
heart faynteth often times / My cosyn water and you I pray you raise up again
my baner / which lies on the ground / and my squire Dauy Collemnie slain.
But syrs / show another to friend nor so in what case ye seem in / for if mine
enemies knew it they would rejoice / and our friends discomforted. The two
brethren of Saint clear and sir James Lymscy did as the earl had desired
them / and raised up again his baner / and cried Duglas. Such as were
behind and herd that cry drew together and set on their enemies valyauntly
/ and reculed back the english men / and many overthrown / and so drove the
english men back beyond the place where as the Earl lay / who was by that
time deed / and so came to the earls baner / the which sir Johan Saint clear
held in his hands / and many good knights and squyers of Scotland about
him / and still company drew to the cry of Duglas. Thither came the earl
Morette with his baner well accompanied / and also the earl de la Mare and of
Donbare. And when they saw the englissh men recule / and their company
assembled together / they renewed again the battle / and gave many hard and
sad strokes.

How the scotts wanne the battle against the english men beside Otteburge
and there was taken prisoners sir Henry and sir Rafe Percy / and how an
English squire would not yield him no more would a scottysshe squier and so
dyed both / and how the bysshope of Durham and his company were discomfyted
among themself. Ca. C.xlv.
TO say troth the englysshmen were sorer trauayled than the scotts / for
they came the same day fro Newcastell upon Tyne / a sire englyssh miles / and
went a great pase / to the entente to find the scotts which they did so that
by their fast going they were nere out of brethe / and the Scotts were
fresshe and well rested / which greatly auayled them / when time was of their
business. For in the last skrymysshe they reeuled back the englysshemen / in
such wise / that after that they could no more assemble together / for the
scotts past through their batayles. And it fortuned that sir Henry Percy and
the lord of Mountcombre a valiant knight of Scotland fought together hand
to hand right valyauntly / without lettynge of any other for every man had
enough to do. So long they two fought that perforce of arms sir Henry Percy
was taken prisoner by the said lord of Mountcomber.

THe knights and squiers of Scotland as sir Mare Adremench / sir Thomas
Auernesquyn / sir Willyam / sir James / and sir Alysander Lymsey / the lord of
Faulcon / for Johan of saint de Laur / sir Patryke of Donbare / sir Johan and
sir Water Saint clear / sir Johan Makyrcll sir Guystewarde / sir Johan
Halebreton sir Alysaunder Ramsey / Roberte Colounnie and his two sons / Johan
and Roberte / who were there made knights / and a hundred knights and squyers
that I can not name. All these right valyauntly did acquyte them self. And on
the english part before that the lord Percy was taken and after / there
fought valyauntly sir Rafe Longeble / sir Mathewe Redman / sir Thomas Ogle /
sir Thomas Gray / sir Thomas Hekon / sir Thomas Abreton / sir Johan Lyerbon /
sir Willyam Walsyngham / the baron of Helcon / sir Johan of Culpedup / the
seneschall of york / and diverse other fotemen. Whereto should I write long
process / this was a sore battle and well foughten? And as fortune is always
chaungeable / though the englisshmen were more in nombre than the scotts / and
were right valiant men of war / and well expert / and that at the first
front they reculed back the scotts / yet finally the scotts optaygned the
place and vyctory / and all the foresaid englysshmen taken and a hundred mo /
saving sir Mathewe Rodman capytayne of Berwyke / who when he knew no remedy
nor recoueraunce / and saw his company fly fro the scotts / and yielded them
on every side / than he took his horse and departed to save him self. The same
season about the end of this dyscomfyture / there was an english squire
called Thomas Veleton / a goodly and a valyant man / and that was well seen /
for of all that night he would another fly nor yet yield him. It was said he
had made a vow at a feast in England / that the first time that ever he saw
englisshe men and scotts in battle / he would / so do his deuoyre to his
power in such wise / that either he would be reputed for the best doer on
both sides / or else to dye in the pain / he was called a valiant and a hardy
man / and did so much by his prowes that under the baner of the earl of
Morette he did such valiantness in arms / that the scotts had maruayle
thereof / and so was slain in fighting. The scotts would gladly have taken
him alive but he would never yield / he hoped ever to have been rescewed. And
with him there was a scottysshe squier slain / cosyn to the king of scotts /
called Simon Glaudyn. His death was greatly complained of the scotts. This
battle was fierce and cruel till it came to the end of the discomfyture /
but when the scotts saw the englysshmen recule and yield themself / than the
scotts were curtes / and set them to their ransom / and every manne said
to his prisoner. Syrs / go and unarm you and take your case / I am your
master / and so made their prisoners as good chere as though they had been
brethren / without doing to the^ any do^mage. The chas^^ndured a five english
miles / and if ye scotts had been men ynowe there had none escaped / but outher
they had been taken or slain: And if Archambault Duglas and the earl of Fen /
the earl Surlant and other of the great company (who were gone toward
Carlyle) had been there / by all lykelyhode they had taken the bishop of
Durham / and ye town of Newcastell upon time. I shall show you how. The same
euenyng that the Percyes deperted fro Newcastell (as ye have herd before) the
bishop of Durham with the rerebande ca^e to Newcastell and supped. And as he
satte at the table he had ymagmacion in him self / how he did not acquit him
self well to se the English men in the field / and he to be within the
town. Incontinent he caused the table to be taken away / and commanded to
sadell his horses / and to sown the tru^pettes / and called up men in the
town to arm them self and to mount on their horses / and foot men to order
them self to depart. And thus every man departed out of the town / to the
nombre of seuyn thousand: two thousand on horseback and Five thousand a
foot. They took their way toward Ottenbourg where as the battle had been /
and by that time they had gone two mile from Newcastell / tidings came to
them / how their men were fighting with the scotts. There with the bishop
rested there / and incontinent came mo flyeng fast / that they were out of
brethe. Than they were demanded how the matter went: they answered and
said. Right yuell. We be all disconfyted. Here comes the scotts chasynge of
us. These tidings troubled the Englysshmen and began to doubt. And again the
third time men came flyeng as fast as they might. Whan^e the men of the
bysshoprike of Durham herd of these yuell tidings they were abashed / in
such wise / that they brake their array / so that the bishop could not
hold together the nombre of five hundred. It was thought that if the scotts
had followed them in any nombre: seeing that it was night that in thentryng in to
the town / and the Englissh men so abashed / the town had been won.

The bysshope of Durham being in the field had good will to have socoured the
englysshmen / and reco^forted his men asmoche as he could / but he saw his
own men fly as well as other. Than he demanded cousaile of sir Wyllyam
Lussey and of sir Thomas Clyfforde and of other knights / what was was best to
do. These knights for their honor would give him no counsel / For they
thought to return again and do nothing / should sown greatly to their blame
/ and to go for the might be to their great do^mage / and so stood still and
would give none answer. and the lengar they stood the fewer they were / for
some still stale away. Than the bishop said. Sirs / all things considred /
it is none honor to put all in parell / nor to make of one yuell dommage
twain. We here how our company be disconfyted / and we can not remedy it: For
to go to recover them / we know not with whom nor with what nombre we shall
mete. Let us return fair and easily for this night to Newcastell and to
more we let us draw toguyder and go look on our enemies. Every man answered
/ as god will so be it. Therewith they returned to Newcastell. Thus a man may
consider the great defaute that is in men / yt be abashed and disconfyted. For
if they had kept them together / and have turned again such as fled / they
had disconfyted the scotts. This was the opynion of diverse. And because they
did not thus / the scotts had the vyctorie.

How sir Mathue Reedman deperted fro the battle to save him self / and how
sir James Lymsaye was taken prisoner by the bishop of Durhame: And how
after the bataile scurrers were sent forth to discover the country. Cap.
C.xlvi.
I Shall show you of sir Mathewe Reedman / who was on horsbacke to save
himself / for he alone could not remedy the matter. At his departing sir James
Lymsay was nere to him / and saw how sir Mathue deperted. And this sir James
to win honor / followed in chase sir Mathue Reedman / and came so nere him /
that he might have stryken him with his spear if he had list. Than he said. Ah
sir knight turn / it is a shame thus to fly. I am James of Lymsay / if ye
will not turn / I shall stryke you on the back with my spear. Sir Mathewe
spoke no word / but struck his horse with the spurs sorer than he did
before. In this manner he chased him more than three miles. And at last sir
Mathue Reedmans horse founvred and fell under him. Than he stepte forth on ye
earth and drew out his sword and took courage to defend h^mselfe: And the
scotte thought to have seryken him on the breast / but sir Mathewe Reedman
swarued fro the stroke / and the spear point entered in to the earth: Than sir
Mathue stroke a sonder the spear with his sword. And when sir James Lymsay
saw how he had lost his spear: He cast away the tro^chon and lyghted a
foot / and took a l^tell bacayle are that he carried at his back / and handeled
it with his one hand / quickly and delyuerly / in the which feace scotts be
well expert. And than he set at sir Mathue / and he defended him self
properly. Thus they tourneyed toguyder / one with an are and the other with a
sword / a long season / and no man to let them. Finally sir James Lymsay
gave the knight such strokes / and held him so short / that he was put out
of brethe / in such wise / that he yielded him self and said. Sir James
Lymsay / I yield me to you. Well quod he / and I receive you / rescue or no
rescue. I am content quod Reedman / so ye deal with me like a good companyon.
I shall not fail that quod Lymsay / and so put up his sword. Well sir quod
Reedman / what will you now that I shall do? I am your prisoner / ye have
conquered me. I would gladly go again to Newcastell / and within fyftene days
I shall come to you in to Scotland where as ye shall assign me. I am content
quod Lymsay: ye shall promise by your faith to present your self within
this.iii. wekes at Ede^borowe: And where soever ye go to repute yourselfe my
prisoner. All this sir Mathue swear and promised to fulfill. Than each of them
took their ho^ses and took leave each of (...). Sir James returned / and his
intent was to go to his own company the same way that he came / and sir
Mathewe Reedman to Newcastell. Sir James Lymsaye could not keep the right way
as he came / it was dark and a mist: And he had not rydden half a mile /
but he met face to face with the bishop of Durham / and mo than.v. hundred
Englysshmen with him. He might well escaped if he had would: But he supposed it
had been his own company that had pursued the Englysshmen. When he was among
the^ one demanded of him what he was. I am quod he sir James Lymsay. The
bishop herd those words / and stepte to him and said Lymsay ye are taken /
yield ye to me. Who be you quod Lymsay? I am quod he the bishop of Durham. And
fro whens come you sir quod Lymsay? I come fro the battle quod the bishop /
but I stroke never a stroke there. I (...) back to Newcastell for this night /
and ye shall go with me. I may not chose quod Lymsay sith ye will have it so.
I have taken and I am taken / such is the adventures of arms. Whom have ye
taken quod the bishop? sir quod he I took in the chase sir Mathue Redman: And
where is he quod the bishop? by my faith sir he is returned to Newcastell /
he desired me to trust him on his faith for three wekes / and so have I done.
Well quod the bishop / let us go to Newcastell and there ye shall speak with
him. Thus they read to Newcastell toguyder / and sir James Lymsay was prisoner
to the bishop of Durham.

Under the baner of therle de la mare and of Do^bare / was taken asquer of
Gascone called John^ of Newcastell. And under the baner of the earl of Moret
was taken his companyon John^ de Cauteron. Thus the field was clean avoided or
the day apered. The scotts drew together and took guydes and sent out
scurrers to se if any men were in the way fro Newcastell to the intent that
they would not be troubled in their lodgings / wherein they did wisely. For
when ye bishop of Durham was come again to Newcastell and in his lodging /
he was sore pe^syfe / and wist not what to say nor do: For he herd say how
his cosyns ye Percies were slain or taken / and all ye knights yt were with
the^. Than he sent for all ye knights and squyers that were in the town / And
when they were come he demanded of the^ / if they should leave the matter in
that case / and said. Sirs / we shall bear great blame / if we thus return
without lokynge on our enemies. Than they concluded by the son rysynge /
every manne to be armed / and on horse back and a foot / to depart out of the
town / and to go to Octenbourge to fight with the scotts. this was warned
through the town by a trumpet / and every man armed them and assembled before
the bridge: And by the son rysynge they departed by the gate toward Berwyke
/ and took the way toward Octebourge / to the nombre of ten thousand /
what a foot and a horse back. They were not gone paste two mile fro
Newcastell / when the scotts were sygnefyed that the bishop of Durham was
coming to them ward to fight. This they knew by their spies / such as
they had set in the feldes.

AFter that sir Mathewe Reedman was returned to Newcastell / and had showed
to diverse / how he had been taken prisoner by sir James Lymsey. Than it was
showed him how the bisshoppe of Durham had taken the said sir James Lymsey:
and how that he was there in the town as his prisoner. As soon as the
bishop was departed / sir Mathue Reedman went to the bysshoppes lodgyng to
se his master / And there he found him in a study / lyeng in a wyndowe and
said. What sir James Lymsay what make you here? Than sir James came forth of
the study to him and gave him good morrow / and said. By my faith sir Mathewe
/ fortune has brought me hyder: For as soon as I was departed fro you / I
met by chance ye bishop of Durham / to whom I am prisoner / as ye be to
me. I believe ye shall not need to come to Edenborowe to me to make your
fynaunce. I think rather we shall make an exchange one for another: if the
bishop be so content. Well sir quod Reedman / we shall accord right well
toguyder / ye shall dyne this day with me. the bishop and our men be gone
forth to fight with your men / I can not tell what shall fall / we shall know
at their return. I am content to dyne with you quod Lymsay. Thus these two
knights dyned toguyder in Newcastell.

When the knights of Scotla^de were informed how the bishop of Durham came
on them with.x. thousand men / they drew to counsel to se what was best for
them to do / outher to deperte or else to abide the adventure. All things
consydred / they concluded to abide / For they said they could not be in a
better nor a stronger place than they were in already. They had many prisoners /
and they could not carry them away if they should have departed. And also
they had many of their men hurt: and also some of their prisoners / who^e
they thought they would not leave behind them. Thus they drew toguyder / and
ordered so their field / that there was no enter but one way / and they set
all their prisoners toguyder. And made them to promise how that rescue or no
rescue they should be their prisoners. after that they made all their mynstrels
to blow up all atones / and made the greattest revel of the world. Lightlye
it is the usage of scotts / that when they be thus assembled toguyder in arms
/ the foot men bears about their necks homes / in manner like hunters / some
great some small / and of all sorts: so that when they blow all at ones /
they make such a noise / that it may be herd nighe.iiii. miles of. thus they
do to abass he their enemies and to rejoice them selfs. When the bishop of
Durham with his baner and.x.M. men with him / were aproched with in a leage /
than ye scott^s blewe their horns / in such wise / that it seemed that all the
deuyls in hell had been among them / so that such as herd them and knew not
of their usage / were sore abashed. This blowyng and noise endured a long
space / and than cessed. And by that time the^glysshmen were within less than
a mile / than ye scotts began to blow again and made a great noise and as
long endured as it did before. Than the bishop aproched with his battle well
rainged i^ good order / and came within ye sight of ye scotts / as within.ii.
bow shot or less / than ye scotts blewe again their horns a long space. ye
bishop stood still to se what the scotts would do and auewed the^ well / and
saw how they were in a strong ground / greatly to their advantage. Than
the bishop took counsel / what was best for him to do. But thing well
aduysed / they were not in purpose to enter in among the scotts to assail
them / but returned without doing of any thing / for they saw well they
might rather lose than wyn. When the scotts saw the English men recule /
and that they should have no battle: They went to their lodgings and made
merry / and than^e ordained to depart fro thens: And because that sir Rafe
Percy was sore hurt / he desired of his master that he might return to
Newcastell or in to some place / where as it pleased him / unto such time as he
were hole of his hurtes. Promising / as son as he were able to ride to
return in to Scotland / outher to Edenborowe or in to any other place
appointed. The earl of Mare / vuder whom he was taken / agreed thereto / and
delivered him a horse lytter and sent him a way. And by like covenant diverse
other knights and squyers were suffered to return / and took term outher to
return / or else to pay their fynau^ce / such as they were apoy^ted unto. It
was showed me by the informacyon of the scotts / such as had been at this
said battle / that was between Newcastell and Octeburge / in the year of our
lord god a thousand three hundred fourscore and viii. the.xix. day of August:
Now yt there were taken prisoners of the Englisshe party. M. and.xl. men one
and other. And slain in the field and in the chase.xviii. hundred and.xl. and
sore hurt mo than a thousand. And of the scotts there were a hundred slain
/ and taken in the chase mo than two hundred: for as the Englysshmen fled
when they saw any aduautage / they returned again and fought. By that means
the scotts were taken and none otherwise. Every man may well consydre that it
was a well fought field when there were so many slain and taken on both
parties.

How the scotts departed and carried with them therle Duglas deed and buried
him in the abbey of Nimays: And how sir Archambault Duglas and his company
departed fro before Carlyle / and returned in to Scotland. Cap. C.xlvii.
AFter this battle thus furnysshed / every man returned: And the earl Duglas
deed body chested and laid in a chare / and with him sir Robert Heart and Simon
Glaudyn. Than they prepared to depart. So they departed and led with them
sir Henry Percy / and mo than.xl. knights of England / and took the way to
the abbey of Nimay. At their de partynge they set fire in their lodgings and
rode all the day / and yet lay that night in the English ground / none
denied the^. The next day they dislodged early in the morning / and so came
that day to Nimay / It is an abbey of black monks on the border between
both realms. There they rested / and buried the earl James Duglas. The
second day after his obsequye was done reuere^tly / and on his body laid a
tomb of stone / and his baner hangyng over him. Wheder there were as than any
mo Earls of Duglas / to whom the land returned or not / I can not tell. For
I sir John^ Froissart auctour of this book was in Scotland in ye earls castle
of Alquest / lyueng earl Wyllm^ / at which time he had two children / a son
and a dought: but after there were many of the duglasses / for I have seen a.v.
brethren all squiers bearyng ye name of Duglas / in ye king of Scotla^des
house David. they were sons to a knight in Scotla^de called sir James Duglas.
and they bare in their arms gold / three oreyls goules / but as for ye
heritage I know not who had it. As for sir Archambalt Duglas of whom I have
spoken before in this hysto^ie in diverse places / who was a valyant knight /
and greatly redouted of the englysshmen / he was but a bastard.

When these scotts had been at Nymaye abbey / and done there all that they
came thither for. Than they departed each fro other and went in to their own
countries / and such as had prisoners some led them away with them / and
some were rau^somed and suffered to return. Thus the English men found the
scotts right curtesse and gentle / in their delyueraunce and ransom / so
that they were well content. This was showed me in the country of Bierne in
the earl of Foiz house / by a knight named Johan of Newcastell / who was taken
prisoner at the same journey / under the baner of the earl of Mare and Donbare
/ and he greatly praised the said earl / for he suffered him to pass in manner /
as he desired him self.

Thus these men of war of Scotland departed and raunsomed their prisoners /
as soon as they might right curttesly / and so returned little and little in
to their own countries. And it was showed me / and I believe it well / that the
scotts had by reason of that journey / two hundred thousand frankes for
raunsomyng of prisoners. For sithe the battle that was before Streuelyne in
Scotland / where as sir Robert of Breuce / sir Wyllyam Duglas / sir Robert
Versey / sir Simon Freseyle / and other scotts chased the Englysshmen three
days / they never had journey so profitable nor so honorable for the^ / as
this was. When tidings came to the other company of the scotts that were
beside Carlyle / how their company had distressed the English men beside
Octeburgh / they were greatly reioysed / and displeased in their minds / that
they had not ben there. Than they determined to dislodge and to draw in to
their own countries / seeing their other company were withdrawn. thus they
dislodged and entered in to Scotla^de.

Now let us leave to speak of the scotts and of the English men for this
time / and let us return to the young Charles of France / who with a great
people went in to Almaygne to bring the duke of Guerles to reason.

When the French king and all his army were paste the river of Muese at the
bridge of Morsay / they took the way of Ardayn and of Lusenbourgh / and
always the pyoners were before beatynge woods and busshes / and making the
ways plain. The duke of Iulyers and his country greatly douted the coming of
the French king: For they knew well they should have the first assault and
bear the first burdone / and the land of Iulyers is a plain country. In one
day the men of war should do much do^mage there / and distroye and wast all /
except the castelles and good towns. Thus the French king entered in to the
country of Lusenbourgh / and came to an abbey where as Vyncelant sometime duke
of Brabant was buried / there the king tarried two days. Than he departed and
took the way through Basconque / and lodged within a leage where as the
duches of Brabant lay / S^e sent word of her being there to ye duke of
Burgoyn / and he brought her in to the field to speak with the king / who
received her right honorably / and there co^muned together. Than the duches
returned to Basconque / and thither she was conveyed with sir John^ of Vyen and
sir Guy of Tremoile. And the next day the king went forward / aprochyng to
the land of his enemies / and came to the^ cryng in to Almayne / on the
fronters of ye duchy of Iulyers. but or he came so far forward / Arnolde
bishop of Liege had been with ye king and had greatly entreated for the duke
of Iuliers / that the king should not be miscontent with him / though he were
father to the duke of Guerles / for he excused him of the deflau^ce that his
son had made affyrmyng / how it was not by his knowledge nor consent. Wherefore
he said / it were pytie that the father should bear the defaut of the son.
This excuse was not suffycient to the king nor to his uncles / For the intent
of the king and his counsel was / without ye duke of Iulyers would come and
make other manner of excuse / and to yield him self to ye kings pleasure / his
country should be the first that should bear the burdone. Thanne the
bishop of Liege and the lords of Hasbane / and the counsayls of the good
towns / offered to the king and his counsel / holly the bysshoprike of Liege
/ for his army to pass and repasse / payeng for their expenses: and to rest
and refresshe them there / as long as it pleased them. The king thanked them
and so did his uncles / and would not refuse their offer / for he knew not
what need he should have after.

How the duke of Iulyers came and excused him self / of the defyau^ce that
his son^e the duke of Guerles had made to the French king / and so became his
subject: and of diverse feats of arms done between the frenchmen and the
almayns before Rencongne. Cap. C.xlviii.
THus the bisshoppe of Liege returned to the duke of Iullyers and to the
archebysshoppe of Coloigne / and showed the^ what he had done and thereupon they
took advise. The duke of Iuliers had great dout of cryling and wastyng of his
country / and sent for the knights of his country to have their counsel
and advise / and daily the Frenchmen aproched. The lord of Coucy who was in ye
vowarde and with him a thousand spears / and the duke of Lorayne with him:
and the vicount of Meaulx with two hundred spears. When the French men
aproched the fronters of Almayne / than they rode toguyder in good order and
lodged wisely / for there were a three hundred spears of lynsars almayns /
beyond the river of Ryne gathered toguyder. And they be noted to be the
greattest pyllers and robbers of all the world: And they always pursued and
coosted the Frenchmen to find them dispurueyed / to do them do^mage. The
French men douted the same / and durst never go ^ forragyng but in great
companyes. And as I understood sir Boucequant the elder and sir Loyes of Grache
/ were retained and brought to Nimay. these said almayns rode always covertly
/ like birds flyeng in ye air sekyng for their pray. This made the French
men wise and to be well ware. Thus when the French king was come so forward /
as to the enter of the duchy of Iulyers / The duke of Iulyers who would not
lose his country / believed the counsel of the archebysshoppe of Coloyne and
the bishop of Liege. These two entreated for him to ye king and brought the
matter to that point / that his lands were in rest and peace / by means of
such condycions as follows. These two prelates did so much / yt they
brought the duke of Iulyers in to the kings presence and before his uncles and
the duke of Lorayne / and other great lords of France of ye blood royal. And
when he was before the king he kneled down / and wisely excused him of the
defyau^ce that his son had made / and said how his son was a fool / and
that he had never counsel of him to do as he did / but did it of his own
will: and offered ye king / saying. Sir / to the intent to bring him to ye
knowledgynge of reason / by your license I will go to him and show him his
folly / as quickly as I can / and counsel him to come and make his excuse
before your grace and your counsel. And if he will not thus do / but do
against my counsel / I shall abandon to you all the towns and castles in my
country / and to provide for men of war / and to make war against him /
till ye have taken him to mercy. Than the king regarded his brother / his
uncles / and his counsel and it seemed to him that this offer was fair and
reasonable / and so thought diverse other. Than the king took up the duke of
Iulyers (who was on his kne / while he spoke to the king) and said to him. Sir
/ we shall take counsel and advise on your promyses and words. Than the duke
rose up and stood still by the bysshoppes that brought him thither. Than the
king and his uncles / and such of his secret counsel drew toguyder and
debated this matter long / with diverse opinions The duke of Burgoyne to whom
principallye the matter touched / because of the duchy of Brabant / wherein he
chale^ged to have great right of enherytaunce / after the death of the duches
Jane / because of the lady Margaret his wife: and also to say the truth / he
was the chief causer of the kings coming thither with all yt puissau^ce.
Wherefore he would that every thing might be for the best and to thentent that a
good peace might be made bitwene all perties / that there should be no more
occasyon to come thither again another time because the voyage is long and
costly for the realm: Than he said to the king. Sir / and it like your grace
and you my brother of Berrey / and to you all I say / that in all things
yuell begone / lies great advise. We here how our cosyn the duke of Iulyers
greatly exscuseth himself / and he is so valyant a man and of our blood / and
we of his / that we ought to believe him. He offers to the king a great thing
/ his body / his country / his towns and castelles / to be at the kings
commandment / in case that his son the duke of Guerles will rebel / and
come not to make amends of the defyaunce that he has made. To speak acordynge
to reason / it is a great thing / to have with us the duke of Iuliers / the
duke of Guerles shall be the more feeble / and the easyer to correct / and the
more he shall dought us / and sooner come to obeysaunce. wherefore I counsel
that his offer be not refused / for he mekely humyleth himself / and other
great lords of Almayne entreat for him. To these words there was no
contrary opynyons / but all consented by one acorde. Than the bysshoppes of
Coloygne and of Liege were called to their counsel / who had been chyefe
entreatours in this busynes / and to them it was declared fro point to point
/ and from clause to clause / what things ye duke of Iulyers should swear and
seal to do / if he would have his lands saved / and to be in rest. First /
that he should go to his son the duke of Guerles and show him plainly his
folly / and the great outrage that he had done / to send to defye so puyssau^t
a prince as the french king / and specially by such fell defyaunce / out of
the style of right or reason / and to cause him to come to reason and mercy.
And if he would not thus do / but abide still in his opinion (through feeble
wit and counsel) than the duke of Iulyers to swear and seal to renounce
him fro all aid or socoure that he might do / and to become his enemy / as
other be / and to suffer such as shall be appointed by the king and his
counsel to abide there all this winter / to lie in garysons in the country
of Iulyers / to make frounter war against the duke of Guerles / and there to
be well entreated and received.

THese two prelates were called to the kings counsel / to the entente that
they should show to the duke of Iulyers these artycles / and so they did. And
than the duke saw well how that it behooved him to agree / or else to have his
lands over tynne and wasted / wherefore he acorded and swear and sealed to
uphold all the kings desire / so that his land should not be ouerron nor
exyled / and he was content that his land should vytayle the army. Thus the
duke of Iulyers became the french kings man / and made relyefe for his land
of Vierson / being between Bloys and Berrey / and supped that night at the
kings table. First sat the bishop of Liege and the bishop of Coloygne
/ than the king / the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Thowrayn / the duke of
Iuliers / and the duke of Burbone.

THus the duke of Iulyers was in rest and pease by the foresaid means / and
the king and his army were lodged in his country / the which was pleasant
and plentyfull of all vytayles. Than the duke of Iulyers went toward the
duke of Guerles his son / But or he came there / there was diverse feats of
arms done in the country / for the almayns who be couetouse / oftentimes by
night or by day would ieoparde them self and set on the french men's
lodgings to keep them waking / and sometime they wanne and some time they
lost. But for one almayne that was taken / there were ever four frenchmen
taken. And on a day the constable of France and the lord Coucy / the duke of
Lorayne / the marshall of Blainuill / sir Johan of Vien / sir Johan de la
Tremoyle / and a four thousand men of arms came before a town in Guerles
called Renconge / and showed them self before it in good order of battle. The
same time ye duke of Guerles was within the town / and praised much their
demeanor / but he made none issue out / for he had not men ynowe whereof he was
right sore dyspleased. Thus the french men were there in good order of battle
the space of four hours / and when they saw that none would issue out / they
departed and returned to their lodgings. The same evening about the duke of
Berreys lodgyng / certain knights and squyers drew together / to the intent
to ride forth in the morning in to the land of their enemies to seek some
adventure / and promised each other to stycke together like brethren. They
were in nombre about a hundred spears. But when the morning came all their
purpose was broken / for there was a squire of Auuergne called Godinos a
valiant man of arms / he pertayned to the lord of Alegre. when he saw that
they had refused his company / and would not desire him to go with them / he
was sore dyspleased / and brake his mind to a another sort of companyons / so
that they were to the nombre of thyrty spears. They tode forth together / and
rode all that morning and could find none adventure. And when Godynos saw
that they should return without doing of any feate / he was sore dyspleased
/ and said to his company. Syrs / ride on fair and easily / and I with my
page will ride about this wode / to se if any enbusshe be hydden therein / and
tarry me upon yonder Mountain. They agreed to him. Thus he and his page rode
forth costynge the wode. When he had rydden a little way / he herd one why
stell in the wode / and struck his horse with the sportes / and came to the
side of the wode / and there he found an almayne guetloys cuttynge of wode.
Than Godynos took his glay^e and came ry^nynge at this man / whereof the man was
sore abashed. Than Godynos made sign to him that he should go with him / and
thought that this companyons yet should se that he had found somewhat / and
thought the same manne should do them some service in their lodgings / and so
Godynos rode on before on a low hackeney / and the almayne followed him a foot
with a hewynge axe on his neck / wherewith he had wrought in the wode. Godinos
page lepte on his masters courser and bare his bassenette and spear / and
followed them half slepynge / because he had risen so early. And the almayn who
knew not whyder he should go / nor what they would do with him / thought to
deliver himself / and came fair and easily to Godynos / and lift up his are
and struck him such a stroke on the heed that he claue it to the teth / and so
ouerthrewe him stark deed / the page knew not thereof till he saw his master
fall. Than the vyllayne fled in to the wode and saved himself. This
adventure fell to Godinos / wherewith such as knew him were sore dyspleased /
and specially they of Auuergne / for he was the man of arms that was most
doughted of the englisshmen in those parties / and he that did them most
damage. If he had been in prisone he should have been quyted out / and if it had
been for twenty thousand frankes. Now let us return to the duke of
Iulyers.

How the duke of Iuliers and the archebysshop of Coloygne departed fro the
french king / and went to Nymay to the duke of Guerles / and how by their
means he was reconsyled and brought to peace with the french king and with
the duches of Brabante. Cap. C.xlix.
YE know well / as it has been showed here before / how the duke of Iulyers
made his peace with the french king / by means of the bysshoppes that treated
in that behalf / and also to say the truth / the duke of Lorayne his cosyn
took great pain in the matter. And (as ye have herd) the duke promised to go
to his son the duke of Guerles / and to cause him to come to the kings mercy
/ or else to make him war. Thus the duke of Iulyers was feign to promise / or
else all his country had been lost. Thus the duke of Iulyers and the
archbysshoppe took their journey to go in to Guerles / and passed the river and
came to Nymay / where as the duke was / who received his father with great joy
as he was bound to do / for there is nothing so nere a man as his father and
mother. But he was nothing glad of that he herd how that the duke his father
was agreed with the french king. Than the duke of Iuliers and the bishop
showed him at length the hole matter in what case he and his land stood in. He
made little thereof / for he was so sore alyed with the king of England that he
would not forsake him / for his heart was good english / and so excused him
self greatly / and said to his father. sir / let me alone / I will abide the
adventure / and if I take damage by reason of the french kings coming / I am
young enough to bear it / and to be revenged herafter on some part of the
realm of France / or upon my neighbors the brabansoys. there is no lord
can keep war without some damage / sometime lose / and sometime win. When
his father the duke of Iulyers herd him so styffe in his opinion / he was sore
dyspleased with him / and said. Son Willyam / for whom make you your war?
and who be they that shall revenge your damage? Sir quod he / the king of
England and his puysaunce / and I have great maruayle that I here no tidings
of the english army that is on the sea / for if they were come as they have
promised me to do / I would have wakened the french men oftener thanne ones or
this time. What quod his father / do you trust and abide for the englysshmen?
they are so besyed in every quarter / that they wot not to whom to entende.
The duke of Lancastre our cosyn / lies at Bayon or at Bordeaux / and is
returned out of Spain in a small order / and has lost his men and time / and
he has sent in to England for to have mo men of arms and archers / and he
can not get to the nombre of.xx. spears. Also the english men have had but
late in plain battle a great damage in Northumberlande / for all their
chyualry about Newcastell upon Tyne were overthrown / and slain and taken /
so that as now the realm of England is not in good quyete nor rest.
Wherefore it is not for you to trust at this time on the english men / for of
them ye shall have no comfort. Wherefore I counsel you to be ruled by us /
and we shall make your peace with the french king / and shall do so much that
ye shall nouther receive shame nor damage. Sir quod the duke of Guerles / how
may I with mine honor acorde with the French king though I should lose all
my hole land / and go dwell in some other place? surely I will not do it / I
am to sore alyed with the king of England / and also I have defied the
french king. Think you that for fear of him I should revoke my words / or
break my seal? ye would I should be dyshonored? I require you let me alone: I
shall defend my self right well against them: I set little by their
thretenynges. The waters / and raynes / and cold wethers shall so fight for me
/ or the time of Ianyuer come / that they shall be so weary / that the hardyest
of them shall wysshe them self at home in their own houses.

THus at the beginning of this treaty the duke of Iuliers and the bishop
of Coloyne could not break the duke of Guerles purpose / and yet they were
with him a six days / and every day in counsel. And when the duke of
Iulyers saw no otherways / he began sore to argue against his son and said.
Son / if ye will not believe me surely I shall dysplease you / and as for your
enherytaunce of the duchy of Iulyers / ye shall never have one foot thereof /
but rather I shall give it to a stranger / who shall be of puyssaunce to
defend it against you. ye are but a fool if ye will not believe my counsel.
When the duke of Guerles saw his father inflamed with ire / than to apease his
displeasure said. Sir / than counsel me to mine honor / and at your desire I
shall lean thereto / for sir Iowe to you all obeysaunce and will do. Than the
duke of Iulyers said. Son / now ye speak as ye should do / and I shall look
for your honor asmoche as I would do for mine own. Than it was devised by
great delyberacion of counsel / that for to save the honor on all parties /
that the duke of Guerles should go to the french king and to do him honor
and reverence / as he ought to do to a King / and to make his excuse of the
defyaunce that he had sent to the king / and to say after this manner. Sir /
true it is there was a letter at a time sealed with my seal sent in to
France / which came to your knowledge / in the which letter was contaygned
defyaunce / pertaining to your grace and to your realm / with words
unreasonable / out of the right style and usage that princes and lords defy
each other / the which I will not auowe ye ever any such words passed out of
my mouth / nor by my commandment / any word touching or defamynge your
name or signory: and sir / to veryfye that this mine excuse is of truth / and
that it may be had out of all suspecte / I shall declare the truth of every
thing. Sir / by reason of the great alyaunce and service that I have borne to
my right redouted lord the King of England / at his request and his
counsayls / I sent in to England four of my knights / and delivered them my
seal to seal to any thing that they concluded upon / they sealed this letter
and not I / for I never knew before the sealynge of that letter / what was
contained therein. Sir / I require your grace accept this excuse for this is
true. but sir / as for the aliaunce and service that I have made to my lord
the king of England I will never break it / nor do contrary to that he
commands me. But sir / at his request and commandment I will defye you or
any other when it shall please him who so ever they be / except mine own
natural lord the king of Almayne to whom I am made servant by my mouth
spoken / and by mine hands in his. But sir for the honor of you /
considering and in recompensynge the pains and traueyls that ye have
sustained in your journey coming hyder / to know the foundation and truth
of the defyaunce / I shall swear to you and keep it / that I shall never make
war against you nor defye you / but first ye shall be signyfyed thereof an
hole year before. And sir / me think this should suffyce you. To this deuyse
the duke of Guerles said / I am well content thus to do / in this there in no
dishonor nor blame to me / as I think.

THus on this point departed the duke of Iulyers from his son the duke of
Guerles / and with him the archebysshoppe of Coloygne / and so they returned in
to Iulyers and came to Endesker. And when time was they went to the french
king / and showed him all the points and artycles before rehearsed / and said.
Sir / look what ye will do with the duke of guerles / for other than this ye
shall not have of him. The french king greatly desired to se the duke of
Guerles his cosyn / by cause he had put him to somoche pain / wherefore the
sooner he enclyned to this treatye. And the duke of Burgoyn who would also that
the duches of Brabant and her country should a bide in rest and peace / he
took pain to bring this creatie to effect / and yt the duke of Guerles might
come to speak with the king. And also there was one thing that made them the
sooner agree / winter aproched and the nyghtes began to be long and cold / and
also the lords of France were enfourmed that Guerles was no country to rest
in / in the time of winter. and also daily they had report how they lost of
their men / both knights and squyers by the synsars almayns / who daily lay
in wait for them. So many reasons and consyderacyons were laid and alleged
that they fell to acorde / and the duke of Guerles aproched and the duke of
Iulyers his father / and the duke of Lorayne and the bishop of Coloigne
brought him in to the kings tente / where there was with the king his three
uncles / and his brother the duke of Tourayne and the duke of Bare / the earl
of March / the earl of saint Pole / the earl dolphyn of Auuergne / the lord
Coucy / and the constable of France. There the duke of Guerles kneled down
before the king / and as it was infourmed me / the king took him up / and
there valyauntly and wisely he exscused him self of the defyaunce that he had
made to the king. And moreover he swear / that if ever he would defye the
king or make war to the realm of France / that he would give the king
knowledge thereof a year before / and the countries of Guerles and Brabante to be
still in the same case / as they be in at that same present time. Thus the
matter concluded between them. and the duke of Guerles supped with the king the
same night at his table / he was greatly regarded / because he had put the
king to so much pain and cost. This treaty and conclusyon was put in
writynge and sealed / and when all was done the lords took leave to depart.
but or they departed the duke of Guerles demanded of the king / that all
such prisoners as the French men had taken in that war / that he might have
them delivered frank and free. He had his desire / they were delivered. Thanne
the king demanded of the duke / that all such prisoners as his men had taken
in that voyage should be delivered and rendered again. Than the duke of Guerles
excused him self / and said. Sir that I can not do / I am but a poor man /
and when I knew of your coming I fortifyed my self the best I might with
men of war / knights and squyes fro beyond the river of Ryne / and other
places / and I promised them that what so ever they wanne in this war / it
should be their own. wherefore I can take nothing fro them of that they have
won / if I would / I have nouther puyssaunce nor power to do it / for if I
would show rygoure to them / they would make war against me. wherefore sir /
may it please you to let it pass / for I can not remedy it. The king saw
he could have nothing else / he suffered it to pass / and imagyned that he and
his realm were rich enough to increase poor men / wherefore he let it pass /
and spoke no mo words / and at their departure each of them well contented
other. Than it was ordained to dyslodge and to return the same way they came
/ and than it was said that the french king should be at the city of Reins
at the feast of all saints / and there to hold a great feast. Thus every man
dyslodged and returned. Now let us speak of the english army on the sea.

How the earl of Arundell and the knights of England being on the sea / by
fortune of the wind came to the Palyce beside Rochell / whose being there was
signified to sir Loys of Xanser / and of the departing of the earl of
Arundell. Cap. C.l.
IN the mean seasone while the french king was in Guerles / the english army
was on the sea / whereof the earl of Arundell was chief capytayne / and some
time sailed forward / and sometime bacwarde / as the wind would serve them /
to seek for adventures / as it is well known. Always lightly between the feast
of saint Remey and all saints / is a peryllous season for storms and wyndes
on the sea / and about the same time there rose such a tempeste / that it
sperkled abroad the english navy in such wise / that the hardyest marynere
there was sore abashed / so that perforce they were constreyned to seek for
land. And the earl of Arundell with.xxvii. vessels with him / whether they
would or not / were feign to cast ancre in a little haven called the Palyce /
a two small leages fro Rochell / and ye wind was so streynable on see board /
that they could not depart thence. When tidings thereof came to Rochell /
they were in great dought at the first / lest the englisshmen would come on
them and do them great damage / and closed their gates and held them shytte a
day and a half. Than other tidings came to them fro them of Palyce / how the
englysshemen were but.xxvii. vessels / and came thither by force of wind and
wether / and tarried for nothing but to de part again / and that the Earl of
Arundell was there / and the lord Henry Beamonde / sir Willyam Helmen / and mo
than thyrty knights of England. Than they of Rochell took counsel what
thing was best for them to do / and all thing considered / they said how
they should but easly acquyte themself / if they went not to skrymysshe with
them. The same season before the castle of Bouteuyll / was sir Loys of Xansere
mershall of France / and had besieged within the fortress Gylliam of saint
Foye a gascon / and with the marshall a great company of Poicto^ / of Xayntone
/ of Piergourt / of Rochell / and of the low marches / for all were not gone
in to Almayne with ye knig. This sir Loys was soueraygne capytayne over all the
fronters / between Mountpellyer and Rochell / till the return of the lord
Coucy. They of Rochell sent word to the marshall of the englysshmens being at
Palyce. When he herd thereof he was right joyful / and sent to them that they
should make ready seven or eight galees / and to man them forth / for he would
come by land and fight with the Englisshmen. They of Rochell did as they were
commanded / and sir Loys departed fro his siege / and brake it up / for he
thought it should be more honorable for him to fight with the earl of Arundell
and the english men / rather thanne to contyne we still his siege. Thus be
went to Rochell / and all knights and squyers followed him. I can not tell by
what inspyracyon the earl of Arundell had knowledge / how the marshall of
France with a great puyssaunce of knights and squyers was coming to fight
with him at Palyce / which tidings were not very pleasant to the earl of
Arundell / how be it the wind was some what laid / and the sea aueyled. Than
the earl wayed up ancres and sailed in to the sea / in such good season / that
if he had tarried long after / he had been enclosed in the haven and every man
taken / for in contynent thither came the galees of Rochell / well manned and
furnysshed with artyllery and gonnes / and came straight to the haven of the
Palyce / and found the englisshe men departed. They pursued after a two leages
in the sea and shot gonnes / howebeit they durst not long follow for fear
of enbusshmentes on the sea. Than the french ships returned / and the
marshall of France was sore dyspleased with them of Rochell / that they sent
him word so late. The earl of Arundell took the way by the river of Garon /
to come to Bordeaux / and thereby ye siege before Bowteuyll was defeated / for
Gillonet of saint Foy provided his garyson of that he neded / in the mean time
ye the marshall went to fight with the english men.

Now let us return somewhat to speak of the duke of Lancastre / how he was
in treaty with the spanyardes / and also with the Duke of Berrey / for the
marriage of his daughter. The king of Castyle treated with him for his son
the prince of Castyle / to the intent to have a peace with the englisshe men.
Also the duke of Berrey treated to have the duke of Lancasters daughter for
himself / for he had great desire to be married. And the duke of Lancastre like
a sage imagynat^^e prince / saw well how it was more profitable for England
and for him / to mary his daughter in to Castyle / rather than to the duke of
Berrey / for thereby he / thought to recover the heritage of Castyle in time to
come / for his daughter. And if he should give her to the duke of Berrey / and
the duke fortune to dye / his daughter than should be but a poor lady / to the
regard of other / because the duke of Berrey had children by his first wife /
who should have all the profit. Also the duchess of Lancastre enclyned to the
king of Castyles son. So that when sir Helyon of Lignac was departed fro the
duke of Lancastre / and returned to the duke of Berrey / being as that in
Almayne / than the king of Castyls messa^gers were well herd / in such wise /
that their words were noted and their offers accepted / and the couenaunte
made and sworn between Kateryn of Lancastre and the king of Castylles son /
and writings and public instruments and oblygatory bonds made and concluded
/ with out re^le or repentance. So yt the duches of Lancaster after every
thing set in order / should bring her daughter Kateryn in to Castyle.

All this season the french king was still in the fronters of Iulyers /
concludynge with the duke of Guerles (as ye have herd before) and how they
departed. And as the french men returned / it fortuned on the fronteres of
Almayne on a night about mydnyght / as the moon / ^hone fair / certain
almayns robbers and pyllers / that did set another by peace nor war / but
always sought for their advantage / some pertaining to the lord of
Blaqueneuen / and to sir Peter of Conebech / they were well horsed / and came
and aduysed the french host / and where they might have most profit and
advantage / and so passed by the lodgyng of the vycount of Meaulx / and saw
no styringe / and returned without any noise making / outher passing or
retournynge / and came again to their enbusshe / and showed them what they had
seen and founde^ and incontynente these almayns came and entered at their
advantage in to the frenchmens lodgings / and ouerthrewe I can not tell how
many / and took.xiiii. men of arms prisoners. There was taken the lord of
Viesuile / and the lord of Mountkarell. This adventure the french men had
the same night / by reason they made but easy watch / and were but yuell
ordered. The next day when these tydinges were known / how the lord of
Viesuille / and the lord of Mountkarell were taken / the french men were sore
displeased / and took better head after. When the french king departed fro
the country of Iulyers none tarried behind / every man drew to their garysons
/ sir Guylliam of Tremoyle and sir Geruays Furrande / and all other / and the
braban soys by the way every man went home. And in the retournynge of the
french men / it was ordained by great delyberacion of counsel / that the
french king (who had been under the gouernynge of his uncles / ever sith the
death of the last king his father) should than take on himself the
gouernynge and charge of his hole realm / and his uncles to cease of the
gouernynge / for they had enough to do in other busynesses. The king as thanne
was paste twenty year of age. This was openly publysshed / and every man
thought it was reasonable. The king came to Rennes at the feast of all saints
/ and there held a great feast / and his uncles with him. And there they had
first knowledge that the King of Castyle / and the duke of Lancaster were
concluded upon a peace and upon a marriage to be had / between the kings son
and the dukes daughter. Than the french king sported with the duke of Berrey /
and said. Fair uncle ye have failed of your intent / a another is like to
enjoy the wife that ye would have had / how say you thereto / what says your
courage? The duke of Berrey said. Sir I say nothing but well / if I have
failed there / I shall speed in some other place. Than the french men began
to murmr upon this marriage / and said. this can not be done without great
alyau^ces / which shall be a thing greatly preiudycyall in time to come to the
realm of France. And such as considred the botom of the matter said: how
that if Castyle / England / and Portugale be all of one alyaunce and accord /
these three realms / what by see and by land / they may make war to the
realm of France. Wherefore they said / it were good that the king should
send and provide remedy by times / consydringe that this unhappy king of
Castyle has made alyau^ce in manner with a deed man: For the duke of lancastre
is as a man without men and puyssaunce. Nor also they said / how the king of
Castyll ought not to make any aliau^ce with any man / with out the counsel of
the French king. If he do / the king may send him word that he will make
him as low a varlette / as he has made him a great lord. Let the king
make war against the realm of Castyle and put out the unhappy king /
son to a bastard / and let the king give the realm to his own brother
the duke of Thourayne / who as yet has no great heritage: he shall well and
sagely govern it. How can or dare this king of Castyle make or treat for
any peace or alyaunce with the duke of Lancastre / without the knowledge or
consent of the French king / who has so much aided / honored / and
auaunsed him? He had lost his realm / if the puissaunce and blood royal of
France had not ben: He has well marchaundysed / and yet he will marchaundyse.
But if it be (as it is said) let him be shamed and disheryted / and let him
have such punysshment / that he may well know that he has yuell done.

THese words multiplied / in such wise / that all things considered / The
king and his uncles / and his counsel / determined to send in to Castyle to
king Johan / and to show him on the French kings behalf / that he be well
aduysed and take heed what he does: And that he be not so hardy to make any
treaty or alyaunce with the English men / nor with the duke of Lancastre /
in any thing yt should be preiudyciall to the Crown or realm of France. And
if he have done / or do / or thinks to do: Let him be sure that the
puyssaunce of France shall / as much or more set him a back and hinder him
/ as it has auaunsed him before: And that the king and the realm shall
entende to do nothing else / but to distroye him. Than it was consydred / who
should do this message. And it was thought that who soever should do it / ought
to be a hardy man and well spoken / and sagely and valiauntly to declare the
kings pleasure. It was thought that a mean and a simple person ought not to
do that message. Than there were three persons named the lord of Coucy / sir
Johan of Vyen admyrall of France / and sir Guye de la Tremoyle. Of these three
to take one to go in to Castyle on this voyage. And all things consydred / sir
Johan of Vyenne was appointed to go. Than the king and his counsel said unto
him. Admyrall make you ready / ye shall go on this voyage / and ye shall have
none other letters to the king of Castyle but of credence / ye are suffycie^tly
enstructed of the matter whereupon ye be sent. And say unto the king of
Spaygne / that he advise well and cause to be aduysed: And to read and cause to
be reed / the alyaunces / ordynaunces / and promyses / sworn and sealed
between him and us: and mark well your answer that ye shall have of him and
of his counsel / and thereupon we shall take our ground to proceed farther.
The admyrall answered and said / it shall be done.

How the Admyrall of France was ordained by the French king and his
counsel as ambassador / to go to the king of Castyle. And how the Duke of
Berrey sent to the earl of Foize to treat for a marriage / between the duke of
Berrey and the earls daughter of Boulonge. Cap. C.li.
THe admyrall of France tarried not long at Paris / but made him quickly redye
to depart / and took his leave of the king and of his uncles / and took his
way by Burgoyne / because he would go by Auygnone to se the pope and his
brother / and so he did.

Now let us leave spekyng of him / and speak somewhat of Geffray. Tete noyre
/ who was enclosed and besieged within the castle of Vandachore. But first we
will speak of the duke of Berrey who had great desire to mary / as he well
showed within that year. When he saw that he had failed of the duke of
Lancasters daughter. he was enfourmed that the earl of Boulonge had a fair
daughter named Jane / daughter to the lady Elyanour of Comynges / how be it
she was not with her father nor with her mother / she was in the country of
Bierne with the Earl of Foiz her great friend and cosyn. She had been there
brought up and nourysshed and well entreated the space of nine years / in the
castle of Ortayes / without cost or charge to father or mother. The earl often
times had been desired to have had her married: but always the earl answered
that the damsel was to young. Specially sir Bernarde brother to the earl of
Armynacke had desired to have her / and promised that if he might have her in
marriage / the war should end between them / for the challenge of the land of
Byerne. But for all those promyses / the earl would not agree thereto / but
answered ever / how that his cosyn was to young. but among his own men he
would say otherwise. For as sir Espaygne du Lion showed me / he would say /
how they of Armynacke might well repute him for a be / if he should grant
their desire / seeing it was to his do^mage. For if he should grant them his
cosyn in marriage / he should strength them / and enfeble him self. Saying /
how they of Armynake held by force and not of right the county of Comynges /
the which heritage is by his mother and aunte to my cosyn of Boloyne. I will
well they know I shall mary her in so strong a place and puissaunt to make
war with them for the heritage of Comynges. For as now there is none to
answer but a deed man.

THus when the earl of Armynacke and sir Bernarde his brother / saw that they
could not come to their purpose / as long as her aunte lived. Than they said
to the duke of Berrey / that this lady should be a fair marriage for John^ of
Berrey his son. And by their setting on / the duke sent suffycient and
noble messangers in to Byerne to the earl of Foiz. Desyringe him that all yuell
will might be set aparte and every thing pardoned of times paste / and that
he might have the damsel of Boulonge / for Johan his son in marriage. So
that the earl of Boulonge / father to the damsel did thereto agree and
assent. Therle of Foiz made good chere to these a^bassadors but he excused him
for that marriage / and said how the lady his cosyn was to young: And also he
said / how that when the countess of Boulonge her mother delivered her in to
his charge / She caused him to swear / that he should never mary her in no
place / withher knowledge and consent. And in no wise he said he might / nor
would not break his promise nor oath / and he said none ought to desire him
thereunto. This excuse the Earl made / for he knew well that his cosyn of
Comynges / who was with the earl of Vrgell her brother in the realm of Arragon
/ would not agree thereunto. Thus the ambassadors of the duke of Berrey
returned without any thing doing to their purpose. And when they were gone (as
sir Espaygne du Lion showed me) the earl said ah. The duke of Berrey and his
counsel might well repute me for an ignorant / when he would have me to
enforce mine enemies. Johan of Berry is cosyn germayn to mine adversaries of
Armynake. that bargayne shall I never make / I shall rather mary her in to
England. It has been spoken of to sir Henry of Lancastre earl of Derby /
son to the duke of Lancastre. If I thought not greatly to displease the
French king / there should none other have her but he. and as yet I know not
what I will do / for I shall rather mary her at my pleasure / than they of
Armynake should have her against my will. In me it lies to do or to leave. I
need not to trouble my self in the matter.

When the duke of Berrey knew the certe^lie that the duke of Lancaster should
mary his daughter to ye king of Castyls son^e / and that he could not break
that marriage in no wise: he was a.v. or six days so pensive / that none about
him durst demand what he ayled: at last he declared his intent to the^ of his
counsel. than they said to him. sir / if ye have failed of the duke of
Lancasters daughter / ye may recover another / as great and as good (as she
is) how be it she is very young for your age. Wherefore we can not tell if the
earl of Foiz will refuce it for that cause / who has the lady in his
governance. Ah quod the duke / that is the daughter of the Earl of Boulonge /
the earl of Foiz has refused Johan of Berrey / how be it in the name of god
let us yet assaye. Than the duke wrote to the Earl of Foiz / signifyeng him
right swetely that he would send to him four lords: as therle of Xancere /
the lord de la River / sir Guy de la Tremoyle / and the Vycount Dassey / to
treat with him to have for him self in marriage the daughter of Boulonge /
being under his keeping / so it may be to his pleasure. and desired the earl to
send him an answer in writing the hole of his mind / to thentent that his
messangers should not traueyle in vain / nor lose there pain. The earl of
Foiz received the messa^gers that brought the writtynge right amyably / and
wrote again by them to the duke of Berrey: saying / how he was right glad
of those tidings / and would be ready to receive the said lords / outher in
Foiz or in Byerne / so that the Earl of Boulonge and the countess / father and
mother to the lady be agreed thereunto. And at their return when the duke of
Berey herd his answer he was right joyful / and all that winter still he
pursued / what here and there / that he might attain to this marriage the next
somer after. He could not bring his purpose about shortly / for he knew well
the earl of Foiz was no man lightly to be won / for he was sure he should
have many delays. wherefore the duke thought to work wisely / and sent special
messangers to pope Clement / who was cosyn and nere a kyn to the damsel of
Boulo^ge. The pope was right ioyouse wha^ he knew yt his cosyn might to highly
be married / as to the duke of Berrey / uncle to the French king. Than the pope
wrote to therle of Foiz / signifyeng him right honorably / and aduysinge him
that he should not vary fro ye treaty of that marriage / for thereby their
lynage should be enhaunsed. Thus the earl of Foiz received letters fro all
parties and he answered them all / for right well he could dissimule in such
business. He held all the parties in good love and favor / both the pope
and ye duke of Berrey. yet there was not the wysest of the^ both nor of their
counfayls / yt could know perfitely what the earl of Foiz thought surely to
do. Now let us somewhat leave speaking of this matter / and return to the
siege of Vanchadore.

ye have herd here before in this history / how sir Wyllm^ Lignac and sir
John^ Boemlaunce / and diverse other knights and squiers of Auuergne and
Limosin had besieged ye castle of Va^chadore / and Geffray Tete noyre within:
But they could not win it by no manner of assaut / for they within were provided
of all things necessary for.vii. year / though they had no refresshyng. They
without often times would come out of their bastydes and scrimysshe. During the
siege many feats of arms were done / and diverse hurt on both pertes. And so
it fortuned at a scrimysshe Geffray Tete noyre was there him self / and
auau^sed so forward / that he was stricken through the bassenet in to the heed
with a quarrel / so that he was feign to keep his bed / wherwt all his
company was sore displeased / and the season that he lay there was no
scrimysshi^g. of this hurt if he had been well kept he might sone have been hole
/ but he kept him self but yuell and specially fro lechery / the which he
derely bought / for it cost him his life: but or he died he knew well before
there was no remedy but death / For it was plainly showed him / by reason of
his yuell rule. He was in ieoperdy of death for his head apostumed / wherefore he
was counsayled to declare his will and to make him ready to god ward: tha^ he
made his testament. First he caused to come before him all the soueraygne
companyons of the garyson / such as were best expert in arms. Than he sat up
in his bed and said. sirs / and derely beloved companyons / I know well I am
in great danger of death: we have a long season ben toguyder / and kept good
company: I have been your master and true captain to my power. Wherefore I
would gladly in my life days se that ye had another captain / that trewly
should acquyte him to you all / and to keep this fortress. for I shall leave
it well provided of every thing necessary parteyning to a castle of war
both of wine / vitaylles / and artyllary / and other things requysyte.
Wherefore I demand of you all in general / if ye be aduysed of any captain
or capitayns metely to be chosen to govern you and this castle / as men of
war adventurers ought to do / for such has been always the war that I
have used. I have made war much under the shadow of the king of Englandes
quarrel. I have always be desirous to be there as somewhat was to be gotton /
and so always companyons adue^turers ought to do / such as desire feats of
arms to adventure them self. Here in these fronters is a good country and
fruitful / and great profit to be goton therein / though the French men now
besiege us / it will not endure always: the siege and their bastydes will
break one day. Sirs / answer me to my demand. Have ye chosen any captain
among you? The companyons stood still and gave none answer. and when he saw
that they spoke not he began to speak again with sweet words and said. Sirs
/ I think surely of this my demand ye have thought before but little.
Wherefore sirs / as I have layne here in my bed / I have thought and devised
for you. Sir quod they we believe it well: and it shall be more agreeable to us
that it comes of you / rather than of us. And sir / show it us if it please
you. Sirs quod he I shall declare it to you / and name him that I mean.

How Geffray Teate noyre did chose a captain over his company: and how he
made his testament / and so dyed. And how the duke of guerles departed fro his
country to go in to Pruce / and of the incydence that fell to him in the land
of the duke of Stulpe / where he was taken prisosoner and disco^fyted. Cap.
C.lii.
Fair sirs quod Geffray / I know well ye have always served and honored me
/ as men ought to serve their soueraygne and captain / and I shall be ye
gladder if ye will agree to have to your captain one that is descended of my
blood. Behold here Aleyne Rour my cosyn and Peter his brother / who are men
of arms and of my blood. I re^re you to make Aleyne your captain / and to
swear to him faith / obeysaunce / love / and loyalte here in my presence / and
also to his brother: How be it I will that Aleyne have the sovereign charge.
Sir quod they we are well content / for ye have right well chosen. There all
the companyons made them seruyaunt to Aleyne Roux and to Peter his brother.
When all that was done / than Geffraye spoke again and said. Now sirs / ye
have obeyed to my pleasure / I can you great thank / wherefore sirs / I will
ye have part of that ye have helped to conquer. I say unto you / that in
yonder chest that ye se stand yonder / therein is to the some of.xxx. thousand
frankes / I will give them according to my conscience. Will ye all be content
to fulfill my testament / how say ye? Sir quod they / we be right well
content to fulfill your commandment. Than^e first quod he / I will and give
to the Chapel of saint George here in this Castle / for the reparacious
thereof a thousand and five hundred frankes: And I give to my lover / who has
truly served me two thousa^de and five hundred frankes: And also I give to
Aleyne Roux your new captain four thousand frankes: Also to the varlettes
of my chamber I give five hundred frankes. To mine officers / I give a
thousand and five hundred frankes. The rest I give and bequeth as I shall
show you. ye be upon a thyrtie companyons all of one sort / ye ought to be
brethren and all of one alyaunce / without debate / ryotte / or strife among
you. All this that I have showed you / ye shall find in yonder Cheste / I will
that ye depart all the resydue equally and truly bitwene you thyr tie. And if
ye be not thus content / but that the devil will set debate between you /
than behold yonder is a strong axe / break up the coffer and get it who can
/ to those words every man answered and said. Sir and dear master / we are
and shall be all of one accord Sir we have so much loved and douted you / ye we
will break no cofer / nor break no point of that ye have ordained and
commanded.

Thus Geffray Teate Noyre made his testament and lived not past two days after
/ and was buried in ye chapel of saint George within the castle. His will was
accomplysshed / and the.xxx. thousand frankes divided as he had ordained. And
Aleyne Roux and Peter Roux his brother / were capytayns of the castle of
Va^chadore. All this season ye siege still endured / but there were but few
scrimysshes made. Howbeit when the death of Geffray Teate noyre was known in
Auuergne and Lymosyn / the knights and squyers there were right joyful thereof
/ and douted less than they did before. For this Geffray in his time was sore
douted / for he was a good and a sage captain and expert in all war.

Now let us return to the duke of Guerles and show what fell to him in
this season / because I have spoken of him before: For by his means the
French king / his uncles / and his brother / and other nobles of France came
to the enter of the country of Guerles: and the king deperted thens and the
duke / having no great damage. And when the duke of Guerles saw that all the
me^ of war were departed / and that he was apeased with the duches of Brabant
and with all his enemies / by reason of the composicion that was made / as to
render up the town of Grave upon certain points and artycles / ordained
between ye duke of Burgone / the duches of Brabant / and the duke of Guerles.
Than he thought (to then tent to employ his season) to go in to Pruce / He made
him ready / and gate him company of knights and squyers of his own country /
and other places. And about the vtas of saint Martyn he rode forth through
Almaygne / and in every place where as he passed he had good chere. And so
long he rode that he came to the land of Pruce / I know not by what
insydence. Certain men laid in wait on him / and in the feldes set on him or
he was ware / and ouerthewe him and all his men / so that they lost all their
horses / armure / vessel / gold and silver / and were all led prisoners to
a town / and there swear faith and truth to pay their ran^somes / and
specially ye duke of Guerles became prisoner and made promise to pay his
ran^some to a squire called Arnolde / his surname I know not. Than ye duke and
his men were led to a strong town in the land of the duke of Stulpe /
whether ye duke was there or not I was not informed thereof. but when the great
masters of Pruce herd how the duke of Guerles was taken as he was coming in
to their country / they were sore displeased therewith / and said: how the
matter should not rest in that case / for they to suffr^ it should be greatly to
their blame. Tha^^ they raised up men and departed fro Co^nysbredge / and came
with a great strength of men toward the town and castle / where as the duke
of Guerles was in prison. When the squire that had taken the duke was enfourmed
of the coming of the great master of Pruce with such a puyssaunce doughted
greatly / and determined not to abide their coming to the castle / but
thought to depart But or his departure he came to the duke of Guerles and said
to him. Sir duke / ye are my prisoner and I am your master. ye are a ge^tylman
and a true knight: ye have sworn and given me your faith where soever I go
and will go / ye ought to follow me: I can not tell if ye have sent for the
great master of Pruce or not / he comes hyder with a great puyssau^ce: I
think not to abide him tarry you here if ye list / I will carry with me your
faith and promise. The duke to those words gave none answer: and the squire
took his horse and departed / and went to a place strong enough: And at his
depertyng he said again to the duke. Sir / ye shall find me in such a place
/ he named him a strong castle and out of all high ways. And when he was
gone the great master of Pruce came to the duke of Guerles where as he was /
for there was none to let him / and so delivered the duke out of prison: and
if he had found the squire there / surely he had been slain. Than the great
master of Pruce returned to Connysbredge / and the duke of Guerles with him.

I Shall show you what fell of this business. True it was / great brute ran
in diverse countries / and specially in Almaygne of the taking of the duke of
Guerles / every man that herd it had great marvel thereof. Thus when the
duke of Guerles was come to Connisbredge and was delivered / as ye have herd:
than he remembered himself / how he was bound by his faith to the squire
that took him / and remembered the words that the squier spoke at his
depertyng. than he thought in him self that in no wise he would break his
promise / but truly acquyte his faith / and said to the great master of
Pruce / that he would no lengar tarry there / but go to the squire that had his
faith. And so determined to do for any thing that the great master could
say or do: Nouther dispensacyon / absolucyon / nor other thing / could not
cause the duke to absteyne / but that he would needs go to ye town where as the
squire was / who^e he called his master: every man that herd thereof / reputed
it for a great valiantness. When this came to knowledge of his friends and
kynsmen / than they treated for his delyueraunce. and so he was delivered by
the help and means of the duke of Stulpe / who took great pain in the matter:
How be it the duke of Stulpe or he consented that the duke of guerles should
be delivered out of danger / and out of his land / would in any wise that the
duke of Guerles should swear and scale / that he and his heirs never after
that day / nor none other man for him / should take any ve^geaunce for that
matter / by way of dissymulacion or otherwise. Thus he was feign to do or he
departed. This adventure had the duke of Guerles that year. Now let us
return to sir Johan of Vyen admyrall of France / and show what he did and
what he said to the king of Castyle / on the French kings behalf.

How sir Johan of Vyen did his message to king Johan of Castyle / fro the
French king and his counsel / and what answer the king of Castyle made.
Cap. C.liii.
THe admyrall of France spedde so in his iourneys / that he entered into
castyle / and demanded where to find the King. It was showed him how he was
at Burgus / he rode thither / and alyghted at his lodging and refresshed him /
and than made him ready to go to the kings palace: and he was received after
the manner of the country right honorably / for the love and honor of the
French king. And he was brought in to the kings chamber / and there the king
received him joyfully. Than he delivered the king his letters. The king reed
them and called his counsel a part / and when they perceived by his letters
that he had credence / than the admyrall was called forth / and was commanded
to declare the intent of his coming. And he who was ready said in fair
language. Sir king and all ye of his counsel. The french king has sent me
to you / because it is come to his knowledge / how ye shall marry your son
to the duke of Lancasters daughter. and sir / ye know well that he is ye king
my masters adversary. The king and his counsel have great marueyle how ye
may here or entende to any treaty in all the world for any marriage without
their knowledge. for they say and true it is / that marriage of children can
not be without alyaunce / and amyte of peace and love. Sir / he sends you
word by me / that ye be well aduysed what ye have done / or are minded to do.
And yt in no wise it be prejudicial to the king nor to ye realm of France /
nor thereby to break the bounds and alyaunces that has been sworn and sealed
between king Henry your father / ye prelates and noble cities of this your
realm / and the noble king and realm of France. Regard well that they in no
wise be broken for if they be and ones openly known / ye ryn in the churches
sentence / and to be excommunycate on pain unpardonable: And also to be in the
indygnacion of the king and of all the nobles of France / and beside that to
have them your great enemies. Sir / this is the commandment of the king and
his counsel / that I have to show to you.

When ye king of Castyle and part of his counsel / such as were there had
herd the french kings ambassador speak so quickly / they were abashed /
and each of them looked on other: there was none that gave any answer / but
satte still. At the last a busshoppe spoke and said. Sir Johan / ye are newly
come in to these parts / and the king and all we say how ye be right hertely
welcome. The king has well herd and understand what ye have said / ye shall
have shortly and answer / within a day or two / such as shall co^tente you.
that is suffycient quod sir Johan of Vyen / and so took his leave of the king
and of his counsel / and went to his lodging. And it was showed me how he
tarried there more than seven days / without having of any answer / he saw
nothing but dyssymulacion / wherewith he was sore dyspleased / for all that
time he could not se the king / for he kept him close in his chamber. And when
sir Johan of Vien saw that he could have none other exployte in his busynes /
he spoke on a day to some of the kings counsel / and said. Syrs / surely I
will depart without answer. They douted lest he would do as he said / and
surely so he had done / and they had not called him on a day / and made him his
answer as they did. Than it was said to him how he might well show the
french king / and such as had sent him thither / that they should have the
king of Castyle nor his counsel in no manner of suspecte / for they had not
done nor would not do any thing with the king of England / that should break
or adnychilate in any manner of ways / the alyaunces that has been sworn and
sealed between France and Castyle / how be it though the king of Castyle
mary his son to the daughter of the duke of Lancaster / thereby to make a
fynall peace / for the challenge that the duke makes to the realm of Castyle
by right of his wife / and generally all the realm counsayleth the king there
to / and though he assent and will do it / yet the french king nor his
counsel ought not to be dyspleased there with / for always the king of
Castyle and his men will be conjoined and alyed with the french king / and
with the realm of France. This was the substance of the answer that sir
Johan of Vien brought in to France fro the knig of Castyle / who proceeded
sorthe with the duke of Lancastre in his marriage / and made an amyable peace
together / by means of messengers that went between them / for the duke lay
in the marchesse of Burdeaulx and came thither fro Bayon / and the duches and
her daughter / where as they were received with great joy / for they were
greatly desired there. And fro Bordeaux they went to Lyborne.

When true and certain tidings was come into the earl of Foiz house how the
King of Castyle was agreed with the duke of Lancastre / and should mary his
son with the dukes daughter / and to give great lands in Castyle / and
great nombre of floreyns / about a two hundred thousand nobles / whereof the
earl had great marueyle. This I know well / for I sir Johan Froysart was there
the same time. Than the earl of Foiz said. Ah / this king of Castyle is
unhappy / for he has made peace with a deed man / for I know well the duke of
Lancastre is in that case / and in such danger / that he can not help him
self. But the king of Castyle has met with a sage and a valyaunte prince
of the duke of Lancastre / for he has valyauntly borne him self all the war
season.

Now let us somewhat speak of the army on the sea. So it was that about the
feast of Crystmas / the earl of Arundell who had been a long season on the sea
/ costynge the fronters of Bretaygne / and of Rochell / Xaynton / and of
Normandy / and so passed before Karenten / but a fore that they took land at
Chirbroke / and would have done there some deeds of arms. And ye same season
there were sovereign capytayns in the town and garyson of Karentyne / the
lord of Hambre and the lord of Coucy / and with them a great nombre of
knights and squyers of Normandy. When the earl of Arundell knew how the
town of Karentyne was so well provided and furnysshed with good men of war /
than he passed forth / for he saw well in assautinge thereof he might rather
lose than wyn. Than he came to a another town thereby / called Toraguy / and
assailed it / and took it perforce / and pylled it / and wanne there great
richesse / and took with them many prisoners / and than came before the good
town of Bayeux / and came to the barryers / and there they made a skrymysshe
and none assaute. Than the englysshmen passed the watches of saint Clemente /
and did great damage in the country / for they tarried there a fyftene days /
and no man encountered them. the marshall of Blann^uille was in Normandy / but
he knew not of their coming / if he had he would have provided for the matter.
And when the english men had done their enterprise / and done great damage to
the country of Normandy / asmoche as a hundred thousand frankes came unto.
Than they drew back and passed again the watches / and returned to
Chyrbroke / and did put all their conquest in suretye and sauegarde in to their
ships. And when they had wind and wether / and their ships charged / than
they entered and dysancred and took the sea / and returned in to England / and
aryued at Hampton. Thus the army of the earl of Arundell on the sea concluded
in that season.

How sir Loys of Xancere went to se the earl of Foize at Ortays / and how
before the duke of Lancastre at Bordeaux / there were deeds of arms done
between five frenchmen and five english men / and how the duches of
Lancastre went with her daughter in to Castyle to king Johan. Cap. C.liiii.
IN this season sir Loys of Xancer marshall of France was in Languedoc / in
the marches of Toulouse and Carcassone / and he knew well of the treatye that
was made between the duke of Berrey and therle of Foiz / for the marriage of the
duke of Bowlonges daughter / whom the duke of Berrey would have / though the
damsel were right young. Than the marshall had affection to go and se the
earl of Foyz / as I was enfourmed by his men at Ortays / for when he came
thither he found me there. He came at the sendynge of the french king / and I
shall show you why and wherefore. The french king was as tha^ young and had
desire to travail / and he had never ben as than in Languedoc / which is a
great country / and full of cities / towns and casteles and as than nygh all
dystroyed and wasted / for the duke of Berry and his counsel / who had the
governance of that country / had greatly enpouerysshed and pylled the
country / by tails and great oppressyons / the complayntes whereof came to the
kings ears / by reason that he was newly entered in to the domynacion of his
Realm. And the king said he would go in to Languedoc to vysite that country
/ and also to go and se the pope whom he had never seen before / and also in
that voyage he said he would se the earl of Foiz / of whom he had herd so
much honor and larges spoken of. Thus the marshall went forth on his way /
and departed fro the city of Tholous / with a five hundred horse / and rode so
long yt he came to Tarbe in Bygore / and fro thence to Morloys in Bierne. And
the earl of Foiz who was signyfied of his coming was joyful / and commanded
all his officers that the town of Ortays should be well aparelled to receive
him / for he said the marshals coming pleased him right well. lodgings for
his men were made ready / and the earl rode out in to the feldes to mete with
him / and mothan three hundred horses / and there received him with good chere.
And he was at Ortays a sire days / and the marshall said to the earl / how
the french king had great affection to se the country of Languedoc / and to
se him. Than the earl answered and said. Sir / the king shall be right
welcome / and glad I would be to se him. yea / but sir quod the marshall / it
is the kings entension at his coming plainly to know / whether ye will hold
you french or englissh / for always ye have dissymuled out the war / for ye
would never arm you for no desire. A sir quod the earl I thank you / in that
ye have showed me somoche / For sir / though I would never arm me / nor take
no part / there has been good cause why. As for the war between England
and France / I have nothing to do therewith / I hold my country of Bierne of
no man / but of good and the sword. What have I to do to put my self in
seruytude or in dyspleasure of one king or other / yet I know well mine
adversaries of Armynake have done that in them is to bring me in the
indyngnacion of both parties / for or the prince of Wales went in to Spain
by the informacyon of the earl of Armynake / the prince would have made me
war / he was so sore moved thereto / that he had done so / and sir Johan
Chandos had not broken his purpose / but I thank god always I have borne my
self as mekely and as curteyssy as I could / and shall do as long as I live
/ and when I am deed / let the matters go as they will. Thus the earl of Foyze
and the marshall passed the time together. And at their departure the earl gave
him a fair courser / a fair mule / and a another good horse / all three
together rychely sadylled and aparelled. And he gave to sir Roberte of Challus
and to sir Richard Dolphyn / to each of them two hundred frankes / and to five
other squyers / to each of them fifty frankes. Than the marshall took leave to
depart to Tholous. And I sir Johan Froysart was there the same time / and
would have departed fro Ortays with him / but the Earl of Foyze would not
suffer me / and said I should not as than depart. So it behooved me to bide his
pleasure. Sir Loys departed fro Ortays and rode to Tarbe / and the lord
Dolphyn of Bygore conveyed him / and sir Peter of Calestan one of the earl of
Foiz knights.

About the same season there was at Bordeaux a deed of arms done before the
duke of Lancastre / by five englisshmen of his own house / and five french
men / some of them were of the marshall of France house. First / by ser
Pecton Dallagnie a gascone englyssh / against sir Mores Mannigmente french.
Second between sir Aragon Raymon english / against the bastard of Chauigny
French. The third / between Loys Malapus / capytayne of Agremortes french /
against Iaquemyn Corn de Cerfe english. Fourth between Archambalte de
Villyers french / and the son of the lord of Chaumonte gascone english.
The fyfte by Willyam Foucalt french / against the brother of the lord of
Chaumont english. And to se these arms acomplysshed / diverse knights and
squiers of Bierne of therle of Foiz house / took their way toward Bordeaux /
and I went with them in company. between Ortars and Bordeaux is but.xxiiii.
mile. There we saw the said arms done before saint Andrews / in the
presence of the duke of Lancastre and the duches / their daughter / and other
ladies and damsels of the country. These knights were not all armed at ones
/ but every man by him self with his fellow aparte. their arms were three
courses with a spear / three strokes with a sword / three with an are / and
three with a dagger and all a horsehacke. And this they did in three days / and
none of all ten hurt / but sir Raymon slew the bastardes horse / wherewith
the duke of Lancastre was sore dysplesed / and blamed greatly the knight
because he bare his staff so low / and the duke gave the bastard one of his
horses. When this was accomplysshed / every man deperted to their own houses.

AN one after the duchess of Lancastre ordained to goo in to Castyle / and to
lead with her Katheryne her daughter / who should have in marriage the king of
Castyls son. And the duchess entente was / first or she would enter in to
Castyle to go to Mantuell / where sometime was ye battle between king don
Peter her father / against king Henry of Castyle / and of sir Bertram of
Clesquyn. And there she purposed to make just enquiry where the king her
father lay buried / and to dygge up his bones / and to have them to the city
of Cyuill / and there to bury them again rychly / as it appertayned to a
king. In the beginning of March / when the son began to mount / and
the days to increase / than the duches of Lancastre was ready with her daughter
/ and so departed fro Bordeaux and went to Bayon / and there the duke of
Lancastre took leave of her / and he returned to Bordeaux. And the ladies rode
forth to Dape / and there she was well received / for the cite of Dape was
under the obeysaunce of the king of England. There she rested two days / and
than passed through the country of Basquence / and passed by the pass of
Rouceualx / and entered in to Nauerre / and came to Panpilona / and there found
the king of Nauer and the queen / who received the duchess honorably. The
queen of Nauer was suster to the king of Castyle. The duches and her daughter
were a monethe passing through the realm of Nauer / for they tarried with the
King and with the queen a certain space / and their costs and charges were
borne and paid for. Than they entered in to Spaygne / and at the enter of the
realm they found of the king of Castyls servants ready there to receive
them / acordynge as they were commanded. And than the young prince was called
prince of Galyce.

How the duches of Lancastre departed fro the king of Castyle / and went to
Mantuell to bring her fathers bones to Ciuyll / and how the french king
sent ambassadors to the earl of Foize to treat for the marriage of the duke of
Berrey his uncle / with the daughter of the earl of Boloyne. Cap. C.lv.
When all these matters were renewed and the marriage confyrmed / than the
duchess of Lancastre left her daughter with the king and with her young
husband that should mary her / who was of the age of eight years. the duches
took leave of ye king to go to Mantuell / the king sent with her of the
greatest men of the court to a company her. Thus she came to Mantuell / and
did so much that she knew the troth where her father was buried. Than he was
dygged up / and his bones washed and bawmed / and wrapped in lead / and
brought to the city of Ciuyll / and there received with processyon without the
city / and the bones brought in to the cathedral church / and there
reverently and sole^ply his obsequy was done / and there at was king Johan and
his young son the prince of Galyce / and the most part of prelates and
barons of the realm. After the obsequy done / every man returned to their
own places. The king of Castyle went to the vale of Sorry / and his son^e and
his young wife with him / and the duchess of Lancastre to Medena de Campo / a
good town / whereof she was lady / by reason of the confyrmacyon of the peace /
and there she lay a season. Now let us leave to speak of them and of Castyle
/ till a another time / and let us speak of the marriage of the duke of Berrey /
and also of other insydentes that followed.

THe duke of Berrey who had married the lady Jane of Armynake to his first wife
/ after she was dysseased he had great imagynacyon to be married again / and
that he well showed. for when he saw how he had myssed of the duke of
Lancastres daughter / he than set clerks to write / and sent messangers to
therle Gascon of Foiz / who had the keeping of the earl of Boulonges daughter /
more than the space of nine years. And because the duke of Berrey could not
come to this marriage / but by the danger of the earl of Foize / for another for
pope / father / mother / nor friend that the damsel had / the earl would do
nothing / without it were his own pleasure. Than the duke of Berrey desired
effectuously the french king his nephue / and the duke of Burgoyne his brother
to help and assyst him in this marriage.

THe french king laughed and had good sport at the duke of Berrey his uncle /
because he was old / and so hot in love / and said to him. Fair uncle / what
shall ye do with a young maid / she is not twelve year of age / and ye be.xl.
by my faith it is great folly for you to think thereof / speak for my cosyn
Johan your son / he is young / the matter is more mete for him than for you.
sir quod the duke / I have speken all ready for my son / but the earl of Foize
will in no wise agree thereto / because my son is of the blood of them of
Armynake / who be at war together / and have been long. If the lady be young I
shall spare her a three or four year / till she be a parfyte woman. Well fair
uncle quod the king / I fear me she will not spare you so long / but seeing
ye have so great affection thereto / I shall aid you as much as I may. It was
not long after but that the king ordained the lord de la River and sir
Bureau his sovereign chamberlayne to go in yt voyage to the earl of Foiz / and
with them the earl of Dassy. And the duke of Burgoyne ordained to go thither on
his be half the bishop of Anthune / and sir Gylliam of Tremoyle / and the
duke of Berrey desired Johan earl of Sanxer / a sage and a valiant knight to
go with the other. These five lords were appointed to go to the earl of Foize /
and to desire to have the young lady in marriage for the duke of Berrey. These
lords departed and appointed to mete together at Auignon with pope Clement /
about Candelmas they departed and took the way to Nysmes / and so to Auignon.
They passed by Mount pellyer / and rode by small iourneys and great exspence /
and passed by Besyers and came to Carcassone / and there they found sir Loys
of Xancere marshall of France / who received them with good there / and he
showed them much of the earl of Foiz estate / for he had been there within two
months before. Than they departed fro Carcassone and went to Tholous / and
there rested / and than sent messangers to the earl of Foiz to Ortays in
Byerne. And there began to treat for this marriage / but it was far of / for
at the beginning the Earl of Foyze was cold / because the duke of Lancastre
had sent to him to have the same lady / for his son the lord Henry earl of
Derby. By reason of this long taryenge and delayeng of this treatye / it was
said and noysed that the marriage should not be. And all their aunsweres that
they had fro the earl of Foize / wickely they sent word thereof to the duke of
Berrey / who was at Nonnecte in Auuergne. And the duke who had none other
desire but to bring the matter about / wrote often times again to them with
fresshe messangers / desiring them not to cease till they had brought the
matter to pass. And the earl of Foyze who was sage and subtyle / saw well the
ardent desire that the duke of Berrey had / and the hoter that he was the
colder was he / and he handeled the matter so wisely / that by the full
agreement of all parties / and yet sore desired thereto / he had thyrty
thousand frankes for the charges of the ladies expenses / for such years as
she had been with him / if he had more demanded more he should have had / but
he did it so to have thank of the duke of Berrey / and that he should perceive
that he had done some what for him.

When this matter was concluded and all parties agreed / thanne the earl of Foiz
sent his cosyn the lady to Morleaus / accompanied with five hundred spears /
of whom were capytayns sir Espaigne du Lynn / sir Raynolde Guyllam / sir Peter
Calestan / sir Adam of Cacasse / sir Manalte of Nonnables / and sir Pier of
Kees / and in the feldes the lady was delivered to the french ambassadors /
on the behalf of the duke of Berrey. There was sir Loys of Xancere with a five
hundred spears / and other company / who received the lady / and there took
their leaves and departed. They of Foize returned / and the french men led
forth the lady. The duke of Berrey had sent to her chares and chareottes
rychely garnysshed / and horse / hackeneys / and aparell for her body and for
her heed / as fresshe and as rich as though it had been for the french queen.
Thus they rode forth / and I sir Johan Froysart auctor of this book rode in
their company / for often times when I would have taken leave of the earl of
Foiz / he would say to me / how I had no deed to make so great haste / and
badde me when I would return to go in good company / so I returned in this
said company. This young duchess of Berrey (for so I will name her fro hence
forth) and all her company rode so long that they came nere to Auignon. There
she rested at a town called Vile Neufe / without the town of Auignon / in a
house of the popes. And the next day about nine of the clock / all the
cardynals that were there at that time met with her / and so passed the
bridge of Rosue in great estate / the lady riding on a white palfrey which
the pope had sent her. Than she came to the popes palace in Auignon and there
alighted and went to se the pope / who sat in co^systory in a chair
pontyficall. The pope kyst her mouth because of lygnage. Than the duchess and
her company went to dinner with many cardynalles / to the house of the
cardynall of Thuryn / nere to the popes palyce. This was on a wednysdaye / and
the next day they all dyned in the same house again. I may well say that
the coming of this lady to Auignon cost the pope the some of ten thousand
frankes. The fridaye she supped in the palace and took her leave of the pope /
and the saturday she departed and rode to dinner to Orange / and there lay all
night / for her cosyn germayne was princess thereof. The sunday she departed
and he^ caryage before and passed to Valance / and than to Vien / and so to
Lion sur le Rone / and there rested two days / than fro thens to Bres^e / and
so entered in to the county of Forestes / and passed through the country / and
so came to la Palesse in Burbonois and so to Quissy / than to Hanche / and so
to Ryon in Auuergne / and there rested two days or the duke of Berrey came
thither / who came thither on Whytsoneuyn / and on Whytsonday betymes he married
the lady. This was a noble wedding and a great feast / there was the earl of
Boloyne / the earl of Estampes / and the earl Dolphyn of Auuergne. this feast
and iustes endured four days. All this I sir Johan Froysart auctor of this
book saw with mine eyes / for I was there present.

How certain wise men treated for a peace to endure three years between
France and England / and all their alyes as well on the one part as on the
other by land and by see. Cap. C.lvi.
YE have herd here before how there was a treuse taken between all parties
and garysons / between the River of Loyr and the river of Dordone / and of
Geronde / unto the feast of saint Johan Baptyst / counted as than in the year
of grace a thousand three hundred fourscore and nine. This treuse dutynge /
there were some great men and sage on both parties / both of England and of
France / that busyed themself to treat for a peace to endure three years /
both by water and by land. And the entensyon of them ye treated in this matter
was to comprise in their treatye for the french party / all such as were
besyed with their war. First to have comprysed the realm of Castyle holy /
as well by land as by water / and in like manner the realm of Scotland. And
on the english party should be comprised all their alyes / and the king and
realm of Portugale / and diverse barons of high Gascon. These entreatours had
much pain and travail or they came to their ententes / for the scotts would
in no wise consent. For when word thereof came to king Roberte of Scotland
fro the french king / his own person would lightly have greed thereto / for
he desired no war. On a day he called before him all the barons and
prelates of Scotland / such as ought to give counsel in that matter / for
without their knowledge the king would do nothing / if he had done / they would
not have kept it. There openly was read in all their presence / the letters
that the french king had sent thither to the king / and to the realm of
Scotland / the entente whereof was / that the french king would have them of
Scotland to be comprised with him / (...) to agree to a treuse for three years by
land and by water between England and them. This tidings was hard to them
/ and they said. The french king can do nothing but to have treuce / when
it is time to make war. We have in this year overcome the englysshmen / and
the season is right good / and lykely that we shall overcome them again the
second time: yea / and the third also. There was great debatynge of the
matter between them / but in no wise they would consent thereto. Finally they
acorded to send a bishop and three knights in to France to the king and
to his counsel / to the intent to break the treaties / and to show the good
will of the scotts that they had to the war. The bishop of saint Andrews
and sir Archambalte Duglas / sir Willyam Lymsey / and sir Johan saint Clear.
These departed as soon as they might / and took the sea and arrived at Sluse
and than rode to Paris. and before the king and his counsel they showed their
letters of credence / sent in the name of all the barons and prelates of the
realm of Scotla^de. They were well herd / and the french men percyued well
the great affection that they had to proceed / and to contyne we the war
against England / how be it the treatye was so far past and promised that
it could not be revoked again. Than the scotts were swetely answered / how
there was no remedy but that they must needs proceed to the peace. Thus the
french men took a treuse / by means of such as treated for the matter /
there were diverse metynges between the parties at Balingham / between Boloyne
and Calays. So often they met and debated the matters that a treuce was taken
/ given and acorded / between England and France (for such as were treaters
of the matter / were prelates / great lords and wysemenne of both realms) and
all their adherentes and alyes / by see and by land / to endure fermely
without dissymulacyon of any shadow of male engyn / the space of three years.
The entreatours of the french party were at Boloyne / as the bishop of
Bayeur / the earl Valery of saint Pole / sir Willyam of Melyn / sir Nycholas
Bracque / and sir Johan le Mercier. And at Calays for the English part was
the bishop of Durham / sir Willyam Montague earl of Salisbury / sir Wyllyam
Beauchampe captain of Calais / Johan Lauon and Nycholas of Gaberthe / and
Richard Roell clerk doctor in law. These met together in the mids of the
way between Calays and Boloyne. at a place called Balyngham.

In this time great brute was in France and in other places / of a great feast
and iustes that the young king Charles would make at Paris / at the first
entryng of Isabell ye french queen: against which feast knights / squyers /
ladies and damoselles apparelled them to be at that tryumphe: Of the which
feast I shall speak more here after / and of the charter of the peace that was
engrosed and sealed between the parties.

yE shall know that when I sir Johan Froyssarte author of this history was
departed fro Ortays fro the earl of Foiz / as ye have herd here before: and
went in company with the lord de la River and the lord Guyllyam of Tremoyle
/ who brought the young duchess of Berrey / daughter to the earl of Boulonge
to ye duke of Berrey / who wedded her in the town of Ryon in Auuergne / as it
is contained here before in this history: for at all these matters I was
present / wherefore I may well speak thereof. And when I came to Paris I found
there the gentle lord of Coucy a good lord of mine / who had newly married a
young lady / daughter to the duke of Lorayne: Which lord made me good chere /
and demanded of me news of the country of Foiz and Biern / and of pope
Clement being at Auygnon / and of the marriage between Berrey and Boulonge / and
of another great friend of mine and good lord and master / therle Beraunt
dolphyn of Auuergne. And to all his demau^des I answered all that I knew / so
that he was content. Than he desired me to go with him in to Cambresys / to a
castle that the king had given him / called Creue cure / a two leages fro
Ca^brey / and nine leages fro Valensenes. And so I rode in his company. And as
we rode by the way he showed me / how the bishop of Bayeux and the earl of
saint Pole and other were at Boloyn sent thither by the french king / to
conclude the truce. and how that for king Richard king of England there
were at Calys / the bishop of Durham and therle of Salisbury / with other. and
how they had been there the space more thanne a month / abiding for the
ambassadors of Scotland / who were as than newly come thither. He said how
his cosyn the earl of saint Pole had written to him thereof / and how the
french king had sent to the king of Scotts / and to his counsel that he
should agree to the truce / for the english men would consent to no peace /
without the scotts were comprised in the same. Thus we rode till we came to
Creue cure / and there I was with him three days. Tha^ I took leave of him and
went to Valencennes / and there I tarried fyftene days. Than I went in to
Holande to se a gentle lord and good master of mine the earl of Bloyes / and
found him at Esto^choucke. he made me good chere and demanded of me some
tidings / and I showed him such as I knew. I tarried with him a month there
and at Gede. Than I returned in to France to know the truth of the
conclusion that was taken between England and France at Balyngham. Also I
purposed to be at the feast that should be at Paris at the enter of the French
queen / to know the truth of all these matters / I returned through
Brabaunt and so came to Paris / eight days before the feast began. Than I fell
in company with the lords of France and of Scotland / such as had been at
the making of the truce between England and France. And I fell in
acqueyntau^ce with sir Guyllyam of Melyn / who showed me all the hole matter /
and how the Earl of saint Pole was passed in to England to se king Richard
/ and to confyrme the truce that was granted for three years: and that he
should return again to be at the said great feast. Than I demanded of the
said sir Guillyam / what lords of Scotland had been at the said treaty. I
demanuded it / because in my youth I had been in Scotland / and serched all
the realm to the wild scotts. And while I was there I tarried a space in yt
court of king Dauyd of Scotland / and there I had acqueyntau^ce of the most
part of ye lords and knights of Scotla^de / therefore I demanded who had
been there. And this sir Melyn answered me and said / how there had been the
bishop of Bredon / and sir James and sir Dauyd Lymsay / and sir Water of saint
Clear. I bare his saying away / and did put in writynge all that I had
seen and herd. And shall show the truth what I saw and knew of this feast
/ and of the first entryng of queen I sabell in to Paris.

Of the ordinance of the enter of queen Isabell in to the town of Paris. Cap.
Clvii.
THe sunday the twenty day of June / in the year of our lord god / a
thousand three hundred four score and nine. there was people in Paris and with
out / such nombre / that it was marueyle to behold. And the same sunday in
the morning there was assemble made in the church of saint Denyce / of noble
ladies of France / such as should accompany the queen / and of such lords
as should assyst the queen's lytters and other ladies. And there was of the
burgesses of Paris twelve hundred an horseback raynged in the feldes on both
sides of the way / aparelled in gowns of one suit / of clothe of Baudkyn /
grene and crymosyn. And the old queen Jane and her daughter duchess of
Orlyance / entered first in to Paris one hour before noone / in a lytter
covered / well a companyed with lords / and passed through the high street of
saint Denyce / and so rode to the palace / and there tarried for the king.
That day these two ladies went no further. Than ye french queen and the other
ladies set forward / as the duchess of Berrey / the duchess of Burgoyne /
the duches of Thourayn / the duches of Bare the countess of Neuers the lady of
Coucy / and other ladies and damoselles all in good order. all their lytters
were aparelled as richly as might be. But ye duches of Thourayne had no lytter
/ she rode a lone upon a fair pal frey rychly aparelled / and she rode on the
one side by the queen's lytter / and it was assysted with the duke of Thourayne
and the duke of Burbone / at the fore heed on both sides. And in the mids on
both sides the lytter were the duke of Berry and the duke of Burgoyne / and at
the fete was the lord Peter of Nauer and therle of Ostrenaunt. The queen's
lytter was richely apparelled and discouert. Than next followed on a rich
apparelled Palfrey the duchess of Berrey / and she was assisted with the earl
de la March and with the earl of Neuers / and she rydinge a soft pace between
them both. Than^e followed the lytter all discovered and open of the duchess
of Burgoyne / and Margarete of Heynalte her daughter countess of Neuers. That
lytter was assysted with the lord Henry of Bare and the young earl of Namure /
called sir Guylliam. And than ye lady of Orlyaunce on a palfrey richely
apparelled / and the lord James of Burbone and the lord Philyppe Dartoys
assysted the lady of Orlyaunce. Than another lytter with the duchess of Bare /
and the daughter of the lord of Coucy. Of other ladies and damoselles that
came after in chariottes and palfrayes / and knights that followed / there was
no mention made. And as for sergeauntes and officers of arms had business
enough to do to make way / and to break the preace. There was such people in
the streets / that it seemed that all the world had been there.

AT the first gate of saint Denice entryng in to Paris / there was a Heuyn made
full of sterres / and within it young children apparelled like angels swetely
singing. And among them an image of our lady holdyng in figure a little
child playeng by him self / with a little myll made of a great nutte. This
Heuyn was high and richely apparelled with the arms of France with a baner
of the son shynyng of gold / castyng his rays. This was devised by the
king for the feast of the iustes. The queen and the other ladies as they
passed under in at ye gate / they had great pleasure to behold it / and so had
all other that passed by. Than when the Queen and the ladies were paste by /
than they came a soft pace before the fou^tayne in a street of saint Denice /
which condyte was covered over with a clothe of fine asure / painted full of
Flower de lyces of gold / and the pyllers were serte full of the arms of
diverse noble lords of France. and out of this fou^tayn there issued in great
stremes Punent and clarre: And about this fou^tayne there were young maidens
richely apparelled / with rich chapelettes on their heedes synginge
melodiously. Great pleasure it was to here them: And they held in their hands
Cups and goblettes of gold / offryng and gyueng to drink / all such as
passed by / And the queen rested there and regarded them / and had great
pleasure of that deuyse / and so did all other ladies and damoselles that saw
it.

THan after / under the mynster of the Trinyte / in the street there was a
stage / and thereupon a castle. And a long on the stage there was ordained the
Pass of king Salhadyn / and all their deeds in personages / the Christen men
on the one part / and the Sarazins on the other part. and there was in
personages all the lords of name / that of old time had been armed / and had
done any feats of arms at ye Pass of Salhadyne / and were armed with such
armure as they than used. And thanne a little above them there was in
personages the French king and the twelve peers of France / armed with the
blason of their arms. and when the French queen's lytter was come before this
stage / she rested there a season. Thanne the personages on the stage of king
Richard departed fro his company / and went to the French king / and
demanded license to go and assail the Sarazins / and ye king gave him leave.
Than king Richard returned to his twelve companyons. Than^e they all set
them in order / and incontinent went and assailed the king Salhadyne and the
Sarazins. There in sport there seemed a great bataile / and it endured a good
space. This pagiaunt was well regarded. Than^e the queen passed forth and came
to ye second gate of saint Denyce. And there was a castle ordained / as was
at the first gate: and a heuyn clouded / and full of sterres richely devised /
and therein the figure of God lyttynge in majesty / the father / the son /
and the holygoost. And within the Heuyn children in figure of angels swetely
syngyng / which pagiaunt was greatly praised. And as the queen's lytter passed
under the gate of Paradise / there were two angels came out and came down
holding in their hands a rich crown of gold / garnysshed with precious
stones. And they set fair and easily the crown on ye queen's heed / synging
right swetely this verse. Dame / as ye be enclosed between the Flower de lyces
/ so ye be queen of the realm of France / and so drew again in to paradyse.
Than they passed forth and came before the chapel of saint James. And there
was a scaffolde richely devised / on the right hand as the queen rode /
covered over with rich arras / and drawn about with curteyns / in manner of a
chamber. And within there were me^ playeng upon orga^s right swetely: And all
the street of saint Denyce was covered over with clothes of sylke and chamlet /
such plenty / as though such clothes should cost nothing. And I sir Johan
Froissart author of this history was present / and saw all this / and had
great marueyle where such nombre of clothes of sylke were gotten. There was as
great plenty as though they had been i^ Alysandre or Damas / and all the houses
on both sides of the great street of saint Denice unto the bridge of Paris /
were hanged with clothes of Arras of diverse histories / the which was pleasure
to behold. Thus they passed forth a soft pace and so came to the gate of the
chatelet of Paris: and there the queen rested to se the other goodly deuyses
that were there ordained.

AT the gate of the chatelet of Paris there was a castle made of wood and
tymbre / as strongly made / as it should have endured.xl. years. The which
castle was enbatylled / and at every lope there was a man of arms armed at
all pieces. And in ye same castle there was a bed made / richely encourteyned
and apparelled / as it had been to have stand in the kings chamber. and this
bed was called ye bed of Justice: and in this bed there lay by figure
saint Anne. in this castle there was a plain / for the castle contained a
great space: and this plain was full of trees / and full of Hares / cones / and
birds / that flewe in and out: For when they were a broad they flewe thider
again for fear of ye people. And out of these trees there issued a white
Heart / and went to the bed of Justice: and out of the other part of the
wode there issued out a Lion and an Egle properlye / and fresshely approached
the Heart and the bed of Justice. Than came there out of the trees a.xii.
young maidens richely apparelled / with chapelettes of gold on their heedes /
holding naked swords in their hands / and they went between the Heart / the
Lion / and the Egle / and there they showed them self ready to defend the
Heart and the bed of Justice. This deuyse ye queen and all other had great
pleasure to regard. than they passed forth and came to the bridge of Paris /
which was covered and richely besene. The covering of grene and crimosyn full
of sterres / and the streets hanged to our ladies church. And by that time
that the queen and the ladies were paste the bridge / and approached to the
church of our Lady / it was late: For all the way as they went / they rode
but a soft pace. And or the Queen and the ladies entered in to the church of
our Lady / they found by they way other plays and pastymes / greatly to
their pleasure.

Among all other there was a master came out of Geane. He had tied a cord on
the highest house on the bridge of saint Myghell over all ye houses / and the
other end was tied on the highest tower in our ladies church. And as ye queen
passed by / and was in the great street called out ladies street / because it
was late. This said master with two brinnynge candelles in his hands /
issued out of a little stage that he had made on the hight of our ladies tower:
And syngyng he went upon the cord all a long the great street / so that all
that saw him / had marueyle how it might be: And he bare still in his
hands ye two brinnynge ca^delles / so that it might well be seen over all
Paris / and two mile without Paris. He was such a tombler / that his
lyghtnesse was greatly praised. And before the church of our lady the
bishop of Paris was reuested with the arms of our lord Iesa Christ / with
all the college and great no^bre of other of the clergy. There the Queen a
lyghted out of her lytter / and was takenne down by the four dukes / that is
to say: the duke Berrey / the duke of Burgoyne / ye duke of Thourayne / and
the duke of Burbone: and all other ladies in likewise taken down by them that
were their assysters / both out of their lytters and fro their horses / and in
good order. So they entered in to the church. The bishop and the clergy
before the^ syngyng / in ye honor of god and of our blessed lady. the queen
was led and assysted and brought up to the high auter / and there she kneled
down and said her prayers / such as pleased her / and offered to the tresorie
of our lady four clothes of clothe of gold / and the goodly crown that the
angels did set on her heed / and than incontinent sir John^ de la River and
sir Johan le Mercyer delivered the bishop of Paris a more rycher crown. And
the bishop and the four dukes did set it on the queen's heed. Than^e they
returned again through the church / and the queen and the ladies set
again in their lytters / as they were before. There were mo than five hundred
torches brinnyng for it was late. Thus they were brought to the palace of Paris
/ where the king / the old queen / and the duchess of Orlyaunce her daughter
were. There the queen and the ladies lyghted fro their lytters / and each of
them brought in to several chambres: and the lords went to their lodgings /
after the daunsynge was paste.

THe next day Monday / the king made them all a dinner at his palis. And at
the hour of the high mass / the queen was led with the foresaid four dukes
in to the holy chapel: and there in the mass season the queen was sacred and
anointed / as a Queen ought to be: And the archebysshoppe of Roane did the
obseruaunce / who was called sir Wyllyam of Vyar. After the mass song
solempnely / the king and the queen returned in to their cha^bres / and all
other ladies such as had chambres in the palace. Than anon after the king and
the queen returned in to the halle / and all other ladies. The great table of
Marble that always stands still in the halle / was made lengar with a great
plaunche board of Oak / of four inches thycke / which board was richelye
covered. And above the great table / against one of the Pyllers / was the
Kings dressyng board / standing full of vessel of gold and silver / which
was greatly covered of many that saw it. Before the table a long discendyng
down / there were barryers made of wode with three alyes / and there were
sergeauntes and ushers a great nombre keeping the entrees / to the entente
that none should enter / but such as were seruytours of ye table / for ye hall
was so full of people that a man could not turn him / but with much pain.
Mynstrelles a great nombre plesauntly played / every man after his faculty.
Than the king and the prelates / and the queen and the ladies washed and sat
down at the tables. At the kings table sat down as chief / the bishop
of Noyan / than the bishop of Langers / than the king / and by the king
the archebysshoppe of Rohan. The king satte in a surcote of scarlette furred
with armyns / and a rich crown of gold on his heed. Than the queen / and by
her the king of Armyne / than the duches of Berry / than the duches of Burgoyne
/ and ye duches of Thourayne: Than the lady of Neuers / and the good damsel
of Bare / than the lady of Coucy and Mary of Harecourt. Mo there sat not at
the high table / saving beneth all satte the lady of Sailly / wife to sir
Guye of Tremoyle. And at two other tables a long down the hall / sat mo than
five hundred ladies and damsels. The prease was so great / that it was great
pain to serve the^ with their messes / which were great and no table. I have
not to do to make great process thereof / I shall so what speak of the pastymes
yt were made bitwene the messes / the which had been great pleasure for the
king to have seen / if he had tarried out the hole dinner.

First in the mids of the palace there was a castle made of tymbre xl. foot
long and twenty fore broad with four towers / in every quarter one and one
in the mids / higher than the other.

This Castle was fygured for the city of Troy / and the tower in the mids
for the palace of ylion: And there were peno^s with the arms of the Troyans /
as of king Priamus / Hector his son / and his other children. And also the
arms of such other kings and princes / as were enclosed in Troy with king
Priam. This castle went upon wheles / the which might be turned every way
properly. This castle came to assail another sort that was thereby in a
pauilyon / which also went upon wheles / so softely and covertly / that the
mouynge thereof could not be parceyued / and there was ye arms or the kings of
Greece / and of other such as were at the siege. Also there was a ship
properlye devised / wherein might well be a hundred men of arms / and all moved
by the craft of wheles / both the Castle / Pauilyon / and ship. They of the
Pauilyon and of the Ship / assailed ever the castle / and they within the
Castle made great defense. But this sporce endure not long / for the preace
of the people was so sore about them / that no man could stir. The people
were sore chafed with the heat / and put to much pain. And there was a
table by the parlyament chamber door where at satte many ladies and damoselles.
It was by reason of the preace overthrown to the earth / and the ladies caused
suddenly to rise without order / and sore chafed with the preace and heat that
was in the palace. The queen herself was at the point to have been sore
displeased: Perforce a back door was broken up to get fresshe air. The
lady of Coucy was sore diseased. Whan^e the king saw this matter / he
commanded to cease / and the tables in great have to be taken up / to let the
ladies and damoselles at large. They left taking of wine and spyces and went
to their chambres. Than some of the ladies tarried still in the Palace / and
some went in to the town to their lodgings / to be the more at their ease:
for with preace and with heat / they had been sore grieved. The lady Coucy
went to her lodging / and held her there till it was late.

THan about five of the clock the French Queen / accompanied with the
foresaid duchesses / departed fro the palace of Paris and took their lytters
all open / and so went through the streets to the kings lodging / called
saint Polle / on the river of Said. with the queen there were mo than a
thousand horses. And the king went fro the palace to the river of Said / and
took there a barge / and went by water to his house of saint Polle. And for
all that ye house was great and large and well amended / yet ye king had caused
in the great court nere to the gate fro the River / to be made a great halle
which was covered over with clothes of the arms of Normandy: And the walls
were hanged with clothes of arras of sondrie hystories. In this hall the king
gave the ladies a supper / but the queen kept her chamber / she was no more
seen yt night. The other ladies and the king and the lords daunsed and
reuelled all that night / nerchande till it was day in the morning. Than every
person departed and went to their lodgings to sleep for it was good time. Now
I shall show you what gifts and prese^tes they of Paris gave on the Tuesday
before noon to ye queen and to the duchess of Thourayne / who was but newly
come in to France out of Lombardy / for she was daughter to the duke of
Myllayne: and she had the same year wedded Loyes duke of Thourayne. She was
named Valentyne / she had never before ben at Paris / therefore the burgesses of
Paris gave her her welcome.

ON this Tuesday about.xii. of the clock about a.xl. burgesses of Paris of
the most notablest persons of the city / all in one suit of clothing came to
the kings house of saint Polle / and brought a present for the queen through
the streets of Paris. The present was in a lytter richely wrought and borne
between two strong me^ properly apparelled like two ancient sage persons. The
lytter had a celler of a thynne five clothe of sylke / so that the iewelles
that were in the litter might well be seen through When they came to saint
Polle / first they ca^e in to the kings chamber / which was ready apparelled
to receive them / for always such as brings any thing are welcome. tha^
these burgesses set down the lytter on two trestels in the mids of the
chamber: Than they kneled down before the king and said. Right dear lord and
noble king / your burgesses of Paris presents your grace these iewelles here
in this lytter / in the welcomy^g of your grace into the governance of your
realm of France. Than the king said. good men I thank you / they are right
goodly and rich. than the burgesses rose and drew back / and therewith took
their leave. When they were gone / the king said to sir Wyllyam of Lords and
to Montague / who were by him. Sirs / let us go nere to this lytter / and se
these presents more nerer. Than the king well regarded them. First there were
four pottes of gold / six lauers of gold / and six plattes of gold: All
this vessel wayed a hundred and fyftie mark of gold. In like manner a another
sort of burgesses richely apparelled all in one lyuerey / came to the queen
and presented her another lytter / which was borne in to her chamber /
showing how the good men of Paris did reco^mende them to her grace and sent
her that present. Which present was a ship of gold / two great flago^s of
gold / two dredge boxes of gold / two saltes of gold / six pottes gold /
six lauers of gold.xii. Lamps of silver / two basins of silver. The so^me
was three hundred mark / what gold what silver. This present was brought in a
lytter between two men / one in semblaunce of a Bear / and the other in
semblaunce of an Unicorn. The third present in likewise was brought in to the
duches of Thourayns chamber by two men / fygured in the form of two black
Moors richely apparelled / with white towelles about their heedes like
sarazins. The lytter was fair and rich / covered with a fine clothe of sylke
and brought by.xii. burgesses all in one apparel / who gave this present to
the said duchess. In the which present there was a ship of gold / a great
pot of gold / two ewers gold / two great plattes gold / two saltes gold /
six pottes silver / two dosin saucers sylner / two dosyn boules silver. So^me
gold and silver two hundred marks. This present greatly reioysed the duches
of Thourayne / as it was reason / for it was goodly and rich / and curtesly
she thanked them of their gift. Thus this Tuesdaye these presents were given
to the king / ye queen / and to the duchess of Thourayne. It was greatly to be
consydred the valeur of these presents / and also the puyssaunce of the
parisyens. For it was showed me by one who saw all these p^sentes / that they
cost the parisiens more than threscore thousand crowns of gold. After these
presents this delivered / it was time to go to dinner: But that day the king
and the queen and other ladies dyned in their chambres / ye sooner to have done:
For at three of the clock at after dinner they should draw in to the field of
saint Katheryne / where as there was ordained stages and scaffoldes a great
nombre / for the king and the queen and other to behold the iustes.

Now shall I name by order / the knights that were called the kings knights
/ of the son of gold there were thyrtie of the^.

First the duke of Berrey / the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone / the
earl de la March / sir Iaquemarte of Burbone his brother / the lord Guillyam
of Namure / sir Olyuer of Clysson constable of France / sir Johan of Vien /
sir James of Vien lord of Espaigny / sir Guy of Tremoyle / sir Gillyam his

barone Dinury / sir Willyam Marcyell / sir Raynolde of Roye / sir Geffrey of
Caryn / sir Charles of Changeet / and sir Gylliam of Lignac. All these knights
were armed and sheldes like there in the son raye / and about three of the
clock they were in the place of saint Kateryne / and thither was come ladies
and damsels. And first the queen came thither in a chare rychely aparelled /
and all other ladies in good order / and entered into the scaffoldes that were
ordained for them. Than came the french king ready apparelled to just / which
pastyme he loved right well / he was well accompanied. Than the iustes began
/ there were many lords of diverse countries. Sir Gyllyam of Heynalt earl of
Ostrenant iusted right goodly / and so did such knights as came with him / as
the lord of Gomminies / sir Johan of Andregenes / the lord of Cautan / sir
Ausell of Transegynes / and sir Clinquart of Hermo / all did well their
deuoyre to the prays of the ladies. Also there iusted well the duke of Irelande
/ who was all that seasone with the french king. Also there iusted well a
knight of Almayne / beside the Ryne / called sir Seruays of Mirando. These
iustes were well continued / but there were so many knights that one could
not rynne for another / and the duste with rynnynge of their horses was so
great / that it troubled them sore. The lord of Coucy did maruelously well.
These iustes continued till it was night / than they departed / and the ladies
brought to their lodgings. The king with his company was brought to his
lodging of saint Pole / and there was a supper for the ladies / with such
haboundau^ce / that it were hard to record it / and the feast and revel with
singing and daunsyng till the next morning the son rysinge. And the prise
of the iustes of the aunswerers / that had best done and lengest continued /
was given to the french king / by consent of all the ladies / and judgment
of the harauldes. and of the chalengers the Halze of ^launders / bastard
brother to the duchess of Burgoyne. The knights complained of the dust so
that some said they lost their deeds by reason thereof. The king made
prouysion for it / he ordained mo than two hundred barrelles of matter that
watered the place / whereby the ground was well amended / and yet the next day
they had duste enough and to much. Than the wednysdaye came to Paris the
earl of saint Pole from out of England / he had made great haste to come to
these iustes and feast / and he had left behind him in England sir Johan of
Chatell Morant / to bring the charter of the treuce with him. The earl of
saint Pole was well welcomed of the king and of all other lords / and the
Queen and all other were glad of his coming.

ON the wednysdaye after dinner every man drew to the field / and the ladies
came thither in goodly array / as they had done the day before / and mounted
upon their stages. Than the iustes began fyersly / and was well continued till
it was night. Than every person returned / and the ladies had a great supper
at saint Polle. Than the pryses were given by consent of the ladies / and
judgment of the harauldes. of the answerers / the prise was given to a squire
of Haynalte called Johan de Flaron / who was come thither in the company of
therle of Ostrenant. and of the chalengers / the prise was given to a squire of
the duke of Burgoyns / called Johan de Pokerers. And again the thursdaye
iusted knights and squyers all together: every man payned him self to do well
/ and it endured till night. And the ladies supped again at saint Polle / and
there the prise was given of the utter party to sir Charles of Armoyes / and
of them within to a squire of the queen's / called Lons. The frydaye the king
made a dinner to all the ladies and damoselles / and about the end of the
dinner / there entered in to the hall (the king sytting at the table) the
duchess of Berrey / the duchess of Burgoyne / the duches of Thourayne / the
cou^tes of saint Polle / the lady of Coucy / and a great meny of other ladies
and damsels. they brought in two knights on horseback / armed at all pieces
for the iustes / with their spears on their thyes. The one was sir Raynold of
Roy / and the other sir Bouciquant ye younger / and there they two iusted goodly
together. Than came thither other knights / ser Raynold of Troyes sir Gyllyam
of Namure / sir Charles of Armoyes / and the lord of Garancyers / the lord of
Nantoyllet Lardenoys of Ostende and diverse other. all these iusted there the
space of two hours before the king and the ladies. than they returned to
their lodgings. That friday such ladies and damsels as would return to
their own houses / took their leaves of the king and of the queen / and also
such lords as would depart. The king and the queen thanked them of the
pain they had taken / coming to his feast.

How the lord of the Chateau Morante / whom the earl of saint Polle had
left behind him in England / returned in to France with the charter of the
treuce / sealed by king Richard and his uncles / to endure three year by see
and by land. Cap. C.lviii.
AFter that all these lords and ladies were returned fro this great feast to
their own houses / than the lord of Chastell Morant / whom the lord of
saint Polle had left in England returned in to France / to the king and to
his counsel / and showed forth the charter of the treuce / sealed by king
Richard of England / and by his uncles and other / to endure three year / as
well by see as by land / and the words in the charter said. That whosoever
breketh by any manner of condition / any point or article contained in that
treaty / should be taken and reputed as traitors / and to rynne in a mortal
punysyon. And because that the lord of Coucy was sovereign capytayne chosen by
the king and his counsel / to defend and keep the outward marches /
between the river of Durdone and the sea / and all the country of Iuuergne and
Lymosyn. The copy of this treatye was delivered to him / to the entente that he
should publysshe and show it to all them that would do any thing to the
contrary. And also to the intent that they of Vandachor / of Chalusset of
Dorbesidousac / and of the garysons ye made war for the english title /
should have knowledge of that treuce / that they should make none excuse if
they fell in the pain. In likewise the marshall of France the lord Loys of
Xancer had also the copy thereof / which was right needful / for he was
governor of the outward marches of Languedoc / fro the river of Run and the
bridge of Amyngnon / and about the countries and signories apendau^t to the
river of Dordone / as the countries of Beaucaire / of Carcassone / of Tholous /
of rouergne / of Dagen / of Querca / of Bygore / of Pyergourte / and of
Lymogines. and in these countries were diverse garysons / that smally regarded
or obeyed any peace or truce / but always intended to make mar / as the
castle of Cullyer / and the strong castle of Londre in Bygore / on the
fronters of Byerne / they were greatly feared of their neighbors.

The marriage of king Loys son to the duke of Aniou / to the daughter of king
Peter of Aragone / and how he went with the queen of Napoles his mother to
Auignon / to se pope Clemente. Cap. C.lix.
IN this time there was a treatye made of a marriage between Loys of Aniowe /
son to the duke of Aniou / who wrote himself king of Napoles / of Cycyll /
and Iherusalem / and earl of Prouynce / and the daughter of king Peter of
Arragon. The queen of Napoles went to Auygnone to se pope Clement / and there
she found the lord of Coucy / and had in her company her young son Loys.
The lord of Coucy was right joyous of her coming. The queen was received
right honorably of pope Clement / and of the cardynalles / as she was well
worthy / for she was a noble woman / and a dilygent in all her business. There
she desired the lord of Coucye to help to convey her son Loyes in to the
realm of Arragone / and to be about him till he were married. The lord of
Coucye would not refuce it / but ordained him self so to do and said. Ma dame
/ there was no vyage this seuyn year / that I would be more gladder to
accomplisshe / than to go in to the marches of Cicyll and Naples / which my
lord your son / if I had license of the king my sovereign lord. Sir quod
the lady I thank you / I se well your good will / I doubt not but the king
will be content that ye go with my son in to Aragon: And the queen of Arragon
will be glad to se you / for your daughter has married her brother sir Henry of
bare The lord of Coucy agreed to go this voyage. Thus the young king of
Cicyll took his journey well accompanied / when he had taken his leave of the
Pope and of his mother / all weeping: For at the departing of the mother and
the son / caused their hertes to relente: For they should depart far a
so^der / and knew not when to se together again For it was ordained / that
when the marriage was accomplysshed / that the young king and the young Queen
should take the sea at the port of Barcelone / and so to go and arryue at the
port of Naples / or as nere as they might.

SO long this young king Loyes iourneyed / that he passed Mountpellyer and
Besyers / and so came to Narbone / where he was received ioyfullye of every
man. There they refresshed the^ and their horses one day / and than departed
and went to Parpygnen: the first town of the realm of Arragon. The coming
of this young king was well known in the court of the king of Arragon. He
sent men to mete with him and to convey him / as the vycount of Ro^uebertyn
and sir Raymonde of Baighes. So long they rode / that they ca^e to the city of
Barcelone / where the king and the Queen and their daughter was. There the
young king was nobl^ received / and specially the queen of Arragon was right
ioyouse of the coming of the lord of Coucy / and thanked the young king her
son that should be / for bringynge of him in his company / and said / that
all other matters should do and atcheue the better. This Marriage was confyrmed
between these two children / but because winter approached / they delayed their
voyage going to the Sea / For in winter the great Sees are perilous. They said
they would make their prouisyon that winter / to go in to Naples the next
March after. The lord of Coucy being in Arragon / received letters fro the
French king / commaundynge him to return. Than he took his leave of the
king of Arragon and of the queen / and of the young king and his wife / and of
all other lords such as were there / and departed. And if he might have had
leysar / he would have returned by Auignon to have seen the pope and the old
queen af Naples. But he sent to them his excuse / and returned by Auuergne in
to France.

WHan^e this marriage was made between the young king Loyes of Cycyll / and the
daughter of the king of Arragon / whereby there was great alya^ces between the
parties / and they of Arragon were bound to aid and to serve the young king /
to bring him in to the realm of Naples / and not to leave him till he had the
realm pesably of Naples and of Cicyll / with the appendau^tes / as Paul and
Calabre / and the city of Gaiet / the which Margarete of Duras held. The
aragonoys should serve him as long as his war endured with.ii. hundred
spears at their cost and charge / and a thousand crosbowes / and a thousand
bregandiers. When the sweet time of March was come / and that the wyndes were
apealed and ye waters swaged of their rages / and the wodes reuerduced / and
that their prouysions were made ready at Barcelone / and the galees ready such
as should go with the young king. Than he and his young queen took their
leaves of the king of Aragone and of the queen / who wept at their departing.
than the queen reco^maunded the young queen her daughter to the earl of Roodes
/ a valiant knight / and to sir Raymon of Baighes. These two took ye special
charge natwithsta^dinge that the earl of Vrgell and the earl of Line were there
in a great company. In these galees were a fyftene hundred spears / two
thousand crosbowes / and two thousand of other men of war / with darts and
pauesses. They went thus fortifyed and well acompanyed / to resyst the better
if need were against their enemies. And also to resyst all rencou^ters upon
the sea / for it is a long way by the sea fro Barcelone to Naples. And
Margarete of Duras their adversary might trouble the^ by the way / therefore
they thought to go surely. Now we will leave to speak of this young king of
Cicyll / and speak of other business of the realm of France.

How the French king had desire to go and visyte the far parts of his
realm: and how he went first in to Burgoyne and to Auygnon to se pope
Clement. Cap. C.lx.
AFter this great Feast was accomplisshed / and that every lord and lady were
gone home to their own houses / as ye have herd here before: and that the
French king saw that he had truce with England for three year: he had than
ymaginacion to go and visit his realm / specially the vtwarde marchesse of
Languedocke. For the lord de la River and sir Johan Mercier / who were as than
chief of his preuy counsel. They exhorted him to go to Auygnon to se pope
Clement and the cardynalles / who desired to se him / and also to go to Tholous
/ for they said to the king. Sir / a king in his youth ought to visyte his
realm / and to know his people / and to learn how they be governed / the
which should be greatly to his profit / and the better to be beloved with his
subjects. The king lightly enclyned to their counsel / for he had desire to
traueyle and se new things. And ye lord de la River who was but newly come
out of those marchesse / herd great complayntes of the people of Tholous / of
Carcassone / and of Beaucayre. and they desired greatly to se the king / for
they had been sore charged with tails and aids by ye duke of Berrey / by the
informacion of a servant of his called Betysache / who had pytie of no man: He
so pylled the people that nothing was left / therefore he counsayled the king
to go thither to provide some remedy / And also that the king should send for
the earl of Foize to come to him to Tholous. The king made him ready to go
thither / and sent before all the way that prouisyon should be made for his
coming / and sent word thereof to his uncle the Duke of Burgoyne and to his
au^te the duchess / how he would come a long through their country / and
would se his cosyns their children / and to bring in his company his brother
the duke of Thourayne / and his uncle of Burbone / which pleased greatly ye
duke and the duchess. And the duke caused to be proclaimed a feast and a iustes
to be holden at Dygnon. and knights and squiers of Burgoyne / of Sauoy / and
of other marches adjoining were required to be at this feast. And so every man
ordered themself accordingly.

THus whiles the kings prouisyon was a making / to go to Auignon and to
Languedocke. The duke of Burgoyne on his part made great prouisyon to receive
the king / and so did every man in their marchesse / that purposed to be at
ye feast at Dignon. The same season other matters fell in France. ye have herd
how the duke of Irelande (who was called earl of Oxenforde) was banysshed out
of England / by the uncles of king Richard / and specially the duke of
Gloucestre had grettest dyspleasure to him / so that to save him self he was
fled in to Hollande / and tarried there but a small season / in the town of
Dordregh for he was feign to depart thens. For duke Aubert / who was lord of
that town and of Holande / denied him the taryeng in his country / for he
would not keep him against the will of his cosyns germayns of England / for
all that the king of England had written for him / yet he was feign to
depart and to go to Trecte a fraunches town for all manner of people / payeng
for that they take. And the duke of Irelande had enough to pay. For beside
that he brought with him / he had threscore thousand frankes out of France
fro the Constable / for the redemption of Johan of Bretayne. And he was come to
ye French king under saueconducte / and was there with him more than a year.
The king made him good chere / because he was a stranger / How be it true it
was / though this duke was with the king / yet ye lord of Coucy hated him in
his herie / for he had good cause. For though the duke in all affairs was
provided of wit / honor / eloquence / and of great largess / yet he had
greatly trespassed against the lord of Coucies daughter / who was his wife
laufully spoused. And forsook her without any tytell of reason / but by false
and yuell temptacyon and disceyte / was disceyued. And took another wife / a
damsel of the queen of Englandes of the country of Boeme / and the king and
ye queen of England synfully consented thereto. And was dispensed by pope
Vrbane of Rome / at the instau^te desire of the king and queen of England.
This sin grieved greatly the conscience of the duke of Irelande. And because
the lord of Coucy / who was of the counsel of France / and well worthy so
to be / for he had done good service / and was well able to do. He procured so
much by means of his friends / as sir Olyuer of Clysson and the lord de la
River sir Johan Marcyer and other / That it was said to the duke of Irelande /
that he should depart out of France / and to go and chose himself another
place to abide in / where he list / so that it be not in the realm of France
/ and thither he should surely be conveyed. The duke of Irelande saw well /
how he was daily in paryll by means of ye lord of Coucy and his lygnage.
Wherefore he thought it should be best for him to go far of / rather than to
abide nere. than he advised to draw in to Brabant / and desired the king to
write to the duchess of Brabant / yt it would pleace her to suffer him pesably
to abide in her country. The king wrote to his aunte the duchess of Brabant
/ and she condisce^ded to the kings desire. The duke of Irelande was conducted
by men of the kings to Louayne and there he tarried / and sometime he went to a
castle not far of fro the town of Louaygne / the which he had borrowed of a
knight of Brabant. With the duke of Irelande was the archebysshop of york /
who in likewise was banysshed out of England / all for one cause. This
bishop was one of the Neuelles of England / who in the country of
Northu^berlande were puissaunt men / both of lands and of lynage. There
tarried these two lords at Louayne or there about / as I herd say / as long
as they lived: For they could never come to mercy nor peace with ye king of
Englandes uncles. I can no farther speak of them.

ABout the feast of saint Mychell the French king departed fro his house of
Beauty beside Paris / and left there the queen / and took his way by Troy in
Champayne to go in to Burgoyne / and his uncle the duke of Burbone / and duke
Loyes of Thourayne and the lord of Cou^y / and many other lords and knights
in his company. The king rode so long that he came to Dignon. The duke of
Burgoyne and the earl of Neuers his son were come before to the Chatelon on
the river of Said. wha^ the king was come to Dignon / the duchess of Burgoyne
and the countess of Neuers her daughter received the king joyfully / and all
other lords for love of the king. And to his welcomynge to Dygnon / many
ladies and damsels were come thither to se him. there was the lady of Sully /
the lady of Vergy / the lady of Pagny / and diverse other fair ladies and
fresshe / and well apparelled. Than began feestynge / daunsynge / and
carolynge. These ladies enforsed themself to dance and to sing / and to make
joy for love of ye king: and ye duke of Thourayne / the duke of Burbone and of
the lord of Coucy. Monday / tuesday / and wednisday / all three days there was
goodly iustes / and prices given to ye best doers. The king was eight days in
ye town of Dignon in great triu^phe and sport. The x. day he took leave of
his uncle the duke of Burgoyne / and of the duchess and their children.
Thentent of ye duke of Burgoyne was shortly after to follow the king his
nephue and to go with him that journey. The king deperted fro Dignon / when he
had taken his leave of all ladies and damoselles / and rode so long by his
iourneys that he came to Vile neufe beside Auignon. There his house royal was
apparelled for him / and there was the cardynals of Amyens / of Aigreuell of
saint Marcell / of Chatell neufe / and mo than xiii. other came and met the
king in the field / and all were glad of the kings coming.

THe duke of Berrey was come to Auygnon and was lodged in the popes palais /
but he ca^e to Vile neufe to the king / and lay in the lyuere of arras called
Amontays / in the way to Mountpellyer. The duke of Burgoyne arrived there the
next day that ye king came thither / by the water of Rone / for the duke took a
barge at Lyonsur le rone. Thus the king and these four dukes were together.
Than they determined to pass the bridge of Auignon and to go and se the pope.
And about.ix. of the clock in the morning the king passed the bridge /
acompanyed with his brother and his three uncles and.xii. cardynalles / and so
went to the popes palace / and pope Clement was ready in his chamber of
consystorie / syttyng in his chair of papalyte. When the French king came in
to the chamber and saw the pope he enclyned him self / and when he came nere
ye pope rose / and the king kyst his hand and his mouth. Than the pope sat
down and caused the king to sir down by him / on a place purposely prepared
for him. Than ye dukes kyst the popes hand and sat down among the
cardynals. Anon it was time of dinner / than they drew in to the popes great
chamber / where the tables were ready covered. the pope wa^shed and satte down
at a table alone and kept his estate. The French king satte down at another
table alone / and the cardynalles and dukes satte down in order. The dinner was
plentyfull / and after dinner they had wine and spyces. Than the king and ye
four dukes went in to their cha^bres / each of them had a chamber apparelled in
the palace / and there they tarried a certain days. The.v. day after that the
king came thither / ye young earl of Sauoy cosyn to the king / and nephue to the
duke of Burbone came thither. The king was right joyful of his coming. The
French king / the duke of Thourayne his brother / and the earl of Sauoye /
who were light of courage and of spyrite / though they were lodged in the popes
palais / nere to the pope and to the cardynalles: yet for all that they would
not absteyne to dance and to caroll / and to make sport among the ladies and
damoselles of Auignon. And the earl of Genesne brother to the pope / brought
them in aquayntaunce with the ladies and damoselles of the town. The king
gave great gifts to the ladies and damoselles / whereby he had great laud and
praise.

THe pope and the cardinals were right joyful of the kings being there / as
it was reason that they should so be / for without the love of the French
king their port should have been but small. For they co^sydred or ought to
have consydred / that there was no king christened / that were obedyent to them
/ except it were for love and favor / and alyaunce of the French king. The
king of Spaygne and the king of Scotts obeyed this pope Clement / and the
king of Aragon was but newly so determined / and that made the queen yolande
of Bare (who was cosyn germayne to the French king) else he had not done so
/ for before / the king of Aragon and his father before him was as neuter.
Therefore this pope and cardynalles ought well to feast the French king /
seeing their puyssaunce and profit that they lived by to keep their estate /
came by means of the French king. Thus the king tarried there a certain
season in great joy and sport. And for joy of the kings coming thither /
the pope opyned his graces to all clerks being in the court for the space of
a month. And gave the nomynacions to the king / of all coledges / cathedrals /
and to every coledge two prebendes / and revoked all other graces before given
/ and would that the kings graces should proceed before (as they did) whereby
many of the kings clerks were promoted. Also the pope gave graces to the duke
of Thourayne / the duke of Berrey / the duke of Burgoyne / and to the lord
Coucy / all other were stopped that had been granted before. The pope was so
curtesse and lyberall / that for love of the kings coming / he granted every
thing that was asked.

When the king had been there a certain space / the pope showed him his
complaynt / how that the other pope of Rome greatly hyndred his right / and
made much trouble and diffrence in ye church. The king herd him well / and
promised this pope Clement that after his return again in to France / he
would entende to none other thing / but to bring the church in one accord.
With those words the pope was greatly conforted. The king took his leave and
returned to Vile Neufe / and so did his brother and uncles of Berrey and
Burgoyne. And there on a day the king made a dinner to all the cardynalles and
to the earl of Genesne brother to the Pope. After dinner they took their leaves
/ for the king said / that the next day he would ride toward Mou^tpellyer /
and he thanked them of the reverence that they had done to him. The cardynalles
returned to Auygnon. Than it was ordained that the king should depart the
next day / his brother and the duke of Burbone in his company. And so he did
/ and took leave of his uncles of Berey and of Burgoyne / and said / how they
should return in to their own countries / for they should go no further with
him at that time: For he said he would go to Tholous and send for therle of
Foiz to come thither. His uncles were content therewith / for as than the king
had such counsel about him / that the duke of Berrey and the duke of
Burgoyns voices were not herd / without it were in small matters. The gouernyng
of La^guedocke was taken away fro the duke of Berrey / and divided in to
Seneschaunces to the kings profit / whereof the countries and marchesse of
Carcassone / of Besyers / of Narbone / of Fonges / of Bygore / and of Tholous /
were greatly reioysed. For before that season they had been sore oppressed with
tails / that the duke of Berrey had raised on them: as ye shall here after
when the matter requires it.

When the duke of Berey and the duke of burgoyn saw that the king would go to
Mou^tpellyer and visyte La^guedoc / and would not suffer the^ to go in his
company / they were sore displeased therwt. howbeit sagely they disymuled the
matter / and said each to other. The king gothe in to Languedoc to make
in^sycyon on the^ that governed there / and to make a treaty with therle of Foiz
/ who is ye most proudest earl now lyue^g. he never loved nor praised any
neighbor that ever he had / nouther French king / England / Spaygne /
Arragon / nor Nauer. The king takes with him of his counsel / no mo but
River and Mercier / Mo^tague and the Beghe of Villayns. How say you to this
brother quod the duke of Berrey? The duke of Burgoyne answered and said. The
king our nephue is young / and he believes young counsel: they shall
disceyue him / for surely the conclusyon shall not be good / and that ye shall
se. It must behoue us to suffer for this p^sente time / but the time shall come
that such as cou^saileth him shall repent and the king also. Let him go on
gods name whider it shall please him / and let us return in to our own
coutreis / As long as we hold to guyder / there is none shall do us any
wrong. We are two of the chief members of France. Thus these two dukes
devised together / and the French king departed the next day and took the way
to Nymes / and rode thither to dinner. The said two dukes tarried still with the
Pope three days / and ye lord of Coucy in likewise. the fourth day they
departed and rode in to their own countries / and the king went fro Nymes and
lay all night at Lunell.

When the king deperted fro Lunell he went to dinner to Moutpellyer / it was but
three little miles. There he was received of ye burgesses / ladies / and
damoselles of the town / for they greatly desired to se the king / and many
rich presents were given to him / for Mou^tpellyer is a puissaunt town /
rich / and full of merchandise. The king praised the town much / and well
consydred their puissau^ce. And it was showed the king that the town had been
much richer before thanne it was at that present time: For the duke of Aniou
and the duke of Berrey / each of them in their turn had greatly pylled
them. The king was sorry that ye good people had endured so much do^mage / and
said / how he would reform the country in to a better state Than it was showed
the king / that the poverty of that town was nothing / to that he should
find forward / For that town of it self has good means of recouerau^ce /
by reason of the merchandise yt is there used / both by land and by see. But
in the marchesse of Carcassone and Tholous / and therabout / where as the said
two dukes had the governance. Look on what thing they had puyssaunce to lay
on their hands there was nothing left / but all taken away. For ye shall find
ye people there so poor / that such as were wont to be rich and puissaunt /
now they are scant able to labor their vynes nor lands. It is a great pity
to se them / their wives / and children. for they have had every year five or
six tails laid on their shulders / and are rau^somed to the third or
fourth part of their substance / and sometime to all toguyder. One tail
could not be paid / but yt another was ready in ye neck thereof. for ser / as
it is well known these two dukes your uncles while they ruled in La^guedocke /
they have leuyed in ye country fro Vile Neufe in to Tholousyn / round about
to the river of Garon / and retournyng to the river of Dordone / the so^me
of.xxx. hundred thousand frankes. And specially sithe the duke of Aniou
departed / the duke of Berrey has done the more do^mage for he found the
plain country and co^montie in good case / for the duke of Aniou took but of
the rich men / who had wherewith to pay. But the duke of Berrey spared another
poor nor rich / for he gadered all before him specially by one of his
counsel his treasourer named Betysache / who is of the nacyon of the city of
Besyers. As ye shall here by the complayntes of the people that will cry out
on him. To these words the king said. As god have my soul / I shall provide
for this matter or I return / and I shall punisshe the trespasours. For I
shall make an inquysycion of the servants and o^nycers of mine uncles such as
had ruled here before in the parcies of Languedocke / and such as have
deserved shall be corrected.

The king tarried at Mount pellyer the space of.xii. days / for the order of
the town and the pastyme of ladies and damoselles / such as he found there
pleased him greatly. To say truth the king / as at / that time was in his
lusty youth / and light and quycke of spyrite. He daunsed and caroled among
the frysco ladies and damoselles of ye town sometime all night: And gave and
made bankettes and suppers largely / and would give to the ladies and damsels
rings of gold and chains / to them that he reputed worthy The king did so
much that he had great laud and praise. And some of them would that he had
tarried there lengar than he did / for he kept revel / daunsyng / and solas:
and every day it was new to begin. ye have herd oftentimes said / how the
sport of ladies and damsels encorageth the hertes of young lusty gentylmen /
and causes them to desire and to seek to get honor. I say this because with
the king there was three gentylmen of high enterprice and of great valor and
that they well showed / as ye shall here. First there was the young sir
Boucequant / the other sir Raynold of Roy / and the third the lord of saint
Pie. These three knights were chamberleyns with the king / and well beloved
with him for they were well worthy They were fresshe / and served him well in
arms / and in all other matters. These three being at Mountpellier among the
ladies and damsels / they took on them to do arms the next somer after. And
as I was informed / ye pri^cipall cause that enclyned the^ thereto was / as I
shall show you. ye know well as it has been rehearsed here before in this
history how that in ye days of king Charles there was an English knight
called sir Peter Courtney (a valiant knight in arms) ca^e out of England in
to France to Paris / and demanded to do arms with sir Guy of Tremoyle / in
the presence of the king or of such as would se them. sir Guy would not refuce
his offer / and in the presence of the king and of other lords / they were
armed on a day and ran toguyder one course. And than the king would not suffer
them to ryn again toguyder / wherewith the^glyss he knight was right yuell
content. For as he showed / he would have furnysshed his challenge to the
vttraunce / but he was apeased with fair words. and it was said to him /
that he had done enough he ought to be content therewith. The king and the duke
of Burgoyne gave him fair gifts and presents. Than he returned again
toward Calays. And the lord of Clary who was a friscay and a lusty knight
was charged to convey him. They rode so long toguyder that they came to
Lucynen / where as the countess of saint Poule lay / suster to king Richard
of England. The lady was joyful of the coming thither of sir Peter Courtney
/ for she had married first his cosyn the lord of Courtney / but he dyed
young / and after she married the earl of saint Poule. The Englisshe men called
her madame Courtney / and not Countess of saint Poule.

How sir Peter Courteney came in to France to do arms with sir Guye of
Tremoyle / And how the lord of Clary conveyed him / and by what occasyon he
did arms with him in the marchesse of Calais. Cap. C.lxi.
THus as sir Peter of Courtney and the lord of Clary were at Lucenen in
Arthoys with the countess of saint Paul / who was right ioyouse of their
coming. And as they devised of many things / the countess demanded of sir
Peter Courtney / what he thought of the state of France. He answered and
said. Certainly madame / the states of France are well and goodly served / we
can not be so served in our country. Sir quod the lady. Do the lords of
France and the manner there content you? Have they not made you good chere?
Surely madame quod he / their there contenteth me passynglye well / but in the
case that I passed the Sea for / they have but easily acquyted me therein. And
madame I will ye know / that if the lord of Clary here present had come in
to England / and desired to have done arms with any man / he should not have
departed or he had been answered at his pleasure. But I am served to the
contrary. True it was sir Guye dela Tremoyle and I were armed in the field
each against other / and ran toguyder but one course. Than it was showed me
fro the king that we should do no more / saying how we had done enough.
Wherefore madame I say and will say where soever I become / that I could find
none to do arms with me / and that was not in my defaute / but in the knights
of France. The lord of Clary noted well his words / and held his pease with
great pain. How be it he suffered him / because he had the charge of the
co^ueyaunce of him. Than the countess said. Sir / ye departed right honorably
fro France / when ye obeyed to the kings desire / for ye could do no more /
sithe it was his pleasure that ye should not.

IN coming / returnyng / and doing as ye have done / none can lay any fault
in you. All such as shall here there of / on this side the sea or on the other
/ shall repute in you more honor than blame wherefore sir I require you be
content therewith. Madame quod the knight so I do and shall do / I shall never
take thought for it. Thus they left that matter and fell in other talking:
There he tarried all that day and night. The next morning sir Petr Court nay
took his leave of the Countess of saint Poule / and she gave him at his
departing a little chain of gold / and to the lord of Clary another. Thus
in the morning they departed fro Lucenen / and took the way to Bouloygne and
came thither and there lay all night / and the next day rode toward
Margyson to go to Calais.

BItwene Boloygne and Calays are but seuyn or eight leages / and fair plain
way. When they came nere to Calais / there sir Peter of Courtney said to the
lord of Clary. Sir / we be now in the king of Englandes land / and ye have
well acquyted you in the conueyaunce of me and of your company / I thank you.
The lord of Clary who had displeasure in his heart / for the words that sir
Peter had spoken at Lucenen / in the presens of the countess of saint Pole and
other. Which words he thought he would not suffer to rest in that case / for
he reputed them to haute and to high against the honor of the chiualry of
France / for he understood him that he said how he was come out of England
in to France / to do arms / and how there were none that would answer him.
Than the lord of Clary at their leave taking said. Sir Peter / ye be now in
the king of Englandes land / and sir / I have conveyed you hyder by the
commandment of the king my master and of the duke of Burgoyne. And ye
remember well this last day when we were in ye countess of saint Poules
chamber / who made us good chere. ye spoke there over largely / as me thinks
/ to the great preiudyce and blame of the knights of France. For ye said /
how ye came fro the kings court / and could find none to do arms with you.
By ye which words may be understand / that there is no knight in France
that dare do arms or just with you / three courses with a spear. Wherefore sir
/ I will that ye know that here I offer my self / though I be one of ye
most symplest knights in all France. And say and iustifye / that the realm
of France is not so void of knights / but that ye shall well find yuowe to
do deeds of arms with you. And sir / if ye list ye shall find me ready to
answer you / be it incontynente / this night or to morrow. I say not this
for any hatered that I have to your person. I do it all only to maynteyne the
honor of our pertie / For I would not ye should return to Calais or in to
England / to make your auaunt that without stroke stryken / ye should
disconfyte the knights of France. Sir answer me if it please you to my
words. Sir Peter Courtney was soon cou^sayled what answer to make / and
said. Sir of Clary / ye speak well / and I accept your demand And I will
that to morrow in this same place / ye be armed at your pleasure / and I shall
be in like wise. And than let us rynne each at other three courses with a
spear / and thereby ye shall win again the honor of the French court /
and ye shall do me a great pleasure. Sir quod the lord of Clary / I promise
you / I shall not fail to be here at the hour ye have assigned. Thus these two
knights promised each other to just. The lord of Clary returned to Marguysen
/ and there provided him of his armure / shield / spear and horse. He had
anon all that he lacked for on the fronters of Calays and Boloyne men were
soon provided. There he made his prouisyon / as shortly as he might / for he
would natte that over many should have known thereof. In like manner sir Peter
Courtney whan^e he came to Calays / he forgate not the promise that he had
made. But provided him of good armure / and of every thing else. As for
harness he had ready / such as he had carried with him out of England in to
France. As at that time sir Johan Bernes was captain of Calays. Sir Peter
showed him the promise yt was made between him and the lord of Clary. Than sir
Johan Bernes said / how he would accompany him thither / and other good
fellows of Calays. The next day these two knights came to the place appointed
/ the English knight came much better accompanied than did the French
knight / for the captain of Calays was with him. When they were come together
/ there was but few words between them. They knew well enough wherefore they
were come. they were both well armed and horsed / and took their sheldes. Than
they took their spears with sharp heedes well fyled / and spurred their
horses and ran toguyder. The first course they failed / wherewith they were
both sore displeased. At the second just they met so toguyder / that the
lord of Clary struck the English knight through the ^arge and through the
shulder a handful / and therewith he fell fro his horse to the earth. The
Lord of Clary passed forth and kept his course and turned and stood still /
for he saw well how the English he knight was unhorsed / and how that many
men were about him He thought surely than that he was hurt / for his spear was
brokenne in pieces: Than he rode to them. And the English men came to the
lord of Clary and said. Sir / ye be no courtesse iuster. Wherefore quod the
lord of Clary. because quod they ye have hurt this knights shulder / ye might
more curtesly have iusted. sirs quod he / that curtesy lay not in me / seeing I
was apparelled to just / for the same case or worse might have fallen to me
as well as to him. How be it sir / I require you demand of him or else will
I / whyder he will do any more or ^atte. Than sir Johan Bernes said. Nay nay
sir knight / ye may depart when ye list ye have done enough. Than the lord
of Clary departed with his company / and the English men led sir Peter
Courtney to Calays / to be healed of his hurtes. And the lord of Clary
returned in to France / thinking that he had right well done / and that he
should have had for that deed great laud and praise / But I shall show you
what fell thereof.

When tidings came to the French king and to the duke of burgoyne / and to
their counsel: how that the lord of Clarye had done arms with sir Peter
Courtney / in retournynge to Calais / so that the said sir Peter was hurt /
and in paryll of death. The king and the duke / and specially sir Guye of
Tremoyle were sore dyspleased with the lord of Clary / and said: how he had
done (at the leest) as much as to lose his lands / and to be bannysshed the
realm of France for ever / without repele. And so^e other (such as would him
no good will) said: how he had done like a false traytoure / seeing a
strange knight under the kings save guard / should be required by him to do
deeds of arms / and by yt means to be brought to the ieopardye of death. They
said such a deed ought not to be pardoned. The lord of Clary was sent for:
he came to the king and to the duke of Burgoyne. There he was examyned and
laid to his charge / and demanded how he durst be so outrageous to a knight
stranger that was come to the kings court for good love and to exalte his
honor / to do feats of arms / and deperted thens with good love and joy.
And the entente that he should not be troubled by the way / in his retournyng
was delivered to him to conduyt. and than at the depertynge of both realms /
he to be so bold to do arms with him in ca^pe or iustes mortal / without
license of his soueraygne lord of whom he holds his land. It was showed him
the trespass was so great / that it was not to be pardoned / but to be
punysshed so highely / that all other should take ensample thereby. The lord of
Clary when he herd those words he was abashed / for he thought he had done
well / and for to have had thank. Than he said. My lords / it is of truth
/ sir Peter of Courtney was delivered to me to conducte and to keep him company
till he came to Calais / or to the fro^ters thereof. And of all that I had in
charge I have well and truly acquyted my self / and if need be / I shall
prove it by the witness of him self. And true it was / that by ye way when
we came to Lucyen to the countess of saint Poule / who received and made us
good chere. There sir Peter Courtney had certain words / as I shall show
you.

THe countess demanded of him and said. sir Peter of Courtney. how are ye
content with the Lords of France / and with the manner of France? he
answered courtesly and said. Madame / the manner of France is right noble and
goodlye. As for the lords of France I am right well content with their chere
/ except in one thing / and that is with great pain and traueyle and great
cost / I have issued out of England to do deeds of arms / and so came to
the french kings court / but there I knew not with whom to do arms. Thus my
lords / when I herd him say so in the presence of so noble a lady / as the
countess of saint Poule / suster to the king of England / the words were
right heavy to me to bear. how be it I suffered them for that time / because I
had the charge of the conueyaunce of him. I never made semblaunt thereof to him
/ as long as we were in company togider within the realm of France. And at
our leave taking in the marchesse of Calais / true it is / than I laid unto
him the said words and said / how they were not courtesly spoken / nor
honorably. For the words sounded that the chiualry of France was so abated /
that none durst do deeds of arms with him Than I said if he would abide thereby
/ that I was one of the knights of France borne of the nacyon. And I said I
would not that he should make his auaunte in England / that he could not find
in France / nor by the way / with whom to do arms. Therefore I said I was
ready / and desired to do arms with him / and to fulfylle his pleasure and
desire / as to rynne three courses with a spear / the same day or the next.
Certainly my lords / I said these words for the honor of the realm of
France / and the chyualry thereof. And me thonght he had great joy thereof /
and accepted to do arms with me the next day and so did I / and the next
day we met at the same place. He was a co^panyed with them of the garyson of
Calais / And with me there were certain of the fronters there / knights and
squyers: as ye lord of Mount carell and sir Johan of Longuyllers. There we
iusted toguyder as well as we could / and the adventure of arms fell so yt at
the second course I struck him through the shulder / so that he fell to the
earth. Than I returned again to know if he would do any more. Than the
captain of Calis said it was sufiycient that was done / and that I might
depart when I list. And than I returned. I believed I had right well done /
and well defended the honor of the realm of France / and of the knights
therein. Thus I have showed you the very truth of this deed / for my well
doing of this ame^des shall follow / I report me and will abide the judgment
of my lord the Constable / and my lords the high marshalles of France. And
beside that / to the voice and discrecion of the knight himself sir Peter
curtney / at whose request I did these arms. And also I report me to all
knights and squyers of honor / both of France and of England / credably
enfourmed of the hole matter.

When the lord of Clary had showed the matter / and sagely made his excusacio^s
/ as ye have herd. It greatly aswaged their and displeasure of th^^ that had
complained of him. How be it for all his words and excusacions / he could not
be delivered / but was committed to prisone. and there tarried a long season in
great danger / of lesyng of all his lands / and to be banysshed for ever. but
the lord of Coucy and ^he duke of Burbon / they labored sore for his
delyuerau^ce / and with much pain they made his peace / with the aid of the
countess of saint Puole / before whom the words were spoken. Than at his
deliuerau^ce it was said to him. Sir of Clary / ye supposed to have done right
well / how be it ye did shamefully / when ye offered to do arms with sir
Peter Courtney / who was under the kings save guard / and delivered to you to
conducte to Calays by the kings commandment. ye did a great outrage / when
ye renewed the words the which were spoken but in sport before the countess
of saint Poule. Or ye had done it / ye ought to have returned to ye king and
have showed him ye words that should have sowned against the honor of ye
knights of France: and than what counsel the king had given you / ye ought
to have followed. and because ye did not thus / ye have had this pain.
Beware better another time / and thank the lord of Burbone and the lord of
Coucy of your delyueraunce / for they have sore labored for you: and also ye
lady of sayut Poule. Quod the lord of Clary / my lords I thank you all /
how be it I thought I had done well. Thus he departed.

How the iustes at saint Inguelyert / otherwise called Sa^dyngfelde were
enterprised: By sir Reynolde of Roy / the young sir Boucyquant / and the lord
of saint Pie. Cap. C.lxii.
THe French king lay at the good town of mou^tpellyer in great myrthe and
sport / and at a banquet that the king made to the Ladies and damoselles of the
town / There was rehearsed all this said matter of the lord of Clary and of sir
Peter Courtney. True it was / I began to speak of three valiant knights / of
the young sir Bauciquaunt / sir Reynolde of Roy / and the lord of saint Pie.
The which three enterprised to do deeds of arms in the fronter beside Calais
in the time of Somer next after / abiding all knights and squiers strangers
the term of.xxx. days / who soever would just with the^ in iustes of peace
or of war. and because thenterprice of these three knights seemed to the
French king and his counsel to be an high enterprice. There it was said to
them / that they should put it in writing / because the king would se
thartycles thereof / that if they were to high or to outragyous / that the king
might amend them / because the king nor his counsel would not sustain any
thing that should be unreasonable. These three knights answered and said. It is
but reasone that we do thus / it shall be done. Than they took a clerk and
caused him to write as follows.

FOr the great desire that we have to come to the knowledge of noble gentlemen
/ knights and squiers strangers / as well of the realm of France as else
whereof far countries / we shall be at saint Ingylbertes / in the marches of
Calays / the twenty day of the month of May next coming / and there
contynewe thyrty days complete / the frydayes only except / and to deliver
all manner of knights and squyers / gentlemen strangers of any manner of nacyon
/ whatsoever they be that will come thither for the breaking of five spears /
outher sharp or rokettes at their pleasure. And without our lodgings shall be
the sheldes of our arms / both on the sheldes of peace and of war / and who
so ever will just / let him come or send the day before / and with a rod
touch which shield he please / if he touch ye shield of war / the next
day he shall just with which of the three he will. and if he touch the sheld
of peace he shall have the iustes of peace and of war. So that who soever
touch any of the sheldes show or cause to be showed their name to such as
shall be there lymyted by us to receive their names / and all such knights
strangers as will just / to bring some noble man on their party / who shall
be instructed by us what ought to be done in this case. And we require all
knights and squyers strangers that will come and just / that they think nor
ymagyn in us that we do this for any pride / hatred / or yuell will / but all
only we do it to have their honorable company and acquayntaunce / the which

And because that all gentlemen / noble knights and squiers to whom this shall
come to knowledge / in that it should be reputed ferme and stable / we have
sealed this present writynge with the seals of our arms. written at
Mountpellier the twenty day of Nouembre / in the year of our lord god a
thousand three hundred fourscore and nine / and signed thus. Raynolde du Roy /
Boucyquant / saint Pie.

OF the high courage and enterprise of these three knights the french king was
right ioyefull thereof / and or the matter went forward every thing was well
examyned and seen / that no fault should be therein found. Some of the kings
counsel thought it was not reasonable / that these arms should be done so
nere to Calays / for the english men might take it for a presumpcyon / the
which would be eschewed / because of the treuce yt is taken between England
and France / to endure for three year / wherefore they said there ought
nothing to be written nor done / that should be occasyon of any dyscensyon to
be had between the realms. The kings counsel rested on this matter a hole
day / and wyste not what to do / they would faint have broken it. Such as were
sage said it were not good always to consent to the purpose of young people
/ for often times thereby may grow incydentes / rather yuell thanne good. How
be it the king who was young inclyned greatly to these knights / and said.
Let them do their enterprise / they are young and coragyous / they have
promised and sworn to do it before the ladies of Mountpellyer / we will that
the matter go forward / let them purse we their enterprise. When every man
saw that it was the kings pleasure / there were none durst say against it /
wherefore the knights were right joyful. And so it was concluded and agreed
that the matter should go forward as the knights had written and sealed. than
the king sent for the three knights into his chamber aparte / and said to
them. Syrs / in all your doing regard wisely the honor of us and of our
realm / and to maintain your astate spare nothing / for we shall not fail
you for the expense of ten thousand frankes. The three knights kneled down
before the king and thanked his grace.

THus the french king took his sport in the good town of Mountpellyer a
fyftene days / most part with ladies and damsels. And the king and his
counsel had parfytely regarded the business and necessyties of the town /
for princypally he was come thither for the same cause. and by the advise of his
counsel every thing was well reformed and brouggt to good astate / and
their oppressyons do one away / whereby the good people had been sore
traueyled. Than the king took his leave of the ladies and damoselles / and in
a morning he departed and went to dinner to Al^pyam / and at night lay at
Vbere / the next day to Besyers / where he was goodly received / for the good
men of the town greatly desired to se him / and so did all the countries /
both of Pesenas / of Cabestan / and of Narbone / for they were ready to make
complayntes to the king of the duke of Berreys offycer called Betisache / who
had pylled the countries. This Betysach fro that time the king came fro
Auignon / he rode always in his company / but no man showed him as they
thought / for they might have given him warning if they had list / but they
drove him forth with fair words / and suthe promised him nothing but
honor / as thought the contrary. The king entered into Besyers between three
and four at after noone / he was met with processyon without ye town with all
the clergy and burgesses / and ladies and damoselles. as the king came riding
they were a both sides of the way / and did their reverence. So he came to
the cathedral church and there alyghted at the door / where there was an
auter made / rychely garnysshed with iewelles and relykes. There the king
kneled down and did his prayers / and than entered in to the church with the
bishop of Besyers / and his uncle the duke of Burbone and other lords
followed after. Thanne the king went to his lodging to the Palyce / which
was not far thence / and his brother the duke of Thourayne and the duke of
Burbone with him / and the other lords were lodged abroad in the town / where
as they were well and easily lodged / for Besyers is a good city.

Of the complayntes made to the king by the people of Languedoc in the town of
Besyers / against Betysach treasourer to the duke of Berrey of the great
extorsyons that he had made / and of the confession that he made / and of the
cruel death that he had in the said town. Cap. C.lxiii.
Three days the king was at Besyets in great joy and revel among ladies
and damsels / and all that time Betysache was nothing spoken unto / but the
enquisirours who we^ ordained by the king / did secretly inquire of his deeds
/ and they found by enquest diverse cases horrible / not to be pardoned. The
fourth day that the king had been there / this Betysache was called before the
kings counsel in a chamber / and there straytely examyned / and it was said
to him. Betysache / answer wisely to these writings that ye se here. There
was showed him a great nombre of bylles of complayntes that were put up to the
king against him / making mensyon of the errorcyons that he had done to the
people. All these bylles of complayntes were read before him one after
another. To some he answered wisely / making his excuse / and to some he
plainly denied them and said. I know nothing of those matters / lay them to
the seneschalles of Beaucayr and of Carcassone / and to the chancellor of
Berry / it partayneth to them to answer to those matters. How be it finally
it was showed him that he must keep prysone for a time / till the matter were
better examyned. He obeyed because he might not choose. As soon as he was in
prison the inquysitours went to his lodging / and took into their hands all
such writings and acomptes as they found there / which partayned to such
matters as he had intermedled with all before / and they auewed them at leisure
/ and found in them the rekenynges of great so^mes of money / such as had been raised and leuyed of the people. Than he was demanded where all that money
was become and whether the sommes were true or not / he answered and said /
as for the so^mes are true / and the money delivered to the duke of Berrey /
and so paste through his hands and his treasourers / whereof I have good
quyttaunces in my lodging in such a place / the which quitau^ces were sent
for before the counsel and there they were read / and they agreed with the
so^mes of his receyte. Than the counsel and the enquysytours were apeased /
and Betysache sent again to a curtesse prysone. Than the counsel co^muned
together on that matter / and said. It seems that Betysache is clear of such
causes as are laid to his charge / for the money that has been raised / the
duke of Berrey has had it / how so ever it has been spente.

ALl things consydred / Betysache excusacyons were lawful / for the duke of
Berrey was the most couetouse man in all the world / so he might get good
he cared not where nor how he had it / and when he had it he would bestow
it but symply / as many lords do and have done in times paste. Thus the
kings counsel saw no fault in Betysache / whereby he should lose his life.
some were of that opinion and some contrary / and said. Betysach has done so
many cruel deeds / and has so sore inpouerysshed the people / for to
acomplysshe the desire of his lord the duke of Berrey / that the blood of the
poor people cries out / and says / how he has deserved death. For he
that is a man borne of these parties / and counsayler with his master / and
seeing the poverty of the people / he ought in good manner to have showed the
troth to the duke his master / and if the duke would not have herd him /
than he should have come to the king / and to his counsel / and have showed
them the poverty of the people / and how the duke of Berrey had daulte with
them / than he had been well excused. So Betysache was sent for again to the
counsel / and straytely examyned where the money that had been gathered was
become / for they found the so^me of thyrty hundred thousand frankes
received. He answered thereto and said. My lords / it were herd for me to tell
where my lord the duke of Berrey has bestowed it. Much he has laid out on
byldynges and reparacyons of castles and houses / also he has bought certain
lands in the countye of Boloygne / and in the Countye of Estampes. Also he
has spente much in byenge of precious stones and iewelles / the which ye
know well he has always been desirous to bye. Also he is well stuffed to
maintain the astate that he has always kept. Also he has given such
gifts and rewards to Thybaulte and Morynot / and to his servants about him
/ in such wise that they be rich men. Well Betysache quod they of the
counsel / and ye have had for your part to your synguler profit a hundred
thousand frankes. My lords quod he that I have had was by the consent of
my lord the Duke of Berrey / for he would that his servants should become
rich. Than the counsel said all with one voice. A Betysach that word is
folysshly spoken / that richesse is not good nor reasonable that is yuell gotten
/ ye shall return again in to prison / and we shall take further advise / on
that ye have said and spoken. ye must abide the pleasure of the king / to
whom we shall show all your excusacions. My lords quod he all shall be as
god will. Than he was again set in prisone / and there remained four days
or he was sent for again.

When these tidings were spredde abroad in the country that Betysach was in
prison / and that inquyre was made of his deeds / and that it was publysshed
that who so ever had any matter to him should come forth. thereby much people
came to Besyers / and put up supplycacions to the king of the cruel deeds of
Betysach. Some complained of him that he had dysheryted them without cause or
reason. And other complained of him that he had by force taken their wives
and daughters. When the kings counsel saw so many great causes laid to
Betysache / they were weary thereof. And beside all these complayntes he was sore
behated with the people. And all this came to him by reason to fill the duke of
Berreys purse / he did ever what he would have him to do. The kings counsel
wyste not what to do / for than there was come thither two knights fro the duke
of Berrey / the lord of Nantonelet and sir Peter Mespyn / who had brought
letters to the king fro the duke / and they in the dukes behalf auowed all
that ever Betysach had done before / and the duke required the king and his
counsel to have again his man and treasourer. The king had great hatred to
Betysach / because of the yuell name and fame that ran upon him. The king
and the duke of Thourayne his brother inclyned greatly to have had him hanged /
saying how he had well deserved it. But the kings counsel durst not
judge him for dought of the duke of Berrey. They said to the king / sir if
the duke of Berrey auowe all his deeds what so ever they be / we can not se
by no way of reason that he has deserved death / for the seasone that he
meddled in these countries by cessynge of tails / subsydyes / and aids / and
receyuynge of them / he did it at the instau^ce of the duke of Berrey who had
at that time there puyssaunce royal / as well as ye have now. but sir /
acordynge to the deserts of his deeds / ye may sease in to your hands all
his mouables and herytages / and leave him in the same case as the duke of
Berrey found him first / and with his goods make restytucion to such poor
men as be un done by him. What should I make long process / Betysache was at
the point of his delyueraunce with the loss of his goods / till at the last
other tidings came in place. I shall show you what.

I Knew not nor I could not know but by knowledgyng of him self / if he
were in deed so yuell as he judged himself / he said he was an herytyke and
had done many horrible deeds. As it was showed me there came some to him on a
night being in prisone to put him in fear / whether they were his friends or
fooes I know not / they said. Betysach thou art in a hard case / the french
king / his brother / and the duke of Burbone does hate you mortally / there be
so many complayntes put up against you fro diverse place / of such oppressyons
as ye have done when ye had rule in Languedoc / so that they all judge you to
be hanged / for ye can not escape with the loss of your goods / the which
has been offered to the king. But the king who hates you mortally / has
answered how that all your goods are his / and your body also / the which
he says he will not keep long. I show you this for good will / for to morrow
it is thought ye shall be delivered to be judged to dye. Those words greatly
afraid Betysach / and said to them. Ah saint Mary is there no remedy. yes quod
they / to morrow say how ye would speak with the kings counsel / and than
outher they will come to you or send for you to them / and when ye be in their
presence / than say thus. My lords I knowledge my self I have greatly
displeased god / and for the displeasure he has to me / this false slander is
raised on me. Than they will demand of you wherein. Than ye shall answer /
how ye have a long season arred in your faith / and that ye be an herytyke /
and keep still that opinyon. When the bishop of Besyers shall here that / he
will than challenge to have you in his keeping / than ye shall be delivered to
him / for such causes ought to be declared by the law of the church / thanne
ye shall be sent to Auignon / there will be none against the duke of Berrey /
the pope will not displease him / and by this means ye may be delivered / and
another lose body nor goods. But if ye bide still in the case that ye be in /
ye shall not skape paste to morrow / but that ye shall be hanged / for the
king hates you because of the slander of the people. Betysache who trusted
on that false infourmacyon / for he that is in parell of death knows not well
what to do / wherefore he answered and said. ye be my friend and counsel me
truly / where of god thank you / and I trust the time shall come that I shall
thank you. The next morning he called the gayler and said. Friend I require
you cause such men and such to come to speak with me / and named such as
were the enquysitours over him. The gayler showed them how Betysache would
speak with them. They came to him and demanded what he would. He answered and
said. Sirs / I have serched my conscience / I knowledge my self I have hyghly
displeased god / for long time I have arred against ye faith / I never believed
of the Trinyte / nor that the son of god would come so low / as to come fro
Heaven to come in to this world to take humayn kind of a woman. for I believe
and say / that when we dye there is nothing of the soul. Ah saint Mary quod
they / Betysach ye are greatly against holy church / your words demands
for a fire / advise you better. I can not tell quod Betysache whether my
words demau^deth fire or water / but I have holden this opinyon sithe I have
had knowledge / and shall hold it till I dye. The enquysitours would here no
more of him at that time / and were glad to find such a matter against him /
thereby to put him to death. Than they commanded the gailer to keep him
straytely / and to suffer no man to speak with him / to the entente that he
should not be turned fro that opinion. Thanne they went to the kings
counsel and showed them all the matter / than they went to the king and
showed him all the manner of Betysache (as ye have herd) whereof the king had
great marueyle and said. We will that he be put to death / it is an yuell man /
he is a false herytyke and a thief / we will he be brynte and hanged / than he
shall have as he has deserved / he shall not be e^cused for all mine uncle of
Berrey. Anon these tidings were spredde abroad in the city of Besyers / how
Betysache had of his own voluntary will without any constraynt confessed
how he was an herytyke / and had used long the sin of bowgery / and how
the king had said how he should be brynte and hanged / whereof much people
were right ioyouse / for he was sore hated. the two knights that were come
thither fro the duke of Berrey were greatly abashed and wist not what to
suppose. Than sir Peter Mesquyn said to the lord of Nantonelet. Sir / I fear
me Betysache is betrayed / peradventure some person has been with him secretly
in the prisone / and has borne him in hand that if he hold that horrible
error / that the church than shall challenge him / and so be sent to Auignon
to the pope / and thereby be delivered. Ah fool that he is / he is dysceyued /
for the king says he will have him both burnt and hanged. Let us go to
the prisone to him and reform him / and bring him to a another state / for he
is far out of the way and yuell counsayled. They went strayte to the
prisone / and desired the gayler that they might speak with Betysache. The
gayler excused himself and said. Syrs ye must pardone me / for I am
straytely charged to suffer no man to speak with him / and also here be four
sargeauntes of arms sent by the king to keep him / and we dare not break the
kings commandment. Than the two knights saw well how they labored in
vain / and how there was no remedy by all lykelyhode / but that Betysache
should dye. than they returned to their lodging and rekened and paid / and
took their horses and returned to their lord the duke of Berrey and showed him
all the case.

THe conclusion of Betysach was such that the next day (...) ten of the
clock he was taken out of prysone / and brought to the bysshoppes palace / and
there were ready the judges and officers spyrituall / and the bailey of Besyers
brought forth the prisoner / and said. Behold syrs here is Betisache whom I
deliver to you for an herytyke and a synnet in bo^gery / and if he had not ben
a clerk he had been judged or this acordynge to his deserts. Than the
offycyall demanded of Betysach if it were with him acordynge as he was acused
/ and to confess the frouth there openly before all the people. And Betysache
who thought to have said well / and to have escaped by reason of his confession
/ he answered and said that all was true. He was demanded this three times /
and at every time he confessed it to be true before all the people. Thus ye
may know whether he was dysceyued or not / for i^ he had made no such
confession he had been delivered / for the duke of Berrey had fully auowed all
his deeds / the which he had done at his commandment in the country of
Langue doc. But it was to be supposed that fortune played her turn with him /
for when he thought to have been most assuredest on the heyght of fortunes
whele / he was turned up so down fro her whele / as she has done a hundred
thousand mo sithe the world began. Than Betysach was delivered again by the
spirytuall judge to the bailey of Besyers / who under the king ruled the
temperalte / the which Betysache without delay was brought to a place before
the palace. He was so hasted forward / that he had no leisure to answer nor
to say nay / For when he saw a fire ready prepared in ye place / and saw that
he was in the hands of the hangman / he was sore abashed / and saw well than
that he was dysceyued and betrayed. Than he cried out a loud / requirynge to
be herd. but than was no head taken to his saying / but the hangeman said.
It is ordained that ye shall dye / for your yuell warkes has brought you to
an yuell end. He was hasted forward to his death / and the fire made ready /
there was also raised a pair of galowes / and thereto tied a chain of iron /
and at the end thereof a coler of iron / the which was put about his neck /
and than the chain drawn up a hye and tied round about the galowes. Than he
cried and said. Duke of Berrey they cause me to dye without reason / they do
me wrong. As soon as he was tied to the galows / there was setre round about
dry segge / read / and ^ago^^es / and fire put thereto / and incontynente the
faggortes were a fire. Thus Betysache was hanged and burnt / and the french
king out of his chaumbre might well se him if he would. To this poor end came
Betysache / and so the people were revenged of him. And for to say the truth
he had done many extorcions and domages to the people / while he had the
gouernynge of the country of Languedoc.

How the french king being at Toulouse sent for the earl of Foiz who came
thither and did homage to the king for the conntie of Foiz. Cap. C.lxiiii.
AFter this cruel justice the french king tarried not long after at Besiers /
but departed and took the way to Carcassone. and always sithe his departure fro
Auygnon / his marshall sir Loys of Xancere rode in his company. The king rode
so long by his iourneys that he vysited the countries and kept not the right
high ways. He was at Cabestan / at Narbone / at Lymons / at Mount Royal /
and at Fongaur / and than he returned to Carcassone / and there tarried four
days. Than he rode and passed Vile Franca / Auygnollet / and Mongistarte / and
so came to Toulouse / and the burgesses there who greatly desired to se the
king / received him joyfully / and met the king without the town / all in a
lyuery / and so with great solempnyte he was brought to the castle of
Thoulouse. They of the city gave the king many fair presents wherewith the
king was greatly reioysed. When the king had been there three days / than he
was counsayled to send for the earl of Foiz / who was come out of Byerne in to
the county of Foiz / and was in the town of Nasiers / four leages fro
Thoulouse / for he knew of the kings state and ordinance. The marshall of
France and the lord de la River were appointed to go for the earl of Foize.
They departed on a wednysday / and lay at a city in Tholousyn called Iordayn
/ and the next day they came to Nasyers. The earl of Foiz who knew well of
their coming received them nobly for the love of the King / and also he
knew the lords well / he had seen them before Sir Loys of Xancere had the
words / and said. Sir my lord of Foiz / the king our soueraygne lord has
sent us to you / co^maundyng you to come to se him at Thoulouse / or else he
will traueyle so far that he will come and se you in your own country / for
he greatly desires to se you. The earl of Foyze answered and said. Sir Loys I
would not the king had so great traueyle to me / it is more mete I have it for
him / wherefore if it please you ye shall show him that I shall be at Toulouse
within four days. That is well said sir quod they / we shall return and
show him these tidings fro you. So be it quod he / how be it ye shall abide
here all this day and refresshe your selfs / and to morrow ye shall depart /
they obeyed and tarried that day and the night at their pleasure / and the earl
devised with them sagely and craftily / for he was a man by reason of his
fair langage / to draw out by one means or other the secrets of ons heart.
The next day they took leave each of other / and rode so long that the same
day they came to Toulouse / and found the king playenge at chesse with his
uncle the duke of Burbone. Than the king demanded of them alowde and said.
Syrs how say you / will the earl come or no. yes sir quod the lord de la
River / he has great affection to se your grace / he will be here with you
within these four days. Well quod the king and we will gladly se him. The
two knights departed fro the king / and left him playeng and went to their
supper and to rest them / for they had rydden that day a great journey. The
earl of Foiz who was at Nasyers / remembered well the voyage that he had to do.
He made him ready and sent before to Tholous for his prouisyon acordingly. He
had sent in to Bierne for knights and squiers / for mo than two hundred to
serve and to accompany him that voyage.

THe day that the earl of Foiz had appointed he entered in to the City of
Tholous / with mo than six hundred horses / and well acompanyed with knights
and squyers. There was with him Bo^nuquell and sir Ioha^ his brother / sir
Roger of Spaygne his cosyn / the lord of Courase / ye lord of Vale^tyne / the
lord of quare / the lord of Burnge / sir Espaygne du Lion / the lord of
Roquepayre / the lord of Lane / the lord of Besache / the lord of Perle /
sir Peter of Cabestayne / sir Monaunt of Nonnalles / sir Richard de la Meet /
sir Arnolde of saint Basyll / and diverse other. Sir Peter of Byerne and sir
Arnolde his two brethren / and his two bastard sons / sir Iobbayne and sir
Gracyen of Foiz. The entencion of the earl was to enherite those two his sons
/ in to the most part of all the land of Bierne. Of the which land he
might do therewith at his pleasure / for he held it fra^ke and free / holding
of no man but of Godde. Thus the earl took his lodging at the Freers
preachers. There he kept his house / and his men lay as nere there about as
might be The burgesses of Tholous made him great chere for they loved him well
/ for always he had been their good neighbor / curtesse and tretable: For he
never suffered any of his company to do them any displeasure nor vyole^ce
wherefore they loved him much the better. They gave him many fair p^sentes of
wine and other things / so that he was well content. He entered in to Tholous
when it was nere night. The next day about ten of the clock he took his
horse / and such other of his company as pleased him / mo than two hundred
knights and squyers men of honor. And in that estate he rode a long through
the streets / to the Castle where the king was. Than he a lyghted in the
first court entryng in to the castle. Than the earl mounted up the greces in
to the great hall. The french king was come out of his chamber in to the hall
/ and there tarried for the Earl / and had great desire to se him / for his
great valor and renome that ran on him. Therle of Foiz who was a goodly prince
and of a formal stature bear heeded entered in to the hall. And when he saw
the king and other lords of France / the kings brother and his uncle / he
made his reverence to the king and to none other / and kneled down on his one
knee. than he a rose and passed forth / and at the third time he kneled nere
to the king. The king took him by the hand and enbrased him and took him up
and said. Earl of Foiz my fair cosyn ye be right welcome / your coming
greatly rejoices us. Sir quod the earl I thank your grace that it please you
to say so. There the king and the Earl talked toguyder / the which words I
herd not all. Than^e the king went to dinner. At the kings table at the upper
end sat the archbisshop of Tholous / than the king and his uncle the duke of
Burbone / than next the earl of Foiz / than sir John^ of Burbone earl of
March and of Vandone. At that table sat no mo. At the second table satte sir
Johan de la Brethe earl of Harcourte / sir Philyppe of Bare / and four
knights of the earl of Foiz. And at another table there sat the marshall sir
Loyes of sanxere / sir Roger of Spain / and eight other knights of the earls.
This was a great dinner and well stuffed of all things / and after dinner and
grace said / they took other pastymes in a great chamber / and heryng of
instruments / wherein the earl of Foiz greatly delyted. Than^e wine and spyces
was brought. The earl of Harecourt served the king of his spyce plate. And sir
Gerrarde de la pyerserued the duke of Burbone. And sir Monnaunt of Nonnalles
served the earl of Foiz. Thus about four of the clock the earl took leave of
the king and of the other lords. He issued out of the hall / and in the court
were his hourses ready / and his men. The earl mounted / and all such as
accompanied him / and so returned to his lodging / and was well content with
the chere that had been made to him and his / and praised it much to his
knights.

TThus between the French King and the Earl Gascoyne of Foize being at
Tholous / There was diverse treaties and apoyntmentes of love / and the marshall
of France and the lord de la River / did their pain to help it forward.
The earl of Foiz made a dinner to the duke of thou rain and to the duke of
Burbone / to therle de la March / and to other great Lords of France. This
dinner was great and sumptuous / and syttyng at the tables mo than.ii. hundred
knights. And or the dinner was fullye ended / the French king who had dyned in
the castle / and with him sir Charles de la Brethe and sir Philyppe of Bare /
and his two cosyn germayns. Than the king said. Go we thither: and so he did
but with.xii. in his company. The earl of Foiz was greatly reioysed / in that
it pleased the king to come to his lodgyng / and so was all the company. There
was sport after dinner of wrestlyng and casting the bar / the stone and the
darte / between the French men and the Gascoyns Thus they passed the time till
it was nerehande night. Than the king and the other lords returned. The earl
of Foiz gave the same day to the kings knights and squyers / and to ye duke
of Thourayne and to the duke of Burbone / mo tha^ threscore coursers palfrayes
and mulettes / all with white sadels ready dressed to apoynt. Also he gave to the
kings mynstrelles and other / two hundred crowns of gold. And to the
heraudes and officers of arms other two hundred crowns / so that every man
praised the larges of the earl of Foiz. The fourth day after the earl came to
the kings palais / well acompanyed with lords and knights of Byerne and of
Foiz / to se the king and to do as he was required / that is to say / to do
his homage for the county of Foiz / with the appendauntes / reseruyng the
land of Bierne. Before that secretly there had been great treaties between
the king and the earl of Foiz / by means of the lord de la River and sir
Johan Mercier / and the bishop of Noyon / who was newly come thither fro
Auygnon. It was said / that the earl desired of ye king that his son Iobbayne
of Foiz / might after the earls discease / enheryte the county of Foiz. By
that the earl when soever he dyed / should leave to the king a hundred
thousand frankes in money. And sir Gasyon his brother to have the land of Air
in Bierne with the City / and the Mount of Marcen / and all other lands that
the Earl of Foiz had bought in Bierne / should return to the herytau^ce of
the vycount of Castyllon. These assygnementes were in debate and in dyfference
between the earl and the barons / and knights of his country. Some said /
he could not do thus with a general consent of all Byerne and Foize. And
because that the mean homage of the county of Foize was dew to the French
king / therefore the king said to the Earl and to the barons of Foiz. Sirs / I
hold in my hands the homage of the land of Foiz. and if it be so in our
days that the land of Foiz be vacant by the death of our cosyn the earl of
Foiz / than we shall so determyne and apoynt by the advice of good counsel /
that Iobbayns of Foiz and all other men of the cou^tie of Foiz shall hold the^
content. Those words well contented therle of Foiz / and the other lords and
knights of Foiz that were there present. These ordynaunces written and sealed
/ the earl took his leave of the king and of all other great lords / but that
day he dyned with the king and than went to his lodgyng. The next day he
departed fro Tholous and left his furriers behind him / to pay for every
thing. The earl passed the river of Gyronde by ye bridge of Tholous / and
returned in to his country by the mount of Marsen / and so to Ortayes. Than
he gave leave to every man to depart / saving his ordynarye. It was showed me
and I believe it well / that the coming of the french king in to La^guedocke
/ in to Tholous / and in to those marchesse / cost the earl of Foize more than
threscore thousand frankes. The earl was so lyberall / that whatsoever it cost
him / he paid it wyllyngly.

Of the feate and covenant that was don between the king and the duke of
Thourayn his brother / which of them should sonest come to paris fro
Mon^tpellyer / which is a hundred and fyftie leages a sondre / each of them
but with one knight. Cap. C.lxv.
THe French king being at Tholous / he ordered all his business / and removed
and renewed seneschales and officers / and reformed the country in to good
estate so that every man was well contented. And on a day / the king (present /
his brother / his uncle of Burbone / and the lords of France and Gascoyne /
to thentent to have a perpetual memory) gave to his cosyn germayne sir
Charles de la Brethe / for the augmentacion of his honor / two quarters of
arms of France with flower delyces for a fore ye lords de la Brethe bare
always in their arms / a field of goules plain without any other thing. now
they be quartred with the arms of France / which thing the lord de la
Brethe took for a great gift. which lord made the same day a great dinner /
which cost him more than a thousand frankes / and he gave to heraudes and
mynstrels.ii. hundred frankes. Anon after it was ordained that the king should
depart fro Thoulous to return in to France / every man made him ready and
took leave of the king / the bishop of Tholous / the seneschall and the
burgesses / and lords and damoselles of the town. The king deperted and rode
that night to the new castle of Alroy / and so forward every day / so that
he came to Mou^tpellyer / where he was joyfully received / and there tarried
three days / for the ladies and damsels there pleased him much. Than he had
great defyre to return to Paris to se the queen. on a day as he co^muned in
sport with his brother of Thourayne / he said. Fair brother I would that you
and I were at Paris / and all our estate here still as it is / for I have great
desire to se the queen and your fair suster of Thourayne. than the duke said.
Sir / we can not be there with wysshing / it is a far journey hens. that is
true quod the king / yet I think I might besoone there and I would. ye quod
the duke with help of good horses / for so could I be / but my horse must
bear me. well quod the king lay a wager you and I who shall be there sonest.
I am content quod the duke / for he was ever ready to win money of the king. The
wager was laid bitwene ye king and the duke / that who soever of the^ twain
came sonest to Paris should wyn five thousand fra^kes of other / and to
depart the next day all at one hour / and each of them to take but one knight
or servant with them. there was no man that durst break their wager. ye next
day they departed as it was ordained. The lord of Gara^ciers rode with the
king / and the lord of Viefuyll was with the duke of Thourayn. thus these four
rode night and day like young lusty gala^tes: they changed many horses: thus
they rode in post. ye duke of burbone returned by Puy in Auuergne / and rode
to se his grau^tfather by the way / therle Dolphyn of Auergne / and the
countess and their children / of who^ there were to the no^bre of eight / what
sons what daughters / all brethren and susters to ye duches of Burbone his
wife / but that was by reason of two maryages. Thus the french king and his
brother the duke of Thourayne rode in great have / each of the^ to win the
wager. Consider well the great pain of these two great and rich lords.
youth and liberty of courage made the^ to do that enterprice. their estates
abode behind. The french king made it four days and a half or he came to
Paris / and the duke of Thourayne no more but four days and a quarter of a day
/ they followed each other so nere. ye duke wan the wager / by reason yt the
french king rested himself about.viii. of ye clock at Trois in Cha^payne /
and the duke took a barge in ye river of Seyne / and went a long the river to
Melyn / and there took his horse and rode so till he came to Paris / and so
went to saint Poule to the queen and to his wife / and demanded tidinges of
the king / for he wist not wheder he were come or not. and when he knew yt the
king was not come he was joyful / and said to the queen. Madame / ye shall
shortly here tidings of ye king. He said truth / for the king ca^e soon
after. When the duke of thou rayn herd that the king was come / he went and
met him and said. sir / I have won my wager let me be paid. it is reason quod
the king and so ye shall. there they showed before ye ladies all their journey /
and how yt in four days and a half they were come fro Mountpellier to Paris /
which was a.C.l. leages a sondre. The ladies turned all the matter to sport
and laughing / but they well iuged that they had endured much pain. and iuged
that youth and courage of heart caused the^ to do it. and the duke of thourayn
was truly paid for his wager.

Of the death of pope Vrbayne of Rome called the Antepape / and how pope
Clement wrote to the French king and to his uncles / and to the university:
and of the election of pope Boniface by the cardinals of Rome. Cap. C.lxvi.
ABout the said season dyed at Rhome pope Vrbane the.vi. the romans were sore
displeased with his death / for he was well beloved. he was buried in the
church of saint Peter and after his obsequy done well and reuere^tly. Than the
cardynalles went in to the conclaue to choose a new pope / and so they did /
or that pope Clement knew thereof in Auynon / for it was ten days past or they
knew it. And as soon as pope Clement and his cardynalles knew thereof / they
assembled together at the popes palace / and had great co^munycacion toguyder /
and were in great hope that the business of the church should leave and be
concluded / and to come to a full union / for the error had long endured.
They thought that the cardynals at Rome should not agree so soon to enter in to
conclaue / but rather to submit themself to pope Clement at Auignon. They
sent also word to the french king of ye death of Urban called the antepape /
and desired him (the sooner to come to their purpose) that he would write to his
cosyns the king of Almayne and the king of Hungy / to therle of Virtues and
to the duke of Austrych / who had ever holden with pope vrbane / that they
should now cease / and help to make rest and peace in ye church / and to
show them by his letters / that in our faith there ought to be no varyacion.
for as there is but one god in heuyn / so there ought to be but one god in
earth. The same season ye duke of burgoyne was with the king at Paris / to who^
pope Clement and the cardynals wrote in like manner. than the king showed his
uncle these news / and was right joyful and said. Fair uncle / we have had
great desire to go with great puissau^ce to Rome to distroy thenfidels / but as
now our journey is well shorted / for Vrbane the antepape is deed / as Clement
has written to us / and he thinks that the cardynals will not enter in to
co^claue to choose any new pope / but rather to come to Auignon and to submyt
the^ selfs under pope Clement. and we are desired by him and by the cardynals
at Auignon / for the more surety to write pleasant letters to our cosins ye
king of Almayne and to his brother the king of Hu^gry / and to ye earl Virtues
a to ye duke of Austriche. What counsel will ye give me to do. The duke of
Burgoyne said. Sir / true it is pope Vrbane is deed / but as yet we know
nothing of the state of the cardynals at Rome / nor of the Romans / nor
whether they will keep their old opinyon or not. I fear it will be hard for
them to leave it / for the Romans are masters over the cardynalles. Byforce
they made them to choose the archebysshoppe of Bare / and made him pope / and so
maynteyned him to the end. And so if now by perforce they cause the cardynalles
to enter in to conclaue / and to choose a Pope at their pleasure. Wherefore sir:
ye shall not need to enter so far into the matter / as to desire them that
will do but little for you / as they have showed yet hydervnto. Suffer sir till
ye here other news. And paraduenture it may so be / that the cardynalles at
Rome shall not be all of one accord / and paradue^ture will dissymule with the
Romans / and choose none other pope but Clement. And to apease their furour to
promise them / to cause Clement to come to Rome / which he will do right
gladlye on that condycion. And if the matter go so than shall it be time for you
to write to all ye princes christened / that are of the opinyon contrary to you
/ in the best manner ye can to a void the Scisme / and to bring the church
to an union and peace / as by reason every man ought to do. But as yet ye be
not sure how the matter gothe: it is best ye abide the adventure thereof. It
shall not be long or we here other tidings.

When the duke of Burgoyne had said these words to the king and to his
counsel / there was none that spoke contrary thereto. The king thought his
words were reasonable and said. Fair uncle / we believe it is good reason that
ye say / yese more clerer in the matter tha^ we do / and as for the business
or the Church / we will do nothing therein / but by your counsel and
advise. Thus they cessed of that co^munycacion. Great murmuracyon there was a
monge the clerks of the University of those tydinges / whereby they cessed to
read or to study. And intended to nothing / but to harken and to know how
the Cardynalles of Rome maynteyned them self. Wheder they would elect a new
pope / or else to return to the pope at Auignon. They did cast many doughtes
and argued one with another. They knew well how Clement had written to the
king and to the duke of Thourayne and to the duke of Burgoyne / and to the
kings counsel. In likewise letters were written generally to the vnyuersite
/ yt they should conclude to an universal peace in the church. Thus the
clerks devised among themself / and such as would the advancement of
Clement said. Now it is time that the king and the lords of France write to
the great princes of Christendom: As to the king of Almaygne / the king of
Hungry / the lord of Myllayne / and to the duke of Austryche: and to such
other as are of our opynion / to thentent yt they should return to the same
state. such writing may much aueyle. In three days three times the notable
clerks of the vniuersyte of Paris assembled together / and at last came to
saint Poules to speak with the king and his counsel / to desire him to set to
his hand to oppress the Cysme of the church / and to entende to the
ordinance of pope Clement / who had humbly written to him. But when they ca^e
to saint Poules they were not answered / the king dissymuled the matter with
the^ / so that they were yuell content. Finally the king contented the^ /
saying how shortly they should here other news / and so they did / for the
cardinals of Rome entered in to the co^claue and made a new pope / the
cardynall or Naples a noble and a valyant clerk. He was called Bonyface. When
the French king and his counsel herd thereof they were pensive / for than
they well ymagined how that ye cysme was lykely to endure long. Than the duke
of Burgoyne said to the king. Sir / now regard wheder your writings had
not ben lost or no. It is now fallen as I said. Fair uncle quod the king /
ye say truth. Than^e graces were opyned to all clerks at Rome by Bonyface /
and all promyses certifyed there / of such as were under his obeysau^ce / and
such as would receive such graces went toward Rome. And when they
approached the marchesse of Danconne / they rode in great paryll / For sir
Bernarde de la Salle / who kept the fronters there / and made war to the
Romans in the quarrel of pope Clement / took such clerks as paste by and
did them much trouble / and many slain and lost. Now let us leave
speaking of these popes / and turn to other matters.

Of the yelding up and taking of the strong castle of Vanchadore in Lymosyn /
of old parteyning to sir Geffcay Tete Noyre. Cap. C.lxvii.
YE have herd here before: how sir Geffray Tete Noyre / who had been long
capitayns of the castle of Vanchadore in Lymosyn / reigned valiauntly / and
how he held his fortress against all men / as long as he lived. And in his
life days had pa^esed the country / more than.xxx. my to long about him. also
ye have herd how he dyed / and by what incydence: And how on his death bed
he ordained his.ii. nephues Alayne Roux and Peter Roux to be capitayns of that
castle of Va^chadore after his death. and caused in his presence / all the
companyons of that garrison to swear faith / truth / and homage: service and
true obeysaunce to the said two capitayns. And after ye death of this Geffraye
Tete Noyre / these two brethren reigned there a certain space / and held
always the country in war and in composycion of patesyng. And because that
castle parteyned to the heritage of the duke of Berrey (for he had bought it
of the earl of Mount pensyer / and his son Johan of Berey bare his name
thereby) therefore the duke was sore displeased that it was out of his hands /
but he could not amend it. yet he had laid siege thereto diverse times by
bastides and none otherwise / but they within set little thereby. for they
would issue out and ride abroad in ye country at their pleasure. This Alayne
nor Peter would in no wise obey any peace or truce that was taken between
England and France. They said they were not bound to obey / but would make
war at their pleasure / whereby the countries of Auuergne and Lymosyn were
sore traueyled. And the duke of Berrey to resyst them caused sir Wyllyam Butler
a gentle knight of Auuergne / and sir Johan Boesme Lance and sir Loyes
Da^bier / with diverse other knights and squyers of Auuergne and Lymosyn / to
lay siege by bastydes to the castle of Vanchadore / and lay there at the
cost of the country. There they lay a louge season.

SO it fell the same season / as it was showed me: Alayn and Peter Roux took
their aduyce toguyder and denysed to attrappe and to take by craft sir Wyllyam
Butler and sir Johan Boesme Lance who had done them diverse displeasures.
These two brethren ymagined between the^ and said one to another / How they
would secretly say / how they would yield up their fortress for a certain
so^me of floreyns: And to say how they are weary and will keep the garrison no
lengar / but to return in to their own countries. To the which deuyse they
said surely the duke of Berrey will gladly lean unto. Also they devised to
demand no more but ten thousand fra^kes / because that sum might soon
be made And also they said they would have again their money and the two
knights also prisoners / by reason of a busshment that they would lay in a
great tower. Behold now what a folisshe ymaginacion these two Bretons were of
to betray these two knights / and to have their money / if any iuell came to
them thereby it ought not to be co^playned. Upon this determynacion they put
out of the castle one of their varlettes / and said to him. Go thy way to
the French bastydes and suffer them to take the. Tha^ require to be brought to
sir Wyllyam Butler and to sir Johan Boesme Lance. Than deliver them this
letter fro us and demand for an answer / for the matter touches us and them
also greatly. The varlet said it should be done / for he thought none yuell /
and so went to the French bastides. And when he came nere to the bastydes he
was demanded what he would / he answered and said he would gladly speak with
sir Wyllyam Butler or with sir Johan Boesme Lau^ce. He was brought to them /
for as than they were toguyder. When he saw them he made his reverence and
drew them aparte / and delivered to them the letter that Alayne and Peter Roux
had sent them. Of that tydinges they had great marueyle / and so took the
letter and reed it / and therein they found / how that Alayne and Peter Roux
would speak with them for their profit. When they herd that they had more
marueyle than^e they had before / and douted of trayson. How be it they sent
them word that if they would come out of the castle / and speak with them
without / they would assure them to enter again in to their fortress without
danger or trouble. This was the answer yt the varlet brought to their
master. Thanne Alayne and Peter roux said / we think we may be sure enough by
these words / sithe their faythes and seals be at the writing / they are true
knights and also we shall speak with them for a treaty / whereunto we think
they will gladly entende. The next morning they opynned a wycket ioynyng to
the gate / and aueyled down a planche board hangyng by two chains and issued
out and stood on the planche. than sir Wyllyam Butler and sir Johan Boesme
Lau^ce came thither and lyghted of their horses / and made their men to draw
abacke. Than the two capitayns within said. Sirs may we surely come out and
speak with you. ye surely quod the knights. shall we be as sure again of your
part without trayson. ye sir surely quod they without doubt. Than Alayne and
Peter Roux passed the bridge and came to the^ / so they four were toguyder with
out other company. Than the two French knights said. Sirs / how say you.
What co^munycacion will ye have with us? Are ye in mind to yield up your
Castle to us? ye truly sirs quod they on a condycion / and that is to give us
ten thousand fra^kes for ye prouisyons that is in the castle / for we are
weary of ye war / we would draw in to Bretayne. These two knights were right
glad of those words and said. Ah / ye speak to us of marchandyse / and we
shall here you gladly. But as now we have not here the money ready we shall
provide for it. Well sirs quod they of Vanchador when ye are ready give us
knowledge / and we shall keep covenant. But sirs / keep this matter secretly
and sagely / for if it were known among mine own company they would take us
perforce and slay us / than should both you and I fail of our ententes. Sir
quod they dought not thereof / we shall so convey the matter yt ye shall take no
damage. Therewith they departed one fro a another / the bretons entered in to
Vanchador / and the french knights returned to their bastydes.

SIr Willyam Butler and sir Johan Boesme lau^ce / in this matter thought
nothing but good / supposing that the bretons would not dysceyue them / as
to have their money and to betraye them also. in contynente they wrote to the
duke of Berrey / who was as than at Ryon in Auuergne. they sent with the letter
a gentleman named Guyomell of saint Wydall / and infourmed him of all the
matter / thynkyng how it should be ioyouse tidings to the duke / for he
greatly desired to have that castle. This squire took the letter and departed
fro the bastydes / and rode so long through Lymosyn and Auuergne that he came
to Ryon / and there he found the duke of Berrey / and delivered him his
letters fro the two knights. The duke reed the letters / and when he had well
understand the contents thereof the duke was glad / and anon after the duke
called his counsel and his treasourers / and said. Sirs behold here is new
tidings / our knights that keeps the bastydes before Vanchador have written
to us that they are in certain treaty with the capytayns within the castle /
they offer to yield up the fortress for the so^me of ten thousand frankes /
that is no great so^me for every year it cost them of Lymosyn and of Auuergne
to keep war against them / more than threscore thousand frankes. We will
accept their offer betymes lest they repent them herafter / therefore my
treasourers make up the so^me of ten thousand frankes / we will lend them
to the country / and when I am in possession of the castle I will raise a
tail in Lymosyn and in the fronters / which were under their patesynge / they
shall pay me the double. Sir quod the treasourers / it shall be made ready
within these five or six days. Well quod the duke I am content. Thus that
matter was concluded. The tresourers made ready the money in crowns of the
son / and put it in to four cofers. The same day that the money should have
been sent / there came to Ryon to the duke of Berry / the Dolphyn of Auuergne
and the lord of Reueyll / for certain matters touching them self. They were
welcome to the duke / and the Duke was so joyful of the treaty for Vanchador
that he could not keep it secret but showed to these two knights the letters
sent to him fro sir Willyam Butler / and sir Johan Boesme Lance. When they
herd it they studied a little. Than the duke said / sir whereon do yemuse se
you any suspectiousnes in this matter / I pray you show me or I send the
money? Sir quod the earl Dolphyn / ye know well how therle of Army nake and I
were ordained to by and to get again as many fortresses as we could in the
countries of Auuergne / Carnesyn / Rouergne / and Lymosyn. With diverse we made
treatyes / but for all yt ever we could do / we could never bring them of
Vanchador to herkyn or to lean to any manner of treaty / another to give it up
/ nor to selle it. When we spoke thereof they would skante make us an answer.
and sir I know if they now will make this treaty with you it is not for
defaute of vitayles / for if none came to them this eight year yet they have
enough / wherefore we have maruayle what should move them thereto at this
present time / therefore it makes us to doubt of traysone / for men of war
enclosed in fortresses are sore imagyners / and when their imaginacion
inclyneth to any yuell deed / they will craftily color it / wherefore sir take
good advise. Well syrs quod the duke ye have said well / we shall provide for
the matter more substancyally than I thought to have done.

THanne the duke of Berrey called to him one of his knights / called sir Peter
Mespyn / and said to him. Sir ye shall go with this money to the bastydes
before Vanchadore / and say to sir Wyllyam Butler and to sir Johan Boesme
lance / that in the matter they wrote to me of / that they deal therein
substancyally / and that they trust not to much in the bretons within
Vanchador / and show them that we have herd more tydinges than they be ware
of / wherefore let them be well aduysed of all points. Thus this knight
departed fro Ryon with the money / he rode with his company till he came to the
bastydes whyther he was welcome. The summers with the money were dyscharged and
put in sauegarde. Than sir Peter Mespyn opened his message and said. Syrs my
lord the duke of Berrey sends you word by me that as touching the treatye
that ye are in hand withal / touching the garyson of Vanchador he commands
you to work wisely / that ye lose not both your bodies and the money that he
has sent you. also he says he has herd tidings that pleases him nothing
/ wherefore he will ye take good head and be well aduysed / for he douteth of
trayson / he says that often times the country of Auuergne and Lymosyn would
have given for the fortress of Vanchadore threscore thousand frankes / and
now to offer it for ten thousand / causes my lord the duke and his
counsel to have suspecte. The two knights when they herd that they were
pensive / and answered and said. We se well double wit is better than
syngle / ye say well / we thank you of your advise / and ye shall abide here
still with us and help to counsel us as it is reason / within these two
days we shall se how ye matter shall come to pass / he said he was content
so to do. Thanne anon after these two knights sent a varlet to the castle
of Vanchador / for it was as than treuce between the parties / signyfyed to
Alayne Rour and to Peter Rour / that the ten thousand frankes were ready /
and desyringe them to keep their promise. And they answered the varlet / that
they would keep their promise surely / and that when so ever they would come /
to send them word thereof.

ALayne and Peter Rour who thought no good as it was known and proved / when
their purpose was broken and known for they had devised to have taken sir
Willyam Butler and sir Johan Boesme lance / as they should have entered in to
the castle of Vanchador by reasone of a great tower that was within the
castle / the which was always able to beat the castle. These two knights
bretons who intended nothing but malesse / laid in busshement in this tower
thyrty men in harness / to the intent that when the french men were entered in
to the castle / thinking to be lords thereof / that in the night these thyrty
should issue out / and slay and take the french men at their pleasure. When
they had thus ordained / than they sent to sir Willyam Butler and to sir Johan
Boesme lance / that they should come and bring with them their money / and
they should have the castle opened. Of these news the french men were joyous
/ and said to the messanger. Return to your masters and show them that to
morrow in the morning we shall come thither. The messanger returned and showed
this to his masters. The french knights went to counsel together and did
cast more doutes than they did before / by reason of the words that the duke
of Berrey had sent them by six Peter Mespyn. Than they ordained and concluded
to lay a busshemente of their men nere to the castle / and than they with
thyrty of their men harnessed under covert should go before and enter into the
castle / and to regard wyselye the castle within / and to cast all manner of
doutes / and than if they se any thing to suspecte / than one of them to blow
a horn / and to keep the bridge and gate open / and at the sown of the horn
the busshement to come to the gate as fast as they can / and to enter and
take season of the castle. Thus as it was ordained so it was done. The next
morning every man was ready / and the busshement laid of a six score spears /
and the two knights with thyrty in their company covertly armed came to
Vanchador / and sir Peter Mespyn was with them / with the money trussed
properly in three panyers upon two summers. they found the two bretons ready at
the barryers / who opened the barryers against their coming. When they were
entered and within the gate / than the two bretons would have closed the gate
after them / but the french knights said. Nay syrs not so / be ye true
merchants or not / ye know well ye must yield up to us this castle for the
payeng of the so^me of ten thousand frankes / the which is here ready. ye
may se them here upon this somer / if ye keep troth with us so shall we do
with yon. With those words Alayne and Peter Rour wyste not what to say / but
to bring the french men out of suspecte they answered. Syrs ye say well /
we are content as ye please. Thus they went forth and left the barryers
open / for if it had been closed the busshment could not have entered to have
come time enough to have resysted the false turn that the bretons had devised.
For ymagyners should have every thing as they list / and if there were not
counter ymaginers against the^. Both the french men and bretons entered in at
the gate / than Alayne and Peter Roux would have closed the gate / but than the
french men said. Syrs let the gate alone / we will have it open / it is reason
/ we are ready to deliver you our money acordynge to our promise. Well syrs
quod the bretons / let se lay forth the money. With a good will quod the
french men. There they laid forth a couerlet / and the florens laid abroad.
In ye mean season while Alayne and Peter Roux beheld the fair so^me of
florence / the french knights went about to se the manner of the castle.
Thanne sir Peter Mespyn came / to sir Willyam Butler and said. sir cause this
great tower to be opened / or ye pay all your money / for there may be within
it a busshmente / whereby we may be atrapped and lose both our bodies and the
money also. Than sir Willyam said to Alayne. Sir / open this tower / we will se
it open or we deliver our money. Sir quod Alayne I can not do so / the keys
be lost. With those words the french knights had more suspecte in the matter
than they had before / and said. Alayne it can not be that ye should lose the
keys of the soueraygne tower of this castle / open it with fayrenesse / or
else we shall open it perforce / forye have promised and sworn to render to us
the castle as it is without fraud or male engyn / and therefore you to have
ten thousand frankes / the which so^me is here ready to be delivered. than
Alayne answered again and said / I will not open it till I have received ye
money / and laid it in sauegarde. than when I have received the money I shall
search for ye keys. Sirs quod they / we will not abide so long / we se clearly
by your words that your meaning is not good / for you will dysceyue and
betraye us / wherefore we lay our hands on you / Alayne and on your brother
Peter / in the name of the king our soueraygne lord and the duke of Berrey /
we will have this tower incontinent opened perforce / and search every place
within this castle both above and beneth / to se if ye have laid any
busshemente or not / and if we find in the castle any thing done by you /
that ought not to be done / ye are lost without redempcyon or pardone / for
reasone will so / and if we find the castle as it ought to be we shall keep
our bargayne with you well and truly / and shall conducte you whyder ye list
/ to the gates of Auignon if ye will. when Alayne and Peter Roux saw how the
matter went / and that they were arested they were sore abashed / and were as
half deed / and repented them that they had done so much / for they saw
well they were dysceyued. Than the french knights perceived well how they
were culpable / and that the matter was not well. than they made a sign to him
that bare the horn to blow / and so he did. When the french busshement herd
it / they came to ye castle as fast as their horses could ryn and said. Go
we to Vanchadore they blow for us / it seems our men has not found the
castle acording as it was promised / we think there be some trayson / anon
they were come to the castle / for they were not far of / the barryers were
open and kept by the frenchmen / for the bretons within were not masters of
the castle / for their busshemente were within the tower. The French men
entered and found the capytaynes in the court comunynge with the bretons.

THan Alayne and Peter were sore abashed / seeing so many of their enemies
about them. And as for them that were within the tower knew nothing of the
business / nor could se nor here nothing the tower was so thycke. some that
were with in said. Hark syrs me think I here much murmuring without / we
may be dysceyued french men be subtyle / we thought to take / but I fear we
be taken / our capitayn Alayne is dysceyued and we to / I fear we shall not
issue out without their congye. Thus when the french men saw how they were
lords of the castle / they were than bolder than before / and took and put
up again their floreyns / and said to Alayne. deliver us the keys of this
tower / for we will se what is within. The bretons prolonged the matter and
said. Syrs begin first to search in outher places and tha^ return to this
tower. The frenchmen answered. Alayne / ye do but prolo^ge the matter / for we
will begin here first. and other at ones deliver the keys or else thou shalt
be slain with these daggers. when the two brethren herd that they douted the
death / they fled fro it as long as they might / how be it to say the
troth it had been more honorable for them to have been slain there than to
have tarried any longer / for afterward they dyed a shameful death / as ye
shall here. And Alayne Roux being in this danger yet practysed another craft
if it would have served / and said. Sir Willyam and you sir Johan / it is of
troth that within this toure are thirty men in harness / my brother and I did
set them there with much pain / for we knew well they would never agree to
our apoyntemente / therefore we have closed them within this tower to be sure
of them / till ye have the full possessyon of the castle and there ye may have
them and ye will / they are all good prisoners / and deliver us our money as ye
have promised / and let us go our ways. When the french knights herd that
they were somewhat better content than they were before and studied a little /
than sir Willm^ Butler said / how so ever it be / or we deliver our money we
will have knowledge of all the keys of this castle / therefore show us where
they be. When Alayne saw it would be none otherwise / he sent for them in to
his chamber. When they were brought to the place than it was demanded which
keys served for ye tower. Alayne full sore against his will showed forth the
keys of the great tower. Than they opened the tower / and found within the
thyrty companions in harness hid privily within the tower. Alayne and his
brother were sore abashed when they saw the frenchmen enter into the tower /
and hard the words that sir Willyam Butler said / which were these. Syrs /
issue out fair and easily one by one / if not ye are all but deed / we take
you as prisoners / fear not the death ye shall have no hurt / so ye will
show the troth of that we shall demand of you. When they saw the french
men and understood that they should not be slain but taken as prisoners / they
laid down their weapons and harness / and yielded them selfs / for they saw
well defense could not aueyle them. There the thyrty men were taken and put a
part and examyned / and there they iustyfyed the trayson before Alayne and
Peter Roux / who could not deny it. Than the knights of France said to
them. Syrs / it greatly dyspleaseth us to find you in this defaulte / we can
not punysshe the matter the cause is so weighty / we shall put it to the
discrecyon of the duke of Berrey / if he will have pytie on you we shall be
glad thereof / we trust he will for the joy that he will have for the
recoueryng of this castle / for it was the place that he most desired to have
again of all the world. These words somewhat comforted them. They were put
in to a chamber under sure keeping / and other in to diverse chambres and
towers. Than the castle was serched above and beneth / there they found great
prouysyon / and left it all there still and took away nothing thereof at their
departing / and as for gold / silver / and harness / thereof was made a boty
and every man had his part / and the prisoners the knights had them for their
part.

THus as I have showed / the strong castle of Vanchadore was taken by the
french men in this season. And than sir Wyllyam Butler set there a capytayne
a squire of Lymosyn a valiant man / called Pier Mardych / and with him a
thyrty spears of good men of war / and they raunsomed their prisoners such
as were worthy to be raunsomed / and such as were great pyllers and robbers /
and frenchmen borne / they struck of their hedes / and hanged them upon
gybettes / new made before the castle gate. Than the french knights
departed to go to Ryon to the duke of Berrey / and took with them Alayne and
Peter Roux. Tydinges sprange abroad how the strong castle of Vanchadore was
taken / whereof the country of Auuergne and Lymosyn and those marchesse were
greatly reioysed / for the castle had been out of the french men's hands
more than fyftene year / and during that season that garysone had done great
damage to the country. Sir Willyam Butler found in the castle a young squier
of Bretayne / a fair young man named Monadich / and was cosyn to Geffray
Tetenoyre / and he was but newely come thither to learn to exercise deeds of
arms. He had been brought up in an abbaye in Bretayne / and was come out of the
house because he would be no monk. The french men would have stryken of his
heed among other / but sir Willm^ Butler had pytie on him and saved his life /
with that he would become french and serve him. Thus the frenchmen rode to the
duke of Berrey / and brake up their bastydes. The men of arms departed and
went every man to their own / and ye capytaynes came to Ryon to the duke of
Berrey / and led with them the bretons / who desired the^ on the way yt they
should not enfourme the duke of Berrey to sore against them. the frenchmen
promised to fulfill their desire. So long they rode that they came to Ryon /
and there found the duke and the duchess / who received them with great joy /
for he rekened it to be a great act / the conquering of the castle of
Vanchadore / and gave them fair gifts and presents. Than they demanded of
the duke what his pleasure was should be done with Alayne and Peter Roux. he
answered he would take advise in that matter / and so took counsel / and
there it was determined that he should send them to the king. And so they were
delivered to the seneschall of Auuergne / and he conveyed them to Paris / and
there they were put in prison in the castle of saint Anthony / in the keeping
of the vycount of Affer / who as at that time had the keeping of yt castle.
And they had not ben long there but that they were delivered to the provost of
Paris / and put in to the chatellet and there judged to dye as traitors and
robbers of the realm of France. Than they were delivered to the hangman and
fast bound and laid in a carre and brought with trompettes to the place of
execucion named ye halles / and there set on the pillery and turned four times
about in the sight of all the people / and there was openly red and publysshed
all their deeds / and tha^ beheeded and quartered / and their quarters sent to
the four chief gates of the city. Thus Alayne and Peter Rour lost shamfully
their lives / and the castle of Vanchadore.

Of the deeds of arms at saint Ingylvertes contynuyng thyrty days against
all co^mers of the realm of England and other countries every man three
courses. Ca. C.lxviii.
IN this seasone and in the mean time that the truese was thus bytwenene
England and France / both by land and by see / though the kings and their
subgiettes held well the peace / yet was there certain pyllers and robbers in
Auuergne who made war to the poor men on both sides the river of Dordone /
but the capytayns that had given up their fortresses by reason of that treaty
dyssymuled the matter. By reason of their dissymulacion the country of
Auuergne received great damage / so yt the complaints thereof came to Paris.
Than the french king was counsayled to send to the king of England /
signyfyenge him of the state of these robbes that made war thus in the
country under color of their patesynge / the which ought not to be done. I
think the king of England excused him self of the matter. And to provide
therefore. the same / season the three fore said knights / that is to say the
young Bouciquant / Raynolde of Roy / and the lord of saint Pie / who had
enterprised to do arms about the marches of Calays / nere to saint
Ingilbertes / made them ready to a co^plysshe their desire and to fulfill their
promise and the right of arms / for it was openly declared and publysshed /
and specially in ye realm of England / in the which realm there were
knights and squyers quyckened to the matter / and were in great imagynacio^s to
know what they might best do. Some said it should be greatly to their blame and
reproach / such an enterprise taken so nere to Calays without they passed the sea / and look on those knights that should do arms there. Such as spoke
most of the matter was / first sir Johan of Holande earl of Huntyngdon / who had
great desire to go thither / also sir Johan courtney / sir Johan Traicton / sir
Johan Golouffer / sir Johan Russell / sir Thomas Shyrborne / sir Willyam
Clyfton / sir Willyam Clynton sir Willym^ Taylboys / sir Godfrey Seta / sir
Willyam hacquenay / sir Johan Vobeas sir Johan Dambretycourt / sir Henry
Beamond and diverse other / mo than a hundred knights and squters / all these
said. Let us provide to go to Calays / for the knights of France has not
ordained that sport so nere our marches / but to the intent to se us there /
and surely they have done well / and do like good companions / and we shall not
fail them at their busynes. This matter was so published abroad in England /
that many such as had no desire to do deeds of arms them self / yet they
said they would be there to look on them that should. Such as thought to be
there sent before to Calays to make prouysion to keep their astate / and sent
over their horse and harnes both for peace and war. When the day aproched
sir John^ Hola^de brother to the king of England first passed the sea / and mo
than.lx. knights and squiers with him / and aryued at Calys and there took up
their lodgings.

At thentryng in of ye ioly fresshe moves of May / these three young knights of
France / such as should do deeds of arms at saint Ingilbertes. thus first
they ca^e to Boloyne and tarried there a season / and than came to thabbay of
same Ingilbertes. Than they understood how there were a great no^bre of
knights and squyers come out of England to Calays / whereof they were right
joyful. And to the intent that the brute should come to Calays / they ordained
in a fair plain between Calays and saint Ingilbertes three fressh grene
pauilyo^s to be pyght up / and at the enter of every pauylyon there hanged two
sheldes with the arms of the knights / one shield of peace another of war /
and it was ordained that such as should ryn and do deeds of arms / should
touch one of the sheldes / or cause to be touched / which as pleases them /
and he should be delivered acordyng to his desire. to speak of this matter I
shall show you. The.xxi. day of the month of May acordyng as it had been
publisshed / these three french knights were ready in the place to furnysshe
their interprice. And the same day knights and squyers issued out of Calays
such as would just / and also such other as had pleasure to regard that
sport / and they came to the said place appointed and drew all on ye one
part. The place to just in was far grene and plain. Sir Johan Holande first
sent to touch the sheld of war of sir Boucyquant / who incontinent issued
out of his pauylyon ready mounted with shield and spear. These two knights
drew fro other a certain space / and when each of them had well aduysed other
they spurred their horses and came together rudely / and Boucyquante struck the
earl of Huntyngton through the shield / and the spearcheed glente over his arm
and did him no hurt / and so they passed forth / and turned and rested at
their pase. This course was greatly praised. The second course they met
without any hurt do ynge / and the third course their horses refused and
would not cope. The earl of Huntyngton who had great desire to just and was
somewhat chafed came to his place / abiding that sir Boucyquant should take his
spear / but he did not / for he showed that he would no more tynne that day
against therle. And when the earl saw that / he sent his squire to touch the
shield of war of the lord of saint Pie. And he that would not refuse issued
out of his pauylion / and took his horse / shield / and spear. And when the
earl saw that he was ready spurred his horse / and saint Pie in likewise / they
couched their spears / but at the metyng their horses crossed / but with the
crossynge of their spears the earl was vnhelmed. Than he returned to his men
/ and incontinent he was rehelmed and took his spear / and saint Pie his / and
than ran again / and met each other with their spears in the mids of their
sheldes / so that nere hand they were both borne down to their earth / but
they gryped fast their horses with their legs / and so saved them selfs /
and returned to their places / and took their brethes. Sir Johan Holande who
had great affection to do honorably / took again his spear and spurred his
horse / and when the lord of saint Pie saw him coming he dasshed forth his
horse to encountre him / each of them struck other on their helmes that ye spre
flasshed out. With yt ataynt the lord of saint Pie was vnhelmed / and so they
passed forth and came again to their own places. This course was greatly
praised / and both french and english said that those three knights / the
earl of Huntyngton / sir Bouciquant / and the lord of saint Pie / had right
well done their deuoyrs without any damage either to other. Again the earl
desired for love of his lady to have another course / but he was refused. Than
sir Johan Holand went out of the renke to give place to other / for he had
run all his sire courses well and valyau^tly / so that he had laud and
honor of all parties. Than stepped forth a gentle knight of England called the
earl Marshall / he sent to touch the shield of war of sir Raynolde of Roy /
who issued out of his pauylyon armed at all pieces / and took his horse / shield
/ and spear. And when these two knights were a sonder they spurred their
horses and came fyersly together. The first course they failed by outragyng of
their horses / wherewith they were sore dyspleased. At the.ii. course sir
Raynolde was stryken and the spear broken. the.iii. course each struck other on
their helmes with such force / yt the fire slew out / and therle Marshall was
vnhelmed who passed forth and returned to his place and iusted no more yt day
/ for he had don enough than ca^e forth ye lord Cl^fford / a right apt and a
valya^t knight of England / cosyn germayn to sir John^ Cha^dos / who was a
noble valiant knight in his days / he sent to touch the shield of war of
sir Bouciquant / incontinent the knight issued out of his pauilyon with shield
and spear. These two knights came rudely togider and struck each other on ye
helm that the fire sparcled. Their spears brake not nor the knights lost no
styropes / so passed by and came to their places and made the^ ready to ryn
the.ii. course / and so came together without any sparing. sir Bouciqua^t brake
his spear but he was vnhelmed and yet fell not. they passed forth and came to
their places. Sir Loyes Clifforde made him to just again but Bouciquant did
not put on again his helm / yt seeing / the lord Clifforde aduysed to
perform his course with another. Than he sent his squire to touch ye held
of war of ye lord of saint Pie / who came forth ready to just. They ran
toguyder and met each other / ye lord Clifforde brake his spear in three pieces
on ye lord of saint Pyes shield / and the lord of saint Pie struck the lord
Clyfforde on the helm / so that he was dishelmed / and so passed forche / each
of them drew to their place / and the lord Clyfforde ran no more that day /
for it was showed him how he had right honorably borne him self that day.
Than came forth a noble knight of england called sir Henry Beamo^de / he
caused to be touched sir bouciquantes shield of war / who was soon ready to
answer / they ran together. the lord Beamo^de crossed and Bouciquant struck
him so rudely / that he bare him to therche and passed forth. ye knight was
releued by his men and set again on horse back / and ran again together two
other courses without any do^mage. tha^ sir Peter Curency who had great desire
to ryn six courses / caused his squire to touch all three sheldes of war /
whereof ye frenchmen had marvel and demanded what he ente^ded thereby / he
answered / that it was his pleasure to ryn with each knight.ii. courses /
without he were let by the way. his de^yre was granted. Than sir Raynolde du
Royran first. They came togider with good aduyseme^t / howbeit the first course
they failed for their horses refused at ye cope / wherewith they were sore
displeased. they railed not at ye ii. course / but sir Raynold dishelmed the
englisshe knight / and passed forth and returned to his place and held hi^
still for he had ron his two courses. Than ye lord of sair Pie ca^e forth to
just and ran each against other and brake their speres / and the.ii. course the
lord of saint Pie struck sir Peter Courtney a cross / and sir Pet struck him
on ye helm and vnhelmed him / and so ca^e to their own places. than sir
Bouciquat to aco^plisshe sir Peter's desire came forth and ran and met each
other in ye mids of their heldes so rudely yt both their horses stakered in
the place. more hurt there was not.ye.ii. course they vnhelmed each other.
These.vi. courses done / sir Peter Courtney desired to ryn one course more with
one of ye three knights which as pleased the^ / but he was refused / and it was
said to him yt he had done enough for ye day / so he rested. Than preced forth
a ge^tyl man of England called sir John^ Gouloufer / he sent to touch ye
shield of sir Raynolde (...) Roy / who was ready to answer. they ran freely
togider and ataynted each other of the helmes without dishelmyng or brekyng of
their speres / and so passed by. the second course their horses refused to
mete. the.iii. course they met in their sheldes and brake their staves. the
fourth course they mist. the.v. course they vnhelmed each other and returned
to their places. Than a valiant knight of England called sir John^ Rolscau /
who was a well traveled knight and well known / he touched the shield of ye
lord of saint Pie / yt knight was ready to answer. they ran together and met so
rudely yt their horses stayed with ye cope. ye.ii. course their horses swarued
aside and mist each other / whereof the knights were displeased. and the.iii.
course they met and struck each other in ye viser of their helmes / so yt they
were both vnhelmed. The english knight returned to his company and iusted
no more. Than came forth sir Peter Shirborne a young knight and touched ye
sheld of sir Bouciquant / ye knight was ready and ran togider and mist / by
outraging of their horses they tarried not long but ran togider again the.ii.
course / and struck each other in the sight of their helmes / sir Bouciqua^tes
spear brake thenglysshe knights spear held / so yt thereby sir Boucyquant was
vnhelmed so rudely / yt the blood ran out at his nose / and so he returned to
his pausiyon and ran no more that day / for it was nere night / but sir Peter
shirborne would not leave so but would ryn out his.iii. course / he sent to
touch the shield of the lord of saint Pie / who was inco^tynent ready. They
ran togider and tainted each other on ye helmes but their speres grated not /
if they had / by most lykelhod they had taken hurt / the.ii. course they
struck each other on ye sheldes and brake their staves in three pieces / and
the^glisshe knight was borne to therthe / they ran no more yt day / for it was
nere night. Than the englysshmen drew togider and deperted and rode to Calays
/ and there devised that night of that had been done that day. In likewise the
frenchmen rode to saint Ingylbertes and co^muned and devised of yt had been done
ye same day.

The tuesday after mass / all such as should just that day or would give the
lokyng on rode out of Calis and came to the place appointed / and the Frenchmen
were ready there to receive the^. the day was fair and hot. When thenglysshmen
were armed / than sir Wyllm^ Clyfron and expert knight of England / caused his
squier to touch the targe of sir Bouciquant. Incontinent the knight issued out
of his pauylion armed at all pieces. the two knights came toguider and taynted
each other on the shield and passed by without brekyng of their spears.
The.ii. course they crossed on their helmes. the.iii. course they encountered
each other so on ye sheldes yt their horses stood still. the.iiii. course was
well employed they vnhelmed each other. The english knight ran no more / it
was said to him he had done enough. Than on the^glisshe perte came forth a
lusty young knight called sir Nicholas clynton / he touched ye lord of saint
Pies shield / the knight anon was ready. they met togider so even yt each of
the^ brake their speres in iii. pieces / with such force yt the knight / were
in danger to have taken damage / but they passed by and ca^e to their places.
the.ii. course they tainted each other on ye helmes and passed by. ye iii.
course their horses crossed and failed. ye.iiii course ye lord of saint Pie
vnhelmed the english knight / who ran no more yt day / for men said he had
well and valiantly done and quited himself / and how other must have place to
just. Tha^ a kynsman of therle of Hu^tingdon ca^e forth called Wyllm^ Stamert
/ he caused to touch ye shield of ser Raynold of Roy. they ran togider with
frewyll and tainted each other / ye english knight lost his spear. the.ii.
courie they met / but the^glisshe knight warued aside / I can not tell wheder
the faut was in the knight or in ye horse / but sir Raynolde struck him so
rudely on ye targe yt he sore reuersed and so passed by / and made the^ ready to
ryn the third course / and so tainted each other on ye helmes / yt the fire
sprang out and lost both their speres. ye iiii. course they ataynted each other
in ye sight of their helmes / with that course sir Wyllm^ stamert was dishelmed
and nigh borne to therthe howbeit he fell not / and returned to his company and
ran no more yt day. Than another squier of England ca^e forth called Lancaster
/ he sent to touch ye shield of sir Bou^iquant. they ran togider and tainted
each other on ye helmes yt the fire flewe out / and marueyle it was yt they had
not ben vnhelmed. It was not long till they ran the.ii. course but their horses
crossed / the third course they were both vnhelmed / and the English squire
iusted no more yt day. Than a young knight called sir John^ Tail boise iusted
with the lord of saint Pie / and encou^tred each other on ye sheldes and brake
their staves / the.ii. course their horses crossed / and the iii. course they
were both vnhelmed / the Englisshe knight ran no more that day. Than stepte
forth it Godfray of Seca a gentle knight and a good iuster / and that was
well seen by him / he encou^tred with sir Raynolde du Roy. They came right
toguyder and met in their sheldes / the speres were good and would not break
/ so yt it made their horses to reeule / and than recovered and kept still
their speres / and than ran again these could course / the ressed in fante of
the horses and not of the knights / and they lost both their staves. they ran
again the.iii. course The English knight struck sir Raynolde on the helm
that he was vnhelmed / and sir Raynolde struck yt English knight on the targe
so rudely and with such strength (for he was called one of the best iusters in
all the realm of France. Also he lived in amors with a young lady which
aueyled him in all his business) that he perced the^glisshmans targe clean
through / and the spear heed entered in to the arm / and the spear brake and
the trouchon stacke still in ye shield and in the knight / arm / yet for all
yt the knight made his turn and came to his place fresshly. than his company
drew out the trouchyon and bound his arm / and sir Raynolde returned to his
company.

Of that course sir Roynolde du Roy was greatly praised on both perties / for
all ye hurtyng of the knight / for such is the adue^tures of arms / to some
good to some yuell. Than came forth an Esquyer of England called Balquet /
and sent to touch the shield of the lord of saint Py / who was ready to
answer They couched their spears and ran toguyder. ye first course they
taynted each other on their helmes and lost their staves. they took their
staves again / and in ye aprochyng their horses crossed and so passed by / and
returned again to their places. They tarried not long but ran each at other /
with yt course Blaque^ struck ye lord of saint Pie a hye on ye helm and gave
him a sore stroke / and saint Pie struck him in the sight of the heelm a sorer
stroke so that therewith he was so vnhelmed / that ye bocle behind brake / and
the helm fell to the ground. Than Blaquet returned to his copany / and
iusted no more that day. And ye lord of saint Pie sat still on his horse
abiding other comers. Than a gentle knight or England called sir John^ Bolcas
/ touched the shield of the lord of saint Pie / who was there ready to answer.
they struck each other on the shield that it was marvel they were not perced
/ for their speres were strong / how be it they passed by and lost their
spears without any other do^mage. The.ii. course they taynted on the helmes /
without any hurt / and passed by. ye.iii. course they crossed. the.iiii.
course the lord of saint Pie vnhelmed rude lie sir Johan Bolcas. After that
course the englisshe knight ran no more. Than a young knight of England richely
armed / named Thomelyn Massydone / he touched ye shield or war of sir
Bouciquant. He was incontinent answered. The first course they crossed on the
helmes. the.ii. course they met / and Thomelyn brake his spear in tro^chions /
and Bouciquant struck him so sore / that he bare him to the earth over his
horse back. Than his co^panyon took him up and he iusted no more. Than another
squier of England called Nauerton / touched the shield of sir Bouciquant /
saying how he would revenge his company / whom Bouciquant had overthrown in
his p^sence / who was ready to answer The first course they struck each other
in the viser of their helmes / without any other do^mage. the.ii. course they
struck each other in their sheldes / so yt their horses reculed and brake their
spears in three pieces. Than they returned to their places and took new
spears / and met again together. sir Bouciquant received a great stroke on ye
shield / but he struck Nauerton / in such wise that he was vnhelmed / who ran
no more that day / for every man said he had well acquyted him self. Than
another squire called Sequaqueton an expert man of arms / sent to touch the
shield of sir Raynolde du Roye / the knight was ready to answer well mounted
with shield and spear. They met so rudely that Sequaqueton bare him self
well fro falling / for he had such a stroke that he sore reuersed howbeit he
releued and passed forth / but he lost his spear. The next course they meet
rudely on their helmes / so that the fire flasshed out. The.iii. course
Sequaqueton was vnhelmed / so that both he and his horse were astonyed and
returned to his company / and iusted no more that day nor no man else / for the
night aproched: than the English men returned to Calys / and the frenchmen
to saint Ingylbertes.

ye may well know that Charles the french king was sore desirous to be at
those iustes / he was young and light of spirit / and glad to se new things.
It was showed me that fro the beginning to thendyng he was there present /
disgysed as unknown / so that none knew him but the lord of Garasyers / who
ca^e also with him as unknown / and every day returned to Margison. Than on ye
wednisday the englisshmen rode fro Calais and came to the place of ye iustes.
Than a squier of England called John^ Savage / sent to touch the shield of
war of sir Raynold of Roy / the knight was ready in his pauylion and issued
out and mounted on his horse. tha^ they came togider with great randon / and
struck each other on their sheldes / in such wise that if their sheldes had
not broken / outher one of the men or both had been stricken to ye ground This
was a goodly and a dangerous course / howbeit the knights took no do^mage.
Their speres brake to their hands and the heedes stacke still in their sheldes
every man fered they had been hurt / so every pertie ca^e to their company. and
when it was known that they had no hurt / every man was joyful and said /
how they had done enough for that day. but those words pleased nothing Johan
Savage / for he said he was not come over the sea to ryn but one course. Those
words were showed to sir Raynolde du Roy / and he answered and said. It is
reason that he be answered / outher by me or by some of my company. Than they
took new sheldes and spears / and ran again toguyder* but at the cope their
horses crossed and so failed each other / wherewith they were sore displeased /
and for anger cast away their speres and took new. And at the third course
they taynted each other in the sight of their helmes / in such wise / that
both were vnhelmed: every man praised that course. The english men came to
Johan Savage and said. how he had right honorably acquyted himself that day

nor death. The third course sir Raynolde du Roye was rudely vnhelmed / and sir
Johan Dambretycourt passed forth his turn and came again to his place. And
sir Raynolde du Roye returned to his company / and showed how he would no

there was none other co^munynge / but of the iustes that had been done that
day. The French men went to Margyson / and devised there at their pleasure.

ON the thursdaye the fourth day of the weke / the English men being at
Calais / assembled togider all such as had not Iusted / and were come over the sea for that intent. They concluded to return again to saint Ingylbertes to
do arms / so they mounted on their horses and rode out of Calays and came to
ye place / where as the iustes should be done. There was ready the three knights
of France in their pauylions and such other as should serve them. First there
came in to the place a knight to England called sir Godfray Eustace / he

sheldes / and their spears brake without any do^mage / and passed forth and

English knight iusted no more / for it was said to him he had right
valyauntly acquyted him self / and also that he must suffer other to just.

Than an English squier came forth to just called Alayne Borowe / he

Than they made them ready and ran toguyder but the knight of Behaygne made a
forfaite / whereof he was greatly blamed yt he demeaned his course so yuell. The
English men saw well how he had forfaite his armure and horse / if the
French men would. Of this course there was great co^munycacyon between the
parties / but finally it was pardoned / the better to please the English men.
Than Herchau^ce required again to just one course / he was demanded against
whom he would ryn. He sent to touch the shield of sir Raynolde du Roy / and
he was ready to answer. The first course they met in the mids of their
sheldes and sir Raynolde du Roye / who was one of best iusters in ye realm of
France / struck the other knight clean fro his horse / in such wise / that
men thought he had been deed. Herchaunce with much pain was releued and
brought to his company. The Englisshe men were not displeased in that he was
overthrown / because he ran the first course so ungoodly. So he ran no more
that day.

THan came in a squire of England / called Robert Storborne. he touched the

they taynted on their helmes. The second course they struck in their sheldes
and lost their spears The third course each vnhelmed other. the English
squire ran no more. Than John^ Morlande touched the shield of ser Raynold du
Roy who was ready to answer. The first course they taynted on their helmes. The
second course they encountered each other that their horses were astonyed / and

course they taynted and passed forth the second course they taynted on their
helmes and lost their staves. The third course Johan Moton was vnhelmed. He
ran on more that day / but gave place to other.

Than Iaqueuyne Scrope touched the shield of the lord of saint Pie / who was
ready mounted. The first course their horses crossed / wherewith they were sore
displeased The second course they taynted on their helmes / that the fire
flewe out and lost their speres. The third course Iaqueuyne Scrope brake his
spear / but the lord of saint Pie struck him so rudely / yt he fell over his
horse crope to the earth / he was releued and ran no more that day. Than
another squier ca^e forth called Guyllyam Maquelee. He ran against sir
Boucyquaunt who was ready to answer. The first course they taynted on their
helmes / that the fire flewe out. ye course was praised of every party. The
second course they struck each other in the sheldes and lost their staves.
The third course they vnhelmed each other / so that both sat bareheeded in
their coyfes. They ran no more that day / for they had done yough. Than
another Squire of England called Nycholas Leau / he touched the Shield of the
lord of saint Pie / he was ready to answer. the first course they struck each
other so sore on ye sheldes / that if their staves had not broken it had been to
their great do^mage / but they held the^ selfs well fro falling. The second
cope they attaynted each other on the helmes that the fire flewe out / for
their strokes crossed and so passed by. The third was a goodly course / for
they struck each other so euin in ye sight of their helmes / that each of them
vnhelmed other / so clearly / that their helmes flewe in to the field over
their horse cropes. the iusters ceased for that day / for there was none
Englisshe man that offered to just any more that day. Than the earl of
Huntyngdon and the earl Marshall / and the lord Clyfforde / the lord Beamont
/ sir Johan Clynton / sir Johan Dambretycourt / sir Peter Shyrborne / and all
other knights that had iusted those four days with the french knights
thanked them greatly of their pastaunce / and said. syrs all such as would
just of our party have accomplisshed their desires / wherefore now we will
take leave of you / we will return to Calays / and so in to England. And we
know well that who so ever will just with you shall find you here these
thyrty days / acordynge to the tenoure of your challenge. and we ones come into
England / such knights as desire to do deeds of arms / we shall desire them
to come to vysite you. The three knights thanked them and said. They shall be
right hertely welcome / and we shall deliver them acordynge to the right of
arms / as we have done you / and more over we thank you of the curtesy yt ye
have showed to us. Thus in curtes manner the english men departed fro saint
Ingilbertes and rode to Calays / where they tarried not long / for the
saturdaye after they took shyppynge and sailed to Dover / and was there by
noone / and the sunday they rode to Rochester / and the next day to London /
and so every man to his own. The three french knights kept still their place
at saint Ingylbertes. The french king and the lord of Garancyers / who had been there all that season was unknown (when the english men were departed)
they never seized riding / till they came to Crayll on the river of Oyse /
where the queen was at that time. After that the English men came in to
England I herd not that any mo came over to do any deeds of arms at saint
Ingylbertes / how be it the three french knights held still their place till
their thyrty days were accomplysshed / and than at their leysar they returned
every manne and came to Paris to se the king and the duke of Thourayne and
other lords that were at Paris at that time / who made them good chere / as
reason required / for they had valyauntly borne them self / whereby they
atcheued great honor of the king and of the realm of France.

Of the enterprise and voyage of the knights of France and England / and of
the duke of Burbone who was chief of that army / at the request of the
genouoys / to go in to Barbary to besiege the strong town of Auffryke. Cap.
C.lxix.
I Shall now declare the manner of an high and noble enterprise that was done
in this season by knights of France / of England / and of other countries /
in the realm of Barbary. Sith I have concluded the arms that was done at
saint Ingylbertes / now will I show of other matters / for to me it is great
pleasure to declare them / for if pleasure had not inclyned me to write and to
inquire for the truth of many matters / I had never come to an end as I have
done. Now says the text of the matter that I will proceed on / yt in this
season news spredde abroad in France and in diverse other countries that the
genouoys would make an army to go in to Barbary with great prouysion / as well
of bysquet as fresshe water and wyneger / with gales and vessels for all
knights and squyers that would go in that voyage. the cause that moved them
thus to do I shall show you. Of alonge time the affrycans had made war by
see on the fronters of the genouoys / and pylled and robbed their Islands /
such as were obeysant to them / and also the river of Genes lay ever in parell
and danger of them of Auffryke / which was a strong town on ye parties /
garnysshed with gates / towers / and high and thycke walls / deep dykes. And
like as the strong town of Calays is the key whereby who soever is lord thereof
may enter into the realm of France / or in to Flaunders at his pleasure / and
may by see or by land suddenly invade with great puyssaunce / and do many
great feats. In like wise by comparyson this town of Auffryke is the key of
the barbaryns and of the realm of Auffryke / and of the realms of Bougne /
and Thunes / and of other realms of the infydeles in those parties. This town
did much dyspleasure to the genouoys / who are great merchants / and by them
of Aufryke they were often times taken on ye see / as they went or returned fro
their feate of marchaundyses. Than the genouoys who were rich and puyssaunt
both by land and by see / having great sygnories / they regarded the deeds of
the affrycans / and also consydred the complayntes of such isles as were under
their obeysaunce / as the isle Dable the isle of Sire / the isle of Guerse /
the isle of Bostan / the isle of Gorgennem / and unto ye Gulf of Lion / and to
the isles of Sardonne and Finisse / and unto the isle of Mayllorke / which
three isles be under the obeysaunce of the king of Aragon. Than the genouoys by
common acorde agreed to send in to the french court / and to offer to all
knights and squiers that would go with them to be siege this town of Aufryke
/ to find them galees / and other vessels charged with bysquet / sweet water /
and wyneger / at their cost and charge / so that one of the french kings
uncles or else his brother the duke of Thourayn / who was young and lusty / and
lykely to conquer honor / should be capytayne general. And the genouoys
furthermore promised.xii. thousand crosbowes genouoys well furnysshed / and
eight thousand of other with spears and pauesses / at their cost and charge.
This the genouoys did because they knew that there was a trewce between
England and France for three year / wherefore they supposed that knights and
i^quyers as well of France as of England / would be glad to be doing in some
part.

When tidings came first into France of this voyage / the knights and
squiers of the country were right joyful / and the messangers fro Genne were
answered that they should not depart till they were well herd and so to have
socour / their request was so reasonable / as to the augmentynge of the christian
faith. Thus they were caused to tarry a season at Paris. There to debate that
matter / and to se who should be chief soueraygne of the army for that voyage /
and to whom every man should obey. The duke of Thourayne of his own volu^tary
will / offered him self to go. but the king and his uncles would in no wise
agree thereto / saying how it was no voyage for him / and they consydred well
how yt genouoys desired outher to have him or else one of the kings uncles.
Than it was agreed that the duke of Burbone uncle to the king should be
sovereign and chief of that army / and should have in his company the lord of
Coucy. When the ambassadors of Gene were answered that it was concluded
without fail yt they should have aid of knights and squyers of France / and
the kings uncle the duke of Burbone to be sovereign and chief capytayne /
whereof these ambassadors were well content / and took their leave of the
king and of his counsel / and returned in to their own country. Tydinges
anon spread abroad in yt realm of France af this voyage into Barbary. To some
it was plesaunt / and to some not delectable / and many that would have gone
went not. There was none that went but on their own charge and cost. No
lord sent any but of their own servants. Also it was ordained that none
should pass of the nacyon of France / without license of the king / for the
king would not that so many should have gone to leave the realm destitute of
knights and squyers. Also it was agreed that no varlettes should pass / but
all gentle / men / and men of feate and defense. Also to please all other
nacyons / knights and squiers strangers had fre lyberty to come and to enter
into this honorable voyage / whereof all knights strangers greatly praised the
french king and his counsel for that deed. The duke of Burbone who was one
of the chief of the realm / sent incontinent his officers to Gennes to make
prouysyon acordynge to his astate. The gentle earl of Auuergne sent also to
Gennes to make his prouysions / and the lord of Coucy was not behind. Also
sir Guy de la Tremoyle / and sir Johan of Vyen admyrall of France / and all
other lords and knights such as were ordained to go in that voyage / sent to
make their prouysions / every man after his degree. Also so did sir Philyppe de
Arthoys earl of Eawe / and sir Phylip of Bare / the lord of Harcourt / sir
Henry Dantoinge. Also out of Bretayne and Normandy many lords and other
aparelled them selfs to go into Barbary. Also of Haynalt the lord of Ligne /
the lord of Haureth / and for the^ of Flaunders there was great prouysion made.
Also the duke of Lancaster had a bastard son called Henry of Lancastre / he
had devotion to go in ye same voyage / and he provided him of good knights and
squyers of England / that acompanyed him in that voyage. The earl of Foiz sent
his bastard son called Iobbayne of Foiz / well provided with knights and
squiers of Bierne. Every man provided them selfs nobly and each for other /
and about the mids of May the yt were furthest of fro Gene set forward to
come to Gennes / whereas ye assemble was appointed / and where as all their
galees and vessels were assembled. It was a month or they could all assemble
there. The genouoys were right joyful of their coming / and gave great
presents to the chief lords / the better thereby to win their loves. They
were nombred when they were together by ye marshals xiiii. hundred knights and
squyers. Than they entered in to the galees and vessels that were provided for
them / well furnisshed of all things necessary. Thus they departed fro the
port of Gennes about the feast of mydsomer / in the year of our lord god a
thousand three hundred fourscore and ten.

GReat pleasure it was to behold their departing and to se their standards /
getorns / and penons wanynge in the wind and shynynge against the son / and
to here ye trompettes and claryons sownyng in the air / with other mynstrelsy.
The first night they lay at ancre at the entryng in to the high see. all
varlettes and horses abode behind / a horse that was worth fyfty frankes at
their departing was sold for ten frankes / for there were many knights and
squiers that wyste not when they should return. they could not have five
horses kept at Gennes for a frank a day / and therefore at their departing
they made money of them / and that was but little. There were a hundred galees
garnisshed with men of war / crosbowes / and pauesses / and mo than a.C. of
other vessels laden with prouysion and other necessaryes. The next day at the
break of the day they weyed ancres / and rowed all that day by force of owers
and the night following / costyng the land. The third day they came to
Portefyn / and there cast ancre / and tarried there all that night / and the
next day they came to another port and town called the port Ve^der / and
there tarried and refresshed them. The next day they passed further into the
great see in the name of god and our lady / and saint George / and first they
found the isle of Dable / and than yt isle of Guerfe / the isle of Argenen /
and the isle of Sardyns / and passed the Gulf of the Lion / which was a
dangerous and a doutfull passage / but they could not eschew it the way yt
they took / they were there in great parell all to have been lost. the season
was so troublus and tempests so terryble / that ye wysest maryner yt there was
could give no counsel but to abide the adventure / and the will of god /
whereby the flete departed a sonder some here and some there / they wist never
where. This tempest endured a day and a night. when this tempest was sest / and
ye wyndes pacifyed / than the patrons and pylottes set their courses to draw
to the isle of Co^meres / a.xxx. mile fro Auffryke. and fro the town thither as
they entented to go. For at the going out of the Gulf of Lion / the patrones
said one to a another / if it fortune that we be driven a sonder by force of
wind and wether / than let us draw to the isle of Co^meres / and there
let us tarry each for other. And as they had devised so they did / for the
first that came thither tarried till the last came / and or all could assemble
there together it was a nine days. This isle of Co^meres is a pleasant isle /
thought it be not great. There the lords refresshed them and thanked god /
whhan they saw they had lost none of their company. Thanne the lords and
patrons took counsel what was best for them to do / consyderinge they were so
nere ye town of Aufryke.

Now I will leave to speak of these lords of France for a season / and speak
of other matters that was done in that season in Frau^cel and specially in the
country of Auuergne / in the marches of the land of the earl Dolphyn / who
was forth in the said voyage.

Of a capytayne a robber and a pyller of the country / called Aymergot Marcell
/ who held a strong castle in the marches of Rouergne called the Roche of
Vandois / and how it was besieged by the vicount of Meaulx / and of the
taking thereof / and how Aymerygotte was taken and brought to Paris. Cap.
C.lxx.
IN this season while this assemble was a making to go in to Barbary for a good
entente / as to exalte the christian faith / certain robbers and pyllers in
Auuergne / and Rouergne / and in Lymosyn / were of contrary minds / for though
the countries thought themself in surety / by reason of the chartre of the
treuce that was taken between England and France / which had been proclaimed
and publysshed in all fortresses / and before all the capitayns that made any
war / or held any fortresses of the englissh part. And an article there was
/ that who so ever brake or violated any point or article comprised in the
treaty should receive punyssyon of death / without hope of any remyssion / and
specially Perot le Bernoys capytayne of Caluset / Amergot Marcell / Olyue Barbe
capytayne of Dousac / in the marches of Auuergne / were enclosed by name in the
charter of the treuse / to the intent that if they or any of theirs did or
consented to do any thing contrary / yt they should not ercuse them self.
some of the capytayns that feared to dye a shamfull death / or to rynne in to
the indygnacion of the french king / held surely all the points of the
charter. But some did not so which they derely bought / as ye shall here after.

ye shall know as it has been here before rehearsed / how Johan earl of
Armynake and Bernarde dolphyn of Auuergne / and therle Clermounte / were in
treaty with certain capytayns that held fortresses in the said countries
against the french king. These said lords made such dylygence that they
brought diverse of these capytayns to composycion / and to the sellyng of their
fortresses. Their treaty and composicyon was yt they should renounce the war
between England and France / and during the treuce they to go with the earl
of Armynake in to Lombardy / or whyder as he would lead them / to aid him in
his war a gaynst the lord Galeas earl of Virtues / who had disheryted his
cosyn germayns / children to his uncle the lord Barnabo / as it has been
showed here before / and so what to have their aid and to avoid the country
of these robbers and pyllers (who had done so much hurt in the country /
both to men and women) the said earl of Armynake / and the earl Dolphyn his
cosyn / took great pain in that matter. And at the instant requests and prayers
of the good men of the cities and towns of the plain countries aforesaid /
so that there was a tail gadred in Auuergne / Guynaldan / Rouergne Carnosyn /
and in Lymosyn / to ye so^me of two hundred thousand frankes / so that poor
and rich paid somoch / that diverse sold and laid to pledge their herytages
/ and were glad so to do to live at rest in their countries. And the good men
thought by reason of payeng of this money / and aduoydyng of the said five
robbers and pyllers / that they should than have been quyte for ever of them /
but it proved not so in diverse places / and specially of Aymergot Marcell and
of his men. For after that the castle of Aloys was yelden up and sold by
Aymergot Marcell to the earl of Armynake / which fortress stood in the heart
of all Auuergne / this Aymergot was well worth in ready money a hundred
thousand frankes / which he had gotten by robory and pyllage / and by
raunsominge of men / and patesynge of the country / and he had kept ye rule
more than ten year. Therle of Armynake desired greatly to have in his company
the said Aymergot Mercell and thought not to leave him behynd him for two
reasons. One was / because he would gladly have the counsel and advise of him
/ for he was expert and subtyle in all feats of arms / both in sautynge /
sealynge / and stealing of fortresses. The second reason was / the earl
feared that if this Aymergot should a bide behind in the country / though he
had sold to him the fortress of Aloyse and other fortresses / yet he might
do much damage in the country of Auuergne and Rouergne / wherefore therle made
great labor to have him. But always Aymergot dissymuled the matter and said.
When I se the certain of the earl of Armynakes departing / than I know mine
own will is so good yt I will not bide behind. Other answer the earl could
not get of him. The earl of Armynake lay at Coming and about Tholousyn / in
his country / and there made his assemble / which voyage had been more hasted
/ and the voyage in to Auffryke had not been / that let him a season / for
diverse knights and squyers that went in that voyage had promised him / and
this voyage in to Barbary came so suddenly that it hyndred his voyage. When
tidings was known in France of the treaties that the earl of Armynake had
made with the said capytayns in Auuergne / there was made as much haste as
might be to pay the money to the capytayns.

Aymergot Marsell was sore dyspleased with him self in that he had sold and
delivered the strong castle of Aloyse / for he saw his own auctorite thereby
greatly abated / and parceyued well how he was the less feared / for all the
season that he kept it he was doubted and feared / and honored with all men of
war of his part / and had kept a great astate always in the castle of
Aloyse. The patesynge of countries that he held under subjection / was well
worth yearly twenty thousand florayns. When he remembered all this he was
soroufull / his tresour he thought he would not mynysshe / he was wont daily
to search for new pyllages / whereby encresed his profit / and than he saw
that all was closed fro him. Than he said and imagyned / that to pyll and to
rob (all thing considered) was a good life / and so repented him of his good
doing. On a time he said to his old companyons. Sirs / there is no sport nor
glory in this world among men of war / but to use such life as we have
done in time past. What a joy was it to us when we rode forth at adventure /
and sometime found by the way a rich priour or merchant / or a route of
mulettes of Mountpellyer / of Narbone / of Lymons / of Fongans / of Besyers /
of Tholous / or of Carcassone / laden with clothe of Bruselles / or peltre ware
coming fro the fayres / or laden with spycery fro Bruges / fro Damas / or fro
Alysau^der / what so ever we met all was ours / or else raunsomed at our
pleasures / daily we gate new money / and the vyllaynes of Auuergne and of
Lymosyn daily provided and brought to our castle whete mele / breed ready baken
/ otes for our horses / and lytter / good wynes / beffes / and fat mottons /
pullayne / and wyldefoule / we were ever furnysshed as though we had been
kings. when we rode forth all ye country trymbled for fear / all was ours
going or coming? How took we Carlaste / I and the Bourge of Compayne / and I
and Perot of Bernoys took Caluset? How did we scale with little aid the
strong castle of Marquell / pertayninge to the earl Dolphyn / I kept it not
past five days but I received for it on a fair table five thousand frankes /
and forgave one thousand for the love of the earl Dolphyns children? By my
faith this was a fair and a good life / wherefore I repute my self sore
disceyued in that I have rendered up the fortres of Aloys / for it would have been kept fro all the world / and the / day that I gave it up / it was
fournysshed with vytayles to have been kept seven year without any
reuytaylynge. This earl of Armynake has dysceyued me / Olyue Barbe and
Perotle Bernoys showed me how I should repent my self. certain I sore
repent me of that I have done. And when such of his companyons as had served
him long herd him speak those words / they parceyued well how he spoke them
with all his heart unfeigned. Than they said to him. Aymergot we are all ready
yet to serve you / let us renew again our war / and let us get some
strong hold in Auuergne or in Lymosyn / and let us fortifye it / and than sir
we shall soon recover our domages. we shall make a goodly flight in Auuergne
and in Lymosyn / for as now the earl Dolphyn and Hugh his brother are out of
the country / and diverse other knights and squyers in their company in to the
voyage of Barbary / and specially the lord of Coucy / who has the sovereign
regard under the king of all those marches / therefore we shall not need to
fear him / nor the duke of Berrey / for he is at Paris / so thus we shall have
now a good season. Well quod Aymergot / I have good will thus to do / saving
I am by name expressed in the chartre of the treuce. What for that sir quod
his company / ye need not care therefore if ye list. ye are not subject to the
french king / ye owe him another faith nor obeysayunce / ye are the king of
Englandes manne / for your heritage (which is all dystroyd and lost) lies in
Lymosyn / and sir we must live. and though we make war to live the
englysshmen will not be myscontent with us / and such as be in our case will
draw to us. And sir we have now good title to make war / for we be not now
in Auuergne where the couenaunte was made that we be bound unto. let us
send to the vyllayns of the vyllages when we be ones in a strong hold /
and command them to pay us a truage / or else to make them sore war. Well
syrs quod Aymergot / first let us provide for a strong place to abide in and
to draw unto when we need. Some of them said / sir we know where there is a
strong hold / with a little new fortifyenge / pertaining to the heritage of
the lord of the Tower / no man keeps it / let us draw thither and fortifye
it / than may we at our ease rynne in to Auuergne and Lymosyn. Where lies this
place quod Aymergot? Sir quod they within a leage of the Tower / and it is
called the Roche of Vandoys. It is true quod Aymergot / I know it well / it
is a mete place for us / let us go thither and fortify it. Thus on this
purpose they concluded / and on a day assembled together and went to the Roche
of Vandoys. Than Aymergote auewed the place to se if it were worth the
fortifyenge thereof. And when he had well auewed the sytuacion thereof / and the
defenses that might be made there / it pleased him right well. Thus they took
it and fortifyed it little and little or they began to do any dyspleasure in
the country. And when they saw the place strong sufficyently to resyst a
gaynste syege or assaute / and that they were well horsed and well provided of
all things necessary for their defense / than they began to ride abroad in
the country and took prisoners and raunsomed them / and provided their hold
with flesh / meal / wax / wine / salt / iron / and stele / and of all
other necessaryes. There came nothing amysse to them without it had been to
heavy or to hot. The country all about and the people / wenynge to have been
in rest and peace by reason of the truce made between the two kings and their
realms / they began than to be sore abashed / for these robbers and pyllers
took them in their houses / and where so ever they found them / in the feldes
laboring. and they called them selfs adventurers. When the lord of the
tower knew that he had such neighbors so nere him / he was not well assured
of him self but fortifyed and made good watch in all his towns and
castelles. The countess of Dolphyn a right valiant lady and of great prudence
/ being with her children in a good town and strong castle of hers called
Sardes / she was not well assured of her self when she herd that Aymergotte
and his company had fortifyed yt Roche of Vandoys. She sent incontynente to all
her castle and furnysshed them with men of war / as Marquell / Oudable /
Chyllac / and Blere / and in to other places / to the entente they should not
be surprysed / for she greatly douted this Aymergot because he had of her
before at one paymente five thousand florayns. Surely all the country of
Auuergne and Lymosyn began greatly to be a frayde. Thanne the knights and
squyers / and men of the good towns / as of Cleremount / of Mount Ferante /
and of Ryon / determined to send to the french king / and so they did.

IN the mean season while the said countess and the other good men of the
country did send to the french king and to the duke of Berrey / who as than
were at Paris / Aymergot and his company fortifyed greatly the Roche of
Vandoys. first they made a lodging for their horses. When all other adue^tures
who were discharged out of wages herd how Aymergot made war again / they
were right joyful thereof / and many came to him. Anon he had mo of these
robbers and pyllers than he would have / they demanded no wages of him / but
all only that they might be of his band / for all such as might be of his
company they knew well they should lightly win somewhat / for they were
habandoned to rob and to pyll. Thus they rode up and down and made them
self to be known in diverse places. There was no speaking in Auuergne and
Lymosyn but of them of Roche Vandoys / the country was sore afraid. They of
Caluset (whereof Perotte le Bernoys was capytayne) held and kept fermely the
treuce that was made / and when he saw that Aymergot Marcell over ran so the
country / he was sore dyspleased with him / and said how he did yuell / and
sent him word that he nor none of his should come in to Caluset / nor in to
none other place where he had any rewle. Aymergot cared nothing for that / for
he had places ynowe to draw unto. beside that he had men ynowe / and daily
increased / for such as were minded to do yuell drew to him daily. Perot of
Bernoys charged such as were under his reule on pain of their lives that none
should ride out to do any damage to his neighbors for he said he would surely
keep the trewce. Olyue Barbe captain of Ousac dyssymuled the matter / saying
how he would keep the treuce / how be it as it was showed me some of his men
sometime would ride forth secretlye / and what they wanne he would have the
profit thereof. The men of the countries of Cleremount / of Mount Ferant / and
of Ryon who were going in message to the french king / and to the duke of
Berrey. They sped so in their iourneys that they came to Paris / and there
found the king / the duke of Berrey / the duke of Thourayne / and the
constable of France sir Olyuer of Clysson. They came first to the duke of
Berrey and to his counsel / and showed the cause of their coming / how
Aymergot Marcell made war and dystroyed the country of Auuergne / and how
the yuell people daily multyplyed / wherefore they desired for goddessake to
have some remedy. saying if these yuell people should long contyne we / they
would distroy the country of Auuergne / and the fronters of Lymosyn. When
these tidings came to the king and to the duke of Berrey / they were sore
dyspleased / for they had thought all had been in peace / by reason of the
treuce. Than the king demanded if they of the garyson of Caluset and Ousac did
any yuell or not. They answered and said / they complained of no man but al
only of Aymergot Marcell and of his company / who has fortifyed the Roche of
Vandoys. Thanne the king and the duke of Berrey answered and said. Syrs ye
good people take good herd to your selfs and we shall provide shortly a
remedy / that ye shall well perceive* return to your places and show this
answer to them that sent you hither. These good men of Auuergne were well
content with their answer / and tarried there two days / and thanne returned
and took their leave specially of the duke of Berrey and so departed.

THe french king and his counsel forgate not these tidings / nor the duke
of Berrey / whom the matter touched greatly / because he held great herytages
in Auuergne / therefore he auaunced the business. ye have herd here before
how the lord of Coucy was ordained by the king and his counsel to be
captain / and to have the soueraygne rewle of all the country / fro the sea
by Rochell / unto the river of Dordone and to Bordeaux on the river of Geron.
As than the lord of Coucy was not in the country: He was going in the voyage
to Barbary / with other lords of France / and of other countries. How be it
at his departing he ordained his cosyn sir Robert of Bethune Vycount of Meaulx
to be his lyeutenaunt in the said country. Than the king said / how it was
most metest that the vycount of Meaulx should have the charge of that voyage
to go in to La^guedocke / rather than^e any other person. He was at Could on
the river of Marne. The king wrote to him. The messangere found him with his
wife at Counde / and there he delivered his letters fro the French king. The
vycount received them / and whane he knew what they mente / he said he would
obey the kings commandment. He prepared him self as soon as he might / and
departed fro Cou^de and rode so long that he cae to Paris where he found the
king and his counsel / who said unto him. Vycount make you ready / assemble
the men of war of your retynue / for ye must go in to Auuergne. There be of
these pyllers and robbers / of whom Aymergotte Mercell is chief / as we be
enfourmed / who distroyech and sore traueyleth the good people there. Do ye so
much as to drive them out of that country: And if ye may attrap the said
Aymergotte bring him to us / and we shall have great joy thereof. It is
ordained that there shall be delivered to you / such sommes of money at
Cleremount / that shall suffyce for your men of war. And to go fro hens
thider speak to our treasourers / and they shall deliver you for your
expenses. Make haste / for it requires dyligence. The Vycount answered how
he was ready / and so went to his lodging. And there he wrote letters to
knights and squyers in France and Picardy of his acquayntaunce and retynewe /
that they in all have should mete with him at Charters / and there to make
their musters. such as he wrote unto obeyed / they loved the Vycount / for they
held him for a good captain. So they came to the city of Charters at their
day prefyxed. There assembled a two hundred spears of good men of war.
Whan^e they were assembled / they departed fro Charters and took the way
toward Auuergne / and so came in to Burbonoys. tidings came in to Auuergne
how socours was coming to them out of France / whereof all the country was
reioysed.

IT was needful that these men of war came thither so soon as they did /
for and they had tarried but six days lengar / aymergot Marcell and his
band had thought to have over run the plain country / between Cleremount
and Mou^tferante / and about Ryon to Ganape. And if they had made that voyage
they had done great dommage to the country / more to the valewe than a
hundred thousand frankes / for in those marchesse lay the richesse of
Auuergne / and no man should have resysted the^ for the country as than^e was
void of any man of war. And also the brute was / that Aymergotte Mercelles
company was far mo in nombre than^e they were in deed. Aymergotte was ready to
have made this journey / but tidings came to him how soever it was by
pylgrimes or by espyes that the vycou^t of Meaulx with a great company was
coming against him to make him war / and to put him out of his fortress
of the Roche of Vandoys. These news let his enterprice / and kept him
self within his hold / and thought they should be besieged. Than Aymergot
Marcell began to dought and repented him of that he had done / for he knew
well if that he were takenne / there should no ransom go for him. Thanne he
said to some of his company. I am shamed: I have believed yuell counsel:
Couytousnesse shall distroye me / without I have conforte. Than^e they said to
him. Sir / why dought ye thus? We have seen you the hardyest man of arms of
all these marchesse. We have a good garyson and well provided and we are men of
defense / and love as well to defend our bodies / as ye do to defend yours /
ye can lose nothing but we must lose also. If by adventure ye be taken / ye
shall make your fynaunce according to reason. ye have good enough and we have
nothing. If we be taken it lies on our heedes / we get none other
remission. We shall sell ou^ lives dear. Let us defend our self as well as
we can / be not abashed with any thing that we here or se. We think we shall
natte need to care for any siege. Let us war wisely. Thus these companyons
conforted Aymergot Marcell.

THe Vycounte of Meaulx with his company came forward till they came to Moleyns
in Burbonoys. There the duchess of Burbone / daughter to the Earl Dolphyn
received the Vycount and his knights right honorably / and made them to dyne.
Than they passed forth and lay that night at saint Pursant / and fro thens to
Ganape and so to Argre Prose / and than to Ryon / and fro thens to Cleremount
where they were well received with the bishop and with them of the town.
There the men of war had money / for there was a tail gadered and delivered
at Cleremont. Thanne they passed forth and came to our lady of Dorinall a
four leages fro the Roche of Va^doyes. There the Vycount rested and sent for
the knights and squyers of Auuergne and of Lymosyn. There they assembled. They
were than to the nombre of four hundred spears one and other / and about a
hundred cross bows of genowayes. There was with the Vycounte of Meaulxe the
lord of Montague / Vermendisyens / and his brother the lord of Dommart / and
sir Bernard de la River / sir Guyllyam Butler / the lord of the Domme / the
lord de la Roche / the lord of the Tower / sir Loys Dambyer / the lord of
saint Ampysse / and sir Robert Dalphyn / and diverse other. And capitayns of the
genowayes were two valiant squyers / The one named Aubert of Nespynolle and
Callenace. And as than chief Steward with the Vycount of Meaulx was a gentle
squire called Loyes of Lesglynell. These genowayes and cross bows were armed at
all pieces / else they should not have past wages with the Vycount.

WHan^e Aymergot Marcell and Guyotdu Sall his uncle / understood that these men
of war of France / of Picardy / of Auuergne / and of Gene were come to our
Lady of Dornall / and were minded to come and lay siege to their hold of
Roche va^doys. Than they aduysed what was best for them to do to make defense.
First they consydred well / that it was ^at for them to keep any horse / seeing
they should be besieged. not far of fro the Roche of Vandois there was
another strong hold called saint Souperye / under the rule of Aymergotte
Mercell / and there was his wife / and thither he sent all his pages and horses
and the most part of all his richesse. This roche of Vandoys was well
fortifyed / and it stood in a strong ground. The lord of the Tower was sore
blamed of them of the country / that he had left that place vnfortifyed and
unprovided It was commonly said in Auuergne / yt they might thank the lord
of the Tower for all the do^mage they had taken / because he might well have
kept the Roche of Vandoys / or if he would not have kept it for cost / he
might have delivered it to the men of the country / yt they might have rased it
/ in such wise / that it should not have been tenable / but he left the walls
hole and entyer / as he found them. This Roche of Vandoys is set among
high mountayns / and that rock stands a part / and on the one side the
walls be of a rock. They had so fortifyed it / that it could not be assailed
but on the fore part by scrymysshynge. The Vycount of Meaulx deperted fro our
lady of Dorcynall / and knights and squyers / and genouoys cross bows / and so
came before the Roche of Vandoys. there like good men of war they laid their
siege / and little and little amended their lodgings. Whan^e the countess of
Alfyne being at Sardes / knew the true tidings that the Roche of Va^doys
was besieged she was right joyful. And because that she thought that the
Vicount of Meaulx was come so far (as out of France and Picardy) that he had
brought with him no tents nor pauilyons. She ordained for him two fair and
good tents / parteyning to therle Dolphyn / and sent them to the Vycount / by
manner of lendynge of them to him during the siege. The vycount took the
present in good gree / and reco^maunded him hertely to the countess / tha^kyng
her for the tents that she had sent him / for they should do him good
service. The lord of the Tower was in his own country / and was within a
mile of a castle of his own / so yt he lacked nothing: other knights and
squiers made provision as well as they might. They had vitaylles plenty fro
all parts at a reasonable price. the season was fair / dry / and hot / as in
ye month of August. The knights and other co^panyons refresshed them selfs
under the grene bows. Than tidings came in to the host that did put the
lords and their companyons in dout. It was showed them that the garrisons of
their enemies / as of Caluset and of Dousacke assembled toguyder / and were
determined in a morenynge to awake the host or they were ware / and to reyse
the siege. Than the vycount of Meaulx and his knights took counsel together
and determined to send a heraude to Perot of Bernoys captain of Calusette
and to Olyue Barbe captain of Dousac to know their minds / to the intent
that they were not surprised / but that they might be assured of the English
garyso^s. And according as they had answer again / thereafter to provide for
them self. They sent an heraude and enstructed him what he should do and
say. the heraulde departed fro the host and rode to Caluset / and thereby
adventure found Perotte at the barryers with many of his company / who were
there sportyng and castyng the stone. Than the messanger lyghted from his horse
and demanded for the captain. He was brought to him / and when he came
before him he did his message fro point to point. Than Perot le Bernoys said.
Heraude / say to your masters that we will hold and keep as affermely and
trewly / the truece that is taken between England and France / in like manner
/ as we would they should keep with us. And if we know any of ours that will
break or vyolate the peace by any manner of incydent. If we may take them / we
shall do such correctyon as aparteyneth to be done / as we have promised. And
we will that ye say to your masters / that look what Aymergotte has done /
was without our counsel / for he never showed us of his purpose. We did
charge him and all his / that he should not medyll in our seignorie / if he
did / he should have an yuell end. The heraulde was had in to the fortress
and there dyned. Than he took leave and there was given him ten frankes. than
he departed and demanded the way to Dousacke / and found there Olyue Barbe /
captain of that fortress. The heraulde spoke to him in like manner / as he
had done to Perot le Bernoys. Olyue Barbe answered that in no wise he would
break the treuse / because he would not be dishonored / and there he gave him
ten frankes / and than departed and returned to his master / before ye roche
of Vandoys. Than the knights were sore desirous to here tidings / they drew
about the vycou^t. There the heraude showed how he had been at Calyset and at
Dousacke / and what answer he had of the capitayns. than the Vicount praised
much Perotte le Bernoyes and Olyue Barbe / and was as than out of doubt / and
so continued their siege.

THe siege being before the Roche of Vandoys / every day there was scrimysshing
and often times some hurt with shot of the genouoys cross bows / for the
genouoys were good shoters. Thus the siege co^tynued a nine wekes. Thenterprice
of the garyson was greatly to the advantage of them within / I shall show
you the manner how. At certain places they might issue out at their pleasure /
in dispyght of all their enemies / for and they should have kept them fro
their issues / they had need to have had mo than six.M. men. Thus during the
siege Aymergot was right ymaginatife and consydred all things / and saw well
how he had not done well / but to turn his deed in good manner / and to
thentent that the Roche of Vandoys should still remain with him. He sent in to
England a varlet of his with letters of credence / to the king of England
and to the duke of Lancastre. And of this purpose he brake his mind to an
uncle of his called Guyot du Sall / a man of a three score year of age / who had
greatly used deeds of arms / and knew much of ye world When Aymergote had
showed him the manner how he would send in to England / this Guyotte was well
agreed thereto / and said how to send a wise man thither could do no hurt.
Than they sent a varlet / who had been brought up among them. Aymergot
enstructed him and said. We shall set the out of this house in save guard
out of all peril / and thou shalt have gold and silver enough. Thou shalt
go in to England with these letters / one to the king / another to the duke
of Lancaster / and the third to the kings counsel / and all these letters
are of credence. Than they will demand of the the occasyon of thy coming
thither. And after thou have made thy reco^mendacion / thou shalt say yt
Aymergot Mercell their poor soudyour and subject / and ready with good will to
do them service / is enclosed and beseged in a little fortress parteyning to
the feaultie of Lymosyn / belongyng to the king of Englandes heritage. And
they that lie at the siege / traueyleth and takes great pain daily to win us
that does defend the fortress. And the captain of them without is a lord
/ cosyn to the lord of Coucy called sir Robert vycount of Meaulx / set there
by the French king. Therefore desire the king and his counsel / and
specially the duke of Lancastre who has the sovereign governance in Burdeloys
/ and of the king of Engla^des heritage in these perties. That it would please
them to write and to command the vycount of Meaulx to deperte fro the siege
and to reyse his army. And to write to the Vycount that he is about to break
the peace that was taken at Balyngham / between Boloygne and Calays. And
because I am in doubt what answer the vicount will make to these letters (for
he is somewhat strong and fro ward) Therefore desire that I may have in
likewise letters fro the king and his counsel / and fro the duke of Lancastre
to the duke of Berrey. For if the duke of Berrey will / incontinent the siege
shall be raised. And for the more surety / desire to have with ye some knight
of honor of the kings house or of the duke of Lancasters / such one as the
duke of Berrey knows / and the other lords of France. And show him fro me
that I shall give him a.C. frankes. Remember all these words and do thy
message acordingly and show the^ that thou spekest withal that this little
fortress that I have fortified / if it may abide still English. It shall
come well to point / and specially to the^ that will make war in these
parties for the king of England / for the fortress stands on the fro^ters
of the country / for thereby may be won at a season in Auuergne and Lymosyn /
two thousand frankes.

When Aymergot Marcell and Guyotdu Sall his uncle had well enstructed this
varlet / and that the letters of credence were written and sealed / and
delyuerd. The varlet departed by night and was well accompanied and conveyed a
foot to another fortress perteynynge to Aymergot called saint Soupery. There
he took a horse such as he would chose / for he had a great journey to ride.
He rode forth through the realm of France like a French man of Auuergne /
and so came to Calais and acquaynted him self with the Captain sir Johan
Beauchampe / and showed him part of his business / to the intent to have the
sooner passage / as he had. So he came to Dover and than took his journey to
London. And it was his fortune that the king of England and his two uncles /
and the duke of Lancastre and the kings counsel were the same time at the
palais of Westmynster in counsayling for matters of Northumberlande / for the
scotts held not well the truese / as complayntes were made. The same time
Aymergottes varlet came to London and there took his lodging / and showed his
host part of ye cause of his coming. His host brought him to Westmynster /
and caused him first to speak with the duke of Lancastre who was in his
chamber. it was or he went to the counsel. there ye varlet delivered him his
letters. the duke took and reed them. Than he drew him a part / and demanded
what credence he had. Than the varlet showed him all the hole matter / as ye
have herd here before. The duke herd him well / and demanded if he had any
mo letters / and he said that he had letters to the king and to his counsel /
that is well quod the duke / I shall cause the to have audyence. than the duke
went to the counsel. And when he saw the hour and time he moved the
varlettes matter / and by the dukes advancement the varlet was sent for. Than
he delivered to the king and to his counsel the letters / they were opyned
and reed: and than he was demanded what was his crede^ce / and the varlet who
was hardy and not abashed / showed the business of Aymergot Marcell right
sagely / and the better assured because every man gave him good audience. When
he had said as much as he would / tha^ he was answered / that the king would
take counsel in the matter and make an answer. Than he went out of the
counsel chamber and tarried till he had an answer.

THe answer was / that the king would write to the vycount of Meaulx and
also to the duke of Berrey according as Aymergot had required / and in likewise
so promised the duke of Lancastre. and when the letters were written / there was
a gentylman of the duke of Lancastres appointed to bear these letters. So they
passed the sea / and with them went Derby an heralde the better to forther the
matter / because he was aquaynted with the lords of Auuergne / and specially
with the duke of Berrey. The gentylman of the duke of Lancasters named Herbery
/ went with the better will / because the varlette promised him in the behalf
of Aymergot a hundred fra^kes. Thus they three departed and came to Dover / and
fro thens at a tide to Calis. And when their horses were vnshypped / they took
the way to Boloygne and so through Picardy / and went to Paris / and fro
thens in to Auuergne. And when they approached nere to Lymogines / and to the
country where the roche of Va^doyes was set. They rode about the more
secretly to come thither.

THus as I have showed you these messangers did so much that they came nere to
the roche of va^doyes. When they were nere where the siege lay / the squire
and the heraulde thought it for the best / not to enter in to the town at that
present time. But they sent the varlet in to the town / saying they would do
well enough without his company. For they said if he should be seen with them /
they at the siege would suppose / that he had been sent in to England for
the^. the varlet obeyed / and in the night he entered in to ye town without
danger. than Aymergot Marcell and Guyot du Sall made him good chere / and had
marueyle that he had spedde his journey in so short a space. There be showed
how he had spedde / and how a squier of the duke of La^casters and a heraude
was come with him with letters fro the king and fro the duke of Lancastre /
both to the Vycount of Meaulr and to the duke of Berrey if need were. And why
quod Aymergot mercell / are they not come hyder into this castle Sir quod the
varlet / they said they two would do their message well enough / nor they would
have no man seen in their company that should come fro you. They are the wyser
quod Guyot du Sall / thereby it shall seem that the matter touches the king of
England and the duke of Lancastre. Sir it is true quod the barlet. Of those
tidings Aymergot was joyful and said to the varlet. Thou have well and
dilygently spedde thy matters / and that in a short season / I shall well
reward the for thy labor. Thus the squire and the heraude came straight to
the siege and demanded for the Vycou^tes lodging. They were brought thither
and there they found the vycount beholding men castyng the stone. than they
kneled and saluted him and he them again / and demanded fro whens they came.
They answered and said / how they ca^e out of England / sent thither by their
king and by the duke of Lancaster. ye are welcome quod the Vycount / what matter
has brought you in to this wild country. Sir quod the heraude behold here
this squier of the duke of La^casters / who has brought to you letters fro the
king of England and fro the duke of Lancastre / if it please you to read
the^. and because I so^what knew the country I am come in his company. Than
the squire delivered his letters / and the vycount received them and beheld
the seals / and knew well they came out of England. Than he took one aparte
that could read / and there he reed the letters fro point to point two or three
times till he knew well what they meant. tha^ he studied and regarded well the
king of Englandes writing / who said in his writynge that he had marueyle that
he would lodge / sleep / and rest him with an army of men of war on his
heritage. and that he does daily all that he can to break the peace / which
he ought in no wise to do / for it is greatly ^iudiciall to them that have
set to their seals to the confyrmacion of the peace. and the conclusyon of
the letter was / how the king commanded them incontinent after the sight of
his letts that he and his company should depart and reyse their siege / and
suffer Aymergot Mercell pesably to enjoy the house parteyning to his heritage
/ which has cost him great goods the fortifieng. These words and such
other were enclosed in these letters all to the aid of Aymergot Marcell. in
like manner as the kings letters spoke / the duke of Lancaster sange the same
note / commaundyng like the excellent duke of Acquitayne and of all that duchy.
And when the vicount of Meaulx had well aduysed him self he said. Fair sirs
/ these tidings that ye have brought requires counsel and advise / I shall
take counsel and than ye shall be answered. Than they were made to dri^ke of
the vycountes wine. In the mean time the vycount took counsel / for he sent
for the lord of the Tower and for sir Guyllyam Butler / sir Robert Dolphyn /
sir Loyes Da^byer / and also for the lord Montaguy / and for sir Berat de la
River / who was of his house. And when they were all toguyder / he renewed the
words / and showed them the cause why he had sent for them / and there caused
ye letters to be reed before them. When these lords herd that / they had
great marvel how these letters could be brought out of England / for as than
they had not layne at the siege past a month. I shall show you quod the
vycount what I suppose. Aymergot Marcell is a subtell man / as soon as he saw
that he should be besieged / I think he sent inco^tynent some messanger in to
England to attain these letters / the which I may obey if I list / but I
shall answer them shortly But as in that the king of England and the duke of
Lancastre commands me to do / I will nothing obey their commandments /
for I am not bound to obey the^ / but all only the French king / by whose
commandment I am sent hyder. Call forth the squier and the heraude I shall
make them their answer / they were brought forth. Than the vycount began to
speak as follows.

you Derby and Tomelyn Herbery / thus ye be named according to the tenor of
your letters / and as it apereth ye be sent hither frothe king of England /
and fro the duke of Lancastre / they are enfourmed I can not tell how outher
by Aymergot Marcell or by some other that would aid him / and has been in
England in his name / how I am at this present time with an army of men of
war lodged on the heritage of the king of Englandes / and he commands me
to depart and reyse my siege / and to suffer Aymergot Marcell peasably to
enjoy this little fortress / which has cost so much the fortefyenge / and
also they send me word how I do put my self in parell of dyshonorynge / in
that I should consent to break the peace / sealed and conf^rmed to endure three
years between the two kings and their alyes. Fair sirs I say unto you that I
will do nothing that shall be against the charter of peace / I will keep the
treuce / and do nothing against it / and though I am lodged here it breketh no
peace nor treuce. I am subget to the french king who has sent me hither /
and has admytted me as his marshall of this small army / for it came to the
knowledge of the king my master and his counsel / by grievous complayntes of
the noble men and other of the country of Auuergne and Lymosyn / how they had
taken great domages and losses / by the means that Aymergot aduysed a strong
place between the cou^tr^^s / which was void and not inhabyted / he took and
fortefyed it / and has not made it a house of peace or solace / but a strong
fortress and a resorting place for thieves / robbers / and murderers /
whereupon I am commanded to be here to defend the country / and to the intent
that such as be assembled in this forttesse should not multyply in their
wickedness / but to punysshe them by such sentence as apartayneth to their
trespace / and for that entente I do put to my pain to take them if I can /
the which commandment of my master I will obey / and shall do my deuoyre
to acquyte me truly. and fro hence I will not depart what so ever
commandment I have / till I have the fortress / and them that be within.
And if Aymergot Marcell will say that I am auaunced to break the peace / let
him come forth and he shall be fought withal with one that is better than he
/ and shall cause to be proved by diverse points and artycles / that he him
self breaks the peace. Sirs all things consydred I make you this answer /
ye may return when it pleace you / and when ye come there as ye would be /
say none otherwise nor no less than I have said to you / for often times
reports not truly set / enfourmeth lords often times otherwise than the
truth is in deed. Sir quod the squire we are come hither for none other
purpose but to report the troth of that we here and se / and sithe ye will
none otherwise do / we need no longer to abide here and so took their leave.
And there was given to the haraulde ten frankes / for the honor of the king
of England and the duke of Lancastre.

When they were departed they took the high way to Cleremount / and said they
would again to Paris / and when they were half a leage on their way than they
began to enter in to their matter and said. As yet we have done nothing / it
behooves us to go to the duke of Berrey in to Auuergne / who is lord of this
country / for he writes him self duke of Berrey and of Auuergne / the by
count of Meaulx dare not displease the duke if he command him to depart /
and we have letters fro the king our master and fro the duke of Lancastre to
him / wherefore it is reason that we deliver them / and that we may know his
entente. They concluded on that purpose / and so rode to Cleremounte / thyde^
they were welcome / for the haraulde knew the country / and when they were
demanded what they were / they answered that they were messangers sent fro the
king of England / and than they demanded where the duke of Berrey was / and
it was showed them that the duke and the duches was in a castle of theirs
named the Nonec^e. The haraulde knew it well / he had been there before. Than
they departed fro Cleremount / and rode to Vyore / and fro thens to Nonect.
There is a high mountain to pass or one come to the castle. When they came
there ye duke of Berrey with many other was sporting without the gate / the
harauld was known with diverse. Than they were brought to ye duke / who for the
love of the king of England and of the duke of Lancastre / made them good
chere. the squire delivered his letters to the duke / who received them / and
opened and red them at length two times over. Than he studied a little and
answered them curtesly and said. Syrs for the love of our cosyns in England
we shall gladly do our power. Of the which answer the squire and the haraulde
were right ioyouse and thought than how they had sped all their matter / but it
was not so as ye shall here after. how be it the duke of Berrey at the
beginning did his deuoyre to have raised the siege to please thereby the king
of England and the duke of Lancastre / who desired that the siege might be
raised before the Roche of Vandoys / and that the little fortress might abide
still to Aymergot Marcell and if he have done any thing to dysplease the
french king or his counsel the king of England would se that there should
be amends made. And the duke of Berrey because he would acquyte him truly to
the english men's desires / such as were in his house / he wrote
incontynente letters well endyghted to the vycount of Meaul^ / and these
letters were red or they were sealed before the english men / who thought
them well ordained. These letters were sent by a notable squire of the duke of
Berreys to the vycount of Meaulx / who received them and opened them. Than the
vycount caused them to be read before such lords as were there with him /
while the messanger was a drinking. for they made him good chere / for the
love of the duke of Berrey / as it was reason. Sirs quod the vycounte / we
shall not be in rest sith the duke of Berrey will bear Aymergot who is the man
of the world that this twelve year has most gr^ued and traueyled the country
of Auuergne. I had thought that the duke had hated him greatly / but it seems
nay / sithe he has ^rpresly commanded that I should depart fro hence. But by
my faith at this time I will not obey this letter / but I will make excuse by
reason of the king and his counsel / who sent me hyder and at my departing
fro Paris he straytly commanded me that for any commandment fro any person
/ and if it were not fro the king kymselfe / that I should not depart fro
hence till I had taken the strong hold of the Roche of Vandoys / and Aymergot
therein / which I will do if I can / and now the duke of Berrey commands
me the contrary / for he charge me incontinent his letters seen / that I
should reyse the syege. By my faith I will not do it. Sir quod they that were
about him / ye speak royally and truly / and we shall abide with you / but we
suppose the occasion that the duke of Berrey writes thus for Aymergot / is
that the englyssh squier and the haraulde has thus desired him to write. we
think also they have brought letters to him fro the king of England / and
fro the duke of Lancastre / as they brought to you this other day. ye say well
quod the vicounte / and I shall know it if I came. Than the duke of Berreys
squier was sent for to have his answer / and the vycount said to him. Pyer / I
will well that ye know that I owe obeysaunce to the duke of Berrey / for he is
so nere a kynne to the king that I dare not dysplease him / but I and my
companyons who have been here these five wekes at this siege to win this
fortress / and to take the thieves that be within it / by the strayte
commandment of the king and his counsel / and we have great marueyle (and
good cause why) how my lord of Berrey does command us and makes request
for his enemies / that we should reyse our siege / by reason of that we say
generally that we shall give ensample to all thieves and robbers / such as will
over ron the realm to do the worst they can. Wherefore Pyer ye shall say to
the duke of Berrey fro us all / that we are and shall be ready inclyned to do
any thing that he commands us to do / but as in this case I am so straytely
enjoined and commanded by the king and his counsel to keep this siege / and
to contynewe it till I have the fortress and them within at my pleasure /
which commandment I dare not brake. and say that surely I will obey to no
commandment / but alonely to the kings whose subget Iame / and by whom I am
sent hither. But sir I require you show me one thing if ye can / who has
made this request for Aymergotte Marcell / who has done so much yuell and
anoyaunce to the country of Auuergne and Lymosyn / and now he is atrapped
like as a traytoure should be / and is nere come to an yuell end / which he
has well deserved / for he has erred and done contrary to his oath. Sir quod
the squire / there came to my lord the duke of Berrey two men of England / an
haraulde and another / who brought letters to my lord fro the king of
England and fro the duke of Lancastre / and they made great request for
Aymergotte. I believe you well quod the vycounte / it was Derby the haraulde and
a squire called Herbery / they brought me this other day like letters /
wherefore I suppose that the king of England and the duke of Lancastre wrote
to the duke of Berrey in this matter. wherefore show to my lord of Berrey that
I desire him to consydre all things well / for all these requests that are
come fro the other side of the sea / are but desires purchased by our enemies /
to the which no lord on this side the sea (if he love the honor and profit
of the realm of France) should enclyne nor condyscende. Sir quod the squire I
shall forget nothing of that ye have showed me / for I love not Aymergot / I
had rather se his punysshmente thanne his delyueraunce. So the Squire departed
and rode to Nonecte where he found the duke of Berrey / and did his message
right sagely / the conclusyon was that the vycounte of Meaulx said / surely he
would not depart fro the siege before ye Roche of Vandoys / without the king
sent him strayte commandment so to do. With this answer the duke of
Berrey was not well content / he had thought that as well his commandment
should have been obeyed / specially in Auuergne.

When the english squire and Derby the haraulde herd of the answer that was
made to the duke of Berrey / and how that the siege was not raised / they were
sorry / and saw well they traueyled in vain / than they said to the duke. Sir
what will ye counsel us to do / shall we thus depart from you without
spedynge of any thing to purpose. The king of England and the duke of
Lancastre have great trust and affyaunce in you / that ye should cause this
siege to be raised / because the Roche of Vandoys is under our signoury. Syrs
quod the duke suffer a season / Aymergot Marcell is in a strong place / he
needs not to fear taking / without a great unhappy / and shortly I purpose
to goo in to France to the king / and thanne I will speak with the King and
his counsel / and for the love of my cosyns of England / I shall do the
best I can to bring the matter to pass / and ye shall go with me and se
how I shall speed. With those words the Squire and the haraulde were
content. Than the fourth day after the duke departed fro Nonecte / and left
there the duchess his wife with a great part of his householde / and so the
duke rode to Ryon in Auuergne / and there he tarried more thanne eight days /
for the earl of Sanxere and the lord Rule / who were gone to Auignon about
the dukes business. and when they were come they departed fro Ryon all
together / and took the way through Burbonoys / and at last came to Bourges
in Berrey / and there the duke tarried two days. Than he rode to Mehun on the
river of yeure to a castle / one of ye fairest houses of the world / as
thanne the duke had newly bylte it / and it had cost him three hundred
thousand frankes. There the duke tarried fyftene days / wherewith the English
messangers were sore troubled / howbeit they could find none other remedy. The
duke as than made little force for the delyueraunce of Aymergot / I shall show
you how and by what means. So it was the earl of Sanxere and the lord of
Rule who were chief of the dukes counsel / with sir Peter Mespyn / they in
fair manner blamed the duke / and said how he had nothing to do to medell
with the business of Aymergot / saying that his life has been always
dyshonourable / and how that he was but a false palyarte / and always
against the crown of France / and had done many vyllayne deeds and roboryes
in Auuergne and in Lymosyn / and how that he was no mete parsone to be
entreated for / wherefore sir quod they / suffer the king and his counsel to
deal with him as they list. These words and such other refrayned the duke
of Berrey to speak any further in the matter. How be it the two english men
did their best to remember the duke. And the duke dissymulynge answered them
curtessy and said. Syrs suffer a season / we shall be shortly at Paris. but
for all his words he tarried still at Mehun more thanne three wekes deuysynge
with his master workman: as keruers and paynters / for therein he had great
fantasy. He had a master workman called master Andrewe / as than one of ye
best work men of the world / an English man borne / but he dwelte in
France and in Haynalte a long season.

Now shall I show you what fortuned of Aymergot Marcell / and of the roche of
Vandoys This Aymergot was a far casting man / and when he saw that yt siege
was not raised / he thought well that the king of Englandes messangers could
not speed of their suit. than he thought on another turn as to depart thens
and to ride night and day to speak with the capitaynes of Piergourt / and
Pyerguyse / and with Guyot of saint Faith / and Ernalton of saint Calombe / and
Ernalton of Rostem / John^ of Morsen / Pier Danchin / and Remonet of Co^payne /
and with diverse other gascoyns and bernoyse in the english garysons / and he
thought that with his fair words he should cause them to assemble together /
and to come in to Auuergne on trust to win great botyes / and so on a
morning or in the night to come and reyse the siege before Vandoys / and to
take there the french men prisoners / which should be worth to them a
hundred thousand frankes / beside other botyes. Thanne he showed his uncle
Guyot du Sall all his purpose / who answered him and said. Sir I se in this
nothing but good / for otherwise we can not be delivered fro these french
men. Well uncle quod Aymergot I shall do this message my self sith ye
counsel me thereto / but I shall desire you of one thing or I depart. What
is that quod he. It is so quod Aymergot / that what so ever skrymysshe that the
french men do make / issue you in no wise out of the gates / nor open not your
barryers / for and ye do / ye may rather lose than win. Sir quod Guyot I
shall be ware enough there of / we shall keep our selfs close here within till
your return / or that we here tidings fro you. Well fair uncle I require
you so to do / for they can not displease us none / otherwise / as for their
assautes or skrymysshes / ye need not fear / so ye keep your selfs close
within. Thus within three days after Aymer got departed fro the Roche of
Vandoys all only aco^panyed with a page / he passed forth without danger of
the french men. his entensyon was to bring thither companyons adventurers to
raise the siege. many of them that were within the house knew nothing of his
departure / for he might depart when he lost without knowledge. Every day there
was skrymysshynge and assautes at the barryers / and within a five or six
days after ye departure of Aymergot / there was a great assaute made by the
french men in three parts. This Guyot du Sall was a good man of arms / and
long time had used the exercisyng thereof / how be it as on that day he
fortuned yuell by reason of a little pride / for he brake the ordinance that
his cosyn Aymergot had set or he departed / for he had charged him that for any
manner of assaute he should not issue out of the barryers. At this assaute there
were three squyers of the french party / two of Auuergne and one of Bretayne /
who were skrimysshing valyauntly upon a pane of a wall nere to the fortress.
These three squyers above all other that day did most valyauntly / they of
Auuergne were called Richard de la Violecte / and Lubinet of Rochfort / and
the breton was named Monadyke / who was taken before in Lymosyn in the castle
of Vanchador / and was parteynynge to sir Willyam Butler. The assaute endured
till night. These three squyers atcheued there great laud and praise / but for
all their traueyle and pain they wan nothing. Than at another assaute the
vicount of Meaulx made a busshment of twelve men of arms and their companyes /
and laid them in an old house without the fortress / and commanded another
sort to go and skrymysshe at the barryers / saying I think surely we shall
se them within issue out / for they are couetouse to win. if they do so / than
withdraw your self lyt^ll and little till they be past our busshment / than
they shall break out / and also return you again / thus they shall be
enclosed and taken or slain. This is the best way that I can se for our
advantage. thus as the vicount had devised and ordained it was done / they
were named that should lie in the busshment / as Loys of Lesglynell / Robert of
Bertencourte / Guylliam de Saulsoy / Pyer du saint Vydall / Guyonet Villeracque
/ Pier of Colle / and John^ Salmage / with other to the nombre of twelve. They
laid themself in an old house without the fortress / and another sort went
and skrimysshed at ye barryers / as Belynot of Rochfort / Richard of Violecte
/ and the Monadyke with other. They were fresshly armed and aparelled / to
thentent that they within should have the more courage to issue out to them /
they were also twelve alonly. When they came to the bartyers they began to
skrymysshe but fayntly / and like such persons as could but little skyll of
feats of arms. Wherefore Guyot du Sall made little force of them / but issued
out and said to his companyons* by saint Marcell we will issue out / for at
the barryers be a sort of young co^panyons / for by that they show / they
know but little of deeds of arms / but we shall teache them to know it / they
shall be all our prisoners they can not escape us. Therewith they opened the
barryers and issued out / first Guyot du Sall / and remembered nochynge the
charge that Aymergot had given him at his departing / for the great desire
that he had to do deeds of arms / and to win somewhat / made him to begin the
skrymysshe. when the french men saw that Guyot du Sall and his company were
come out of their barryers / they were right joyful / than they began to draw
back little and little / and they of the fortress pursewed them / and they
went so far that they passed the busshment / and when they saw their time
they brake out of their busshment / between them and the fortres / cryeng Coucy
the vycount. Thus they of the fortress were enclosed both before and behynd.
when Guyot saw that / he knew well he had done a mysse / and saw well it
was hard for him to escape / than he reculed to get again to his garyson / but
the frenchemen were in his way. Whereunto should I make long process / they
were all taken / not one escaped. They were brought to the vycountes lodginge
before the knights / who had great joy of their taking.

THus by the counsel of the bycount of Meaulx / Guyot du Sall and his company
were atrapped and taken and brought before the lords of France and Auuergne.
When the vycount saw Guyot du Sall / he demanded where Aymergot Marcell was /
and charged him to say the truth / for he thought he had been still in the
fortress. Guyot du Sall answered / how he could not tell where he was / for
he was departed a twelve days paste. Than the lords thought surely that he
was gone to purchase some aid. than the prisoners were commanded a part /
and the vicount demanded of the knights of Auuergne what were best to do
with Guyot du Sall and with his company / saying how he would use himself
acordyng to their counsel. Than sir Willyam Butler answered and said. Sir
quod he / I suppose that Aymergot is gone for socour and to raise by the
companyons in the garysons of Pyergourt and Pierguyse / for he shall find some
always there to come upon us early or late / or we beware of them / whereby
they may do us damage / for any peace or trewce that is taken. This Aymergot
is a subtyle man. sir let us do one thing / show unto Guyot du Sall and his
company / that without they cause they fortress to be rendered in to your
hands / that ye will stryke of all their heedes incontynente / and without
they do thus let it not be spared. This counsel is good quod the vycounte /
for in deed the chief occasyon that we become hyder for is to have this
fortress / and though we can not have at this time Aymergot Marcell / another
season shall fortune right well. Than the vycount and the lord of the tower /
sir Roberte Dolphyn and other came before the fortress as nere as they might
aporche / and thither was brought Guyot du Sall and his company. Than the
vycount spoke and said to Guyot du Sall. Guyot and all other of your company /
know we for truth that incontinent all your heedes shall be stryken of /
without ye yield up the fortress of the Roche of Vandoys / and if ye will
render it up we shall suffer you to go quyte. Now advise ye well what way ye
will take / other life or death. Of those words Guyot and his company were sore
abashed / at last they thought it was best for them to save their lives. Than
Guyot answered and said. Sir I shall do the best I can that the fortress
may be yelden to you. Than he came to the barryer and spoke with them that were
within / who rekened themselfes clean dyscomfyted / seeing they had lost
their two masters / and the best of their company. As soon as Guyot had
spoken with them / and declared what case they stood in / they agreed to yield
up the fortress condicionally / yt they might depart with bag and baggage
as much as they could carry / and to have respyte for a month to withdraw
them whyther they list. All this was granted to them / and a suit
saueconducte made and sealed. Thus the french men had the Roche of Vandoys
delivered / by reason of their good fortune of their last skrimysshe / wherefore
it is comenly said / that all fortunes good and yuell falls often times in
arms / to them that follows war.

When the Roche of Vandois was yielded up to the lords of France and Auuergn^
they of the country were right joyous thereof and the lords held well and
truly the promise that they had made to Guyot du Sall* when they had carried
away as much as they could do / than they departed with good assurance for a
month to go whyder it pleased them. Than the vycount of Meaul^ abandoned the
Roche of Vandoys to the men of the country / who incontynente did raze it
down in such wise that they left no wall hele nor house / nor stone upon
stone / but all was reuersed to the earth. The french men that were they in
the kings service with the vycount / took their leaves of the knights and
squyers of Auuergne / so they departed / and they of Auuergne and Lymosyn went
to their own houses. The vycount of Meaul^ gave leave to part of his company
/ and he went to Rochell and lodged at saint Iohans Dangle / to keep there the
fronter / for in the country there were some pyllers and robbers that ran
sometime in to Xantoigne / when they saw their advantage. In the manner and
form as I have showed you ye fortress of the roche of Vandoys was conquered
/ and rased down whereof all the country was joyful / for than they were in
better surety than they were before. For to say the troth if it had co^tynued
/ it would have done them many displeasurs. Tidings of this deed came to the
knowledge of the duke of Berrey to Cautelon / a place of his own / standing
between Charters and Mount le Herrey / a nine leages fro Paris / he cared
nothing for it / for he was as than but cold to are any grace of the king for
Aymergot. When Derby the haraulde was infourmed by some of the dukes knights
how the Roche of Vandois was taken and beten down / than he said to the
squire that came thither with him. sir ye have lost a hundred frankes that
Aymergot had promised to you. How so quod the squier. Surely quod the harauld
the Roche of Vandoys is given up and rendered / the french men have won it /
therefore let us take our leave of the duke of Berrey / and return in to
England / we have nothing here to do. Well quod the squire sithe it is so I
accord thereto. Than they took their leave of the duke. Than the duke wrote to
the king of England and to the duke of Lancastre / and gave to the haraulde
at his departing.xl. frankes / and to the squire a horse. Thus they departed
and took the next way to Calays / and so in to England. Than tydinges came to
Aymergot Marcell where he was purchasyng of friends to have raised the siege
before the fortress of Vandoys / that it was given up. When he herd thereof /
he demanded how it fortuned. It was showed him how it was by reason of a
skrymysshe / and by the issuyng out of his uncle Guyot du Sall unadvisedly. Ah
that old traitor quod Aymergot / by saint Marcell if I had him here now / I
should sle him mine own hands / he has dishonored me and all my companyons.
At my departing I straytely enjoined him that for no manner of assaute or
skrymysshe made by the frenchmen / he should in no wise open ye barryers / and
he has done the contrary. this damage is not to be recovered / nor I wot not
whether to go / they of Caluset and they of Dousac will keep the peace / and my
companyons be spredde abroad like men dyscomfyted / they dare never assemble
again together / and though I had them together / yet I wot not whyder to
bring them. Thus all thing consydred I am in a hard part / for I have greatly
dyspleased the french king / the duke of Berrey / and the lords of Auuergne /
and all the people of the country / for I have made them war the peace
during / I had trusted to have won / but I am now in a great adventure to
lose / nor I wotte not to whom to resort to are counsel. I would now that I
and my goods / with my wife were in England / there I should be in surety.
but how should I get thither and carry all my stufe with me / I should be robbed
twenty times or I could get to the sea / for all the passages in Poictou /
in Rochell / in France / in Normandy / and in Pycardy are straytely kept / it
will be hard to escape fro taking / and if I be taken I shall be sent to the
French king / and so I shall be lost and all mine. I think the surest way
for me were to draw to Burdeaulr / and little and little to get my good thither
/ and to abyd there till the war renew again / for I have good hoope that
after this treuce / war shall be open again between England and France.
Thus Aymergot Marcell debated the matter in him self / he was heavy and
sorrowful / and wys^e not what way to take / outher to recouerso^e fortress
in Auuergne / or else to go to Bordeaux and to send ^or his wire thider / and
for his goods little and little secretly. if he had done so he had taken
the surest way / But he did contrary / and thereby lost all: life and gods.
Thus ^ortune pays the people when she has set the^ on the highest part of
her whele / for suddenly she reuerseth them to the lowest part / ensample by
this Aymergotte. It was said he was well worth a hundred thousand frakes /
and all was lost on a day Wherefore I may well say that fortune has played
her pagiaunt with him / as she has done with many mo / and shall do. This
Aymergot in all his trybulaci^s remembered him self / how he had a cosyn
germayne in Auuergne / a squire named Turn mine / and determined to go to him
and to show him all his trouble / and to take counsel of him as he devised
so he did. He and his page all only came to ye castle where Turn mine was /
thynkyng to have been there in surety / because of lynage / but it proved
contrary / for this squire was not in the duke of Berryes grace nor favor. When
he saw his cosyn Aymergot in his house / he aduysed to take him prisoner and
to aduertyse the duke of Berey / yt if he would forgive him his displeasure and
yuell will / he would send him Aymergot mercell / to do with him his pleasure.
And as he had devised so he did / for when Aymergot was within his cosyns
Castle and brought to a chamber / than he laid by his sword and changed his
aparyll: than he demanded of the servants and said. Where is my cosyn Turn
mine / as yet I have not seen him? Sir quod they he is in his chamber please it
you to come and se him: with right a good will quod Aymergotte / and the
servants knew right well their masters pleasure. When Aymergot had changed
his aparell and done of a Cote of defense / that he was wo^t vsualy to wear /
and laid away his sword. Than he said. Sirs / let us go / I would se my
cosyn Turn mine / it is long sith I saw him. they brought him straight to
Turn mine / and when he came to him Aymergot did salute him / as he that
thought none yuell. Than Turn mine answered and said. How is it
Aymergotte* Who sent for you to come hyder? ye would dishonor me / wherefore I
take and arest you as my prisoner: otherwise I should not acquyte my self
truly to the crown of France / nor to my lord the duke of Berrey / for ye
are a false traitor. ye have broken the truce whereto ye must answer. And for
your cause my lord of Berrey hates me deedly / But now I shall make my peace
by you / for I shall deliver you to him / outher quycke or deed: with the
which words Aymergotte was sore aba^shed / and said. How so sir? I am your
cosyn. Is this for certaynte ye show me / or do you speak it to a^saye me. I
am come hyder on the great trust that I have in you / to show you my business
/ and you to make me such cruel chere and to give me so hard word / I have
great marueyle that of. I can not tell quod Turn mine wha^ ye will say / but
this that I have said I shall fulfill / and so laid hades on him. And his
servants knowing their masters pleasure / took Aymergot without any de^^^e
making / for he was without weapen or arm^r^ and also enclosed in the castle.
For any words that he could say / there he was taken and yrons put upon
his legs and laid in a tower / and sure kepars about him.

When this was done he caused the castle gate to be shytte / and took the
keys him self. And commanded all his servants on pain of their lives /
none of them to be so hardy to go to the gate without he sent them thither. His
comaandement was uphold. Than he wrote letts at his pleasure / dyrected to the
duke of Berrey: Certifyeng him how he had Aymergot Marcell in prisone / and
that ^^he he would perdone him his yuell will / he would deliver Aymergot in to
his hanoes. When this letter was written and sealed / he commanded one of his
servants / such as he trusted / to go in to France to the duke of Berrey /
and to deliver him his letter / and to reco^mende him lowly to him / and not to
return with out an answer. The varlet took the letter / and mounted on a
good horse and so deperted / and rode so long that he came to Paris / where
the duke of Berey was / and there delivered to him his masters letter. The
duke took ye letter and reed it and smyled there at / and said to such
knights as were about him. s^rs / will ye here new tidings? Aymergot marcell
is taken prisoner his own cosyn germayne Turn mine has taken him: ye
knights answered and said. sir / it is good tidings for the country of
Auuergne and of Lymosyn / for they have had of him a long season an yuell
neighbor. He has done so much yuell / that if it please you he were worthy
to peyse the gybet: he ought to have none other ransom nor pardon. I can not
say quod the duke what the king and his counsel will say thereto / I will
speak with them therein. It was not long after but that the duke of Berrey took
a barge on the river of Seyne and so came to the castle of Lour where the king
and his counsel was: he showed there these news / he caused the letter that
Turn mine had sent him to be reed / of the which tidings every man was
joyful / and the lords said. it is well seen that such manner of robbers and
pillars can never come to a good end. Than the duke of Berey was desired to
send for him by the seneschall of Auuergne / and to be brought to Paris / and
to be put in ye castle of saint Antonies. Furthermore it was ordained / that
Turn mine / for the good service he had done to the crown of France /
that all displeasures should be clean for given him: and thereupon letters
patentes were made and sent to him by his servant whereof he was well content /
and trusted on those letters. Than with in a short space after / the
seneschall of Auergne by a commission fro the duke of Berrey came to the
castle of Turn mine / and there Aymergot Marcell was delivered to him /
whereof Aymergotte was sore abashed / when he saw him self in the company of
his enemies. Whereto should I make long process / the seneshall carried him
with men of arms a long through the country / and passed the ryuers of Seyne
and Marewe / by the bridge of Charenton / and so fro thens to the castle of
saint Antonies. There the Vicount Darchy was charged with him who as than^e was
captain of that castle. He kept him not long but yt he was delivered to the
provost of the Chatelet of Paris. And true it was / Aymergot offered for his
ransom threscore thousand frankes / but it would not be taken / He was
answered the king was rich enough. After that he was sent to the Chatelette /
he was not long kept there but that he was iuged to dye shamefully like a
traitor to the Crown of France. And so on a day he was carried in a chariot
to a place called the Halles / and there set on the pyllary. Than all his
trespasses were reed before him / and by him was sir Wylliam of Trune who spoke
much to him. It was thought / yt it was to know the state of certain
capitayns in Auuergne / and whether they were consentyng to his deeds or not.
The lords knew well / but I could never have knowledge thereof. Thus he was
executed. His heed stryken of and his body quartred / and the quarters set at
every gate of Paris. To this end came Aymergotte Marcell. As of his wife and
of his goods / I knew not what beca^e further of them.

How the christen lords and the geno ways being in the ysle of Conymbres at
ancre / departed thens to go and lay siege to the strong city of Aufryke in
Barbary / and how they maynteyned the siege. Cap. C.lxxi.
WHere as I have spoken at length of the life of Aymergot Mercell / it was to
furnysshe this history. for the condycions both of yuell and good / ought to
be always treated in a hystory / and specially when it touches any great
feate / for ensample of other / and to give matter and occasyon to do well: For
if Aymergotte had led his life in good virtues / he had been a man of great
valor / and because he did the contrary he came to an yuell end. Now let us
leave spekyng of him / and let us return to the high enterprice that the
Christen knights of France and other nacyous did in that season in the realm
of Aufryke / and I will begin there as I left. The said lords assembled in
the ysle of Conymbres. after they had passed the tempests and paryls in the
Goulfe of Lion: there they tarried each for other / for there were in the city
of Aufryke a.xxx. thousand. In this ysle of Conymbres they were a nine days
and refresshed them: and there the patrons of the galees said to the lords.
Sirs / we be in the land next aprochyng to the marchesse of Aufryke / whider
by the grace of god ye are purposed to go and lay liege. Wherefore it is
behouable to take co^sayle each of other / how we may enter in to the haven /
and to take land To save our self it is best we senoe formast our little
ships / called Brigandyns / and let us tarry in the mouth of the hauyn / ye
first day that we aproche and all the night after / and the next morning to
take land / by the grace of god at our leysar / and than lodge our selfs as
nere the city as we may / without the shot of their artyllary / and let us
set our crosbowes genouois in order / who shall be ready to defend all
scirmysshes. And we suppose well that when we shall take ladynge / ye have here
i^ your co^panyes many young squyers / who to enhau^ce their honors will
require to have the order of knighthode. In structe them wisely and swetely /
how they shall mentayne themselfes. And my lords / know for truth / that
all we see men shall acquyte us unto you well and truly / and always show
you by what manner of order / we shall most grieve our enemies. And we shall
take pain and study how the city of Aufryke may be won / for often times they
have done us great do^mage. For on that cost it is the chief key of Barbary /
and of the realms that follows. First the realm of Aufrike / of Mallorques /
and of Bougy. And if god of his grace will consent that we may wyn this city
of Aufrike / all the Sarazyns will trymble to the realm of Liby and Sury / so
that all the world shall speak thereof. And by the aid of other christen
realms and ysles marchyng nere to Aufrike / we shall always be refreshed with
vitayls and new men / for this is a common vo^age / For every man will desire
daily to do deeds of arms / and specially on gods enemies: and thus in the
conclusion of their process the patrons said. lords / we say not this by no
presu^pcion / nor by manner as to teache you what ye should do. but this that we
have said is all only for love and by humilyte / for ye be all noble men sage
and valyant / and can better order every thing than we can deuyse and speak.
Than the lord of Coucy said. sirs / your good counsel and advise ought
greatly to content us / for we se no thing therein but good. And sirs / be ye
sure that we shall do nothing without your counsel / for ye have brought us
hyder to do deeds of arms.

THus in the presence of the duke of Burbone / the lords and other cou^sayled
toguyder in the ysle of Conymbres / how they might aproche ye strong town of
Aufryke. When every thing was well aduysed and set in good order by the
admyrall and patrons of the galees / and that wind and wether served them /
every lord entered in to his galee among their own men having great desire to
encou^tre with their enemies the sarazyns. Than the tru^pettes blewe up at
their departing. It was great pleasure to behold their ores / how they rowed
abroad in the sea / which was peasable / calm and fair / so that in manner
the sea showed her self that she had great desire yt the christen men should
come before the strong town of Aufryke. The christen navy was goodly to
regard and well ordered / and it was great beauty to se the baners and penons
of silk / with the arms and badges of ye lords and other wauyng with the
wind / and shynyng against the son^e. And within an hour of noone / the
christen men perceived ye high towers of the town of Aufrike / and the farther
they sailed the nerer it showed to their syghtes / wherefore every man reioysed
and good cause why / seeing all they desired to come thither. They thought tha^
in a manner their pains released and their voyage accomplysshed. Thus as they
aproched to thentre of the realm of Aufryke / they co^muned and devised among
themself. and in like manner the sarazyns that were within the town of Aufryke
spoke and devised and were sore abashed / when they saw their enemies aproche
with such a nombre of sails and said / that surely they were lykely to be
besieged / How be it they thought their town so strong with towers and walls
/ and with artyllary / that therewith they reconforted and took courage. And to
give warnyng to the country (as soon as they saw their enemies on the Sea /
on the high towers) They sowned Tymbres and tabours / according to their
usage / in such wise / that the men abroad in the country drew toguyder.
Such men of Barbary as had been sent thither by the king of Aufryke / and by
the king of Thunes and Bougy. When they knew of the Christen men's coming
/ by reason of the noise of the Tymbres and tabours / to thentent that they
should not enter to far in to their countries. Every man took head to his
charge and sent certain of their capitayns to the Sea side / to se the
aprochyng of ye Christen men / and to behold their dealyng that night. Also
they provided to defend the towers and gates about the hauyn of Aufryke / to
the intent that by their negligence the town of Aufryke should take no do^mage
/ which town was so strong / that it was not lykely to take great hurt
without long siege. And I Johan Froyssart auctour of this cronycle / because I
was never in Aufryke / and because I might truly write the manner and fascion
of this enterprice. Always I desired such knights and squyers as had been at
ye same voyage / to inform me of every thing. And because I had been
oftentimes in my days at Calays / I demanded also of such there as had been
at the said voyage. And it was showed me of a surety / that the sarazyns
among them selfs said / how the Christen men that were there were expert
and subtyle men of arms. Whereupon an ancient sarazyn said to all his company.
Sirs / all things co^sydred / it is best that the Christen men at the
beginning se not our strength and puissaunce / nor also we have not men
suffycie^t to fight with them / but daily men will come to us. Wherefore I
think it best to suf^re the^ to take land: they have no horses to over ron
the country: they will not sprede abroad / but keep together for fear of us.
The town is strong enough and well provided / we need not fear any
assautes. The air is hot and will be hotter. They are lodged in the son and
we in the shadow: and they shall daily wast their vitaylles / and shall be
with^ute hope to recover any new / and they lie here any long season. And we
shall have ple^tie for we be in our own country. and they shall ofte^tymes be
awaked and scrimysshed withal / to their do^mage and to our advantage. Let
us not fight with them / for other wise they can not disconfyte us. They have
not ben used with the air of this country / which is contrary to their
nature. I think this the best way.

TO the saying of this ancient knight sarazyn all other agreed. Than^e it was
commanded on pain of death that no man should go to the sea side to
scrymysshe with the Christen men without they were commanded / but to keep
them self close in their lodgings / and suffer the christen men to take
land. This determynacion was up hold none durst break it. And they sent a
certain of their archers in to the town of Aufryke / to aid to defend it.
The Sarazyns showed theme selfs nothing / as though there had been no men in
the country. The Christen men lodged all that night in the mouth of the hauyn
of Aufryke / and the next morning the wether was fair and clear / and the
air in good temper / and the son rose / that it was pleasure to behold.
Than^e the Christen men began to stir / and made the^ ready / having great
desire to approach the town of Aufryke and to take land. Than trumpettes and
claryons began to sown in the Gallees and vessels / and made great noise:
and about nine of the clock when the christen men had taken a little refress
hynge with drink: than were they reioysed and lighted. And according as they
had appointed before / they sent in first their light vessels called
Brigandyns / well furnisshed with artyllary. They entered in to the hauyn / and
after them came the armed Galees / and the other ships of the flete in good
order. and tournyng toward the land by the sea side / there was a strong
castle with high towers / and specially one tower which defended the sea
side / and the land also. And in this tower was a bricoll or an engyn which
was not ydell / but still did cast great stones among the Christen men's
ships. In like wise in every tower of the town against the Sea side / there
were engyns to cast stones. the sarazyns had well provided for their town for
they looked ever long before whane they should be besieged. When the Christen
men entered in to the haven of Aufryke to take land / it was a plesaunt sight
to behold their order / and to here the claryons and trumpettes sound so
high and clear / diverse knights and valiant men of the realm of France /
sprede abroad that day their baners / with diverse other new made knights. The
lord Johan of Lignye was there first made knight. He was of the country of
Chauny. He was made by the hands of a cosyn of his named sir Henry Dantoygne /
and there he sprede abroad first his baner: The field gold / a bend of
goules. And in his company was his cosyn germayne the lord of Hauret in
Chauny. Thus the lords knights and squyers with great desire auaunced them /
and took land and lodged on the land of their enemies in the sight of the
false sarazyns. on a wednisdaye in the euenyng of Mary Magdaleyne / in the year
of our lord god a thousand three hundred and fourscore. And as they took land
they were lodged by their marshalles. The sarazyns that were within ye town
praised much the christen me^nes order: and because that the great Galees
could not aproche nere to the land / the men issued out in bottes / and took
land and followed the baner of our lady.

THe Sarazins that were within the town / and such as were abroad in the
country / suffered the Christen men pesably to take land / for they saw well
it should not be for their advantage to have fought with them at their
landyng. The duke of Burbone who was as chief of the christen army there / was
lodged in the mids of his company right honorably / his baner displayed
poudred full of Flower du Lyces / with an image of our Lady in the mids / and
a scochynne with the arms of Burbone under the fete of the image. First on
the right hand of the duke / there was lodged his brother sir Guylliam of
Tremoyle with his penon / and the lord of Bordenay with his baner / and sir
Helyon of Lygnacke with his penon / the lord of Tourse with a penon And than
the Henowers with the standerde of the lord Wyllyam of Heynaulte / as than
earl of Ostrenaunt / eldest son to the duke Aubert of Bauyere / earl of
Heynaulte. Of Hollande and of zelande / the deuyse in ye standerde was a Hearse
gold / standing on a bell goules. There was the lord of Haureth with his baner
/ the lord of Ligny with his baner and than sir Philyppe Dartoys earl of Ewe
with baner / the lord of Mateselon with baner / the lord of Calam with penon
/ the Seneschall of Ewe with penon / the lord of Lynyers with baner / the
lord of Thune with baner / the lord of Ameuall with baner / sir Water of
Champenon with penon / sir John of the Castle Morant with baner / the marshall
of Sanxeres brother with penon / the lord of Coucy with baner / best appointed
next the duke of Burbone / sir Stephyne of Sanxere with penon. Than the
French kings penon with his deuyce / and thereby was sir Johan of Barroys /
with the penon of his arms. Than sir Guylliam Morles with baner / and the
lord of Lo^gueuall with penon / sir Johan of Roye with baner / the lord of
Bourse with penon / the Vycount Dausney with baner / the lord admyrall with
baner / called Johan of Vyen. Now here after follows they on the dukes lift
hand.

ON the lift hand of Loyes duke of Burbone were lodged as follows. First the
lord of Ausemont of Bauyere / and sir Johan of Beauforde bastard son to the
duke of Lancastre / with his baner displayed / sir Johan Butler English with
a penon / sir Johan of Crama with a baner / the Souldyche of Lestrade with
penon sir Johan Harcourt with baner / and ye lord Beraulte earl of Cleremount
/ and the Dolphin of Auuergne with baner / and sir Hugh Dolphyn his brother
with penon / the lord of Bertencourt with penon / the lord Pyer Buffyer with
baner / the lord of saint Semere with baner / the lord of Lauuart marshall of
the host with baner / the lord Bergue of Beausse with penon / the lord of
Louuy with baner / sir Gerarde of Lymo^yn his brother with penon / the lord of
saint Germayne with baner / And than the penon and sta^derde with the deuyce of
the duke of Burgoyn / sir Philyppe of Bar with baner / sir Geffray of Charney
with baner / sir Loyes of Poicters with penon / sir Robert of Calabre with
penon / the vycount of Ses with baner / the lord Montague with baner / the
lord of Vile Neufe with penon / sir Wyllyam of Molyne with penon / the lord
of Lo^gny with penon / sir Angorget Damboyse with penon / sir Aleyne of
Cha^payne with penon: all these baners and penons were set in the front
before ye town of Aufryke / and beside that a great nombre of other knights
and squyers right valiant men and ^fhighe courage / were lodged abroad in the
field / I cannat name them all / also it would be to long a writing. There were
a fourtene thousand all gentylmen. It was a company to do a great feate / and
to sustain a great batyle / if the sarazyns had come forth to have given them
battle / which they did not / for as on yt day they showed no manner of
defense / but castyng out of their towers great stones.

When the Christen men were lodged as well as they might / and refresshed them
selfs with such as they had brought with them / for they might not ryn abroad
in the country to gather bows of trees to make with all their lodgings / ^or
it had been to their damage if they had adventured themself abroad. The lords
had tents and pauilio^s that they had brought with them fro Geane. Thus they
lodged in good order. the crosbowes of the genouoys were lodged on the wings /
and closed in the lords. They occupied a great space of ground for they were
a great nombre / all their prouisyons were in the galees / and all the day the
maryners conveyed their stuff to ^ande by bottes. And when the christen ysles
adioynyng / as Naples^ Cicyll / and also the main lands / as Puylle and
Calabre. When they knew how the Christen men had besieged the strong castle
of Aufryke / they did what they could to vitayle the christen army. some to
have aduau^tage thereby / and some for love and affection that they had to the
genouoys / fro the ysle of Caude came to them the good malueysies in great
plenty / without which conforte they could not long have endured / for they
were a great nombre / and good drinkers and good caters / How be it their
prouis^ons came not always to the^ in like manner / for sometime they had
plenty and some season they wanted. Now I shall somewhat speak of the sarazyns
as well as I have done of the christen men / as it is reason to conclude all
things.

True it was that they of Aufrike and of Barbary knew long before how the
genowayes had thretned them / and they looked for none other thing / but the
same year to be besieged / as they were in deed. They had made prouisyon to
resyst against it. and when the tidings were sprede abroad in the country
how that the christenmen were come to Aufryke they were in dout / for he is
not wise that fears not his enemies though they be never so few. How be
it the sarazyns reputed the christen men right valyant and good men of war /
wherefore they greatly douted them: and to the intent to resyst and to defend
the fronters of their countries / they assembled toguyder of diverse parties /
as they of the land and seignorie of Aufrike and of the realm of Maroche /
and of ye realm of Bougye / the best men of war in all those countries / and
such as leest feared death. Thus they came and lodged on the sands against
the christen men / and they had behind them an high wode / to thentent that
they should receive on that side no do^mage by means of busshmentes or
scrimysshes. These sarazins lodged them selfs right sagely and surely they
were of men of war a.xxx. thousand good archers / and ten thousand horsemen
and mo. How be it the Christen men could never know surely what nombre they
were for they supposed they had a greater nombre lodged in the woods / which
might right well be. For they were in their own country and might go and come
in to their host at all hours without paryll or dommage at their own
liberty. They were often times refresshed with new vitayls brought to them on
summers and camelles. And the second day that the English men had been a
land / in the morning at the break of the day / and that the same night the
lord Henry Dautoygne had kept the watch with two hundred men of arms and a
thousand crosbowes genowayes. The sarazyns came to awake and to scrimysshe
with them / which endured the space of tow hours. There were many deeds of
arms atchyued / but ye sarazins would not join to fight hand to hand / but
they scrimysshed with castyng of darts and shotynge / and would not folysshely
adventure themselves / but wisely and sagely reculed. the christen host than
apparelled them to go to the scrimysshe / and some of the great lords of
France came thither to se the deem anour of the sarazyns / thereby to know a
n^ther time their manner in skrymysshynge. Thus the sarazyns drew to their
lodging and the christian men to theirs. And during the siege the christian men
were never in surety nor rest / for outher evening or morning the sarazyns
would awake them and skrymysshe. Among the sarazyns there was a young knight
called Agadingor Dolyferne / he was always well mounted on a ready and a light
horse / it seemed when the horse ran / that he did fly in the air. The
knight seemed to be a good man of arms by his deeds / he bare always of usage
three fedred darts / and right well he could handle them / and acordynge to
their custom he was clean armed with a long white to well about his heed. His
aparell was black / and his own color brown / and a good horseman. The
christian men said they thought he did such deeds for the love of some young
lady of his country. And true it was that he loved entyrely the king of
Thunes daughter / named the lady Azala / she was enherytour to the realm of
Thunes / after ye discease of the king her father. This Agadingor was son to
the duke of Olyferne. I can not tell if they were married together after or not
/ but it was showed me that this knight for love of the said lady during the
siege did many feats of arms. The knights of Faunce would feign have taken
him / but they could never atrape nor enclose him / his horse was so swyft and
so ready to his hand yt always he skaped.

THe christian men would gladly have taken some sarazyn to the entente to have
known the state of the town and country / but for all their skrymysshynge
they could never get none. The sarasyns took good head to themself / and
did pauesse themself against the crosebowes genouoys / they werenat so well
armed as the christian men it was not their usage / nor they had no armorers nor
metal to forge harness withal / for most comenly they lack iron and steel
/ they be ever armed in lether / and bear targettes about their necks
covered and made of Cure boley of Capadoce / no wepen can perce it and the
lether be not hot. so that when they come nere to their enemies they cast
their darts all at ones. And when the genouoys do shote at them / than they
couche them self low and cover them with their targes / and when the shot
is paste / than they cast again their fedred darts. Thus the space of nine
wekes during the siege they often times skrymysshed / so that diverse were
hurt on both parties / and specially such as lightly without a uysement
adventured them self. thus the christian men took good head to themself / and
so did the sarazyns on their part / and the lords of France and such other
as were com^ thither to their aid / gladly regarded the dealing of the
sarazyns. To say the truth to lords of astate and to great men / all
newelties are dylectable. And if the christian men had pleasure to behold them
/ the sarazyns had as great pleasure to regard the manner of the christian men /
among them there were young lusty knights / who had great pleasure to behold
the armure baners / standards / and penons / with richesse and nobleness that
was among the christian men / and at night when they were at their lodgings
they spoke and devised. But as it was showed me there was one thing among
them to be marueyled at / I shall show you what.

THe sarazyns within the town of Aufryke had great marueyle by what tytell or
instaunce yt the christian men came thither so strongly to make them war. It was
showed me how they took advise among them how to know the troth thereof /
and determined to send to the christian men to know their minds / and so took
a truchman that could speak Italyan / and commanded him to go to the christian
host / and to demand of them in what title and instaunce they are come to
make us war / and why they be come so strongly in to the empire of Barbary /
and in to the land of Auffryke / and say how we have in nothing trespased
them. of a troth before this time there has been war between us and the
genouoys / but as for that war by reason ought not to touch the christian men
of far countries of. as for the genouoys are our neighbors / they take of us
and we of them / we have been auncyente enemies and shall be / except when
treuce is between us. with this message the trucheman departed / and rode to
the christian army / and met first with a genoway / and showed him how he was
a messanger sent fro ye sarazyns to speak with some lord of France. The
genoway had to name Anthony Marthy / he was a centuryon of the crosbowes / he
brought this messanger to the duke of Burbon and to the lord of Coucy / who
gladly herd him speak / and the words that he spoke in his own langage the
centuryon genoway expowned them in french. When this messanger had declared
his message / he desired to have an anuswere. The lords of France said he
should have / but first they would take advise in the matter. Than a.xii. of the
greatest lords drew together to counsel in the duke of Burbons tent / and
concluded / and so sent for the messanger / and the genouoy made him his
answer in all their names. Saying how the title and quarrel that they made
war in was / because the son of god called Jesus christ and true profit /
by their line and generacyon was put to death and crucyfyed / and because they
had judged their god to death without tytell or reason / therefore they would
have a mendes / and punysshe that trespace and false judgment that they of
their law had made / and also because they believed not in the holy baptyme /
and are ever contrary to their faith and law. nor also because they believed
not in the virgyn Mary m^ther to Ihesu Christ. F^r these causes and other they
said they took the sarazyns and all their sect for their enemies / and said
how they would revenge the dispytes that they had done and daily do to their
god and christian faith. With this answer the treuchman returned without
parell or damage / and showed to his masters all as ye have herd. At this
answer the sarazyns did nothing but laugh / and said how that answer was
nothing reasonable / for it was the jews that put Christ to death / and not
they. Thus the siege still endured every party making good watch.

Anon after the sarazyns took counsel together / and determined that a seven
or eight days together they should suffer the christian men in rest / and not
to make any manner of skrymysshe with them / and than suddenly on a night about
the hour of mydnyght to set on the host / trusting thereby to do a great
feate. As they ordained so they did / and an eight days together they made no
skrymysshe / and on the.ix. day about mydnight they secretly armed them with
such armure as they were accustomed to / and so came close together without any
noise nere to the lodgings of the christian men / and had enterprysed to have
done a great feate / and to have entered / not on that side that their watch
was on / but on the other part of the field / where there was no watch kept.
They had come to their ententes / and god properly had not ben against them /
in showing of apparante miracles / I shall show you how.

As the sarazyns aproched they saw suddenly before them a great company of
ladies and damsels / all in white color / and one in especyall who in beauty
without comparison exceded all the other / and there was borne before her a
baner all of white and reed within. with this sight the sarazyns were so
abashed that they lacked spyrite and force to go any further and so stood
still / and the ladies before them. Also it was showed me that the Genouoys had
a great dog in their company that they brought with them / but they knew
not fro whence he came / there was none that challenged the dog to be his /
which dog did them great service / for the sarazyns could never come so
pryuely to skrymysshe / but the dog would bay and make such brewte that he
would not rest till such as were a sleep were awaked / every man knew when they
herd the dog baye / that the sarazyns were coming to skrymysshe with them /
whereby ever they aparelled them self to resyst them. The genouoys called the
dog our ladies dog. The same season that the sarazyns stood still in a
trance / and the ladies before them this dog was not ydell / but he made
great brute and ran bayeng first to the stand watch / the lord of Coucy and
sir Henry Dantoigne kept the watch that night. When every man herd this dog
make such brute they rose and armed them ready / for they knew well that the
sarazyns did aproche to awake them. and true it was that the vyrgyn Mary and
her company was before them / to defend the christian men fro all parelles / so
that they took that night no manner of damage / for the sarazyns durst not
aproche / but returned to their lodgings. And after that the christian men took
better head to their watch.

THe sarazyns knights and squyers such as were in ye town of Aufryke and
specially such as had seen these ladies / were so abashed that they wyste not
what to think. and the christian knights and squyers that lay at the siege /
studied day and night / how they might win the town / and they within studied
again how to defend their town. The season was hot and dry / for the
son was in his most strength / as in the month of August / and the marches
of Aufryke are right hoote / by reason of the sand / and also they be nerer to
the son than we be. And the wynes that the christian men had came fro Pulle and
Calabre / and they be hot and dry / far fro the nature of the french wynes
/ whereby many fell in to hoote fevers. And to consydre acordynge to reason / I
can not tell how the french men and other of low countries could endure the
pain of the hot and gross air that they found there / without refresshynge
of good / sweet / and fresshe water / which they lacked there. yet they made
fountaynes and wells in the sand / which did them great pleasure / for
there they found^ fressh water / how be it often times the water was sore
chafed by reason of the heat. And also often times they had great defaute of
vytaylles / and some season they had enough coming fro Cicyll / and fro other
isles adioynynge. Such as werehole comforted them that were dysseased / and
such as had vytayles / departed with them that lacked / other wise they
could not have endured. they dalte each with other like brethren and friends.
The lord of Coucy specially had the chyefe resort of gentlemen / he could
behave him self swetely among them / much better than the duke of Burbone /
for the duke was some what of an high courage / proud and presumptuous / nor
spoke not so swetely nor so humbly to knights / squyers / and strangers / as
the lord of Coucy did. Most comenly the duke of Burbone would sytte all day
without his tente with his legs acrosse / and who so ever would speak with him
/ it behooved him to have a procurer / and to make great reverence. He consydred
not the state of poor men so well as the lord coucy did / wherefore he was
more in the grace and love of the people thanne the duke of Burbon was. And as
it was showed ^e by diverse knights and squyers strangers / that in their
opynyons if the lord Coucy had been soueraygne capytayne alone / they had sped
otherwise than they did / for by reason of the pride of the duke of Burbon /
many feats and enterprises were left undone. It was the opinion of many that
he kept him self sure enough fro taking.

THis siege enduringe before the town of Aufryke / which contynewed a.lx.
days and one / there was many skrymysshes made on both parties ^abrode and at
the barryers of the town. It was needful for them within to make good defense
/ for against them was the flower of chyualry and squyry. The knights
adventurers said one to another. If we may get this town with assaute or
otherwise / than we may refresshe our selfs in it all the winter / and at
somer some great army of christian men will come byther / for there by we and
they shall have a goodly enter into the realms of Barbary / Aufryke / and
Thunes. than other did say / would to god it were so / for thanne such as
should be lodged here should lie honorably / for daily they should be ready to
do deeds of arms. They that were within the town doubted greatly the matter /
wherefore they took great pain to defend them selfs. The great heat and
brinnynge of the son did put the christian men to great pain and traueyle /
for when they were in harness by reason of the heat / it burnt them within
their armure. Marueyle it was that any skaped the death / by reason of the
heat / for about the mids of August the air was sore corrupted. Beside that
there fell another marvelous incydente / which if it had long endured / they
had been all deed without stroke So it was that by reason of the great heat and
corrupcyon of the air / there fell among them such a sort of great flies /
that they covered all the host / for no man wyste how to defend him self /
and every day a weke together they increased / whereof every man was abashed /
how be it by the grace of god and the vyrgyn Mary / to whom every man auowed
them self / on a day did send a remedy. There fell such an hayle and
lyghtenyng fro heaven that it slew all the said flies / And by reason of this
hayle / the air was brought in to a good temperatenesse / whereby ye knights
and squyers were in a better astate than they were before.

WHo so ever had been in the case that these christian men were in at yt time /
it must have behooved them to take every thing in gree / they could not have
had every thing with wysshynge / nor at their demand. When any fell sick it
behooved them to be well kept / or else they should have dyed / but they were
come thither with so good wylles and affection / that they purposed honorably
to accomplysshe their voyage / which mind greatly supported the^ to endure
pain and traueyle. All things that was mete for their complexions they wanted
/ for nothing came to them out of the realm of France / tidings nor other.
nor in France they knew no more of them. sometime there came to the army fro
the city of Barcelone in the realm of Aragon in a galey prouysion / wherein
was mo orenges and pomegarnettes than any other thing. These fruits yet
refresshed greatly the appetytes of the christian men / but when so ever any
galey came to them / it returned not again / what for doubt of the
encou^tryng of the sarazyns on the sea / as for to abide there to se the
conclusyon of the siege. The young king of Cicyll often times sent to the
host vytaylles / for he was the nerte christian prince adioynynge. If the
sarazyns had been of that strength to have stopped the passage of the sea fro
them / and to have kept fro them such vytayls and prouysions as came to the
army / fro Pule / Calabre / Naples / and Cicyll / the christian men had been deed
without any stroke stryking / but they made no war but by land / nor also
they be not of such puyssaunce on the sea / another in gales nor in other
vessels / as the genouoys and venysians be. For if the sarazyns be on the sea
it is but by stelthe / for they dare not abide the christian men / without they
have far the aduau^tage. A galey with christian men well armed / will
discomfyte four galees of sarazyns. True it is the turks are of greater force
and better men of arms / outher by land or by see / than any other sect of
the myscreantes contrary to our believe / but they dwell far of fro the land
of Aufryke / the affrikans can not be aided by the^. The turks had certain
knowledge how the town of Aufryke was besyeged by the christian men / they
wysshed them often times there.

THe christian men studied how to do damage to the sarazyns / and in like wise
so did the sarazyns against the christen men / studied how to deliver their
country of them. and on a day Agadingor Doliferne / Madefer de Thunes / Belyns
Madages / and Brahadyn of Bougy with diverse other sarazyns / devised among
them selfs and said. Behold here the christian men our enemies / who lie here
before our faces in our own country / and yet we can not discomfyte them /
and they are but a handefull of men / as to the regard of us / how be it we
think verily they have some great confort of some valiant men out of their
own countries / for at no manner of skrymyssh that we can make / and for all
that ever we can do / we can take never a prisoner / for if we might take one
or two of their valyau^t men / it should be greatly to our honor / and by them
to know their demeanor and puyssaunce / and what they purpose to do. Syrs
quod Agadingor / let se what counsel is best in this case / as for me I am
one of the youngest / yet I speak first. we are content therewith quod all the
other / say what ye will. Syrs quod he I desire greatly to do some deed of
arms with some christian man / and I think verily if I were matched with one to
dyscomfyte him in plain battle. And syrs / if ye will do so that we might
find a.xx. or.xxx. valiant men a monge us / I shall cause and I can the
christian men to set forth as many: our quarrel is good / for they have no
cause of reason to make war against us. and I think what by reason of our
just quarrel and the good courage that we be of shall give us victory. Than
Madyfer of Thunes answered and said. Sir in your words is nothing but honor
/ to morrow if ye will ride and be in the former front of the battle with a
trucheman with you / and make some token that ye would speak with some christian
man / and than do you so much as to offer the battle of.x. of yours against
ten of theirs / than shall ye here and se what they will answer / and yet
how so ever they answer we may be aduysed what we will do / at least the
christian men shall repute us the more valiant. They all agreed to that
apoyntmente / and so passed that night. the next morning they rode forth to
skrymysshe with their enemies / and Agadingor formest / mounted on his good
horse / and his trucheman with him. The day was clear and bright / and a
little before the son rysynge / the sarazyns set them self in order of
battle. The same night sir Willyam of Tremoyle had kept the watch on ye
christian part / and with him sir Guy his brother. Than the sarazins apered
before the christian men within a three crosbowe shot / and Agadingor had his
truchman by him / he rode on before all his company / and made token to speak
with some christian man / on the one wynge of the field. And a gentle squire
called Affrenall / seeing the sarazyn and the signs that he made / rode fro his
company and said. Syrs stand still here / and I will go and speak with yo^der
sarazyn / and torn again to you / he has a truchman with him / he comes to
speak with some man. this squier came to ye sarazyn / who tarried for him. Than
the truchman said / ye christian man. are a noble man and a man of arms / and
ready to give answer to our demand? I am such a one quod Affrenall / say
what it pleace you / ye shall be hard and received. Than quod the trucheman /
sir behold here a gentleman and a noble man of ours / who demands the
battle to fight with you hand to hand / and if ye will have mo / we shall
find to the nombre of six of ours ready to fight with.vi. of yours / and the
quarrel of our men shall be this. They say and will iustifye that our faith is
better and more of valor than yours / for our faith and law has been written
sith the beginning of the world / and as for your law was found out by one
man / whom the jews hanged on a cross. Ahsyr quod Affrenall / speak no
further of that matter / it appertaygneth not to the to speak or dispute our
faith and law. but say to this sarazyn / that he swear by his faith and believe
to afferme the battle / and let him bring to the nombre of.x. all gentlemen
of name and arms / and within this three hours I shall bring as many to try
the matter. The truthman resyted those words to the sarazyn / who be semyng had
great joy to accept and afferme the battle. Thus they took this enterprise
between them twain and departed / and returned to their own companyes.
tydinges hereof came to sir Guy of Tremoyle and to sir Willyam his brother / and
when they met with Affrenall they demanded fro whence he came / and what he
had done with the sarazyn. Than Affrenall showed him all the hole matter / and
how that he had taken the battle / whereof the said two knights were joyful
and said. Affrenall speak to other / for we two shall be of the nombre of the
ten. sir quod Affrenall / as god will so be it / I trust I shall find ynowe
that would be glad to fight with the sarazyns. Anon after Affrenall met with
the lord of Thune / and showed him the adventure / and demanded if he would
be one of the company. The lord of Thune would not refuse but gladlye granted
to be one of their company. For every one that Affrenall did get / he might
have gotten a.C. if he had would. Sir Boucyquant the younger / sir Helyons of
Lingnac / sir Johan Russell english / sir Johan Harpedon / Aleys Bodet / and
Bochet / all these accepted the battle. When the nombre of ten were
accomplisshed every man drew to their lodging to arm them incontinent to do
battle. When this was known in ye host / and the knights named that had
taken on them that enterprise. Than all other knights and squyers said. a
these ten knights were borne in a good hour / that have found this day so
happy an adventure. would to god quod diverse that we were of yt nombre. Every
knight and squire was joyful of this enterprise / and greatly praised the
adventure / saving the gentle lord of Coucy / who was not cotente therewith.

THe lord of Thune was of the company of the lord of coucy / he showed him
the couenante he had made with Affrenall / to be one of the ten to fight with
ten sarazyns. as many as herd thereof praised greatly that adventure / but the
lord of Coucy spoke against it and said. Ah sirs ye young people yt know but
little of the world / but rather exalte a folysshe ded than a wise deed. In
this enterprise I can se no reason for diverse causes. one is that ten knights
and squyers of our men / all gentlemen of name and blood / must fight against
as many sarazyns. How shall our men know whether they be gentlemen or no? if
they list they may set against our men ten rybauldes or varlettes / and if they
hap to be dyscomfyted / we shall wyn nothing but ten varlettes / and yet we
shall be never the nerer to win ye town of Aufryke / but we shall thus put our
good men in adventure. peradventure they will set a busshment / and when our
ten men be in the field to tarry for their men / they will close them round
about / whereby we shall lose them and be somoche the febler. There I say quod
the lord of Coucy yt Affrenall has not wrought wisely in this matter / for at
the first when the sarazyn did defye him he should than have made a another manner
of answer than he did. he should have said how he was not the chief heed of
that army / but rather one of the poorest / and where as ye blame our faith
and believe / ye are not mete to have an answer made to you thereof by me / but
if ye list I shall bring you to the great lords of our army / and I shall
take you under my saueconducte / that ye shall go and return in sauegarde and
surety / and the^ ye shall here the lords speak. Thus Affrenall should have
led the sarazyn to the duke of Burbone and to the counsel / and there he
should have been herd at leyser / and answered by good advise / such
defyau^ce in arms for such quarrel ought not to pass without great
deliberacion of good counsel. And than if the battle had been agreed unto by
us / yet it would have been known of them what men by name and surname should
acomplyssh the battle. Thereupon we to have chosen other of our men for our
honor and profit / and thereupon to hane had of the sarazyns surety and
hostage / and they of us. This had been a more metely manner to have used /
wherefore if this treaty might be withdrawn with reason / it should be well
done / and I will go and speak with the duke of Burbone / and to take
counsel with the lords of the army / and to know what they will say
thereto. thus the lord of Coucy departed fro the lord of Thune / and went to
the Duke of Burbons tent / where all the barons assembled together to take
counsel in that matter. For all that the lord of Coucy had said these words
to the lord of Thune / by manner of good counsel and advise / yet for all
that he left not / but armed himself / and so came forth with other of his
company ready to fight with the sarazyns / and sir Guy of Tremoyle the formest
knight. Thus the lords of France were in counsel in the duke of Burbons
tent. Some thought this defiaunce to be reasonable / and sustained greatly the
words and opinyon of the lord Coucy / saying how it were better to make a
another manner of treaty. And some other / as special the lord Loys earl of
Arthoys / and sir Philyp of Bare said. Sith the arms be taken and accepted on
our part / it should be great blame to let it / wherefore in the name of god
and our lady let our knights and squyers furnysshe their enterprise. This
purpose was holden and sustained / but than all things consydred / it was
thought for the best that all the hole host should be armed / and be in order
of battle / to thentent that if the sarazyns would do any falsnesse they
should be ready to resyst them. This was accomplysshed and every man well armed
/ and drew in to ye field in good order of battle ready to fight / the
genouoys crosebowes on the one side / and the knights and squiers on the other
side / every lord under his baner or penon of their arms / it was a goodly
sight to behold them. The christian men showed well how they had great desire
that the sarazyns should have come and fought with them. And the ten christian
knights and squiers were ready in the field aloue of fro their company /
abiding for the ten sarazins that should have fought with them / but it seemed
well they had no will thereto / for when they saw how the christian men ordered
them self and were ready in battle / they douted them and durst not come
forward / for all that they were three times as many men as the christian men
were. The sarasyns would often times come well mounted / and skrymyssh before
the christian men's battle / and than return again. and this they did of pure
malice to put the christian men to pain and traueyle. This day was so hot with
the son / that before nor after there had been no such seen / so that they
that were most lusty and fresshe were so sore chafed in their harness that
they were nere overcome for fault of air and wind. And always the.x. christian
men tarried a part for the ten sarazyns / but they another saw nor herd
tidings of any. Than they aduysed to aproche the town of Aufryke and to
assail it / seeing they were all ready armed and ready in battle. And all day
to keep their honor the ten knights kept the field till it was night. there
went to the assaute knights and squyers / desyringe to do deeds of arms /
they were hot and sore chafed / and yet they traueyled them self more and
more. And if the sarasyns had well known what case ye christian men were in /
they might have done the^ great damage / and a raised the siege / and by
lykelyhode to have had the victory / for ye christian men were so weary and so
sore traueyled that they had but little strenght / how be it they conquered by
assaute the first wall of the town where no man dwelte. Than the sarazyns
retrayed in to the second fortress / skrymysshynge without taking of any
great damage / but the christian men had damage enough / for in skrimisshyng and
assautynge they were in the heat of the son and in the duste of the sands
till it was might / whereby diverse knights and squiers took their death /
which was great pytie and damage. By the said occasion there dyed / first sir
Willyam of Gacill / and sir Guyssharde de la Guard / sir Lion Scalet / sir Guy
de la saluest / sir Willm^ of Staple / sir Wilyam Guyret / sir Geffrey of ye
chapel / the lord of Pierbuffier / the lord of Bonet / sir Robert of Hanges
/ sir Stephyn Sanxere / sir Aubert de la mote / sir Alaine of Champayn / ser
Geffrey Fresiers / ser Rafe of Couffan / the lord of Bourke artysion / sir
Johan of Crey bastard / sir Bertram de Sanache / sir Pyncharde of Morlayne sir
Trystram his brother / sir Aim of Cousay / ser Aim of Tourmay / sir Foukes of
Stanfours / sir Johan of Chateuas / all these were knights. And there dyed of
squiers / Foucans of Liege / Johan of Isles / Blondelet of Areton / John^ de la
Mote / Bou^beris floridas of Roque / ye lord of Belles / brother to Willyam
Fondragay / Water of Cauforus / Johan Morillen / Pier of Malnes / Gyllot
Villain / John^ of Lound / John^ Perier / Johan men Johan of Lauay / and
Willyam of Park. There dyed mo than a.lx. knights and squyers / which wisely
to consider was a great loss. And if ye lord of Coucy had been believed this
had not fortuned / for and they had kept their lodgings as they did before /
they had received no such damage.

How after this adventure and damage that fell to the christian men by reason of
this assaute before the town of Aufryke and that so many knights and squyers
were deed / they mayntayned them self more wisely after than they did before /
and co^tynued their siege a long season after. Cap. C.lxxii.
OF this foresaid adventure the knights and squiers of the host / were sore
displeased and abashed: every man bewailed his fre^des: at night they drew to
their lodginges and made gretter watch than they had made before / for dout of
the sarazyns: they passed that night without any other do^mage. Of this
adventure the sarazins knew nothing / for if they had known what case the
Christen men had been in / they might have done them great do^mage: but always
they feared the Christen men: They durst never adventure to auau^ce the^ self
/ but by scrimysshing and casting of their darts. They that were most
renomed in arms of their party was Agadyngore of Olyferne / for he loved the
daughter of ye king of Thunes / whereby he was most fresshest and ioly in deeds
of arms. Thus continued ye siege before the town of Aufryke. In the realm of
France and England / and in such countries as these knights came fro / they
herd no manner of tidings of them / whereof their friends were sore abashed /
and wist not what to say nor think. In diverse places / both in England /
Heynalte / and in France there were processyo^s made / to pray to god for the
prosperity of these christen men. Thentencion of the christen men being at the
siege / was to abide there till they had conquered the town of Affrike / outher
by force / famyne / or treaty The king of Cicyll would gladly it had been so /
and so would all other xp^en yles adioynyng for this town of Affrike was their
utter enemy: and specially the genouoys took great pain to serve the lords
to their pleasure / to the^tent they should not be anoyed by reason of their
long siege. To speak properly / it was a marvelous enterprice / and came of an
high courage of the christen knights and squyers / and specially the Frenchmen
/ who for all the loss of their knights and squiers / and poverty that they
endured / yet they co^tynued still the siege at their great costs and charges
without aid or comfort. And the genouoys / who were ye first setters on that
enterprice / began than to faint and dissymule / for as the bruteran than /
they would have been glad to have made a treaty with the Sarazyns / and to
have left the knights of France and England / and of other Christen
countries still in that business. as I shall show you here after / as it was
informed me. Now at this present time let us leave to speak of this siege of
Aufryke / and speak of a fest that the king of England made the same season
in London.

Of a feast and iustes made by the king of England in London / while the
Christen knights and squyers were at the sege before the town of Aufryke
against the sarazyns. And how this feast was publisshe in diverse countries and
lands. Cap. C.lxxiii.
YE have herd before in this history / what a feast was holde^ at Paris wha^
queen Isabell of France made there her first enter / of the which feast
tidings sprede abroad in to every country. Than king ^icharde of England and
his three uncles / ^^^yng of this goodly fest at Paris / by ye reports of such
knights and squyers of their own as had been at the same fest. Ordained a
great fest to be holden at the cite of London where there should be iustes
and.lx. knights to abide all co^mers / and with the^.lx. ladies fresshely
apparelled to keep the^ company. and these knights to just two days beside
sunday. and the challenge to begin the next sunday after ye fest of saint
Michaell. As than in the year of our lord god. M.CCC. fourscore and ten /
which sunday the said.lx. knights and.lx. ladies at two of ye clock at after
noon should issue out of the tower of London / and so to come a long the city
through Chepe / and so to Smyth. elde. and that day.xii. knights to be there
ready to abide all knights strangers such as would just. This so^day was
called the sunday of the fest of challenge. And on the mo^day next after / the
said.lx. knights to be in the same place ready to just / and to abide all
co^mers curtesly to ron with rokettes. and to the best doer of the out side
should be given him for a price a rich crown of gold. and the best doer of
the in side / duly examyned by the ladies in the queen's chamber / should have
for a price a rich gyrdell of gold. And the tuesday following the knights
should be again in the same place / and to abide all manner of squyers
strangers and other / such as would just with rokettes. and the best iuster
on the out side / should have for his price a courser sadled: and the chief
doer of the in side should have a faucon. the manner of this fest was thus
ordained and devised / and herauldes were charged to cry and publysshe this
feast in England / in Scotland / in Almayne / in Flanders / in Brabant / in
Heynalt and in France / the heraldes departed some hider and some thider.
These tidings sprede abroad into diverse countries. The heraudes had day and
time suffycient. Knights and squiers in diverse countries apparelled them
selfs to be at this feast / some to se the manner of England and some to
just. When these tidings came in to Heynalt sir Wyllyam of Heynault earl of
Ostrenaunt who was young and lyberall / and desirous to just. Purposed in him
self to go to the feast in England / to se and to honor his cosyns / king
Richard of England and his uncles / whom he had never seen before. He had
great desire to be aquaynted with them / and desired other knights and squyers
to keep him company / and specially the lord of Gomegynes because he was well
acquaynted with English men / for he had been diverse times among them. Thanne
sir Wyllyam of Haynaulte purposed while he made his prouisyon to go in to
Hollande to se his father Auberte / earl of Heynaulte / Hollande / and zelande
/ to the entente to speak with him / and to take leave to go in to England. He
deproted fro Quesnoy in Haynault / and rode till he came to Hay in Hollande /
where the earl his father was at that time. and there he showed his father his
purpose that he was in to go in to England to se the country and his cosyns /
whom he had never seen. Than therle his father answered and said. Wyllyam my
fair son / ye have nothing to do in England for now ye be by covenant of
marriage alyed to the realm of France / and your suster to be married to the
duke of Burgoyne / wherefore ye need not to seek none other alyaunce. Dear
father quod he / I will not go in to England to make any alyau^ce. I do it but
to feast and make myrthe with my cosins there / whom as yet I never saw, and
because the feast which shall be holden at London / is publisshed abroad.
wherefore sith I am signified thereof and should not go thither / it should be
said I were proud and presuptuous / where fore in the saving of mine honor I
will go thider / therefore dear father I require you agree thereto. Son quod he
do as ye list / but I think surely it were better that ye tarried at home.
When the earl of Ostrenaunt saw that his words contented not his father / he
would speak no more thereof / but fell in other co^municacion. But he thought
well enough what he would do / and so daily sent his prouisyon toward Calais.
Gomegynes the heraulde was sent in to England fro therle of Ostrenaunt / to
give knowledge to king Richard and to his uncles / how that he would come
honorably to his feast at London. Of those tidings the king and his uncles
were right ioyouse / and gave to the heraulde great gifts / which after stood
him in great stead. For after in the end of his days he fell blind / I can
not tell if god were displeased with him or not / in his days he lived
marvelously / wherefore in his old days and that he had lost his sight
there were but few that were sort thereof. Thus the earl of Ostrenaunt
departed from Hay in Hollande / and took leave of his father / and so
returned to Quesnoy in Heynaulte to the countess his wife.

THis noble feast whereof I make me^cyon / was publysshed and cried in diverse
places / whereby knights and squyers and other / aduaunsed them selfs to go
thither. The earl Walleran of saint Pole who as than had to his wife king
Richard of Englandes suster. He prepared greatly to go in to England / and so
came to Calys. And also the earl Ostrenaunt departed fro Heynaulte / well
accompanied with knights and squyers / and so passed through the country of
Arthoys / and came also to Calis and there he found the earl of saint Poule /
and the ships passagers of Dover were there ready. and when the ships were
charged and the wind good / these lords took the sea: how be it as it was
showed me / and I think it true / that therle of saint Poule passed first in
to England before the earl of Ostrenaunt. And when he came to London / he
found there the king / and his brother in law sir Johan Hollande / and other
lords and knights of England / who received him with great joy / and
demanded of him tidings of the realm of France. He answered well and
wisely. Than therle of Ostrenaunt passed over on a thursdaye and so ca^e to
Cauterbury / and on the friday he visyted saint Thomas shrine and offered there
in the morning / and lay there all that day / and the next day rode to
Rochester. And because he had so great a company and cariages he rode but small
iourneys / to ease his horse. And on the sunday he rode to dinner to Dertforde
/ and after dyuer to London to be at the feast / which began the same sunday.

ON the sunday next after the feast of saint Michaell / this feast and
tryu^phe should begin / and that day to be done in Smythfelde / iustes called
the challenge. So the same sunday about three of the clock at after noone /
there issued out of the tower of London. first threscore coursers apparelled
for the Iustes / and on every one a squier of honor ridyng a soft pase. Than
issued out threscore ladies of honor mounted on fair palfreys / ridyng on the
one side richely apparelled: and every lady led a knight with a cheyne of
silver / which knights were apparelled to just. Thus they came ridynge a long
the streets of London with great nombre of trumpettes and other mynstrelles.
And so came to Smythfelde / where the queen of England and other ladies and
damoselles were ready in cha^bres richely adorned to se the iustes / and the
king was with the queen. And when ye ladies that led the knights were come
to the place / they were taken down fro their palfreys / and they mounted up
in to chambres ready aparelled for the^. Than the squiers of honor alighted fro
the coursers / and the knights in good order mounted on them. than their
helmes were set on and made ready at all points. Than thither came the earl of
saint Poule / nobly accompanied with knights and squyers all armed with
harness / for the iustes to begin the feast / which incontinent began:
and there iusted all knights strangers / such as would and had leysar and
space / for the night came on. Thus these iustes of chaleng began / and
co^tynued till it was night. Than knights and ladies withdrue them selfs: and
the queen was lodged beside Poules in the bysshoppes palace / and there was the
supper prepared. The same euennynge came therle of Ostrenaunt to the king / who
was nobly received. Now for these iustes on the sunday. For the aunswerer
without / The earl Walleran of saint Poule had the price. And of the chalengers
the earl of Huntyngdon. There was goodly dau^syng in the queen's lodgyng / in
the presence of the king and his uncles / and other barons of England: and
ladies and damoselles contynuyng till it was day / which was time for every
person to draw to their lodgings / except the king and the queen / who lay
there in the Bysshoppes Palace / for there they lay all the feestes and iustes
during.

ON the next day which was mondaye / ye might have seen in diverse places of
the city of London / squyers and varlettes going about with harness / and
doing of other business of their masters. After noon king Richard came to
the place all armed richely apparelled / accompanied with Dukes / earls /
lords / and knights. He was one of the inner party. Than the queen well
accompanied with ladies and damsels came to the place where the iustes should
be / and mounted in to cha^bres and scaffoldes ordained for the^. Than came in
to the field the earl of Ostrenaunte / well acco^panyed with knights of his
country / and all were ready to just. Than came the earl of saint Poule and
other knights of France / such as would just. Than began the iustes / every
man payned him self to get honor. Some were stryken down fro their horses.
These iustes continued till it was nere night. Than every person drew to their
lodgings knights and ladies / and at ye hour of supper / every man drew to
the court. There was a goodly supper and well ordained. And as that day the
price was given to the earl of Ostrenaunt / for the best iuster of the utter
party / and well he deserved it. The price was given him by the ladies lords
and herauldes / who were ordained to be judges. And of the inner party a
knight of England called sir Hughe Spenser / had the price.

THe next day Tuesday / there was iustes again in the same place of all
manner of squyers / which endured till it was night / in the presence of the
king / queen / lords / and ladies. Than every man drew to their lodgings /
as they had done the days before / and at supper they returned to the
bysshoppes palais / where the king / the queen / and the ladies were. There was
a goodly and a costely supper / and after great daunsynge / contynuynge all
night.

The wednisdaye after dinner they iusted in the same place / all manner of
knights and squyers such as would just. that was a sore and a rude iustes /
enduryng till night / and than wtdrue: and at the hour of supper they resorted
where they supped before. The Thursdaye the king made a supper to all knights
and gentylmen strangers / and the queen to all ladies and damoselles. Than on
the friday the duke of Lancastre made a dinner for all knights and squyers
strangers / which was a goodly dinner. And on the Saturdaye the king and all
the lords departed fro London to Wyndsore / and therle of Ostrenaunt and the
earl of saint Poule / with all other knights and squyers strangers were
desired to acompany the king to Wyndsore / every man rode as it was reason to
the castle of Wyndsore. Than there began again great feestes / with dyners
and suppers given by the king and specially the king did great honor to the
earl of Ostrenaunt his cosyn / which earl was desired by the king and his
uncles that he would be content to take on him the order of the garter. The
earl answered / how he would take counsel in that matter. Than he cou^sayled
with the lord of Gomegines and with Fierabras of Vertan bastard / who in no
wise would discorage nor counsel him to refuce the order of the garter. So he
took it on him / whereof the knights and squyers of France such as were there
had great marueyle / and murmured sore thereat among the^ self: saying the earl
of Ostrenaunt shows well that his courage enclyneth rather to be English
than French / when he takes on him the order of the garter / and wears the
king of Englandes deuyse. He shows well he regards not the house of
France / nor the house of Burgoyne. The time will come he shall repent him
self. All things co^sydred / he knows not what he has done for he was
well-beloved with the french king / and with the duke of Thourayne his brother
/ and with all the blood royal / in such wise / that when he came to Paris or
in to any other place to any of them / they ever made him more honor than any
other of their cosyns. Thus these French men evil accused him without cause /
for that he had done / was nothing contrary nor hurtful to the realm of
France / nor to his cosyns nor friends in France. For he thought none
otherwise but honor and love / and to pleace his cosyns in England / and to
be thereby the rather a good mean between France and England / if need were.
Nor the day that he took on him the order of the garter / and his oath / every
man may well understand that he made none alyaunce / to do any preiudyce to
the realm of France. For that he did / was but for love and good company /
how be it / no man can let the enuyous to speak yuell.

When they had dau^ced and sported them a certain ^pace in the castle of
Wynsore / and that the king had given many fair gyttes to ye knights and
squy^^^ of honor / of the realm of France and Heynaulte / and specially to
the young earl of Ostrenaunt. Than every man took leave of the king and of the
queen / and of other ladies and damoselles / and of the kings uncles. Than^e
the earl of saint Poule and the French men / and the Henowayes and almaygnes
departed. Thus ended this great feast in the city of London / and every man
went to their own. Than it fortuned / as a none brute ronneth far of. The
French king / his brother / and his uncles / were enfourmed by such as had been in England at the said feast / of every thing that had been done and
said / nothyuge was forgotten / but rather more put to / in the exaltyng of
yuell deeds / than fortheryng of good deeds. It was showed the king plainly /
how the earl of Ostrenaunt had been in England and taken great pain to exalte
and to do honor to the English men / and in helping forward the feast
holden at London. and how he had the chief prise and honor of the iustes
above all other strangers. and how he had spoken so fair to the Englysh men
/ that he was become the king or Englandes man / and had made scruyce and
alyaunce with him. And taken on him the order of the Garter / in the chapel of
saint George in Wyndsore / which order was first stablysshed by king Edward
the third / and his son prince of Wales. And how that no man might enter in
to that confrary or company / without he make seruyaunt or oath / never to
bear armoure against the crown of England. Which promise they said / the
earl of Ostrenaunt had made with out any reseruacyon. with these tidings /
the French king / his brother / and his uncles were sore troubled / and
grievously displeased with the earl of Ostrenaunt. Than the French king said.
Lo sirs / ye maye^e what it is to do for him. It is not yet a year paste /
sithe he desired me that his brother might be bishop of Cambrey. And by
these tidings that gift were rather preiudyciall to the realm of France /
than auau^cement. It had been better we had given it to our cosyn of saint
Poule. The Heynoways did never good to us / nor never will: for they be proud
/ presumptuous / and to fierce. Always they have owed better good will to the
English men than to us / but a day shall come they shall repent them. We
will send to the earl of Ostrenaunt / co^mau^dynge him to come to us / to do
us homage for the cou^tie of Ostrenaunt / or else we shall put him fro it / and
annexe it to our realm. They of his counsel answered and said. Sir / ye
have well devised / let it be done as ye have said. It may well be thought
that the duke of Burgoyne / whose daughter the earl of Ostrenaunt had to his
wife / was nothing content with those tidings / for always he had auaunsed
his son of Ostrenaunt / toward the king and his counsel. This matter was
not forgotten / but incontinent the French king wrote sharp letters to therle
of Ostrenau^t / who was at quesnoy in Heynaulte / co^maundyng him to come to
Paris to do his homage / before the king and the other peers of France / for
the coutie of Ostrenaut / or else the king would take it fro him / and make him
war. When the earl had well ouersene these letters / and parceyued how that
the French king and his counsel were displeased with him / to make his
answer he assembled his counsel. as the lord of Fountayns / the lord of
Gomegynes / sir Wyllyam of Hermes / the lord of Trassegnies / the bailey of
Heynaulte / the lord of Sancelles / sir Raze of Montigny / the abbot of
Crispyne / Johan Sulbart / Iaquemart Barrier of Valencennes. These wysemen
counsayled togider / what answer might be made to the kings letters. There
were many reasons alleged / at last all things consydred / they thought it for
the best to write to the French king and to his counsel / to take a day to
answer clearly to all manner of demaundes / by the mouth of certain credyble
persons / and none by writing. And in the mean season they sent certain
notable personages to the earl of Heynaulte and duke Aubert of Hola^de to have
their cou^sayles what answer to make. Thus they did. They wrote swetely and
courtesly to the king and to his counsel / so that with those first letters
the king and his counsel was well content. Than therle and his counsel sent
in to Hollande the lord of Trassegines and the lord of Sancelles / Johan
Semart and Jacques Barrier. They rode to the earl of Heynault / and showed him
the state of the county or Heynault / and the letters that the French king
had sent to his son the earl of Ostrenaunt. the earl of Heynaulte had
marueyle of that matter and said. Sirs / I thought never otherwise / but that it
should come thus to pass. Wyllyam my son^e had nothing to do to go in to
England. I have delivered him the rule and governance of the cou^tie of
Heynaulte. he might have done and used him self / according to the counsel
of the country. Sirs / I shall tell you what ye shall do. Go to my fair cosyn
the duke of Burgoyn / for it lies well in his power to regard and to set an
order in all things demanded by the French king / I can give you no
better counsel. With this answer they departed out of Hollande and came in
to Heynault / and there showed what answer they had / wherewith the earl and
his counsel were content. There was assigned to go in to France to the duke
of Burgoyne / the lord of Trassegnies / sir Wyllm^ of Hermyes / sir Raze of
Montigny / Johan Semart / and Jacques Barrier: To show and declare all ye
process and suit that they made at the French court / should be over long
to resyte. But finally all things concluded / for all yt the duke of Burgoyne
could do / there was non other remedy / but that the earl of Ostrenaunt must
come personally to Paris / and to know his homage due to the French king for
the county of Ostrenaunt or else surely to have war. The lord of coucy and
sir Olyuer of Clysson took great pain for the earls sake / but sir John^
Mercier and the lord de la River labored on the contrary side / as much as
they might. Now let us leave to speak any more of this matter / and return to
speak of the lords and knights of France / who were at the siege before the
strong town of Aufryke against the sarazyns.

How and by what incydent the siege was raised before the town of Aufryke /
and by what occasyon and how every man returned to their own countries. Cap.
C.lxxiiii.
YE have herd here before / how the christen men had besieged the strong
town of Aufryke / by land and by see: Setting all their ententes / how to
conquer it / for they thought if they might win it / the brute thereof should
sound / to their great honors and praise. and how they might there keep them
self toguyder / and to resyst against their enemies: saying how they should
always have conforte of the Christen men / and specially of the French king /
who was young and desirous of deeds of arms / consydring how he had truce with
the Englysshmen for two years to come. the sarazyns feared the same / wherefore
daily they made prouysyon for the town / and refresshed always their town
with new fressh men / hardy adventurers / according to their usage. Thus the
season passed on / and after the christen men had suffered the great loss of
their companyons with little winning or advantage on their party / all their
hole host were in a manner dyscomforted / for they could not se how to be
revenged. Than many of them began to murmr / saying we lie here all in
vain / as for the skrymysshes that we make / thereby shall we never win the
Town of Auffryke / for if we slay any of them / for each of them they will
get again ten other. They be in their own country / they have vytayles and
prouysyons at their pleasure / and that we have is with great danger and
parell. What shall we think to do? if we lie here all this winter / long and
cold nyghtes / we shall be morfounded and frosen to death. Thus we shall be in a
herd case by diverse ways. first in winter no man dare take the sea for the
cruel and tyrryble wyndes and tempests of the sea / for the sees and
tempests are more fierser in winter than in somer / and if we should lack
vytayles but eight days together / and that the sea would suffer none to come
to us / we were all deed and lost without remedy. Secondly though it were so
that we had vytayles and all things necessary with out danger / yet how
could our watch endure the pain and traueyle contynually to watch every
night. the parell and adventure is over herd for us to bear / for our enemies
who be in their own country / and know the country / may come by night and
assail us to their great advantage / and do us great damage / as they have
done all ready. Thyrdly if for fault of good air and of sweet fresshe meats /
wherewith we have been norysshed / that mortalyte hap to fall in our host / we
shall dye every man fro other / for we have no remedy to resyst against it.
Also furthermore if the genouoys turn against us / which are rude people and
traitors / they may be night time enter in to their ships / and so leave us
here to pay for the scotte. All these doutes are to be consydred by our
capytaynes who lie at their ease / and regard not the case we be in* and also
some of the genouoys spared not to speak / and said in raylynge to the christian
men. What men of arms be ye french men / when we departed fro Genne we
thought that within fyftene days that ye had layen at siege before the town
of Aufryke / ye should have conquered it / and now we have been here more
thanne two months / and as yet we have done nothing / as for such assautes and
skrymysshes as ye make / the town needs not to fear this year / nor yet the
next. by this manner of means ye shall never conquer this realm of Aufryke
nor yet of Thunes. This comunynge spread so abroad in the host / that it came
to the knowledge of the great lords and capytaynes of the army / and specially
the lord of Coucy / who was sage and discrete / and to whose counsel the
chief part of the host inclyned ever unto. He said to him self and considred
how all these doutes were greatly to be feared / and to the entente to ordayn
hastily remedy / he assembled secretly all the great lords of the host
together in counsel / because winter aproched. This counsel was kept in the
duke of Burbons tente / and the conclusyon was to dyslodge for that seasone /
and every man to return the same way as they came / the lords prepared
secretly for this. than the patrons of the galees were sent for / and their
purpose was showed unto them / and they wist not what to say to the contrary /
at last they said. My lords take no doubt nor suspecte in us / we have made
you promise / wherefore we will acquyte us truly to you / for if we would have
enclyned to the treaties of the affrykans / they would gave desired to have had
peace with us / bnt we would never give heryng to them. we will keep our faith
to you / sith we have promised so to do. Sirs quod the lord of Coucy / we
repute you for good and true / and valyasit men / but we have consydred diverse
things / winter aprocheth / and we are destytute of vitayles and other
prouysions. By the grace of god we ones returned in to the realm of France /
we shall so enfourme the king / who is young and lusty and desirous to know
the manner of these marches / and seeing that he has treuce with the english
men / we think small counsaylynge will cause him to come hither with a
puyssaunce royal / as well to aid the king of Cicyll / as to make some
conquest upon the sarazyns / wherefore syrs / we require you make ready your
galees and all other vessels / for we will depart within short days. The
genouoys were nothing content with the french men / in that they would
depart fro the siege before the strong town of Aufryke / but they could
find none other remedy / wherefore it behooved them to suffer. A general brute
ran through the host / how the genouoys were about to bargayne with the
sarazyns / and take their part / and to betray ye christian men. The christian men
believed this to be true / and some said one to an other. our sovereign
capitayns as the duke of Burbone / the earl Dolphyn of Auuergne / and the lord
Coucy / sir Guy de la Tremoyle / sir Johan of Vyen / and sir Phylyppe of Bare /
they know surely how every thing gothe / and therefore we shall thus
sodaynely depart fro the siege. Their departure was publysshed through the
host / and every man commanded to convey every thing in to their ships.
Than saruau^tes and varletres were ready to trusse all manner of baggages / and
to carry it in to their vessels lyenge at ancre. When every thing was conveyed /
every man entered in to such ships as they came in / and diverse barons and
knights made covenant with their patrons and masters of their ships / some
to sail to Naples / some to Cicyll / some to Cyper / and some to Rodes / to
the intent to go to Iherusalem. Thus they departed fro the siege of Aufryke /
and took the sea in the sight of the sarazyns that were within the town. When
they saw their departure / they made great noise with blowyng of horns and
sownynge of taburs / and shoutynge and cryeng / in such wise / that the host
of sarazyns that lay abroad knew thereof. than ye should have seen the young
sarazyns mou^te on their horses / and came to the place where the siege had
layne / to se if they could have found any thing there. Agadingor of
Olyferne / and Brahadyne of Thunes formest. And there they saw how the
christen men were so clean departed / that they had left nothing behind that
they might carry. There the sarazyns rode up and down more than two hours / to
se the manner how the christian men had lodged them self at the siege / they
greatly praised the christian men's subtyltie / in that they had made so many
pyttes in the earth to have thereby fresshe water. And when they had been
there a certain space / and well regarded the galees and ships on the sea /
some of them entered in to the town of Aufryke / to se their friends and alyes
/ and other departed again to their lodgings / and made bost of their voyage
/ saying how the christian men durst abide there no lengar / and said how
their puissaunce was nothing to regard / and that they would never more set
somoche by the french men nor by the genouoys / as they had done before. and
of this they said troth / I shall tell you how and wherefore.

AFter that this siege was thus continued / as I was enfourmed ye sarazins
waxed proud / for they saw well how the genouoys had done their full power
to hurt and to anoy them / and they saw that this voyage was to their great
cost / and yet had won but little / which was of truth. And all that season
the sarazyns knew nothing of the death of so many christian knights and squyers
as were slain at the great skrymysshe / but the same day that the christian men
departed / they had knowledge thereof / and I shall show you by what means.
The sarazyns found in the field a varlet of the genouoys / lyenge on the
ground sore sick of the hot fever / and was not able to go to the galees
when his fellows departed. And of the finding of this varlet / the sarazyns
were right joyful / and brought him before their lords / and showed how they
had found him / than a trucheman was set to here his examynacion. In the
beginning he would show nothing / for he reekened himself but deed / and he
desired the sarazyns incontinent that they would put him to death. than the
lords of the host / as Agadingor Dolyferne / Brahadyn of Thunes / and diverse
other / thought if they should cause him to dye they should wyn nothing thereby
/ yet rather to save his life / so yt he would show the truth of that he
should be demanded. Than it was showed him that if he would without lyenge
show the troth / his life should be saved / and to be delivered frank and
free / and sent into his own country by the first ship that should come
thence / outher in to the land of Geneue or Marcyll / and also that he should
have given to him a. C. besantes of gold. When the varlet who feared death
herd this promise he was well comforted / for he knew well what so ever the
sarazyns promise by their faith should be truly kept / and also ye know
well naturally every man is loathe to dye. Than he said to the truchman. cause
the lords to swear on their law to uphold all that ye said / and than shall
I answer you to all that I shall be examyned of / as far forth as I know.
The trucheman showed this to the lords / and they made faithful promise by
their faith to fullfyll their promise. Than ye varlet said. now demand what
ye will / and I shall answer. Than first he was demanded of whence he was.
He answered and said / he was of Portnances. Than they demanded of him of the
feats of the french men that had been at the siege. He named to them diverse /
for he had kept often times company with harauldes / by whom he had learned
diverse of their names. Than they desired to know ye occasion why they departed
so sodaynely fro the siege. where to he answered wisely and said. As for that I
can not tell / but by supposing / and acordyng as I have herd spoken in our
host / as for me I was never a counsel with the lords. but as the brute went
/ the frenchmen were in doubt of the genouoys that they should betray them /
and the genouoys denied it and said / they never thought it nor never would /
and blamed the frenchmen yt they should so slander them. Also it was said that
part of the occasyon of their departure was because the winter druenere / and
they were afraid of taking of such damage as they had received before. what
damage was that quod the lords. Syrs quod he / the same day that ten of our
men should have fought with ten of yours / they lost about a.lx. knights and
squiers of name and arms / the genouoys said for that cause they departed.
They believed well ye varlet / of which news the lords sarazyns had great
joy. They enquered of him no further / but vphelde to him all their promesses
/ and so he returned to Portnances and to Geane / and showed all this
adventure / and what he had said and herd / and he received no blame thereof.
Than the sarazyns said among them self / they should not need to care for the
french men nor for the genouoys of a long season after / and said how before
the town of Aufryke they had taken no profit / how be it they said they
would take better head to their ports and havens and the sea costs of their
Realms / and specially to the straytes of Marroke they set sure watch / that
the genouoys nor venysians should not pass that ways in to England / nor in
to Flaunders / with their marchaundyses / without payenge of a great trybute /
and yet that to be by great grace and license. Thus the sarazyns assembled and
alyed them togythers of diverse realms / as of Aufryke / Thunes / Bogy /
Martoke / Belmaryn / Tremessyans / and Granade / all agreed together to keep
straytly their ports and passages / and to set galees armed on the sea to a
great nombre / to the intent to be lords and masters of the sea. and all this
they did for the great hatred that they had to the frenchmen and genouoys /
because they had been at the siege before Aufryke. thus they did great trouble
to the goers and comers on the sea / so that much yuell and myschefe grew
thereby / for by means that the sarazyns were thus lords of the sea / such
marchaundyses as came fro Da^mas / fro Cayrel fro Alexaunder / fro Venyce / fro
Naples / and fro Geane / were in yt season so dear in Flaunders and so scarce /
that many things could not be got / nouther for gold no silver / and
specially all spycery was wonderful dear and gayson.

YE have herd here before how the christian men departed for the siege of
Aufryke. They all passed the sea / but all aryued not at one port / for some
were so sore tourmented on the sea / that they returned in great danger /
how be it some of them returned to Geane. Processyons were made in France
for their good speed / for there was no tidings herd of them. The lady of
Coucy / the lady of Sulley / the lady Dolphyn of Auuergne / and other ladies of
France / who had their husbands in this voyage were in great sorrow / as
long as the voyage endured. and when tidings came how they were passed the sea / they were right joyful. The duke of Burbone and the lord of Coucy
returned privily / and left behind them all their caryage and train / and
so they came to Paris about saint Martyns tide in winter. The french king
was ioyouse of their coming / as it was reason / and demanded of them
tydinges of Barbary / and of their voyage. they showed all that they knew / and
had herd and seen. The king and the duke of Thourayne were glad to here them
speak. Than the king said / if we can bring it about to make peace in the
church / and between us and England / we shall gladly make a voyage with an
army royal in to those parties / to exalte the christian faith / and to
confound the infydels and to acquyte the deeds of our predecessors / as king
Ppilyp and king Johan / for they both each after other took on them the
crossey / to have gone to the holy land / and they had gone thither if ye
wars had not fallen in their realm. In like wise we would gladly make such
a voyage. Thus the French king comuned with these lords / and so the day
passed / and little and little men came home fro their voyage / and the king
held him self that season most comenly at Paris / sometime at ye castle of
Lowre / and a another time in the house of saint Powle / where the queen most
comenly lay. So it fell in the same season about the feast of saint Andrewe /
and that all knights and squyers were returned fro their voyage into Barbary
/ whereof all yt world spoke. than in the french kings court there was a
mocyon moved for a new journey to be made thither. And because that the french
king had great affection to deeds of arms / he was counsayled and exorted
thereto / and it was said to him. Sir ye have devotion and great ymagynacion to
go over the sea / to fight against the infydels / and to conquer the holy
land. That is true quod the king / my thought night and day is on none other
thing. and as I was enfourmed / it was ye lord of Tremoyle and sir Johan
Mercier that had these words to the king / for they owed their favor to pope
Clement being at Auignon. and look what they two said ye king would agree to
them / for they were most special in favor. Than they said to the king. Sir
ye can not with good conscience take on you this voyage / with out first the
church be all one. sir begin first at the heed / than your enterprise shall
take good conclusyon. Why quod the king where would ye have me to begin? Sir
quod they at this present time ye be not charged with any great business / ye
have treuce with the english men for a long space. wherefore sir if it please
you this peace during / ye might make a goodly voyage. and sir we can se no
better nor more honorable a voyage for you / thanne to go to Rome with a great
puyssaunce of men of arms / and pull down and dystroy that antepaye / whom
the romans by force has created and set in the seat cathedral of saint
Peter / if ye will ye may well accomplysshe this voyage / and we suppose ye
can not pass your time more honorably. And sir / ye may well know that if
this antepape and his cardynals know ones yt ye be minded to come on them with
an army / they will yield them self / and ask mercy. The king remembered him
self a little and said / how he would do as they had devised / for surely he
said he was much bound to pope Clement / for the year past he had been at
Auygnon / where as the pope and his cardynals made him right honorable chere /
and had given more than was demanded / both to him self / to his brother /
and to his uncles / wherefore the king said it had deserved to have some
recompense. and also at his departure fro Auignon / he had promised the pope to
help and to assyst him in his quarrel. At that season there was at Paris with
the king / the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne. than it was agreed and concluded
that the next March after the king should depart fro Paris / and take the
way toward Sauoy and Lombardy / and the earl of Sauoy to send his cosyn
Germayne with him / and the king to have under his charge the duke of Tourayne
his brother with four thousand spears / and the duke of Burgoyne with two
thousand spears / and the duke of Berrey two thousa^de / the constable of
France two thousand spears / with the bretons / raintoners and low marches
/ the duke of Burbon a thousa^de spears / the lord of saint Poll and the
lord of Coucy a thousand spears / and all these men of arms to be paid in
hand for three months / and so fro term to term. And when those tidings
were known in Auignon / pope Clement and his cardynals were greatly reioysed /
and thought in a manner their enterprise atcheued. Also the king was cou^sayled
not to leave the duke of Bretayne behind him / but to send and to desire him
to prepare him self to go with him in this voyage. The king wrote notably to
him / and sent his letters by a man of honor an offycer of arms / signyfyenge
the duke in his letters the state of this voyage. When the duke had red these
letters he turned him self and smyled / and called to him the lord of
Mountboucher and said. Sir hark and regard well what the french king has
written to me / he has enterprised to depart this next March with a great
puissaunce to go to Rome and to distroy such as take part with pope Bonyface.
As god help me his journey shall turn to nothing / for in short space he
shall have more flax to his dystaffe than he can well spynne / I think he will
leave soon his folyssh thought. And also he desires me to go with him with
two thousand spears / howebeit I will honor him as I ought to do / and I
will write to him ioyously / because he shall be content / and show him /
how if he go in this voyage he shall not go without me / seeing it pleases him
to have my company / how be it sir of Mou^tboucher I say unto you / I will not
traueyle a man of mine for all yt the king has purposed and said / nothing
shall there be done in that behalf. The duke of Bretayne wrote goodly letters
and sweet to the french king / and the officer of arms returned with them
to Paris / and delivered them to the king / who read them and was well
contented with the answer.

Of the English knights that were sent to Paris to the french king / fro
the king of England and his uncles to treat for a peace. Cap. C.lxxv.
THe will and purpose of the french king none would break / for it pleased
greatly all the knights and squyers of France / because they wist not where
better to enploy their season / and every man prepared toward that voyage /
and namely the clergy of all the prouynces of the realm / ordained and
granted a tail / to send at their costs and charges men of war with the
king. How be it this voyage turned to nothing / as the duke of Bretayne had
said before / and I shall show you by what incidence. About ye feast of
Candelmas came other tidings to the French king and to his counsel / which
they looked nothing for. Certain of the king of Englandes counsel / and
such as were of his privy chamber / were sent nobly to Paris to the french
king / and they that were chief of this legacyon was / sir Thomas Percy / sir
Loys Clyfforde / and sir Robert Briquet / with diverse other knights in their
company / but I herd as than no mo named. When these three knights were come
to Paris to him / than the french king was desirous to know what it might
mean / that the king of England did send so hastily of his counsel to
him. These knights of England / sir Thomas Percy and other / alyghted in
Paris in the streate called the Cross / at the sign of the castle. The
french king as than lay in the castle of Lowere / and his brother the duke
of Tourayne with him / and his other three uncles in other lodgings in the
city / and the constable sir Olyuer Clysson. It was nere hand noone when the
english men came to Paris / and they kept their lodging all that day and
night after / and the next day about nyue of ye clock they lept on their
horses right honorably and rode to the castle of Loure to the king / where he
with his brother and uncles / the Earl of saint Poll / the lord of Coucy / the
constable of France / sir Johan of Vien / and sir Guy de la tremoyle with
diverse other barons of France / were ready to receive the english
ambassadors / who alyghted at ye gate and entered in / and there received them
the lord de la River / sir Johan Mercyer / sir Lion of Lignach / sir Peter
Villers / sir Willyam of Tremoyle / and sir Marcell. there they received them
honorably / and brought them in to the chamber / where the king tarried for
them. Than they did of their bonettes and kneled down. sir Thomas Percy had
the letters of credence that the king of England had sent to the french
king / he delivered them to the king who took them / and caused the knights
to stand up / than they stepe some what back. The king opyned the letters
and red them / and saw well that they had credence / than he called to him his
brother and his uncles and showed them the letters / than his uncles said. Sir
call forth the knights / and here what they will say. Than they aproched and
were commanded to declare their credence. than si^ Thomas Percy spoke and
said. Dear sir / the entencyon of our sovereign lord the king of England is
/ that he would gladly that such of his special counsel / as his uncles
dukes of Lancastre / york / and Glocestre / and other prelates of England /
such as his special (...) might come in to your presence and to your
counsel / as shortly as might be / to treat for a manner of peace / so that
it he and you together might couenably and resonably be con^oyned / and means
sound to have a conclusyon of peace / he would be thereof right joyful / and
for that entente he would nouther spare his own pain and labor / nor yet
none of his men / another to come him self or to send suffyciente persons
over thesee to the city of Amyence / or to any other place assigned. And sir
we be come hyder for this entente to know your pleasure in this behalf. Than
the king answered and said. Sir Thomas Percy / you and all your company are
right hertely welcome / and of your coming and words we are right joyful /
ye shall ^ary here in Paris a season / and we will speak with our counsel and
make you such a couenable answer or ye depart / that it shall suffyce you.
With this answer the english men were well content. Than it was nere dinner
time / and the english men were desired to tarry to dyne. And so the lord of
Coucy brought them in to a chamber and the lord de la River. There they dyned
at their layser / and after dy^er they returned in to the kings chamber / and
there had wine and spyces and thanne took their leave of the king and went to
their lodging.

THe coming of sir Thomas Percy and his company in to France and the tidings
that they brought / pleased greatly the french king and the duke of Burgoyne
/ and diverse of his counsel / but not all^ and specially such as aided to
sustain pope Clementes quarrel / for they saw well by these tidings / that
if the french king enclyned to this treaty / that it should greatly let and
hinder the voyage that was minded to go to Rome / to distroy pope Bonyfac^ and
his cardynals / or else to bring them to the believe of pope Clemente But the
matter of treaty of peace was so ^egh / and touched so much the welthe and
prefyte all crystendome / so that no person durst speak against it. The duke
of Burgoyn and his counsel / with the king and his brother and the duke of
Burbone / were all of one acorde. The king made good chere to ser Thomas Percy
and to the englysshmen / but among them there was one knight / called sir
Robert Briquet / wheme the french king loved not / he was a french man borne
/ but always he held him self outher naueroys or english / and as than he
was one of the king of Englandes privy chamber. The french king dissymuled
with him sagely / for when he spoke to them / always the king would turn
his self to sir Thomas Percy or else to sir Loys Clyfforde / and said. Syrs /
we would gladly se this peace to be had between us and our adversary the king
of England / for the quarrel and war has to long endured between us. and
one thing I will ye know / yt it shall not be hyndred on out part / though
it be greatly to our cost. Sir quod they the king our sovereign lord / who has
sent us hither has great affection to have peace / and says that it shall
not be let on his part / and has marueyle that the war and dyscensyon
between your lands has endured so long / and that no good amyable means
has been had or this time. Than the french king answered and said / we
shall se the good affection that he has thereunto.

THese englysshemen tarried at Paris vi. days / and every day dyned with one of
the dukes of France / and in the mean season it was determined / that the
french king / his uncles and his privy counsel should be at Amyence / by
the mids of March next after / there to abide the coming of the king of
England / his uncles / and his counsel / if they would come thither. And the
english knights said / they made no doubt but at the lest the king of
Englandes uncles should be at the day assigned at Amyence. this was the
conclusyon of this treaty. The day before that they should depart out of
Paris / the king came to ye palace where his uncles were / and there he made a
dynner to the Englyssh knights / and caused sir Thomas Percy to sytte at his
board and called him cosyn / by reason of the Northumberlandes blood / at which
dinner there was given to sir Thomas Percy and to the englyssh knights and
squiers great gifts and fair jewels / but in the gyunge of them / they over
slypte sir Robert Briquet. and sir Peter Villers chief steward with the french
king / delivered the gifts / and be said to sir Robert Briquet. Sir when ye
have done such service to the king my master / as shall please him / he is
rich and puisaunt enough to reward you. With which words sir Robert Briquet
was sore abashed / and parceyued well thereby that ye king loved him not / but
he was feign to suffer it. after dinner mynstels began to play / that pastyme
ones past sir Thoms Percy ca^e to the king and said. Sir / I and my company
have great marueyle of one thing / yt ye have made us so good chere and given
us so great gifts that sir Robert Briquet has nothing / who is a knight of
our masters preuy chamber. Sir we desire to know the cause why: thereto
answered the french king and said. Sir Thomas / the knight that ye speak of /
sith ye will know yt matter. he has no need to be in battle against me / for
if he were taken prisoner his ransom should soon be paid / and therewith the
king entered in to other co^munycacion. Than wine and spyces were brought forth
/ and so took leave and returned to their lodging / and made a reconyng and
paid for every thing. The next day they departed and spedde so in their
iourneys that they arrived in England / and showed the king and his uncles
how they had spedde / and greatly praised the french king / and the chere
that he had made them / and showed of the gifts and jewels that he had given
them. Now let us leave a little to speak of the English men / and some
what show of king Johan of Castyle.

Of the death of king John^ of Castyle / and of the crownyng of king Henry his
son. Cap. C.lxxvi.
YE have herd here before in this history / how peace was made between the
king of Castyle and the duke of Lancastre / who challenged to have right to the
realm of Castyle / by reason of the lady Custaunce his wife / daughter to king
Do^peter. And by means of a fair daughter yt the duke of Lancastre had by the
said lady Custaunce / the peace was made and confyrmed. For the said king
Johan of Castyle had a son to his heir / called Henry / who was prince of
Galyce. This Henry was married to the duke of Lancasters Daughter / whereby good
peace was made between England and Castyle: and within two years after this
marriage king Johan of Castyle dyed / and was buried in Burgus in Spaygne.
Anon after his death / the prelates and lords of Spaygne drew toguyder / and
determined to crown the young herytoure the prince of Galyce. This prince
Henry was crowned the nynth year of his age / and his wife daughter to the duke
of Lancastre was a fyfteene year of age. Thus the dukes daughter by the lady
Custaunce was queen of Castyle / and lady and heritour to all the lands and
seignories / that king Dompeter / king Henry / and king Johan held / except
that the duke of Lancaster her father and his wife her mother had during their
lives / which was a pensyon of a hundred thousand doreyns by year: And four
of the best earls of Spain were pledges and dettours for the same. Thus the
duke of Lancastre saw his two daughters (one queen of Spaygne / the other
queen of Portugale) bestowed.

Now let us speak of the young earl of Armynake / and of the voyage he made
in to Lombardy / for the matter requires it: and we shall leave to speak of
the king of Castyle.

Of the army of the young earl Johan of Armynake / and of the vyage that he
made in to Lombardy: And how he dyed at the siege before the town of
Alexandre. Ca. C.lxxvii.
IT has been showed here before / what great of fectyon the young Earl of
Armynake had to go in to Lombardy with men of war / to aid and assyste his
suster germayne / and his brother in law her husband the lord Barnabo /
eldest son to the lord Barnabo whom the duke of Myllayne had caused to be
slain marueylouslye. And this duke of Myllayne was earl of Virtues / and named
Galeas / Whose daughter the duke of Orlyaunce had to wife. This said lady /
who was daughter to the old earl of Armynake and suster to the young earl /
was greatly abashed and disconforted / and had no trust but on her brother.
She signified to him all her estate / her poverty and necessyte / and do^mage
that she suffered: And humbly required her brother / that he would help to keep
and defend her against the tyrant the earl of Virtues / who would disheryte
her without any tytell of reason. And to the request of his suster the earl of
Armynake condiscended / and said. That what soever it should cost him / he
would do his deuoyre to aid his suster. And all that he promised he
acco^plisshed in deed. for he had by the aid of the earl Dolphyne of Auuergne
/ made diverse treaties in Auuergne / Rouergue / Quercy / Lymosyn / Piergourte /
Engoulmoys / and Agenoyes / and had bought certain fortresses which had been
kept by the English men / gascoyns / and bretons / such as had made war
against the realm of France / under color of the king of England / and all
such as he had agreed withal / had their pardons of the French king: and
beside that / the king gave gold and silver to be given among them. But they
were all bound to the earl of Armynake / to go with him in to Lo^bardy to aid
him in his wars there. And every man showed him self thereto well willing /
and every man drew to the river of Rosne and to ye river of Sosne. The duke of
Berrey and the duke of Burgoyne suffered them in their countries to take
vitaylles at their pleasure / for they would gladly have had them clean
delivered out of the country. And in yt season under the king there ruled in
the Dolphynry / the lord Engueram Durdyn. And the king had written to him /
commaundyng that these men of war parteynyng to the earl of Armynake / should
pesably pass through the country / and to have that they neded for their
money.

When the earl of Foiz being in Byerne in his castle of Ortays / understood
how the earl of Armynake assembled men of war toguyder / he began to muse /
for he was a man greatly ymaginatife Well he had herd how the brute was /
that the earl of Armynake made this assemble to go in to Lo^bardy against the
lord of Myllaygne. But because in time past the earl of Armynake and his
predecessors before him and his brother Bernarde of Armynake had made him
war / therefore he douted lest the said assemble should turn against him.
wherefore he thought he would not be unprovided / but prepared his fortresses
with men of war / and made such prouysion / that if he were assailed / to
resyst it with all his puissaunce. But the earl of Armynake nor his brother
were nothing of that purpose / but thought surely to uphold ye treuce that
was between them / and to atcheue his enterprice in to Lombardy. There were
many knights and squyers English / gascoyns / bretons and other that were
bound to serve the earl of Armynake in his wars. But if he should have made
war against the earl of Foiz / they would have taken the earl of Foiz part /
and have forsaken the earl of Armynake / the earl of Foiz was so well-beloved
with all men of war / for the wisdom / largess and prowess that was in
him. And whan^e the duchess of Thourayne was enfourmed how therle of Armynake
was ready to pass over the mountayns / to enter in to Lombardy with puissaunce
of men of war / to make war against the duke of Myllayne her father. And
how that the French king and his uncles / the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne
consented thereto / because they would have their countries clean avoided of the
co^panyons and routes of pyllars / such as had often times grieved sore their
countries. this lady thought not to forgette the matter / but wrote to her
father the duke of Millayne / all that she knew / to the entente that he
should take heed to him self / and to his country. The lord of Myllayne was
well informed of the business / and provided for men of war where he might
get them / and refresshed his towns / cities / and castelles with vitayle /
and other munysio^s of war. and looked surely to have war with the earl of
Armynake / as they had in deed.

ABout the mids of the month of March / the most part of these co^panyons
were assembled toguyder in the marchesse of Auignon / all a long the river of
Rosne / to the nombre of fyftene thousand horses / and passed the river: and
so entered in to the Dolphynny of Vyen / and lodged abroad in the vyllages / and
some passed forward to have the more easy passage thoroughe the mountayns /
which were peryllous to pass / both for man and horse. The earl of Armynake
and his brother / with certain other knights went to Auygnon / to se him
that was called pope Clemente / and the cardynalles there. And offered their
service to the pope / to aid him against the tyrants the lombardes / for
which offer they were thanked. And when they had been there an eight days /
and that great part of their company were paste forward / They took their
leave of the pope and of the cardynalles / and prepared to follow their men.
there the two brethren departed a sondre / the earl Johan of Armynake and sir
Bernarde his brother. Than the Earl said. Brother / ye shall return back to
Armynake and keep our heritage / of Comynges and Armynake For as yet all the
fortresses be not delivered fro the companyons. There is as yet the garyson of
Lourde / where as Peter Arnaulte keeps under the king of England: And also
the garyson of Bounteuyll / which is kept by sir Johan of Granley / son to
the Captall of Buse. And though it be so / that as now we have peace with the
earl of Foiz yet it is good to doubt him / for he is cruel and hastye: his
thought is unknown / therefore it is good that our lands be not dyspurueyed.
Wherefore Brother / for these causes and other ye shall return home / and ye
shall here often fro me and I fro you. Sir Bernarde lightlye agreed to this
purpose. The deuyse seemed good to him. Nor also he had no great affection to go
forth in that iournay. Than at his departing / the earl his brother said to
him. Brother / in your retournyng ye shall go to our cosyn Raymonde of
Thourayne / who holds land of the pope in the county of Venus / and makes
war against him / and my cosyn has married his daughter to the prince of
Orange / and show him how I am desired of the pope / to require him to go
with me in this voyage / and I shall make him my companyon in every thing /
and I shall tarry for him at the city of Gappe between ye mountayns. Sir quod
Bernarde I shall do your message. Thus the two brethren departed a sondre in
the field / and never met to guyder again after. The earl of Armynake took
the way to the city of Gappe in ye land of Ganos. And Bernarde his brother
went to the castle of Bolongne / where sir Raymonde of Thouraygne was / who
received his cosyn ioyously. Than sir Bernarde showed him the message that he
had to say / fro his brother the earl of Armynacke / with as fair words as
he could deuyse / the rather thereby to enclyne him thereto. Than sir Raymonde
answered and laid. Fair cosyn / or your brother the earl of Armynake be
entered far in to Lo^bardy / and has besieged any town / I shall follow him
/ but as yet it is to soon for me and my men to go forward. Write unto your
brother my cosyn / yt about the month of May I shall follow him. and by ye
time I trust to have an end of the war between mine uncle pope Clement / and
the cardinals at Auignon and me / who as yet will do me no right / and keeps
away fro me perforce / that mine uncle pope Gregory gave me. they wene to
weary me / but they shall not They desire knights and squyers / and gives
them pardons to make war against me / but they have no list thereto. For I
can have mo men of war for a thousand Floreyns in one day / than they can
have for all their absolucions in seuyn year. Fair cosyn quod sir Bernarde
that is true. Keep on your purpose / I would not counsel you otherwise. And
as ye have answered me / so shall I write to my brother therle of Armynake. So
be it quod sir Raymonde. Thus they were toguyder all a hole day. Than^e sir
Bernarde departed and passed the river of Rosne at the bridge. Saint Espyrite /
and so returned in to Query and in to Rouergue by the mountayns / and so came
thither as he would be / and left the earl of Armynake his brother alone with
his war / against the duke of Myllayne earl of Virtues. Or he departed fro
Bolonge he wrote to his brother all the news that he knew / and the answer
of sir Raymonde of Thourayne. The earl of Armynake received the letters in the
way going to the city of Gappe. He read the letters / and so passed forth
and made no great force of the matter.

WE will continue to speak of the young earl of Armynacke and show his feate /
or I speak of any other matter. And thus I say The good love and great affection
that he had to conforte his suster and brother in law her husband / whom the
earl of Virtues / who called him self lord of Myllaygne falsely disheryted
without cause or tytell^ caused the earl ioyously to pass in his journey as
far as Pyemount in Lombardy. There was two great reasons that caused the earl
of Armynake to assemble / and to make that journey at that time. The first was
/ that the realm of France thereby was clean rydde of the routes of these
companyons / that had done much hurt in the reaime / and thereby the
countries better assured than they were before. The second reason was to aid
his suster / for he had great pytie that she and her husband should lose their
heritage / whereby they should live and maynteyne their estate / and for these
consyderacions he took on him this enterprice. The capitayns of the companyons
said one to another. Let us ride forth merrily against these lombardes / we
have a good quarrel and a inste tytell / and we have a good captain / whereby
our war shall be much the better. And also we shall go in to the best country
of all the world / for Lombardy receives fro all costs the fatness of the
world: and the e lombardes be naturally ever rich and cowardes: We shall
attain against them much profit: There is none of us that be capitayns /
but that shall return so rich / that we shall never need to make war more
against any man. Thus the companyons de used one with another / and when they
came in to a plentuous country / there they would tarry a season to refresshe
them and their horses.

In the same season the good abue^turous fought of England sir Johan Hacton
was in the marchesse of Florence / and made war against the flore^tyns / in
the quarrel of pope Bonyface of Rome / for they were rebel against the popes
commandment / and so were also the Perusyns. The earl of Armynake thought
that if he might get this English knight to take part with him / he should
have a great treasure of him / because of his wisdom and valiantness. The
earl wrote to him / signyfieng him all the hole matter of his enterprice /
desyringe him of his aid. Which letter was sent by a discrete person to sir
Johan Hacton being in the marchesse of Florence / and had a two thousand
fighting men. He received the letter and read it. And when he had well
understand all the substance thereof he was right joyful / and answered and
said. That his own war ones atchyued / he would do nothing after / till he
were in the company of the earl of Armynake. The messanger said. Sir ye say
well / I require you write your mind to my lord the earl of Armynake / he
will the better believe it. With right a good will sir quod the knight / it is
reason that I so do. Than the English knight wrote / and delivered the letter
to the messangere / who returned and came again to his lord / and found him
as than in the marchesse of Pyneroll / where was great treaty bitwene him and
the Marquis of Salues / who should be alyed with him / to aid him in his war
against the duke of Myllayne earl of Virtues.

THe tidings that the earl of Armynackes Squire brought to him fro sir Johan
Hacton / and of the Words that were written within the letter / The Earl was
greatly reioysed and said. that he trusted to make such war to the duke of
Myllayne / that he would bring him to reason / or else to dye in the pain.
When all his company were passed the straytes of the mountayns / and were in
the good country of Piemounte nere Thouraygne. Than they rode abroad / and
did much hurt in the vyllages / such as could not hold against them. Than
the earl laid sige before Aste in Pyemount / and intended to rary there for
sir John^ Hacton. Prouisyon came to them fro all parts / and also the
companyons wan certain small holds / and took the vitayls that was within
them. The country of Pyneroll / and the lands of the Marquis Mount feraunt
were opyned and apparelled to deliver vytayles / and other things nercessary
for ye host both for men and horse. And also great prouisyon came to them out
of ye Dolphyne and out of the county of Sauoy. Many folks greatly enclyned to
the earl of Armynake / because they saw his quarrel was good and just / and
also because the earl of Virtues had caused to be slain his own uncle sir
Bernabo for envy / to set again the lords of Lombardy in to their herytages
/ and disheryted his cosyn germayns / whereof many great lords / though they
spoke but little thereof / yet they had great pytie of the case. While the
earl lay thus at siege before Aste / he herd tidings of sir John^ Hacton /
whereof he was greatly reioysed. The tidings was / that the florentynes were
come to the popes mercy / and also the Venisyens. And how that the said sir
John^ should have threscore thousand Floreyns / for him and his company. And
that money ones paid / received / and delivered / where as it should be
departed / than he promised with a five hundred spears and a thousand brigans
a foot / to come in to the fronter of Ge^nes / and to pass over the river /
wheder their ennemeys would or natte / and so to come to the earl of Armynake
where soever he should be. These tidings greatly reioysed the earl of
Armynake and all his company / for the aid of this sir John^ Hacton was right
pleasant. Than the earl of Armynake was counseled to deperte thens and to go
and lay siege before a great city called Alexandre / at the entryng of
Lo^bardy and whan^e they had won that / than to go to Bresuell / which was
also a good city and a fair.

THus the earl of Armynake and his company laid siege before the cite of
Alexaundre / standing in a fair country and a plain. at the departing out of
Pyemount and at the entering of Lombardy / and the way to go to the river of
Ge^nes. These men of war passed the river of Thesyn and lodge at their ease
at large / for the country was good and plesaunt there about. The Lord
Galeas lord of Myllayne and earl of Virtues / was as than in a town called
the city of Pauy / and daily herd tidings what his enemies did / but he
had marueyle of one thing / how therle of Armynake could get the richesse
to pay wages to so many men of war as he had brought with him / but his
counsel answered him and said. Sir / have no marueyle thereof / for the men
that he has be such companyons / that desires to win and to ride at
adventure. They have used long to ouerron the realm of France / and to take
holds and garysons in the country / so that ye country could never be
delivered of them. And so it is / that now of late the duke of Berrey and the
Dolphyn of Auuergne / to whose countries these rutters did much do^mage / for
they kept them there against the lords wylles / and over ran the best part
of their he rytages / and made them war. And they caused the Earl of
Armynake to treat with these companyons / so that the French king should
suffer the^ to come in to this your country to make war. And thereby / and by
means of certain money given to them / they are avoided out of all the
forteresses in the country. And also beside that / the French king has
perdoned all such as made war against him / on ye co^dycion that they should
serve the earl of Armynake in his wars / and all that they could get should
be their own. They demand none other wages. And such be named men of arms
among them / with a five or six horses / that if they were in their own
countries they would go a foot / and be but as poor men. It is great parell
and ieopardy to fight against such men / and also lightly they be all good men
of war. Wherefore sir / the best counsel that we can give you / is to keep
your towns and fortresses / they be strong and well provided for / and your
enemies have none artyllary nor engyns / for the saute to be regarded. They
may well come to the barryers of your towns and scrimysshe / other do^mage
they can do none. And this appears well / for they have been in your country
this two months / and as yet have taken no fortress little nor great. Sir let
them alone / and they shall weary the^ self / and be distroyed at the end / so
ye fight not with them. And when they have distroyed the plain country / and
have no more to live by: They shall than be feign to return for famyne /
without any other yuell fortune fall on them in the mean time. And it shall be
well done that your men of war in your fortresses keep toguyder to aid each
other / in time of need. And sir / send to such places as ye think your
enemies will besiege to resyst the^ / for towns men have but small defense /
for they be not so used nor accustomed to war / nouther to assaut nor to
defend as men of arms knights and squyers be / who are norisshed and brought
up therein. sir / send your men of war to the city of Alexandre / Thereby ye
shall have double profit. your city shall be defended and your people shall
love you the better / when they se ye do aid and confort them. And sir thereto
ye be bound sith ye have governance over them / and that they pay to you
their rentes / subsydies / and aids that ye have demanded of them diverse
times. your enemies can not be so strong in the field before Alexaundre / that
the town should be closed in round about: they have no such nombre to do it
/ wherefore your men shall enter in to the town at their case. And when they of
the town shall se them sel^ e refresshed with your men of war / they shall
have ye more courage / and love you much the better / and shall put out of
their hertes all manner of treaty with your enemies. To this counsel the
lord of Mayllayne greed and incontinent he assembled toguyder his men of war
a five hundred spears. And he made captain of the^ an ancient knight called
sir Jacques of Byerne / an expert man of arms / and they rode through the
country privily / and so on a night they entered in to the town of Alexaundre.
They of the town were greatly reioysed of their coming / and good cause why.
Because the earl of Armynake saw no men styrynge in the town. Therefore three
days toguyder they sauted and scrimysshed at the barriers / and yet with the
small nombre that were there / the armynakes were so well resysted that they
wan nothing When sir Jacques de la Byerne and his company were entered in to the
strong cite of Alexaundre and were lodged and refresshed / the governor of the
city and other came to vysite the^ in their lodging. Than sir Jacques
demanded of them the state of the cite / and the demeanor of their enemies /
to take counsel thereupon. The anncient men and most sagest answered and said.
Sir / sith the earl of Armynake has laid siege before us / every day we
have had assautes and scrimysshes before our barryers. Well sirs quod the
knight to morrow we shall se what they will do. They know not of my coming /
I will make a secret issue / and lie in an enbusshe for them. Ah sir quod they
/ ye have need to be ware what ye do / for they are a sixtene thousand horses
/ and if they discover you in the field without any bataile / they shall reyse
such a dust with their horses against you and your company / that ye shall be
clean disconfit among your self. Well quod the knights / to mo. owe we shall
se how the matter shall go. We must do some feate of arms sith we become
hyder. Than every man returned to their lodging / and the knight gave know
ledge to his company / how that the next morning secretly he would issue out
of the city and lie in a buishment in the feldes / and commanded every man to
be ready.

THe next morning sir Jacques dela Bierne armed him and all his company / and
issued out secretly / and with him a ioure hundred / half a mile outs of the
town / and assembled in a valey / and caused other two hundred to abide at ye
barriers. And commanded them / that if their enemies came to assail them /
that they should make but faint defense / and recule back thy derwarde / where
as they would lie in ye busshement. The day was fair and clear and the earl
of Armynake who was young and lusty / after he had herd mass in his pauilyon /
armed him and displayed his penon / and took with him but a hundred men /
thynking that no man should encountre him. And so came with his company before
the barryers little and little / some followed him and some satte still and
said. What need we to arm us / when we come to the barryers we shall se no man
there / and so satte still eating and drinkyng and therle of Armynake went to
scrimysshe before the barryers / and there began to scrimysshe one with
another. and within a short season the defenders began to recule little and
little / till they came to their enbusshe. When sir Jacques de la Bierne saw
his enemies come before him / he discovered himself and set on the acmynagoys
/ who valyauntly defended themself / for always little and little socour came
to them / there was many a feate of arms done. It was on saint Christofers
day / and the day was so hoote that such as were in their harnes / thought
verily they had been in a furnes / the wether was so faint with out wind / so
that the lustyest they had much a do to do any feate of arms. The party of
Myllayne were three against one. The duste and the powder was so great that they
could scante se one a another / and specially they of the earl of Armynakes
part. There fell to the earl a great adventure / he was so oppressed with
heat / that he was so feeble that he could scant help him self / so that he
drew aparte out on the one side of the field and no man with him / and there
found a little river / when he felt the air of the water he thought he was
in paradyse / and sat down alone beside the water / and with much pain did
of his basenet and sat bareheded / and washed his face and drank of ye water
/ whereby he was worse than he was before / for the coldness of the water coled
so his blood that he was faynter thanne he was before / and fell in a paluesy /
so that he lost the strength of his body and speech / and his men had lost
him. there were many taken. After a knight of the duke of Millayns found the
earl of Armynake. When he saw him he had marvel what he was / he parceyued
well he was a knight and a man of honor. Than the knight said. Sir who be you?
yield you ye are my prisoner. The earl understood him not / nor he could not
speak / but he held up his hand / and made token to yield him. The knight
would have had him to rise / but he could not. The knight tarried still with
him while other did fight / in the which battle many a feate of arms was
done.

When sir Jacques de la Bierne who was a sage knight / saw how the journey was
good for his party / and how that a great nombre of his enemies were taken and
slain / and also saw well that his own men world ^ery / and that his enemies
began to multyply with fresshe men / than he reculed toward the city
skrymysshynge and defending. The knight that had taken the earl of Armynake /
thought not to leave him behind / for he thought surely he was some man of
honor / and desired his company to aid him / to bear his prisoner in to ye
town promising them to have part of his ransom. They did so / and with
much pain brought him in to the cite / and was unarmed and laid in a bed.
Than sir Jacques de la Bierne entered in to the city and took his lodging and
unarmed him / and refresshed him and his company. And when the earl of
Armynacke was mist in the host without / they were sore dysmayed / and wist
not what to say nor do / and some came to the place where the battle had been
to seek for him / and returned again clean dyscomfyted. The knight that had
taken the earl of Armynake had great desire to know what man his prisoner was /
and came to another squire that was in likewise taken prisoner a gascon /
desyringe his master to suffer him to go with him to his lodging. so they
went together. The lombarde knight led the squire of France in to a chamber /
and brought him to the bed where the earl of Armynake lay sore complaynyng /
and caused torches to be lyghted up / and than said to the french squire. Sir /
know you not this man? The squire regarded him well and said / I know him
well for I ought so to do / it is our captain the earl of Armynake. With the
which words the lombarde was joyful / but the Earl was so sick that he
understood nothing that was said to him. Than his master said / go we hence
let him rest. Thus they left him / and the same night he dyed / and passed this
transitory life. The next day when it was known that the earl of Armynake was
deed in Alexaunder in his bed / sir Jacques of Bierne would not that his death
should be unknown / but caused it to be publysshed in the host / by such
prisoners as he had / to se what his enemies would do. They of the host were
sore dyscomfyted as they well showed / for as than they had no captain to
draw unto / for they were but companyons gadred of all parts. Than they said
/ let us return and save our self / for we have lost our time. Anon it was
known in the City / how the armynois were disco^fyted / and had no
capytayne. than they armed them / and issued out a horseback and a foot / and
set on the host cryenge Pauy for the lord of Myllayne. There they were taken
and slain without defense. The conquest and botye was great with the
companyons that were come thither with sir Jacques of Bierne the Armynage is
yielded them self without defense and cast away armure and sledde / and were
chased like beasts. Lo what a hard adventure therle of Armynake and his
company bad / and where as his entente was to do well / it turned him to great
yuell. If he had lived five days longer / sir Johan Acton had come to him with
five hundred spears / and a thousand brigandyns a foot / whereby he might
have done many feats of arms / and all lost by hard adventure.

When the duke of Myllayn knew the troth that his enemies were slain and
taken / and specially the earl of Armynake slain / he was joyful thereof / and
loved sir Jacques de Bierne the better in his heart / and made him soueraygne
over all his chyualry / and made him chief of his counsel. The duke of
Myllayne to avoid his country of his enemies / gave to every prisoner that
was a gentylman a horse / and to every other man a florayne and quyted them
clean of their raunsomes / but at their departing he caused them to swear that
they should never after arm them against him. Thus these companions departed
out of Lombardy and Piemount / and entered in to Sauoy and in to the dolpheny /
and had such poverty that it was marueyle for as they passed every town was
closed against them. Anon every man had spent his florayn / some had pytie of
them and did give them alms for charity / and some rebuked and mocked them /
saying. Go your ways seek out your earl of Armynake / who is drinking at a
well before Alexaundre. yet they were in more myschiefe when they came to the
river of Rone they had thought lightly to have passed over in to the realm of
France but they did not for the french king had commanded all the
passages to be closed and kept against them / whereby they fell in great danger
and poverty. After that they could never assemble together again. Thus the
young earl of Armynakes army brake a sonder and his suster abode still in as
yuell case as she was in before. Than ye duke of Myllayne sent for a bishop of
his country / and for such as were most next to the earl of Armynake / as had been there with him at that journey / and the duke commanded that therles body
should be baumed / and sent to his brother sir Barnarde / who was right
sorrowful of those tidings / and good cause why / but there was no remedy.
Than the earl of Armynake was buried in the cathedral church of Rodays / and
there he lies.

IT ought to be known as it has been contained here before in this history /
how sir Thomas Percy was sent by king Richard of England in to the realm of
France / and showed well how he had great affectyon to have a ferme peace
between England and France / and specially two of the king of Englandes
uncles / as the duke of Lancastre and the duke Edmonde of york / but the
kings other uncle the duke of Glocestre and constable of England / would in
no wise acorde to have any peace with the french men / without it were to the
kings honor and theirs / and that there might be rendered again all such
cities / towns / castles / lands and sygnories / which had been given to the
king of England and to his heirs / which falsely had been taken away by the
frenchmen / without tytell or reasone / and beside that the so^me of four
thousand frankes / which was owyng when the frenchmen began the war again.
And of this opinion was diverse lords of England / saying that to ye death
they would iustifye the same. Many said that the duke of Glocestre had good
right and reason to sustain that opinyon / but they dissymuled the matter
couertely / because they saw ye kings mind and affection enclyned greatly to
have peace. But the poor knights and squyers / and archers of England/rather
enclyned to have war / such as had sustained there estates by reason of the
war. Consydre well than / how peace / love / or acorde might be had between
these parties / for the french men in their treaty demanded to have Ealays
beaten down / and to have the sygnorie of Guysnes / Hammes / Mark / and Dye /
and all the lands of Froyton / and the dependantes of Guysnes unto the
lymyttes of the water of Grauelyng. and the french king offered to deliver to
the crown of England as much lands in values in Acquytayn / against which
article yt duke of Gloucestre held and said. The frenchmen will pay us with
our own / for they know well enough how we have charters sealed by king
Johan / and all his children / that all hole Acquytayn should have been
delivered to us / without any resort or soueraynte to any man and all that
ever they have done sithe / has been by fraud and false engyn / and night and
day entende to no other thing but to disceyue us / for if Calays and such
lands as they demand / were delivered in to their hands / they should be
lords of all the sea cost / and than all our conquestes were as nothing / I
shall rather never agree to peace as long as I live.

How sir Peter of Craon fell in the french kings displeasure and in the duke
of Thourayns / and after he was received by the duke of Bretayne. Cap.
C.lxxviii.
IN this said season there was a knight of France of the country of Aniou / a
gentle knight and of noble extraction / called sir Pyer of Craon / marucylously
well beloved / and specially with the duke of Thourayne / for about the duke
no thing was done but by him. Also this knight held a great astate about the
duke of Aniou / who was called king of Naples / Cicyll / and Iherusalem / and
also he was rich. Asclaunder was brought up on him through the realm of
France / how he had robbed the young king of Cycyll duke of Aniou / for the
which brute the said sir Peter absented him self fro the young king and fro
his mather / who had been wife to the old duke of Aniou / how be it he delte
so that he was well-beloved with the french king / and with his brother the
duke of Thourayne. Also the same season sir Olyuer of Clysson / as thanne
constable of France / was greatly in favor with the king and with the duke of
Thourayne / which favor he had get by reason of the good service that he had
done in arms / as well in France as else where / in the kings days and in
his fathers days king Charles / and sir Olyer of Clyssons daughter had wedded
Johan of Bretayne / brother germayne to the queen of Iherusalem / and this sir
Olyuer Clysson by reason of the alyaunce that he had by the marriage of Johan of
Bretayne / was greatly in the duke of Bretayns indignacion / in somoch that the
duke held him for his mortal enemy / and Johan of Bretayne in likewise / and
the duke of Bretayne repented him that he had not slain sir Olyuer of Clysson
when he had him in prisone in his castle of Ermyn. This sir Peter of Craon was
in such favor with the duke of Bretaygne that he might do with him what he
list / he was his cosyn. and while he was in favor with the french king and
with the duke of Thourayn / he would gladly have brought out of the kings
favor sir Olyuer of Clysson the constable / if he could have brought it
about.

THus the enuyous which couertely always has reigned in France / dissymuling
their matters till they come to an yuell conclusion. The constable of France
had always ben so true in all his deeds to ye crown of France / that every
manne loved him / except the duke of Burgoyn / who loved him nothing. the
hatred came by the duches of Burgoyne / who was a lady of high courage / for she
could not love the Constable / for the duke of Bretayne was nere of blod to
her / and all that her father the earl of Flaunders loved she loved / and such
as he hated she did the same / she was of that condycion. This sir Peter of
Craon while he was in the french court / and great with the duke of Thourayne
/ he wrote often times to the duke of Bretayne secretly every thing that he
knew / and the duke wrote again to him. Theffecte of their writings I could
not know / how be it I Johan Froy sart auctor of this hystory / on a time when
I was at Paris / on a night when a great myschefe was lykely to have fallen
upon sir Olyuer Clysson constable of France / by a marvelous enterprise of
sir Peter of Craon / as I shall herafter more plainly declare / when time shall
require. And because I saw the matter dark and obscure / and lykely to be
great trouble and danger / I did all the pain I could to know the ground
and occasyon of the matter / why sir Peter of Craon was so suddenly banysshed
fro the french kings love and the duke of Thourayns. Such search I made and
such enquery of them that knew the matter / that some of them enfourmed me of
the troth as the fame and renome ran. First the duke of Thourayn was
dyspleased with this sir Peter of Craon through his own fault / for he
dysclosed the secretnesse that was between the duke of Thourayne and another
lady. If he did so he did yuell.

THe duke of Thourayne as than had such favor to sir Peter of Craon / that he
took him as his companyon / and ware ever like apparel / and had him always
with him where so ever he went / and showed him all his secrets. This Duke of
Thourayn as than was young and amorous / and gladly would company with ladies
and damsels / and sport him among them / and specially as it was showed me /
he loved entierly a fair lady of Paris / young and fressh. His love and
secrets were known in such wise that it turned to great dysplesure to the
duke / and he wyste not whom to blame but sir Peter of Craon / for the duke
had showed him all his secrets in that matter / and had taken him in his
company / when he would secretly speak with the said young lady. The duke on a
time promised the said lady a thousand crowns of gold / so that he might
have his pleasure of her. But the lady as than refused it and said / how she
loved him not for his gold nor silver / but pure love enclyned her to bear
him her good will / but as for gold or silver she would not sell her honor.
All these words and promesses were known by the duches of Thourayne / who
incontinent sent for the said young lady in to her chamber. Than she called her
by her name / and in great displeasure said. Will thou do me wrong with my
lord my husband? The young lady was abashed / and all weeping said. Nay
madame by the grace of god / I never did think it nor never will. than the
duchess said. Thus it is / Iame enfourmed that my lord my husband loves you
/ and you him / and the matter so far gone between you / that in such a place
and at such a time he promised you a thousa^de crowns of gold to have his
pleaser of you / how be it ye did refuse it as than / wherein ye did wisely and
therefore as at this time I perdon you / but I charge you as derely as ye love
your life / yt ye commune nor talk no more with him / but suffer him to pass
/ and herkyn not to his comunynge. Than when the young lady saw her self
accused of troth she answered and said. Madame / I shall deliver me fro him as soon as I can / and shall so / deal that ye shall have no cause of dyspleasure
in this matter. Therewith the duchess gave her leave to depart / and so she
returned to her lodgyng. The duke of Thourayne who knew nothing of this matter
/ and as he yt entierly loved this young lady / fortuned on a day to come where
as she was. When she saw him she eschewed his company / and made him no
manner of semblant of love / but did clean contrary to that she had used before
/ for she durst not / and also she had sworn and promised / to the duches.
When the duke saw her countenance he was pensive / and thought he would know
why she delte so straungely / and demanded of her the cause of her straungnes.
The young lady all weeping said. Syrye have bewrayed your love / and the
secret promise an offer that ye made me / to my lady your wife / or else some
other / remember you well to whom ye have showed your secretnesse / for sir I
was in great danger by my lady your wife / and by none other / and I have
sworn and promised her that after this time I will never company nor talk
with you / whereby she should have any ielousy. when the duke hard yt they were
sore words to him / and greatly to his displeasure and said. Ah my sayre lady
/ I swear to you by my faith / that rather than this matter should have been
showed to my wife / that I had lost a hundred thousand frankes / sithe ye
have sworn / keep your promise / for what so ever it cost me I will know
the troth who has bewrayed our secrets.

THus the Duke departed fro the young lady / and made no se^blant as than / but
pacyentely suffered / how be it he thought the more. and at night came to his
wife to supper / and showed her more token of love than ever he did before / and
he did somoche with fair words that the duchess showed him all the matter /
and how that she knew it by sir Peter of Craon. than the duke spoke no more
at that time. that night passed / and the next day about nine of the clock /
he took his horse and rode fro the house of saint Poll to the castle of Lowre
/ where he found the king his brother heryng of mass. The king swetelye
received him / for he loved him entyerly / and the king saw well by the dukes
manner that he had some dyspleasure in his mind / and said. Ah fair brother.
what is the matter? it seems ye be troubled. Sir quod he good cause why.
Wherefore quod the king I pray you show me. The duke who would hyde no thing
fro the king / showed him all the hole matter / and complained greatly against
sir Peter of Craon / and said. Sir by the faith that Iowe to god and to you /
if it were not for your honor I would slay him. We shall do well enough quod
the king / he shall be warned by our counsel to avoid our house and service
/ and in likewise cause him to avoid your house and company. I am well content
with this quod the duke. The same day the lord de la River and sir Johan
Mercyer said unto sir Peter of Craon on the kings behalf / that he should
avoid the kings court and service / and go where he list. In likewise sir
Johan of Buell and the lord of Dernaulx seneschall of Thourayne / gave him like
commandment / on the duke of Thourayns behalf. When sir Peter of Craon saw
this he was abashed and took it in great dyspyte / and could not ymagyn why
it should be. And true it was / he desired to come in to the kings presence
and the dukes / to know the cause of their dyspleasure. But he was answered
that another the king nor the duke would not here him speak. When he saw none
other remedy he apparelled him self / and departed out of Paris in great
displeasure in his heart / and so rode into Aniou to a castle of his own
called Sable / and tarried there a season fore troubled in his mind. He saw
well he was chased out of the french court / and out of the house of Thourayn
/ and also out of the house of the queen of Naples and Iherusalem. than when he
parceyued these three howses closed fro him / he thought to go to the duke of
Bretaygne his cosyn / and to show him all his adventures. so he did / and rode
in to Bretayne / and found the duke at Wannes / who made him good chere / and
knew somewhat before of his trouble. And than this sir Peter showed him all the
case. When the duke of Bretaygne had well herd all the matter / he said. Fair
cosyn recomforte your self / all this is surely brought about by sir Olyuer
of Clysson.

THis rote and foundacyon of hatred multyplyed greatly after / as ye shall here
in this hystory. Sir Peter of Craon tarried so long with the duke of Bretaygne
/ that he forgate France / for the constable sir Olyuer of Clysson and the
kings counsel were against him / and also they were not content with the
duke of Bretayne in that he kept sir Peter Craon in his house. As for the duke
of Bretaygne cared not greatly / neither for the good will nor yuell will of
the French king / he provided suffyciently for his cities / towns / and
castelles / in such wise / that he loved as well war as peace. And all that
ever he did was well known in France / and with the kings counsel. and
such as were next about the king reputed the duke of Bretaygne proud and
presumptuous / and thretened him greatly / but the duke did set little
thereby / and said / that he would make war against the earl of Pointhieur in
a just quarrel / for the earl of Pointhyeur our cosyn / writes and names him
self Johan of Bretayne / as though he were herytour of this country. I will
he be called Johan / for that is his name and earl of Pointhieur / and I will
he put out of his arms the Ermyns / and write himself Johan of Bloys or of
Chatellon / and none other. and if he will not do thus I shall cause him to do
it / and take fro him his land / for he holds it by faith and homage of us
/ as for the heritage of Bretaygne he has nothing to do therewith / so that
it should return to him / for I have both sons and daughters that shall be
mine heirs. Let him purchase him lands in some other place / for as of this
he has failed. Thus often times the duke of Bretayne would deuyse with sir
Peter of Craon / who would not replye against his pleasure / but rather did
further it / and all for the yuell will that he bare to the constable sir
Olyuer of Clysson / and to the counsel of France.

Now let us leave speaking of this matter and treat a little of another
pytuous matter concerning the earl Guy of Bloys / of whom mencyon is made here
before in this hystory.

Of the death of the young earl Loyes of Chastelone / son to the earl Guy of
Bloys. Cap. C.lxxix.
IT has been showed here before in this hystory / whan^e I spoke of the
alyau^ce and marriage of Lois of Chatellon / son to the earl of Bloys / married
to ye lady Marye / daughter to duke Johan of Berrey / and at the confyrmacyon
of this marriage the duke of Berrey provided greatly for his daughter / for she
was assigned for her dowry in the cou^tie of Bloys / the sum of six
thousand pound money / corante in France / to be paid in florayns / if the
foresaid Loys of Bloys dyed before his wife. than all the county of Blois to
be bound to pay these foresaid sire thousand frankes. And so it fortuned that
about the feast of saint Johan the Baptyste in the year of our lord god a
thousand three hundred fourscore and a leven / this young Loys of Bloys son
to the earl Guy / departed fro his father fro the castle of Moltyz in Bloys to
go in to Haynalt / to se his mother and wife / and when he came to Beaumonte in
Haynault he fell sick of a fever / by reason that he had rydden great iourneys
/ and the season was boot / and he was but yuell kept / and but tender of age
/ as of xiiii. years / by which syckenes he dyed with out help / for the
physycions could not put a way his hot fever. ye may well know that the
father and mother were right soroufull / when they knew of the death of their
son and heir. In likewise so was his wife the young lady of Berrey / who
loved him entierly / and thought her self hyghtly married / specially the
trouble of the father was right great / for he ymagyned that the duke of Berrey
was right couetouse / and feared lest he would enter in to the county of
Bloys / and put him out for the dowry of his daughter. Thus the duke of Berreys
two daughters were both wydowes in one year / the eldest called Boesme was
countess of Sauoy / and her husband the young earl of Sauoy called Ame dyed
the same year right marvelously / of whose death there came great business /
and it was laid to sir Oath of Grau^ ^ome / in such wise that he was feign to
fly out of Sauoy / and out of France and Almayne / and so went and dwelte in
the realm of England.

Of the sudden death of the Earl Gascon of Foiz / and how the earl of
Chastellon came to then herytau^ce. Cap. C.lxxx.
THe same seasone also dyed the noble and gentle earl of Foiz right
marvelously / I shall show you by what incydente. Truly of all sportes this
Earl loved hu^tynge with hounds and gray hounds / and of them he was well
provided / for always he had at his commandment mo than.xvi. hundred. The
earl as than was at Barrey / in the marches of Orthays / and went daily a
hunting in to the woods of Saluaterra / the way to Panpylona in Nauerre / and
the same day that he dyed he had hunted and killed a bear / and by that time
it was high noone. Than the earl demanded of them that were about him where
his dinner was provided. It was showed him at the hospytall of Ryon / a two
little miles fro Ortays / and so thither he rode to dinner / and so a lyghted
there and went in to his chamber / the which was strawed with grene herbs /
and the walls set full of grene bows / to make the chamber more fressh /
for the air without was marvelously hot as in the month of May. When he
felt that fresshe air he said. A this fresshnesse does me much good / for
the day has been very hoote / and so sat down in a chair. Than he talked
and devised with sir Espayne du lion of his hounds / which had run best /
and as he thus devised / there ca^e in to the chamber sir Ienbayne his bastard
son and sir Peter of Cabestan / and the tables were ready covered in the same
chamber. Than water was brought forth to wasshe / and Coiandon of Spaygne took
asyluer basin and sir Tybaulte took the towell. Than the earl rose and put out
his hands to wasshe / and as soon as the cold water fell on his fyngars / he
waxed pale in the face / and suddenly her heart failed him / and so fell down
/ and in the falling said. Ah I am but deed. God have mercy on me: He never
spoke word after / how be it he dyed not so soon / but lay in great pain.
The knights that were about him were sore abashed and so was his soon: They
took him in their arms and laid him on a bed and covered him / trusstynge
that he was but in a trance. The.ii. knights that had given him water / to
the intent that it should not be said that they had enpoysoned him / took the
basin and the ewer and said / Sirs / here in your presence behold here this
water / the which we took assaye of and yet will do. And there they dra^ke
thereof / so that every man was content with them. They put in to the earls
mouth drink and spyces / and other things comfortable / but all that aueyled
nothing. For in less than half an hour he was deed / and yielded up his
brethe swetely. God of his pytie have mercy on him. all such as were there were
greatly troubled and abashed. Than they closed the Chamber door / to the
intent that his death should not be so suddenly known abroad. The knights
beheld sir Ienbayne his son / who wept pituously and wrang his hands. And
the knights that were with him said. Sir Ienbayne / ye have now lost your
father: We know well he loved you entierly. Leave your sorrow / and leap on
your horse and ride to Orthayes. Take you possessyon of the castle and of your
fathers treasoure that is within it / or ever the death of your father be
known abroad. Sir Ienbayne enclyned to those words and said. Sirs I thank
you of your good couusaile the which I shall deserve. But than^e let me have
some token that is on my father / or else I shall not be suffered to enter in
to the castle. That is true sir quod they / take so^e token fro your father.
Than he took a ring fro his fathers finger / and a Knyfe that he bare always
about him. These tokens the porter of the castle knew well: If he had not
brought them / he should not have enered in there.

THus sir Ienbayne of Foiz deperted from the hospytall of Ryone and three with
him / and rode in haste to the castle of Orthayes. He rode through the town
/ no man mystrusted him / and so came to the Castle and called the Porter /
who answered and said. sir / what would you have? Where is my lord your
Father? He is at the hospytall of Ryon quod the knight / and has sent me for
certain things that is in his chamber: and than I must return again to him.
And to the intent that thou should believe me / Behold here his ring and
knyfe. The porter opyned a wyndowe and saw the tokyns: which he knew well.
Than the porter opyned the wicket and he entered in / and his varlettes did set
up his horse. As soon as he was entered he said to the porter. Close again
the gate. Than he took the porter and said. Deliver me the kayes / or else thou
art but deed. The porter was abashed and said. Sir / why say ye thus?
Because quod he my father is deed / and I will have ye possessyon of his
treasour / or any other come here. The porter obeyed for he durst do none
otherwise and he loved sir Ienbayne as well as another. The knight knew right
well where the treasour lay / which was in a strong tower / whereto belonged
three strong doors / surely bolted and barred / and diverse kayes parteynyng to
them. Which kayes he could not find redely / for they were in a cofer of
stele / and locked with a little kaye of Stele. which kaye the earl ever bare
on him / whersoeuer he went / in a little purse about his neck. Which
(after sir Ienbayne was departed fro the hospytall) was found by the knights
that were about the deed corse. tha^ they marueyled what kaye it should be that
the earl bare so privily about him self. than therles chapelayne called sir
Nicholas of Escall / who knew all the earls secrets (for the earl loved him
well / and ever when he went in to his treasorie house / he had his chapelayne
with him) said / As soon as he saw the kaye. Ah / sir Ienbayne has but lost
his pain / for this is the kaye of a little cofer wherein are all the kayes of
the Tower and cofer / where all the Earls treasour lies. Than the knights
said. Sir Nicholas. Go and ride you to Orthayes and bear him the kaye. Sirs
quod he / sithe ye give me the counsel I shall do it / for it were better he
had his fathers treasoure than another: and also I know well his father loved
him entierly Than he took his horse and took the kaye and rode to the castle
of Or^hayes. And all that season sir Ienbayne was sertchynge all about for
they kayes / and could not find the^ / nor wist not how to get the tower
door opyn / it was so strong: nor also he had no instruments to break it
opyn with all. And in this mean season the men of the town had soon
knowledge / by varlettes or women that came / to the hospytall / how therle
should be deed. These were hard tidings to them / for the earl was well-beloved
withal his people. They of the town assembled to guyder in the markette place
/ and said one to another / such as had seen sir Ienbayn pass through the
town alone. We have seen sir Ienbayne pass through the town alone toward
the castle / and it seemed by his councynaunce he was not content. Surely there
is some thing a mysse / sor he was not wont to come home before his father.
Thus as they were co^munynge toguyder / there came in to the town the Earls
chapelayne. Than^e the men of the town came about him and demanded news of
therle their lord. It has been showed us that he is deed. Is it so or not?
Nay quod the priest he is not deed / but he is sore sick / and I am come home
before to cause things to be dressed for him / and than I must return
again to him. And so therewith he passed forth to the castle / and did so
much that he entered / of whose coming sir yuan had great joy / For without
the kaye that he brought he could not have entered in to the Tower where as the
treasour was. Than the men of the town had great suspecte of the Earls death
and said. It is nere hand night / and as yet we here nothing of our lord /
nor of none of his officers / and sir yuan and his chapelayne are entered in to
the castle suspeciously. Let us watch the castle this night / and to morrow
we shall here other tidings. Let us send secretly to ye hospital / than
shall we know how the matter gothe. Also we know well / the most part of
the earls treasour is with in the Castle / and if it be stolen away by
craft / we shall be blamed for it. Ignorance shall not excuse us. They all
thought it was best for them so to do. Than^e the men of the town drew about
the castle and kept the gates of the town surely / that none should enter
nor issue without license. Thus they watched all night / and in the morning
they had parfyte knowledge of the death of their lord. Than every man / woman
/ and child cried out and wept pituously / for the Earl was well-beloved. Than
the watchmen doubled and increased in harness about the castle.

When sir yuan of Foize saw the manner of the men of the town / and saw well
how he was perceived / and that they knew the certayntie of the death of his
father. Than he said to sir Nycholas. Sir / I have failed of mine intent / I
se well I can not depart hens without license. The men of the town have
knowledge of my fathers death / and they assemble in great nombre before ye
castle. It behooves me to humble my self to them / for force can not aueyle
me. sir / ye say truth quod the priest: ye shall wyn more by sweet and fair
word / than by rude and froward dealing. Go your way and speak with them.
Than sir yuan went in to a tower nere to the gate / and opyned a wyndowe over
the bridge / in the which tower he was brought up in / till he married the lady
Jane of Boloyne / who afterward was duchess of Berrey: as ye shall here after
in this history. Sir yuan opyned the wyndowe and spoke to them that were the
princypals of the town / who ca^e on the bridge nere to the window / to here
what he would say. Than he spoke a loud and said. O ye good people of
Orthays / I know well the cause of your asse^bly: it is not without a great
occasion: how be it I require you as derely as ye loved my lord and father /
that ye be not displeased with me / though I have aduaunsed my self to enter
in to this castle first / or any other shude enter / and to take possession
thereof / and of such goods as be within it / for I will do nothing but good.
ye know well my lord my father loved me as well and entierly / as his own
son / and would feign have found the ways to have made me his enherytour.
And now it has pleased god to call him to his mercy / without accomplysshyng
of any thing of mine advancement: And now he has left me among you /
where I have been brought up / and left now as a poor knight / bastard
son to the earl of Foize / without I have your aid and help. Wherefore sirs
/ I require you in gods behalf to have pytie on me / wherein ye shall do
great alms. And I shall open the castle and suffer you to enter / I will
not keep it against you. Than they answered and said. Sir yuan / ye have
spoken so nobly / that it ought to suffyce. And sir / we say that we will
abide with you / and our intent is to keep this castle and goods with you.
And if the Vicount of Chastellon your cosyn / who is next enherytoure to this
country of Byerne / as next parente to your father come hyder / to challenge
his heritage and mouables / or he have it / he shall know well how we shall
defend you and your right / fro him and fro your brother sir Gracyen. But we
suppose / that whan^e the French king was last at Tholous / and my lord
your Father with him / that some order was takenne / as touching your fathers
enherytaunce: And this can sir Roger of Spaygne your cosyn tell / no man better
than he. We shall write to him and show him of the death of the earl your
father / and desire him to come hyder to help and counsel us in all things
/ concerning the lands of Bierne and of Foiz / and also for the mouables: and
for thentierment of my lord your father. And this we promise you faithfully
to uphold. With this answer sir yuan was well content: And thanne opyned
the gate of the Castle of Orthayes / and such entered as would: And the same
day the Earls body was brought thither. At the metyng of the corse / men and
women wept pituously / in the remembrance of his nobleness and puyssaunt
estate: His wit and prudence / his Prowess and largess / and the great
prosperyte that he lived in: For there was nouther French nor English that
durst dysplease him. Most part of the people said. Now our neighbors will
make us war / where as we were wont to live in peace and fredome. Now shall
we be in bondage / in misery / and subiectyon. Now there is none to aid us.

AH Gascone Gascone fair son^e. Why did ye ever so dysplease your father / yt
it cost you your life. If ye had been left with us it should now have been to
us a great comfort but we lost you to young / and your father has tarried to
short a season with us. He was but threscore and three years of age. He might
have lived for any age / many a year lengar. It was no great age for such a
prince / having every thing at his ease and wysshe. Ah thou land of Bierne /
destytute and without conforte of any noble herytour. What shall become of the?
Thou shalt never have again such another / as was this gentle earl of Foiz.
With such lamentacions and wepynges / the body of this Noble Earl was borne
through the town of Orthayes / by eight noble knights. The first the
Vycounte of Brunyquell / and against him the lord of Compayne. The third sir
Roger of Spaygne / and against him sir Raymonde of Laysne. The fyfthe sir
Raymonde de la Mote / against him the lord of Besache. The seuenthe sir
Menault of Noualles / and against him Richard of saint George. And behind was
sir yuan his bastard son. The lord of Corase. The lord of Barantyne. The
lord of Baruge. the lord of Quere / and mo than threscore other knights of
Byerne / who were soon come to the hospytall of Ryone / when they knew of the
Earls death. Thus he was carried with open vysage to the freers in Orthayes / and
there he was enbaumed and laid in leed / and so left under good keeping /
unto the day of entierment. And night and day without cease / there was
brinnynge about his body / four and twenty torches borne by eight and forty
yomen. Four and twenty in the night / and four and twenty in the day.

THe death of this noble earl of Foiz / was anon known in diverse countries /
and mo were rather sorry of his death than glad / for he had in his days
given such gifts / so liberally / that it could not be eschewed: wherefore he
was be loved of every man that knew him. Pope Clement when he knew of his
death was right soroufull for him because he had taken great pain in
fortherynge of the marriage / of his cosyn Jane of Boloygne / who was duchess
of Berrey. The same season there was at Auignon the bishop of Palms / who
durst not com at his benifyce for a displeasure that the earl of Foize had to
him / and yet he was of his lynage. The cause was / the bysshopp^ would have
exalted his jurisdiction and abated therles / for all that therle made him
bishop. Than the pope sent for the bishop to come to his palais / and when
he was come the pope said. Sir bishop of Palms / your peace is made / the
earl of Foiz is deed. Of those tidings the bishop was glad / and within a
short season after he departed fro Auignon / and went to his bysshoprike in
to the country of Foize. Tidings of the death of this earl was anon come
into France to the king / and to his counsel. The French king and his
brother / and the duke of Burbone were sorry of his death / because of his
nobleness. Than the counsel said to the king. Sir / the cou^tie of Foiz is
yours by right succession / seeing the earl of Foiz is deed without heir of his
body laufully begotten / no man can debate with you therein. Also they of the
county think the same. And sir / there is one thing that helps gretlye your
tytell / ye have lend there on fyftie thousand frankes. Sir / send and take
possessyon of your guage / and keep it as your own enherytau^ce. For they of
the same country desire to be under your hand. It is a fair country and
shall come to you to good purpose / for it marches nere to the Realm of
Arragone / and also to Chattelone. And paraduenture here after ye may hap to
have war with the king of Arragon. Than the county of Foiz shall be a good
fronter / for therein be many fair and strong castelles to keep in men of
war / and to make good garysons. The king herd well those words / and anon
enclyned to their counsel / and said. Sirs / let se / whom shall we send
on this message. Than^e it was determined to send ye lord de la River /
because he was known in that country / and with him the bishop of Noyon.
These two lords prepared them self to go on this legacyon. and whan^e they
departed they rode at leysar by small iourneys / and took their way by Auignon.

IN this mean season word was sent to the Vicount of Chastellon / being in
the realm of Arragon / of the death of his cosyn the earl of Foiz. Than he
rode till he ca^e in to Bierne / straight to Orthays. They of the town made
him good chere / how be it they took him not as than for their lord / and
said / how all the country was not assembled / and that first they must
assemble toguyder the prelates / lords / and men of the good Towns / and to
counsel toguyder what they should do. Saying: that is a good country that
holds of him self / and the lords that dwells therein / and has herytages
to be free. Than^e it was aduysed for the best. First to make the entierment of
the earl Gascone of Foiz at Orthays / and to send for all the nobles of Bierne
and of Foize / such as would come / and than to take counsel who^ they
should accept for their lord. Than all barons and prelates / and heedes of
good towns of Bierne and of Foiz were sent for. They of Bierne ca^e thither /
but they of Foiz refused to come there and said / they would keep their
country. For they herd say the French king would send thither to challenge
they country of Foiz. How be it the bishop of Palms was desired to come to
Orthais / because of lynage / and so he came thither in good array / as to him
apparteyned.

The day of the obsequy of the gentle earl Gascon of foiz / last earl of that
name / done in the freres in the town of Orthays / the year of our lord god /
a thousand three hundred fourscore and a.xi. on a monday. There was much
people of the country of Bierne and of other places / both lords / knights
/ and other prelates. There were four bisshoppes the bishop of Palms who said
the mass / and the bysshoppes / of Air / of Auron / and of Tenues in Bierne.
There was a goodly hearse and well ordered. And during the mass time / there was
holden before the altar by four knights four baners / with the arms of Foiz
and of Bierne. The first held sir Raymon of Newcastell. The second sir
Espaygne du Lion. The third sir Peter deguier. The fourth sir Menaulte of
Noualles. sir Roger of Spaygne offered the sword / between the Bourge of
Campaigne and Pier of Arnaulte of Bierne / captain of Lourde. The shield bare
the Vicount of Bruniquell between sir Johan of Newcastell and John^ of
Chanteron. The helm offered the lord of Vale^tyne and of Bierne / between
Arnalton of Rostem and Arnalton of saint Colombe. The horse was offered by the
lord of Corase / between Arnalton of Spain and Raymonet of Campaygne. This
entierment was honorably done / according to the usage of ye country: and there
were the two bastard sons of the earl of Foiz / sir yua^ and sir Gracien /
and the Vicount of Chastel^on / and all the barons of Bierne and some of Foiz.
But as soon as the service was done / they of Foiz departed and rode the same
day to dinner to Herytell / two miles fro Orthais. and ye next day be times the
bishop of Palms deperted / he would not be at the general perlyament
which was the same day a monge them of Bierne. Thus the earl was buried in ye
freers before the high altar. So there is no more mention made of him / god
have mercy upon his soul. Now let us speak of the order that was taken at
Orthais.

AS it was informed me / it was said to the Vycount of Chatelion. Sir / we
know well that as next of blood ye ought to succeed in the herytages / as well
of Bierne as of Foiz: But as now we can not receive you as our lord / for
thereby we might bring the land of Bierne in to great trouble / war / and
danger. For as we do understand / the French king who is our good neighbor
does se^de hyder of his counsel / we know not for what intent / till we
here them speak. We know well and so do you that our lord the earl / whom
god pardone / was this last year at Tholous with the french king / and had
secret co^munycacion toguyder / the which first has need to be declared /
for if he have given and released to the French king Foiz and Bietne / the
king than with puissance will have and obtain it. Wherefore or we do any thing
we will know the artycles / for we of Byern be in other case and of other
co^dycion than they of Foiz. We be all fre without homage or seruytude / and
the county of Foiz is holden of the French king: and also the people of Foiz
their hertes be so French / that lightly they will receive the french king to
their lord and soucraygne: For they have said sith the earl was deed / he
has none heritour of his body laufully gotten. Wherefore the county of Foize
they say / should parteyne to the ordynau^ca of the French king. But sir we
shall keep our hold / and we will serve no lord but such as we ought to do /
wheder it be the french king or you. But sir / we will counsel you to work
wisely in this business / by treaty or otherwise. Than the Vycount said. sirs
/ by what means will ye counsel me to work / for I have promised to work
by your advise in every thing / according to reason. sir quod they / we will
advise you to desire sir Roger of Spaygne your cosyn to keep you company / at
your cost and charge. And go in to the county of Foiz and treat with the
prelates and noble men / and with them of the good towns / that they would
receive you to their lord / or else to sytte still and dissymule the matter
till ye have apeased ye french king / and taken with him some co^posicion / by
means of gold and silver / that ye might have the enheritaunce in rest and
peace. if ye do thus than do ye wisely / and if ye may be herd with them that
be sent fro the French king in to the county of Foize / though it cost you
a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand frankes / ye shall find enough
to pay it with all / For the earl that is deed / has left enough behind
him. How beit sir / in any wise we will that his two bastard sons have
part largely of his goods. Than the lord answered and said. Sirs / I am
content as ye will. And here is my cosyn sir Roger of Spaygne / and in all
your presences / I desire him to ride with me in this journey. Than sir Roger
answered and said. Sir / I am content to ride with you to be as mean between
both perties. But if the French king my sovereign lord or his ambassadors
desire me to be of their counsel / orels command me not to medell / than I
must needs leave you. The Vycount was content and said. Cosyn / I trust they
will not against your will take you fro me. and if I may have you nere me / I
think to make a good end of all my business.

THan (as I was informed) the Vycount of Chastellon made a request before the^
all / to borowe five or.vi. thousand frankes to perform his journey. Also the
two bastardes made their request / that they might have part of their fathers
richesse. Than the counsel took advise togider / and at last acorded that the
Vicou^t should have five thousand frankes: And the two bastardes of Foiz each
of them two thousa^de frankes and inco^tynent the tre^ourers were commanded to
deliver the money. All officers that were in the Earls days / were suffered to
occupy still without any chaungyng and than kepers were set to keep the
castle of Orthais / and the richesse that was within it. The Vicount at his
first coming to Orthais / gave pardon to all the prisoners with in the
castle / whereof there were a great nombre. For the earl of Foiz was a cruel
man and would spare no man / but to punysshe at his pleasure / though he were
never so great a personage. He had ones in prisone the said Vycount of
Chastellon in the botome of a dongion / eight months / for all that he was
his cosyn germayne. And whan^c he delivered him / he set him to rau^some
at.xl. thousa^de frankes / which was truly paid. And also as long as he
lived he loved him never after / so that the Vicount durst never come in his
sight / for if the earl had lived two years lengar / the Vicount should never
have had any part of ye heritage of Foiz or of Bierne.

THus this counsel at Orthays brake up / and every man departed and left the
Vycount to prepare for his journey / who made him ready as soon as he might /
and desired certain knights and squiers to go with him. Thus he departed fro
Orthais with a two hundred horse / and rode to Moriens a good town on the
fronter / between Byerne and Bygore / a four miles fro Pauy and a six mile fro
Tarbe. And the second day he rode to saint Gausens / another good town at the
enter of the cou^tie of Foiz on the river of Garone. and there tidings came to
him how the bishop of Noyon / and sir Buryaulx de la River and other of ye
French kings counsel were come to Tholous. Than the Vycount took counsel
of sir Roger of Spain what was best for him to do: sir Roger answered and
said. Sith we have herd tidings of them / let us tarry here and se what they
will do. I think they will send shortly to us: and so there they tarried /
for in deed they could go no further in to the county of Foiz / for all the
good towns / castelles and passages were closed against them: As Calumuche /
Casteres / Mou^ttesquen / Carthas / Ortyngas / Fossat / the city of Palms and
the castle / Montaunt / and all the castles on the fronter of Aragon. they of
the county of Foiz said / that no stranger with any puissaunce should enter
in to no castle nor town of their country / till the matter were determined.
and as they of the country showed themself they were better minded to be
French / and to be governed by a seneschall (as the country and city of
Tholous was / and Carcasson and Beauuoyre) rather than to be under any other
ruler. How be it the matter went otherwise / as ye shall here. For when the
French kings co^myssaries were come to Tholous they demanded news of the
archebysshoppe / and of the seneschall of Foiz and of Bierne / and of other /
such as had been at Orthays at the buryeng of the earl of Foiz. There they were
informed in what case the country stood in. Than they took advise together / and
determined to send for sir Roger of Spaygne / because he was the French
kings man by faith and homage / and his oftycer / as seneschall of
Carcassone. They sent a credable person with a letter to him. The messanger
rode to saint Gausens / a.xii. mile fro thens. Than he delivered to sir Roger
of Spaygne his letter / sir Roger took and reed it / and said to ye squire Sir
/ ye shall tarry here all this day and to morrow ye shall depart / I think ye
shall not go without company. Than sir Roger and the Vycount counsayled
toguyder. Than it was thought for the best that sir Roger of Spain should
ride to Tholous and speak there with the bishop of Noyon and with the Lord de
la River / to know what they would say. The next day ser Roger of Spain and
the messanger rode forth together / and came y^ same night to Toulouse. Sir
Roger took up his lodgyng / and the messanger went to his masters. Than the
co^myssioners said to morrow we shall here tidings / seeing sir Roger is come.
The next day after mass sir Roger drew to the bishop and to the lord de la
River / and made good chere each to other / because they were all of
aquayntaunce / and there communed the cause of their coming. Than the kings
co^myssyoners showed forth the kings procuracions / and how they were set and
stablysshed to take possessyon and season of the county of Foiz. and when sir
Roger had well herd them at length / he replied with sweet words and said.
Lords I am not so nere of ye kings counsel as ye be / and if I were saving
your correction / I would counsel the king that he should take again his
money / and somewhat more (true it is he has lent money on the heritage of
Foize / to be raised after the death of the earl) yet let the king leave the
right of the enherytaunce to the next enherytoure of the blood / this shall be
for the kings profit / honor / and salvation / and in this that I say / I
shall lay diverse reasons / if ye will here it. There is one thing which is
clear / the earl of Foiz laid his land to pledge by fraud / for as for gold
and silver he had enough / for that he did was for nothing but to dysheryte
the Vicount of Chastellon wrongfully / because he hated him without cause. Also
as touching the kings profit / I ensure you the keeping of the land of Foize
should cost the king more than the rentes or revenues comes unto. And
thyrdly the king shall lose thereby the homage and service of such a man as is
able to do him good service / this ought to be well regarded. also it should be
a great charge to the kings consyence to dysheryte any person / without a
reasonable cause / for if the heritage of Foiz should have been bought and sold
/ first all such as claymeth any right therein should have been a greed with
all and satyfyed / which was not so. wherefore my lords these reasons well
consydred / seeing ye be great wise men and counsaylours to the king / take
good head what ye do / or ye pronounce any thing that should turn to the
kings sclaunder / or hurt to his conscience / if ye do otherwise it were
great sin / and as yet there is time suffycyente to find remedy. My cosyn
the Vicount of Chastellon / has sent me hither to you / to show you this
matter / and right effectuously desires you / and so do I in his name / to take
regard in this behalf. It is not good nor conuenyent a man to take every
thing byforce / that he may take. When he had said / than the bishop and
the lord de la River looked on each other / at last the bishop said. Sir
Rodger / we se and know well that all that ye have said is for good entente /
but our co^myssyon stretches not so far to quyte the bargayne that was
between the king and therle of Foize / how be it for the love of you / and to
bring the matter somewhat to good purpose / and that all parties might be
content / we shall put this matter in suffraunce / and ye shall take the pay^e
to ride with us into France to the king and to his counsel / and than show
there your reasons as ye shall think best / and if by your means ye can cause
the vycount of Chastellon to enjoy the heritage of Foiz / who is enherytoure
thereto / as ye say / we shall be right glad thereof / for we will dysheryte
no person. Syrs quod sir Roger I am well content with your saying / if it
please you to abide here a season / your costs shall be borne of the good that
is in the castle of Orthays.

THe third day sir Roger of Spain took leave of the kings co^myssyoners and
said. Syrs / I think to bring this matter to a good purpose / I must be feign
to make a journey into France / if I tarry long I pray you be not myscontent /
for it shall not be in my fault / and I shall send you daily messangers and
letters. Thus they departed / they tarried at Tholous / and sir Roger rode to
saint Gausens to the Vycount of Chastellon / and showed him all the matter. the
Vycount was joyful of those tidings and said. Fair cosyn sir Roger / all my
trust is in you the matter touches me nere it is for thenherytaunce whereof I
bear the arms / I can not tell whom to send in to France / but all only
you to show my title to the king and to his counsel / wherefore sir for the
love of me / and for that I may deserve to you in time to come / take on you
the charge of this voyage: sir Rodger said. Sir for the love of you and of your
lynage I shall do it. Than sir Roger prepared for his journey to ride in to
France and so took the way to Rodes / and the shorter way / for as than truce
was between France and England / or else the way that he took had not been
sure for him / for on the fronters of Rouuergue / Quercy / and Lymosyn / there
were many fortresses that made war for the Englysshemen. Now I will leave
for a season speaking of sir Roger of Spain / and speak of the french king /
and of the duke of Bretayne.

How the treaty of peace renewed at Towers in Thourayn / between the French
king and the duke of Bretayne and of the marriage of the daughter of France to
the lonne of Bretayne / and of John^ of Bretayne earl of Pointhieur and the
daughter of the duke of Bretaygne. Cap. C.lxxxi.
YE have herd here before in diverse places in this hystory / how the duke of
Bretayne and sir Olyuer of Clysson / as than constable of France / hated
mortally each other / and beside the hatred that the duke had to sir Olyuer /
he had great envy that he was so great with the king / and so secret of his
counsel / and gladly he would have troubled him / but he doughted ye kings
displeasure / and often times the duke repented him that he had not slain him
when he had him in prisone in the castle of Ermyn / for he thought if he had
slain him / than he should never have had more trouble by him. The yuell will
that he had to him caused him to be hard minded to be obedyente to the crown
of France / how be it he knew well he did yuell / therefore he suffered all
thing to pass at adventure / and held in his love the english men / and
provided suffycyently his towns and fortresses with artyllery and vytayles /
and sent privily in to England for men of arms and archers / and did set them
in his garysons / and made to be believed that he looked to have war but his
men kn^we not with whom / how be it all that ever he did was known in
France / and many spoke largely against him. He knew well that certrayne
lords of France were not content with him / but he did set little thereby /
but so passed on his time. He had great affyaunce in his cosyne the duchess of
Burgoyne / as it was reason / for he had of her a special supporte and aid /
for the lady because of lygnage loved him / and because that the earl of
Flaunders her father / who was cosyn germayne to the duke had always loved and
comforted him in all his trybulacyons. This lady of Burgoyne was a good lady /
so that the duke her husband would not gladly displease her / and good cause
why / for ye duke by her held great herytages / and had by her fair children.
all the realm of France was bound to love her / and she had not ben / great
dyscensions had moved between the parties / for natwithstandynge that the duke
of Bretayne had been at Paris with the french king / and made to him homage /
yet I can not well say if it was with good heart or no / for as soon as the
duke was returned in to Bretaygne / there apered in him but small amendment
/ he had sworn obeysaunce and to be obedyent to the pope at Auignon / but he
was not / for rather he dispysed him in his words. Nor also he would suffer no
man to be promoted in his country by that popes bulls / but held him self
newter in diverse things / and would give the benefyces him self. No clerk
could atteygne to any promocyon of any benefyce in his country / without he
had been well pleased therewith. Also any co^mau^dements that came out of the
parlyament chamber of Paris / he set nothing thereby. The prelates and
bysshoppes of Bretayne lost great part of their jurisdictions by this duke /
so that great complayntes thereof was made in the parlyament of Paris / but they
had small remedy. And when he was sent for to come to Paryses or else to send
thither some able personages to make answer to such matters as should be
aledged against him / and when any of the kings officers came in to Bretaygne
to somon him to apere / thanne he would not be spoken withal / but ever made
sundry seues. And when the kings officers did depart again thens / than he
would say. I will go to Paris to se what right I shall have there. It is not
yet three years sense I was there / to se what right I should have / but I
could se nor here of no right there mynystred / the lords of the parlyament
turn every thing as they list. They reken me very young and ignorante / to
be led as they list / but I would they knew that if all my men of the duchy
of Bretaygne / were all of one accord / and obedyent to my pleasure / as they
ought to be / I would give the realm of France so much to do / that I would
bring them that be unreasonable to reason / and such as has done trewly
should be rewarded acordyngly / and such as have deserved to have justice /
should have as they have deserved / and such as would have right should have
it. Thus many complayntes were made often times to the king / and such as
were of his secret counsel said. This duke is right presumptuous and proud
/ sithe he will be brought to no reason / and if he should be thus suffered in
his lewd opinyon / it should greatly enfeble the nobleness of this realm /
for by him other lords shall take ensample to do yuell / and thereby the
iurysdictyon of the realm little and little shall be lost. Than it was
devised to withstand / and to find remedy for such inconuenyentes / and to
send swetely to him to come to Towrs in Thourayne / and there to mete with the
french king and with the duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burgoyne / the
bishop of Charters / the bishop of Dothune. These four were specially named
/ because the duke loved them best above all other lords of France / except
the earl of Estampes / and the lord Coucy.

THus there was sent in to Bretayne to the duke the earl of Estampes and
master Iue of Noyent. They took great pain and traueyle to move the duke to
mete with the french king at Towrs. they spoke so fair with fresshe colored
words / armed with reason / that the duke agreed to go to Towrs / but further
he said in no wise he would go / and also that he should not se his enemy sir
Olyuer of Clysson in no wise. All this was acorded and agreed / or he would
come to Towrs. These ambassadors returned in to France and showed the king
and his counsel how they had spedde. They were content therewith / sithe
they could bring him to none other purpose. The king and his counsel made
them ready to go to Towrs and to tarry there a two or three months / for they
thought their treaty with ye duke of Bretayne should not sone be acomplisshed.
Thus the french king / the duke of Thourayne his brother / the dukes of
Berrey and Burgoyne / and Johan of Burgoyne his son / the duke of Burbon /
the lord Coucy / the earl of March / the Earl of saint Poll / and other of
the counsel of France came to Towrs in Thourayn. Also thither came the
constable of France and Johan of Bretayne his son in law / and their
counsayles / for they had matters there to do. And a fyftene days after /
thither came the duke of Bretayne. or he came it was said he would not come /
for he had three times sent to excuse him self / saying he was speak and could
not ride / how be it finally he came / and was lodged at his ease. There was
sir Roger of Spaygne to have been answered / but the king and the counsel
had somoche to do with the duke of Bretayns matters / that they could entende
to nothing else. This sir Roger was there more than two months or he could be
answered / but daily he was answered yt he should be herd / but it was long
first. Also the same time there fell another let / for thither came fro king
Richard of England sir Johan Clapam / one of the kings counsel and of his
chaumbre / and Richard Choall clerk and doctor of law / to speak with the
French king and his counsel / for the same matter that sir Thomas Percy and
the lord Clyfforde had been at Paris for with the king. When the english men
were come to Towrs / all other treaties were closed up and intended to their
delyueraunce. It was showed me that they brought letters of credence to the
king and to the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne. they were herd. Their credence
was / that the king of England and his Uncles would know if the french
king and his counsel were in will and mind to keep their metyng at Amyence
to treat for a peace to be had between the two kings / their alyes and
confederates. The french fynge (who as he showed / desired no thing so much
as peace / and answered and said / that he was ready to accomplysshe all
promesses / saying that as soon as he had delivered the duke of Bretayne and
were departed fro Towrs / he would entende to nothing e^s / till he were come
to Amyence / and there to abide for the english ambassadors / and there to
make them as good chere as he could. Here with the english ambassadors were
well content / and were a five days at Towrs with the king / and than took
their leave of the king and of the other lords. The king gave them great
gifts and their costs there paid for / and so departed. and all that season
they saw not the duke of Bretayne nor spoke not with him / for the duke welde
not / lest the french men should have any suspecte in him. Thus the
englysshmen returned to Calays and so to Dover / and to London and found the
king and his counsel at Westmynster / and there showed what they had done /
herd / and seen. The answer that they brought pleased well the king and his
counsel / and ordained for their journey to go to Amyence.

Now let us some what speak of the messangers that were sent to the french
king / fro the Vycount of Chastellon / out of Foize and Bierne.

SIr Roger of Spain and sir Espaygne du Lion / who were sent in to France fro
the Vicounte of Chastellen / they took on them great pain and traueyle to
pursewe their cause / for certain clerks and knights of the kings counsel
/ aduysed the king to take the county of Foiz / and to attrybute it to the
crown of France / sithe they of the country would agree thereto. The king
enclyned well thereto / but the duke of Burgoyne who was sage and ymagynatyue
would not agree thereto / but said always. Let the king take again his money /
and somewhat more. How be it as it was showed me the duke of Burgoyne could
not be herd. But the duke of Berrey took the business him / by means as I
shall show you. ye have herd here before what fell between him and the old
Gascon earl of Foize / when the duke sent in to Bierne to the earl such
notable persons / as was the earl of Sanxete / the vicount Dassey the lord de
la River / and sir Wyllm^ of Tremoyle / to treat for the marriage of the lady
Iahan of Boloyne / whom the earl of Foize had in kepinge / and at that time
the earl was well content with the marriage that ye duke of Berrey should have
her / so that he would pay thyrty thousand frankes for the keeping and
bringynge up of the lady / and the duke paid the said some / and so had the
lady to his wife. The duke of Berrey remembered the matter than / and sent for
sir Roger of Spain and for sir Espayne du Lion / to come speak with him in his
chamber / and so secretly he said to them. Syrs if ye will come to a good
conclusyon in your suit. ye shall attain thereto by my means / but first I
will have again the thyrty thousand frankes / which I paid to the old earl
of Foiz when I had my wife. I have always ymagyned that if I might over live
the earl of Foiz to have the money again. When these two knights herd the
duke say so / they regarded each other and spoke never a word. Than the duke
said again. Syrs to say truth I have taken your words fro you / speak
together and advise you well / without this treaty ye shall not attain to
your purpose / for my brother of Burgoyne will do as I will have him / he has
the governance of the country of Picardy / and I of Languedocke / against my
will no man will speak. The Vycount of Chastellon shall find good enough / for
the earl that is deed had more richesse than the king has in his treasour.
Than sir Roger of Spain said. sir though we would agree to your demand / yet
we have not here with us the treasure to content you withal. Ah sir Roger
quod the duke / that shall not let nor hyndre the matter / and ye promise the
debt on your faith and writynge I will believe you / and if it were in a
greater matter than that is. Sir quod the knight I thank you / we shall sheke
together and to more we give you an answer. It pleases me well quod the duke.
They departed fro the duke and went to their lodging / and took counsel
together whether they should return again home without agreement or else
acorde to the dukes demand / so that the heritage might clearly remain and
abide with the Vycount of Chastellon. The next day they returned to the duke
and offered him all his demand / and so there sir Roger of Spain and sir
Espaygne du Lion became dettours to the duke of Berrey for.xxx. thousand
frankes / on the condition that he should be mean that the king should take
again the so^me of money that he had lent to the earl of Foize / and that the
Vicount of Chastellon might peasably enjoy the heritage. well quod the duke
let me alone / I shall do it I trust. After that day the duke of Berrey (who
desired to have these.xxx. thousand frankes) was so good an adu^ocate for the
vycount of Chastellon / that he concluded his business at his own will. The
king and his counsel put all the matter to his pleasure. and so these two
knights had letters sealed of the confyrmacyon of the county of Foiz to be
the true enherytau^ce of the Vicount of Chastellon / with letters thereof
adressed to ye bishop of Noyon and to the lord de la River / being at
Toulouse. The ^enour of the letters as I was enfourmed by such credyble
persons as went on the same legacyon / was as follows.

CHarles by the grace of god king of France / we send and commend us to the
right reverend bishop of Noyon / and to our knight and chambrelayne the
lord de la River. We will that ye suffer the vycount of Chastellon enherytour
of Foiz and of Bierne / to enjoy and possede his heritage of the county of
Foiz / with the purtenau^ces / so that ye take in to your possessyon the so^me
of.lx. thousand frankes at one payment / and the money paid / than our
seneschall of Toulouse to make a sure quytaunce of the recryte thereof. Also at
a another paymente I will ye receive twenty thousand frankes for your costs
and charges in going and retournyng / and that money paid than make quytaunce
thereof under the seal of offyre of Toulouse. Also we will that sir yuan and
sir Gracyen of Foiz / bastard sons to the earl Gascon of Foiz / have part
and ceasonable assignement both in lands and goods of that was their fathers
/ by the advise and dyscrecyon of sir Roger of Spain and of the vicount of
Bruny quell / sir Raynolde of Newcastell and the lord of Corase / to whom we
shall write that they may so aquyte them to dyscharge our conscience / for we
made such promise to the earl their father. And if there be any fault in these
four lords or any rebellyon in the Vycount / than we disanull all this said
treaty / and will that it stand as boyde. In witness her of to these letters
we have set to our seal in out city of Towrs / the.xxii. year of our
teygne / the twenty day of the month of Decembre.

THese letters made and sealed / and delivered / the knights of Foiz returned
fro Towrs / their leave taken. This season sir Loys of Sanxere marshall of
France / lay in the marches of Carcassone as soueraygne governor there /
instytuted by the king. The bishop of Noyon and the Lord de la River sent
for him to Toulouse / and when he was come thither they said to him. Sir
marshall / the vycount of Chastellon (reputeth him self to be enherytour of
the country of Foiz) and we have sent in to France to the king to know what
he and his counsel will say in that matter / wherefore be ye ready with men
of arms on the fronters of Foiz / and as soon as sir Roger of Spain and sir
Espayne be returned / or that we have other message fro the King that they
agree not on any peace / and that the king will have the land of Foiz / than
enter you incontinent and take possessyon acordynge to ye right and puyssaunce
that the king has given us in that quarrel. Thus the marshall was ready
provided / and every day looked for answer fro the king. Now we will leave
speaking of this matter / and show somewhat of the duke of Bretayne.

YE have herd here before what treaty was at Towrs in Thourayn / between the
french king and the duke of Bretaygne / the which duke did put the king and
his counsel to much pain / for he would fall to no reason. It was said the
king demanded of him and he refused. In likewise he demanded / and the king
refused. Much treaty there was / but no conclusion taken. The duke he was
ready to serve the king and to do him homage / as far forth as he was bound
to do. Thanne the kings counsel said to him. Sithe ye knowledge yourselfe to
be the kings liegman / why will ye not than obey to reason? Why syrs quod he
wherein am I rebel? Than they laid to him diverse points. First in the
beleuynge on the pope at Auygnon / whom they said the king took for the
true pope / ye dyffer there / fro and dyssymule the matter / for ye will obey
none of his commandments / but give all the benefyces your self in
Bretaygne / and such as bring any bulls fro the pope ye will not know them
/ this is against the magesty royal / and great sin to your conscience and
soul. Than the duke answered and said. As for my conscience there is no man
ought to speak thereof nor judge it but all only god / who is soueraygne judge
in all such causes / and syth^ ye argue and appose me in that manner* I shall
answer you. As for these popes who are indyfferent / there is no sure
declaration made of them / and the season that the first tidings came of the
choosing of pope Vrbayne / I was in the town of Gaunt / with my cosyn the earl
of Flaunders / and there he received letters sealed with the popes seal / as
than called Robert of Quesne cardynall / and in his letter he certifyed to the
earl my cosyn / that by the grace of god and by the deuyne in spyratyon he was
chosen pope / and had to name Vrbayne. How than can this be undone again
/ me think it were hard to do? I will not argue against the kings majesty /
for I am his cosyn and lyege man / and shall well and trewly serve him when so
ever I be required / as far forth as I am bound to do but I will speak
against them that counsel not the king well. Why sir quod they / show us
who they be that do not counsel the king as they ought to do / and we shall
find remedy for them. Syrs ^ he ye know them better than I do / for ye
company with them oftener than I do / but as touching the benefyces of my
country / I am not so haute nor so cruel against such as desire them / but
that I suffer the clerks of my country to en^oy them / by the bulls of pope
Clement / but such cerkes as be not of the same country I refuse them / and
the cause why I shall show you. They would bear away the richesse of my
country out thereof / and deserve it not / which is against right and
consyence / where fore I can not agree thereto. And where as ye say that I am
rebel and (...) to against the kings officers / when they come in to my
country, that is not so, nor will not be. ye ought to know / and if ye do not
learn it / the fee of the ^uchy of Bretayne is of so noble a condycion / that
soueraygnely there ought none to enterprise any matter there / but alonely their
own natural lord / that is to say / the duke of Bretayne holds his court
open to here all ryghtes / and his officers to execute all ryghtes in the land
of Bretaygne / and to do acordynge to their office. And if I have any offycer
that does contrary to right / that outher stranger or other have cause to
complain / I punysshe them and shall do / that other shall take ensample by
them. more over I say that some of the kings counsel do so that they ought
to be reproved / for they do as much as they may do / to norysshe war and
hatred between the king and me / the cause why is clear enough. they suffer my
cosyn John^ of Bloys to do two things against me unreasonable. The first is /
he writes him self Johan of Bretayne / by reason of that name it seems he
entendeth to attaygne to the heritage of Bretaygne / of the which he is
without and shall be / for I have children / son and daughter that shall
succeed after me. Secondely he bears the ermyns which are the arms of
Bretaygne / but of truth to do me dyspleasure withal / sir Olyuer clysson
mayntayneth him in that opinyon / and as long as he is in that case I wyllagre
to no treaty with the king. As for war I will make none to the king /
because he is my natural lord / but if by yuell informacyon ye king make me
war / I shall defend me / and he shall find me in mine own country. all
this I will that the king know.

THus the treaty between the king and the duke of Bretayne continued
rygorously / for the duke was lord and master of his counsel / but the
french king was not so of his / but was ruled by sir Olyuer Clisson / and the
Begue of Vyllains / sir Johan Mercyer / and by sir Willyam of Montague, the
duke of Burgoyne / who had clear understanding of every thing / suffered the
duke of Bretaygnes reasons and defenses to be said in place / and covertly he
sustained them / and had the duke of Berrey of his opinion / for he hated
inwardly them of the kings privy chamber / because they had dystroyed his
treasourer Betysache shamfully / by justice at Besyers (as ye have herd here
before) but he suffered it / for he saw no time to be revenged. In this
dyfference the duke of Bretaygne tarried at Towrs three months / that their
treaty could come to no good conclusyon / and were at the point to have
departed / and the king was in will that as soon as he was returned in to
France to make a great assemble to make war the next somer after in to
Bretayne against the duke / and such of his acorde / and to leave all other
business but the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne / the lord Coucy / therle of
saint Poll / sir Guy of Tremoile / the chanceller of France / and diverse other
prelates and high barons of France such as were there / ymagined to
withsta^de this rigorous rebellio^s / and spoke togider and said to the king.
sir / we that be the iouerayn lords and piers of your realm / and be nere of
your lygnage / we should have a treaty this next lent for a peace to be had at
Amie^ce with thenglysshmen. Wherefore sir ye had need to make haste / and leave
this yuell will between you and the duke of Bretayne / for if the duke deperte
hens without any agreement made between you / thenglysshmen will be ye harder in
all their treaties / for they will think the^ to be aided and comforted by the
duke of Bretayne and by his country / for the duke has thenglisshmen at his
hand when he will / and if we have war atones / both with the Englysshmen
and bretons / as we have had or this they will put us to great pain. These
lords did so much with the king and his counsel / that at last they found
a mean between the king and the duke / I show you what it was / and surely
without the same means had been found / they should have come to no conclusion
of good acorde. So it was ye french king had a daughter. and the duke of
Bretaine had a son. there was a marriage made between this son^e and this
dought. In likewise John^ of Bretayne had a son^e by the dought of sir Olyuer
of Clysson and the duke of Bretayne had a daughter and it was thought to make
sure peace / yt the marriage between the^ two were necessary. These maryages
were agreed and concluded / howbeit for all these alyaunces / yet John^ of
Bretayne should leave the arms of Bretayne and bear them of Chastellon / and
because he was extracte by his mother side of a duke of Bretayne (for his
mother was daughter to a duke of Bretaygne) therefore he was allowed to bear in
his arms a bordet of ermyne with three labels goules / on the heed of a scochyn
of ermyns. Thus he bare these devises / and every thing was apesed. So the
duke of Bretayne gate the love of the king and of his uncles / and dyned with
the king / and so John^ of Bretayne was earl of Pon^hieuts. And thus showed
great love together by means of these marriages / how be it the duke in no wise
would se nor speak with sir Olyuer of Clysson / he had such displeasure to him
/ howebeit sir Olyuer made light thereof / for he hated the duke also with all
his puissau^ce. These marriages thus acorded / and the lords sworn and bound
to fulfill the^ / when the children should be so^what of more age. Than these
lords determined to depart fro Tourse and to draw to Paris / for the time
aproched that they should be at Amyence personally. The french king / his
brother / his uncles and his counsel / to mere there with the king of
England / his uncles and counsel / who should be there. So the duke of
Bretayne took leave of the French king and of his brother and uncles / and of
such other as he loved best / and so deperted fro Tourse and went in to his
own country: and in likewise so did all other lords. The duke of Berrey / the
duke of Burgoyne / and the lord Coucy tarried there still / I shall show you
why.

How therle of Bloys and Mary of Namure his wife / sold the county of Bloys
and all their lands to the duke of Thourayne / the french kings brother.
Cap. C.lxxxii.
YE have herd here before in this history / how Loys of Bloys / son^e to
therle Guy of bloys died when he was young / in ye town of Beauniont in
Heynalt / where by the lady Mary daughter to the duke of Berrey was a widow /
and thereby she lost her welthe of this world / for the child was a great
enheritour / and if he had lived he had been a great lord. I speak of it
because it should be known in time to come thenheritau^ce / to whom it went
out of the right line / and by what manner. therle of Blois and Mary of Namure
his wife / were not in ye case to enge^dre children togider / for by great
dri^kyng and much eating of wete and delycate meats / they were ouergrowen
with fatness / so that the earl could not ride / but was always carried in a
lytter fro one place to another / or when he would go a huntyng or haukyng /
which sport was greatly used with the lords of France The same season while
the French king was at Tourse / the duke of Thourayne had an ymaginacion
which he brought to effect as I shall show you. The duke of Thourayne knew
well / he had much richesse lying by him / paraduenture a myllion of Floreyns
/ which had by reason of his marriage with the lady Valentyne of Myllayne /
daughter to the earl of Vertus. He wist not how to enploy these flornes. Than
he remembered how the earl Guy of Bloys had great herytages / and that after
his death they were likely to go to diverse persons. The erldome of Bloys
should return to Johan of Bretayne / for he was the earls cosyn germayne /
and the lands of Heynault should go to the duke Iulyers and to the duke of
Lancastre / except Chinay which should go to them of Conflans by homage / and
the cou^tie of Soissons / which parteyned to therle of Bloys and was
au^ciently alyed to him. The lord of Coucy was enherytour thereof / by reason
of his delyuerau^ce out of prisone in England Also the lands of Drages and
Monny should return to other heirs: And the lands of Holande and zelande /
should return to the earl of Heynaulte. Thus these fair heryteges should be
sparcled abroad: and this knew well the lords of France. wherefore the duke
of Thourayn who had money lyeng by him thought to bye these lands / if he
might have any reasonable bargayne. Tha^ he thought to entreat the king to move
therle of Blois in this matter / and specially at the lest to bye the county of
Bloys / which was a fair and a noble country / and well syttinge for him /
for the county of Bloyes marched on the duchy of Thouraygne: and to the
County of Bloys parteyned many goodly fees. This duke of Thourayne rested
still on his purpose / and seized not till he spoke with ye king his brother
and ye duke of Burbone / and with the lord of Coucy: because he was great with
ye earl of Blois / and had to wife the daughter of his cosyn germayne the duke
of Loreyne. The duke of Thourayne and the other lords of his affyuite kept
this matter secretly fro ye duke of Berey / I shall show you why The lady Mary
his dought was endowed in all the county of Bloys to the so^me of.vi. M.
frankes by year: and the duke of Berrey trusted by reason of his daughters
dowry ye the county of Bloys should be his after the earls death. this duke
of Berrey was a marvelous couytous prince. the duke of Burgoyne in like wise
trusted the lands of Holande / zelande / and Heynalte to be his / because that
Margarete his eldest dought was married to Wylliam / son^e to therle of
Heynalte: whereby he thought outher by bieng or by so^e other incident yt chose
lands should return to his son^e earl of Ostrenant / otherwise called John^
of Burgoyne / who as than had married Margarete eldest daughter to therle of
Heynalte. Thus the king and these said lords purposed yt at their depertyng
fro Tourse iii Thourayn to ride by Blois to se their cosyn therle Guy of Bloys
/ who was an eight mile fro Tourse / in a castle of his own called ye Castle
morant and there to treat of this marcha^dise with him and with his wife the
lady Mary of Namure / who was a couytous lady. So it was there was a valiant
knight and of great prudence bailey of Blois / called sir Raynolde of Sens / who
had perfyte informacion of all this busynes / by what means I know not. When
he knew it he had great pity thereof / for love of therle his lord / for he
thought by reason of his sale of his lands / he should be dishonored for ever /
and disherite the true rightful heirs / which should be damnacion to his
soul. He thought to let this matter if he could / and so rode fro Blois and
spoke with therle and said. sir / the french king and the duke of Thourayn /
the duke of Burdon and the lord Coucy comes hyder to you. yt is true quod
therle / why speak you that? Sir quod he I say it because ye shall be required to
sell your enherita^ce / wherefore ye have need to take good advise therein. of
those words therle had great marueyle and said / I can not let men to speak
and make requests / but or I make any such bargayne to sell mine enherytau^ce
/ or to disheryte mine heirs to my shame and rebuke / I shall rather sell or
ley to pledge all ye plate I have. Well sit quod the knight / remember well the
matter when time is / for this that I have showed you is without dout. Bailey
quod the earl / I am not so young nor folysshe to enclyne to any such treaties.
thus the bailey deperted fro therle and rode again to Blois / for he would not
be seen there at the kings coming. When the king and these said lords ca^e
to the castle / the earl made them good chere / as it was reason. The earl and
the countess were right joyful / that ye king would visyte them in their own
castle. Than the king to draw the earl to his love / and to bring him to his
intent said. Fair cosyn / I se well ye be a lord of our realm garnysshed
with honor and larges: and have been at great cost / and to aid you / and
somewhat to recompense you / We will you give and aid / that shall be well
worth to you twenty thousand fra^kes in the county of Blois. Therle thanked
the king of his gift / but he had never profit thereof / for he had never
nothing. Than the king began to treat the Earl to sell the county of Bloyes
to the duke of Thourayn The king and the duke of Burbone spoke first / and
found therle very cold and tar of in that matter. Than the lords drew to
the countess of Bloyes / and showed her so many colored reasons / and she hers
/ that after her husbands death / she was like to be but a poor lady.
Wherefore they said it were much better for her to be a rich lady and a
puissaunt of gold and silver / and iewelles / than to be poor. Saying how
she was lykely to ouerlyue her husbade. Therefore they desired her to counsel
her husband to make this marchaundyse. The countess / who was a couytous
lady: And for love to have the floreyns / she enclyned to their desires / and
she did so much with the help of other as the aid of a varlet of the Earls
chamber called Sohier borne at Malygnes / son to a weyuer of clothes / but he
was so great with the earl of Bloyes / that all thing was done by him / and
without him nothing done. And the earl had given him in fees and herytages more
than five hundred frankes by year. Be hold and consydre what myschefe great
lords be brought unto by mean of servants. This Sohier had another wit nor
reason / to be greatly allowed / but it was alonely the folysshe love that his
master had to him. In likewise the duke of Berrey the same season had one
with him called Jacques Thybaulte / who was of no reputacion / yet the duke at
diverse times had given him the so^me of two hundred thousand frankes / and yet
all was but lost. This Sohier could nor can not excuse him self / but that
if he had lysted he might well have broken that marcha^dise / yt therle his
master made. but to please the king / the duke of Thourayne / the duke of
Burbone / the lord of Coucy and the countess / who was agreed thereto by
couitousnes of the florens. He rowned so in his masters ear / that the Earl
went from his promise that he had made to his bailey. And to there the
reuercion of the county of Bloyes after his discease was sold / for the sum
of two hundred thousand frankes / and the duke of Thouraygne to deliver to the
lady of Dunoyes for her dowry / which was assygned to her / six thousand
frankes. And furthermore he should have made another sale of all his lands in
Heynaulte: And the Duke of Thourayne to have paid for that two hundred
thousand frankes. How be it therein the earl of Bloys reserved to know the
earl of Heynaltes pleasure therein / who was his natural lord / to whom he
owed faith and homage for those lands. How be it yt king and the duke of
Thourayn took that charge on them / and to discharge the earl / what soever
should fall after. Thus or they departed they bound the earl by promise and by
writings sealed / as they might well and easily do / for he had there none of
his counsel save Sohier / who never was at scole / nor knew no letter on the
book: Much after this manner went this merchandise. and I have written this
matter as justly as I could / to thentent that herafter in time to come / by
reason of writing / the truth should be known. For the earl Guye of Bloys my
lord and master / as he that was ignorant and yuell counsayled / more by his
wife and varlet Sohier tha^ by any other / made this yuell bargayne. And when
these matters were concluded and surely made by the king / the duke of Thourayne
/ and their counsel / than the lords took their leave and returned in to
France. Great brute was made of these sales in diverse countries.

How sir Roger of Spaygne and sir Espaygne du Lion spedde with the french
king and his counsel / for the Vicount of Chastelons business: and how how
he was set in possession of the county of Foiz / and of the money that he
paid. Cap. C.lxxxiii.
How let us so^what speak of sir Roger of spaygne and of sir Espaygne du Lion
/ and show how they spedde / aft they were returned fro Tourle to go to
Tholous to the bishop of Noyon and to the lord de la River / So long they
iourneyd that they came thither / they were welcome / for their coming was
fore desired. There they showed their letters and how they had spedde. By
semblaunt the bishop and the lord de la River were ioyouse / of that the
herytau^ce should abide with the Vycount of Chastellon / on such condycions
(as is before written). Than sir Roger and his co^panyon thought to take some
more pain / as to ride to ye Vycount of Chastellon / and to the counsayls of
Foize and of Bierne / to se that every thing be set in good order. Than they
departed fro Tholous and rode to saint Gracyens. the Vicount was not there /
but he was at the enter of Berne / in a fair castle called Pau / and there
they found him / who was joyful of their coming. And when he knew that the
French king had given up his tytell of the byeng of the cou^tie of Foiz / he
was gladder than he was before. As for the money yt he should pay / he wist
well enough where to have it / and much more.

Of the great assemble that was made at Amyence / of the French king and his
counsel / and of the king of Englandes uncles: on the treaty of peace. Cap.
C.lxxxiiii.
I Think I have sufficiently treated of the business of Bierne and of foiz
for if I should rehearse all things / it would require long writing: therefore I
will leave spekyng thereof and create of other matters. Thus all things
concluded / the vicount of Chatellon was earl of Foiz and lord of Berne / in
like manner as the older earl held it / and all such as ought so to do made
homage to him / and he departed largely with ser yuan and sir Gracien / tholde
earls bastard sons / in such wise that they were content / and paid to the
French king all such money as was promised to be paid. This matter was not
sone done / somer was first well onwarde / and ye bishop of Noyon and ye lord
de la River tarried still at Tholous till every thing was set in good order /
according as they were charged. Now let us speak of thassemble of the lords
of France and of England / in the good cite of Amyence on the treaty of a
peace or of a truce / as than being the year of our lord. M.CCC.lxxx. and.xi.
in the mids of lent great provision was made there for these lords or they
ca^e thider. First for the french king and for his estate / and for his three
uncles / and also for other great lords of France / every man after his degree
/ for it was said that king Richard of England should be there / wherefore many
desired to se him / such as had never seen him before / how beit he came not
there / yet he ca^e to Dover / to thentent to have passed the sea and his three
uncles with him / yt is to say ye dukes of Lancaster / york / and Gloucester.
and when they came to Dover they took advise whyder it were mete for the king
to pass the sea or not All things consydred / the counsel of England was
of opinyon that the king should bide at Dover and the duke of Gloceter with him
and the duke of Lancastre / the duke of york therle of Hu^tyngton / therle of
Derby / sir thomas Percy / the bishops of Durham and London / and other of ye
kings counsel to pass over / so they came to Calais. And when the day
aproched yt they should mete at Amye^ce / they deperted fro Calysmo than.xii.C.
horse. it was a goodly sight to se the^ ride in good order. The french king
had ordained / that after thenglisshmen came out of Calis / both going abiding
and returnyng / all their costs and charges were borne of the french kings
charge / as mete / dri^ke / lodgyng and horse mete With ye duke of Lancaster
and the duke of york there ca^e their cosyn / dought to their suster and to ye
lord Coucy / who was a fair yo^g lady called ye lady of yrela^de / for she
was wedded to the duke of yrela^de. this lady ca^e to Amyens to se ye lord her
father ye lord Coucy / for she had not seen him much before / wherefore she
had great desire to se him. She came like a noble widow / having but small
joy in her co. age.

THe French king had ordained to make the English men as much honor as
could be devised / and to the four dukes / that is to say: The duke of
Thourayn the French kings brother / and the dukes of Burbon / of Berrey / and
or Burgoyne / l^pte on their horses and rode out of the town to mete with the
englisshmen aco^panyed with many other great lords. First met with the^ the
duke Loys of Thourayn well aco^panyed and honorably received his colyns of
England / and there co^muned a certain space with the^. than he took his
leave and departed again with all his company / and so rode straight to the
city to the king his brother: And the other three dukes ye kings uncles /
Berrey / Burbone / and Burgoyne met with the English dukes in the field and
made great chere and honorable each to other / that joy it was to se. Than the
ge^tyll earl Dolphyn of Auuergne / who had been as an hostager in England / and
much in the duke of Lacasters company / and loved him very well / He came and
humbly saluted the duke of Lancaster. When the duke saw him he enbrased him in
great token of love / and spoke toguyder a little. Than the dukes of Berrey and
Burgoyne came to them / and the duke of Burbon / the lord Coucy / and therle
of ^aynt Poule came to the duke of york / the earl of Huntyngton and to sir
Thomas Percye / and so ^ode talkyng together with amorous words / till they
aproched the city of Amyence. Than the duke of Lancastre rode between the duke
of Berrey and the duke of Burgoyn. Thus they rode all three in a front making
honor each to other / till they came to the bysshoppes palais / where the
king and the duke of Thourayne was. There they a lighted / and the two dukes
led the duke of Lancaster up the steres / and the other dukes and lords
followed. Than the French lords came in to the kings presence: and made their
reverence / and left the English dukes standing alone. Than a little they
inclined them self to the king. than the king ca^e to them and took them by
the hands / and lytte them up / and spoke swetely to them and they to him /
and other lords of France fell in talking with the other lords of England.
and when they had co^maned a season / they took their leave of the king / his
brother / and uncles and departed and were conveyed to their lodgings by the
constable of France / the lord Coucy / the earl of saint Poule / sir Johan of
Vyenne / and other Lords of the realm of France. Than they took their leaves
and deperted again to the king: and the lady of Irelande daughter to the lord
Coucy / was lodged in her fathers lodging and all her company.

IT was ordained by the french king and his counsel / before thenglysshe
lords came to the city of Amyence (which ordinance was publysshed and
proclaimed openly / to thentent that no person should be ignorant thereof) but
every man to beware of ^re king of any article in the proclamacion / on pain
of lefyng of their heedes. First that no manner of person make any riot / or
give any riotous words to any Englysshman: and also that no knight nor squier
speak or make any challenge of arms to any englysshman / on pain of the kings
high displeasure / and they to company with the with sweet words and goodly
behauour / in yt town / lodgings or field: nor that the French pages make
any debate nor riotte in any place on pain of death. And what soever any
englysshman demau^deth to su^^re them pesably to have it. and that no ho^t nor
vitayler demand any money outher for meat or drink / nor for other such
common charges. Also it was ordained that no knight nor squire of France /
should go by night time without torche or torches / and that the englysshmen
should go at their pleasure without any co^trolement. and that if any fre^chman
mete any Englysshman in the night in any street / yt they should swetely and
gently convey him or the^ to their lodgyng or to their company. Also it was
ordained that in four places of the cite / four watches to be set of a
thousand men in every watch: and that if any fire hap to fall in the night
by any incydence / the watch in no wise to remove for no manner of cause: but
at ye so wnynge of a bell / all other people to draw to que^che the fire. Also
it was ordained yt no french knight nor squier for no manner of cause should
presume to speak to the king without ye king first did call him. Nor also that
the knights nor squyers of France should talk nor comune toguyder / as long
as any of the English men were present / But to find comunynge and pastyme
with them. Also it was ordained / that all hosts and their servants / in
anywyse / should not convey or hyde any Bows or Arrows / or any other thing
parteyninge to the English men / without making of large amends / without
it were given them by the Englysshmen of their curtesy: than to take it or else
not. All these things were determined by delyberacyon or good counsel / to
do the English men the more honor / for they trusted of a good conclusyon
of peace. Nighe every day a fiftene days toguyder / these lords were in
counsel / and brought nothing to co^clusyon / for their demaundes were
greatly different. The French men demanded to have Calais rased and beaten
down / in such wise / that no person should dwell there after. The English
men would in no wise agree to that treaty: for it ought to be believed / that
Calais was ye town of the world that the commons of England loved best / for
as long as they be lords of Calays / They said they bare the kayes of
France under their gyrdell. Though the lords departed every day vnagreed
yet they departed a so^der right amiably / for every day they poynted to were
again the next day / both parties trustyng at last to conclude on some good
point. The french king made thenglysshe men in yt space three notable dyners at
his palais. In likewise so did the duke of Thourayne / the duke of Berrey the
duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone / the lord of Coucy / and the earl of
saint Poule: Each of these made the English men a great dinner And for every
thing that the Englysshmen took in the town was paid for / and clerks
appointed by the king and his counsel to write every thing / and every man
appointed for their money to the chamber of accomptes It ought to be known /
that Johan duke of Lancastre and his brother the duke of york for all that
they were come thither on trust of peace / yet they had charge of the king of
England and of his counsel / that what soever treaty they made / in no wise
they should nouther give nor take any manner of thing.

MAny were of the opynion / that the co^mynaltie of England rather enclyned to
war than to peace / for in the time of good king Edward the third / and of
his son^e the prince of Wales / they had so many fair and high vyctories on
ye french men / and so great conquestes / with so much money for raunsomes /
sellyng and patesynge of towns and countries / that they were become
marvelous rich: for many such as were no gentylmen of birth / by reason of
their hardynesse and valiant adventures / wan and conquered so much gold and
silver that they became noble / and rose to great honor. And so such as
followed after would follow the same life / how beit after yt days of the said
king Edward and ye prince his son / by the wisdom and high enterprice of
sir Bertram of Clesquy / and by the aid of other good knights of France. The
Englysshmen were than again sore put back The duke of Gloucestre son to the
said king Edward / and uncle as than to king Richard / than being at
Amyence / and diverse other lords / knights / and squyers were of the same
opynion that the commons were of in England / and enclyned rather to the war
than to peace / to the intent thereby to sustain their estate. By the occasion
thereof the peace was the harder to drive. yet the king and the duke of
Lancastre would feign have had peace / for by their means that metynge at
Amye^ce was appointed / howbeit they would not displease the co^mens of
England. The English men would gladlye have had a peace / so they might be
restored again to al such lands as was agreed on / at the treaty before
Charters / and that the French men should pay fourtene hundred thousand
fra^kes / which was unpaid when the war began to renew.

IN this season / thus great co^munycacion there was at the city of Amyence /
on treaty of peace: and the lords that were there on both parties took great
pain in the cause. It might well be marueyled why this peace took none effect
/ for specialy the duke of Burgoyne did what he could for the French party /
and the duke of Lancastre for the English party. Saving the charge that he
had / which he durst not pass. When these lords saw that they could come
to no good conclusyon / than the frenchemen somewhat to apease and to please the
englysshmen / and the rather thereby to fall to some reason / it was offered to
them to enjoy still peasably / all that ever they were as than in possessyon of
in Acquytayne / and nine dyoces to be quite delivered without any resort / so
that Calays might be beaten down. And also they offered to pay in three year
after / the sum of.xiiii. hundred thousand frankes. Than the duke of
Lancastre and the englyssh counsel answered and said. Syrs we have tarried
here a long season and have concluded nothing / nor we can not conclude till
we be returned in to England / and than we shall show all your desires and
offers to the king our sovereign lord / and to the three estates of the realm
/ and of one thing be you sure / that as much dyligence as I and my brother of
york can do / shall be done to bring your desire to pass / except ye
beatyng down of Calays / we dare not speak thereof / for if we did we should
ryn in the indygnacyon and hatred of ye most part of all the realm of
England / and yet were we better to speak no word thereof. these words
somewhat contented the french king and his counsel / and desired them that
when they were returned into England to do their dyligence in the matter / and
they said they would do what they could for the french party / saying how the
war had endured over long / and many yuell inconuenyentes has ensued thereby
in the world. than it was considred between the parties / because the truce
failed the next mydsomer after / between England and France / to continue it
lengar the space of an hole year / both by land and by see between them /
their alyes / and adherentes / and thereto the lords of England were agreed.
Than the french kings counsel desired to send two french knights to go
with them into England / and at their return to bring word what case they
should find the realm of England in. The duke of Lancastre and ye duke of
york were content therewith. It was showed me / and also the apparaunce was
great / how that the french king desired greatly to have peace / for as than
great brute ran through France and other places how that Lam^rabaquyn was
entered with great puissaunce of turks in to the realm of Hungry. sir
Boucyquant thelder marshall of France brought those news / and sir Johan of
Charon / who were newely returned fro the parties of Greece and Turkey /
wherefore the french king in his youth / had great affectyon to go in voyage
/ and to go and se the said Lamorabaquyn / and to recover the realm of Armony
/ which the turks had won fro the king Lion of Armony / who was the same
time at Amyence / and he showed the cause of his coming thither / to the duke
of Lancastre and to the duke of york. They knew him well for they had seen
him before in the realm of England. He was in England to treat for the
peace when the french king was at Sluse. And considering the king of
Armonyes business at the end of their parlyamente / the french king said
to the duke of Lancastre. Fair nephewe if peace may be had between us and the
king of England / we might than make a voyage in to Tukey / comfortyng the
king of Hungry / and the emperor of Constantynople / whom Lamorabaquyn does
much trouble / and let us recover the realm of Armony / which the turks
keep. We here say that Lamorabaquyn is a valiant man / and of great
enterprise / and against such persons as are contrary to our believe / and
daily does trouble and grieve us / we ought to enclyne our self to defend our
christian faith / wherefore fair nephewe help you to provide for this voyage in
the realm of England. The duke of Lancastre promised to do his deuoyre in
that behalf. Thus they took leave each of other.

THis counsel at Amyence endured a fyftene days / than the English men
departed / and had with them in writing the conclusion of their treaty / to
show to the king of England and his counsel. Than the duchess of Irelande
departed fro Amye^ce and took leave of her father the lord of Coucy / and
returned with the english lords. And fro that time that they departed fro
Calais till they came thither again / they spent nothing without they list /
for the french king made every thing to be paid / both for them self and
for their horses. The duke of Burgoyne than returned into Archoys to the city
of Arras / and there he found the duchess his wife / who had vysited the
country of Flaunders. The duke of Thourayne / the duke of Berrey / and the
duke of Butbone / tarried with the king and the king purposed to go to Beamoys
and to Gysors to sport him there in the way to Paris. With the duke of
Lancastre and the duke of york certain knights of France went in to
England / as sir Johan of Castle Morante / and sir Taupyns of Cantmell / to
bring answer again out of England / and sir Raynolde du Roy / the lord of
Moncaurell / and ye lord of the old town / conveyed them to Calays / and
than took their leave / and the english men passed over the sea to Deuer /
and there found the king and the duke of Glocestre taryeng for them. When the
king saw them he had great comunynge with them of the s^ate of the parlyamente
of Amyence. The king was well content with that his uncles had done / but than
the duke of Glocestre / who was always hard against the treaty of peace said
/ how there could no good conclusyon be taken in this treatye till the matter
were brought to Westmynster to a general counsel of all the three astates of
the realm / and than to follow their aduyses and none otherwise. The duke of
Glocesters words were well herd / no man would say against him / for he
was greatly in the love of the realm. Than it was showed to the knights of
France that they must go with them to London / otherwise they could have
none answer. The two knights obeyed as it was reason. Than the king took his
way and the lords with him to London. When the king came to Darfforde / he
took his way to Eltham / and refresshed him there with the queen and than
came to Shene / and went against saint Georges feast to Wyndsore / and there
the knights of France were answered. but or I show you their aunswerees I
will somewhat speak of the french king.

AFter that this assemble and counsel had been at Amyence / the French king
for lack of good gydyng fell sick of the fever / wherefore he was counsayled
to change the air. So he was laid in a lytter and carried to Beamoys / and
there tarried in the bishops palace till he was hole and recovered / his
brother the duke of Thourayne with him / and his uncles the dukes of Berrey and
Burbone / there he held his Easter. And after when the king was strong and
might well ride / he rode to Gysors / the entryng in to Normandy / to have
there the sport of hunting / for theraboute were many fair wodes. The king
being there sir Bernarde of Armynake / who was brother to Johan of Armynake
came to the king in good array / and the Dolphyn of Auuergne in his company /
whom he found at Paris in his way. There the earl of Armynake and the Earl
of Rodays made their relief and homage to the king / acordinge to the custom
as other lords of France made their relyefe / for such lands as they held
in fee of the king. And when every thing was written and regestred / they took
their leave and returned to Paris together / and fro thence to their countries
/ to Auuergne and to Languedoc. And about the feast of Ascensyon tide the
french king returned to Paris in good health / and lodged at his house of
saint Poll / the which was ordained for him / and thither was come the french
queen and the duches of Thourayne.

Now let us speak of sir Johan of Castle Morante / and of sir Taupyn of
Cantmell / who were in England taryenge for an answer of the king and his
counsel. They were at Wyndesore at saint Georges feast / where was the king
/ his uncles / and other great lords of England. There these lords
counsayled together on such promise as they had made to the french king and
his counsel at Amyence / and determined to deliver the two French knights /
that daily called on them for an answer. Than these knights were sent for
on a day / and it was said to them thus. Syrs be content / for all things
consydred ye can have of us no full answer at this time / for it would be
hard as now to assemble together the three estates of the realm / until the
feast of Mychelmas / at which time they must needs be at the parlyamente at
Westmynster / and to excuse you we shall write letters for the same purpose /
at which season if you or any other for the party of France will traueyle so
far as to come thither / they shall have a reasonable answer / such as
generally the hole counsel of the three astates shall agree unto. when the
french knights saw what answer they had / and could have none other /
they answered and said. Sir we are content with that ye have said / let us
have our letters and we shall return. Than their letters were delivered to
them / and so took their leave of the king and of other lords / and so came
fro Wyndesore to London and / made the^ ready to depart. The king of England
caused all their cestes and charges to be paid for / and conveyed to Dover /
and there tarried a five days for lack of wind / and on the sixte day they
departed and aryued at Boloyne / and when their horses were vnshypped they
rode to Amye^ce by small iourneys / and so to Paris / and there they found the
king and his lords. It was about the feast of Penthecost. Their letters were
read / whereby they understood the ordinance of the englysshmen. As it was
showed me the king nor his counsel took little regard to the matter / for
within a season after they had much ado in other places.

How sir Peter of craon through yuell will / by subtyle craft / beat down
sir Olyuer of Clysson / wherewith the King and his counsel were sore
displeased. Ca. C.lxxxv.
YE have well herd here before how ser Peter of Craon / who was a knight of
great lygnage / but he was far out of the french kings grace and the duke
of Thourayns. if he did somoche to cause them to be displeased with him he did
yuell. ye have herd also how he was gone in to Bretayne to the duke / who
showed him that the yuell will that the king bare him was by the means of sir
Olyuer of Clysson. It may well be that he was so enfourmed / in that he had
so great hate to the constable sir Olyuer of Clysson / for he studied ever
after how to dystroy him. Thus while sir Peter of Craon was with the duke of
Bretaygne / they would often times comune together / and devise how they might
bring sir Olyuer of Clysson to death / for they said that and he were ones
deed there was none yt would greatly revenge his death. The duke repented him
that he had not slain him when he had him in prisone / and would as than that
it had cost him a hundred thousand frankes / that he had him again at his
will. When sir Peter of Craon saw that the duke had such hatred to sir Olyuer
of Clysson / he purposed a marvelous ymaginacien in himself / for by
apparau^ce men should give judgment. This knight thought how so ever it were
that he would slay the constable / and thought to entende to nothing else till
he had slain him with his own hands / or caused him to be slain / and
afterward entreat for peace. He douted nothing John^ of Blois / nor the son
of the Vicounte of Rohan / who had wedded two of the constables daughters / he
thought to do well enough with them as long as ye duke was on his part / for
he saw well the strength and puyssaunce of Bloys was greatly feblysshed / for
the Earl Guy of Bloys had sold the heritage of Bloys to the duke of Thourayn /
which should have run by succession to therle of Pointhycur Johan of Bloys /
whereby he thought that the duke of Thourayne showed him but small love nor
alyaunce of lynage / to bye away his enherytaunce / wherefore this sir Peter
thought if sir Olyuer of Clysson were deed / sone to apease the kings yuell
will and the duke of Thourayns / and thereby sone to overcome the lord de la
River and sir Johan Mercyer / Montagu / the Begue of Villayns / and sir Johan
of Bulle / and other of the Kings chamber / such as sustained the constable.
for he knew well that the duke of Berrey and the duke of Burgoyne loved them
nothing in wardely / whatsoever they showed outwardly. Thus sir Peter of Craon
perceyuered still in his opinion / and devised in his imagynacion by the
entysyng of the dyuell / who never slepeth / but waketh and enbraseth their
hearts to do yuell that enclyneth to his exortacion. Thus the dyuell daily
laid the matter before this knights eyes / or he put the matter to execusyon /
but if he had justly ymagyned the doutes and parelles / and myscheuousnesse
that might fall by his yuell deed / reasone and wise atemperaunce should have
caused him to have done otherwise. But it is often times said that the great
desire that a man has to have the execusyon of that thing / or it be fallen
often times quenches reason and wisdom / therefore often times vices are
masters and virtues vyolate and corrupted / and for because that specially
this sir Peter of Craon had so great affection to the dystructyon of the
constable / therefore he lightly enclyned to the temptacion to do outrage and
folly / and thought that if he might slay the constable and return again
safely in to Bretayne / that no man would seek him there if they did he trusted
that the duke would excuse him / and that if the worste fell / that the French
king came thither with a great puyssaunce / than in a night to enter in to a
ship and so to go to Bordeaux to Bay on / or in to England / and there he
thought well he should not be pursewed / for he knew well that the english
men hated the constable because of the crueltyes that he had done and
consented to be done sithe he was turned french how be it before that he had
done many notable seruyces to the english men / as it has been rehearsed here
before in this hystory.

SIr Peter of Craon for to acco^plyssh his desire / had long studied in his
mind / how to bring his purpose to pass / and kept his purpose close and
secret. I know not if he showed it to the duke of Bretayne or not / some
thought ^es / because after the deed done by him and his company / he took the
next way he could in to Bretayne / and took for his sauegarde the duke of
Bretaygne. and also before the deed done he sold his castelles and heritage
that he had in Aniou to the duke of Bretaygne / and renyed his homage to the
french king / and said how he would go over the sea. Of all these matters I
pass breuely / but I shall declare the deed / for I sir Johan Froysart auctour
of this hystory / when this unhappy deed was done by sir Peter of Craon /
against sir Olyuer of Clysson / I was the same time at Paris / wherefore I
ought to be well enfourmed of the matter / acordyng to the enquery that I made
therein to know the truth. The same time this sir Peter had in the town of
Paris a fair house standing in the church yard of saint Iohans / as diverse
other lords had in the city for their pleasure. In this house there was a
keeper. sir Peter of Craon had sent of his servants to Paris / and they
provided largely in the house with wine / corn / flesh / salt / and other
prouysyons. Also he had written to the keeper that he should bye certain armure
as cotes of stele / gauntletes / stoles and other harness for.xl men / and
that done to send him word thereof to thentente that he would send for them
/ and secretly all this do be done. The keeper who thought none yuell and to
obey his masters commandment / bought all this marchau^dyse. And all this
season he was in a castle of his own in Aniou called Sable / and he sent one
weke three or four servants to his house in Paris / and so wekely till he had
there a.xl. and showed them nothing for what cause he sent them thither / but
he charged them to keep them self close in his house in any wise / and what so
ever they lacked the keeper of his house should provide for it. and on a day I
shall show you the cause why I send you thither before / and ye shall have
good wages. They did as he commanded them / and came privily to Paris / and
entered in to the house by night and in the mornings / for as than the gates of
Paris night and day stood open. There assembled in that house so many together
/ that they were a.xl. companyons hardy men and outragyous. How be it there
were some that if they had known wherefore they came thyderes they would not
have come there / yet they kept them self secret. Than at ye feast of
Pentecost sir Peter of Craon came to Paris secretly and entered into his house /
dysguysed like a servant. Than he called for the porter that kept the gate /
and said. I command the on pain of thy life let no man / woman / nor child
enter in to this house / nor none to go out without my commandment. The
porter obeyed as it was reason / and so did the keeper / and he commanded the
kepers wife and her children to keep her chamber and not to issue out thereof /
wherein he did wisely / for if the woman and children had gone abroad in the
streates / the coming thither of sir Peter Craon had been know / for children
and women naturally are hard to keep counsel / of that thing a man would
have kept secret. Thus sir Peter and his company were secretly in his house
till the day of the holy sacrament / and every day sir Peter had a broad his
spies that brought him word of the state of sir Olyuer Clysson / and till that
day he could find no time to execute his enterprise / wherewith he was sore
displeased in him self. The said day the french king kept a feast with open
court with all the lords that were there. Also the queen and the duches of
Thourayne were there in great joy and solace. The same day after dinner the
young lusty knights were armed and iusted valyauntly / in the presence of the
king and of the queen / and other ladies and damsels / and continued till it
was nere night / and by the judgment of the ladies and harauldes / the price
was given to sir Gillyam of Flaunders earl of Namure. And the king made all
the lords and ladies a great supper / and after supper daunced till it was one
of the clock after mydnyght. than every man departed to their lodgings / some
to one place and some to another without fear or doubt of any thing. Sir
Olyuer of Clisson who as than was constable of France / departed fro the
kings place last of all other / and had taken his leave of the king / and
than went through the duke of Thourayns chamber / and said to him. Sir will ye
tarry here all night / or else go to your lodgyng of Poullayne. This Poullayn was
the dukes treasourer / and dwelte a little beside the sign of the Lion of
silver. Than the duke said / constable I can not tell as yet whether I do tarry
here or else go thither / go ye your way to your lodging / for it is time. Than
sir Olyuer took his leave of the duke and said. sir god send you good night /
and so departed / and in the streate he found his servants and his horse /
an eight persons / and two torches. Than he rode forth to enter in to the
high streate of saint Kateryns.

SIr Peter of Craon had the same night laid good spyall on ser Olyuer of
Clisson / and knew well that he was bydden behind his company with the king
/ and that his horse tarried at the kings gate for him. Than he mounted on his
horse and all his company well armed covertly / and there past not sire of his
company that knew his intent. and when he came in to saint Katheryns streate
there he tarried / and abode privily for the constables coming. And as soon as
the constable was issued out of the streate of saint Powle / and came in to the
high streate and his torches beside him / and came riding talkyng with a
squire of his / saying. To morrow I must have at dinner with me ye duke of
Thourayne / the lord Coucy / sir Johan of Vyen / sir Charles Dangers / the
barone of Vrey / and diverse other / wherefore speak to my steward that they
lack nothing. And saying of those words sir Peter Craon and his company came
on him / and at the first they struck out the torches. And when the constable
herd the russhynge of the horses behind him / no thought it had been the duke
of Thourayne that had followed and sported with him / and said. Ah sir it is
yuell done / but I pardon you / ye are young and full of play and sport. With
those words sir Peter of Craon drew out his sword and said / slay the
constable slay him / for he shall dye. What art thou quod Clysson that spekest
those words? I am Peter of Craon thine enemy / thou have so often times
dyspleased me / that now thou shalt make ame^des / and therewith struck at the
constable / and sir Peter's men drew out their swords and struck at the
constable / who had no wepon / but a short knyfe of two foot of length / and
defended him self as well as he might / and his men were without armure / and
sone put a broad fro their master. Than sir Peter's men said shall we slay them
all. yea quod sir Peter / all such as make any defense. Their defense was but
small / for they were but eight persons and without armure. Sir Peter
demanded nothing but the death of the constable / some that were there when
they knew it was the constable they gave him but faynte strokes / for a thing
done by trayson is done cowardly without any hardynesse. The constable
defended himself valyauntly with that wepyn that he had / how be it his
defense had vayled him but little / and the great grace of god had not ben.
Still he sat on his horse till he had a full stroke on ye heed / with which
stroke he fell fro his horse right against a bakers door / who was up and busy
to bake breed / and had left his door half open which was happy for the
constable / for as he fell fro his horse he fell against the door / and the
door opened and he fell in at the door / and they that were a horseback could
not enter after him / the door was to low and to little. God showed great
grace to the constable / for if he had fallen in the streates as he did in at
the door / or if the door had been shytte / he had been slain without remedy /
but they that were a horseback durst not alyght / and also they thought / and
so did sir Peter yt on the stroke that he had on the heed / that at last it
should be his dethes wound. Than sir Peter said / go we hence / we have done
enough / for if he be not deed / he will dye on the stroke that he has on the
heed / for it was a great stroke. Therewith they departed and rode a way a good
pace to the gate of saint Anthony / and rode out thereat / for as than the gate
was open and had been ten year / sithe the french king returned fro the
battle of Rosebeque / and that the said constable put down the malles of
Paris / and punysshed them for their rebellyons.

THus sir Olyuer of Clysson was left in this case / as a man half deed and
more / in the bakers house / who was sore abashed when he knew it was the
constable / as for his men had little hurt / for sir Peter and his men looked
for nothing but to have slain the constable. Than sir Olyuers men assembled
together / and entered in to the bakers house / and there found their it
master sore hurt on the heed / and the blood rennynge down by his vysage /
wherewith they were sore abashed / and good cause why. there they made great
complayntes / first they feared he had been deed. Anon tydinges hereof came to
the kings lodging / and it was said to the king / as he was going to his
bed. Ah sir we can not hyde fro you the great myschiefe that is now
suddenly fallen in Paris. What myschefe is that quod the king? Sir quod they /
your constable sir Olyuer of Clisson is slain. Slain quod the king / and
how so / and who has done that deed? Sir quod they we can not tell / but
this myschefe is fallen on him here by in the streate of saint Kateryn. Well
quod the king / light up your torches / I will go and se him. Torches anon
were lyghted up. The king put on a cloak and his slyppers on his fete. Than
such as kept watch the same night went forth with the king / and such as
were a bed and herd of these tidings rose up in have and followed the king /
who was gone forth with a small company / for the king tarried for no man /
but went forth with them of his chamber with torches before him and behind
him / and had no mo chamberlayns with him but sir Gaultier Martell and sir
John^ of Lygnac / Thus the king came to the bakers house and entered / and
certain torches tarried without. Than the king found his constable nere deed
as it was showed him / but not fully deed / and his men had taken of all his
gear to se his wounds / how he was hurt. And the first word that the hynge
said was. Constable how is it with you? Dear sir quod he right febly. Who has
brought you in this case quod the king. Sir quod he Peter of Craon and his
company traytoursly / and without defense. Constable quod the king / there was
never deed so derely bought as this shall be. Than physycions and surgeons were
sent for on all parts / and when they came the king said to his own surgyons.
Syrs / look what case my constable is in / and show me the truth / for I am
sorry of his hurt. Than they serched his wounds in every part. Than the king
demanded of them and said. Syrs how say you / is he in any parell of death.
They all answered and said. sir surely there is no ieoperdy of death in him /
but that within these.xv. days he shall be able to ride. With that answer
the king was right joyous and said / thanked be god these be good tidings /
and than said. Constable be of good chere and care nothing / for there was
never trespass sorer punysshed than this shall be / upon the traitors that have
done this deed / for I take this matter as mine own. The constable with a feeble
voice answered. Sir god reward your grace for your noble vysytacyon. Than the
king took his leave and departed and returned to his lodging / and in
contynent sent for the provost of Paris / and by that time that he came it was
clear day light. than the king commanded him and said / Provost get you men
together well horsed / and pursewe that traitor sir Peter of Craon / who thus
traytorously has hurt nygh to the death our constable / ye can not do to us a
more acceptable service thanne to pursewe and take him and bring him to us.
Than the provost answered and said / sir I shall do all yt lies in my
puyssaunce to do. Sir can your grace know which way he is gone. Inquire
quod the king and do your dylygence.

How in great dylygence the provost of Paris pursewed sir Peter of Craon. Cap.
C.lxxxvi.
AS at that time the four sovereign gates of the city were ever kept opyn
night and day which ordinance was made euersythe the battle of Rosebeque /
where the French king disconfited the ^^mynges / and that the parisye^ce would
have rebelled / and that the malettes were laid down / to the intent to keep
under the parisyence. and by the counsel of sir Olyuer of Clysson / all the
chains in the streates were laid down / and the gates taken of their hokes.
In this case the city was in a ten year / so that every man might enter night
or day in to Paris who so list. Lo / it may be well consydred what fortune
is. The constable gadred the rod wherewith him self was beaten / for if the
gates of Paris had been closed and the chains lift up / sir Peter of Craon
durst never have done that he did / for if he had ^ he could not have gone out
of the town as he did. But because he knew well he might issue out at all
hours / that made him execute his yuell purpose. Wha he departed fro the
Constable / he thought surely he had been slain / how be it he was not /
wherewith he was sore displeased. When he issue out of Paris / it was about one
of the clock after mydnight / and passed by the gate saint Anthony. And some
said he passed the river of Seyne at the bridge of Charenton / and than took
the way to Charters / and some said he issued out of Paris at the gate of
saint Honor / under Mount marter: and passed the river of Seyne at Ponthieur.
Where so ever he passed / he was by eight of the clock at Charters / and such
as were well horsed with him / all followed him not / but brake a sondre for
less suspeciousnesse / and for fear of pursuit. And when this sir Peter of
Craon came first to Paris / he had left at Charters with one of the chanons
there / who had been a servant of his beforetyme / a twentte fresshe horses. It
had been better for the chanon he had never known him / how be it of his
purpose nor of the executynge thereof / he knew nothing therein. When sir Peter
was returned to Charters / he drank and changed his horses and did of his
harness / and took the way to Main / and rode so fast / yt he came to a
castle of his own called Sable / and there rested him self / and said he
would go no further / till he herd tidings of sir Olyuer of Clysson / and
how the matter went. ye may be sure that the same friday after the deed was
done / great brute ran all about the city of that deed / and many blamed
greatly sir Peter of Craon. The lord of Coucy as soon as he knew thereof in
the morning lepte on his horse with eight persons with him / and rode to the
Constables lodgyng to visyte him / for they loved entierlye together / and
called each other brother in arms / his visytacion did the Constable great
good. In like manner other lords acordyng to their turn came and visyted him
/ and specially the duke of Thourayne who was sore displeased for that deed.
And the king and he said both / how that sir Peter of Craon had done that
deed in dispyte of them / and how it was a thing prepensed by false traitors
/ to put the realm to trouble. The duke of Berrey / who was than^e was at
Paris / dissymuled the matter and made no great business in the cause. And I
sir Johan Froissarte auctour of this cronycle / as I was credably informed of
this adventure / there had been nothing done / if the duke of Berrey had list.
for if he had would / he might well have broken that enterprise / I shall show
you the reason how.

THe same thursday of Corpus Christy day / there came to the duke of Berrey a
clerk / secretorie to sir Peter of Craon / and said to him in secret manner.
sir / I will show you a thing in secretnesse / which is lykely to come to a
poor co^clusyon. And sir / ye are more lykely to remedy it than any other.
What matter is that quod the duke. Sir quod he I shall show you / but I would
not be named the bringer out thereof. Spare not quod the duke / I shall bear
out the matter well enough. Well sir quod the Clerk / I doubt me greatly
that sir Peter of Craon will slay or cause to be murdered / the constable sir
Olyuer of Clysson / for he has assembled toguyder in to his house / within the
Church yard of saint Iohanes / a great noumbre of men / and has kept
them there covertly / euersyth the feast of Whitsontyde. And sir / if they
should do that deed the king will be sore dyspleapleased / and bring the
Realm in to great trouble / therefore sir I show it to you. for sir I am
abashed thereof my self / though I be sir Peter's servant / and have made
service to him / yet I dare not consent to this outrage. And sir / and ye
provide not for the matter / there is none can do it. And sir / for goddessake
take heed to this that I have showed you. And sir / to eschew that may fall
I dare not return to him. The duke herd him well and said. Abide here with
me this night / and to morrow by times I shall inform the king thereof. It is
now farforthe days / I will not trouble the king therewith / but to morrow
without fault we shall provide for the matter / sith that sir Peter of Craon is
in the town / I knew not thereof before. Thus the duke drove of the matter /
and in the mean time this myschiefe fell. Than the Provost with mo than^e
threscore horses issued out of the city at the gate of saint Honor / and
followed the tracke of sir Peter of Craon / and came to Ponthieur to pass the
river of Seyne / and demanded of the kepar of the bridge / if any horses
passed that way that morning / and he said yes: how that there passed about
a twelve horse / but I saw no knight nor person that I knew. What way took
they quod the Provost? sir quod he the way toward Wannes. Ah quod the
provost it may well be / I think they will ride to Chierbourge. Than^e the
prouoste took that way and lest the way to Charters / and thereby the lost
the just pursuit of sir Peter of Craon. And when he had rydden till noone /
than he met with a knight of the country who had been a huntyng of the Hare
/ and he showed him how that he saw the same morning about a fyftene men a
horseback / trauersyng the feldes and (as he thought) took the way to
Charters. Than the provost and his company entered in to the way to Charters /
and so rode till it was nere hand night / and than came to Charters. And there
it was showed him / how sir Peter of Craon had been there with the chanon
about eight of the clock / and there unarmed him and took fresshe horses.
Than the provost saw well he had lost his pain and should do to follow him
any further / Saying / seeing that he was so far past. Than the Saturdaye he
returned to Paris / because the certentie / which way sir Peter of Craon
took was not known at Paris. Therefore the king and the duke of Thourayne who
had a great affection to have sir Peter of Craon taken / sent sir John^ of
Barrois with a threscore horse out of Paris to sertche for him. And they issued
out at the gate saint Anthony / and passed the ryuers of Marne and Scyne / at
the bridge of Charenton / and rode all about the country and came toward
Estampes / and finally at dinner they came to Charters / and there herd sure
tidings. And whan^e the Barrois knew yt sir Peter of Craon was gone / and
saw that he should but traueyle in vain / to follow any further. Than he
returned again the sunday to Paris / and showed the king what he had done /
and in likewise so had the provost done. The saturday there was found in a
vyllage as they went a sertchyng two squyers and a page / parteynyng to sir
Peter of Craon. They were taken and brought to Paris and set in prisone / and
on the Mondaye beheeded. First they were brought to ye place where the deed was
done / and there each of them had their right hand stricken of / and than to
the halles and there beheeded and hanged on the gybet and the wednisday after
the kepar of sir Peter of Craons house in Paris was executed and beheeded. many
men said he had wrong But because he showed not the coming of sir Peter in to
Paris / he was put to death. in likewise yt chanon at Charters with who^ sir
Peter did refresshe him and changed his horse / he was accused and taken and
put in the bysshoppes prisone / and took fro him all that he had / and deprived
him of all his benefyces / and was condemned to perpetual prisone / to live
with breed and water / all the excusacyons that he could make auayled him
nothing. He was reputed in the town of Charters to be a noble wise man. sir
Peter of Craon being in his castle of Sable / was sore displeased when he
knew that sir Olyuer of Clysson was not deed / nor had no hurt / but that
within six wekes he should be hole. Than he consydred that he was not in good
surety in that Castle / and feared to be enclosed / in such wise / that he
should not issue when he would. Than^e he took a certain with him and issued
out secretly / and rode so long that he came in to Bretaygne / and there
found the duke / who received him and knew all the matter / and how the
Constable was not deed: Than he said. Ah sir Peter of Craon ye are unhappy /
that could not slay the Constable / when ye had him under your hands. Sir
quod sir Peter / the devil was on it. I think all the deuylles in hell did
held him out of my hands / and out of my companyons. I am sure there was
stryken at him mo thanne threscore strokes / with swords and iauelyns. And
whan^e he fell fro his horse / in deed I thought surely he had been deed: and
so he had been / and it had not ben his fortune to fall in at a bakers door the
which stood half opyn / for if he had fallen in the street he had never
risen a live. Well quod the duke / as now it will be none otherwise / I am
sure I shall here shortly some news fro the french king / and I think I
shall have war with him (as ye have). Keep you privily with me ye matter shall
not thus rest / and sith I have promised to aid and sustain you I will keep
promise.

Of the great army and viage that the French king purposed to make in to
Bretayne against the duke / because he sustained sir Peter of craon: and how
in that viage the king fell sick / whereby the viage brake Cap. C.lxxxvii.
Tidings came to the French king as he lay at Paris / that the duke of
Bretayne had received sir Peter of Craon. than the king was counsayled by
such as were of his priuye Counsel / that he should incontinent send in to
Bretaygne to the duke / co^maundynge him on his faith and homage / that he
ought to the crown of France / to take the traitor sir Peter of Craon and to
send him to Paris. These letters were written / sealed and delivered to a
squiet / and he rode so long that he came in to Bretayne / and found the duke
at his castle of Ermyne / and there delivered his letters. The duke took and
reed them. Than he said to the messanger that he would write again to the king
/ and so did in excusing of himself: Saying that as of sir Peter of Craon he
knew nothing / nor where he was / nor would not know / nor it aparteyned not
to him to know: Nor as for the hatered nor war that was between sir Olyuer
of Clysson and sir Peter of craon he took no regard thereto / for it touched
him nothing. And therefore in those matters / he prayed the king to hold him
excused. This letter was sealed and delivered to the kings messanger / and so
he returned again to Paris / and there found the king and his counsel who
were sore desirous to here tidinges out of Bretaygne. Than the messanger
delivered his letters to the king who took and reed them. Than the king said
to his brother and to his counsel. This excusacion of the dukes is not
suffycient. It seems well the duke of Bretayne has caused all this busynes
This dispyre and outrage is so great / that it ought not to be suffered / for it
touches gretlye mine honor. The same season the duke of Berrey was at Paris
/ and often times the king would speak to him of this trespass / and the duke
said. Sir / surely he has done a great outrage: if he might be found / it
were reasone he made amends. Fair uncle quod the king / he is in Bretaygne
with the duke. We will go and seek him there / and ye shall go with us. The
duke dissymuled the matter and said. Sir / as it shall please you / but ye must
have also my brother of Burgoyne with you. We will have him with us quod the
king / for without him we will make no voyage. We will go in to Bretayne with
such an army / able to resyst all our enemies. We may se now openly / that
this duke loves nor sets by us but little: He is proud and presumptuous /
and we shall entende to nothing / till we have brought him to reasone. Thus
the French king devised with the duke of Berrey / and manysshed greatly the
duke of Bretayne and his assysters. The duke of Berrey acorded to all his
saying / but he dissymuled / for he thought the contrary.

THe French king had great affection to be revenged / of the dispyte that
was done to his constable / wherefore he prepared him self to go in to Bretayne
/ and first to go in to Aniou to distroye and beat down sir Peter of Craons
castle les / for all that the duke of Bretayne said he had bought them. yet the
king and his counsel said it was no point of the dukes heritage but that the
duke said so to excuse and to sustain sir Peter of Craon / wherefore
personally he was in the kings indignacyon. yet in the same season a treaty
of marriage was had between the duke of Bretaygnes son^e and the kings daughter.

IN the mean season while this voyage was thus ordered / and great brute thereof
spoken through all France. There returned to Paris the bishop of Noyon and
the lord de la River fro Foize and Bierne / and there showed the king and his
counsel how they had spedde. They were well herd / but the voyage in to
Bretayne busyed so the king and his counsel / that they had no leysar to
ente^de to any other matter. And the king would gladly that the constable had been hole / that he might be able to ride. and or the king went fro Paris / he
commanded to be beaten down sir Peter of Crao^s house / that stood in the
church yard of saint Iohans / and than the king did give the ground to
make a church yard of to burye in deed bodies. The French king made his
prouisyon in the way to Aniou / to Main / to Bretayne / and in to Thourayne
on the river of Loyre / to the intent to go in to Bretayne / none durst speak
the contrary.

REnome was throughout all Paris and (it was well known) that sir Olyuer of
Clisson constable of France / when he lay thus sick of his hurtes made his
testament / to the entente that his heirs should know ye truth of every
thing that he had / and where it was. His heirs were two daughters / the one
was married to Johan of Bretayne earl of Ponthieur. It was he that sir Olyuer
had quytte out of prisone in England / and paid for him sixscore thou sand
frankes to the duke of Irelande / as it has been showed here before in this
history. And his second daughter was or should be vicou^tes of Rohan by
reason of her husband The sum of the testament mounted to the so^me of
seuyntene hundred thousand frankes beside his heritage. Every man yt herd
thereof had great marueyle / how he should gather toguider / such richesse /
and specially the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne / and their counsayls / had
great marueyle thereof / and spoke largely and said. What the devil how may
it be that the constable has gadered to guider so many floreyns / and such
mouable goods? the king him self has not so much. It may well be believed
and known / that he has not won all this by no just means. Thus the matter
passed / but such as loved him not thought nevertheless. Thus all such as
the king had written unto prepared them self to go with him in to Bretaygne.
This voyage pleased nothing the duke of Burgoyn / he said this was a war
without reason / and that the conclusion there of could take no good end / nor
the realm of France / nor the duchy of Bretayne / nor the lords / knights
and squyers / in the^ had nothing to do with the war between sir Olyuer of
Clysson and sir Peter of Craon. What need they quod he to take pain or
traueyle to make war in their quarelles? We should rather suffer them and
their own me^ to grieve and make war each upon other. The duke of Berrey was
of the same opinyon / but they could not be herd nor believed / for the king
was cou^sayled contrary to their opinyons / by such as the king loved better
than them. These dukes could not tell how to break that enterprice / and when
they saw none other remedy / they obeyed / But that was slouthfully / how be
it by the promocyon of the duke of Burgoyne / the earl of Ostrenaunt was
written unto by the king to go with him in this journey with three hundred
spears. The earl who loved deeds of arms provided him to go with the king /
and whan^e he was ready / and had assembled toguyder his company to his great
cost and charge. Than he was countermaunded again / and that in no wise he
should stir.

How the duke of Thourayn brother to the king resigned the duchy of Thourayne
in to the kings hands: and how by exchau^ge the king gave him the duchy of
Orlyau^ce and so ever after he was called duke of Orlyaunce. Cap. C.lxxxvii.
IN the same season that the king was thus nighe ready to depart out of Paris /
to show that he took that business / as to him self / there was an exchau^ge
made of lands greatly to the profit of the duke of Thourayne / for he resygned
in to the kings hands the duchy of Thourayne / and the king gave him the
duchy of Orliaunce / in like manner as au^ciently duke Philyp of Orlyaunce held
it / which was four times better in value than the other was. so thus fro hens
forth in this history I shall name him that was duke of Thourayne duke of
Orlyau^ce. When sir Olyuer of Clysson was all hole and that he might ride / the
French king was right joyful and said: how he would tarry no lengar and so on
an euenyng he took his leave of the queen Isabell his wife / and of the new
duchess of Orlyaunce / and of all other ladies and damoselles / and so did
the duke of Orlau^ce in likewise. Than they departed and rode to supper to
Mo^tague / and the duke of Burbone / the earl of Namure / and the lord of
Coucy with him. There the king lay and dyned there / and after dinner they
departed and lay all night at saint Germayns / and there lay a seuyn days.
and as than ye king was somewhat diseased / and his phisicions would have had
him to have rested him self / but ye king was so wyllyng in his journey / that
he said how he was much better at his ease / than he was in deed / which he
did to give courage to his men to set forward / for as tha^ his two uncles /
the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne were behind / and showed well by their manner
/ that the same journey grieved them / nor they would not have gone by their
good wylles / how be it they had made their assemble and to save their
honor they obeyed and followed.

When the French king had rested him a fyftene days at saint Germayns / and
that his army was assembled / than he departed and passed the river of Seyne /
and took the way to Charters / and so to Annens / a good town and a castle /
parteyning to the lord de la River / as heritage of his wives. With the king
was his brother the duke of Orlyaunce and the duke of Burbone. The lord de la
Ryreceyued the king honorably / and there tarried three days / and than rode to
Charters where as Montague was bishop. The king was lodged in the bishop
palais and the two dukes. And the second day after thither came the duke of
Berrey and the earl of March in his company. And the fourh day thider ca^e
the duke of Burgoyne / where of the king was right joyful / and people came
dayle / and the king said he would not return to Paris till he had brought
the duke of Bretayne to reason / who so often times had put him to pain and
trouble. The kings counsel had so set him on that war / that the dukes
of Berrey and of Burgoyne would gladly have modered ye matter / but they could
not be herd / wherewith they were sore displeased / and so were such as were
of their cou^sayls: and they said each to other that surely the matter could not
long endure in that state / for it is full lykely that the king and the realm
shall have some business to do / sith the king refuses the counsel of his
uncles / and leans to other at his pleasure / who be nothing like to the^.
When the king had tarried at Charters a seuyn days / than he departed and took
ye way to Man's and his men followed / some fro far parts / as out of Arthois
/ Beamoys / Vermandois / and Picardy: and some said one to another. Ah / this
duke of Bretayne makes us to have much to do / and puts us to great pain
and traueyle. He has been always hard and high herted against the crown of
France / nor he never loved nor honored it. And his cosyn the earl of
Flaunders and the duchess of Burgone (who have always borne him and as yet
do) had not ben / he had been distroyed long a go / for euersyth the lord
Clysson turned French / he never loved him. Surely by an likely^, ^de he is
^^^yable of this deed / for he has always (...) sir Peter of Craon against
the king and against the Constable. Than other said. Let the king alone /
for as at this time he has ye matter so at his heart / that he will bring the
duke to reason or he return. That is true quod other if there be no trayson.
But we fear that all such as go with the king be not enemies to ye duke / as
it may be well (...) (if we durst speak it) by some tokens. For there be some
that night and day do what they can to counsel the king to break his voyage
/ which so troubles the king that he can scant get him self any health or
recovery of his last sickness. Thus knights and squiers devised among the^
self as they rode in their countries. Still the king aproched to the city of
Man's / and there the king lodged in the castle and his lords in ye city /
and his men of war abroad in the country. There the king tarried a three
wickes / for he was sore vexed with the fever: and his phisicions said to his
brother and to his uncles. My lords we ensure you ye do yuell to traueyle ye
king for he is in no good state to ride / rest were far better for him / for
sithe he came fro the city of Amyens / he has not ben in so good health / as
he was before. They showed this to the king but he had so great affection to
go in this journey / that he would another believe them nor yet his phisycions /
but said. how he found more ease in trauelyng than in restyng. Therefore who
so ever counsel me the contrary shall not please me / nor he loves me not.
Other answer they could not have of the king. Every day the king would sytte
in the mids of his counsel / till it was noon / to thentent that none
should lay any let of his journey. Thus the king being at Man's / and somewhat
to acomplysshe the desyers of his uncles. He sent four notable knights to the
duke of Bretayne / as sir Raynolde du Roy / the lord of Varensiers / the lord
of Castle morant / and sir Ta^pyne of Cauten^l chateleyne of Gysors / and they
were charged to show the duke / how the king and his counsel reputed that
he did great offense / to sustain the kings enemy and the realms / and to
make amends / that he should se^de sir Peter of Craon to Man's to the king /
whereby means should be found that he should take no do^mage / nor his
country / for all the kings voyage. Thus they deperted fro Man's with a.xl.
speres / and passed through the cite of Angiers and at last came before the
city of Nauntes / and entered / and there sound the duke who made them good
chere / and on a day made them a dinner / and than they did their message and
declared ye kings intent and his counsayls / whereunto the duke answered wisely
and sagely / and said How it should be hard for him to deliver sir Peter of
Craon / and said as god might help him in all his business / he knew not
where he was. Wherefore he desired them in that case to hold him excused / But
he said he had well herd of him a year past / that he loved not sir Olyuer of
Clysson / but would make him mortal war to his power / what soever end came
thereof. And at that time I demanded of him if he had given sir Olyuer
knowledge thereof / and he said he had utterly defied and would slay him if he
could / outher by day or by night / where soever he could find him. Of his
deeds I know no further / wherefore I have marueyle that the king will make
war against me for his cause. for as to the couynauntes of marriage between
our children by the grace of God / shall not be broken on my part / wherefore I
have done nothing to him nor to his counsel / that he should make war
against me This was the answer that the duke made to the French kings
messangers / and so when they had tarried a day at Nauntes / than they took
their leave and departed and returned to Man's to ye king / who thought long
till he herd their answer / and as ye have herd before: they declared it to
ye king and his counsel. The dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne were well
content with ye answer and said it was reasonable / but the king by reason of
such enformacion as he had said the contrary: and said sith he was so
forewarde in his journey / he would not return again in to France nor to
Paris / till he had brought the duke of Bretayne to reason Gladly the two dukes
of Berrey and Burgoyne would have modered that voyage / but they might not be
herd / for the king had taken such displeasure with the duke of Bretayn /
because he sustained sir Peter of craon that no excusacion could be taken. The
same time a brute ran in France / that the queen of Aragon my lady yolant of
Bare / cosyn germayne to the french king / had in prison in the city of
Barcylona / a knight that no man knew his name / men supposed it had been sir
Peter of Craon. this queen had written right amyably to the king / sygnyfyenge
him that the fyfte day of the month of July / a knight in good estate and array
came to Barcylona / to have past the sce / and had hired for his money a ship
(as he said) to have sailed in to Napoles / and because we keep our passages
that no stranger shall pass without he be known what he is / and this knight
will not show his name / therefore we keep him in prisone / and by the
abasshment that we se in him / we think surely it be the same person ye would
so feign have. Therefore we write to you thereof / that ye should send some
person hither / such as knows sir Peter of Craon / to se if it be he or not
/ for what so ever he be he shall not be delivered till we have answer fro
you / and I would that these tidings might be agreeable to you and to your
counsel / as knows the holy ghost / who preserve you. Written at Parpygnan
the nynth day of July / by yolante of Bare / queen of Aragon and of Maiolles /
and lady Sardyne and Sardane. And on the super scrypcion / to the redouted
king of France.

THese tidings somewhat modered diverse men's hearts / so that they were nere
at the point to have broken their voyage / how be it such as were sir Olyuer
of Clyssons friends said / that those tidings were but feigned tales / made
and devised to break the kings voyage / saying that sir Peter of Craon was in
none other prisonees but with the duke of Bretayne / who has sustained him and
does. Of the queen of Aragons lettre the king made but light / saying it was
but trayson and fables. Than the duke of Burgoyne said. Sir yet at least to a
pease my nese the queen of Aragon / and for the delyueraunce of the knight that
is there in prisone / who petaduenture is nothing gylty of this trespass /
send unto her that she may be content with you and with us. I am content
therewith quod the king to please you / but I believe surely the traitor sir
Peter of Craon is in none other Barcylona nor prisone / but about the duke of
Bretayne / and by my faith that I owe to saint Denyce / he shall ones make
acompt thereof. There could no man turn the king fro the opinyon / but that
sir Peter of Craon was with the duke of Bretaygne. The duke of Bretayne who was
well enfourmed of all this business / thought himself not well assured / for
he saw well the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne could not bring their purpose
about / for sir Olyuer of Clyssons friends led the king as they list. Than
the duke provided for to keep his towns and garysons / how be it he durst
keep no town except Wannes / Campell / Doll / Camper / Lermyn / Cora^tyne /
and Susement / and he wrote to such knights and squyers as he thought should
aid him / but they all dissymuled with him / because they knew that the
french king was so sore displeased with him / and also they thought it was not
a thing couenable for the duke to sustain sir Peter of Craon against the
constable of France / as he did. The duke in a manner repented him that he had
done so much / how be it his courage and heart was so high that he dysdayned
to speak it / but said if the king came in to Bretayne / as it seemed he would
do / at the beginning he would let him a lone / and thanne shall I se who be
my friends or foos / I will not be to hasty to make him war / and when he
weneth to be at most rest / than will I awake him if I can not be a greed with
him by love. Thus the duke devised sometime with his counsel / and thought
surely he should have war / how be it he had not / for the matters turned
otherwise to his great advantage. therefore it is an old proverb / he is not
poor yt is happy. This duke was fortunate / by reason of apytuous incydence
that fell suddenly on the french king / for otherwise the duke was not lykely
to have escaped all dangers / and to have lived in peace as he did.

When the French king had tarried the space of three wekes in the city of Man's
/ and the knights returned that he had sent in to Bretayne. Than he said sith
he had herd the dukes answer he would no longer tarry there / for he said the
taryenge there greatly displeased him / and would pass forth in to Bretaygne
to se his enemies / that was the duke of Bretaygne / who susteyd the traitor
sir Peter of Craon. The entencyon of the king was / that if any knights and
squyers came against him / or that he found any towns closed he would put
down ye duke for ever / and set a governor in the country till the dukes
children were of lawful age / and than render to them the berytage / and the
duke never to have any part theof. This opinyon the king held still and no
man could put him therfro. and thus on a fair day about ten of the clock
the king departed fro the city of Man's / and had commanded his marshalles
the night before to cause all his at mye both before and behind to dysloge
and to draw to Angers / and said that he would not return till he had been
in Bretayne and dystroyed the traitors that had put him to so much pain and
trouble. The marshalles did the kings commandment. The day that the king
departed was marvelous hoote / for me son as than naturally was in his
chief force / and to the intent to declare the troth of every thing. The same
season that the king lay at Man's / he was sore traueyled with daily sitting
in counsel / and also he was not perfytely hole nor had not ben all that
season / he was feeble in his brain and heed / and did eat or drink but
little / and nygh daily was in a hoote fever / so that he was greatly anoyed and
payned / and also for the dyspleasure that he had for the constables hurt / he
was full of malencoly and his spirytes sore troubled and traueyled / and that
his physicions spyed well and so did his uncles / but they could not remedy it
/ for no man durst counsel him to break his voyage in to Bretaygne. And as
it was enfourmed me / as he rode forward in the forest of Man's / a great
sygnifycacyon fell to him / by the which if he had done well he should have
called his counsel about him and well aduysed himself or he had gone any
further. Suddenly there came to the king a poor man bare heeded / bare legged
/ and bare footed / and on his body a poor white cote / he seemed rather to be
a fool than wise / and boldly suddenly he took the brydell of the kings
horse in his hands and stopped the horse and said. Sir king tide no further
forward for thou art betrayed. Those words entered into the kings heed /
whereby he was worse dysposed in his health than he was before / so that his
heart and his blood was moved. Than the kings servants struck so the poor
man that he let the kings horse go / and made no more of his words than of
a fools spekyng / which was folly as diverse men said / for at the least they
should have better examyned the man / and to have seen if he had been a natural
fool or no / and to have known fro whence he came / but they did not so /
but left him behind / and he was never seen after to any man's knowledge /
but such as were nere to the King herd him speak these words. The king
passed forth / and about twelve of the clock the king passed out of the
forest / and came in to a great plain all sandy. the son also was in his
heyght and shone bright / whose rays were marvelously hot / whereby the
horses were sore chafed / and all such persons as were armed were sore
oppressed with heat. The knights rode together by companyes / some here and
some there / and the king rode somewhat a part because of the duste / and the
duke of Berrey and the Duke of Burgoyne rode on his left hand talking
together / an acre bread of land of fro the king. Other lords as the earl of
March / sir Jacques of Burbone / sir Charles de la Brethe / sir Phylyppe
Darthoys / sir Henry and sir Phylip of Bare sir Peter of Nauer and other
knights rode by companyes. the duke of Burbon / the lord Coucy / sir Charles
Dangers / the baron Dyuiry and diverse other rode on before the king / and not
in his company / and they devised and talked together / and took no head of
that fell suddenly on the chief personage of the company / which was on the
kings own person / therefore the works of god are marvelous / and his
scourges are cruel and are to be douted of all creatures. There has been seen
in the old testament and also in the new / many fygures and examples thereof.
We read how Nabugodonosor king of Assyryens / who reigned a season in such
tryumphant glory / that there was none like him / and suddenly in his greatest
force and glory / the sovereign king out lord god king of Heaven and of earth
/ fourmer and ordeyner of all things / a parelled this said king in such
wise that he lost his wit and reygne and was seven yers in that estate / and
lived by acornes and mast that fell fro the Oaks / and other wild appels and
fruits / and had taste but as a bore or a swyne. and after he had endured this
penance god restored him again to his memory and wit. And than he said to
Danyell the prophet / that there was none other god / but the god of Israel.
Now the father / the son / and the holy ghost / three persons in one god /
has been / is / and ever shall be as puissaunt to show his warkes as ever he
was / wherefore no man should marueyle of any thing that he does. Now to the
purpose why I speak all these words. A great influence fro heaven fell the said
day upon the french king / and as diverse said / it was his own fault / for
acordynge to the dysposicyon of his body / and the state that he was in / and
the warnyng that his physicyons did give him / he should not have rydden in
such a hoote day / at that hour / but rather in the morning and in the
evening in the fresshe air / wherefore it was a shame to them that were nere
about him / to suffer or to counsel him to do as he did. Thus as the french
king rode upon a fair plain in the heat of the Son / which was as than
of a marvelous heyght / and the king had on a ^ac^e covered with black
velvet / which sore chafed him / and on his heed a syngle bonet of scarlet /
and a chapelet of great perles / which the queen had given him at his
departure / and he had a page that rode behind him / beatynge on his heed a
chapewe of Montaban / bright and clear shynynge against the son / and behind
that page rode a another bearing the kings spear / painted read / and frynged
with sylke / with a sharp heed of stele / the lord de la River had brought a
dosyn of them with him fro Toulouse / and that was one of them he had given the
hole dosyn to the king / and the king had given three of them to his brother
the duke of Orlyaunce / and three to the duke of Burbon. And as they rode thus
forth the page that bare the spear / whether it were by neclygence or that he
fell a sleep / he let the spear fall on the other pages heed that rode
before him / and the heed of the spear made a great classhe on the bright
chapewe of stele. The king (who rode but a fore them) with the noise suddenly
started / and his heart trymbled / and in to his imagynacion ran the
inpressyon of the words of the man that stopped his horse in the forest of
Man's / and it ran in to his thought / that his enemies ran after him to slay
and distroy him / and with that abusyon he fell out of his wit by feblenesse
of his heed / and dasshed his spores to his horse / and drew out he sword /
and turned to his pages / having no knowledge of any man / wenynge in
himself to be in a battle enclosed with his enemies / and lift up his sword
to stryke he cared not where / and cried and said. On on upon these traitors.
When the pages saw the king so inflamed with Ire / they took good head to
themself / as it was time. They thought the king had been dyspleased because
the spear fell down / thanne they stepte away fro the king. The duke of
Orleaunce was not as than^e far of fro the king. The king came to him with
his naked sword in his hand. The king was as than in such a fransey / and
his heart so feeble / that he another knew brother nor uncle. When the duke of
Orlyaunce saw the king coming on him with his sword naked in his hand ^he
was abashed and would not abide him / he wyste not what he mente / he dasshed
his spurs to his horse and rode away / and the king after him. The duke of
Burgoyne who rode a little way of fro the king when he herd the russhyng of
the horses / and herd the pages cry / he regarded that way / and saw how
the king with his naked sword chased his brother the duke of Orlyaunce / he
was sore abashed and said. Out harowe what myschife is this / the king is not
in his right mind / god help him. Fly away nephewe / fly away / for the
king would slay you. The duke of Orlyance was not well assured of him self /
and fled away as fast as his horse might bear him / and knights and
squyers followed after / every man began to draw thither. Such as were far of
thought they had chafed an hare or a wolf / till at last they herd that the
King was not well in his mind. The duke of Orlyance saved himself. Than men
of arms came all about the king / and suffered him to weary him self / and
the more that he traueyled the febler he was / and when he struck at any man /
they would fall down before the stroke. At this matter there was no hurt /
but many overthrown / for there was none that made any defense. Finally / when
the king was well ^eryed / and his horse sore chafed with sw^te / and great
heat / a knight of Normandy one of the kings chamber ^aynes / whom the king
loved very well / called Gyllyam Martell^ he came behind the king sodaynely
and took him in his arms / and held him still. Than all other aproched / and
took the sword out of his hands / and took him down fro his horse and did
of his ^acke three refresshe him. Than came his brother and his (...) uncles but
he had clean lost the knowledge of them / and rolled his eyes in his heed
marvelously / and spoke to no man. The lords of his blood were sore abashed
and wyste not what to said or do. Than the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne
said / it behooves us to recourne to Man's / this voyage is done for this
time. They said not as much as they thought / but they showed it right well
after when they came to Paris / to such as they loved not / as ye shall here
after.

REasonably to consydre all things acordynge to the truth / it was great
pytie that the french king (who as at that time was reputed for the most noble
and puyssaunt king in all crystendome / fell so suddenly out of his mind with
out remedy / but as god would. than the king was laid in a horse lyttoure /
and so brought back again to the City of Man's. Than the marshalles gave
knowledge to all the army / that they should return / and how that the
voyage was broken as at that time. some had knowledge why / and some not. The
night that the king came to Man's / the physicyons had much a do with him /
and the lords of the blood royal had great trouble. Every man spoke than in
dyuer^ manners. some said that such as had the rule about the king had
poisoned him / to bring the Realm of France in to shame and trouble. These
words multyplyed in such wise that the duke of Orlyance and his uncles and
other lords of the blood royal noted them / and spoke together and said.
How say you syrs / have ye not herd these words / and how men do murmr
in dyuets places upon them that has had the governance of the king. some
says he should be poisoned / let us sertche how this may be known. Than
some of them said how it should be best known by the physycyons / they ought
to know it / for they are acquaynted with his complexcyon. The physicyons were
sent for and examyned. They answered how the king of long time had engendered
the same malady / for we knew well the wekenes of his brain would sore trouble
him / and at last show it self / we have said as much before this time.
Than the duke of Burgoyne said. Syrs it is true / and therein ye did well
acquyte your self / but he would neither believe you nor us his affeciyon was
so sore set upon this voyage / it was devised in an yuell time. This voyage
has dishonored us all. It had been better that Clysson / and all those of
his affynyte had been deed many a day agone / rather than the king to have
taken this malady. These tidings shall sprede abroad in many places / and
seeing yt he is but a young man / the blame shall be laid in us that be his
uncles / and of his blood / men will say that we should otherwise have
counsayled him. Thus we shall be laid in the fault without cause. but sirs
quod the duke / yesterday when he went to dinner / were ye with him? The
physicyons answered and said yes. Did he eat his meat well quod the duke? No
certainly quod they / he did eat and drink but little / but sat and mused.
And who gave him drink last quod the duke? Sir quod they we can not tell you
that / for as soon as the table was taken up / we departed and made us ready to
ride / but his chamberlayns or butlers can tell that best. Than Robert de
Tulles a squire of Pycardy was sent for / and demanded who gave the king
drink last. Syrs quod he / sir Robert of Lygnac. Than he was sent for. Than
he was inquired where he had the wine that the king drank last of in his
chamber when he went to his horse. Sir quod he / here is Roberte of Tulles and
I / we took the say in the presence of the king. That is true quod Roberte
of Tulles / ye need not doubt therein nor have no suspeciousnesse / for as yet
there is of the same wine in the flagons / whereof we will drink and assaye
before you. Than the duke of Berrey said / this need not / for surely the king
is not poisoned / his malady proceeds of yuell counsel / it is no time to
speak of this matter now / let all alone till another season.

THus after this manner these lords departed each fro other that night / and
went to their lodgyage. Than the kings uncles had ordained four knights of
honor to wait about the king / as sir Raynolde du Royessyr Raynolde of Toye
/ the lord Grauseers / and sir Gyllyam of Mart / and the kings uncles sent
commandment to the lord dela River and to sir John^ Mercyer / to Montagu /
to the Begu of Vyllayns / to sir Gullyam of Bordes / and to sir Helyon of
Lygnac / that they should in no wise come about the king / till he were in
better estate. The next day the kings uncles came to se the king / and
found him right feeble. Than they demanded what rest he had taken that night.
They were answered / but small rest. That is poor news quod the duke of
Burgoyn. And than to them came the duke of Orlyance / and so went all together
to the king / and demanded of him how he did. He gave none answer / and
looked straungely on them / and had lost clean the knowledge of them. These
lords were sore abashed / and comuned together and said. We have no more here
to do / the king is in an herd case / we do him more trouble than aid or
good. Let us reco^maunde him to his chaumberlayns and physicyons / they can
best take heed to him / let us go study how the realm may be governed / or
else things will go amysse. Than the duke of Burgoyne said to the duke of
Berrey. Fair brother it is best we draw to Paris / and ordain to have the
king easily brought thither / for better we shall take heed on him there than
here in these parties / and when we be there let us assemble all the counsel
of France / and ordeyne who shall have the governance of the realm / the
duke of Orlayunce or we. That is well said quod the duke of Berrey / it were
good we studied where were best to have the king to lie that he might the
sooner recover his health. Than it was devised that he should be brought to the
castle of Crayell / where is good air / and a fair country on the river of
Oyse. when this was ordained than all the men of war had leave to depart /
and were commanded by the marshalles every man to return peasably in to his
own country / without doing of any vyolence or damage to the countries as
they should pass through / and if any did / their lords and capytayns to make
a mendes. And the kings two uncles and the chancellor of France sent anon
soundry messangers to the good Cities and towns of France / that they should
take good head to keep well their towns / considering that the king was not
well dysposed in his health. Their commandments were fulfilled. The people
of the realm of France were fore abashed when they knew how the king was
fallen sick and in a fransey / and men spoke largely against them that
counsayled the king to go in to Bretaygne. And some other said / how the
king was betrayed by them that bare the duke of Bretaygne and sir Peter Craon
against the king. Men could not be let / but that they would speak / the
matter was so high that words ran thereof dyuersely. Thus finally the king was
brought to Crayell / and there left in the keeping of his physicyons / and of
the said four knights. Than every man departed. And it was commanded to hyde
and to keep secret the kings malady fro the knowledge of the queen for a
seasone / for as than she was great with child. and all of her court were
commanded to keep it secret on pain of great punysshement. Thus the king
was at Crayell / in the marches of Seulis and of Compyen / on the river of Oyse
/ and kept by the said knights and physycions / who gave him medicyns / but
for all that he recovered but little health.

How the dukes of Burgoyn and Berrey uncles to the king had the governance
of the realm / and how they chased and took such as governed the king
before. Cap. C.lxxxix.
IN this seasone there was in ye realm of France a wise and a sage physicyon
/ the brewte was that there was none like him / and he was well be loved with
the lord Coucy / he was natyue of his country. As at that time his a bydyng
was in the cite of Laon / he was called master Guylliam of Harsley. When he
knew first the kings malady / and by what accydent he fell sick / he said
as he that thought him self to know the kings compleryon / how this maladye
is fallen to the king through fault his complexyon holds to much of ye
moyster of the sea. these words were reported to the lord Coucy / who was as
than at Paris with the duke of Orlyance and with ye kings uncles / for as than
the counsel of France the noble men and prelates were at Paris / to
determyne who should have the governance of the realm / as long as the king
should be in yt malady / outher his brother the duke of Orlyance / or his two
uncles / or one of the^. upon this co^munycacion they were a.xv. days or they
agreed. Finally it was concluded because the duke of Orlyaunce was very young
to take on him so great a charge / that the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne should
have the governance of the realm / and specially the duke of Burgoyne / and
that the duches of Burgoyne should be about the queen and to be as second
person. Thus as I have said before the lord of Coucy showed to the kings
uncles / the great wisdom and practyse of the said physycion / master
Guyllyam Harseley. When the dukes herd that they sent for him / and so he
came to Paris. And than the lord of Couey presented him to the kings uncles /
and said. My lords behold here is master Guyllyam Harseley / that I showed
you of. He is right welcome quod the dukes / they received him and made him
good chere / and ordained him to go to Crayell to vysyte the king / and to
abide about him till he had recovered his health. Than the said master at
their commandment went to Crayell to the king / and had the chief over
sight of mynystryng any thing to the king / and he saw well the kings malady
was curable / and saw how he had taken it by reasone of feblenesse of his
heart and heed / and through fault / therefore he did his dylygence to recover
his health.

THe tidings of the kings malady spread far abroad / but who so ever was
sorye / ye may well know the duke of Bretaygne nor sir Peter of Craon wept
never a deal / nor had no great sorrow. Also when pope Boryface of Rome and
his cardynals know the truth / they were right joyful / and drew together
in consistory / and said how their greatest enemy the French king was
beaten with a cruel rod / seeing god had taken fro him his wit / and said
how that influence was sent to him fro heaven to chastyce him withal /
because he had so much sustained the pope at Auignon / therefore this cruel
plage was sent to him to cause the hole realm to be better aduysed / therefore
they said their quarrel was the stronger. And truly to have wisely consydred
every thing it was a great token to have caused the cardynalles at Auygnon to
have been aduysed / but they made but little force thereof / another to the
honor of god nor to the realm / for the pope at Auignon and his cardynalles
said / how by reasone that the king was young / and would have his own will
/ thereby he is fallen in to this malady / through fault / for such as have had
the rule about him / have not done their duty / but have suffered him to
rynne on the bridell / and to ride night and day excessyuely in traueylynge of
his body out of measure. therefore such as has had the rule ought to be
charged therewith / and none other / for it is through their fault / for if
they had ordered him in his youth / and so continued by a reasonable regement /
and have followed the counsel of his uncles / this sycknesse had not fallen to
him now. Also he has broken his promise against reason / for he promised the
year passed and swear by the words of a king / that he would so ordain to
dystroy the antepape at Rome and his cardynals / and to subdue the sysme of the
church / and to set the matters that be in trouble in good estate / which is
nothing done / but has done contrary to his promise / wherewith god is
dyspleased / and to cause him better to advise him self / he has punysshed
him with this cruel rod. And if he return to helte / as he may well do /
than it shall behoue us to send to him sufficyent legates / to show him
wisely the defaute and brekyng of his promise / that he forgette it not by
reason of our neclyge^ce.

THus the pope and his cardynalles at Auignon spoke and comuned toguyder / and
laid the defaute of the kings malady / on the counsel of France / and on
such as were about the king in his chamber. Of the same oppinyon were many
other folks in the realm of France. They that were about the king sense the
kings offrynge to a town called Aresnecke / in the county of Heynaulte /
between Cambrey and Valencennes. In the which town there was a Church /
parteyninge to an abbey of saint Waste in Arrasce / wherein there lies a saint
called saint Acquayre / of whom there is a shrme of silver / which pylgrimage
is sought far and nere / for the malady or frasey. Thither was sent a man of
wax / representynge the French king / and was humbly offered to the saint /
that he might be mean to God / to assuage the kings malady / and to send him
health. In likewise the kings offrynge was sent to saint Hermyer in Romayes /
which saint had meryce to heal the Fransey. And in likewise o^rynges were
sent i^ to other places for ye same intent. Wha^ the tidings were come in to
England / the king and his counsel were sore troubled therewith / and
specially the duke of Lancastre / and he said to such knights and squyers as
were about him. Sirs / surely it is great pytic of the French king / for he
seemed to be a man of great enterprice / and of great desire to do well. He
said to me at Amyence when I departed fro him. Fair cosyn or Lancastre / I
desire you hertely to do your dylygence / that a ferme peace may be made
between our nephue the king of England and us / and our realms / to the
intent that we might go together against Lamorabaquyn / who has conquered the
Realm of Armony / and does that he can to distroye Christendom. By our goyne
thider our faith should be exalted / and we are all bound thereto. And now by
the French kings malady the matter is sore let and hyndred for he shall
never be of the credence he was of before. All that herd the duke said. It
was true / and that it was like to be great trouble in France.

Thus all manner of people both tar and nere spoke and devised of the kings
maladye / and the king lay still at Crayle / in the keeping of the foresaid
knights / and of master Guyllyam of Harsely: And no man spoke with the king
/ nor entered in to the castle but such as were ordained thereto. Sometime the
duke of Orlyaunce and the duke of Burbone / came thither to visyte the king /
and the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne lay still at Paris / and had done
nothing of new / but they were in purpose shortly to do somewhat / against
such as they loved not / because they had been always hard to them before.
and the duke of Berrey said to the duke of Burgoyne. Brother / le River /
Clysson / le Mercyer / and the Begue of Vallayns / when they were with the
king in Languedocke / ccuelly they punysshed to death / my treasourer and good
servant Betysache by euuy. And for all that I could do or say / I could not
get him out of their hands / nor save his lyre. Therefore now let them
beware or me / for I shall pay them again with the same money / forged in ye
same forge. In likewise the duke of Burgoyne could not jove them that governed
the king for ever whane he had any business to do in the court / they were
ever against him. Also the same time the duchess of Burgoyne / who was a
cruel lady / was about the queen as chief ruler / and non spoke with the queen
but by her means.

THis lady hated mortally sir Olyuer of Clyisone for love of the duke of
Bretayne / for he was nere of blood to her / and often times she spoke to the
duke her husband / saying how he was greatly to blame to bear so much sir
Olyuer of Clisson against so myghtie a prince / as the duke of Brecaygne. And
the duke of Burgoyne / who was a cold / a sage / and an ymaginatyue prince /
and did his business always at length / and would not wyllyng bring the
realm of France in to trouble / but always wyllyng to keep all perties in
love and peace / as nere as he might. And also as he yt was never wyllyng to
displease any of ye great lords answered right sagely and wisely to his wife.
Dame quod he / it is good in all times so^what to dissymnle a man's
displeasure. True it is our cosyn of Bretayne is a great lord / and has
seignorie and puissaunce enough against sir Olyuer of Clysson / if I had
taken his part against Clysson / it should greatly have weaked the Realm of
France. For sir Olyuer of Clyssone says and sustayneth / that all the hate
that he has to the Duke of Bretaygne / is to sustain up the realm of France
wherein we have great part. And also this is the common renome in France. Also
(as yet) I have seen no article / wherein I should take part with my cosyn of
Bretaygne against sir Olyuer of Clysson. therefore it has behooved me to
dissymule / or else I could not have had the good will of ye king nor of the
realm / whereto I am more bound by faith and service / than to ye duke of
Bretaygne. Now it is so that the king is not in good case (as ye know well)
and all this is against the lord Clisson / and shall be. and to such as have
given counsel against us / my brother of Berrey and me / that the king should
proceed in his journey to Bretaygne The rod is gadered wherewith they shall be
shortly beaten and corrected: as ye shall breuely here / if yet will take a
little patience.

Dame dame / there is no season / but at last is paid: Nor no fortune / but
that sometime tourneth: Nor heart troubled / but sometime again rejoices: Nor
none that is joyful / but sometime is sorry and troubled. Clysson / le River /
Montague / le Mercyer / and le Vyllayns: they have done yuell / and that shall be
showed them breuely. With such like words the duke of Burgoyne and the
duchess his wife sported the^ toguyder.

ON a day it happed that ye duke of Burgoyne and the duke of Berrey co^muned
secretly together / and said. It were time that we began to distroye them that
have dishonored our nephue the king / and have led him at their wylles. And
first let us begin at the constable / he is ye grettest and has most to lose /
for this other day he made his testament of seuyntene hundred thousa^de
frankes. Where the devil has he gadered toguyder all that richesse? And yet
the mary age of his daughter to Johan of Bretayne / whom he delivered out of
prison in England and paid for his rau^some two hundred thousand frankes of
England. Let us se what points we can lay to him by reason / for our nephue
the duke of Orleaunce bears him greatly / and so do diverse other barons of
France. How be it and we stycke thereto / we shall find matter enough to him
by law and parlyament. That is true quod the duke of Burgoyne. And the first
time that he comes to speak with me (and that I think will be or to morrow at
night) I shall so receive him / that he shall well know that I love him not /
and if he come to you good brother of Berrey do likewise. That shall be done
quod he / and so departed at that time.

SO it fortuned that the lord of Clysson / who knew nothing but that he had
been in good grace with the said dukes. And certain knights and squiers
(such as had been in the said voyage with the king) came to the constable /
and were sent by the chaunceller and treasourers to him / to pursue for money
for their wages. Whereupon in a morning he came to ye house of Arthois in Paris
/ to show the state of ye business to the duke of Burgoyne / and to none
other / because he had the hole governance of the realm of France. Whan^e
he came thither he entered in to the court / for the porter had let him in.
Than he a lyghted and mounted the steares in to the hall / alone lie acompanyed
with one squire / and in the hall he found.ii. squyers of the dukes. than he
demanded if he might speak with the duke or not. Sir quod they we can not tell
you / tarry here and we shall go and know his pleasure. The squiers entered in
to the dukes chamber and found him at good leysar / talkyng with an heraude /
who was come fro a great feast that had been holden in Almaigne. Than the
squiers said. Sir / the Constable is in your hall / and says he is come to
speak with you if it be your pleasure. A goddesname quod the duke let him
come in / we be at good leysar to here what he will say. One of the squiers
went in to the hall and said to the constable. sir come on / my lord will have
you to come in. The constable entered / and when the duke saw him he changed
color / and repented in that he had caused him to come in to his chamber / and
yet he had great desire to speak with him. The Constable did of his hatte and
made his reverence to the duke and said. Sir I am come to you / to know of
the state and governance of the realm / and how every thing shall be ordered /
for by reason of mine office I am daily called upon / and as now / you and my
lord of Berrey have the rule / therefore it may please you to show me what I
shall do. The duke lightly answered and said. Clysson Clysson / ye have
nothing to do to busye you with the gouernynge of the realm / ye have meddled
therewith to long / and in an yuell time. How the devil have ye gadered such
richesse / as ye made your testament of but late? The king nor my brother of
Berrey nor I / have not so much. Go your way depart out of my presence /
and let me no more se you / for and it were not for my shame / I should put
out your better eye. And therewith the duke deperted and left the lord Clysson
alone / who issued out of the chamber and hanged down his heed / and so passed
through the hall / and in the court took his horse with his company / and
returned privily in to his lodgyng without spekyng of any word.

How sir Olyuer of Clysson Constable of France departed out of Paris / after
the answer that the duke of Burgoyne had made him / and went to Mount le
Heury / and fro thens in to Bretayne. Cap. C.xc.
When the lord of Clysson was returned to his lodging / he was in many
ymaginacyons / to remember what was best for him to do. for he parceyued well
the matters went but yuell for him / nor he wyste not to whom to make his
complaynt / nor to declare his business / for the duke of Orlyaunce was at
Crayell. and though he had been at Paris / yet it lay not in his power to
defend him / and he feared lest the duke of Burgoyne would have caused him to
be arested / and to spoil his house. Wherefore he durst not abide that
adventure / but shortly made him ready / and showed to certain of his
servants what he would do. And against night he went out of his lodgyng
privily on the backesyde and but three persons with him / and issued out of
Paris at the gate of saint Anchony / and passed the river of Seyne at the
bridge of Charenton. And roode so long that he came to a Castle of his own /
a seuyn leages fro Paris / called Mount le Heury / and there tarried till he
hero other tidings. The same day that the duke of Burgoyne had spoken with
the Constable. The duke of Berrey and he met toguyder / for they assembled at
the palace to commune toguyder of certain matters / touching the Realm. Than
the duke of Burgoyne showed his brother what he had said to sir Olyuer of
Clysson. The duke of Berrey answered and said. ye have done well / for we must
have a beginning to enter upon them. For surely Clysson / le River / Mercier
and Mo^tague / have robbed the realm of France / but the time is come that
they shall leave all yea / and lose their lives / and I may be believed.

THe same proper day that the Constable departed / Montague in likewise
departed secretly / by the gate saint Anthony / and took the way to Trois in
Champayne and in to Burgoyne / and said he would not rest till he came to
Auygnon / for thither he had sent before the chief of his richesse / and left
a certain with his wife to keep her estate curtesly. For he saw well sith
the king had lost his wit / that all matters should go but yuell for him. for
he saw how the dukes of Burgoyne and Berrey would not speak to him. Sir Johan
Mercier in likewise would feign have been gone and he might / But there was
such watch laid on him / that he could not go out of his lodging / without
knowledge. And such of his goods as he had saved before / stood him in
right good stead afterward. For as much as could be found of his / was
departed between the dukes of Burgoyn and Berrey / and he was committed by them
to prisone / in to the castle of Loure. And in likewise so was commanded the
Begue of Vyllayns earl of Rebydewe in Spain. There were men sent to the house
of Montague / but he was not found / nor no man knew where yt he was become.
In lykecase to the Constables house to have had him to prison but he could not
be found / for there was no man there but the kepar / who knew nothing where
he was become. And within two days after / it was known that he was at his
castle of Mount le Heury. When the dukes that loved him not knew that / they
ordained the Barroys of Bars / sir John^ of Castle Morant / the lord of
Coucy / and sir Wyllyam of Tremoyle / with three hundred spears to go thither /
and commanded them to besiege the Town and castle / and not to depart thens
/ till they had brought sir Olyuer of Clysson to the^ / outher quick or deed.
These knights did as they were commanded / they durst do none otherwise /
for the two dukes had the admynistracion of the realm. So they departed fro
Paris with a three hundred spears / but not all at one time but in five parts
/ to the intent to be the less known. But god aided so well the Constable /
and had so good friends of some in that company / that he had such warning /
that he took no do^mage / for he and his company departed and rode by covert
ways through woods / and left closed towns / so that at last he came
surely in to Bretaygne / and entered in to a castle of his own called the
castle Ioselyn / and there tarried to here other news. For all that the
Barrois or Bars and the other knights in his company / let not to do their
enterprice as they were charged / but came to Mount le Heury / and entered in to
the town / and besieged the castle and tarried there all a night / wenynge
that the Constable had been within / but he was gone / as ye have herd: and
the next morning they thought to assaute the Castle. The servants within
the castle sent out to know what they would have / or what they demanded.
They said they would have sir Olyuer of Clysson / and therefore they were come.
They answered and said / that he was departed thens four days passed / and
offered to open the gates to sertche for him. the knights went in to the
castle with all their company armed / for scare of enbusshement within the
castle. They sertched high and low and found for truth that he was not
there. Than^e they departed and returned to Paris / and showed how they had
sped.

When the dukes of Burgoyne and Berrey knew that sir Olyuer Clysson was escaped
/ they were sore displeased / and the dukes of Orlyaunce and of Burbone right
joyful. Than the duke of Burgoyne said. It seems well that he douteth him
self / seeing he is fled away. yet for all yt he is so quytte / we shall
cause him to come again shortly / or les he shall lose all that he has /
that we can set our hands on. for we have to lay to his charge / diverse
artycles unreasonable / which require judgment of punisyon. and if such as be
great be not corrected / the matters shall not be equally proporcioned / for
such as be but small personages shall grudge / and say they have wrong to be
punysshed / and the great to escape. therefore justice ought to be equal / and
to spare another great nor small / whereby any ensample should grow. Thus the
duke of Burgoyn devised of sir Olyuer of Clysson / who was in Bretaygne / in
his castle called Ioselyn / which forteresse was well provided for of all
things necessary. When the Barrois of Bars was returned to Paris / and had
showed that sir Olyuer of Clysson was departed fro Mount le Heury / and gone to
the castle of Ioselyn in Bretayne. Tha^ he was commanded to go to Amyence and
there to take the lord de la River. The next day he rode with his company to
Amyence / a fair forteresse beside Charters / which the lord de la River
held by right of his wife / the lady of Man's. He had greatly amended that
castle / and was well-beloved of the men of his country / for he loved always
nothing but troth. Than the dukes co^missyoners came thither and did as they
had in charge / and found the lord de la River there / and his wife and his
children. the knight looked for nothing else / for he might have been gone before
if he had list / for he had knowledge that sir Johan Mercyer and the earl of
Ribydewe were in prisone / and that the Constable was fled in to Bretaygne.
And he was counsayled before by one of his friends / who said to him. Sir /
save your self / for the enuyous do now reygne / and fortune as now is on
their sides. He answered and said. Here and else where / I am at the pleasure
of god. If I should fly or hyde my self / I should yield my self gyltie /
where I know my self clear. God has given me that I have / and he may take
it fro me when it is his pleasure. The will of god be fulfilled. I have served
king Charles / and now his son well and trewly. My service has been well
known with them / and they have greatly rewarded me. And seeing that I have so
truly served at their commandments / and traueyled for the business of the
realm of France / I dare well abide the judgment of the parlyament chamber in
Paris. and if they can find any fault in my deeds or words / let me be
punysshed. Thus the lord de la River said to his wife and to his counsel.
This he said or the dukes co^myssioners ca^e to his castle. At last one
showed him and said. Sir / here comes such men and such with a great army.
Now say you / shall we opyn the gates or not? yea quod he what else / they
are welcome. Therewith he went and met them / and received them one after
another right honorably. Thus they all entered in to the castle of Man's. Than
the barroies of Bars when they were within the hall executed his
commandment / and arested the lord de la River / who obeyed meke lie. Thus
he was prisoner in his own castle of Man's. It may well be thought that the
good lady his wife was sore disco^fyted / when she saw fortune courne her
whele / against her lord and husband / and also she douted the conclusyon.

THus the lord de la River was prisoner in his own Castle of Mains. And
anon after he was sent for by them that had the governance / both of the
temporaltie and of the spirytualtie. For pope Clement of Auignon had nothing in
the realm of France / but by their means. The lord de la River was brought
to Paris / and set in prison in the castle of Loure. Many men in the realm of
France had great pytie on him / how be it they durst not speak but privily.
The people cared not so much for the trouble of sir Johan Mercyer / as they
did for the lord de la River. For he was always sweet / curtesse / meke /
pacyent / and gencyll to poor men: and a good mean always for them that might
not be herd. It was said daily in Paris / that these prisoners should lose
their heedes. And a sclaundre ran upon them / how they were traitors against
the crown of France / and pylled the realm / and thereby kept their great
ports and estates: and made fair houses / castelles / and buyldynges. And
other poor knights and squiers / such as had adventured their bodies and
members in deeds of arms / and served truly the realm of France / and had
sold and laid to pledge their herytages / and yet could not be paid / for
that they had served / Another by the constable nor by none of them that were in
prisone: nor hy Mo^tague that was fled. The enuyous condemned and judged
them to dye. So by reason of this they were in great danger / and also it was
said that by their counsel the king took on him the journey in to Bretaygne /
whereby he fell in to that maladye of Fransey / and had given him drinks of
poison at their pleasure and how that the kings phisycions could not be herd
nor believed / by reason of them. Such matters were laid to the lord de la
Ryuers charge and to sir Johan Mercyer / that they were delivered out of the
Castle of Loure / in to the hands of the provost of Paris / and put in to
the castle of saint Anthony / in the keeping of the Vicount of Achy who as than
was Chateleyne there. When it was known that they were there / tha^ the common
brute ran / that they should be executed to death. But to say truth / there
was no cause why to trouble them. For such as hated them / could find in
their conscience / no cause why they ought to dye. But every day they were
borne in hand / and it was said to them. Sirs / think on your souls / for
as for your bodies are but lost / for ye are judged to dye / and for to be
beheeded. In this case they were in Prisone a great space. The Begue of
Vyllayns a right valiant knight in arms / of the country of Beance / who was
in prisone also for ye same cause. He had such friends and was so aided that
he was delivered out of prison / and was clean pardoned of all things. And
such as were of his lynage / as sir Barroys and other / counsayled him to go
in to Castyle / where as he had fair herytages / by reason of his wife /
countess of Ribydewe / and as he was counsayled so he dyede. And as soon as
he might departed out of France and went in to Castyle / and the other two
knights remained still in prison / in danger of losyng of their lives.

ALl the mouable and immovable gods and possessions parteyninge to sir Johan
Mercyer within Paris and without / in the realm of France / that might be
laid hand on / was taken as goods forfaite / and given to other persons. his
fair house of the bridge of Aubumen in the dioces of Laon / which had cost
him a great good / was given to the lord Coucy / with all the appurtenau^ce. I
know not wheder the lord of Coucy desired it or not / but sir Johan Mercier
was disheryted / he and his heirs for ever. Also the lord de la River was
sore handled. True it was / all his mouables was taken away / and such
lands as he had bought / reserving to the lady of Man's his wife all her
herytages / which came by her by father and mother. Also he had a young
damsel to his daughter of.x. year or age / who was married to a young
gentylman called Jacques of Chastellon / son to sir Hugh of Chastellon / who
had been before master of the crosbowes of France. and he was heir to his
father / and had fair herytages / and was lykely to enjoy more / how be it
against the young man's mind / he was dismaryed. And married again to another
gentylwoman / at the pleasure of the duke of Burgoyne and of the lord de la
Tremoyle / who took on them that quarrel. more over / the lord de la River had
a son to his heir / which son was married to ye daughter of the earl
Dampmartyne. And the earl had no mo children nor was not like to have which
daughter was his heir. And the duke would have broken that marriage / and have
married her unto an heir of blood / But the earl Dampmartyne like a valiant
knight would not / but said. As long as the lord de la Ryuers son had life
in his body / his daughter should have none other husband and said / he would
put her heritage in to such me^nes hands / that he trusted such as would
wrongfully have it / should not attain thereto. When the earls mind was known
they let him alone. So that marriage stood still / but the first marriage was
broken / and pope Clement made a dispensacyon wheder he would or not / for as
at that time the pope had no more puissaunce in France / Than such as the
governors would consent to. The church was so subject / what by reason of
the Scisme / and by them that governed France. Many men specially in the
realm of France / excused greatly the lord de la River / but all that would
not serve / For none durst speak though they saw the matter never so clear.
Except all only the valya^t lady Jane of Boloyne / duchess of Berrey.
Oftentimes the good lady would fall on her knees before her husband / holding
up her hands and saying. Ah sir / ye suffer to much the enuyous to inform
you so wrongfullye / against the valiant knight. The lord de la River he has
clearly wrong / there is none that dare speak for him but I. And sir / I will
ye know that if he dye thus / I shall never have joy in this world / but I
shall always continue still in sorrow and heaviness / for he is a true and a
valyant knight. Ah sir / ye consider but little the fair service that he has
done to you or this time: ye pains and traueyle that he has had for you and
for me / to bring us together in marriage. I say it not for any thing of bostyng
of my self / for I am but little worth in comparyson to you. But when ye
would needs have me / ye remember how hard the earl of Foiz was to you / with
whom I was brought up / And if the sweet words / and wise demeanor of the
lord de la River had not been / I had never come in to your company / but I
had been rather as now in England. For the duke of Lancaster would have had me
for his son the earl of Derby / and the earl of Foiz enclyned rather that
way tha^ to you. Right dear sir / ye ought to remember this / for all that I
say is true. Wherefore I require you right humbly / that this gentle knight who
brought me to you / have no do^mage of his body nor of his members. The duke of
Berrey who saw his wife fair and gentle / and loved her with all his heart /
and also knew well that all she had said was true / it molifyed greatly his
heart toward the lord de la River / and to apease his wife / because he saw
she spoke with good heart / said unto her. Dame as god help me I would it had
cost me.xx. thousa^de frankes / on the condycion the lord de la River had
never made forfette to the crown of France / for before this malady came to
the king / I loved him entierly / and took him for a wise and a sage knight.
but sithe ye desire so effectuously for him I will do no dyspleasure to him /
he shall fare much the better at your instaunce / and for your sake I shall do
as much for him as my power may extend / and rather at your desire than and
all the realm had spoken for him / for surely I se well it is alms to help
him / and I believe he has no advocate but you. Thus the lady was well pleased
with her lords words / for surely and she had not ben he had been deed / but
for her sake the duke of Berrey dyssymuled the matter / and that was happy for
sir Johan Mercyer / for he and the lord de la River were accused for one cause
/ wherefore the dukes had conscience to cause one to dye and not the other /
how be it for all the promise that was made to them / yet they thought them
self not well assured of their lives / as long as they were in prison / for
they saw well they had as than many enemies / who as tha^ reigned and were in
their prosperyte / and some were right angry that they were saved so long /
and they could amended it. Sir Johan Mercyer being in prisone wept so
contynually / that he had almost lost his sight / it was pytie to se his
lamentacyon.

While these two knights were thus in prisone more than a year / and no man
knew what end should come of them. Than the dukes and their counsel did all
that they could to have taken sir Olyuer Clysson / and to have put him fro his
honor and office. They had rather have had him than all the resydewe / but he
kept him self out of their hands / wherein he did wisely / for if he had been
taken they had so ordained for him / that he should have had judgment of death
without remedy / and all for envy to have pleased thereby his adversary the duke
of Bretaygne / who never did good in the realm of France. when the lords
saw yt he was escaped their hands / they took other advise / and did as ye
shall here. They so^moned him to apere in the parlyame^t chamber at Paris / to
answer to such articles as he was accused of / on pain to lose his honor and
to be banysshed the realm of France / certain co^myssioners were sent in to
Bretaygne to so^mon him to apere. They that were sent rode in to Bretaygne /
and demanded where as they came where sir Olyuer of Clysson was / and said
how they were sent by the king to speak with the constable / wherefore they
desired to know where he was. The men of such towns and garysons as held of
the constable were determined before what answer to make / and said / syrs ye
be welcome / and if ye will speak with the cou^stable ye must go in to such a
place / there we think ye shall find him without fault. So the co^myssyoners
were sent fro town to town / but they could not find him. And so long they
sought that they were weary / and so returned to Paris / and declared what they
had seen and found. such as had accused him were glad that he dalte so /
for than they said his falsnesse was plainly showed / and thereby acordyng to
reason they said he should have as he had deserved. Than by the course of the
parlyament they proceeded to all his so^monynges / to thentent that such as
loved him should not say he had any wrong / by Envy or hatred. And when all
his.xv. so^monynges were accompilsshed / and that they could here no tidings
of him / nor of his aparaunce / and that he had been openly called at the
parlyament chamber door / and on the steyres / and in the court / with all
other seremonyes thereto belonging / and no answer made for him / he had
process made against him cruelly in the parlyament. There he was openly
banysshed the realm of France as a false traitor against the crown of
France / and judged to pay a hundred thousand mark of silver for the
extorcyons he had done / and for that he had so traftely in time paste
occupied the office of the constablery of France / and therefore to lose for
ever without recovery the said office. At the gyueng of this sentence the duke
of Orleaunet was desired to be present / but he would not / and excused
himself / but the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyn were there with many other great
lords of the Realm of France. Thus a man may se the wa^kes of fortune / how
ferme and stable they be / seeing how this good and valiant knight / who in
his days had so much traueyled for the realm of France / and as than was
put to so much shame / as to be dysgrated fro honor and goods. How be it
he was happy he appeared not at their so^monynge / for if he had / surrly he had
shamfully lost his life. As than the duke of Orlyance durst not speak for him
/ if he had / it should have done him no good. It is not to be douted but that
the duke of Bretaygne and sir Peter of Craon were right joyful of those
tydinges how be it they were sorry that he was not prisoner in Paris as well as
sir Johan Mercier and the lord de la River. Of this shamfull banysshing great
brute ran thereof in the realm of France and else where. some compleyned
secretly and said that he had wrong. And some other said he was worthy to be
hanged / and that he had well deserved it. and moreover said / how the dyuell
could he assemble together so much rychess as a myllyon and an half of
florayns? he could never get that by ryghtwyse means / but rather by
polling and robbyng / and retaynyng to himself the wages of the poor
knights and squyers of the realm of France that had deserved it. as it may
well appear in the chaunceryor treasory / where every thing is written and
regestred / in the voyage that the King made in to Flaunders. there and than
he raised great profit to his own use / and also in the voyage to Almayne /
for all manner of tails and subsydyes that were raised in the Realm to pay
men of war / passed through his hands he paid where as it pleased him / and
the rest he kept to himself and none durst speak against it. In this manner
sir Olyuer of Clysson was accused in many men's mouths. It is said in an
old prourebe / he that has mysfortune / every man offers him wrong. If the
french king / the duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burgoyne had not ben / the
duke of Bretaygne had been able to have subdued sir Olyuer of Clysson / seeing
he was in the dukes country / but he suffered him for a season to se how the
matters should proceed. Also he saw well that sir Olyuer of Clysson was set on
the heyght of fortunes whele / and as than again he saw how he was cast
down / and like to lose his office. Thus the duke of Bretayne and sir Peter of
Craon were set upon their fete / and all by the works of fortune / which is
never parmanent / but now up / now down. The constable sir Olyuer of Clysson
/ the lord de la River / and sir Johan Mercyer / were principally acused for
the chief cousers of the kings malady. And such as loved them not / said how
they had poisoned the king. how be it every man may consydre by reason that
it was not so / for they were the persons that should lose most by the kings
malady / wherefore it is to be thought they sought most for his health / but
they could not be believed. So the two knights remained still in prison in
danger openly to have lost their heedes / and by all lykelyhode so they had
done / if the king had not recovered his health / and by the mean of the
duchess of Berrey / who made instante labor for the lord de la River. And
the lord Clysson was still in Bretayne / and made sore war against the duke
there / and the duke against him / which war cost many a man's life / as ye
shall here / here after in this hystory.

True it is this sycknesse that the king took in the voyage toward Bretayne
/ greatly abated the joy of the realm of France / and good cause why / for
when the heed is sick the body can have no joy. No man durst openly speak
thereof / but kept it privy as much as might be / and it was covertly kept fro
the queen / for till she was delivered and churched she knew nothing thereof /
which time she had a daughter. The physycion master Guyllyam / who had the
chief charge of healynge of the king / was still about him / and was right
dyligent / and well acquyted himself / whereby he gate both honor and profit
/ for little and little he brought the king in good estate / and took away the
sever and the heat / and made him to have taste and appetyte to eat and
drink / sleep and rest / and knowledge of every thing. how be it he was very
feeble / and little and little he made the King to ride a hunting and on
hawkynge. And when tidings was known through France how the king was
well mended / and had his memory again / every man was joyful / and thanked
god. the king thus being at Crayell / desired to se the queen his wife and the
Dolphyn his son. So the queen came thither to him / and the child was brought
thither. The king made them good chere / and so little and little through the
help of god / the king recovered his health. And when master Guyllyam saw
the king in so good case / he was right joyful / as reasone was / for he had
done a fair cure / and so delivered him to the dukes of Orlyance / Berrey /
Burgoyne / and Burbone / and said. My lords / thanked be god the king is now
in good state and health / so I deliver him / but beware let no man dysplease
him / for as yet his spyrytes be not fully ferme nor stable / but little and
little he shall wax strong. Reasonable dysporte / rest / and myrthe shall be
most profitable for him / and trouble him as little as may be with any
counsayles / for he has been sharply handeled with a hot malady. Than it was
consydred to retaygne this master Guylliam / and to give him that he should be
content with all / which is the end that all physicions require / to have
gifts and rewards. He was desired to abide still about the king / but he
excused himself and said how he was an old impotent man / and could not
endure the manner of court / wherefore he desired to return in to his own
country. When the counsel saw he would none otherwise do / they gave him
leave / and at his departing gave him a thousand crowns / and retained him in
wages with four horses when so ever he would resort to the court. How be it
I believe he never came there after / for when he returned to the city of Laon
/ there he continued and dyed a rich man. He left behind him a.xxx.
thousand frankes. All his days he was one of the greatest nygardes that ever
was / all his pleasure was to get good / and to spend nothing / for in his
house he never spente past two souses of Paris in a day / but would eat and
drink in other men's howses / where as he might get it. With this rod
lightly all physicyons are beaten.

How the truse which was acorded between England and France for three years
/ was renewed. Cap. C.xci.
AS ye have herd here before in the books of this high and excellent hystory /
at the request of the right high and mighty prince / my dear lord and master
Guy of Chastellone / earl of Blois / lord of Auesnes / of Chymay / of Beaumont
/ of Streumehont / and of the Good. I Johan Froysart priest and chapeleyn to my
said lord / and at that time treasourer and chanon of Chymay / and of Lysle in
Flaunders / have enterprised this noble matter / treating of the adventures and
wars of France and England / and other countries conjoined and a lied to
them / as it may apere clearly / by the treaties thereof made unto the date of
this present day / the which excellent materes as long as I live by the
help of god I shall co^tynue / for the more I follow and labor it / the more
it pleases me. As the noble knight or squire loving the feats of arms / do
perceyuer in the same / and be thereby expert and made parfyte / so in
laboring of this noble matter / I delight and take pleasure. It has been here
before contained in our hystory how truce was made at Balyngham / to endure
three year between England and France / and for that purpose the earl of saint
Poll / the lord of Castle Morant / and sir Taupyn of Cauteuell / ambassadors
of France had been in England with the duke of Lancastre and the duke of york
/ for to understand the kings pleasure / and the opynion of the commons of
England / for at the comunycacyon and parlyamente at Amyence / they were at a
point of agreement of peace / upon certain artycles specifyed / reserving the
agreement thereto of the commons of England. thus these ambassadors were
returned in to France / and were answered how that at the feast of saint
Mychell next ensuynge / there should be a Parlyament at Westmynster of the
three estates of England / at which time the matter should be declared / and a
full answer made. When tidings was come in to England of the french kings
sycknesse / that matter was greatly hyndred / how be it king Richard of
England / and the duke of Lancastre / had great affection to have had peace /
so that if they might have had their ententes / peace had been made between
England and France. But the co^mynalte of England desired war / saying
how war with France was more conuenyent for them than peace. and of that
opinion was one of the kings uncles / The mas duke of Glocestre / earl of
Perces / and constable of England / who was well-beloved in the realm / he
enclyned rather to the war than to peace. And of his opinion were the young
gentylmen of the realm / such as desired feats of arms. But his brother the
duke of Lancastre / because he was eldest and of most puissaunce in England /
he thought and said that the war between England and France had endured
long enough / and that peace were more mete* for by the war cristende me
was sore febled / for the great turk Lamorabaquyn was with great puyssaunce
on the fronters of Hu^gery wherefore he said it should be honorable to all young
lusty knights and squyers to take their way thither / and there to exercise
deeds of arms.

Let us wisely consydre the duke of Lancasters words / who spoke them of
good intent / for he had greatly traueyled in the wars of France / and
conquered but little / and sore traueyled his body / brent and dystroyed the
plain countries in his way / and after his return sone recovered again / he
saw this war drew never to n^ne ^nde / but rather increased. Also he saw
that if / fortune should turn against ye englyssh party / that great do^mage
thereof should ensue / and parceyued well that the king his nephue was enclyned
much rather to the peace than to the war. I Johan Froysart auctoure of this
hystory / can not well say / whether this dukes opinyon was good or not /
but it was showed me that because the duke of Lancastre saw his two daughters
married in higher degree than himself / and out of the realm of England / the
one was queen of Spaygne / the other Queen of Portugale. This caused him greatly
to enclyne to the peace / for he knew well that the king of Spaygnes son /
who had married his daughter / was as than but young / and in danger of his
own subgiettes / and knew well that if he should peasably enjoy the heritage
of Spaygne / it was conuenyente that the english men should keep the peace
with France / for if the peace should be broken by any incydent / than the
French men might shortly be revenged of the realm of Spain, for they had
open entrees as well through Aragon and Chathalone / as Bierne and Byskay / for
the lady yolant of Bare was queen of Aragone / and she was good french and
governed Aragon / Chathalone / Bierne / and Byskay / for the Vycount of
Chatellon / who was heir to therle of Foiz had so sworn and promised the
french queen / whereby the french men had many fair entrees in to Spaygne
without danger of the king of Nauer / who would not wyllyngly dysplease the
french king his cosyn germayne / for as than sir Peter of Nauerre his brother
/ was with the french king / who always apeased the french kings ire and
dyspleasure / when he had any to his brother the King of Nauer / for he was a
true french man / and never found the contrary. All these imagynacions the
duke of Lancastre had in him self / and showed his mind to his son the earl
of Derby / though he were but young / yet he was of great wisdom / and lykely
to come to great honor / which earl had three son / Johan / Humfrey / and
Thomas / and two daughters by the lady his wife / daughter and heir to the
Earl constable of England / earl of Herforde and Northampton / by which lady
he held great heritage.

THe conclusyon of the parlyament holden at Westmynster by the three estates of
the realm. A trewce was taken by see and by land / between France and
England / their friends and alyes / to endure fro the feast of saint Mychell /
to the feast of saint Johan Baptyst next after / and such co^myssioners as
the french king had sent to this parlyament were dyspatched / and the charter
of the truce sent by them sealed / which treuce was well vpholden on all
parties. The French king was sore febled by reason of his syckenesse / and
the physicyon master Guyllyam Harselay was as than deed / but when he departed
fro Crayell fro the king / he ordained many receytes for the king to use /
whereby in the winter season he recovered his health / whereof all his lovers and
friends reioysed / with the hole co^mynalte of France / for he was well be
loved / and so he and the queen came to Paris / and held their householde most
part at saint Powle / and sometime at Loure / and the long winter nyghtes they
passed the season with daunsynge and carollynge / and other revels and
dysportes. The queen was acompaned with the duchess of Berrey / the duchess
of Orlyance / and other ladies. The same season the Vycount of Chastellon was
come to Paris / who was newly entered in to the heritage of the erledome of
Foize and of Bierne / as right heir / and he releued the said erledom of Foiz
/ and did his homage to the king but not for Bierne / for that country held
themself of so noble condycion / that they held service to no man living.
How be it the prince of Wales said to the earl of Foiz that last dyed / that
he ought to releue of him / and to have his resort to the Duchy of Acquitayne.
But always the said earl denied and defended it. And it is to be thought that
the challenge that the prince of Wales made thereunto / was by the setting on
and mouyng of Johan earl of Armynake / as it has been showed here before in
this history / wherefore as now I will over pass it. When this vicount of
Chastellon (called fro henseforthe earl of Foiz) was at Paris with the french
king / he had there in his company with him his cosyn sir yuan of Foize /
bastard son to the last Earl of Foize / who was a goodly knight. The earl
of Foiz or he dyed would have made him his heir / with a another of his
bastard sons called Gracian / who dwelte as than with the king of Nauer /
but the knights of Bierne would never consent thereto / therefore the matter
rested as it did / and the earl dyed suddenly (as ye have herd before) When
the French king saw this young knight sir yuan of Foiz / he lyked him
marvelous well / also the king and he were much of one age / and by reason
of the favor that the king bare to this young knight / the earl of Foiz had
the shorter speed / and was delivered of all his business / and than departed
in to his own country / and sir yuan abode still with the king / and
retained as one of his knights of his chamber / with.xii. horses / and all
other things thereto belonging.

Of the adventure of a dance that was made at Paris in likeness of wodehowses
/ wherein the French King was in parell of death. Cap. C.xcii.
IT fortuned / that sone after the retaynmge of this foresaid knight / a
marriage was made in the kings house / bytwen a young knight of Vermandoys /
and one of the queen's gentylwomen / and because they were both of the kings
house / the kings uncles and other lords / ladies / and damoselles made great
tryumphe. There was the dukes of Orlyaunce / Berrey / and Burgoyne / and their
wives / daunsynge and making great joy. The king made a great supper to the
lords and ladies and the queen kept her estate / desirynge every man to be
merry. And there was a squire of Normandy called Hogreymen of Gensay / he
aduysed to make some pastyme. The day of the marriage which was on a tuesday
before Candelmas / he provided for a mummery against night. He devised six
cotes made of lynen clothe / covered with pytche and thereon flare like hear /
and had them ready in a chamber. The king put on one of them / and therle of
Iouy / a young lusty knight another / and sir Charles of Poicters the third /
who was son to the earl of Valentenoys / and to sir yuan of Foiz another /
and the son of the lord Nanthorillet had on the fyfte / and the squire him
self had on the syxte. And when they where thus arrayed in these said cotes and
sowed fast in them / they seemed like wild wode houses full of bear fro the
top of the heed to the soul of ye foot. This deuyse pleased well the
french king / and was well content with the squire for it. They were
aparelled in these cotes secretly in a chamre that no man knew thereof / but
such as help them. When sir yuan of Foiz had well aduysed these cores / he
said to the king. Sir command straytely that no man aproche nere us with any
torches or fire / for if the fire fasten in any of these cotes / we shall all
be brent without remedy. the king answered and said / yuan ye speak well and
wisely / it shall be done as ye have devised / and incontinent sent for an
vssher of his chamber / co^maundyng him to go in to the chamber where the
ladies dau^sed / and to command all the varlettes holdinge torches to stand
up by the walls / and none of them to aproche nere to the wovehouses that
should come thither to dance. The vssher did the kings commandment / which
was fulfilled. Sone after the duke of Orlyance entered in to the hall /
acompanyed with four knights and six torches and knew nothing of the kings
commandment for the torches / nor of the mummery that was coming thither /
but thought to be hold the daunsynge / and began him self to dance. Therewith
the king with the five other came in / they were so dysguysed in flax that no
man knew them. Five of them were fastened one to another. The king was lose
and went before and led the deuyse.

When they entered in to the hall every man teke so great head to them / that
they forgate the torches. The king departed fro his company and went to the
ladies to sport with them / as youth required / and so passed by the queen and
came to the duchess of Berrey / who took and held him by the arm to know
what he was / but the king would not show his name. Than the duches said / ye
shall not escape me till I know your name. In this mean season great
myschyefe fell on the other / and by reason of the duke of Orlyance / how be
it / it was by ignorance / and against his will / for if he had consydred
before the mischefe that ^ell / he would not have done as he did for all the
good in the world / but he was so desirous to know what personages the five
were that daunced / he put one of the torches that his servants held so nere
/ that the heat of the fire entered in to the flax (wherein if fire take /
there is no remedy) and suddenly was on a bright flame / and so each of them
set fire on other / the pytche was so fastened to the lynen clothe and their
shyrtes so dry and fine / and so ioynynge to their flesh that they began to
brenne and to cry for help. None durst come nere them / they that did burnt
their hands / by reason of the heat of the pytche. One of them called
Nanthorillet / aduysed him how the botry was thereby / he fled thither / and
cast himself in to a vessel full of water / wherein they rynsed pottes /
which saved him / or else he had been deed as the other were / yet he was sore
hurt with the fire. when the queen herd the cry that they made / she douted
her of the King / for she knew well that he should be one of the six /
wherewith she fell in a sown / and knights and ladies came and comforted her.
a pyteous noise there was in the hall. The duchess of Berrey delivered the
king fro that parell / for she did cast over him the train of her gown /
and covered him fro the fire. The king would have gone fro her. Whyder will ye
go quod she / ye se well how your company brennes? What are ye? I am the king
quod he. Haste you quod she and get you in to other apparel / that the queen
may se you / for she is in great fear of you. Therewith the king departed out
of the hall / and in all haste changed his apparel / and came to the queen.
And the duchess of Berrey had somewhat comforted her / and had showed her how
she should se the king shortly. Therewith the king came to the queen / and as
soon as she saw him / for joy she enbrased him and fell in a sown. Than she
was borne in to her chamber / and the king went with her. And the bastard of
Foiz who was all on a fire / cried ever with a loud voice. save the king /
save the king. Thus was the king saved. It was happy for him that he went fro
his company / for else he had been deed without remedy. This great myscheife fell
thus about mydnyght in the hall of saint Powle in Paris / where there was two
burnt to death in the place / and other two / the bastard of Foiz and the
earl of Iouy borne to their lodgings and dyed within two days after in great
mysery and pain. Thus the feast of this marriage brake up in beuynesse / how
be it there was no remedy. The fault was only in the duke of Orlyaunce / and
yet he thought none yuell when he put down the torche. Than the duke said.
Syrs let every man know there is no man to blame for this cause but all
only my self / I am sorry thereof. If I had thought as much before / it
should not have happened. Than the duke of Orlyaunce went to the king to
excuse him / and the king took his excuse. This case fell in the year of our
lord god a thousand three hundred fourscore and twelve / the tuesday before
the feast of Candelmas / of which fortune great brute spredde abroad in the
realm of France / and in other countries. The dukes of Burgoyne and of Berrey
were not there present at that season / They had taken their leave before of
the king / and were gone to their lodginges.

THe next day these news spredde abroad in the city / and every manne had
merueyle thereof. and some said how God had sent that token for an ensample /
and that it was wisdom for the king to regard it / and to withdraw him
self fro such young ydell wantonness / which he had used ouermoche being a
king. The commons of the city of Paris murmured and said. Behold the great
myshappe and myschiefe that was lykely to have fallen on the king / He might
as well have been brent as other were. What should have fallen than of the
kings uncles and of his brother. They might have been sure none of them should
have escaped the death: yea / and all the knights that might have been found
in Paris? As soon as the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne herd of that
adventure / they were abashed and marueyled greatly. They lepte on their
horses and rode to the king / and comforted and counsayled him / which was
necessary / for he was sore troubled / and the paryll that he was in / was
still in his ymaginacion / he showed his uncles how his aunt of Berrey had
saved him. But he said he was very sorry for the death of the earl of Iouye /
of sir yuan of Foiz / and of sir Charles of Poicters. His uncles reconforted
him and said. Sir / that is lost can not be recovered: ye must forgette
the death of them / and thank god of the fair adventure that is fallen to
your own person. For all the realm of France by this incydent might have been in great danger of lesynge. For ye may think well that these people of
Paris will never be still / for God knows / if the mysfortune had fallen on
you / they would have slain us all. Theriore sir / aparell you in estate
royal and lepe on your horse and ride to our lady in pylgrimage / and we shall
accompany you / and show your self to the people / for they desire soore to
se you. The king said he would so do. Than the kings uncles took aparte the
duke of Orlyau^ce and in curtesse manner somewhat blamed him of his young deed
that he had done. He answered and said / how he thought to have done none
yuell. Than anon (...) ye king and his company lepte on their horses / and
rode through the city to apease the people / and came to our lady Church /
and there herd mass and offered / and thanne returned again to the house of
saint Poule / and little and little this matter was forgotten / and the
obsequyes done for the deed bodies.

Ah earl Gascoyne of Foiz / if this had fortuned in thy life days / thou
should have had great displeasure / and it had been hard to have peased the
/ for thou louedest him entierly. All lords and ladies through the realm of
France / and elsewhere / that herd of this chance had great marueyle thereof.

How pope Bonyface and the cardynals of Rome / sent a friar a wise clerk to
the french king. Cap. C.xc.iii.
POpe Bonyface being at Rome with his cardinali es reioysed of this said
adventure / because the French king was against the^ The pope said it was a
token sent fro God to the realm of France / because they supported the pope
at Auygnon / who was proud and presumptuous / and never had done good in all
his life / but disceyued the world. The pope at Rhome and his cardynalles were
in counsel / and concluded to send to the french king secretly a man of
prudence / a friar mynor a great clerk / and he wisely to preche and to
counsel the king to follow ye way of reason / for they said the king took a
wrong way / seeing he was named to be the chief king of Christendom / by
whom holy church ought to be illumyned and aided. Wherefore they charged this
friar to go in to France / and delivered him instructions of the effect that
he should say and do. This was done but it was by leysar / for the Friar had
far to go / and also knew not whether he should have audyence when that he
cam^ thither or not. Now let him go on his journey / and we shall somewhat
speak of the business of France.

NAtwithstandyng / for all these adue^tures / the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne
and their counsayls / left not to pursue to have distroyed ye lord de la
River and sir Johan le Mercier / who were in prisone in the castle of saint
Anthony / in the keeping of the vycount of Archy. And it was said / that they
should be put to death / and delivered to the provost of the Chattelet. And it
was ordained / that as soon as they should come in to his hands / that they
should be beheded openly as traitors against ye crown of France: and so they
had been / if God had not provided for them. And at the special instaunce and
request of the duchess of Berrey: for and she had not ben / their death had
been hasted. specially she prayed for the lord de la River / for by his means
she was brought in to France / and the marriage made between the duke of Berrey
and her. She said on a time to the duke her husband all weeping. Sir / that is
laid to the lords de la River is but a false selaundre / and done for envy.
And sir / Remember what pain and traueyle he took to bring us toguyder / ye
reward him but smally to consent to his death Though all his lands and
goods be taken fro him / yet let him have his life. For and he dye in this
opyn shame / I shall never have joy in my heart. Sir / I say not this of
feigned courage / but that I say is with all my hole heart / wherefore sir / I
require you provide for his delyueraunce. When the duke herd his wife speak so
effectuously / and also knew well that she said but truth. Than he had
pytie and swaged his displeasure / and the lord de la River had been the sons
delivered and sir Johan Mercier had not been / for they sought all the ways
that might be / to have put him to death / which they could not do / without
both should have dyed.

THis sir Johan Mercyer had wept so much in prison / that his sight was
thereby sore febled. It they had followed the duchess of Burgoyns counsel /
they had been put to execucyon long before shamefully / without favor. For
she hared them / because they and sir Olyuer of Clysson had counsayled the
king to go in to Bretaygne to war against her cosyn the duke. Also she said
/ that Clysson / le River / and Mercyer / were causers of the kings maladye /
how be it the king was well recovered and in good estate. The dukes of Berrey
and Burgoyne kept still the governance of the realm of France / for they
had great profit thereby. They had appointed such persons as them pleased to
be about the king.

In those days the king bare the name of a king / but as touching the
business parteynynge to the crown of France / he was but little obeyed / for
the dukes would se and know how every thing paste. The duchess of Burgoyne
was next person to the Queen / where with the Duchess of Orlyaunce was
nothing pleased / for she would have had the honor and preemynence. And
she said to such as were secret with her. What / the duchess of Burgoyne
ought in no condycion to go before me / nor is not so nyghe to the crown (as I
am). My lord my husband is brother to the king / and it might so fall / that
he should be king and I queen: I wotte not why she should take on her this
honor / and put me behind? Thus some envy was among these ladies.

Now let us leave speaking of them / and return to sir Olyuer of Clysson.

YE have herd how he was sommoned fyftene days to apere in the parlyament
chamber / and how certain knights were sent in to Bretaygne to seek for him
/ as sir Philyppe of Sauoises and other / who went in to Bretaygne and
sertched for him in all places / but they found him not / for he hid him
self so covertly / that they could never speak with him / for if they had /
they would have rested him. At their return in to France / they made
relacyon of their voyage. Than it was judged by the lords of the parlyament /
that sir Olyuer of Clysson Constable of France / had forfayted lands / life
/ and goods: And so iuged him to be banysshed for ever out of the realm of
France / and to lose all his offices and herytages within the realm. And
because he had not sent the Martell / which is the token of the office of the
Constablery / as he was so^moned to do: therefore the office was vacant and
void. Than the dukes and their counsayls / such as were against sir Olyuer of
Clysson / thought it necessary to provide so^e person to occupy the said office
/ which was so noble and of so great renome / that it might not long be without
a governor / for the incidentes that might hap to fall. They aduysed that
the lord Coucy was a mete man for it / and laid it to him / but he excused
him self and said / that in no wise he would medyll therewith / he would rather
forsake the realm of France. When they saw he would not medyll therewith /
than the dukes took other advise.

How the marriage was treated / of the lord Philyp of Arthoys Earl of Ewe /
and the lady Mary of Berrey wydowe / daughter to the duke of Berey / and how
he was admytted Constable of France. Cap. C.xc.iiii.
IN this same seasone there was a treaty of marriage to be had between the
lord Philyppe of Arthoys and the young wydowe lady of Berrey / sometime called
countess of Dunoys and wife to Loyes of Bloys. The French king would gladly
have had this marriage auaunsed / but the duke of Berrey was natre willing
thereto / for he thought the erldome of Ewe but a small thing / as to the
regard of her first husband / wherefore he thought to mary her more highlyer.
In deed the lady was beautiful and endued with all virtues / yt should
aperteyne to a noble lady. How be it finally / the duke of Berrey was loathe to
displease the king / yet he had many offers made him for his daughter / as by
the young duke of Loreyne / by the earl of Armynake / and by the son and
heir of the Earl of Foiz. The king brake of all these maryages / and said to
his uncle. Fair uncle of Berrey / we will not that ye shall put our cosyn
your daughter come of the Flower delyce / in to so far countries / we shall
provide for her a marriage mete / for we would gladly have her nere us / it is
right mete that she be with our aunt your wife / for they be much of one age
When the duke saw the kings entente / he re^rayned him self of making of
any promise / to any person for his daughter. Also he saw well that the king
enclyned his favor to his cosyn the lord Philyppe of Arthois / who was a
young lusty knight and of high courage / and had endured many traueyls in
arms / beyond the sea and other places / and had atchyued many voyages to his
great laud and honor. Than the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne agreed between
the^ / that if the king would give to their cosyn Philyppe of Arthois / the
office of Constablery of France / which as than they reputed void / by
reason of the forfayture of sir Olyuer of Clysson / than they to agree at the
kings pleasure in this said marriage. For the duke of Berrey thought / that if
he were constable of France / he should than have suffycient to mentayne his
estate. On this the two dukes determined to speak to the king and so they did
/ and said to him. Sir / your counsel generally are all agreed / that the
lord Philyp of Arthoys be preferred to the office of constableshyp of France
/ which is now void. For by judgment of your perlyament / Olyuer of Clysson
has forfayted ye office / which may not be long vacant / but it should be
preiudyce to the realm. And sir / both you and we also are bound to auau^ce
and promote our cosyn of Arthoys / for he is nere of blood and of lynage to us.
And sir / seeing the office is void / we can not tell where ye should better
enploy it / than on him. He shall right well exercise it: he is well-beloved with
knights and squiers: and he is a man without envy or couytousnesse. These
words pleased well the king / who answered and said. Uncle (if it void) we
had rather he had it than another. The kings uncles sued still for the lord
Philyppe of Arthoys / for the duke of Berrey hated sir Olyuer of Clisson /
because he consented to distroye Betysache his servant. And the duke of
Burgoyne hated him / because he made war against the duke of Bretaygne / and
yet the duchess hated him worse. Finally the king assented / so that the duke
of Berrey would agree to the marriage / between his daughter and the said lord
Philyppe of Arthoys. And yet to satisfye the king and the duke of Orlyau^ce /
who bare sir Olyuer of Clysson in that office. They sent sir Guyllyam of
Bourdes and sir Guyllyam Martell / both knights of the kings chamber. And
sir Philyppe of Sauoises a knight of the duke of Berreys in to Bretaygne / to
speak with sir Olyuer of Clysson. These knights took their journey and rode
to Angers / and there they found the queen of Jerusalem and Johan of Bretaygne
/ who received them right honorably for the honor of the French king. There
they tarried two days / and demanded news of sir Olyuer of Clysson. Saying
they had curtesse letters and message fro the French king to him / and fro
none other person And they were answered no man could tell where he was / but
that he was surely in Bretayne / in one of his fortresses. But they said he was
so flyttyng fro one place to another / that it was hard to find him. Than
these knights departed and took leave of ye queen and of her son Charles the
prince of Thatent / and of Johan of Bretaygne earl of Po^thieu / and rode to
Rennes. And the duke of Bretayne and the duchess were at Wannes and rode not
lightly forth out of the town / for he ever douted the busshmentes of his
enemy sir Olyuer of Clysson. There was so hard war made between them /
that there was no mercy but death. And though the duke was lord and sovereign
of the country / yet there was neither barone / knight / nor squire in
Bretaygne / that would arm them against sir Olyuer of Clysson / but dissymuled
and said / that their war touched them nothing / wherefore they satte still.
The duke could have none other conforte.

WHan^e these French knights were at Rennes: they enquered where to find sir
Olyuer of Clysson / but they could here no certentie of him. Thanne they were
cou^sayled to draw to the castle of Ioselyn / where sir Olyuer of Clyssons
men received them well / for the love of the French king. Than they demanded
where they might here of sir Olyuer of Clysson / Saying they had to speak with
him / fro the french king and from the duke of Orlyaunce / and from none
other persons. But his men could tell nothing of him / or else they would not
tell. But they said. sirs / surely it will be hard to find him / for this
day he is in one place / and to morrow in another. But if it please you / ye
may ride over all the duchy of Bretaygne / and sertche over all his
forteresses and houses / none shall be closed against you. When they saw they
could have none other answer they departed thens / and rode and visyted all
the fortresses great and small / parteynynge to the lord Olyuer of Clysson.
Than^e they came to Wannes / and there found the duke of Bretaygne and the
duchess / who received them / and there they tarried but half a day / and
dyscouered not to the duke / the secret matter that they came thither for / nor
also the duke examyned them nothing of the matter. Also they could not se
there sir Peter of Craon.

THus they took leave of the duke and of the duchess and returned to Paris /
where they found the king and the lords / and there reported to the king and
to the duke of Orlyaunce / how they had sought all the places and towns
parteynynge to sir Olyuer of Clysson / but in no wise they could find him.
The dukes of Burgoyn and Berrey were right glad of these news / and would
not it had been otherwise. Than anon after proceeded the marriage between the
lord Philippe of Arthois and the lady Mary of Berrey. and so this lord
Philyppe was Constable of France / and used the office / with all profytes and
aduauntages thereto belongyng / of ancient ordynau^ces. yet the lord Olyuer of
Clysson had not renounced the office / nor delivered up the Martell / which is
the token of the Constable of France. For he continued / and said he would
abide still Constable / and had done no cause why to lose it / nouther to the
king nor to the realm. He knew well the earl of Ewe was proffered to have the
office of the Constable / and to enjoy the profyttes thereof / by consent of
the King / and how he had married the daughter of the Duke of Berrey the
lady Mary. He took but little regard to all this / for he knew him self true
to the king / and to the crown of France. And knew well / all that was done
against him was through envy and hatered / that the dukes of Burg^yne and Berey
had against him. Thus the lord of Clysson let the matter pass / and
continued still his war against ye duke of Bretayne / which war was right
fierce and cruel / without mercy or pytie. The lord of Clysson rode ofter
abroad and laid busshmentes / than the duke did. And all other lords of
Bretayne satte still and would not medyll. The duke did send for the lords
of his country / and they came to speak with him / and to know his intent.
than the duke required them of their aid and help against his ennemy sir
Olyuer of Clysson. Than the lords of Bretayne / as the vicou^t of Rohan / the
lord Dignan / the lord Hermen of Lion / and diverse other excused them and
said. they knew no cause why / nor they would not make no war against the
lord Clysson / but they said they would right gladlye endenour them selfs to
bring them to a peace / if they could. When the duke saw he could have none
other conforte of them / and parceyued well how he lost and was lykely to lose
mo men in that war than sir Olyuer of Clysson / than he consented that the
said lords should go to sir Olyuer of Clysson and treat for a peace / and to
bring him under saueconducte to Wannes to speak with him / at which time he
said he should be found tretable / and to agree to all reason. And if sir
Olyuer had done him any displeasure / that he might have amends according to
their advise. These lords were well agreed thus to do / and so they all three
went to the lord Olyuer of Clysson / and did so much that they spoke with
him (as I was informed) in the castle of Io^elyn / and showed him the dukes
intent. And moreover to bring them to a peace (for they saw well warr^ was
not fytting between them / but greatly noyed the noble men / merchants / and
commons of Bretaygne) they said to the lord Olyuer. Sir / if it will please
you to go to ye duke / we shall bind us to abide here i^ this castle till
your return. And we doubt not / ye being ones in his presence / ye shall
find him so reasonable / that peace and good accord shall be had bitwene you.
Sir Olyuer said. Sirs what shall it profit you if I were deed? Think you that
I know not the duke of Bretayne? He is so cruel and so haute / that for all
his saueconducte / or what soever he says / if he saw me in his presence /
he would never cease till I were deed: and than^e should you dye likewise / for
my men here would soon slay you without mercy. Wherefore it is best that both
you and I save our lives / rather than to put us in that danger. I shall
keep me fro him and I can / and let him keep him as well fro me. Than^e the
lord Charles of Dignan said. Fair cosyn / ye may say as it please you / but
we think surely though he saw you / he would do you no displeasure This that
we offer you is of good affection / and to bring you to accord / and we pray
you that ye will thus do. Than ye lord Clysson said. Sirs / I believe surely
ye mean well / but I ensure you upon this assurance I shall never go to him.
But sith ye medell in the matter between us / we shall not think that I shall be
unreasonable. I shall tell you what I will do. Return you again to the duke /
and say that I will not take you for no pledge nor hostage. Let him send me
his son and heir / who is married to the daughter of France / and he shall
abide here in this castle with my men / till I return again. This way I
think more surer tha^ the other / for if ye should abide here (as ye offer)
Who should than^e entremedell in the business between ye duke and me? For
without a mean we shall never come to accord.

When these lords of Bretayne saw they could have non other answer they
took their leaves and returned to Wa^nes to the duke / and showed him what
they had done / but in no wise the duke would consent to send his son to
the castle of Ioselyn. So their war continued still / whereby no person
durst ride abroad / and marchaundyse was laid down / thoroughe which the
people of good towns and cities were sore hindered / and poor laborers let
laboringe of the earth. The duchess of Burgoyn covertly aided her cosyn the
duke of Bretayne with men of arms / as well of Burgoyne as of other places. for
the duke could get none of his country to take his part in that quarrel
against sir Olyuer of Clysson. They always dissymuled the matter except such
as were of his own house. The duke of Orlyaunce on the other part / loved
well the lord Olyuer of Clyison / and secretly so coured him with men / and
sent him horses. Sir Olyuer of Glysson roode ofter abroad than the duke did.
And it fortuned on a day he encountered two squyers of the dukes / the one
called Ber^ard and the other yuonet. they were taken and brought to sir Olyuer
/ who was glad of them: He knew them well / one of them had done him
service in time past / and the other not / but he had done him displeasure.
Than sir Olyuer said to yuonet Remembrest thou not how in the Castle of
Ermyne thou sheweddest me but small curtesy: and thou Bernarde had pity on
me and dyddest put of thy gown and put it on me / wha^ I stood in my
doublet on ye pauement / the which kept me fro cold. I will now yield thy
curtesy to the / thy life shall be saved. but thou false knave and traitor yuo
net / thou myghtest have done otherwise tha^ thou dyddest / therefore thou
shalt repent it / and therewith drew his dagger and struck him to the heart.
Another time ye lord Clisson rode with three hundred spears in his company /
toward the castle of Alroy / where the duke and duchess of Bretayne were.
This was about Mydsomer / and by fortune he encountered a forty of the Dukes
servants / who had tied their horses to the trees / and had sickels in
their hands / and were cuttyng down the corn / and making trusses to carry
to their lodgings like forragers. When the lord Olyuer came on them / they
were sore afraid / and the lord Oliver said Sirs / how dare ye come in to
the feldes / to steal and to take away poor me^nes corn? ye never sowed
them / and yet ye cut them down or they be type: ye begin harvest to soon.
Leap on your horses and take your sickels / for this time I will do you no
hurt / and say to the duke of Breraygne who is in Alroy / that if he will come
or send his men to drive me away / here he shall find me till the son
going down. These poor men were glad they were so delivered / they feared
to have been slain. So they returned to the castle of Alroy to ye ^^ke / and
showed him what they had herd and seen / but the duke nor none of his men
issued out of ye castle. Many scrimysshes were made in Bretaygne / between the
duke and sir Olyuer of Clysson / and they of the country meddled not between
them. Now we will leave to speak of the duke of Bretayne and of sir Oliver of
Clysson / and of their war / and speak of the business between England and
France.

Of the form of the peace made bitwene the French king and the king of
England / by means of the four dukes uncles to both kings. Cap. C.xcv.
YE have herd here before / how the perliame^t was holden in the city of
Amyence / and how the English lords departed / and upon what artycles. and
how the French king sent after in to England to the duke of Lancaster / and
the answer that they had of the Englysshmen / who were hard to be brought
to any peace. For it lay not all only in the king nor in the dukes of
Lancastre and york / for great part lay in the commens of England and
archers / and other seruyng men. they said how they had rather have war than
peace / and many young knights and squiers were of yt same opynion / for by
reason of the war they had maynteyned their estates / how be it perforce
they were feign to obey as the king and his uncles would The duke of Lancaster
because his.ii. daughters were queen's / the one of Spaygne / the of Portugale.
And also because he saw the king his nephue enclyned to have peace / he said
the war had endured long enough / and said he would take pain therein / so
it might be for the honor of the king and the realm. On the other party the
duke of Burgoyne did all yt he might do to have peace / consydring how he was
greatly charged with the business of France. And that his two nephues / the
French king and the duke of Orlyaunce were young of age and of discrecion.
Also he consydred how he was enherytour to the duchy of Brabant / and thought
/ that if ever Flaunders and Brabant should vary against the crown of France
with the aid of England / as they had other times done before / that the
realm of France should than have over much to do. the duke of Burgoyne was a
wise and a far castyng prince / and depely regarded his busynesses. This duke
of Burgoyne and the duke of Lancastre / took great pain to have a Parlyament
again to be holden at Balynghm^ / which was agreed / and both parties
suffycyently provided / with full auctorites to conclude a full peace. And this
counsel to be holden at Balyngham / in the month of May than next after /
in the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred fourscore and.xvii. and
all such as should be at this assemble were named and appointed.

First on the party of king Richard king of England were appointed his two
uncles / the duke of Lancastre and ye duke of Gloucestre / who were greatly in
favor with all the commons of England / and with all such yt loved berter to
have war than peace. and with them should be the archebysshop of york / the
bishop of London / and other clerks of the law. It was appointed that these
lords should come to Calays / as they did) about the mids of April / anon
after the feast of saint George / holden at the castle of Wyndesore / by the
king and other knights of the order of the garter. And on the french party
there was aisygned the dukes of Bertey and Burgoyne to be there / and other
counsaylours of France / and it was ordained that they should come to the
town of Boloyn / and the french king / who (as he showed had great affection
to have peace between England and him) said to his uncles / that he would
come as nere to the parlyament as he might / where upon it was aduysed where the
french king should lie / the parlyament during at Balyngham. Somesayd at
saint Omers / and some said at Thourayne / and some at Mutterell or Abuyle. But
all things consydred / it was aduysed that the king should lie at Abuyle /
because the town was strong and well fournysshed / and there every man should
be well lodged. When this was determined drousyon was made there for the king
/ and he to be lodged in the abbay of saint Peter's / an abbay of black monks
/ and thither came the king and the duke of Orlyaunce / and their counsel /
and the lord Reynolde of Corby / chancellor of France. The dukes of Berrey
and of Burgoyne / and such other as were in their co^myssion / were at
Boloyne. And the dukes of Lancastre and Gloucestre and other / were at Calays.
It was goodly to behold to se the order of this parlyament that was holden at
Balyngham / between the french men and englysshmen. There were tents and
pauylyons pyght up / to refresshe both parties / and twyse or thryse a weke
the co^myssioners met there in a fair tente / ordained for that purpose /
about nine of the clock in the fore noone / and there co^muned upon many
artycles. It which time I Johan Froysart (auctour of this book) was at Abuyle
/ and desirous to know the effect of this treaty / I inquired the troth of
such lords and other as I thought should know the certayntie. Is it was
showed me / when they entered in to comunycasion / and had seen each others
auctoryte / and perceived that they had full power to conclude a peace / both
by land and see / between France and England / and all their alyes. Than one
of the first demaundes yt the french men desired / was to have Calays raced
down / in such manner that there should be never after any habytacion there.
Thereto the dukes of Lancaster and Gloucestre answered and said / how they had
no such auctorite to cause Calays to be beaten down / but yt England should
hold it in his demayne and true heritage. And said / that if they purposed to
enter any further in tr^atye of peace / to seace of that demand / and to
speak no more thereof. When the Dukes (...) Berrey and Burgoyne herd their two
cosyns of England answer so quyckly in that (...) / they seized to speak any
more of that mat^er / for they saw well their traueyle should be but in vain
/ and so than spoke of other matters. Than the english men demanded to have
re^^ytucyon of all such lands as had been delivered to king Richard their
soueraygne lord / or to king Edward the third / or to any of their deputies
or commyssioners / and also to have fully paid the so^me of florayns that was
left unpaid at the time when the war renewed between England and France /
and this the english clerks and lawyers proved reasonable and lawful to be
had. The lords and chauncelours of France argued to the contrary / and said /
as to return all the lands again to the gouernynge of the king of England
and his successors / was impossyble to be done / saying how such lands /
cities / towns / castles / lordeshyppes / and homages as the English men
demanded / were given away when the peace was concluded at Bretygny / and
after confermed and sealed at Calays / whereby they were clean put a way fro the
king of England / which peace and grauntes was made in the year of our lord
god a thousand three hundred threscore and one / and thereupon the french king
granted to such lands great lyberties / by his oath / writing / and promise
/ which in no wise can be broken again nor revoked / wherefore they said
that if the Englysshemen purposed to have peace / they should draw to some
nerer point. Than by delyberacyon of the four dukes / it was devised that the
french men as well as the englysshmen should put all their demaundes in
writynge / and the same to be delivered to either party / that they might be
regarded at length on both parts / and such as were unreasonable to be rased
and cancelled / and such as were good to be vpholden. this ordinance seemed to
all parties good and reasonable. Before this order was taken ye sour dukes had
to much business to do specially the english men had much pain to here
and to understand the french men / who were full of subtyle words / and
cloked perswacions and double of understanding / the which the french men
would rouine as they list / to their profit and advantage which english
men use not in their langage / for their speech and intent is plain. And also
the englisshmen were enfourmed that the French men had not always vpholden
the artycles / promyses / and condycyons / ratyfied in the artycles of peace /
yet the frenchmen would ever find one point or other in their writings / by
some subtyle cloked word / affermynge that the english men had broken the
peace / and not they. Wherefore when the english men saw or herd in the
french men's writings any dark or cloked word / they made it to be examyned
by such as were profoundly learned in the law / and if they found it a mysse
/ they caused it to be canselled and amended / to the intent they would leave
nothing in trouble. And the englysshmen to excuse themself / would say that
french men letnynge such subtylties in their youth / must needs be more
subtyle than they. Sometime such froward words between the parties greatly
drove of the time of treaty. The french men held them self fre / and
thought they should not be charged with no such demaundes / as to make
restytucy on of all the lands / with the apendances pertaynyng to the duchy of
Acquytayne / with the arerages of that has been leuyed sith the war renewed /
to ye which they would never acorde. The french men offered to render the
country of Terbe and of Bygore / and the countye of Piergourt and Pyergyns /
and the county of Again and Agenoys. but Kaours / Rouer gue / Ouercy / and
Lymosyn / they would in no wise deliver / nor the county of Ponthyeur / nor of
the cou^tie of Guysnes / more than the englyssh men had in their hands at
the same time. Thus these lords continued a fyftene days and made no
conclusyon / but these dukes determined to send word to the two kings / to
give them knowledge what they had done. The french dukes rode to Abbeuyle and
showed the king all the matter / and how they had desired their cosins of
England to write the hole treaty to the king of England / and so they said
they had promised to do. And as I was enfourmed / on the english party the
duke of Glocestre was harder to entreat than the duke of Lancastre / and
because the commons of England knew somewhat of his intent therefore they
agreed that he should be sent to this treatye / for they knew well that
nothing should pass him without it were for the honor of the realm. Thus
these four dukes amyably departed each fro other / and concluded to mete there
again the nynth day after. Thus these english lords returned to Calays /
and the french lords to Boloyne / and so to Abuyle. That time in Abuyle there
was a fair garden / closed with the river of Sum / whereas often times the
french king passed the time. He said to his brother of Orlyaunce and to his
counsel / that his being at Abbeuyle did him much good in his health. There
was there the same seasone with the king / the king Lion of Armony / newly
come thither out of Greece / and out of those marches / in to his own country
he durst not enter / for the turks had conquered it^ except the strong town
of Conych / standing on the sea side / which the geno ways held and kept
for doubt of the turks / for if the turks had gotten that port / they should
have done much yuell by the sea to the cyprians and to the Rodes / and other
bounds of crystendome. The king of Armony would gladly have had peace
between England and France / in trust that all young knights and squyers
should go in to Greece to help to conquer again his realm of Armony. When
the french kings uncles were come to Abbeuyle / the king was glad and made
them good chere / and demanded how they had spedde / and they showed him all
the hole process / and upon what point they departed / whereof the king was
glad / for he showed to be glad to have peace. In like manner the englyssh
dukes when they came to Calays they wrote to the king of England all the
points and artycles of that treatye. And shortly they had again a good
answer / co^maundynge them to proceed for a peace / saying the war had
contynewed long enough / and that crystendome thereby was sore do^maged. Thus
at the day prefyxed / these dukes met again at Balyngham / and with the
french lords came the king of Armony / to show to the lords of England
his business and necessyte. He was well known with the duke of Gloucestre /
for he had been in England when the french army was ordained at Sluse / to
have gone in to England. The duke of Glocestre the same time received the
king of Armony and made him good chere / at a fair place of his in Esser /
called Plasshey. At Balyngham also the Dukes of England made the king of
Armony good chere / and was glad to here him speak. And they answered him that
gladly they would aid him / whereof the king was right joyful. Many things
were treated in this parlyament. And all this season the cardynall of Line lay
at Abbeuyle / who was sent thither in legacyon / by him that called him self
pope Clemente / for matters concerning the church. The french dukes at this
assemble at Balyngham / would have had certain artycles comprised in their
treaty / concerning the church / and susteynynge the opynyons of this pope
Clemente / Robert of Geneue. But when the English dukes hard that / they
said to their cosyns of France. Cosyns / and ye will that we shall fall to any
point of conclusion / speak no more of that cardynall / we have nothing to do
with him / his matter is a busynes without profit or effect / we are
determined upon a pope to whom we will obey / we will here no spekyng against
him / if the other meddle any thing with us we shall depart and god hence /
and leave all togytder. After that time there was no mo words of that
cardynall / he tarried still at Abbcuyle. Than these lords proceeded in their
treaties / the duke of Lancastre was well enclyned to have peace. The French
king the year before had sore desired him to be a good mean to entreat for
a peace / and so he promised to do. howbeit his brother the duke of Gloucestre
was hard to agree / for he laid forth the frenchemens dysceytes and colored
words that they used always in their writings / saying how the french men
would always wrestell with their arms dyscouered / which was ever perceived.
On a day there came a squire of honor a french man / called Robert the
hermyte to ye duke of Gloucestre / he was one of the french kings privy
chamber / whether he was sent to the duke of Glocestre or came on his own
heed / I can not tell / but as the duke showed me in England at Plasshey /
this squire said to him. Sir for the love of god be not against this treaty of
peace / for ye se how the lords of France do their dyligence to bring it
about / ye shall do an alms deed / for the war has to long endured /
and sithe that both kings are content to have peace / all their subgiettes
ought to obey thereto. Than the duke answered him as he said. Roberte I am not
against it / nor will not be / but ye french men among you / ye have so many
colored words / so dark and obscure to our understanding / so that when ye
will it is war / and when ye list it is peace / thus have ye led us unto
this present day. But if the king my soueraygne lord had believed me / and
such other of his realm as are bound to serve him / peace should never have
been between England and France / till restytucyon had been made to us of all
that is taken fro us without cause / by subtylte and craft / as god and all
the world knows. But sithe the king my sovereign lord enclyneth to the
peace / it is reasone that we agree to the same. and therefore if we make a
peace acordyng to the desires of both kings / sithe we be here assembled /
let it be well holden on your side / for it shall be well kept on our party.
And thus the duke showed me that this Roberte the Hermyte departed fro him /
and went to his company. And so these lords contynewed still their treaty.

I Will make no further process / but come to conclusyon. These four dukes
that were at this assemble / and had full power and auctorite of their kings
to take a tre^^ce / and to make a peace. They did so in such wise / that
general voice and (...) through the town of Abbeuyle that a peace was taken
upon certain artycles between the two kings / their alyes and consyderates.
But I sir Johan Froyssart auctour of this hystory / being the same time in
Abbe^^yle / could not learn the certaynte of the artycles comprised in that
peace. How be it I knew that a peace was taken to endure four years / to be
kept ferme and stable / both by see and by land. And it was concluded and
agreed that within the said space of the four year / should be delivered to
the king of England for ever / and perpetually to all kings of England and
to his co^myssioners / all the lands and sygnories in the country of
Languedo^ / and to be as of the demayne and heritage of the crown of England.
And this done and accomplysshed / it was agreed by the same ordinance that
certain capitayns and their men that held some holds and fortresses in the
Realm of France / should aduoyde and depart all such as made war / and do
make any war / under the shadow and color of the king of England and the
English men / of what nacyon so ever they were. To all these artycles these
lords that were as than at Balyngham were bound in writings sygned and
sealed / and the copyes thereof sent to both kings. Than the dukes of
Lancastre and Gloucestre / sent an harauld called March / with letters to the
King of England / showing and declarynge all the hole process and
ordinance concluded in their treaty / upon the form of peace. Thus this
haraulde departed with his letters / and rode to Calys / and passed over to
Deuer / and rode forth till he came to the king / who was at a manoure of his
own beside London. When he came in the kings presence he delivered his
letters. And when the King had read them / he was right ioyouse / and gave to
the haraulde for his good tidings bringing great gifts / as the same
haraulde showed me after at leysare / as I rode with him in to the Realm of
England. These four dukes of France and of England / were still at
Balyngham / and soiourned there in fair tents and pauylyons / and well and
dylygently perused and examyned the artycles of their treaty / and would pass
nor seal to none till all dark and obscure words were clearly declared and
made perfyte. Now in the same season there happed to fall a great let and
trouble in this matter / whereby all was nyghe at a point to have been broken
and made void / and it is reason I tell you the cause / to the intent that the
hystory be plain and true.

YE have herd here before how the french king had great pleasure to lie at
Abbeuyle / and also to be nere to here daily how ye treaty went forward at
Balyngham. And when the four dukes were at a point (as ye have herd) at the
conclusyon of the matter / the dukes of Lancastre and Gloucestre said / how
that it was the entensyon of king Richard king of England and his counsel
that pope Bonyface being at Rome (whom the Romans / almayns / hungaryons /
lumbardes / venysyans / and all the nacyons of the world / chrystened / held
to one pope / and he that named him self Clement degraded and conde^pned) that
they should desire the french king to take the same way. When the dukes of
Berrey and Burgoyne understood those words / the duke of Burgoyne (to the
intent somewhat to please his cosyns of England / and to the entente that
their treaty of peace should not be hyndred thereby) said. Fair cosyns / we
desire you to have some respyte to take counsel upon that matter / which was
granted them. And thereupon they took counsel / and than answered / and the
Duke of Burgoyne spoke and said. Fair cosyns / the matter and questyon of the
two popes / is not couenable to be moved nor spoken of here among us / and we
marueyle why ye put this matter in co^munycacion / for at the first beginning of
our treaty / ye refused to se or to speak with the Legate de la Line / who is
as yet in Abbeuyle / wherefore we rest us on that. When the cardynalles at Rome
did chose pope Vrbayne / and after his dyscease pope Bonyface / none of our
party nor yet of yours were called to that electyon / and in likewise we say
of Clement / who is at Auygnon. We say not against / but that it were great
alms to a pease them / and to vny the church / who so might entende to do it
/ but let us leave that matter / and let the vnyuersitees and clerks
determyne it. and when all our business is concluded / and a ferme peace
ratifyed / than by the counsel of our cosyn the king of Almayne / we shall
entende thereto gladly on our party / and in likewise do you on your party.
With this answer the dukes of England were well content / for it seemed to
them reasonable. Than they answered and said. Fair cosyns ye have said very
well / we are content with the same. Thus that matter rested. Than there fell a
another great let and trouble / for the french king who had layne at the
town of Abuyle a great season / because of the great disportes / pleasure /
and pastyme that he found there / suddenly he fell again in to his maladye of
fransy / in like manner as he had been the year before. He that first perceived
it was sir Willyam Martell / a knight of Normandy / who was always nere to the
kings person in his privy chamber. The same seasone the dukes of Berrey and
Burgoyne were at Boloyne / or at Balyngham / upon the end of their parlyament /
and they had in a manerall concluded for that seasone. And as soon as the duke
/ of Orlyau^ce brother to the king / knew of this chance of the kings
sycknesse / and that he had seen him / he sent a secret squire of his named
Bonyface to his uncles to Boloyne / aduertisynge them secretly of the kings
disease. When the dukes knew that / they were right sorye and departed / for
they had all ready taken their leaves of their cosyns of England / who were
also departed to Calays / and tarried there to here tidings fro the king of
Nauerte and fro the duke of Bretaygne / for they had moved in their treaty
that the castle of Chyerbourge / standing on the seesyde / upon the close of
Constantyne in Normandy / which the king of England had in gawge and in
keeping / as I was enfourmed / for the so^me of threscore thousand nobles of
England / that the french king should pay the said sum / and the castle
to return to the King of Nauerre / and also the strong castle of Breast
that the english men held / should return to the duke of Bretaygne. The
dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne abode not the conclusyon of that matter / but came
to Abbeuyle / and found the king in right yuell estate of his health / where
of they were sorry. The kings sycknesse was kept secret as long as it might
be / but it was not very long / for such adventures are soon spredde abroad.
Thus all the lords that had been in Abbeuyle departed one after another every
man home to his own house. Than it was determined that the king should be
carried in an horse lytter to the castle of Crayll upon Oyse / where he had
been before. Thither he was conveyed by night time / and the day time he rested
/ for the heat of the son. The duke of Berrey and the duke of Orlyaunce rode
to Crayell with the king / and the duke of Burgoyne rode in to Arthoys and in
to Flaunders / vysitynge his countries / and found the duchess his wife at
the castle of Hedyn. As than there was no mo words spoken of the lord de la
River nor of sir Johan Mercyer / they were as than all forgoten / no man spoke
of their greuaunce nor of their delyueraunce. This second malady that Charles
the french king was fallen in / did put away greatly the speaking of the
people. The wise and sage men of France feared before greatly this chance /
for they saw the king was lykely to fall in to that malady / by reason of the
great excess that he had used in times paste / and through the feblenesse of
his heed. master Willm^ of Harsley was as than newly deed / and such as were
nere about ye king could not tell where to have a good sure phisicyon to wayt
upon ye king / howbeit they that were about him did ye best they could devise.

Of the death of pope Clement at Auygnon / and of the lectyon of pope Benedic.
Cap. C.xcvi.
IN that time in the month of Septembre / passed out of this world at Auygnon
Roberte of Geneue / named pope Clement / and it came by him as he had always
said before. when any man spoke of the peace and vny^n of the church / he would
say always / how he would dye pope / and so he did / in manner as ye have
herd here before / wrongfully or ryghtfully I will not determyne. Than the
Cardynalles there were sore abashed / and studied whom they might chose to be
pope. The same time the French king returned again to his health / whereof
all such as loved him had great joy / and specially the good queen / who had
given much alms and done many pylgrymages for the king / and caused
general processyons to be made in Paris. As I was enfourmed ye cardynals at
Auygnon did elect and chose to be pope the cardynall de la Line. To speak
truly this cardynall was an holy manne and of good life. This electyon was
made condycionally / that if the french king and his counsel were content
therewith / or else not. Now regard and considre the great subiectyon that the
church was in / In that where the church should be free / they submytted them
to be under such as should have been ordered by them. Thus this cardynall de la
Line was chosen pope / and named Benedic. He gave general graces to all
clerks that would come to Auignon. And by the counsel of his brethren the
cardynalles / he wrote of the creacyon of his papalyte to the French king.
But as I was enfourmed the king took little regard thereto / for as than he
was not determined whether he should take him for very pope or not / and there
upon the king sent for the greatest clerks of the university of Paris / to
have their advise and counsel. Than master Johan of Gyg^neourte and master
Pyer Placyous (who were in prudence and lernyng / the greatest clerks in Paris
said to the king in the name of all the hole university / how that the cysme
of the church corrupted the christian faith / and how that it might not long
endure in that estate / without all crystendome should repent it / and rynne in
great danger / and specially the prelates and priests of the church. They of
the university were determined to send no rolls to Auygnon / for any clerks
to have any graces of this Pope Benedyc. The french king saw well their
opynyons were reasonable / and would have none of his clerks enrolled to seek
for the popes graces / till the matter were better determined. Thus that matter
abode still in that estate. How be it the duke of Berrey exalted greatly this
pope Benedic / and sent his roll / whereby much people were purueyed of graces
of this Benedic. The duke of Burgoyne and the duchess dyssymuled the matter
with the king / and so did the duke of Orlyaunce with many other great lords
of France. and some for favor held them to this pope Benedyc / who denied
no man his graces / to the intent that his court at Auygnon should be full /
and to have the more reputacyon. The duke of Bretaygne followed the french
kings opinyon / for he was before time so abused by the enformacyon of his
cosyn the earl of Flaunders / that his heart would never enclyne to believe on
Pope Clemente / though the clerks of Bretaygne believed and held him for pope.
So when any promocyon was void in France / the king promoted his clerks /
without gyuynge any knowledge thereof to this pope Benedic / wherewith he and his
cardynalles at Auygnon were sore abashed / and douted lest the french king
would restrain such rentes and profytes as they were wont to have of the
benefytes given in the realm of France. Than they determined to send a
legate in to France to speak with the King and his counsel / to know how
he would order him against the church / and to show him how that he that is
chosen pope is under this condycyon / that if he be pleased / than he to abide
still as pope / or else they to put him out of his papalyte / and the cardynals
to enter again in to conclaue / and chose one after the kings pleasure / At
this time was come to Paris and was about the king / the freer mynour a meke
man / who was sent in to France by pope Bonyface of Rome. The french king
herd gladly this freers prechynge. Than came in to France the legate fro
Auygnon / who was a great and a subtyle clerk and well langaged. Than the hole
university counsayled the king / and said how it were well done that either
Bonyface or else Benedyc to be put out of the is papalyte / and all his
cardynalles to be put out of their cardynalyties. And instead of them to be
chosyn good clerks / wyfemen / and of good conscience / as well of Almayne and
France / as of other nacyons. And they to be set toguyder by good
delyberacyon and counsel / without favor or yuell will to set the church
thereby at one point with one pope. They said / they saw well there was none
other way to bring it to a good conclusyon / because pride and envy so
reigned in the world / that the princes and lords each held their own
party. This preposycion that the vnyuersite had made before the king /
pleased right well the king / and the dukes of Orlyaunce and of Surgoyne. And
the king said he would write and send messangers to the king of Almaygne and
of Bo^sme / and of Hungry: and to the king of England. And he thought him
self sure enough of the kings of Castyle / of Nauer / of Aragon / of Cicyle /
of Naples / and of Scotla^de / that they would obey to such a pope as he and
his Realm obeyed unto. And upon this / the french king sent his letters and
messangers to these said kings. There was good leysar in doing of this /
both in going and coming again with answer. and in yt mean time there
passed out of this world at Paris / the noble clerk masters Johan of
Gygencourt / of whose death the king and the lords / and ye hole vniuersyte
were right sorry / for he last not his fellow behind him and he had in his
days taken great pain to reform the church / and to have brought it in to a
perfyte unity.

Of a clerk named master John^ of warennes. Capi. C.xcvii.
THe same season there was a great clerk at Auignone / both of Science and of
prudence / doctor in the laws and auditor of the palais of the casion of
Ra^nes / called master Johan of warennes: And by reason of such service as he
had done to pope Clement and to other / he was greatly auau^ted and promoted
with benefices / and he was at yt point to be a bishop or a cardynall: he had
been chapelayne with one at Auygnone / called saint Peter of Lusenbourge. The
same master Johan Ware^nes for all his promocions he resigned the^ all / and
retained to himself but a small lyueng / and that was the sextenty of our lady
church in Renes / worth by year if he be resydent a.C. frankes / and in
absence but.xxx. and so deperted fro Auignon / and came to dwell nere to Renes
in a village called saint Ley. and there he led an holy life and preched ye
word of god / and exalted much the pope at Auygnon and conde^pned in his
words the pope at Rome. He was visited of much people of all countries that
came to se him / and to se ye holy life that he led. He fasted every day.
Some people said that ye cardynals at Auignon / by craft and subtylte had
sent him thider / to exalte and to color their opinyon / or else he was come
thider to show his holy life. He would in no wise be called the holy man of
saint Ley / but the audytor. He had always in his company his mother: He said
mass every day devoutly / and all that was given him / he would give it
again for god dessake: He would ask nothing of no man. Now let us leave
spekyng of him / and speak of other business / as the matter requires.

How the king of England gave to the duke of Lancastre and to his heirs for
ever the duchy of Acquytayne / and how the king prepared to go in to Irelande
/ and the duke in to Acquytayne. Cap. C.xcviii.
YE have herd here before in this history / how Trewce was taken between
England and France / and there adhere^ces and alyes / both by see and by
land. For all that / yet there were robbers and pyllers in Languedocke /
which were strangers and of far countries: As of Gascoyne / of Bierne / and
of Almaygne. And among other / sir Johan of Grayle bastard (son sometime of
the Captall of Beuses / a young and an expert knight) was captain of the
strong castle of Bouteuyll. These capitayns of the garysons in Bigore and
marchynge on the realm of Arragone / and on the fronters of Xaynton / and in
the marchesse of Rochell / and of the garyson of Mortaygne / were sore
displeased that they might natte over rynne to country / as they were
accustomed to do. For they were straitlye commanded on pain of grievous
punysshment / to do nothing that should sou^de to the reproach of the peace.

IN this season it was agreed in England / considering that the king was
young / and that he had peace with all his enemies / far and nere /
except with Irelande. For he claymed that land of enherytau^ce / and his
predecessors before him / and was written king and lord of Irelande. And
king Edward / graunfather to king Richard / made all ways war with the
Irysshe men. And to the entente that the young knights and squyers of England
should enploye them self in deeds of arms / and thereby to augment and
increase the honor of the realm. It was concluded / that king Richard of
England should make thither a voyage with puyssau^ce of men of war: And so
to enter in to Irelande / and not to return again without they had an
honorable composycion or conclusyon. The same season it was concluded / that
the duke of Lancastre who had greatly traueyled both by See and by land /
for the augmentacyon and honor of the reralme of England / should make
another voyage with five hundred men of arms and a thousand archers / and
to take shyppynge at Hampton or at Plommouthe / and so to sail to Guyane and
to Acquitaygne. And it was the entencyon of king Richard / and by consent of
all his counsel / that the duke of Lancastre should have for ever to him and
to his heirs / all the country of Acquitayne with the purtenaunces / as king
Edward his father had / or any other kings or dukes of Acquitayne / before
time had holden and optayned: And as king Richard at yt time had / reserved
always the homage that he should do to the king of England / and to any
kings to come after. But as for all the obeysau^ces / rentes / lordshypes /
and revenues / should parteygne to the duke of Lancaster and to his heirs for
ever. Of this the king made to him a clear grant / and confyrmed it under his
writing and seal. With this gift the duke of Lancaster was well content and
good cause why. For in that Duchy are lands and countries for a great lord to
maynteygne his estate with all. The Charter of this gift was engrosed and
dewly examyned / and paste by great delyberacyon / and good advise of
counsel. Being present the king and his two uncles / the dukes of york and
the duke of Gloucestre: The earl of Salisbury / the earl of Arundell / the earl
of Derby / son to the duke of Lancastre: And also therle Marshall earl of
Rutlande / the earl of Northu^berlande / the earl of Nottyngham / the lord
Thomas Percy / the lord Spensar / the lord Beamonde / the lord Willyam of
Arundell: The archebysshoppe of Caunterbury and the archebysshoppe of york /
and the bishop of London / and other: all these were present / and diverse
oath Prelates and barownes of England. Thanne the duke of Lancastre purposed
to make his prouisyon to pass the Sea to go in to Acquitayne / to enjoy the
gift that the king had given him. In likewise great prouisyon was made for
the kings voyage in to Irelande / and lords and other were appointed / such
as should pass the Sea with the king / and had warnyng to make the^ ready.

Of the death of Queen Anne of England wife to king Richard daughter to the
king of Boesme and Emperor of Almaygne. Capi. C.xcix.
THus (as I have showed) great preparacyons was made / at the ports and hauyns
/ where as the king should take shyppepynge for to go in to Irelande / And in
likewise there as the duke of Lancastre should pass to go in to Acquitayne /
Their voyage was let / and tarried ye space of two months lengar than it
should have been / and I shall tell you why.

THe same season that all these preparacyons was made / the Queen named Anne
took a sickness / whereby the king and all his lords were right sore
troubled / for she was so sore sick / that she passed out of this world at
the feast of Penthecost: the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred
fourscore and fourtene / of whose death the king and all that loved her /
ladies and damoselles were sore troubled / and in great heaviness. She was
buried at Poules in London / and her obse^es done after at good leysar / for
the king would have it done sumptuously / with great habu^daunce of wax /
tapers / and torches / so that the like had not ben seen before. The king
would have it so / because she was the Emperors daughter of Rome and king of
Almaygne. The king loved her so entierly. They were married young / how be it
she dyed without issue. Thus in one season / the king / the duke of Lancastre
/ and the earl of Derby were wydowers. And there was no speaking of remaryeng /
nor the king would here no speaking thereof. Thus the kings voyage in to
Irelande was somewhat retarded and let / how be it the prouisyon and other
lords / such as should go with the king / passed over the sea and landed at
Duuelyn / which was always English / and there is an archebisshoppe who was
with the king. And anon after Mydsomer the king departed fro the marchesse
of London / and took the way through Wales huntyng and sporting him / to
forgette the death of his queen / and such as should go with the king set
forward. Two of the kings uncles / Edmonde duke of york and Thomas duke of
Gloucestre constable of England / set forward in great arraye / so did
other lords: as the earl of Rutlande / son to the duke of york / the earl
marshall earl of Salisbury / the earl of Arundell / the lord Wyllyam of
Arundell / the earl of Northumberlande lord Percy / lord Thom^s Percy his
brother great Seneschall of England / the earls of Deuonshyre and Notyngham /
and great nombre of other knights and squiers Such reserved / as abode
behind to keep the marchesse against the scotts / who were such people as
never kept no truce nor promise. The lord Johan of Hollande earl of
Huntyngton was as than on his way to Jerusalem and to saint Katheryns mount /
and purposed to return by the realm of Hungry / for as he passed through
France (where he had great chere of the king / and of his brother and
uncles) he herd how the king of Hungry and the great Turk should have
battle together / therefore he thought sure lie to be at that journey. On the
othersyde the duke of Lancastre came to Plomouthe / where his ships lay
ready. And when his men were come and his vessels all charged and had wind at
will / they took shippyng and disancred and sailed toward Bordeaux / on the
river of Gyron.

Now let us speak of the king of England / who had in his copany four
thousand men of arms and thyrtie thousand archers. They shipped at three
places. At Brutowe / at Holyheed / and at Herforde / they passed over daily.
And in Irelande all ready there was a valiant knight of England / called earl
of Ormonde. He held lands in Irelande / and so did his predecessors / but
it was as than in debate. The earl Marshall of England had the vowarde with
fyftene hundred spears and two thousand archers. The king of England and
his two uncles took shyppinge at Herforde in Wales. Thus the army passed over
without do^mage / and than they were lodged in Irelande / by the apoyntement of
the duke of Gloucestre constable of England and by the marshals / all abroad
in the country / beyond ye city of Duuelyn a.xxx. mile / for the country was
as than^e inhabytable: How be it they lay wisely and surely for fear of the
yrisshe men / as need was / or else they might have taken great do^mage. And the
king and his uncles were lodged in the city of Duuelyn: and as it was showed
me all the while they were there / they were largely provided of vitayls: For
the English men are / such men of war as can well forage and take
aduau^tage / and make good prouisyon for the^ self and their horses. And what
fell of this voyage I shall show you here after / as I was informed.

How sir John^ Froissart arrived in England / and of the gift of a book that
he gave to to the king. Cap. CC.
True it was / that I sir Johan Froissart (as at that time treasourer and
chanon of Chymay / in the erldome of Heynaulte in the diocese of Liege) had
great affectyon to go and se the realm of England / when I had been in
Abbeuyle / and saw that trewce was taken between the realms of England and
France / and other countries to them conjoined and there adherentes / to
endure four years by See and by land. Many reasons moved me to make that
voyage. One was / because in my youth I had been brought up in the court of
the noble king Edward the third and of queen Philyppe his wife / and among
their children / and other barons of England / that as than were a live: In
whom I found all nobleness / honor / largess / and courtesy. Here fore I
desired to se the country / thinking thereby I should live much the lengar /
for I had not been there.xxviii. year before / and I thought though I saw
natte those lords that I left a live there / yet at the leest I should se
their heirs the which should do me much good to se / and also to iustifye
the hystories and matters that I had written of them. And or I took my journey
/ I spoke with duke Aubert of Bauyere / and with the Earl of Heynaulte /
Hollande / zelande / and lord of Freese / and with my lord Wyllyam earl of
Ostrenaunt / and with my right honorable lady Iahane duchess of Brabant and
of Lusenbourge / and with the lord Eugerant / lord Coucy / and with the
gentle knight the lord of Gomegynes / who in his youth and mine / had been
toguyder in England in the kings court. In likewise so had I seen there the
lord of Coucy / and diverse other nobles of France / holden great housholdes
in London / when they lay there in hostage for the redemption of king Johan /
as than French king: As it has been showed here before in this history.

THese said lords and the Duchess of Brabant / counsayled me to take this
journey / and gave me letters of recommendacyon to the king of England and to
his uncles / saving the lord Coucy: He would not write to the king because
he was a French man / therefore he durst not / but to his daughter / who as
than was called duchess of Irelande. And I had engrosed in a fair book well
enlumyned / all the matters of Amors and moralytees / that in four and twenty
years before I had made and compyled / which greatly quickened my desire to
go in to England to se king Richard / who was son to the noble prince of
Wales and of Acquitayne / for I had not seen this king Richard / sithe he
was Christened in the Cathedral church of Bordeaux / at which time I was
there / and thought to have goone with the prince the journey in to Galycia in
Spaygne. And whan^e we were in the city of Aste / the prince sent me back in
to England to the Queen his mother.

For these causes and other / I had great desire to go in to England to se
the king and his uncles. Also I had this said fair book well covered with
velvet / garnysshed with clapses of Silver and gylte / thereof to make a present
to the king / at my first cominynge to his presence. I had such desire to
goo this voyage / that the pain and traueyle grieved me nothing. Thus provided
of horses and other necessaries I passed the Sea at Calais and came to Dover /
the.xii. day of the month of July. Whan^e I came there I found no man of my
knowledge / it was so long sithe I had been in England and the houses were
all newly changed / and young children were become men / and ye women knew me
natte nor I them. So I abode half a day and all a night at Dover: It was on
a Tuesdaye / And the next day by nine of the clock I came to Canterbury to
saint Thomas shrine / and to the tomb of the noble prince of Wales / who is
there entered right richely. There I herd mass and made mine offrynge to the
holy saint / and thanne dyned at my lodging: And there I was informed / how
king Richard should be there the next day on pylgrimage / which was after
his return out of Irelande / where he had been the space of nine moneches or
there about. The king had a devotion to visyte saint Thomas shrine / and also
because the prince his father was there buried Than I thought to abide the
king there / and so I did. And the next day the king came thither with a
noble company of lords ladies / and damoselles. And when I was among them they
seemed to me all new folks I knew no person. The time was sore changed
in.xxviii. year. And with the king as than was none of his uncles / the duke
of Lancaster was in Acquitayne / and the dukes of york and Glocestre were in
other busynesses / so that I was at the first all abashed / for if I had seen
any ancient knight that had been with king Edward or with the price / I had been well reconforted and would have gone to him / but I could se none such.
Than^e I demanded for a knight called sir Richard Seury / whyder he were a
live or not / and it was showed me yes / but he was at London. Than I thought
to go to ye lord Thom^s Percy / great seneschall of Englade who was there with
the king. so I acquaynted me with him and I found him right honorable and
gracyous. And he offered to present me and my letters to the king / whereof I
was right joyful / for it behooved me to have some means to bring me to the
presence of such a prince as the King of England was. He went to the kings
Chamber / at which time the king was gone to sleep / and so he showed me /
and badde me return to my lodging and come again / and so I did. And when
I came to the bysshoppes palace / I found the lord Thomas Percy ready to ride
to Ospring. And he counsayled me to make as than no knowledge of my being
there / but to follow the court / and said he would cause me ever to be well
lodged / till the king should be at the fair castle of Ledes in Kent. I
ordered me after his counsel and rode before to Ospring / and by adventure I
was lodged in an house / where was lodged a gentle knight of England called
sir Wyllyam Lysle. He was tarried there behind the king / because he had pain
in his heed all the night before. He was one of the kings preuy chamber. And
when he saw that I was a stranger / and as he thought of the marchesse of
France because of my langage / We fill in acquayncaunce toguyder / for
gentylmen of England are curcesse / treatable / and glad of acquayntaunce.
Than he demanded what I was / and what business I had to do in those parties.
I showed him a great part of my coming thither / and all that the lord
Thomas Percy had said to me / and ordered me to do. He than answered and said
/ how I could not have a better mean / and that on ye Friday ye king should
be at the castle of Ledes. And he showed me that when I came there / I should
find there the duke of york the kings uncle / whereof I was right glad /
because I had letters dyrected to him / and also that in his youth he had
seen me / in the court of the noble king Edward his father and with ye queen
his mother. Than on the Friday in the morning sir Wylliam Lysle and I rode
toguyder / and on the way I demanded of him / if he had been with the king
in the voyage in to Irelande. He answered me yes. Than I demanded of him the
manner of the Hole that is in Irelande / called saint Patrykes purgatory / if
it were true that was said of it or not. Than he said / that of a surety
such a hole there was / and that he him self and another knight of England
had been there while the king lay at Duuelyn / and said / how they entered
in to the hoole and were closed in at the son going down / and abode there
all night / and the next morning issued out again at the son risyng. Than I
demanded it he had any such strange sightes or vysions as was spoken of. Than
he said / how that when he and his fellow were entered and past the gate yt was
called ye purgatory of saint Patryke / and that they were descended and gone
down three or four paces / discendyng down as in to a cellar / a certain
hoote wapure rose against them / and struck so in to their heedes / that they
were feign to sit down on the steres / which are of stone. And after they had
sytte there a season / they had great desire to sleep / and so fell a sleep and
slepte there all night. Than I demanded that if in their sleep they knew
where they were / or what visyons they had: he answered me / that in slepyng
they entered in to great ymaginacyo^s and in marvelous dremes / otherwise /
than they were wont to have in their Chambres: and in the morning they issued
out / and within a short season / clean forgate their dreures and visyons /
wherefore he said / he thought all that matter was but a fantasy. Than I left
spekyng any further of that matter / because I would feign have known of him
what was done in the voyage in Irelande. And I thought as tha^ to have
demanded what the king had done in that journey / but than company of other
knights came and fell in communycacion with him / so that I left my purpose
for that time. Thus we robe to Ledes / and thither came the king and all his
company / and there I found the lord Edmonde duke of york. Than I went to
him and delivered my letters fro the earl of Heynaulte his cosyn / and fro the
earl of Ostrenaunt. The duke knew me well and made me good chere and said.
Sir Johan / hold you always nere to us / and we shall show you love and
courtesy / we are bound thereto for the love of time past and for love of my
lady the old Queen my mother / in whose court ye were: we have good
remembrance thereof. Than I thanked him as reason required. So I was aduaunsed
by reason of him and sir Thomas Percy and sir William Lysle. By their means I
was brought in to the kings chamber / and in to his presence by means of his
uncle the duke of york. Than I delivered my letters to the king / and he took
and reed the^ at good leysar. Than he said to me that I was welcome / as he
that had been and is of the English court. As on that day I showed not the
king the book that I had brought for him / he was so sore occupied with great
affairs / that I had as than no leysar to present my book. The king was sore
busyed there in counsel for two great and mighty matters. First was / in
determining to send sufficient messangers / as therle of Rutlande his cosyn
germayne and the earl Marshall / the archbysshoppe of Dublyn / the bishop of
Ely / the lord Loys Clyssorde / the lord Henry Beaumonde / the lord Hughe
Spensar / and many other / over the Sea to Charles the French king / to
treat with him for a marriage to be had / between the king of England and
the French kings eldest daughter / named Isabell / of the age of eight years.
The second cause was the lord de la Barde / the lord of Taryde / the lord
of Pyntherne / the lord of Newcastell / the lord of Nesque / the lord of
Copane / and the counsaylours of Burdeux / Bayon / and of Daxe were come in to
England / and had quickly pursued their matter / sithe the kings return out
of Irelande / to have an answer / of the requests and process that they had
put forth to the king / on the gift that the king had given to his uncle the
duke of Lancaster / of the lands / seignories / lordshippes / and baronyes in
Acquytayne / which they verifyed to pertaygne to the king and realm of
England. They had alleged to the king and his counsel / that his gift
might not pass so / because it was unprofitable and mutyle. For they said /
all those lands held of right and of the demayne of the crown of England /
Wherefore they said / they would not disioyne nor disceuer the^ fro the crown.
They alleged furthermore / many other reasonable causes: as ye shall here after
in this process. But thus to have co^sayle of those two great matters / the
king had sent for the most part of the prelates and lords of England / to
be at the feast of Maudelyntyde / at a manner of the kings called Eltham / a
seuyn English miles fro London. And when they had tarried at Ledes a four
days / the king returned to Rochester and so to Elthame: and so I rode forth
in the kings company.

Of the refuce of them of Acquytayne made to the duke of Lancastre and how
they sent in to England to the king and his counsel / showing him the will
of the hole country of Acquytayne. Cap. CC.i.
IN riding the way between Leads and Eltham / I demanded of sir Willyam
Lysle and of sir John^ of Graily captain of Bouteuyll / ye cause why the king
drew to London ward / and why that great counsel should assemble at Eltham.
They told me / and specially sir Johan Graily rehearsed to me plainly / why ye
lords of Gascon were come thither / and the counsaylours of the good towns and
cities. thus I was enfourmed by this knight who knew the troth / for he was
often times among them / they and he were in a manner all of one country and
fronter / he said thus. Surely when the Duke of Lancastre came first in to
Acquytayne / suffycyently fournysshed with charters and wrytinges engrosed and
sealed with the great seal of England / and enrolled and fermely decreed with
full accord of all prelates and lords of England / and also by consent of
the duke Edmonde of york and Earl of Cambridge / and of Thomas duke of
Gloucestre / though the said herytages might by succession have come to them /
for King Richard of England their nephue / had as than no children / and
these said two dukes were brethern germayns of father and mother to the duke of
Lancastre / which duke anon after he was come in to Acquytayne / sent some
of his counsel to the city of Bordeaux / to show to the Mayre and
counsaylours of the town / the form and tenoure of his request / and for
what cause he was come in to the country. When they herd this they greatly
marueyled / how be it they joyfully received the kings and dukes
co^myssioners / for the honor of the king / to whom they ought their
service and obeysaunce. Than they desired to take counsel / and so they did.
Than after they answered and said / that the duke of Lancastre son to king
Edward / who had been their lord was welcome among them / and none otherwise.
for they said they had not so far forth taken counsel / as to receive him
to their sovereign lord / for they said that to king Richard their soueraygne
lord they had done feaultie and homage / and as than he had made them no
quyta^ce. Than answered the co^myssioners and said. Syrs fear not but that ye
shall have suffycient dyscharge in that behalf / so ye take the duke to your
sovereign lord / for ye shall se by the content of the kings charters / that
there shall never questyon be made thereof in time to come. Whan^e they of
Bordeaux saw they were so nere touched / they found them another socoure and
said. Fair lords / your co^myssion extends not all only upon us / but in
likewise to them of the city of Bayon / and to the prelates and barons of
Gascoyne / and to all that be under the obeysaunce of the king of England. ye
shall draw you toward them and as they do and order the^ / we shall follow
the same. Other answer the co^myssioners could not have at that time of them
of Burdeau^. Than they departed and rode to Lyborne / where the duke of
Lancastre lay.

When the duke herd their aunswers / he imagyned in himself / that the
^^synesse that he was come thither for / should not be so sone atcheued as he
trusted it should have been. Than he sent his counsel to the city of Bayon /
and as they sped in Bordeaux so they did there / other answer could they have
none. And finally all the prelates and noble men / counsaylours of cytes and
good towns in Gascoyne / under the obeysaunce of the king of England /
conjoined them together / and concluded in the form and manner as I shall show
you. They said they would gladly receive ye duke of Lancastre in to their
cyt^es / towns / and castelles / as the son of king Edward / and uncle to
king Richard of England / so that at his entringes he should solemply swear
/ that pesably and in good manner he and his should entreat the people with out
enforsynge of any thing / and to pay reasonably for every thing that they
should dispende / and also to swear that he should not oppress nor cause to be
oppressed the iurysdictyon of the Crown of England / by no manner of way nor
accyon. The duke answered to this and said / that he was not come in to the
country to grieve or oppress the people / but would rather keep and defend
them against all men / as his heritage / and desired and required them / that
the commandment of the king of England might be observed and acomplisshed.
Than the hole country by a comune voice / said yt in no wise they would
depart fro the crown of England / and that it was not in the king of
Englandes power to give them away to another lord / nor to put them fro the
crown of England. These demaundes and denyenges were long a debatyng /
between the duke of Lancastre and the lords and towns of Gascon. And when the
duke saw none other remedy / than he made request to the country that the
prelates and noble men / and cou^saylours of the good towns should send
suffycient personages to the king of England and to his counsel / and how
he would send in likewise notable persons of his counsel. and look what so
ever the king and his counsel should determyne in that cause / he promised
surely to abide there by / whether it were with him or against him. Than they of
Gascon consydred well that his request was reasonable / and agreed to do as the
duke had desired. Than the duke rode to Burdeaur / and was lodged in the abbey
of saint Andrews / where he had been lodged before time. Than they of the city
of Bayon and Dar / appointed suffycient personages to send in to England and
the barons of Gascon under the kings obeysaunce / sent in like wise. Also ye
shall know that when ye french king and his uncles understood that the duke
of Laucastre was peasably entered in to the city of Bordeaux / and knew not
for what intent / nor whether he would keep or break the trewce. Than he and
his counsel determined to send to him / to know somewhat of his intent.
There was appointed to go / the lord Boucyquant marshall of France / the lord
Johan of castle Morante / and Johan Bars of Barroys / and they to have with
them a thousand spears. Thus they rode forth till they came to the city of
Again / and there tarried. Than they sent harauldes and messnagers to Bordeaux to
the duke of Lancastre / showing him how they would gladly speak with him. The
duke made these messangers good chere / and wrote again to these lords /
certifyeng them / that where as they had great desire to speak with him / in
likewise he had the same to speak with them / and because they should take ye
less pain he promised to come and mete with them at Bergerate. And when the
french lords saw this letter / they gave credence thereto and ordered them
there after / and as soon as they knew that the duke was come to Bergerate /
they departed fro Again and rode thither. There they were received and lodged in
the town / and their company in the subbarbes. These lords spoke with the
Duke and showed him their message. The duke received them swetely / and
answered and said / how he would be a good and a kind neighbor to the
french king and the realm and to keep and maintain the trewce taken between
the two kings / for he said he him self was one of the princypalles that
aided to make and ordayn that truce / wherefore he said he ought not nor would
not break it / thereof they might be well assured. The dukes answer pleased
greatly the lords of France. Thus the duke and they were lovingly together /
and the duke gave them a great dinner and supper / and after they took their
leave / and the duke returned to Bordeaux and the french men in to France.
They found in their way the duke of Berrey at the city of Poyeters / and
they showed him what they had done. The duke of Berrey thought the duke of
Lancasters answer reasonable / and so did ye french king and the duke of
Burgoyne / and so the matter abode still in this estate. And for this cause quod
sir Johan Graily the duke of Lancastre has sent hither in to England of his
counsel / as sir Wylliam Pe^reer and sir Peter Clyfton / and two clerks
learned in the law / as master Johan Huche and master Johan Rychard of
Leycettour / to treat and to pleate his matters before the king and his uncles
/ and for this cause the king rydeth to Eltham / and shall be there on
thursday next / that shall be Mary maudelyn day / but what shall be done as yet
I know not. But as I am enfourmed of some english men that know somewhat /
the duke of Gloucestre will be princypally of the opynion yt his brother the
duke of Lancastre should abide still in Guyen / rather than to retourue again
in to England / because he was so great with the king. for I ensure you this
duke of Gloucestre is a maruaylous minded man / proud and presumptuous / he
would rule all him self / and he is so beloved of the comynalte / that what so
ever he says they will enclyne to him. He caused the valyaunte knight the
lord Simon Burle and the duke of Irelande / the archebysshoppe of york and
many other knights / and other of the kings counsel to dye for hatred and
yuell will / during the seasone that the duke of Lancastre was beyond the sea
in Castyle. He is more dred in England than beloved.

Now let this matter pass quod sir John^ Graily / and I shall show you now
the second business that the king has to do / as I am enfourmed. The
kings pleasure is to be remaryed / and has sertched over all for a wife. if
the duke of Burgoyne or the earl of Haynalte had any daughter to mary / the
king would gladly have had one of them / but they have none / but such as be
married. It has been showed the king that the king of Navarre has both
suffers and daughters / but he will not entende yt ways. The duke of
Gloucestre has a daughter able to mary he would gladly that the king should
have had her / but the king would not / for he said she was to nere of his
kynne / for she is his cosyn germayne. The king enclyneth most his mind to
the French kings daughter / whereof all the country has great marueyle that
he would take his enemies daughter. the king is not the best beloved Prince
of the world with his people / but he sets little thereby. he shows always
how he had rather have war with any other realm than with France / wherefore
he would have a good peace between the french king and him and their realms
/ for the king will often times say that the war has endured to long
between them / and that many valiant men are deed thereby on both parties /
whereby the christen faith is sore mynysshed and febled. And it is not
pleasant to the realm of England that he should mary with France / and it
has been showed him that the daughter of France is over young / and that this
five or six year she shall not be able to keep him company. Thereto he has
answered and says / that she shall grow right well in age / and though he
fast a season he shall take it well a worth / and shall order her in the mean
season at his pleasure / and after the manner of England / saying also how he
is yet young enough to abide till the lady be of age. No man can break the
king out of this purpose / and or ye depart / ye shall here much of this
matter. And thus for these causes the king rydeth now to Eltham.

THus this gentle knight sir Johan of Graily and I devised together as we rode
between Rochestre and Dertforde. this knight was capytayn of Bouteuyle /
bastard son sometime to the Captall of Beusz / and I herd his words gladly
and did put them in memory. And all the way between Leads and Eltham I rode
most part in his company / and with sir Wylliam Lysle. Thus the king came to
Eltham on a tuesday / and on the wednysday the lords of all costs began to
assemble. Thither came the duke of Gloucestre / and the earls of Derby /
Arundell / Northumberlande / Kent / Rutlande / and the earl Marshall / and the
archebysshoppes of Caunterbury and york / and the bysshoppes of London and
Wynchester. And on the thursday about the hour of three / they assembled
together in the kings chamber in the kings presence. Than the knights of
Gascoyne were sent for / and the cou^saylours of the good towns / And also the
Duke of Lancastres counsel was sent for. I was not present nor might not be
suffered / there were none but the lords of the counsel / who debated the
matter more than four hours. And after dinner I fell in acquayntau^ce with an
ancient knight whom I knew in king Edwardes days / and he was as than of
king Rychardes privy counsel / he was called sir Richard Sury he knew me
anon / and yet in.xxiiii. years he had not seen me before / which was at
Colbridge / and at Bruselles / in the house of duke Wyncelante of Brabant / and
of the duchess Iahan of Brabant. this knight sir Richard Sury made me good
chere / and demanded of me many things / and I answered him as I knew. And
as I walked up and down with him in a galery before the kings chamber / I
demanded him questyons of that counsel / and desired him to tell me if he
might what conclusion was taken. He herd me well and paused a little / and
afterward said. sir Johan I shall show you / for it is no matter to be hydden
and kept secret / for shortly ye shall here them publysshed all openly. ye
know well quod he / and Iame sure ye have herd rehearsed how the duke of
Lancastre is gone in to Acquytayne / to rejoice the gyft^ that the king my
soueraygne lord has given him / for the love that he has to him / for he
has done the king right good service and the crown of England / therefore
in reward the king has clearly given to him and to his heirs for ever /
the hole duchy of Acquitayne / so as it e^tendeth in metes and lymytacyons /
seneschalles / baylyages / sygnories / and wasselages / and clean quyteth all
them that hold of him by faith or oath / and in all homage the resort
reserved / more the king has reserved to the crown of England in time to
come. And this gift is so sufficyently confermed that all the kings other
uncles and all the counsel of England has acorded there to / and the king
has given special commandment to all his subgiettes in the said
lymytacyons of Acquytayne / to obey in all points without any othermeane / his
dear and well beloved uncle / duke Johan of Lancastre / and after ye sight of
his letters to hold and to take him to their sovereign lord / and to swear to
him faith and homage / and to hold of him truly / as they have auncyently
done and held at the date of those letters / given by the king of England or
his deputies or co^myssioners. And who soever that rebelleth or speaks against
this the kings grant of what condycyon so ever he be / to answer thereto
within three days. The king gave to his uncle of Lancastre and to his
commyssioners / full power and puyssaunce to correct them / and to put them
out of all hope to have any other return or resort. yet not withstanding
all these letters and strayte commandment of the king / the good towns and
cities of Gascoyne / under the king of Englandes obeysau^ce / and all other
lords / knights and gentlemen of the country / are conjoined together to
keep their towns close against the duke / and will not nor are not in mind
to obey the duke in this case / for they say / and have said / and yet sustain
at this hour / that the gift that the king has given to his uncle of
Lancastre / is not suffycient nor profitable / and out of the order of reason.
And yt duke who would not win them but by gentylnesse / herd pacyently
their defenses. and that no further inconuenyentes should ensue / therefore his
counsel and their counsayles are come hither to debate and to declare the
cause why they do not obey the kings commandment. And surely as this day
they have right wisely showed their answer / and laid forth certain artycles
of reason / and they have been well herd. And they have laid such reasons
that in a manner the king and his counsel think they have cause to abide by
their quarrel / I shall show you how / but I would ye kept it secret till it
be known further abrod. And I answered I would so do. Well quod the knight /
one (as me thought was offyciall of Bordeaux) spoke for all his party / and
first showed forth his procutacyon and auctorite / to the intent he might the
better be believed / and than began and said / that the city of Bordeaux /
and the cities of Bayon and Dax and all the sygnories and lorshyppes that be
appendaunt to the lymyttes of the said countries and cities / are of so noble
condycyon / that no king of England by no manner of accyon or deed may put
away or dysceuer them fro the demayns of the crown of England / nor to give
or alyenate them / to child / uncle / nor brother / by reasone of marriage or
otherwise / and to veryfie this we say that the above named towns / cities /
and sygnories are suffyciently priueleged by kings of England / who have
sworn faithfully to hold and to keep us so / without reuocasyon. For as soon
as any King of England enters in to the possessyon of the heritage of the
Crown of England / he swereth sufficiently on the euangelystes to hold this
ferme and stable without breaking. and ye right dear sir as king of England
have made like oath. And sir to veryfie this to be of troth / behold here
these writings. And there with he showed forth letters and charters under the
signs of notaryes imperyalles / and sealed with the great seal of England /
given by the same king Richard there being present / and there openly he
read it from clause to clause. The charter was well herd and understand /
for it was both in laten and in French / and it named in the end many
witnesses of prelates and great lords of England / who were for the more
surety testes of that deed / at the least to the nombre of.xi. When the
kings counsel herd this / they beheld each other / and looked on the king.
There was no man spoke a word nor made no replycacion. when he had read it
over he folded it and put it up / and spoke further / addressynge his words to
the king / and said. Right dear sir and redouted soueraygne lord / and you
my right dear lords / and other / at my departing out of the country / I was
charged to show you by the counsaylours of the good Cities and towns of
Gascoyne / being under the obeysaunce of the crown of England / has well
over seen the form and manner of your commandment / sent unto them under
your seal / which they knew right well / yet they think and say that this
commandment may not be obeyed / for if so were that the cities and good
towns of Guyen would enclyne to receive the duke of Lancastre to their lord /
and acquyte for ever the homage and obeysaunce that they owe to you / it should
be greatly to the preiudyce of the crown of England / for though it were so
that at this time present the duke of Lancastre is the kings uncle and
subgiet / and well beloved / and would hold and keep all points and artycles
belongyng to the crown of England / yet it may so hap that such love and
tenure may lightly be lost / by change of heirs / by reason of maryages that
are made between lords and ladies / in chaungynge fro one to another / though
they be nere of lygnage / by dyspensacyon of the pope / for sometime it is of
necessyte that maryages be made of high Princes or of their children / one
with another / to hold their lands and sygnories in love and amyte. And so it
might fall that such heirs as might dyscende of the Duke of Lancastre /
should conioyne them by marriage to the children of some king in France / or
of dukes of Berrey / Bretaygne / or earls of Foize / or Armynake / or kings of
Navarre / or dukes of Aniou or of Main / and than they being beyond the sea
peradventure in the parties of France / should claim their enherytaunce / and
thereby put the country of Guyen in dyscorde / and to bring it to be against
the crown of England / whereby the king of England than reygnynge / and the
Realm also / should have peradventure over much pain to recover it again /
and so the right to be put far of fro thence whereunto it should return and
be / as of the demayne of the Crown of England. Wherefore right dear sir and
redouted lords and noble counsaylours / please it you to consydre all these
points and artycles which I have purposed in your presence / and determyne it
as ye shall seem best / for sir the full opynion of all the country is / they
say they will abide still in the obey saunce of you right redouted lord and
king / and in the demayne of the noble Crown of England. Therewith this
offyciall held his peace / and the prelates and lords each of them regarded
other. Than they drew together and aproched to the king first his two uncles
/ and the earls of Derby and Arundell. Than they of Acquytayne were commanded
to depart till they were called again. They departed and also the two
knights that were come thither fro the duke of Lancastre. Than the king
demanded counsel what should be done / and what answer should be made. The
prelates turned the answer to the kings uncles / because the matter touched
them rather than any other. At the first they excused them saying they might
not well answer / for the matter was common / and ought to be debated by
common counsel / and not by lygnage nor favor. Thus they bode a good space
/ but finally the answer was laid on the duke of Gloucestre / and he was
prayed and required to say his advise. Than he answered and said / how it
was a herd thing to take a way or to dysanull the gift of a king /
confermed and sealed by the acorde of all his subgiettes / and by delyberacyon
of his special counsel / wherefore he said his subgiettes should be rebel
that would not obey / for in that they would make that the king should not be
lord of his own enheritaunce / if yt he might not do with his own what it
pleased him. some glosed those words / and some though^ in their courage / that
the answer was not reasonable / but they durst not say against it / the
duke of Gloucestre was so sore dred / and the earl of Derby son to the duke
of Lancastre was there present / who furthered those words and said. Fair
uncle ye have well said / I am of your opinyon. Therewith the counsel began to
break / and some murmured one with another / and they of Guyen nor yet the duke
of Lancasters knights were not called again at that time. When the king saw
all the matter he dyssimuled a little / and it was his entensyon that they
should assemble together again in counsel after dinner / to se if any other
propre way might be taken for the honor of the crown of England. Than the
king caused the bishop of Caunterbury to speak of that he had given him in
charge in the morning to speak of / that was upon the state of his marriage /
and to send in to France. The lords were of accord and named them that
should go / which were the archebysshoppe of Duuelyn / the earl of Rutlande /
the Earl Marshall / the lord Beaumonde / the lord Hughe Spenser / the lord
Loys Clyfforde / and twenty knights and xl. squyers. These were sent in to
France to treat for the marriage of the french kings daughter Isabell / of
eight year of age / and yet she was all ready promised to the duke of Bretayns
son / by a treaty yt was made in Towrs in Thourayne. Now behold how this
might be broken / for the French king and his uncles had sealed with the
duke of Bretayne / yet for all that thenglysshe ambassadors had their charge
given unto them / and so they departed out of England and aryued at Calays /
and there tarried a five days / and than departed in great array / and took
the way to Amyence / and they sent before March the haraulde / who had
brought to them saueconducte going and coming / and beside that the lord
Moncheuerell was set to be their guide / and to se them served of all things
necessary. Now we shall leave to speak of them and return to our first
purpose.

Now as I have showed you before / the counsaylours of the Cities and good
towns of Acquytayne / prayed the king and his counsel / to whom they were
boude / to mayntayn their lyberties and fraunches / as in the demayne of the
Crown of England / as he was sworn to do / affermynge that surely they would
keep their auncyente lyberties / and will not break it for no manner of cause or
condycion / and in holding thus their opinion / four parts of the counsel
and the common voice of the country / reputed them for valiant and worthy
men. But the duke of Gloucestre was of another opinyon / for he would that his
brother the duke of Lancastre should have bydden still in Acquytayne / for he
thought he was over great in England / and to nere the king / as for his
brother the duke of york he cared not / for the duke of york was a prince
that loved his ease and little business. Also he had a fair lady to his wife
/ daughter to the earl of Kent / on whom was all his pleasure. But the duke of
Gloucestre was subtyle / and ever demanded somewhat of his nephue king
Richard / yet he was but poor / for all that he was a great lord and
constable of England / and earl of Hertforde and of Perces / and of Bokyngham
/ and also he had yearly out of the kings cofers four thousand nobles / and
never rode on the kings business nor for the realm one day / without he
knew why and wherefore. For these causes he was not indyfferent / for the
matters of Acquytayne / for he would have had his brother of Lancastre to have
bydden still in Acquitayn for ever / for than he thought he would have shyfted
well enough in England. As soon as he had said his sentence (as ye have
herd before) and that he saw some murmured in the kings chamber / and that
the prelates and lords talked together two and two / he issued out of ye
chamber / and the earl of Derby with him / and came in to the hall at E^tham /
and made a clothe to be laid on a table and so sat / down to dynner / and
left all other still talking together. When the duke of york knew that he
was at dinner / he went to keep him company. and after dinner which he made
short / the duke of Gloucestre dyssymuled the matter / and took his leave of
the King sitting at the table / and so departed and took his horse and rode
to London / and the earl of Derby abode still with the lords that day and the
next day. Thus they of Acquytayne could have none expedicyon nor
delyueraunce.

I Have delyght to write this matter at length / because to enfourme you of the
truth / for I that am auctour of this hystory was present in all these
matters / and this valiant knight sir Richard Surye showed me every thing.
And so it was that on the sunday following all such as had been there were
departed / and all their counsaylours / except the duke of york / who abode
still about the king / and the lord Thomas Percy and sir Richard Sury showed
my business to the king. Than the king desired to se my book that I had
brought for him. So he saw it in his chamber / for I had laid it there ready
on his bed. When the King opened it / it pleased him well / for it was
fair enlumyned and written / and covered with crymson velvet / with ten botons
of silver and gylte / and Roses of gold in the mids with two great clapses
gylte / rychely wrought. Than the king demanded me whereof it treated / and I
showed him / how it treated of matters of love / whereof the king was glad
and looked in it / and reed it in many places / for he could speak and read
French very well. And he took it to a knight of his chamber named sir
Richard Creadon / to bear it in to his secret chamber. And the same sunday I
fell in acquayntaunce with a Squire of England called Henry Castyde / an
honest man and a wise / and could well speak French. He co^panyed with me /
because he saw the king and other lords made me good chere / and also he had
seen the book that I gave to the king. Also sir Richard Sury had showed him
how I was a maker of hystories. Than he said to me as here after follows.

The deuyse / and of the conquest that king Richard had made in Irla^de / and
how he brought in to his obeysaunce four kings of that country. Cap. CC.ii.
SIr Johan quod he / have ye not found in the kings court sithe ye came
hyder / no man that has told you of the voyage that the king made but late in
to Irlande / and in what manner the four kings of Irelande are come in to the
obeysaunce of the king of England? And I answered no. Than shall I show you
quod the squire / to the intent that ye may put it in perpetual memory /
when ye return in to your own country / and have leysar thereto. I was
reioysed of his words and thanked him. Than he began thus and said. Sir Johan
/ it is not in memory / that ever any king of England made such appareyle
and provision for any journey to make war against the yrisshmen / nor such a
nombre of men of arms nor archers. The king was a nine months in the
marchesse of Irelande to his great cost / and charge to the realm / for they
bare all his expe^ses. And the merchants / cities / and good towns of the
realm thought it well bestowed / when they saw the king return home again
with honor. The nombre that he had thither / getylmen and archers / were four
thousand knights and.xxx. thousand archers / well paid wekely / that every
manne was well pleased. but I show you / because ye should know the tronthe.
Irelande is one of the yuell countries of the world to make war upon / or to
bring under subjection. For it is closed strongely and wyldely with high
forestes and great waters and maresshes / and places inhabytable. It is hard
to enter to do them of the country any do^mage / nor ye shall find no town
nor person to speak with all. For the men draw to the woods / and dwell in
caves and small cotages / under trees and among busshes and hedges / like wild
savage beestes. And when they know that any man makes war against the^ /
and is entered in to their countries / than they draw toguyder to the straytes
and passages / and defend it / so that no man can enter in to the^. And when
they se their time / they will sone take their advantage on their enemies /
for they know the country and are light people. For a man of arms being
never so well horsed / and ron as fast as he can / the yrisshe men will ryn a
foot as fast as he and overtake him / yea / and leap up upon his horse
behind him / and draw him fro his horse / for they are strong men in the
arms / and have sharp weapons with large blades with two edges / after the
manner of darte heedes / wherewith they will slay their enemy / and they repute
not a man deed / till they have cut his throat / and opyn his belly and taken
out his heart / and carry it away with the^. some say / such as know their
nature / that they do eat it / and have great delight therein. they take no man
to ransom. And whan^e they se at any encountre / that they be ouermatched /
than they will depart a sonder / and go and hyde them self in busshes /
wodes / hedges / and caves / so that no man shall find them. Also sir Wylliam
of Wyndsore / who has most used the wars in those parties / of any other
english man / yet he could never learn the manner of ye country / nor know
their condycions. They be herd people and of rude engen and wit / and of
diverse frequentacyons and usage / they set nothing by iolyte nor fresshe
apparel / nor by nobleness / for though their rleame be soueraynly governed
by kings / whereof they have plenty / yet they will take no knowledge of
gentylnesse but will contynewe in their rudeness / acordynge as they are
brought up. Truth it is that four of the princypall kings and most
puyssaunt / after the manner of the country / are come to the obeysaunce of the
king of England by love and fayrenesse / and not by battle nor constraynte.
The earl of Ormonde who marches upon them has taken great pain / and has so
treated with them / that they came to Duuelyn to the king / and submytted them
to him / to be under the obeysaunce of the crown of England / wherefore the
king and all the realm reputeth this for a great and an honorable deed / and
thinks this voyage well be stowed / for king Edward of good memory did
never so much upon them as king Richard did in this voyage. The honor is
great but the profit is but little: For though they be kings yet no man can
deuyse nor speak of ruder personages.

I Shall show you somewhat of their rudeness / to the entente it may be
ensample again people of other nacyons / I know it well / for I have proved
it by them selves / For when they were at Duuelyn I had the governance of
them about a month / by the kings commauudement and his counsel / to
thentent that I should learn them to use them self according to the usage of
England / and because I could speak their language / as well as French or
English / for in my youth I was brought up among them. I was with the earl
of Ormonde / father to the Earl that now is / who loved me right well /
because I could as tha^ ride and handell an horse metely well. And it fortuned
one time that the said earl (who as than was my master) was sent with three
hundred spears and a thousand archers in to the marchesse of Irelande / to
make war with the yrisshe men / for always the English men have had war
with the^ / to subdue and put them under. And on a day as the said Earl went
against the^ / I rode on a goodly horse of his / light and swyfte: Thus I rode
and followed my master. And the same day the yrisshe men were laid in a
busshement / and whan^e we came nere them / they opyned their busshement.
Thanne the Englisshe archers began to shote so egerly that the yrisshe men
could not suffer it / for they are but simply armed / therefore they reculed
and went back. Than^e the Earl my master followed in ye chase / and I that
was well horsed followed him as nere as I could. and it fortuned so that my
horse was afraid / and took his bridell in his tethe and ran away with me /
and whether I would or not / he bare me so farforthe among the yrisshe men /
that one of them by lyghtnesse of ronnynge lepte up behind me / and enbrased
me in his arms / and did me none other hurt / but so led me out of the way
/ and so rode still behind me the space of two hours. And at the last
brought me in to a secret place / thycke of busshes / and there he found his
company who were come thither and escaped all dangers / for the English men
pursued not so far. Than as he showed he had great joy of me / and led me
in to a town and a strong house among the woods / waters / and myres. The
town was called Harpely / and the ge^tylman that took me was called Brine
Costeret. He was a goodly man / and as it has been showed me / he is as yet a
live / how be it he is very aged. This Brine Costeret kept me seuyn year with
him / and gave me his daughter in marriage / of whom I had two daughters. I
shall show you how I was delivered.

IT happened at the seuin years end one of their kings named Arthur mackemur
/ king of Lynster / made an army against duke Lion of Clarence / son to king
Edward of England / and against sir Wyllm^ of Wynsore. And not far fro the
city of Lynster the English men and yrisshe men met toguyder / and many
were slain and taken on both parties / But the English men opteygned the
vyctorie and the yrisshe men fled / and the king Arthur saved him self / but
Brine Costeret my wives father was taken prisoner under the duke of Clarence
baner. He was taken on the same courser / that he took me on. The horse was
well known among the earl of Ormondes folks / and than he showed how I was
alive and was at his manner of Harpelyn / and how I had wedded his daughter /
whereof the duke of Clarence / sir Wylliam Wynsore / and the English men were
right glad. Than^e it was showed him that if he would be delivered out of
prison / that he should deliver me in to the English men's hands / and my
wife and children. With great pain he made that bargayne / for he loved me well
and my wife his daughter and our children When he saw he could make his
fynaunce none otherwise / he accorded thereto / but he reteigned mine eldest
daughter still with him So I and my wife and our second daughter returned in
to England / and so I went and dwelte beside Bristowe on the river of Syuerne.
My two daughters are married / and she in Irela^de has three sons and two
daughters / and she that I brought with me has four sons and two daughters.
and because the langage of yrisshe is as ready to me as the English tongue (for
I have always co^tynued with my wife / and taught my children the same speech)
Therefore the king my sovereign lord and his counsel / commanded me to give
attendau^ce on these four kings / and to govern and bring them to reason /
and to the usage and customs of England seeing they had yielded them to to be
under his obeysaunce / and of the crown of England and they were sworn to
hold it for ever. and yet I ensure you / for all that / I did my power to
ensygne and to learn them good manner / yet for all that they be right rude and
of gross engyn / much pain I had to make them to speak any thing in fair
manner / somewhat I altered them but not much / for in many cases they drew to
their natural rudeness. The king my soueraygne lords intent was / that in
manner / countenance / and apparel of clothyng / they should use according to
the manner of England / for the king thought to make them all four knights
they had a fair house to lodge in in Duuelyn / and I was charged to abide
still with them and not to depart. And so two or three days I suffered them to
do as they list / and said nothing to them / but followed their own
appetytes. They would sytte at the table and make countenance another good nor
fair. Than I thought I should cause the^ to change that manner. They would
cause their mystrelles / their servants / and varlettes / to sytte with them
and to eat in their own dysshe / and to drink of their cups. And they
showed me / that the usage of their country was good / for they said / in all
things (except their beds) they were and lived as common. So the fourth day
I ordained other tables to be covered in the hall / after ye usage of England.
And I made these four kings to sytte at the high table / and there mynstrels
at another board / and their servants and varlettes at another byneth them /
whereof by semynge they were displeased / and beheld each other and would not
care / and said / how I would take fro them their good usage / wherein they
had been norisshed. Than I answered them smylyng to a peace them / that it
was not honorable for their estates to do as they did before / and that they
must leave it / and use the custom of England / and that it was the kings
pleasure they should so do / and how he was charged so to order them. When they
hard that they suffered it / because they had put them self under the
obeysau^ce of the king of England / and parceuered in the same as long as I
was with them. yet they had one use which I knew well was used in their
country / and that was they did were no breches I caused breches of lynen
clothe to be made for them. While I was with them I caused them to leave many
rude things / as well in clothyng as in other causes. Much ado I had at the
first to cause them to wear gowns of sylke furred with Myneuere and gray /
For before these kings thought them self well apparelled when they had on a
mantell. They rode always without sadelles and styropes / and with great pain
I made the^ to ride after our usage. Andon a time I demanded the^ of their
believe / wherewith they were not content / and said / how they believed on god
and on the trynite / as well as we. Than I demanded on what pope was their
affection The answered me on him of Rome. Than^e I demanded if they would not
gladly receive the order of knyghthode / and that the king of England should
make the^ knights / according to the usage of France and England / and
other countries. they answered how they were knights all redye / and that
suffyced for them. I asked where they were made knights / and how and when.
They answered / yt in the age of seuyn year they were made knights in Irelande
/ And that a king makes his son a knight. and if the son have no father
alive / than the next of his blood may make him knight. And than^e this young
knight shall begin to just with small spears / such as they may bear with
their case / and rynne against a shield / set on a stake in the field / and
the more spears that he breaks / the more he shall be honored. I knew their
manner well enough / though I did demand it. But than I said / that the
knighthode that they had taken in their youth / suffyced not to the king of
England. But I said he should give them after another manner. They demanded
how. I answered / that it should be in the holy church / which was the
most worthyest place. Than they enclyned somewhat to my words. Within two
days after the earl of Ormonde came to the^ who could right well speak the
langage / for some of his lands lay in those parties. He was sent to them by
the king and his counsel. They all honored him and he them. Than he fell in
sweet communycacion with them / and he demanded of them how they lyked me.
They answered and said / well for he has well showed us the usage of this
country / wherefore we ought to thank him / and so we do. This answer
pleased well the earl of Ormonde. Than he entered little and little to speak of
the order of chiualry / which the king would they should receive He showed it
them fro point to point / how they should behave them self / and what
parteygned to knyghthode. The earls words pleased much these four kings /
whose names were these. First the great Ancle king of Mecte. The second Brine
of Thomo^de king of Thomonde. The third Arthure of Mackequemur king of
Lynster. The fourth Conhue / king of Cheueno and Darpe They were made knights
by king Richard of England in the Cathedral church of Duuelyn / dedycate of
saint Johan Baptyst It was done on our lady day in March / as than it fell on
a Thursday. These four kings watched all the night before in the church / and
the next day at high mass time / with great sole^pnyte they were made
knights / and with them sir Thomas Orphen / sir Ioatas Pado / and sir Johan
Pado his cosyn. These kings sat that day at the table with king Richard.
They were regarded of many folks / because there behauyng was strange to the
manner of England / and other countries / and ever naturally men desire to se
newelties. Than I sir John^ Froissart said. Henry / I believe you well: and I
would it had cost me largely that I had been there. And surely this year past I
had come hyder and it had not been / for that I herd of the death of queen
Anne of England / which did let me. But one thing I would desire of you
to know / how these four kings of Irelande came so soon to the king of
Englandes obeysaunce / when king Edward the kings graunfather / who was so
valiant a prince and so redouted over all / could never subdue them nor put
them under / and yet he had always war with the^. and in that they are
subdued now / ye said it was by treaty / and by the grace of god. In deed the
grace of god is good / who so can have it / it is much worth. But it is seen
now a days / that erthely princes gets little without it be by puissau^ce. I
desire to know this for when I shall come in to Heynalt / of which country I
am of / I shall be examyned of this and many other things / both by duke Aubert
of Bauier / earl of Heynalte / of Holande and of zelande / and also by his
son Wyllm^ of Bauyere / who writes him self lord of Frese / which is a
great country and a puissaunt / which country the said duke and his son
claymeth to have by right succession / and so did their predecessors before
them / but the Fresons would never fall to any reason / nor come under
obeysau^ce / nor as yet do not unto this day. than answered sir Henry Crystal
and said. Sir Johan / to show you the very troth I can not / but as many a
one says / and it is to suppose / yt the great puissau^ce yt the king had
over with him / and tarried there in their country nine months / and every
man well paid / abashed the yrisshe men. Also the sea was closed fro them on
all parts / whereby their lyue^ges and marchau^dises might not enter in to
their countries / though they that dwell far within the realm cared little
for it (for they know natte what marchaundyse means / nor they live but
grosely and rudely like unto beestes) yet such as lives on the marchesse of
England and by the Sea coost / use feate of marchaundyse with us / and in to
other places. King Edward of noble memory in his time / had to answer so
many wars / what in France Bretayne / Gascone / and Scotland / so that his
people were divided in diverse places / and sore occupied / wherefore he could
not send no great nombre in to Irelande. But when the Irysshmen saw ye great
nombre of men of war that king Richard had in Irelande this last journey
/ The yrisshmen aduysed them self and came to obeysau^ce. And in deed / of
old time there was a king in England named Edward / who is a saint and
canonysed / and honored through all this realm. In his time he subdued the
Danes / and disconfyted them by battle on the Sea three times. And this saint
Edward king of England / lord of Irelande and of Acquitayn the yrisshmen
loved and dredde him much more / than any other king of England that had been
before. And therefore our sovereign lord king Richard / this year past / when
he was in Irelande / in all his armories and deuyses / he left the beryng of
the arms of England / as the lybardes and flour delyces quarterly / and bare
the arms of this saint Edward / that is a cross patent gold and goules with
four white martenettes in the field / whereof it was said / the yrisshmen were
well pleased / and the sooner they enclyned to him / For of truth / ye
predecessors of these four kings obeyed with faith and homage to ye said
king Edward / and they repute king Richard a good man and of good conscience
and so they have done to him faith and homage / as they ought to do: and in
like manner as their predecessors sometime did to saint Edward. Thus I have
showed you the manner how the king our sovereign lord has this year
accomplysshed and furnysshed his voyage in Ireland: put it in your memorial /
to the intent / that when ye shall return in to your own country / ye may
write it in your cronicle / with many other hystories that depend to the same
matter. Than I thanked him / and said it should be done. So I took leave of
him. Than I met with March the heraulde / and I demanded of him what arms
this Henry Christell bare / and I showed the heraulde / how this sir Henry had
showed me the manner of the kings torney in Irelande / and the state of the
four kings / who had been (as he said) in his gouernyng / more than fyftene
days at Duuelyn. The heraulde answered me and said. Sir / he bears in his
arms Silver / a cheuerne goules / three besans goules. All these things I did
put in writynge / because I would not forgette them.

THus I tarried in the king of Englandes court / as long as it pleased me /
not always in one place / for the king often times removed / to Eltham / to
Ledes / to Kyngstone / to Shene / to Charsey / or to Wyndsore / about the
marchesse of London. And I was informed of a truth that the king wrote to his
uncle the duke of Lancastre / for they of Acquitayne spedde so in their
business / that their country abode still to the crown of England. Than^e
it was concluded by general counsel of England / that the gift that the
king had given to the duke of Lancastre / must needs abide still as his
own: how be it the duke of Gloucestre would that his brother might have
enjoyed the kings gift / but his saying could not be herd in that case /
For they of the Realm of England (because of doutes and casualtyes in time to
come) herd well the words of them of Bordeaux and of Bayone. And consydred
well / that if the heritage of Acquitaygne were put fro the Crown of
England / it should be in time to come a great prejudice to the realm /
which they would in no wise should fortune / for always Burdeux and Bayon /
and the fro^ters and marches of Gascon / had kept and augmented greatly / the
honor of the realm of England. These things were well co^sydred of the wise
men of the kings counsel / ye duke of Gloucestre absent / for before him no
man durst speak. so the matter abode in this case. We shall leave of this matter
/ and speak of the king of Englandes ambassadors: as the earl of Rutlande and
therle marshall / and other / that were sent in to France to treat of the
marriage between king Richard their lord and the daughter of Charles French
king / who was but eight years of age / and I shall show you how they spedde.

Of the ambassade that the king of England sent in to France to treat of
the marriage between the lady Isable the French kings eldest daughter: and him
self: and of the loving answer they had. Capi. CC.iii.
THese English lords rode fro Calais to Amyence and to Clermount in
Beauuosyn / and so to Paris / and i^ every place they were well received by the
commandment of the french king. They were lodged about yt cross of Tyrouer:
They were a five hundred horses. The French king was lodged at the castle of
Lour / and the queen and her children at the house of saint Poule / upon the
river of Seyne. The duke of Berrey at the house of Nesle / the duke of Burgoyne
at the house of Arthoyse / and the duke of Burbone in his own house / the duke
of Orlyau^ce / the earl of saint Poule / and the lord of Coucy / at their own
houses. The king had assembled there all his counsel / to the intent to make
the better answer to thembassadours of England. The king had commanded that
every day there should be delivered to these ambassadors two hundred crowns
of France / for their small expenses / and for their horses. And the chief of
these English lords as the earl Marshall and therle of Rutla^de were often
times with the king and dyned with him. they had as good there as could be
devised / for the love of the king of England. These lords desired ever to
have an answer / and they were ever fed forth with fair words. For the
noble men of France had great marueyle of the requests of the English men.
And that the king of England would marry with France / seeing that the war
had been so cruel / and so long endured. And some of the French kings
counsel said / how may our king agree to give his daughter in marriage to
his adversary / or this treaty should be made. We think we shall have peace
with England by some other ways / though it be not by the means of marriage.
And as at yt time there was a valiant knight of the French kings counsel /
called sir Raynalt of Corby. He was a far castyng man / and consydred what
might fall in time to come. Than^e he said to the king and to his uncles. My
lords and masters. A man should enter in at the right door in to a house. It
seems that king Richard of England would nothing to you nor to the realm /
but love and all favor / seeing that by reason of marriage / he would alye him
to you. Two times your counsaylours and his have met toguyder at Amyence and
at Balyngham / to treat for a peace / and yet they could never take no good
conclusyon / but on the state of a truce. And sir / it is well known / that
Thomas duke of Gloucestre king Richardes uncle / is of a contrary opinyon /
against ye king and his other two uncles / the dukes of Lancaster and of york.
The king nor other can not make him agree wyllingly to have peace / how be it
his puissaunce can natte resyst the kings power. Therefore sir / after mine
opinion / receive this offer and refuce not this treaty / and let these lords
have such answer / as may content them. Than the king and his uncles agreed
thereto / and specially the duke of Burgoyne / for he was so sore charged by
reason of the wars / yt gladly he would have peace and the pri^cypall cause
was / because of Flanders / whereof he claymed to be lord by reason of his
wife / because that country marched upon England. And also the hertes of the
Flemynges were rather English than French / because of the entrecourse of
marchaundyse / between England and Flaunders by See and by land.

THan it was concluded by the French kings counsel / that there should be
as good there made to the Englysshmen as was before. And whether it was by
dissymulacyon or otherwise / the french men were determined to make a good and
a swear answer to the englisshe men / and to put them in hope that the king
of England should have his desire. The queen and her children lay at the
house of faint Powlees and where as the English lords desired to se them /
it was granted to them / and specially to se her / for whom their treaty
was. than it was showed them that they must be content how so ever they
found her / for they said she was but a young child of eight year of age /
wherefore they said / there could not be in her no great wisdom nor prudence /
how be it she was indoctryned well enough / and that the lords found well /
when they saw her. The Earl Marshall being on his knees said to her. Fair
lady / by the grace of god ye shall be our lady and queen of England. Than
answered the young lady well aduysedly / without counsel of any other
person. Sir quod she / and it please god and my lord my father that I shall be
queen of England / I shall be glad thereof / for it is showed me that I shall
be than a great lady. Than she took up the earl Marshall by the hand and led
him to the queen her mother / who had great joy of the answer that she had
made / and so were all other that herd it. The manner / countenance / and
behauoure of this young lady / pleased greatly the Ambassadors / and they said
among them self / that she was lykely to be a lady of high honor and great
goodness. Thus when these lords of England had been at Paris a twenty days /
and their costs and charges paid for by the french king / a reasonable
answer was given them / so that they were put in great hope to bring about
that they came for / how be it the french men said / it could not be done
shortly / because the lady was so young / and also she was fyansed to the duke
of Bretayns eldest son / wherefore they said they must treat to break that
promise / or they could proceed any further in that matter / and thereupon the
french king and his counsel should send into England the next lent after
/ to show how the matter went. And when the days begin to encreace and wax
fair / Than the king of England to send again in to France whom it
should please him / and they should be welcome. With this answer the
english men were contented and took leave of the queen and of her daughter /
and of the king / and of all other / and departed fro Paris and took the same
way they came and so returned to Calays / and than in to England. and the two
earls rode in post before their company / to bring tidings to the king* they
rode fro Sandwiche to Wynd sore in less thanne a day and an half. The king
was right ioyouse of their coming / and was well content with the french
kings answer. He set the matter so to his heart that he took great pleasure
therein / and took head to none other thing / but studied how he might bring
it about to have the french kings daughter to wife.

ON the othersyde the French king and his counsel studied day and night /
how they might make this marriage with England to the honor of the realm of
France. There were many in the realm of France that said / that if they had
been called to these treatyes / and our words herd / the king of England
should never have the daughter of France / for any manner of peace. What good
should it be for France / seeing the trewce between them endured but for two
year to come / and than shall we fall again in war / and each of us hate
other as we have done before? The dukes of Berrey and Orlyance were of the
same opynion / and diverse other lords of France. But the king / the duke of
Burgoyne / and the chancellor of France / enclyned to this marriage / and
glad to have peace / reseruyng always the honor of the Realm. The same
time there was a squier in France of the nacyon of Normandy in the country of
Caulx / he had in his days ben sore traueyled in far parties / and as than
he was newly returned into France / his name was Robert le menuot / but as
than he was called Robert the Hermyte / he was relygyous and of good life / of
the age of fyfty year / he had been at the treaties that was holden at
Balyngham / at which time he was well herd / and how he entered than in to
that treaty I shall show you.

Of a Squire named Roberte the Hermyte / how he was sent to the treaties of
the peace holden at Balyngham and how he was after sent in to England to
king Richard and his uncles. Cap. CC.iiii.
SO it was / when this Roberte the Hermyte returned in to France out of the
parties of Surey / and took shyppyng at Baruch. While he was upon the sea a
great tempest of wind rose / in such wise that they feared to be perysshed /
and every man tell to make his prayers to god. And at the end of this tempest
/ and that the wether began to wax fair and clear / there apered to Robert ye
Hermyte an image more clear than Crystal / and said thu^. Robert / thou shalt
issue and escape this parell / and all thy company for love of the / for god
has herd thine orisons and prayers / and he sends the word by me / that
thou should make have in to France / and go to the king and show him thine
adventure / and say unto him / that in any wise he enclyne to have peace with
his adversary king Richard of England / and among them that be treaters of
the peace / preace thou forth and show them thine aduysyon / for thou shalt
be herd. and say that all such as be of the contrary opinyon against the
peace / shall bye it derely in their life time in this world. And therewith ye
clerenesse and voice vanysshed away. Than Robert abode in a great study / but
he remembered well what he had seen and herd / by the deuyne inspyracyon. And
after this adventure they had fair wether and the wind at their wysshynge /
and than aryued in the River of Gennes: and there Robert the Hermyte took leave
of his company / and went by land fro thence till he came to Auygnon. And the
first thing he did he went to the church of saint Peter / and there found a
good virtuous man a penytenser and of him he was confessed / and showed him all
his adventure / and demanded counsel what was best to do. Than his goostly
father charged him in any wise / that he should speak nothing of this matter
till he had showed it first to the french king / and look what counsel the
king did give him so to do. This Robert followed his counsel and arrayed him
self in simple habyte all in gray / and so poorly departed fro Auygnon / and
iourneyed so long that he came to Paris / but the king was at Abbeuyle / and
the treaty began at Balyngham between the french men and English men (as
ye have herd before) Than this Robert came to Abuyle and drew to the king /
and a knight of his acquayntaunce brought him to the king / which knight was
of Normandy / and was called sir Willyam Martell / he was of the kings privy
chamber. Than Roberte the Hermyte showed the King all his hole journey and
adventure. The king herd him well / and because the duke of Burgoyne and sir
Raynolde Corby chancellor of France (who were of the kings opinion to have
peace) were at Balyngham in ye treaty holden there / the king said to Robert.
Our counsel as now is not here / they be at Balyngham. ye shall abide here
with me / and when they be returned I shall speak with mine uncle of Burgoyne
and with our chauncelloure / and than we shall do in this matter / as they shall
advise me. sir quod this Robert / as god will so be it.

THe same weke the French kings counsel returned fro Balyngham to Abbeuyle
/ and brought with them the artycles of the manner of the peace / which the
english men had devised. and the matters were so weyghty that the treaty was
put over till another day / unto such time as both kings were aduertysed of
each others demaundes / and their pleasures therein to be known. Than on ye
french party the french king drew a part his uncle of Burgoyne and the
chancellor / and showed them what enfourmacyon Robert the Hermyt had made
unto him / and the king demanded of them if it were a thing lysytte and
lawful to believe. They studied a little and at last said. Sir / we require
your grace let us se this hermyte and here him speak / and thereupon we will
take advise. Than he was sent for. When he came before the king he made his
reverence. Thanne the king said Roberte / show us here at length all the hole
matter / as ye enfourmed me before. Sir quod he gladly. Than as he that was
nothing abashed / rehearsed all the hole matter / as ye have herd before. When
he had done he departed. Than the king asked of his uncle what was best to be
done. Sir quod he / the chancellor and I shall take advise against to morrow.
Well quod the king / so be it. Than the duke and the chancellor counsayled
together on this matter. They saw well the king greatly enclyned to this
Robertes words / therefore they thought it good to advise the king to join
this Robert in co^myssion with them to go again to Balyngham to the treaty of
peace / for they thought his langage so fair and so sweet / that he should
stir the hearts of them that should here him speak / to have peace / and to
show the deuyne vysion that he had / to the lords of England. This they
thought lawful enough to be done / and the next day they showed this to the
king. And than after when the duke and the chancellor went again to
Balyngham / they had this Roberte with them. And when all the lords french
and english were assembled together in counsel / than this Robert came
before them / and there well and wisely he declared all the vysion that he
had on the sea / and affermed that it was inspyracyon deuyne sent by god /
because he would it should be so. Some of the lords of England took good head
to this matter and enclyned thereto / as the duke of Lancastre / the earl of
Salysbury / the lord Thomas Percy and other / the bishops of Lyncolne and
London / but the duke of Gloucestre and the earl of Arundell / took no head nor
set nothing thereby. When they were in their lodgings they said / they were
but fantasies / and words feigned by the frenchmen to abuse them all / how be
it they determined to write to king Richard the manner and saying of this
Robert the Hermyte / and thereupon sent a knight called Richard Credon to king
Rychardees who he found in Kent / at the castle of Leads / and delivered him
letters sent fro his ambassadors in the marches of Calays / wherein was
contained the hole saying of this Robert. The king took great pleasure in
these letters / and said how he would gladly speak with this Robert the
hermyte / he believed this vysion to be of truth. Than the king wrote again
to the duke of Lancastre and to the earl of Salysbury / that if it might be by
any means / that a good peace might be taken between him and the french king
/ their realms and alyes / for he said surely he thought that the war had
ouerlonge endured / and that it was time to have peace. And ye have herd here
before how the treaters bare them / and how the lords departed one fro
another / and how the treuce was taken to endure for four year. This was the
intent of the lords of the englyssh party / except the duke of Gloucestre /
for he thought when so ever he came in to England / never to agree to any
peace between France and England. He dyssimuled as much as he might / to
thentent to please the king and his brother of Lancastre. Thus by this means
Roberte le Hermyte came to knowledge.

ANd as ye have herd here before / how the earl of Rutlande / therle Marshall
/ the archebysshop of Dunelyn / the lord Hugh Spenser / the lord Jews
Clyfforde and other / had been sent in to France to treat for king Rychardes
marriage / and were returned again in to England / and brought the king good
tidings / so that the king was well pleased / as ye have herd before. Than
Mychelmas came / and the general counsel began / such as english men call
the term / wherein all matters be debated / and at the beginning of the said
term the duke of Lancastre returned out of Gascon in to England and had not
ben received there / as he thought he should have been (as ye have herd
before) So when the duke of Lancastre was returned / the king made him good
chere. Tydinges anon came in to France how the duke of Lancastre was
returned in to England. than the french king and his counsel determined
to send Robert the Hermyte into England with letters to the king / who
desired to se him / and that the earl of saint Poll should acquaynte him with
ye king and with the lords / that they might here him speak of the business
of Surey and Tartary / and of the great Turk and Turkey / where he had been
long / for it was thought that the lords of England would gladly here
speaking of such matters. Than this Robert the Hermyte was warned to make him
ready to go in to England in co^myssion / whereof he greatly reioysed / because
he had never been there before So he had letters delivered him / dyrected to
the king of England and to his uncles. Thus Robert departed fro Paris with
seven horses at the cost and charge of the french king / and rode till he
came to Boloyne / and there took the sea and aryued at Dover / and spedde so
in his iourneys that he came to Eltham and found the king there / and the
Duke of Lancastre / the earls of Salysbury / and Huntyngdon / and the lord
Thomas Percy / and for the honor of the french king he was well received /
and specially of the king who desired greatly to se him. Than he delivered his
letters of credence / which were read over by the king and the other lords.
The duke of Gloucestre was not the^ he was in Essex / at a Castle of his
called Plasshey. When this Robert had been with the king and with the duke of
Lancastre at Eltham a five days he departed thens to gose the duke of
Gloucestre / and so took leave of the king and of the lords and came to
London / and the next day rode fyftene mile fro London to a town called
Brendwode / and the next day to Plasshey / and there he found the duke and the
Duchess / and their children / who right goodly received him acordyng to his
degree. Than Robert delivered him his letters sent fro the french king. And
when the duke saw they were of credence / he drew this Robert a part / and
demanded what credence he had. Robert answered him and said / sir I shall
show therein to you at good leyser / I am not come to depart again so soon.
Well quod the duke ye be welcome. This Robert knew well enough that the duke
of Gloucestre was a sore dyslymulynge prince / and contrary to any peace / and
thought it hard to break him fro his opinyon / for he knew well he was
always contrary to the peace / which was well seen at the treaties at
Balyngham / for he never demanded but to have war. yet for all that Robert
the Hermyte spared not to speak to the duke on the form of peace. Always he
found the duke cold in aunswers / and said the matter lay not in him / for he
had two elder brethren / the duke of Lancastre and the duke of york / to
whom the matter partayned rather than to him / and also that if he would
consent thereto alone / peradventure the other lords / prelates / and
counsaylours of good towns / would not accept it. Well quod Robert the
Hermyte / for the love of our lord Ihesu Christ be ye not contrary to the
peace / for ye may do much / and also ye se well how the king your nephue
enclyneth to the peace / and will by marriage have the French kings daughter /
by which coniunctyon shall be great alyaunce of peace and love. Than the duke
answered and said. What though ye be believed and herd at this time / with the
kings and lords of both realms / and that ye have good audye^ce with them
and with their counsaylours / the matter is so high and weyghty / that it is
conuenyent that greater personages than ye / should me^le therewith / I have
told you / and often times I have said that I shall never be contrary to the
peace / so it be to the honor of the king and the Realm of England. In
time paste peace was taken between the king our father and our brother the
prince of Wales / and king Johan of France / and the french party sworn and
bound upon pain of sentence of the pope / and yet it held not / for the
frenchmen fraudulently have broken all couenauntes / and have taken again
possessyon of all the lands and lordeshyppes that were yielded and delivered at
the peace making / to our said sovereign lord and father / and to our
predecessors / and moreover of the so^me of.xxx. thousand frankes / that the
redempcyon mounted unto / there is yet to pay six hundred thousand frankes.
wherefore such matters (to remember) troubles sore our corages / and we and many
of this realm marueyle greatly how the king our sovereign lord / leans to
so young advise and counsel / and regards none otherwise the time passed /
and the time present / but enclineth to alye him by marriage with his adversary
/ and by that alyaunce dysheryte the Crown of England / and his successors
to come / of ye claim of France. Ah right dear lord quod Robert our lord
Jesus Christ suffered passion on the Cross for us all sinners / and pardoned
his death to them that crucyfied him: in likewise a man must pardon that will
come to the glory of heaven / and sir all yuell wylles / hates / and rancoures
were pardoned / the day that the peace was made and sealed at Calays by our
predecessors / and now wars have been a game newly renewed between your men
and ours / I think surely through fault on both parties / for when the
prince of Wales duke of Acquytayne was returned out of Spain in to Acquytayne
/ there were a certain manner of people calling themself companyons / whereof
the most party were english men and gascons / holding of the king of
England and of the prince of Wales. These people assembled them together and
entered in to the realm of France / without any tytell of reason / whereby
ensued mortal and eruell war greater than was before. These companyons
called the realm of France their chamber / they were so set to do yuell deeds
/ yt they could not be resysted. And when ye realm of France saw and felt
them so harmed by this people / and saw well the lengar they contynewed the
more they multyplyed and more hurt they did. than king Charles of France /
son to king Johan / was cou^sayled by his subgiettes to resyst and subdue
such enemies / outher by war or otherwise / and many great barons of
Gascoyne came to the french king / such as said they were sore ouerlayde with
their lord the prince of Wales / and many iniuryes done to the^ / which they
showed to the french king they might not nor Would not suffer no longer / and
so they began the war because of their resort to the prince of Wales. Than
this king Charles by counsel of them and of his subgiettes / enhardyed
himself to the war with these barons of Gascoyn / for to mete against these
companyons. And in this new war many lords returned to the french king /
and diverse lordeshyppes / cities / towns / and castles / for the great
oppression that the prince of Wales did to the^ / and consented to be done by
his co^myssioners. Thus the war was renewed / whereby many great myschyefes
have fallen / to the dystruction of much people and countries / and the faith
of Christ sore febled and decayed / and the enemies of god ryssen and coraged /
and have all ready conquered much part of Greece. the emperor of
Constantynople / has not the power to resyst the puyssau^ce of the great turk
/ called Basant Lamorabaquyn / who has conquered the realm of Armony /
except all only a town standing on the sea side / called Tourche / which
the venysians and genouoys keep against ye turk / and the emperor of
Constantyne the noble / who is of your blood / he was son to the emperor
Hugues of Luzignen and of my lady Mary of Burbon / cosyn germayne to my lady
the queen your mother / he shall not be able of long to resyst the puyssau^ce
of this great turk. and if peace may be had between England and France / as
I trust by the grace of god it shall be / than knights and squyers such as
demand for deeds of arms for their advancement / shall draw them to that
part / and shall help king Lion of Armony to recover again his heritage /
and to put out the turks. for surely the war has ouerlonge endured between
France and England / and surely who so ever it be that is or will be against
the peace shall derely answer thereto / outher quycke or deed. How know you
that quod the duke of Gloucestre? Sir quod Robert / all that I say comes by
dyuyne inspyracyon / and by a vysione that came to me upon the sea / as I
returned fro Baruch^ a port in Surey / beside the isle of Rodes. Than he
declared all his hole vysion / the rather thereby to move the dukes heart to
pytie and reason / but this duke was herd herted against the peace and kept
still his opynion / and by his words condemned and dispysed greatly the
french men / for all yt ever Robert the Hermyte could say. but because that
this Robert was a stranger / and showed by his words and works that he would
all were well / and also because the duke saw that the king his nephue
enclyned to have peace / he dyssymuled and spoke fair / what so ever his heart
thought. Two days this Robert tarried at plasshey with the duke and had good
chere / and the third day departed and returned to London / and fro thence to
Wyndesore / where the king made him good chere for love that the french king
had sent him thither / and because he was wise and eloque^t / and of sweet
words and honest. It is not to be doubted / but that the king demanded of
him how he found his uncle the duke of Glocestre. And Robert answered him
well to the point. The king knew well his uncle of Gloucestre enclyned rather
to war than to peace / wherefore he favored much better his other two uncles
dukes of Lancastre and york. when Robert the hermyte had been a month with the
king he took his leave / and at his departing the king gave him great gifts
/ and so did the dukes of Lancastre and york / and the earls of Huntyngdon and
Salysbury / and the lord Thomas Percy. The king caused him to be conveyed to
Dover / and there passed over in to France / and he found the french king
and the queen and his uncles at Paris / and there showed the king all his
voyage / and what good chere he had in England. Thus daily messangers went in
and out between these two kings / and amyable letters sent between them. the
king of England desired nothing so much as to come to this marriage / and
semblably the french king had like desire / for he thought his daughter
should be a great estate if she might be queen of England.

Of the delyueraunce of the lord de la River and of sir Johan le Mercyer / and
how they were put out of prisone. Cap. CC.v.
YE have herd here before how ye lord de la River and sir Johan le Mercyer /
were in ieoperdy of their lives / and removed fro prison to prison / and at
last delivered to the provost of the Chatelet of Paris / and were at the
point to lose their lives and all for hate and envy that the dukes of Berrey
and Burgoyne and their counsel had to them. They were in this danger more
than two year. The king socoured the^ / for always he stopped the execusion /
and that the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne saw well / and also they perceived
that the duke of Orlyaunce aided them as much as he might / also the duches of
Berrey was a good mean for them / and specially for ye lord de la River / and
also the one could not be condemned without the other / for they were accused
all for one cause. The prayers of good folks and their right together aided
them. Than it was regarded by many of the high barons of France who had
pytie on them / and said they had suffered prisonement ouerlonge / and that it
was time to show them grace / for this Johan le Mercyer had so much wept in
prison / yt his sight was sore decayed / so that he could scant se / the brute
ran through the realm that he was blind. Than at last they had sentence
given them of grace by the king / and there the lord de la River was restored
again to all his lands and castles / as ye fair castle of Aniou / but he
was charged on pain of his life that when he was ones in his castle of Aniowe
/ that he should never after repasse the river of Said without he were
commanded by the kings own mouth. And sir Johan le Mercyer to return to
Pou^te de Nonnon / in to his fair house in Laonnoys / and he not to repasse
the river of Oyse / of Marne / nor of Seyne / without he were in likewise
called by the kings own mouth. Thus they bound them self to take this
prisonment / and thought they had a great grace to escape so well / and were
right ioyouse when they were delivered fro the Chatelet. They trusted when they
came out of prison / to have spoken with ye king / and to have thanked him of
his grace / but they could not be suffered / but were commanded to avoid out
of Paris and to resort thither as they were commanded. Thus they were
delivered whereof their friends had great joy.

Of the peace that was had between the duke of Bretayne and sir Olyuer
Clysson. Cap. CC.vi.
yE have herd how the duke of Bretayne and sir Olyuer of Clisson warred long
together mortally / for between them they took none to mercy / and surely sir
Olyuer of Clysson and his party bare them so valyau^tly / that of three he had
twain / for the lords of Bretaygne dyssimnied with the duke / and men of the
cities and good towns said / how they must needs live and use their
marchaundyse / what so ever war was between the duke and sir Olyuer of
Clysson / for they said it touched them nothing / wherefore they would not
entermed^e between them but ever the Vycount of Rohan / the lord de Leo^ / and
the lord of Dignan / treated for a peace to be had between them. So much they
pursewed that the duke promised to be entreated / so that the might se sir
Olyuer in his presence / and speak with him. and thereupon these lords on a day
rode to a fortress of sir Olyuers to speak with him / and there they showed
him for what cause they we^ come thither / and how they had got grant of the
duke to send to him a safeconducte / safely to go and come to speak with him /
saying yt surely they thought if he were ones in his presence / all the yuell
will and displeasures should be clearly pardoned. Than sir Olyuer said. Sirs /
ye are all my friends and lovers / and I trust great lie in you / and believe
that the duke has promised as you say / and I think he would gladly se me in
his presence. But so good help me and saint yues / upon his word and promise
I ensure you / I will not ones issue out of my house. But I shall tell you what
ye shall say to him / that if he will have me to come to him / let him send
hyder in pledge his eldest son / and when he is here / than^e I will go and
speak with him / and such end as I shall make his son shall make. if I
return he shall do in likewise / and if I abide he shall abide. When these
lords saw they could have none other end / they took their leave and
returned to Wannes where the duke was / and showed every thing as they had
herd. The duke could have none other way. This sir Olyuer bare him self so
valyauntly in this war / that he wanne more than he lost. He took two times
all the dukes vessel and plate of gold and silver / and diverse other iewelles
/ whereof he had great profit.

The conclusyon of the war and hate between the duke of Bretayne and sir
Olyuer Clysson / was thus. The duke of Bretayne (like a great lord as he was)
saw well he could not come to his intent of sir Olyuer of Clysson / and that
he had over many friends in Bretayne / for saving their alegiau^ce to ye duchy
of Bretayne. All the bretons / knights / squyers / prelates / and men of the
good Cities and good towns / enclyned more to the lord Clysson than to the
duke. And the high barons dissymuled / and had answered the duke / that they
would not entremedle them with that war / but said they would gladly set a
peace and accord between the^ Also the duke of Orlyaunce specially conforted
covertly in many manner of ways sir Olyuer of Clysson / and he was always
joyous when he herd of his good speed / in any of his entreprices. The duke of
Bretaygne who was a subtyle prince and ymaginatyfe and had endured much pain
during this war / and saw well he was not very well beloved with his own
people / as the children of the lord Charles of Bretayne were / the one called
Charles of Bloyes / who was slain at the battle of Alroy / and John^ of
Bretayne earl of Ponthieur and of Lymogines / who had to wife the daughter of
sir Olyuer of Clisson / and the lord Henry of Bretayne his brother / and their
suster the queen of Naples and of Jerusalem. Also the duke saw that he began
to wax old / and that his children were but young / and perceived well he had
no friends in France / except the duke of Burgoyne and the duches his wife.
And he saw well his children should have as few for by their mothers side /
they came and were issued of the members and branches of Nauer / which
generation was not ouermoche loved in France / for the great myscheues yt
king Charles of Nauerre father to the duchess of Bretayne had done / in time
past in France / whereof the remembrance as than endured. And the duke saw
that if he dyed in that estate / both with sir Olyuer of Clisson and with the
earl of Ponthieur / he than douted that his children that were so young should
have over many great enemies. and also he saw that the alyaunce between him
and England began to wax cold / For he was informed that the king of
England should have to wife the daughter of France the same lady that was
promised to him for his son and heir. The duke did cast all these doutes.
Than^e all things considered / he ymagined to break his heart without
dissimulacion / and make a ferme peace with sir Olyuer of Clysson and with
Johan of Bretayne: And would put him self at their pleasure / to make
amends for all wrathes / forfaytes / and do^mages / that ever they did to him
or to his men / during the war. He would desire nothing but that they should
take him for duke of Bretayne / and his children after him / according to the
artycles of the peace before made / between him and the children of sir Charles
of Bloyes / which charter of peace he would not break nor any article
comprised therein. And also to keep and uphold every thing that he had promised
to John^ of Bloyes his cosyn / earl of Po^-Ponthieur. And if he had not his
part of the heritage of Bretayne suffycient / he would put the ordring
thereof without any dissymulacion to the vicount of Rohan / and to the lords of
Dignan / of Leon / of Lauall / and of Beaumont / and of the lord John^ of
Harpeden. When the duke of Bretayne had aduysed in him self all this purpose /
without making of any man of his counsel / He called to him his secratorie
and in a chabre they two alone / he caused him to write a letter to sir Olyuer
of Clysson / as swetely and amiably as could be devised / desyring him that
they might speak toguyder secretly / on trust to have good peace between the^.
When this Letter was made / devised / and sealed / Than he took a secret
person / co^maundyng him to go to the castle of Iosselyn / and say I do send
the to speak with my cosyn sir Olyuer of Clysson / and salute him fro me and
deliver him this letter and bring again an answer. And on pain of thy ly^e
keep this secret / and show no creature whider thou ghost / nor who does
send the. He took his journey and spedde him so well / that he ca^e to the
castle Iosselyn. The porters had marueyle when they herd him say that he cae
fro the duke of speak with their master. they went and showed their lord
thereof. Than he commanded that the messanger should come to him / and so he
did. And well and wisely declared his message / and delivered his letter
sealed with the dukes seal / which sir Olyuer knew right well / and opyned
and reed the letter two or three times / the better to understand it. And in
the redyng he had great marueyle of the sweet words / cretable / and amyable /
that was comprised in the letter. He studied a season / and at last said / how
he would take advise and write again. sir Olyuers men had great marueyle of
this / for before he had forborne no man of the dukes / but outher he was
slain or put in prisone. Than^e sir Olyuer went in to his lecrete chamber /
and began to muse and ymagyn upon these news: At last he apesed his yuell will
/ in that ye duke humyled himself so much toward him / and that he wrote so
swetely. yet he thought in him self to prove the duke further / or he
adventured him self to go to the duke / for he thought if he took any hurt /
no man would bewail him / if he lost him self by folly. Than he wrote a
letter to the duke right sweet and tretable / but the conclusyon was / that if
he would have him to come and speak with him / that he should send his son^e
and heir to lie in hostage for him / till his return. This letter was
delivered to the dukes varlet / who returned therewith to Wannes where the duke
was / and there delivered his letter. The duke reed it / and studied a little
and said. I shall do it / to the entence to treat louyngly with him. Than the^
duke wrote a letter to the vycount of Rohan / who was at the castle of Cayre /
When the vycount saw the dukes letter / he came incontinent to Wannes. Than
the duke showed all his purpose and entencyon. and said Vycount / you and the
lord of Mountbursier shall lead my son^e to the castle Iosselyn and leave
him there / and bring with you the lord Olyuer Clysson / for I will agree and
make peace with him. The vicou^t said it should be done gladly. So they took
the dukes son and heir / who was about the age of eight year / and led him
to ye castle Iosselyn / to the lord Olyuer Clysson / who received them right
honorably. And when he saw the child and the good affection of the duke / he
humyled and apesed his heart greatly: and with that the knights told him and
said. sir / ye se the good will of the duke / he has spoken nothing but his
heart does agree to the same. I se it well quod sir Olyuer / and for that I se
and perceive his good will / I shall put me so farforthe / that I shall yield
me under his obeysaunce. And it seems ye be right nere to him / seeing he
puts his affiaunce and trust in you / to deliver you his heir to bring to
me to lie in hostage / till I be returned. I wotte not / if he have showed you
what he has written to me / sygned and sealed with his seal. The lords
answered and said. Sir / he has well told us / that he has right great
desire to come to a peace and accord with you. In this ye may right well
believe us / we be of your blood. Than^e sir Olyuer went for the letters that
the duke had sent him / and reed them. Sir quod they / all that is contained in
this letter he has said unto us / and upon the same estate he has sent us
hyder. Than sir Olyuer ordaygned him to depart with the said lords / and took
the dukes son again with them and said / how they should bring again the
child to his father / saying that he trusted right well his promise /
co^sydring that he had proved him so far / and that he had showed such
humilyte: He douted not but that his heart was in unity. So they came to
Wannes. The duke had appointed that sir Olyuer should tarry at a Freres without
the town of Wannes / and there the duke should come and speak with him: as it
was ordained so it was done. and when the duke saw that sir Olyuer had brought
again his son and heir / he reputed if for a great curtesy / and was well
content therwt. Thus the duke and sir Olyuer met in the Freres / and there
they two alone entered in to a chamber / and co^muned toguyder a season / and
after issued out through a gardeyn and came to the river side / and there they
entered in to a boat / and fro thens entered in to a ship that lay at ancre.
And so when they were far of fro all people / they co^muned a long season
toguyder. What their words were I know not / but their dealing was as I
shall show you.

THeir men had went they had been still in the Freres / but as it was showed
me / they were thus in the ship more than two hours / and there made a good
peace between them / and swear faith and troth each to other without
dissymulacyon. Than they called again ye boteman / and he brought them again
where he had them / and so entered again by the gardeyne side in to the Freres.
Than anon after the duke ca^e out and led sir Olyuer of Clysson by ye hand
and so went in to the town of Wannes / and in to the castle called le Mote.
Of this peace every man was greatly reioysed / and to se them so amiably
together / and so was all the country. At the making of this peace John^ of
Bloyes earl of Ponthieur lost not / for his revenues was thereby augmented of
twenty thousand crowns of gold by year for ever to him and to his heirs.
And at this peace a marriage was ordained for ye duke of Bretaynes daughters /
to confyrme the better the love and alyaunces between them / great news ran
through France and England of this peace.

ye have herd here before / how sir Peter of Craon fell in the french kings
displeasure and of the duke of Orlyaunce / because of sir Olyuer of Clysson /
in that he would have slain him on a night as he went to his house ward: and
how the duke of Bretayne sustained him in his house / by which occasyon the
french king would have made warr^ against the duke / if the sickness that
took him had not been / by which incydentes the kings army brake up. and
also ye have herd how the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne bare great displeasure
/ to all such as counsayled the king thereto: As sir Olyuer of clysson / the
lord de la River / the lord Johan le Mercyer / Montague and other / who
afterward endured thereby great prisonment: and how the two dukes had the
governance of the realm / as long as the king was in his sickness. also it
has been showed what mortal war was between the duke of Bretaygne and sir
Olyuer of Clysson: and also how the lords de la River / sir Johan Mercyer /
and Montague were delivered out of prisone / which Montague had not so much
trouble as the other had / for as soon as the king was returned to his health /
he took Mo^tague again about him and made his excuse. So by reason of these
so^drie sickenesses that the king had diverse times / greatly troubled the realm
of France / and much abated the kings puissaunce / so that he had not every
thing done accordyuge to his will. In this season sir Peter of Craon was
nothing displeased with the kings sickness / nor with the trouble that they
of his counsel had / how be it than he made suit to return again in to
the kings favor and love / and the duke of Burgoyne and the lord Guy of
Tremoyle were his advocates to treat for him. And lightly his peace had been
made / and the duke of Orlyaunce had not ben / for he let all that treaty /
for as long as the hate eudured between sir Olyuer Clysson and the duke of
Bretaygne / sir Peter of Craon could come to no peace nor accord. but wha^ it
was surely known that there was a peace made between the duke and sir Olyuer /
tha^ the quarrel against sir Peter of Craon was molyfied and well apeased. The
same season queen Jane of Naples and Jerusalem and duches of Aniou / had a
plee in parlyament against sir Peter of Craon / for ye so^me of a. C.M.
fra^kes. this lady lay still at Paris / the better to entende to her business.
sir Peter of Craon yt saw him self in yt danger and that he was in suit in
the perlyament / and knew not how his business should pass / outher with
him or against him / for the ladies party was strong / and had good proof of
whom he had received the money / in the days of king Loyes her husband. All
these things co^sydred / he ymagyned yt it was not easy for him to bear. and
also he knew well he was in hate with the french king and with the duke of
Orlyaunce / but the duke and duchess of Burgoyne comforted and aided him
asmoche as they might. He gate such grace that he was at Paris secretly / in
the house of Arthoys with the duches of Burgoyne.

Now we shall leave to speak of him at this time.

How the king of Hungry wrote to the French king the state of the great
turk / and how John^ of Burgoyn eldest son to the duke of Burgoyne was
chief and heed of the army that went thider. Cap. CC.vi.
IN this said season / Henry king of Hu^gry sent sweet and amyable letters to
ye french king / by a notable ambassade a bishop and.ii. knights of Hungry.
In the same letters was contained a great part of ye state and doing of the
great turk / and how that he had sent word to the king of Hungry / yt he
would come and fight with him in ye mids of his realm and would go fro thens
to the city of Rome / and would make his horse to ear otes upon the high
auter of saint Peter / and there to hold his see imperyall / and would bring
the emperor of Constantyne the noble in his company / and all the great barons
of the realm of Greece / and each of the^ to keep still their own law / for
he desired nothing but the tytell and signorie. Thus the king of Hu^gry in his
letters / prayed the French king to entende to aid and socour him / and that
this business in far countries might he publisshed abroad / to thentent that
all knights and squyers might provide to come in to Hungry / to resyst against
Lamorabaquy the great turk / to thentent yt Christendom should not be
violated by him / and that his pride and bost might be abated. In these letters
were conteygned many words of great love / as kings and cosyns write each to
other in case of necessyte. And they were sent by suffycient personages / who
did so much / that the French king enclyned his heart thereto / and was the
gladder to set forward the treaty of ye marriage of his daughter / to the
king of England. Than anon these news of Hungry were publysshed abroad /
and written in to many countries / to move the hertes of gentylmen / knights
and squiers / such as would auaunce them to get honor. The same season that
these news were brought to the king / there was at Paris the duke of Burgoyne
and the duchess / and Johan of Burgoyne their son and heir earl of Neuers /
who as than was no knight and the lord Guye of Tremoyle and the lord Wyllyam
his brother / and many lords and other of the realm of France. Than the duke
of Burgoyne enclyned sore to this viage / and specially that his son^e should
enterprice the said voyage / so he might be chief heed and leader of the army /
that should go in that viage. This Johan of Burgoyne was but a young man / of
the age of.xxii. years / Wise / curtesse / tretable / humble / and well-beloved
of knights and squyers of Burgone / and of other nacyons / such as knew him.
He had to wife the daughter of duke Aubert of Bauier / earl of Heynalte /
Hollande / and zela^de / a good lady / wise and devout: and had two children
full lykely to come to great maryages. One showed this Johan of Burgoyne how
the French king would send him in this voyage in to Hungry / to se what he
would say. Than he said / if it pleace the king and the duke my father to
send me as chief of this army / it shall please me right well / for I have
great desire to auaunce my self. well sir quod they / ye were best to speak
with the duke your father that he may speak to the king / for without his
good will ye can do nothing.

IT was not long after / but that this Johan of Burgoyne spoke to his father /
prayeng him humbly to consent yt he might go in this voyage in to Hungry / and
at the same time there was by him sir Guye and sir Wyllyam of Tremoyle / and
other / and they said to the duke. Sir / this request that your son makes is
but reasonable / for it is time he take the order of knighthode / and more nobly
he can not take it / than in going the journey against the enemies of holy
Church. And it the king will send any personage in that voyage / he can not
send a more honorable man / than^e his own cosyn germayne your son: and ye
shall se many knights go with him / as well for their own auau^cementes as
for your love. Than the duke said well / so be it. I shall not let the good
will of my son / I shall speak to the king therein / and shall se what answer
he will make. And anon after the duke spoke to the king therein / and the
king incontinent enclyned thereto and said / how it should be well done that
he went / and we will that he shall go / and we will make him as chief of that
journey. Than ye tidings was showed through all Paris and without / that
Johan of Burgoyne with a great company of knights / should go in to Hungry to
se the puyssaunce of the great Turk. and that journey atchyued / thanne the
Christen men to go to Consta^tyne the noble / and to pass over the arm or
saint George / and so to enter in to Surrey / and to deliver Jerusalem out of
the panyms hands. Than awaked such knights and squyers as desired
advancement. When the duke of Burgoyne saw that his son should go in this
voyage / and that he should be chief of the army / he honored than the more
the ambassadors of Hungry / who when they saw the kings good will / the
dukes and the Frenchmens / they were glad / and took their leave of the king
and of the other lords of France / and so returned to their country / and
made relacyon to ye king of Hungry how they had spedde / wherewith the king
was greatly reioysed / and made great prouisyon against the coming of the
French men / and sent these ambassadors to his brother the king of Almaigne
to open his passages / and also to his cosyn the duke of Austriche / for
through the straytes of Austryche he must needs pass: And by all the ways
he caused great prouisyon of vitayle to be ordained. And also he wrote letters
to the great master of Pruce / and to the Rhodes. Certifyeng them of the
coming of Johan of Burgoyne / with a thousand knights and squiers of valyant
men / to the intent to enter in to Turkey / and to resyst the great bost of
king Basant / called the great turk.

IN this season the lord Coucy was come to Paris / and was but newlye
returned fro a voyage / where he had been a hole year / which was on the
fronters of Ge^nes. And there were certain great men genowayes / that had
informed ye duke of Orlyaunce / that the hoole Duchy of Geane / desired to have
to their chief lord some noble person / descended of the lynage of the flour
delyce. And for as much as the duke of Orlyaunce had wedded the daughter of
the lord of Myllaygne / and that the land and duchy of Geane should be right
mete for him / at the duke of Orlyaunce instaunce / the lord of Coucy with
three hundred spears and five hundred cross bows / passed over in to Sauoye and
to Pyemont / by the accord and consent of the earl of Sauoye / and came in to
Aste in Pyemont by the consent of the lord of Myllayne / and came to a city
called Alexandria / and so came to the fronters and marchesse of the genowayes
/ and there fell in treaty with them to know more plainly their ente^cyons /
for perforce he could do nothing / without he had had greatier puissaunce than
he had. And when the lord of Coucy came first upon the fronters of the river
of Geane / where the entrees are strong to conquer: if there be made any
defense. Some lords of the genowayes such as favored the lord Coucy / and
had informed the duke of Orlyaunce / whereby he sent thither the lord of Coucy.
They entreated him amiably and brought him to their countries / and offered to
him their castles. The lord of Coucy who was sage / subtyle / and ymaginatyfe
/ and knew right well the nature of the lombardes and genowayes / would not
trust them ouermoche / nor have to great confydence in their offers and
promyses / but always wisely he held them in love and amyte / as long as he
was among them / and led them forth with fair words and treaties. They
had many co^munycacyons in the field toguyder / but never in no fortress / and
ever the more he comuned with them / the less he conquered or gate. the
genouoys made to him sign of love and promised him many things / and would
have had him to have gone in to the city of Gennes or to Port Vender / but
the lord of Coucy durst never assure him in their offers. The conclusyon of
his voyage was such that he gate nothing / and when he saw that he could
not atcheue his business / he signyfied his estate to the duke of Orlyance /
whereupon he was remaunded and so he returned to Paris / and came thither the
same season that all the business was for the journey going in to Hungery.
The duke of Burgoyne reioysed greatly of his return / and he and duchess
sent for him to their house of Arthoyse in sign of great love / than they
said to him. Sir we trust much in you / we have caused Johan our son and
heir to take on him an enterprise in ye honor of god and of all christendom
/ and we know well that above all other knights of France / ye are the most
used and expert in all things / wherefore derely we require you that ye would
be companion with our son in this voyage / and his chyefe counsaylour /
whereof / we shall thank you / and deserve it to you and yours. Than the lord
of Coucy said / my lord and you madame / your words and requests ought to be
to me a commandment / in this voyage I shall go if it please god for two
causes. First for devotion to defend the faith of Ihesu Christ. Secondly in
that ye do to me somoche honor / as to give me charge of my lord Johan your
son / and I shall acquyte me truly to him to my power / how be it of this
deed ye may well dyscharge me / and to charge specially his cosyn and nere
kynesman / my lord Phylyppe of Arthoys earl of Ewe and constable of France /
and his other cosyn the earl of March / both two ought / to go with him in
this voyage for they be both nere of his blood. Than the duke said. My lord of
Coucy / ye have much more seen than these other twayn have and know better
the ordering of an army in strange countries / than outher our cosyn of Ewe
or of March / therefore we charge you and pray you to execute our requests.
Than he answered and said my lord / your prayer is to me a commandment /
and I shall do it / sithe it pleases you / with the aid and help of my lord
Guye of Tremoyle and of my lord Guillyam his brother / and of the admyrall of
France. Of this answer the duke and duchess had great joy.

THese lords prepared them selves to go in this journey into Hu^gery / and
lords / knights / and squyers were desired to go in their company / and many
desired themself to go. Some were retaygned / and some went without masters /
and some considering the voyage in to Hungery / and fro thence in to Turkey to
be over long / and chargeable for them / being not retaygned / waxed cold in
their enterprise. For the setting forward of this young Johan of Burgoyne /
nothing was spared / horse / harness / fresshe clothes / rich vessel / and
plate of gold and silver / and officers appointed to do their atendau^ce / and
money delivered and work / men paid. Than all barons / knights / and
squiers / for the honor of John^ of Burgoyne and also for the auauncement of
their bodies / enforced them to make them ready. The lord Phylyppe of Arthoys
ordained him so puyssauntly that nothing was spared / and would go in that
voyage as Constable of France. And the french king who loved him entierlye /
helped him much toward his charges / and so he did to the lord Boucyquant
marshall of France. The duke of Burgoyne considered that this voyage of his
sons should cost ouermoche fynaunce / and he thought it conuenyent that the
state of his son should be mayntayned / and to find silver to maintain it
withal / he found out subtelly a back tail / for by a former tail all the
countries / cities / and fortresses had been tayled. And the said back tail
mounted in Burgoyne of the chyuallry / six hundred thousand crowns of gold.
And again / the duke made it to be told to all knights and ladies that held
of him in fee / young and old / that they should go in to Hungery in their
own propre persons with his son / or else to pay a tax of silver. so they
were taxed some at a thousand pound the other at five hundred frankes / and
each man after his goods and valor of his lands. Ladies and ancient
knights remembringe the traueyle of their bodies / and were not shapen nor
made to endure such pain / conpou^ded and paid at the will of the Duke. The
young knights and squyers were forborne payeng of any money. but it was said
to them that they should go with the lord Johan / at their own cost and
charge / and otherwise not. Of this back tail the duke raised.lx. thousa^de
crowns / and so none was forborne.

THe tidings of this voyage spredde abroad / and when it came in to the
country of Haynalt / knights and squyers / such as desired auauncement spoke
together and said. A this were a mete voyage for my lord of Ostrenant / who
is young and for his brother the earl of Neuers / and if any of them went we
might well go in their company. The earl of Ostrenant being at that time at
Quesnoy / understood what the knights and squyers of his country said / and
he thought no less tha^ they did / and had great affectyon to go in this
voyage. and when he herd any spekyng of that matter / he would answer but
little / but dyssymuled the matter / but he was in good entencyon to speak with
duke Aubert of Bauyer earl of Haynalt / and to do as he would counsel him.
Within a while after the Earl of Ostrenant came in to Hay in Holande / where
his father was with the duchess his wife. Than he said to his father. my lord
/ such tydinges rynneth abroad that my fair brother of Neuers has
enterprised this so^mer to go into Hungery / and fro thens in to Turkey /
whereby all lykelyhode great deeds of arms shall be atchyued. and sir / as at
this time I wotte not where better to enploye myself in any deed of arms /
wherein I would gladly know your pleasure. I would go in that honorable
voyage with a hundred knights / and bear company with my fair brother / the
duke of Burgoyne and my lady the duches shall can me great thank / and many
knights and squyers of Haynalt will gladly hold me company. Than duke Aubert
/ as a man ready purueyed of answer said. Guylliam / what haste or will have
you to go in this voyage in to Hungery and in to Turkey / to seek arms upon
people and country that never did us any forfeyte / thou have no tytell of
reason to go / but for the vayneglory of the world. Let Johan of Burgoyne
and our cosins of France do their enterprise / and do thy deeds aparte / and
go thou in to Frese and conquer our heritage that these fresones by pride and
rudenes do witholde fro us / and will come to none obeysaunte / and to do this
I shall aid the. The words of the father to the son lyghtened greatly the
heart of therle of Ostrenant / who answered and said. My lord ye say well /
and if it please you that I shall do that voyage / I shall do it with right a
good will.

How the earl of Ostrenant enterprised to go in to Frese. Cap. CC.vii.
THese words between the father and the son multyplyed so much little and
little / that the voyage in to Frese was taken and enter prised / and one
thing helped much the matter forward / and that was. The earl of Ostrenant
had at that time about him and nere of his counsel a squire of Haynalte /
called Ferebrase / otherwise called the bastard Vertayne a wise man and a
subtle in feats of arms / so that when he herd of this he said to the earl.
Sir my lord your father speaks well / it is better for your honor that ye /
make this voyage rather than in to Hungery / and ordain you thereto / and ye
shall find knights and squyers of Haynalt and elsewhere that will be glad to
keep you company / and shall aid you to their powers to do this enterprise.
and if ye have mind thus to do / I will counsel you to go in to England /
and to signyfy your enterprise to the knights and squyers there / and pray the
king of England your cosyn / that he will give license to knights / squyers
/ and archers to go with you in to Frese / at your wages / englysse men be men
of deeds / and if ye have them ye shall do your business the better. And if ye
may have by prayer your cosyn therle of Derby in your company / your voyage
shall be much the fayrer / and your enterprise the more renomed. The earl
enclyned to those words / for it seemed to him that his counsel was good. In
likewise the lord Gomegynes gave him counsel / and so did diverse other.
These words anon spredde abroad in Haynalte. Than there was acommaundement
made to all knights and squiers in Heynalt / that none of them should go out
of the country / to go in to Hungrey nor in to no place else / because the earl
of Ostrenant should ocupy them another way / and should lead them in to
Frese. We shall leave speaking of this business / and return to the voyage
in to Hungery.

THus knights and squiers in many parties had cause to awake / and to take
courage / for ye wars that were toward in that season / as well for the
voyage in to Hungery as in to Frese. The earl of Neuers auaunced his journey /
and all knights and Squyers were named and written that should go with him /
provision was great and well ordained / and for that he would be renomed in
this voyage he was lyberall and mad great larges to many knights and squyers
that should go in his band / for the voyage was long and costely / wherefore it
was needful for the^ to have some aid toward their charges / and the other
lords as the constable of France / and the earls of Ewe and March / the
lords Henry and Phylippe of Bare / the lord of Coucy / the lord Guy of
Tremoyle / the lord Johan Vyen admyrall of France / Boucyquant marshall of
France / and Raynolde du Roy / the lords of saint Powle / of Mutterell / and
of saint Pie / the Hasell of Flaunders / the lord Loys of Brese his brother /
le Bourge of Montquell and other / they were to the nombre of a thousand
knights and a thousand squyers / and all valiant men. Every man departed fro
their own houses about the mids of march / and so rode forth by companyes /
and always they found the ways open / for the king of Almayne had
commanded through all his realm of Almayne and Boesme / that they should have
all things necessary / and that no vytayle should be witholden fro them. These
lords of France thus rode forward / to the aid of the king of Hungery / who
should have battle with the great turk / puyssaunce against puyssaunce / the
twenty day of the month of May. These lords passed Lorayne: the county of
Bare / the county of Mountbelyart / and the duchy of Burgoyn / and entered into
Ausay / and passed the country and the river of Ryn^^^ many places / and the
county of Fierte / and so entered in to Austriche / which is a great country
and the entres and issues strong / and great deserts. but they went with so
good will and courage / that pain and traueyle grieved them nothing. The duke of
Austriche made capytaynes in his country / such as made the lords good chere
/ and specially to John^ of Burgoyne / who was chief of that army. All these
lords were appointed to assemble in a city in Hungery called Bode. Now let us
speak of other matters.

yE have herd here before / how the king of England had sent in the same
season suffycient ambassade to the french king and to his counsel to have to
his wife Isabell the daughter of France / which ambassadors were / the
archebysshop of Duuelyn / the bishop of Wynchester / the earl Marshall / the
earl of Rutlande / son to the duke of york / the lord Henry Clyfforde / the
lord Beamonde / the lord Spenser and many other. the french king had made
them good chere / and all his uncles and counsayls / which ambassade were
returned in to England upon good hope to atayne to their desires. The king
of England for his part all the winter following / often times sent to the
french king / consernynge the said matters / who was well enclyned to have
peace / and to have end of the war / which had over long endured. These
pursutes and treaties took such effect / and the two kings had written so
solemply each to other / that their matters drew nere to apoynte / so that
such ambassadors as were first sent out of England in to France / were than
sent again and came to Paris / and were lodged at the cross of Tyroner / and
their men in the streat there about. They were to the nombre of six hundred.
Thus they soiourned at Paris more than three wekes.

Of the judgment made in the parlyament for the queen of Napoles against sir
Peter of Craone. Cap. CC.ix.
THe same seasone that the English men were at Paris / queen Jane duches of
Aniowe / who wrote her self queen of Napoles and of Iherusalem was at Paris
and pursued dylygently her business. She was a lady of great courage / she
pleted in parlyament for two causes. The first was for the heritage of the
county of Roussey against the Earl of Brain / for Loys the duke of Aniou her
lord and husband had bought it and paid for it / to a lady that was
countess of Roussey / sometime wife to the lord Loys of Namure / but
afterward she was deuorsed fro him for a reasonable cause / as it was said.
The second suit this queen had was against sir Peter of Craon / she demanded
of him the so^me of a hundred thousand frankes / which she was ready to prove
that he had received it in the name of his lord and master / Loys king of
Napoles / Cysyll / and Iherusalem her husband / which money was delivered him
to have paid in to Powell / and or it was paid he herd how his said master
my husband was deed. Than he iourneyed no further / but returned again in to
France / and kept still the said so^me of money to his own profit / and
never made acompte to the said queen thereof / nor to her children Loys and
Charles / but spente and wasted the money in pride and bobbans. The queen laid
to his charge that for fault of payment of the said money / the realm of
Napoles was lost and conquered by Margarete of Duras / and by the heirs of
the lord Charles de la Paix / by reason that such soudyours as her husband
had to maintain his wars in Puell and Calabre / were not paid their wages /
whereby many turned to the Earl of saint Seuyre and to Margarete of Duras / and
other departed and left the wars. All these causes were put in to the
Parlyament chamber at Paris / where all causes were preposed / showed and
demanded / and all the defenses and aunsweres herd on all parties. Their plee
had endured the space of three years. And though sir Peter of Craon were absent
fro the parlyament / yet his advocates defended his cause / and said though he
had recyued the said so^me in the name of his lord and master / yet his
master was as much bound to him as that so^me came to and more for the good
service that he had done to him. This plee had endured so long that it was
necessary to have a conclusyon / and the lady made importunate sewte to have
judgment. The lords of the parlyament consydred all things / and said they
would give no judgment / without both parties were present / and sir Peter of
Craon durst not well apere in Paris / because of the Kings dyspleasure / and
the duke of Orlyance / for the offense that he had done to sir Olyuer of
Clysson constable of France / and without he were present / they would give no
sentence defynityue / where upon the said lady pursewed to set him clear in
France / and by her means he was pardoned / so that he might ride and go
where he list without any danger / except the suit that was between her and
him for the said so^me of money. So he was clearly dyscharged of all other
charges / and lords and ladies made him good chere / I wot not whether it
were by dissymulacyon or otherwise. thus he was again at Paris / holding as
great estate as ever he did. The same time he was appointed to be one of them
to receive and bring the english ambassadors to the king / for he was a
knight that had seen much / and knew much honor. Than the day was
prefyxed that the judgment concerning the queen's matters should be determined
/ at which day there were present in the parlyament / great nombre of the
lords of France / to the intent that the matters should be the more autentyke.
There was the queen of Cicyll and Iherusalem / and her son Charles prince of
Thaurent / and Johan of Bloys / called Johan of Bretaygne earl of Ponthyeure
and of Lymogynes / and the dukes of Orlyaunce / Berrey / Burgoyne / and Burhone
/ and the earl of Brain / and the bishop of Laon. And before them the lady
was herd to lay her tytell for the county of Roussey. And on the other part
there was sir Peter of Craon and many of his lygnage. First judgment was
given for the countye of Roussey / and that was / the heritage was remyssed and
judged in to the hands and possessyon of the earl of Brain / and to the
heirs that should dyscende of the right branch of Roussey / reserved that
the queen should have again repayed to her all the money that king Loys her
husband had paid to the countess of Roussey last deed. Of this judgment
the enherytours of the county of Roussey / to whom the heritage pertayned
thanked greatly the lords of the parliament. Than such as were ordained to
give the second sentence arose up and said how that by the sentence of the
parlyament / sir Peter of Craon ought to pay to the queen of Napoles duchess
of Aniowe the sum of a hundred thousand frankes in ready money / or else his
body to go to prysone till she were contented and satysfyed. Of this judgment
the said lady thanked the lords of the parlyament^ and in contynent at the
co^playnte of the lady / hands was laid on him by the kings commandment /
and so was led to the castle of Loure / and there surely kept. So the
lords departed fro the parlyament. Thus these two judgments were given by
the princypall occasyon of this lady / duchess of Aniou.

Of the conclusyon of the marriage taken at Paris between the king of England
and Isabell eldest daughter to the french king / and how the duke of
Lancastre remaryed. Cap. CC.x.
THe ambassadors of England / were with the french king at Paris a xxii.
days and they had as good chere as could be devised / and their matters took
such effect / that it was agreed that the king of England should have in
marriage Isabell the eldest daughter of king Charles / and by virtue of
procuracyon / the earl Marshall fyaunced and espoused her in the name of the
king of England / and so she was called fro thens forth queen of England.
And as I was enfourmed it was a goddly sight to se her behauour / for all that
she was but young right plesauntly she bare the port of a queen* Than all this
matter concluded / the english men took their leave of the french king and
of the queen / and of their daughter queen of England / and of all other
lords / and so departed fro Paris and returned to Calays / and so in to
England. The King and other of his opinion were glad of their return. But
who so ever was glad of that marriage / the duke of Gloucestre uncle to the
king made no joy there of / for he saw well that by reasone of that marriage
and alyaunce / peace should be between the kings and their realms / which
grieved him / without it should be greatly to the honor of the king and the
realm of England / and that the English men might be in the same case or
better in the parties of Gascoyne / as they were or the wars renewed again.
And of this matter he would often times speak with his brother the duke of
york and drew him as much as he could to his opynions / for he was but a
soft prince / but to the Duke of Lancastre his eldest brother he durst not
speak over largely / for he saw well he was of the kings opynion / and was
well pleased with the Kings marriage / princypally for the love of his two
daughters / the queen of Spaygne and the queen of Portugale. The same season
the duke of Lancastre remaryed again the third time / to a lady daughter to
knight in Haynalte / called sir Paon of Ruette / he had been in his time with
noble queen Phylyp of England / who was of the nacyon of Haynalt she was
called Katheryn / and was brought up in her youth in the duke of Lancasters
house / with the duchess Blaunce of Lancastre / And after the death of this
lady Blaunce / the duke married the lady Custaunce of Spaygne / and in her days
the duke kept to his concubyne this lady Katheryne of Ruet / who had married
a knight of England / who was as than deed / and the duke had by her three
children / two sons and a daughter / the eldest called Johan / otherwise
lord Beauforde of Lancastre / the duke loved him entyerly / the other was
called Thomas / the duke brought him up at Asque / he was a good clerk and
conning in both laws / he was a great iuryst and legyst / and was after
bishop of Lyncolne. The duke of Lancastre for the love he had to his
children / he wedded their mother the lady Katheryn of Ruet / whereof there was
much marueyle both in England and in France / for she was but of a base
lynage / in regard to the two other wives. And when the knowledge of the
marriage of the duke to this lady Kateryne of Ruet was come to the great ladies
of England / as the duchess of Gloucestre / the countess of Derby / the
countess of Arundell / and other ladies dyscended of the blood royal of
England / they meruayled much / and laid great blame to the duke for that deed
/ and said / how the duke of Lancastre was greatly to dysprayse / to mary his
concubyne / for by reason thereof she should be the second person in honor in
England / whereby they said the queen should be shamefully acompanyed / and
said how surely they would not come in to no place where she should be
present / and more over they said / it should be a great shame for them /
that such a duchess come of so base a blood (and concubyne to the duke in his
other wyfes days) should go and have the preemynence before them / they said
their hertes should break for sorrow. both the duke of Gloucestre and the
duchess his wife spoke of this matter / and said how the duke of Lancastre was
not wise / but foul ouersene to marry his concubyne / and said they would
never do her honor / nor call her suster. The duke of york passed it over
lightly enough / for he was ever lightly resydente about the king and with
the duke of Lancastre. The duke of Gloucestre was of a another manner / for he
set by no man / though he were youngest brother / he was orgulous and
presumptuous of manner / and thereto be enclyned his nature / and always against
the kings opynions and his counsaylours. Thus this lady Kateryne of Ruet was
duchess of Lancastre / and was as the second person in England / and was
much about the king / as she that knew much honor / for in her youth and
all her days she had been brought up therein / and the Duke loved greatly the
children that he had by her / and that he showed well in his life and after his
death.

YE have herd here before how judgment of the parliament was given against
sir Peter of Craon / and how he was condemned in a hundred thousand frankes
/ to be paid to the Queen of Napoles. When the said sir Peter saw how he
was condemned he was sore abashed / for outher he must pay the so^me / or
else abide still prisoner. Than he was counsayled by the duke of Burgoyne and by
the duchess / yt he should require the young queen of England to be mean for
him to the queen of Napoles / that he might be released out of prysone fyftene
days to go abroad in Paris / to sewe to his friends to pay his fynau^ce / or
else to find sureties for him till he might go in to Bretaygne to gather among
his friends the same so^me. So at the desire of the young queen of England /
the queen of Napoles was content that he should go all the day abroad in Paris
/ and at night always to yield himself prisoner in to the castle of Lowre /
and there to remain all the night. After this rate he went abroad and sewed to
many of his blood and friends / but he could find none that would abide there
prisoner for him / the so^me was so great. And at the end of the fyftene days
he was feign to return prisoner both day and night / and was kept streyghter
than he was before at his cost and charge.

Now let us a little speak of the journey of therle of Neuers and the lords
of France / and what they did the same so^mer in Hungery. And after we shall
speak of the going in to Frese of the earl of Haynalte and the earl of
Ostrenaunt. The earl of Neuers and his company / with many valiant men that he
had of France and of other countries / when they were come in to Hungery in to
a great city called Bode / the king of Hungery made them good chere / and well
they deserved it / for they were come far of to se him. The entensyon of the
king was / that or he set forward with his puyssaunce / and with the aid
of France to enter in to the field / to here first some news fro the great
turk called Lamorabaquy / who had sent him word in the month of February
that surely he would be in Hungery or the end of the month of May / and that
he would pass the water of Dunce / of which message many had great marueyle.
And some said that there is in a manner nothing but that man may do it /
considering that the turk is valiant and puyssau^t / and desires much
deeds of arms therefore sithe he has said it by all lykelyhode he will do it /
and if he pass not the Dunce to come hither to this side / than let us pass
over and enter in to Turkey with puyssau^ce / for the king of Hungery with
such aid as he has of strangers / shall well make an hundred thousand men
/ and such a nombre of such men are well able to conquer all Turkey / and to
go in to the empire of Perce / and if we may have one journey of vyctory upon
the great turk / we shall do after what we list and shall conquer Surey / and
all the holy land of Iherusalem / and shall deliver it fro the hands of the
Sudden and the enemies of god / for at the so^mer next coming / the French
king and the king of England / who will conioyne together / shall reyse up a
great nombre of men of arms and of archers and shall find the passages open
to receive them / than nothing shall abide before us / but all shall be
conquered and put in our obeysaunce / when we shall go all together. Thus
devised the French men that were in the realm of Hungery.

When the month of May was come trusting to here tidings of Lamorabaquy the
great Turk / the king of Hungery sent to the passages of the river of Dunce
/ and sent through out his realm to assemble his puissaunce together / and the
lords of the Rodes came to him strongly / and all the month of May they
tarried for the coming of the sarazyns / but no tidings could be herd of
them. Than the king of Hungery sent such as knew the country beyond the
river of Dunce / to search to have so^me tidings of the great turk. Such as
went sertched all the country beyond the Brase of saint George / and to the
marches of Alexaundre / of Damas / and Antyoche / but they could here no news
of Lamorabaquy nor of none army toward. Than they returned and showed the
king what they had herd and seen. Than the king assembled his counsel / and
called the lords of France / who desired to do deeds of arms. The king
showed them how he had sent men in to Turkey to have knowledge what his
enemies did / and how they could here no tydinges of Lamorabaquy / nor no
lykelyhode of his aprochyng / for all ye promise he had made to pass the
Dunce / and to enter in to Hu^gery to sight with the Christian men or mydde May
should pass / wherefore the king demanded what counsel they would give him
to do. Than the lord of Coucy for all the other / said. Sir though Lamorabaquy
come not forward acordynge to his promise / and makes but a ^ape thereof /
yet that ought not to let us to do deeds of arms / and to pursue our enemies
/ seeing we be assembled to yt purpose. Thus all the frenchmen / almayns / and
other strangers showed well how they had great desire to seek out Lamorabaquy
to fight with him / which was to their great honor. The lord of Coucyes
words were affyrmed by all the strangers / it was all their opynyons how
they could enploye their season and time no better. Than it was ordained by
the king and by his marshalles that every man should prepare himself to be
ready to set forward at a day assygned / which was the vtas of saint Johan
the baptyst. Than officers and other servants aparelled for their masters
all things necessary / and the French men thinking to be fresshe and gay /
spared nouther Gold nor silver. Their departure fro Bode the soueraygne city
of Hungery was goodly to regard. The constable of Hungery had the vowarde with
a great nombre of hungaryons and almayns with him / because he knew the
countries. And next after him rode the french men with the constable of
France / the earl de la March / the lord of Coucy / sir Henry and sir
Phylyppe of Bare and diverse other. And with the king rode the great lords of
his country / as reasone was / and beside the king rode Johan of Burgoyne /
and often times devised with the king. They were in the field a threscore
thousand horse / they had but few a foot / saving such as were folowers.
The company of the christian men were noble and well ordered / and of Hungery
there were many crosebowes a horseback. the army iourneyed so long that they
came to the river of Dunce / and passed over in ships and barges / and such
bridges as they had ordained for that purpose. It was eight days or they were
all passed over / and as they passed they lodged them / every company taryenge
for other. This river of Dunce departs ye realms of Hungery and Turkey a
sonder.

When the christen men were all over and nothing tarried behind / and were in
the fro^ters of Turkey / they greatly reioysed and desired greatly to do deeds
of arms. There they took counsel and determined to go and ley siege to a
town in Turkey called Coniecte. And as they ordained so they did / and
besieged it as they might well do / for it stood in a plain country / and a
river ioynynge to it with ships thereon / called Necte: the heed coming out
of Turkey / and falling in to the sea at the river of Dunce. The river of
Dunce is a great River of three hundred miles in length / fro the beginning
till it enter in to the Sea. Which were the most profitable river in all the
world / for the realm of Hu^gry / if the ships that be thereon might issue
out thereof in to the Sea / but they can not For in the mouth thereof when they
should issue in to the sea / there is in the river a mountain which departs
the river in two pertes / and makes such brute and noise / that it may well
be herd seuyn mile of / and for that cause there is no ship yt dare aproche
nere to it. I long by this river side there be fair meadows and pastures /
whereby all the country is well served / and diverse vynes / which in seasone
make good wynes / which the Turks do make and put in to Goot skynnes / and
sells it unto Christen men: For according to their law / they dare drink no
wine to be known. It is defended them on pain of life. But they eat the
reysynges / and they have other good fruits and spyces / whereof they make
drink / and use greatly to drink Gootes milk / which refressheth them in
the hot season. Thus the king of Hungry and his host lodged before the city
of Coniecte at their ease and pleasure / for no man troubled their siege. And
when they came before the City / they found the fruits ripe / the which was
great pleasure to them. They made to this City diverse assautes / and they
within defended them self / trustyng daily to have aid and socour of
Lamorabaquy their lord / to reyse the siege with puyssaunce. But he did not /
whereby the City was taken by force of assaute / and distroyed with great
slaughter of men / women / and children. For the christen men that entered had
no mercy nor pytie. Whan^e this City was thus won / the king of Hungry
dislodged and went forward in to Turkey / and was determined to go and ley
siege to a great city called Nicopoly. and as they rode / they found in their
way the town of Quayre / and laid siege to it fyftene days or it was won /
but finallye it was won by assaute / and clean distroyed. And so passed forth
/ and in their way they found another town and a strong castle called
Brehappe / and a knight of Turkey was lord thereof / and was within the castle
to defend it. The king and his army were lodged within a mile where was a
fair river / and about the town there was none. There the earl of Neuers was
made knight and raised his banner / and with him were made mo than three hundred
knights / and all they and their companies went before Brehap / and besieged
it and wan the town perforce within four days / but not the castle it was so
strong. The lord of Brehap saved much of his people byforce of the castle /
who was called Corbodas / a right valyant knight / and he had other three
brethren / one named Maladius / another Balachius / and the third Rufyn.
After this town was won / the christen men were before the castle seuyn days
and made diverse assautes / but they lost more than they wanne. The four
knights brethren yt were within / showed well by their defense / that they
were valyant men. When the French men had consydred well the force of the
castle / and the valiant ordr^^ge of the turks within / and the defense that
they made / They saw well than^e they lost their pain / and so dislodged /
for they had knowledge how the king of Hungry would go and lay siege to the
strong town of Nicopolye. Thus the siege before Brehap brake up / and they
within the Castle were in peace but the town was clean brent. than the earl
of Neuers and all the lords of France resorted to the kings army / ordring
the^ self to go to Nicopoly.

WHan^e Corbodas of Brehappe saw the siege brokenne up / he was right joyful
/ and said to his company. We need no more to fere this season though my town
be brent and exiled / I shall right well recover it again / but of one thing
I maru^yle greatly. and that is ^ that I can here no news fro my lord the
king Besant / called Lamorabaquy. for the last time that I saw him in the
city of Nicopoly / he said unto me / that this May time he would be in this
country / and had entencyon to pass with a great puyssaunce the brase of
saint George / and to go in to Hu^gry to fight with the christen men / and so
he ^ent word to the king of Hungry / and yet he has done nothing. and
thereupon they of Hu^gry be fortifyed / and have as now great socour out of
France / and have passed the river of Dunce / and are entered in to Turkey /
and have and do distroye the country / for there is no resistance made against
the^ / and they think surely to go and lay siege before Nicopoly. The city is
strong enough to resyst the siege a long season / if it be well defended and
kept. We are here ^our brethren and knights of the lynage of king Besant /
We ought and are bound to defend his right / therefore let us order our
self / as I shall show you. I and my brother Maladyus / we shall go to the
City of Nicopoly / to aid / to help and defend it / and my brother
Balachyus shall abide here to keep this castle of Brehap / and my brother
Rufyne shall pass the brase of saint George and go seek out Lamorabaquy / and
show him every thing that is past and done / and advise him for his honor
to ente^de to defend his heritage / and to come with such puyssaunce / that
may resyst the christen men / and to break their purpose / or else he shall
lose ye realm of Armony / which he has conquered / and his own country
also. For by all ymagynacyon the king of Hungry and the Christen men are
gadered / to thentent to do some great enterprice. His three brethren agreed to
his saying. On this apoyntment they prepared them self to depart.

SO in this season siege was laid before Nicopolye / and Corbodas of Brehappe
and Maladyus his brother / came and entered in to Nicopoly / whereof they of the
city were right joyful / and Balachyus abode still at Brehappe to keep the
castle. and Rufyn when he saw time be night he passed the Christen army / for
he knew well the country / and passed over the brase saint George / and
^erched for Lamorabaquy / and the same season he was at Quayre with the soudane
of Babylone / to have aid of men of him. Rufyn found this turk there / and
when king Besant saw him he had marueyle / and thought surely he should here
some news out of Turkey. Than^e he demanded what tidings. sir quod Rufyn /
all the country desires sore to se you there / for ye king of Hungry with
puissaunce has passed the river of Dunce / and is entered in to Turkey and has
done great do^mage and has brent and assailed a five or six of your closed
towns. And when I departed fro Brehappe / he was in purpose to go and leye
siege to Nicopoly. Corbodas and Maladyus my brother / with such men of war
as they have / are en^red in to Nicopoly to help to defend the town / and my
brother Balachyus is still at Brehappe / to keep the castle there. And sir /
of surety there is in the company with the king of Hungry / the goodlyest
army and best appointed come out of France that ever was seen. Wherefore sir /
it behooves you to assemble your host and friends / and return in to Turkey
/ to cause your enemies to return again over the river of Du^ce / and ye do
it not with great puyssau^ce / it will be hard to bring it about. What nombre
be they quod Lamorabaquy? sir quod he / they be mo than a hundred thousand /
and the good lie men o^ the world / and best armed / and all on horse back.
Lamorabaquy gave none answer / but entered in to the Soudans chamber / and
showed the Soudane all the hole matter / as his knight had showed him. than the
soudane said. We must provide for it / ye shall have men ynowe to resyst the^.
Needs we must defend our law and our heritage. That is true sir quod
Lamorabaquy.

Now my desires arre come to pass / for I have always desired none other
thing / but that the king of Hungry with his puissaunce / might ones come
over the river of Dunce / and enter in to Turkey. In the beginning I will
suffer a season / but at the end they shall pay for the scotte. Of all this I
had knowledge four months paste / by my great Friend the lord of Myllayne
/ who sent me Go. hawks / Gerfaucons / and faucons / to the nombre of.xii.
which were the best and fairest that ever I saw. And with this present he
wrote to me by name / all the heedes and chief capitayns of the barons of
France / such as should come to make me war. In the which letters was also
contained / that if I might get them in my danger / they should be worth to
me a myllyon of floreyns. And also / how there should be in their company of
the lymytees of France / mo than five hundred knights / valiant men of
arms. Also the Duke of Myllaygne wrote / that surely they will give me battle
/ wherefore I will prepare to mete with them / by art / advise / and good
ordinance / for they are men of great feate / and so valiant in arms / that
they will not fly nor recule / they are worthy o^ thank to issue out of their
own nacyon by valiantness / to find deeds of arms. And I trust to
acco^plysshe their desires within three months / so that they shall have
enough to do.

TO co^sydre these words / one ought greatly to marueyle / that the Lord
Galeas earl of Virtues and Duke of Myllayne (who was reputed to be a christen
man / baptized and regenerate after the Christen Law) would seek or require
love or alyaunce with a king myscreant / out of our law and faith / or to
send him gifts and presents / as he did every year: As dogs / hawks /
and fine lynen clothes / which are right plesaunt to the Sarazins / for they
have none but that comes fro our parties. Also the great Turk sent to him
again other presents of rich clothe of gold and precious stones / whereof
the Sarazins have great plenty. But in those days the earl of Virtues duke of
Myllayne and sir Galeas his father reigned as tyrants / and so held their
signories.

It is marueyle to think of their deeds / and first how they entered and
opteygned the signorie of Myllayne. So it was there were three brethren / the
lord Manfres / the lord Galeas / and the lord Barnabo. They had an uncle
who was archebysshoppe of Myllayne. And so it fortuned / that when ye lord
Charles of Lusenbourge king of Boesme and of Almayne and emperor of Rome / who
reigned after king Loyes of Bauyer / who opteygned to the Empire byforce / for
he was never taken as Emperor by ye church / but exco^munycate and a cursed
by pope Innocent / who reigned as than^e. For this Loyes of Bauyer went to Rome
and made himself to be crowned emperor by a pope and.xii. cardynalles that he
made. And as soon as he was crowned / he made the Almayns to be paid their
wages / to over ryn Rome and to rob and to pyll it. this was the reward that
the romans had for receyuyng of him / wherefore he dyed exco^municat and in
that sentence. The pope and cardynalles that he made / without any constreyn^
came after to Auignon / and submytted them selfs to pope Innocent / who
reigned before Vrbayne the fyfthe / and there were assoyled of their errors.
Now to purpose how the lords of Myllayne came first to that signorie / I
shall show you how.

SO it was / the archebysshoppe of Myllayne / at a time received king Charles
of Boesme emperor / in to ye city of Myllayne nobly and tryumphantlye / after
the Emperor had been before Axe the Chapel / and had accomplysshed there
his.xl. days / according to the usage in the case parteyning / and for the
great chere that he made to the Emperor / and for a hundred thousand ducates
that he lent to the Emperor. He made the bishop vycou^t of Myllayne and his
nephews after him for ever / to hold the land and signorie of Mylayne free
at his will / unto the time that the Emperor had paid again at one time
the said so^me of a hundred thousand ducates. And so after the bishop dyed
/ and ye lord Manfres his nephue / by the accord of the Emperor and for love
of his uncle / was received in to the signorie of Myllayne. than his two
brethren / who as than were not very rich / the lord Galeas and the lord
Barnabo / counsayled toguyder and determined to reign / and to hold the
lands of Lo^bardy between the^ / and to co^ioyne the^ by marriage to some great
lords to maynteyne their estates / and to cause men to fear their
displeasures. And so they caused their brother Ma^frese to be slain by venyme
/ or otherwise / after whose death they reigned puissauntly byforce and polycy.
All their days they lived in good accord toguyder / and departed the cities
of Lombardy between them. The lord Galeas had ten / because he was the
eldest and the lord Bernabo nine. And the city of Myllayne was governed one
year by the one brother and another year by the other brother. And to the
intent to reign puissauntly / they sought the ways to gader great richesse by
raysinge up in possyons / subsydies / and gabelles / and many other yuell
customs / whereby they gadered great store of gold and silver. and they caused
their towns and cities to be kept with soudyours strangers / as Almaygnes /
French men / Bretons / Englysshmen / and of all other nacyons / except their
own country men / for they had no trust nor affiaunce in them / for fear
of rebellyon against the^. and these soudyours were paid fro month to month
/ whereby they were so douted and fered of the people / that none durst
displease them. For if any did rise or did any thing against them / there was
cruel vengeance taken upon them. They distroyed many a one in their days /
to give ensample to other.

IN all their signories no man had any thing but at their pleasure / They
would tail a rich man three or four times in a year. They said that lo^bardes
were over proud and presu^ptuous / in their richesse / wherefore it was
behouable to keep them under subjection / no man durst say nay to any thing
that they commanded.

These two brethren married them hyghlye / and bought their wives with the
goods and substance of their people. The lord Galeas had to wife the
suster of the good earl of Sauoye / named Blaunche / and paid to the earl for
her a hundred thousand ducates. The lord Barnabo married him in Almaygne / to
the suster of the duke of Bresnyche / and paid no less money than his brother
did. These two brethren had many children / and married them highly and
richelye / to atteyne thereby great alyaunces. The lord Galeas had a sone
called Galleas / and as than the father understood that wha^ king Johan of
France was come out of England / and put to rau^some to.xxx.C. thousand
frankes / and they of France wist not how to reyse the first payment. Than^e
he treated with the French king and his counsel to have one of his
daughters for Galeas his son. The king and his counsel intended to this
treaty / because they knew well this lord Galeas was grounded in richesse /
and thus he bought the kings daughter for six hundred thousand frankes /
which were turned in payment to the King of England. And so his son
married king Iohans daughter / and to him was given the county and erldome of
Virtues in Champaygne. Of that son and daughter issued a daughter / which
byforce of gold and silver was married to the second son of king Charles of
France / called Loyes duke of Orlyaunce earl of Bloyes and Valoyes. The
marriage cost the earl of Vertus father to the said lady / ten hundred
thousaunde frankes. And the county of Bloyes was bought of the earl Guye of
Bloyes: as it has been contained here before in this history. Thus these
lords / Galeas and Barnabo / acorded right well toguyder all their live days:
they never varyed nor their people toguyder / therefore they reigned in great
puissaunce. No man could have reason nor right of them / Pope / cardynalles /
nor other that made any war against them / saving alonely the marquis of
Mou^tferant / and that was by the means of the lord Johan Hacon / and the
English men with the routes of the companyons / which Johan Hacon brought
them out of Prouynce in to Lombardy / and made there great war.

THan at last dyed this lord Galeas / and after him reigned his son earl of
Virtues / named Galeas in great puyssau^ce. and at the beginning of his reign
he gate him great love in Lombardy / and or / dred himself after a goodly
manner and like a wise man. He put down all such yuell customs as his father
had raised in Lo^bardy He was so well beloved and of so good renome that every
man said well of him / but at last whan^e he saw his time / he spytted out
his venyme / which he had long borne in his heart. For he made on a day in ye
feldes a great busshement / whereby the lord Bernabo his uncle was taken who
thought none yuell / nor knew not but that he was well-beloved / and in great
favor with his nephue. And at his taking it was said to him. One lord is
enough to reygne in Lombardy / he could have none other grace / for it lay not
in him as than^e to make resystence. So he was led to a castle / and there
his nephue caused him to dye / but in what manner I can not show you. This sir
Bernabo had two fair children / of whom the French queen was daughter / to
one of his daughters which was wedded to the duke of Osrtenaunt of Bauyere.
This Galeas put in prisone all his uncles children / such as he could get
/ and took possessyon of all his uncles seignories / and joined the^ to his
own / and so reigned in great puyssaunce and richesse / for he raised up such
matters / whereby he gathered toguyder great richesse: As Imposycions / gabels /
subsydies / dysmes / and all other extorcyons / whereby he was much more dreed
than beloved. He held the error and opinion of his Father (that was) How one
should another honor nor worship god. He took fro abbeyes and priories
much of their revenues / and took them to him self. He said the monks were
to delyciously norisshed with good wynes and delycious metes. By which
superfluyteis (he said) they could not rise at mydnight / nor do their service
as they should do. He said: saint Benet held not the order of his relygion
after that manner. And so (he said) he would make them to live with eggs and
small wine / to clear their voices to sing the higher. These lords in their
days lived like popes: they did great dispytes in their time to men of holy
church: They set nothing by the popes curse / and specially after ye cisme
began / and that there was two popes: that the one cursed the other assoyled.
The lords of myllayne did but mock at their doings / and so did many other
lords through ye world. The daughter of this lord Galeas duke of Myllayne
was duches of Orl au^ce / whose condycions were like to her fathers and not to
her mothers / who was daughter to king Johan of France. This lady was of high
mind / enuyous and couytous / on the delytes and state of this world. Gladly
she would have seen the duke her husband to have attaygned to the crown of
France / she had not cared how. A general fame and sclaunder ran upon her /
that all the infyrmiteis the king had / which no phisycion could remedy /
came all by her sorts and arts / and the chief discovering of her works /
whereby she was had in great suspecte was this.

THis duchess of Orlyaunce named Valantyne had a son by the duke her
husband / a fair child of the age of the Dolphyn / son to the king. On a
time these two children were playeng toguyder in the duchess of Orlyaunce
chamber / and suddenly there was cast down an apple full of poison on the
pauement / on the same side yt the dolphyn was on / to thentent that he should
have taken and eaten it. But as grace was he did not / for the duches son^e ran
after the apple and took it / and ete thereof wherewith he was poisoned and dyed
/ nothing could save him. And such as had Charles the young dolphyn to keep
took him thens / and he never came after in the duches chamber. Of this
adventure great brute and murmuracyon ran through all the city of Paris / and
in other places. Thus it was said by her of all the people / so that the duke
her husband parceyued it well / for brute ran through Paris / that if her
husband did not put her away out of the kings court / they would fetch
her away byforce / and cause her to dye. For the people said she would
enpoyson the king and his children / and that she had enchaunted the king /
for the king in all his infyrmyteis would not se the queen / nor none other
woman / but all only this duchess of Orlyaunce. Upon which saying and for
doubt thereof / her husband had her away / and put her out of the house of
saint Poule in Paris / and sent her to a castle beside Paris upon the way of
Beauoyes / called Asynyers. And there she was kept a long season / and never
went out of the castle / and at last she was sent fro thens to Newcastell on
the river of Loyre. And ye duke of Orlyaunce had great displeasure to her /
because of the adventure of ye death of his son / but by reason yt he had other
children by her / so^what it brake his displeasure. These tidings came to
Myllayne / and the lord Galeas was enfourmed how his daughter was in trouble
and in great danger / whereof he was sore displeased with the French king and
his counsel. Than he sent a suffycient messanger / as sir Iaquemont of Weryne
and other to Paris / to ye king and his counsel / in excusing his daughter /
saying that if any person would accuse her of trayson / he should be fought
with all at vttrau^ce in that quarrel. When these messangers ca^e to Paris /
the king was in good health / but he took no head of those messangers / nor of
their excuse: and so they were shortly answered nothing to their pleasure. So
they returned in to Lombardy / and declared to the duke of Myllayne all that
they had seen and done. Than the duke was in gretter displeasure than he was
before / and reputed it a great injury / and than sent his defyaunce to the
French king / and to all the hole Realm of France. And when his defyaunces
were brought to Paris / the lords and knights with the French army were as
than in Hu^gry / and entered in to Turkey. And for ye dispyte and hate that the
duke of Myllayne had to the French king and to some of his counsel /
therefore he held in amyte and alyaunce the great Turk / and showed him of the
secrets of France. Now we shall leave speaking of the duke / and speak of
the great Turk and of the barons of France / and of other Christen knights /
that were as than in Turkey.

How the great turk desired the soudan / and many other kings sarazyns to
aid him with men of war / to resyst against the christen men / and how
many valyant sarazyns came to him out of far countries. Cap. CC.xi.
IT was not long after / but that the great Turk departed fro Quayre fro the
Soudan / who promised to send him shortly great aid / of the best men of
arms of all his signories / to resyst against the puissaunce of the king of
Hungry and the French men. And the great turk sent in to all realms and
countries / where as he thought to have any aid and socour. For he consydred
and said / that if the French men conquered Turkey / all other realms
adjoining should trimble for fear of them / and thereby their faith and believe
should decay / and become under the subjection of the Christen men / which
they had rather dye. And thus at the desires of the Soudan and the great turk
/ many kings sarazyns enclyned unto their desires / as in Perce / in Mede /
and in Trace / and also out of the Septentryon / and out of the realm of Lecto
/ and to the bounds of Pruce. And for asmoch as they were informed that their
enemies the Christen men were flour of chiualry. These kings sarazins and
other lords of their law / did choose out among the^ the best traueylynge and
expert men of arms in all their countries. This assembly could not be
suddenly done / nor theirpuruy aunces so soon done. The great Turk set him
self forwards in to the field / always abiding for his people that came to
him fro far countries / and specially out of Tartary Mede and Perce. There
assembled many valyant sarazins out of all countries. They were desirous to
prove their strengthes against the Christen men. Now let us speak of the
christen men being before Nicopolye.

How the lord of Coucy and other lords of the christe^men / about a.v.
hundred spears disco^fited a fyftene thousand turks / during the siege
before Nicopoly. Cap. CC.xii.
THey that were besiege with in the strong town of Nycopolye / defended
themself right valyantly / how be it they were sore abashed that they herd
no tydi^ges for the great turk. The Emperor of Constantyne the noble had
written unto the^ that he was in the parties of Alexandre / and was not as than
passed ye brase saint George. So the christian men held their syege still before
Nycopoly. They had vytayles plentye and good chepe / that came out of Hungery /
and other marches nere adioynynge. And on a day the lord Coucy and other
french men took pleasure to ride forth at adventure to go se the country
further in. So they departed fro the siege about the nombre of five hundred
spears and as many crosbowes and archers all horsemen. The lord Coucy was
capytayne of that journey and the lord Raynolde of Roye / and the lord of
saint Pie in his company / and the Chateleyne of Beauoyre / the lord of Mount
Caurell / and the Bourge of Mountquell with diverse other / and they had guydes
with the^ such as knew the country / and they had certain fore ryders well
mounted to discover the country before them. The same weke there was an army
of the turks assembled together to the nombre of twenty thousand men / for
they were enfourmed how the christen men were abroad dystroyenge their
country / in resystence thereof / they assembled together and came to a strayte
which the christian men must pass / and they would enter in to the plain of
Turkey / and they could not well enter no way. And there the turks tarried a
two days and could here no tidings of the christian men / and so the third
day they thought to have returned. Than the christian men's foreryders came to
Brechault / nere where the turks were / and when the turks saw them aproche
they stood still close together / to se the dealing of the christian men / and
made no token nor sign to skrymysshe with them. These christian men aproched
nere to the turks / and saw well they were a great nombre / and yet they
could not advise them all. And when they had well auewed them they reculed
back / and came to the lord Coucy / and showed him what they had seen / of
which news ye christian men were right joyful / and the lord of Coucy said.
It is mete that we go and se them more nerer / sithe we become so far
forward / we shall not depart without fighting with them / if we should it
shall be to our blame and great rebuke That is true quod all the other knights
that herd him. Than every man prepared him self and his horse and rode
toward the place where the turks were. and between them and the turks there
was a little wode. when the christian men came to the wode side / the lord of
Coucy said to the lord Raynolde of Roy / and to the lord of saint Pie. Syrs /
mine advise is / to the intent to draw the turks out of their strength) that
ye two shall take two hundred of our spears / and I with the rest will abide
here in this wode / and ride ye so nere them that ye may cause them to come out
/ and than return you / and suffer them to chase you till ye be paste us in
this wode / and than suddenly turn upon them / and we shall close them in
behind / and so we shall have them at our will. To this advise all the
knights enclyned. than two hundred of them that were best horsed rode forth /
and the rest who were an eight hundred / enbusshed them self covertly in the
wode / and there tarried. The other rode forth / and came to the place where
the turks were. When they saw the christian men come / they were right ioyouse
/ wenynge there had been no mo / and so came out of their holds in to the
plain feldes. and when the christian men saw time they turned and fled / and
made the turks to chase them. They were so well horsed yt the turks could
not overtake them / and they chased so long that they passed the wode where as
the enbusshement was. When the turks were passed / the christian men issued out
/ and cried our lady be with the lord of Coucy / and so dasshed in behind
them / and made great occision. The turks held them close together / when
they saw how they were beset before and behind and did put them self to
defense as well as they might / but they kept none order / for they were not
ware of the reregarde. And when they saw them self so suddenly set on they
were abashed. The French men did quyte them self like valyaunte men of arms
/ and slew the turks at their pleasure in their flyenge. There were many
slain / the christen men took none to mercy / happy were they that could
escape and return fro thens as they came. And than the christian men that had
done that deed returned to their host before Nycopoly. Than tidings ran over
all the host how the lord of Coucy by his wisdom and valiantness had
dyscomfyted mo than.xv. thousand turks. Many spoke well thereof / but the earl
of Ewe praised nothing his deed / saying how it was done by pride / and how
that he had put the christian men (and specially his band) in great adventure
and parell / saying that with an handefull of men he fought folysshely with
the route of twenty thousand turks / he should rather (seeing he was in will
to do deeds of arms / and that the turks were on the field) have given
knowledge before he assailed his enemies to his head captain the lord Johan of
Burgoyne / that he might have had the renome and honor of that enterprise.
Besemynge the earl of Ewe spoke those words by envy / that he had to the lord
of Coucy / for all that voyage he had no love to him / because he saw how the
lord of Coucy had the love and favor of all his company and of other
strangers / which he deserved right well to have / for he was right nere of
the french Kings blood / and bare in his arms flower de lyces / and also he
was constable of France. Thus there engendered a great hate and yuell will
covertly / between the earl of Ewe and the lord Coucy / which hatred at last
apered clearly / whereby great myschefe fell the same seasone upon the christian
men / as ye shall here after. Now we we shall leave to speak any more at this
time of this matter and return to speak of the kings of England and of
France.

How the peace bytwen England and France continued / and of the marriage of
the king of England with the daughter of France. Cap. CC.xiii.
YE have herd here before of the marriage of the french kings daughter with
the king of England / the which time aproched nere / and both parties well
willing / except duke Thomas of Gloucestre / he was nothing joyful thereof /
for he saw well that by that marriage / there should be great confyderacyons
and alyaunces between the two kings and their Realms to live in peace /
which he was loathe to se / for he desired rather to have war. The same
season the duke had about him a knight called sir Johan Baquegay a secret man
/ and he set always ye duke to have war. The same seasone also the duke of
Guerles came in to England to se the king and his uncles / and offered him
self to do any lawful service to the king that he might do / he was bound
thereto by faith and homage / and he would gladly that the king should have
had watre rather than peace. This duke and the duke of Lancastre had great
co^munycacyon together of the voyage that the earl of Haynalt and the earl of
Ostenaunt his son would make in to Frese. The same time Fyerebrase of
Vertayne was in England / sent thither fro the earl of Ostrenant / to get
men of arms and archers to go in that voyage to Frese. The earl of Derby was
desired to go in that voyage / in aydinge of his cosyns of Heynalt. The gentle
earl had thereto good affectyon / and said how he would right gladly go in
that voyage / so that it pleased the king and his father. When the duke of
Guerles came first in to England / the Duke of Lancastre demanded of him what
he thought of that voyage in to Frese. He answered and said that it was a
parylous voyage / and ye Frese was a country not lightly to be won / saying
how in times past there had been diverse earls of Holande and Heynalte / that
have claymed their right there and gone thither to have put them in subiectyon /
but they have always lost their lives there / affyrmynge how the fresons are
people without honor / and have no mercy. they praise nor love no lord in the
world / they be so proud / and also their country is strong / for they be
enuyroned with the sea / and closed in with isses / rocks / and marysshes / no
man can tell how to govern them but them self. I have been desired to go in
that voyage / but I will not / and I counsel my cosyn your son the earl of
Derby / not to enter in to that voyage / it is no journey for him. I think my
fair brother of Ostrenant will go / for he has great desire thereto / and will
have a band of haynowayes with him / it shall be an adventure if ever they
return. Which words caused the Duke of Lancastre to think that his son
should not go in yt voyage / and so showed his son his entente / and badde
him delay that matter / for the king nor he would not that he should go. Thus
the duke of Guerles did let the aid that the earl of Haynalte should have
had of the earl of Derby. Many thought it was not well counsayled / nor yet for
none of their honors. The duke of Guetles all his life / naturally was Enuyous
/ presumptuous / and prou^de. yet for all that Fierebrase of Vertayn let not
his suit to get aid / and did so his dyligence that he gate knights and
squyers / and a two hundred archers. But the earl of Derby excused himself /
which excuse he was feign to take in gree / and saw well that his will was
good to go / if the king and his father had not been. Than the king for the
auauncement of his cosyns of Haynalte made to be ordained in the river of
Thamyse vessels and ships for the men that should go in that voyage to
Frese / to aryue at Encuse a town in the county of Haynalt / at the enter in
to Holande. This town stands on the sea / within twelve leages by water of
the realm of Frese.

THe same season was sent in to England fro the french king / the earl
Valeran of saint Powle / with certain artycles concerning the treaty of the
peace / and with him was sent Robert the Hermyte / whom the king of England
was glad to here speak. The earl of saint Powle found the king of England
and his brethren the earls of Brenne and of Huntyngdon / and the duke of
Lancastre the kings uncles / at the manor of Eltham. The king received him
ioyously / and herd well his message / and said to him a part. Fair brother
of saint Powle / as to the treaty of peace between me and my fair father of
France / I am right well enclyned thereto / but I all alone can not promote
that matter. True it is my brethren and my two uncles of Lancaster and york
enclyne right well thereto / but I have another uncle the duke of Gloucestre /
who is right paryllous and a marneylous man / he lets it as much as he can
/ and does what he can to draw the Londoners to his opinion / I fear me to
make a rebellyon in my realm / and that he should reyse the people against me
/ which is a great paryll / for if the people of England rise again against
me / and have mine uncle of Gloucestre on their part / and such other barons
and knights of the realm as be of his opynion / my realm were lost without
remedy / for mine uncle of Gloucestre is so secerte / that no man can know
his mind. Sir quod the earl of saint Powle / it behooves you to win him with
fair / sweet / and loving words / and give him great gifts / if he demand
any thing grant it him / this is the way whereby ye shall win him / ye must
flatter him till the peace be made / and that ye have your wife brought hither
to you / and that done than ye may take other counsel / ye shall be than of
the puyssaunce to oppress all your rebels / for the french king if need be
shall aid you / of this ye may be sure. In the name of god / ye say well and
thus shall I do.

THe earl of saint Powle was lodged at London / and often times went to Eltham
to se the king and the duke of Lancastre / and had often times co^munycacion
on this marriage. Therle of saint Poule said how the french king should come
to saint Omers and his uncles / and bring with him his daughter / so that the
king of England would come to Calais / and so between saint Omers and Calays
/ the two kings should mete and speak together / whereby by reason of sight and
speaking together should increase love and amyte / and there these two kings
and their uncles should speak together without any other company / on the form
of the peace / and if they conclude not on some peace / yet at least the trewce
might be relonged to endure for thyrty or.xl. year / between the two realms
and their alies. This deuyse seemed right good to the king and to his counsel
/ and hervpon the king and other lords sent to Calays to make prouysyon /
and the king desired his uncle the duke of Gloucestre to go with him in that
journey / and the duches his wife and his children / and in like wise the Dukes
and duchesses of york and Lancastre. And so when every thing was ready the
king and the earl of saint Powle departed fro Eltham and rode toward
Caunterbury / and after them followed all other lords / such as should go in
this voyage / and such as had been desired. The earl of saint Powle passed the sea first / to the intent to aduertyse the French king / and so passed to
Boloyne and so to Paris / and there declared to the french king and to his
uncles how he had spedde / wherewith they were well content / and so departed
fro Paris / and little and little aproched to the city of Amyence / and the
king of England and his uncles came to Calais / with many lords and ladies.
And the duke of Burgoyne one of the french kings uncles came to saint Omers /
and by the means of the Earl of saint Powle and Robert the hermyte / the duke
of Burgoyne came to Calays / to se the king of England and his uncles* where
he was nobly received / and there they cou^sayled together on certain artycles
of the peace / whereto the king of England lightly enclyned. and for to say
troth he cared not what he did / so he might have his wife.

When the duke of Burgoyne had been at Calais two days / and had co^muned with
the king of England on the artycles of the peace / the king said how he
would send all the process of the artycles over the sea in to England / to
beshewed and declared there to the people / for he said that nouther he / nor
all the lords that were there of England / could not conclude fermely on no
peace / without the general consentment of the people of England. And more
over the king said / how that he must first go over again him self / and
so return / and thereby make but one journey. That is well said quod the duke
of Burgoyne / for than at your return / every thing shall be concluded and
performed. Thus the duke of Burgoyne / and the earl of saint Powle departed
fro Calays / and returned to saint Omers / and fro thens to Amyence / where
they found the king and the queen and their daughter / who should be queen of
England. The same time there was the dukes of Bretaygne and of Berrey in great
array. And the king of England and his uncles and other lords returned in
to England / and their wives tarried still at Calays till their return. In
this mean season the voyage was made in to Frese / by them of Haynalte. First
the earl of Heynalte / Holande / and of zelande / and his son the Earl of
Ostrenaunt / as ye shall here after in this history.

How the earl of Heynalt and the earl of Ostrenante his son made a great
army of men of arms knights and squyers to go in to Frese. Cap. CC.xiiii.
Ye have herd here before how duke Auberte of Bauyer / and Guylliam his son
earl of Ostrenant / had great desire to go in to Frese to conquer that country
/ whereof the said duke Aubert by right succession of heritage / should be earl
and lord thereof. and to auaunce the same journey / the earl of Ostrenant had
sent Fyerebrace of Vertayne to have some aid of the english men / who spedde
him so well that king Richard of England for the honor of his cosyns / sent
certain men of arms with two hundred archers / under the guydyng of three
gentlemen / one called Cornewayle / another Colleuyll / knights / the third
asquyer / I know not his name / but I was well enfourmed that he was a
valiant man of arms / he had his chynne cut of in a fray a little before
/ and he had a chynne made of silver / tied about his heed with a lase of
sylke. These englysshmen came to Encuse at their time prefyxed. This duke
A^berte and his son had a valiant man of their counsel called Gylliam of
Croenbourge / who greatly exorted them to the war / for he hated greatly the
fresones / and had done them many dyspyghtes / and did after / as ye shall
here. Thus the duke Aubert departed fro the Hay in Holande with Gyllyam his
son earl of Ostrenant / and so came in to his country of Haynalte / to the
town of Monts / and there he assembled together the three estates of the
country / and there showed unto them the great desire that he had to go in to
Frese / and the rightful occasion that he had so to do / and caused there to
be openly showed certain letters patentes apostolykes and imperyalles right
noble and autentyke / sealed under lead lyole and enter / by the which apered
euydently the right and tytell that he had to ye signory of Frese / and than he
said openly. Lords and valiant men my subgettes / ye know well that every
man ought to keep and defend his heritage / and that a man may laufully move
war^ to recover his land and heritage. ye know also ye fresons ought by right
to be our subgiettes / and they be inobedyent and rebel against us and our
sygnory / as people without law or faith. and therefore good and dear friends
ye know well that without your aid / both with bodies and goods / we can
not fournysshe to bring to execusyon so high an enterprise / wherefore we
desire you in this business to aid us / that is to say with money and with
men of war / to the intent that these inobedyent fresons may be subdued and
brought to obedyence. These words or such like / spoken by the duke / the
three estates by a common acord granted their lords petycyon and request /
like such people as greatly desired and always had done to do obedyent
service and pleasure to their lord and prince. And as I was enfourmed they
caused him to have in ready money mountante to the so^me of thyrty thousand
pound / beside the town of Valence^nes / who in like wise did their deuoyre /
and also in the town of Monts. These things thus concluded / the valiant
princes / the good duke Auberte and Giullyam his son earl of Ostrenant /
seeing the good wylles of his men / was right joyful / which was no marvel
/ for he saw well that he was well beloved with his subgiettes / and should be
well fournysshed with money. Than he had counsel to send to the french king
/ and to show him the enterprise of his voyage / and to desire aid of him /
and thither was sent two valiant and wise men that is to say / the lord Lygne
and the lord of Ieumont / who were two right valiant knights and well
beloved with the french men / and specially the lord Lygne / the king had
made him one of his chamberlayns / and had him in good favor / he spoke with
the king and showed him the dukes intent and request. to the which the king
and his counsel favorably agreed / and specially the duke of Burgoyner /
because his daughter was married to therle of Ostrena^t / whereby he thought that
in time to come after / it should be to their profit / and to their heirs /
how be it many great lords and other spoke of this journey in diverse manners.
Some said / to what purpose does these heyno ways desire the king of aid /
they have been in England and sought for aid there. Has not the earl of
Haynalt of late taken on him the blewe garter to tie his leg withal / which
is ye order in England / it semyth thereby he has no great affectyon to
France? Than other that were right wise answered and said. Sir ye do wrong to
say thus / though the earl of Ostrenant have taken the order of the garter /
yet for all that he is not alyed with the english men / but he is fermly
alyed with France. Has not he in marriage the lady Katheryne / daughter to the
duke of Burgoyne? which is a far greater alyau^ce than is a garter /
therefore never say but that he will love and do pleasure to France / by reason
of his marriage / rather than to England for y^ garter / wherefore the king
shall do right honorably to aid him. Thus the french men devised among them
self / and spoke in diverse manners / both of that journey and also of the
journey in to Hungery and in to Turkey / against Lamorabaquy and the turks.

Of the army that the french king sent in to Frese in the aid of his cosyns /
and the lord Valeran Earl of saint Powle and the lord Charles de la Brete
were capytaynes. Cap. CC.xv.
THe french king assembled an army of five hundred spears / as well of
pycardes as of frenchmen / and made capytayns over the^ / the lord Valeran
earl of saint Powle and the lord Charles de la Bret / who were valyau^t
knights and well expert in arms / and they were appointed to lead this
company to the town of Encuse in base Frese / when as the assemble should mete
/ and there to take the sea to enter in to high Frese (as they did) When these
two knights / the lord Lygne and Iumont saw the kings good will / and that
these men of war were dyspatched and their wages paid / they came to the
king and thanked him / and took their leave and returned in to Heynalt / to
their lord the duke Aubert and to the lord Gillyam his son / to whom they
were right welcome / for they had well sped. There they showed the good answer
and good chere that they had with gifts of great presents. when duke Auberte
knew that the French king had sent him five hundred spears / than he
assembled all his noble men / knights / squyers and other of Haynalt / as the
lord of Vertayne seneschall of Haynalte / who was a valiant man and greatly
renomed in arms / the lords of Lygne and Comygnes / who was made marshall /
and the lords of Haureth / of Nychelet / of Lalyne / of Hordayne / of Chyne of
Cantan / of Quesnoy / of Fleron and John^ his brother / the lords of Bouset
and of Ieumont / who were fresshe knights on their enemies / also there was
Robertle Rour / and the lords of Mo^th^aulr / of Fou^tayns / of Seuls and of
Sars / William of Hermes / Pynchart his brother / the lords of Lens / of
verlamont / of Ausealr / of Trascigmes / Octes Seaus^es / Gyrarde his brother /
the lord Dyctre and Johan his brother Bridaulx of Montaguy / Damaulx de la
powle and Guy his brother / the lord of Mastynge / sir Floridas of Villyers /
who was a valiant man / and had done many deeds of arms among the turks
and sarazins and sir Eustace of Vertayn Fierebras of Vertayne who was newly
come out of England / sir Raze of Montiquy / the lord of Rorsyn / sir Johan
Dandr^gntes and Persant his brother / and diverse other knights and squiers.
All these he assembled at Monts and desired them to go with him / and every man
to bring with him company acordynge to their degrees / and that they would
auaunce them to the town of Encuse in base frese and theraboute / and so to go
with him by seem to high Frese about the mids of August next after / there he
said he would ^ary for them / for he would go thither before to move the
holanders and zelanders to serve him in like manner. Than these said knights
and esquyers of Haynalt without any contradictyon acorded to his desire /
promysinge to do him service as his true subgiettes / which they fulfilled in
deed and dyligently prepared for the same / so that by the beginning of the
month of August / in the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred
fourscore and syxtene / they were all ready aparelled and assembled by companies
at Anners / there to take the water / and fro thence to Encuse / where the hole
assemble should mete. Now while this assemble was thus made in Haynalte / it
were to be demanded if the ladies and gentle women and other / were ioyouse of
this journey? We ought to say nay / for than they saw their fathers / their
brethren / their uncles / their husbands / and their lovers and friends
depart to yt peryllous war. for some of them knew well / how that in time
paste the haynoways went with their lord in to Frese / and never returned
again / wherefore they feared lest it should hap so than to these / as it did
on their predecessors. The duchess of Brabant had defended all men in the
country of Brabant / no man to be so hardy to go out of the country in that
journey. The ladies and gentlewomen of Haynalt desired often times their
friends and lovers to leave that journey / but they could not let the matter
/ how be it they were sore displeased in their minds with the basterde of
Vertayne Fierebrase / for they said he was one of the chyefe setters on of that
business. Thus after that the duke Aubert and Guillyam his son had herd the
answer of his men of Haynalte / than he went in to zelande / showing them
his business. and they assented to his request / by the chief setting on of
the lord de la Vere / and sir Floris de Boesell / Floris / Dabell / the lord
of zenembrige / sir Clays de Boysell / Phylyp Corteen and diverse other
gentlemen. All these and other made them selfs ready / in such wise that it
apered well by their dylygence / that they had great desire to auaunce them
self to that journey.

IN like wise the duke and his son went in to Holande and made there like
requests to ye lords and good towns / as they had done in zelande. The
holanders were thereof right ioyouse / for of all men they hated the fresons /
for they were ever at war together specially on the sea and on the borders of
their country / and therefore the lords of Holande / such as the lord
Tarterell / and diverse other noble men knights and squyers / herynge the
requests of their lords duke Aubert and the earl of Ostrenant they offered
themself / promising comfort and aid to the best of their powers / and that
they well showed / for incontinent they made them ready / and auaunced forward.
In like wise did the men of the good towns and of the country. They sent
forth with these lords a great nombre of crosbowes and morispykes / and other
men of war. So daily men asembled at the town of Encuise / and ships and
vessels came thither / in such wise / that the maryners were esteemed to the
nombre of.xxx. thousand. It was said that there came out of the town of
Harle.xii. hundred / which ships were well provided of all things
necessary. And of a truth / if the ladies and other damoselles were soroufull
in Heynalt / in likewise so were they of Hollande and zelande. Sir Danyell of
Marebbed and Guillyam of Oruenbourge they durst not apere before the ladies and
gentylwomen / for they had sore set forward the business / for they had
great will and desire to be revenged of the Fresons / because of a battle that
had been there before / wherein the Earl Wyllyam was pituouslye slain / and
lost.xxxiii. cotes of arms of his lynage / wherefore these two knights would
never take any treson to mercy nor rau^some. So within a certain space every
man was come to Encuise. First came the English men and than the henous / and
their capyten was the seneschall of Iumont and the lord of Comegynes / who was
marshall. Than came hollanders and zelanders. The french men came not so
soon. So they tarried a.xi. days for the French men / in which season there
fell a debate bytwent the hollanders and the English men / and if the earl of
Ostrenaunt had not ben / all the Englysshmen had been slain. Which strife was
apesed and than the frenchmen came. Than there was great joy made / and
commandment given / that every man should enter in to such ships / as they
were assygned unto before / which was done. And when they were all shypped
they hoysed up sails and sailed forth. the wether was fair / it seemed as it
was disposed to do the^ pleasure. There were so many ships that if they had
be^ araynged one after another / they would have stretched fro encuse to the
bounds of Condren / which was in high Frese / where they purposed to arryue
(as they did) which was.xii. leages by water / but they sailed a front right
ordinatly. Now will we leave spekyng of them and speak of the Fresons / who
(as I was informed) were aduertysed long before of duke Aubertes coming / with
great puyssaunce on them.

When the fresons knew and understood that they should have war / all the
wise men of the country assembled toguyder / to take counsel and advise what
they should do. When they had long debated the matter / their ente^cion was to
fight with their enemies / as soon as they might know that they were entered
in to their country / saying how they had rather dye as fre Fresons / tha^ to
be in seruage under any king or prince / or under subiectyon. And therefore
they said / to dye in the quarrel they would fight with their enemies. And
concluded among themselfes / to take no man to ransom / how great soever he
were. Among them there was one man far exceeding in greatness above all
other. He was higher than any other man in that country by the heed. He was
called Iuye Iouer / and some called him the great Fresone. This manne was
greatly commended in Pruce / in Hungery / in Turkey / in Rodes / and in Cypres.
He had done many noble feats of arms / so that he was greatly renomed.
Whan^e he hard the opynions of ye Fresons / how they would fight with their
enemies / he answered and said. O / ye noble and free Fresons / know for
truth there is no chance but may turn. Though by your valyantnesse / ye
have or this time discon^^ted ye heyno ways / the hallanders / and the
zelanders. Know for truth / that such as come now upon you / are people
more expert in ye warr^ thanne they were before: And believe verily / they
shall do otherwise than their predecessors did. They will not give it up:
they will menteyne their deeds. Therefore I will counsel you to sufire them to
enter / and let us keep our forteresses / and let them keep the feldes /
where they shall beat them selfs. Our country is not to sustain the^ long
We have many dykes. They can not go far in the country. They can not
ride abroad in the Country / and full yuell they may go a foot / whereby they
shall be so werye / that they shall waste them selfs / and so return again.
The most they can do is to brenne a ten or.xii. vyllages / which shall
natte greatly grieve us. They shall be soon made again if we should fight with
them. I fear me we be not strong enough to fight with them at ones / for as I
am informed / they be to the nombre of an hundred thousand armed heedes.
Which was of a truth / they were as many or mo. To his words consented three
other knights of the Fresons / the first named sir Few of Dorekerque / the
second sir Gerarde of Canym / and the third sir Tiny of Walturge / but the
people would in no wise consent to that deuyse / no more would other noble men
called the Elyns / that is to say / the gentylmen or judges of the causes.
They replied so with this great freson / that he was concluded with them / that
as soon as they knew their enemies entered in to their country / they should
go and fight with them. They abode all on that opinyon / and so made them self
ready. But to say the truth / they were but poorelye armed. Many had no
armure / but their cootes of wadmoll / and course gross clothe. Some armed with
lether / and some with rustye mayle: and some there were right well armed.

THus they armed them / and when they were ready they went to their churches
and took ye crosses and baners / and made three batayls / and in every battle
ten thousand fyghting men / and came to a narowe passage well viked / nere to
ye place where their enemies should land. and they saw well how their
enemies were come / and had great desire to take land / which was on saint
Bartylmewes day on a sunday / in the foresaid year. And when ye Fresons saw
the^ aproche / they issued out upon the dikes a sire thousand / to have let
the landynge of their enemies. Among the fresons there was a woman apparelled
all in blewe / who all in a rage / went fro the fresons and came nere to the
heynowes / within the shot of a bow. Than she turned her back toward ye
hey nowes and plucked up her clothes and showed her bare arse / cryeng in her
langage. sers take this to your welcome. As soon as they saw the lewdness of
this woman / they shot at her arowes and quarrels / so that she was stryken i^
^he legs and loins. The arowes came flyeng at her as thycke as snow. Than
some lepte out of the ships in to the water / and ran after this folysshe
woman with their swerdes and ouertoke her / and hewed her in to small pieces. Tha^
every man issued out of their vessels / and so came against the fresons / who
received them right valyantly and put them of with long pykes and long
staves bound with iron. To say ye truth in taking of land there was many
deeds of arms done on both parties / and many slain and sore hurt. But
biforce of the Englisshe archers and cross bows of Heynaulte / Hollande / and
zelande / They wanne the dyke against the fresons / and upon that dyke they
araynged their baners in good order / taryeng for their company / their reuke
was more than half a mile long. Than the Fresons that were put fro the
dykes came to their company / who were mo than.xxx. thousand / closed toguyder
in a ground dyked round about with a great deep dyke / and it was not so
far of / but they might well se their enemies / wheee they were raynged on
the first dyke. Thus they continued till all the heynowayes were a land / and
all their baggage / and certain tents reyred up. There they rested them that
sunday / and the mondaye aduisynge the Fresons their enemies / In which two
days diverse scrymisshes were made / and on the Tuesday both parties were
ready. Than certain new knights were made / and it was ordained to fight with
the fresons. Than they auauuced forewarde in good order of battle / and their
archers before them and among them / and than sowned trumpettes and clarions /
and so ca^e a fair pase to pass over the dike. Than the fresons came to
defend the passage / and the archers shot against them fiersly / and the
freso^s covered them selfs with targes / and with the earth of the dyke that
was between them and their enemies: How be it they were so nere aproched /
that certain of the holanders entered in to the dyke and made bridges with
speres and pykes / and so with valyant courage began to enuade the fresons / who
defended their force right valyantly / and gave such strokes against them that
would mount up out of the dyke / that many were overthrown down again: But
the Heynowayes / French men / English men / Hollanders / and zelanders were
so well armed / that the fresons could do them no do^mage nor hurt / but cast
them down to the ground. There were such noble deeds done and atchyued /
that it were impossible to show it. the new made knights did nobly their
deuoyre / and the Fresons defended marvelously. They were great and bygge men
/ but they were yuell armed: many were barelegged and bare foted. In this
assaut the lord Lygne / the seneshall of Heynault / and the lord Iumont / and
diverse other / as they went about this dyke / They found away whereby they
passed over the dyke / and so came on the fresons with the points of their
speres / whereof the Fresons were fore abashed / so that diverse of them lepte
the dyke. So perforce the Fresons were feign to opyn and sparcle abroad here
and there. In this battle the great freson was slain and the other began to
fly. The chase was horrible and cruel / for none was taken to rau^some / and
specially the holanders slew all they might attain unto / In so much that
such as were taken by the Heynowes / french men / or English men the
hollanders slew them in their hands. Among the hollanders / the lord
Wyllyam of Oruenbourge and his two sons / John^ and Henry (who were made
knights the same morning) acquyted themself maruey lously well / and slew
many Fresons / for it seemed well by them / that they loved but litell the
fresons. Thus finally the Fresons were disco^fyted / and the most part slain
in the field / but few were takenne prisoners / and carried to Hay in Hollande
/ and there were kept a long season after. The lord of Cundren (who was lord
of that country / where the field was) was the mondaye before yelden to the
duke Aubert and his two sons / and yet for all that they were in ye field
with the fresons. The two sons were long after with ye duke. After this
disconfyture they entered in to the country of Condren / and took towns and
fortresses / how be it they conquered but little / for the Fresons did the^
great do^mage by preuy encou^trynges. And when they should take any prisoners /
they would never yield / but fought to the death: saying they had rather dye
free Fresons / than to be under the subiectyon of any prince or lord. If any
prisoners were taken / there could no ransom be gotten for them / for their
friends would not quyte them out / but rather suffer them to dye in prisone.
They would never quyte none of their people / without it were to deliver man
for man. And if they saw that there were none of their people in prisone /
they would slay all their enemies and take no prisoner. Thus about the end
of.v. wekes / and that the heinous and other had taken and beaten down
certain towns / vyllages / and fortresses / of no great valor. The leason
began to wax cold marvelously / and rayned nereha^de every day / and the
sees full of tempests and wyndes. The duke Aubert and his son / consydringe
the season / purposed to return in to base Frese / fro whens they came / and
so in to Hollande / the more easy to pass the cold winter. So they departed
and came to Encuyse / and there gave license to every man to deperte / and
specially to the strangers / and paid the^ truly their wages / and thanked
them of their good aid and service. Thus brake up the journey of Frese / and
had conquered but little all that season. But within two year after / the said
two noble princes assembled again the second time a great army / and went in
to Frese and made a great conquest / and did there many noble deeds of arms /
as ye shall here after. But as now we shall leave spekyng thereof / and declare
ye manner of the marriage of the king of England to the daughter of France.

How the marriage of the king of England to the daughter of France was ordered
/ and how the French king delivered his daughter to the king of England in
his Tente by twene Arde and Calys. Cap. CC.xvi.
YE have herd / how the king of England was returned fro Calis in to
England / and there was till Michelmas that the perlyament at Westmynster
should begin. And in the mean season great provision was made at Calais and at
Guysnes / for the king and for other lords sent fro the ports of England on
that cost / and great prouisyon was had out of Flaunders / all came by see to
Calais. In likewise for the French king and for his brother the duke of
Orlyaunce / and his uncles / and other prelates and lords of France / great
prouisyon was made at saint Omers / at Air / at Tyrwyn / at Arde / at
Mountoyre / and at all other houses and abbeyes there about. there was nothing
spared on both parties / and specially the abbey of saint Bertyne was well
replenysshed of all things to receive these kings. This perlyament at
Westmynster began at Mychelmas / and it was ordained to endure.xl. days. But
it was abridged / for the king would not tarry there but.v. days / wherein he
declared the things most necessary parteyning to the realm / and specially
that matter that touched him self / and the cause why he ca^e fro Calais. That
done he returned toward Calais again / and with him his two uncles of
Lancastre and Gloucestre / and other prelates and lords of England / such as
were commanded to go with him. They spedde them so in their journey that they
came again to Calays. The duke of york tarried still in England and the earl
of Derby / to govern the realm in the kings absence. When the king of
England was thus returned to Calais / the lords of France being in Picardy
were advertised thereof. Than the duke of Burgoyn and the duchess his wife came
to saint Omers / and were lodged in the abbey of saint Bertyne. As soon as the
French king knew that the king of England was come again to Calais / he
sent to him therle of saint Poule / to show him what order was taken in
France / concerning his marriage / which the king of England was glad to
here. Than^e the duke of Lancastre and his son Beauforde of Lancastre. The
duke of Gloucester and Affren his son / the earl of Rutlande / the earl
mashall earl of Huntyngton / the kings chamberleyne / and many other lords /
knights / squyers / and ladies rode with the Earl of saint Poule to saint
Omers / where they were well received of the duke of Burgoyne and of the
duchess / and thither came the duke of Bretaigne / and had left the French
king at Air and his daughter with him.

ye may well know / all the chere yt could be devised / was made to the
English lords and ladies and other at saint Omers / and the duchess of
Burgoyne made them a great dinner. There was the duchess of Lancaster and her
son and two daughters. there was great gifts given of plate of Gold and
silver nothing was spared / in so much that the English men had marueyle
thereof / and specially the duke of Glocestre / and said to his counsel. I se
well there is great richesse in the realm of France. there was much given to
him / to the entente to abate and to molyfie his rancour that he had against
France. The lords of France knew well that he was always hard to agree to
the peace / wherefore they showed him as much token of love and honor as they
could do. He took ever all their gifts / but always the rancour abode still
in his heart / for all that ever the French men could do / they could not
molifye his fell stomach / for always he made herd answers as they treated for
any peace. The French men be subtyle / yet for all that they could get no
hold of him / for his words and aunswers were always so covert / that they
wist not how to understand them. When the duke of Burgoyne saw his manner he
said to his counsel. We lose all that ever we do to this duke of Gloucestour
/ for as long as he lives there shall be no sure peace between France and
England. For he shall always find new inuencyons and accydentes / to
engender hate and strife between both realms / for he ente^deth nor thinks
none other thing. If it were not the trust that we have in the king of
England / whereby here after to fare the better / the king should not have to
his wife our cosyn of France.

When the duke and duchess of Burgoyne / the countess of Neuers / the
countess of saint Poule / and the other lords and ladies of France / had
greatly feested the lords and ladies of England / than there was
co^municacion how these two kings should mete and speak toguyder / and how
the lady should be delivered / thereupon apoyntment was made / and leave taken
on all parts. The English pertie returned to Calis to the king / and showed
what chere they had / and what presents had been given them. These news
pleased well the king / for he was glad when he herd any honor spoken of
the French king / he was so in love with him because of his daughter / whom
he trusted to have to his Queen. Than anon after the French king came to
saint Omers / and was lodged in the abbey of saint Bertyne / and dislodged all
other that were there before / and had the duke of Bretayne in his company. And
than it was ordained that the dukes of Berrey / of Burgoyne / and of Burbone
should go to Calis to speak with the king of England.

SO they came to Calays / and were ioyouslye received / and had as good chere
as could be devised. These three dukes had secret communycacion with the king
and his counsel / so that many / both of France and of England reputed
that there was a peace concluded between France and England. And in deed it
was nere at a point / and the duke of Gloucester agreed well thereto / as at
that time. For the king of England had promised him / if he would agree to
the peace / to give his son Affren the erldome of Rochester in herytau^ce / and
to make him spend yearly in revenues two thousand pound sterlyng / and to
give to him self as soon as he came in England in ready money fyftie
thousand nobles / so that by reason of these gifts / the duke of Gloucestours
hardness was well aleyed. So that the lords of France saw well his opinyons
were not so obstynate as they were before / for they found him than sweet and
meke. Whan^e every thing was ordeygned of that they came for / they took
leave of the king and other / and returned to saint Omers to the French
king / and showed how they had spedde. Than the French king went to the
bastyde of Arde and the duke of Burgoyne to Mountoyre / and the duke of
Bretaygne to the town of Esque / and the duke of Berrey to Balyngham. And in
every perte all about there were pyght up Tents and Pauilyons / and all the
country full of people / what of France and of England. The king of
England came to Guysnes and the duke of Lancastre with him / and the duke of
Gloucestre to Ha^mes. Thus on a Fridaye being the even of Simon and Jude / in
the year of our lord god / a thousand three hundred fourscore and sixtene /
about ten of the clock in the forenoone. The two Kings departed out of
their tents / the which were pyght not far asondre / and came a foot the
one to ye other and met at a certain place that was appointed. And on the one
side there was araynged four hundred knights of France / armed with their
swerdes in their hands / And on the other part four hundred English
knights in like manner. So the two kings passed through them. The dukes of
Lancaster and of Gloucestre led the French king / and the dukes of Berrey
and of Burgoyne led the king of England. Thus they came foreby the said
eight hundred knights. And when the two kings came just toguyder / all the
eight hundred knights kneled down to the ground / and many of them wept for
joy. Thus the two kings met toguyder bareheeded / and a little enclyned and
took each other by the hands. Than the French king led the king of
England in to his tente / which was noble and rich / and the four dukes
took each other by the hands and followed the two kings. And other knights
after the French men on the one side / and the English men on the other
side: And so they stood regardyng each other in good and humble manner till all
was done. Than^e it was ordained / that on the same place where as the two
kings took each other by the hand / that there should be made and founded a
chapel in the honor of our Lady / and should be called our lady of Grace. I
can not tell whether it were made or not.

SO the two kings hand in hand entered in to the French kings tente. Than
the four dukes kneled down before ye kings and they raised them up / and so
talked toguyder. Than the two kings went a little a part / and talked a
certain space. In the mean time wine and spyces were brought. The duke of
Berrey served the French king of spyce / and the duke of Burgoyne of wine.
And the dukes of Lancaster and Gloucester served the king of England. tha^ other
knights and squiers served all other prelates and lords / so yt every man
wtin ye tent had part / and in the mean time the two kings co^muned
toguyder. This business done and paste / the two kings took leave each of
other / and so returned to their tents / and took their horses and rode
toward Calais. The king to Guysnes / the dukes of Lancastre and Gloucester to
Ha^mes / and the other to Calais. The French king rode to Cordre and the duke
of Orlyaunce with him / the duke of Berrey to Dornam / and the duke of Burgoyne
to Mountoyre. So there was no more done that day / all their tents stood
still in the feldes.

THan on the Saturdaye on the feast of saint Simon and Jude / about a.xi. of
the clock / the king of England and his uncles / and other lords ca^e to
the French king in to his tent. they were received right honorably / and every
manne talked with his fellow merrily. Than tables were set up / and the two
kings sat at one table alone / the French king on the right hand. The dukes
of Berrey / of Burgoyne and of Burbone served the two kings. tha^ the duke of
Burbone cast forth many iestyng words to make the kings to laughe and such
as were before the table / For this duke was a merry man / and said openly /
addressynge his words to the king of England. Sir quod he / ye ought to make
good chere / for ye have all that ye desire / ye have your wife or shall have
her delivered to you Than the French king said / Burbonoys. We would that our
daughter were of ye age that our cosyn of saint Poule is / on the condicyon
that it cost me a great good / than she should take my son with the better
good will. The king of England herd well those words / and answered spekyng
to the duke of Burbone (because the French king had compared his daughter /
to the earl of saint Poules daughter) and said. Sir / the age that my wife
(that shall be) is of / pleases you right well / we love not so much her
heritage / than I do the love of you and of our realms / For we two being of
one accord / there is no king christen nor other / that are able to anoye us.

This dinner thus done in the French kings tent / and after wine and spyces
taken / than the young queen was brought forth / a companyed with a great
nombre of ladies and damoselles / and there she was delivered to the king of
England. When yt was done / every man took their leave to depart. The young
queen was set in a rich lytter and there went no mo french ladies with her
/ but the lady of Coucy. There were the ladies of England / the duchesses of
Lancastre / of york / and of Gloucestre / and of Irelande / the lady of Namure
/ and the lady Poynynges / and a great nombre of other ladies / who received
the queen with great joy.

Thus the king of England and the young queen and his company / rode to Calais
the same night / and the french king and his company to saint Omers. Than the
Tuesdaye after which was Alhalowen day / the king of England married the said
lady Isabell of France / in the church of saint Nicholas in Calais / the
archebysshop of Canterbury wedded them / at which time there was a great
feast and great largess. The Thursdaye after there came to Calais the dukes of
Orlyaunce and of Burbone / to se the king and the queen: And on the friday
they took their leave and departed / and rode to saint Omers to the French
king. And the same day in the morning / the king and the queen took their
ship and had fair passage / they were over within three hours. the king
lay in the castle of Dover / and the next day to Rochestre and than to
Dartforde / and so to Eltham. Than^e all lords and ladies took their leave /
and a fiftene days after the queen was brought to the city of London /
accompanied with many lords / ladies and damsels / and lay the first night
at the tower of London / and the next day conveyed along through the city
with great solempnyte to the kings palais of Westmynster / and there the king
was before ready to receive her. the same day the londoners gave to the queen
great presents. Than was there ordained a great iustes to be holden in the
city of London / of.xl. knights and squyers chale^gers / to be holden at
Candelmas next after / which was delivered to the Herauldes to publysshe on
both sides of the realm to Scotland. And when the French king was come to
Paris after the marriage of his daughter and every lord departed home / there
ran than a great brute through the realm / how the french king was in
purpose at the beginning of March / to go with a great army in to Lombardy /
to dystroye the lord Galeas duke of Mylayne / the king had such displeasure
against him that no man could turn him but that he would make that voyage /
and the king of England had promised to send him six thousand archers. And
the duke of Bretaygne had offered to go with him with two thousand spears
bretons. Great prouysyon was made for this journey in the Dolphenry of Vyen /
and in the county of Sauoy. When the duke of Bretayne departed fro the french
king to return in to his country / sir Peter of Craon who was condemned to
pay to the queen of Iherusalem a hundred thousand frankes / and was in prison
in the castle of Loure in Paris. At the request of the duke of Bretaygne / the
duke of Burgoyne did so much to the king / that by his good means the duke
of Bretaygne had sir Peter of Craon with him. I think he promised to pay the
said so^me at certain days to the foresaid queen. I will now leave this
matter / and speak of the adue^tures of Turkey.

How the siege before Nycopoly in Turkey was raised by Lamorabaquy / and how
the French men were dyscomfyted / and how the hungaryons fled. Cap. CC.xvii.
YE have herd here before how the king of Hungery and the lords of France
were passed the river of Dunce / and were entered in to Turkey / and all the
so^mer after the month of July they had done many enterprises / and had
brought diverse towns to their subjection / for there was none that resysted
them / and had besieged ye town of Nycopoly / and had nere brought it to a
small estate / nigh ready to yield / for they could here no news of
Lamorabaquy. Than the king of Hungery said to the lords of France and to
other. Syrs thanked be god we have had a fair seasone / we have dystroyed
part of Turkey / I reken this town of Nycopolyours when we list. it is so
sore ouerlayde that it can not long hold / wherefore all things consydred I
counsel (this town ones won) that we go no further at this season / we shall
draw again over the Dunce in to the realm of Hungery / where I have many
cities / towns / and castelles ready furnysshed to receive you / as reason is /
seeing ye be come so far to aid me to make war against the turks / whom I
have found herd and cruel enemies / and this winter we shall make new
prouysion against the next somer / and send word to the french king what
case we be in / so that this next so^mer he may refresshe us with new men /
and I believe when he knows what we have done and how every thing stands /
he will have great affection to come hither in his own person / for he is
young and couragyous / and loves deeds of arms. and whether he comes or not
/ by the grace of god this next so^mer / we shall win the realm of Armony /
and pass the brase of saint George / and so in to Surrey / and win the
ports of Iaphes and Baruth / and conquer Iherusalem and all the holy land.
and if the sowdan come forewarde we shall fight with him / for he shall not
depart without battle.

THese or like words said the king of Hungery to the lords of France and
rekened Nycopoly as their own / how be it fortune fell otherwise. All that
season the king Basaach called Lamorabaquy had raised an army of sarazyns /
some out of far countries / as out of Perce. many great men of the sarazyns
came to aid Lamorabaquy to dystroy crystendome. They were passed the Brase
saint George to the nombre of two hundred thousand men. To say the troth the
christen men were not a certayned what nombre they were of. This king Basaache
and his men aproched nere to Nycopoly by couerte ways / they knew in feats
of war as much as might be / and this king was a valiant man / which
showed well by reason of his polycy / he ordered his bataylles thus. All his
host was in a manner as wings / his men comprised well a great mile of ground
/ and before the host to show a face redye in a band an eight thousand
turks / the two wings of the battle were open a forefronte and narowe
behind/and Lamorabaquy was in the heart of the battle / thus they rode all in
couerte. These eight thousand Turks were ordained to make a face / and yt as soon as they should se the christian men a proche / than they to recule little
and little in to the heart of the battle / and than the two wings which were
open before (the christian men being ones entered between them) to close together
and join in to one company / and than to fight with their enemies. This was
the order of their battle.

THus in the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred fourscore and
syxtene / the monday before the feast of saint mychell about ten of the clock
/ as the king of Hungery sat at dinner at the siege of Nycopoly / tidings came
to the host how the turks were coming and the scoutes that came in showed
how they had seen the turks / but their report was not true / for they had
not tydden so forward / that they had auewed the two wings / nor the battle
behind / they had seen no mo but ye fore ryders and bowarde / for as soon as
they had seen them they returned. The same seasone the greatest part of ye
host were at dinner. Than tidings was brought to the earl of Neuers / and to
all other ingenerall by their scurers / who said. Syrs arm you quyckly that ye
be not surprised / for the turks are coming on you. These tidings greatly
reioysed the christian men / such as desired to do deeds of arms. Than every
man rose fro their dynners and put the tables fro them / and demanded for
their harness and horses / and they were well chafed before with drinking of
wine. Than every man drew in to the field / baners and standerdes dysplayed /
every man to his own baner. Than the baner of our lady was dysplayed /
therewith the valiant knight sir Johan of Vien admyrall of France / and the
french men were the first that drew in to the field fresshely aparelled /
making small account of the turks / but they knew not that they were so
great a nombre as they were / nor that Lamorabaquy was there in his own
person. As these lords of France were into the field / there came unto them
the king of Hungeryes marshall in great have / who was a valyaunte knight /
called Henry of Ostenlenyhall / upon a good horse with a penon of his arms /
of silver a cross sable ancored / called in armure / the iron of a mylstone.
When he came before the baner of our lady he stood still / and (to the most
part of the barons of France) he said openly. Syrs I am sent hither to you
fro the king of Hungery / and he desires you by me / that ye sat not on your
enemies until such time as ye have word again fro him / for it ought to be
doughted lest our scoutes have not brought the certaynte of the nombre of the
turks / but within these two hours ye shall here other tidings / for we have
sent other foreryders forth to auewe our enemies more substancially than the
first did and syrs ye may be sure the turks shall not indomage us / if ye
tarry till all our hole puyssaunce be together. Syrs this is the order that the
king and his counsel has ordered / I must return again to the king.
When he was deperted the french lords assembled the^ together / to know what
was best for them to do. Than it was demanded of the lord Coucy what he
thought best to be done / he answered and said. I would counsel to obey the
king of Hungeryes commandment / for that order seems to be good. And as it
was enfourmed me sir Phylippe of Arthoys earl of Ewe and constable of France /
was not contented that the advise had not first have been demanded of him. Than
he for pride and dispyght held the contrary opinion / and said. ye sir ye /
the king of Hungery would have the flower and chief honor of this journey /
we have the vowarde / he has granted it to us / and now he would take it fro
us again / believe him who will for I do not / and than he said to the knight
that bare his banner / in the name of god and saint George / ye shall seem this
day a good knight. When the lord Coucy herd the constable speak these words
/ he took it done of a great presumpcyon. Than he looked on sir Johan of Vyen /
who bare the standarde of our lady / and demanded of him what he thought best
to be done. Sir quod he where as wise reasone can not be herd / than pride
must reygne / and sithe that the earl of Ewe will needs set on / we must needs
follow / how be it we should be the stronger and if our puyssau^ce were hole
together. Thus as they devised in the field / still the turks aproched / and
the two wings each of.lx. thousand men began to aproche and to close / and
had the christen men between them / so that if they would have reculed they
could not / for they were closed in with the sarazyns / the wings were so
thick. Than diverse knights that were well expert in arms / saw well the
journey should be against them / how be it they auaunced and followed the baner
of our lady / borne by the valiant knight sir John^ of Vien. Every knight of
France was in his cote armure that every man seemed to be a king / they were
so fresshly aparelled. As it was showed me when they began first to fight with
the turks / they were not past a seven hundred men. Lo behold the great folly
and outrage / for if they had tarried for the king of Hungery who were
threscore thousand men / they had been lykely to have done a great act / and
by them and by their pride all was lost / and they received such do^mage /
that sithe the battle of Rounseualx / where as the.xii. peers of France were
slain crystendome received not so great a do^mage how be it or they were
dyscomfyted a great nombre of turks were slain / for the french men
dyscomfyted the first battle of the turks / and had them in chase till they
came in to a valey / where Lamorabaquy was with his hole puyssaunce. Than the
frenchmen would have returned to their host / but they could not / for they
were closed in on all parts. there was a sore battle / the french men
endured long. Than news came to the king of Hungery how the french men /
englysshmen / and almayns were fyghtyng with the turks / and had broken his
commandment and counsel given the^ by his marshall / wherewith he was sore
dyspleased / and not without good cause. Than he saw well how he was lykely
to lose that journey / Than he said to the great master of the Rodes / who was
by him. Sir we shall this day lose the journey by reason of the pride of the
frenchmen / for if they would have believed me / we had been strong enough to
have fought with our enemies. and therewith the king of Hungerye looked behind
him / and saw how his men fled a way and were discomfyted in them self.
Than he saw well there was no recovery / and such as were about him cried
and said. Save your self / for if ye be slain all Hungery is lost / ye shall
lose the field this day / by reason of the pride of the french men / their
valyau^tnesse turns to folyssh hardynes / for they shall be all slain or
taken / none is lykely to escape / therefore sir if ye believe us save your self
/ and escape this danger.

THe king of Hungery was sore dyspleased when he saw how he had lost ye
journey by dysorderyng of the french men / and saw no remedy but to fly or
else be taken or slain. Great murder there was / for in flyenge they were
chased and so slain. They of Hungery fled without order / and the turks
chased them / how be it god aided the king of Hu^gery and the great master
of the Rodes / for they came to the river of Dunce / and found there a little
barge parteynynge to the Rodes / they entered in to it but with seven persons
/ and so went of the shore / or else they had been slain or taken / for the
turks came to the River side / and there slew many a christian man / such as
had followed the king to save them self.

Now let us speak of the french men and almayns who fought valyauntly. When
the lord of Mount caurell a right valiant knight of Arthoys saw that the
dyscomfyture ran upon them / he had by him a son of his a young man / than
he said to a squire of his. Take here my son and lead him away by yonder
wynge which is open and save him / and I will abide the adventure with other
of my fellows. When the child herd his father say so / he said how he would
not depart / but the father did so much that perforce the squire led him away
out of parell and came to the river of Dunce / but there the child had such
care for his father that he took small regard to him self / so that he fell
in to ye river between two barges / and there was drowned without remedy. Also
sir Wyllyam of Tremoyle fought in that battle valyauntly / and there was
slain and his son by him / and sir Johan of Vyen bearing the baner of our
lady was slain / and the baner in his hands. Thus all the lords and knights
of France that were there were distroyed / by the manner / as ye have herd.
Sir Johan of Burgoyne earl of Neuers / was so rychely besene / and in likewise
so was sir Guy de la River / and diverse other lords and knights of Burgoyne /
that they were taken prisoners And there were two squiers of Picardy right
valiant men / called Gyllyam Dew / and the Bourge of Maytequell / these two
by valiantness two times passed through the field / and ever returned in
again and did marueyls / but finally shere they were slain. To say the
truth the french men and other strangers that were there acquyted them
self valyauntly / but the frenchmens pride lost all. There was a knight of
Pycardy called sir Jacques of Helley / who had dwelte before in Turkey / and had
served Lamorabaquy / and could somewhat speak the langage of Turkey when he saw
the battle lost he yielded him self / and the Sarazyns who are covetous of
gold and silver took and saved him. Also a lquyer of Tornasys called Jacques du
Fay / who had before served the king of Tartary called Tauburyn / as soon as
this Jacques knew yt the french men came to make war in Turkey / he took
leave of the king of Tartary and departed / and was on the said field / and
taken prisoner by the king of Tartaries men / who were there in the aid of
Lamorabaquy / for king Tauburyn of Tartary had sent to him great nombre of men
of war.

THe frenchmen were so richely arrayed that they seemed like kings / whereby they
were taken and their lives saved / for sarazyns and turks are covetous / they
trusted to have great raunsomes of these that were taken / and reputed them
greater lords than they were. Sir Johan of Burgoyn earl of Neuers was taken
prisoner. In likewise were the earls of Ewe and de la March / the lord Coucy
/ sir Henry of Bare / sir Guy de la Tremoyle / Bouciquant and diverse other. And
sir Philyp of Bare / sir Johan of Vyen / Willyam of Tremoyle and his son
slain / and diverse other. This battle endured three hours fighting / and the
king of Hungery lost all his baggage and all his plate and iowelles / and was
glad to save him self / but with seven persons with him in a little barge of
the Rodes / else he had been taken or slain without recovery. There were mo men
slain in the chase than in the battle / and many drowned / happy was he that
might escape by any manner of means.

When this dyscomfyture was done and passed / and that the turks such as
were sent thither by the Sowdan were withdrawn in to their lodginges / which
was in to tents and pauylyons that they had conquered / which they found
well replenysshed with wine and meat ready dressed / wherewith they refresshed
them / and made joy and revel / like such people as had ateygned vyctorye on
their enemies. Than Lamorabaquy with a great nombre of mynstrelles acordyng to
the usage of their country / came to the king of Hungeryes chief tent /
which was goodly aparelled and hanged with rich stuff / and there he took
great pleasure / and glorified in his heart of the wynnyng of that journey /
and shanked their god acordynge to their law. Than he unarmed him / and to
refresshe him he sat down on a tapyte of sylke and caused all his great
lords to come to him to iangle and to talk with them. He made as great myrthe
as might be / and said how he would shortly with great puyssaunce pass in to
the realm of Hungery / and co^quere the country / and after other countries
upon the christian men / and to bring them to his obeysaunce / for he said he
was content that every man should live after their own laws / he desired
nothing but the signory / but he said he would reygne like Alysaunder of
Masydone who was twelve year king of all the world / of whose lynage he said
he was dyscended. All yt herd him agreed to his saying. Than he madethre
commandments. The first was that who so ever had any prisoner christian / to
bring him forth the second day after in to his presence. the second was
that all the deed bodies should be vysyted and sertched / and such as were
likely to be noble men to be laid aparte by them self in their raymentes till
he came thither him self / for he said he would se them. The third was to
inquire justly if the king of Hungery were deed or a live. All was done as he
commanded.

When Lamorabaquy had well refresshed him / than to pass the time he went to
ye place where the field was / to se the deed bodies / for it was showed him
that he had many of this men slain / and that the battle had cost him greatly
/ of the which he had great marueyle / and could not believe it. Than he
mounted on his horse and a great nombre with him / he had with him two of his
brethren called Basaache and Surbasaach / as some people said / but he would
not be known of them / for he said he had no brethren. When he came to the
place where the battle was / he found it of truth that there were many deed
and slain / he saw yt for one christian man deed / he found.xxx. turks slain
/ wherewith he was marvelously dyspleased / and openly said. Here has been a
cruel battle and marueyloussly defended of the christian men / but I shall make
them that be a live to bye it derely. Than the king went to his lodging / and
so passed that night in great furour of heart / and in the morning or he was up
much people came to his tente to know what they should do with the christen
prisoners / the renome ran that they should all be put to death without
mercy. Lamorabaquy (for all his dyspleasure) ordained that such christian men as
were in the battle in great a ray / and lykely to be great men / should be all
set together in one part / for it was showed him that they might well pay
great raunsomes. Also there were diverse sarazyns and panyms / of Perce / of
Tartary / of Arabye / and suryens that had many prisoners / by whom they
thought to have great advantage / as they had in deed / they hyd them out of
the way so that they came not to knowledge. Among other sir Jacques of Helley
was brought before Lamorabaquy / he that had him durst not hyde him no longer.
Sir Jacques de Helley was beknowen with some of the kings servants / who took
him fro them that had him / which was happy for him / as ye shall here after /
for many christian men were afterward cruelly slain and put to death.

King Basaach had commanded to inquire which were the greatest of the
christian men / and that they should be set a side / to the intent to save their
lives. So they were tried out and set a part. First the lord Johan of
Burgoyne Earl of Neuers / who was chief above all other / and than sir
Phylyppe of Arthoys earl of Ewe / the earl of March / the lord Coucy / sir
Henry of Bare sir Guy of Tremoyle / and other to the nombre of eight persons.
And Lamorabaquy went to se and to speak with them / and beheld them a long
seasone / and he coniured these lords by their faith and law / to say the
truth / if they were the persons that they named them self for / and they
said ye. And yet to know the more certaynte he sent to them the french
knight sir Jacques of Helley / to know them / for he had served Lamorabaquy
before / therefore he had his life granted him. He was demanded if he knew
the french knights prisoners. He answered and said / I think if Ise them I
shall know them. Than he was commanded to go and auewe them / and to show
plainly their names. He did as he was commanded / and when he came to them /
he showed them his adventure / and how he was sent thither to know surely
their names. Than they said. Ah sir Jacques / ye know us all / and ye se well
how fortune is against us / and how we be in danger of this king / therefore
to save our lives make us rather greater than we be in deed / and show the
king that we be such men able to pay great raunsomes. syrs quod he so shall I
do / for I am bound thereto. than this knight returned to Lamorabaquy and to
his counsel / and syd how those knights which he had spoken with / were
of the greatest men in all France / and were of the Kings lyngage / and said
they were able to pay great raunsomes. Than Lamorabaquy said how their lives
should be saved / and all other prisoners to be slain and hewn all to pieces /
in example of all other. Than the king showed him self before all the people
that were there assembled / to whom they all made low reverence. They made a
lane for him to pass thorough / every man with his sword naked in his hand /
and so came thither where the said lords of France stood together. Than the
king would se the correction of the other / which thing the sarazyns were
desirous to do.

THan they were all brought before Lamorabaquy naked in their shyrtes / and he
beheld them a little and than turned fro them ward / and made a sign that
they should be all slain / and so they were brought through the sarazyns / that
had ready naked swords in their hands / and so slain and hewn all to pieces
without mercy. This cruel justice did Lamorabaquy that day / by the which mo
than three hundred gentlemen of diverse nacyons were tourmented and slain for
the love of god / on whose souls Jesus have mercy. Among other was slain sir
Henry Dantoigne of Heynalt / and so it was the lord Boucyquante marshall of
France was one of them that was brought naked before the king / and had been
slain with other / and the earl of Neuers had not espied him. As soon as he
saw him he went straight to the king and kneled down / and desired him
effectuously to respyte fro the death that knight sir Boucyquant / saying how
he was a great man in France / and able to pay a great ransom. Lamorabaquy
condyscended to the request of the earl of Neuers / and so sir Boucyquant was
set among them that should be saved. Thus cruel justice was done that day
upon the christian men / and because that Lamorabaquy would that his vyctory
should be known in France / he appointed out three of the french knights to
come before him where of sir Jacques of Helley was one. Than the king demanded
of the earl of Neuers which of tho three knights he would chose to send in to
France to the king and to the duke of Burgoyne his father. Than the earl of
Neuers said / sir and it please you I would that this knight sir Jacques of
Helley should go thither fro you and fro us. So sir Jacques tarried with
Lamorabaquy and the other two knights delivered to death and so slain /
which was pytie. Than Lamorabaquy was well apeased of his furoute / and
understood how the king of Hungery was escaped away a live. Than he determined
to return in to Turkey to a city called Burse / and so he did and thither all
ye prisoners were brought / and than his army departed / and specially such as
were of far countries / as Tartary / Perce Mede / Sury / Alerandre / and of
Lecto. than sir Jacques Helley was delivered to return in to France / and he
was commanded to return through Lombardy / and to recommaunde Lamorabaquy
to the duke of Myllayne / and also he was streyghtly commanded that in every
place as he passed / to manifest and publisshe the victory that Lamorabaquy had
upon the christian men. The Earl of Neuers wrote to the french king for him
self / and all his company / and to his father the duke of Burgoyne / and to
the duchess his mother. When this knight had his charge as well by writing as
by credence / he departed and took his way toward France. Or he departed he
was sworn and promised as soon as he had done his message in France /
incontinent to return again thither / which oath and promise he
aco^plysshed like a true knight. Now we will leave speaking at this time of
Lamorabaquy and of the lords of France prisoners / and we will speak of other
matters that fell the same season.

Of the poverty and mysery that the christian knights of France and other
nacyons endured / in the coming home to their countries. Cap. CC.xviii.
AFter this great dysco^fyture that the turks had upon the christian men / such
Knights as could save them self did. The same mondaye there was a three
hundred knights and squyers that were gone a foragynge / and were not at the
battle / for when they knew (by them that fled) that the battle was done
/ they had no desire to return again to their lodginges / but fled as well
as they might and took diverse ways to fly fro ye turks. There fled both
frenchmen / englisshmen / almayns / scotts / Flemynges / and of other nacyons
/ and they came in to a country ioynynge to Hungery called Blacquy / it was a
country replenysshed with diverse people / they were conquered upon the turks
and turned perforce to the christian faith. The kepers of the ports / towns /
and castles suffered these christian men to enter and to lodge / but the next
morning at their departure they took fro these knights and squyers all that
they had / and gave them poor cotes / and a little slyuer to pass therewith
one days journey. This grace they showed to the gentlemen. And as for other
yeomen and varlettes they were spoiled all naked and sore beaten and yuell
entreated without pytie. So they passed through the country of Blacquy in
great pouerte / and through Hu^gery / they could scant get breed for goddessake
/ nor lordgyng at night. they endured this danger in passing till they came
to Vyen in Austrich. There they were received more swetely / and refresshed and
new cladde / and so through the realm of Boesme / For if they had found
the Almaygnes so hard / they had never turned again / but rather dyed for
cold and hunger. Every man that herd them tell of that adventure had pytie
on them. So finally they came in to France to Paris / and there showed their
adventures. At the beginning they could not be believed. Some in Paris said.
It is pytie these unthrifts be vnhanged or drowned / for tellyng of such lies
How be it these tidings daily multiplied with resortyng of new men. When the
french king understood that these news daily renewed / they were nothing
pleasant to him for it was a great do^mage of the loss of the noble men of
his blood / and of other good knights and squyers of the realm of France.
Than he commanded no man to be so hardye to speak any more of that matter /
till he were better enfourmed of the certentie / and commanded that all such
as were come out of Hungery / should be taken and put in prisone till the
troth were known. So there were many put in to prison. And the king had
ordained / that if the new were not true / that they should be all drowned
and put to death.

How the true tidings of the battle in Turkey was known in the French
kings house. Capi. CC.xix.
SO it was on Christe^mas day / sir Jacques of Helley about the hour of noone
entered in to Paris / and so took his lodging / and demanded where the king
was / and it was showed him that he was at saint Poules on ye river of Seyn
Than he went thither. There was with the king the duke of Orlyaunce his brother
/ the duke of Berrey / the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone / and therle
of saint Poule and diverse other noble men of the realm of France / as the
usage was for such noble men to be with the king at such high feestes. So
sir Jacques of Helley entered in to the court boted and spurred. As than he was
not be known / for he had of long time hau^ted far countries. He did so
much that he came to the kings chamber / and said / how he came fro
Lamorabaquy out of Turkey / and had been at the battle before Nicopolye /
where the Christen men had lost the journey. And said he had letters fro the
earl of Neuers / and fro other lords of France / such as were prisoners.
than he was brought to the king. He kneled down / and wisely declared his
message / as well fro Lamorabaquy / as fro the earl of Neuers / and other
lords of France prisoners in Turkey. the king gave him audyence / and was
swetely examyned of all the hole matter / and to every thing he answered so
discretely / that ye king was well content with him / and was right soroufull
for the do^mage that ye king of Hugry and they had sustained / How be it they
were glad that the king of Hungery was escaped / without death or prisonment /
for they said he should recover right well again the loss and do^mage that
he had received at that time. Also they were right joyful that the earl of
Neuers and the other lords were escaped the death / and were but as prisoners
And they sade there was no doubt but they should be raunsomed and delivered.
For sir Jacques of Helley said / there was no doubt but that Lamorabaquy would
within ye year put them to rau^some / for he loved gold and richesse. And that
sir Jacques said / he knew well / because he had long ben conuersaunt in Turkey
/ and served Lamorabaquyes father more than three year. Thus the king right
well received this knight / and so did all other lords / such as were there.
And every man said he was happy in this world to be in such a battle / and
to have the acquayntaunce of such a hethan king / as Lamorabaquy was /
saying it was an honor for him and for all his lynage. than the king
commanded all such as were in prison to be delivered / whereof they were
glad.

THus these news that sir Jacques of Helley had brought / spredde anon a broad
in France and in other places. many were right soroufull for the loss of
their fathers brethren husbands / and children / and not without good cause /
and specially ye great ladies of France / as the duchess of Burgoyne for her
son the earl of Neuers / and her daughter Margarete of Heynault was soroufull
for the earl her husband. In likewise was dolorous Mary of Berrey countess of
Ewe for her husband the lord Philyppe of Arthoise constable of France. And
in likewise so was the countess of March / the lady of Coucy / and her dought
of Bare / the lady of Sully / and many other ladies / as well of France as of
other places. And when they had wept enough / than they reconforted them
self / in that they were natte slain / but prisouers. But such as knew
their husbands / fathers / brethren / children / and fre^des deed / their
lame^tacions endured long in France. The duke of Burgon made much of this
knight sir Jacques of Helley / who had brought him word that his son was a
live / and gave him many rich gifts / and retained him as one of his knights
with two hundred pound of revenues yearly during his life. The French king
and all other lords gave largely to this knight. Tha^ he showed how he must
needs return again to Lamorabaquy / for that was his promise at his
departing / for he stood but as prisoner: and said / how he had not
returned / but to do this message fro Lamorabaquy. The king and other thought
it but reasonable / that he should keep his promise. Than the king and other
wrote to these prisoners. And it was concluded by counsel / that the French
king should send a knight of honor to Lamorabaquy / to thentent that he might
return again to bring new tidings / in what case the prisoners were in.
There was appointed to go in this voyage sir John^ of Castle morant / who was a
wise knight and well languaged. Than it was demanded of sir Jacques what
iowelles or presents the king might best send to Lamorabaquy / and that
should best please him / to the intent that the prisoners should be the better
entreated. The knight answered / that Lamorabaquy took great pleasure in clothes
of arras / made of old ancient hystories. And also he said / he had great
delight in these white Faucons / called Gerfaucons. Also he said / that fine
lynnen clothes and fine scarlettes were much made of there / for of clothe of
gold and sylke they had plenty. This pleased well the French king and the
duke of Burgonoe / whose minds were set to please Lamorabaquy. Thus a.xii.
days sir Jacques of Helley tarried at Paris / and every man was glad to here
him report of ye adventures of Turkey / and of the manner of Lamorabaquy.

When he deperted to return / the king said to him. Sir Jacques / take your
way and make but small iourneys at your ease. I think ye will return by
Lombardy and speak with the duke of Myllayne / for there is great amyte between
him and Lamorabaquy. But which way so ever ye go / we will that sir Johan of
Castle Morant abide in Hungry till ye have got him a saueconducte to go to
Lamorabaquy / with such presents as we shall send him / to the intent that
he should be the more favorable to the prisoners. Sir quod he / all this shall be
done. So he departed and took the same way he came. Anon after his departure
/ the king and the duke of Burgoyne did prepare for these presents / and sir
Johan of Castle Morant dispatched and had his charge. He had with him six
so^mers laden with prese^tes / two of them with clothes of arras / of the
goodlyest that could be got wrought with the story of Alexandre of his life
and conquestes / right pleasant to behold. other two so^mers were charged
with fine scarlettes white and reed. And also with much pain / the king gate
of these white gerfaucons. Thus sir Johan of Castle morant departed fro Paris
with his presents and charge / a fyftene days after that sir Jacques of Helley
was departed. In this mean season the king of Hungry returned in to his
country / whereof all his people were right joyful for they loved him / and so
came and conforted him / and said. Sir / though ye have had do^mage at this
time / another time ye shall right well recover it. Thus the king bare his
do^mage as well as he might. On ye other part / Lamorabaquy returned in to
his country / and came to a town called Burse and thither were all the
prisoners brought / and there set under sure keeping. They were nothing there
at their ease. The heat of the country and dyette sore changed them / for
they had been used before to sweet and delycate metes and drinks / and had
their own cooks and officers that did prepare their meats according to
their dyettes: and there in Turkey they were sarued all contrary / with gross
meats / flesh yuell sodden and dressed. They had spyces enough / and bredde
made of milk / clean fro the nature of France. They had wine and that was
with great danger. Though they were all great lords / they were but smally
regarded there. The turks had as live they had been sick as hole / and deed
as a live. they would they had been all put to execusyon. So these prisoners
conforted each other within themself for they saw none other remedy. so some
of the^ their nature changed and fell in to sickness. He that made the best
chere and countynaunce was the Earl of Neuers / and that he did to conforte
his companyons. also sir Bouciquant and the earl of March and sir Henry of
Bare were of good conforte / and took every thing patiently / Saying that the
honors in arms nor the glory or this world / could not be had without
pain / and sometime with metyng of hard adventures. For they said that there
was never so valiant and happy / that had always every thing as they wysshed.
They said they were bound to thank god that he had saved their lives /
consydringe the displeasure that Lamorabaquy and his counsel were in / for
the loss of their men / for it was ones determined that we should all
generally have been put to death. Than Bouciquaunt said / I ought above all
other to thank god of my life / for I was at the point to have be^ hewn all
to pieces / as other of my company were / but at the request of my lord here /
the earl of Neuers I was saved. This adventure call I good / and sith god has
delivered us fro this paryll / he will and it please him deliver us fro a
greatter / for we be his soudyers / and for his sake we have this pain / For
by reason that sir Jacques of Helley is gone in to France / I trust within a
year we shall have good comfort / and be delivered. The matter can not abide
thus. The French king and the duke of Burgoyn will not forgette us / but by
some means / raunsomed and delivered.

THus sir Boucyquaunt reconforted him self / and took every thing in good
pacyence / but the lord Coucy could take no comfort / which was marueyle for
before that time he was a lord of great wisdom and of great coniorte / and
never was abashed. but being thus in prison in Burse in Turkey / he was more
disconforted than any other / and in more malencoly / And said he was sure he
should never return in to France. Sir Henry of Bare conforted him as much
as he might / and blamed him of his disconforte / saying how he ought to give
conforte to all other. How be it the same sir Henry was sore abashed in him
self / and oftentimes remembered his wife and would weep pituously. And in
likewise so did sir Philyppe of Arthoise earl of Ewe and constable of France.
Sir Guye of Tremoyle was of good conforte / and so was the earl of March.
Lamorabaquy was content / sometime that they should have some pastyme / and
sometime he would go him self and se them / and iangle and bourde with them
right graciously / and would that they should se part of his estate and
puyssaunce. Now let us leave somewhat to speak of them and speak of sir
Jacques of Helley and sir John^ of Castle Morant / who were both ryding
toward Hungry.

SIr Jacques of Helley tarried in the city of Bode in Hungry about a ten or.xii.
days / abydinge for sir Johan of Castle morant / And when he was come sir
Jacques was joyful / for he was desirous to pass forth in to Turkey / to
acquyte him of his faith and promise / and to se the earl of Neuers and the
lords of France / and to comfort them. When the king of Hungry saw sir
John^ of Castelmorant he made him good chere for the love of ye french king /
and he understood that the french king had sent by him great prese^tes and
iowels to lamoraba^ wherewith he was sore displeased in his mind / but he
dissymuled the matter / and kept it covert till sir Johan Heley was departed in
to Turkey ward / but he said to such of his priuye counsel as he discovered
the matter unto / How that the miscreant dog his adversary Lamorabaquy should
have no prese^tes out of France / nor fro no place else / if it lay in his
power to let it. Sir John^ Helley was departed / and promised to get of
Lamorabaquy a saueconducte for sir Johan Morant / to pass in to Turkey and
repasse. So long he trau^yled with guydes / that he came in to Turkey to the
city of Burse / but as than Lamorabaquy was in another city called Poly. And
where so ever he went the prisoners were carried with him / except the lord
Coucy who tarried still at Burse / for he could not endure to ride / he was so
sick / and with him tarried a cosyn of his of Greece a right valyant barone /
descended of the lynage of the dukes of Austriche / who was called Mathelyn.
When sir Jacques was come to Poley Lamorabaquy was glad to se him / because he
was come out of France. Than sir Jacques right humbly said to him. Right dear
and redouted sir / behold here your prisoner to the best of my power / I have
don your message ye ye gave me in charge to do. Than Lamorabaquy said / thou
art welco^e Thou have trewly acquyted thy self / and therefore I acquyte the
of thy ransom and prison / so that thou may go / return / and tarry at thy
pleasure: whereof sir Jacques right humbly thanked him. Than he showed how the
french king and the duke of Burgoyne had sent a knight of honor embassade
to him with crede^ce / and had brought with him certain presents of pleasure
fro the French king. Lamorabaquy demanded what they were / and if he had seen
them or not. The knight answered sir / I have not seen them / but the knight
that has ye charge to do the message is at Bode in Hungry. And sir / I am come
before to show you thereof / and to have a saueconducte for the said knight to
come and to return safely. Than Lamorabaquy said. We will that he have one /
as thou will deuyse / whereof the knight thanked him. So they departed as at
that time. Another time sir Jacques spoke with Lamorabaquy and kneled down
before him and humbly required that he might se the lords and knights of
France / for he had diverse things to say to them out of their country.
Lamorabaquy studied a little or he answered / and at last said. Thou shalt
speak with one of them / but with no mo / and so sent for the earl of Neuers
alone / and when he was come sir Helley kneled down to him. Therle was glad to
se him / and demanded how the french king and the duke his father / and the
duches his mother did. The knight showed him all that he knew / and all that
he was charged to say to him / how be it they had not so good leysar to talk
together / as they would have had / for Lamorabaquyes men that were there
present badde them have done / for they said they had other things to do /
than to stand there and wait upon them. Than sir Jacques demanded of the Earl
how all the other lords of France did. The Earl said they were all in good
case / except ye lord of Coucy / who was somewhat diseased / and was at the
city of Burse. Than sir Jacques showed him how sir Johan of Castle morant was
come out of France / fro the king and fro the duke of Burgoyne in ambassade to
Lamorabaquy / and to assuage his ire / he has sent him rich iewelles and
presents / but he is at Bode in Hungry with the king there / and I am come
before for a saueco^duct for him to come and go / the which Lamorabaquy has
granted. And I think I shall return to him shortly. Hereof therle was right
joyous / but he durst make no semblant for fear of the Turks but said. sir
Jacques I understand by you / that ye are quyte of your ransom and prison /
and that ye may return when it pleases you in to France / when ye come
there / I pray you show the king and my father that we all desire them / to
treat as shortly as may be for our delyueraunce / by some merchants
genowayes or venisyons / and agree at the first word to that Lomorabaquy shall
desire for our rau^some / for if they should make long treaty with him / we
shall be lost for ever. for I understand Lamorabaquy is true of his word /
curtesse and short in all his matters / so he be taken at the point.

Thus the earl of Neuers and sir Jacques departed. When the saueconducte was
ready it was delivered to sir Jacques. Than he took his leave of Lamorabaquy /
and of other of his court of his aquayntaunce / and rode so long by his
iourneys / that he arrived at Bode in Hungry. Than he drew to sir Johan
Moraunt / who thought long for him. Than sir Jacques said. sir / I have brought
you a saueconducte to go in to Turkey / and all your company / and to return
again at your pleasure. I am glad thereof quod the knight. Let us go to the
king of Hungry and show him thereof / and than to morrow betymes let us
depart / for I have tarried here long enough. Than they both together went
to the king in to his chamber / and showed him all the matter. The king than
answered and said. Sir Johan Moraunt and ye Helly / ye be welcome / ye shall
go at your pleasure / for the love of my cosyns of France / to whom I would
be glad to do pleasure / and to you also. ye may go and come through my
realm at your pleasure / and also in to Turkey if ye please: But as for your
presents that you sir Johan have brought out of France / I will not agree
that ye shall convey them to that hell hounde Lamorabaquye / He shall never be
enryched therewith. It should turn to our great shame and rebuke / if he
should make his auauut / that because he has had victory on us / and has in
danger and prison certain lords of France / that for fear thereof / there
should be sent to him rich presents: as for the Gerfauco^s I care not for /
for fowls fly lightly out of one country in to another / they are soon
given and soon lost / But as for rich hangynges of arras are things to be
seen and to endure for ever. Wherefore sir Johan Morant / if ye will pass in to
Turkey with your ger fauco^s go when it please you / but as for any other thing
ye shall have non with you: tha^ the knight answered and said. Certainly sir
it should not be mine honor / nor pleasant to the French king / nor to the
lords that have sent me hyder / without I might acco^plysshe my voyage / as I
have in charge. well quod the king / ye shall have none other way of me at
this time. So the king went fro them and left the two knights speaking
toguyder. They were sore troubled with the abusyon on the king of Hungery.
Than they counsayled toguyder / what was best for them to do. Than they
determined to send hastye messangers to the french king and to the duke of
Burgoyne / sith they saw they could have none other remedy / they wrote
letters to the king and to the duke of Burgoyne / that they should provide for
the matter. They sent their letters by post / to make the more have / and
tarried still them selfs at Bode with the king of Hungry / abiding the return
of their messanger.

THis messanger spedde so well / and made such dilygence / that he came to
Paris / and there found ye king and the duke of Burgoyn / and there showed his
le^^s and they were reed at length / with the which they were nothing pleased
/ and had marueyle that the king of Hungry would not suffer his presents to
pass through his country in to Turkey. The duke of Berrey excused the king
of Hungry and said / how he had good cause to do as he did / for it is a
thing to humbly done for the king to send such presents to an hethan thing.
the duke of Burgoyne / because the matter touched him / he was of the contrary
opinyon / and said it was a thing reasonable so to do / since that fortune has been so favorable to him to have the vyctorie in such a battle / and has
had the king of Hungry in chase and has taken prisoners / all such noble
men as were against him in that journey / wherefore the fre^des of those
prisoners may well find the means how to comfort them for their
delyueraunce. This dukes words were up holden with the king and with diverse
of his counsel. Than the king demanded of his uncle of Berrey? Saying /
fair uncle / if Lamorabaquy the soudan or any other hethan king send you a
ruby or a rich jewel / wheder will ye receyne it or not. Sir quod he I would
take advise. Than yt king said / It passes not yet ten year / sithe the
soudan sent you a ruby which cost twenty thousand frankes. So the king of
Hungries deed was not susteygned / but it was said that he had yuell done to
stop the going of these presents / and that it should rather hinder the
prisoners than auaunce the^. Than the king was cou^sayled to write to ye king
of Hungry amyable letters / desyringe him not to stop his knight / but suffer
him to pass in to Turkey with his prese^tes and message. Than letters were
written / sealed / and delivered again to the same messa^ger / and so he
departed to return in to Hu^gry.

How the duchess of Orlyaunce daughter to the duke of Myllayne was had in
suspecte of the French kings syckenesse. Cap. CC.xx.
YE have hard here before / how the French king lightly every year was sore
enclyned to fall in to a fra^sey / so that there was another Phisycion nor
surgion that could remedy him. Many said they would help him / but whan^e it
came to the point all their labor was in vain / for the kings sickness
would not cease another for prayers nor for medycins / till it had ron his full
course. Some of his phisycions and arioles and charmers / when they saw no
remedy / than they said surely / how the king was poisoned or be wytched / by
craft of sorcerye / which noise made the lords and other / to have many in
suspecte. And some of these nigromancers affyrmed that the kings sickness
came by reason of sorcery and charms. And to make the^ believe it was so / they
said they knew it by the spyrites / who had showed it to them. Of these deuins
/ arioles and charmers / there were certain burnt at Paris and at Auignon.
They spoke so much and said / that the duchess Valentyne of Orlyau^ce /
daughter to the duke of Myllayn had witched the king / to the intent to
attain to the crown of France. They had so sclaundred this lady / ye brute
ran through the realm / that she used such crafts of sorcery / saying: that
as long as she was about the king / and that he might se her / the king should
not amend. So it behooved this lady to avoid this sclaunder / and to fly fro
the paryll thereof / to depart fro Paris / and so she went to Asyners a fair
Castle nere to Pontoyse / perteyning to her husband the duke of Orlyau^ce.
And afterward she went and dwelt at Newcastell on the river of Loyre /
parteynynge to her husband / who was sore displeased in his heart / that such
a brute ran upon his wife / how be it he dissymuled the matter as well as he
might. Nor did not absent him self fro the court / for he had much business
for the matters of the realm. The duke of Myllayne called Galeas / was well
informed how his daughter the duchess of Orlyaunce was accused / whereof he
was sore displeased. And he sent twyse or thrice ambassadors to the French
king and his counsel / and offered to find a knight to fight at vttrau^ce /
with any man that would accuse his daughter of any trayson. And the messa^gers
in a manner thretned that ye duke would make war in to France / because the
french king being in good health (at Balyngham / bitwene saint Omers and
Calis) said that as soon as he were returned in to France / he would entende
to nothing / but to make war upon the duke of Myllayne. And also the king of
England / who as than called him self his son / because he had married his
daughter / promised to send him a thousand speres and six thousa^de archers
/ whereof the french king was right joyful. Prouisyon was made for the French
king in the county of Sauoy and in ye Dolphenry. The kings mind was to enter
that way in to Lombardy / to make war on the duke of Myllaygne. But that
journey took none effect. For when tidings was brought in to France of the
disconfyture of the battle before Nicopoly in Turkey / and of ye death and
taking of the lords of France / The king and the duke of Burgoyne were so
charged and busyed in that behalf / that the journey in to Lombardy was
defected. And also they saw well yt the duke of Myllayne was in favor with
Lamorabaquy / so that they durst not displease him / and so let him alone.

How the duke of Burgoyne and the duchess his wife took great dylygence / to
find the means to redeem out of prisone the earl of Neuers their son / and
the other prisoners being in Turkey. Cap. CC.xxi.
THe duke of Burgoyn and the duches studied all the ways they could deuyse /
by what manner or tretye they might get their son out of prysone / they
knew well or they could have him they should be feign to pay for him a great
ransom. they mynisshed their household and kept a meaner estate / and
gathered as much gold and silver as they could / for without that / they
could not bring about their purpose. And they gate them aquayntauuce with
merchants venycience and genouoys / and such other / for they thought by
their means they should the rather come to their purpose. the duke of Burgoyne
lay still at Paris with the king his nephue / and had the chief governance
of the realm / whereby his business had the better effect. The same seasone
there was at Paris a merchant of Turkey / who had all the doing for all other
Lombardes / he was known and spoken of through out all the world / his name
was called Dyne of Responde / and by him all exchaunges were made. He was in
good favor with the king and other lords before this journey in Turkey / but
than after the battle he was much more made of. Often times the duke of
Burgoyne demanded of him counsel how he might enter in to treaty with
Lamorabaquy / for the redemption of his son and of the other prisoners in
Turkey. Sir quod this merchant / little and little some means will be found.
Sir / the merchants of Gennes and of other isles are known over all / and
occupyeth the trade of marchau^dyse in Quayre in Alexandre / in Da^mas / in
Danuet / in Turkey / and out in far countries hethan / for as ye know well
marchaundyse flies over all the world. Sir / let the king and you write
amyably to them / and promise them great benefytes and profytes / if they
would do for you. There is nothing but it is overcome with gold and silver.
And also sir the king of Cyper / who has had no war with the king
Lamorabaquy / he may right well aid you. Sir / as for me ye may be sure I will
do what I can / for I am bound thereto. It is not to be marueyled though the
duke of Burgoyne and the duches sought out ways how they might recover again
their son / for he was their heir / therefore it touched the^ right nere. The
ladies of France took great sorrow for their husbands and lovers / specially
the lady of Coucy could not forget her husband / she wept pytuously night and
day and could take no comfort. The duke of Lorayne and sir Henry her two
brethren came to saint Gobyn to se and to recomforte her / as much as they
might / and they said they would send in to Turkey to know how he did / for
they said they understood how he had a more gentle prisone than any of his
fellows had. The lady Coucy thanked greatly her two brethren for their
counsel and great comfort. Than she desired sir Robert Den a valiant knight
of Cambresys / to take the pain to go in to Hungery and in to Turkey / to se
what condycyon her husband the lord of Coucy was in. The knight said for her
sake he was content to go thither / and to bring the certaynte of his estate.
Thus he made him ready and five persons with him. Other ladies in France sent
in like wise to know what case their husbands were in.

YE have herd here before / how the king of Hungery would in no wise consent
that sir Morant should pass into Turkey with the french kings presents /
and in this opynion the king long continued / which was right dyspleasaunt
to sir Morant and to sir Helley / but they could not amend it. And so it
happed yt the great master of the Rodes came in to Hungery to the city of
Bode / to whom the king made good chere / whereto he was bound / for the day
of the battle the king had been slain or taken and he had not ben / and there
he found these two knights of France. They came to him and showed him how
the king would not suffer them to pass in to Turkey / with such presents as
the french king had sent to Lamorabaquy / whereof he had marvel / and said
how he would speak to the king therein / and that they should well know / and
so he did / and showed to the king such reasons that he turned the kings
opynion / and so than they had leave to pass in to Turkey with all their
presents. and so they passed forth under sure safe conduct and came to
Lamorabaquy / who received them and their gifts right honorably / after their
usage / and made great joy of the presents. The knights for all yt spoke but
ones all only with the earl of Neuers at good leysare / and at their
departing the earl said to them. Syrs / I require you recommaunde me to my
lord my father and to my lady my mother / and to my lord of Berrey / and
specially to the king / and salute fro me all my other friends / and desire
them that if Lamorabaquy will set us to ransom / that by means of
merchants or otherwise / our raunsomes may be quyckly paid / and we
delivered / for by long taryenge we shall lose / for in ye beginning we were
but.viii. prisoners / and now we be.xvi. which is in all.xxiiii. and we shall
not be delivered without we be delivered all at ones / and as soon all as one
/ for Lamorabaquy has so promised / and surely he will not be found false of
his word. sir Morant and sir Helley answered and said / how his
commandment should be done / to the which he was bound. So they departed
and returned in to Hungery / and by the way they encountered the messanger that
was sent in to France to the king / bringynge a gain letters fro the french
king to the king of Hungery. Than this messanger returned again with them /
for he had no more to do when he saw them return / and had done their voyage
into Turkey / and so returned all together in to France.

How the duke of Gloucestre subtelly sought out the means / how to dystroye
king Richard of England his nephue. Cap. CC.xxii.
IT is long sith I spoke of the duke of Gloucestre / youngest son to the king
of England Edward the third / I had no time to speak of him till now / and
because his heart could never love the french men / therefore of the loss that
the french men had in Turkey / he was rather glad than sorry. The same
seasone he had a knight with him called sir Johan Laquyquay / chief of his
counsel (as it was known after) he said to his lord. Sir the fumes and
pride of the french men are well a bated / by reasone of their journey in to
Hungery and Turkey. they be so full of pride and brages that they can come to
no good conclusion of any enterprise yt they take in hand. That is true quod
the duke / and that apered right well / during the war in the days of the
king my father / and of my brother the prince of Wales / for as than they
could never atayne to any journey against the English men / therefore I can
not tell why we should have trewce with them / for if the war were open / and
by reason of our good tytell together / we should now make them better war
than ever was made before. for as now all the flower of chyualry of France is
outher taken or slain / and the men of England desire to have war rather
than peace / for they can better live in war than peace / for in lyenge
still is none advantage. and I swear by god if I may live two year in good
health / the war^ shall be renewed / I will another spare for trewce / respyte /
nor assurance / for in time paste the French men have kept no promise with
us / but have falsely and craftily taken away the heritage of the duchy of
Acquytayn / which was given and delivered by agreement of good treaty of peace
to the king my father / which often times I have showed to the counsel of
France / when we met and comuned together in the fronter of the marchesse of
Calays / but always they florysshed their ente^tes with so sweet words / that
mine opynion was not regarded nor belyued / nouther by the king my nephewe nor
by my brethren / but if there were a good heed king of England / that
desired the war as well as I do / and would put to his pain to recover his
heritage / which craftily and falsely has been taken fro him without any good
title of reasone / he should find in England a hundred thousand archers /
and six thousand men of arms ready aparelled to serve him and to pass the sea / and to put their goods and lives in adventure in his service. But it is
not so / there is no such King in England as now that loves any deeds of
arms / if there were / he would show him self in France. there was never so
good time to make war in France as now / for who soever goes now shall be
fought withal / which is all the desire that englysshmen have in trust of
wynnyng / as they had in time paste in the days of good king Edward my
father / and in my brothers days the prince of Wales. I am ye youngest of all
the brethren of England / but if I may be believed I shall be the first e yt
shall renew the war / and trust to recover the wrongs that the frenchmen
have done to us / and daily do / and all by the simple slothfulness that is a
monge us / and specially our heed the king my nephue / who will now alye
himself by marriage to the french kings daughter / this is no token that he
will make war. his eyes be to heavy / he cares for nothing but for meat and
drink / and rest / and dalyenge with ladies and damoselles. This is no life
for men of war that will deserve to have honor by prowes of deeds of arms.
yet I remember me of the last journey yt I made into France. I think I had in
my company but two thou sand spears and eight thousand archers / and so
passed the sea / and entered in to the realm of France fro Calayeses and so
went a long in to the realm / and found none to with stand me / nor none
that durst fight with me / in like wise so did sir Robert Canoll and sir Hugh
Caurell / and Thomas of Grau^tsome / and sir Phylyppe Gyssarde / and yet they
had not the nombre that I had with me / and yet they were before Paris and
demanded battle of the french king / but they could never be answered /
nor found any person that said any thing to them / and so they rode into
Bretayne / and so a long through the realm of France / fro Calais to
Bordeaux / without having of any battle or rencountre. but I think surely /
who so would now make any such journey they should be fought with all / for
he that calls him self king in France is young / hot / and of great
courage and enterprise / he would surely fight / what end so ever fell thereof /
and that is the thing we desire / for we love nothing so well as to have
battle / for without it be by battle and victory upon the french men (who be
rich) else we shall have no recovery / but suffer with the loss as we have
done ever sithe my nephewe was king of England. This thing can not long
endure in this estate / but at last the realm of England shall perceive the
matter and repent it / for the king takes and shall take and reyse great
tails of ye merchants / wherewith they be not content / and yet they can not
tell where the good becomes. Thus the king enpouereth the realm of England
/ and gives to one and other largely / and there as it is but yuell bestowed /
and his people vyeth the bargayne / which shortly will grow to a rebellyon
within the realm / for the people begin to clater and to murmr thereat /
saying how they will no le^ger suffer nor bear it / he says to stop the
peoples rumure that the trewce ones concluded between him and France / that
than he will make a voyage in to Irelande / and enploye there his men of arms
and archers / and there he has been but with a small conquest / for Irela^de is
no land of great conquest nor profit / the people they are but rude and yuell
/ and a right poor country and inhabytable / and look what is won there in
one year / is lost in another. Laquynay Laquynay quod the duke / all that I
have said is of troth.

THus the duke of Gloucestre devised with his knight with such words and
other / as it was well known after. He hated the king / and could speak no
good word of him / and though he were with his brother the duke of Lancaster /
as one of the greatest rulers of the Realm / he took no care thereof. And when
the king did send for him he would come at his pleasure / and sometime not a
whyt. And when he came to the king / he would be the last should come / and
the first that would depart / and in counsel what he had ones said of his
opynion / he would have it taken and accepted / else he would be displeased /
and sometime take his leave and depart to his manner in Essex called Plasshey /
there was his chief abiding. This duke was a great prince / and might well
spend by year a threscore thousand ducates / he was duke of Gloucestre / earl
of Essex and of Buckingham and constable of England. He was of so marvelous
condycyons / that the king douted him more than any other of his uncles / for
in his words he would not spare nor forbear the king. The king always was
humble and meke to him / and whatsoever he would demand the king would
grant it him. This duke had caused in England to be done many cruel and
hasty iugementes / for he had caused to be beheeded without tytell of any good
reasone that noble knight sir Simon Burle / and diverse other of the kings
counsel. and chased out of England the archebysshop of york and the duke of
Irelande / because they were so nygh of the kings counsel / and laid to
their charge that they had counsayled the king wrong / and led him as they
list / and had spente the revenues of England at their pleasures. This duke
had two brethren / the duke of Lancastre and the duke of york. These two were
ever about the king / whereat this duke of Gloucestre had great envy / and
would say to diverse / as to such as he trusted (as Robert bishop of London
and to other / when they came to him to Plasshey) Friends / my two brethren
ouerchargeth greatly the kings house / it were better they were at home at
their own houses. this duke by subtyle couerte ways / drew to his acorde ye
londoners / for he thought if he might be sure of them / he should sone have
all the rest of the realm to his acorde. This duke had a nephue / son to the
daughter of his elder brother / called Lyonell duke of Clarence / which
daughter was married into Lombardy to the son of sir Galeas duke of Myllayne.
This duke Lyonell dyed in the city of Aste in Piemounte. So this duke of
Gloucestre would gladly have seen his nephue son to ye daughter of the duke
of Clarence / called Johan earl of March / to have been king of England / and
to have had his nephue king Richard deposed / for he said how the king was
not worthy to hold nor to govern the realm of England. This he would say to
them that he trusted / and he did so much that he caused the earl of March to
come to his house / and than and there he dyscouered to him all his intent and
secretnesse and said / how he had determined to make him king of England /
and king Richard to be put down and his wife also / and to be kept in prison
dutynge their lives / and so he desired effectuously the earl to accept his
offer and good will / saying how he would do the best he could to bring it
about / and that he had of his acorde and alyaunce the earl of Arundell and
therle of Warwyke / and diverse other prelates and lords of England. The earl
of March was sore abashed / when he herd the duke his uncle speak such
words / how be it like a young man he dissymuled the matter / and answered
wisely / to thentent to please the duke / and said how he would be glad to be
ruled as he would have him / but he said he would be well aduysed or he
accepted such promise to sone / and would take therein advise and
delyberacyon. And when ye duke of Gloucestre saw the manner of the earl / than
he desired him to keep the matter secret. The earl answered so he would do.
Than therle departed as soon as he could and so went in to Irelande to his
heritage / and after he would never entende to the dukes treaty / but always
excused him self wisely / yet ever he kept the matter secret / for he saw
well the conclusyon should not be good.

IT was said how the duke of Gloucestre sought all the ways he could to set a
trouble in England / and to stir the londoners against the king. So it was
the same year that the truce was made between England and France / to endure
for thyrty year / and that the king was returned again in to England with
his young wife / than the duke of Gloucestre enfourmed the Londoners and said.
Syrs / make ye a request to the king and it shall be reasonable / desire that
seeing he has peace with his enemies / that ye may be frank and fre fro all
subsydies and aids that has been granted this twenty year past / affyrmyng
how they were not granted but during the seasone of the war / for ye syrs
(quod the duke that be merchants are yuell entreated and sore oppressed / to
pay of every hundred florens.xiii. and all these goods are spent in idleness
/ in dau^synge and making of feasts / and eating and drinking / and all ye
pay for / whereby ye be sore traueyled. and show you to the king how ye would
that the realm of England should be governed acordinge to the ancient
customs / and ye may say that when the king has any need or the realm / or
for the honor of the country / and for the defense thereof / how that ye will
be ready to aid it / in such wise that the king and his counsel shall hold
them content. Thus by the setting on of the duke of Gloucestre / the Londoners
and the counsayles of diverse other cities and towns of England / assembled
them together / and on a day came to Eltham a seven mile fro London / where
the king was / and when they came before the King they made a request of all
these foresaid things / and would that it should have been acomplysshed
incontinent. And when this request was made there was with the king no mo of
his uncles but two / the dukes of Lancastre and of york. Than the king
charged the Duke of Lancastre to make them an answer / and than the duke
said to them. syrs / the kings pleasure is that ye depart home every man to
his own / and within a month assemble again together at London or at
Westmynster / and there the king will be with his counsel / and his nobles /
prelates and other / and they they will be ready to here your requests / and
look what shall be thought necessary by his counsel / the king will grant
it you / in such wise that ye shall all be well content. This answer
pleased many of them / but not all / for there were some that were of the
opinyon of the duke of Gloucestre / who would have had a shorter answer / but
the dukes of Lancastre and of york apeased them with fair sweet words / and
so they departed for that time. But for all that they left not their pursuit /
so that the next month after they assembled at Westmynster / there be ynge the
king with his counsel / and than there was present the duke of Gloucestre /
who greatly enclyned to their demaundes / but at making of the answer he
spoke not all that he thought in his heart / but dissymuled the matter / to the
intent that the king nor his brethren should not perceive his mind. Than the
duke of Lancastre made the answer to the londoners for the king and said. ye
syrs of London and other / the king has commanded me to give you a
determynable answer to your requests in his name and his counsel / and by
the consent of other prelates and noble men of his realm. Sirs ye know well
to the intent to eschew all parelles and dangers that might come to this
Realm / there was a general grant made by you and other of the good cities
and towns of England / that there should be raised a tail on the state of
marchaundyse / in manner and form as it has tynne now upon a six year /
that was to pay of every hundred.xiii. and by reason thereof the king granted
and sealed to you certain fraunchesses / the which he is not in mind to take
fro you / but rather to increase it daily acordyng to your deserts. but where
as ye now would repel again that ye ones wyllyngly agreed unto and granted
/ therefore here openly he repelyth again all such graces and grauntes as he
has made to you before this time. Behold here all these noble men and
prelates have sworn and promessed to the king to aid and sustain all
things lawfully given and granted. therefore syrs considre well that the state
of the king is great and chargeable / and if it augment in one manner / it
mynyssheth in another / for the rentes and reuene was turns not to the kings
profit as much as it has done in time paste / the king and his counsel
has been at great cost and charge / sithe the wars renewed between England
and France / and great charge it has been to the king for such ambassadors
as have treated between the parties / as well here as beyond the sea / also
the pursuynge of the kings marriage has cost great goods. And though there be
now peace between the realms / yet the charge is great of keeping of the
garysons in towns and castelles / being under the kings obeysaunce as well
in Gascoyne / Burdeloys / Bayonois / Bygore / and the marches of Gyan and
Calays / also in keeping the sea and the ports and havens of England. in
likewise it is chargeable the keeping of the fronters of Scotland which may
not be unprovided / and also the marchesse of Irelande. All these things and
other consernynge the kings estate and honor of the realm / draws yearly
great cost and charge / which is far better known by the noble men of ye
realm / than by any of you that medeleth but with your marchaundyse. Thank
god^irs that ye be thus in peace / and take heed that none pay without he be
worthy and occupye the feate of marchaundyse / and as well pays the
strangers / as ye do. ye be at a freer mart than they of France or Lombardy
/ or other Realms / whyther as your marchaundyse repayreth / for they be
tayled and retayled again two or three times in a year / and ye pass by a
reasonable ordinance set and assessed upon your marchaundyse.

THese words or such like spoken by the duke of Lancastre apeased greatly the
people / who were set to do yuell / by the setting on of other. Thus they
departed at yt time without any other thing doing / and the most part of
them were well content / and such as would the contrary made no semblante
thereof at that time. The duke of Gloucestre returned to his manner of Plasshey
/ and he saw well as at that time he could not bring his purpose to pass /
but still he studied how to make trouble in England / and to find the ways
how to renew the war in France and he had of his acorde his wyfes uncle
the Earl of Arundell / who desired nothing but war / and they had done so
much that they had drawn to their acorde the earl of Warwyke.

TTHe king of England had two brethren by his mother / one called Thomas
Earl of Kente / and the second sir Johan of Holande a valiant knight / who
had to his wife the daughter of the duke of Lancaster / he was earl of
Huntyngdon and chamberlayne with the king / it was he that slew the son of
Richard earl of stafforde / as ye have herd here before in this history. The
said Richard earl of Stafforde had a squire to his son / who was with the
duke of Gloucestre. This earl of Huntyngdon most commonly was ever in the
court with the king his brother / and he knew more of the dealing of the
duke of Gloucestre than any other did / for couertely and wisely he made
enquery / and also he douted greatly the duke / for he knew he was fell and
sudden / and high minded / and saw how he kept his enemy about him / for
the death of the young Stafforde / and the peace thereof was never made / but
the grudge thereof continued still. The king loved well his brother / and bare
him against every man. and the king saw well how his uncle the duke of
Gloucestre was ever contrary to him / and was ever about to conspyre against
him / and to stir the realm to rebellyon. so the king and his brother of
Holande would often times comune together. The same seasone the french king
had sent the earl of saint Powle in to England to se the king and his daughter
the queen and to norisshe love / for the truce was made in such manner and
co^dycion / that their subgiettes might repair each to other in dyspyte of all
their yuell wyllers. the king and the earl of Huntyngdon made them good chere
/ as well for the honor of the French king / as for that he had wedded
their suffer. At that time the Dukes of Lancastre nor of york were not with
the king / for they began somewhat to dissymule / for they saw well that the
people in England began to murmr in diverse places / on the state and rewle
that the king kept / and that the matters were lykely to go yuell. They thought
they would not be at the kings commandment nor at the peoples. And all this
came by reasone of the duke of Gloucestre and his company. The king of
England spared not to show therle of saint Powle the state that England
stood in / and how he found always his uncle the duke of Gloucestre hard
and rebel against him / and showed him all thing yt he knew. When the earl
of saint powle herd the king say in that wise / he had great marueyle thereof
/ and said how it ought not to be suffered / and said. Sir if ye suffer this /
they will dystroy you / it is said in France how the duke of Gloucestre
entendeth to nothing / but to break the peace and to renew the war again
/ and that little and litell he draws the hertes of young men of the realm
to his part for they desire rather war than peace / so that the ancient
wise men / if the war began to stir / they should not be herd nor
believed / for reason / right / nor justice has no place nor audyence / where
as yuell reygneth / therefore provide therefore rather betymes than to late. it
were better ye had them in danger / than they you. These words of the earl
of saint Powle entered greatly in to the kings heart / and made him sore to
muse / and after that the earl of saint Powle was returned in to France / ye
king of England showed all this matter to his brother the earl of Huntyngdon /
who said to the king. Sir / my fair brother of saint Powle has showed you
the troth / therefore take good advise in this matter.

ANd as I was enfourmed / about a month after that the earl of saint Powle
had been in England and returned in to France / a paryllous fame and renome
ran upon the king in England / and in a manner there was a general brewte
that the earl of saint Powles coming in to England was to treat with the
the king / that the french men might have Calayes in to their hands. This
brute greatly troubled and moved the people in England / in so much that
certain of London roode to Plasshey to the duke of Gloucestre / and showed him
of that matter. The duke apeased not their words / but rather augmented it
more and more. Saying how he could not do therewith / But said he was sure
that the french men would it had cost them all their kings daughters / so
that they might have Calais at their pleasure. This answer set the Londoners a
fire / and said / how they would speak with the king / and show him how
the realm was not content. Well quod the duke show it him in good manner / and
make doubt that the people will not be content. And mark well what answer he
makes / and show me thereof the next time I speak with you / and thereupon I
shall give you counsel what ye shall do farther. It may well be / that there
be some false traitors / counsayleth the King to the same. There is the earl
Marshall who is Capytayne of Calays / who has been two times in France and
tarried at Paris / and he was one of the chief procurers in the treaty for the
kings marriage with the daughter of France. And these French men are right
subtyle / and can drive their purpose a far of / and little and little pursue
their ententes and will give largely to bring about their purpose.

ACordynge to the dukes counsel / the Londoners on a day went to Eltham to
the king / at which time there was the kings two brethren / the earl of
Kent and therle of Huntyngdon / the earl of Salisbury / and the archebysshoppes
of Canterbury and of Duuelyn / his confessor the lord Thomas Percy / the
lord Lysle / Richard Credon / Johan Boulofer / and diverse other knights of
the kings chamber. There these londoners right wisely showed the king their
ententes in a meke humble manner / and said how the brute ran / that the
king was about to deliver up Calais into the French men's hands. The king
had great marvel of these news / for it touched him nere to the heart. But
right sagely he dissymuled the matter for that time / and apesed the Londoners
and said / how all that noise was wrong / for it was nothing so. But for
truth / he said / the earl of saint Poule was come in to England for none
other entente / but to sport him / and was sent thider by the French king /
to se him and the queen his wife: Other marchaundyse the king said there was
none between them / and that the king swear / by the faith that he owed to
god and to the crown of England / and said how he had great marueyle /
whereof such words should rise. Than^e the earl of Salisbury said. Sirs / ye
good men of London. Go home to your houses / and be well assured / that the
king and his Counsel will do nor entende to do any thing / but that that
shall be for the honor and profit of this his realm of England. And who so
ever has first brought up these words are yuell cou^sayled / and show well
how they would gladly have this realm in trouble / and to have the people to
rise against the king / which thing ye of London ought to fear for by reason
of the last rebellyon / ye were in great paryll / to have been all utterly
dystroyed. For when yuell people be up and govern / justice nor reason than
has no place. Those words apeased greatly the Londoners / and were contented
with the kings answer / and so returned to the city of London / And the
king tarried at Eltham right pensive / and full of displeasure / by reason of
the words that he had herd / and had stylle about him his two brethren / and
other such as he trusted best / for he thought him self natte well assured
amogne his uncles / For he saw well how they absented them self fro his
Court / and kept them at home at their own houses / so that he was half in
doubt of them / and specially of the duke of Gloucestre / And so kept daily
about him a guard of a thousand archers.

YT was informed the king of England of a surety / that his uncle ye duke of
Gloucestre and the Earl of Arundell / purposed with puissaunce of people to
take the king and the young queen and to put them in to a castle / there to
be kept surely in an honest manner with meat and drink / and other
necessaries. And also / how there should be set four governors in the realm
/ as the duke of Lancastre and the duke of york to rewle fro the Temmys
northwarde / unto the ryuers of Hu^bre and Thine / and of They ronnyng by the
city of Warwyke / comprehendynge all the signories of Northumberlande / and
the bounds of Scotland. And the duke of Gloucestre had all the rule of London
and of the londoners / and of Essexe / co^prehendyng all the bounds of the Sea
/ and thider where as the river of Hu^bre enters in to the sea: and also of
all the ports and hauyns above London to Hampton / and to Cornwall. And the
earl of Arundell / he to have the rule of the lands mouynge fro London between
Sussexe and Kent / Arundell / Surrey / Deuonshyre / and Barkeshyre / and of all
the hole signories / between the river of Thamyse and Bristowe / and the river
of Syuerne / which departs England and Wales. And they shall hold and do
justice and reason to every man. But their entencyons is / if they can find
any reasonable way to move again and to renew the war between England and
France / and that if ye French king would have again his daughter he should
/ for sith she is but eight years of age / paradue^ture when she comes
to.xii. years she may repent her and refuce her marriage / because she was
married in her youth And also it was no reason to dismary her fro the heyr of
Bretaygne / as it was promised. And if when she comes to perfyte age / that
she will not refuce her marriage / Than she must abide by right still queen of
England / and to have her dowrye / but in no wise she should be crowned Queen.
And that if the king dyed or she came to laufull age / than they purpose to
send her again in to France to her father. This was showed to ye king for
such words were spoken by diverse English men / and specially by the
londoners who could not love the king. And they repented them / that when the
commons of Sussexe / Kent / and Essexe were up / and came to London / in that
they did break their purpose / for as some of them confessed / they were in
mind to have slain the king / the earl of Salisbury / the earl of Oxenforde /
and all the kings counsel. And if they had so done by means of the
rebellyon / the londoners than^e should soon have made a new heed. And by
means of the duke of Gloucestre / to have found some person to have had the
crown and gouernynge of the realm / and thereby to have brought the realm
into a better case than^e it was in as than. Thus the londoners and such other
of their sect / daily murmured and had many secret cou^sayls. All this the
king was informed of / and most fault was laid upon the duke of Gloucestre.

KIng Richard was abashed of tentymes when he herd and saw such covert
hate and yuell will borne against him. Always he made loving countynaunce to
his uncle of Gloucestre and to the lo^doners / but it aueyled him nothing. On a
day the king said to his other two uncles / of Lancastre and of york. Sirs /
on gods name I require you to give me your advise and cou^sayls. I am daily
informed of asuretie / that your brother mine uncle of Gloucestre / the earl of
Arundell / and their complyces / are minded to take me perforce / by the
agreement of the londoners / and purpose to close me in a Castle / and to order
my finding by certain portion / and my wyfes in likewise / who is but young /
and to separate her fro me / and to keep her estate in another place. Fair
uncles / this is a cruel manner and it ought not to be suffered / as long as I
may withstand it. ye have done me homage and sworn to be true to me in the
presence of king Edward of good memory my grau^tfather / at which time all
the great prelates and lords of this realm / swear to keep and maynteyn me as
their king a.xx. year paste. Wherefore fair uncles / for love and charity /
and by the oath and promise that ye have made / counsel me trewly as ye are
bound to do. For as far as I can ymagin / mine uncle of glocestre ente^deth
on none other thing / but how he might renew again the war / bitwene
England and France / And to break the peace / which we have confyrmed /
both you and all other of the realm / by sweryng and sealyng / and by the
same composycion I am joined in marriage to ye daughter of France without
thynkyng of any yuell. and ye know well / that who soever does contrary to yt
he is sworn unto and has sealed to the same / and so proved / does yuell /
and ought to be punisshed therefore / both in body and goods. And also ye
know well yt I forbear mine uncle of Gloucestre as much as I may do / and
take no regard to thretnyng / which might cost me derely. Uncles / ye are
bound to counsel me sith I demand it with reason. and when they herd the
king speak thus / and saw well how the matter sore troubled his mind and that
it touched him nere / and also they know well much of his saying was true /
they said. Sir / suffer and let the time ryn and pass. We know well our
brother of Glocestre has the most paryllous heed and brain / of any manne in
England. But we know well he can do no more than a man may do / if he build
on the one side we shall build on the other / as long as ye will be ordered by
our counsel / ye shall not need to care for our brother. He says often
times many things whereof follows none effect. He all alone / nor they of his
counsel can not break the peace that is taken / nor can not enclose you in
any castle. We shall never suffer that / nor to be separated fro your wife /
For if he say so and think it / he is foul abused. Therefore sir / we humbly
beseech you to apeace your self / every thing shall turn well with gods
grace. All that a man speaks comes not to effect / nor all that he says
oftentimes he can not acco^plysshe. Thus the dukes of Lancaster and york /
apeased their nephewe king Richard.

THese two dukes saw well / that the business of England began to be yuell /
and parceyued that great hatered increased daily between the king and the duke
of Glocestre. And to thentent that they would not entremedell between them /
they departed fro the kings court with all their company and servants / and
so took their leave of yt king for a time / and went to their own. And the
duke of Lancastre took with him his wife the lady Katheryn Ruet / who had been
in company with the young queen of England / and went a huntyng of ye dear: as
the usage is in England / and the king tarried about London. But afterward
the kings uncles repented them that they deperted out of ye court / for there
fell afterward such matters in England / that all ye realm was in trouble /
the which had not so fortuned if they had been about the king / for they would
have found other prouisyon for y^ matter / than they did that counsayled the
king There were none of the kings servants / but that greatly douted the
duke of Gloucestre / and would gladly that he had been deed / they had not cared
how. the gentle knight sir Thomas Percy had been long sovereign squire of the
kings house (that is in France master and seneschall) for all the state of
the king passed through his hands. He than co^sydring the great hatereddes
yt encresed bitwene the king and his uncle of Glocestre / and among other great
lords of England / with whom he was well-beloved. Like a sage knight he
ymagined that the conclusyons could not be good. Tha^ he gave up his office as
honorably as he could / and took leave of the king / and the king gave him
leave full sore against his will / how be it he made such excusacions / that
he departed and another set in his office. The king had as than but young
counsel about him / and they greatly douted the duke of Gloucestre / and
oftentimes would say to the king.

Right dear sir / it is a perylous thing to serve you / for we have seen such
as have served you in times paste / and such as were right synguler in your
favor / yet they have had but small guerdone. Sir Simon Burle / who was a
sage valiant knight / and in good favor with my lord your father / whom
god pardone. He had great pain and traueyle for your first marriage / yet your
uncle the duke of Gloucestour caused him to dye shamefully / his heed to be
stryken of like a traitor before all the world / with diverse other that he
has put to death / as ye know well / for all the puissaunce that ye were of
ye could not save them. And sir / we that sarue you now / look for the same
reward. For when your uncle comes to you / the which is not often / we dare
not lift up our eyes to look upon any person / he looks so hye over us. he
thinks we do him much wrong that we be so nere about you as we be. Wherefore
sir know for truth / yt as long as he lives there shall be no peace in
England / nor ye shall do no man good. Also he thretneth you and yor wife to
close you up in a castle / and there to beholden under subjection / and to
live by portion. sir / ye be a king lost / if ye take not good head to your
self / as for your wife needs not to care / she is young and daughter to the
french king. They dare not displease her / for much yuell might come thereby
in England. your uncle of Gloucestre / to thentent to make you to be behated
with your people / has sown diverse sclau^dorous words upon you throughout
London and in other places / saying / how ye be not worthy to bear ye crown
/ nor to hold so noble an heritage / as is ye realm of England. sithe ye
have taken to your wife the daughter of the french king your adversary. Whereby
he says / ye have greatly febled the signorie and realm of England / and
has sore discoraged the hertes of the noble valyant knights and squiers of
the realm / who have always valyantly co^tynued the war / and yet would do.
Thus they say / that ye have brought the realm in great paryll and adventure
to be lost / affyrmyng / how it is pytie that ye have been suffered to continue
so long as ye have done. Also the Frenchemen bruteth / that ye will put out of
your arms tharmes of France / wherewith the people are not content / and
hates you therefore. And they think it true / because ye were so ready and
glad to take a truce / they think more rather byforce than by love. for the
noble men of ye realm / who have served and maynteyned the wars / never
agreed thereto. Also they say / that ye have not dilygently reuisyted nor
ouersene the letters patentes / given / accorded / sworn and sealed by king
Johan sometime french king / and by his sons / the which grant his children
lyueng / was nothing vpholden but craftily broken. And the Frenchmen found
cautels and subtelties / by wrongefull ways / to renew again yt war. And
thereby took and usurped all the right that your predecessurs had in that
quarrel: and has won thereby / lands and countries in Acquitany / with
cities / castelles / and towns. And all this they say / ye take no head of /
but have lost it thoroughe your negligence / and has showed but poor courage.
and that ye doubt your enemies / and have not pursued the accydentes of the
matter / and the good and just quarrel that ye had / and as yet have: the
which quarrel your predecessors had as long as they lived. First my lord
your father ye prince of Wales and of Ac^tayne / and also good king Edward
your grau^tfather / who took great pain and dilygence to augment their
signories. Thus sir the londoners say / and so does other / that a day shall
come / that ye shall repent you. Therefore sir / we can no lengar hyde these
words fro you / for they be daily renewed.

How the duke of Glocestre was taken by the earl marshall / by the
commandment of the king. Cap. CC.xxiii.
KIng Richard of England noted well these said words / ye which was showed
him in secretenesse / and like an ymaginatyfe price as he was / within a season
after that his uncles of Lancaster and of york were departed out of the court
/ than the king took more hardynesse on him / and said to him self. That
first it were better for him to distroye another / rather than another should
distroye him. thinking that shortly he would have his uncle of Gloucestre in
such case / that he would be assured of him / that he should do him no
displeasure after. and because he could not bring about his purpose alone / he
dyscouered his mind to such as he trusted best: as to therle marshall his
cosyn earl of Notyngham / and showed him his full mind what he would do and
have to be done. The earl marshall (who loved the king better than the duke of
Glocestre did) kept the kings purpose secret / saui^g to such as he would
be aided by for he could not do ye kings pleasure alone. On a day the king in
manner as going a hu^tynge / he rode to Haueryng of Boure / a.xx. mile fro
London in Essexe / and within.xx. mile of Plasshey / where the duke of
Gloucestre held his house. After dinner the king deperted fro haueryng with a
small company and ca^e to Plasshey about.v. a clock: ye weder was fair and
hot. so the king ca^e suddenly thither about the time that the duke of
Gloucestre had supped / for he was but a small eater / nor satte never long at
dinner nor at supper. wha^ he herd of the kings coming / he went to mete
with him in the mids of the court / and so did the duchess and her children
/ and they welcomed the king: and the king entered in to the hall / and so in
to a chamber. Tha^ a board was spredde for the kings supper. The king satte
not long. And said at his first coming. Fair uncle / cause five or six
horses of yours to be sadylled / for I will pray you to ride with me to London
/ for to morrow the londoners will be before us. And there will be also mine
uncles of Lancaster and york with diverse other noble men. For upon the
londoners requests I will be ordered according to your counsel / and
command your steward to follow you with your train to london / where they
shall find you. the duke who thought none yuell / lightly agreed to ye king.
And when the king had supped and risen / every thing was ready. The king than
took leave of the duchess and of her children / and lepte a horsbacke and ye
duke with him / accompanied all only but with seuyn servants / three squyers
and four yeomen / and took the way of Bondelay / to take the plain way /
and to eschew Bre^dwode and London common high way. So they rode a great
pace and talked by the way with his uncle / and he with him / and so aproched
to Stratforde on the river of Thamise. When the king came nere to the busshment
that he had laid / than he rode fro his uncle a great pace / and left him
somewhat behind him. Than suddenly the earl Marshall with his band came
galopyng after the duke / and ouertoke him and said. Sir / I arest you in the
kings name. The duke was abashed with that word / and saw well he was
betrayed / and began to call loud after ye king / I can not tell wheder the
king herd him or not / but he turned not / but rode for the rather faster than
he did before. Now let us leave spekyng of this matter for a season / till
we return thereto again.

YE have herd before in this history / how sir John^ of Castle morant and
sir Jacques of Helley were sent in to Turkey to Lamorabaquy / fro the french
king and fro the duke of Burgoyne / and how they had spedde. When they were
returned in to France / they were welcome to the king and to the duke of
Burgoyne / and to the duches / because they brought certain tidings fro the
earl of Neuers / and fro the lords that were there with him. They said to the
king / how they trusted that Lamorabaquy would gladly treat for their rau^soms
And yt they said they knew by some yt were of his priuye counsel / for they
fear lest they should dye in prisone / because they be out of their own
natural air. And the Turks think that by their delyuerau^ce / they should
have great fynaunce for their ransom. By reason of these words / the king /
the duke of Burgoyne / and the duchess his wife / studied night and day / how
and by what means they might have their son and heir delivered. And said
oftentimes / that the journey and siege before Nicopoly had cost them over
much. For thereby they had deed three brethren bastard knights valiant men
/ whom they entierly loved. The first the Hasell of Flaunders. The second sir
Loyes of Briese. And the third sir Johan of Ipre. There was another the
youngest / who was still at home. To say the truth / ye duches of Burgoyne
countess of Flaunders studied on her side / how to deliver her son. And so
much they stuyed / that at last they found the means to agree with the turks
with much pain. But that was not suddenly done for the matter was such / that
it re^red great leysar / and to be got little and little.

In this same season in the city of Burse in Turkey / dyed ye gentle knight
Frau^ces Anguerant lord of Coucy earl of Saiso^s / he was a great lord in
France / for as sir Robert of Deane (who was sent by the lady of Coucy) was
going to him ward / he herd by the way how he was deed / and that he herd at
Vyen in Austriche. And so he returned in to France / and showed this to
certain of the lord Coucies lynage / but not to the good lady his wife /
until such time as the chatellayne of saint Goubayne was sent to fetch his
deed body enbaulmed in to France / to be buried in thabbey of Nogent beside
Coucy and there he was received by the duchess of Bare and the bishop of Leon
/ and by diverse other abbottes: and there this ge^tyll knight was buried / in
the year of grace a thousa^de three hundred fourscore and seuyntene.

YE may well know that the French king and the duke of Burgoyn always
ymagyned / how to get their friends out of prison in Turkey. Sir Dyne of
Respo^de was always in their cou^sayls / and he said ever that the merchants
venisya^s and genowayes / might well help and aid in that business. For he
said / merchants might go whider they list / and by them might well be known
the dealyng of the turks and tartaries / with ye ports and passages of the
kings soudans and miscreantes / and specially they resorted to Quaire to
Alexandre / to Da^mas / to Antyoche / and in to the great puissaunt cities of
the Sarazins / daily they pass and repasse. And daily merchants christened
has entrecours with the sarazins / and exchange one with a another their
marchaundyse. So the french king and the duke of Burgoyne sought all the
friends and means they could get to forther them: and as than had no
desire to make war upon the duke of Myllayne / because they understood that
he was great with Lamorabaquy. On the othersyde king James if Cypre / thought
well he should have great thank of the French king and of the duke of
Burgoyne / if he might assuage the furour of Lamorabaquy / and bring him to
some good reasonable point / for the redemynge of the lords of France / such
as he had in prisone. And to please them / the king of Cypre caused a ship
to be made of fine gold / right noble and rich / of ye value well to the some
of ten thousand ducates / which ship he sent to Lamorabaquy by his own
knights. This ship was so goodlye and fair / that it was great joy to
behold it / the which gift the soudan took in gree / and sent again to the
king of Cypre the double in value thereof. All this was anon known in France
/ by merchants yt wrote thereof to Dyne of Responde / to the entente that he
should show it to the French king and to the duke of Burgoyn / to have a
thank of the king.

THis king of Cypre had good cause thus to do / for he was in doubt of ye
french kings displeasure / because he caused to be slain and murdered by
night / his brother the valiant king Peter / who did much trouble to the
Sarazins / and took Saptalye and Alexandre. The Sarazins douted him more than
any other king or emperor christened / because of his valya^tnesse of the
which deed this said king James sore repented him self / and knew well he
had done yuell. And after the same deed he fled out of Cypre / or else the
Christen men would have slain him. So he entered in to a galley of Gene / being
at the port of Nicopossie / and so went to Genes and the genowayes received
him. And some said / that he did that foul murdre by the entysement of the
genoways / for anon after the genouois came with puissaunce of men of war
and galyes / and took the city of Famagous and the port / and kept it with
puyssaunce.

This king of Cypre had a fair young son. The Cyprience crowned this child
king / and after his crownyng he lived not long / but dyed soon after. And
aft his death the genouois with great puyssau^ce brought this Jacques in to
Cypre and crowned him king / and so he reigned king of Cypre. And the genowayes
always sustained him against all men / but they would never render up the
City of Famagous nor the port / but held it still at the time that ye
auctour wrote this history. And to say the truth / if the genowayes had not
had it / the Turks had won it long before and all the realm of Cipre / and
had brought it in to their obeysau^ce and by all lykelyhode had subdued the
ysles of Rodes / and all other ysles enclosed in the Sea to Venyce / but
always the genoways and venisya^s resysted them. And when they saw that the
turks had won the Realm of Armony / than they took the strong town of
Corque in Hermyne on the Sea side / and so held it / so that and it had not
ben for dout of the passage and straytes of Corque and of Xere before
Co^stantyne the noble / the turks had sore entered in to Christendom / and
upon the border of the sea / the which should have been great preiudyce to the
ysle of Rodes / and to the ysles adioynyng. Thus by these means the fronters
of Christen dome were kept and defended. Now let us return to our purpose.

THis king Jacques of Cyper who knew him self gylcy of the death of the king
his brother / whereby he had the hatred of all other christian kings / therefore
he did as much as he could do to get again their love and favor / and took
it for a great honor that the french king wrote first to him / for he
douted him most of all / and so he had cause / for the duke of Burbone by right
succession of the lynage of Lusygnan / ought to be king there and his heirs /
for though this king Jacques was brother to the king Peter of Cyper / yet he
had no right to the crown / for he was but a bastard / and all this knew
right well the genouoys / so that when he was made king / there was made a
great alyaunce between them confermed not to be broken / and the genouoys to
defend and keep him and his heirs against all other / and thereby they
atteygned great sygnories and fraunchesses in the realm of Ciper / and all
that ever they did to the exalting of this Jacques king of Cyper was always
for their own chief advantage / and to be strong against the venycians and
to haunte and erercyse their feate of marchaundyse in to the Sarazyns lands.
This king Jacques as long as he lived did what he could to please the French
king / by the means of the genouoys / for they would in no wise dysplease him
/ and therefore the same season this king Jacques ordained this ship of gold
to present Lamorabaquy / to have love and acquayntau^ce with him / which gift
was joyfully received and much praised with the turks / and it was thought
that the lord Dyne of Rresponde was means thereof / and wrote therein to the
genouoys / for in this manner and otherwise he labored all that he might for
the delyueraunce of the earl of Neuers and of the other lords of France.

When the duke of Burgoyne and the duchess his wife saw that Lamorabaquy
began to fall to treaty for the christian prisoners / the news thereof was
greatly to their pleasure / and appointed a sage valiant knight of the county
of Flaunders called sir Gylberte of Linrenghen / who was sovereign of Flaunders
under the duke and duchess. And than they sent for sir Jacques of Helley /
because he knew the ways and passages / and desired him to acompany sir
Gylberte to treat with Lamorabaquy / for the delyueraunce of the christian
prisoners / and promised him that his pain should be well consydred and
rewarded. Sir Jacques promised them so to do. So these two knights departed and
rode so long that they came in to the realm of Hungery / and so drew to the
king / for they had letters to him. The king received them ioyously for love
of the french king / and also he knew well sir Jacques of Helley. There they
showed the king the cause of their coming out of France / and how they were
sent in to Turkey to treat for the delyueraunce of the earl of Neuers / and
the other lords of France / if Lamorabaquy would give them the herynge. The
king said it was well done to redeem them if they might be put to ransom /
and said in the assayenge thereof they could lose nothing. besides that the
king offered them his body and goods to aid them in all manners. Whereof these
two knights thanked him. To enter in to this treatye with Lamorabaquy / or
they could come thereto / these knights had much pain and made great
d^^yge^ce / for first sir Jacques of Helley was feign to go to Lamorabaquy to
require a safe conducte for his companyon sir Gylbert to come in to Turkey. And
when he had ateyned it / than he returned in to Hungery / and so they rode than
into Turkey. The sovereign of Flaunders was received of Lamorabaquy and of his
men right nobly / and was herd speak / and so little and little they entered in
to their treaty. the same time there haunted in to Turkey a merchant genouoy
of the isle of Sio / under the obeysaunce of the genouoys. This merchant was
named Bartylmew Pologrine / and he was well be loved in Turkey / and namely
with Lamorabaquy. Sir Dyne of Responde being at Paris / to thentent that this
treaty might have the better e^pedyciones he wrote letters to this said
merchant of the isle of Sio / for they knew each other / and to the intent to
please the french king / the duke of Burgoyne and the duches and other ladies
in France / such as had their husbands and friends in prison in Turkey / and
in trust to be well rewarded for his good wyll^ be wrote yt what so ever end
was made for their redempcyon / that he would be come ^ettour for the sum of
money / and that as soon as they were delivered and come in to the power of
the venyciens / and that he might be certifyed thereof / that incontinent he
would come him self to Venyce / and se the raunsomes paid and delivered. By
these words (written by sir Dyne of Responde) the said merchant genouoye
enclyned to his desire / and on the trust to be well rewarded of the french
king / for he thought to such a king it was good to ^ay ^are. And also as I
was enfourmed the king of Cyper at the desire of the french king and the
duke of Burgoyne / he sent men of his specyciall counsel in to Turkey. And
in likewise sir Mathelyn and the lord of Damyne / two great barons in Greece
and in good favor with Lamorabaquy / traueyled greatly to auaunce this
treaty to thentent to do pleasure to the french king for without such
means the matter should never have been brought about / because Turkey is a
great country and yuell for men to traueyle in / that has not ben accustomed
thereto. When Lamorabaquy was ones condyscended to enter in to this treaty /
than it was ordained by his counsel that all the christen prisoners should be
brought together in to the city of Burse / and there to conclude their treaty.
So the prisoners were brought thither / who were in nombre a.xxv. but in their
coming thither the turks that brought them / did yuell entreat them / and
beat them forward / for they were but casely horsed / they could not go but a
pace. the turks ^ete them because they saw they should de delivered /
wherewith they were sore dyspleased.

When these knights were thus brought in to the city of Burse in Turkey /
Than they that were sent thither fro the French king and fro the duke of
Burgoyne / fro the king of Cypers / and fro the genouoys and venycyens /
received these prisoners ge^tylly / so that they were more at their case than
in the prisone that they were in before how be it they were kept ever so
strayte that they could not have the third part of their wylles. Lamorabaquy
most specially herd ever the soueraygne of Flaunders / for sir Jacques of
Helley had enfourmed him how he was one of the chyefe of counsel with the
duke of Burgoyne. Lamorabaquy was in a Castle beside Burse / and thither came
the said messangers. As last it was a greed that these.xxv. prisoners should
pay the so^me of two hundred thousand ducates / for the which so^me the
lords of Mathelyn and Damyne in Greece / and the merchant genouoy of Sio /
became dettours for the same / and tarried in pledge with Lamorabaquy. And the
earl of Neuers swear and bound him self to the said merchants / that as soon as he came to Venyce / not to depart thens till the money were paid.
Thus concluded this treaty / but or it was all concluded the earl of Ewe was
so speak and feeble by the alteracyon of the air and course meats / that he
dyed at Loge in Greece / where he was kept prisoner / whereof all his company
were right sorry / but they could not amend it. Thus sir Phylyppe of Arthois
earl of Ewe and constable of France / after he was deed was enbawmed / and so
brought in to France / and buried in the church of saint Laurence of Ewe.
When Lamorabaquy was contented with the marchaundes bonds for the det of the
said so^me / the soueraygne of Flaunders and sir Jacques of Helley took their
leave to return in to France / and Lamorabaquy was well content therewith /
and ordained that these two knights should have of the so^me that he should
receive / twenty thousand ducates to be rebated of the hole some. For this
king Basaache considered the pain and traueyle that they had endured / and
specially the soueraygne of Flaunders was greatly in his favor. These two
knights thanked the king of his gift / than they took their leave of him /
and afterward of the French knights and lords. When they were departed fro
the king they came to the city of Burse / and than departed and left the
earl of Neuers and the lords of France still in the city of Burse / for they
tarried for the lords of Mathelyn and Damine who should come thither by see to
receive them in to their galees. And these two knights took a galee passenger
to sail to Mathelyn. At their departing fro the port the wether was fair
and temperate / but when they were abroad in the sea the wind changed / and
had a marvelous great tempest / so that the sovereign of Flaunders by reason
of sore traueyle in that tempest / he fell sore sick on the sea / and dyed or
they came to Mathelyn / whereof sir Jacques of Helley was ^ight sorry / but there
was no remedy / and so sailed forth in a galee of Venyce / and passed by Rodes
/ and always as he went he publysshed the redempcyon of the lords of France
/ whereof they of Rodes were right joyful. At last this knight came in to
France / and showed the king and the other lords and ladies how he had
spedde / whereof the king and other were right joyful / and thanked the knight
of his traueyle and pain he had taken in that journey.

When the redempcyon of these lords and knights of France was at apoynt /
than Lamorabaquy thought or they departed to have them in his company and that
they should be more at large and better entreated than they were before / as it
was reason / sithe they were no longer prisoners / he thought they should se
part of his puyssaunce and state / which was as it was showed me / marvelous
great and sumptuous / and kept much people daily about him. Thus he sent of
the noble men of his house to bring them to his presence / to whom he made good
chere / and had every thing delivered them of the ordinary of his court /
acordynge to the usage of the country / and every day the king talked with
the earl of Neuers by a truchman / and greatly he honored the earl of Neuers /
for he saw well he was like to be a great man in France / and son to a
great lord/whereof he was well enfourmed / the which he found true / by reason
of the great suit that was made for their redempcyon / and by the great so^me
of money that they agreed to pay. The earl of Neuers and his company had great
marueyle of the great state that he kept / he and his people lay ever in the
field / for no town could suffyce them. The spence of his howseholde and
charge of meat and drink / was marueyle to consydre fro whence it should come
/ but that the country is so hot that the people be of sobre diet / and use
much spycery / and specially sugar and gotes milk whereof they have great
haboundaunce / the which is common drink of the sarazyns / and they have
plenty of bredde / made of a grain called mylle / he had ever about him a
seven thousand fawconers and as many hunters. So it was on a day he went a
hawkynge / and had a flight with a fawcon at an Egle in the presence of the
earl of Neuers / the which flight pleased not Lamorabaquy / wherewith he was
sore dyspleased / and as it was showed me / for the same fault there was at the
point a two thousand fauconers to have lost their heedes / bearyng them in
hand that they were not dylygent in keeping of his hawks. Another time in the
presence of the earl of Neuers a woman came to complain to the king /
desyringe to have right and justice upon a servant of his / saying. Sir king
/ I come to you as to my soueraygne / I complain me of a servant of your
chamber / as it is showed me / he is come this same day in to my house / and
the milk of a got that I had for me and my children / he has dronken it
against my will. and sir / I said to him that if he would do me that wrong / I
would complain to you / and as soon as I said so / he gave me two great
blows / and would not forbear for all that I spoke in your name / therefore
sir king do me justice / as ye are sworn to do to all your people. The king
marked well the woman's words / and so caused his servant to come a fore him
/ and the woman also / and than he caused the woman to renew her complaynt.
The servant began to excuse him / and said that he knew nothing of that
matter. The woman spoke wisely and affyrmed her words to be true. Than the
king said / woman advise ye well / for if I find thy words untrue / thou
shalt dye an yuell death. Sir quod she I am content / for if my words were
not true / what need me to come in to your presence / do me justice I desire
none other thing. Thou shall have justice quod the king / for I have sworn so
to do to every man and woman. Than the king caused the man to be taken and
caused his belly to be opened / to se if he had eaten or dronken the milk or
not / and there he found that he had drunk the milk for it was not turned to
digestyon. And when the king saw that the woman's words were true / he said
to her / thou had good cause to complain / go thy way quyte thou art well
revenged of the trespase that was done to the / and she had a good recompense /
and the man deed. This judgment the lords of France saw and herd.

How the lords of France returned by see to Venyce / and of the isles they
found by the way. Cap. CC.xxiiii.
When the Earl of Neuers and the other lords of France / who had been taken
prisoners at the battle before Nycopoly in Turkey / when they had seen a
season the state and manner of Lamorabaquy / and that he was content of every
thing / and understood that the lord of Mathelyn and the lord of Damyne /
and the merchant of Sio were come to Burselle in Turkey / than he gave them
leave to depart. So they came all together before Lamorabaquy / except the
earl of Ewe and the lord of Coucy / who were both deed / thus they took their
leave and thanked him of his courtesies. Than Lamorabaquy said to therle by a
truch man. Johan I know well thou art a great lord in thy Country / and
son to a great lord / thou art young / and pe^ adventure shall bear some
blame and shame that this adventure has fallen to the in thy first chyualry /
and to excuse thy self of this blame and to recover thine honor /
peradventure thou wylt assemble a puyssaunce of men / and come and make war
against me / if I were in doubt or fear thereof / or thou departed I should
cause the swear by thy law and faith yt never thou nor none of thy company
should bear armure or make war against me / but I will another make ye nor
none of thy company to make any such oath or promise / but I will that when
thou art returned and art at thy pleasure / raise what puyssaunce thou will
and spare not but come against me / thou shall find me always ready to receive
the and thy company in the field in plain battle / and this that I say show
it to whom thy list / for I am able to do deeds of arms / and ever ready to
conquer further in to crystendome. These high words the earl of Neuers
understood well / and so did his company / they thought on it after as long as
they lived. Than they took their leave / and they were conducted with a great
nombre / under the leadynge of Assybaathe and Surbasaache / and so delivered to
the lords of Mathelyn and Damyne / who were cause of their delyueraunce / and
when their galees were ready they entered / and their conducte returned to their
king. So they sailed till they came to ye port of Mathelyn / where they were
received with great joy.

THe lady of Mathelyn was right honorable and gentle / and as well assured of
her self as any lady in Greece / for in her youth she had been brought up in the
emperor of Constantyne the nobles court / with the lady Mary of Burbone /
where she had learned much norture / for in France the lords and ladies be
more honorable / than in many other countries. This lady was right ioyouse to
se in her house the earl of Neuers / and sir Henry of Bare / sir Guy of
Tremoyle and the other / she received them right honorably with great joy /
and did what she could to do them pleasure. First she newly aparelled all the
lords and knights of France with shyrtes / gowns / and other aparell of
fine damask / acordynge to the usage of Greece / and all other every man after
his degree. The lady spared nothing on them / wherefore they gave her great
thank / and greatly praised her estate and order. In likewise they thanked and
praised the lords of Mathelyn and of Damyne / who made them good chere and
honorable. Anon tidings of their delyueraunce was known at the Rodes /
whereof the great master of the Roodes and all the knights there were right
joyful / and they determined to arm forth two galees / and to send for them
to come in to the isle of Rodes / and so they did / and in the one galee they
set sir Jacques of Brassemont a burgonyon marshall of the Rodes. So long they
sailed and rowed that they aryued at Mathelyn. The marshall was well received
of every man and of the lady of Mathelyn. Than these lords and other
refresshed them there a four days / and on the fyfte day their galees were
ready. Than the earl of Neuers took leave of the lady of Mathelyn / and thanked
her greatly and the lords also / and the earl of Neuers said that he was
bound for ever town them his good will. The lady answered wisely to them all.
So they entered in to the Galees in the port of Mathelyn / and had wind and
wether at will / and sailed so long that without danger or do^mage they came
and aryued in the isle of the Rodes / in the same place where as all galees do
aryue coming fro Cyper / or fro Barn / and fro other parts of the sea
Oriental. There were many of the knights of the Roodes / who be or ought to
be men of valiant courage / for they bear the white Cross / in signyfieng of
the cross of Christ / who dyed and took pain for the redempcyon of all
christian people / and nere hand daily these knights have skrymysshes and
assawtes to aid and sustain the christen faith against the myscreau^tes /
wherefore these knights ought to be valyaunte men / and nourysshed in the war.

When the earl of Neuers and his company were come in to the isle of Rodes /
the great master and the great priour of Acquytanye / who was there / received
the french men honorably / and offered to lend them gold and silver to pay
their small charges and costs / which offer the earl of Neuers and his
company took for a great curtesy / and hertely thanked them / for they had
great need thereof* the great priour of Acquytanie a right valiant knight lent
to the earl of Neuers a thyrty thousand frankes in ready money / and sir
Reygnere Pot steward with the earl of Neuers and the lord of Rocheforde of
Burgoyne received the money. I think it was generally for them all / that
every man should have part / but the earl became dettour for the money. Thus
they tarried in the Isle of Rodes a good seasone to refresshe them / and to
set every thing in good order / for the air was more atte^perate there than
when as they had been in Turkey. And as they tarried thus at Rodes abiding for
the galees of Venyce a syckenesse took sir Guy of Tremoyle lord of Seully / of
which sycknesse he dyed there / and was buried in the church of saint Johan
in the Rodes / and the lords of France did his obsequy right reverently / and
were right sorye of his death / but there was no remedy. The Earl of Neuers
knew well that the duke of Burgoyne would be sore dyspleased of his death /
because he had always found him sage and of good counsel. At the last there
aryued the galees of Venyce whereof the french men were right joyous. Than they
took their leave of the lords of the Rodes. Thus departed the earl of Neuers
/ sir Henry of Bare / Boucyquante / Guillyam of Tremoyle / the lord of
Rocheforde and all other. The patrones of the galees (to do them pleasure) were
content to suffer them to refresshe them in the isles between Venyce and
Rodes. First they came to Modon a five hundred mile fro the Roodes / and there
they refresshed them. it parteyned to the venycyens.

ANd fro modon they sailed with wind and wether at will / and so came to the
isle of Calefo / and there refresshed them. And fro thence to the isle of
Garre / and there tarried / and than they came to the isle of Chyfolignie and
there landed / and found a great nombre of Ladies and damsels / who had the
sygn^orite of that isle. They received the french men with great joy / and
brought them to pass the time about the isle / which is right fair and
pleasant. And such as know the condycions of that isle / affyrmeth that the
fayry and the nympes be much conuersaunt there. Some of the merchants of
Venyce and Geane and of other lands / such as have aryued there / and tarried
there a seasone to eschew the danger of the sea / have said that they have
seen some of the fairy there and have proue^ their words to be true. The earl
of Neuers and his company were right ioyouse of the company of these ladies /
and right ioyously the ladies received them / and said how their coming
thither did all the isle great honor / because they were noble knights and
men of honor / for there has not acustomed none other to be conuersaunt
among them / but merchants. This isle is not all only enhabyted with women
/ but there be men among them / but the women have the soueraynte and chief
rule there. They are work women in sylke work / and make clothes of sylke /
so subtelly and so well / that there is none like them / nor the men of the
isle can not make it / but they carry them out to sell where they think to
have most profit / and the woman abide still in ye isle / and they honor the
men for the said cause / and they have the profit thereof. The Isle is of that
condycion that no man dare aproche it to do there any do^mage / for who so ever
does are perysshed / and that has been seen and proved / and therefore these
ladies endure ever in peace / and dought no man. Also they are marvelous sweet
/ gentle / amyable / and humble / and when they will they speak with the fayry
and be in their company.

When the earl of Neuers and his company had refresshed them in this isle of
Chyfoligne about a five days / than they took leave of these ladies / and
left among these ladies part of such as they had that they might forbear /
so that the ladies gave them great thank at their departing / and so they
sailed to a land called Raguse / and there they rested. And fro thens to
Clarence / a hundred mile fro Venyce. And while they were there thither came a
squire of Haynalt of great reco^mendacyon / borne in the town of Mons / he was
called Brydoll / he came fro the holy scpulcre / and fro Quayre and fro saint
Katheryns mount / and when he came to Clarence the frenchmen made him good
chere / because he was borne in Haynalt / for the countess of Neuers was
daughter to the earl of Heynalte / and also because he had been in far
countries / and they demanded of him news fro those parties / and also of the
state of the king of Cyper. He answered to every thing right wisely.

When the earl of Neuers had refresshed him there a season / than he sailed
forth and came to the port of Parcuse. The great galees could go no further
to come to ye port of Venyce. Than within a certain space they took other
small ships passengers and so came to Venyce / and there were received with
great joy / and they thanked god that they were come thither in sauegarde and
out of the hands of the myscreauntes / for they were ones in fear / never to
have come out of their hands. Than every man went to his logynge which was
prepared for them / for their coming thither was known before / their
servants were come thither and prepared for them redye against their coming.
The earl of Neuers found there ready part of his servants / sent thither by
the duke of Burgoyne his father and the duches his mother. Also there was ready
sir Dyne of Responde because of their ransom. Than clerks were set to
write letters / and messangers were sent forth to give knowledge to their
friends of their coming. These news was anon known over all. the duke of
Burgoyne and the duchess ordained for the state of their son / as vessel /
and plate of silver and gold / aparell / and stuff of household all this was
sent to Venyce on so^mers / and the lord of Angyers and sir Jacques of Helley
did convey all this stuff / and so came to Venyce. And all the other lords
and knights friends did send thither in like manner. And ye may believe well
that this was not dooue without great cost / for there was nothing spared and
also they lay at Venyce at great cost and charge / for Venyce is one of the
derest towns in the world for strangers to lie in. Thus these lords kept
their estates there / and therle of Neuers was more charged than any other / as
it was reasone / for he was the chief there. The duke of Burgoyne and the
duchess set all their ententes for the delyueraunce of their son / for
they desired greatly to se them and so did many other / and the duke said that
without aid of his men and good friends that were in his lands / as well in
Burgoyne as in Arthoys / and in Flaunders / he could not tell how to atteyne
to the sum of money that Lamorabaquy should have for his sons ransom /
and to bear the costs that daily grew by that occasyon / for though their
raunsomes drew but to two hundred thousand floreyns / all things consydred
their other charges drew to as much / as they said that had the receyte and
delyueraunce thereof. The duke took counsel where this money should be raised
/ for ye duke could not break nor mynysshe his estate / nor it was not his
mind to do. Than it was determined that the rich men in all his good towns
should be tared / and specially they of Flaunders / because they were rich /
by reason of their marchaundyse. This taracyon was set forward / and when
they of Gaunt were called curtesly to the matter / they answered and said that
they would gladly help to aid their en^erytour with the so^me of fyfty
thousand florayns. In likewise they of Bruges and of other good towns in
Flaunders were ready to aid their lord. The duke and duchess thanked them
curtesly / in likewise so did they of Arthoise and of Burgoyne. Also the
French king aided well for his part. And also it had cost him great riches
in sendynge of presents and knights in to Hungry and Turkey / howbe it he was
well content therewith / sith his cosyns and his knight Bouciquaunt were come
to Venyce in surety.

THerle of Neuers lay thus still at Venyce / for his intent was not to deperte
thens / till every thing was paid and discharge. For the furnysshing of this
fynaunce sir Dyne of Responde took great pain / to the entente to pleace the
French king and the duke of Burgoyne. In such business he was subtyle and
wise. Thus these French lords and knights sported them each with other. The
same season there fell in Venyce a great mortalyte / and it began in the
month of Auguste / and dured without ceassynge till saint Andrews tide /
wherein dyed much people / and there dyed sir Henry of Barc eldest son to the
duke of Bare / and herytoure (by his wife) of all the lord of Coucyes lands /
except the ladies dowrye. Thus in the same season / both the ladies of Coucy
were widows / and their husbands deed / the which was great do^mage His body
was enbaulmed and carried in to France / and buried in Paris as I believe and
there his obsequy was done solempnely To fly and eschew fro this death at
Venice the earl of Neuers went and tarried at Trenuse / with all his estate /
and there tarried a four months with all his company.

THus the earl of Neuers being at Trenuse. It was showed the king of Hungry by
them of the Roodes / how the French lords were agreed with Lamorabaquy to
pay for their so^mes two hundred thousand florens. Than the king sent letters
by a bishop and certain knights to them of Venice / in the favor of the
French knights. And also they were charged to say certain words to therle
of Neuers / as ye shall here / for when they ca^e thider they said to him. Sir
/ we are sent hider fro our sovereign lord the king of Hungry your cousin / who
saluteth you by us / and here be letters that he has sent unto you / and he
understands / how ye are delivered fro the hands of the turks his
adversaries for certain rau^some / the which otherwise ye could not have been
delivered whereof he is right ioyouse. And sir / the king knows well yt your
treaty could not have been made without great cost and charge / for beside that
ye lost in the battle / your ransom and other charges has been and is daily
great. Wherefore sir / the king says if he might aid you with any thing he
would gladly do it / for he thinks him self bound thereto / as well by
lynage or otherwise. but sir / he and his took such do^mage at the day of the
battle before Nichopoly / as ye know well. And also his revenues of his
realm for this year and ye next be in a manner as lost. but wha^ he has
recovery thereof / and is of power (he says) he will so purney for you / that
ye shall be well content with him / and thus to do he is of good will. And sir /
to thentent that ye shall give credence to his promise and saying. He has in
the city of Venyce of yearly renenewes / seuyn thousand ducates. And sir / he
is content that this be sold to the venycience: and that of the money that
shall rise thereof / that ye should use it and aid your self therewith as ye
would do of your own goods. And sir / of this we shall deliver quitau^ces to
the venicyence. we have authorite so to do. this offer greatly pleased the earl
of Neuers and his counsel / and the lord of Rocheforde answered and said /
how the earl and all his company thanked greatly the king of Hungry in that
he would sell or lay to gage his enherytau^ce for to aid them. Saying how
his o^^re was not to be refused nor forgotten / desyring to take a little
counsel in the matter and so they did. Within a brefe time after / it was
showed to the king of Hu^geries ambassadors in the behalf of the earl of
Neuers / that it should not be co^uenyent that the king of Hungry should sell
or ley to pledge his enherytaunces / for other men's causes. But if so be the
ambassadors would do so much as to show to the venicye^ce that they would do
so much as to lend therle of Neuers a certain so^me of florence / to help
to pay the earls by charges / and to pay again to the priour of saint Iohn^s
in Acquitayne the.xxx. thousand florens / that he lent to the^ in the isle of
the Rodes. In thus doing they said they would highly thank the king of
Hungry and his counsel. The ambassadors said they would do their best / and
assaye the venicye^ce what they would do. When the venycience were moved in
this matter / they answered but coldly / and said they would take counsel and
give answer within fyftene days / at which time they answered (as I was
informed / by one that was by at the answer gyueng) that if the king of Hungry
would selle his hoole realm / the venycience should be ready to bargayne with
him / and pay him in ready money. but they said / as for so little a thing as
scuyn thousand ducates by year / they could make no price nor valewre thereof
/ another to by nor to sell / wherefore they said they would not medell in that
small matter. This was the answer that the venycience made. Some thought and
ymagined / that this answer was made by way of dissymulacion. And that
though the king of Hungry made this offer / yet by agreement / ye venicyens
made that answer. Thus the matter abode still / and the king of Hungry still in
his possessyon of his revenues. Than^e the kings ambassadors departed fro
Venyce and returned in to Hungry / and the earl of Neuers abode still at
Trenuse / because of the mortalyte in Venyce.

YE have herd here before / how the lord Philyppe of Arthois / earl of Ewe
and constable of France / dyed in ye cite of Burse in Turkey / of whose death
all his friends were sorry / and specially the french king / for he loved him
entierly. His office was such / that it might not long be vacant / whereupon
all the lords of France assembled togider to take advise who should be made
constable. The most part of ye counsel agreed on the valyant knight sir Loys
of Sanxere / who had been long marshall of France / and was the same time. He
was in the parties of Languedoc / and so was sent for / and inco^tynent he
came to Paris / and there was made constable. Than was void the office of the
marshall. than ye king said / none should have yt office / but alouely his
knight sir Bouciquaunt: every man agreed thereto / for he was well worthy. When
he was chosen he was at Venyce / but shortly after he came to Paris. for the
rau^soms ones paid all the lords and knights of France returned home. So
sir Bouciquaunt was Marshall of France. Therle of Neuers drew to the duke of
Burgoyn his father and to the duches his mother. he had great chere made him of
them and of other / as it was reason / for he came fro a long voyage and a
peryllous. He was well received i^ all his fathers countries / as in Flaunders
/ in Arthoys / in Burgoyne / and in all other places parteynyng to his fathers
and to his enherytau^ce.

How after the return of the lords of France / the french he king intended
what he might / to set a concord and peace in the church. Cap. CC.xxv.
THerle of Neuers thus returned in to France / he abode about the duke his
father / and visyted his lands and signories. Than he had desire to go to se
ye french king and the duke of Orlyau^ce / who received him with great joy.
The king and the duke of Orlyaunce had great appetyte to here therle speak /
and to here of ye news of Turkey / and of all his adventures / and of the
state of Lamoraba^. therle answered wisely and co^playned nothing of
Lamorabaquy / but said he had found him right curtesse / and how that he was
well entreated. and he forgot not to show ye king and the ladies / how at his
departing Lamorabaquy said to him / that he was borne in this world to do
deeds of arms / and to co^quere ever more and more. And how that he would not
command the^ when they were prisoners / that they should no more bear arms
against him / but said he would rather have the^ come again the second /
third / or fourth time / if need were / if the deeds of arms so required.
And also he said how his intent was to se Rome / and to make his horse eat
otes upon saint Peter's altar. And also he said / how our christian faith was
nothing worth but corrupted by the heedes that ought to govern them / whereat
the Turks make but a mock. Wherefore he said / it should be the destruction of
Christendom / and that ye time was as than come. And diverse of the Turks and
sarazins said / that their king Lamorabaquy was borne to be lord of all the
world. And this they of Turkey / of Tartarye / of Perce / of Alexandre / and
of other parties of the sarazins lands said. They knew it well that it
should be so by reasone that the Christen men / were abused upon.ii. popes /
whereby the christen men were not all of one accord / but differedde. Some
beleuyng on the one pope / and some upon the other / And the sarazins had great
marueyle / how the heedes of Christendom in every realm would suffer it.
These words of the earl of Neuers made the French king and other lords
greatly to muse. And some said how the sarazins had good reason to laugh and
mock at christendom / because they suffered the prelates of the church to
medell so much. Therefore some said / it was time to abate their pompes / and
to bring the^ to reason. The clerks of the vnyuersite of Paris who traueyled
to learn / could not come to any preferment of any benifyce / by reason of the
Scisme in the Church / and of the two popes / wherefore they would gladly that
the people should murmr against them. And were right glad that the earl of
Neuers said / that the turks made a great derision thereof. And said. How
that without the french king and the king of Almaygne found some remedy /
every thing should be worse and worse. And to say the truth / such as
held them as neutre / they thought had taken the best way / and so every
man ought to do / if they would bring the Church in to good case. Also it was
secretly showed the French king / by such as he loved / and such as loved
his health / how that it was the common opinyon in the realm of France /
that he should never have perfitely his health / unto the time that the Church
were brought in another estate. And also they showed the king / how that
king Charles his father when he lay in his death beed / charged his counsel
in conscience / and had great dout that he was sore abused in those two popes.
Than the French king answered them and said. When the king my father dyed I
was but young / and I have believed hyder to / such as have counsayled me / if
there be folly / it is in them and not in me. But sithe we be now this
informed in the matter / we shall provide for the remedy / and that shall be well
seen.

THe French king marked the matter more profoundely than^e ever he did before
/ and said to them of his counsel / how he would provide for the matter / and
spoke thereof to his brother the duke of Orlyaunce earl of Bloyes and of Valois
who agreed anon to the kings will. In likewise so did the duke of Burgoyne /
for though he obeyed pope Clement / yet he had never ferme believe on him. But
the prelates of the realm of France / and specially Guy of Roy archebysshoppe
of Reyns / the archebysshoppes of Sens and of Roen / and the bishop of
Ostune / they had brought the duke to believe on pope Clement. Than^e it was
aduysed by the kings secret counsel that if they purposed to bring the
Church to rest and peace / to have the accord of Almayne. Than was there
sent suffycient ambassadors and clerks of both laws (as master Philyppe
of Plays was one) in to Almayne / to the king of Boesme and of Almayne / who
wrote him self king of Romans. This matter went so forward / yt a day was
set that the king of Almayne and his counsel / and the French king and his
counsel should mete personally at the cite of Reins. This matter was done
secretly / because the prelates / cardynalles / archebysshoppes / and
bysshoppes / should not break their purpose that they were about. They made it
be noysed / that the metyng of these two kings and their counsayls at Reins /
was for non other purpose / but to treat for a marriage to be had between the
son of the marquis of Blanquebourge / brother to the king of Almayne / and
the daughter of the duke of Orlyaunce. And so by reason and under color of
that matter / they would common of other.

In this same seasone dyed at Nesues in Heynaulte / the lord Guye of
Chastellone earl of Bloyes / and brought to Valence^nes and buried at saint
Fraunces in the Freres mynours / in a chapel called the Chapel of Orthais. he
had done much cost in the closing of the said Freres / and when he dyed he
was so in debt / that the countess Mary of Namure forsook al his goods / and
durst not take on her the admynistracyon of his testament / but returned to
her dowry of the land of Chinay and of Beaumonde / and his other herytages
went to the heirs. The duke of Orlyaunce had the county of Blois for he had
paid while the earl Guye lived / two hundred thousand crowns of France and
the lands of Hollande / zelande / and Heynaulte / went to the duke Aubert of
Bauyere / earl of Heynaulte. And the land of Dauesnes / of Landrecier / and of
Lonnon in terreasse / fell to Johan of Bloyes called John^ of Bretaygne. And if
the earl had not sold the county of Blois / the said Johan of Bretaygne
should have been his heir thereof. Consydre what a do^mage a lord or any other
may do to his heir / by gyueng crede^ce to yuell counsel / god forgive him.

Now let us return to the business of England.

Of the death of the duke of Gloucestre and of the exle of Aru^dell / and how
the kings uncles and the londoners took the matter. Capi. CC.xxvi.
YE have herd here before / of the covert hates that was between king
Richard of England / and his uncle Thomas duke of Gloucestre / which the
king would bear no lengar / but said / and also was counsayled / rather to
distroye another man than himself. And ye have herd how the king was at
Plasshey / and by craft and color / brought him out of his own house to
London / And by the way about.x. or a.xi. of the cloak in the night / therle
marshall arested him in the kings name. And for all that he cried after the
King / yet the king made a deaf ear / and rode on before and so the same
night the king lay at the tower of London / but the duke of Gloucecestre was
otherwise lodged. For byforce he was put in to a Barge / and out of the barge
in to a ship that lay in the Thamise / and the earl marshall with him and
all his company. And did so much / that the next day by night they came to
Calais / without knoledge of any man / except the kings officers of the said
town.

yE may well know / whan^e the taking of the duke was known at Pla^hey / by
the duchess and her children / they were sore troubled and abashed / and
thought well that the matter went not well. The duchess demanded counsel
(what was best to do) of sir Johan Laquyham. The knight answered / that it was
best to send to his brethren / the dukes of Lancastre and of york / that
they might find some means to apeace the kings dyspleasure. For he said /
he thought that the king would not displease them. The duchess did as the
knight counsayled her / and she sent incontinent messangers to these two dukes
/ who were far a sondre / who when they herd thereof / were sored
displeased / and sent word again to the duchess that she should be of good
comfort. For they said / they knew well the king would not entreat him but by
laufull judgment / for otherwise they could not suffer it: but as thanne they
knew natte where he was. The Duchess and her children were somewhat conforted
with their answer. The king the next day went fro the tower of London to
Eltham / and there tarried. The same night was brought to the tower of London as
prisoners / the earl of Arundell and the Earl of Warwyke / whereof they of the
city of London had great marueyle / and made thereof great murmuring / but
none durst say nay against the kings pleasure. But all manner of people /
knights squyers / burgesses of good cities and towns of England said. We
have very well suffered. the duke of Lancastre and the duke of york / brethren
to the duke of Gloucestre / They may provide for this when it please the^.
We think they would well have provided for the matter / if that they had
known the kings intent against their brother of Glocestre / but because they
were not dilygent in the cause / the matter is come yuell / and like to have an
yuell conclusyon.

When the duke of Glocestre was brought to the castle of Calys / than he
feared him self greatly / and said to the earl Marshall For what cause am I
brought out of England hyder to Calais? Me think ye hold me as a prisoner.
Let me go abroad and se the fortress about. Sir quod the marshall / that ye
desire I dare not do it / for I have the charge upon you on pain of my life.
The king my soueraygne lord is a little myscontente with you. Wherefore / ye
must take pacyence here for a seasone / till I here other news / and that
shall be shortly by gods grace. For sir / as help me God / I am right sorry
for your trouble if I might remedy it. But sir / ye know well I am sworn to
the king / wherefore I must obey / and so will I do / for saving of mine
honor. The duke could have none other answer / But by that he saw / he
feared greatly his life. And on a day he desired a priest that sange mass
before him / that he might be confessed. And so he was at good leysar before
the sacrament / with devout heart / and cried God mercy / and was sore
repentaunt of all his sins. And in deed it was time so for him so to do / for
his death was nerer to him than he was ware of. For as I was enfourmed / when
he had dyned and was about to have wasshen his hands / There came in to the
chamber four men / and cast sodaynlye a towell about the dukes neck / two
at the one end and two at the other / and drew so sore that he fell to the
Earth / and so they strangled him / and closed his eyes. and when he was deed
they dispoyled him / and bare him to his beed / and laid him between the
shetes all naked / and his heed on a soft pyllowe / and covered with clothes
furred. And than they issued out of the chamber in to the hall / well
determined what they would say and said openly / How a palueysye had taken
the duke of Gloucestre the same night suddenly / and so dyed. These words anon
were abroad in the town of Calais. Some believed them and some natte. Within
two days that the duke was thus deed / the earl marshall appareled him self
in black / because he was his nere cosyn / and were many other knights and
squyers that were in Calays. His death was sooner known in France and in
Flaunders than in England. The French men were glad thereof / For there was a
common brute / that there should be no good peace between France and England
/ as long as he lived. And in all treaties between France and England / he
was evermore harder and obstynaier / than^e any other of his brethren /
wherefore they cared not for his death. In likewise many men in England / both
knights / squyers / and other officers of the kings / who were in fear of
him / because of his cruelty. All such were glad of his death. They took to
record his cruel deeds / by ye duke of Irela^de whom he had exyled out of
England. Also of ye death of that valyant knight sir Simon Burle / and of sir
Robert Triuylien / sir Nicholas Bramble / sir Johan Standysshe / and diverse
other. The dukes death was but little regarded in England / except but with
such as were of his opinyon. Thus this duke dyed in Calais. his body was
enbaumed and seared in leed and covered / and so sent by See in to England.
And the Ship that carried him / arrived at the Castle of Hadley / upon
Thamyse side / and fro thens carried by chariot symply to his own place at
Plasshey / and there buried in the Church / Which the said duke had
founded in the honor of the holy Trynite / wherein were twelve Chanonnes to
sing divine service.

YE may well know that the duchess of Gloucestre and Affren his son / and
his two susters / were sore disco^fyted when they saw the duke brought thither
deed. The duchess had double sorrow / for Richard earl of Arundell her uncle
was be heeded openly by the kings commandment in Chepesyde. there was no
lord durst speak to the contrary / the king being present at the same
justice doing. It was done by the earl Marshall / who had to wife the
daughter of the said earl of Arundell / and yet he bound his eyes him self.
The earl of Warwyke was in great danger to be beheeded: but the earl of
Salisbury who was in the kings favor desired the king for his life / and so
did diverse other barons and prelates in England. The king enclyned to their
requests / so yt he might be banysshed and put in such a place as he should
natte come fro / for the king would not clearly forgive him. He said he had
well deserved to dye / because he was of counsel with ye duke of Gloucestre
and with the earl of Arundell / to have broken the peace and truce taken
bitwene France and England: For the which article the king said / they had
deserved to dye / for the peace was taken between the perties / on such
co^dycion yt who so ever did break it / should be worthy to dye. The earl of
Salisbury / who had been the earl of Warwykes companyon diverse times / in
excusing of him said. How he was an old man and was desired by the duke of
Gloucestre / by his fair words. Wherefore he said / that he did was natte of
his own mocyon / but by theirs. Affyrming how there was never none of ye
Beauchampes that ever did trayson against the crown of England. Thus the earl
of Warwyke for pytie was respyted fro death. He was banysshed in to the ysle of
Wight: And it was said to him. Earl of Warwyke / ye have deserved to dye as
well as the earl of Arundell / but for the great service that ye have done in
time past to king Edward and to the prince his son / and to the crown of
England / as well on this side the sea as byonde / has done you great aid /
for the king has pity on you and has granted you your life. But it is
ordained by judgment / yt ye shall go in to the ysle of Wight and live there
as long as ye can / and shall have suffycient of your own to maynteyne there
your estate soberly / but ye may never depart thens. The earl took this
punysshement a worth / and thanked the king and his counsel for saving of
his life / and so made him ready to go thither at the day appointed. In the
which ysle was space sufficient for a lord to keep his estate enuyroned with
the Sea. Thus passed forth these Judgments in England at that season /
which multiplied daily worse and worse: as ye shall here after.

When the death of ye duke of gloucestre was known by the dukes of Lancastre
and of york / incontinent they knew well that the king their nephue had
caused him to be slain and murdered at Calays. As than these two dukes were
not toguyder each of the^ were at their own plates. They wrote each to other
to know what were best to do / and so they came to London / For they knew
well that the londoners were not content with the death of the duke their
brother. When they met there toguyder / they took counsel / and said:
Such deeds ought not to be suffered / as to put to death so high a prince /
as was their brother / for ydell words and false reports. For they said /
though he spoke oftentimes of the breakyng of ye peace yet he never brake it:
And between saying and doing is great difference / for by reason of words /
he ought not to deserve death by such cruel punycion. these two dukes were in
the case to have put all England to great trouble / and there were ynowe ready
to counsel them thereto / and specially them of the earl of Arundelles lynage
and of the earl of Staffordes / which was a great kynred in England. The king
as than was at Eltha^ and had sent for all such as held of him in chief.
And he had ready assembled toguyder about London / in Kent and Essexe / mo than
ten thousand archers. And sir Johan Hollande his brother was with him / and
therle Marshall and the earl of Salisbury / and a great nombre of lords and
knights: and the king sent to the^ of London / that they should not receive
the duke of Lancastre. They answered and said. They knew no cause that the
duke had done / why they should refuce him. The duke of Lancastre was at
London and the earl of Derby his son / and also the duke of york and his
son Johan / earl of Rutlande. The king loved the earl of Rutlande beyond
measure / who dissymuled the death of his uncle the duke of Gloucestre / and
showed how he would gladly se a good peace between the parties / and said how
he knew well that his uncle did wrong oftentimes against the king. The
londoners in likewise consydred the great myschiefe yt might fall in England /
by the discencyon between the kings uncles and the king / and their alyaunces.
Also they consydred / sith the myschefe was fallen of the duke of Gloucestres
death / that there was no recovery therein. they knew well it was because ye
duke of Gloucestre had been to lauesse of his tongue / and would have styrred
the realm to have broken the trewce between England and France. Wherefore
such as were wise men in the city dissymuled the matter / and thought it was
no time to a mende it as than / they feared the puyssau^ce of France / and
lesynge of their marchaundyse. Than began to treat and went as a mean
between the king and the duke of Lancastre / who was in many imagynacions / for
the death of his brother troubled him sore. Also he saw how his nephue king
Richard was alyed by marriage with the french king. Also ye duke of Lancastre
had.ii. of his daughters out of the land / one queen of Spain / a another
queen of Portugale / by whom he thought he should have great aid if he made
war against his nephue king Richard. All things consydred the duke
changed his courage / at the desire of the londoners / and of other prelates
of England / who were mean between the king and him / and by their means the
king was agreed with the duke / and peace made. with that the king promised
fro thens forward to be governed by the duke of Lancastre / and to do nothing
but by his counsel and advise / which promise the king nothing fulfilled
/ but was counsayled by young and wild counsel / which was to his hurt and
great do^mage / as ye shall here after in this hystory.

THus the king of England had peace with his uncles / because of the death of
the duke of Gloucestre. Than he began to reygne more fiersly than he did
before. The king went and lay in Essex / where as the duke of Gloucestre had
the chief rule / which ought to have pertaygned to Affcen his son and heir
/ but the king took all / for the ordinance in England was / the king to
have ye ward of all herytours children orphelyns under the age of.xxi. years /
and than they to have their herytages. Thus the king took the wardeshyppe of
his cosyn / the duke of Gloucestres herytour / and the king took the
possession and profit of all the dukes land / and kept the child with him.
And the duchess of Gloucestre and her two daughters were with the queen. The
duke of Gloucestr^ by enherytaunce was constable of England the king took
that office fro the right heir / and gave it to his cosyn the earl of
Rutlande. The king than kept great state than ever he did: nor there had not
ben no king before in England that spente so much yearly by a hundred
thousand nobles as he did. In like wise the king had with him the heir of
the earl of Arundell / who was beheeded at London. And because a knight that
was belongyng to the duke of Gloucestre called Cerbe / spoke at a time certain
words against the king and his counsel / he was taken and beheeded. Sir
Johan of Quynghay was in great parell / but when he saw that the matters went
so dyuersely as they did / he dyssymuled as much as he might / and departed fro
the duchess of Gloucestres house / and went and dwelt in other places. In
those days there was none so great in England / yt durst speak against any
thing that the king did or would do. He had counsel mete for his appetyte /
who exhorted him to do what he list. The king kept still in his wages ten
thousand archers night and day / that waited on him / for he reputed himself
not parfytely sure of his uncles / nor of the lygnage of Arundell.

Of the great assemble that was made in the city of Reyns / as well by the
emperor as of the realm of France / on the state of holy church. Cap.
CC.xxvii.
THe same seasone there was a great assemble of great lords in the city of
Reins / what of lords of the empire and of France / to the intent to bring
the church to a peace and rest / for the french king did so much / that at
his request his cosyn the king of Almayne came to the city of Reins with his
counsel / and because they would not have it brewted that they assembled
there all only for the matter by twent the popes / the one at Rome and the
other at Auygnon / they made it to be noysed that they came thither to treat
for a marriage of the son of ye marquis of Bla^cquebourge with the daughter of
the duke of Orlyaunce. This Marquis was brother to the king of Almayne. The
french king lay at the archebysshoppes palayes and there was with him the
dukes of Orlyau^ce / Berrey / and Burbon / therle of saint Powle and diverse
other high barons and prelates of France. And when the king of Almayne
entered in to the city / all the lords and prelates (and king Charles of
Nauer / who was in likewise there) went to mete with him / and received him
honorably. First they brought him to our lady church and after in to the
abbey of saint Remy / there the king of Almayne lay and his lords about
him. And it was ordained by the french king / that what so ever the king of
Almayne spent should be at the french kings cost. The almayns had every day
delivered them ten tonne of herynge / for it was in Lent time / and eight
hundred carpes beside other fysshes / which was a great charge.

When the king of Almayne came first to the french king / all the lords went
for him to saint Remy / and so brought him to ye kings palace. When these two
kings met they made great honor each to other / and great reverence / and
specially the french king / for almayns of nature are rude and gross manered
/ without it be to take their profit / thereto they be expert and ready enough.
All the lords of France and of Almayne took acquayntaunce each with other /
with loving words and countinaunce / and the french king made the king of
Almayne and his company a great dinner / at one table there sat / first the
patryarke of Iherusalem / than the king of Almayne and the french king / and
the king of Nauer / there sat no mo at that table. At the other tables sat
the lords and prelates of Almayne: No lord of France sat that day / but
sarued. To the kings board the meat was brought by the dukes of Berrey and of
Burbone / the earl of saint Powle / and by other great lords of France. The
duke of Orlyau^ce set every man down. Vessel of gold and silver ran
plentuously through the palace / as though it had been but of wode or earth / it
was a sumptuous dinner. And as I was enfourmed the french king gave to his
cosyn the king of Almayne all the vessel and plate of gold and silver / that
was served that day in the palace at the dresser or elsewhere / and all other
hangynges and habylymentes in the hall and chamber / whereunto the king
retrayed after dynner / and spyces and wine taken. This gift was praised and
valewed to two hundred thousand florayns / and more over there was given to
the other almayns / great gifts and goodly presents of vessel and plate of
gold and silver / whereof the strangers that were there had great marueyle of
the state and puyssaunce / and great riches of the realm of France. These
kings thus abiding in the city of Reins / their counsayles met together
diverse times on the matters that they came thither for / as well for the marriage
of the duke of Orlyaunces daughter with the Marquis of Blancque / bourges son
/ as for the reformacyon of the church. At last the marriage was concluded and
openly publysshed through the city / but as for the matter consernynge the
popes / there was nothing known thereof out of the counsel / for all that
was concluded in the counsel was kept secret. Afterward I was enfourmed /
how it was agreed that master Peter Daylly bishop of Cambraye / should go in
legacyon fro the french king and fro the king of Almayne to Rome / to him
that was called pope Bonyface / that he should submyt him self to have a new
electyon of a pope / and in likewise to ye other pope at Auygnon. And if so be
that any of them would not agree thereto / to abide the order of these two
kings he to be dysgrated and all ryghtes of the church to be kept fro him /
and the french king to comprise to his agreement his son in law the king
of England / and the king of scotts / king Henry of Spain / king Johan of
Portugale / king Charles of Nauer / and the king of Aragon. and ye king of
Almayne should compryse his brother Loys king of Hungery / and all the realm
of Boesme and Almayne to Pruce. And it was ordained that when this bishop of
Cambrey was returned fro the so^monyng of these two popes / than he to go in
to all the said realms their alyes. Thus these two kings swear to hold
without varyacyon or let. Thus ended their counsel at that time. The kings
and lords departed amyably / and every man took leave and departed and went
home.

AT this counsel at Reins the duke of Burgoyne was not nor would not be^ for
he said before that it was but a pain / and a thing lost to give any thing
to the almayns / for they keep no promise nor covenant / how be it for all
the dukes words there was nothing left / for the matter went forth as ye have
herd. And anon after the bishop of Cambraye made him ready / and took his
way to Rome. Also the french king sent a great ambassade in to England to
se ye king and the queen / and to show them of this matter / and so they did.
And when they returned they showed the french king how the king of
England would take the same way that the king of Almayne and the French
king would do. So they were all concluded if need were to be as newter. Thus
this matter stood in this case. King Charles of Nauer who was in France to se
the king his cosyn / trustyng to recover his heritage of Normandy and of the
county of Ewrus / the which the French king had taken fro him / as ye have
herd here before / but he could not attain thereto by no means / what so
ever he showed or said. And when the king of Nauerre saw that he lost his
pain and labored in vain / he took the matter in great dyspleasure / and took
his leave as sobrely as he could / not well content with the french king
nor with his counsel / and so returned in to the realm of Nauerre. Now
let us leave speaking of them and speak of other accydentes that fell in
England / whereby followed so great yuell / that the like has not ben written
of in this hystory / here follows the enter and beginning of the matter.

How the earl Marshall in England apealed by gage of vtterau^ce the earl of
Derby / son to the duke of Lancastre / in the presence of the king and his
counsel. Cap. CC.xxviii.
King Richard of England had a condycion that if he loved a man / he would
make him so great and so nere him that it was marueyle to consydre / and no man
durst speak to the contrary. and also he would lightly believe / sooner than any
other king of remembrance before him. and such as were nere about him and in
his grace / took no ensample of other that had been great with the king before
them / as the duke of Irelande / who was put out of England / and also sir
Simon Burle who by reason of such counsel as he gave to the king / he was
beheeded / and sir Robert Treuylyan / and sir Nycholas Bramble and other that
had been of the kings counsel / wherefore they suffered death / for the duke
of Gloucestre did all his pain to dystroy them / and yet finally he lost his
life / as ye have herd. whereof such as were than about the king was
nothing sorry / whereby some that were about the king rose in to such pride
that it was marueyle / and in so much that they could not color nor hyde it
/ and specially the earl Marshall / who was as great in the kings favor as
might be / and to the entente to please the king and to flatter him / he made
the king believe that he was a true faithful and a secret servant / and
that he could not endure to here any word spoken against the king / and
told the king many things to have the kings love / how be it often times a
man thinks to be auaunced / and is pulled back / and so it fortuned of the
earl Marshall / I shall show you how.

ye must know that the earl of Derby and the duke of Gloucestre deed / had to
their wives two susters / daughters to the earl of Herforde and of Northamton /
constable of England. so the children of the earl of Derby and the duke of
Gloucestre were cosyn germayns by their mother side / and within a degree as
nere of kynne by their fathers side. To say troth the death of the duke of
Gloucestre was right dyspleasaunt to many great lords of England / and often
times they would speak and murmr thereat / when they were together / and the
king than was so high upon the whele that no man durst speak / but the king
knew it / for he had caused to be spoken abroad in the realm that / what so
ever he were that spoke any word of the duke of Gloucestre or of the earl of
Arundell / he should be reputed as a traitor / wherefore the people durst not
speak. And on a day the earl of Derby and the earl Marshall communed together of
diverse matters / at last among other they spoke of the state of the king and
of his counsel / such as he had about him and believed them / so that at the
last the earl of Derby spoke certain words which he thought for the best /
wenynge that they should never have been called to rehersall / which words
were nouther vylenous nor outragyous / for he said thus. Saint Mary fair
cosyn. what thinks the king our cosyn to do? will he drive out of England
all the noble men / within a while there shall be none left? it seems clearly
that he wylleth not the augmentacyon of his realm. The earl marshall gave none
answer / but dissimuled the matter / and took it that he spoke against the
king / and thought in himself that the Earl of Derby was right lykely to make
great trouble in England / because he was so great with the londoners / and
the dyuell was ready to styre his brain / and that thing that shall fall can
not be eschewed.

SO he thought to show this matter to the king / when noble me^ should be
present / and on a day to please the king / he said. Right dear sir / I am
of your lygnage / and ame your lyege man and marshall of England / Wherefore
sir / I am bound to you by mine Alliegeaunce / and oath sworn my hands in
yours / that I should be in no place hearing / any thing contrary to your
mageste royal / and should keep it secret / I ought to be reputed as a false
traitor / which I will not be / for I will trewly acquyte me against you /
and all the world. The king looked on him / and demanded and said. Why say
you these words / we will know it? My right redouted sovereign lord quod the
earl Marshall / I say it because I can not suffer any thing that should be
preiudyciall or against your grace. sir cause the earl of Derby to come before
you / and than I shall show you more. Than the earl of Derby was sent for /
and the king commanded the earl Marshall to stand up / for he was on his
knee while he spoke to the King. And when the earl of Derby was before the
king / who thought none yuell / than the earl Marshall said. Sir earl of Derby
/ I say to you / ye have thought yuell and spoken otherwise than ye ought to do
/ against your natural lord the king of England / when ye said that he
was not worthy to hold land or realm / seeing without law or justice /
without counsel of any of his noble men / he distourbeth his Realm / and
without tytell or good reason puts out of his realm and dystroyeth them /
who ought to aid and sustain him wherefore here I cast my gage and will prove
with my body against yours / that ye are an yuell false traitor. The earl of
Derby was sore abashed with those words / and stepte back a little and stood
still a season without demanding of his Father or of any other what answer
he should make. When he had studied a little he stepped forth with his cappe in
his hand / and came before the king and the earl Marshall / and said. Earl
Marshall / I say thou art an yuell and a false traitor / and yt I shall
prove / my body against thine / and in that quarrel here is my gauge. Therle
Marshall when he herd how he was apealed showed how he desired the battle.
With that the earl of Derby answered and said. I set your words at the
kings pleasure / and other lords that be here / and I turn your words to a
mock and mine to be true. Than each of these earls drew to their company and
lygnage / so that the manner of taking of wine and spyces was let pass /
for the king showed him self to be right sore displeased / and so entered in to
his chamber / and left his two uncles without and all their children / and the
earls of Salysbury and Huntyngdon his brethren. Than anon after the king
sent for his uncles / and entered in to his chamber. Thanne the king demanded
of them what was best to do in this matter. Sir quod they cause your constable
to come before you / and than we shall show you our opynyons. Than the earl of
Rutlande who was constable was sent for / and when he was come / than he was
commanded to go to the earl of Derby and to the earl Marshall / and to take
suretye of them / that they go not out of the realm of England without the
kings license. The constable did as he was commanded / and than returned
again to the kings chamber.

YE may well know this matter greatly troubled the court / and many lords
and knights were sore dyspleased of that adventure and secretly they greatly
blamed the earl Marshall / but he made as though he had ser nothing by the
matter / his heart was so proud and presumptuous. Thus the lords departed for
yt day. The duke of Lancaster what so ever cou^tynaunce he made / he was sore
displeased with these words / and he thought the king should not have taken
the matter as he did / but should rather have turned it to nothing / and so
thought the most part of all the lords of England. The earl of Derby went
and lay at London / and held his estate at his own lodging / and there were
pledges for him / the duke of Lancastre his father / the duke of york / the
Earl of Northumberlande / and diverse other lords. And the earl Marshall was
sent to the tower of London / and there held his estate. These two lords
made prouysyon / for that was necessary for them for their battle. The earl of
Derby sent his messangers in to Lombardy to the duke of Myllayne sir Galeas /
for to have armure at his pleasure. The duke agreed to the earls desire / and
caused the knight that the earl had sent thither / whose name was Fraunces / to
se all the dukes armorye. And when the knight had chosen such as he lyked /
than the duke furthermore for love of the earl of Derby / he sent four of ye
best armorers that were in Lombardy to the earl in to England with the knight
/ to the intent that they should arm and make armure acordynge to the earls
entente. The earl Marshall on his part sent in to Almayn and in to other
places to provide him for that journey. The charge of these two lords was
great / but the earl of Derby was at most charge. The earl Marshall when he
began that business / he thought to have had more aid of the king than he
had / for such as were nere about the king said to him. Sir ye have nothing
to do to meddle between these two lords / dyssymule you the matter / and let
them deal / they will do well enough. Sir ye know well the earl of Derby is
well beloved in the realm / and specially with the Londoners / and if they se
that ye should take part with the earl Marshall / ye were like to lose their
love thereby for ever. The king understood well their words / and knew well it
was true / he than dissymuled the matter as much as he could / and suffered
them to make their prouysyon where they list.

THe news spredde abroad in diverse countries of the defyaunce between the earl
of Derby and the earl Marshall / Many men spoke thereof in diverse manners / and
specially in France. They said let them alone / the knights of England
are over proud / at length they will dystroy each other / for it is the worste
nacyon in the world under the son / for in yt realm dwells the most
presumptuous people that can be. Other there were that spoke more so berly /
and said / that the king of England showed no wisdom / nor was not well
counsayled / when for wild words he to suffer such two noble men of his
blood to enterprise arms in defyaunce / he should rather when he herd the
words first / have said to them both. ye are two lords of my blood and
lygnage / wherefore I command you both to be in peace / and let nouther
hate nor rancoure engendre between you / but be friends / lovers and cosyns
together / and if this land can not content you / go in to what country ye
will / and seek adventures of arms there. If the king had said those words
and apeased these lords thus / than he had done wisely. The duke of Lancastre
was sore dyspleased in his mind to se the king his nephewe mysse use him
self in diverse things / as he did. he consydred the time to come like a sage
prince / and sometime said to such as he trusted best. Our nephue the king of
England will shame all or he cease: he believes to lightly yuell counsel who
shall distroy him / and symply (if he live long) he will lose his realm / and
that has been gotten with much cost and travail by our predecessors and by
us: he suffers to engendre in this realm between the noble men hate and
dyscorde / by whom he should be served and honored / and this land kept and
douted. He has caused my brother to dye / which is one thing to be noted /
and the earl of Arundell / because they showed him truth / but he would not
here them nor none other that would counsel him against his appetyte. He
can not better dystroye his realm than to put trouble and hatred between the
noble men and good towns the french men are right subtyle / for one myschiefe
that falls among us / they would it were ten / for otherwise they can not
recover their do^mages / nor come to their ententes / but by our own means
and dyscorde between our self. And wese daily that all realms divided are
dystroyed / it has been seen by the realm of France / Spain / Naples / and
by lands of the church / as we may se daily by the two popes / which is and
shall be to their dystructyon. also it has been seen by the country of
Flaunders / how by their own means they are distroyed. Also presently it is
seen by the land of Frece / with whom our cosyns of Haynalt are in war /
and how the french men among them self are dystroyed / in likewise among
ourselfe without god provide for us we shall dystroy our self / the apparaunce
thereof shows greatly. Now the king suffers that my son and heir shall
do battle for a thing of naught / and I that am his father may not speak to
the contrary for mine own honor and for my sons / for my son has the
body of a knight mete to enter in to arms against the earl Marshall / how be
it take the best thereof they shall never love again together as they did
before. Thus said the duke of Lancastre.

ALl the seasone that these two lords did provide to do deeds of arms at
vtteraunce / the duke of Lancastre came never at ye king nor but little at his
son / and that he did for a polycy / for the Duke knew well yt his son was
marvelously well beloved in England / both with noble men and with other /
and specially with the londoners / for they had promised and said to him. Sir
be ye of good comfort in this business / for howesoeuer the matter turn /
ye shall escape with honor / whether the king will or not / or all the
Marmosettes about him / for we know well this matter is made and conveyed by
envy / to the entente to drive you out of the realm / because ye be well
beloved with many men. and if so be that ye depart in trouble ye shall enter
again with joy / for ye ought rather to rule than Richard of Burdeaulx / for
they that will seek out the profoundenesse of the matter / may well know fro
whence ye came / and fro whence he came / whereby they may know yt ye be more
nerer to the crown of England than Richard of Burdeaulx / though we have
made to him faith and homage / and have held him for our king more thanne
this twenty year / but that was by favor and purchase of his grauntfather good
king Edward / who douted of this point that we now speak of / and on a time
great question was made between king Edward your grauntfather by your father
side / and duke Henry of Lancastre your grauntfather by your mother side / the
Lady Blaunche of Lancastre / but the lords of England that than reigned
apeased the matter / for king Edward was so valiant a man and so happy in
all his enterprises / that he had the love of all his people poor and rich /
nor also your grauntfather of Lancastre would nothing to the King but well
and good / and served the king in his time nobly and trewly / so that he is as
yet to be recommaunded. These matters well consydred by king Richard / he
might well repent him that he is no better governed than he is. Such words
these londoners spoke / though they knew but little of the troth / that they
spoke was of a synguler favor. The earl of Derby received their words well a
worth / and daily prepared for the battle / and he desired his friends to be
at that journey / and so every man prepared himself / according to the Earls
desire.

THe king all the season that these two lords prepared for their battle / he
had many ymagynacyons / whether he should suffer them to fight or not. Though
he were king of England / and more douted than any other king before him /
yet night and day he kept about him a guard of two thousand archers / who
were paid their wages wekely / for the king trusted not greatly in them that
were next of his blood / except his brother the earl of Huntyngton and the
earl of Salisbury / and the earl of Rutlande his cosyn germayne / son to the
duke of york / who was well in the kings favor / and certain knights of
his chamber: as for all other he cared little for. When the day aproched / that
these two lords should do their deeds of arms / as they had promised / and
had every thing ready prepared. Than on a day / certain of the kings
counsel came to the king / and demanded what was his entencyon / that these
two lords should do / and said. Sir / will ye suffer them to fight? ye
truly quod the king / why should they not. We will se their deeds of arms.
Paraduenture we shall know thereby / that we know not as yet / and should be
right necessary to know to the entente we should provide for it / For there is
none so great in England / but if he displease me / I shall cause him to make
me amends / For if I should any thing submytte me to my subiettes / they
would soon overcome me. And I know for certaygne / that some of them of my
blood have had diverse treatise toguyder against me and mine estate / and the
most princypall of the^ was the duke of Gloucestre / For in all England was
natte a worse hedde against me than he was. Now I shall have peace fro hense
forward / for I shall do well enough with all the other. But sirs / I pray
you show me why ye make this demand to me. Sir quod they / we are bound to
counsel you. And sir / we often times here words spoken / that ye can not
here. For sir / ye be in your chamber / and we abroad in the country or in
London / where many things be spoken / which greatly touches you / and us
also. Sir / it were time to provide remedy / and so ye must do. Sir / we
counsel you for the best. How so quod the King? Speak further and spare
natte / for I will do every thing parteynyng to reason / and minyster Justice
in my realm. Sir quod they / the renoume ronneth through out England / and
specially in the city of London which is the soueraygne city of your
Realm. They say / ye are cause of this enterprice between these two lords /
and that ye have set the earl Marshall to fight with the earl of Derby.

THe Londoners / and diverse other noble men and prelates of ye realm say:
How ye take the right way to distroye your lygnage / and the realm of
England. Which thing they say / they will natte suffer. And if the
Londoners rise against you / with such noble men as will take their part /
ye shall be of no puyssau^ce to resyst them. And also they have you in a
marvelous suspecte / because ye be alyed by marriage with the French king /
whereby ye be the worse beloved of all your people. And sir / know for
certain / that if ye suffer these two Earls to come in to the place to do
battle / ye shall not be lord of the field / but the Londoners / and such
lords of their perte will rule the field / for the love and favor that they
bear to the earl of Derby / and the earl Marshall is soore hated / and
specially the Londouers would he were slain. And three parts of the people of
England say / that when ye hard yt words first between these two earls /
that ye should have done otherwise than ye did / and that ye should have broken
the quarrel / and have said. Sirs / ye are both my cosyns and lyegmen /
therefore I command you to keep the peace fro hens forth. And should have
taken the Earl of Derby by the hand and have led him in to your chamber /
and have showed him some sign of love. And because ye did not thus / the
brute ronneth / that ye bear favor to the earl Marshalles party / and are
against the earl of Derby. Sir / consider well these words that we show you /
for they be true. Sir / ye had never more need of good counsel than ye have
now. When the king herd these words he changed countynau^ce / the words
were so quickly spoken. Therewith the king turned fro them / and leaned out
at a wyndowe / and studied a certain space / and than he turned again to
them that had spoken to him / who were / the archebysshoppe of york / and the
Earls of Salisbury and of Huntingdon his brethren / and three other knights of
his chamber / than he said to them. Sirs / I have well herd you / and if I
should refuce your counsel I were greatly to blame. Wherefore sirs / consider
what is best for me to do. Sir quod one of them that spoke for all. The
matter that we have spoken of / is right peryllous. ye must dissymule the
matter / if ye will have your honor saved / and to make peace. And sir / ye
ought rather to entertayne the generaltie of your realm / than the ydell
words of two knights. But sir / the brute thoroughe out all the Realm of
England is / how the earl Marshall has greatly trespassed / and has
renewed to many yuell things / and daily renews / and the realm takes all
his words in vain / and says / how that by his ydell words / he would reise
a process against the earl of Derby / and to bring the land in to trouble.
First. They say it were better that he abode the pain / and the earl of Derby
to be quyte. Sir / we think that or they should arm the^ to mete together that
ye should send to them and cause the^ to be bound to abide your ordinance /
in this enterprise. And when they be furely bound to abide your sentence /
than ye may give them this Judgment. That within fyftene days after / the
earl Marshall to avoid the realm / without any trust ever to return
again. And therle of Derby in likewise to avoid the realm / and to be
banysshed for ten year. And when he shall depart the realm (to please the
people withal) release four year of the ten / and so let him be banysshed
for six year without pardone. This is the counsel sir that we will give you.
For sir / in no wise let them be armed one against another / for the
inconuenyentes that may fall thereby. The king studied a little and said.
Sirs / ye counsel me trewly / and I shall follow your counsel.



How king Richard gave sentence / whereby he banysshed out of England therle
of Derby for.x. year / and the earl Marshall for ever. Capi. CC.xxix.
Anon after that this counsel was given to the king / he assembled great
nombre of prelates and great lords of England / and they came to him to
Eltha^ there was his two uncles / the duke of Lancastre and the duke of york /
The earls of Northumberlande / of Salysbury / and of Huntyngton. Than the king
sent for the earl of Derby and the earl Marshall / and set each of them in a
several chamber. The king showed how he would be a mean between them / and
how their words had greatly displeased him / and that they were such /
that ought not lightly to be pardoned. Wherefore / he would in all points they
should submytte them self / and to abide his ordinance in that behalf. Than
he ordained the constable of England / and four other great lords / to go to
the earl of Derby and to therle Marshall / to take their bonds / to abide the
kings ordinance. These lords came to the said earls / and showed them the
kings pleasure / and how the king would take the matter on him. So they
bound them self to abide the kings order. Than the king said. I ordaygne
and command / that the earl Marshall / because he has brought this Realm in
to this trouble / by reason of his words / wherein he can not make proof.
That he ordain him self to avoid this realm of England / and goo dwell in
what place he list out thereof. And that he be banysshed in such wise / that
he never return again. And also I ordain / that the earl of Derby our cosyn
/ because he has displeased us / and that he is the chief cause of the
banysshment of therle Marshall. That within this fyftene days he avoid the
Realm of England / and to be banysshed for ten years without retournynge /
except we repeal him again / the which shall always lie in our pleasure.

THis sentence greatly contented the lords that were there present / and they
said / the earl of Derby may well enough go and sport him out of the realm
/ for two or three years. He is young enough. Though he have been sore
traueyled in his days in far countries / as in to Pruce / and to the holy
Sepulcher / to Cayre and to saint Katheryns mount. So he may do yet / goo some
other voyages to pass the time / if he list / he knows will enough whider
to go. he has two susters / one queen of Spaygne / the other queen of
Portugale / He may well pass the time with them. and also as now there is no
war. When he comes in to Spaygne / he may move them to make war upon the
Sarazyns / and to make a voyage in to Granade / whereby he may better employe
his time / than abiding in England / or else he may goo in to Heynaulte to
his brother and cosyn the Earl of Ostrenaunt / who will receive him with great
joy / and retaygne him / sor he has war with the Fresons. and in Haynaulte
he may daily here news out of England and fro his children. He can natte go
amysse goo where he will. And the king may repeal him again by good means
/ when it shall please him / for he is one of the fairest flowers in his
garlande. He shall not be long absente / if the king purpose to have the love
of his people. But the earl Marshalle is in a far worse case / for he is
banysshed without hope / for ever to return again. And to say the truth /
he has well deserved it / for all this myschiefe is come by him / and by his
words. Thus diverse knights and squyers of England talked toguyder / one with
another / the same day that the king gave the said judgment.





How the earl of Derby departed fro London to go in to France / and the earl
Marshall went in to Flaunders / and so in to Lombardy. Cap. CC.xxx.
When these two Earls saw what sentence ye king had given them / they were
right sore pensive / and good cause why. The earl Marshall sore repented him of
that he had said and done. For when he began the matter / he thought otherwise
to have been borne out by the king / than he was. For if he had known as
much before / he would never have begone the matter. When he saw there was no
remedy / he made him ready / and made his exchaung fro London to Bruges / and so
ca^e to Calays / where as he had been captain / and there took his leave and
so went to Bruges / and there tarried a fyftene days / and than to Gaunt / and
so to Maynges / and finally to Colloigne. Let us leave spekyng of him and
speak or the earl of Derby / who prepared him self in likewise to depart out
of England / according to the kings sentence.

When his day of departure aproched he came to Eltham to the king / where as
the duke of Lancaster his father was / and the duke of york with them / the
earl of Northumlande / and sir Henry Percy his son / with a great nombre of
other knights and squyers of England / such as loved him. And were soore
displeased of the fortune / that he must avoid the realm. These lords came
thither to se what end the king would make in the matter / of whose coming the
king made semblaunt to be right joyful / and made them great chere / and
held a great court. Also there was the earl of Salisbury / and the earl of
Huntyngton brother to the king / who had to his wife the duke of Lancastres
daughter / and suster to the earl of Derby. These two lords came to therle of
Derby / I know not if they dissymuled or not. At the earls departing / the
king humyled him greatly to his cosyn of Derby / and said As Godde help me /
it right greatly displeases me / the words that has been between you and the
Earl Marshalle. But the sentence that I have given is for the best / and for
to apease thereby the people / who greatly murmured on this matter. Wherefore
cosyn / yet to ease you somewhat of your pain / I release my Judgment fro
ten year to six year. Cosyn / take this a worth / and ordyne you thereafter.
The earl answered and said. Sir / I thank your grace / and when it shall
please you ye shall do me more grace. All the lords that were there / were
well contented with the king / as for that time. Than every man departed / and
some went to London with the earl of Derby. The Earl made all his prouisyon at
Dover to pass to Calays. And the earl being at London / or his departure / was
counsayled by his father for to go straight to the French king / and to his
cosyns in France / And according to his fathers counsel so he did / or
else he would have gone to the earl of Ostrenaunt his brother and cosyn. When
the Earl departed fro London / there were in the streets mo thanne forty
thousand men / weeping and cryeng after him / that it was pytie to here. And
so^e said. O gentle earl of Derby / shall we thus leave you? This Realm shall
never be in joy / till ye return again: But the day of return is very
long / for envy / falsehed and trayson / has put you out of this Realm /
where as ye ought to abide rather tha^ many other. For ye are of such lynage /
and of so noble blood / that none ought to be compared to you. And gentle earl
/ why shall we leave you? ye never did nor thought yuell.

THus men and women pituously spoke He was not conveyed out of the city with
instruments / but with lamentable wepynges. And some said secretelye. Consider
the order of these people / what displeasure they take for a small occasyon.
Who so ever would stir the Londoners to rise against the king / he might than
go seek further: and fly out of the realm / rather than the earl of Derby.
but it is as now no time / sith the duke of Lancaster his father suffers if
/ we must needs suffer it. The mayre of London and a great nombre of the chief
burgesses / accompanied therle of Derby out of the city. Some rode to
Dartforde and some to Dover and saw him take shippyng / and than they
returned. And the earl of Derby or he came to Calais / he had sent a knight
and an heraulde to the French king / and to his brother the duke of Orlyaunce
and to ye kings uncles / the dukes of Berrey / of Burbon and of Burgoyn / to
know the kings pleasure / if he would suffer the Earl to abide at Paris / and
to keep there his house / and to pay for every thing that he or his men should
take: To this request the French king and his uncles lightly agreed / and
showed that they were right joyful of his coming / and said / how they were
right sorry of the earls trouble. These messangers returned to Calais / and
fouude the earl ready there. The french king sent sir Charles of Hangers to
open all the cities and towns between Calais and Paris / to receive therle and
his company. Thus the earl of Derby departed fro Calays and took the way to
Amyence / and in every place he was well received.



How the lord Guillyam earl of Ostrenaunt sent to his cosyn therle of Derby
certain messangers / and how therle came to Paris / and how he was received.
Capi. CC.xxxi.
THe earl of Ostrenau^t being at Quesnoy / as soon as he knew that his Cosyn
the earl of Derby was passed the Sea / and was come to Calais. He ordained sir
Auncell of Trassagetes and sir Fierebras of Vertayne / to ride to Calais / and
to desire the earl of Derby to come in to Heynaulte to sport him / and to
abide there a season / promising him to have good chere. These two knights
departed fro Quesnoy / and rode to Cambrey and to Bapames / for they herd
news / that the earl was departed fro Calais / and had taken the way to
Amaye^ce / and so to go to Paris. These two knights met him by the way.
They spoke with him and did their message / so that the Earl thanked them /
and also his cosyn that had sent them to him. and than he excused him self /
and said how he had made his prouisyon to go in to France as at that time to
the French king and to his cosyns of France / but he would not renounce the
curtesy that his cosyn of Heynalt had showed him. Than these two knights
departed and returned / and showed therle of Ostrenaunt what they had seen and
done. And therle of Derby and his company rode so long that he aproched nere to
Paris. Wha^ the king and the duke of Orlyaunce and his uncles knew that the
earl of Derby came to Paris. he prepared his cha^bers in his place of saint
Poule richely to receive therle / and caused all lords to issue out of the
city to receive him: and the king tarried at the house of saint Poule. First
met him the duke of Berrey and the duke of Orlyau^ce / and than the duke of
Burgoyne and the duke of Burbon / and other noble prelates lords and knights.
At the metyng there was friendly chere / and so in good order they entered in to
Paris with great joy. The same day one great mysfortune fell / there was a
squire named Boniface mounted on a great coursar / which horse rose upright
upon his hinder fete and fell backewarde / and the squyers hedde light upon the
stones / that his hedde cloue a sonder and so dyed / of whose death the duke of
Orlyaunce was right sorry / for he loved him entierly / and so did the lord
of Coucy in his days / for he brought him in to Fru^ce out of Lombardy.

THus they came to the house ofsaynt Poule where the king was / who received
the earl nobly / and therle was sage and wise / and knew much of that
parteyned to honor. He made his reverence and acquaynted him with the king
after good manner / so much / that he greatly pleased the king / and for good
love he gave the earl his deuyse to wear / the which the earl received
joyfully. The words that were bitwene them I can not tell / but all was well.
And after taking of spyce and wine / the earl took leave of the king / and than
went to the queen in the same house / and she made him ioyouse chere. Than
after the earl departed and took his horse to go to his lodgyng / and so was
conveyed thither. Thus passed the time / and the lords of France did often
times keep him company / and caused him to pass ye time with sportes and
otherwise / to the intent he should think the season the shorter / because he
was out of his own nation. Now let us leave spekyng of the earl of Derby /
and somewhat speak of the ordinance of the Church of the two popes / Benedic
being at Auignon / and Bonyface at Rome.



How the treaty that had been at Reins / bitwene the French king and the
king of Almaygne / concerning the unity of the church was followed. And how
the bishop of Ca^brey was sent by the said king to Rome and to Auygnon / to
the^ that wrote them self popes / to the^tent that they should depose
themself fro their papalytes / and submyt the^ to the order of these two
kings. Capi. CC.xxxii.
YE have herd here before / how yt king of Almay^ne and ye king of France /
and the lords of thempire and their cou^sails had been at the city of Reins /
and there they had diverse secret counsayls. and their entencion was / to bring
the church in to a parfyte unite / for to follow the way that the church
held as than. The error was to great. And also ye have herd how master
Peter de Ailly bishop of Cambrey / was sent in legacion to Rome to speak
with pope Boniface. he spedde him so in his journey that he came to Fou^des /
and there found pope Boniface / and to him he delivered his letters of
credence / dyrected fro the kings of Almaygne and of France. The pope
received them / and the bishop right mekelye. The pope knew well part of
his message. Than the bishop declared ye cause of his coming. When the
pope had well herd him he said / How the answer lay not all only in him
/ but also in all the cardy nalles that had chosen him pope. but he said when
he had spoken with them by delyberate counsel / than he would make such
answer that he trusted to content them. This answer was suffycient for that
time. The bishop dyned that day in the popes palyce / and certain
Cardynalles with him. Than after the pope departed fro Foundes and went to Rome
/ and there the pope assembled a conuocacion of the cardynalles in his palyce
beside saint Peter's church. In this consistory there were none but the pope
and his cardynalles / And there the pope showed the request that the king of
Almaygne and the French king had made him by the bishop of Cambrey / and
there he demanded counsel what answer he should make. there were than^e many
reasons alleged / for it seemed right contrary to the cardinals to put down
that they had made / they said it should be greatly to their shame and
rebuke Than they said to the pope. Holy father / to cause these kings to be in
a good hope / yt ye will obey to the / ye must so^what dissymule y^ matter / and
say how ye will gladly obey to all thing that the king of Almaygne / the
king of Hungry / and the king of England will counsel you unto. So that he
that is in Auignon / who writes him self pope Benedic / whom the French king
and the frenchmen uphold in his error / that he depose him of the name of
papalyte. And tha^ where so ever it shall please the said kings to apoynt a
co^claue / ye will be ready and all your brethren the cardynalles. This
counsel pleased well pope Boniface. This was the special and general
answer that the bishop of Cambrey had. And when the Romans understood
that ye kings of Almaygne and of France / had sent to their pope their
ambassade / to have him to leave his papalyte / anon there multiplied great
murmuracion / through the city of Rome. And the Romans douted greatly to lose
the popes siege / which was yearly to them a great profit. For all pardons
that should be two year after / the vantage thereof should grow to the city of
Rome. and against that pardone they had made great prouisyon / wherefore they
douted lest it should have been lost / which should greatly have been to their
preiudyce. Than the most notablest persons in Rome assembled together / and
came to the Pope and showed him more sign of love / than ever they had done
before / and said. Holy father / ye are the true pope / therefore lose not your
heritage and patrimony of the church / the which was saint Peter's. take never
counsel to the contrary / but abide still as pope. For who soever be against
you / we shall abide with you / and ieoparde our bodies and goods / to
defend you in your right. The pope answered and said. My well-beloved children
be of good confort / and be well assured / that I will abide as pope / for any
treaty of king or kings to the contrary. Thus the Romans were contented and
apeased / and returned to their houses. The popes answer was always to the
bishop of Cambrey / that wha^ he parceyued clearly that Benedic deposed
himself / than he said / he would be ordered by the said kings. So the
bishop returned and came in to Almaygne / and found the king at Co^ualence
/ and there he showed ye answer that he had at Rome. Than the king of Almaygne
said. Well. Show all this to our brother and cosyn the French king / and as
he ordreth him self so shall I order me / and all the empire. But as far as
I can se / he must begin first. And when he has put down his pope / than we
shall put down ours. Than the bishop departed fro the king / and rode
till he ca^e to Paris / where he found the French king. And there the
bishop showed his answer which was kept secret / till the king had
assembled toguyder more no^bre of noble men and prelates of his realm / by
whom he would be counsayled / how he should percede further.



How the French king assembled the prelates and other noble men of his realm
/ with the Vniuersyte of Paris / to take counsel how they should order pope
Benedic at Auygnon. Cap. CC.xxxiii.
When the french king had herd the answer of Pope Bonyface at Rome / and
how the king of Almayne in likewise answered / how that first pope Benedyc
must be put dowue. that done / than he would make a conuocacyon of prelates
and noble men of his realm / and come to Paris. There were certain prelates
in France / as the archebysshop of Reins sir Guy of Roye / and the
archebyssoppes of Rone and Sens / and the bysshoppes of Paris / of Beauoys /
and of Anxex / they had sore sustained the opynyons of pope Benedyc at Auygnon
/ and specially of Clement / because he was auaunced by their means. These
six prelates were not called to the king in this counsel / but other
prelates and the university of Paris. And when the bishop of Cambray had
showed before them all / how he had spedde at Rome / and the answer that
pope Bonyface and his cardynals had made him / and the answer of the king of
Almayne / than they entered in to counsel / and it was a greed / yt the
vnyuersite should have the greattest voice. Than it was determined by the
vnyuersite that the king should send sir Bouciquant his marshall in to the
parties of Auignon / and to do so much by treaty or otherwise / that Benedic
should leave his papalyte and to ordeyne him self in all points by the king
and his counsel. and that the church in all the lymytacions in the realm of
France should be as newter / till the church were brought in to parfyte unity
/ and that done / than every thing to return to the true right. This
counsel was thought good and was accepted of the king and all other. Than
the marshall of France and the bishop of Cambray were ordained to go to
Auignon. They departed fro Paris / and rode till they came to Lions on the
river of Rosne / and the^ they two departed a so^dre / for it was ordained that
the marshall should tarry there still till he herd tidings fro the bishop /
who rode forth and so came to Auygnon. There were some of the cardynalles that
knew well wherefore he came / but they dissymuled the matter to know what pope
Benedic would say. when the bishop of Cambraye had refresshed him at his
lodging / and had changed his apparel / than he went to the popes palayes /
and when he came in the popes presence he made his reverence but not in such
wise as he ought to have done / if he had taken him as pope / as other men did
/ and yet he made him bishop of Cambray / but that promocyon he had by the
means of the lords of France. Than the bishop of Cambray who was well
langaged / both in laten and in french / spoke and showed how he was sent
thither fro the french king and fro the king of Almayne / and so began his
process / and when the bishop came to the vtteraunce of the matter / how the
pope should resygne and depose himself fro the papal dygnyte / and that he
that was at Rome should do likewise. With those words the pope began to
change color / and lift up his voice and said. I have endured great pain
and traueyle for the church / and by good election I was created pope / and
now to depose my self / that shall I never do during my life. and I will that
the french king know that for all his ordinance I will do nothing
thereafter / but I will keep my name and papalyte till I dye. Sir quod the
bishop of Cambray / saving your grace / I took you for more prudent than I
now find you. first demand counsel of your brethren the cardynalles /
and than make answer / for you alone can not make no resystence against them
if they agree to this opinion / nor ye are not able to resyste the puyssaunce
of the kings of France and Almayne. Than two cardynalles that were there such
as the pope had made before / they parceyuynge the matter not lykely to do well
/ rose and said to the pope. Holy father / the bishop of Cambray speaks
well / sir we desire you do herin after his counsel. Well quod the pope I am
content. So they departed for that time / and the bishop went to his lodging
/ and went not to se any cardynals / but dyssymuled him self. The next day be
times the bell sowned to the consistory / and than there was a conuocacyon of
all the cardynalles that were at Iuygnon. They all assembled at the palace /
and entered in to the consistory / and thither was called the bishop of Cambraye
/ who in laten showed at length his message / and the cause of his coming
thither. When he had said than he was answered / how the pope should take
counsel to answer / and in the mean time he to depart out of the house /
and so he did / and in the mean season Benedic and his cardynalles counsayled
together / and were long debatynge of the matter / and many thought it herd and
a contrary matter to put down that they had created. than the cardynall of
Amyence spoke and said. Lords / whether we will or not / it must behoue us to
obey the French king and the king of Almayne / sithe they be conjoined
together / for without the^ we can not live / how be it we should do well
enough with the king of Almayne if the french king would take our part / but
it is otherwise / for he commands us to obey / or else he will stop fro us
the fruits of our benefyces / without the which we can not live. True it is
holy / father that we have created you as pope / on ye condycion that to your
power ye should aid to refourme the church / and to bring it in to parfyte
union / and this ye have always said and mayntayned / therefore sir answer
atemperately / and in such manner as we may praise you / for sir ye ought
better to know your own courage than we. Than diverse other of the cardynalles
said / sir the cardynall of Amyence says well and wisely / wherefore sir we
pray you all in general / that ye will speak / and show us what ye will do.
Than Benedyc answered and said. The union of the church I desire / and I have
taken great pain therein / but sith god of his deuyue grace has provided for
me the papalyte / and that ye have chosen me thereto / as long as I live I will
be pope / and I will not depose my self nouther for king / duke / earl / nor
other treaty / nor by no process nor means / but yt I will abide pope. Than
the cardynals rose up all together with great murmuring / some said he had
spoken well / and some said contrary. Thus they dyffered and were in dyscorde.
The most part departed out of the consystory / and took no leave of the pope /
and returned to their lodgings. Some such as were in this popes favor
tarried still with him. When the bishop of Cambray saw how they departed in
such manner / he knew well they acorded not well / and therewith auaunced him
self / and entered in to the consystory / and so came to the Pope while he sat
still in his see / and without doing of any great reverence said. Sir give me
mine answer / sithe ye have had your counsel about you / ye ought to give
me mine answer that I may return. This pope Benedic who was in great
dyspleasure for the words that the cardynall of Amyence had spoken / said.
Bishop of Cambray I have counsel of diverse of my brethren the cardynals /
who has created me in to the dignyte papal / and have received all the
solemynytyes thereto belongyng / and am written and named pope by all my
subgiettes / and as pope I will abide as long as I live / I will not do the
contrary to dye in the pain / for I have done no cause why to lose it / and
say to our son of France / that hither unto I have taken him as a good
catholyke prince / but now bysynister means if he will enter in to great
error / he will repent it. I pray you to say to him fro me / that he be well
aduysed how he enclyneth to any thing that should trouble his conscience.
Therewith this Benedic rose out of his chair / and went in to his chamber / and
certain cardynalles with him / and the bishop of Cambray returned to his
lodging / and dyned sobrely / and than after took his horse and passed the
bridge of Rone / and came to vile Nefe / and at night lay at Baignoulx / which
partaygned to the Realm of France / and he understood that sir Boucyquant
marshall of France was come to port saint Andrewe a nine leages fro Auygnon.
The next day thither came the bishop of Cambray / and showed him the
answer of Benedic. When the marshall understood that this pope Benedic would
not obey the king his masters ordinance / he said to the bishop. sir ye are
best to return in to France / ye have no more to do here / and I shall
execute that I am commanded to do by the king and his uncles. The next day
the bishop departed and took the way to Albenoys and to Pyne / and the
marshall set clerks awarke to write / and sent for knights / squyers and men
of war through all the country of Viurays / of Vyuieres / and Auuergne to
Mount pellyer / for he had co^myssyon so to do by the king / and also he sent
to the seneschall of Beaucayre / that he should close all the passages as well
by the river of Rone as by land / to the intent that nothing should enter in
to Auignon. He went him self to the pownte saint Esperyte / and closed there
the passage over the river of Rone / that nothing should enter that way in to
Auygnon. Thus the marshall daily gathered men of war / and many came to serve
him / some for obeysaunce / and some to pyll and rob them of Auygnon. There
came to him sir Raymonde of Thourayne / and the lord de la Both / the lord of
Tornon / the lord of Monclaue / and the lord Duses / so yt the marshall had a
great nombre of men. Than the marshall sent an haraulde to defye pope Benedic
in his palace / and all the cardynals that would take his part. This was hard
tidings to the cardynals / and to them in the city of Auygnon / for they
knew well they could not long sustain the war against the puyssaunce of
the French king / than they determined to go and speak with the pope / and
so they did / and showed him how they could not nor would not sustain the
war against the french king / for they said they must live and have their
marchaundyse to go as well by land as by river. This Benedyc answered
folysshly and said: syrs your city is strong and well provided / I will send
for men of war to Gennes and in to other places / and to my son the king
of Aragon / that he come and serve me / which I am sure he will do / for he is
bound thereto for two causes / he is of my lygnage / and also he ought to be
obeysant to the pope. Sirs / ye are abashed of to little a cause / go your
ways and keep and defend your town / and I shall keep my palace. Other
answer the cardynals and the men of the city could not have of this
Benedyc. So every man returned home. This Benedic had of long time purueyed
his palace with wine / corn / larde / oil and of all other things
parteynynge to a fortress: and also he was of his person high and cruel / and
would not be abashed for a little thing. The marshall of France departed fro
pount saint Spyrite / and passed with all his company by the town of Orange /
by consent of the prince of Orange / and so entered in to the country of Venyce
/ which was land parteygnynge to the church / the which anon was over
rynne / and the men of war passed at ye bridge of Sourgnes / and so they were
lords of all the river / and the marshall tarried in the town of Sourgnes with
a great nombre of men of war to keep the town and passage / and also the
garysone of Noues which partayned to the pope. Than the marshall went and
lodged at saint Verayne nere to Auignon / and his men therabout / and daily
came thither men of war / so that the city of Auignon was closed in before
and behind by land and by the river / so that nothing could enter nor issue
without leave. for at the town of Noue without Auygnon / which partayned to
the realm of France / was the seneschall of Beaucayre with five hundred men /
and kept the enter on that side / and the marshall of France with two
thousand men was on the other side of Auignon / and he sent to them of the
city that without they would obey and open their city / that he would burn
all their vynes and houses abroad in the country about to the river of
Dureuse. That so^monynge greatly abashed the men and women within the city /
for their herytages lay without Auignon unto the river of Dureuse. Than they
went to counsel without knowledge of the pope / and they called to their
counsel certain cardynals / as the cardynall of Amyence / of Poictours / of
Newcastell / of Viuyers / and diverse other. Than such as had most to lose
showed these cardynalles how the marshall of France had thretened them to
brinne their vynes and their howses / and all this had caused the french king
/ against whom they could not resyste / for his puyssaunce was so nere them.
and all things consydred / they said they were better to obey to the french
king / than to hold their paryllous opynyons / for of Benedyc they could
have no aid nor comfort / and they demanded of these cardynalles if they
would join and take their part. The cardynals said they were content to take
their ways / for vitayles began to fail them / and also their benefyces
were in the realm of France / which they said they would not wyllyngly lose.
So they entered in to treaty with the marshall of France / the which took
such effect / that all the men of war entered in to the city of Auignon /
and it was appointed to besiege the palace / their couynaunt was to do no hurt
nor dyspleasure to the cardynalles nor to none of their men / nor to the hole
body of the town. This to do the marshall promised. So they entered in to
Auignon / and lodged at their ease and liberty / and than all the passages as
well by land as by water were opened / to the intent that all manner of bytayle
might come to the city.

WHen he that wrote him self pope Benedyc / being closed in his palace) saw
that the cardynals and the men of the city had made a treaty with the
marshall of France without his counsel or advise / he was therewith sore
dyspleased / how be it he said that he would not submytte him self / to dye
in the pain / and so he kept him self close in his palais / which was as
strong a place as any in the world / and most easyest to be kept / so that
it be well vytayled. This pope had sent letters to the king of Aragone
instantly to socoure him in his need / and to send him men of war that he
might be able to resyst the marshall of France also he sent the king word
in his letter / that if he could get him thens fro Auignon / he would go and
keep his see apostolyke in Aragon / at Parpygnon or at Barcelone. The king of
Aragon saw well the popes letters / but he made no force of them / and said to
his counsel that were about him. What / weneth this priest that to sustain
him and his arguments / I shall enterprise to make war against the french
king to aid him / than I might well be reputed a fool? Sir quod his counsel
ye say truth / ye have no need to meddle in that matter / for sir ye may be
sure the french king has such counsel about him / yt he would make no
war against him without a just cause / let the clergy alone / for if they
purpose to live the prelates must obey the great lords (...) whom their
rentes and revenues are / they have long kept them in peace. And also syr^he
french king has written to you all ready / desyringe you to determyne you and
your country to be newter / as he is and will be / and sir ye were best so to
do / for my lady the queen who is the French kings cosyn germayne / is
content so to be / and so is the most part of your realm / and the clergy in
likewise / and specially Catelone and Spain / and sir we think it is the best
opynion / for if all christian kings do not the same the church shall never
come to unity by reasone of two popes. Thus the king of Aragon and his
counsel devised together / and pope Benedic was still in his palace /
trusting to have aid of the king of Aragon / but he was dysceyued / and the
marshall of France was with in the city of Auygnon / and the palace was so
kept that none could issue out nor enter in. They lived with that store they
had / for of vytayles they had suffycient for two or three year / but they
lacked wood to make fire with all / and to sethe their meat / which made
them abashed. Every weke the marshall herd news fro the french king and
the king fro him / and the king commanded him that he should not depart
thens till he had atchyued his enterprise. Thus the pope could not issue out of
ye palace / there was such watch laid on him.

THe conclusyon was / when this Benedyc saw that he was so straytely kept /
and that fire failed him / and other prouysions daily dyscreased / and saw
that no comfort nor aid came to him fro no part / at last he yielded / at
the request of certain of the cardynalles / and the treaty was thus / yt he
should not depart out of Auignon till there were made an union in the church
/ and a certain guard was set about him / and the cardynalles and rich men
of Auignon bound them self to keep this Benedyc so strayte / that they should
render account of him again / outher quycke or deed. Such cardynals as had
their benefyces in France took great pain to make this treaty and
composycion / for they said all with one accord / that they would abide with
the french king. Thus this business ended at yt time / and every man
departed / and the Marshall went to Paris / and anon after he ordained him to
go in to the realm of Hungery / for the king of Hungery had written to the
french king how Lamorabaquy assembled great puyssaunce of men of war / of
turks / arabyes / tartaryes / and suryens / and of diverse other of his sect /
to fight with him. The earl of Derby the same season being at Paris in the
house of Clyssone / nere to the temple / was willing to go in to Hungery /
which should be the less cost to the French king / for he had every weke
ready paid him five hundred crowns of gold / and the earl thought him self
much bound to the french king for that grace / and when that tidings came
fro the king of Hungery in to France / the earl of Derby intended well to
that matter / and thought in him self that voyage to be right honorable for
him to pass his time there / whereby he should the lightlyer forget the time of
his trouble / and spoke to them of his special counsel / and they counsayled
him to go in that voyage / so that he knew first the duke of Lancastre (his
fathers) pleasure in that behalf. Than the earl one of his knights called
Dinorth in to England / to know his fathers pleasure. This knight came in to
England / and found the duke of Lancastre at a Castle a twenty mile fro
London / called Hertforde. There he showed him his sons entente. And when the
duke understood the mind of the earl his son / and the good will that he had
to go in to Hungery / to pass the time of his banyssment / he was right well
content / and said to the knight. sir / ye be welcome / your words and my
sons lettre requires counsayle^ ye shall rest you here with us a season /
and in the mean while we shall take advise / and in the while ye may go and se
my sons children / for ye must bear tidings of them to their father. Sir
quod the knight ye say true. So this knight sir Dynorth tarried a season in
England.

Now had the french king good occasyon to write to the king of Almayne and
to his counsel in / what case he had brought pope Benedic and the
cardynalles. The king than sent thither a noble ambassade / as the patryarke of
Iherusalem. / sir Charles of Hangers / and other knights / and they found the
king at Strawbourgh and did their message / wherewith the king and his
counsel were well content / and said how they would determyne on that matter
/ but they said / they would gladly that the king of England should take the
same way / the which they feared should be herd to do. with this answer
the ambassadors returned in to France / and showed the king what they had
done and seen. The french king than to thentent to bring his purpose to
pass / sent again in to England to king Richard / and the messangers
showed the king the cause of their coming. The king gave good herynge to
the matter / but as than he had not the prelates of the realm nor the clergy
with him / nor were not so pliable to follow his pleasure / as they in France
to follow the pleasure of their king / and this he showed to the french
kings messangers / how be it he said he would do his deuoyre / and so he
did. And so the messangers returned in to France and king Richard on a day
at Westmynster assembled all his prelates and clergy of England / and when
they were there ye king showed wisely the dyfference that was in the church /
and how the french king by delyberacyon and advise of counsel / and by
consent of the vnyuersite of Paris and other clerks / he was determined to be
newter / and in likewise so are the kings of Spaygne / of Scotland / of
Aragone / and of Nauer / and how that all Almayne / Boesme / and Italy / were
of the same opinion. In likewise the king of England / desired that his
realm should follow the same. When the prelates and the clergy / who knew
nothing why they were sent for / herd that matter they had great marueyle /
and were sore abashed / some stood still and spoke no word / and some began
to murmr and said. Our king is become french / he entendeth to nothing /
but to dishonor and distroy us / but he shall not. What / would he bring us
out of our believe / he may do so much that he shall have yuell thereof / let
us not follow this opynion / sithe the french king takes that way / let
him hold him self newter / and let us hold still our believe / and let no
man put it fro us / without there be greater apparaunce of a surer foundacyon /
than we se as yet. When king Richard saw the dyfference and murmuring of the
clergy / he caused the bishop of London to demand of all the clergy what
was best to do. They all answered that the matter was so great / that therein
required great counsel and delyberacyon / and so they departed / and every
man went to his lodging. And when the londoners knew the cause of that
assemble / and the request that the king had made / they were than sore
troubled against ye king / for the people of England were so fermely set on
the beleuynge on the pope at Rome / that they would not leave it / and said
how that Richard of Burdeaulx would distroy them all if he be let alone / his
heart is so french that he can not hyde it / but a day will come to pay
for all / that he shall repent him and all such as give him such counsel.
What so ever the king said to have his people newter / they would in no wise
agree thereto. And the french king was not well content with his son king
Richard / in that he had not incontinent caused his realm to have been newter
/ but to say the troth / the king was not to blame therein. And also such
accydentes fell soon after / the which were so great and horrible that the
like has not ben seen in all this hystorye upon no king christian / except of
noble king Peter of Lusygnen / king of Cyper and Iherusalem / whom his own
brother and the cypriens martyred.

Of the answer of the / Duke of Lancastre to the knight sent to him fro his
son the earl of Derby / and how the duke of Lancastre dyed. Cap. CC.xxxiiii.
When sir Dinorth Whom the earl of Derby had sent in to England to his father
the duke of Lancastre and had his answer of the duke / and had vysyted all the
earls lands / and had seen his children four sons and two daughters / than
he took his leave and return in to France. His answer was / how that the
duke would not counsel the earl his son to go in to Hungery / but when he
was weary of being in France / than rather to go in to Castle to the king
there / and to his suster / and if he list to go further / than to go and
vysite his other suster the queen of Portugale. The earl read his fathers
letters two times over / and studied thereon a season. and sir Dinorth showed
him that the physicions and surgyons in England said surely / how that the
duke his father had on him a paryllous sycknesse / which should be his death.
these words greatly let the earl to take on him any manner of voyage / but so
tarried still at Paris / and often times he went and saw the french king / the
duke of Orlyaunce / and the kings uncles / and always they made him good
chere so that he was much bound to them / and he said to the king. Sir / ye
do me so much honor and curtesy / and show me so great sign of love / that
I know not in all my life days how to deserve it / but if ever I come in
England my lady yt queen your daughter to my power shall have my service. I
thank you cosyn quod the king. So it fell that about the feast of Crystmasse
/ duke Johan of Lancastre / who lived in great dyspleasure / what because the
King had banysshed his son out of the realm for so litell a cause / and
also because of the yuell gouernynge of the realm / by his nephewe king
Richard / for he saw well that if he long percepuered and were suffered to
contynewe / the realm was lykely to be utterly lost. With these ymagynacyons
and other / the duke fell sick whereon he dyed / whose death was greatly
sorowed of all his friends and lovers. The king by that he showed took no great
care for his death / but sone he was forgotten. Than certain of the noble men
of England saw well how the realm feblysshed / sithe the duke of Lancastre
was deed / and the duke of Gloucestre his brother slain / and the earl of
Arundell. and the earl of Derby banysshed / who ought than to be duke of
Lancastre by right succession. Than some said. Now we shall se what the king
will do / it is time now yt he repeal home again his cosyn of Derby / and to
pardone him his yuell will / though he have no cause to be dyspleased with him
/ it were time he came and entered in to his lands as duke of Lancastre. Such
words ran a broad in the Realm in diverse places / and specially in the
city of London / where the earl of Derby was a hundred times better beloved
thanne the king / how be it for all the words and murmuryng that the king
and his counsel knew of / yet he did nothing thereafter / but clean the
contrary. He was yuell counsayled / for if he had incontinent after the death
of the duke of Lancastre sent for the earl of Derby / and at his coming have
frendely welcomed him home and have called him duke of Lancastre / and have
taken him as greatest personage in England next him self / and have said
how he would be governed in all points after his advise and counsel / and
to do nothing without his advise / than the king had done well / and lykely
to have continued his estate as king of England / and had not received the
yuell fortune that fell to him shortly after / as ye shall here after.

How the death of the duke of Lancaster was known in France. the king of
England wrote in manner of joy to the French king thereof / and wrote nothing
thereof to therle of Derby who was the dukes son^e. Cap. CC.xxxv.
Tidings of the duke of Lancasters death came in to France / and king
Richard of England in manner of joy wrote thereof to the french king / and
not to his cosyn therle of Derby / how be it the earl knew it as soon as the
French king or sooner / by such men as he had in England. Than the earl
apparelled him and all his men in black / and caused his obsequy to be done
right honorably / at the which was the French king and his brother the duke
of Orlyaunce / and all ye kings uncles / with a great nombre of prelates and
great lords of France. For the earl of Derby was well-beloved with every man /
and many were right sorry of his trouble / for he was a pleasant knight and an
honest person / curtesse and sweet / and meke to every man / and every man that
saw him said / how ye king of England was not well counsayled / that he
repealed / him not home again. And truly to say truth / if the king of
England had wisely regarded the matter / and had been well counsayled / the
matter had not turned against him as it did. For the earl of Derby / after the
death of his father / was right enherytoure to be duke of Lancastre / and to
have been the second person of the realm / and by whom all the business of
the realm should chiefly have passed. Also the king and his counsel ought
to have consydred / how often times the people of England had styrred and
murmured against him: and should have known / how he was not very well-beloved
of the people / nor of some knights / and other: and how that in ye duke of
Gloucesters days / he was often times in danger of his person. As when the
Londoners and the counsaylles of diverse good towns in England ca^e to him to
Eltham / and there made their requests / that all subsidies and ayes given and
granted within twenty year / should have been frustrate and fordone / or else
they were determined by the consent of the duke of Gloucestre / and other noble
men of the Realm / to have taken the king and to have set another to have
reigned in his place / and to have put ye king and the Queen in to a place /
and so to have had meat and drink as long as they had lived. In somoche /
that the duke of Gloucester had desired a nephewe of his / son to the
daughter of the duke of Clarence / who was called Johan earl of March: That he
would have taken on him the charge and gouernyng of the realm / and that they
would have made him king. But the same earl excused him self honestly therfro.
All these things were apeased and laid down / by the wise sad means and
prudence of the said duke of Lancastre / father to this said earl of Derby.

IF king Richard had wisely consydred all these mats / he had reigned in
gretter prosperity than ever he did before. King Richard knew all this well
enough / and so by yuell counsel the king caused by color of love / the
duke of Gloucestre to be taken and led to Calays / where he was strangled and
murdered. Whereof great brute was through out all the realm with great grudge
and murmuracyons / so that it was at the point to have deposed the said king
Richard. How be it the duke of Lancastre like a sage and a prudent price for
all that the duke of Gloucestre was his brother / and that the murderyng of him
touched him nere to his heart. All things consyred / and that he could not
recover again his brother / wisely and amiably he apeased all these matters.
And the king his nephue more feared in England than he was before. All this
the king ought to have consydred / and specially how therle of Derby was
better beloved with the people / than any other man within the realm. All
these things wisely co^sidred after the death of the duke rf Lancaster / the
king should have repealed therle of Derby again in to the Realm / but the
king had no mind so to do / for he did clean the contrary / for incontinent he
sent his officers in to all the duke of La^casters lands and took the
profits thereof to him self / and said / that as long as therle of Derby
stood as a banysshed man / that he nor none of his should receive any revenues
of any lands within the realm of England. And moreover (whereof the king was
greatly blamed of such as loved the earl and his children) The king gave away
lands parteynynge to the heritage of the duchy of Lancastre to some of his
servants / such as asked them for the which cause / many knights and other
in England spoke and said. The king shows well that he owes no good will to
his cosyn the earl of Derby / sithe he will not repeal him home again: and
suffer his lands to be given away / where as therle and his children should
be great members in England / and a good staff for the king to lean by. But
he does the contrary / for he drives him away / and so will keep him in this
danger and worse if he could. For he has taken to him self his heritage /
and causes his officers to medell with the dukes lands / as though they were
his own. And if yt poor tenauntes complain of the iniuryes done to them in
their lords absence / they can not be hard: there is none yt will do them
right Also it is but a small token of love / that the king bears to the earl
of Derby and to his children / for their heritage of Lancaster which should
come to the^ by right enherytau^ce / descended fro their grandame the lady
Blanch / daughter to duke Henry of Lancastre. The king gives part thereof
away where as it pleases him / and such lands as should fall to them by the
right of the lady their mother / who was daughter to the earl of Herforde and
Northampton / and constable of England. The king gives part thereof at his
pleasure. This is to much done against all right and reason / and to the
displeasure of all the noble men of England: this can not long endure
vnamended. Thus the prelates / noble men / and commons in England co^muned and
murmured.

IN likewise in ye realm of France / such men of honor as herd speaking of
this matter / and had seen earl of Derby at Paris / had great marueyle
thereof / and said one to another. As we think / the king of England has
takenne to great a displeasure with his cosyn the earl of Derby / who is the
greattest man in Englad next him self. He is a gracious knight / curtesse /
meke / and tretable / and a man good to be spoken unto. The king of England
knows some other thing by him than we do / or else the king is yuell
counsayled. And it is marueyle / that the French king and his brother the
duke of Orlyaunce / and the kings uncles / do not attemper the matter / for the
earl is daily among them. They should find best prouisyon in this case /
for the king of England will do more for the^ than for any men / because he
has married the French kings daughter. But sithe they do nothing therein / it
is best we hold our peace and let it pass. As for the French king and
his brother and his uncles / thought nothing but good. They honored and loved
greatly the earl of Derby / and desired much his company: and they saw well
he was a wydower and to marry / and that the duke of Berry had a daughter a
wydowe of two husbands / she was but young of a xxiii. year of age / and was
named Mary. Her first husband was Loys of Bloys who died young: and her
second husband was ye lord Philyppe of Arthoys earl of Ewe / who died in his
return in Hungry: as ye have herd here before. This marriage was at apoynt to
have concluded / for they in France knew well that the duke of Lancastre was
a great enherytoure in England / and the French king was well pleased
therewith / because his daughter was Queen of England. for he thought that the
company of those two ladies together should be great pleasure to the^ both /
sithe they were so nere of blood. And thereby the two realms of France and
England / should be the surer conjoined toguyder in love and peace / which
was true / if it might have been accomplysshed. but king Richard of England
and his counsel brake all that matter / for the fortunes of this world which
are marvelous: nor a thing that shall be can not be eschewed. The which
fortune of this king Richard was so marvelous / that it is hard to think
thereon. The king might well have remedyed the matter if he had would / but that
that shall be shall be. I shall show you what I Johan Froissarte / auctour of
this history / Herd whan^e I was but young in England / in a place called
Bertamstede / which as at that time parteyned to the price of Wales / father
to this said king Richard / it was in the year of grace / a thousand three
hundred three score and two. And because ye same time the prince and the princes
should depart out of England to go in to Acq^tayne to keep their estate
there. King Edward his father and queen Phillyppe my maistres / and Lion duke
of Clarence / Johan duke of Lancastre / and the lord Edmonde / who was after
Earl of Cambridge and duke of york / and their children / were come to the
said manner place / to se the prince and princes or they departed. And as than I
was of the age of.xxiiii. year / and one of my said lady the queen's clerks of
her chamber. And as I satte on a benche I herd a knight talkyng and deuysinge
among diverse ladies and damoselles of the Queen's / and said to them. There is
a book in this country called the Brust / and many men say / it is of
marvelous prophycies. But according to that book / the realm and crown of
England should not return to the price of Wales / nor yet to the duke of
Clarence / nor that they should be kings of England / though they were sons
to king Edward but this knight said / that according to that book / the crown
of England should come to the house of Lancastre. The same season when this
knight spoke these words / this said Henry earl of Derby was not borne / nor
yet seuyn year after. but yet in my days the same words took effect / for I
saw after / the same Henry earl of Derby king of England.

Of a treaty of a marriage between the earl of Derby and the duke of Berries
daughter / and how king Richard of England did let it by the earl of
Salisbury. Capi. CC.xxxvi.
AS soon as king Richard king of England herd of the treaty of the marriage
between the earl of Derby and the duke of Berryes daughter / and that the
parties were nereha^de accorded / he took those news to great dyspleasure /
and said to the earl of Salisbury in whom he had great affyaunce. ye must or
dayne you to go in to France with letters of credence / to our father in law
the French king / and to our friends his brother and uncles. And show them
fro us / that in no wise they conclude any treaty or alyaunce of marriage /
with such a traitor as is the earl of Derby / who would betray his natural
sovereign lord. And for the remynaunt of the matter ye are wise enough / do so
therein that I may can you thank / and that the marriage may be broken. The
earl of Salisbury said. Sir / I shall do right well your commandment. But
sir / if it might be broken by some other means / or by some other person / I
require your grace it may so be. Sir quod the king excuse you natte / for I
will and also I pray you do this message / and whatsoever shall fall thereof I
shall sustain you. Well sir quod the earl / sith ye command me so specially
/ and that I se the matter touches you nere I shall do it / though I be loathe
thereto. ye shall go quod the king and make haste / or this alyaunce be
concluded. Than the Earl prepared for his departure. The letters of Credence
written and sealed / he departed fro the king / who was at that time at Leads
/ and the Queen also. The earl made haste and came to Dover / and so took the Sea and arrived at Calays / and there found the earl of Huntyngton / who was
captain of Calais and brother to the king. The Earl showed unto him all his
business / and so tarried not long at Calays / but roode to Amyence and so to
Paris / and all they way that he rode he had good chere / and was lodged at
the white horse. And when he had changed him he went to the king and to the
queen / and to yt other lords / and delivered his letters of credence. When
the king had reed the letters / he took the earl aparte and demanded what was
his credence. The earl at length showed his charge / and named the Earl of
Derby traitor against his natural lord. When the French king herd those
words he was in great displeasure / for he loved so the earl of Derby / that
he would here none yuell spoken of him / and took the letters of credence
again to the earl of Salisbury / and said. Earl / we believe you well enough /
but our son of England is to sore moved against our cosyn of Derby / and we
marueyle greatly / that his yuell will contyneweth so long / for we think he
should be the better furnysshed if he were about him / and to be next of his
counsel. Sir quod the earl of Salisbury / I do but as I am commanded. That
is true quod the king / we are not displeased with you / and paraduenture our
son of England knows more than we do: do your message as ye were charged /
and so he did / and to the duke of Berrey also. The duke gave none answer
thereto / but went to the king and demanded of him what news he had out of
England. The king showed him all / as the earl of Salisburye had said. Upon
those news the king and his uncles assembled together secretly. than the
French king said. The king of England by lykelyhode douteth greatly therle
of Derby / or else paradue^ture he knows such things as we know not / nor
can not come to our knowledge. And we ought rather to owe our favor to the
king of England than^e to the earl of Derby / sithe the king is joined with
us by marriage. And he will take it in great disdain sithe we be enfourmed of
his pleasure / if we should do the contrary / and marry the earl of Derby to
the countess of Ewe. It behooves us rather to dissymule and keep these news
secret / till the earl of Salisbury be returned. Upon this peynt the king and
his uncles rested.

When the earl of Salisbury had done his message / he took his leave and
departed. The French king was more displeased with his coming than joyful /
for he delivered again the earl of Salysbury his letters of credence / and
would not keep them / he loved so well the earl of Derby / who knew of the
earl of Salysburies being at Paris / but he saw him not / for he was departed
without spekyng with him and returned to Calays / and to in to England / and
showed the king of England how he had spedde. When the earl or Derby knew
that the earl of Salisbury was departed fro Paris / without speaking with him /
in his mind he was soore displeased / and thought the matter went not well.
than his counsel said to him. Sir / shortly ye shall parceyue some other
matters / that ye have not herd of as yet / though it be kept priuye fro you.
These Frenchmen are wise and close. It may be so / that the king of England /
and such as be of his sect are displeased / with that the French king makes
you so good chere as he does. And paradue^ture it is spoken in England / how
ye should mary the duke of Berryes daughter / which pleases not the king of
England / and therefore he will do what he can to break that marriage / and if
it be so ye shall shortly here thereof.

Look as they ymagined so it was / for within a month after the earl of
Salisbury was departed fro Paris / such of therle of Derbies part as had the
treaty of the said marriage in hand. They spoke again of the matter to the
duke of Berryes counsel / who had their charge what they should answer. They
said. sirs When my lord the earl of Derby is in the kings presence / and the
duke of Orlyaunce and his uncles present / than let my lord the earl of
Derby speak him self / for we can say no more to the matter. Therle of Derby
who thought none yuell / but thought those words had been spoken / to the
intent to have proched nerer to the point / for the king and his counsel
made him as good chere thanne / as ever they did before. The Earl thought to
speak in the matter / when he saw conuenyent time. And on a day whan^e he saw
the king and the lords together / he began to speak of this marriage. Than the
duof Burgoyne / who had the charge to answer him said. Cosyn of Derby / we
have nothing to do to give in marriage over cosyn to a traitor. With that
word the earl of Derby was greatly abashed / and changed color and said.
Sir / I am here in the kings presence / I will answer to this. I was never
traitor nor never thought trayson: and if there be any person yt will charge
me with trayson I am ready to answer / now or wha^ it shall please the king /
here being present. Nay cosyn quod the king / I believe ye shall find no man in
France that will challenge your honor / for the words that mine uncle has
spoken came out of England. than the earl kneled down and said. Sir / I
believe it well. But god defend me and all my friends / and confound all mine
enemies. The French king took up the earl / and said. Cosyn / apeace your
self / every thing shall turn to the best. And whan^e every thing is
agreed and at peace / than^e we may well speak and treat of marriage / but
first ye must take possession in the duchy of Lancastre / for that is the usage
in France / and in diverse countries on this side the Sea. That if a lord
shall marry by the consent of his soueraygne lord / he must endowe his wife.
and therewith they had spyces and wine / and cessed of that co^munycacion / and
every man departed to their own lodgings.

When the earl of Derby was come to his lodgyng he was sore displeased / and
not without a cause. When he / who was reputed one of the trewest knights of
the world (in the presence of the french king who loved him well / and had
showed him many courtesies) should be reputed as a traitor and that those words
should come out of England and brought by the earl of Salisburye. He was
therewith in a great malencoly / his counsel apeased him as well as they could
/ and said. Sir / he that will live in this world / must endure sometime
trouble. Confort you for this time and be pacient / and parauenture herafter ye
shall have great joy and glory. And sir / of al ye lords on this side the sea / the french king loves you best. and we se well he would enploye his
pain to bri^ge you to joy. and sir / ye ought to give him and his uncles
great thank / in that they kept this matter secret / till the earl of
Salisbury was deperted. yea sirs quod the earl / I think it had been better it
had been showed me in his presence / that I might have made a sufficient excuse
before yt king and all the lords. thus I shall abide still in blame till the
matter be otherwise declared. Sir quod they all / trespasses can not be amended
at the first day. Sir suffer / let the time ryn: we believe your business in
England does better than ye be ware of. The love that is in the hertes of the
people in England toward you with their good prayers / by ye grace of god /
shall shortly deliver you out of all dangers. This they said to reco^fort
their lord / who was sore disconforted / and their saying was sooner true than
they were ware of.

Anon it was known in England how therle of Salisbury had been in France
with the french king and his uncles / and borne letters thither / conteynyng
how the earl of Derby was falsely perjured and a traitor. Of the which
diverse noble men and prelates were sore troubled / and were nothing content
with the earl of Salisbury / and said generally / that he was soore to blame to
take on him the charge / to bear in to France any such words / upon as
true a man as lived. A day will come that he shall repent the time / yt ever
he spoke the word. ye may well know / the Londoners were greatly displeased
/ and murmured against the king and his counsel / and said. A ge^tyll knight
earl of Derby / great envy is there against you. It is not suffycient for the
king and his counsel to drive you out of the realm / but also to accuse you
of trayson / to put you to the more shame and rebuke. Well / every thing
must have his turn. Alas quod the people: What fault or trespass has your
children done / that the king takes thus away fro the^ their heritage /
which ought to be theirs by right succession? This thing can not long abide
in this case without change / nor we can not suffer it. Thus anon after the
return of the earl of Salisbury out of France / king Richard caused a
iustes to be cried and publysshed through out his realm / to Scotland / to
be at Wynsore / of.xl. knights and xl. squyers against all co^mers. And they
to be aparelled in grene with a white faucon and the queen to be there / well
aco^panied (...) a dies and damsels. This feast thus holden / ye queen being
there i^ great neblenes / but there were but few lords or noble men / for mo
tha^.ii. pertes of ye lords and knights / and other of the realm of England
had yt king in such hatered / what for the banysshyng of the earl of Derby /
and the iniuryes that he had done to his children / and for the death of the
duke of Gloucestre / who was slain in the castle of Calais / and for the
death of the earl of Aru^dell who / was beheeded at London. The kynred of these
lords came not to this feast / nor but few other. And at the same feast the
king ordained to go in to Irelande / to enploy his men in that voyage / and so
he departed and left the Queen with her train still at Wyndsore / and the
king rode to Bristowe / and there made all his prouysion / and he had ten
thousand knights and squiers / and ten thousand archers. Whan^e the
Londoners knew that the king was going in that voyage they began to murmr /
and said among themself. Now gothe Richard of Bordeaux the way to Bristowe
/ and so in to yrelande / which will be to his destruction. He shall never
return again with joy / no more than did king Edward the second his
great grauntfather / who was folysshely governed by to much beleuyng of the
Spe^sers. In likewise Richard of Burdeaulx / has belued so much yuell
counsel / that it can not be hydden nor suffered any lengar.

How king Richard ordained to go in to the marchesse of Irelande. Cap.
CC.xxxvii.
THere were many knights and squyers in the kings company / that should go
with him in to Irela^de that were not content with him / and went in manner
with an yuell will / and said oftentimes one to another. Our king governs
him self folisshely / and believes yuell counsel. Such words were so
multiplied / that the lord Henry Percy and sir Henry his son^e spoke certain
words / which came to the kings knowledge and to his counsel / and it was
said to the king. Sir the words ought not to be suffered / that the earl of
Northumberlande and his son^e has spoken / for it is to set your subiettes
against you. It must behoue you to correct all these rebels one after
another / whereby they that be greattest shall doubt you / and take ensample.
That is true quod the king / but than what is best to do. Sir quod they /
they be not here with you / but they ought to come. and when they become / call
them before you / and than by the earl of Salisbury and by some other / as it
shall please you / let it be rehearsed to them / the yuell words that they
have spoken against you and your counsel. Tha^ shall you here what answer
they will make: and thereupon ye may taken advise / wheder ye will correct
them by prison / or other wise. Well sirs quod the king / ye say well / this
shall be done. The earl of Northumberlande and his son^e had good friends in that
army / so that some of them knew the kings intent: And they sent such word
to the earl and to his son / that they should natte come in the kings
presence / nor to go in that journey. For they had word that if they did /
it should not be for their welthe / but to their great do^mage / for the king
was sore informed against them. When they had this warning / they stopped
their coming to the king / and not without good cause. For they were showed
that and if they came / they should be in ieopardye of their lives. When ye
kings counsel saw that therle and his son^e came not / they said to the
king. Sir / now ye may se whyder we did inform you of the truth or not.
ye may se therle and his son disdayneth to serve you / for they will not
come at your commandment / and that shall ye se if ye send for them. And I
shall send for them quod the king. Than letters were written and sent by
notable messangers / to therle and to the lord Henry Percy his son. The
content of the letters was / that incontinent without delay upon the sight of
those letters / that they should come to ye king and do their duty / as they
were bound to do. These messangers iourneyed so long / that they came to
fair castle of the earls / standing on the fronter of Scotland. The
messanger acquyted him well in doing of his message / as he was commanded.
Therle reed his letters at length / and than showed them to his son. Than
they took advise to make the messanger good chere / and to write again to the
king in excusing of them selfs / how they could not come out of their
country as at that time / and how that the king had men ynowe to aco^plysshe
his journey beside them. The messangers returned to the king / and delivered
the earls lettre. The king read it the which answer was nothing pleasant
to the king nor to his counsel / and thanne for this cause and for other
things that were laid to the Earls charge and to his sons / they were
openly banysshed the realm of England / till ye king did repeal them again.
This was publysshed through out all the cities and good towns of England /
and specially in London / whereof the londoners had great marueyle / nor they
could not know justly for what cause it was / for the earl and his son were
reputed for noble and as valiant men as any within the realm. Some said / it
comes by some of the kings counsel that hates them / which counsel
will distroy the king at last / peradventure the earl and his son have spoken
some words upon the king and his counsel / for the yuell gouernynge of the
realm / and could not be herd though they said the troth / and for their
true saying now they be punisshed / but we think herafter they will be
punysshed yt now judge them. Thus the londoners and other spoke of this matter.
The earl had a brother a valiant knight sir Thomas percy / who had of a long
time done many noble seruyces to the king of England. when the earl knew
that he and his son were banysshed the realm / he took it for an
unreasonable punysshment without cause. Than he sent for all his friends in
the country / such as he could get together / for many of his lygnage were
with the king to go in to Irelande. The earl took counsel of them what was
best to do sithe the king had banysshed him without cause. Than he was
counsayled to send in to the realm of Scotland / and to desire the king
there that he and his son might abide peasably in Scotland / till the king
of England were apeased of his dyspleasure. Thus therle sent to king Robert
of Scotland / and the king and the earl Archambalt Duglas / and the other
lords of Scotland condiscendyd lightly to the earls desire / and sent the
earl word how they should be gladly received / and also if they neded of five
or sire hundred spears / if they were signyfied of the time they should be
ready to serve them. This message pleased greatly the earl and his lygnage / and
so the earl tarried still in his country among his friends / for king
Richard and his counsel had so much to do in sort season after / that they
had no layser to do any dyspleasure to the earl nor to his son / as ye shall
here after in this hystory.

King Richard thus being about Bristowe / than the state generally of all
men in England began to murmr and to rise one against another / and
mynystrynge of justice was clean stopped up in all courts of England / whereof
the valiant men and prelates / who loved rest and peace / and were glad to
pay their duetyes / were greatly abashed / for there rose in the realm
companyes in diverse rowtes / keeping the feldes and high ways / so that
merchants durst not ride abroad to excercyse their marchaundyse for doubt of
robbynge / and no man knew to whom to compain to do them right / reasone /
and justice / which things were right preiudyciall and dyspleasaunt to the
good people of England / for it was contrary to their accustomable usage / for
all people laborers and merchants in England were wont to live in rest and
peace / and to occupy their marchaundyse peasably / and the laborers to labor
their lands quyetly / and than it was contrary / for when merchants rode fro
town to town with their marchaundyse / and had outher gold or silver in
their purces / it was taken fro them / and fro other men / and laborers out of
their houses. these companyons would take whete / ootes / bufes / muttons /
porkes / and the pore men durst speak no word. these yuell deeds daily
multyplyed so that great complayntes and lamentacyons were made thereof through
out the realm / and the good people said / the time is changed upon us fro
good to yuell / ever sithe the death of good king Edward the third / in
whose days justice was well kept and mynystred. In his days there was no man
so hardy in England to take a hen or a chekyn / or a sheep without he had
paid trewly for it / and now^ a days all that we have is taken fro us / and
yet we dare not speak / these things can not long endure / but that
England is lykely to be lost without recovery. We have a king now that will
do nothing / he entendeth but to ydelnesse and to acomplysshe his pleasure /
and by that he shows / he cares not how every thing gothe / so he may
have his will. it were time to provide for remedy / or else out enemies will
rejoice and mock us / our king has set his brother the earl of Huntyngdon
at Calais / thereby peradventure may be made some yuell treaty and bargayne for
the town of Calays with the french men / and render in to their hands that
thing that is most necessary for the realm of England / for if Calays were
rendered to the French men / England was never so abashed as it should be
than / and good cause why / for than should be lost the chief key of England.

THus multyplyed the lamentacyons and murmuring in England / and the prelates
and other rich men of the realm came to London to dwell / there to be in the
better surety. They of the lygnages of such lords as the king had put to
death and banisshed the realm / they were glad of all this / and would that
more trouble had been in the realm / and the cytezins of London who were rich
/ and lived by their marchaundyse as well coraunt by see as by land / and
kept thereby great estate / and by ensample of them all the remnau^t of the
realm lightly followed / they saw well that as great myschiefe was lykely to
follow in the realm / as was sometime in king Edward the secondes days /
when the lord Spencer caused the king to put out of the realm the queen
Isabell and Edward her son / and would have distroyed them / and wyste not
why / and so were out of the Realm more than three year / but finally when the
men in England and specially the londoners saw how that the king was so
asotted on this sir Hugh spenser / they provided for a remedy / for they sent
secretly to the queen Isabell that if she could get three hundred men of war
/ and to come in to England / she should find ye greatest part of the realm
and the londoners ready to receive her / and to put her in possessyon of the
realm / whereupon the queen found the lord Johan of Haynalt lord of Beaumont
and of Chynay / and brother to the earl Guillyam of Haynalte / who what for
love and pytie took on him the vyage to bring the queen and her son in to
England with four hundred men of war / and so aryued in England / and by
the aid of the londoners the queen atchyued her enterprise / for without their
aid it would have been hard to have come to pass. and so king Edward was
taken at the castle of Bristowe / and set in prisone in the castle of Berkley
/ and such as favored him slain and put to execusion / and Edward his son
crowned king at Westmynster. All this ye londoners right well remembered / for
they that were young herd this reported of their elders / and some found it
in writynge / and they said secretly one to a another. Our fathers and
antecessours of old time provided for these great mischiefs / and we think
there was never greater cause than now at this present time / for suffer this
king Richard to have his will and he will waste and dystroy all / for sithe he
was king there has not been in England such prosperyte as was before / he
shows not that the prince of Wales should be his father / for if he had / he
would have followed his conditions and have taken great pleasure in his prowes /
and not to live in rest and ease as he does / for he loves nothing but
sport and ydelnesse with ladies / and to be always in their company / and to
believe men of small reputacyon / and to gather great richesse / and distroy the
realm / which things ought not to be suffered. And because that valiant man
the duke of Gloucestre saw clearly yt the matters in England went not as they
should do by right / and saw how daily it was worse and worse / and because
he spoke plainly thereof / the traitors that be about the king caused him to
be murdered / and in likewise the good earl of Arundell. and have driven out
of the realm that valiant young knight Henry of Lancastre earl of Derby / by
whom the realm might and ought to be counsayled and sustained / and by his
four sons that he has. And yet for more cruelty beside the do^mage that
they cause the father to suffer out of the realm / they dysenheryte the
children / and the heritage that was their auntes / the lady dame Blanch of
Lancastre is daily given away / to them that are not worthy to have them. And
also because the earl of Northumberlande and his son the lord Henry Percy
have somewhat spoken acordynge to reasone / king Richard has banysshed them /
it is well apparau^t that with in a short time there shall never a valiant
man be left in the realm / wherefore all will rynne to naught without remedy
be found shortly / and we think the best remedy were to send for the earl
of Derby / who / leseth his season in France / and when he is come let him
have the governance of the realm / that he may refourme all yuell / and
bring it in to good state / and let them be punysshed that have deserved /
and let Richard of Bordeaux be taken and set in the tower of London / and
all his fautes put in writynge in artycles / of the which there will be found
a great nombre / and by that time they be examined / it shall be seen clearly
that he is not worthy to bear a crown / nor to keep a realm / for his own
de des shall confound him.

How the archebysshop of Caunterbury was sent in to France to the earl of
Derby / fro the londoners and other counsayls of England to have him to
return in to England. Cap. CC.xxxviii.
THus the londoners co^munded together / and not al only they / but also in
diverse other places of the realm / but the chyefe murmuracyon that the people
were in / was by the first set ring on of them of London / for the commons of
London were as chief / and by them lightly all other commons would be ruled /
and upon the myschiefe that they saw apparaunt in England / they had diverse
secret counsayles to gyther / and with them certain prelates and other
knights of the realm / and they concluded to send in to France for the earl
of Derby / and were determined when he were come to show him the yuell
gouernynge of king Richard / and to put to him the crown and gouernynge of
the realm of England / and so to make him king and his heirs for ever so
that he will keep the realm in all good vsages. Than it was thought that he
that should go in that message must be a wise man and of good credence / for
they thought it should be a great matter to get the earl of Derby out of
France / for they said that for any simple words of a mean messanger / or
for any letters / he would give no faith there to / but rather think it
should be to betraye him. Than the archebysshoppe of Caunterbury a man of
honor and prudence / was desired to do that message / who for the common
profit of the realm acorded to go at their desires / and ordained for his
departure so wisely yt none knew thereof / but such as ought to know it / and
so he took a ship at London / and but seven all only with him / and so past
without any parell and came to Sluse in Flaunders / and fro thens to
Ardenbourge / and so to Gaunte / to And warpe / to Athe in Brabant / and to
Conde / and so to Valencennes / and there took his lodging at the sign of the
Swanne in the market place / and there tarried a three days / and refressed
himself. He rode not like no bishop but like a monk pilgrim / and
dyscouered to no man what he was nor what he intended to do. The fourth day he
departed and took a man to be his guide to Paris / saying how he would go a
pilgrimage to saint More. He did so much that he came thither where as the earl
of Derby was at a place called vyncetour beside Paris. When the earl of Derby
saw the bishop of Caunterbury coming to him / his heart and spyrites
reioysed / and so did all such as were about him / for he thought well than
to here some news out of England. The bishop showed not as than the cause
of his coming / but dissymuled because every man should not know his intent /
and therefore to cover his business / he said openly / he was come on
pilgrimage to saint Mors. All such as were about the earl thought it had been
so. When the bishop saw his time he took a part the earl of Derby alone in
to a chamber / and closed the door to them. Than the bishop showed the earl
the debylyte of the realm of England / and of the desolacyon thereof / and
how justice had no place to reygne for fault of a good king / and how
certain valiant men and prelates / with the londoners and other ingenerall /
had devised a remedy / and for that cause he was sent thither to him / to
desire him to return in to England / and they would make him king / because
yt Richard of Burdeaulx had done and consented to be done so many yuell deeds
that all the people sorowed it / and are ready to rise against him. and therefore
sir now is the time or never / for you to seek for your delyuerau^ce and
profit / and for the wealth of your children. for if ye entende not to help
your self and them also / none other will. for Richard of Bordeaux gives to
them of his chamber and to other daily / part of your enherytau^ce and of your
chyldrens / of the which many valiant men and the londoners were sore
dyspleased therewith / if they could amended it / but they durst never speak
till now. But because the king has yuell used him self against you and
against your uncle the duke of Gloucestre / who was taken by night and conveyed
to Calays and there murdered / and the earl of Arundell beheeded without tytell
of any good reason / and the earl of Warwyke exyled / and you banysshed / and
thus the realm of England is nere dysheryted of all noble men / by whom the
realm should be sustained. And also the king has banysshed the earl of
Northumberlande and the lord Percy his son / because they spoke somewhat
against the kings governance and his counsel. Thus they daily increase in
doing yuell / and none dare speak against it / great part of the realm have
pytie thereof. and therefore they desire you to sleep no longer / but to take
leave of yt french king and return in to England / there shall you be
received with joy. and all this that I have said they will fyrmely uphold /
for they desire to have none other king but you / ye are so well beloved in
the realm.

When the earl had herd the bishops words at length / he was not hasty in
gyuenge of answer / but leaned out at a wyndowe lokynge down in to a
gardeyne / and studied a certain space and had many imagynacions / at last he
turned him to the archebysshop and said. Sir / your words causes me to
study. Loathe I would be to take on me this enterprise / and loathe I would be to
leave it. for I know well that it will be long or I can return in to
England / without it be by the same means / as ye have declared. Loathe I
would be to enclyne to your words / for the French king here and the
frenchmen do to me / and have done / and will do (if I list here to tarry) all
the honor and curtesye that I can desire. And if so be by reasone of your
words and promise of the londoners my good friends / that I should apply and
agree to their wylles and desire / and that thereby king Richard should be
taken and dystroyed / I should in that case bear great blame / whereof I would
be tyght loathe / if any other means might be found. Sir quod the bishop /
I am sent hither to you in hope of all goodness / call to you your counsel
and show them what I have said / and I shall also show them the cause of my
coming / and I think they will not counsel you to the contrary. That shall
I do quod the earl / for such a weyghty matter requires counsel. Than the
earl called to him his counsel such as he trusted best. When they were
before him than the earl caused the bishop to show them all the matter / and
the cause of his coming thither. Than the earl demanded counsel what was
best for him to do. They all answered with one voice / sir / god has taken
pytie of you / how so ever ye do refuse not this bargayne / for ye shall never
have a better. and surely / who so ever will inquire of your lygnage / and fro
whence ye dyscended / ye are of the right stock and generacyon of saint
Edward / sometime king of England. sir thank the londoners your good friends
who will help to deliver you out of danger / and have pytie on your children
/ and of the desolacyon of the realm of England. and sir / remember well what
wro^ges and iniuryes this Richard of Bordeaux has done to you and does
daily. for when the marriage between you and the countess of Ewe was nere at a
point / did not the earl of Salysbury break it? and called you traytoure in
the presence of the french king and other lords / which words are not to
be pardoned / but ye ought to desire how to be revenged. Sir / if ye will not
help yourselfe / who should help you. sir take good advise herin.

How the earl of Derby took leave of the french king / and went to his cosyn
the duke of Bretaygne. Cap. CC.xxxix.
When the earl herd his cou^saylours so ernestly counsel him / his
spyrites opened and said. Syrs / I will do as ye will have me for to have your
counsel was the entente that I sent for you. Sir quod they ye say well / and
sir we counsel you trewly to our power / and as the matter requires. Than as
secretly as they could / they ordained for their departure. Than it was devised
how they might pass the sea / or any knowledge thereof should come in to
England. They devised that of two ways they must take one / outher to go
into Haynalte and in to Holande / and there take the sea at Dordright / or else
to go in to Bretaygne to the duke / and there to take the sea / and so to land
at Plummouth / or where as god would in England. All things consydred / they
said the best way should be by Bretaygne / and than they said to the earl. sir
/ go and take your leave of the french king / and thank him of the curtesy
that he has showed unto you / and take leave of the duke of Orlyance / and of
the kings uncles and other / and thank them all of the good chere they have
made you. and desire of the king to have conducte to go in to Bretaygne /
saying that ye will go se the duke your cosyn / and to tarry there a season
with him. The earl acorded to their counsel / and when he was ready he went
to Paris to the king / as he was acustomed to do / for ever when he came there
was no door closed against him. At this last time he spoke wisely to the king
/ and showed him how he would go and sport him a season in Bretayne / and to
se the duke / whom he called his uncle / for he had had to his wife his
fathers suster / daughter to King Edward. The french king thought nothing
but well / and so gave him lightly leave. Than the earl desired to have
conducte to bring him thither. He granted his desire. So to make short / the
Earl ordained all his business by great wisdom / and took his leave of all
the lords of France / such as were there as than / and he gave great gifts
to the kings officers and to officers of arms / and to mynstrelles / and in
the house of Clysson he made a supper to all such as would come to him. And
the next day he took his horse and departed fro Paris / and issued out at the
gate of saint Jacques / and took ye way to Estampes. A knight of Beawsey did
guide him / called sir Guy of Baygneux. So long they rode that they came to
Blois / and there they tarried an.viii. days / for the earl had sent a knight
and his haraulde in to Bretayne to sygnyfie the duke of his coming / as
reason was.

When duke Johan of Bretaygne knew that his nephewe the earl of Derby was
coming thither / he was thereof right joyful / for he loved always the Duke
of Lancastre and all his brethren / and said to the knight that brought him
word / who was called Gillyam de la Pierre. Sir / why does our nephewe tarry
by the way / that he comes not hither straight? The knight excused the earl as
well as he might. Well quod the duke I saw no man this seven year that I would
be gladder to se / than my nephewe the earl of Derby / return to him and
cause him to come for he shall find my country ready open to receive him. Of
that answer the knight was glad / and returned as shortly as he could /
and came to Bloys / and showed the earl and his counsel the dukes answer.
The next day they rode forth and had paid for every thing / and in the earl
of Derbyes company was sir Peter of Craon / who was banysshed out of the realm
of France / and all his castelles / rentes / and revenues seized for the so^me
of a hundred thousand frankes / judged to the duchess of Aniou queen of
Napoles / by process of the law. Thus the earl of Derby came to Nauntes and
there found the duke / who received him nobly and all his company. Than sir
Guy le Bayneux returned in to France / and the earl tarried with the Duke of
Bretaygne / who made him as good chere as could be devised. And all this
seasone the bishop of Caunterbury was still with the earl and his counsel.
The duke spared nothing upon the earl nor upon his men / but showed them all
the love of the world / and yet the duke knew well the dyspleasure that king
Richard had against the earl / whereof he had pytie. When the earl consydred
the dukes good will and favor / he dyscouered to him part of his business /
as touching the duchy of Lancastre / and such herytages as the duke his
father had in possessyon when he dyed / and desyringe therein to have the dukes
counsel / saying / that he was not repealed again by the king / but gives
daily away part of his enherytaunces / whereby he showed the duke that many
noble men / and prelates in England were not well content with the king /
and the realm thereby in great dyfference / In so much / that diverse noble men
and the londoners / had sent to him to have him to come in to England /
promising that they would make his peace with the king / and set him in his
heritage. When the duke herd that he said. Fair nephue / where as be many
ways the best ought to be chosen. By the king ye are in a hard case / ye
demand counsel / and I will counsel you to give credence to your friends
in England / the londoners are mighty and puyssaunt / they and by the aid of
other prelates / lords / and knights of the realm / shall bring the king
to agree to their desires. and nephewe / I shall aid you with spyppes and with
men of war / to resyste the dangers upon the sea. Of that offer the earl
thanked the duke of Bretayne.

How the earl of Derby aryued in England / and how he was received of the
londoners. Cap. CC.xl.
THus the duke of Bretaygne and the earl of Derby were louyngely concluded
together / and the earl tarried there a certain space and made as though he would
have tarried still there / and in the mean seasone the earl made his prouysyon
at Wannes. And when all thing was ready / the duke and the earl came thither /
and when the wynd served / the earl of Derby and his company took the sea / he
had with him three ships of war to conducte him in to England / and the
further they sailed the better wind they had / so that within two days and
two nyghtes they aryed at Plu^mouth in England / and issued out of their
ships and entered in to the town little and little. the bailey of Plu^mouthe /
who had charge of the town under the king / had great marueyle when he saw
so much people and men of war enter in to the town. But the bishop of
Caunterbury apeased him / and said how they were men of war that would do
no harm in the realm of England / sent thither by the duke of Bretaygne to
serve the king and the realm. Therewith the bailey was content / and the earl
of Derby kept him self so privy in a chaumbre / that none of the town knew
him. Than the bishop of Caunterbury wrote letters sygned with his hand to
London / sygnyfienge the coming of the earl of Derby / and sent them by a
suffycyent man in post / who took fresshe horses by the way / and came to
London the same day at night / and passed over the bridge and so came to the
mayres lodging / who as than was a bed / and as soon as the mayre knew that
a messa^ger was come fro the bishop of Caunterbury / he rose out of his bed
and made the messanger to enter in to his chamber / who delivered him a lettre
fro the bishop of Caunterbury. The mayre read it and reioysed greatly of
those news / and incontinent he sent of his servants fro house to house /
princypally to such as were of counsel of sendynge for the Earl of Derby.
They were all glad of that tidings / and in contynent there assembled
together of the most notablest men of the city to the nombre of two hundred /
and they spoke together / and held no long counsel for the case required it
not / but they said / let us apparel our self and go and receive the duke
of Lancastre / says we agreed to send for him / the archebysshoppe of
Caunterbury has well done his deuoyre / seeing he has brought him in to
England. Than they did chose certain men to go abroad to publysshe the earls
coming to lords knights / and squyers / such as were of their party / and
mo than five hundred of the londoners took their horses / and they had so
great desire to go forth that they were loathe to tarry one for a another. The
earl of Derby tarried not long at Plummouth / but the next day as soon as
their horses were vnshypped / they rode toward London. And all that season
sir Peter of Craon and ye bretons were still with the earl. The mayre of London
and they that had the gouernyng of the city / were the first that met the
earl in the feldes / and humbly received him / and ever as they rode forward
they met more people. The first day they ca^e and lay at Guyldforde / a
five and twenty mile fro London. The next day a great nombre of the men /
women / and children of London and the clergy came to mete with the earl / they
had such desire to se him And when they ca^e in to his sight they cried
welcome noble earl of Derby and duke of Lancastre / God send you joy / welthe
/ and prosperyte. Sith ye went out of England / the realm has been in no
prosperyte. Now we trust ye shall bring us in to a reasonable estate / for
we have lived in great displeasaunce and desolacyon / by the means of Richard
of Bordeaux and his counsel / and specially he ought most chief to be
blamed. For a king that should govern a Realm and people / ought to have
such discrecyon / to know good and yuell asondre / otherwise he is not worthy
to govern a Realm. And this Richard of Bordeaux has done contrary / which
shall be well known and proved upon him. with such words and other the people
brought the earl to London. The mayre rode cheke and cheke by him / which was
great pleasure for the people to se / and the mayre sometime said to the earl.
Sir / behold how the people rejoice of your coming. That is true quod the
earl. And always as he rode he enclyned his heed to the people on every side.
Thus the Earl was brought on his lodging / and every man departed till after
dinner. Than the mayre and the notable men of the cite / and diverse other lords
and knights / prelates / bysshoppes / and abbottes / such as were in London
came to se the the earl. Also the duchess of Gloucestre and her two daughters
came to se therle who were his cosyn germayns. Affren their brother was with
king Richard / more for fear than^e for love. With these ladies was the
countess of Arundell and her children / and also the countess of Warwyke /
with diverse other ladies / such as were at London The people of London were so
joyful of the earls coming / that there was no more workynge in London that
day / than and it had been Easter day.

TO come to a conclusyon of this business. The people took counsel and
advise to ride against the king / whom the Londoners named Richard of Bordeaux
/ king without tytell or honor / for the vyllaynes of London had the king
in such hate / that it was pain for them to here speaking of him / but to his
co^dempnacion and destruction / for they had treated the earl of Derby to be
their king / and he was much ordered by their counsel The earl of Derby took
on him to be king / and so to endure for ever he and his heirs / and thereto
the Londoners did swear and seal. And promised / that all the resydue of the
realm should do the same / so solempnely that there should never questyon be
made thereof after. Also they promised him to aid and to assyste him always.
These promyses and bounds ones taken and concluded / than it was ordained
that.xii. hundred men of London well armed / should ride with the earl toward
Bristowe / and to do so much that Richard of Bordeaux might be taken and
brought to London / and than to take advise what should be done with him / and
to be judged by the law / and by the three estates of the realm. Also it was
ordained (to make the less brute and sclaundre) that the men of war of
Bretaygne / such as were come thither with the earl should be returned home
again. For it was said / how they had men enough to do their deeds
without them / so that the earl had all the bretons before him / and thanked
them of their service that they had done him / and gave them great rewards
so that they were well content / and so returned to Plu^mouthe to the ships
/ and so in to Bretayne.

Now let us speak of the earl of Derby who ordained to ride to Bristowe.

THe earl of Derby was chief of that army / as reason was / for it touched
him most nerest. Thus he departed fro London / and as he rode / the country
fell in to him. Tidings ca^e in to the kings host / of the coming of the
earl of Derby and of the Londoners / many knights / squyers / and other knew
it or the king had knowledge thereof / but they durst not speak thereof. When
the tidings spredde more abroad / such as were next the king were in great
fear. for they knew well the king and they both / were lykely to fall in
paryll / because they had so many enemies in the realm. and such were tha^
their enemies / that had made good face before. For many knights / squyers
/ and other / such as had served the king before / departed fro the court
without any license. Some went home to their own houses / and some took the
next way they could straight to the earl of Derby to serve him. As soon as
Affren of Gloucestre and Richard son^e to the earl of Arundell knew that the
Earl of Derby and the Londoners were coming / they got their men toguyder
and departed / and rode straight to the earl of Derby / whom they found
beyond Oxenforde / at a town called Soucetour. Therle of Derby had great
joy whan^e he saw his cosyns / and demanded of the state of the king / and
how they were departed fro him / They answered and said. Sir / at our
departing we spoke not with him. For as soon as we knew of your coming /
we lepte on our horses and departed to come to serve you / and to aid to
revenge the death of our fathers / whom Richard of Burdeaulx has caused to
be slain. Sirs quod the earl ye be right welcome / ye shall aid me and I
shall help you. For it is behouable that our cosyn Richard of Bordeaux be
brought to London. so have I promised to the Londoners / and I will keep my
promise / for thereto they will aid me. And we have men ynowe to fight with him
if need be. And if he will have battle he shall have it.

How tidings came to king Richard / of the coming of the earl of Derby
with great puyssaunce. Cap. CC.xli.
IT was said to the king / when the matter could no lengar be hid. Sir /
advise you well / ye have need of good Counsel shortly / for the Londoners
and other comes against you with great puissaunce / and has made therle of
Derby your cosyn their chief captain / they have got him out of France.
This has not been done without great treaty. When the king herd that he was
sore abashed / and wyste not what to say / for all his spyrites trymbled. For
tha^ he saw well the matters were lykely to go yuell against him / without he
could get puyssau^ce to resyst them. Than the king said. Sirs make all our
men ready / and lend through out my realm for aid / For I will not fly
before my subiettes. Sir quod they the matter gothe yuell / for your men do
leave you and fly away / ye have lost the one half / and all the rest are
sore abashed / and leseth cou^tynau^ce. Why quod the king / what will ye that
I shall do? Sir leave the field / for ye are not able to keep it. And get you
in to some strong castle till sir Johan Holla^de your brother come / who is
aduertysed of all this matter. And whan^e he is come he shall find some remedy
/ outher biforce of arms or else by treaty / at leest to bring you in to
some better case / than ye be in at this present time. For if ye keep the field
paraduenture some will forsake you and go to him. To this counsel the king
agreed. At that time the earl of Salisbury was not with ye king he was in his
country. When he herd how the earl of Derby with the Londoners and great
puissaunce rode against the king. He ymagined that the matter was in paryll for
him and for the king / and for such as the king had been counsayled by: so he
sat still to here other tidings. Also the duke of york was not with the king
/ but his son the earl of Rutlande was always with ye king for two causes.
The one was / king Richard loved him entierly. And another was / because he
was constable of England / therefore by right he ought to be with the king.
When the king had supped / new tidings ca^e again to him / saying. Sir / it
is time to take advise how ye will order your self your puyssau^ce is not
sufficient against the^ that comes against you: It can not aueyle you to make
battle against them: It behooves you to pass this danger / by sad advise
and good counsel. And by wisdom apease them that be your yuel willers / as
ye have done or this time / and than correct them after at leysar. There is a
castle a.xii. mile hens called the castle of Flynte / which is strong. We
counsel you to go thider and close you within it / till ye here other news
fro the earl of Huntyngton your brother / and for other of your friends / and
send in to Irelande for socours. And ye french king your father in law when
he knows of your need / he will conforte you. the king followed that counsel
/ and appointed them that should ride with him to the castle of Flynt. And he
ordained his cosyn earl of Rutlande to tarry still at Bristowe / and that they
should be ready to set forward when he sent to them / and that he was of
power to fight with his enemies. The next day the king with such as were of
his household rode to the castle of Flynte / and entered in to the castle
without making any semblaunt to make any war / but to abide there and to
defend the castle if they were assailed.

How king Richard yielded him self to the earl of Derby to go to London. Cap.
CC.xli.
THe earl of Derby and the londoners had their spies going and coming / who
reported to them al ye state of the king. And also the earl knew it by such
knights and squyers as daily came fro the kings part to therle / who had
sure knowledge that the king was gone to the castle of Flynt / and had no
company with him / but such as were of his own household / and seemed that he
would no warr^ but to escape that danger by treaty. Than therle determined to
ride thither / and to do so much to have ye king outher biforce or by treaty.
Than the earl and all his company rode thither / and within two mile of the
Castle they found a great vyllage / there the earl tarried and drank / and
determined in him self to ride to the castle of Flynt with two hundred horse
/ and to leave the rest of his company still there. And he said he would do
what he could by fair treaty / to enter in to the castle by love and not
perforce. And to bring out the king with fair words / and to assure him fro
all paryll / except going to London / and to promise him that he shall have
no hurt of his body / and to be mean for him to the Londoners / who were not
content with him. Therles deuyse seemed good to them that hard it / and they
said to him. Sir / beware of dissymulacion. This Richard of Bordeaux must be
taken outher quycke or deed / and all the other traitors that be about him /
and of his counsel / and so to be brought to London and set in the tower /
the Londoners will not suffer you to do the contrary: Than the earl said. Sirs
fear not / but all that is enterprised shall be accomplysshed. But if I can
get him out of the castle with fair words I will do it and if I can not
I shall send you word thereof / and than ye shall come and lay siege about
the castle. And than we will do so much by force or by assaute / that we will
have him quick or deed / for the castle is well prignable: to those words
accorded well ye londoners. So the earl departed fro the army and rode with two
hundred men to the castle / where as the king was among his men right sore
abashed. The earl came ridyng to the castle gate / which was fast closed /
as the case required. The earl knocked at the gate The porters demanded who
was there. the earl answered / I am Henry of Lancastre. I come to the king to
demand mine heritage of the duchy of Lancastre / show the king this fro me.
Sir quod they within / we shall do it. Incontinent they went in to the hall and
in to the ^ongyon / where as the king was / and such knights about him / as
had long time cou^sayled him. than these news were showed to the king and
said. sir / your cosyn of Derby is at ye gate / who dema^deth of you to be set
in possessyon of ye duchy of Lancastre his enherytaunce. The king than
regarded such as were about him / and demanded what was best to do. They
said sir / in this request is none yuell / ye may let him come in to you
with.xii. persons in his company / and here what he will say. He is your cosyn
and a great lord of the Realm: He may well make your peace and he will / for
he is greatly beloved in the realm / and specially with the Londoners / who
sent for him in to France. They be as now ye chief that be against you. Sir
/ ye must dissymule till the matter be apeased / and till the earl of Huntyngton
your brother be with you. And it comes now yuell to pass for you / that he
is at Calais. For there be many now in England that be risen against you /
that and they knew that your brother were about you / they would sytte still
and durst not displease you / and yet he has to his wife the earl of Derbyes
suster: by his means we suppose ye should come to peace and co^corde The king
agreed to those words and said. Go and let him come in with.xii. with him and
no mo. Two knights went down to the gate / and opyned the wycket and issued
out and made reverence to the earl / and received him with gracious words /
for they knew well that they had no force to resyst them / and also they
knew well the Londoners were sore displeased with the^ / therefore they spoke
fair / and said to the earl. Sir / what is your pleasure / the king is at
mass / he has sent us hyder to speak with you? I say quod therle / ye know
well I ought to have possessyon of the ouchy of Lancastre / I am come in party
for that cause / and also for other things that I would speak with the king
of. Sir quod they ye be welcome / the king would be glad to se you and to
here you / and has commanded that ye come to him all only with.xii.
persons. The earl answered / it pleases me well. So he entered in to the
castle with.xii. persons / and than the gate closed again and the rest of
his company tarried without.

Now consider what danger therle of Derby was in / for the king than might
have slain him / and such as were with him / as easily as a bird in a cage.
But he feared not the matter / but boldelye went to the king / who changed
colors when he saw the earl. Than the earl spoke aloude without making of
any great honor or reverence / and said. Sir / are ye fasting? The king
answered and said yea / why ask you. It is time quod the earl that ye had
dyned / for ye have a great journey to ride. Why / wheder should I ride quod
the king? ye must ride to London quod therle wherefore I counsel you eat and
drink / that ye may ride with the more myrthe. Than the king who was sore
troubled in his mind / and in a manner afraid of those words said. I am not
hungry / I have no lust to eat. Than such as wereby / who were as than
glad to flatter therle of Derby / for they saw well the matter was like to go
dyuersly / said to the king. Sir / believe your cosyn of Lancastre for he will
nothing but good. Than the king said well / I am content cover the tables.
Thanne the king washed and satte down / and was served. Than the earl was
demanded if he would sytte down / he said no / for he was not fasting.

IN the mean season while the king satte at dinner / who did eat but little /
his heart was so full that he had no lust to eat. All the country about the
castle was full of men of war. They within the castle might se them out at
the wyndowes / and the king when he rose fro the table might se them him
self. Than he demanded of his cosyn what men they were / that appeared so many
in the feldes. Therle answered and said / the most part of the^ be
Londoners. What would they have quod the king? They will have you quod therle /
and bring you to London and put you in to the tower / there is none other
remedy / ye can escape none otherwise. No quod ye king and he was sore afraid
of those words / for he knew well the Lo^doners loved him not and said.
Cosyn / can you not provide for my surety: I will not gladly put me in to
their hands. For I know well they hate me and have done long / though I be
their king. Than therle said. Sir / I se none other remedy but to yield your
self as my prisoner: and when they know that ye be my prisoner they will do
you no hurt / but ye must so ordain you and your company to ride to London
with me / and to be as my prisoner in the tower of London. The king who saw
him self in a hard case / all his spyrites were sore abashed / as he that
douted greatly that the londoners would slay him. Than he yielded him self
prisoner to the earl of Derby and bound him self / and promised to do all
that he would have him to do. In likewise all other knights / lquyers / and
officers yielded to the earl / to eschew the danger and paryll that they were
in / and the earl than received them as his prisoners / and ordained
incontinent horses to be sadylled and brought forth in to the court and the
gates opyned / than many men of arms and archers entered. Than the earl of
Derby caused a cry to be made / on pain of death / no man to be so hardy to
take away any thing within ye castle / nor to lay any hands upon any person
/ for all were under the earls sauegarde and protection: which cry was kept
no man durst break it. the earl had the king down in to the court talkyng
toguyder / and caused all the kings hole household and estate to go forward /
as of custom they had done before / without chau^gyng or mynisshynge of any
thing. While every thing was a preparyng / the king and the earl co^muned
toguyder in the court / and were well regarded by the Londoners. And as it was
entormed me / king Richard had a grayhounde called Mathe / who always waited
upon the king / and would know no man else. For when soever the king did ride
/ he that kept the grayhounde did let him lose / and he would straight rynne
to the king and fawn upon him / and leap with his tore fete upon the kings
shulders. And as the king and the earl of Derby talked together in the court /
the grayhounde who was wont to lepe upon the king / left the king and came to
the earl of Derby duke of Lancastre and made to him the same friendly
cou^tinau^ce and chere / as he was wont to do to the king The duke who knew
not the grayhou^de demanded of the king what the grayhounde would do. Cosyn
quod the king / it is a great good token to you / and an yuell sign to me. Sir
/ how know you that quod the duke? I know it well quod the king. The
grayhounde makes you chere this day as king of England / as ye shall be / and
I shall be deposed: the grayhou^de has this knowledge naturally / therefore take
him to you / he will follow you and forsake me. The duke understood well those
words and cherisshed the grayhounde / who would never after follow king
Richard / but followed the duke of Lancaster.

SO every man lepte a horsbacke and departed fro the castle of Flynt / and
entered in to the feldes. Thus duke Henry of Lancastre / who was no more called
earl of Derby but duke of Lancaster / rode by the king and oftentimes talked
togider / and men of war before and behind in great nombre / and all such
as were of the kings court / rode toguyder in a company. That night they lay
about Oxenforde. The duke of Lancastre led king Richard by no castelles nor
good towns / for fear of styring of the people / but always kept the
feldes. Than the duke gave license to a great nombre of his people to depart
and said. Sirs ye may depart for we have that we desire. the king can not
fly nor escape fro us / we and our own company shall bring him to London / and
put him in sauegarde in ye tower he and all his are my prisoners / I may
bring them whider I will. Therefore sirs / go your ways home till ye here
other news. They did as the duke commanded the^ / who took the way to
Wyndsore / and came thither / and most part of the Lo^doners returned to
London / and other to their own places. the duke of Lancaster deperted fro
wynsore / and would not ride by Colbroke / but took the way by Shene / and so
ca^e to dinner to Chersay. ye king had desired the duke that he should not
bring him London way / nor through the city and therefore they took that
way. As soon as they had the king thus in their hands / they sent notable
persons to the young queen / who was at Ledes in Kent. And they ca^e to the
lady Coucy / who was second person there next to the queen / and said to her.
Madame / make you ready for ye must deperte hens and at your departing make no
semblant of displeasure before the queen / but say how your husband has
sent for you / and for your daughter also. This that we say / look that you do
accomplysshe on pain of your life / nor axe ye no questyons no further. And ye
shall be conveyed to Dover / and there have a ship that shall bring you to
Boloyne. the lady who douted those words / for she knew well Englysshemen
were cruel and hasty / said. sirs / as god will I am ready to do as ye will
have me. Anon she made her ready and horses were provided for her and for her
company. So all French men and women departed / and they were conveyed to
Dover / and at the next tide they took shippyng and had good wind / and so
arrived at Boloyne.

Of the state of queen Isabell of england / and how she had all new persons
appointed to wait upon her and how king Richard was set in the tower of
London. Capi. CC.xlii.
AS for the state of the queen was so turned and broken / for there was left
nouther man / womon / nor child of ye nation of France / nor yet of England /
such as were in any favor with the king / Her. house was newly furnisshed
with ladies and damoselles / and other officers and servants. They were
charged all / that in no wise they should not speak of the king / not one to
another. Thus the duke of Lancaster departed fro Cherisay and rode to Shene /
and fro thens in the night time they conveyed the king to the tower of London /
and such other knights and squyers as the king would. The next morning when
the Londoners knew that the king was in the tower / they were greatly reioysed
but there was great murmuring among the^ because the king was conveyed thither
so secretly. They were angry that the duke had not brought him through London
openly / not to have done him honor / but shame / they hated him so sore.
Behold the opinyon of common people / wha^ they be up against their prince or
lord / and specially in England. among them there is no remedy / for they
are the peryloust people of the world / and most outragyoust if they be up /
and specially the Londoners / and in deed they be rich and of a great nombre.
There was well in London a.xxiiii. thousa^de men in harness complete / and
a.xxx. thousand archers / and they were hardy and high of courage / the more
blood they saw shed / the less they were abashed.

Now let us somewhat speak of the earl of Rutlande constable of England /
son to the duke of york / who was tarried at Bristowe and the lord Spe^ser
with him / who had his suster to wife. When they knew yt the castle of Flynte
was given up / and the king taken and brought to London / than^e they thought
surely / the matters went not well for the king. Therefore they thought no
lengar to tarry there / and gave leave to al their men of war to depart / and
the earl of Rutlande and the lord Spenser rode toguyder with their own
servants to Hull in the marchesse of Wales / a fair manner of the lord
Spensers / and there they tarried till they herd other tidings. And the duke
of york lay still in his castle / and meddled with nothing of the business
of England / no more he did before / he took ever the time aworthe as it
came. howbeit he was sore displeased in his mind / to se such difference
within ye realm / and between his nephues and blood. Now let us return to
speak of king Richard.

When the duke of Lancastre had set his cosyn king Richard in ye tower of
London / and certain of his cou^saylours / and had set sure keeping on the^.
The first thing than that the duke / he sent for the earl of Warwyke / who was
banysshed and commanded to lie in the ysle of Wight / and discharged him clean
thereof. and secondly the duke of Lancastre sent to therle of Northumberlande
and to the lord Percy his son / that they should come to him / and so they
did. After he enquered and sought out to have the four companyons that had
strangled his uncle the duke of Gloucestre in the castle of Calais. They were
so well sought out / that they were all taken: They were set in prisone
aparte in London. than the duke of Lancastre and his counsel took advise what
should be done with king Richard being in the tower of London / where as king
Johan of France was kept / while king Edward went in to the Realm of
France. Than it was thought that king Richard should be put fro all his
royalte and joy that he has lived in / for they said / the news of his
taking should sprede abroad in to all realms crystened. He had been
king.xxii. year / and as than they determined to keep him in prisone. Than
they regarded what case the realm stood in / and did put all his deeds in
artycles to the nombre of.xxviii. Than the duke of Lancastre and his counsel
went to the tower of London / and entered in to the chamber where king Richard
was / and without any reverence making to him / there was openly read all the
said artycles / to the which the king made none answer / for he saw well
all was true yt was laid to his charge / saving he said / all that I have
done passed by my counsel. Than he was demanded what they were that had
given counsel / and by whom he was most ruled / he named them in trust
thereby to have been delivered himself in accusynge of them / as he had done
before time / trusting thereby to escape / and to bring them in the danger and
pain / but that was not the mind of them that loved him not. so as at that
time they spoke no more but departed / and the duke of Lancastre went to his
lodging / and suffered the mayre and the men of law to proceed. They went to
ye Guyldhall / where as all the matters of the city were determined / and than
much people assembled there. When they saw the governors of the city go
thither / they thought some justice should be done / as there was in deed. I
shall show you how. First the artycles that were made against the king /
the which had been read before him in the tower / were read again there
openly. And it was showed by him that read them / how the king himself
denied none of them / but confessed that he did them by the counsel of four
knights of his chamber / and how by their counsel he had put to death the
duke of Gloucestre and the earl of Aru^dell / sir Thomas Corbet / and other /
and how they had long encyted the king to do those deeds / which deeds they
said were not to be forgyuen / but demanded punycion / for by them and their
counsel the justice of right was closed up through all the courts of
England / Westmynster / and other / whereby many yuell deeds followed / and
companyes and rowtes of thieves and murderers rose and assembled together in
diverse parties of the realm / and robbed merchants by the ways and poor
men in their houses / by which means the realm was in great parell to have been lost / without recovery. and it is to be ymagyned that finally the would
have rendered Calais or Guysnes / or both in to the frenchmennes hands. These
words thus showed to the people made many to be abashed / and many began to
murmr and said. These causes demand punycion / that all other may take
ensample thereby / and Richard of Burdeaur to be deposed / for he is not worthy
to bear a crown / but ought to be deprived fro all honor / and to be kept
all his life in prison with breed and water. Though some of the villaynes
murmured / other said on high. sir mayre of London / and ye other that have
justice in your hands to mynyster / execute justice / for we will ye spare no
man / for ye se well the case that ye have showed us demau^deth justice in
co^tynent / for they are judges upon their own deeds. Than the mayre and other
of the governors of the law went together in to the chamber of judgment.
than these four knights were judged to dye / and were judged to be had to the
foot of the tower where as king Richard was / that he might se them drawn
alonge by the dyke with horses each after other / through the city in to
chepesyde / and than there heedes stryken of there / and set upon London
bridge / and there bodies drawn to the gybet and there hanged.

THis judgment given they were delivered to execucyon / for the mayre of
London and such as were deputed to the matter / went fro the Guyldhall to the
tower / and took out the four knights of the kings / whose names were called
sir Bernarde Brokas / sir Marelays / master John^ Derby receyuour of Lyncolne
/ and master Stell the kings steward. Each of the^ were tied to two horses /
in the presence of them that were in the tower / and the king might well se it
out at the wyndowes / wherewith he was sore descomforted / for all other that
were there with the king looked to be in the same case / they knew them of
London so cruel. Thus these four knights were drawn one after another a
long through the cite till they came in to chepe / and there on a fysshers
stall their heedes were stryken of and set upon London bridge / and their
bodies drawn by the shulders to the gybet / and there hanged up. This justice
thus done / every man went to their lodgings. King Richard knowing him
self taken / and in the danger of the londoners was in great sorrow in his
heart / and rekened his puyssaunce nothing / for he saw how every man was
against him. and if there were any that ought him any favor / it lay not
than in their powers to do him any aid / nor they durst not show it. Such
as were with the king said. Sir / we have but small trust in our lives as it
may well apere / for when your cosyn of Lancastre came to the castle of Flynte
/ and with your own good will ye yielded you to him / and he promised that you
and twelve of yours should be his prisoners and have no hurt / and now of
those twelve four be executed shamfully / we are like to pass the same way.
The cause is / these londoners / who has caused the duke of Lancastre your
cosyn to do this deed / had him so sore bound to them that he must do as they
will have him. God does much for us / if he suffer that we might dye here our
natural death / and not a shamfull death. It is great pytie to think on this.
With those words king Richard began te^derly to weep and wringe his hands /
and cursed the hour that ever he was borne / rather than to have such an
end. Such as were about him had great pytie and recomforted him as well as
they might. One of his knights said. Sir / it behooves you to take comfort /
we se well and so do you that this world is nothing / the fortunes there of are
marvelous / and sometime turn as well upon kings and princes / as upon poor
men. The french king whose daughter ye have married / can not now aid you
/ he is to far of. if ye might escape this myschefe by dyssimulacyon and save
your life and ours / it were a good enterprise / peradventure with in a year or
two / there would be had some recovery. Why quod the king / what would ye that
I should do / there is nothing but I would be glad to do it / to save us
thereby? Sir quod the knight / we se for truth that these londoners will
crown your cosyn of Lancastre as king / and for that intent they sent for him
/ and so have aided him and do / it is not possible for you to live without ye
consent that he be crowned king / wherefore sir / we will counsel you (to the
intent to save your life and ours) that when your cosyn of Lancastre comes to
you to demand any thing / than with sweet and treatable words say to him /
how that ye will resygne to him the crown of England / and all the right
that ye have in the realm / clearly and purely in to his hands / and how
that ye will that he be king / thereby ye shall greatly apease him and the
londoners also / and desire him effectuously to suffer you to live and us also
with you / or else every man a part / as it shall please him / or else to
banisshe us out of the realm for ever / for he that leseth his life leseth
all. King Richard herd those words well / and fyxed them surely in his
heart / and said he would do as they counsayled him / as he that saw him self
in great danger. and than he said to them that kept him / how he would
gladly speak with his cosyn of Lancastre.

How King Richard of England resigned the crown and the realm in to the
hands of the earl of Derby duke of Lancastre. Cap. CC.xliiii.
IT was showed the duke of Lancastre how Richard of Bordeaux desired to speak
with him. The duke in an evening took a barge and went to the tower by water /
and went to the king / who received him curtesly / and humbled him self
greatly / as he that saw him self in great danger / and said. Cosyn of
Lancastre / I regard and consydre mine estate / which is as now but small /
I thank god thereof. As any more to reygne or to govern people / or to bear a
crown / I think it not / and as god help me I would I were deed by a
natural death / and that the french king had again his daughter / we have
had as yet no great joy together / nor sith I brought her in to England / I
could never have the love of my people as I had before. Cosyn all things
co^sydred / I know we well I have greatly trespassed against you / and against
other noble men of my blodde / by diverse things / I perceive I shall never
have pardone nor come to peace / wherefore with mine own free and lyberall will
/ I will resygne to you the heritage of the Crown of England / and I require
you take the gift thereof with the resignacyon. When the duke herd that he
said. sir it is conuenyent that part of the three estates of the realm be
called to these words / and I have sent all ready for some noble men / prelates
/ and counsaylours of the good towns of England / and I trust they will be
here within this three days suffycient of them / for you to make a dew
resygnacion before them / and by this means ye shall greatly apease many men
within the realm. For to withstand such enormyties and yuels as have been
used in the realm for fault of justice / who had no place to reygne / I was
sent for fro beyond the sea / and the people would crown me / for the renome
rynneth through England / that I have more right to the crown than ye have /
for when our grauntfather king Edward the third did chose and make you king
/ the same was as than showed him / but he loved so his son the prince / that
none could break his purpose nor opinyon / but that you should be king / and
if ye would have followed the steps of your father the prince / and have
believed his counsel / as a good son ought to have done / ye might have been
still king / and have continued your estate / but ye have always done the
contrary / so that the common renome rynneth through England and in other
places / that ye were never son to the prince of Wales / but rather son to
a priest or to a chanon / for I have herd of certain knights that were in
the Princes house mine uncle / how that he knew well that his wife had not
truly kept her marriage. your mother was cosyn germayne to king Edward / and
the king began to hate her / because she could have no generation. Also she
was the kings gossyp of two children at the font. And she that could well
keep the prince in her bandon by craft and subtylte / she made the prince to
be her husband / and because she could have no child / she douted that the
prince should be deuorsed fro her. she did so much that she was with child
with you / and with another before you / as of the first I can not tell what to
judge / but as for you because your co^dicyons have been seen contrary fro all
nobles and prowes of the prince / therefore it is said that ye be rather son
to a pressed or to a chanon. for when ye were gotten and borne at Bordeaux /
there were many young priests in ye princes house. This is the brute in this
country / and your works have well followed the same / for ye be always
enclyned to the pleasure of the french men / and to take with them peace to the
confusyon and die shonoure of the realm of England. And because mine uncle of
Gloucestre and the earl of Arundell did counsel you truly and faithfully / to
keep the honor of the realm / and to follow the steps of your ancestors /
ye have traytoursly caused them to dye. As for me I have taken on me to defend
your life as long as I may for pytie / and I shall pray the londoners and the
herytours of them that ye have slain and banysshed / to do the same. Cosyn I
thank you quod yt king. I trust more in you than in any other. It is but
right that ye so should do / for if I had not ben / ye had been taken by the
people and deposed with great confusyon and slain / by reasone of your yuell
works. King Richard herd well all the dukes words / and wist not what to
say against it / for he saw well that force nor arguments could not auelyle
him / but rather meekness and humilyte / wherefore he humbled him / and prayed
the duke to save his life.

When the duke of Lancastre had been at the tower two hours with king Richard
/ and had showed him part of his fautes / than he returned. And the next day
he sent forth mo commandments in to all parties of the realm / to cause
noble men and other to come to London. His uncle the duke of york came to
London and the earl of Rutlande his son / the earl of Northumberlande and the
lord Thomas Percy his brother. The duke of Lancastre made them good chere.
Thither came also great nombre of prelates and abbottes. And on a day the duke
of Lancastre acompanyed with lords / dukes / prelates / earls / barons / and
knights / and of the notablest men of London and of other good towns / rode
to the Tower and there alyghted. Than king Richard was brought in to the hall
/ aparelled like a king in his robes of estate / his septer in his hand / and
his crown on his heed. Than he stood up alone / not holden nor stayed by no
man / and said a loud. I have been king of England / duke of Acquytany /
and lord of Irelande about xxii. years / which sygnory / royalte / cepter /
crown / and heritage / I clearly resygne here to my cosyn Henry of Lancastre /
and I desire him here in this open presence in entering of the same possessyon
/ to take this septour / and so delivered it to the duke / who took it. Than
king Richard took the crown fro his heed with both his hands / and set it
before him / and said. Fair cosyn Henry duke of Lancastre / I give and deliver
you this crown / wherewith I was crowned king of England / and therewith / all
the right thereto dependyng. The duke of Lancastre took it / and the
archebysshop of Caunterbury took it out of the dukes hands. this resygnacion
thus done the duke of Lancastre called a notary / and demanded to have letters
and witness of all the prelates and lords there being present. Than Richard
of Bordeaux returned again in to the chamber fro whence he came. Than the
duke of Lancastre and all other lept on their horses / and the crown and
ceptour were put in a cofer / and conveyed to the abbey of Westmynster / and
there kept in the treasory. And every man went to their lodgings / and abode
till the day of parliament and counsel should be at the palace of Westmynster.

Of the coronacyon of king Henry duke of Lancastre / by the consent of the
realm / and the manner of the feast. Cap. CC.xlv.
IN the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred fourscore and nynetene /
the last day of septembre / on a tuysday began a parlyament at Westmynster /
holden by Henry duke of Lancastre / at which time there was assembled prelates
and clergy of the realm of England a great nombre / and also dukes / earls /
and barons / and of every town a certain. Thus the people assembled at
Westmynster / there being present the duke of Lancastre: and there the same
duke challenged the realm of England / and desired to be king by three
reasones. First by conquest. secondly because he was heir. And thyrdly because
Richard of Burdeaur had resygned the Realm in to his hands by his free will
/ in the presence of certain dukes / earls / prelates / and barons in the
hall within the tower of London. These three causes showed / the duke of
Lancastre required all the people there present / as well one as other / to
show their minds and ententes in that behalf. Than all the people with one
voice said / that their wylles was to have him king / and how they would have
none other but him. Than the duke again said to the people. Sirs / is this
your minds. and they all with one voice said / ye / ye. And than the duke
sat down in the syege royal / which seat was raised up in the hall / and
covered with a clothe of estate / so yt every man might well se him sytte. And
than the people lyfted up their hands a high / promysing him their faith and
allegyaunce. Thanne the parlyament concluded / and the day was taken for his
coronacyon of saint Edwardes day / the monday the.xiii. day of Octobre / at
which time / the saturday before his coronacyon he departed fro Westmynster
and rode to the tower of London with a great nombre. and that night all such
squyers as should be made knights the next day / watched / who were to the
nombre of.xlvi. Every squier had his own bayne by him self / and the next day
the duke of Lancastre made them all knights at the mass time. Than had they
long cotes with strayte sleues furred with mynyuer like prelates / with white
laces hanging on their shuldes. And after dinner the duke departed fro the
tower to Westmynster / and rode all the way bareheeded / and about his neck
the lyuery of France. He was acompanyed with ye prince his son and six
dukes / six earls / and.xviii. barons / and in all knights and squyers a nine
hundred horse. Than the king had on a short cote of clothe of gold / after
the manner of Almayne / and he was mounted on a white cou^ser / and the garter
on his left leg. Thus the duke rode through London with a great nombre of
lords / every lords servant in their masters lyuery. All the but gesses and
lombardes merchants in London / and every craft with their lyuerey and
deuyse. Thus he was conveyed to Westmynster. He was in nombre a six thousa^de
horse / and the streates hanged as he passed by. and the same day and the next
there were in London rynnynge seven cundyttes with wine white and reed. That
night the duke was bayned / and the next morning he was confessed / and herd
three masses as he was acustomed to do / and than all the prelates and clergy
came fro Westmynster church to the palace to fetch the king with procession
and so he went to the church a procession / and all the lords with him in
their robes of scarlet / furred with menyuer / barred of their shulders
acordynge to their degrees / and over the king was borne a clothe of estate of
blewe / with four belles of gold / and it was borne by four burgesses of the
ports / as Dover and other. And on every side of him he had a sword borne /
the one ye sword of the church / and the other the sword of justice. The
sword of the church his son the prince did bear / and the sword of justice
therle of Northumberlande did bear / for he was as than constable of England
/ for the earl of Rutlande was deposed fro that office / and the earl of
Westmerlande who was marshall of England / bare the ceptour. Thus they entered
in to ye church about nine of the clock / and in the mids of the church
there was an high scaffolde all covered with reed / and in the mids thereof
there was a chair Royal / covered with clothe of gold. Than the king sat
down in yt chair and so sat in estate royal / saving he had not on the
crown / but sat bare heeded. Than at four corners of the scaff old / the
archebysshop of Caunterbury showed unto the people how god had sent them a man
to be their king / and demanded if they were content that he should be
consecrated and crowned as their king. And they all with one voice said yea /
and held up their hands / promising him faith and obeysaunce. Than the
king rose and went down the scaffolde to the high auter to be sacred / at
which consecracyon there were two archbysshoppes and ten bishops / and before
the altar the^ he was dispoyled out of all his vestures of estate / and there
he was anointed in vi. places / on the heed / on the breast and on the two
shulders behind / and on the hands. Than a bonet was ser on his heed / and
while he was anoyntynge the clergy sange the latyny / and such service as they
sing at the halowing of the font. Than yt king was aparelled like a prelate
of the church* with a cope of reed sylke and a pair of spurs with a point
without a rowell. Than the sword of justice was drawn out of the shethe and
hallowed / and than it was taken to ye king / who did put it again in to the
sheth / than the archebysshop of Caunterbury did gyrde ye sword about him.
than saint Edwardes crown was brought forth which is close above and blessed
/ and than the archebysshop did set it on the kings heed. After mass the
king departed out of the church in the same estate and went to his palace /
and there was a fountain that ran by diverse branches white wine and reed.
Than the king entered in to the hall / and so in to a privy chamber / and after
came out again to dinner. At the first table sat the king. At the second ye
five peers of the realm / at the third the valaunt men of London. at the
fourth the new made knights. At the fyft the knights and squiers of honor.
And by the king stood the prince holding the sword of the church / and on
the other side the Constable with the sword of justice / and a little above
the marshall with the ceptour / and at yt kings board sat two archbysshops
and.xvii. bysshoppes. And in the mids of the dinner there came in a knight /
who was called Dinereth all armed upon a good horse rychely aparelled / and had
a knight before him bearyng his spear / and his sword by his side and his
dagger. The knight took the king a lybell / the which was red. Therein was
contained that there were outher knight / squire / or any other ge^tylman that
would say that king Henry was not right full king / he was there ready to fight
with him in that quarrel / before the king / or where as it should please him
to apoynte. that byll was cried by an haraulde in six places of the hall and
in the town. There was none that would challenge him. When the king had dyned
he took wine and spyces in the hall / and than went in to his chamber. Than
every man departed and went to their lodginges. thus the day passed of king
Henryes coronacyon with great joy and feast / which endured all the next day.
The earl of Salysbury was not at this sole^pnyte for he was in sure prison /
and the kings counsel and diverse other noble men / and the londoners / would
that his heed should have been stryken of openly in chepe / for said he had well
deserved it / for bearing of letters and crede^ce fro Richard of Bordeaux to
the french king / and there to report openly that king Henry was a false
traytoure / which fault they said ought not to be perdoned. King Henry was
more gentle than so / for he had some pytie on him / for therle excused him
and said / that he did / was by the kings commandment / and by the setting
on of the four knights that were beheeded. King Henry believed well the earls
words / but his counsel would not believe it / but said / and so did ye
londoners that he should dye / because he had deserved death. Thus the earl of
Salysbury was in prison in great danger of his life. And sir Johan Holande
earl of Huntyngdon capytayne of Calais / was well enfourmed of the hole matter /
and how his brother king Rychard was taken and in prisone in the tower of
London / and had resygned his crown and all / and how Henry of Lancastre was
king of England. This earl of Huntyngdon / what so ever dyspleasure he had
for the trouble of his brother / yet wisely he consydred the time and
adventures / and saw well yt he was not able to with stand all the power and
puyssaunce of the realm. Also the countess his wife / who was cosyn germayne
to king Henry / said. Sir / it must behoue you to pass your displeasure
pacyently and wisely / and do not that thing whereby ye shall have do^mage /
for the king may do you much good / and ye se that all the realm enclyneth to
him / if ye show any dyspleasure to him ward / ye are but lost. wherefore sir
/ I require you and I counsel you to dyssimule the matter / for as well king
Henry now is your brother as king Richard was / therefore sir stycke and lean
to him / and ye shall find him your good lover / for there was never a rycher
king in England than he is / he may do to you and to your children great
good. The earl herd well the words of his wife and believed her and enclyned
him to king Henry / and offered him humble obeysaunce / and promised him faith
and truth. The king received him and had great joy thereof / and he did so
much with means of his fre^des / that therle of Salysbury was taken to grace
/ and his excusacyons accepted / and was clean pardoned.

How news of the taking of king Richard was known in France by the coming
thither of the lady of Coucy / and how the french king was dyspleased. Cap.
CC.xlvi.
When the lady of Coucy was aryued at Bouloyne / she hasted her to go to Paris.
Great murmuring there was in France of the sudden incidentes yt were fall in
England / they knew somewhat by merchants of Bruges / but when the lady of
Coucy aryued / than the troth was known. She went first to her husbands
house / as it was reason. Anon the french king herd word how the lady of
Coucy was come to Paris / Than the king sent for the lord of Coucy / who had been all night with his wife. When he was come the king demanded of the state
of king Richard of England / and of the queen his daughter. The lord durst
not hyde the troth fro him / but showed him plainly every thing / as his
wife had showed him / which news were sore dyspleasaunt to the french king
/ for he knew well the englysshmen were sore and hard men to apease / and so
with dyspleasure the french king returned again in to his old sickness of
fransey / whereof the nobles of yt realm were sore displeased but they could
not amend it. Than the duke of Burgoyn said / I thought never otherwise for it
was a marriage without good reasone / the which I said plainly enough when the
matter was first spoken of / but as than I could not be herd / for I knew
well ye londoners never loved parfytely king Richard. All this myschefe is
engendered by the duke of Gloucestre / it is time now to take heed what the
englisshmen will do / sithe they have taken their king and put him in prison.
by all lykelyhode they will put him to death / for they never loved him /
because be loved no war but peace they will crown to their king the duke of
Lancastre / he shall so bind him self to them that whether he will or not /
he shall do all that they will / and said moreover / now shall be seen what
they of Bordeaux will do / for there he was borne / and was well be loved with
them and also with them of Bayon and of Dax / and in all the lymytes of
Burdeloys / it were good that yt constable of France sir Loys of Sanxere were
signyfyed of this matter / and that he drew him to yt fronters there / and with
him sir Raynolde of Barroys of Barreys and other barons and prelates and to
treat with them and my brother the duke of Berrey to go in to Poictou / and to
draw to the fronters of Xaintes / of Blaues / and of mirebell / whereby if they
of Bordeaux will any thing entende to our treaties / that they may be received
/ for now shall we have them or never. As he devised it was ordained / the
which was a substanciall deuyce. for when they of Bordeaux / of Bayon / and of
Dax / understood that their king Richard was taken and set in the tower of
London / and duke Henry of Lancastre crowned king / they had great marueyle
thereof / and in the beginning would not believe it / but little and little they
knew the troth thereof. Than the said three towns were closed and no man
suffered to issue out nor to enter in / they were sore troubled and sorrowful /
and specially the city of Bordeaux / for king Richard was norysshed among
them / therefore they loved him / and while he was king if any of Burdeloys
came to him they were well received / and always ye king was ready to fulfill
their desires / wherefore they said when they knew the troth. Ah Richard
gentle king / ye were as noble a man as ever reigned in any realm / this
trouble yt londoners have caused / for they could never love you / special
sithe ye were alyed by marriage with the french king / this myschiefe is so
great that we can not suffer it? They have holden you king this.xxii. year /
and now to condempe you to the death / for sithe ye be in prison and have
crowned the duke of Lancastre / they will surely put you to death. So they of
Burdeloys made great lamentacyons / in so much that the seneschall of Bordeaux
a right valiant knight of England wrote letters / therein containing the
words and lamentacyons of them of the city of Burdeaulx / of Bayon / and of
Dax. Also he wrote how they were nere at the point to yield up their towns
to the french king. He sent this lettre by a trusty servant of his by the sea
/ who had good wind and aryued at Cornewayle in England / and than he rode so
long that he came to London / there he found king Henry and delivered his
letters / which were dyrected to the king and to the londoners. They were
opened and reed / and the king and the londoners took counsel upon that
matter. They of London answered like them that were nothing abashed of that
tidings / but said / as for these towns will never turn french / for they
can not live in their danger nor they can not suffer the extorcion and
pollinge of the frenchmen / for under us they live frank and free / and if the
french men should be lords over them / they should be taxed and tayled / and
retayled two or three times in a year / the which they are not now acustomed
unto which should be a hard thing now for them to begin. Also these three
cities are closed in round about with great lords / who are good english /
and long have been / as the lord Pyuiers / the lord Musydent / the lord
Duras / the lord Landuras / the lord Copane / the lord Rosem / the lord
Logeren / and diverse other barons and knights / by whom they should have
war at their hands / for they should not issue out of their cities but they
should be taken. For all the seneschalles writing we have no doubt yt they
should become french / how be it / good it is to send thither some valiant
wise man that is beloved among them / some such as has governed there or
this / and that is the lord Thomas Percy. Thus as it was devised it was
acomplysshed / he was desired to go thither / and to take heed of that country.
He fulfilled the kings commandment / and made him ready to depart. it was
about Christmasse / at which time the wyndes be sore and ieoperdous / he took
shyppynge in Cornewayle. He had with him two hundred men of arms and four
hundred archers. And with him was his nephue Hugh Hastynges / Thomas Colleuyll
/ Gyllyam Lysle / Johan Graily / bastard son to the Captall of Beufz /
Guillyam Traicton / Johan Danbreticourt / and diverse other / and also the
bishop of London / and master Richard Doall. They tarried till it was mydde
March or they took the sea. and or they came to Bordeaux the duke of Burbon
was come to the city of Dagen to treat with them of Burdeloys / and he did
so much by his fair words and good assurance / that the counsayles of
Bordeaux / of Bayon / and of Dax were sent to the city of Dagen. The duke
received them friendly and gave them fair words and many promyses / and showed
them that if they would turn french / and be under the obeysaunce of the
french king / what so ever they would demand should be granted them / and
sealed perpetually to endure. Many things they promised and swear to seal /
and to keep for ever. They answered / when they were returned again in to
their cities they would show all this to the people / and so take counsel
and than give answer. Thus they departed fro Dagen and fro the duke of Burbon
and returned to their towns / and showed all this to the people / but all
turned to nothing / for the comynaltyes of the said cities consydred the
business / and knew well how the realm of France was vexed and troubled
with tails and fowages and shamfull exaccions all to get money. than they said
/ if the french men govern over us they will bring us to the same usage /
yet it is better for us to be english / for they keep us frank and free. If
the londoners have deposed king Richard and crowned king Henry what is that
to us? we have and shall have always a king / and we understand that the
bishop of London and sir Thomas Percy shortly will be here / they shall
enfourme us of the truth / we have also more marchaundyse of woll / wine /
and clothe with the English men than with the frenchmen. let us be ware we
make no treaty / whereby we should repent us after. Thus the treaty with the
french men was broken and left of. Than anon after the bishop of London and
ye lord Percy with their charge of men of war aryued at Bordeaux / whereof
much people were greatly reioysed / and some displeased / such as had rather
have been french than english. All these english lords were lodged
together in the abbey of saint Andrewe / and when they saw their time they
showed to the people the state of England / and ye cause why they were sent
thither / and they did so much that every thing was apeased both there and in
all other places: For hard it was to have caused them to have turned french.

THan it was determined by the counsel of France / sith the king was in
sycknesse by reason of the displeasure that he took for the deposyng of his
son in law king Richard / yt they should send some notable wise personage
in to England to know the state of the queen. to do this message was appointed
sir Charles de la Brethe and Charles of Hangers / who (as they were commanded)
departed fro Paris and came to Boloygne / and there tarried / for they had sent
an haraulde to king Henry / for without assurau^ce they durst not go / for all
the truce that was between both realms. King Henry / who thought him self
much bound to the French king / for the chere that he had in France /
took counsel and concluded / and so the haraulde was answered that it was the
kings pleasure that they and their company should come in to England / and to
come the straight way to the king / and not to ride out of the way without
license. The haraulde returned to Boloyne and showed what he had done /
wherewith they were content / and so shypped their horses / and took the sea and
aryued at Dover / where they found ready a knight of the kings house / ^oho
received them. they had seen him before with king Henry in France / whereby
they were sooner aquaynted. so they tarried at Dover till their horses were
vnshypped / and than they rode to Caunterbury. And where so ever they bayted or
lay their hosts were paid. At last they came to Eltham / and there they
found king Henry and part of his counsel. The king made them good chere
for the love of the french king. Than they showed the king the cause of their
coming. The king answered and said. Sirs / ye shall go to London / and
there I will be within this four days and assemble my counsel / and than ye
shall have answer of your demand. That day they dyned with the king / and
after dinner they rode to London and the said knight of the kings still with
them / who saw them well lodged. The king acordyng to his promise came to
Westmynster / and these french knights had knowledge of the kings coming
thither / and made them ready to go when they should be sent for. The king had
his counsel with him / and than it was devised what answer they should have.
than they were sent for / and than it was showed them that where as they
desired to se the queen / their desire should not be denied / so that they
would swear and promise / that nouther they nor none of their men should
speak any word of that was fallen upon king Richard / for it was said to them
/ that if they did they should rynne in great dyspleasure of the people / and
be in great parell of their lives. The two knights said they would in no wise
break the order that they had set / but obey their commandment. They said
when they had ones seen and spoken with her / than they would return and
depart. Anon after the earl of Northum berlande brought them to Haueringe of
the bower to the young queen who was there as than / and with her the duches of
Irelande daughter to the lord Coucy and ye duchess of Gloucestre with her
daughters / and other ladies and damoselles. The queen received them swetely /
and demanded of them how the french king her father did and the queen her
mother. They said well / and so co^muned with her a great season. They kept
well their promise / for they spoke no word of king Richard. Than they
took leave of the queen and returned to London. Than shortly after they
went to Eltham to the king and there dyned / and ye king gave them fair
presents and iowelles / and right amyably they took their leave of the king /
who said to them. Syrs / ye may say when ye come in to France / yt the queen
of England shall have no hurt nor trouble / but shall always keep her estate
as to her belongs / and shall enjoy all her right / for as yet she shall not
know the mutacyons of the world. Of these words spoken of the kings mouth /
the two knights were well content / and so departed and lay at Dertforde / and
the next day at Osprynge / and so to Caunterbury / and than to Dover. And all
their costs and charges coming and going the kings officers paid. Than
they took the sea and aryued at Boloyne and so to Paris / and there found the
king and the queen / and showed them all that they had seen and herd. Now let
us somewhat speak of England.

How certain lords in England rose up with an army to have delivered king
Richard and to have dystroyed king Henry / and how they were slain. Cap.
CC.xivii.
Diverse questyons and arguments were made in England among noble men / and
counsayls of the good towns / yt Richard of Bordeaux was deed and slain /
wherefore men spoke no more of him / for well he had deserved it. To these
points king Henry answered and said. Nay quod he / I have pytie of his death /
I will never consent thereto. To keep him in prisone is suffycient. I have
warra^ted his life / and I will keep my promise. such as would have had him
deed said. Sir / we se well ye have Pytie on him / but ye do for your self a
perylous thing. For as long as he is a live / though he have willyngly resigned
to you the crown of England / and that every man has received you as king /
and have made to you faith and homage / yet it can not be / but that there be
in the Realm / some that loved him / and as yet do / who would lightly rise
against you / if they might se any lykelyhode of his delyueraunce. Also the
French king is sore displeased for his trouble / he would soon be revenged
if he might / and he is of great puyssaunce / with such aid as he may find
in England / The king answered and said / As long as I se not the contrary
/ or that the French king will take no part against me / I will keep my
promise. This answer that the king made / had nerehande have been to his own
distructyon. The earl of Huntyngton sir Johan of Hollande / brother to king
Richard / who had to wife king Henryes suster / could not forgette the
adventure of his brother / No more could the earl of Salisbury / and they had
at Oxenforde secret counsel toguyder. And they devised how they might
deliver king Richard out of the tower and distroye king Henry / and bring a
trouble again in to the realm. They devised to make a iustes of twenty
knights and twenty squyers to beholden at Oxenforde / and how they would
desire the king to be there privily. And while he should be sitting at the
table to slay him. For they had devised to have had men ynowe to have
performed their ententes / and they had ready a priest called Maladyn / who was
a syngar in king Rychardes chapel / to have put him in the Kings appareyle
/ for he was like king Richard in favor. And than they would have made the
people to have believed that king Richard had been delivered / and returned
in to his first state / and than^e to have sent word of their deed to the
French king / that he should incontinent have sent in to England / some
socoure to them by the earl of saint Poule or by some other. As they had
devised so they did begin. They caused a feast at Oxenforde to be proclaimed
of twenty knights and twenty squyers / well acco^panyed with ladies and
damoselles. They had also on their party the young earl of Kente / nephue to
sir Johan Hollande / and also another great lord the lord Spensar. And they
believed to have had on their party the earl Johan of Rutlande / because
king Henry had put him out of the office of the Constable ship of England /
but he failed them / for some said / by him they were bewrayed. This feast
provided for / thau the earl of Huntyngton came to Wyndsore where the king was
and humbly made his reverence / as he that thought to have disceyued the king
with sweet words / and to have got him to have come to this feast / the
which to do / he desired the king effectuously / and the king who thought none
yuell granted him so to do / whereof the earl was right ioyouse / and departed
fro the king and took his leave / and laid to the Chanon Robsarde. Sir /
appareyle you to come to our feast / I promise the if I mete the there in the
field / I shall give the a fair encountre with my spear. Than sir Johan
Robsarde said. Sir / it the king come to your feast / ye shall not fail to
find me there. Than the Earl struck his hand in his and thanked him / and so
passed forth. Diverse knights and squyers prepared the^ selfs to be at that
feast. All the armorers in London were let a work to trymme men in their
harness for the Iustes. Such as were of the kings counsel said to him.
Sir / ye have nothing to do there / ye shall not come there by our advise. We
have herd certain words in murmuryng / the which are not very pleasant nor
agreeable. We shall know more shortly. The king believed their counsel / and
so came not at that feast / nor none of his knights / nor but t^we came
thither / of such as they would have slain.

When the earl of Salisbury / the earl of Hu^tyngton / and the earl of Kente /
and the lord Spensar saw that they had failed of their entente / and that
they could not have the king as they would / than they counsayled toguyder and
said. Let us go to Wynsore and stir up the country / and we shall put
Madalyn in estate royal / and ride with him: And make the people believe that
it is king Richard / who is delivered cut of prisone / all such as shall se
him will believe it / and all such as here thereof / and thus we shall distroy
our enemies. As they devised so they did / and assembled toguyder / so that
they were a five hundred men / one and other. And they did put this Madalyn
in appareyle royal / and made him to ride with them / and so rode toward
Wyndsore where king Henry was. Godde did aid king Henry / for tidings came
to him how the said lords were coming with a great nombre to Wynsore to
slay him and how they were men ynowe to win the castle / and how they had
made Madalyn in vesture like a king / to ride with the^ / and made the people
believe that king Richard was delivered / and much people believes it / And
some say they have seen him / and believe verily that it is he. Wherefore sir /
get you hens incontinent and ride to London / for they are coming straight
hyder. The king believed their counsel. And so he and all his men lepte on
their horses and departed fro Wyndsore and rode toward London. And the king
was not far gone but that these lords came to Wyndsore / and entered in at
the gates of the castle / for there was none to say them nay. Thanne they
went sertchynge fro Chamber to chamber / and in the Chanons houses / wenyng to
find the king / but they failed. When they saw it would not be they were
right sore displeased / and than departed fro Wynsore and lay that night at
Colebroke / and they made much people to go with them / what byforce and by
treaty. Saying how king Richard was in their company / some believed it and
some not. King Henry who douted of trayson / hasted him in his journey / and
ca^e to the tower of London by a secret way / Than he went to Richard of
Burdeux and said. I have saved your life with much pain and now ye would
murder me / by your brother and other / but this enterprice shall be yuell for
you. Richard of Bordeaux excused him greatly and said. As god might help him
and save his soul / he knew nothing thereof / nor he would never desire other
astate than he was in. Thus the matter stood. Tha^ king Henry sent for the mayre
of London / and for other of his special friends / and than he showed them all
the matter as it was. The lo^doners had great marueyle thereof and said. Sir / ye
must send for your men and go against them be times / or they multiply any
further. We have made you king / and so ye shall continue who soever have envy
thereat. Tha^ letters were written in have / and messangers sent forth in to
all parts. The king wrote to his constable the earl of Northumberla^de and to
his marshall the earl of Westmerla^de and to all other knights and squyers in
to Essexe / and in to other places / where as he thought to have aid of men /
such as herd thereof / ca^e to the king as fast as they might.

THan the earls of Huntyngton and of Salisbury / and other of their affynyte /
took counsel and advise to draw toward London / for they said / it could
not be none otherwise / but that some of the Londoners loved king Richard /
and all such they said / would come to take their perte Than they departed fro
Colbroke and went and lodged at Braynforde / a seuyn mile fro London / but
there was never a lo^doner that came to them but drew all in to their city.
When these lords saw that / the next morning they took the way to saint
Albons / and there lodged and taries there a day / and fro thens they went to
Barcamstede. Thus they went about the country / and still made to be reported /
that this Madalyn was king Richard / and so came to a good town called
Suscettour / where there was a baylye set there by king Henry / who had the
keeping of the town and the country there about. When these lords were come
to Suscettour / they lodged there one night in rest and peace / for the bailey
was not strong enough to fight with the^ / therefore he dissymuled as well as he
might. And the next morning the earl of Salisbury and the lord Spensar
departed fro the earl of Huntyngton and fro the earl of Kent / and said how
they would ride further to get and to turn mo men to their opinyon / and to go
and se the lord Bercley / and to ride a long by the river of Syuerne. They
were yuell counsayled when they departed one fro another / for they were so
much the weaker. The earl of Huntyngton began to treat with the bailey and
with the men of Suscettour / and showed them how king Richard was delivered
/ and how that the lo^donets had / delivered him / and that he should be there
within two days after. The bailey (who had assembled a good nombre of them of
the country) said / that the contrary was true / and how that he had such
tidings fro king Henry and fro the londoners / that he would execute their
commandment. When therle of Hu^tyngton herd those words he changed color
/ and saw well he was disceyued. Than he entered in to his lodging and armed
him / and caused his me^ to do the same / and thought to co^quere those
villayns by battle and to set the town a fire / thereby to abasshe the
people. The baylye of the town on the other part hasted him / and assembled
all his men in a certain place / and he was with archers and other a two
thousand men / and the lords had not past a three hundred men. How be it they
came out of their lodgings and began the battle / and archers shot on
both parts so that many were hurt. Than the bailey with his great nombre came
upon them without sparynge / for he had special commandment fro king Henry
that he should outher take the^ quick or deed / if he might overcome them. So
finally the Earls men were feign to withdraw in to the houses. Than the
bailey and his men enuyroned their lodgings on all parts / and specially where
the two Earls were / and made there such assautes / that they entered perforce:
There were many hurt and slain. Therle of Hu^tyngton defended him self
valyauntly as long as he might: But there were so many against him / that
there he was slain / and with him the young earl of Kente / for whom great
sorrow was made in diverse parts of England / for he was a fair young man /
and was there in manner against his will / but his uncle and the earl of
Salisbury brought him thereto. The men of Suscettour who were fierce against
the^ / struck of their heedes and sent them by a messanger to the mayre of
London / therewith to rejoice the king and the londoners. Therle of Salisbury
and the lord Spensar came to a like conclusyon / for certain knights and
squiers of the kings took them where they were / and struck of their heedes
and sent them to London / and many such as were with them alyed were put to
execucion / both knights and squyers. After that the realm was in good rest
and peace.

How the french king raised up an army to send upon the fronters of
England. Cap. CC.xlviii.
When easter was come / the year of our lord god. M. four hundred. The french
king / his brother / his uncles / and his counsel understood how certain
Englysshmen of arms and archers should pass the sea and come to Calais and to
Guynes / to Ha^mes / and to those fronters. Than there was a commandment made
through France / that every knight and squire should be ready to leap a horse
back / and to go thider as they should be sent / specially Bolonois and the sea side was well provided for.

The same time duke Johan of Bretayne died / and behind him he left two
sons and a daughter. The eldest son^e should have married the french kings
second daughter for he might not have theldest / because she was married in to
England to king Richard. This treaty of marriage first for the eldest
daughter of France with the heir of Bretayne / was concluded at Tourse in
Tourayn but afterward by the kings consent and his counsel / and to
thentent to marry her the more richely / that marriage was broken with Bretayne
/ and she married in to England. And diverse lords in France said and feared /
that no good should come thereof: but than they concluded for ye second
daughter. Than after the death of the duke of Bretaine it was advised that ye
duke of Orlyau^ce with a certain no^bre of men of war should draw to ye
marches of Bretayne to speak with ye bretons / and with the cou^saylours of good
towns / to know what they would do with their heir / and to desire the^ to
deliver him to be kept in the house of France. The duke of Orlyau^ce did
acording to this deuyse / and with a certain no^bre came to Ponthorson and
there rested / and sent word of his coming to the lords of Bretaigne. Than
prelates / lords / and cou^saylours of the good towns in ye name of the three
estates of the country assembled togider / and were determined what answer to
make / and so they came to Pounthorson to the duke of Orlyaunce / and there
they made their answer all after one sort / and that was. They said / how
that their young lord and heir of Bretayne / they would keep him themselves
in his own country. Than the duke of Orlyau^ce seeing it would none otherwise
be / he took bo^des of the grettest lords in Bretayne / such as had chief
charge of the country / that they should deliver him to the french king / wha^
the child should come to his age. These writings made and sealed / than the
duke deperted and returned in to France / and showed the king his brother how
he had spedde.

IT was well known in England / how the French king had furnysshed his
garysons / cities / good towns and castles on the fronters of Picardy and
Bolonois / and how the frenchmen had closed so the passages over ye water of
So^me that no marchandyse / corn / nor other thing should not pass Abuyle /
nor ye merchants of England / who were wont to go in to France with their
marchau^dise / durst no more come there / nor the french merchants durst
not come in to England / so that the fronters on both perties were in great
ruin and desolacion / and yet they made no warr^ together / for they had no
commandment so to do. Than it was said to king Henry. sir / advise you well /
it seems by the Frenchmen they will make you war: they make great prouisyon
for ships at Harflewe / and capitayns of their army is / the earl of saint
Poule and sir Charles de la Breath. And it were to suppose / that if the earls
of Huntyngton and of Salysbury were a live / and all such as be dedde / the
Frenchmen than would soon pass over the sea / on trust to have great alyaunce
and aid in England. But sir / as long as Richard of Bordeaux is a live /
you nor your realm shall be at no surety. I believe that ye say is true quod
the king / but as for me I will not cause him to be slain / for I have so
promised him / and I will keep my promise / without I perceive that he work
trayson against me. Well sir ^abqod; they of his counsel / it were better for
you that he were deed rather than a live. For as long as the french men know
that he is lyueng / they will enforce them to make you war / and will hope
always to bring him again in to his former estate / because of his wife the
French kings daughter. The king gave none answer but departed fro them as
than / and left his counsel co^munyng together / and the king went and took
a faucon on his hand / and passed over that matter.

Of the death of king Richard of England / and how the truse between
England and France was reuewed. And also of the deposicion of pope Benedic at
Auignon. Cap. CC.xlix.
IT was not long after / that true tidings ran thoroughe London / how
Richard of Burdeaulx was deed / but how he dyed and by what means I could
not tell when I wrote this cronycle. But this king Richard deed was laid in
a lytter and set in a chair / covered with black Baudkynne / and four
horses all black in the chair / and two men in black leadyng the chair /
and four kynghtes all in black following. Thus the chare departed fro the tower
of London / and was brought a long through London fair and softely till they
ca^e into chepesyde / where as the chief assembly of London was / and there the
chare rested the space of two hours. thither came in and out mo than xx.M.
persons men and women to se him where as he lay / his hedde on a black
quisshen / and his visage open. some had on him pytie and so^e none but said /
he had long a go deserved death. Now consider well ye great lords / kings /
dukes earls / barons and prelates / and all men or great lynage and puissauce:
se and behold how the fortunes of this world are marvelous / and turn
diversely. This king Richard reigned king of England.xxii. year in great
prosperity / holdyng great estate and signorie. There was never before any king
of England yt spente so much in his house as he did / by a. C.M. florens
every year. For I sir John^ Froissart chanon and treasourer of Chinay knew it
well for I was in his court more tha a quarter of a year togider / and he made
me good chere / because yt in my youth I was clerk and servant to the noble
king Edward the third his grautfather / and with my lady Philyp of Heynault
queen of England his grandame. and when I deperted fro him / it was at Wynsore
/ and at my departing the king sent me by a knight of his called sir John^
Golofer / a gob let or silver and gylte weyeng two mark of silver / and within
it a.C. nobles / by the which I am as yet the better / and shall be as long as I
live / wherefore I am bound to pray to God for his soul / and with much
sorrow I write of his death. But because I have co^tynued this history /
therefore I write thereof to follow it. In my time I have seen two things /
though they differ yet they be true. I was in ye city of Burdeux and sytting
at the table wha^ king Richard was borne / ye which was on a tuisday about.x.
of the clock. The same time there ca^e there as I was sir Richard Pou^tcardon
marshall as than of Ac^tayne / and he said to me. Froissart / write and put in
memory yt as now my lady pricesse is brought abeed with a fair son on this
twelfe day / yt is the day of the three kings / and he is son to a kings son
and shall be a king. This ge^tyll knight said truth / for he was king of
England xxii. year. But when this knight said these words / he knew full
little what should be his conclusyon. And the same time that king Richard was
borne his father the prince was in Galyce / the which king Dompeter had given
him / and he was there to co^quere the realm. Upon these things I have
greatly ymagined sithe / for the first year that I ca^e in to England in to
the service of queen Philyppe / King Edward and the queen / and all their
children were as than at Barcamstede / a manner of the prince of Wales be yonde
London. The king and the Queen were came thither to take leave of their sofie
the prince and the pri^cesse / who were going in to Acquitayne. And there I
herd an ancient knight deuyse among the ladies and said. There is a book
which is called le Brust / and it deuyseth that the prince of Wales eldest son
to the king / nor the duke of Clarence / nor the duke of Glocestre should never
be king of England: but ye realm and crown should return to ye house of
Lacastre. There I Johan Froissart auctour of this cronycle co^sydring all these
things. I say these two knights / sir Richard Pountcardon and sir Bartylmewe
of Bruels laid both truth / For I saw / and so did all the world /
Richard of Bordeaux.xxii. year king of England / and after ye crown
returned to the house of Lancastre. And yt was when king Henry was king / the
which he had never ben if Richard of Bordeaux had dalte amyably with him: for
the Londoners made him king / because they had pytie on him and on his
children. Thus when king Richard had layne two hours in the chare in Chepe
side / than they drove the chair forward. And when the four knights that
followed the chare a sote were without London / they lept than on their horses /
which were there ready for them. And so they rode till they ca^e to a vyllage
called Langle / a.xxx. mile from London: and there this king Richard was
buried / god have mercy on his soul.

Tydinges spredde abroad how king Richard was deed / he tarried every day for
it / for every man might well consydre / that he should never come out of
prisone a live. His death was long kept and hid fro his wife. The French
king and his counsel were well informed of all this / and the knights and
squyers desired nothing but ye war / and that they might ride upon the
fronters. How be it the counsayls / as well of the one realm as of the other
took their advise / and thought it best to uphold still the truse that was
taken before they thought it more profitable than ye war. And a new treaty
was devised to be in the marches of Calais / because the french king was not
in good case nor had not been / sithe he knew of the trouble that king
Richard was in. And yet his sickness doubled wha^ he knew that he was deed
/ so that the duke of Burgoyne had the chief rule of ye realm. And he came to
saint Omers and to Burbour^ where the duke of Burbone was and sir Charles de la
Breast / and Charles of Hangeers and Johan of Castle Morant. and of prelates /
the patriarch of Jerusalem / and the bysshoppes of Paris and of Beauoyes. And
on the English party there was the earl of Northumberlande / the earl of
Rutlande / the earl of Deuonshyre / and the lord Henry Percy the earls son /
and yuan of Fitzwaren. and prelates / there were the bysshoppes of Wynchester
and of Ely. The french men demanded to have again delivered ye young queen of
England / but the English men would in no wise deliver her / but said / she
should live still in England upon her dowry. and that though she had lost her
husband / they would provide for her another / yt should be fair / young / and
gentle / with whom she should be better pleased than with Richard of Bordeaux /
for he was old: and this should be the prince of Wales / eldest sofie to king
Henry. To this the Frenchmen would not agree / for they would not consent thereto
without license of the king her father / who as than was not in good point /
for he was farr^ out of ye way no medysyn could help him. So that matter was
laid aparte and the treaty of truse went forward / in such wise / that by
consent of both parties / they swear and were bound to keep the truse.xxvi.
year more / to the four years that it had endured / the which in all was.xxx.
year / according to the first covenant. and upon this / writings were made
and sealed by procuracyons of both kings. this done / every man returned to
their own countries. I have not as yet showed you what became of therle
Marshall / by whom first all these trybulacyons began in the realm of England
/ but now I shall show you. He was at Venyce / and wha^ he knew that king
Henry was king and king Richard taken and deed. He took thereof so great
displeasure and sorrow / that he laid him down on his bed and fell in a
fransy / and so dyed: Such mischeuousnesse fell in those days upon great
lords of England.

And in the year of our lord god a thousand four hundred one less. Pope
Benedic at Auignon / who had been sustained long by the French men / was as
than deposed. And in likewise so was the king of Almaygne for his yuell deeds.
For the clectours of the Empire / and all the dukes and barons of Almaygne rose
against him / and sent him in to Boesme / where as he was king. and they chose
another a valiant and a wyseman to be king of Almayne / and he was one of the
Bauyers / and was called Robert of Heleberge. And he came to Coloygne where he
was crowned with the crown of Almayne / for they of Ayes would not open their
town to him / nor the duke of Guerles would not be under his obeysaunce. This
new king of Almaygne promised to bring the church to a unity and peace. How
be it the French king and his counsel treated with the legeoys / who held
with the pope at Rhome. And they did so much by the means of sir Baudwyn of
Mount Iardyne / who governed a great part of ye bysshoprike of Liege / who was
a knight of the French kings / so that by his means at the desire of the
french king / the country of Liege turned to become neuter: so that the
Legeois sent to Rome for all the clergy yt were there of their country to
come by a certain day / or else to lose all their benefyces in the country.
When they herd that / they returned fro Rome and ca^e to Liege. And pope
Bonyface / who lost much by that transmutacion / sent a legate in to Almaygne
to preche among them / to cause them to return again to his part / but the
legate durst not pass Coloigne / and sent letters to Liege. When those
letters were reed ye messanger was answered / that on pain of drownyng he
should no more comeon such message. For they said / as many messanger as
comes with any such message / shall be drowned in the river of Moeuze.
