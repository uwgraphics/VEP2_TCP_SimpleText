TO THE VIRTUOUS AND GODLY MATRON, SARA SPE^R, Grace, mercy and peace, in
Christ Jesus, Amen.
Dear Sister, you know this World is not your home, but a Pilgrimage, and a
place wherein God tries his children: And I doubt not, but you have learned,
how to make right use and profit of the Lord his merciful chastisements: For,
the Lord uses many ways and means for the trial of his. I know, You have
heard of the patience of JOB, (as says the Apostle JAMES) and you have seen
in the end, how that God is merciful, patient and long suffering: even so say I
unto you, that you shall receive accordingly, if so be you be patient: that is,
if you fear God, set his word before your eyes, and serve him thereafter: and
if he lay his cross on you, bear it with patience, the which you shall do,
when you considder it, not according to the present sense, but according to the
end. Heb. 12. And I doubt not, but you are of the number of them, which are
daily dying to themselves, and this sinful world: Ye are one of them that
looks for a city, whose builder and maker is God: Heb. 13. 14
Ye are one of them that knows your self and your being, Genes. 15. 13. 14.
to be in this earth, but as a Pilgrim and stranger: for here ye have no
byding place: Ye are one of them which have made a Covenant with God, Deuteronomy.
29. 14. 15.
to forsake your self, and this sinful World: Ye are one of them, Mal. 3. 16.
who say, Nay, The Lord has all things written in his memorial book, for
such as fear him and remember his Name: Ye are one of them, which have their
Loins girded about, Luke 52. 35
and their lights burning in their hands: Like unto servants that wait upon
their Lords coming: Yea, and I am certainly persuaded, that you (and your
godly Brethren and Sister,) are of the number of them, who have the Lord for
their portion, Deuteronomy. 32. ^
which have their hope in heaven, Col. 1. 27.
whose leader is Christ Jesus the son of God, and governor of Heaven and
Earth, unto him is given all power, Mat. 28. 18.
he is God almighty with the Father and the holy Ghost, praise vvorthie for
evermore.

Now (dear sister) I partly knowing the present estate of your troubled and
perplexed mind, in regard of the want of your greatest outward comfort, I
thought it good, to present you with this sweet Sermon (made by that
godly-learned and zealous Pastor of Christ's Church, M. RICHARD GREENHAM) which
by Gods providence came unto my hands; containing a comfort for a troubled
conscience, he being through the mercy of God, a man greatly exercised
therewith, and therefore taught the same through his own experience: hoping,
through the working of Gods holy spirit, it shall also minister comfort unto
your trobled mind. Therefore (my dear sister) to conclude, I beseech you to be
instant with our merciful God, by hearty prayer, for the spirit of wisdom,
knowledge, humblenes, meeknes, sobriety and repentance, which even the best of
Gods Children have great need of, because our sins continually prouokes the
Lord our God to be angry with us: but let us bear his fatherly corrections,
and acknowledge our faults with bitter tears, and sorrowful sighs: not
doubting, but so he will be merciful unto us in Christ: To whom with the
Father and the holy spirit, be all glory, honor, praise, and everlasting
thanks, for evermore. Amen.

Your wel-willer in the Lord R. W.

A SVVEET AND COMFORTABLE SERMON FOR A TROVbled Conscience.
PROVE. 18. 14. The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity: but a wounded
spirit who can bear it.


THIS Scripture is not only worthy to be graven in steel with the point of
an Adamant, and in letters of gold; but also to be written and registered by
the finger of Gods spirit in the tables of the heart: which sentence, briefly
speaks thus much unto us; that what trouble soever befalls a man, his mind
vnapalled, he will indifferently bear it out: But if the spirit of a man be
once troubled and dismayed, he cannot tell how to be delivered. And no marvel,
for if the mind of man be that fountain of comfort, which ministers comfort
to him in all other troubles, and if it become comfortless, what shall comfort
it? if it be void of help, where shall (...) be helped? If the eye which is
the light of the body, be darkness; how great is that darkness? If the salt
which sauoreth all things be unsavory, for what is it good? If the mind which
sustaineth all troubles be troubled, how intolerable is that trouble? To show
this the better, we will first declare, how great a punishment of God this
wound of Conscience is. Secondly, we will teach, how this trouble of mind may
be avoided. Lastly, we will set down, how Gods children falling in some
measure into this affliction of spirit, may be recovered out of it.

For the first, the grief of this malady is seen, either by some due
consideration of the persons that have felt it, or by some wise comparison,
made between this grief of mind, and other outward griefs incident to a man.

The persons, in whom we may consider this wound of spirit, are either
meerlie natural men, or such as be renewed by the spirit of God: the men
merely natural, are either the heathen, such as never knew God in Christ: or
carnal professors, such as have not protested Christianity aright: If we
look among the Heathen, how many of them have willingly gone under poverty,
and have been content to unburden themselves of all worldly tresures, how have
some of them, whilst their minds were vnapalled, suffered imprisonment exile,
and extreme tortures of body, rather than they would betraye their Cuntries:
etc. How many of them have devoured many injuries, and born outward troubles
with some ease, and with no resistance, whilst their minds were at liberty?
and yet look not to the ^^^nest, but to the best and most excellent men among
them, even their wise Philosophers, sweet Orators, and exquisite Poets; who in
bearing and forbearing, they thought the chiefest point of virtue to consist:
and yet ye shall see, when once some great distress of mind did wound them;
some would make an end of it, by preparing a cup of deadly poison; some would
violently and voluntarily run on their enemies pykes; some would throw down
themselves from high mountains; some would not stick to stabbe most
monstrouslie their own bodies with daggers, or such like instruments of death.
All which men, would seem to have great courage, in sustaining many harms,
so long as their minds were not over maistered; but when that devine and
supreme essence which they acknowledged, did by his power cross and ouerturne
their witty devises, and headstrong attemptes, so as without hope of remedy,
they were hampered in pensiuenes and sorrow of mind: then being not able to
turn themselves under so heavy a burden, they shrink down, and by violent
death, would rid themselves of that disquietnes and impatiencie of their
troubled minds. But, let us come nearer, and whether we behold the Papists,
or the family of Love, or the common sort of Christians, we shall see, they
will pass quietly through many afflictions; whether for that they have a
spirit of slumbering and numnesse cast on them; whether because they have
branned themselves through some sensles blockishnes, as men hewn out of hard
oaks, or graven out of marble stones, I know not: but yet when the Lord shall
let lose the cord of their conscience, and shall set before their faces their
sins committed, see what fearful ends they have: so, whilst some of them by
hanging themselves, some by casting themselves into the water, some by cutting
their own throats, have rid themselves out of their intolerable griefs.
Now, wherein is the difference, that some die so sensleslie, and some dispatch
them so violently? Surely, the one feeling no sin, depart like brutish
hoggs: the other sure charged with sin, depart like barking dogs: But let us
come to the children of God, who have in some degrees felt this troble of
mind, and it will appear both in the members, and in the head of all
burdens, to be a thing most intolerable to suffer a wounded conscience: and
to begin with, let us set in the first rank Job, that man of God, commended
unto us by the holy Ghost, for a mirror of patience; who although for his
riches, he was the welthiest man in the land of VZ, and for his authority
might have made afraid a great multitude: whose substance was the greatest of
all the men of the East: yet when the Sabeans came violently and took away all
his cattle; when the fire of God from heaven burnt up his sheep and his
servants; when the Caldeans had taken away his Camels; when a great wind
smote down his house upon his children; although indeed he rent his garments,
which was not so much for impatiencie, as to show that he was not insensible
in these evils: yet it is said, that he worshipped and blessed the name of the
Lord, saying: Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked shall I return
thither: Howbeit, behold, when at the strong conference of his comfortless
friends, his mind began to be agasht, which was not so in all his former
trial: when his Conscience began to be troubled, when he saw the Lord fasten
in him sharp arrows, and to set him up as a Butt to shoot at: when he thought
God caused him to possess the sins of his youth, this glorious pattern of
patience, could not bear his grief, he was heavy, and so may commend to all,
the image of a wounded spirit that shall come after. David, a man chosen
according to the Lords own heart: Ezeckiah, a pure worshipper of God, and a
careful restorer of true Religion, Jeremiah the Prophet of the Lord,
sanctified and ordained to that office before he was formed in his mothers
womb, were rare and singular in the graces of God: yet when they felt this
wound pearcing them, with grief of heart; they were as Sparrows mourning, as
Cranes chattering, as Pellicanes casting out fearful cries: they thought
themselves as in the grave, they wished to have dwelt solitary, they were as
bottels parched in the smoke, they were as Doves mourning, not able without
sighs and groans to utter their words, their hearts claue to the dust, and
their tongues to the roof of their mouth: but above all, if these were not
sufficient to persuade us in this doctrine, there remains one example, whom
we affirm to be the perfect annotomie of an afflicted mind; that is, the Lord
and Savior of us all, Christ Jesus, the Image of the Father, the head of the
body, the mirror of all graces: the wisdom, righteousness, holiness and
redemption of all Saints; who sustained the cross, even from his youth
upward, besides poverty, baseness, and hunger, did willingly undergo that
great trouble of contempt and reproach, and that among them, where he should
have had a right deserved honor, in respect of the doctrine that he taught
them, and in regard of the manifold miracles wrought among them: as the healing
of the sick; the giving sight to the blind; and restoring life to the dead:
this unkindness nevertheless, did not so much stick into him; but, at what time
he was set as a sacrifice for all, when he was to bear our infirmities, and
carry our sorrows; at what time he was plagued, smitten of God, humbled and
wounded for our transgressions; when he should be broken for our iniquities,
and the chastisement of our peace was upon him, then he cried out, My soul is
heavy even unto the death, then he prays, O Father, if it be possible, let
this cup pass from me: but how prayed he? even with sweating: how sweated
he? even drops of blood: how often prayed he? three times: when ended his
agony? not till he was dead: what said he being ready to depart? My God, my
God, why have thou forsaken me? was this for his humane death, as some have
imagined? no, we wicked men have died without complaint, whose patience then
might have seemed to exceed his: it was his suffering in his humane spirit,
which encountered with the wrath of God, his God-heade suppressing it for a
while, he suffered many torments in his body, but much more heavilie did the
wrath of God lie upon his soul: if this consideration of an afflicted spirit
in these examples, does not sufficiently show, what a grievous thing it is to
suffer a wounded conscience, let us proceed with the comparing of this with
other evils, which falls into the nature of man: there is no sickness, but
physic provides it a remedy: there is no sore, but Chirurgerie will afforde a
salve: freindship helps poverty: there is no impresonment, but there is hope
of liberty; suit and favor recouereth a man from banishment: authority and
time wears away reproach. But what physic cures: what chirurgerie salveth:
what riches ransom: what countenance bears out: what authority asswageth:
what salve delayeth a troubled conscience? All these banded together in
league: though they would conspyre a confederacy, cannot help this our distres
of a troubled or unquiet mind. And yet this one comfort of a quiet mind does
wonderfully cure, and comfortablie aswage all other griefs whatsoever. For if
our assistance were, as an host of armed soldiers: if our friends were the
Princes and all the governors of the earth: if our possessions were as large
as between the east and the west: if our meat were as Manna from heaven: if our
apparel were as costelie, as the Ephod of Aaron: if every day were as
glorious as the day of Christ's resurrection: yet our minds, being appalled
with the judgment of God, these things would little comfort us. Let experience
speak, if a troubled mind impaireth not health and dries not up the blood,
consumes not the marrowe, pyneth not away the flesh, and consumes the bones:
if it make not all pleasures painful, and shortneth not the life: surely no
wisdom can conceal it, no counsel can advise it, no advise can assuage it,
no asswagement can cure it, no eloquence can persuade it, no power can overcome
it, no scepter will affray it, no Enchanter can charm it; and yet on the
contrary. If a man languish in sickness, so his heart be whole, and he is
persuaded of the health of his soul; his sickness does not grieve him. If a man
be reproched, so he be precious in the sight of God and his Angels, what loss
has he? If a man be banished, and yet doubts not, that heaven is his
cuntrie, and that he is a Citizen among the Saints, it does not appall him. If
a man be in trouble, and finds peace of Conscience, he will quietly digest
his trouble: but if the mind be troubled, who dares meet with the wrath of
the Lord of Hosts? Who can put to silence the voice of desperation? Who will
step out and make an agreement with the highest to spare us? Who dare make a
covenant with the devil, that he would not lay claim to us? If then a good
conscience helps all evils, and all other benefits of this life, in them
selves cannot help a troubled conscience, nor see it true by proof, which
hear it by proverb, The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a
vvounded spirit who can bear it? Again, in all other afflictions, we may have
some comfort against sin, but this is ever accompanied with the accusation of
sin: A man may be sick, reproched, imprisoned, and yet in all these have a
clear conscience, his own heart telling him, that there is no spiritual cause
of these crosses in him, but that he may suffer them for the trial of his
faith, or for righteousness sake and well doing: but where the spirit is wounded,
there is still a guiltines of sin; and when a man's spirit is troubled, he
suspecteth all his ways, he fears all his sins, he knows not what sin
to begin with, it breeds such hurlie-burlies in him; that when it is day, he
wishes it were night, and when it is night, he would have it day: his meat
does not nourish him, his dreams are fearful unto him, his sleep often times
forsakes him; if he speak, he is little eased; if he keep silence, he
boyleth with disquietnes of heart: the light does not comfort him, the
darkness does grieve him; to prosecute our comparison: where all other evils
are the more tolerable, because they be temporal and pursues us but to death;
this not being cured, ends not in death, but becomes eternally: for even
the Heathen men thought, that death was the end of al miseries: the persuasion
thereof, made them being in some misery, to make an end of themselves, and
hasten their own death; as Satan does make many now adays to do, who are
ignorant of the Hells, which is a place of far greater pain, than any they can
suffer in this world whatsoever. Howbeit, a tormented conscience, if before it
was begun, is now continued; or if it were not before, now begins, and
never ends, world without end. For, though true it is, that poverty,
imprisonment or banishment, have ended their times in death, yet a wounded
heart, which was temporal in this life; that which before death was in hope
recoverable, is after death made both incurable, and vnrecoverable. It is good
then to considder, if even in this life, the torment of Conscience be so
fearful, how much more grievous it is to sustain it in hell, where that is
infinite, which here is finite; where that is unmeasurable, which here is
measurable, where is the sea of sorrow, whereof this is but a drop; where is
the flame of that fire, whereof this is but a spark: But to shut up argument,
some there have been, that throughout their life time, have been free from
other troubles; so as either they felt them not at all, or in very small
measure, and by that means never knew their headache: For poverty, never
knew what want meant: who for discredit, were never evil spoken of; who ever
put far from them the evil day of the Lord: who have made a league with
death (as it were) and a covenant with hell; who thought they could crucify
every cross rather than come under any, yet they could never escape a wounded
conscience, either in this life or in the life to come: true it is, that Gods
children by faith and repentance do often escape it; but the wicked and such as
are borne to it, as to their sure inheritance, the more they fly from it, the
more it pursues them. If we transgress the civil laws, the Judge by bribes
may be corrupted: If a man have committed some capital offense by flying his
Cuntrie, he may escape the Magistrates hands: But our conscience telling us,
that we have sinned against God: what bribe shall we offer, or whither shall
we flee? where shall we go from his spirit, or whither shall we flee from his
presence? If we ascend into heaven, is he not there? If we lie down in hell,
is he not there? If we fly to the uttermost parts of the earth, is he not
there also? there needs no Paritoure to summon us, there needs no Bailife to
fetch us, there needs no accuser to give in verdite against us: sin will
arrest us, and lies at the door, our own conscience will impanell a queast
against us, our own hearts will give in sufficient evidence, and our iniquities
will plead guilty to our faces: Thus we see, both by the experience of them
that have suffered the wound of the spirit, and the comparing it with other
evils: what a weight most grievous, and a burden intolerable it is, to have
a tormented Conscience. Now, let us show how we may prevent it, and by what
means Gods children often fall into some degrees of it: but if it rage in
extremity, it is an evil vnrecoverable, yet many safely and quietly be
delivered from it: and here a just complaint is to be taken up; and it is a
wonder to be marked, (if we may wonder at Gods works) that we see many so
careful and watchful to avoid other troubles, and so few or none take any
pain to escape trouble of mind, which is so grievous; we see men loving
health, and loathing sickness; in diet temperate; in sleep moderate; in
physic expert; skillful to purge; and so to avoid such corrupt humors which
in time many breed, though presently they do not bring forth sickness: yet to
avoid the diseases of the soul, no man abateth his sleep, none abridgeth his
diet, no man prepares physic for it, no man knows when to be full, and when
to be empty: how to want, and how to abound: others, carried away with the
love of riches, and fearful to fall into poverty, will not stick to rise
early, to take sleep lately, to fare hardly, to travel and tire their flesh
in labor, by Land and by Sea, in fair and foul weather, by rocks and by
sands, from far and from near: but to fall into spiritual decay, to avoid
the poverty of Conscience, noe man takes such pains, as though salvation and
peace in mind, were a thing not worth the laboring for: some ambitiouslie
hunting after honor, and not easily digesting reproach, behave themselves
neither sluggishly nor sleepily, but are active in every attempt, by love and
by counsel; by prudence and prowess, by wit and by practice, by labor and
learning, by caring and diligence to become famous, and to shun a civil
reproach: yet to be glorious in the sight of God and his Angels, to fall before
the heavens, and in the presence of the Almighty, to be covered with shame and
confusion of conscience, we make none account, as they, who never use means to
obtain the one, nor avoid the occasions which may bring the other: others
unwilling to come within the danger of the Law, that they may escape
imprisonment of the body, or confiscation of goods, will be painful in penal
statutes, skillful in every branch of the civil laws; and especially, will
labor to keep themselves from treasons, murder, fellonies, and such like
offenses of life and death; yet when the Lord God, threatens the loss both of
soul and body, the attaching of our souls* the confiscating of our
consciences; the banishing us from heaven; the hanging of us in hell; the
suspending of our salvation; the adjudging of us to condemnation, for the
breach of his commandments: no man searches his eternal Law, no man cares
for the Gospel, neither the sentence of an everlasting devorcement from the
Lord: neither the covenant of reconciliation is esteemed of us. And to reach
out our complainte one degree farther: behold, the more we seek outward
pleasures, and to avoid the inward trouble of mind, the more we have and run
into it: and we speed to plunge our selves in a wounded spirit, before we be
aware: who posteth more to become rich, who hops less to become poor, than
the Merchant man? who adventureth greater treasures, who hazardeth his goods,
who puts in jeopardie his life, and yet suddenly he rusheth upon the rock
of hardness of heart, or else is swallowed up of the gulf of a dispairing mind,
from which happily, he cannot be redeemed with a ship-full of gold? Woeful
proof has confirmed, how some men wholly set upon pleasure, such as could
not away to be sad, and hedged up always of godly sorrow, have had their
troubles made snares unto them, and even their excess of pleasure, has
brought excess of sorrow: and whilst they labored to put the evil day far
from them, they have used such follies, as have been the bitter and most speedy
hangmen of their sorrowful Consciences. There be some of an other sort, who
never dreaming of a troubled mind, have had their hearts set on nothing, but
how they might get some great fame and renown, and therefore have slipped into
such dangerous attempts and foul flatteries, as they have not only lost the
peace of their Consciences, but also fallen most deeply into shame, which they
sought to shun. Now, as the peace of Conscience and joy of mind, is such a
treasure, as the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, nor the tongue
cannot express, but passes all understanding: so the wounded spirit is such,
as the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, nor the tongue uttered it,
but passes all understanding* and as they only know what the peace of mind
means that feel it, so they alone can in truth speak of a troubled mind,
that have tasted of it by experience. But let us show what way is to be used,
to keep us from this wound of spirit; it is the use of Physic, as to cure us
from diseases when we are fallen into them, so to preserve us from sicknesses,
before it has taken hold of us: so it is the power of the word, as to aswage
the trouble of Conscience, when it does once press us, so to prevent it
before it has overtaken us. It is a chief point of worldly wisdom, not to
tarry for the use of physic, till we be deadly sick; but to be acquainted with
Gods merciful preservatiues to defend us from it: likewise, it is a chief
policy of a godly Christian, not only to seek comfort when the agony is
upon him, but also to use all good helps, to meet with it before it comes: and
if we condemn them of folly, who will not as well labor to keep themselves
out of debt, as to pay the debt when we owe it: so it is a madness, not to be as
circumspect, to avoid al occasions which may bring trouble of mind upon us: as
we would be provident to enter every good way, which may draw us out of this
trouble when we have once entered into it: these remedies preservatiue are
first the searching of our sins, and then the examining of our faith: the
examining of our sin, is either the due acknowledging of our sins, or the
sense and feeling of them, the acknowledging of sin, is either of those that be
past, whether we have repented of them, or of those that are present, whether
we are truly grieved for them: Thirdly, of those secreet corruptions to come,
whether we are reverently afraid of them: concerning sins past, we must call to
mind the sins done of old in our youth, in our middle age, and in our old
age, that we judging of our selves, may not be judged of the Lord; that
accusing our selves, Satan have no occasion to accuse us; and throwing down
our selves before the Lord, he may lift us up: for many going quietly away, and
sleeping securely in their sleeves, notwithstanding the sins of their youth;
and neglecting to make conscience of their sins done long ago, suddenly have
fallen into such horror of mind, that the violent remembrance of all their
sins sure charging, they have been overwhelmed: this examination does then
rightly proceed, when it is reached to the errors of this life, and to the
sins of our youth; because many, even from their childe-hood, by a civil
righteous life, having escaped gross sins, wherewith the world culd never
charge them, have notwithstanding carried the burden of more secreet sins done
in their youth: David Psalm. 25. 7. prays the Lord, not to Remember the
sins of his youth: Job, the man of God confesses, that the Lord writing
bitter things against him, made him to possess the iniquities of his youth:
what shall we think, that David, or Job were given to notorious wickedness in
their youth, no: but they knew they were subject to youthful wantonness, and
vntamednes of affections; which though it did not burst out, yet it made them
less careful to glorify God; with loosenes, the way to lewdnes; with weakness,
the way to strange vanities; with wantonness, the way to open wickedness, is even
in the best of Gods Children in the days of their youth: which being afterward
in the time of their regeneration, brought as it were to judgment, and laid
before their consciences, does cause them to repent. But here is a thing to be
blushed at, which makes men's ears to tingle when they hear it, that many men
no doubt, far from this true Repentance, can largely indeed discourse of the
things done in their youth, but with such a braverie, with such a bosting, and
pleasing of themselves therein, as besides, that they provoke others to sin
in the like, and set a flat back of brass against Repentance, and this
Christian examination; they seem to renew the decayed colors of their old
sin, with the fresh sent of their second pleasure therein: But alas, what
pleasure have they in those things whereof they have no profit? What profit
have they of those things, whereof they should be ashamed? neither in this
straint can we forget the madness of them, who may seem to step one degree
further toward this examination of sin, than did the former, by thinking
that the leaving of sin, and the repenting of sin is all one: against these,
both daily experience, and the word of God does sufficiently declare. Joseph's
brethren, (Jacobs sons,) who devised evil against their brother, put him into
the pit, and sold him to strangers, did cease from this cruelty; but yet
are not read to have remembered their sin with any remorse; until 13. years
after this sin was committed, as we may see in the process of the history:
David had left his sins of murder and adultery, as thinking all quitte, and
well the space of a whole year: After which time, being admonished of the
Prophet Nathan, he repented of it: and experience has tried in many that have
had some-working of God in them, that though they left their sins many years
ago, yet because they repented not truly for them, they have rebounded upon
them with terrible sightes, and fearful visions to humble them, and to bring
them to a serious examination of them, being done and left long since.
Examples whereof, we need not fetch from far, seeing so many Preachers as ar
acquainted with fearful spirits, will give us witness hereof: the fruit of
which amazed minds for sins, already is ours, to beware of sins that are to
come; and that other men's harms may teach us blessed wisdom. Let us labor
not only to leave sin, which one may do for profit, for fear, for praise,
or for wearisomnes; but also to repent of it for Conscience sake. This
examination of our sins past, must be partly of those which we committed
before, and partly of those we have done after our calling: every man,
especially having his reason reformed by the word of God, will grant an
examination of the life, before our true knowledge of God in Christ, to be most
needful: but it may be thought, we need not to be so precise in the searching
of those sins which were after our knowledge: but seeing of al other, those
sins bite the sorest, and pearce deepest, for that they are aggrauated with
all the mercies of God going before* and sin is then most sinful, when after
we know the truth; after we have been delivered from sin; after we have
been enlightened with the good grace of God, we have fallen into it. I think
that examination most especially is to be had of these sins: wherefore, to
iterate our former examples in a new matter, as we may see the former kind of
examining: first, from sins before our calling, in the sons of Jacob: so we
have a pattern of the latter in the practice of the Prophet David, who at the
hearing of his sin was so troubled in his spirit, that he could not rest: in
the Prophets speech, telling him his sin was forgiven him, but still was
disquieted as one utterly forsaken of God, and as though he could find no
comfort of Gods spirit in him: For, as it fares often in sores, so also it
comes to pass in sins, we are loath to have our wounds often grated on,
we cannot so well away to have our sores rifeled, seared, lanced, but fed
with healing salues: so we are hardly brought to have our Consciences seared,
or our sins ransacked, sifted and ripped: but could still have them
plastered with sweet promises, and bathed in the mercies of God: whereas it is
far safer, before incarnatiue and healing medicines, to use corasiue and
mundifying waters: without which, though our sores may seem to close and
skin up apace, yet they prove worse, and being rotten still at the core, they
have above a thin skin, and underneath dead flesh: In like manner we would
cloak, we would hide and cover our sins as it were with a curtain: but it is
more sound Surgery, to prick and parch our conscience with the burning iron
of the law, and to cleanse the wound of the soul, by sharp threatening; lest
that a skin pulled over the conscience for a while, we do lament the rotten
corruption, which remains uncured underneath: and so we be constrained to
cry out, that our sins opens. As it is a folly then to dissemble our sores
whilst they be curable, and after to make them known when they be incurable.
So it is as great folly, to dissemble our sins whilst they may be remedied,
and so after be constrained with shame for to blaze them abroad, when they are
vnremediable. But of this by the way, because we shall more largely touch it in
the part to come: It is sufficient to commit sin before knowledge, but after
knowledge to sin, breeds either hardness of heart, or a troubled heart;
both which we shall avoid, if in truth we be careful to watch our
affections, and beware after our deliverie, we fall not into sin again.
Several men, subject to several sins, have their several cloggs in their
consciences: some are overcome with wrath, and yet after the moodie sit, they
can tell that the wrath of a man does accomplish the righteousness of God: Some
are subject to lust, and afterward they say, it profits them nothing: some
are given to a continual course of vanity, whom notwithstanding can say,
that man's life has another end: Some sleeping deep into worldliness, and yet
they be often wakened with terrible checks of Conscience: well, blessed are
they, whose hearts are truly grieved with sin: and let them beware that
make a daliance with sin: for either hardness of heart will overtake them,
or a troubled Conscience will confound them: Wherefore, it oftentimes comes
to pass, that many spending of their bodies on lust, do lament that ever they
so abused their strength; many given too much unto the pleasures of this life,
have great grief and sorrow coming upon them, to remember how they have
misspent Gods graces, lauished his good gifts, and misspent their time: or
else, if they have not this grief, they fall into voluptuousness, and draw
such a thick skin upon their hearts, as will cause the most strongest
denouncing of Gods just judgments to redownd, be they driven on never so
hard: And sure it is the sin of this world, when men being controwled in
their own hearts and Consciences; and that whilst they are a praying, do
feel a secreete charge laid against them, to make them to beware of falshoode
in bying and selling: for, either they have these checks less and less, and
so they grow too profane; or else, afterward they are woonderfullie wounded,
that they have been so worldly, so greedily pursuing earthly things, and so
coldly purchasing heavenly things: thus even our privy thoghts not profited
by, are breeders of farther trouble. Now the remedy against this trouble, is
willingly and wittingly not to cheerish sin, to wish that the minister should
touch our most privy and secreet sins; to be glad privatlie to be
admonished, to profit by our enemies when they do reproach us; rather to desire
in such a cause to be humbled, than to suffer our selves to be flattered: This
trying of our selves must yet stretche it self further, not only to the
committing of evil, but to the omitting of good: as when after some good
working and feeling of the spirit, we begin to fight and conflict with our
own consciences, saying: though I must pray, I must have time also to provide
for my Family: If I go to hear the word, surely I shall be in danger to lose
this profit: If I thus attend upon this exercise of Religion, I shall be cut
short of the use of my pleasures. Wherefore, it shall be good to search our
hearts, both in the careless not using the means, saying to our selves in this
manner. I have heard a Sermon, but alas! without any feeling or working of my
afflictions: I have been praying, but with no power of the spirit: I have
received the Sacraments, but without those joys glorious and unspeakable which
I was wont to taste of: I saw the Discipline of the Church executed, but
without any fear of sin in my self, or compassion of the members censured:
And here I dare for my own observation, assuredly affirm, that outward
sins have not been sometimes so grievous to Gods children; as that they have
sometimes used the means with little reverence, and with less fruit: and no
marvel, for we shall see, that many men are sometime not so much grieved for
their sickness it self, as for that they have, either willingly neglected
the means, which might have preserved their health; or they have abused the
Physic, which might have restored their health to them again. In like manner
I say it fares with them, who either vnreverently have refused the means
which should keep their souls from forgetting: or else unthankfully have abused
those helps, which might have recovered them again. From hence it comes,
that some men are as much grieved, for not using their good gifts to the
benefit of Gods Church, as others are troubled for pestering of the Church
with unprofitable corruptions: As we shall see a rich man sometimes as much
humbled for not giving money to the poor, which he might have done: As for
heaping up riches falsely, which he ought not to have done. And thus many
having received good gifts and graces from the Lord, are received and
sanctified by affliction, whereby they are taught to put their gifts in ure,
and to offer their service unto Christ: and others are feared to hide their
gifts; who cannot be without some decay of Gods glory, without any offense to
the weak, without the loss of many saints, which otherwise might be woone to
the Gospel; and without the strengthening the hand of the adversary, to
slander our dumb and dark profession: all which things, will in the end bring
terror of mind; because, if the Lord cannot work upon us, by taking away
goods, friends, credit, wife, children, or such like, to bring us to
repentance; he will surely whip our naked consciences, he will enter even into
our very entralls, and pearce our secreete bowels: As we must examine our souls
thus for sins past, and sins present; so must we loose this practice in
sins to come, and this is very needful, for were it that our life were
such, as neither before nor after our callings, men might justly accuse it; yet
the hidden corruptions of nature, may threaten some heinous downfall in time to
come; which has made men of very good report and conversation, to hang down
their heads, and fear their secreet hypocrisy, as that which may break
faith, to the shame of all the former in time to come: But because we forget to
speak of them, that in the examining of their lives past, were much grieved for
the want of sincerity, and privy vain glory in themselves: Let us before we
go to the searching of our heart in sin, to come to speak somewhat of this,
men traveling for this privy pride are either touched or not touched. If the
vale of sin was so great in them, that it hid Christ from them; it is the
good will of God, that by this sight of the most secreet sins, they should
come to see that righteousness that is in Christ Jesus, and so they shall the
better be kept from being justiciary Pharisees; for being a long time well
brought up, and leading a civil life, the devil would persuade us of some
inherent righteousness in us: It is the wisdom of our God to touch us with the
conscience of most hidden corruptions, as also to terrisie and make known unto
us, that even from our birth, there was ever secreet seed of sin in us, which
without the Lord watching over us, would surely have broken forth to his
dishonor: As for them that have had some working in them, and yet are often
plagued with sore diseases: this trouble comes to them for two special
causes, either for some hypocrisy, that they did more in show than in truth:
wherefore, the Lord brings them back again, to see their corrupt
proceeding; and that they may know all their Religion to be but hypocrisy,
all their righteousness to be unrighteousness: or for the abusing of their
knowledge, in that they made it but a mask to jugle in, and that they made
their affections to fight with their dreamy judgment: we must remedy this, by
not thinking of our selves above that which is meet, and by laboring to embrace
the truth in truth: And here let us note, that many of Gods children accuse
themselves of hypocrisy, when indeed they offend not in it; for the most
righteous persons are their own greatest accusers; and yet that accusation
does justly arise of some fault of their parts: for though they have done
things in truth; yet because with truth, they labored not to see their
secreet corruptions; in some other matters, they sustain this trouble of
mind; so that there is nothing harder, than to sift and search our hearts to
the bottom: whether we respect our sins past, or our sins present; whether
we look to our privy pride, hidden wants, or secreet corruptions: and to
return from whence we were digressed, to the examining of our hearts in sin to
come; Let us observe, that in Gods Children, there is such a jealosie, as they
tremble at the first motions, and quake at the least occasion of sin: although
because vice will sit in residence very near unto virtue; there may be sometime
in them too much scrupulousnes: this fear causes the dearest Saints of God
to reason in this sort: O Lord, I see how many excellent in gifts and
beginnings, whose death were not like to their lives: This is true, whether we
look into the word, or into the world: and it is a thing that may much humble
us: For though we may remember what we have been, and know what we are; yet
who can tell what may come to him hereafter: Oh that the serious meditation
hereof, would dwell longer upon our Consciences, that with an holy jealousy,
we might prevent the sin that is to come: But alas, there be some venturous
Knights, which think it no masterie to offer themselves to masking,
minstrilsie, and dancing: nor to run into quarrels, brawles, and
contentions: as though they had their eyes, their ears, their hands, and their
feet in their own power, at commandment to use as they list: howbeit, Gods
children better fenced with grace, than those bold buzards ar afraid of these
occasions; as knowing that their eyes may soon be provoked to lust; their
ears may quickly listen to unchaste delights; their hands may suddenly strike
a dead blow; their feet may easily be snared in carnal pleasures: Beware O
man, be circumspect O woman; that thou prosecute not thy self to so much
liberty: for though in coming to such lascivious or contentious places, thou
did purpose none evil; yet for thy ventering without warrant, thou may be
over the shoes in sin, and plunged in some wicked attempt, over head and
ears ere thou be aware, and yet because vice is so consine unto virtue. Beware
also of suppression, for still the enemy labors, either to make thee too
hardy in sin; or else he will cause thee to be too fearful, and
superstitious; either he will puff thee up with presumption, or assault thee
with desperation: to these temptations our nature is very pliable. First, to
presumption, as may appear by our common speeches: Tush, the Preacher is but a
man as I am; I am sure he has infirmities as others have: we are no Angels,
our nature is corrupt, we are but men: I am sure he would not have us Gods:
Thus the Devil comes to tempt them; but he apparelleth himself in an other
suite, when he comes to accuse; and then of a fly, he makes an Elephant;
of a prick of a pin, a globe of the whole earth; of a mouldhill, a mountain:
and presses silly souls with fears and terrors, that they know not how to
wind themselves: If he can bring them to make no conscience, where they should
make conscience: he will labor to bring them to make conscience, where they
should make no conscience: he cares not whether ye will be remiss or
superstitious, so ye will be one of them: If he cannot get you to follow the
Epicure sin of the world, as Libertines in diet and apparel, he will make you
so precise, as to think it an heinous sin to eat one bitte of meat, or to
wear one ragge of cloth more than for necessity. How needful therefore, it
is to sail with an even course: we may conjecture by other things, which will
bewray the corruption of our nature: In the time of a plague, we shall see some
so bold, that without any lawful calling or godly warrant, they will rush
into places infected, and then falling sick, their conscience pricks them for
their tempting of God, by an unadvised boldness in the hour of their death;
others plunged as deeply in a contrary extremity, are too fearful, when they
do but hear of the sickness, and for very fear have been brought to deaths
door, by imagining themselves to have bin infected, when they have bin most
free, who often having even dyed without any natural cause, that ever could be
known, but only through an immoderate fear, and the judgment of God coming
upon them for their infidelity and unbelief. Thus it is with us in our
extremity, in that as well the oppressing of our selves with too much fear to
be overcome, as the carnal security in not fearing to be overcome, may bring
sin upon us: Gods children must labor for a measure, and that must be sought
for in the word, which will teach them, how they shall neither decline on the
right hand, nor on the left; but will guide them in the narrow way; showing in
every thing what is the virtue, and what is the vice; what is the mean, and
what is the extreme: among many examples let us consider, zeal a most
precious virtue in christianity, so long as it is free from the extreamities:
otherwise, if we be cold in zeal, it is a sin on the left hand; if we be
zealous without knowledge, it is preposterous, and becomes a sin on the right
hand: but cannot we come to some perfection? No, if ye understand it for an
absolute vnspottednes; albeit, to that perfection, which the scriptures take
for soundnes, truth and sincerity of heart, which is void of careless
remission, we may come: neither does the Lord deal with us after our sins,
nor reward us after our iniquities; in whose eyes, the most glorious actions
of man, are but as waters flowing purely from the conduit, but defiled by
passing through a filthy channel. Wherefore, though we have our imperfections,
let us not seek to be more righteous than we can be, saying for every error
of this life, Oh, I am none of Gods sons, I am none of his daughters: for I
cannot find that perfection which is to be required: but let us comfort our
selves in the truth of our hearts, and singlenes of our desires to serve God,
because he is God, and so we shall be accepted of God. I speak this to this end,
that poor souls might hear comfort, and know, that if they abhor sin as
sin, if they examine themselves for it, if they groan under it, if they
mislike themselves for it, if they fear to fall into it, the Lord will not
pursue them with the rigor of the Law, but will give to them the sweetness of
his promises, they are noe more under the curse, but under grace: but farther
to enforce our exhortation, to avoid too scrupulous, a fear which hinders
the true examination of our hearts: Let us think, that it happens in the
spiritual conflict, as in civil wars: We read, that many Cities lying in
great security, have suddenly, been both assaulted and overthrown: and also
how some Cuntries, too much negligent in the wars, through an excessive
fearfulnes, have encouraged their enemies with more gredie violence to pray
upon them: with which kind of stratagems, our adversary the Devil being
well acquainted with, often practices this policy, if he sees us without
all fear, too quietly to rest in our selves, he thinks his assault must
needs be the stronger, because our assistance is the weaker: Again, if he
discrieth in us a cowardly fear and fainting of heart, before we once begin
to join battle with him, he will set upon our moderate fear, and as
villanouslie as suddenly, stabbe us to the heart, and make a present spoil of
us: common practice does further teach us, that when we can hear the word
without all trembling at Gods judgments; when we can pray without all fear
before the Majesty of God; when we can come to the Discipline of the Church,
without al reverence of the ordinance of the Lord, al in vain. Again, let us
hear with too much trembling, and we shall learn nothing; let us pray with
too servile a fear, and our woorshipping of God, will be without all comfort,
vncheerful. Thus if we neither lessen sin, that is indeed; neither make sin of
that which is not sin in truth; it is good to proceed to this threefold
examination, and to lay the edge of this doctrine more near our afflictions,
because many will be found in this ripenes of knowledge, and barrannes of
conscience, to speak and dispute of all these things very skilfully, which
flickring, in the circumference of the brain, and not settling at the heart, do
seal up a more just sentence of condemnation against them: To help this evil
with, we must meditate deeply upon the law and Gospel, together, with the
appertenances of them both; that finding our selves far from Gods blessing, and
seeing our selves near to the curses due unto the breakers of the law, we may
raise up some sense of sin in our selves: yet herein we must not stay, but go
forward: for whereas many by the diligent view of the law, have come to the
sense of sin in themselves, and saw their own condemnation: yet because they
labored not to see their guiltiness acquitted, by the remission of sin in
Christ; they plunged in a bottomless sea of sorrows: others having passed those
degrees, and hitherto made these steps to avoid the wound of Conscience, have
come short of the mark; who, besides the sense of sins pardoned by the death
of Christ, felt not the virtue of his passion crucifying sin in them, but saw,
that with remission of sins was not joined mortification of sin; feared that
there was no forgiveness for them, but still languishing with sorrow, they
thought their souls to stand charged with their former guiltiness; yea, and
which more is, for that such men have not truly bin instructed, nor surely have
been grounded in the doctrine of Christ his death and resurrection: that is,
for that they saw not as well power flowing from his death to sley sin in
them, as virtue to pardone sin in them; for that they felt not as well strength
unto sanctification, striving from the rising again of Christ, as they were
persuaded of justification and righteousness therein: They have lain still
bleeding at the heart, in such sort, that the wound of grief could hardly or
never be stopped and stanched: wherefore, let us strengthen our weak souls
with this sevenfold coard of consolation, against these bitter assaults: let us
first labor to know sin, then to sorrow for sin, after to feel our sins
in Christ forgiven; farther to look for power to crucify the same, then to
lay hold on Justification, by his Resurrection; and lastly, hope for strength,
to proceed from thence to further us in sanctification, and holiness of life
even unto the end. And thus much briefly for that second thing which we matched
in company with the examination of sin, even unto the trial of faith; both
which rightly used, shall in some measure fafegarde us from the trouble of
afflicted minds. Now let us hasten to the third part of our division, to show
how Gods children being fallen into this wound of spirit may be helped out of
it: which God willing we also will perform; after we have answered a necessary
objection, which in this former part might seem to encounter against us: There
is no man but will grant, that David, Jacob, and others of the saints of God,
had a sight of their sins, a sorrow for their sins, a taste of their
remission of sin: and yet how comes it to pass, that these men were so
trobled in mind. To this I answer, that their trouble so befell them, either for
failing in some of those former things, or else they were rather afflicted for
the trial of their faith, than for the persecuting of sin in them; and
therefore be it always provided, that we think not every conflict of
conscience, continually and chiefly to be for the pursuing of our sins, but
sometime and principally for the scoring of sin, as we may see in Job,
whereupon, let all men be admonished, when as they see good men thus humbled in
mind, to lay their hands on their mouths from saying: Surely, these men are
but Hypocrites, doubtless these men be great sinners, the Lord has found out
their iniquity, the Lord has discovered their hypocrisy; for good reason
there is, that such silence should be used: for that the Lord may as well make
trial of their faith, as take punishment on their sins: for if such
afflictions should always and chiefly be sent for sin, then it should
follow, that all others, as they exceeded them in sin, should also exceed
them in that punishment of sin: but now coming to the salving of this sore,
I shall seem very strange in my cure, and so much the more to be wondered at, by
how much in manner of proceeding I differ from the most sort of men herein; I
am not ignorant, that many visiting of afflicted consciences, cry still, Oh!
comfort them, oh! speak joyful things unto them: yea there be some, and that
of the learned, who in such cases are full of those and such like speeches: Why
are you so heavy my brother, why are you so cast down my sister, be of good
cheer, take it not so grievouslie, what is there that you should fear? God is
merciful, Christ is a Savior; these be speeches of love indeed: but they
often do the poor souls as much good herein, as if they should power cold
water in their bosoms, when as without farther searching of their sores, they
may as well minister a malady as a medicine: For as all nutriture and carnal
medecines are not good for every sick person, especially, when the body
needs a strong purgation, then to minister matter restoratiue: And as all
incarnatiue medicines may for a time stay the pain of the patient, but
afterward the grief becomes more grievous: So comfortable applying of Gods
promises, are not so profitable for every one that is humbled; especially, when
their souls are rather to be cast farther down, than as yet to be raised up:
so, the sugered consolations, may for a while over heal the Conscience, and
abate some present grief: but so as afterward the smart may be the sorer, and
the grief may grow the greater. Hereof ensues this effect, that comfort
seems to cure for a while: but for the want of wisdom, in the right
discovering of the cause, men minister one medicine for another; and so for
want of skill, the latter fit grindeth them sorer than the former. Some there
are, that without all precepts and practice, will be their own Physicians; and
these, so soon as the fit comes upon them, think it best to chastise and
chase away their sorrow, by drinking at Tavernes, by minstrilsie, in merry
companies, by purgeing melancholies, in taking physic: all which, may seem to
wear away the pains for a while; but yet after it biteth more deeply; when
the burning fever of their spirits shakes them with the second recourse: and
for that they were not before truly searched, purged, seared and launced; it
comes to pass, that the second relapse is the more dangerous. To come to our
purpose, we must know that all griefs are either confused or distinct, and
sure it is, that the mind is appalled, either for some cause known to us as
certain, or for something unknown to us, and uncertain to them which are
troubled with such blind griefs; whereof they can see no reason. As often it
happens to Gods children in secreet election, who either never know God, or
else had but a general knowledge of him. I answer, that as I deny not physic
to be ministered, if in any part it proceed of a natural cause, so I require
the word especially, to show the principal and original cause to begin in
the soul: I do the rather, because I would have wisdom both in the
considering the state of the body if need so require, and in looking chiefly
to the soul, which few think on: If a man troubled in Conscience, come to a
Minister, it may be, he will look all to the soul, and nothing to the body:
If he come to a Physician, he only considers of the body, and neglects
the soul: For my part, I would neither have the Physicians counsel severed*
nor the Ministers labor neglected: because the soul and body dwelling
together, it is convenient, that as the soul should be cured by the word, by
prayer, by fasting, by threatening, or by comforting: so the body should be
brought into some temperature by physic, by purging, by diet, by restoring, by
music, and such other like means: provided always, that it be done so in the
fear of God, and wisdom of his spirit; as we think not by these ordinary
means, to smother and smoke out our troble, but as purposing to use them as
preparatiues; whereby both our souls and bodies may be made more capable of the
spiritual means to follow after: As we require these things to be the
matters of our ministry in such a perplexity; so we would wish the persons
ministering, to be men learned, and of sound judgment; wise, and of godly
experience; meek, and of most loving spirits: for when the troubled patient
shall be well persuaded of our knowledge and discretion; and therewithal shall
perceive us to come in loving and tender affection: I think an entrance is
made, and all prejudice taken away, so as we may more freely work upon that
conscience: First, bring them to the sight of sin, as to some cause of their
trouble, wherein we must labor to put away al confusion and blindness of
sorrow by wisdom; to bring the parties wounded to some certain object and
matter of their troble, and so draw out of them the confession of some special
secreet and several sins: I say secreete and several sins, because I
know, how that many through a palpable blindenes, or disordered discerning of
sin, talk nothing so much as of sin, and yet either they cannot descrie
several sins, or they will not be brought to acknowledge their secreet sins:
whereof the one proceeds of the ignorance of the Law of God, the other of
selfeloue; which makes us loath, even in our travel of mind to shame our
selves: Now, that confession of particular sins is requisite, it may appear by
the 32. Psalm, wherein being a Psalm of instruction, concerning the
forgiveness of sins: the Prophet by his own experience teaches us, that he
could find no relief of his sickness, until he had remembered and made
confession of his sins: What shall we think of the Prophet of God, which
taught so wonderfully by the word and by the spirit, and did not see his sins
before: be it far from us, rather let us, know, that he had not severally and
particularly ripped up his sins before the Lord, in a several confessing
of them, which though the Lord knows far better than we our selves, yet
such kind of sacrifice is more acceptable to him. Now, in this trouble, the
persons humbled cannot come to this particular sight of sin in themselves: It
is good to use the help of others, to whom they may offer their hearts to be
gaged and searched; and their lives to be examined more deeply, by hearing the
several articles of the Law, laid open before them: whereby, they may square
the whole course of their actions. For as we said before, the grossest
hypocrite will generally complain of sin; and yet deal with them in
particular points of the particular precepts, and prove them in the applying
of things to be done or undone to them, to their own conscience; and we shall
see many of these poor souls tossed to and fore; now fleeting in joys, now
plunged in sorrows, not able to distinguish one sin from another. Now, when we
shall see the wound of the spirit, to arise of any certain and known sin:
it is either for some sin already committed wherein we lie, or else for some
sin yet not committed, but whereunto we are tempted. For the former, it
pleased God often to bring old sins to mind, when we have not thoroughly
repented of them before, so as it now representing them to us a fresh, we may
fall into a more misliking of them; and yet herein is not al, to mislike our
selves for some particulars, although it be good to be occupied about some
special sin: for, as it is not sufficient for the avoiding of hypocrisy, to
see sin generally: so it is not enough to eschew the damnablenes of the heart,
ever to be purring in every particular, and to be forgetful of the great and
general sins: and let us learn by the particulars to pass to the
generals. When any such one sin does pursue the rest, not only therein, but
say thus rather unto thy self; O Lord, is this our sin so grievous, and does
my God punish this one so sorely? how great should be my punishment, if thou
should (O Lord) so deal with me for all my other sins? Let us labor to
have a sense, both of particular and general sins, lest in time our grief
pass away without any fruit, whilst, that not being displeased with one
sin, as well as with another, we either look to such specially and generally.
Concerning those sins whereunto we are tempted, as when a man is noted to think
blasphemouslie of God the Father, or to doubt whether there is a Christ or no,
or to imagine groslie of the holy Ghost, or to deny God, or to doubt of the
Trinity, or to be moved to adultery, or such like. In all which temptations,
he feels the spirit, often checking him for them; so as he knows not in this
case what to do; that on the one side he dares not listen willingly to such
fearful and monstrous temptations: and on the other side, he fears, lest
then by long suit, he might fall into them: or at least, for that he sees not
how to be delivered from them. I suppose, these motions are not so much to be
disputed with, as we by them are to be provoked to a more instant and
extraordinary zeal of prayer: Surely, these are dangerous temptations, and
therefore are not to be kept close with our nature, which easily will incline
unto, but particularly are to be confessed of us: for the Devil will come
sometimes to thee, to keep thee still in a general acknowledging of sin, and
urge thee on this manner: Surely, thou must do this sin, thou see thou
can have no ease until thou have consented, thou art ordained to it, the
reason why thou art tempted, is because thou do not thus take thy pleasure,
go to deny God, believe not his word, it is but a policy to keep men in awe,
Religion is no such matter as men make it: Thus, for fear of yielding of the
one hand, and for shame of disclosing temptations on the other hand, many men
have pyned away, and almost have been overcome by them: If we should disclose
this, says these men, what would people say of us? they would count us
Atheists, they would think us the wickedst men in the world: Well, for
instructions and consolations, let us learn herein, that these kind of
temptations, are either corrections for some sins past, or punishment for
some sin present, or forwarner of some sins to come: We shall see many
tempted to adultery, who no doubt, can not be brought to commit it: and
because they repented not of it, it came to them again, that in their youth
they have committed it: the like may be observed in these, gluttony, and in
other temptations, which are not so much seen to us presently to overcome us;
as to put us in mind, that sometimes heretofore, we having been overcome with
them, should now repent for them: Sometimes a man shall ly in some sins, whereof,
when he will not be admonished, neither by the public and private means, even
then some other strange temptation shall fall upon him, differing from that
wherein he presently lies, to admonish him of that other sin. As when a
worldling shall be tempted to adultery, a thing which he has no desire to
do: yet it is to make him to look to his worldlines; when he has so strong
and so through a liking, whereat, if he will not be awaked, he may suddenly fall
into that to; and so by the punishment of God, in punishing one sin with
another; both his sins unto his shame shall be laid open, and one sin shall
make known another. Sometime also it comes to pass, that one shall be
tempted with such a sin, as neither heretofore nor presently he has given
any liking or intertainement unto; and yet the Lord by it may forewarne him,
how he may fall into it hereafter; as also to show, that he has stood all
his former life rather by the grace of God, than by the strength of flesh and
blood: Wherefore, when thou art moved to doubt of God, of Christ, of the word,
of justification; do not so much stand wondering at these strange temptations,
as think with thy self, that it is the mercy of God by them, to cause thee
better to discern of those temptations in others. When thou shall have
observed with fear and trembling, how they may make their first entire into a
man's heart, how they gather strength, how they agree with our corrupt nature,
in what degrees they come unto some growth, how the spirit of God does resist
them, what be the means best to prevail against them: and thus if thou make
thy profit by them, thou shall so wonderfully search and descrie by several
veins, the body, age, and strength of these temptations in others, by an holy
experience which God has taught thee in others; that besides that, thou shall
lay forth men's secreete corruptions, as if thou were in their bosoms, thou
shall be able by the seed of sorrow in thy self, to beget an unspeakable joy
in others: who in time may be tempted, as thou now art. Thus moreover and
besides, that such is the efficacy of sin, that they who now are no
Papists, Heretics, Adulterers or Thieves, may for their secure contemning and
foolish passing over of these temptations sent unto them suddenly, shortly
after fall into them: because they would not seem to make some use of them,
nor confess before the Lord, both their pronenes and worthiness to fall into
them: But if we will humble our selves in such temptations, and learn by them,
meekly to discern the corruptions of our heart, we shall not only deliver our
selves presently from peril; but be further enabled to assist others hereafter
in the like danger: but some will oppose against these things which we have
delivered. Do you think it is a remedy, to cast down them that are already
humbled, this is rather to be a butcher than a builder of a man's conscience? to
whom I answer, that I desire Preachers to be builders, and not butchers: and
it is a thing generally to apply, and another thing particularly to lay the
medicine unto the wound: It is good to begin the sore by the viniger of the
Law, and after to supply it with the oil of the Gospel; both which must be
done in wisdom, using them to some in greter, to some in lesser measure: For,
as some having nothing but a decay of nature, and no natural humor need
rather restoratiue than purging medicines: so rather some troubled for some
spiritual wants, than for gross sins, need not so much the sharp
threatenings of the Law, as the sweet promises of the Gospel: But if the body
through some extraordinary repletion, has gotten some great surfeit, not so
much to the weakening of nature, as to the thretning of imminent death: and
therefore, does rather require some strong purgation, than comfortable and
cordial medicines. Then the soul brought to deaths door with extraordinary
sin, is rather to be boared and pierced, with the denounce of God his
judgment than otherwise: but because we would deal more plainly, and less
confusedly, it is good in our access to an afflicted conscience, to lay these
two grounds: First, we must persuade the parties humbled, that their sins are
pardonable, and their sores curable: and after, that this visitation is not so
much a sign of Gods wrath and anger, as a seal of Gods mercy and favor: in
that it is not either blind or barren, but plentiful in good effects, and
fruitful also in godly Issue: This sorrow, how needful it is, the experience
of so many (almost) as have been thrown down, is a sufficient witness, who
have had this, as a tagge tied to their temptations, that never any were so
plunged as they, none ever had the like temptations: the Lord will surely make
an end of them in some strange and unknown temptation, wherein they are not
unlike to men fallen into some dangerous disease, who thinking to be without
the fadome of Physicians skill, and not to be within the compass of things
recoverable, do add a second and sorer grief to their former: wherefore, as
these men seem to be half healed; when any man of knowledge can be brought,
who by experience has cured the like malady in like degrees in others, so then
the sorrowful souls are not a little by hope refreshed and strengthened, for
to look for some ease, when they can see no other temptations to have
overtaken them: then such as having fallen into the nature of man, have found
mercy at the hands of God, that he might be feared. This ground work framed,
is good to build up and repair the decayed joy of the mind; partly by the
Law, to make a preparatiue for those joys: If the mind not truly humbled, is
not fit truly to be comforted, and namely by the Gospel: if the Conscience
kindly thrown down, is become a fit subject to apply the sweet promises of
God in Jesus Christ unto it. And here again, to answer you that deny the Law
wholly or not at all to be used, when we would breed comfort in one. I
demand, whether it being necessary to mantaine the righteousness of Christ, it
be not also as necessary to maintain the righteousness of the Law: seeing
the righteousness of the Law of us not fulfilled, will drive us to the
righteousness of Christ, to us imputed; which is never thoroughly and truly
esteemed, until we see the righteousness of the Law, of us to be unperformed.
Again, if our Savior Christ did foreshew his Disciples, that the first work
of the holy Ghost at his coming, should convince the world of sin: to make
men know, that without Jesus Christ, there is nothing but sin: and then that he
should rebuke the world of righteousness, that they might see, how Christ died
not for his own sin, but for the sin of others. I see not why it should
not be very conveniient, first to lay open the righteousness of the Law, that
men may see their sin; and then the righteousness of Christ, that men may see
their sin discharged in him: besides, where the Lord says by his Prophet: At
what time soever a sinner does repent him of his sin, from the bottom of his
heart, I will put all his sin out of my remembrance. It may well be
gathered, that there must a sound sorrow for sin go before, and then the
true joy of sin pardoned, may the more freely, by virtue of this promise, be
both hoped for, and looked for afterward. Moreover, seeing the whole promises
of God in the Gospel, are commended to us under the title and tenor of
restoring sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, strength to the lame, health
to the sick, and life to the dead: It is manifest, not only that there is no
disease of the soul which Christ cannot heal; so also, that we must first
find our selves blind, deaf, dumb, lame, and dead; before he will meddle with
us: because they that are whole, never need the Physician: and he came to call
sinners, and not the righteous to repentance. Now, to do this in wisdom, by
neither pressing the conscience too severely; nor releasing the conscience more
vnadvisedlie: it shall be the safe way, to use the well tempered speech of the
Apostle to the Sorcerer, Repent, that if it be possible, thy sins may be
forgiven thee: where he does not wholly discourage him, because it may be, his
sin may be pardoned: neither yet too boldly to incorage him, in that without
repentance, he shows it altogether impossible to be pardoned: and that we
be not too preposterous in our consolation, let us be warned by that
blasphemous speech of that detestable Arian; who of late years was put to
death at Norwiche: this hellish heretic, a little before he should be
executed, afforded a few whorish tears: asked whether he might be saved in
Christ or no: when one told him, that if he repented he should surely not
perish: he breaks forth most monstrouslie unto this speech: Nay, is your
Christ so easily entreated as you say, then I defy him and care not for him:
Oh! how good a thing had it been, not to have cast this precious stone to this
swine: Oh! how safe had it been, to have dealt more bitterly and to have dealt
more vehemently upon the conscience of this Caitife. Now to attain some
discretion in curing of this wounded spirit, we learn wisely to judge of the
person afflicted, and of the nature of his affliction: First, we may note,
whether it be a man or a woman: because we may urge more carefully, the use of
the law to a man as being the stronger vessel: and as Satan knew her to be
most easy, and framable to be wrought upon at his first temptation, so he is
not ignorant, that she is the weaker party to sustain accusation; then let
us considder, whether they that are thus humbled have knowledge or no: because,
if they have no knowledge, then they think trouble of mind to be so strange a
thing, as never any before had it: If they have knowledge, then Satan is ready
to accuse them of the sin against the holy Ghost; as though every sin done
against knowledge were a sin of presumption: farther, we are to inquire how
strong or weak they are: that if they be surely stricken, we cease to humble
them any farther: If they be not sufficiently wounded, then to touch them with
some deep sense of sin: also, we must be circumspect to find out, whether by
nature they be more fearful and melancholic or no: as also, whether they be
usual sinners, or have fallen ever of infirmity; that so upon their
disposition and inclination, we may build our speeches the better: To these it
is good to add the consideration of the persons age, estate, and ability: as
if the party be troubled for worldlines; whether he be not a great householder:
If he complain of his estate; whether he be a young man and unmarried: If he
be humbled with covetousnes; whether he be not old, because diverse cuntries,
callings, ages, conditions, and estates of men, have their diverse and peculiar
sins; which we must rightly discern: howbeit of what sects, sorts, man or
woman; ^^ what complexion soever they are; of what knowledge to discern sin;
of what degree in committing sin; of what age, authority, wealth, estate, or
condition soever they are: It is good to mark, that there be many, who are more
tro^^led for the vexation and disquietnes of their mind being distempered,
than for the vileness and horriblenes of their ^^nne committed: who are wounded
more with fear of shame, with fear of being mad, or with the fear of
running out of their wits, than with the conscience of sin: which thing, if
we find in them, it is our part to travel with them; that they may make a
less matter of the outward shame, and more conscience of the inward sin;
neither must we herein forget to make a distinction between our speeches used
to the humbled, in the very time of their extreme agony, and burning ague of
their troubles; and those speeches which we use then, the fit being past;
because the former requires more consolation and less exhortation than the
other; and the latter would have us more abundant* in admonishing, and more
sparing in comforting, when we may wisely admonish them to beware of sin,
which so procures their own woe in this brething time. It is also expedient to
exhort them, that for some season, until they shall find greater power in
regeneration, they would tie themselves to some holy orders and godly vows:
that thereby, they either may be furthered in mortifying some special sin,
which for that they could find no power against it, did most grieve them, or
strenthened in some special grace, the want whereof, did also wound them: but
before we launch deep into the sea of particular temptations; and begin to
sound the dangerous passages of natural corruptions and original sin: the
troublesome froth whereof, does almost ouerwhelme many poor Pilgrims: It
shall be good to give this caution, that both in these, and in the former
trobles, men would be still admonished, patiently to bear with a wounded
spirit, albeit it falls out so, that they be somewhat pettish, seeing the
holy Ghost speaks so favorably of them: saying, a wounded spirit who can bear
it. And surely, our practice in other things, by the law of equity may urge
this at our hands: For if men by the light of reason, can see it to be a duty
convenient, not frivolouslie to travel; but meekly to suffer, and wisely to
put up unadvised speeches of a man, distempered in brain, by reason of some
burning ague, or other vehement sickness. We may easily gather even by this rule
of reason; not so severely to sensure the impatient speeches of him, who by
reason of some parching feavour of the spirit, is disquiered in mind; and has
all the veins of his heart (as it were) in a spiritual agony vexed:
wherefore, both unsavory of godly wisdom, and uncharitable for want of
Christian love, are their murmuring obtractations, which say, What is the godly
man? Is this he that is trobled for his sins? why see how pettish he is,
nothing can please him, no body can satisfy him. Consider O man, if thou can
bear with a frail body, that thou must much more bear with a fraill mind:
consider, that this his pettishnes does more wound him to the heart, than any
injury thou could pearce him with: and therefore, seeing he afflicts his
own soul for it, thou must not add any thing to his afflictions, and to
exasperate his smart: considder, that it is a blessed thing, mercifully to
bethink us of the state of the needy: and that to rub a fresh wound, and to
strain a bleeding sore, is nothing else, but that which Jobs friends did, to
bring a new torment where there is no need of it. If the wise Father, rather
does pity than rebuke his child, when by reason of sickness the appetite is
not easily pleased: so if we purpose to do any good with an afflicted mind,
we must not be austere in reprehending every infirmity; but patient in
considering of it, as tender frailty: neither do I speak this, to nourish
pettishnes in any, but would have them to labor for patience, and to seek for
peace: which though they find not at the first, yet by prayer they must wait
on the Lord; and say, Lord, because there is mercy with thee, that thou may
be feared: I will wait upon thee, as the eye of the servant waits upon the
eye of his master: I will condemn my self of folly, and say: O my soul, why
art thou so heavy, why art thou so cast down within me, still trust in the
Lord for he is thy help and thy salvation.

FINIS.
