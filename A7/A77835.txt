TO The READER.
Courteous Reader,
I Am not ignorant how that the Presses swell with subjects of this nature, and
though many worthy men have written in this kind, yet here I dare be bold to
say, thou shall be sure to find the quintessence of their writings, closed
within this cabinet of brevity: Let it therefore move thee to read, and try by
experience, what is therein contained, and thou shall find the pureness of
golden Truths, brought within the compass of a little room; which for thy
memory, being shorter, I hope will prove the better; the better to be carried
away, and the better to be kept, and the better to be called for, when thou
have use for them: what benefit therefore thou do reap from this short
Compendium, Give God the glory, and I am therefore fully satisfied in my
reward, and rest,

The least and unworthiest of the Churches Servants, Geo. Burches.
