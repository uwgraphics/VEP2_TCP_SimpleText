The Copy of a LETTER, Sent from the COMMISSIONERS OF The Church of Scotland to
the several Presbyteries and Provincial Assemblies in Scotland.
Reverend Brethren,
IN our Letter of the last of March to the Synod, which we suppose all of you
have seen and perused, we did acquaint you with our desires given in to the
honorable estates of Parliament, about that time, and since after some
Conferences had, and some Papers interchanged between their Lordships and us,
upon these desires whilst we had received no satisfaction theirto, they were
pleased to fall upon the consideration of the breaches of the Treaty and
Covenant, and have sent demand to the Parliament of England for reparation
therein, or of those demands concerning Religion, (having first voted the same,
before our advise was sought thereto) they did thereafter communicate unto us
that we might return our thoughts thereon. In answer to which, after some
insinnuations of their laying aside their former way of applycations both to
the King and Parliament of England, and of their encroaching upon the liberty
of the Kirk, by their taking resolution in that which concerns Religion
without us, and conceiving the demand, in case it should be refused, to be
intended as a ground of war, we delayed to give any judgment thereof, until
our former desires should be first satisfied, and withal entreating that they
would be pleased to communicate unto us their Resolutions upon the whole
matter, that we might see that all things were so carried on as would
contribute for securing of Religion, and preserving of the union between both
Kingdoms, and thereafter we did present unto their Lordships an humble and
earnest Petition, pressing their answer to our former desires, containing an
exonoration of our selves, and of the Kirk of Scotland, if they should refuse
to hearken thereunto, which their Lordships having considered, did after some
days communicate unto us, a Declaration containing the grounds and Resolutions
of the Parliament upon the whole matter, together with another Paper which
refers us unto the Declaration for satisfaction of our right desires,
containing likewise their Answer to the other particulars, which we added unto
our Petition, and in our Answer upon the demand concerning Religion, wherein
they intimate unto us, that in those things in their Declaration, which concern
Religion, they will be ready to hear and confider the advice of the
Commissioners of the Kirk, but after perusal of their Declaration and other
Papers, we are far from finding satisfaction to our first desires, or to the
other particulars afterward given in by us to their Lordships, which we have
already in part by a Paper of 25th. of March made known unto them, and we
resolve in a very short time, more fully to represent our minds unto their
Lordships, and now concerning the liberty of the Kirk to be very far
prejudiced by the Parliaments proceedings to determine in those things which so
nearly and highly concern Religion, without the advice and consent of the
Kirk (and many considerable Members of Parliament, who have been of constant
integrity in the Cause of God, disenting therefrom, and protesting against the
same, for the liberties of the Kirk) we found our selves necessitated to
protest for the preservation of the liberties of the Kirk, according to the
word of God, Solemn Covenant and former Laws, and laudable customs of this
Kirk and Kingdom, and that the act of Parliament be no preparative for the
future, and that it shall yet be free unto us according to the duty of our
places, and as there shall be cause to give our judgment in an Ecclesiastical
way of the matter of Religion, the said Declaration, so far as Religion is
therein concerned, as freely as if their Lordships had taken no resolutions
thereupon, but we hope in a short time to give you a more full and perfect
information of all these things by seeing the Papers themselves; and we should
now have been silent, were it not that we are not ignorant of the devises of
Malignant and evil affected men, who do endeavor nothing more diligently then
(if it be possible) by subtle words and fair speeches on the one side, and
slander and false reports on the other side, to gain some of the Ministry to
be subservant to their desings against the Kirk and Cause of God, knowing that
by this means especially it was that the liberty of this Kirk was betrayed and
the Ordinances of Christ corrupted.

These things we speak not as if we were afraid of any of you our dear
Brethren, we hope thatafter so many tears and temptations, so many prayers and
supplications, so great power of the Lords hand delivering us from so great a
yoke of bondage, and after so many vows and promises every Minister of Christ
throughout the Land, will abhor to be accessory to any thing that may promote
the purposes of those, who study to under-mine the work of God; nay these many
Letters to our selves, and supplications to the Parliament from many Synods and
Presbyters, as they are unto us a matter of much refreshing in the midst of
many difficulties and streights, wherewith God is pleased at this present to
exercise us, so we take them for Evidences of the steadfastness of those from
whom they have come; and albeit all have not had the opportunity to express
themselves that way, yet we make no question of their constancy, and that they
will be ready to witness their affection to the cause of God as they shall see
need, but as Fellow Laborers with you that are employed in the work of the
Lord; we give you warning of the danger, and stir you up to be earnest with
God in prayer and supplication, for your own steadfastness, so to give such
full and timous warning unto all with whom you have to do, against all the
snares and temptations of these times: And that you may now so carry your
selves in all things, that when the Lord shall be pleased to bring his servants
together in a general Assembly, all of them may come thither furnished with
the spirit of integrity, unity and zeal, that so the boasting of adversaries
may be put to silence, and their hopes blasted, when they shall see us to be of
one mind, and hear us speak the same thing, for carrying on the work of the
Gospel, and obviating every danger that threatens the same at home and from
abroad, which as we trust will be the endeavors of all Presbyteries, so it is
the earnest desire and prayer of

Your affectionate Brethren the Commissioners of the General Assembly.
EDINBURGH April 1648.
