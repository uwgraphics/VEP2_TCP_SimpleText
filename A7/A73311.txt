It Is not otherwise: OR: The praise of a married life.
To the tune of, I Will never love thee more.




A Young man lately did complain
because that he was wed:
And counseled others to abstain
from Hymeneal bed:
Had years but given him man-like thoughts,
he'ed not bin so unwise,
For wives increase man's happiness,
then It Is not otherwise.
What joy is there upon the earth
but Marriage makes it more,
It is to man a second birth.
and opens the door
To happiness, and such delight*
that none but they comprize:
They pleasures have both day and night,
then it is not otherwise.
When I was single I did stray
in heart, in words, and life,
But I have found a better way
I thank my loving wife:
I now live free from all suspect,
and many wicked lies,
The good I wished, has took effect,
then it is not otherwise.
Much company I used to keep,
before I had a wife,
The memory does make me weep,
for it was a wicked life:
Such comfort now at home I find,
from Marriage to arise,
I wish all men were in my mind,
then it is not otherwise.
Unthrifty games I now have left
as Tables, Cards and Dice,
That often has me of wealth bereft,
I curse no Ace, nor Sice:
I do not now the Cards bid burn,
that made my anger rise,
A wife has caused me to turn
then it is not otherwise
So civil I am grown of late
since that I made my choice,
I hate each swearing swaggering mate,
which makes me to rejoice:
The company I now do keep,
are honest men and wise,
That not with drink, but sense do sleep,
then it is not otherwise.
No Constable nor watch frare I,
that cries Who goes there?
I do not reele, but soberly
can pass them daid of care:
I use no candels in the morn,
I drink not out mine eyes,
My wife has made me these to scorn,
then it is not otherwise.
This diet makes me to forget
the headache that some have,
Which makes them for all things unfit,
(to drink I am no slave.)
Those men their virtue has out-worne,
that drink does so disguise,
My wife has made me this to scorn,
then it is not otherwise.
The second part.
To the same tune.




AGainst I from my labor come,
my wife prouides me meat:
When I was single none at home,
found I, or what to eat.
At sight of me she lays the cloth,
and then for me at she hies,
Which makes me to forget all floath,
then it is not otherwise.
If I seem discontent with ought,
she kindly prays me tell,
If that it may be begged or bought,
(or where it is to sell:)
That would me please, and merry make:
the tears stand in her eyes
Till I my discontent forsake:
then it is not otherwise.
It is a comfort for to see,
good women meek and mild,
That to her come in charity,
when that she is with child:
They comfort her if she do sound,
one for strong water hies,
And so their husbands healths drink round,
then it is not otherwise.
When that she does in childbed lie.
the neighbors in their love,
Will with her fit, and pleasantly
to mirth they do he move:
By christning of my little lad
I did in credit rise:
All this by my good wife I had,
then it is not otherwise.
For gossiping they send in meat,
would well serve forty men.
As good as any man can eat,
for mutton, pig, or hen;
They eat not half but leave it me,
there profit does arise:
This comes by a wife you see,
then it is not otherwise.
One gives a piece, and one a spoon^
unto my pretty child,
And wish that ere to morrow noone,
their cradles to be filled
With such a pretty child as this:
joy there to me does rise,
Had I no wife all this I miss,
then it is not otherwise.
The babe does grow, and quickly speak^,
this does increase my joy,
To hear it tattle, laugh, and squeak^,
I smile and hug the boy:
I with it play with great delight,
and hush it when it cries,
And ever wish it in my sight,
then it is not otherwise.
All Batchelors I wish you wed,
if merry you would live,
A single man is often mis^ed,
and seldom does he thrive:
I lived before, but better now,
my joy and wealth arise,
To live well I have shown you how,
the it is not otherwise.
