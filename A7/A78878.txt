His Majesty's Message sent to the House of Commons, concerning Licenses
granted by His Majesty to several persons to pass into Ireland.
HIs Majesty taking notice of a Speech, pretending in the Title, to have been
delivered by Mr Pym in a Conference, and printed by Order of the House of
Commons, in which it is affirmed, That since the stop upon the Ports against
all Irish Papists by both Houses, many of the chief Commanders, now in the head
of the Rebels, have been suffered to pass by His Majesty's immediate Warrant;
And being very certain of having used extreme Caution in the granting of
Passeports into Ireland; So that He conceives, either this Paper not to have
been so delivered and printed as it pretends, or this House to have received
some misinformation;

His Majesty would be resolved, whether this Speech were so delivered and
Printed; and if it were, would have this House to review upon what Informations
that particular was grounded, that either that may be found upon re-examination
to have been false, and both this House and His Majesty injured by it, or that
His Majesty may know by what means, and by whose fault, His Authority has
been so highly abused, as to be made to conduce to the assistance of that
Rebellion, which He so much detests and abhors, and that He may see Himself
fully vindicated from all reflections of the least suspicion of that kind.

The Answer of the House of Commons.
YOur Majesty's most loyal and faithful Subjects, the Commons now assembled
in Parliament, have taken into their serious Consideration the Message received
from your Majesty the seventh of this instant February, and do acknowledge
that the Speech therein mentioned to be delivered by Master Pym in a
Conference, was Printed by their Order, and that what was therein delivered,
was agreeable to the sense of the House. And touching that passage wherein it
is affirmed, That since the stop upon the Ports against all Irish Papists by
both Houses, many of the chief Commanders now in the head of the Rebels, have
been suffered to pass by your Majesty's immediate warrant, They present your
Majesty with this their humble Answer,

That they have received diverse advertisements, concerning the several
persons, Irish Papists and others, which have obtained your Majesty's immediate
Warrants for their passing into Ireland since the Order of Restraint of both
Houses; some of which (as they have been informed) since their coming into
Ireland, have joined with the Rebels and been Commanders amongst them, and some
others have been staid, and are yet in safe custody, particularly the Lord
Delvin, and four other persons in his company, whereof one is thought to be a
Priest: One Colonel Butler brother to the Lord Minyart now in Rebellion, and
Sir George Hamilton, all which are Papists: and one other (as is reported)
being son of the Lord Nettersfield, whose father and brother are both in
Rebellion. The particular names of others we have not yet received, but doubt
not but upon Examination they may be discovered.

And your Majesty's most Faithful Subjects are very sorry, That the extreme
Caution which your Majesty has used, has been so ill seconded, with the
diligence and faithfulness of your Ministers, and that your Royal Authority
should be so highly abused; Although, as it was expressed in that Speech by
Master Pym, we believe it was by the procurement of some evil Instruments too
near your Royal Person, without your Majesty's Knowledge and Intention. And we
beseech your Majesty to take such course, That not only your Honor may be
vindicated for the time passed, but your Kingdom may be secured from the like
mischief for the time to come.

His Majesty's Reply to the House of Commons Answer, Concerning Licenses
granted by the King to persons to go into Ireland.
AS His Majesty has expressed a great desire to give His House of Commons all
possible satisfaction to all their just Requests, and a readiness to rectify
or retract any thing done by Himself, which might seem to trench upon their
Privileges by any mistake of His, so He doubts not they will be ready upon all
occasions to manifest an equal tenderness and regard of His Majesty's Honor
and Reputation with His good Subjects* and therefore His Majesty expects they
should review His Message of the seventh of this Month, concerning a passage
in Master Pyms Speech, and their Answer sent to His Majesty by some of their
Members on the tenth of the same, with which His Majesty can by no means rest
satisfied.

His Majesty's Exception in that Message was, that it was affirmed in that
Speech, That since the stop upon the Ports against all Irish Papists, by both
Houses, many of the chief Commanders now in the head of the Rebels, have been
suffered to pass by His Majesty's immediate Warrant.

To this the Answer is:
THat the Speech mentioned in that Message to be delivered by Master Pym, was
Printed by their Order, and that what was therein delivered was agreeable to
the sense of the House: that they have received diverse Advertisements
concerning several persons, Irish Papists and others, who have obtained His
Majesty's immediate Warrant for their passing into Ireland, since the Order of
Restraint of both Houses, some of which, they have been informed, since their
coming into Ireland, have joined with the Rebels, and been Commanders amongst
them.

His Majesty is most assured, no such person has passed by His Warrant or
Privitie, and then he desires His House of Commons to consider, whether such a
general Information and Advertisement (in which there is not so much as the
name of any particular person mentioned) be ground enough for such a direct and
positive Affirmation, as is made in that Speech, which in respect of the place
and Person, and being now acknowledged to be agreeable to the sense of the
House, is of that authority that His Majesty may suffer in the Affections of
many of His good Subjects, and fall under a possible construction (considering
many scandalous pamphlets to such a purpose) of not being sensible enough of
that Rebellion, so horrid and odious to all Christians, by which, in this
distraction, such a danger might possibly ensue to His Majesty's Person and
Estate, as he is well assured His House of Commons will use their utmost
endeavors to prevent. And therefore His Majesty thinks it very necessary, and
expects that they name those persons, who by His Majesty's License have passed
into Ireland, and are now there in the head of the Rebels; Or that if upon
their re-examination they do not find particular Evidence to prove that
Assertion (as His Majesty is confident they never can) as this Affirmation
which may reflect upon His Majesty, is very public, so they will publish such
a Declaration whereby that mistake may be discovered, His Majesty being the
more tender in that particular, which has Reference to Ireland, as being most
assured that He has been, and is, from His Soul, resolved to discharge His
Duty (which God will require at His hands) for the belief of His poor
Protestant Subjects there, and the utter rooting out that Rebellion; So that
Service has not suffered any, but necessary delays by any act of His
Majesty's, for the want of any thing proposed to His Majesty, or within His
Majesty's power to do.

For the persons named in the Answer, His Majesty says that Colonel Butler,
and the son of the Lord Nettersfield, obtained His Warrants for their passage
into Ireland, at His Majesty's being in Scotland, which was long (as His
Majesty thinks) before the Order of both Houses: His Majesty knowing the
former of them to be one who has always made Professions to His Service, and
to be Uncle to the Earl of Ormond, of whose affection to the Protestant
Religion, and His Majesty's Service, His Majesty has great cause to be
assured? And the latter being a person of whom, at that time, there was no
suspicion to His Majesty's knowledge. For the other, it may be they have
obtained Warrants from His Majesty since the said Order; but His Majesty
assures the Parliament that He had no intimation of such an Order, till after
stay made of Sir George Hamilton, who was the last that had any License from
His Majesty to pass for Ireland

And His Majesty having since this Answer from the House of Commons used all
possible incans, by the examining His own Memory, and the Notes of His
Secretaries, to find what Warrants have been granted by Him, and to what
persons, does not find, That He has granted any to any Irish, but those who
are named by the House of Commons, and in December last to the Earl of Saint
Albans, and to two of his servants, and to one Walter Terrell a poor man, they
being such as His Majesty is assured are not with the Rebels, and much less
chief Commanders over them. And though it may be, the Persons named by the
House of Commons are Papists, yet His Majesty at that time thought it not fit,
in respect of their Alliance in that Kingdom, to such Persons of great power,
of whom His Majesty hoped well, to discover any suspicion of them, the Lords
Justices having declared by their Letters (which Letters were not disapproved
of by the Parliament here) that they were so far from owning a public
jealousy of all Papists there, that they had thought fit to put Arms into the
hands of diverse Noble men of the Pale of that Religion, who made Professions to
His Majesty's Service, and desired the same. And since so great a trust reposed
in some of the Lords of that Religion was not disapproved by the Parliament
here, His Majesty could not imagine it unsafe or unfit for Him to give Licenses
to some few to pass into that Kingdom, who, though Papists, professed due
Allegiance and Loyalty to His Majesty.

And therefore unless the first Affirmation of the House of Commons can be
made good by some particulars, His Majesty does not know that His Ministers
have failed in their diligence and faithfulness to His Majesty in this point,
or that His honor has suffered so much by any Act of His own, as that it
needs be vindicated for the time past by any other way then such a Declaration
which He expects from this House, as in Duty and Justice due to His Majesty.

FINIS.
