A DECLARATION OF THE Lords and Commons Assembled in PARLIAMENT.
Martis ult. Februarii, 1642.
THe Lords and Commons taking into Consideration, the miserable Distractions
and Calamities, with which this whole kingdom and Nation is now infested, the
Face and Cruel Effects of an unnatural Civil War, being too visible and
apparent in all the parts thereof, and the Power of the Sword so prevailing, as
that the Public Justice of the kingdom cannot be expected to be administered
in a just and indifferent way, but that the Judges and Ministers thereof may be
terrified and awed by the Power of Armed men, And also for preventing of
Inconveniences which may happen by Assemblies of multitudes of people in these
times of miserable Distraction, have thought fit to Order, And the said Lords
and Commons in Parliament Assembled, do Ordain and Declare, that the several
Judges and Justices of Assize, and Nisi Prius, and Justices of Oier and
Terminer, and Goal delivery, and their Associats, and the Clerks of the
Assize, and every of them, of, or within any of the Counties or Cities of
England and Dominion of Wales, do forbear to Execute any of the said
Commissions, or to hold or keep any Assizes, or Goal delivery at any time
during this Lent vacation, or to issue out any Warrant for summoning the
Assizes within any County in which they shall be appointed Judges or Justices;
And if they have already issued any, that they forthwith revoke and recall the
same, and herein their ready and perfect obedience is expected and required, as
they will answer the Contempt and neglect hereof, before the Lords and Commons
in Parliament.

Martis ult. Februarii, 1642.
OOrdered by Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament, that this Declaration
