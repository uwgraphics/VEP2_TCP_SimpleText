A true bill of the whole number that has died in the City of London, the
city of Westminster, the city of Norwich, and diverse other places, since the
time this last sickness of the plague began in either of them, to this present
month of October the 20. day, 1603. With a relation of many visitations by the
plague, in sundry other foreign Countries.
IT is no doubt that the corruption of the air, together with uncleanly and
unwholesome keeping of dwelling, where many are pestered together, as also the
not observing to have fires private and publicly made as well within houses,
as without in the streets, at times when the air is infected, are great
occasions to increase corrupt and pestilent diseases. Neither can it be denied,
that the ouer-boldnes of many preasing into infected places, and the lewdnes of
others with sores upon them, presuming into the open air, some of wilfulnes,
but truly many of necessity, contaminateth and corrupts diverse: as the
Leprosy, the Pocks, and sundry such unclean diseases do: as by drinking,
lying in company, and other such means, where pure complexions and clean
bloods are defiled with such as are putrified: and therefore carefully to be
avoided. But all these are accidental, and rather effects then the cause.

In the year of Christ, 81. and in the year 188. there continued a great time
a plague in Rome, of which there daily died two thousand people.

In the year 254. fifteen provinces of the Roman Empire, were in a manner
consumed with the pestilence.

In the year 530. there died in Constantinople five thousand a day, and diverse
times ten thousand: and at that time, in some other parts of Greece, there
were not sufficient living men left to bury their dead.

And in the year ^69. there fell such a plague in Constantinople, that there
died in six months spa^, 7. hundred thousand persons, and the year following
fell such a famine, that a penny loaf of bread of English money, was worth a
crown of gold: by reason whereof, the people died as fast then of the famine,
as they did before of the plague.

In the year 540. there began an universal plague all over the world, that
continued 50. years with great violence. And in the year 1348. in Paris in
france, there died a hundred thousand people of the Plague.

In the year 1359. so great a pestilence there was in Italy, that there were
scarce ten left of a thousand. And in the year 1521. there died in Rome a
hundred thousand of the pestilence.

In the years 1576. and 77. in Millan, Padua, and Venice, there fell a hundred
thousand in every City: and in Bohemia (being but a small Kingdom) there
died three hundred thousand the same time.

Soon after the conquest of King William, Duke of Normandy, when the people
were subdued to him, and the Knights fees rated which he had made, and himself
placed with crown and scepter, he took number of the acres of land in all
the realm, and of all the people, and of all the cattle: after which fell so
fore a plague, that the people died in such number that tillage decayed, and
famine ensued, with rot of cattle, that men were feign to eat flesh of dogs,
cats, and mise. A fearful example for Princes.

In the reign of King Edward the third, there fell a very great pestilence in
the East Indies, among the Tartarians, Saracens, and Turks, which lasted the
space of seven years: through the fear whereof, many of the Heathens
willingly offered themselves to become Christians. And shortly after, by reason
of passengers from one Province to another, the same pestilence was dispersed
in many Christian Kingdoms, and amongst other places, brought into England:
where it was so forcible all over the Land, that not only men, but also
beasts, birds, and fishes were smitten therewith, and found dead with botches
upon the^. Also among men, the number yt were left alive, were scarely
sufficient to bury their dead. At which time, with the rest that then died of
the plague, Henry Duke of Lancaster, Blanch Duchess of Lancaster, and the
Earl of Warwick ended their lives. So yt in one year, in a little plot of
ground of 13. acres compass, then called Spittle-croft, and now the
Charter House, was buried fifty thousand persons, besides all them that were
then buried in the Churchyards, and diverse places in the fields.

Also in Barbary, Alexandria, Tripolie, and in Constantinople, this last year
1602. fell so grievous a plague, that there died three thousand a day for a
long time together.

Our visitations, though our sins exceed, have been more gentle. For in the
first great plague in our memory after the loss of Newhauen, from the first of
January 1562. to December. 1563. there died of the plague, twenty thousand, one
hundred, thirty six.

And in the last great visitation, from the 20. of December 1592. to the 23. of
the same month in the year 1593. died in all 25886. of the plague in and about
London, 15003. And in the year before, 2000.

God of his mercy, as he did then, hold his heavy hand from us, and give us
true repentance, the only mean to win his grace toward us.

And now in this present visitation which it pleases God to strike us with,
there has died from the 17. of December 1602. to the 14. of July 1603. the
whole number in London and the liberties, 4314. Whereof of the plague, 3310.
