An Answer to the London PETITION.
You Gentlemen and Citizens,
BOth you and your request are welcome to Us, and cannot fail of a kind
reception here, where your former merits, and your present good intentions are
so well known. It is natural in the Patient to seek cure of his disease, and
to move the Physician to use his best skill, and it is commendable in you under
your sufferings to apply your selves to Us for ease; and we hope it is not
mere impatience urges you to seek things impossible, or unjust: Your prayers
for peace are Honorable, so was Jacobs wife for children; yet when she cried,
Give me children or I die, she was too blame; for she sought that of Jacob,
which Jacob had no power to give, and she sought the same with such violence,
as Jacob ought not to have heard. But we will only conceive, that without all
impatience, you seek of Us Peace, so far as we can procure it, and not
absolutely, for it depends not so much upon Us, as the King, and it is not in
Us to draw the King to a Peace, except His Majesty be as inclinable to it, as
we are. And we will conceive also that you seek not Peace nakedly, except it
come along with Truth, Righteousness, and Honor, and of such a Peace we are
as zealous as you can wish Us to be; and for other Peace, if we should wholly
submit to the Kings party, without all conditions for future security, such a
submission to that Party would be no redress but an increase of your present
sufferings. We are entrusted in this by the whole Kingdom, and that trust we
must not break upon the solicitation of any part of the kingdom: You are a
considerable part of London, but you are not whole London, and London is a
considerable part of this kingdom, but it is not the whole kingdom, and we,
according to our trust, must look upon the whole kingdom: but it may be, that
you see more than the whole kingdom, and may out of that sight offer some
thing to Us for the ease and relief of the whole kingdom; in this we will not
gainesay you, it is possible that some clear way and form of a just, safe,
and honorable Accommodation may be opened, and discovered to you, which has
not yet been found out by Us; if this be so, we desire you cordially, and in a
friendly manner to communicate your apprehensions, and understandings of this
affair to us, and by our sudden and full embrasement there of, you shall soon
find how dear, and precious the face, the very name or sound of Peace is to
us: In the mean time we desire you to rest assured, that if there be any
defect in us, it must needs be in point of understanding, it cannot be in point
of affection. No men living can be in affection more devoted to safe Peace then
we are. And further, we desire you not to censure us of any defect at all, no,
not so much as in understanding, except you can reveal to us some better way,
then we have hitherto assayed: No Accommodation can be, but we must leave
something to the King upon trust, and if the Accommodation be even, the King
will not deny some trust to us, but in this help to advise us how far we
shall trust the King, and how far we shall trust the Kings party; were the
King utterly disingaged from all parties, perhaps we would wholly trust the
King, and desire no trust at all to be left in us from his Majesty: but we see
in the Kings party, some that have a strange power in his affection, yea a
greater power far than we have, and yet they are known to be deeply in
raged Papists, violently engaged Delinquents: and if you would wholly put your
selves and the kingdom into the trust of such a party, we are bound to
withstand it, as much as we can, The King protests to hate Popery, and
disavowes all thoughts of Arbitrarie Rule, yet we know all, how far he is
addicted to Papists, and Malignant haters of Parliaments: and since we cannot
submit to the King, but we must submit to His Party, whom He preferres before
us, what advantage is it to us, whether He be in heart the selsesame, as His
Party is, or not? The truth is, we and the Kings party are so diametrically
opposite in Religion and State both, that he cannot protect both, if they are
his friends, we are his enemies; if we are his friends, they are questionless
his enemies; if he shield them from our justice, he must expose us to their
injustice; either they must judge us, or we them, no middle way can be safe;
nor deserve the name of Accommodation, it must prove inevitable confusion in
the end. Many years we have already struggled together, and they have all the
while found more favor from the Court then we; but now we are more
implacablie exasperated by blood, one against the other, and they will not lay
down Arms before us, nor ought we before them, and if both lay down Arms
together, yet little safety will be to us; for our Religion and profession will
^inde us truly to perform, but theirs will ^inde them to betray us, and since
they are greater in the Kings favor, and are loose from Oaths, when we are
discountenanced, and our hands are tied from defense, what equality of Treaty
is there? We will speak now to you, as we would to the whole body of England;
if you prefer their cause and being before ours, speak it out more plainly:
if you wish better to us, and think better of us, be wary of such
Accommodation, as may render us upon unequal terms into their hands. You will
say we have received other Petitions with more favor, when they have more
concurred with us in their Votes, We confess and justify it: for when the
people have encouraged us by Petitions, answering to our Votes, and have
invited us to be more hardy in searching their wounds, fearing our too much
tenderness in their own case, we could not but resent a better disposition
and capacity of cure, then now we take notice of in such contrary Petitions,
as seem to express a distrust of us, though indeed your professions be clean
contrary. Yet to deal plainly with you, and all other Petitioners: We love
not to be solicited at all by the People in any case whatsoever, except when
we do manifestly fail of our duty, either out of too much fear, or too
much presumption. Howsoever for the present go peaceably home, and if you
think us worthy of that trust which you have hitherto reposed in us, leave to
us to consider of this your Petition with all its circumstances, and assure
your selves, we will condescend to the more hazard, and depart something the
more from our own due in our demands from his Majesty for your sakes. And if
you prefer your own judgments before ours, proceed to advertise us lovingly
and fairelie, wherein we may do you more good, or how we may draw nearer to a
prudent Accommodation, and impart more particularly your open sense thereof.
Howsoever we desire you to address your selves to his Majesty in the same
manner as you have done to us, unless you condemn us as more indisposed to
peace then his Majesty is, and let your request be, that in this valuation of
his Party, and his Parliament, He would be equally pleased to condescend, and
depart from his former rigor of Terms, as you expect from us, or else we must
pronounce you in this unequal. And for the sum of all, let your desired
Accommodation be such, as shall maintain us to be the Kings legal Parliament,
and a legal Parliament to be the Kings highest Court of Judicature, and the
highest Judicature of the King fittest to determine all public disputes; and
best disposed to mercy, as well as justice; and policy, as well as Law: and
without more ado your wished Accommodation is perfected, and agreed upon.

FINIS.
