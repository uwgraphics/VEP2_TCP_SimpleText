TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE The Knights, Citizens and Burgesses now assembled in
Parliament.
The humble Petition of Andrew Church, George Allen, Thomas Sander, Robert
Parkinson, John Tippin, and John Wigmore, as it was by them delivered to Master
Speaker the 9 of August, in the behalf of the multitude of poor tradesmen
and artificers, in and about the Cities of London and Westminster, with the
Suburbs and liberties of them both, And by Master Speaker, presented to the
honorable house of Commons, the 16. of the same month.
HVMBLY SHOWS,
THat the infinite number and increasing multitudes of Aliens which have and
still do Intrude themselves into this Kingdom are so great both of French,
Walloones and Dutch, and their access of using trades here in these Cities
and liberties, which is the Rumating of the most part of the poorer sort of
Tradesmen in the said Cities and liberties, That thereby the French, Walloones
and Dutch have got our trades into their hands so, that we native borne
subjects are enforced to be their servants, and have our bread snatched out of
our hands by them, A thing not suffered in any other Common wealth. 2 That
since the beginning of this happy parliament there have been diverse petitions
delivered to this honorable Assembly for prevention of this misery and
mischief, which we poor natives lie groaning under the burden of. 3 That we
which suffer most (by this grievance) are poor men and not able to wage law,
and therefore the more slighted by those of Eminency amongst us, and from our
Masters and Officers can get noe Relief in this case, our Masters and
governors in the places where we live having taken diverse sums of money to
license, admit, and allow the said Aliens to trade as freely as we, insomuch
that many of us Tradesmen which might have lived very comfortably on our Trades
and been helpefull unto others, are forced through want of Employment to be
chargeable to the parishes in which we live, many even to beg, many to turn
Porters, Day-labourers, Waterbearers, Chimney-sweepers, and the like thus the
Aliens are cherished, and many of them get great and unknown estates, as it
were even out of the subjects mouths. 4 That a great part of the said Aliens
are Roman Catholics, and but few of them that have any certificates to show of
what Religion they are, or how they learned their trades which now they use. 5
That the said Aliens the most part of them live in Allies, by-places, and odd
corners, postering their houses with five or six families in one house, which
is altogether very dangerous for infection, especially now in these Cities and
Liberties. 6 That by the tollerating such infinite numbers of them, they having
gotten the most part of our trading into their hands, commercing one with
another, and employing men and women of their own nations, as Brokers, to sell
and put off their works and wares for them, whereby they do daily increase,
which makes houses at excessive rents, and all provision the dearer. 7 That we
native borne subjects, are by the Laws of this Land, to serve seven or eight
years for our trades before we are suffered to work for our own benefit: But
on the contrary, the Aliens and strangers at their first coming, set up as
masters, or work as iourneymen without restraint. 8 That we Englishmen are not
suffered to enjoy any of these privileges in France, but must of necessity be
servants there, and not be suffered to work, no not so much as in our
chambers, in pain of the loss of the commodities so wrought.
Therefore we laying aside all Confidence in our Magistrates Masters and
governors on whom we have Relied, we do here most humbly appeal to this
Honorable assembly, knowing that it is your desires and all you labor for, to
do good, to Relieve the oppressed, to Reform abuses, and to hear all poor
men's grievances: Our request is to this Honorable assembly, that your grave
Wisdoms will be pleased to take the premises into Consideration, and provide
some fit means whereby we may be releived herein, And your petitioners as in
all duty bound will daily pray for your prosperities.
