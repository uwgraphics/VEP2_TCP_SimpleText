LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.

His Majesty's Speech and Protestation, Made in the Head of His Army, between
Stafford and Wellington, the 19. of September, 1642. after the reading of His
Orders.
Gentlemen,
YOu have heard these Orders read; It is your part in your several places to
observe them exactly: The time cannot be long before We come to Action,
therefore you have the more reason to be careful: And I must tell you, I shall
be very severe in the punishing of those, of what condition soever, who
transgress these Instructions. I cannot suspect your Courage and Resolution;
your Conscience and your Loyalty has brought you hither to fight for your
Religion, your King, and the Laws of the Land; you shall meet with no Enemies,
but Traitors, most of them Brownists, Anabaptists, and Atheists, such who
desire to destroy both Church and State, and who have already condemned you to
ruin for being Loyal to Us. That you may see what use I mean to make of your
valor, if it please God to bless it with Success, I have thought fit to
publish my Resolution to you in a Protestation, which when you have heard Me
make, you will believe you cannot fight in a better Quarrel; in which I
promise to live and die with you.
