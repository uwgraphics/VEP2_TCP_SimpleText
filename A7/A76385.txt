The Benefit of Marriage.
OR, The Married Man's good Fortune, with his Counsel to young Batchelors,
Who having tasted of that sweet content
Which wedlock does afford, is fully bent
To praise good Women, giving them their due,
Yet speaks no more then what he knows is true.
Young men draw near, and buy this Song, I pray,
Which being done, then bear it hence away,
And to your Sweet-hearts send it in a Letter,
'Twill be a means to make them love you better.
To the Tune of, The Young Man's Advice.




A Man that had a pretty young Wife,
who closely unto him did cling, Sir,
And loved him as dearly as her life,
which to him much comfort did bring, Sir:
They lived in love and true content,
And oftentimes in merriment,
he used this Song for to sing, Sir.
Once I lay with another Man's Wife,
and I lay in a great deal of danger,
But now I have gotten a Wife of my own,
I scorn for to pick on another man's Bone,
for I lie at Rack and Manger.
I would not be unmarried again,
for all the worlds rich treasure;
For whilst I a Bachelor did remain,
I never enjoyed such pleasure:
But till such time as I was wed,
A dumpish heavy life I led,
with sorrow beyond all measure.
Once I lay, etc.
Did men but know the worth of a Wife,
they would no longer tarry,
But every one to better his life,
would quickly make haste and marry:
Although with creaturs the world does abound
Yet for man's use there cannot be found
a help that is so necessary.
Once I lay, etc.
Though Paradise was Adams first seat,
wherein were great store of blessings;
Yet his enjoyments were not complete,
but still there was one thing missing,
Till Eve became his loving Wife,
Who brought much comfort to his life,
and cheered his heart with kissing.
Once I lay, etc.
It was for man that a Woman was made,
therefore they should not be parted;
But let each young man choose a Comrade,
and be unto her kinde-hearted:
So from all dangers he shall be free,
And from those follies delivered be,
by which many thousands have smarted.
Once I lay, etc.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.




DO but consider, pray, what is man,
till such times as he does marry;
Let him take care and do what he can,
though he be never so wary:
Yet he for want of a Woman's aid,
To many misfortunes is betrayed:
and does very often miscarry.
O once I lay, etc.
Whilst men live single they are very apt
to wander and go astray, Sir;
By wanton women's wiles they are entrapt,
and turned out of the right way, Sir:
But being wedded to virtuous wives,
They are converted and live honest lives,
for with them they freely may play, Sir.
O once I lay, etc.
Then let not strumpets whose actions are base
cheat you with cunning delusions;
For they will bring you to shame and disgrace,
and you will finds in conclusion,
That those vain Objects you doted upon,
And after which you so greedily run,
did tend to your utter confusion.
O once I lay, etc.
That man is worse then a mad man I think,
who does a Whore maintain, Sir:
For though she helps him away with his chink,
she will not at all take pains, Sir;
But live an idle lazy life,
When as an honest careful Wife,
does many a shilling gain, Sir.
O once I lay, etc.
O young men take my counsel I pray,
and if that you fain would be thriving:
Then know assuredly it is the best way,
for you all to go a wiving:
Or else your work can never be done,
Because so long as you are alone,
against the stream you are striving.
O once I lay, etc.
I have not skill enough to set forth,
a virtuous woman's praise, Sir,
But for to show their most excellent worth,
I will endeavor always, Sir:
And for a truth this I declare,
That loving, honest, and good women are
the lengthners of men's days, Sir.
O once I lay, etc.
A loving Wife will do any thing,
to make a man merry and jolly;
Sometimes she will laugh, sometimes she will sing,
to drive away sad melancholy:
Therefore to live a single life,
And lose the benefit of a Wife,
I count it a point of folly.
O once I lay, etc.
And now for to conclude my Song,
and end my harmless Ditty;
Let no young Bachelor tarry too long,
but get him a Wife that is pretty:
For which he needs not look very far,
Because pretty Virgins plentiful are,
in Country and also in City.
O once I lay, etc.
FINIS.
