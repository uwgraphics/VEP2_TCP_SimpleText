BY THE KING
A Proclamation prohibiting the payment and receipt of Customs, and other
Maritime Duties upon the late pretended ORDINANCE of both Houses of PARLIAMENT.
WE have made so many Declarations of Our Royal Intentions concerning the
preserving of the Religion and Laws of this Land, That We think it not fit
often to repeat, Though by Gods grace We seriously intend never to decline or
depart from the same. But this seems most strange unto Us, that whilst
(especially at, and about LONDON) Our just and Legal Commands are not obeyed,
other Orders and Ordinances, (for which there is no Legal foundation) which
not only discountenance but overthrow the Laws of the Land that settle
Religion, and were the senses of the Subjects property, are submitted unto and
obeyed by many of Our weaker Subjects: And amongst these a blind obedience has
been yielded unto the pretended Ordinance, for settling Customs without an act;
of Parliament, when an Act this Parliament (received from Us, and so understood
by Us, as one of the greatest graces the Crown ever conferred on the Subject)
declares, no Custom is due without an Act; and all such persons as receive
the same incurr the forfeiture of a praemunire. This We thought would not have
found obedince from the Merchant, who understood what his own benefit was
thereby and could not be ignorant how penal it was in him to break this Law;
especially when he found he paid his Custom for support of an unnatural War
against his Prince, and to foment an intestine and Civil dissension which has
already, and may in the future produce so many Evils upon this poor People.
But upon the menaces and usage some received that denied it, We find since a
more general Obedience in such as Trade, then We expected, though We
understand by it the Trade of the Kingdom is much lessened. Nevertheless We
thought not fit until this present, by any of Our Proclamations to prohibit
the same, because We hoped before this time; We having so often and by so many
means endeavored the same, some happy understanding might have been between
Us, and both our Houses of Parliament. But at present finding that the monyes
arising from these Duties, are a great part of the fuel that maintains this
fire, and supports this unnatural Rebellion against Us, and heightens the
Spirits of such as have no Spirit to Peace, unless they may destroy Us Our
Posterity, and the settled government both of Church aod State; We do hereby
Declare to all Our People of what sort soever, That whosoever henceforward
shall, by virtue of the pretended Ordinance of Parliament, pay any Monyes for
Custom or other Duties therein mentioned, other then to Our proper Ministers,
what is due to Us by the known Laws of the Kingdom, That We will proceed
against him or them in due time, as an ill-affected person or persons to the
Peace of this Kingdom, and as such as endeavor (as much as in them lies) to
hinder a true Intelligence betwixt Us and Our People. And for such person or
persons as shall continue to require or receive the same contrary to the
Statute made this Parliament, We shall likewise proceed against them according
to the penalty in the said Act, And because (though the Law ought to have been
every man's prohibition) We did not, until this time, forbid the same, We do
hereby grant our free pardon to all such as formerly having either paid, or
received these customs, shall henceforth refuse the same, And to no other.

Given under Our Sign Manual at Our Court at Oxford, the sixteenth day of
December, in the Eighteenth year of Our Reign. GOD SAVE THE KING.
