Cum priuilegio Regali ad imprimendum solum.

John^ Byrch Clerk / to the right excellent Doctor in Phisike Andrewe Board.
AS I chanced for to walk, for my recreacyon
To pass the time forth, to peruse a certain thing
I saw two stand in communicacyon
And i^ their hand a book, whereupon they were redig
I vaylyd my bonet, with that they were smiling
That not regarding. I passed sorth by
With that the one called me, willing to come ny
I merueyled not a little, what was their intent
To call me so hastily, this thing is plain
An excellent work, to me they did present
Instantly prayenge me, to take the pain
To answer to your maystershyp that berdes does disdain
And so upon that, they betoke me the book
Prayenge me heartily, it to over look
Wherein full ungodly, your doge ryme does reports
Read it who will, no doubt he shall find
Nothing you do but rail on every sort
As a man half dystraught, wantynge his mind
So that onles, you would make men blind
Mark who will in your book, in manner one and all
You make all men linaues, yet are you the pryncypall
Thus when I had red it, I did consider
(...)
How of beardes you make, your definition
Payntyng men's beardes, after a strange sort
I knew by that you were a physycyon
And in ars Physonomye, had great speculacyon
I never herd clener rethoryke, since the hour I was borne
I iuged when I red it, you were borne under Capricorn
I maruayle greatly, you being a physycion
And knows unto man, it is given by nature
To have of hear abundaunce, by gods creacyon
You will not this deny I am perfect and sure
In case that you do, you may say your pleasure
But this will I say, in our English speech
And you love a bearde no better, sing that of your brech
It is a strange thing, to hear your phalitasy
How goodly your bearde, you would deuyse
A muster deuelyce would become you pretely
You say you love a bearde, after that gyse
But and I might make you one, it should be on this wise
Because I understand your name is master Boorde
you should have an antike beard of a whelps toorde
Now by Jesus you make me not a little to study
what should be the cause you hate so a bearde
I think in my mind you have the frensy
Or else perchance, one made you afearde
His breche being bare came ronnynge backwarde
(...)
For you study more the^ Physic, I perceive it well
But before or you enter, I will you promoote
To come that shall draw your bearde up by the root
For I tell you, I do not love them that be heary
I am of that opinion, as well as you
Therefore I would, that you should now spedely
P^^^^e up your bearde then will it look new
A^^^^de as a Coote, this thing is true
(...) beware I say, of ^he frosty weder
And when you will be shaven take a dyshe clout or a feder*
I marvel not a little, as god shall help me
To se a man inuey, after such a fashyon
Exceptynge men, that are in great dygnite
That it is lawful, you make probation
To wear their beardes, but mark your conclusyon
you are so cyrcumspecte, and speaks so plainly
Look who wereth beardes, you call it knavery
you say under beardes, be both lyce and neties
Pockes and pockerelles, there does remain
I think if a man looked betwyxte your lyppes
A man might find there, perchance on^ or twain
Good store of scabbes, in your breche to be plain
Seeing under beardes, dyseases are not strange
By like when you had a beard, you were full of the mange
(...) in beardes I perce^^ (...) are so co^nyng
^
Going from the order showed by scripture
As appears by your book / does rail at your pleasure
Then you show your self to have been in far co^trayes
Descrybynge the manner how berdes they use there
And after this sort your book so says
In token of auncyentnes this thing is clear
Sage men use beardes there for to wear
Which thing you rekyn in them for great sadness
And Englyshemen the contrary, a point of madness.
Now it is but folly this matter to delate
Mark in ancient stories both new and old
Look who was beardyd, was ever in estate
As a man of reputacyon, he might be bold
If ought were spoken / the beardyd man it told
Thus were the beardyd men in high estymation
And look who had none / was of small reputation.
In a bearde does manhood plainly consyste
The sign of a bearde, strength does sygnifye
This is found in natural things search who list
The prudent Philosophers, this does testyfye
who list in them to search shall find it plainly
And look who has no bearde, it is a sign he is no man
And till he have a bearde, he is much like a woman
If you will know the thing to a bearde belongyng
That is grauyte sadness, and likewise dyscretion
Full of force or strength always in his wurkynge
(...) a bearde should be of this condycyon
(...) man, that vleth the court
And wot you what they say, they maruayle what you are
They judge you seen in cranes dyrt and call you master phisikar.
Now for because perchance / men will judge
Malice should increase betwyxte you and me
I do you to wit I another murmur nor grudge
But if men shall write, let them write honestly
Notwithstanding, that I speak but merely
Prayenge you heartily, to take it as you list
For I must needs praise beardes and yours were bepyst
Thus for fear I be to tedyous / I will make ^n end
Prayenge you heartily / to be content
For I think you and I / have spent much wind
yet notwithstanding / after my judgment
Take a gostly father / and confess you this lent
So shall you be clean / as the hour you were borne
And have as clear a souse / as he that wereth a horn
Now you know my mind / of the sum and all
In case you be angry look that you freyt
Take a wyspe and rub your self on the gall
Till that you have gotten you a knauy she heyte
Then walk up and down / and look that you sweet
And I pray you heartily / take no cold
For I had rayther se you hylthe / then that you so should
This at the last / but that I have forgotten
I thought in mind / to say fare well
I trow cocks body I am forspoken
I would you were at the devil of hell
