BROGYNTYN AN AFFIDAVIT OF Hackney Coaches.
JOHN Bateson of the Parish of St. Andrews Holbourn Oylman, and Josiah Parker
of the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields, Beadle to the Farriers Company of the
City of London, make Oath, That they on the 19th, 20th and 22d Days of January
last, made Diligent Search in all places in London, and Westminster, and within
the Weakly-Bills of Mortality, and to our certain knowledge, there was not more
at that time than 833 Hackney-Coaches, mentioned in the Shedules hereunto
annexed, in Testimony whereof we have hereunto put our Hands,

John Bateson. Josiah Parker.
January 23. 1693.
Sir Lacon. Will. Child one of the Masters of Chancery.

Since this enquiry was made, several Coachmen have failed and been forced to
leave off, by reason of the Dearness of Horsemeat, etc. The Hackney-Coachmen
are very well satisfied, that there is not now above 700 Hackney-Coaches, that
daily Work within the places above mentioned.

If this Honorable House will be Pleased to order an Inspecton into the truth
of this matter, the Hackney-Coachmen will send two men with those they Please
to Appoint, and pay the Charge.

For these Projectors has misinformed this Honouaable House, which will Ruin a
1000 Families: Intending Advantage to themselves, not the Government.
