A PROCLAMATION AGAINST Vicious, Debauched, and Profane Persons.
By the King.
CHARLES R.

SInce it has pleased the Divine Providence in so wonderful a manner, and by
ways and means no less miraculous, then those by which he did, heretofore,
preserve and restore his own chosen people, to restore Us, and Our good
Subjects to each other, and to show Us a very hopeful Prospect, if not to put
Us already into possession of that Peace, Happiness, and Security with which
this Our Kingdom has been heretofore blessed; It will become Us all, in Our
several Stations, to acknowledge this transcendent goodness of Almighty God, in
so seasonable a conjuncture, with such a Circumspection, Integrity, and
Reformation in Our Lives, that We may not drive away that Mercy which so near
approaches Us, by making Our selves (wholly) unworthy of it. And in Order
hereunto, We think it high time to show Our dislike of those (against whom We
have been ever enough offended, though We could not, in this manner declare it)
who, under pretense of Affection to Us and Our Service, assume to themselves
the liberty of Reviling, Threatening and Reproaching others; and as much as in
them lies, endeavor to stifle and divert their good Inclinations to Our
Service, and so to prevent that Reconciliation and Union of Hearts and
Affections, which can only, with Gods Blessing, make Us rejoice in each other,
and keep Our Enemies from rejoicing.

There are likewise another sort of Men, of whom we have heard much, and are
sufficiently ashamed, who spend their time in Taverns, Tipling-Houses, and
Debauches, giving no other Evidence of their Affection to Us, but in drinking
Our Health, and Inveighing, against all others, who are not of their own
dissolute temper; and who, in truth, have more discredited Our Cause, by the
License of their Manners and Lives, then they could ever advance it by their
Affection or Courage. We hope that this extraordinary way of delivering Us all,
from all We feared, and almost bringing Us to all We can reasonably hope, has
and will work upon the Hearts, even of these Men to that degree, that they will
cordially renounce all that Licenciousness, Profaneness, and Impiety, with
which they have been corrupted and endeavored to corrupt others, and that they
will, hereafter, become examples of Sobriety and Virtue, and make it appear,
that what is past, was rather the Vice of the Time, then of the Persons, and so
the sitter to be forgotten together.

And, because the fear of Punishment, or apprehension of Our Displeasure, may
have influence upon many, who will not be restrained by the Conscience of their
Duty, We do declare, That We will not exercise just Severity against any
Malefactors, sooner, then against Men of dissolute, debauched, and profane
Lives, with what parts soever they may be otherwise qualified and endowed; and,
We hope, that all Persons of Honor, or in Place and Authority, will, so far
assist Us, in discountenancing such Men, that their Discretion and Shame will
persuade them to reform what their Conscience would not, and that the
displeasure of good Men toward them, may supply what the Laws have not; and,
it may be, cannot well provide against, there being by the License and
Corruption of the Times, and the depraved Nature of Men, many Enormities,
Scandals, and Impieties, in Practice and Manners, which Laws cannot well
describe, and consequently not enough provide against, which may by the example
and severity of Virtuous Men, be easily discountenanced, and by degrees
suppressed.

However, for the more effectual reforming these Men, who are a discredit to
the Nation, and unto any Cause they pretend to favor, and to wish well to; We
require all Majors, Sheriffs, and Justices of Peace, to be very vigilant and
strict in the discovery and prosecution of all Dissolute and Profane Persons,
and such as Blaspheme the Name of God, by profane Swearing and Cursing, or
revile or disturb Ministers, and despise the Public Worship of God; that
being first bound to the Good behavior, they may be further proceeded against,
and exposed to shame, in such a manner, as the Laws of the Land, and the just
and necessary Rules of Government shall direct or permit.

Given at Our Court at Whitehal, the Thirtieth day of May, in the Twelfth Year
of Our Reign.
