An Apollogie of the Soldiers to all their Commission Officers in Sir THOMAS
FAIRFAX his Army.
SIRS,
WE your Soldiers who have served under your Commands, with all readiness to
free this our land and nation from all tyranny and oppression whatsoever, and
that by virtue of Commission both of this present Parliament, and from the
hands of Sir Thomas Fairfax, whom now is our General at this present, and
likewise also from all the late generals that were his predicessors in this
our late war, which was, and is both justifiable and warrantable for you, which
both by the law of nature, and the necessity of the land, through the
permittance of God you have been called unto: Now we (we say) meaning the whole
Solderie, who have faithfully served both the State and you, without any by
respect to our selves, or any ambition of or to that great power that God has
been pleased to put into their hands, or that honor that he has cast upon any
of you, but on the contrary were always right glad, when that any
conscientious, godly and juditious moral man was placed either in that great
Counsel at home, or the public service broad, which we had thought would have
been to the utter extirpation of all ungodliness and illegal proceedings
against the liberty of the Subject, according to the tenor of all their oaths,
vows, declarations, and Protestations, through which hope and comfort the
hearts of our whole Army were mightily animated, and unanimously went through
all difficulties to the uttermost of our power, even to the adventuring of our
lives, limbs, and estates, for the preservation of the Gospel, the liberty of
the Subject, and the just and right privileges of Parliament, which we shall
ever be willing to maintain, they protecting us in our lives, liberties and
estates, to live under them safely and peaceably in the faith and practice of
the Gospel, which was and is the tenor of our service, of which we have but
little hopes, seeing every day where we come to our great discomfort, how the
common enemies of our peace are countenanced and we disregarded, or rather
contemned, and the honest party of the Kingdom in all parts slited, and in
many places imprisoned, whereby we are made sensible, what we are like to
suffer, when once dispersed, by which means we are enforced, or rather
provokd, to frame or draw a petition unto the honorable house of Parliament,
wherein we shall make knowing our grievances, whereunto we desire your assent,
yet notwithstanding we are not ignorant of that great likelihood, which there
is of estates to be sealed upon all of you, which will be in effect-but like the
trunling of a goulden-bal before you, to make you to run after it, with an
intent never to let you have it, but when they have once devorced you from your
Soldiers, think to order you at their pleasure, and indeed if they once effect
this their design, which we think is the disbanding of our forces, that then
you must subject your selves unto their wills, and so make a god of your
Mammon, or else be content to part with what they shall so settle upon you, and
also that which is your own already, and however it will be but a pu chasing
of a bondage of s^^very to you and your posterity to eternity, they being
carried along as we perceive in many of their proceedings, by those who not
dare to both pray and preach for the destrict^^^ of our Army in these words,
that God would be pleased to bring to confusion those wicked, ungodly
Commanders, and damned trooping Devils, (for whose vistories the Lord make us
ever thankful) but before this disbanding be brought to pass^, we hope they
will out of a godly and sericus consideration think upon us their Soldiers who
have faithfully served them in this their love and unhappy war, even unto the
very subduing of their enemies, through the wonderful blessing of God, they
themselves, lives, liberties, and estates together with the Kingdoms
deliverances, being testimonies of our service, and not to expose us into the
hands of such merciless men, where we shall not dare to make any profession of
what God shall hold sooth or reveal unto us, nay not yet once to speak in the
behalf of this our just and lawful service in which we have served them,
which we do render in respect of our liberties, ^en thousand times more then
all our Arrears, in which we hope they will not in the least deal
discourteously with us, we being such men as are willing to walk by this rule,
as to be content with our wages, and we having our brethren the Scots, for an
insample in that particular, and again, we say, it had been better for us
never to been born, or at least to have been an Army, then that those honest
people, who have shown themselves with us, and for us in these our sad
calamities, and that ten times more for our just privilege and liberties, then
for their own ends, then that they should suffer either imprisonment of body,
or any other tyrannical and ungodly persecutions, and that without any redress
or legal relief, who have been imbolened through those blessed achievements
and successions of our Army, as to discover themselves for us, among whom we
may count our selves who are like to partake of the same afflictions, if not
prevented before the anulity of our army, which if not that then there will be
but little difference between you, our Officers, and us your Soldiers, witness
that audatiousnesse of the ill affected in all places, saying of some of you
^heady, what was such and such a one before these times, besides those wicked
and insolen: speeches wherewith the whole Army in general is mocked, scoffed
and derided by those wicked, Matcha ^illians of the world undeservedly.

Now these and many other such like reasons being taken into your serious
considerations we hope will we be just cause for you to go along with us in
this business, or at the least to let us quietlly alone in this out design,
we desiring no more then what is just and right, according to all their
Declarations, and Protestations to the whole world, that being our witness,
thus leaving you to the powerful wisdom of God, which is only able to make
you wise to all things, we rest so praying.

Your servants so far as we may.
