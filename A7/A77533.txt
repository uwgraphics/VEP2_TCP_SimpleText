To the Right Honorable, The Lord Viscount Taaff.
My LORD,
I Count it one of the greatest unhappinesses that has befaln me, that I must
go out of the kingdom without conferring with a person upon whom I so much
depend, both in what concerns His Majesty's Service, and my own particular
Interests in this Kingdom; and who (if I do not flatter my self) does me the
favor, in some measure, to depend upon my Resolutions, either in order to the
Affairs of this Kingdom or k 3. of h 5. e 17. m 31. p 37. l 29. o 35. y 53. me

succeed so in the way of His Majesty's Service from this Kingdom, as that you
may be encouraged to set up your rest in it, I shall not take more care of mine
own Honor and Fortunes, then of yours, if c 4you 370. will n 4. R 41. e 17. l

ever, be confident that I am most faithfully and unalterably,

My Lord, Your Lordships affectionate humble Servant, G. Digby.
Kilkenny, 20 Aug. 1647.
To the Lord Viscount Taaff.
My dear Lord,
RElying upon your constancy to what you have promised, I shall go on boldly
and industriously in the vvays of ferving you; and I make no question, but I
shall either succeed in dravving the party you are now engaged with, under His
Majesty's power, in which case the chief Military Command of this Kingdom
will be in your hands, as I could vvish; or else in case it be fit, you in
Duty and Loyalty to His Majesty to quit this country, I shall settle you such
conditions of Honor and advantage abroad, as you shall confess I have been no
ill manager of your Interests. Two things only I have to recommend unto your
care, the one, That you endeavor to draw to you into Munster, such Leinster and
Vlster Forces as you are sure are possessed with the same resolutions that you
are; the other, that you will not let any appearing advantage, or the height of
your spirit transport ye to hazard a fight with your Forces this Summer, but to
stand unalterably upon the wariest defensive you can; carrying always in your
mind, That both all our hopes for His Majesty's service in this Kingdom, and
in case those fail, those of our own being considerable abroad, depend upon
your preserving that Army. One thing more I shall beg of you, That since our
Duty to His Majesty's Interests, and to our own Honor, having already received
Moneys, oblige us to tender our service in the first place to France; that you
will not make your self so familiar with Don Diego, as to draw suspicion from
the French Agents of your dealing doubly; which will be ruinous to all our
undertakings, if once our Honors should be in that kind disparaged. This is
all I have to say at present, more then to conjure you to rely upon this
truth, That you could not in the world have fixed upon a friend so careful of
your Interests, as you shall find

My Lord, Your faithfullest humble Servant, G. DIGBY.
Wexford this last of Aug. 1647. I conjure you to be as good as your word, in
sending me over the sweet youth your Son; and by my care of him, judge of the
rest.



FINIS.
