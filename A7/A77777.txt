State of this Kingdom; suppose to be Deformed in the year 1639.

Cried up to be Reformed in the year 1646.

The Change of an Age.

London Printed in the Year of Reformation, M.D.C.XLVI. march 22

The Balance Put into the hands of every Rational English Man, to Poise the
State of this Kingdom.
IT is no safe task in a time like this, to write truth of Men and Manners,
the visible Authors, and known means of so unexampled distraction, and
confusion: when it is destructive, but to be in suspect to observe them: And it is
an unsufferable weight to be borne by any Man, who can make title to
understanding; to hear with silence, people pretending to Religion, and to
nothing else; crying up against reason, a Reformation, in which them selves are
(however in themselves insensibly) to the stranger standers by visibly ruined.
Provoked therefore by my compassion to my Country, the seat of minds as
unnatural as the war, by which it languisheth, and by pity of my gulled
(because willing to be gulled) Countrymen, I have endeavored to convince the
opiniators of a Reformation: by putting yesterday and to day, this and the end
of the preceding Septenarie in the Balance. And therefore invite such who are
in any capacity of being advised, to a retrospection, so far as the year
1639. Where they may if they look not through State-spectacles, see a King
selected, whose Royal, or Christian reputation Fame dared not; could not, with
so much as a whisper, sulley: Rich in the accumulate hearts of a Numerous, and
Loyal people, happy, eminently happy, in his Royal Consort; and in the
pledges of their mutual loves, and of our succeeding, (hopefully succeeding)
peace, in their assured succession: Strong in Arms, and stored with crowded
Magazines of all Military provisions; Predominant at Sea above his Ancestors,
by a formidable Navy; and in an instant able to confront an Army, (to say no
more) in the Field, like a King of such a Kingdom: A Court in which (himself
being president) the Men and Manners completed an Academie.

They may see a Church full of light, Order and Discipline, having a form
beautiful, and an inside garnisht, and enricht with as much (not to swell the
comparison) Learning, and Piety, as observation, or story can attribute to any
since Christianity was a profession. Those then inconsiderable few the
opposers, or interrupters of its peace, and Government; being persons of as
obscure mark, as of clandestine and mycheing motion, skulking like young
Foxes, and no sooner unkenneld, but as Vermin pursued; the General Odium
being contracted upon them: They may see a Nobility, Lustrous, like mirrors by
the Suns, their Princes, reflex, in the badges of their honor, and office, a
flourishing Gentry, plentifully sharing dignities, and trusts in the Military,
and civil Magistracy. An obedient, peaceful, and contented Cominalty; the
number of the factions of all conditions, scarce justifying the name of a
number: Cities exemplarie to our neighbors for their Government, and envied by
them for their opulencie in present havings, and assured growth in an
increasing Trade, Universities both of Divinity, the Arts, and Laws Common,
and Civil, beyond any foreign example: Stoar'd with able professors,
sedulous, and well-manner'd Students; taught by Learned and frequent Lectures,
in all Studies, and rudiments, conducing to the building up of men, for a
succession of Ministers, and Counselors: a Land populous, plenteous, at unity
with it self; the gaze and envy of foreign Nations, and in so high a degree
of happiness, as to be almost incapable of a degree of happiness in addition,
or diminution, no means but miracle, or war to abate it to misery, and the
means to beget such a war to the best understanders, appearing to be of no
less extent then a miracle. It is the height of unhappiness, to look
backward at so much of blessing, and to say it was. Consider the present
reformed condition of all these; And see a King rejected, and in his good name
of King, and Christian blasphemed: Poor by the loss of the deceived, seduced
hearts, of an abused and misguided people; Divorced from his injuriously
maligned (because exemplary faithful) Consort: distanced from the sight of his
dear and Princely Issue, dispersed like a scattered Covye; that succession, of
whose likelihood, each man had cause to joy in, being become disputable; a King
reduced to less power, Armature, or store, then the Master of a private
family, and frighted from a visible storm, to an uncertain, and now failing
shelter. A Court vanished, and no footsteps left of its former beauty, and
civility; a Church shuffeld to indistinction; degrees unadmitted, Sects, and
Schisms, Heresies, and Blasphemies, in this time, and Kingdom, vying with all
those of past Ages, and foreign Nations; and in number, partaken and
countenanced by Grandees of the new State, and walking in foro uncontroled; and
like the wild Boares of the Forest, rooting up the established Religion, while
he ancient, and true Protestant changes turns, with the last ages Seperatist;
and serves God in corners, to avoid reproach.

A Nobility clouded by their Suns Eclipse, and the Foggs arising from their
inferiors, and their own degenerate spirits; their very honors being made
arbitrary, and no longer theirs, then the common throng shall continue them in
vogue, which is always dated with their subservience to the better felt, then
discovered faction: A Gentry discountenanced by an introduced party, awed by
Tenants, and Servants, impoverished by long Sequestrations, and second
purchases of their lawful, and not to any subjects single, or aggregate, by
any act forfeitable inheritance. A giddie Comminaltie, and tumultuous, fond of
new words, who would have something, and otherways then it was; but what, how
much, and how done they are not bound to discover, till they know themselves;
Their freedom lost, nay rather given away, liberty of person, property of
estate, reputation, and good name, being become mere Notions, and by law not
preservable, nor vindicable. Cities dispeopled, untraded by the obstruction,
and impoverisht by the charge of a continued war, and as much confounded in
Government, as opinion; Universities, and Inns of Courts motlied by a
miscellanie of families, a mixture of beardlesse, and brainlesse Professors,
and Governors: a Junior bachelor, and a Senior fellow, being terms
convertible, lectures of law neglected, and of Divinity, and Arts performed by
such, who are therefore unfit to read, because not used to hear. The refusal
of a not understood, or to well understood Covenant; being enough to break
laws of pious founders of Colleges, and establishment of a succession of
learned, and religious Princes to the disseizing, and ejection of many, and the
most able Masters, Fellows, and Scholars, from their lawful and rightful
freeholds; by the supply of whose rooms, a man would guess that there were a
design to increase, and propagate Devotion by an Introduction of Ignorance.
And all this justified by sons of the same sister-mothers. Lawyers pleading,
and Ministers preaching Ordinances, against the known Laws of God, and he
Nation: A Land more then skim'd of its Inhabitants, and generally harassed, and
worn out by pays, and quarterings, grown almost wild in want of husbandry,
and so much at emnity with it self, that there is hardly found a single, and
that a faithful freindship, or good neighborhood: And all this by a war,
raised by our selves for Reformation sake; acted, and prosecuted by, and upon
our selves, as if we had in he dark, lost the spirit of sober Christians, and
grop't out the fury of inflamed Bacchinalls, and could find no place to
skowre our long rusted swords, other then our own bowels. It is a hightened
and superlative affliction to a diseased person, so only to be made to
understand his defects, as to know them to be irreparable.

Hold now an even hand, and poize these two conditions impartially, and tell
me, tell thy self, where lies the improvement? Where the Reformation? If yet
to be expected, where the foundation is laid for such a hoped superstructure?
Sure Commonwealths, and Churches have not a Philosophical Generation, the new
out of the perversion, the corruption of the ancient Government; the new out of
the extirpation, the annihilating the established old religion; And if so great
tempests, and earthquakes of Drums and Artillery, subversions and immersions,
of persons and estates: Such unreckonable expense of a Kingdom coined (to
effect) forsupplyes, and such inundations, and overwhelmings of blood, beget
but a bare promise of such an issue, what remains for the Nation to undergo
before its production? Doubtless this birth can at these rates be attended
with no less then a desolation, when there shall be too few left, and those
too much enfeeble to fall out about the enjoyment of so great a happiness.

Reason was given to man for a direction, as well as a distinction, and
generally we believe our eyes above any assertions: Poor self-deceiving
Englishman, who can not be sensible how fantastic thy opinionate
Reformation is, how real the devastation of thy substance, and can find a
hope that the one will improve, and not a fear that the other may inmpaire; As
thou art only miserable in a proportion at present from thy self; so the
remaining degrees which thou art to take in misery, are not to be proceeded in
without thy consent to a continued vassilage.

It is just with God, and abates of the condemnation of imposing Man to lay
burdens, and use goades on those who will be beasts by disavowing their reason,
or pinning it upon opinion of another infallibility; and as just to strike
him blind, who will not see an object of his mark, in other colors, or
dimensions, then what are rendered by another spectacles.

FINIS.
