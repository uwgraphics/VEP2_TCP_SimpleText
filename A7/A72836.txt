The faithful Lovers resolution, b^ing forsaken of a coy and faythles Dame.
To the tune of, My dear and only Love take heed.


THough booteles I must needs complain
my fate is so extreme,
I loved, and was beloved again,
yet all was but a dream:
For as that love was quickly got,
so it was as quickly gone,
I Will touch no more a flame so hot,
I Will rather lie alone,
No Creature be she nere so fair
shall any way beguile
My fancy with a feyned tear,
nor tempt me with a smile:
I Will never think affection sound
that is so plainly shown,
Nor build on faith before it is found,
I Will rather lie alone.
Should now the little God conspire
again t'intrap my mind,
Or strive to set my heart on fire*
alas the Boy's to blind:
For sithes I Will never venture smiles,
nor hazard mirth for moan,
Nor yet regard a Woman's wiles,
I Will rather lie alone.
The blazing Torch is soon burnt out.
the Diamond light abides,
The first her glory hurles about,
the next her virtue hides:
The Spark if any shall be mine,
that else shows light to none,
For if to every eye she shine,
I Will rather lie alone.
No Woman shall deceive my thoughts
with colors not in grain,
Nor put a Love so slightly wrought
into my hands again:
I Will pa^ no more so dear for wit,
but live upon mine own,
Nor shall affection conquer it,
I Will rather lie alone.
And now I Will set my heart at rest,
in loving, labors lost,
I Will be no more so rarely blessed
to be so strangely crossed:
The love lost Turtle so will dye,
the Phenixe is but one,
They seek no Mates, no more will I,
but ever lie alone.
The coy Maidens answer.
To the same tune.


IF that your love was but a dream,
what Woman cares for love?
There is no mean if this extreme,
therefore your suit remove:
It booteth not for to complain,
then pray sir sease your moan;
Desires hot flame augments your pain,
you still may lie alone.
If beauty in a Woman's face
does residence there keep?
She must not in her heart give place
to all can seygne and weep:
But you do say it is Women's wiles
that causes Men to moan,
When all do know you do beguil's,
and let us not lie alone.
If Cupid caught you in his snare,
you must endure the pain,
And either speak him foul or fair,
your liberty to gain;
For since, or sob, I will not love,
my beauty is mine own,
An other man my heart must prove,
and you must lie alone.
The burning Taper spends it self
for to give others light:
The Diamond is esteemed for wealth,
and in the dark shows bright*
But like the Torch I Will never be,
I Will first be like the Stone,
And nere will yield in love to thee,
But rather lie alone.
If that I showed my self once kind,
and partly did you love,
May I not therefore change my mind,
and otherwise remove,
You should have held me faster sure,
and not have let me gone,
I Will come no more unto your lure,
but let you lie alone.
If Phenixe like you do intend
to end your days in fire,
My life I mean not so to spend,
my thoughts are mounted higher:
I Will love and bill like Turtle-doues,
although it breed your moan;
When you are gone there is more Loves,
I will not lie alone.
