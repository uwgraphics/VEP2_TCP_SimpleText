ANE Pleasant Satyr of the thrie ESTAITIS IN COMMENDATIOVN of vertew and
vituperatioun of vice, as follovvis.
DILIGENCE. THe Father and founder of faith and felicity,
That our fassioun formed to his similitude
And his Sone our Savior scheild in necessity,
That bocht ow from baillis ranson rude,
Repleadge and his presonaris with his hart-blude
The halie Gaist governor and grounder of grace
Of wisdom and weilfair both fontaine and flude,
Gif ow all that I sie seasit in this place,
And scheild ow from sin.
And with his Spreit ow inspyre
Till I have shawin my desire
Silence Sovereign I require
For now I begin,
TAk tent to me my friends and hald ow coy,
For I am sent to ow as messingeir,
From ane nobill and rycht redoubtit Roy:
The quhilk hes been absent this money eir.
Humanity give e his name wald speir:
Quha bade me shaw to ow but variance,
That he intendis amang ow to compeir,
With ane triumph and awful ordinance:
With crown and sword and scepter in his hand,
Temperit with mercy quhen penitence appeiris:
Howbeit that he lang time hes been sleipand,
Quhairthrow misreull hes rung their money eiris:
That innocentis hes been brocht on their beiris,
Be falls reporteris of this natioun:
Thocht oung oppressouris at the elder leiris,
Be now assurit of reformatioun.
Sie no misdoeris be sa bauld,
As to remain into this hauld:
For quhy be him that Judas sauld
They will be heich hang it.
Now faithful folk for joy may sing:
For quhy it is the just bidding
Of my sovereign lord the king
That na man be wrangit.
Thocht he ane quhyll into his flouris
Be gouernit be vylde trompouris:
And sumtyme lufe his paramouris,
Hauld e him excusit.
For quhen he meittis with Correctioun,
With Verity and Discretioun,
They will be banisched aff the town,
Quhilk hes him abusit.
And heir be oppin proclamatioun,
I wairne in name of his magnificence,
The thrie estaitis of this natioun,
That they compeir with detfull diligence?
And till his grace make their obedience.
And first I wairne the Spritualitie,
And sie the burgessis spair not for expense:
Bot speid them heir with Temporalitie.
Als I beseik ow famous auditouris,
Conveinit in this congregatioun,
To be patient the space of certain houris,
Till e have hard our short narratioun.
And als we make ow supplicatioun,
That na man tak our wordis intill disdain:
Althocht e hear be declamatioun,
The common-weill richt pitiouslie complain.
Rycht so the verteous lady Verity,
Will make ane pitious lamentatioun:
Als for the treuth sho will impresonit be,
And banischit lang time out of the town:
And Chastity will make narratioun,
How sho can get na ludging in this land,
Till that the heauinlie king Correctioun,
Meit with the king and commoun hand for hand.
Prudent peopill I pray ow all,
Tak na* man grief in special:
For we sall speik in general,
For pastyme and for play.
Thairfoir till all our rymis berung,
And our mistoinit sangis be sung,
Leteuerie man keip weill ane tongue,
And every woman tway.

Rex Humanitas. O Lord of Lords and King of kingis all,
Omnipotent of power Prince but peir,
Ever ringand in gloir Celestial
Quha be great micht and haising na mateir
Maid heauin and eird, fire, air and watter cleir:
Send me thy grace with peace perpetual,
That I may rewll my realm to thy pleaseir,
Syne bring my saull to joy angelical.
Sen thou hes giuin me dominatioun
And rewll of pepill subject to my cure,
Be I nocht rewlit be counsall and ressoun,
In dignity I may nocht lang endure.
I grant mystait my self may nocht assure
Nor it conserve my life in sickernes:
Have pity Lord on me thy creature
Supportand me in all my business.
I thee requeist quha rent was on the Rude,
Me to defend from the deids of defame:
That my pepill report of mebot good,
And be my saifgaird both from sin and shame*
I know my day is induris bot as ane dream,
Thairfoir O Lord I hairtlie the exhort,
To gif me grace to use my diadeame
To thy pleasure and to my great comfort.

Wantonness. My Sovereign Lord and Prince but peir,
Quhat garris ow make sic dreirie cheir*
Be blyth sa lang as ear heir,
And pas time with pleasure:
For als lang leifis the mirrie man,
As the sorry for ocht he can:
His banis full sair Sir sall I ban
That dois ow displeasure.
Sa lang as Placebo and I,
Remains into our company,
our grace sall leif richt mirrely:
Of this haif e na dout.
Sa lang as e have us in cure*
our grace sir sall want na pleasure:
War Solace heir I ow assure,
He wald rejoice this rout.

Placebo. Good brother mine quhair is Solace
The mirror of all mirrines,
I have great meruell be the Mes
He taries sa lang.
Bide he away we ar bot shent,
I ferlie how he fra us went:
I trow he hes impediment
That lettis him nocht gang.

Wantonness. I left Solace that same greit loun
Drinkand into the burrows town,
It will cost him half of ane croun,
Althocht he had na mair.
And als he said he wald gang see
Fair lady Sensuality,
The burial of all beauty
And portratour preclair.

[]Placebo. Be God I see him at the last
As he war chaist rynnand richt fast,
He glowris euin as he war aghast
Or fleyit of ane gaist.
Na, he is wod drunkin I trow,
Se e not that he is wod fow:
I ken weill be his creischie mow
He hes been at ane feast.

Solace. Now quha saw ever sic ane thrang?
Me thocht sum said I had gain wrang,
Had I help I wald sing ane sang
With ane rycht mirrie noise.
I have sic pleasour at my heart,
That garris me sing the troubill pairt:
Waldsum good fallow sill the quart
It wald my hairt rejoice.
Howbeit my coat be short and nippit,
Thankis be to God I am weill hippit
Thocht all my gold may shone be grippit
Intill ane penny pursse.
Thocht I ane seruand lang haif been,
My purchais is nocht worth ane preine:
I may sing Peblis on the greine
For ocht that I may tursse.
Quhat is my name can e not guess,
Sirs ken e nocht Sandy solace?
They callit my mother bonie Besse
That dwelt between the bowis.
[] Of twelf eir auld sho learnit to swyfe,
Thankit be the great God on live:
Scho maid me fatheris four or five,
But dout this is na mowis.
Quhen ane was deid sho gat ane other,
Was never man had sic ane mother:
Of fatheris sho maid me ane futher,
Of law it men and leirit:
Scho is both wise, worthy and wicht*
For scho spairis nouther kuik nor knycht:
ea four and twenty on ane nicht,
And ay their eine schobleirit,
And gif I lie sirs e may speir:
Bot saw e nocht the King cum heir?
I am ane sportour and playfeir
To that Royal oung King:
He said he wald within schort space
Cum pas his time into this place:
I pray the Lord to send him grace,
That he lang time may ring.

Placebo. Solace quhy taryit e sa lang?

Solace. The feind a faster I micht gang:
I micht not thrist out throw the thrang,
Of wyfes fyftein fidder:
Then for to rin I tuik ane rink,
Bot I felt never sik ane stink:
For our lordis luif gif me ane drink,
Placebo my deir brother.

Rex Hu. My servant Solace quhat gart ow tarry?

Solace. I wait not sir be sweit saint Marie,
I have been in ane feirie farie
Or ellis intill ane trance:
Sir I have seen I ow assure
The fairest earthly creature,
That ever was formit be nature
And may for to advance*
To luik on her is great delight,
With lippis reid and cheikis quhyte
I wald renunce all this world quyte
For till stand in her grace:
Scho is wantoun and scho is wise:
And cled scho is on the new gyse,
It wald garall our flesche up rise
To luik upon her face.
War* I ane king it sold be kend,
I sold not spair on her to spend:
And this same nicht for her to send,
For my pleasure:
Quhat rak of our prosperity*
Gif e want Sensuality?
I wald nocht gif ane silly fly,
For our treasure.

Rex. Forsooth my friends I think e are not wise,
Till counsall me to break commandment
Directit be the Prince of Paradyce:
Considering e know that my intent
Is for till be to God obedient,
Quhilk dois forbid men to be lecherous:
Do I nocht sa perchance I will repent,
Thairfoir I think our counsall odious
The quhilk e gaif me till.
Because I have been to this day
Tanquam tabula rasa: That is als mekill as to say.
Ready for good and ill.

Placebo. Believe e that we will begyll ow,
Or from our vertew we will wyle ow,
Or with evil counsall overseyll ow,
Both into good and evil:
To tak our graces part we grant
In all our deidis participant,
Sa that e be nocht ane oung sanct
And syne ane auld devil.

Wanton. Believe e Sir that Lechery be sin,
Na, trow nocht that, this is my ressoun quhy,
First at the Romance Kirk will e begin
Quhilk is the lemand lamp of lechery:
Quhair Cardinals and Bischops generally
To luif Ladies they think ane pleasant sport,
And out of Rome hes baneist Chastity
Quha with our Prelates can get na resort.

Solace. Sir quhill e get ane prudent Queine,
I think our Majesty serein
Sold have ane lusty Concubein,
To play ow withal:
For I know be our quality,
e want the gift of chastity
Fall to in nomine Domini,
This is my counsall.
I speik Sir under protestatioun,
That nane at me haif indignatioun:
For all the Prelates of this natioun,
For the may part:
They think na schame to have ane huir,
And sum hes thrie under their cuir:
This to be true I Will ow assuir
e sall heir efterwart.
Sir knew all the matter throch
To play e wald begin
Speir at the Monks of Bamirrinoch,
Giflecherie be sin.

Placebo. Sir send e for Sandy solace*
Orells our moneoun Wantonness,
And pray my Lady Priores,
The suith till declair:
Gif it be sin to tak Kaity,
Or to leif like ane bummill baty
The buik sayis Omnia probate
And nocht for to spair.

Sensuality. Luifers awalk behald the fyrie spheir,
Behauld the natural dochter of Venus:
Behauld luifers this lusty Lady cleir
The fresche fonteine of Knichtis amorous
Repleit with ioyis dulce and delicious^
Or quha wald make to Venus observance.
In my mirthfull chalmer melodious?
Their sall they find all pastyme and pleasance.
Behauld my heid behauld my gay attire,
Behauld my halse lusum and lilie quhite:
Behauld my visage flammand as the fire
Behauld my papis of portratour perfyte.
To luke on me lufferis hes greit delight,
Rycht sa hes all the Kings of Christindome:
To them I haif done pleasouris infinite,
And specially unto the Court of Rome.
Ane kis of me war worth in ane morning
A milioun of gold to Knicht or King.
And it I am of nature sa towart
I lat no luiffer pas with ane sair heart.
Of my name wald e wit the verity,
Forsooth they call me Sensuality.
I hauld it best now or we farther gang,
To Dame Venus let us go sing ane sang.

Hamlines. Madame but tarying,
For to serve Venus deir,
We sall fall to and sing,
Sister Danger cum neir.

Danger. Sister I was nocht sweir
To Venus observance,
Howbeit I make Dangeir:
it be continuance,
Men may have their pleasance:
Thairfoir let na man fray,
We will tak it perchance,
Howbeit that we say nay.

Hamelines. Sister cum on our way,
And let us nocht think lang:
In all the haist we may,
To sing Venus ane sang.

Danger. Sister sing this sang I may not,
Without the help of good Fund-Ionet:
Fund-Ionet, hoaw cum tak a part.

Fund-Ionet. That sall I do with all my heart:
Sister howbeit that I am hais,
I am content to beir a bais.
e two sold luif me as our life,
[]e know I lernit ow both to swyfe:
In my chalmer e wait weill quhair,
Sen syne the feind ane man e spair.

Hamelines. Fund-Ionet, fie, e ar to blame,
To speik foull wordis think e not schame?

Fund Ionet. Their is ane hundredth heir sitand by
[]That luifis geaping als weill as I,
Micht they get it in priuitie:
Bot quha begins the sang let se.

Rex. Up Wantonness thou sleipis to lang,
Me thocht I hard ane mirrie sang:
I the command in haist to gang
Se quhat on mirth may meine.

Wantonness. I trow Sir be the Trinity
on same is Sensuality,
Gif it be scho sune sall I sie
That Soverance sereine.

Rex. Qu hat war they on to me declair?

Want. Dame Sensual both good and fair.

Placebo. Sir scho is mekill to avance,
For scho can both play and dance:
That perfyt patron of plesance
Ane perle of pulchritude:
Soft as the silk is her quhite lyre,
Her hair is like the goldin wyre:
My heart burnis in ane flame of fire
I sweir ow be the Rude.
I think scho is sa wonder fair,
That in earth scho hes na compair,
War e weill leirn it at luifis lair
And syne had her anis seen:
I wait be cokis passioun,
e wald make supplicatioun,
And spend on her ane millioun
Her lufe for till obtain.

Solace. Quhat say e sir ar e content,
That scho cum heir incontinent:
Quhat vails our kingdom and our rent,
And all our great treasure:
Without e haif ane mirrie life,
And cast aside all sturt and strife*
And sa lang as e want ane wife,
Fall to and tak our pleasure.

Rex. Gif that be true quhilk e me tell,
I will not langer tarry:
Bot will gang preif that play my sell,
Howbeit the world me wary.
Als fast as e may carry,
Speid with all diligence:
Bring Sensuality,
Fra-hand to my presence.
Forsuth I wait not how it stands,
Bot sen I hard of our tythands,
My body trimblis feit and hands
And quhiles is hait as fire:
I trow Cupido with his dart,
Hes woundit me out* throw the heart
My spreit will fra my body part,
Get I nocht my desire.
Pas on away with diligence,
And bring her heir to my presence:
Spair nocht for travel nor expense*
I cair not for na cost:
Pason our way schone Wantonness,
And tak with ow Sandy solace,
And bring that Lady to this place,
Or else I am bot lost.
Commend me to that sweitest thing,
And present her with this same Ring*
And say I ly in languisching,
Except scho make remeid:
With siching sair I am bot schent,
Without scho cum incontinent,
My heavy lang our to relent,
And saif me now fra deid.

Wantonness. Or e tuik skaith be Gods goun,
[]I lever their war not up nor down
Ane tume cunt into this town,
Nor twenty mile about.
Doubt e nocht Sir, bot we will get her,
We sall be feirie for till fetch her,
Bot faith we wald speid all the better,
Till gar our pursses rout*

Solace. Sir let na sorrow in ow sink,
Bot gif us Ducats for till drink:
And we sall never sleip ane wink
Till it be back or eadge:

Rex. Solace, sure that sall be no sunie,
Beir e that bag upon our lunie,
Now sirs win weill our wage;
I pray ow speid ow sone again

Wantonness. e of this sang sir we ar feign,
We sall nether spair wind nor rain*
Till our days wark be done:
Fairweill for we ar at the flicht,
Placebo rewll our Roy at richt:
We sall be heir man or midnicht,
Thocht we march with the Moon.

Wa^. Pastyme with pleasa^ce and greit prosperity
Be to ow Sovereign Sensuality,

Sen. Sirs e ar welcum quhair go e? eist or west?

Wantonness. In faith I trow we be at the farrest.

Sens. Quhat is our name I pray ou Sir declair?

Wan. Marie Wantonness the Kings secretair,

Sens. Quhat King is that quhilk hes sa gay a boy?

Wan. Humanity that richt redoutit Roy,
Quhilk dois commend him to ow hartfullie
And sends ow heir ane ring with ane Rubie
In takin that abuife all creator
He hes chosen ow to be his Paramonr:
He bade me say that he will be bot deid,
Without that e make haistelie remeid.

Se^s. How can I help him althocht he should for fair*

Sol. es lusty lady thocht he war never sa seik,
I wait e bear his health into our breik:
Ane kis of our sweit mow in ane morning,
Till his seiknes micht be greit comforting,
And als he maks ow supplicatioun,
This nicht to make with him collatioun.

Se^sualitie. I thank his grace of his benevole^ce,
Good sirs I sall be reddie evin fra hand:
In me their ^all be fund ^a negligence,
Both nicht and day quhen his grace will demand,
Pas e befoir and say I am cummand,
And thinks richt lang to haif of him ane sicht:
And I to Venus do make ane faithful band,
That i^ his arms I think to ly all nicht.

Want. That sal be done, bot it or I hame pas,
Heir I protest for Hamelynes our las.

Sens. Scho salbe at command sir quhen e will

Want. Now hay for joy and mirth I dance,
Tak their ane gay gamond of France:
Am I nocht worthy till avance?
That am sa good a page:
And that sa speedily can rin,
To tyst my master unto sin,
The feind a penny he will win
Of this his marriage.
[]I rue richt sair be sanct Michell,
Nor I had pearst her my awin sell:
For quhy on King be Bryds bell
Kennis na mair of ane cunt:
Nor dois the noueis of ane freir:
It war bot almis to pull my eir,
That wald not preif on gallant geir:
Fie that I am sa blunt.
I think this day to win greit thank,
Hay, as ane brydlit cat I brank:
Alace I have wreistit my schank,
Yet gangis be sanct Michaell.
Quhilk of my leggis Sirs as e trow*
Was it that I did hurtevin now?
Bot quhairto sold I speir at ow

Good morrow Master be the Mes,

Rex. Welcum my meneon Wantonness,
How hes thou sped in thy travel?

Wanton. Rycht weill be him that herry it hell:
our erand is weill done.

Rex. Then VVantonnes how weill is me,
Thou hes deseruit both meit and fie,
Be him that maid the Moon:
Their is anething that I wald speir,
Quhat sall I do quhen scho cums heir?
For I know nocht the craft perqueir
Of luifers gyn:
Thairfoir at lenth e mon me leir*
How to begin.

Wan. To kis her and clap her sir be not affeard,
Sho will not schrink thocht e kis her ane span wthin the baird
Gif e think that sho thinks shame the^ hyd ye bairnseine
[] With her taill, and tent her weil, e wait quhat I meine:
Will e leif me Sir first for to go to,
And I sall leirne ow all kewis how to do.

Rex. God forbid Wantonness that I gif the leife,
Thou art over perilous ane page sic practiks to preife.

Wan. Now Sir preife as e pleis, I se her cumand,
Use our self gravely, we sall by ow stand.

Sensual. O Queen Venus unto thy Celsitude,
I gif gloir, honor, laud and reverence:
Quha grantit me sic perfect pulchritude,
That Princes of my person have pleasance.
I make ane vow with humbill observance,
Richt reverently thy Tempill to visie,
With sacrifice unto thy Dyosie.
Till every stait I am so greabill,
That few or nane refuses me at all:
Paipis, Patriarks or Prelates venerabill,
Common pepill and Princes temporal,
Ar subject all to me Dame Sensual.
Sa sall it be ay quhill the world indures
And specially quhair outhage hes the cures.
Quha knawis the contrair*
I traist few in this company,
Wald they declair the verity,
How they use Sensuality:
Bot with me maks repair.
And now my way I man auance,
Unto ane Prince of great puissance,
Quhom oung men hes in governance
Rolland into bis rage:
I am richt glaid I ow assure,
That potent Prince to get in cure:
Quhilk is of lustines the luir,
And greitest of curage.
O potent Prince of pulchritude preclair,
God Cupido preserve our celsitude:
And Dame Venus mot keip our court from cair
As I wald sho should keip my awin hart-blud:

Rex. Welcum to me peirles in pulchritude,
Welcum to me thou sweiter nor the Lamber,
Quhilk hes maid me of all dolor denude,
Solace, convoy this Lady to my chamber.

Sensua. I gang this gait with richt good will,
Sir Wantonness tarry e still:
And Hamelines the cap eis fill
And beir him cumpanie.
That sall I do withoutin dout,
And he and I sall play cap'out,

Wan. Now Lady len me that batye tout
Fill in for I am dry.
[] our dame be this trewlie,
Hes gotten upon the gumis
Quhat rak thocht e and I
Go iunne our iusting Lumis,

Hamelines. Content I am with good will,
Quhen ever e ar reddie:
our pleasure to fulfill,

Wantonness. Now weill said be our Lady,
He bair my Master cumpanie,
Till that I may endure:
Gif e be quisland wantounlie,
We sall fling on the flure.

Good Counsall. Immortal God may of magnificence,
Quhais Majesty na Clark can comprehend:
Must save ow all that giuis sic audience,
And grant ow grace him never till offend,
Quhilk on the Croce did willingly ascend,
And sched his precious blude on every side:
Quhais pitious passioun from danger ow defend,
And be our gracious governor and gyde.
Now my good friends considder I ow beseik
The cause may principal of my cumming,
Princis or Potestatis ar nocht worth ane leik,
Be they not gydit be my good governing:
Their was never Empriour, Conqueror nor King,
Without my wisdom that micht their will avance,
My name is Good Counsall without feineing,
Lords for lack of my lair ar brocht to mischance.
Finally for conclusioun,
Quha halds me at delusioun:
Sall be brocht to confusioun:
And this I understand,
For I have maid my residence,
With hie Princes of greit puissance,
In Ingland, Italy and France,
And money other Land.
Bot out of Scotland wa alace,
Ihaifbene fleimit lang time space,
That garris our gyders all want grace
And die befoir their day:
Because they lychtlyit good counsall,
Fortune turnit on them her saill,
Quhilk brocht this Realm to meikill baill,
Quha can the contrair say?
My Lords I came nocht heir to lie:
Wais me for King Humanity,
Ov erset with Sensuality,
In th'entrie of his ring:
Throw vicious counsel insolent,
Sa they may get riches or rent,
To his weilfair they tak na tent,
Nor quhat sal be th'ending.
it in this Realm I wald make sum repair,
Gif I beleifit my name should nocht forfair,
For wald this King be gydit it with ressoun,
And on misdoars make punitioun:
Howbeit I haif lang time been exyllit,
I traist in God my name sall it be styllit.
Sa till I se God send mair of his grace,
I purpois tilrepois me in this place.

Flattery. Make room sirs hoaw, that I may rin,
Lo se quhair I am new cum,
^egaryit all with sindrie hewis:
Let be our din till I begin,
And I sall schaw ow of my newis.
Throuchout all Christindome I have past,
And am cum heir now at the last,
Tostit on sea ay sen uill day:
That we war feign to hew our Mast,
Nocht half an e mile beond the May.
Bot now amang ow I will remain,
I purpois never to sail again:
To put my life in chance of watter:
Was never seen sic wind and rain,
Nor of Schipmen sic clitter clatter.
Sum bade haill and sum bade standby,
On steirburd hoaw aluiff fie fie:
Quhill all the raipis beguith to rattil:
Was never Roysa fleyd as I,
Quhen all the sails played brittill brattill.
To se the waws it was ane wonder,
And wind that raif the sails in sunder,
Bot I lay braikand like ane Brok:
And shot sa fast above and under,
The Devil durst not cum neir my dok.
Now am I scapit fra that effray,
Quhat say e sirs am I nocht gay?
Se e not Flattery our awin fuill?
That eid to make this new array,
Was I not heir with ow at uill?
es be my faith I think on weill.
Quhair ar my fallows that wald nocht fail?
We should have cum heir for ane cast.
Hoaw Falset hoaw. --

Falset. -- Wa sair the Devil
Quha is that that cryis for mesa fast

Flat. Quhy Falset brother knawis thou not me?
Am I nocht thy brother Flattrie?

Falset. Now welcome be the Trinity
This meitting cums for good
Now let me bresse the ^^ my armis,
Quhen friends meits hearts warmis:
Quod Iok that frelie fud:
How happinit ow into this place?

Flattery. Now be my saul evin on a case.
I come in sleipand at the port,
Or ever I wist amang this sort.
Quhair is Dissait that limmer loun?

Falset. I left him drinkand in the town,
He will be heir incontinent.

Flattery. Now be the haly Sacrament,
They tydingis comforts all my heart:
I wait Dissait will tak my part.
He is richt crafty as e ken,
And counsallour to the Merchand-men:
Let us ly down heir both and spy,
Gif we persaue him cummand by.

Dissait. Stand by the gait that I maysteir,
Aisay Koks bons, how came I heir?
can not mis to tak sum feir,
Into sa greit ane thrang:
Marie heir ane cumlie congregatioun,
Quhat ar e sirs all of ane natioun?
Masters I speik be protestatioun,
In dreid e tak me wrang.
Ken e not sirs quhat is my name?
Good faith I dar not schawit for schame:
Sen I was clekit of my Dame,
it was I never leill:
For Katie vnsell was my mother,
And common theif my father-brother:
Offic freindship I had ane fither,
Howbeit I can not steill.
Bot it I will borrow and len,
As be my cleathing e may ken;
That I am cum of nobill men,
And als I will debait,
That querrell with my feit and hands:
And I dwell amang the merchands,
My name gifonie man demands,
They call me Dissait*
Bon-iour brother with all my heart,
Heir I am cum to tak our part,
Both into good and evil:
I met Good counsall be the way,
Quha pat me in ane felloun fray,
I gif him to the Devil.

Falset. How chaipit e I pray ow tell?

Dissait. I slipit into ane bordell:
And hid me in ane bawburds bed:
[]Bot suddenly her schankis I sched*
With hoch hurland amang her howis*

Till tak our time quhill we may get it,
For now thait is na man to let it:
Fra time the King begin to steir him,

And be we know in with Correctioun.

Thairfoir my deir brother deuyse
To find sum toy of the new gyse.

Flattrie. Quhat rak man I can richt weill fleich?
Perchance I Will cum that honor,

Pure Freirs ar free at any fealt,
And marchellit ay amang the best.
Als God to hes lent them sic graces,
That Bischops puts them in their places:
Out-throw their Dioceis to preiche,
Bot ferlie nocht howbeit they fleich:
For schaw they all the verity,
Thaill want the Bischops charity.
And thocht the corn war never sa skant,
The gudewyfis will not let Freirs want:
For quhy they ar their confessors,
Their heauinlie prudent counsalours.
Thairfoir the wyfis plainly taks their parts,
And shawis the secreits of their hearts,
To Freirs with better will I trow,
Nor they do to their bed-fallow.

For God nor I gaip in ane gallows,
Gif ever e fand thrie better fallows.

Bot quha is on that stands sa still?
Ga spy and speir quhat is his will.
And gif he earnis my presence,
Bring him to me with Diligence.

[] Dissait. That sall we do be Gods breid:

Trowit I that he come for ane train,
Of my freindis I sold raise ane futher.

Flattrie. I doubt full sair be God him sell,
That on auld churl be Gude-counsell:
Get he anis to the Kings presence,
We thrie will get na audience.

Dissait. That matter I sall tak on hand,
And say it is the Kings command,
That he anon devoyd this place,
And cum nocht neir the Kings grace:
And that under the pain of tressoun:

Flattrie. Brother I hauld our counsel ressoun.
Now let us heir quhat he will say,
Auld lyart beard, good day, good day.

Gude-counsall. Good day again sirs be the rude
The Lord mot make ow men of good.

For we are men of good already,

Swyith pak the sone unhappy vnsell.
Gif ever thou cum this gait again,

Gude-counsall. I pray ow sirs, gif me license,

To speik bot two words to his grace,

Flattrie. Swyith horsune carle, devoyd this place.

Gude-counsell. Brother I ken ow weill aneuch,
Howbeit e make it never sa teuch:
Flattrie, Dissait and Fals-report,

Dissait. Suyith hursun carle gang pak the hence,
Gif ever thou cum this gait agane,
I vow to God thousall be slane. Heir sall they hurl away Gude-Counsall.
Sen at this time I can get na presence,
Is na remeid bot tak in patience.
Howbeit Gude-counsall haistelie be nocht hard
With oung Princes it sold they noch be skard.
Bot quhen outhheid hes blawin his wanton blast,
Then fall Gude-counsall rewll him at the last.

Now the Vycis gangs to ane counsall. Flattrie. Now quhill Gude-Counsall is
absent,
Brother we mon be diligent:
And make betwix us sikker bands,
Quhen vacadns fallis in onie Lands.
That every man help weill his fallow,

Dissait. I had deir brother be Alhallow.

Let every man keip weill ane tongue.
And in ilk quarter have ane spy,

Quhen any casualities,

And let us make provisioun,
Or he cum to discretioun*
Na mair he waits now nor ane sant,
Quhat thing it is to haif or want,
Or he cum till his perfyte age,
We sall be sikker of our wage:
And then let every carle craif other.

Di. Yat mouth spcik mair my awin deir brother.
For God nor I rax in ane raip,
Thou may gif counsall to the Paip.

Now they return to the King. Rex. Quhat gart ou bid sa lang fra my presence?
I think it lang since e depairtit thence.
Quhat man was on with an greit bostous beird
Me thocht he maid ow all thrie very feared.

Dissait. It was ane laidlie lurdan loun,
Cumde to break buithis into this town:
We have ga^t bind him with ane poill,
And send him to the theisis hoill:

Rex. Let him sit their with ane mischance,
And let us go to our pastance.

Wantonness. Better go revel at the rackat,
Or ellis go to the hurly hackat,
Or then to schaw our curtlie corsses,
Ga se quha best can rin their horses.

Solace. Na sovereign or we farther gang
Gar Sensuality sing ane sang.

Heir sall the Ladies sing ane sang* the King sall ly down amang the Ladies and
then Verity sall enter. Verity. Diligite Iustitiam qui iudicatis terram. Luif
Justice e quha hes ane Judges cure,
In earth and dried the awful Judgment,
Of him that sall cum judge both rich and pure,
Rycht terribilly with bludy wounds rent.
That dreidfull day into our hearts imprent:
Beleuand weill* how and quhat manner e
Use Justice heir til vthers, their at lenth
That day but doubt sa salle iudgit be.
Woe than and duill be to ow Princes all,
Suffer and the pure anes for till be oppressed:
In everlasting burn and fire e sall
With Lucifer richt dulfullie be dressed.
Thairfoir in time for till eschaip that nest,
Feir God, do law and Justice equally,
Till every man: se that na puir oppressed
Up to the hevin on ow ane vengence cry.
Be just judges without favor or fead,
And hauld the Balance euin till every wicht:
Let not the fault be left into the head,
Then sall the members reulit be at richt.
For quhy subjects do follow day and nicht
Their governors in vertew and in vice.
e ar the lamps that sold schaw them the licht
Lo leid them on this sliddrie rone of ice.
Mobile mutatur semper cum principe vulgus. And gif e wald our subiectis war
weill geuin,
Then verteouslie begin the dance our sell:
Going befoir* then they anon I wein,
Sall follow ow, either till heuin or hell:
Kings sold of good exempils be the well*
Bot gif that our strands be intoxicate,
In steid of wine they drink the poison fell:
Thus pepill follows ay their principate.
Sic luceat lux vestra coram hominibus, vt videant opera vestra bona. And
specially Princes of the Priests,
That of peopill hes spiritual cuir,
Daily sold revolue into our breistis,
How that their haly words ar still may sure
In verteous life gif that e do endure
The pepill will tak mair tent to our deids
Then to our words: and als both rich and puir
Will follow ow both in our warks and words. Heir sal Flattrie spy Verity
with ane dum countenance.
Gif men of me wald have intelligence,
Or know my name, they call me VERITY.
Of Christis law I have experience,
And hes over saillit many stormy sey.
Now am I seikand King Humanity,
For of his grace I have good esperance,
Fra time that he acquaintit be with me,
His honor and heich gloir I sall avance.

Heir sall Verity pas to her sait. Dissait. Good day father, quhair have e
been?
Declair till us of our nouels.
Flattrie Their is now lichtit on the grene,
Dame Verity, be Buiks and bells.
Bot cum scho to the Kings presence
Their is na buit for us to bide.
Thairfoir I red us all go hence.

Falset. That will we nocht it be Sanct Bryde
Bot we sall ather gang or ride,
To Lords of Spritualitie,
And gar them trow on bag ofpryde,
Hes spokin manifest heresy.

Heir they cum to the Spiritualitie. Flattrie. O reverent fatheris of the
Sprituall stait,
We counsall ow be wise and vigilant:
Dame Verity hes lychtit now of lait,
And in her hand beirand the Newtestament*
Be scho ressauit but doubt we ar bot schent,
Let her nocht Judge thairfoir into this Land,
And this we reid ow do incontinent,
Now quhill the King is with his luif sleipand.

Spritualitie. We thank ow friends of our benevolence,
It sall be done evin as e have devysit:
We think e serve ane gudlie recompense,
Defendand us that we be nocht supprysit.
In this matter we man be weill aduysit,
Now quhill the King misknawis the verity,
Be scho ressauit then we will be deprysit,
Quhat is our counsel brother now let se?

Abbot. I hauld it best that we incontinent,
Gar hauld her fast into Captivity:
Unto the third day of the Parliament
And then accuse her of her herisie:
Or than banische her out of this cuntrie,
For with the King gif Verity be knawin*
Of our greit gloir we will degradit be
And all our secreits to the commouns schawin.

Person. ese the King is it effeminate,
And gydit be Dame Sensuality,
Rycht sa with oung counsall intoxicate,
Swa at this time e haif our liberty.
To tak our time I hauld it best for me,
And go distroy all their Lutherians:
In special on lady Verity,

Spirituali. Schir Person e sall be my commissair,
To put this matter till executioun*
And e sir Freir, because e can declair
The haill process, pas with him in commissioun,
Pas all togidder with my braid bennisoun,
And gifscho speiks against our liberty,
Then put her in perpetual presoun,
That scho cum nocht to King Humanity.

Heir sall they pas to Verity. Person. Lusty Lady we wald feign understand,
Quhat earand e haif in this Regioun?
To preich or teich quha gaif to ow command,
To counsall Kingis how gat e commissioun?
I dreid without e get ane remissioun,
And syne renunce our new opiniones
The sprituall stait sall put ow to perditioun
And in the fire will burn ow flesche and bones.

Verity. I will recant nathing that I have schawin,
I have said nathing bot the verity:
Bot with the King fra time that I be knawin
I dreid e spaiks of Spritualitie*
Sall rue that ever I came in this cuntrie
For gifthe Verity plainly war proclamit,
And specially to the Kings Majesty,
For our traditions e will be all defamit.

Flattrie. Quhat buik is that harlot into thy hand,
Out walloway, this is the New Test'ment,
In Englisch tongue, and printit in England,
Herisie, herisie, fire, fire incontinent.

Verity. Forsooth my friend e have ane wra^g judgment,
For in this Buik their is na heresy:
Botour Christ's word, both dulce and redolent,
Ane springing well of sinceir verity.

Dissait. Cum on our way for all our ealow locks
our vantoun words but doubt e sall repent:
This nicht e sall forfair ane pair of stocks,
And syne the morn be brocht to thoill Judgment.

Verity. For our christ's saik I am richt weill content
To suffer all thing that sall pleis his grace,
Howbeit e put ane thousand to torment,
Ten hundredth thousand sall rise into their place. Verity sits down on her
knies and sayis.
Get up, thou, thou sleipis all too lang, O Lord,
And make sum ressonabill reformatioun
On them that dois tramp down thy gracious word,
And hes ane deidlie indignatioun
At them quha maks may true narratioun:
Suffer me not Lord mair to be molest,
Good Lord, I make the supplicatioun
With thy vnfreinds let me nocht be suppressed:
Now Lords do as e list,
I have na mair to say.

Flattrie. Sit down and tak ow rest,
All nicht till it be day.

They put Verity in the stocks and return to Spritualite. Dissait. My Lord
we have with diligence
Bucklit up weill on bledrand baird:

Spritualitie. I think e serve good recompense,
Tak thirten crowns for our rewaird.

Verity. The Prophecy of the Propheit Esaias
Is practickit alace, on me this day:
Quha said the verity sold be trampit down
Amid the streit, and put in strange presoun.
His five and fyftie chapter quha list luik,
Sall find their words writtin in his Buik.
Richt sa Sanct Paull wrytis to Timothy,
That men sall turn their earis from verity.
Bot in my Lord God I have esperance,
He will provide for my deliverance.
Bot e Princes of Spiritualitie,
Quha sold defend the sinceir verity,
I dreid the plagues of Iohnes Revelatioun
Sall sal upon our generatioun.
I counsall ow this miss t'amend,
Sa that e may eschaip that fatal end.

Chastity. How lang sall this inconstant world endure,
That I sold baneist be sa lang alace:
Few creatures or nane takis on me cure,
Quhilk gars me money nicht ly harbrieles.
Thocht I have past all eir fra place to place,
Amang the Temporal and Spiritual staits:
Nor amang Princes I can get na grace,
Bot boustuouslie am halden at the etis.

Diligence. Lady I pray ow schaw me our name,
It dois me noy our lamentatioun,

Chas. My friend their of I neid not to think shame,
Dame Chastity baneist from town to town.

Diligence. Then pas to ladies of Religioun,
Quhilk maks their vow to observe Chastity:
Lo quhair their sits ane Priores of renown,
Amangs the rest of Spritualitie.

Chastity. I grant on Lady hes vowit Chastity,
For her professioun thairto sold accord:
Scho maid that vow for ane Abesie,
Bot nocht for Christ Jesus our Lord.
Fra time that they get their vows, I stand for'd,
They banische her out of their cumpanie,
With Chastity they can make na concord
Bot leids their lyfis in Sensuality,
I sall observe our counsall gif I may,
Cum on and heir quhat on Lady will say? Chastity passis to the Lady Priores
and sayis.
My prudent lusty Lastie Priores,
Remember how e did vow Chastity:
Madame I pray ow of our gentilnes,
That e wald pleis to haif of me pity:
And this ane nicht to gif me harberie,
For this I make ow supplicatioun
Do e nocht sa Madame I dreid perdie,
It will because of depravatioun.

Priores. Pas hynd Madame, be Christ e cum nocht heir,
e ar contrair to my cumplexioun:
Gang seik ludging at sum auld Monk or Freir,
Perchance they will be our protectioun.
Or to Prelates make our progressioun,
Quhilks ar obleist to ow als weill as I:
Dame Sensual hes geuin directioun
ow till exclude out of my cumpany.

Chastity. Gif e wald wit mair of the verity,
I sall schaw ow be sure experience,
How that the Lords of Sprituality,
Hes baneist me, alace, fra their presence. Chastity passes to the Lords of
Spritualitie,
My Lords, laud, gloir, triumph and reverence,
Mot be unto our halie Sprituall stait:
I ow beseik of our benevolence,
To harbry me that am sa desolait**
* Lords I have past throw money uncouth schyre,
Bot in this Land I can get na ludgeing
Of my name gif e wald haif knawledging,
Forsooth my Lords they call me Chastity,
I ow beseik of our graces bening.
Gif me ludging this nicht for charity.

Spritualitie. Pas on Madame we know ow nocht
Or be him that the world wrocht,
our cumming sall be richt deir co^t
Gif e make langer tarry.

Abbot. But doubt we will both leif and die
With our luif Sensuality,
We will haif na mair deall with the,
Then with the Queen of Farie.

Person. Pas hame amang the Nunnis and dwell,
Quhilks ar of Chastity the well:
I traist they will with Buik and bell,
Ressaue ow in their Closter.

Chastity. Sir, quhen I was the Nunnis amang,
Out of their dortour they me dang,
And wald nocht let me bide sa lang,
To say my Pater noster.
I se na grace thairfoir to get,
I hauld it best or it be lait,
For till go prove the Temporal stait
Gif they will me resaif:
Gud-day my Lord Temporalitie,
And ow merchant of gravitie:
Full feign wald I have harberie,
To ludge amang the laif.

Tempora. Forsooth we wald be weil content,
To harbie ow with good intent,
War nocht we haif impediment:
For quhy we two ar maryit:
Bot wist our wyfis that e war heir,
They wald make all this town on steir:
Thairfoir we reid ow rin areir,
In dreid e be miscaryit.

Chastity. e men of craft of greit ingyne*
Gif me barbrie for Christis pyne:
And win Gods bennesone and mine,
And help my hungry heart:

Sowtar. Welcum be him that maid the Moon,
Till dwell with us till it be June:
We sall mend both our hois and schone,
And plainly tak our part.

Taylour. Is this fair Lady Chastity?
Now welcum be the Trinity:
I think it war ane great pity
That thou should ly thairout:
our great displeasour I forthink,
Sit down Madame and tak ane drink:
And let na sorrow in ow sink,
Bot let us play cap'out.

Sowtar. Fill in and play cap'out,
For I am wonder dry:
[]The Devil snyp aff their snout,
That haits this company.

Iennie. Hoaw mynnie, mynnie, mynnie.

Taylours wife. Quhat wald thou my deir dochter Iennie?
Iennie my Joy, quhair is thy dadie?

Ienny. Mary drinkand with ane lusty Lady,
Ane fair oung maiden cled in quhyte,
Of quhom my dadie taks delight,
Scho hes the the fairest form of face,
Furnischit with all kind of grace:
I traist gif I can reckon richt,
Scho schaips to ludge with him all nicht.

Sowt. wife. Quhat dois the Sowtar my gudman?

Iennie. Mary fillis the cap and turns the can.
Or he cum hame be God I trow
He will be drunkin like ane sow.

Taylours wife. This is ane greit dispyte I think,
For to resaue sic ane kow-clink:
Quhat is our counsel that we do?

Sowtars wife. Cummer this is my counsall lo*
Ding e the taken, and I the other.

Taylours wife. I am content be Gods mother.
I think for me they huirsone smaiks,
They serve richt weill to get their paiks.

And never to cum again in this cuntrie:
And gif scho dois but doubt scho sall repent,

And hes decryit at her command,

And with the King we sall be at concord,

Quhair he finds great debaits.
And sa far as I understand*

Evin all the thrie estaits.
God forth of heavin hes him send,
To punische all that dois offend
Against his Majesty
As lyks him best to tak vengence,
Sumtyme with Sword and Pestilence
With derth and poverty.
Bot quhen the peopill dois repent,
And beis to God obedient,
Then will he gif them grace:
Bot they that will nocht be correctit,

And fleimit from his face.

Or can begyll the landwart wyfes,
But me thairman Dissait.

And we two meit again this nicht,

Heir sal Dissait rin away with the Box throuch the wate^.
Divyne Correctioun. Beati qui esuriunt and sitiunt Iustitiam. Their ar the
words of the redoutit Roy,
The Prince of peace above all Kings King:
Quhilk hes me sent all cuntries to convoye,
And all misdoars dourlie to down thring.
I will do nocht without the conveining
Ane Parleament of the estaits all,
In their presence I sall but feineing
Iniquity under my Sword down thrall.
Their may no Prince do acts honorabill,
Bot gif his counsall thairto will assist:
How may he know the thing may profitabil,
To follow vertew and vycis to resist:
Without he be instructit and solist:
And quhen the King stands at his counsel sound,
Then wealth sall wax and plenty as he list,
And policy sall in his Realm abound.
Gif any list my name for till inquyre,
I am callit Divine CORRECTIOVN*
I fled throch money uncouth land and schyre,
To the greit profit of ilk Natioun.
Now am I cum into this Regioun,
To teill the ground that hes been lang vnsawin:
To punische tyrants for their transgressioun,
And to cause leill men live upon their awin.
Na Realm nor Land but my support may stand
For I gar Kings live into Royalty:
To rich and puir I beir ane equal band,
That they may live into their awin degrie.
Quhair I am nocht is no tranqullitie
Be me tratours and tyrants ar put down:
Quha thinks na schame of their iniquity
Till they be punisched be me Correctioun,
Quhat is ane King nocht bot ane officiar,
To cause his Leiges live in equity:
And under God to be ane punischer,
Of trespassours against his Majesty.
Bot quhen the King dois live in tyranny,
Breakand Justice for fear or affectioun:
Then is his Realm in weir and poverty,
With schamefull slauchter but correctioun.
I am ane Judge richt potent and seveir,
Cum to do Justice money thousand mile:
I am sa constant both in piece and weir,
Na bud nor favor may my sicht oversyle.
Their is thairfoir richt money in this I Will,
Of my repair but doubt that dois repent:
Bot verteous men I traist sall on me smyle,
And of my cumming sall be richt weill content.

Gu. cou^s. Welcum my Lord welcum ten thousand tyms
Till all faithful men of this Regioun,
Welcum for till correct all falts and cryms:
Amang this cankerd congregatioun.
Louse Chastity I make supplicatioun,
Put till fredome fair Lady Verity:
Quha be unfaithful folk of this Natioun,
Lyis bund full fast into Captivity.

Correctioun. I mervel Gude-counsell how that may be,
Ar e nocht with the King familiar?

Gude-counsell. That I am nocht my Lord, full wais me,
Bot like ane beggeram halden at the bar:
They play bo-keik evin as I war ane skar:
Their came thrie knaves in cleithing counterfeit
And fra the King they gart me stand affar.
Quhais names war Flattrie, Falset and Dissait.
Bot quhen they knaves hard tell of our cumming,
They staw away ilk ane ane sindrie gait.
And cuist fra them their counterfit cleithing,
For their leuing full weill they can debait:
The merchandmen they haif resauit Dissait.
As for Falset, my Lord, full weill I ken,
He will be richt weill treitit air and lait,
Amang the may part of the crafts men.
Flattrie hes taine the habit of ane Freir
Thinkand to begyll Spiritualitie.

Correctioun. But dout my friend and I live half ane eit
I sall search out that great iniquity.
Quhair lyis on Ladies in Captivity?
How now Sisters quha hes ow sa disgysit?

Verity. Unfaithful members of iniquity,
Dispytfullie, my Lord, hes us supprysit.

Correctioun. Gang put on Ladyis to their liberty
Incontinent and break down all the stocks:
But doubt they ar full deir welcum to me,
Make diligence, me think e do bot mocks
Speid hand and spair nocht for to break the locks*
And tenderly tak them up be the hand
Had I them heir they knaves should ken my knocks
That them oppressed and baneist aff the land.

They tak the Ladyis forth of the stocks, and Verity sall say. Verity. We
thank ou sir of our benignity,
Bot I beseik our majesty Royal:
That e wald pas to King Humanity.
And fleime from him on Lady Sensual,
And enter in his service Gude-counsell,
For e will find him very counsalabill.

Correctioun. Cum on Sisters as e haif said, I sall,
And gar him stand with ow thrie firm and stabill,

Correctioun passis toward the King with Verity Chastity and Gude-counsell.
Wantonness. Solace knawis thou not quhat I se?
Ane knicht or ellis ane king thinks me,
With wantoun wings as he wald fle,
Brother quhat may this meine?
I understand nocht be this day,
Quhidder that he be friend or fay:
Stand still and hear quhat he will say,
Sic ane I haif nocht seine.

Solace. on is ane stranger I stand forde,
He semes to be ane lusty Lord:
Be his heir-cumming for concord,
And be kind till our King:
He sall be welcome to this place,
And treatit with the Kingis grace:
Be it nocht sa, we sall him chase,
And to the devil him ding.

Placebo. I reid us put upon the King;
And walkin him of his sleiping:
Sir rise and se ane uncouth thing.
Get up, e ly too lang.

Sensuality. Put on our hude Iohne-Fule, e raif,
How dar e be so pertsir knaif
To tuich the King? sa Christ me saif,
Falls huirsone thou sall hang.

Correction. Get up sir King, e haif sleipit aneuch
Into the armis of Lady Sensual.
Be suit that mair belangis to the pleuch,
As efterward perchance rehears I sall.
Remember how the King Sardanapall,
Amang fair Ladies tuke his lust sa lang,
Sa that the may pairt of his Leiges al
Rebeld, and syne him duilfully down thrang.
Remember how into the time of Noy,
For the foull stinck and sin of lechery,
God be my wande did all the world destroy,
Sodom and Gomore richt sa full rigorously,
For that vyld sin war brunt in may cruelly.
Thairfoir I the command incontinent,
Banische from the that huir Sensuality,
Or else but doubt rudlie thou sall repent.

Rex. Be quhom have e sa greit authority?
Quha dois presume for til correct ane King?
Know e nocht me greit King Humanity?
That in my Regioun Royally dois ring.

Correct. I have power greit Princes to dou^ thring*
That lives contrair the Majesty Divyne
Against the treuth quhilk plainly dois maling,
Repent they nocht I put them to ruin.
I will begin at thee quhilk is the head,
And make on the first reformatioun,
Thy Leiges than will follow the but pleid,
Swyith harlot hence without dilatioun.

Sensuality. My Lord I make ow supplicatioun,
Gif melicence to pas again to Rome:
Amang the Princes of that Natioun,
I lat ow wit my fresche beauty will blume
Adieu Sir King I may na langer tarry,
I cair nocht that, als good luife cums as gais,
I recommend ow to the Queen of Farie.
I se e will be gydit with my fais,
As for this king I cure him nocht two strais:
War I amang Bischops and Cardinals,
I wald get gould, silver and precious clais,
Na earthly joy but my presence avails.
Heir sall scho pas to Spiritualitie. My Lords of the Sprituall stait,
Venus preserve ow air and lait:
For I can make na mair debait,
I am partit with our king:
And am baneischt this Regioun,
Be counsel of Correctioun:
Be e nocht my protectioun,
I may seik my ludgeing.

Spiritualitie. Welcum our dayis darling,
Welcum with all our heart:
We all but feineing,

Heir sal the Bishops, Abbots and Persons kis the Ladies. Correctioun. Sen e ar

Resaue into our service Gude-counsall:
And richt sa this fair Lady Chastity,
Till e mary sum Queen of blude-royall.
Observe then Chastity matrimonial,
Richt sa resaue Verity be the hand,
Use their counsel our fame sall never fall,
With them thairfoir make ane perpetual band.
Heir sall the King resaue counsel Verity and Chastity. Now sir tak tent
quhat I will say,
Observe their same both nicht and day,
And let them never part ow fray.
Or else withoutin doubt:
Turn e to Sensuality,
To vicious life and rebaldrie,
Out of our Realm richt schamefullie,
e sall be ruttit out.
As was Tarquine the Roman King,
Quha was for his vicious living
And for the schamefull ravisching
Of the fair chaist Lucres,
He was digraidit of his croun,
And baneist aff his Regioun:
I maid on him correctioun,
As stories dois expres.

Rex. I am content to our counsall t'inclyne
e beand of good conditioun.
At our command sall be all that is mine,
And heir I gif ow full commissioun,
To punische faults and gifremissioun,
To all vertew I salbe consociabill,
With ow I sall confirm ane vnioun,
And at our counsall stand ay firm and stabill.

The king embraces Correction with a humbil countenance* Correctioun. I
counsall ow incontinent,
To gar proclaim ane Parliament,
Of all the thrie estaits.
That they be heir with diligence,
To make to ow obedience,
And syne dres all debaits.

Hoaw Diligence cum heir fra hand,
And tak our informatioun:

In gudlie haist for to compeir
In their may honorabill maneir,
To gif us their counsals:

That they sall underly the law,
And punischt be that fails.

Diligence. Sir I sall both in bruch and land,
With diligence do our command,
Upon my awin expens:
Sir I have servit ow all this eir,
Bot I gat never ane dinneir
it for my recompense.

Rex. Pas on and thou salbe regairdit,
And for thy service weill rewairdit,
For quhy with my consent,
Thou sall have eirly for thy hyre,
The teind mussellis of the ferrie mire,
Confirmit in Parliament.

Diligence. I will get riches throw that rent,
Ester the day of Dume:
Quhen in the colpots of Tranent,
Butter will grow on brume.
All nicht I had sa meikill drouth,
I micht nocht sleip ane wink
Or I proclaim ocht with my mouth,
But doubt I man haif drink.

Correctioun. Cum heir Placebo and Solace,
With our companeoun Wantonness,
I know weill our conditioun:
For tysting King Humanity,
To resaue Sensuality,
e man suffer punitioun.

Wanton. We grant my lord we have done ill,
Thairfoir we put us in our will,
Bot we haife been abusit:
For in gudefaith Sir we beleifit,
That lechery had na man greifit,
Because it is sa vsit.

Placebo. e se how Sensuality,
With Principals of ilk cuntrie,

And with our Prelatis mair and les,
Speir at my Lady Priores,
Giflechery be sin.

Solace. Sir we sall mend our conditioun,
Sa e give us remissioun,
Bot give us live to sing:
To dance, to play at Chesse and Tabils,
To reid Stories and mirrie fabils,
For pleasure of our King.

Correctioun. Sa that e do navther crime,
e sall be pardon it at this time,
For quhy* as I suppois
Princes may sumtyme seik solace,
With mirth and lawful mirrines,
Their spirits to reioyis.
And richt sa Halking and Hunting,
Ar honest pastimes for ane King,
Into the time of peace:
And leirne to rin ane heavy spear*
That he into the time of wear,
May follow at the cheace.

Rex. Quhair is Sapience and Discretioun?
And quhy cums nocht Devotioun nar?

Verity. Sapience sir was ane very loun,
And Discretioun was nathing war:
The suith Sir, gif I wald report,
They did begyle our Excellence:
And wald not suffer to resort
Ane of us thrie to our presence.

Chastity. They thrie war Flattrie and Dissait,
And Falset that unhappy loun:
Against us thrie quhilk maid debait,
And baneischt us from town to town.
They gart us two fall into sown,
Quhen they us lockit in the stocks:
That dastart knave Discretioun,
Full thifte ouslie did steill our Box.

Rex. The Devil tak them sen they ar gane,
Me thocht them ay thrie very smaiks,

Quhen I them find thays bear their paiks,
I se they have playit me the glaiks,
Gude-counsall now schaw me the best*
Quhen I fix on ow thrie my staiks,
How I sall keip my Realm in rest.

Initium sapientiae est timor Domini. Gud-coun. Sir, gif our hienes earnis lang
to ring,
First dread our God abuif all other thing.
For e ar bot ane mortal instrument,
To that great God and King Omnipotent.
Preordinat be his divine Majesty,
To reull his peopill intill unity,
The principal point Sir of ane kings office,
Is for to do to euerilk man justice.
And for to mix his justice with mercy,
But rigor, favor or parcialitie.
Forsooth it is na littill observance,
Great Regions to have in governance?
Quha ever taks on him that kingly cuir,
To get ane of thirtwa he should be suir:
Great pain and labor, and that continual,
Or ellis to have defame perpetual.
Quha guydis weill they win immortal fame,
Quha the contrair, they get perpetual schame,
After quhais death but dout ane thousand eir
Their life at lenth rehearst sall be perqueir.
The Chroniklis to know Iow exhort,
Their sall e find both good and evil report:
For every Prince after his quality,
Thocht he be deid, his deids sall never die.
Sir gif e please for to use my counsall,
our fame and name sall be perpetual.

Heir sall the messinger Diligence return and cry a Hoyes, a Hoyes, a Hoyes,
and say. At the command of King Humanity,
I wairne and charge all members of Parliament:
Both sprituall stait and Temporalitie,
That till his Grace they be obedient,
And speid them to the Court incontinent,
In good ordour array it royally,
Quha beis absent or inobedient
The Kings displeasure they sall underly.
And als I make ow exhortatioun,
Sen e haifheard the first pairt of our play:
Go tak ane drink, and make Collatioun,
Ilk man drink till his marrow, I ow pray.
Tarry nocht lang, it is lait in the day,
Let sum drink Ayle and sum drink Claret wine:
Be great Doctors of Physic I hear say,
That michtie drink comforts the dull ingine.
[] And e Ladies that list to pisch,
Lift up our taill, plat in ane disch:
And gif that our mawkine cryis quhisch,
Stop in ane wusp of stray.
Let nocht our bladder burst I pray ow,
For that war euin aneuch to slay ow:
For it their is to cum, I say ow,
The best pairt of our Play.

The END of the first part of the SATYR.
Now sall the pepill make Collatioun, then beginnis the Interlude, the Kings,
Bischops and principal players being out of their seats. Pauper, the pure man.
OF our almis good folks for Gods luife of heavin,
For I have motherles bairns either sax or seavin:
Gif e'ill gif me na good for the luife of Jesus,
Wische me the richt way till Sanct-Androes.

Diligence. Quhair have we gottin this gudly companeoun?
Swyith out of the field falls raggit loun.

Quhen sic ane vilde beggar Carle may get entres.
Fie on ow officiars that mends nocht their failies,

Without e cum and chase this Carle away
The Devil a word e'is get mair of our play.
Falls huirsun raggit Carle, quhat Devil is that thou rugs

Pauper. Quha Devil maid the ane gentill man that wald cut not thy lugs?

Dili. Quhat now? me thinks the carle begins to crack,
Swyith carle away or be this day Ise break thy back. Heir sall the Carle clim

Pauper. Now sweir be thy brunt schinis the Devil ding them fra the.
Quhatsay e till their court dastards be they get hail clais
Sa sune as they leir to sweir and trip on their tais.

Di. Me thocht the carle callit me knave evin in my face
Be Sanct Fillane thou salbe slane, bot gif thou ask grace:
Loup down or be the good Lord thou sall los thy heid.

Paup. I sal anis drink or I ga thocht thou had sworn my deid.

For their is richt lytill play at my hungry heart.

Dil. Shaw me thy matter man with all the circumstances*
How that thou hes happinit on their unhappy chances.

Pauper. Gude-man will e gif me of our Charity
And I sall declair ow the black verity.
My father was ane auld man and ane hoir,
And was of age fourscoir of eirs and moir.
And Mald my mother was fourscoir and fyfteine,
And with my labor I did them both sustain.
We had ane Meir that caryit salt and coill,
And every ilk eir scho brocht us hame ane foill.
We had thrie ky that was both fat and fair,
Nane tydier into the town of air.
My father was sa waik of blude and bane,
That he deit, quhairfoir my mother maid great maine
Then scho deit within ane day or two,
And their began my poverty and woe.
Our good gray Meir was baittand on the field,
And our Lands lord tuik her for his hyreild
The Vickar tuik the best Cow be the head,
Incontinent quhen my father was deid.
And quhe^ the Vickar hard tell how that my mother*
Was dead, fra* hand he tuke to him ane other,
Then Meg my wife did murne both evin and morrow
Till at the last scho deit for very sorrow:
And quhen the Vickar hard tell my wife was dead,
The third Cow he cleikit be the head.
Their vmest clayis that was of rapploch gray,
The Vickar gart his Clark bear them away.
Quhen all was gain I micht make na debeat
Bot with my bairns past for till beg my meat.
Now have I tald ow the blak verity,
How I am brocht into this misery.

Dil. How did ye person, was he not thy good friend?

[] Pau. The devil stick him, he cursed me for my teind
And halds me it under that same process
That gart me want the Sacrament at Pasche.
In gudefaith sir, thocht he wald cut my throt,

Quhilk I purpois to gif ane man of law.

Diligence. Thou art the daftest fuill that ever I saw*
Trows thou man be the law to get remeid,
Of men of kirk* na nocht till thou be deid.

Paup. Sir be quhat law tell me quhairfoir or quhy?
That ane Vickar sold tak fra me thrie ky.

Diligence. They have na law except and consuetude,
Quhilk law to them is sufficient and good.

Paup. Ane consuetude against the common weill,
Sold be na law I think besweit Sanct Geill.
Quhair will e find that law tell gif e can?
To tak thrie ky fra ane pure husband man.
Ane for my father, and for my wife ane other,
And the third Cow he tuke fra Mald my mother.

Diligence. It is their law all that they have in use
Thocht it be Cow, Sow, Ganer, Gryse or Guse,

Pauper. Sir I wald speir at ow ane questioun,
Behauld sum Prelates of this Regioun,
Manifestly during their lusty* lyfis,
[] They swyfe Ladies, Madinis and other men's wyfis.
And sa their cunts they have in consuetude,
Quhidder say e that law is evil or good?

Dil. Hald thy tongue man, it seims that thou war mangit,
Speik thou of Priests but doubt thou will be hangit.

Pauper. Be him that buir the cruel Croun of thorn,
I cair nocht to be hangit evin the morn.

Diligence. Be sure of Preistis thou will get na support,

Pauper. Gif that be true the seind resaue the sort.
Sa sen I se I get na other grace,
I will ly down and rest me in this place.

Pauper lyis down in the field, Pardoner enters. Pardoner. Bona dies, Bona

Now tarry ane lytill quhyll I pray ow,
Till I be with ow knawin:
Wait e weill how I am namit?

Ane perfect public pardoner
Admittit be the Paip:
Sirs I sall schaw ow for my wage
My pardons and my pilgramage,
Quhilk e sall se and graip:
I give to the devil with good intent,
This vnsell wickit New Testament.
With them that it translait it:
Sen layik men knew the verity,
Pardoners gets no charity,
Without that they debait it.
Amang the wives with wrinks and wyles,
As all my marrowis, men begyles,
With our fair falls flattrie:
ea all the crafts I ken perqueir,
As I was teichit be ane Freir,
Callit Hypocrisy.
Bot now allace, our greit abusioun
Is cleirlie knawin till our confusioun,
That we may sair repent:
Of all credence now I am quyte,
For ilk man halds me at dispyte,
That reids the New-test'ment.
Duill fell the brain that hes it wrocht,
Sa fall them that the Buik hame brocht:
Als I pray to the Rude
That Martin Luther that falls loun,
Black Bullinger and Melancthoun,
Had been smorde in their cude.
Be him that buir the crown of thorn,
I wald Sanct Paull had never been borne,
And als I wald his bulks:
War never red in the kirk,
Bot amangs freirs into the mirk,
Or riuen amang ruiks.
Heir sall he lay down his geir upon ane buird and say* My patent pardouns e

Cumfra the Cave of Tartarie,
VVeill sealed with oster-schellis.
Thocht e have na contritioun;

With help of Buiks and bellis.
Heir is ane relict lang and braid,
Of fine Macoull the the richt chaft blaid,
With teith and al togidder:
Of Collings cow heir is ane horn,
For eating of Makconnals corn,
Was slain into Baquhidder.
Heir is ane coird both great and lang,
Quhilk hangit Iohne the Armistrang,
Of good hemp soft and sound:
Good halie peopill I stand for'd,
Quha ever beis hangit with this cord,
Neids never to be dround.

The gruntill of Sanct Antonis sow,
Quhilk buit his haly bell:
Quha ever he be heiris this bell clinck,

He sall never gang to hell.
Without he be of Baliell borne,

Cum tak my dispensatioun:
Of that cummer I sall make ow quyte,
How be it our selfis be in the wit,
And make ane falls narratioun.
Cum win the pardoun now letse,
For meill, for malt or for money,
For cok, hen, guse or gryse:
Of relicts heir I have ane hunder,
Quhy cum e nocht this is ane wonder?
I trow e be nocht wise.

Sowtar. Welcum hame Robert Rome-raker,

To pairt me and my wickit wife,
And me deliver from sturt and strife,

Bot five schillings and my schaipping knyfe,
That sall e have but sune.

Pardoner. Quhat kind of woman is thy wife,

Sowtar. Ane quick Devil Sir, ane storm of strife,
Ane Frog that fyles the wind:
[]Ane fistand flag, a flagartie fuffe,
At ilk ane pant scho lets ane puff,
And hes na ho behind.
All the lang day scho me dispyts,
And all the nicht scho flings and flyts,
Thus sleip I never ane wink:
That Cockatrice, that commoun huir,
The mekill Devil may nocht in duir

Sowtars wife. Theif carle thy words I hard rycht weill
In faith my freindschip e sall feill,
And I the fang:

[]Howbeit that swingeour can not swyfe,

Ane cuppill of sarks with all my heart,

Pardoner. To part sen e ar both content,

Slip down our hois, me thinkis the carle is glaikit,

For I have fund ane great horse bane,

Good for the fever quartane:

All the wyfis will both kis and kneill,

And sum sayis e ar for certain

But doubt e will be hangit.

Quhair e will be weill treatit.

Scho will defend ow with her hands,
And womanly debait it.

To keip silence and be patient I pray ow,
Howbeit we speik be adulatioun,

As feineit falls flattrand Saracens.

And of our pastyme make ane falls report.
Quhat may we do bot tak in patience?
And us refer unto the faithful sort.

And be sure of how money thousand speirs,
The King may be quhen he hes ocht ado,
For quhy my Lords this is my ressoun to.
The husband men and commons they war wont,
Go in the battle formest in the front*
Bot I have tint all my experience,
Without e make sum better diligence:
The Common-weill mon other wayis be styllit*
Or be my faith the King will be begyllit.
Their pure commouns daily as e may se,
Declynisdoun till extreme poverrie:
For sum ar hichtit sa into their maill,
Their winning will nocht find them water kaill.
How Prelates heichts their teinds it is weill knawin,
That husbandmen may not weill hald their awin.
And now begins ane plague amang them new,
That gentill men their steadings taks in rue.
Thus man they pay great ferme or lay their steid,
And sum ar plainly harlit out be the heid,
And ar distroy it without God on them rue.

[] Paup. Sir be Gods breid that taill is very true.
It is weill kend I had both nolt and horse,
Now all my geir e se upon my cors.
Correction, Or I depairt I think to make ane ordour

Iohne. I pray ow sir begin first at bordour.
For how can we send us aganis Ingland
Quhen we can nocht within our native Land,
Destroy our awin Scots, common trator theifis,
Quha to leill laborers daily dois mischeifis.
[] War I ane King my Lord be Gods wounds,
Quha ever held common theifis within their bounds:
Quhairthrow that daily leilmen micht be wrangit
Without remeid their chiftanis should be hangit,
Quhidder he war ane knicht, ane Lord or Lord
The Devil draw me to hell and he war spaird.

Tempora. Quhat other enemies hes thou let us ken?

Iohne. Sir I compleine upon the idill men:
For quhy sir it is Gods awin bidding
All Christian men to wirk for their living.
Sanct Paull that pillar of the Kirk,
Sayis to the wretchis that will not wirk
And been to vertews laith
Qui non laborat non manducet. This is in Inglische tongue or leit:
Quha labouris nocht he sall not eit.
This been against the strange beggars,
Fiddlers, pypers, and pardoners:
Their Iugglars, Iestars, and idill cuitchours,
Their carriers and their quintacensours:
Their babil-beirers and their bairds,
Their sweir swyngeours with Lords and Lairds:
Ma then their rents may sustain,
Or to their profeit neidfull been,
Quhilk been ay blythest of discords,
And*deidly feid amang thar Lords.
For then they sleutchers man be treatit*
Or else their querrels vndebaitit.
This been against their great fat Freiris,
Augustenes, Carmleits and Cordeleirs:
And all vthers that in cowls been cled,
Quhilk labors nocht and been weill fed.
I mein nocht laborand Spirituallie,
Nor for their living corporally:
Lyand in dennis like idill doggis
I them compair to weil fed hoggis*
I think they do them selfis abuse,
Seeing that they the world refuse:
Haifing professed sic poverty,
Syne fleis fast fra necessity.
Quhat gif they poverty wald profess?
And do as did Diogenes,
That great famous Philosophour,
Seeing in earth bot vain labor,
Alutterlie the world refusit,
And in ane tumbe him self inclusit,
And leifit on herbs and water cauld,
Of corporal fude na mair he wald.
He trottit nocht from town to town,
Beggand to feid his carioun.
Fra time that life he did profes,
The wald of him was cummerles.
Rycht sa of Marie Magdalene,
And of Mary th'Egyptiane:
And of auld Paull the first Hermeit,
All their had poverty compleit.
Ane hundredth ma I micht declair,
Bot to my purpois I will fair:
Concluding sleuthfull idilnes,
Against the Common-weill express.

Correctioun. Quhom upon ma will e compleine?

Iohne. Marie on ma and ma again.
For the pure peopill cryis with cairis,
The infetching of Justice airis:
Exercit mair for couetice,
Then for the punisching of vice.
Ane peggrell theif that steillis ane kow,
Is hangit* bot he that steillis ane bow
With als meikill geir as he may turs,
That theif is hangit be the purs.
Sic pykand peggrall theifis ar hangit,
Bot he that all the world hes wrangit,
Ane cruel tyrane ane strange transgressour,
Ane common public plain oppressor,
By buds may he obtain favors
Of Tresurers and compositours.
Thocht he serve greit punitioun,
Gets easy compositioun:
And throch laws consistoriall
Prolixt, corrupt and perpetual.
The common peopill ar put sa under,
Thocht they be puir it is na wonder.

Correction. Good Iohne I grant all that is true*

To put my sword to executioun,
And make on ow extreme punitioun.
Mairover my Lord Spiritualitie,
In gudlie haist I will that e

To men that labors with their hands.

Quhair throch the policy may incresse.

Of all our cryms that are bygaine

And heir we make to ow conditioun,

From henceforth till our lives end.

And make with him perpetual band. Heir sall the temporal staits, to wit, the

Haifand oung infants two or thrie:
And hes two ky but any ma,
The Vickar most haif ane of they:
With the gray frugge that covers the bed,
Howbeit the wise be purelie cled,
And gif the wife die on the morn,
Thocht all the bairns sold be forlorn,
The other kow he cleiks away
With the pure cot of raploch gray.
Wald God this custom war put down,
Quhilk never was found it be ressoun.

Temporal. Ar all they tails true that thou tells?

[] Pauper. True sir, the Divill stick me else*
For be the halie Trinity,
That same was practeisit on me.
For our Vickar God give him pyne,
Hes it thrie tydie kye of mine.
Ane for my father and for my wife ane other,
And the third cow he tuke for Mald my mother.

Bot to ressaue his teinds and spend them syne.
Howbeit he be obleist be good ressoun,
To preich the Evangell to his parochoun.
Howbeit they should want preiching sevintin eir.
Our Persoun will not want ane scheif of beir.

Pau. Our bishops with their lusty rokats quhyte,
They flow in riches royally and delight
Like Paradise bend their palices and places,
And wants na pleasour of the fairest faces.
Als their Prelates hes great prerogatyues,
For quhy they may depairt ay with their wives:
Without any correctioun or damnage,
Syne tak ane other wantoner but marriage*
But doubt I wald think it ane pleasant life,
Ay on quhen I list to part with my wife.
Syne tak ane other of far greiter beauty,
Bot ever alace my Lords that may not be,
For I am bund alace in marriage,
Bot they like rams rudlie in their rage.

And all they words ar herisie in deid,

And that I offer on thy pallet to preif it.

Of Kirk-men to speik sic detractioun.

Pau. The feind resaue them that first devysit that law
Within an hour after my dade was deid
The Vickar had my kow hard be the heid.

Person. Falls huirsun carle I say that law is good,
Because it hes been lang our consuetude:

Pauper. Quhen I am Paip that law I sal put down
It is ane sair law for the pure commoun.

Spritu. I make an vow they words thou sal repent.

Counsall. I ow require my Lords be patient.
We came nocht heir for disputatiouns,
We came to make good reformatiouns.
Heirfoir of this our propositioun,
Conclude and put to executioun.

Mer. My Lords conclud that all the temporal lands
Be set in few to laboreris with thait hands.
With sic restrictiouns as sall be devysit,
That they may live and nocht to be supprysit.
With ane ressonabill augmentatioun,
And quhen they heir ane proclamatioun:
That the Kings grace dois make him for the weit,
That they be reddie with harneis, bow and speir.
As for my self my Lord this I conclude.

Coun. Sa say we all our ressoun be sa good.
To make ane Act on this we are content:

Iohne. On that sir Scribe I tak ane instrument.
Quhat do e of the corspresent and kow?

Counsall. I will conclude nathing of that as now
Without my Lord of Spiritualitie,
Thairto consent with all this haill clergy.
My Lord Bischop will e thairto consent?

Spri. Na, na, never till the day of Judgment.
We will want nathing that we have in use,
Kirtil nor kow, teind lamb, teind gryse nor guse.

Tem. Forsooth my lord I think we suldconclude,
Seeing this kow e have in consuetude:
We will decerne heir that the Kings grace,
Sall write unto the Paipis holiness:
With his consent be proclamatioun,
Both corspresent and cow we sall cry down.

Spiri. To that my Lords we plainly disassent,
Noter their of I tak ane instrument.

Te^. My lord be him that all the world hes wrocht,
We set nocht by quhider e consent or nocht:
e ar bot ane estait and we are two,
Et vbi mayor pars ibi tota.
Ioh. My lords e haif richt prudentlie concludit,
Tak tent now how the land is clein denudit:
Of gould and silver quhilk daily gais to Rome,
For buds, mair then the rest of Christindome.
War I ane King sir be coks passioun,
I sold gar make ane proclamatioun.
That never ane penny sold go to Rome at all,
Na mair then did to Peter nor to Paull.
Da e nocht sa, heir for conclusioun
I gif ow all my braid black malesoun.

Merchant. It is of treuth sirs, be my christindome,
That mekil of our money gais to Rome.
For we merchants I wait within our bounds,
Hes furneist Priests ten hundredth thousand punds.
For their finnance, nane knawis sa weill as we:
Thairfoir my Lords devyse sum remedy.
For throw their playis and their promotioun,
Mair for denners nor for devotioun.
Sir Symonie hes maid with them ane band,
The gould of weicht they leid out of the land.
The Common-weil, their throch bein sair oppressed
Thairfoir devyse remeid as e think best.

Counsel. It is schort time sen any benefice,
Was sped in Rome except greit Bischopries.
Bot now for ane unworthy Vickarage,
Ane Priest will rin to Rome in Pilgramage.
Ane cavell quhilk was never at the scule,
Will rin to Rome and keip ane Bischops mule:
And syne cum hame with money colorit crack,
With ane buirdin of benefices on his back.
Quhilk been against the, law ane man alane,
For till posses ma benefices norane.
Their greit commends I say withoutin faill,
Sold nocht be given bot to the blude Royal:
Sa I conclude my Lords and sayis for me,
e sold annull all this plurality.

Spritualitie. The Paip hes given us dispensatiouns:

Counsall. ea that is be our falls narratiouns.
Thocht the Paip for our pleasour will dispense,
I trow that can nocht cleir our conscience.
Advysemy Lords quhat e think to conclude,

Temporalitie. Sir be my faith I think it very good,
That fra hence forth na Preistis sall pas to Rome.
Because our substance they do stillconsume.
For pleyis and for their profeit singulair,
They haif of money maid this realm bair.
And als I think it best be my advyse,
That ilk Priest sall haif bot ane benefice.
And gif they keip nocht that fundatioun,
It sall be cause of deprivatioun.

Merchant. As e haif said my Lord we will consent,
Scribe make ane act on this incontinent.

Couns. My Lords, their is ane thing it vnproponit
How Prelates and Preistis aucht to be disponit:
This beand done we have the les ado;
Quhat say e sirs* this is my counsall lo:
That or we end this present Parliament,
Of this matter to tak ripe advysement.
Mark weill my Lords, their is na benefice
Given to ane man, bot for ane good office.
Quha taks office and syne they can nocht vsit,
Giver and taker I say ar both abusit.
Ane Bischops office is for to be ane preichour,
And of the law of God ane public teachour.
Rycht sa the Person unto his parochoun,
Of the Evangell sold leir them ane lessoun.
Their sold na man desire sic dignities,
Without he be abill for that office.
And for that cause, I say without leising,
They have their teinds, and for na other thing.

Sp. Friend quhair find e that we should prechours be

Coun. Luik quhat Sanct Paul wryts unto Timothy
Tak their the Buik let se gif e can spell.

Spritual. I never red that, thairfoir reid it our sell.

Counsall sall read their wordis on ane Buik. Fidelis sermo, siquis Episcopatum
desiderat, bonum opus desiderat, oportet eum irreprehensibilem esse, vnius
vxoris virum, sobrium, prudentem, ornatum, pudicum, hospitalem, doctorem: non
vinelentum, non percussorem: sed modestum. That is This is a true saying, If
any man desire the office of a Bishop, he desires a worthy work: A Bishop
therefore must be unreprovable, the husband of one wife, etc.


Spiritualitie. e temporal men be him that heryit hell,

Temporalitie. Sit still my Lord, e neid not for til braull,
Their ar the very words of th'Apostill Paull.

Spir. Sum sayis be him that woare the croun of thorn,
It had been good that Paull had neir been borne.

Counsal. Bot e may know my Lord Sanct Paul's intent,
Schir red e never the New testament?

Spiritualitie. Na sir, be him that our Lord Jesus sauld,
I red never the New testament nor auld.
Nor ever thinks to do sir be the Rude,
I heir freiris say that reiding dois na good.

Counsel. Till ow to reid them I think it is na lack,
For anis I saw them both bund on our back:
That samin day that e was consecrat,
Sir, quhat meinis that?

[] Spiritualitie. The feind stick them that wat.

Merchant. Then befoir God how can e be excusit?
To haif ane office and waits not how to us it.
Quhairfoir war gifin ow all the temporal lands?
And all their teinds e haif amang our hands.
They war giuin ow for other causses I weine,
Nor mummil matins and hald our clayis cleine.

Bot e schaw nocht that into word nor deid.
The law is plain* our teinds should furnisch teichours:

Couns. ea that it sold, or sustain prudent preichours.

Pauper. Sir God nor I be stickit with ane knyfe,
Gif ever our Persoun preichit in all his life.

Pauper. Think e that e should have the teinds for nocht?

Person. Trowis thou to get remeid carle of that thing?

[] Pauper. ea be Gods breid richt sone war I ane King.

Person. Wald thou of Prelates make deprivatioun?

Pauper. Na I should gar them keip their fundatioun,
Quhat devil is this, quhom of sold Kings stand aw?
To do the thing that they sold be the law.
War I ane King be coks deir passioun,

Faileand thairof our grace sold richt sone find,
That Priests sall leid ow like ane belly blind*

Iohne. Quhat gif King David war leiuand in their dayis?
The quhilk did found sa money gay Abayis:
Or out of heavin quhat gif he luikit down?
And saw the great abominatioun:
Amang their Abesses and their Nunries,
Their public huirdomes and their harlotries,
He wald repent he narrowit sa his bounds,
Of eirlie rent thries coir of thousand pounds.
His successors maks litill ruisse I ges,
Of his devotioun or of his holiness.

Abbasse. How dar thou carle presume for to declair,
Or for to mell the with sa heich a matter?
For in Scotland their did it never ring,
I let the wit ane mair excellent King.
Of holiness he was the very plant,
And now in heavin he is ane michtfull Sanct.
Because that fyftein Abbasies he did found,
Quhair throw great riches hes ay done abound
Into our Kirk and daily it abunds,
Bot kings now I trow few Abbasies founds.
I dar weill say thou art condempnit in hell,
That dois presume with sic matters to mell.
Falls huirsun carle thou art ovir arrogant,
To judge the deids of sic ane halie Sanct.

Iohne. King James the first Roy of this Regioun,
Said that he was ane sair Sanct to the croun.
I heir men say that the was sumthing blind,
That gave away mair nor he left behind.
His successors that halines did repent,
Quhilk gart them do great inconvenient.

Abbas. My Lord Bishop I mervel how that e,
Suffer this carle for to speik heresy?
Forbe my faith my Lord will e tak tent,
He servis for to be brunt incontinent.
e can nocht say bot it is heresy,
To speik against our law and liberty.

Spritualitie. Sancte pater I make ow supplicatioun,
Exame on carle, syne make his dilatioun:

That bystour salbe brunt incontinent.

Of all the freirs of the four ordouris,
And make ow vagers on the bordours,
Schir will e give me audience,
And I sall schaw our excellence:
Sa that our grace will give me leife
How into God that I belief.

Corr. Schaw forth our faith and feign e nocht.

Iohne. I belief in God that all hes wrocht,
And creat every thing of nocht.
And in his Son our Lord Jesus,
Incarnat of the Virgin true:
Quha under Pilat tholit passioun,
And deit for our Salvatioun.
And on the third day raise again,
As halie scriptour schawis plane.
And als my Lord it is weill kend,
How he did to the heavin ascend:
And set him down at the richt hand,
Of God the father I understand.
And sall cum judge on Dumisday,
Quhat will e mair sir that I say?

Correctioun Schaw forth the rest, this is na game.

Iohne. I trow Sanctam Ecclesiam,

[] Sard up the ta raw and down the other,
The mekill Devil resaue the fidder.

Correctioun. Say quhat e will sirs be Sanct Tan,
Me think Iohne ane good Christian man.

Temporalitie. My Lords let be our disputatioun,
Conclude with firm deliberaioun.
How Prelates fra thine sall be disponit:

Merch. I think for me evin as e first proponit.
That the Kings grace sall gif na benefice,
Bot till ane peichour that can use that office.
The silly saul's that been Christis scheip,
Sold nocht be givin to gormand wolfis to keip.
Quhat been the cause of all the heresies,
Bot the abusioun of the prelacies?
They will correct and will nocht be correctit:
Thinkand to na prince they will be subiectit.
Quhairfoir I can find na better remeid,
Bot that their kings man take it in their heid.
That their be given to na man bischopries,
Except they preich out throch their diosies.
And ilk person priech in his parochon,
And this I say for final conclusion.

Tempora. We think our counsall is very good,
As e have said we all conclude.
Of this conclusioun Noter we make ane act:

Scrybe. I write all day bot gets never ane plack.

Pauper. Och, my Lords for the halie Trinity,
Remember to reform the consistory,
It hes mair neid of reformatioun,
Nor Ploutois court sir be coks passioun.

Pers. Quhat cause hes thou falls pellour for to pleine
Quhair was e ever summond to their seine?

Pa. Marie I lent my gossop my mear to fecth hame coills
And he her drounit into the querrell hollis.
And I ran to the Consistory for to pleine,
And their I happinit amang ane greidie meine.
They gave me first ane thing they call citandum,
Within aucht dayis I gat bot lybellandum*
Within ane month I gat ad opponendum,
In half ane eir I gat interloquendum,
And syne I gat, how call e it? ad replicandum:
Bot I could never ane word it understand him.
And than they gart me cast out many plackis,
And gart me pay for four and twenty actis.
Bot or they came half gait to concludendum,
The feind ane plack was left for to defend him.
Thus they postponit me two eir with their train,
Syne hodie ad octo bad me cum again.
And than their ruiks they roupit wonder fast,
For sentence silver they cry it at the last.
Of pronunciandum they maid me wonder feign,
Bot I gat never my good gray meir again.

Temp. My Lords we mon reform their consistory lawis,
Quhais great defame above the heavins blawis.
I wist ane man in persewing ane kow,
Or he had done he spendit half ane bow.
Sa that the kings honor we may avance,
We will conclude, as they have done in France.
Let Sprituall matters pas to Spritualitie,
And Temporal matters to Temporalitie.
Quha faileis of this sall cost them of their good,
Scribe make ane act, for sa we will conclude.

Spritualitie. That act my Lords plainly I will declait,
It is again is our profeit singulair.
We will nocht want our profeit be Sanct Geill.
Temporalitie our profeit is against the Common weil
It salbe done my Lords as e have wrocht,
We cure nocht quhidder e consent or nocht.
Quhairfoir servis then all their Temporal Judges?
Gif temporal matters sold seik at ow refuges.
My Lord e say that e ar Sprituall,
Quhairfoir mell e than with things temporal?
As we have done conclude sa sall it stand,
Scribe put our Acts in ordour evin fra hand.

Spritualitie. Till all our acts plainly I disassent,
Notar thairof I tak ane instrument.

Heir sall Verity and Chastity make their plaint at the bar. Verity. My
Soverane I beseik our excellence,
Use Justice on Spritualitie:
The quhilk to us hes done great violence,
Because we did rehers the verity.
They put us close into Captivity,
And sa remanit into subiectioun:
Into great langour and calamity,
Till we war fred be King Correctioun.

Chaste. My lord I haif great cause for to complain,
I could get na ludging intill this land:
The Spiritual stait had me sa at disdane,
With Dame Sensual they have maid sic ane band.
Amang them all na freindschip sirs I fand,
And quhen I came the nobill innis amang,
My Iustie Lady Priores fra hand:
Out of her do rtour durlie scho me dang.

Verity. With the advyse sir of the Parliament,
Hairtlie we make ow supplicatioun:
Cause King Correctioun tak incontinent,
Of all this sort examinatioun.
Gif they be digne of deprivatioun,
e have power for to correct sic cases:
Chease the may cunning Clerks of this natioun,
And put mair prudent pastors in their places.
My prudent Lords I say that pure craftsmen,
Abufe sum Prelates ar mair for to commend:
Gar exame them and sa e sall sune ken,
How they in vertew Bischops dois transcend.

Scribe. Thy life and craft make to their Kings kend,
Quhat craft hes thou declair that to me plain?

Tail. Ane tailour sir that*can both make and mend,
I wait nane better into Dumbartane.

Scri. Quhairfoir of taileours beirs thou the still?

Taileour. Because I wait is nane within ane myll,
Can better use that craft as I suppois:
For I can make both doublit coat and hois.

Scri. How call they ou sir with the schaiping knife?

Sowtar. Ane sowtar sir, nane better into Fyfe.

Scribe. Tell me quhairfoir ane sowtar e ar namit?

Sowtar. Of that surname I neld nocht be aschamit.
For I can make schone brotekins and buittis,
Gif me the coppie of the Kings cuittis.
And e sall se richt sune quhat I can do:
Heir is my lasts and weill wrocht ledder lo*

Couns. O Lord my God this is an mervelous thing
How sic misordour in this Realm sold ring.
Sowtars and tail ours they ar far mair expert
In their pure craft and in their handie art,
Nor ar our Prelatis in their vocatioun:
I pray ow sirs make reformatioun.

Verit. Alace, alace, quhat gars their temporal Kings
Into the Kirk of Christ admit sic doings?
My Lords for lufe of Christ's passioun,
Of their ignorants make depriuatioun.
Quhilk in the court can*do bot flatter and fleich,
And put into their places that can preich.

And in their deid they do the contrary:

With ane schort sermon presently in this place:
And schaw the word of God vnfeineitlie,
And sinceirlie as God will give me grace.
Heir sall the Doctor pas to the pulpit and say. Si vis ad vitam ingredi serva
mandata. Devoit peopill Sanct Paull the preichour sayis,
The fervent luife and father lie pity,
Quhilk God almichtie hes schawin money wayis
To man in his corrupt fragilitie,
Exceids all luife in earth, sa far that we
May never to God make recompense conding
As quhasa lists to reid the verity,
In halie Scripture he may find this thing.
Sic Deus dilexit mundum. Tuiching nathing the great prerogative,
Quhilk God to man in his creatioun lent:
How man of nocht creat superlatiue
Was to the Image of God omnipotent
Let us consider that special luife ingent,
God had to man quhen our foir-father fell,
Drawing us all in his loynis immanent,
Captive from gloir in thirlage to the hell.
Quhen Angels fell, their miserabil ruin
Was never restorit: bot for our misery,
The Sun of God secund person divyne,
In ane pure Virgin tuke humanity:
Syne for our saik great harmis suffered he
In fasting, walking, in preiching, cauld and heit,
And at the last ane schamefull death deit he,
Betwix two theifis on Croce he eild the Spreit:
And quhair an drop of his may precious blude
Was recompense sufficient and conding,
Ane thousand warlds to ransoun from that wod
Infernal feind, Satan, notwithstanding
He luifit us sa, that for our ransoning,
He sched forth all the blude of his body,
Riven rent and sair wondit quhair he did hing,
Naild on the Croce on the Mont Calvary.
Et copiosa apud eum redemptio. O cruel death, be the the venomous
Dragon, the Devil infernal lost his pray:
Be the the stinkand, mirk, contageous,
Deip pit of hell mankind escaipit fray.
Be the the port of Paradise alsway
Was patent maid unto the heavin sa hie:
Opinnit to man and maid ane reddie way,
To gloir eternal with th'haly Trinity.
And it for all thisluife incomparabill,
God askis na rewaird fra us again
Bot luife for luife: in his command but fabill,
Conteinit ar all haill the lawis ten:
Both ald and new and commandments ilk ane,
Luife been the ledder quhilk hes bot steppis two:
Be quhilk we may clim up to life again,
Out of this vaill of misery and wa.
Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto cord tuo and proximum tuum sicut teipsum:
in his duobus mandatis. etc. The first step suithlie of this ledder is,
To luife thy God as the fontaine and well
Of luife and grace: and the secund I wis,
To luife thy nichtbour as thou luifis thy sell,
Quha tynis ane stop of their two gais to hell,
Bot he repent and turn to Christ anon,
Hauld this na fabill, the halie Evangell
Bears in effect their words every one.
Si vis ad vitam ingredi serva mandata Dei. They tyne their steps all they quha
ever did sin
In pride, invy, in ire and lechery:
In covetice or any extreme win,
Into sweirnes or into gluttony.
Or quha dois nocht the deids of mercy,
Gif hungry meit and gif the naikit clayis.

Pers. Now walloway thinks thou na schame to lie*
[] I trow the Devil a word is true thou sayis:
Thou sayis their is bot two steppis to the heavin
Quha faileis them man backwarts fall in hell,
I wait it is ten thousand mylis and sevin
Gif it be na mair, I do it upon thy sell.
Schort leggit men I se be Bryds bell,
Will nevir cum their, they steppis been sa wide:
Gif they be the words of the Evangell,
The Sprituall men hes mister of ane gyde.

Abbot. And I belief that cruikit men and blind,
Sall never get up upon sa hich ane ledder:
By my good faith I dreid to ly behind,
Without God draw me up into ane tedder.
Quhat and I fall, than I will break my bledder:
[] And I cum their this day the Devil speid me:
Except God make me lichter nor ane fedder,
Or send me down good Widcok wingis to fly.

Person. Cum down dastart and gang sell draiff,
I understand nocht quhat thou said.
Thy words war nather corn nor caiff,
I wald thy tongue again war laid*
Quhair thou sayis pride is deidlie sin,
I say pride is bot honesty.
And Covetice of warldlie win
Is bot wisdom, I say for me.
Ire, hardines and gluttony,
Is nathing ellis but lyfis fude:
The natural sin of lechery
Is bot true luife, all their ar good.

Doctor. God and the Kirk hes giuin command,
That all good Christian men refuse them:

Person. Bot war they sin I understand,
We men of Kirk wald never use them.

Doctor. Brother I pray the Trinity,
our faith and charity to support:
Causand ow know the verity,
That e our subjects may comfort.
To our prayers peopill I recommend,
The rewlars of this nobill regioun:
That our Lord God his grace mot to them send,
On trespassours to make punitioun.
Prayand to God from feinds ow defend,
And of our sins to gif ow full remissioun:
I say na mair, to God I ow commend.

First Licent. Traist e that they will be inobedient,
To that quhilkis* decreitit in Parliament?

Diligen. They se the Paip with awful ordinance
Makis weir against the michtie King of France:
Richt sa they think that prelates should nocht sunie
Be way of deid defend their patrimony.

First Lice. I pray the brother gar me understand,
Quhair ever Christ possessit ane fut of land.

For Christ Jesus was King of Israel.

Fir. Li. I grant that christ was king abuse al kings
Bot he mellit never with temporal things:
As he hes plain lie done declair him sell,
As thou may reid in his halie Evangell.
Birds hes their nests, and tods hes their den,
Bot Christ Jesus the Savior of men
In all this world hes nocht ane penny braid,
Quhair on he may repois his heavinlie head.

Diligence. And is that true? --
-- es brother be Alhallows:
Christ Jesus had na property bot the gallows.
And left not quhen he eildit up the Spreit,
To by himself ane simpill winding scheit.

Diligence. Christ's successors I understand,
Thinks na schame to have temporal land.
Father they have na will I ow assure,
In this world to be indigent and pure:
Bot sir sen e ar callit sapient,

Quhy that my lusty Lady Verity,
Hes nocht been weill treatit in this cuntrie?

Batcheler. Forsooth quhair Prelates uses the counsall
Of beggand freirs in money regioun,
And they Prelates with Princes principal,
The verity but doubt is trampit down.
And Common-weill put to confusioun.
Gif this be true to ow I me report:
Thairfoir my Lords make reformatioun,
Or e depart hairtlie I ow exhort:
Sirs, freirs wald never I ow assure,
That any Prelates vsit preiching:
And Prelates tuke on them that cure,

And that incontinent:
Do e nocht sa withoutin weir,

I know his false intent.
on Priores withoutin fabill,

For Christis regioun.
To begin reformatioun,

This is my opinioun.

First Serge. Sir pleis e that we two invaid them,
And e sall se us sone degraid them,
Of coill and chaplarie?

And fra all humane law:

Secund Sergeant. Tak e the hude and I the gown,

Haulds them at their exemptioun,
And na man will obey:

Both fra Paip, king and Empreour,
And that maks all the pley.

Secund Sergeant. On Dumisday quhen Christ sall say
Venite benedicti: The Freirs will say without delay
Nos sumus exempts.
Heir sall they spuile Flattrie of the Freirs habit. Gude-counsell. Sir be the

And that within ane lytill space,
Ane new pavin of France.
Heir sall they spuile the Priores and scho sall have ane kirtill of silk under

Priores. I gif my friends my malisoun,
That me compellit to be ane Nun
And wald nocht let me marie:
It was my friends greadines,

Now hartlie them I wary.
Howbeit that Nunnis sing nichts and dayis,
Their heart waitis nocht quhat their mouth sayis
The suith I ow declair:
Makand ow intimatioun,
To Christis congregatioun,
Nunnis ar nocht necessair*
Bot I sall do the best I can,
And marie sum good honest man,
And brew good aill and tun:
Marriage be my opinioun,
It is better Religoun,
As to be freir or Nun.

Flat. fre. My Lords for Gods saik let not hang me
Howbeit that widdiefows wald wrang me

Because they ar nocht necessair,
And als they think they ar contrair,
To Iohne the common-weill.

That all their Prelates sall deprivit be,
And be decreit of this present Paliament,

Immediately their places sall posses:
Because that they have been sa negligent,
Suffering the word of God for till decres.

Bot this false world is turnit top ouir taill:

To win our meat we man make other schift.

Person. Gif with our labor we man us defend,
Then let us gang quhair we war never kend.

For by their counsall I have been confusit.

And they ar both contractit be the Rude,

For I am oung and thinks to pas to France.

With the avyce of the estaits thrie
Sall manfully defend and fortify
The Kirk of Christ and his Religioun,
Without dissimulance or hypocrisy:
Under the pain of their punitioun.
2.
Als they will that the Acts honorabill,
Maid be our Prince in the last Parliament,
Because they ar both good and profitabill,
They willl that every man be diligent
Them till observe with vnseineit intent.
Quha disobey is inobedientlie
Be their law is but doubt they sall repent*
And painis conteinit thairin sall underly.
3.
And als the Common-weil for til advance,
It is statute that all the Temporal lands,
Be set in few after the form of France
Til verteous men that labors with their hands*
Resonabillie restrictit with sic bands,
That they do service nevertheles
And to besubiect ay under the wands:
That riches may with policy incres.
4.
Item this prudent Parliament hes devysit,
Gif Lords halds under their dominioun
Theifis, quhair throch puir peopil bein supprisit:
For them they sall make answeir to the croun,
And to the pure make restitutioun:
Without they put them in the judges hands*
For their default to suffer punitioun,
Sa that na theifis remain within their lands.
5.
To that intent that Justice sold incres
It is concludit in this Parliament,
That into Elgin or into Innernesse
Sall be ane suit of Clarks sapient,
Togidder with ane prudent Precident
To do justice in all the Norther Airtis,
Sa equally without impediment,
That they neid nocht seik justice in their pairts.
6.
With license of the Kirks halines,
That justice may be done continually,
All the matters of Scotland mair and les,
To their two famous saits perpetually
Salbe directit, because men seis plainly,
Their wantoun Nunnis ar na way necessair,
Till Common-weill nor it to the glory
Of Christ's Kirk, thocht they be fat and fair.
And als that fragill ordour feminine,
Will nocht be missit in Christ's Religioun,
Their rents vsit till ane better fine:
For Common-weill of all this Regioun.
Ilk Senature for that erectioun,
For the vphalding of their gravitie
Sall have five hundredth mark of pensioun.
And also bot two sall their nummer be
Into the North saxteine sall their remain,
Saxtein rycht sa in our may famous town
Of Edinburgh to serve our Sovereign:
Chosen without partial affectioun
Of the may cunning Clarks of this Regioun:
Their Chancellar chosen of ane famous Clark,
Ane cunning man of great perfectioun,
And for his pensioun have ane thousand mark.
7.
It is devysit in this Parliament,
From this day forth na matter Temporal
Our new Prelates thairto hes done consent
Cum befoir Judges consistoriall,
Quhilk hes been sa prolixt and partial:
To the great hurt of the community:
Let Temporal men seik Judges Temporal*
And Sprituall men to Spritualitie.
8.
Na benefice beis giffin in time cumming,
Bot to men of good eruditioun:
Expert in the halie Scripture and cunning,
And that they be of good conditioun:
Of public vices but suspitioun,
And qualefiet richt prudentlie to preich,
To their awin folk both into land and town
Or ellis in famous scuillis for to teich:
Als because of the great plurality
Of ignorant Priests ma then ane Legioun.
Qi hair throch of Teicheouris the heich dignity,
Is vilipendit in ilk Regioun*
Thairfoir our Court hes maid provisioun,
That na Bshops make teichours in time cumming:
Except men of good eruditioun,
And for Preistheid qualefeit and cunning*
Siclyke as e se in the borrows town
Ane Taileour is nocht sufferit to remain,
Without he can make doublet, coat and gown,
He man gang till his prenteischip again:
Bischops sold nocht ressaue me think certain,
Into the Kirk except ane cunning Clark:
Ane idiot priest Esaias compaireth plain,
Till ane dum dog that can nocht byte nor bark.
10.
From this day forth se na Prelates pretend,
Under the pain of inobedience
At Prince or Paip to purchase ane command
Again the kow because it dois offense:
Till any Priest we think sufficience
And benefice for to serve God withal,
Two Prelatssall na man have from thence,
Without that he be of the blude Royal.
11.
Item this prudent counsall hes concludit,
Sa that our haly Vickars be nocht wraith
From this day forth they salbe clean denudit
Both of corspresent cow and vmest claith.
To pure commons because it has done skaith
And mairouer we think it lytill force,
Howbeit the Barrouns thairto will be laith,
From thine-furth they sall want their hyrald horse.
12.
It is decreit that in this Parliament
Ilk Bischop* Minister, Priour and Persoun*
To the effect they may tak better tent
To saulis under their dominioun,
After the form of their fundatioun,
Ilk Bischop in his Diosie sall remain:
And everilk Person in his parachoun,
Teiching their folk from vices to refrain.
13.
Because that clarks our substance dois consume
For bills and process of their prelacies:
Thairfoir their sall na money ga to Rome
From this day forth or any benefice:
Bot gif it be for greit Archbischopries,
As for the rest na money gais at all:
For the incressing of their dignities,
Na mair nor did to Peter nor to Paull.
14.
Considering yat our Priests for the may part
They want the gift of Chastity wese:
Cupido hes sa perst them throch the heart,
We grant them license and fry liberty,
That they may have fair Virgins to their wyfis:
And sa keip matrimonial Chastity,
And nocht in huirdome for to leid their lyfis.
15.
This Parliament richt sa hes done conclude
From this day forth our Barrouns temporal,
Sall na mair mix their nobil ancient blude
With bastard bairns of Stait Spiritual:
Ilk stait amang their awin selfis marie sall,
Gif Nobils marie with the Spritualitie,
From thine subject they salbe, and all
Sal be degraithit of their Nobility.
And from amang the Nobils cancellit:
Unto the time they by their liberty,
Rehabilit be the civil magistrate
And sa sall marie the Spiritualitie.
Bichops with bischops sall make affinity,
Abbots and Priors with the Priores:
As Bischop Annas in Scripture we may se,
Maryit his dochter on Bischop Caiphas.
Now have e heard the Acts honorabill,
Devysit in this present Parliament,
To Common-weill we think agreabill:
All faithful folk sold heirof be content,
Them till observe with hartlie true intent,
I wait nane will against our Acts rebel,
Nor till our law be inobedient,
Bot Plutois band the potent prince of hell.

To heid Dissait and hang his fellows.
And banische Flattrie aff the town,
For their was never sic ane loun.

And Saiffrone with Oyl-dolie.

To them I leirit that lair.

To schaip five quarters in ane goun,
In Angus and in Fyfe:

To steill ane silly stump or sleife,
Unto kittok his wife.

Of strange wesche scho will tak ane iurdane,

Fond Folly sall I be thy Clark,
And answeir the ay with amen:

Folly. Now at the beginning of my wark,
The feind ressaue that graceles grim.
Heir sal Folly begin her sermon, as followis. Stultorum numerus infinitus.
Solomon the may sapient King
In Israel quhan he did ring,
Their words in effect did write,
The number of fuillis ar infinite.
I think na schame sa Christ me saife,
To be ane fuill amang the laife,
Howbeit ane hundredth stands heir by,
Preventure als great fuillis as I.
Stultorum. I have of my Genelogie,
Dwelland in every cuntrie,
Earls, Duiks, Kings, and Empriours,
With money guckit Conquerours:
Quhilk dois in Folly perseveir,
And hes done sa this many eir.
Sum seiks to warldlie dignities,
And sum to sensual vanities
Quhat vails all their vain honors,
Nocht being sure to leife two houris?
Sum greidie fuill dois fill ane box,
Ane other fuill cummis and breaks the lox:
And spends that other fuillis hes spaird,
Quhilk never thocht on them to wairde.
Sum dois as they sold never die,
Is nocht this folly, quhat say e?
Sapientia huius mundi stultitia est apud Deum. Because their is sa many fuillis,
Rydand on horse and sum on muillis:
Heir I have bocht good chafery,
Till any fuill that lists to by.
And specially for the thrie estaits,
Quhair I have money tender maits:
Quhilk causit them as e may se,
Gang backwart throw the haill cuntrie.
Gif with my merchandise e list to mell,
Heir I have Folly Hattis to sell.
Quhairfoir is this Hat wald e ken?
Marie for insatiabill merchant men.
Quhen God hes send them abundance
Ar nocht content with sufficiance.
Bot saillis into the stormy blastis,
In Winter to get greater castis:
In money terribill great torment,
Against the Acts of Parliament.
Sum tynis their geir, and sum ar drounde,
With this sic merchants sold be crounde.

Dili. Quhom to schaips thou to sell that hude?
I trow to sum great man of good.

Folly. This hude to sell richt feign I wald,
Till him that is both auld and called:
Reddie till pas to hell or heavin,
And hes fair bairns sax or seavin:
And is of age fourscoir of eir,
And taks ane less to be his peir:
Quhilk is nocht fourteine eir of age,
And ioynis with her in marriage:
Geifand her traist that scho nocht wald,
Rycht haistelie make him cuckald*
Quha maryes beand sa neir their dead,
Set on this Hat upon his head.

Dili. Quhat Hude is that tell me I pray the?

Folly. This is ane haly Hude I say the,
This Hude is ordanit I the assure,
For Sprituall fuillis that taks in cure,
The saullis of great Diosies,
And regiment of great Abesies,
For gredines of warldlie pelf,
Than can nocht justly gyde them self.
Vthers saul's to saife it settis them weill,
Syne sell them a win saullis to the Devil.
Quha ever dois sa, this I conclude,
Upon his heid set on this Hude:
Diligence, Folly is their any sic men
Now in the Kirk that thou can ken?
How sall I ken them? --

-- Folly. Na keip that clois,
Ex operibus eorum cognoscetis eos. And fuillis speik of the Prelacie,
It will be hauldin for herisie.

Rex. Speik on hardly I gif the leife:

Folly. Than my remissioun is in my sleife.
Will e leife me to speik of Kings?

Rex. ea hardly speik of all kin things.
Conforming to my first narratioun,
e ar all fuillis be Coks passioun.

Dili. Thou leis, I trow thisfuill be man git.

Folly. Gif I lie God nor thou behangit.
For I have heir I to the tell
Ane nobill cap imperiell,
Quhilk is nocht ordanit bot for doings,
Of Empreours, of Duiks and Kings.
For princely and imperial fuillis,
They sold have luggis als lang as Muillis.
The pride of Princes without in faill,
Gars all the world rin top ovir taill.
To win them warldlie gloir and good,
They cure nocht schedding of saikles blude.
Quhat cummer have e had in Scotland,
Be our auld enemies of Ingland?
Had nocht been the support of France,
We had been brocht to great mischance.
Now I heir tell the Empreour,
Schaippis for till be ane Conqueror.
And is muifing his ordinance,
Against the Nobill King of France.
Bot I know nocht his just querrell,
That he hes for till make battle.
All the Princes of Almanie,
Spain, Flanders and Italy.
This present eir ar in ane flocht:
Sum sall their wages find deir bocht.
The Paip with bombard, speir and scheild,
Hes send his army to the field.
Sanct Peter, Sanct Paull nor Sanct Androw,
Raisit never sic ane Oist I trow.
Is this fraternall charity,
*Or furious folly, quhat say e?
They leird nocht this at Christis Scuillis:
Thairfoir I think them very fuillis.
I think it folly be Gods mother,
Ilk Christian Prince to ding down other:
Because that this hat sold belang them,
Gang thou and part it evin amang them,
The Prophecy withouttin weir,
Of Merling beis compleit this eir:
For my gudame the Gyre Carling,
Leirnde me the Prophecy of Marling:
Quhairof I sall schaw the sentence,
Gif e will gif me audience.
Flan Fran resurgent, simul Hispan viribus urgent,
Dani vastabunt, Vallones valla parabunt.
Sic tibi nomen in a mulier cacauit in olla:
Hoc epulum comedes --

Diligence. Marie that is ane il sauorit dische.

Folly. Sa be this Prophecy plainly appeirs,
That mortal weirs salbe amang freirs:
They sall nocht know weill in their closters.
To quhom they sall say their Pater nosters.
Wald they fall to and fecht with speir and shield
The feind make cuir quhilk of them win the field.
Now of my sermon have I maid ane end,
To Gilly-mouband I ow all commend.
And I ow all beseik richt hartfullie:
Pray for the saull of good Cacaphatie:
Quhilk laitlic drownit himself into Loch leavin,
That his sweit saull may be above the heavin.

Diligen. Famous peopil hartlie I ow require,
This lytill sport to tak in patience,
We traist to God and we leif ane other eir,
Quhair we have failit we sall do diligence,
With mair pleasure to make ow recompense:
Because we have been sum part tedious
With matter rude, denude of eloquence,
Likewise perchance, to sum men odious.
Now let ilk man his way avance,
Let sum ga drink and sum ga dance:
Menstrell, blaw up ane brawll of France,
Let se quha hobbils best:
For I will rin incontinent,
To the Tavern or ever I stent:
And pray to God omnipotent,
To send ow all good rest.

Rex sapiens aeterne Deus genitorque benign, Sit tibi perpetuo gloria, laus
and honor.
