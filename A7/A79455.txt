OF PHILLIP Earl of Chesterfield, delivered and read in the LORDS House upon
Saturday the thirteenth of February, 1646.

Printed in the Year, 1646.

To the Right Honorable, the Lords assembled in PARLIAMENT. The humble
Petition of Phillip Earl of Chesterfield.
Shows,
THAT your Petitioner having labored under several long and grievous
sicknesses, in the time he has continued your Prisoner, (by your honorable
favors in (...) ^odgings) for above three (...) and a half now last past here
in (...) months in several places in the Country, in ^uch misery and danger of
his life, a warrant being given by Sir John Gell to Captain Vermuden to hang
him, of which he has proof here in Town from Vermudens own mouth, contrary
to the Law of Arms, and to the agreement upon the surrender of the close in
Litch-field, by which both himself and all his there were to have free quarter
for themselves to pass away peaceably with bagg and baggage, though when by
the same agreement they no sooner entered the place, but held all prisoners,
robbed and spoiled your Petitioner and all the rest, (with in the agreement
included) of very wearing, apparel horses, arms, moneys, and what else they
had to the full value of at least five thousand pounds, besides in those sad
distempers of the time being dispoyled of his household stuff with his own,
his wife and childrens apparel and other things to them belonging, as moneys
jewels, and plate in his two several houses, to the full value of at least
eighteen thousand pounds, besides the moneys and wearing apparel of about
fourscore servants, very many of which were persons of such quality as what
they then lost amounted to above foureteen hundred pounds besides your
Petitioners stock of beasts, sheep, and horses in three several places taken
from him to the value of nineteen or twenty thousand pounds more at least, his
demeanes being all fully fraughted and furnished with his own stock, besides
also two of his three choice houses, the one whereof being his ancient sea^e
and place of his Barrony being-plucked down fired, defaced and demolished,
which cost above sixteen thousand pounds, not yet fifty years ago, his whole
personal Estate within and without doors violently seized and carried away,
his wood and timber in several counties waste fully felled, his Parks decayed,
his whole real Estate sequestered amounting in these four years to fourteen
thousand pounds his Tenants stocks violently driven away, themselves also
imprisoned for not paying greater taxes then either their livings or estates
were able to satisfy, some of them dying, the rest and those that live, their
wives and children and selves so^^ impoverished, as to turn up their farms
and go a begging, whereby much prejudice is come to your Petitioner, their
Lands lying wastand their houses for want of tenants fallen down and burnt by
other townsmen, and all the fences and bounds betwixt him and other Lords, so
defaced as scarce again to be known, whereby great suites and debates are like
to arise hereafter; Your Petitioners debts which before these times were four
thousand pounds, are now since these times, increased to above five thousand
pounds; his friends, tenants and servants engaged for him, imprisoned, and he
not able to relieve them, and that nothing of Jobs afflictions migh be wanting
his children slain, one cruelly murdered after he had laid down his arms,
and diserted that service, another also most barbarously killed and murdered in
one of your Petitioners houses, and with him also about seven score more then
s^ine not sparing the killing of some children, slashing and wounding of one
Gentlewoman, and other women that could not be in arms, with other unheard of
barbarousnesse, both to the living and dead; yea, such, as were your Petitioner
a Turk, Heathen, Jew, or Infidel, that had deserved much worse of any State,
then he hopes he has done of this; yet is confident, more severity could not
have been exercised, then has been upon him, but unknown, I am confident, to
your Lordships: For all this time of his imprisonment, he has not been
allowed the value of six pence yearly, forth of his own sequestered estate, but
has lived upon credit and borrowing, until these two last years, that some
of his Friends and Tenants in Derby shire, farmed diverse Lands in those parts;
from whence, by extraordinary husbandry in tillage for corn, they gained about
eightscore pounds a year for his behoof. But now upon certain votes by the
house of Commons only, bearing date the tenth day of November, last past, but
never confirmed by your Lordships can therefore, he thinks be no absolute
binding Ordinance: yet none of his Lands can be any more farmed by any to his
use or behoof: whereupon the Lady Hoghton, his Daughter, wrote a letter to the
Derbyshire Committee, that those lands might still be farmed to your
Petitioners benefit, and that those Votes of the house of Commons above
specified, were but only Votes and not an Ordinance, without your Lordships
assent and joining, which they took so heinously, as expressed much bitterness
and passion thereupon; saying, they should be obeyed as a good Ordinance, by
any that had to do with them, with some other high and unfitting language,
which he dares not express: So as now, your Petitioner is hopeless of further
subsistence, and having now lately suffered a great deal of misery and
sickness, which kept him in his bed above nine weeks together: In which time,
truly my Lords, he had like to have perished for want of means to pay
Physicians, Chyrurgions, and Apothecaries, or to buy necessary meat and drink
fit for a sick person; despairing therefore of recovery, he caused his Chaplain
to make his sad condition known to the Congregation, and to entreat their
prayers for him, which he having done, most miraculously, by heavens hand,
beyond expectation, he was again restored and preserved, by one, whose name he
neither knows, nor had formerly seen, or conversed with him, came to him as he
was upon his sick bed, and delivered to him a good sum of money, whereby till
now, he has subsisted, with this further message, that they who sent the money,
so much pitied his present sad condition, as not to expect repayment, until he
were restored again to his rights and estate. But now again, those moneys being
spent and gone, your Petitioner is so miserable poor, as to want money to buy
him bread, not having clothes to his back, more then what he daily wears,
besides, old Scores to Cooks, Woodmongers, Brewers, Bakers, and other
Tradesmen, being long and great, without his abilities to pay or satisfy, can
therefore have no further credit, but must doubtless perish, unless your
Lordships be favorable and noble unto him.

To your Lordships therefore and to you only, as persons sensible of honor,
and tender of the sufferings of men distressed, As also knowing the Laws of
the L^nd so well, as that thieves and robbers men of meaner quality, than
himself; and having committed more heinous offenses, then he hopes hi^ will
ever prove, when he may be admitted ^o his apolog^e and defense, yet must be
allowed a fitting subsistence forth of their own estates (if they have any)
until there be a conviction and not to be pined and star^ed, which is now this
your present petitioners case; whose addresses only are and shall be to your
^ordships not doubting but in abatement of your too ridged censure of his
offense he shall make it appear to you that he has, both whilst he was with
the King himself, and since also done eighteen several good offices for the
Parliament; yea and preserved the lives and estates of some of the House of
Commons who had else suffered much, He cannot therefore doubt of your noble
inclinations to favor and commisterate his condition in the mean time he
humbly entreats you favorable construction of any thing herein contained, he
being so ashamed that any should take notice of his present, miserable
condition, that he had not the confidence to advise with any about the better
inditing this his Petition, but his sadness of beart with the sense of his
own sufferings were indeed the pressers and inditers of what is herein
expressed and desired.

That your Petitioner in this his sad afflicted condition, if these his already
sufferings may not suffice to expiate the offense conceaved against him, and
move with your Lordships, to restore him again to his liberty and ruined
estate, which he humbly beseeches, being utterly disabled of all means to
redeem himself and Estate by the favor vouchsafed to others, in being
admitted to their composition whilst they had something wherewith to do the
same, (which your Petitioner now has not) being but bare tenant for life,
makes therefore his humble adresse to your Lordships; that you will be
honorably pleased in your nobleness, so far to take into your consideration,
your Petitioner, and his present sufferings, and want of livelihood and
subsistence, as that some present competencie, out of your Petitioners estate,
may, by your honorable order be timely allotted and paid unto him out of his
sequestered estate, in the Counties of Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln.

And your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc. P. CHESTERFIELD.
