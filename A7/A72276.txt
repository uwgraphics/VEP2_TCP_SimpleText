IF the profane Aucthours (good chrysie^ Reader) ^oulde conceive by a natural
Phantasy / Ouidius mite mor^^^^^^s lib, (...).
that in Iupi^ers fathers days for the Abou^daunce of transytorye things / a
golden woorlde to be invented / so plentefull / that the earth / our commone
mother / gave the^ wyllynglye the increase of her womb / without man's
industrye or travail / and the multyplycation of that with foolysh feigned
verses / to be imputed unto the Tyranous and wicked God Iupyter / both for the
comme^dacion of so inco^staunt a God / and also for the perpetual memory of
their own Acts and deeds. j. John.ij.
How much more then (good Christen reader) in these our days / may we (if
we close not our eyes in the broad son shine) perceive not a feigned golden
woorlde (as the inuentyng Poets did) but a woorlde in deed much more prity ous
the^ gold / Ezaijxxxiij
pearl or precious s^o^^^^ or as much as heaven incomparably passes the
earth / so does the fruit that co^m^^^ thereof / above measure excede all
tr^^^^^^s of gold / as much as the celes^yall son of God surmou^teth the
Ma^na that fasteth from the clouds. Johan.vj.
For Gods son ande Gods word is all one. Johan.j.
But our fruit that we have comes from heaven and is Gods word. Math. xij
Therefore in receyuyng it / thou receyuest Gods ^^e^ye son / the true
Messaungee that came from heaven. Now / therefore seeing thou have this so
eternal a treasure / embrace it with reuere^te / for thy forefathers tasted
not thereof. Colloss. iij.
So that now blessed are thine e^es and thine ears if thou have rece^^ed this
heavenly treasure i^ th^ue heart. Roma. xij.
And that thou may occupy thy self and bestow thy time to Gods glory / thou
have here a trease of baptyme by that Reverend Father the Bishop of Coleyne
one of the Electours of the sacred Empire co^pited in satin and now sert
fourth into Inglish / to thy commodytye (good christen reader). Not that I
would take upon me arrogauntly to instruct my former predecessors / Math.
xxv.
But only for as much as it is a thing so necessary for the Ignorant and
also partly to fetch my talent out of the earth again and to emplo^e it to
the glory of God and vtylytye of christ's poor little flock. Zuc. xij.
And i^ as much as the matter is so weyghtye / and had in daily exercise. Yea
the sponsers ande sureties being so blind in this so great a matter / Promysyng
before an Ignorant guide to answer for the faith of the Child / of the which
for the most part they are both (the more pytye if it pleased God) to seek
and to learn in this thing / which ought to be learned / and to be had in a
parfect redynes. Math. ix.
I thought it me^^ (good brother mynyster) somewhat to succoure thine
Ignorauncye / ande especyallye that the unlearned may have wherewith to
exercise them selves in the mean season / Johan.v.
that in ransackyng this small piece of work / before hand / they may with
knowledge answer for their infauntes / when they shall with the favor of
their Parents be moved to so Chrystyan a business. Unto this treatise also
haste thou annexed a very Godly / Ephesians. iiij.
commendable and compendyous work / no less learned the^ necessary to all
the faithful ministers of Christ's church / elucubrate and set forth by the
famous Clerck and faithful evangelist / Vvolfga^gus Musculus / And now also
for thy proffit ande vtylytye (good brother in Christ) both drawn out of
latin into Inglysh / by the vnproffytable servant of Jesus Christ Richard
Rice. Timoth. j.
Take the^ both and use the^ to Gods glory / to whom only / see thou give the
praise

Amen.
An exhortacion of the Pastor / to them that offer the infaunt in the
congregacyon.


(...) beloved in Christ (...) daily hear by the (...) God and learn by
como^^^r^ ^^ence as well in life as in ^ea^h that ^ro^ the fall of Adam / we
are co^ce^ued ^a like transgressyo^ / ande borne in sin / ande are gyltye of
Gods wrath / and condemned for Adams forfert / except we be delivered by the
death and merytes of the son of God Jesus Christ our lord. Seeing then that
this infau^t / by the commone let of nature / is borne in like transgressyon /
there is no quesryon / but that he needs is defiled with the same orygynall
disease and sin / and is in subjection to eternal death and dampnacyon. But
God the father (through his unspeakable pity ande mercy toward ma^kinde)
sent his son to save the world. And in that will he have this infaunt also
saved / which parteineth to the woorlde. For he took a way the sins of all
the woorlde. And has delivered ande saved as well the young Babes / as us of
discretyon and years / from sin / death / the deuell and dampnatio^. The
which would the lytleones to be offered unto hi / that he might dystrybute his
blessing unto them. Therefore of your Chrystyan love and charytye / take this
Child and bring him unto Christ / And offer him by your godly Prayers / that
of him / he may receive remyssyon of his sins / and be translated into the
Kingdom of his grace / delivered from the tyranny of Satan / and be made
partaker / ande heir of the eternal salvation. And be ye certeilie assured
that the lord Jesus Christ will graciously accept this work / and benevolence
of your charytye toward this infaunt.

And give ear to your Prayers / because he has so commanded in his holy
word / saying / sufferre the little ones to come unto me / for unto soche
belongs the Kingdom of heaven.

baptism?

Answer. we do surely believe it.

heaven ande sits on the right hand of the father / And there he rules his
congregation by his almighty power. And shall come again in the end of the
woorlde / manifest to all men / and there to Judge both the quick and the dead?

Answer. We do believe.

Of this faith / do ye co^fes our lord Jesus Christ / to be as well the Savior
/ of this little one / as he is our Savior? the which by his death has
expiate and cleansed our sins also / and has by his resurrection / reco^s^ied

perfer life?

Answer. We do believe.

Do ye believe in the holighoost. The holy catholic Church. The communion of
Saints / The forgiveness of sins / The resurrection of the flesh / ande the
life everlasting?

Answer. We do believe.

Believe ye by this confession / the holighost to be as well the teacher of this
infaunt / as of your selves? and that he will be a comfore to you both? and that
ye are the true members of Christ our lord / and his congregation? and that
this babe shall be taken as a membre through Baptime / both of Christ and of the
congregation / in the which he shall have remission of sins / and a cerreyne
assured^ open of the resurrecty on of the eternal lyse?

Answer. We do believe.

The derety bei^^ed see that ye parforme the thig that ye have promised here in

Aungelles shall minister / do service and be in subjection. Ande doubt not but
whatsoever either good or badde / you or any other do to this render and weak

think any labor tedious. But let every man in time mete (either as he is of
his kindred / either as he is bound in his vocation) apply him lelfe
diligently to bring up ande inform him / to the lord / Godly and
virtuously / that in process of time / he may keep all things aright / that
our Savior Christ has commanded us. It is therefore your duty which are
given / as Parents / kynsfolkes / Spo^sers or sureties / unto this Child / of
God / that as soon as he grows to any discretion / he shall be brought up to
some virtuous Scoles / or into the Church / that he may the more fullye be
taught or instruct / as well in the lords prayer / the articles of the faith
and the.x. Commandments / as in the right use of the Sacraments. And that
he may clerelie parceiue the free grace and rich benefyttes of God given unto
him / in his baptism. And that he may render accou^te and a true rekening of
his faith before the congregation. And that with his own mouth he may

through the mystery of his baptism. Opt to him the door of thy Kingdom / at
the which thy congregation knocks for through Christ our i^rde. Deacon.
Sobeit good lord. Let us pray.


O father almighty God / the which in times ^a^^ / through the (...) / by thy
fearful Iudgem^^ / des^^oiedseth^ wicked woorld. And for thy (...) mercyes
sake-preseruedst the familye of virtuous Noe eight only souls. And also
diddesti the sea ouerwneline obstinate Pharo the king of Egypt with his whole
army and force of war / and sufferedst thine own people the Israelites / to
pass through it dry shodde. And in these thigs / it was thy pleasure that the
lauer of regeneration / that is / holy baptism should be prefigured and
signified. Moreover / thou did appointe the water of Iordane to serve to
the baptism of Jesus Christ thy son. And other waters beside / and forth to
be addiet to the submercion and wasshi^g of the bodies of the congregation. We
beseech the of thin unspeakable mercy to behold graciously this infant / and
give unto hi^ parfet faith / and thy blessed holy spirit / that through this
sacred floude / there may perrysh and be over whelmed in him / what soever
filthiness / he received by the co^tagion and infectio^ of Adam. That he
(separated out of the nombre of the ungodly) may safely be preserved in the
precinete of the congregation. And that he may with a merry there and fervent
spirit / sanctify and acknowledge continually thy holy name. And with a
constant faith and sure hope / be obsequious unto thy kingdom / whereby
atlength / he may with all thy faithful people obtain the everlasting
promis of eternal life / through Christ our lord, say all / Amen.

Pastor. Name the Child.

Pastor. The words of the holy Gospel that follow / are after the mind of.
S. Mark. Deacon / Praises be given to God.

Pastor.Give good attendau^ce to the sacred Gospel. Mark the.x. B. And they
brought Children unto Christ that he might touch them. But his disciples
reproved these that brought them. Nevertheless when Jesus saw it / he was
displeased / and said unto them / Suffer the Children to come unto me / and
forbydde them not / for unto soche belongs the Kingdom of God. Verelye I
say unto you / who soever receives not the Kingdom of God as a Child / he
shall not enter therein and he took the^ up in his arms / and laid his hands
on them / and blessed them.

Deacon. By the virtue of the holy Gospel all our sins might be forgiven us.
All the people shall say. Amen.

Pastor. Here I shall de sire you with one voice to say the lords prayer and
the articles of the faith. This being done the Pastor and the Deacon shall read
these Psalms followynge.

Not unto us / o lord / not unto us but unto thy name give praise for thy
lovinge mercy and faithfulness.

Wherefore shall the heathen say / where is now their God? As for our lord he
is in heaven he does what soever it pleases him.

Praise the Lord o ye serrauntes / O praise the name of the Lord.

Glory to the Father / to the son / and to the holyghooste. et cetera.

Blessed be the name of the Lord / from this time forth for evermore.

The Lords name is worthy to be praised / from the rising up of the son /
unto the going down of the same.

The lord is high above all heathen / and his glory above the heavens.

Who is like unto the lord our God? that has his dwellinge so high / which
humbles him self to behold that is in heaven and earth?

Which takes up the simple out of the dust / and lifts the poor out of
the mire.

That he may set him among the rich / even among the princes of his people.

Which makes the barren woman to keep house / and to be a Joyful Mother of
Chylderen.

Glory be to the father / to the son ande to the holyghoost. etce.

Praise the everlasting. Amen.

Parson. The lord be with you.

Deacon. And with your spyrite also.

Parson. Let us pray.

O almighty and eternal God our heavenly father / we yield the everlasting
thanks / that thou have voutchsafed to call us to this knowledge of thy grace
ande faith. Increase (we hertelie beseech the) this faith for ever. And grant
unto this infaunt / thy holy spyrite / that he (regentrated /) may become the
heir of eternal salvation / the which thou have promised to thy holy
congregation / as well young as old of thy grace and mercy through Christ Jesus
our lord.

Deacon. So be it / beliced Lord.

Pastor. This Epistle is (...) the m^^e of. S. Paul. Titus.ij.
But after that the kyndnes ande love of God our Sauyoure to man ward appeared
/ not for the deeds of righteousness which we wrought / but after his mercy /
he seued us by the fountain of the new birth / and renewing of the holighoost
which he shed on us aboundau^elie through Jesus Christ our Savior / that we
being made righteous by his grace / should be heirs of eternal life /
according to hope. This is a true saying.

The holyghoost that wrote these things in the Apostles hearts / grant that
they also may be printed earnestly in our minds and works. Say all. Amen.

Pastor. The lord bewyth you.

Deacon. And with your spyrite also.

Pastor. The words of the holy Gospeil that follow are after the mind of. S.
Math. x. vin. The lord Jesus says unto his disciples. Unto me is given all
power in heaven and earth. Go therefore into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature / and teach all people / baptisinge them in the name
of the father / and of the son / and of the holy ghoost / traching them to
keep all things that I have co^mannded you. Who soever beleneth and is
baptized / shall be saved / But who soever believes not / shall be co^de^pned.
And behold / I will abide with you still unto the woorldes e^de.

Deacon. By the virtue of the holy Gospel / all our sins might be for given
us. Say all Amen.

Deacon. And with your spyryte also.

Pastor. Let us pray.

Almyghtie and merciful God and father. Thou have promised unto Abraham / the
father of all beleuers / and in him also / to us his Children / that thou will
be a God to us and our posterity. Wherefore / as thou receined st the infantes
of the Israelytes (thy ancient People) into grace and favor / through the
promys / in their circumcision. And as thy son our forde and Samoar Jesus
Christ permieted mercifully / the Chylderen offered / to approach unto him /
and blessed them ande testified that unto soche does apparteine the Kigdome of
heaven. Like wise we pray the instauntely / that thou will receive our
infantes unto the. And regencrate them as the new borne babes. And through the
mystery of the spyrytuall lauer of baptism / permyt them to enter into the
fellowship of erernall life. Grant thee fore heavenly father / that we may
diligently of a puce heart / require soche aboundent riches of grace / laid
before us in baptism for our little ones. And that we may know and receive
with a true faith / this incorruptible treasures offered unto us / both in the
word and Sacrament. And that we may give perpetual praise / and glorify
the. Ande reken not unto him the forfait of Adams sin / spredde and ingraft
into him through his pare^tes. Neither yet behold the life of his sureties /
these Godfathers and Godmothers / nether of the purest of all the people. But
let the death and meryce of thy son our Lord Jesus Chrys^ / take place in
him. And impute unto hi his righteousness and obedience. Graft him into his
death ande resurrection. Make him the membre of thy body. Ande gouuerne him /
that he may be thine heir and son for ever. Make that we may know him /
after this lauer / for thy son / and the membre of the body of thy Christ.
Grant that we may virtuously nurture and bring him up / in thy fear. And
that we may succor hi in all things corporal and spiritual.

That through him / thy holy name may be praised / the Kingdom of thy soo^ne
dilated and enlarged. Let thy will in him be done in earth as it is in heaven.
More over preserve him in prosperity. Minister graciously unto him the
necessaries of his living / and keep him from all evil / through Christ our

A Right Godly treatise of Matrimonye / very mete ande necessary for all
Godly ministers of Christ's Church.
COMP ILED by the famors Clerk ande faithful Evangelist Wolfgangus Musculus.
And now for the veysttie / proffit and furtherannce of all faithful
Chrystians / transtaied our of satin into Inglysh by the vnproffytable
servant of JESUS Christ. Kychard Ryce.

Hebreus.xiii. Let wedlock he had in price in all points / and let the
Chamber be undefiled / for whorekepers and Aduouterers God will Judge.




IN as much as among all other holy ordinances instytuted of God / this
blessed wedlock / both as concerning the Aucthour place and co^tinuau^ce /
has received his praise in the sacred word of God. Let us (if the God of
might shall so permit) ransacke ande devoutly peruse what this blessed
institution is of it self / and how purelie esteemed of God. Ande that we may
Chrystyanly / with Goos fear / enter without polluted lips / into soche a
notable matter / first / we shall cousyder what matrimony is. Secondarelie /
of whom it is. Thyrdely / how honest and commendable it is / fourthlie / how
proffytable it is. Fyfthlye how necessary it is. For all these points does
the Scripture very plainly manifest and open / against the abusers thereof / to
their foul shame ande riproche. The carnal eye spyeth not in Matrimony / the
thing that is of most price and value therein / for in it / sees it nothing.
save the only copulation of the flesh / between the man and the woman / to
content the lust of the body only. But he that goes ande labors no
farther in this so holy a busynes shall spy so much between fornicatours and
adulterers. For they also couple their fylthy dampened flesh to gether. Therefore
must it be perpended / what singular thing holy wedloke has of it self.
Wherein it differs from fornication and adul t^cie. The di^^^nitie of
matrimony.
Wherefore say / that Matrimony is the co^iunctio^ and coupi^g of two parsons
/ that is to say one man and one woman / into one mete and lausulll flesh and
body / according to the ordynau^es and institution of God / indissoluble /
without separation / fast knyt and bound / of equal anctoritye and power / on
both parties. Open this diffinityon after this sort. Brethere^ the first post
of this matter / we said / was of the lausull conjunction of two bodies into
one flesh / accord^g to Gods institution and ordenaunce. But among
whoormo^gers is there a^o^iunction of two fyithye sinful bodies yet is it
neither lauful / me te nor according to Gods ordenau^ce but the deuels / whose
members they make the^se des or as many as marry withi the for broden degres /
contrary to Gods word. (...). xviii
Alse we said in this diffinity on that they two must be Joined and knitt one
to a^ other. Genesis.ii.
For the which cause / both father ande mother must be forsaken. So fast must
the bond be. Moreover the knot must be vnlou sable / with out separatyon. For
that / that God has coupled / man can not sep^^^e. Math. xix.
For all marriages that are made / are not of Gods Ioyaing / but all that are
right he justly ande laufullye according to Gods word performed / are of his
Ioyuynge. Ande so the may no man separate / without he will destroy GODS
ordenasice. To conclude / they must be of equal power and auctoritye. For the
man has no power over his evene body / but the woman. Ande likewise the woman
has not power of her own body / but the man. i. Gorin. vii
But these four addityons can not serve / either for adulterers or
fornicatours For (as we said) they are not laufully Joined after gods
institution. Exodus xxiii.
Neither may father ande mother be forsaken for soche ungodly couplyng.
Neither is the knot so vnlousable / without separatyon / but that it may be /
yea / ought to be separated / by the sword of correctyon. Or else the
swerdbearers are like to be separated the^ seives from GOD. Neither is there
equal power on both parties / For the will of GOD is / that every man may
know / how to possess his own vessel in sa^ctisicaty on and holiness. i.
Tess iiii.
But whooredome is not holiness / therefore there is in whooredome neither
possessyon nor equal power. AND for these two points / for as much as they
may not have Matry monye loose at their own pleasure / ande have equal
Auctorytye on a strompets stynkynge and caranouse flesh / they abhor pure
Matrimonye / ande haste them to whooredome. The which in womankind seek after
nothing but a licentious rage of dampnable liberte. In so much that the
enemies of holy wedlock / are so far past shame ande honestye / that for
this only cause they prefer the filthy concubinatyon of Baals preesies /
and is accepted. rather then laufull matrimonye. For here they put away an
whore / a stinking doungsacke / at their pleasure. And in honest wedlock / a
godly creature / is well contented / with a lauful necessary remedy or wife /
and so to keep her / and none other. Therefore (says the Apostle) Let every
manne have bys wife / ande every woman. / her husband. i. Corin. vij


Now let us see / who is the Aucthour of this godly ordenaunce.
This matter is very plain in the.ij. of Genes^s / and also in the xix. of
Math. where as God is induced and brought in / as well to be the consecratour
and halower of this connubiall and matrimony all estate as he is the maker also
of makinde. Genesis.ij.
Therefore let the married esteem them selves / Math. xix.
to have the same Aucthour and head of their copulacyon (rightly / laufully and
Godly Joined) that they have to be the plasmatour and maker both of body and
soul. And let here the contempners of this holy institutyon beware and take
good adviseme^t / that in despisyng matrymony / they scorn not also (to their
great shame and reproach) the Auctour of our souls and lives.

Thyrdelye.
How honest and commendable it is.
That is manifest in the xiij. to the hebrews in these words. Hebr. xiii.
Let wedlock be had in price in all points / ande let the chamber be
undefiled. These things are honest which have no spot of forfett or sin /
but are exercised with virtue. In wedlock can there not be sin / in as much
as God is the aucthour and consecratour thereof / without ye will make God the
Aucthour of sin / the which instytuted matrymonye. And also it has virtue
annexed unto it.

First / of all laufull and co^staunt promys. Secondly / of mutual pure and
godly love. Thyrdelye of the necessary comfort of the Man toward the Woman /
ande the Woman toward the Man. Fourthlye For the preservation of maki^de /
with the grace and blessing of God. Wherefore it is not without a cause spoken /
of the Apostle / let wedlock / be had in price among all menete.

Fysthlye.
How pro^^^e his it is.
The proffye and vtylitie of this state / is three diverse wates to be noted.
First / that through it / and by it does the conseruatio^ and generation of
mankind consist. Concubiners and aduiterers / do also bring forth Chylderen
/ but of this generation / let bastardes and whore mongers rejoice. Neither
was it the will of God / that mankind should be begotten / through inordinate
whoredom and filthynes. Thenes also are comforted / both with stolen bread and
clothes / will any man therefore grant that bread and clothing must be gotten
with theft? Also in that God said, Let us make him an helper / that may bear
him company. This helper is equal in all points as well in generation /
education and bringing up of Chylderen / as also in conversation and living to
gether. But this state is euel reported of for the manyfold cares and charges
that sprig there of / among the wise of this woorlde. But for the most / these
things happen not for the default of Godly matrimony but rather of the evell
condytyous of the parsones coniugate and married. But as for those charges which
come naturally / soche they are / that no man ca^ be without them / except he
purpose to live more like a beast / then a man. The third commodity is (as the
Apostle restifyeth) that for advoyding of fornicatyon / let every man have his
wife / and every woman her husband. How proftitable this is. The destructyon
of the general world with the floude / the unmerciful death of the Sodomites
/ the plage of the wicked Gentiles / and the wonderful filthy and wanton life
of our Balaamytes is to open. Roma. ^.

How necessary it is.
That does not only the blessing of our lord / where he says increase
ande multyplye / but also experyence teach us. Whereby the strength and
efficacy of Gods word in our bodies is declared / wherefore Christ said unto
his visciples. All men can not away with this sayig. Now then seeing that all
these propertyes parteyne to wedlock before recyted / and now also in these
our later days / so honestlye bewtifyed / with Christ's own presence / with
what other spyrite are the Romish stock led / then with the same that the
Apostle speaks of? ^. Timoth. iiij.
The which have supposed / this state (instituted of God holy and honest /
proftitable and necessary / honored also with Christ's presence) to be plain
fylthynes and have denied it to the mynisters of the Church / as most dyle
and abominable.

Interrogations to be made by the parson / vicar or curate of thy brydegome and
bride.
How say you brother. N. are you content to take this woman prepared to be
your helper of God / and to receive her at his head / as your necessary

unto us. And for that cause / in our heavenly peticio^s / of our pater noster
/ God has set out that principally to be asked / as the chief thing
parteininge to a Christen man / before all other necessaries / as if that were
obtained / all were obtained. Ande that lacking all things wanted. As we say.
Our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come.

do / then thou have in the face of this assembly answered / I will assure the

wrought after his commandment / neither yet his sede beggyng their bread And
