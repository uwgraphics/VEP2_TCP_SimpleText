THE Masters of the Lyrick wit --
The two Tops of the Muses, sit
Upon the Muses two-top'd Hill
And all ears with their smooth strains fill:
Apollo's courteous hand hold's down
Between them both a Golden Crown;
They both contend, yet both agree
The discord makes our harmony.
List then to the all-quickning lyre
Of Horace and of Casimire.
THE ODES of CASIMIRE.

VIRO VERE GENEROSO, Et meritissime a me colendo BERNARDO HYDE, Armig.
TIbi sisto quod tuum est; Tu nobis haec fecisti otia: quod igitur a filiis
tuis ingenuis and charissimis, eripui temporis, Tibi Patri totum restituendum
curavi; and sic non furtum sed Translatio existimetur. Cum equidem primulum te,
Casimirum portentosi ingenii virum, and admirandi acuminis, summa cum argutia
and suavitate recitantem, non ingrate exaudiveram; obtusas nimis and
languescentes nostras facultates novus refocillavit calor; Nova mihi and
insolitae magnitudinis stella, ubique clariores immittens radios, non sine
admiratione affulsit: and hinc cupidissimus magnale hoc visendi factus, oculo
illud fatigatissimo, parum tamen perspicaci, avidissime quaesivi. Et sic tandem
divina eminentissimi Sarbievii poemata pauca, nimis trita exiguitatis meae jam
vest induta, ad te, a quo, and Authorem and famam Elogiis abunde non immerito
ornatam accepi, devolvi gestiunt. Onus humeris maxim impar nostris, me
suscepisse, nemine saltem caliginosis and excaecatis pene mentis nostrae
ocellis, facem, quo penitius inspiciatur jam praeferente, non possum diffiteri:
Non tamen actum ago, fed intactum and illibatum tibi obtuli Casimirum cujus
verba omnia divinae poesios igne undequaque reserta, rudi conaminis mei chalybe
cum leviter tetigi, scintillae hae (cito, nisi favoris tui Zephyro placide
foveantur moriturae) tibi emicuerunt. Aequi igitur consule, and accipe quae
tibi offero, animo quo Dedicavi; si quid huc usque inversi ingruerit. Nunquam
te non propitium expertus sum; and eadem jam cinctus confidentia exui calamo
frontem, and pudorem posui. Si hoc quod jam praestiti, pignus animi mei
gratitudinis, exile tibi arrideat; Metam, ad quam collimavi, assecutus, nil
ultra moror quam ut me tibi semper officiocissime praeberem,

Devotiss: Devinctiss: G. HILLS.

Candido Lectori.
CUm me opusculum hoc aggressurum non attraxit affectat a ambitio; sed otii
solius taedium devorandi desiderium: Non Ancipitem Janum, contra Acephalos, and
sine front superbos, in ipso limine janitorem, nec Tricephalum Cerberum contra
multorum capitum belluam, bifronti huic libellulo acerrimum invocabo
oppugnatorem. Te solum (candide lector) (ut Antiqui, aliquem e gentium diis)
contra Molossos omnes malitiose delatrantes, Jovem nostrum Statorem posui,
Apage mancos istos and mutilatos judices, qui non tam poema, quam ejus vitia
insectantur. Apage facundos illos contumeliarum creatores! Tibi me advolve, in
te securus permanebit animus, and malis indigne non succumbet. Non magna do,
non perfecta, non polita, sed rudia and incocta, quaeque tui pumicem reposcunt.
Ut tenuitati igitur meae succurras obsecro; si enim in opere jucundo and utili,
est aliquid aliquo usque prodire, Candidos arbitror and ingenuos, inceptum hoc
meum, non vitio prorsus daturos. Male consultoru^ hominu^ ingenia ad
detrahendu^ proclivia, non sic moror; exil^tatem meam agnosco, tantam enim in
opere hoc ubique profunditatem expertus, ut non cujusvis est (minime mei, qui
inter eos qui divine poescos amoris flammulis fervent, sum postremus) ad Cas^er
penetrare Adyta. Auctoritate tua nobis opus est Far^bi, qui miseris nobis,
Naufragium arduos contra Authorum scopulos facturis, misericordem temet
praebere Tiphim non dedignaris; sed calamum coerceo. Tuo praesidio tutus tuam
(si quid mali adversatur) manum implore auxiliatricem; quae me ingenii (uti
Aeneas patrem dexteritate virium) e media incolumem eripi at flamma. Vale.

To the Censuring Reader.
A Word or two to thee, and I have done; and in English, for it may be, it is
that which makes thee a reader. I know thou will start up Critic, if not
Cynick; and therefore to prevent thee, I thus Apologize for my self to those
of better judgment and affection. I confess I have not been so precisely
careful in every Ode, as to render line for line (a thing so strictly stood
upon by some late translators) for indeed the exuberant torrent of Elegancie,
came so fast upon me, that I was forced to make my banks larger; choosing
rather to make my fault in the excess, then defect. I ingenuously acknowledge
that I am not worthy to blow a coal of that divine fire, which spreads such
glorious flames through every Ode; and indeed (if it were possible to expect
any mercy from thee) thou might excuse me in this bold attempt; for I want
those true Promethean helps, that heretofore fetched down this fire, and dealt
it freely amongst us; Those courteous sons of Maja, that with their powerful
rods could break the bars, and easily uncharme the knottiest Authors. Well,
if thou take no pleasure in reading, I did profit in writing, and I had
rather, of the two, that thou should be idle. The young Thing was never
intended for the Press, but the violence of some friends ravished her from me,
in her virgin bloome, and now she is grown common: use her and me as
courteously as thou can, however I bid thee farewell.

Ad Sarbievii Casimiri Lyram.
Who Is this divided Nature joins so soon
By a new strain of quaint division?
The Lion courts the Liberd, and the Lamb
Hangs on the neck of the rugged Wolf made tame!
What Orpheus moves the seven proud hills with 's strain?
What Charmer mounts the Dolphin's back again?
That makes the waves of Tyber dancing go?
And without measure, all in measure flow?
If neither Flaccus, Thine, nor Pindars Lyre
Can work this change; It must be Casimire!
Giant of wit! that with thy numbers even
Assault'st the starry Orb, and conquer'st heaven!
The God of war when thy tuned Harp does move,
Neglects his own, fights for thy holy love.
Apollo, off, his Majesty does throw,
And courts again his Daphne in thy brow:
Where she out-shines her self, more fresh and gay
Then when before she faintly ran away.
Pallas, her Gorgon laid aside, discloses
Her pride, in thy sweet Violets and Roses.
Juno and Venus ushered by chaste love
Through Ceres Tilths, and Flora's banks, here move
Phoebus's three Graces, and his Daughters nine
A Galliard dance, by turns, in every line.
The soul of Poesy moves with subtle Art
Wholly in the whole; wholly, in every part.

Od. 1. Lib. 1. Cum infestae Thracum Copiae Pannonia excessissent.
JAm minae saevi cecidere belli:
Jam profanatis male pulsa terris
Et salus, and pax niveis revisit
Oppida bigis:
Iam fides, and fas, and amaena praeter
Faustitas, laeto volat arva curru:
Iam fluunt passim pretiosa largis
Saecula rivis.
Candidi soles veterisque venae
Fontibus nati revocantur Anni:
Grandinat Gemmis, riguoque Coelum
Depluit Auro.
Meque veraci cecinisse plectro
Inter Octobreis, tua festa, pompas,
Prisca Saturni rediisse saecla,
Approbat Orbis.
Aurei patrum niveique mores,
Exul, and sera procul usque Thule,
Candor, and pulchro remeare virtus
Audet Olympo.
Lactis, and fusi per aprica mellis
Garruli Campos secuere rivi:
Et superfuso tumuere plenae
Nectare ripae.
Laetior vulgo seges inquietis
Fluctuat culmis, titubantque frugum
Uberes Campi, nec avara sulcis
Invidet aestas.
Pastor Erranteis comitatus Hoedos
Provocat raucas calamo cicadas:
Mugiunt Colles, and anhela fessis
Silva Iuvencis.
Pace subsultant juga, pace ridem
Tetricae rupes: leve separatos
Otium colleis amat, and sequestri
Gaudia pagi.
Te Ceres flavis redimita culmis,
Magne pacati moderator orbis,
Te suis Aestas opulentae Circumfundit aristis.
Supplici Myrtus tibi servit umbra,
Serviunt Lauri: tibi celsa long
Quercus assurgit, tremuloque pinus
Vertice nutat.
Siderum praeses, dominusque terrae,
Lucida Romam speculatus arce,
Regna tranquillet, Cupidoque patrom
Te velit orbi.
Laurus annosum tibi signet ^vum:
Fata te norint, properentque parcae
Nescium carpi tibi destinatos
Stamen in annos.
Quaeque formosos sedet inter igneis,
Sedulam pro te miserata Romam
Virgo, quam circum glomerantur albis
Astra choreis.
Curet effusas Latii querelas,
Virginum castas juvenumque voces
Curet, and votis procerum reclinem accommodet aurem.
Ad Aurelium Lycum. Ode 2. Lib. 1. Ne plus aequo de adversa fortuna queratur.
INdignas, Lyce, naenias,
Et maestum gemitu pectus, and hispidis
Frontem nubibus expedi,
Cum Sol non solito lumine riserit,
Et fortuna volubilis
Fati difficilem jecerit aleam.
Quod vexant hodie Noti,
Cras lambent hilares aequor Aetesiae.
Moestum sol hodie caput,
Cras laetum roseo promet ab aequore.
Alterno redeunt choro
Risus and gemitus, and madidis prope
Sicci cum Lacrymis joci.
Nascuntur mediis gaudia luctibus,
Sic fatis placitum suis
Tempestiva ftuunt fata periculis.
^essos duxit heri boves,
Dat magnis hodie jura Quiritibus:
Et quae bobus ademerat,
Imponit Gabiis, and Curibus juga.
Idem Phosphorus aspicit
Magnum, quem tenuem viderat Hesperus.
Quod si seria ludicris
Fortunae placeat texere; Rusticus
Hesternam repetet casam,
Ridentis populi non humilis jocus:
It queis rexerat omnia,
Findet laurigeris ligna securibus.
Quod si defuerit salix
Fasces pauperibus subjiciet focis.
Ad Tarquinium Lavinum. Od. 13. lib. 1.
NOn si Sol semel occidit,
Non rubris iterum surget ad Indiis;
Nee si quos celeris rotae
Sors non exiguo proruit impetu,
Non lapsos iterum levet,
Arguto docilis ludere cum joco.
Ne spem projice, Tarquini:
Cujus paene retro lambere pulverem
Et vestigia diceris,
Cum fortuna levem verterit orbitam;
Effusam super and luto
Fumantem poteris cernere purpuram.
Tune and risibus abstine,
Neu turpi domino Lumina paveris:
Neu calces nimium, memor
Fortunae geminam saepe jaci pilam.
Ad Publium Memmium. Ode 2. Lib. 2. Vitae humanae brevitatem benefactis
extendendam esse.
QUae tegit Canas modo bruma valleis,
Sole vicinos jaculante monteis
Deteget rursum. Tibi cum nivosae
Bruma senectae
In caput seris cecidit pruinis,
Decidet nunquam. Cita fugit Aestas,
Fugit Autumnus, fugient propinqui
Tempora veris:
At tibi frigus, capitique cani
Semper haerebunt, neque multa Nardus
Nec parum gratum repetita dement
Serta colorem.
Una quem nobis dederat juventus:
Una te nobis rapiet senectus:
Sed potes, Publi, geminare magna
Saecula fama.
Quem sui raptum gemuere cives,
Hic diu vixit. Sibi quisque famam
Scribat Haeredem: rapiunt avarae
Cetera Lunae.
E Rebus Humanis Excessus. Ode 5. Lib. 2.
HUmana linquo: tollite praepetem
Nubesque ventique. Ut mihi devii
Montes resedere, and volanti
Regna porcul, populosque vastos
Subegit aer! jam radiantia
Delubra Divum, jam mihi regiae
Turres recessere, and relictae in
Exiguum tenuantur urbes;
Totasque quase cunque ferunt vagae
Despecto Gentes. O lacrymabilis
Jncerta fortunae! o fluentum
Principia, interit usque rerum!
Hic ducta primis oppida moenibus
Minantur in Coelum: hic veteres ruunt
Murique turresque: hic supinas
Paene cinis sepelivit arces.
Hic mite Coelum; sed rapidae ruunt
In Bella Gentes: hic placida sedent
In pace, sed late quietos
Dira lues populatur agros.
Hic paene tellus tota micantibus
Ardet sub armis: stant acies adhuc
Pendente fatorum sub ictu,
Et dubio furor haesitavit
In bella passu: part alia recens
Jam mista Mavors agmina mutuam
Collisit in mortem, and Cadentum
Caede virum, Cumulisque latos
Insternit agros: hic Mareoticae
Secura merces aequora navigant,
Portusque certatim frequentes
Centum operis populisque fervent.
Nec una Marti causa, nec unius
Sunt Arma moris. Bellat Adulterae
Ridentis e vultu voluptas,
Inque Helena procus ardet orbis.
Hic verba bellis vindicat: hic canis,
Heu vile furtum! Se mala comparant;
Rarum sub exemplo superbit,
Nec sceleris scelus instar omne est.
Eous illinc belligera latet
Sub Class pontus: Jam Thetis aenea
Mugire flammarum procella, and
Attonitae trepidare cautes,
Et ipsa circum littora percuti
Majore fluctu. Sistite barbari,
Ferroque, neu simplex, and igni, and
Naufragio geminate fatum.
Parumne Te llus in miseras patet
Immensa mortes? hinc miserabili
Quassata terrarum tumultu
Stare pavent titubantque regna,
Unaque tandem funditus obruunt
Cives ruina. Stat tacitus cinis,
Cui serus inscribat viator:
Cum populo jacet hic and ipso
Cum Rege Regnu^. Quid memorem super-
Infusatotis aequora portubus
Urbes inundare, and repenti
Tecta Deum sonuisse fluctu.
Regumque Turres, and pelago Casas
Jam jam latentes? jam video procul
Merceisque differri, and natantem
Oceano fluitare gazam.
Alterna rerum militat efficax
In damna mundus. Cladibus instruit
Bellisque rixisque and ruinis
Sanguine am libitina scenam,
Suprema donec stelligerum dies
Claudat Theatrum. Quid morer hactenus
Viator aurarum and serenas
Sole domos aditurus usque
Humana mirer? tollite praepetem
Festina vatem, tollite nubila
Qua solis and Lunae Labores
Caeruleo vehit aethra Campo.
Ludor? sequaces aut subeunt latus
Feruntque venti? Jamque iterum mihi
Et regna decrevere, and immensae
Ante oculos periere gentes;
Suoque semper terra minor Globo
Jam jamque cerni difficilis, suum
Vanescit in punctum? o refusum
Numinis Oceanum! o carentem
Mortalitatis portubus insulam!
O clausa nullis marginibus freta!
Haurite anhelantem, and perenni
Sarbivium glomerate fluctu.
Ad Publium Memmium. Od. 7. Lib. 2.
ESset humanis aliquod levamen
Cladibus, si res caderent eadem
Qua mora surgunt; sed humant repentes
Alta ruinae.
Nil diu felix stetit; inquieta
Urbium currunt hominumque Fata:
Totque vix horis jacuere, surgunt
Regna quot annis.
Casibus longum dedit ille tempus,
Qui diem regnis satis eruendis
Dixit: elato populos habent momenta sub ictu.
Parce crudeles, moriture Publi,
Impio divos onerare questu,
Densa vicinis nimium vagari
Funeratectis.
Quae tibi primum dedit hora nasci,
Haec mori primum dedit. Ille longum
Vixit, aeternum sibi qui merendo
Vindicat aevum.
Ad Asterium. Ode 8. lib 2.
AT nos inani pascit imagine
Fortuna rerum, Ludimur Asteri,
Umbris amicorum; and doloso
Verba simul placuere fuco,
Res esse stulti credimus. at simul
Sors infidelem corripuit rotam,
Gaudent recedenti Sodales
Non eadem dare verba Divae.
Plerumque falsis nominibus placent
Humana. Rari pollicitis data
Aequamus: and minor loquaci
Relligio solet esse vot^.
Ex sacro Salomonis Epithal. Ode 19. l. 2. Similis est dilectus meus capreae,
hinnuloque cervorum.
Vltas sollicitae me similis caprae,
Quam vel nimbisoni sibilus Africi,
Vel motum subitis murmur Etesiis
Vano corripit impetu.
Nam seu prima metum bruma trementibus
Incussit foliis, sive Diespiter
Elisit resonis tela Cerauniis,
Incerta trepidat fuga.
Atqui non ego te quaerere desinam,
Clamatura retro, Christ, Revertere: and
Rursus, cum rapido fugeris impetu,
Clamatura, Revertere.
O seu te Libani terga virentiae,
Seu formosa rubrae culta Bethuliae,
Seu pinguis Solymae, sive procul cavae
Cingunt rura Capharniae;
Tandem sollicitae pone modum fugae.
Nam non effugies, Te mihi sedulis
Ether excubiis prodet, and aureis
Prodet Cynthia cornibus.
Te neglecta gemunt littora, te procul
Suspirat tacitis aura Favoniis,
Te noctis vigiles, te mihi vividis
Signant sidera nutibus.
Dirae in Herodem. Ode 24. l. 2.
DEvota sacrae progenies domus!
Fatale monstrum! prodigialium
Monstrum parentum! seu Libyssae
Marmaricis lea pavit antris,
Seu te maligno sidere degener
Pardus marita tigride prodidit,
Furoris haredem paterni;
Sive gregis populator Afri
Nudum sub alto destituit jugo;
Seu belluosis fluctibus exspuit
Irata tempestas nocentem
Alitibusque ferisque praedam;
Tuo severas pectore marmora
Duxere venas, marmora rupibus
Decisa, quas Gaetula caelebs
Deucalio super arva iecit:
Te sede primum lividaregia
Megaera fixit: Tisiphone dedit
Sceptrum cruentandum feraeque
Imposuit Diadema fronti; and
Regale nuper cum premeres ebur
Adsedit altis fulta curulibus,
Et per Palaestinos Tyrannis
Explicuit sua signa campos.
Tremensque and atrum sanguine a manu
Telum coruscans secum Odia, and Minas,
Caedemque and insanostumultus,
Funeraque and populorum iniquas
Strages, and indignum excidium retro
Lactantis aevi traxit, and inclyta
Regnorum, inexhaustasque longis
Cladibus evacuavit urbies.
Illam and parentum dira gementium
Lamenta, Questusque, and Gemitus retro,
Luctusque vicatim secuti, and
Irriguis Lacrymae catervis.
Quod si caducis decidit amnibus
Praesagus imber, quid pluvias sequi
Cunctantur ultrices procellae,
Et volucrum strepitu quadrigarum
Incussus ether pigra tonitrua and
Immugientum fulmina nubium
Compescit, indulgentque metae
Aeriis vaga tela pennis?
At nil trisulcis Acroceraunia
Dejecta flammis, nil Rhodopes jugum,
Quassaeve peccavere Cautes
Aemathiae, nisi forte dirum
Inominatis marmora partubus
Fudere monstrum: rumpite, rumpite
Monteisque, faecundasque Regum
Fulmina praecipitate rupeis.
Exspiret auras; occidat, occidat
Funestus, execrabilis, efferus
Sector; crematuramque taxum
Ipse super cumulumque regni
Summum cadaver fumet, and era
Caelumque diro liberet halitu
Fatale monstrum, dissidentum
Ludibrium Furiarum, and Orci.
Perrumpe tractus impenetrabileis
Ignava tellus, desuper ardua
Volvente saxorum ruina:
Quam pelagus super, and refusis
Bis terque Nereus Syrtibus insonet.
Audimur. Ingens sidera verberat,
Spumamque, limumque, and rapaceis
Oceanus glomeravit undas:
Jam nutat ether, jam barathrum prope,
Vastisque campi dissidiis hiant:
Jam fractus illabetur orbis
Sacrilego capiti, i, profunda
Inexpiato pollue Tartara
Tyranne leto: solus and igneum
Insume Cocytum, and frementem
Sulphureis Acheronta ripis.
Ex sacro Salomonis Epithalamio.
Fulcite me floribus, etc.
Adiuro vos, filiae Jerusalem, ne suscitetis, etc.
Ecce iste venit, saliens in montibus, transiliens colles. etc.
ODE 25. LIB 2.
ME stipate rosariis,
Me fulcite crocis, me violariis,
Me vallate Cydoniis,
Me canis, sociae, spargite liliis:
Nam visi mora Numinis
Mi sacris animam torret in ignibus.
Vos o, vos ego filiae
Caelestis Solymae; vos Galaditides,
Vos o per capreas ego
Errantesque jugis hinnuleos precor,
Antiqui genus Isaci,
Quae saltus Libani, quae viridem vago
Carmelum pede visitis,
Nymphae nobilium gloria montium:
Ne vexate tenacibus
Acclinem violis: neu strepitu pedum,
Neu plausae sonitu manus
Pacem solliciti rumpite somnii:
Donec sponsa suo leves
Somnos ex oculis pollice terserit:
Donec Lucicer aureus
Rerum paciferum ruperit otium.
Summis ecce venit jugis
Formosae soboles matris, and unica
Formosi sobeles patris:
Silvarumque super colla comantnium,
Et intonsum Libani caput,
Magnorumque salit terga cacumium ac
Proceras nemorum domos
Prono transiliens praeterit impetu:
Veloci similis caprae
Quae visis humili in valle leonibus,
Per praerupta, per ardua
Sublimi volucris fertur anhelitu.
Ad Egnatium Nollium. Aequo semper rectoque animo, adversus fortunae
inconstantiam standum esse. Ode 4. Lib. 3.
SIve te molli vehet aura vento,
Sive non planis agitabit undis,
Vince Fortunam, dubiasque Nolli,
Lude per arts.
Riserit? vultum generosus aufer.
Fleverit? dulci refer or a risu:
Solus, and semper tuus esse quovis
Disce tumultu.
Ipse te clausus modereris urbem
Consul aut Caesar; quoties minantum
Turba fatorum quatient serenam
Pectoris arcem.
Cum leves visent tua tecta casus,
Laetus occurres: praeunte luctu
Faustitas and pax subeunt eosdem
Saepe Penates.
Dextra sors omnis gerit hoc sinistrum,
Quod facit molleis: habet hoc sinistra
Prosperum, quem nunc ferit, imminenteis
Durat in ictus.
Ille qui longus fuit, esse magnus
Desinit moeror, facilem ferendo
Finge Fortunam; levis esse longo
Discit ab usu.
Ad Marcum Silicernium. Veras esse divitias, quae a bonis animi petuntur. Ode
6. Lib. 3.
NUnquam praecipiti credulus aleae
Cum Fatis avidas composui manus,
Ut mecum taciti foedere praelii
Aequa pace quiescerent.
Quid Fortuna ferat crastina, nesciam,
Haeres ipse mei. Quas dedit, auferet,
Non avellet opes, quae procul extim^
Semotae spatio jacent.
Quae possunt adimi, non me a credidi;
Nunquam pauperior, si meus integer.
Regnum, Marce, mei, si been de meis
Vectigalia censibus-
Intra me numerem. Pars animi latet
Ingens, divitibus latior Indiis,
Quo non ter spatio longius annuo
Itur navibns, aut equis.
Sed men's assiduum visitur in diem
Hospes saepe sui; non ebur, aut novas
Mercatura dapes, ipsa sui satis
Dives, si sibi cernitur.
Ad Aurelium Fuscum. Omnia humana Caduca, incertaque esse. Ode 12. Lib. 3.
SI primum vacuis demere corticem
Rebus, Fusce, velis, cetera diffluunt
Vernae more nivis, quae modo nubium
Leni tabuit halitu.
Formosis reseces fortia; displicent.
Externis trahimur; si male Dardanis
Respondens Helenae pectus amoribus
Famosus videat Paris;
Nusquam per medii pra^ia Nerei
Ventorumque minas splendida deferat
Graii furta thori sed been mutuo
Rerum consuluit jugo
Naturae Dominus, quod niveis nigra,
Laetis occuluit tristia. Qui bona
Rerum de vario deliget agmine,
Consulto sapiet Deo.
Ad Caesarem Pausilipium. Regnum sapientis. Ode 3. Lib 4.
LAte minaces horruimus Lechi
Regnare Thracas. Latius imperat,
Qui solus, exemptus que vulgo
Certa sui tenet arma voti.
Imbelle pectus parce fidelibus
Mvnire parmis; neu latus aspero
Lorica cinctu, neu decorum
Arcus amet pharetraeque collum.
An Cimber, an te lectus ab ultimis
Pictus Britannis ambiat, an Geta,
Nil allabores; ipse miles,
Ipse tibi pugil, ipse Ductor.
Exile regnum, Pausilipi, sumus:
Sed se obsequentem qui sibi subdidit,
Hic grande fecit, si suasmet
Ipse roget peragatque leget.
Armata Regem non faciet cohors,
Non tincta vulgi purpura sanguine,
Aut nobili stellatus auro
Frontis apex, teretique gemma.
Rex est, profanos qui domuit metus:
Qui cum stat unus, casira sibi facit;
Casumque fortunamque pulchro
Provocat assidu us duello.
Non ille vultum fingit ad improbi
Decreta vulgi, non popularia
Theatra, non illum trophaea,
Non volucri movet aura plausu.
Beatus, a quo non humilem gravie
Fortuna vocem, non tumidam levis
Expressit umquam curiosis
Dum tacitus premit ora fatis.
Ad prima si quis vulnera non gemit,
Solo peregit bella silentio:
Cel^ri qui novit sinistros,
Ille potest been far casus.
Ille, and caducis se licet undique
Suspendat auris pontus, and in caput
Unius and flammas, and undam, and
Vertat agens maria omnia Auster,
Rerum ruinas, mentis ab ardua
Sublimis aula non sine gaudio
Spectabit, and late ruenti
Subjiciens sua collo caelo
Mundum decoro vulnere fulciet;
Interque caeli frag^ina, lugubre
Telluris iusistet sepulchrum, ac
Incolumis morientis aevi
Here Is, ab alto prospiciet magis
Haec magna quam sint quae pedibus premit,
Quam quae relinquet; jam tum Olympi
Non dubious moriturus hospes.
Quo cum volentem fata reduxerint,
Nilinterest, an morbus, an hosticus
Impellat ensis, quo supremum
Urget itur. Semel advehemur
Quam navigamus semper in insulam:
Seu lata magnis stravimus aequora
Regis carinis; seu Quirites,
Exigua vehimur phaselo.
Illo beatum margin me meus
Exponat asser. Cur ego sistere
Aeterno reformidem quietus
Littore, si peritura linquam?
Ad Q. Dellium. Non tam populari exemplo, quam potius rationis ductu vitam esse
instituendam. Ode 10. Lib. 4.
DELLI, si populo duce
Vitae degenerem carpimus orbitam,
Erramus, procul arduis
Virtus se nimium seposuit jugis.
Illuc quo via tritior,
Hoc est certa minus. Longus inutili
Error nectitur ordine:
Et mores populum, non ratio trahit.
Casu vivitur, and viam
Non metam premimus, qua praeeuntium
Per vestigia civium
Insanae strepitus plebis, and improba
Voces invidiae vocant.
Exemplis trahimur, and trahimus retro,
Soli nemo sibi est malus.
Nulli vita sua est: dum vaga poster^
Turbam turba premit gradu,
Sunt primi exitio saepe sequentibus.
Me Parnassus and integer
Plebeiis Helicon caetibus eripit
Sublimem; unde vagantium
Errores animorum, and male desidis
Vulgi damna patent, juvat
Ex alto intrepidum colle jacentia
Despectare pericula, and
Cautum non propriis vivere casibus.
Ad Sigismundum Laetum. Gloriae inanis despicientiam and silentium commendat.
Ode 11. l. 4.
Laete, quid cassis sequimur fugacem
Gloriam telis? fugit illa Mauri
More, vel Parthi, regeritque ab ipso
Vulnera tergo.
Hospes unius negat esse tect;
Garrulus vulgi favor: hic inani
Aure rumores legit, inde veris
Falsa remiscet.
Hic velat nidum positurus haesa,
Mox ubi vano vacuum tumultu
Pectus illusit, tacitis in altum
Subsilit alis,
Vera laus sciri fugit, ipse pulcher
Se sua Titan prohibet videri
Luce: qui totus potuit latere,
Major habetur.
Qui premit sacram taciturnitate
Pectoris gazam; been non silenti
Tutus in vulgo been suspicaci
Regnat in aula.
Praterit mutas been cymba ripas;
Quae simul raucis strepuere saxis,
In latus cautam sapiens memente
Avertere proram.
Ad Ianum Libinium. Solitudinem su^m excusat. Ode 12. Lib. 4.
QUid me latentem sub tenui lare
Dudum moretur, cum mihi civium
Amica certatim patescant
Atria, saepe rogas Libini.
Me plenus extra quid cupiam? me^
In memetipsum clausus ab ostio,
In se recedentis reviso
Scenam animi, vacuumque relustre
Vitae theatrum, sollicitus mei
Spectator, an quae fabula prodii
Matura procedam, and supremo
Numinis excipienda plausu.
Omnes recenset numen, and approbat
Vel culpat actus: quo mea judice
Si scena non leve peracta est,
Sim populo sine test felix.
O di loquacis compita gloriae
Plebeia: quam cum fama faventibus
Evexit auris saepe misso
Invidiae stimulata telo,
Aut invidentum territa vocibus,
Parum obstinatis and male fortibus
Dimittit alis. Illa nudam
Plangit humum, lacerosque saxis
Affligit artus. Me melius tegat
Privata virtus, and popularia
Numquam volaturum per ora
Celet iners sine laud tectum.
Semota laudem si meruit, vetat
Audire virtus. tutius invidi
Longinqua miramur: propinquis
Laevus amat comes ire Livor.
Ad Caesarem Pausilippium. Adversa constanti animo ferenda esle. Ode 13. Lib. 4.
SI quae flent mala lugubres
Auferrent oculi Sidoniis ego
Mercarer been lacrymas
Gemmis, aut teretum merce monilium.
At, ceu rore seges viret,
Sic crescunt riguts tristia fletibus.
Urget lacryma lacrymam;
Fecundusque sui se numerat Dolor.
Quem fortuna semel virum
Udo degenerem lumine viderit,
Illum saepe ferit; mala
Terrentur tacito fata silentio.
Ne te, ne tua fleveris
Quae tu, care, vocas, Pausilipi, mala,
Quam pellunt lacrymae, fovent
Sortem: dura negant cedere mollibus.
Siccas si vide at genas,
Durae cedet hebes sors patientiae.
Ad Crispum Laevinium. Rogatus cursaepe per viam caneret, responder. Ode 44.
Lib 4.
CUm meam nullis humeros onustus
Sarcinis tecum patriam reviso
Laetus, and parvo mihi cumque dives
Canto viator.
Tu siles moestum: tibi cura Musas
Demit, and multi grave pondus auri.
Quaeque te quondam malefida rerum
Turba relinquet.
Dives est qui nil habet; illa tantum
Quae potest certa retinere dextra,
Seque fert secum vaga quo, migrare
Jussit egestas.
Quid mihi, qui nil cupiam, deesse
Possit? umbrosi placet una Pindi
Vallis: o sacrum nemus, o jocosae
Rura Camoenae!
Quae meos poscet via cunque gressus,
Delphici mecum, mea regna, colles
Itis, and fessum comitante circum-
Sistitis umbra.
Me Gothus saevis religet catenis,
Me Scythes captum rapiat soluta
Mente, vobiscum potero tremendos
Visere Reges.
Ad Munatium. Nihil in rebus humanis non taedio plenum esse. Ode 15. Lib. 4.
NUest, Munati, nil, iterum canam,
Mortale, nil est, immedicabilis
Immune taedi. Clarus olim
Sol proavis atavisque nobis,
Parum salubris, nec macula reus
Damnatur una; quicquid in arduo
Immortale mortales Olympo
Vidimus, invidiae caduca
Fuscamus umbra. non placet incolis
Qui Sol avitis exoritur jugis;
Aut prisca quae dudum paternam
Luna ferit radiis fenestram.
Calo quotannis, and patriis leves
Migramus arvis; hunc tepidae vocant
Brumae Batavorum, huic aprici
Ausoniae placuere soles.
Frustra; fideles si dominum retro
Morbi sequuntur, nec tacitus Dolor
Absistit, aut Veiente curru,
Aut Veneta comes ire cymba.
Tandemque nobis exulibus placent
Relicta; certam cui posuit domum
Virtus, huic nunquam paternae
Fumus erit lacrymosus aulae.
Virtus agresti dives in otio
Sese ipsa claudit finibus in suis
Plerumque, and insonti quietum
In pale a solium reclinat.
Ad Iesum Opt. Max. Ex sacro Salomonis Epithalamio, Indica mihi quem diligit
anima mea, ubi pascas, ubi cubes in meridie. Ode 19. Lib. 4.
DIcebas abiens: Sponsa vale; simul
Vicisti liquidis nubila passibus.
Longam ducis, Jesu,
In desideriis moram.
Ardet am medio summa dies polo,
Jam parcit segeti messor, and algidac
Pastor cum grege valle is,
Er pictae volucres petunt.
At te quae tacitis destinet otiis
O Jesu regio? quis mihi te locus
Caecis invidet umbris,
Aut spissa nemorum coma?
Scirem quo jace as cespite languidus,
Quis ventus gracili praeflet anhelitu,
Quis rivus tibi grato
Somnum praetere at sono;
Ah! ne te nimio murmr suscitent
Nostrae diluerent flumina lacrymae,
Et suspiria crudis
Miscerentur Etesiis.
Ex sacro Salomonis Epithalamio. En dilectus meus loquitur mihi: Surge, propera
amica mea, columba mea, formosa mea, and veni. Iam enim hiems transiit, imber
abiit and recessit. etc. Ode 21. Lib. 4.
FAllor? an Elysii lava de part Sereni
Me mea vita vocat!
Surge soror, pulchris innectito lora columbis;
Pulchrior ipsa super
Scande rot as, Libanique levem de vertice currum,
Has, age flecte domos.
Ad tua decidu fugiunt vestigia nimbi,
Turbidus imber abiit:
Ipsa sub innocuis mitescunt fulmina plantis,
Ipsa virescit hiems.
Interea sacris aperit se scena viretis
Sub pedibusque tibi
Altera floret humus, alterque vagantia late
Sidera pascit ager.
Hic etiam trepidi pendent e rupibus hoedi,
Praecipitesque caprae;
Hinnaleique suis, passim dum flumina tranant,
Luxuriantur aquis.
It Leo cum Pardo viridis de colle Saniri
Mitis uterque regi,
Cumque suo passim ludunt in montibus agno
Exsuperantque juga.
Plurimus hos circum tacito pede labitur amnis,
Pumicibusque cavis
Per violas lapsae, per declives hyacinthos,
Exspatiantur aquae.
Been fluunt rivi, muscosis lene susurrus
Murmurat e scopulis.
In vitrio pisces saliunt hilares crystallo,
Dulce queruntur aves.
Nec vero, si moesta placent saletia, caelo
Flobile murmur abest:
Nam sibi dum vestro regemunt ex orb palumbes,
Huc sonus ille venit.
Sic dum se viduo solatur Carmine turtur,
Gandia nostra placent.
Cetera non desunt. pronis vindemia pendet
Officio sa botris,
Hic etiam vulgo violas, albentia vulgo
Ungue ligustra leges:
Ipsa tibi, leti succos oblita priores,
Mitia poma cadent:
Ipsae matura labentur ab arbore ficus,
Percutientque sinum.
Interea falcem vindemia nescit, aratrum
Saucia nescit humus.
Ipsae sponte virent segetes, innoxius ipse
Messibus albet ager.
Praebent Hospitium platasi: praebet formosos
Graminis herba toros.
Caedua Pa^chaeos sudant opobalsama nimbos;
Et genialis odor
Aspirat quoties, nut antibus hinc atque illinc
Ingruit aura comis.
Surge; quid indignos ducis per taedia soles?
Surge, age, cara soror.
Ecce tuis ipsae jam circum fraena columbae
Ingemuere moris.
Huc age, formosas formosior ipsa columbas
Hospita flecte soror.
Ad Ianussium Skuminum. Cum conjugi charissimae justa per solveret. (...). Ode
30. Lib. 4.
SI tibi pollicitum numen, si fata fuissent
Aeternos fore conjugis annos;
Jure per assiduos (procerum fortissime) fletus
Ereptam quererere, Janussi.
Quem Pietas, quem non moveat uon tristibus unquane
Arx animi concussa procellis
Et pudor, and proni niveo de pectore sensus,
Et Regina modestia morum,
Aut bona sedulitas, aut non incauta futuri
Praesagae solertia montis?
Provida sed longum magnis virtutibus aevum
Non audent promittere fata:
Nec possunt, si quae maturavere, profanis
Astra diu committere terris,
Nunc adeo paerces longis onerare querelis
Depositum repetentia magnum,
Ingentes animi gazas, and robur, and aureo
Jncoctum been pectus honesto.
Sic Tanaquil, sic quae cunctantem Claudia rexit
Virgin a cervice Cybellen,
Quaeque maritali successit Thessala fato,
Et Latiis vaga Cloelia ripis;
Ante diem raptae vivunt post funera, varum
Perpetuos in carmine fastos.
Illa quide^ non, si surdos ad carmina Manes
Orphea testudiue vincaem,
Educt as adamante fores, and ahene a rumpat
Elysiii pomoeria muri,
Reddaturque tibi. Stat aulli janua voto,
Nullis exorata Poetis.
Sunt tamen exiles insigni in limine rimae
Qua possint arcana videri,
Hac ego, si nullos fallunt insomia maneis,
Aut vidi, aut vidisse putavi
Errantem campo in magno, quem gemmea circum
Perspicuis stant moenia portis:
Auro prata virent; arbor crinitur in aurum;
Crispantur viol aria gemmis,
Quae nec Apellaeus liquor, nec pulchra trigoni
Assimulent mendacia vitri,
Centum ibi formosis in vallibus Heroinae
Aeternum Paeana frequentant.
Stant virides campo stellae, madidisque corusca
Connivent sibi sidera flammis.
Illa inter medias parvo comitata nepote
Et roseo vivacior ore,
Ibat ovans, grandemque sibi, grandemque nepoti
Nectebat de flore coronam.
Cetera me vetuit magni caligo sereni
Mortali percurrere visu.
Nec tu plura velis; satis est, cui fata dederunt
Aeternis mutasse caduca.
Ad Albertum Turscium. De suis somniis and lyricis. Ode 32. Lib. 4.
TUrsci, seu brevior mihi
Seu pernox oculos composuit sopor,
Pennas Somnia laevibus
Assigunt humeris; jamque virentia
Laetus prata superuolo,
Qua se cumque novum molle tumentibus
Campis explicuit nemus,
Herbosaeque patet scena superbiae:
Mox and nubibus altior,
Mistus flumineis ales oloribus;
Vivos despicio lacus,
Et dulci volucrem carmine mentior.
Jam tunc nubila, jam mihi
Blandis dissiliunt fulmina cantibus;
Et quae plurima circuit
Collum, punice a vincior Iride.
Idem jam vigil, and meus,
Non ingrata simul somnia dispuli,
Cum ter mobilibus lyram
Percussi digitis, immemor and ducis
Nil sectator Horatii,
Sublimis liquidum nitor in era;
Et nunc littora, nunc vag as
Siccis trajiciens passibus insulas,
Nil mortale mei gero, and
Jam nil sollicito debeo ponderi.
Tursci, saepe tamen mones
Olim ne veteri clarior Icaro
Veris fabula casibus
Mutem Parrhasii nomina Balthiri.
Frustra; nam memor Icari,
Addo stultitiae consilium brevi:
Nam, seu dormio, me torus;
Seu scribo, stabili sella tenet situ.
Ad Quintum Tiberinum. Ode 34. Lib. 4.
DIvitem nunquam, Tiberine, dices,
Cujus Eois potiora glebis
Rura, fortunae sine faece pulcher
Rivus inaurat.
Quem per insigneis geniale ceras
Stemma claravit; vaga quem per urbes
Quem per and gentes radiante vexit
Gloria curru.
Pauper est, qui se caret; and superbe
Ipse se librans, sua rur a latam
Addit in lancem, socioque fallens
Pondus in auro,
Ceteris parvus, sibi magnus uni,
Ipse se nescit, pretioque falsae
Plebis attollit, propriaque se miratur in umbra.
Splendidam vera fine luce gazam,
Turgidum plena sine laud nomen
Mitte; te solo, Tiberine, disces
Esse beatus.
Ad Paulum Coslovium. Ode 35. Lib. 4.
I Am pridem tepido veris anhelitu
Afflarunt reduces arva Favonii;
Jam se florida vernis
Pingunt prat a coloribus:
Siratus frugiferis Vilia puppibus
Grato praeter abit rura silentio,
Quamvis proximus omni
Collis personet alite;
Quamvis and viridi pastor ab aggere
Dicat gramine a carmina fistula.
Et qui navita debet
Plenis otia carbasis.
Aequas Palladiis, Paulle, laboribus
Inter pone vices. Cras simul aureo
Sol arriserit ore
Summorum jug a montium,
Scandemus viridis terga Luciscii,
Qua celsa tegitur plurimus ilice,
Et se praetereuntum
Audit murmura fontium.
Illinc e medio tota videbitur
Nobis Vilna jugo; tota videbitur
Quae Vilnam sinuosis
Ambit Vilia flexibus.
Illinc picta procul quae radiantibus
Fulgent fana tholis, and geminam super
Despecta bimus arcem,
Magni regna Palaemonis.
Ut longo faciles Pacis in otio
Se tollunt populi! nam tria tertio
Surrexere sub anno
Priscis templa Quiritibus;
Et qua conspicuis se Gediminia
Jactant saxa jugis, and Capitolium,
Et quae tecta superbis
Intrant nubila turribus.
Auget magna, Quies: exiguus labor
In majus modico provenit otio^
Hinc and terga virentum
Late prospice collium.
Quae nunc mobilibus nut at Etesiis,
Segni cana stetit sub nive populus:
Qui nunc defluit, alta
Haesit sub glacie latex:
Qui nunc purpureis floret ager rosis,
Immoto sterilis delituit gelu:
Verno quae strepit ales,
Hiberno tacuit die.
Ergo rumpe moras, and solidum grave
Curae deem diem, quem tibi candidus
Spondet vesper, and albis
Cras Horae revehent equis.
Ad Paulum Iordanum Vrsinum Bracciani Ducem. Bracciani agri amoenitatem
commendat, ad quam per ferias Septembres secesserat Roma. Ode 1. Lib. Epod.
HUc o quietis apta Musis otia,
Levesque Ludorum chori;
Huc feriantum Phoebe Musarum pater,
Huc hospitales Gratiae;
Huc delicatis ite permisti Jocis
Non inverecundi Sales:
Hic otio si mite Bracciani solum
Vago coronemus pede.
Clemens supino clivus assurgit jugo,
Caelumque paulatim subit,
Et solida subter terga scopulorum arduo
Securus insessu premit:
Arcisque jactat inter alta turrium
Insigne propugnacula,
Timenda quondam Caesarum turmis ducum,
Timenda magno Borgiae,
Cum per minantum militum aeratos globos
Metuenda jaceret fulmina,
Ageretque profugum Caesarem, and quassum metu,
Adusque promissum Nihil.
Hic ille magnus fraenat Etruscas opes
Ursmus Heroum decus,
Haeres avitae laudis, and princeps caput
Magnaeque laus Oenotriae.
Circum coruscis scena quercetis viret,
Caelumque verrit frondibus,
Suoque colles vestit, and patentibus
Sese theaetris explicat.
Admota muris pone Nympharum domus
Aprica praebet littora:
Ripamque Baccho jung it, and vallum prope
Lentis flagellat fluctibus.
Majore nusquam stagna Neptuno sonant,
Aut aestuantis Larii,
Aut qui severo tangit Albanus lacu
Inenatabilem Styga:
Aut quae procellis gaudet, and magno fremit
Superba ponto Julia:
Nec major usquam spumat, and rupes truci
Benacus assultat salo.
Intonsa curvo monte circumstant juga,
Mitesque despetant aquas.
Nivosus illinc terga Romanus movet,
Caeloque diducit minas:
Illinc caducis ilicem quassat comis
Sublime Cymini caput:
Crudumque Boream frangit impotentibus
Depraeliaturum Notis,
Terrisque late regnat, and caeli minis
Opponit hibernum latus.
Amica sternit interim lacum quies,
Fluctusque fluctu nititur,
Et ipsa secum pigra luctatur Thetis,
Aquaeque colludunt aquis:
Quas vel carina, vel citata turgido
Findit phaselus linteo:
Pinnaque late vitreum cogens pecus
Velente lino truditur,
Setaque piscem ducit, and raris procul
Lacum coronat retibus.
Hinc alta lucet divitis Pollae domus,
Hinc pinguis Anguilaria:
Trebonianas hinc amica vineas
Vadosa plangunt aequora:
Hinc delicati fundus Aureli nitet,
Lymphae salutaris pater:
Undaque morbos arcet, and vivacibus
Lucem fluentis eluit.
At qua superbum fontibus nomen dedit
Suumque Flora marginem,
Vivis perennes decidunt saxis aquae,
Camposque decursu lavant,
Patremque long Tybrin, and regem sonant,
Romaeque servitum fluunt.
Sincera circum regna naturae nitent,
Et artis immunes loci:
Adhucque virgo sulcus, and montes adhuc
Molleis inexperti manus,
Meramque Bacchus Tethyn, and Bacchum Thetis,
Et pinguis invitat Ceres.
Hinc ille laetus surgit, and tenacibus
Inserpit ulmis Evius,
Udoque cornu turget, and fluentibus
Crinem racemis impedit.
Non Lesbos illi, non odorati magis
Vineta rident Massici,
Aut quae Falernis educata solibus
Sublucet uvae purpura.
Sed nee Falisci glaream malit soli,
Nec pinguis uber Rhaetiae;
Nec flava tantum culta felicis Cypri,
Graiamve dilexit Rhodon:
Quantum suis superbit, and sese suis
Miratur in canalibus.
Circum beatis imperat campis Ceres.
Lateque rura possidet:
Et arva flavo messium fluctu tument,
Motuque culmorum natant.
Innube rarus inquinat caelum vapor,
Aut tensa nimbis vellera:
Aut e Boreis bella ventorum plagis,
Raucusque silvarum fragor
Auditur usquam: non protervis insonant
Exercitati Syrtibus,
Euris and Austris contumaces Africi,
Et perdnellibus Notis.
Tantum serenus Vesper, and tenerrima
Etesiarum flamina.
Albique soles, and serena lucidis
Aspirat aura montibus:
Puramque caelo provehunt Horae facem,
Et Phoebus Horarum pater
Peculiari luce colles irrigat,
Pronaque perfundit die.
Ramis tepentes ingruunt Favonii
Jocantis aurae sibilo,
Et temperatis provocant suspiriis,
Lenique somnum murmr.
At non loquaces interim nidi tacent,
Matresque nidorum vagae.
Sed aut maritis turtur in ramis gemit,
Et saxa rumpit questibus,
Aut laeta late cantibus mulcet loca
Famosa pellex Thraciae,
Silvisque coram plorat, and crudelibus
Accusat agris Terea:
Quaecumque moestae vocibus dicunt aves,
Respondet argutum nemus.
Affatur alnum quercus, ornum populus,
Affatur ilex ilicem,
Et se vicissim collocuta reddicis
Arbusta solantur sonis.
Huc o Quiritum ductor, huc Oenotriae
O magne regnator plagae
Jordane, tandem plenus urbis and fori,
Rerumque magnarum satur,
Sepone curis temet, and domesticis
Furare pectus otiis.
Hic vel tuarum lene tranabis vadum
Opacus umbris arborum,
Tuosque colleis inter, and tu as procul
Perambulabis ilices:
Vel cum Decembri campus, and prima nive
Vicina canescent juga;
Nunc impeditas mollibus plagis feras,
Silvamque praecinges metu:
Nunc incitato capream rumpes equo,
Teloque deprendes aprum;
Jactoque cervos collocabis spiculo,
Furesque terrebis lupos.
Quid si Latinae laus Alexander plagae,
Sacraeque sidus purpurae,
Tecum paterno feriabitur solo,
Seseque curis eximet;
Tuique cives, hospitesque civium
Toto fruemur gaudio.
Ad fontem Sonam. In patrio fundo, dum Roma rediisset. Ode 2. Lib. Epod.
FOns innocenti lucidus magis vitro
Puraque purior nive,
Pagi voluptas, una Nympharum sitis,
O celle natalis soli.
Longis viarum languidus laboribus
Et mole curarum gravis
Thuscis ab usque gentibus redux, tibi
Accline prosterno latus:
Permit siccus, qua potes, premi; cava
Permit libari mann.
Sic te quietum nulla perturbet pecus,
Ramusve lapsus arbore:
Sic dum loquaci prata garritu secas,
Et laetus audiri salis;
Assibilantes populetorum comae
Ingrata ponant murmura
Tibi, lyraeque Vatis: haud frustra sacer
Nam siqnid Urbanus probat,
O lim fluenti lene Blandusiae nihil
Aut Sirmioni debeas.
Palinodia Ad secundam libri Epodon Odam Q. Horatii Flacci. Laus otii
Religiosi. Ode 3. Lib. Epod.
AT ille, Flacce, nunc erit beatior,
Qui mole curarum procul
Paterna liquit rura, litigantium
Solutus omni jurgio;
Nec solis aestum frugibus timet suis,
Nec sidus hiberni Jovis,
Rixasque vitat, and scelesta curiae
Rapacioris limina.
Ergo aut profanis hactenus negotiis
Amissa plorat sidera;
Aut in reducta sede dispersum grege^
Errantis animi colligit,
Post quam beatae lucra conscienti^
Quadrante libravit suo.
Idem, propinqua nocte, stellatas vigil
Cum vesper accendit faces,
Ut gaudet immortale mirari jubar,
Terraque majores globos,
Et per cadenteis intueri lacrymas
Rimosa lucis atria,
Quae Christ tecum, virgo quae tecum colat
Perennis haeres saeculi!
Volvuntur aureis interim stella rotis,
Pigrumque linquunt exulem,
Per ora cujus uberes eunt aquae,
Somnos quod avertat graveis.
At quando letum Gangis aut Indi fretis
Jam Phoebus attollit caput,
Mentis profundus, and sui totus minor
Irata flect it numina:
Vel cum sereno fulserit dies Jove,
Aprilibusque feriis,
Assueta caelo lumina, in terras vocat:
Lateque prospectum jacit,
Camposque lustrat, and relucentem sua
Miratur in scena Deum.
En omnis inquit, herba non morantibus
In astra luctatur comis:
Semotacaelo lacrymantur, and piis
Liquuntur arva fletibus;
Ligustra canis, and rosae rubentibus
Repunt in auras brachiis;
Astrisque panda nescio quid pallido
Loquuntur ore lilia,
Et sero blandis ingemunt suspiriis,
Et mane rorant lacrymis.
Egone solus, solus in terris piger
Tenace figor pondere?
Sic and propinquas allocutus arbores,
Et multa coram fontibus
Rivisque fatus, quaerit Auctorem Deum
Formosa per vestigia.
Quod si levandas mentis in curas vigil
Ruris suburbani domut;
Quales Lucisci, vel Nemecini Lares,
Udumve Besdani nemus
Rudeis adornet rustica mensas dape
Siccos sub Augusti dies;
Jam tunc sub ipsum limen, aut domestica
Lenis sub umbra populi,
Expectat omnis hospitem suum penus,
Et concha sinceri salis,
Pressique meta lactis, and purus calix,
Et hospitalis amphora,
Et fraga, raris verna quae dumis legit,
Jucunda panis praemia.
Non me scari tunc, non Lucrinorum gravis
Saginamulorum juvet:
Sed cereu^ palumbus, aut turtur niger;
Au^nser amnis accola,
Et eruditam quae fugit gulam faba,
Laetumque nec simplex olus,
Et quae suprema colligitur, ac gravi
Patella nil debet foro.
Post haec vel inter laeta quercetis juga,
Vel inter amneis juverit
Vitare tristeis post meridiem Notos
Sub aesculo vel ilice;
Nigrumve littus, aut opaca lubricis
Tranare stagna lintribus,
Jactaque fruge ludibundum ducere
Tremente piscem linea.
Remugit ingens interim tauris nemus,
Umbrosa balant flumina;
Et aut in antris garriunt acanthides,
Aut in rubis lusciniae.
Hinc per rubeta pastor errantes capras
Vocante cogit fistula:
Illinc herili messor e campo redux
Alterna plaudit carmina;
Et pressa sectos plaustra per sulcos gemunt
Ruptura ruris horrea.
At nec tacemus pone considentium
Dulcis manus sodalium;
Nec infacet a sermo differtur mora,
Sed innocentibus jocis,
Multoque tinctus, sed verecundo sale,
Innoxium trahit diem.
Haec si videret faenerator Alphius,
Olim futurus rusticus,
Quam collocarat Idibus pecuniam,
Nollet Kalendis ponere.
Epig. 4. Ex Lib. Ep. Veniat delectus meus in hortum suum. Cant. 5.
PUlcher Amor sumpsit rudis instrumenta coloni,
Et sua deposuit tela suasque faces:
Et manibus stivam rapuit; castique laboris
Ad su a ruricolas junxit aratra boves.
Ilicet, ut facili subvertit vomere corda,
Castaque virginibus Graetia crevit agris;
Flos, ait, unus abest: sunt cetera millia florum;
Ut nullus possit, Christ, deesse, Veni.
Qualis est Dilectus tuus? ex Cant. 5. Ex Lib. Epig. 37.
QUalis erat, tuus ille? tuus pulcherrimus ille?
Dicebat nuper barbara turba mihi.
Arripio dextra pennam, laevaque tabellam,
Et noto, Christ, tuo quicquid in orb noto.
Pingo rosas, aurum, gemmas, viridaria, silvas,
Arva, lacus, celeri sidera pingo manu;
Et tabulam monstrans, Noster pulcherrimus, inquam,
Qualis erat, vultis discere? talis erat.
Epig. 40. Lib. Ep. Veni de Libano sponsa.

Non fugis, ut fugias: ut capiare, fugis,
Ex lib. Epi. 48. -- Lilia manu praeferenti.
Haec, quae virgineis nituntur lilia culmis,
Unde verecundas explicuere comas?
Non generant similes Paestana rosaria flores,
Nec simili Pharius mess superbit ager:
Non haec purpureis matter Corcyra viretis,
Nec parit aequoreis pulsa Carystos aquis.
Cum nullas habeant natales lilia terras,
Qui neget e cast a lilia nata manu?
Ex Lib. Ep. 51. Iohanni de Lugo, dum post morbum ad intermissam de Poenitentia
doctrinam rediret.
FErtur inornatis nuper Metanoea capillis
Flesse, repentina cum raperere febri:
Fertur and indomit o fraenos laxasse dolori,
Et lacrymis madidos exhibuisse sinus:
Cum rursus domito repetis tua pulpita morbo,
Fertur inornatas disposuisse comas:
Et domitos hilari risu fraenasse dolores,
Et lacrymis vacuos explicuisse sinus.
Quis, Pater, incolumi de te non gaudeat, ipsae
Si gaudent Lacrymae, ridet and ipse Dolor?
Christi in Cruce vox. Ep. 110. SITIO.
AH sitio, clamas, Princeps pulcherrime rerum:
Non habeo pro te dulcia vina, siti.
Tu tamen, ah sitio, clamas: dabo pocula, Sponse:
Heu mihi! sed misto pocula fell dabo.
Haec mi Sponse, bibe: quaeris cui forte propines?
Ad me pro mundi, Christ, salute bibe.
Od. 1. Lib. 1. When the hateful forces of the Thracians departed out of
Pannonia.
THe threats of cruel War now cease:
In stead of them safety and peace,
Banished the unhallowed earth, do please
'Returne in their white Waine;
Faith joined with Truth, and Plenty too
Over pleasant fields do nimbly go;
The precious Ages past, do flow
With liberal streams again.
Clear days, such years as were of old
Recalled are, of the ancient mold,
The Heavens hayle Pearls, and molten Gold
Does rain downright in showers;
Whilst I with my Prophetique string
Thy Winter feastivalls do sing,
The whole world does with Echoes ring
Old Saturn's age is ours.
Our Fathers pure and golden rule
Exiled as far as farthest Thule,
Justice from bright Olympus school
Comes boldly back again.
The streams which Milk and Honey yield,
Their passage cut through open field,
And the full banks with Nectar swelled
Do drown the flowrie plain.
The glad Corn in the restles stalk
Waves, and the fields as we do walk,
So fruitful reele, to any balke
The Heat no spite does owe.
The Herdsmans Pipe to's wandering Goats,
Provokes the Grasshoppers hoarse notes;
The tired Herd with strayned throats,
Makes Hills and Woods to low.
The Mountains leap, and rough Rocks smile
For gentle Peace rejoices still
Such solitary rooms to fill
Hills set apart, 'lone Towns.
Ceres with yellow Chaplet, and
The Summer rich with ears does stand,
Great Prince of our appeased Land,
Thee to encompasse round.
The Myrtle begs with humble shade
To serve thee, and the Laurel's glade;
The lofty Oak does rise; Its head
The trembling Pine does bow;
He that over Stars and earth has power,
Beholding us, from his bright Tower,
Calms all, and sets thee father over
The covetous world below.
The Laurel sign long life to thee,
Let Fates and destinies agree
To twine thy thread, which cannot be
Cut 'till the appointed time.
May she amidst those glorious fires,
For thy sake, pitying our desires,
'Bout whom the beauteous stars inquires,
And flowing measures swim;
May she, I say, our Country's grief
Cure, and the chaste complaints relieve
Of all our youth, and willing ears
Apply to the prayers of all our Peers.
To Aurelius Lycas. Ode 2. Li. 1. That he would not complain too much of
adverse fortune.
UNmanly howlings, Lycuas, leave,
Thy sad breast do not vex, nor grieve;
Thy rugged brow from clouds set free,
Although with usual beams 'on thee
The Sun not shines; or fortune late
Has thrown the hardest chance of Fate.
With the waves, that South winds toss to day,
The cheerful Eastern gales will play;
The Sun that now hangs down his head,
With joy from blushing Thetis bed
IN the morn will rise. Laughter and woe
Keep time, and in their courses go.
Clear merriment succeeds wet eyes,
And joys in midst of sorrows rise.
Thus pleases it the Fates, that flow
With various hazards here below.
He who his Oxen tired, did drive,
Does laws to day, to the City give:
And the same yokes he took from those,
Upon the Citizens impose.
The day star great, that man does see,
Whom the Evening saw in low degree.
But if the things that serious are
With Fortunes pastimes to compare
Does please you; See, this Countryman
Betakes himself to's farm again,
Of's jeering neighbors the only sport,
And with those Axes which in the Court
He ruled all with, Cleaves his wood,
Whose Helves are made of Laurel good.
And if a want of wood there grows,
The Fasces on the fire he throws.
To Tarquinius Lavinus. Ode 13. lib. 1.
AS if the Sun that once does set,
From the blushing East a new birth does not get;
As if that those whom Fortunes frown
By the swift violence of her wheel, throws down,
She would not raise again with ease,
So active in such nimble sports as these.
Despair not (Sir) whose footsteps now
You Are said to kiss, and lick the dust of's shoe,
Let Fortune her light wheel but turn,
And then Tarquinius, thou shall soon discern
From his proud height, him downward thrust,
His trampled robes smoking in mire and dust.
Thy jeeres and laughter then forbear,
His all-bespattred looks thou shall nor fear,
Nor trample on, remembering how
Fortune a doulble ball does often throw.
To Publius Memmius. Ode 2. Lib. 2. That the shortness of man's life is to be
lengthened by good deeds.
THe Valleys, now, all clad in gray
By Winter, when Sol darts his ray
On neighboring hills, he will naked lay,
As heretofore.
But when the winter of thy years
With snow, within thy locks appears,
When hoary frost shall dye thine hairs,
It parts no more.
Summer, and Autumn's quickly gone,
The approaching Spring will pass as soon:
Gray hayres, and chilling cold alone
With thee will stay.
To thy ill color, Nard distilled,
Nor the renewed perfumes of the field
Of flowers, can any virtue yield,
Or take it away.
Thee, whom thy youth has given to day,
At night old age will take away,
Thy time to double, is, to lay
A same most bright.
Whom snach'd by death, his friends bemone,
He has lived long. Let every one
Write Fames sole heir: that is free alone,
From the rape of night.
A Departure from things humane. Ode 5. Lib. 2.
LIft me up quickly on your wings,
Ye Clouds, and Winds; I leave all earthly things,
How Devious Hills give way to me!
And the vast air brings under, as I fly,
Kingdoms and populous states! see how
The Glyst'ring Temples of the Gods do bow;
The glorious Towers of Princes, and
Forsaken towns, shrunk into nothing, stand:
And as I downward look, I spy
Whole Nations every where all scattred lie.
Oh the sad change that Fortune brings!
The rise and fall of transitory things!
Here walled towns that threatened Heaven,
Now old and ruined, with the earth lie even:
Here stately Palaces, that thrust
Their heads in the air, lie buried all in dust.
Here the Air Temperate is and mild,
But the fierce people rush to wars, most wild:
Here in a joyful peace they rest,
But Direful Murraines their quiet fields lay wast.
Here the whole Land does scorching lie
Under the glittering Arms of the Enemy:
Under the hovering stroke of the Fates
The Armies yet both stand; and fury waits
With doubfull steps, upon the war;
Fresh courage here, the mingled troops prepare,
Each against other fiercely run,
And mutually they work destruction:
The slaughtered heaps in reeking gore
With bloody covering spread the fields all over:
Here on safe Seas, as joyful prize
Is stripped away the Egyptian Merchandise,
Whilst the full Havens thick beset,
Do furiously with fierce contention fret.
Mars has his diverse Causes, and
His several fashioned weapons to command.
From the Adultresse smiling looks
Pleasure does fight, and unto War provokes,
The doting world with Helen burns.
This sordid man, oh base advantage! turns
Revenge of words to blows;
Mischief begets it self, from mischief grows.
Small sins by example higher dare,
Nor does all sin, alvvaies like sin appear.
There the Eastern Sea lies coverd over
With warlike Fleets: Thetis begins to rore
With storms of flaming Brass, and here
The astonished Rocks all trembling stand with fear.
The troubled Sea with winds beset
With stronger waves against the full shore does beat.
Forbear, cruel men to multiply
With fire, Sword-vvrack your single destiny.
Is the large Earth too narrovv grown,
Such slaughters, such dire tragedies to own?
Large Kingdoms there, brought under thrall
With Tumult, stagger, and for fear do fall;
Where in one Ruin we may see
The dying people all o'rewhelmed lie.
The silent dust remains, to let
The weary Pilgrim this Inscription set
(In after times, as he goes by)
King, Kingdom, People here entombed lie.
What should I name the raging Seas,
Whole Havens overflowing, and with these
IN the sudden flood whole Cities drowned
The shaken Temples of the Gods that sound?
Kings Palaces what should I name
Now sunkei' the deep, small Cottages in the same?
Vast wealth I see swept down with the tide
Rich treasure in the Ocean floting glyde.
The active world t'each others harms
Does daily fight, and the pale Goddess arms
The bloody scene with slaughters, wars,
With utter ruins, and with deadly jarrs;
Thus there is no Exit of our woes,
Till the last day the Theater shall close,
Why stay I then, when go I may-
To 'a house enlightened by the Suns bright ray?
Shall I still dote on things humane?
Lift up your longing Priest, ye Clouds, oh deigne
Lift m'up where the air a splendor yields
Lights the sun's chariot through the azure fields.
Am I deceived? or do I see
The following winds on their wings mounting me,
And now again Great kingdoms lie
Whole Nations perishing before mine eye?
The earth which always less has been
Then Is Globe, and now, just now can scarce be seen,
Into it is point does vanish, see!
Oh the brim'd Ocean of the Deity!
Oh Glorious Island richly free
From the cold Harbors of mortality!
Ye boundless seas, with endless floods of rest
Girt round Sarbinius your panting Priest.
To Publius Memmius. Ode 7. Lib. 2.
AMidst our loss it were some ease,
If things did fall, with the same stay, and leisure
They rise; but sudden ruins seize
On our most lofty things, and richest treasure.
Nothing long time has happy been.
The restless Fates of peopled-Cities, pass:
In a few hour's destroyed we have seen,
In many years what never raised was.
He gave to Chance long time, that said
One day's enough, whole Kingdoms t'overthrow:
Each moment holds a people swayd
Under a fatal and exalted blow.
Being near thy death, then, Publius, spare
To load the Gods, with thy blasphemous plaints;
That Funerals so frequent are,
Or death so much thy neighbors houses haunts.
The hour, that first to thee gave life,
That thou should likewise dye, gave first to thee.
He has lived long, who well does strive
Sure always of eternal life to be.
To Asterius. Ode 8. l. 2.
VV'Are mocked with 'baytes that fortune fling
And fed with the empty husks of things:
Shadows, not friends we entertain;
We Are pleased with the deceitful train
Of words, and think them deeds. But when
The unconstant wheel shall turn again
To the parting Goddess, we shall see
Those friends the selfsame words deny.
Things Humane under false names please.
Our gifts match not our promises;
Religion, less to be does use,
Then the large language of our vows.
Out of Solomon's sacred Marriage Song. Ode 19. Lib. 2.
THou shunnest me, like to a fearful Roe,
Which, as the stormy North-winds blow,
Or the rough noise of the sudden Eastern blast,
Is snatched away with forcelesse have.
For the early frost the trembling leaves does fright,
Or else the Father of the light
Has hewne from the ecchoing rocks his thundering darts,
He hastens with such doubtful starts.
But till I find thee, IN le not cease, nor rest,
But cry aloud, Return, o Christ:
And when with swifter speed thou fly'st away,
Return again, o Christ, IN le say.
The tops of Lebanus, so green and gay,
The fair tilths of Beshulia,
Encompasse thee, old Salem's fruitful Land,
Or else Capharnia low does stand.
At length give over thy sad and careful flight:
Thou shall not escape me, the evening bright
With its so watchful Centry, thee'l betray,
And the Moon with golden horns does stray.
By the groans of the neglected shores IN le find
Thee; and by the sighs of the Western wind;
Thee the night's watch, the stars that walk about
With lively signs will point thee out.
Dirae in Herodem. Ode 24. Lib. 2.
THou Cursed offspring of that sacred place!
Thou fatal monster of prodigious race!
A Libyan Lioness in some Afric den
Gave nourishment to thee, thou shame of men,
Or mungrill Libard with a shee-Tiger, hurled-
Thee, with a mischief, into the hateful world,
Heir to the fury of thy Sire, and damm;
Or some wild Wolf left thee a naked shame:
Under a huge hard rock: some angry storm,
From waves, with things so full of diverse form,
For birds and beasts, spewed the up a banefull prey;
The Marble quarry, 'mid'st the raging Sea,
It Is rigid veins, from thy rough bosom drew;
Marble, from those rocks hewne, Deucalion threw
Over Gaetulian fields: Megaera first
Fixed the in thy regal seat, on thee accursed
Then Tisiphon the Scepter did bestow,
And set the Diadem on thy savage brow.
And as thy princely Ivory, of late
Thou proudly lean'dst upon, close by thee sat
With stately columns prop'd, fell tyranny,
Her Ensigns, who through Palestine let fly:
And her black sword with bloody trembling hand
Did brandish round, when straight at her command
Hatreds, and strifes appeared, murder and rage
The horrid ruin of the newborn age,
She drew along; Tumultuous madness, all
The slaughtered peoples unjust funeral:
Each famous kingdom, inexhausted town
In a large stream of blood by her o're-throwne.
Next followed Her, the plaints, and direful groans
Of sighing parents, robbed of their little ones,
Whole tides of tears, sobs, and lamentings great
And mourning in each corner of the street.
But if this shower, from this sad cause begun,
In too too narrow rivulets does run;
Why do revenging storms so much delay
To back the rain? what does their fury stay?
Why does the shaken sky with rustling noise.
Of the Sun's chariot, bridle in the voice
Of the slow thunder? why the lightning stop
From breaking through the clouds with hideous clap?
Those ayrie feathered arrows in the dark
That stray, why do they spare their cursed mark?
Acroceraunia with his three-fork'd flame,
And that huge Hill the Thracian Queen gave name,
Aemathia's craggy trembling rocks may pass
Guiltless; they have not sinned at all, alas!
Unless their Marble, with a prodigious birth,
This direful Monster teemed, t'infest the earth:
Break then the mountains, break ye lightnings,
Throw headlong down ye fruitful rocks of Kings.
May he exspire! oh may the murth' rer fall!
Most execrable, cruel, tragical!
Upon his kingdom's pile, and flaming yew
Let his high carcass blaze; the air anew
May the monster purge from his infectious breath,
The mock of wrangling furyes, and of death.
Oh break your entrayles, sluggish earth, and down
Let the high ruins of the rocks be thrown;
Against which the waves of the raging Sea may rore
And Nerens with his Quicksands Boiling over:
Wee're heard. The climbing surges strike the stars
And the big Ocean all her strength prepares;
Her foame, and slimy mud sh'hath heaped together
Devouring waves tossed with the worst of weather:
The firmament does shake, and Hell so near
Through the earths large chinks, which gapeth does appear:
The shatt'red world now falls on's impious head,
Go, Tyrant with thy death unpardoned,
Even Hell it self pollute, possess, alone,
Cocytus, and sulphurous Acheron.
Out of Solomon's sacred Marriage Song. Cant. 2.
Stay me with flagons, etc.
I charge O ye daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor wake, etc.
Behold he comes leaping upon the Mountains etc.
ODE 25. LIB. 2.
STay me with saffron, underneath me set
Full banks of Roses, beds of violet;
Refresh me with the choicest fruit, and spread
The whitest Lillies round about my head:
For the delay of the scene-pow're divine
In sacred flames, consumes this breast of mine,
Ye Daughters of that holy City, ye!
Ye Sisters! I, it is I, that humbly pray!
O, I, entreat you, by each Hind, and Roe,
That straying over the tops of Hills do go,
Ye stock of ancient Isaac, ye that move
With nimble foot through Lebanus sweet grove,
Over Carmels fragrant top! ye Nymphs so fair
The glory of the noble Hills that are,
Molest not my beloved with your cries,
Amongst the twining Violets that lies:
Do not with claps of hands, or noise of feet,
Awake her, from her careful slumbers yet:
Until my Spouse, of her own self, shall rise
And wipe away the soft sleep, from her eyes;
Until the golden day star shall release
All things from silent rest, and gentle peace.
Behold from tops of yonder hills does come
The blessed offspring of's fair mothers womb,
The only issue of's bright father too,
On the thick tops of the groves does leaping go,
The unshorne head of Lebanus so hye
He leaps, and the great backs of Mountains by,
The stately dwellings of the woods he skips,
And down again with nimble foot he trips:
Like to a frighted, and swift running Roe,
Beholding Lions in a vale below,
With an amazed haste, and deep fetched breath
Through uncouth places runs t'escape his death.
To Egnatius Nollius. That we ought to be of an even and upright mind, against
the inconstancy of fortune. Ode 4. Lib. 3.
ARt thou blow'n on, with gentle gale,
Or in rough waters forced to sail?
Still conquer Fortune, make but sports
Of her, and her uncertain Arts.
Laughs she? turn bravely away thy face.
Weeps she? bring't back, with smiling grace:
When she is most busy, be thou than
Retired, and always thine own man.
Thus close shut up, thine own free state
Thou best may rule, chief Magistrate;
When the fierce Fates shall most molest,
The serene palace of thy breast.
When light mischance, thy fort, or thee
Shall visit; meet it merrily:
Good luck, and peace, in that house stay
Where mourning, first, has led the way.
In dext'rous chance, this hurt we see,
It makes us soft: Extremity-
This, prosperous has, wheresoever it hits,
It hardens, and for danger fits.
The grief that has been of such length,
Doth' bate its violence and strength.
By bearing much, make fortune free;
She learnes, by custom, light to be.
To Marcus Silicernius. That those are the true riches which are fetched from
the goods of the mind. Ode 6. lib. 3.
A Rash believer of their ticklish play,
With Fates, I never joined greedy hands in have,
From the strict course of private jarres, that they
With me, in such an equal peace should rest.
I know not what to morrow's fortune brings
Heir to my self alone. The wealth she gave
Lies in my outmost rooms, amongst worst of things;
Which, without force, she may for taking have.
Things can be taken away, I never thought mine;
Not poorer I, if mine own self complete.
I kingdom, Marcus, of my self I find
If the great custom of mine own estate-
Within me I could in just numbers cast.
A great part of my mind lies close, more wide
Then the rich Indyes are, to which at most
But thrice a year, we can but sail or ride
But my rich mind, often to it self a guest,
By its own self is daily visited;
Not 'bout to buy Toys for a room, or feast,
If of its self it is seen, it is richly fed.
To Aurelius Fuscus. That all humane things are frail and uncertain. Ode 12.
Lib. 3.
IF the first bark, Fuscus, thou would but pare
From empty things, the rest will flow,
And vanish quite like vernall snow;
Which melts away, with the mild breath of the air.
Valor from beauty severed, slowly moves.
Mere outsides please: had Paris seen
Fair Helens heart, how foule't had been,
How ill requiting to the Trojan Loves,
Never, through the midst of Nereus broils, had he
Or the winds anger, borne away
OF the Grecian bed that beauteous prey.
But Nature's Lord, the mutual yoke, we see,
Of things has ord'red well, that black with white,
Sad things with joyful cov'red lie.
And from this various mixture, he
The best would choose, from Heaven must learn the right,
To Caesar Pausilipius. The kingdom of a wise man. Ode 3. Lib. 4.
THe large-commanding Thracians we
Have feared. More large command has he,
Who all alone himself retyres,
And keeps sure guard over his desires.
Thy unwarlike breast, with shield of proof
Forbear to fortify; throw off
From thy unpractic'd sides the shirt
O Mayle, so hard about thee girt.
Let not the Quiver and the bow
Such homage to thy soft neck do.
Whether't be Dane, or Pict, taken out
From farthest Britain, hems the about
Or Goth, never labor much to know
Thine own Commander, Champion too.
We are it is true a kingdom small;
But, Pansilipius, he that shall
His flattering self, to himself subdue,
A business great does undergo;
If his own laws he can persuade,
And does perform them being made.
An host, makes no Kings title good,
Nor Robes deep died in peoples blood,
A high brow set with stars of gold,
Or Jems more glorious to behold.
He who has tamed all coward fears,
And his own Guard himself prepares,
Who practiced, in fair combat, first
Dares Chance and Fortune do their worst;
That man's a King. He does not feign
His looks to the votes of the vulgar strain,
The popular stage, and public shows
Never moves him, nor the air that blows
With swift applause; He Is blessed whose sprite,
Fall Fortune sad, or fall she light,
Has never expressed, to the standers by,
A low complaint, or haughty cry;
But, lest the curious Fates displease-
He should, holds modestly his peace.
At's first wounds, who nor groans, nor quakes,
A Conquest with his silence makes:
He that mischance knows how to hide,
The worst of ills, can best abide.
He, though the Sea should every where
Hang up its waves in the flitting air;
And the rough winds on him, should press
Flames mixed with billows, nay whole Seas,
From the high Court of's lofty mind
IN the midst of the ruin, sport can find;
Sets to his neck to the falling sky,
And props the world most valiantly:
To the now gasping Age safe heir,
Leans on the Earth' s sad sepulcher,
Whence, 'midst the fragments of the sky,
He sees most clearly from on hye,
How much more great those things appear,
He treads on, then indeed they are,
Being then prepared, and ready dressed
To dye Olympus certain guest.
Where, when by the Fates he is gladly brought,
Whether disease, it matter's not,
Or enemies sword, does thrust him on,
When his last journey he must run.
To the Port we are but once brought in
To which we have always sailing bin:
Whether, as mighty-Princes, we
In gallant ships have spread the Sea;
Or, as the common sort of men,
In smaller Barks, have carried been.
May my poor bottom to that brinke
Me happy bring; why should I shrink-
Safe on the Aeternall shore to stand,
If with such trash I can shake hand?
To Q. Dellius. That our life ought not to be instituted so much by popular
example, as by the guiding of reason. Ode 10. Lib. 4.
WE err (my Dellius) if we take
That baser path of life, the people make;
In highest and remotest Hills
Virtue sequesters up her self, and dwells.
There where the way more beaten lies,
Less certain, and more slippery always it is.
From fruitless order, errors grow;
Custom, not reason, draws the people now.
Men live by Chance, our time we spend
IN the way, like Truants, and forget the end,
Where 'mid'st the throng of passers by,
The noise of the mad rout, the hateful cry
Of envy, calls, wee're drawn amain
B' example; others we draw back again;
No man is ill to himself alone,
Nor no man's life is only called his own:
Whilst that the rambling rout treads over
With after steps, the heels of them before,
They that go foremost are designed
A mischief often to those that come behind.
Pernassus, and chaste Helicon
Sublimes and takes me from the vulgar throng:
From whence, the false mistakes I view
And wandering minds of the too slothful crew;
And from on hye I fearelesse see,
With sport, the dangers that below me lie;
Thus warily with joy I live,
And by, other men's mischances I can thrive,
To Sigismundus Laetus. He Commends the despising of vainglory, and silence.
Od. 11. Lib. 4.
Why fleeting glory follow we,
Laetus, with weapons all in vain?
When like a Moore, or Parthian, she
Flies at her back with wounded Train.
The Talking-peoples love, denies
Under one roof a guest to fix:
With' s empty ear, one takes up lies,
And them with truths, does sub 'ly mix,
Another sticks, and thinks to build
His nest: but when he plainly sees
His empty breast with noise beguild,
Aloft with silent wings, he flees.
True praise would not be known; the Sun
Forbids from being seen below
By his own light: and he that can
Eclipse himself, does brighter show.
He that in silence, of his mind
The sacred Treasury contains;
Safety in the vulgar noise does find:
In's doubtful Court, and wisely reigns.
Still banks thy Pinnace well may pass,
But when with hoarse rocks they do roar,
Remember wisely to forecast
And turn 't aside with wary Oar.
To Ianus Libinius. He excuses his retyrednesse. Ode 12. Lib. 4.
What it is detaines me here, and why-
I hide my self from every eye,
How in so poor a house I spend
My hours, y' have often asked me, friend;
When the free Courts of freeborn men,
Fall out, which first shall let me in.
I enjoy my self, what need I more?
Of every sense I lock the door;
And close shut up, a task I find
In the retyring house of the mind:
The Theater of my life I view
My own spectator and judge too-
Whether the tale I first begun
In well digested Acts IN ue spun;
In every scene, if every clause
Goes neatly off, with heavens applause:
Each Action scanned, is there set free
Or sentenced by authority-
If there, with well Done I escape,
IN me blessed without the peoples clap.
I hate the common road of praise,
Or what the gaping vulgar raise,
Which with a pleasant gale awhile
Fame hurries, but does soon beguile:
Now Envie's sting it feels, ere long
The Artillery of some spightfull tongue:
Thus chased, with weak'ned wings it dies;
Or torn, on the bare ground it lies.
A private fame, a mean house, where
I live concealed from popular air,
Best fits my mind, and shelters me:
Virtue to her own praise deaf should be.
Our emulation, things a far off command,
But Envy haunts things that are near at hand.
To Caesar Pausilippius. That adversity is to be endured with a constant mind.
Ode 13. l. 4.
IF mournful eyes could but prevent
The evils they so much lament
Sidonian Pearls, or Gems more rare,
Would be too cheap for every tear.
But moyst'ned woes grow fresh, and new,
As Corn besprinkled with the dew.
Tear follows tear, and fruitful grief
Has from it self, its own relief.
The man whom Fortune does espy
With drooping spirit, and moyst'ned eye,
She, often strikes; ill Fate, amain
Runs Scarr'd no notice being taken.
Bewail not then thy self, dear friend,
Or evils that on thee attend;
What they expel, tears cherish often;
Hard things deny to yield to soft.
Mischance is conquered, when she spies
A valiant patience with dry eyes.
To Crispus Laevinius. Being asked why he sung so often as he travailed, he
answers. Ode 44. Lib. 4.
AS cheerfully I walk with thee,
My shoulders from all burdens free,
Our native soil again to see
Rich to my self I sing,
Whilst care strikes thee, and thy Muse dumb,
The heavy weight of thy vast sum,
Or what estate in time to come
The faithless rout may bring.
He Is rich that nothing has; He that
In's certain hand holds his estate,
That makes himself his constant mate
Where need commands him go;
What can I want, that naught desire?
Then Pindus vale, I reach no higher:
O sacred Grove! O pleasant quire
In those cool shades below!
What paths soever my steps invite
Ye Delphian hills, my sole delight
Do go with me; in weary plight,
And veyle me with good grace.
Let the Goth his strongest chains prepare,
The Scythian hence me captive tear,
My mind being free with you, IN le stare
The Tyrants in the face.
To Munatius. That nothing in humane affairs is not full of tediousness. Ode
15. l. 4.
NOthing Munatius, nothing I sing't again,
That Is mortal, nothing from the uncured pain
Of tediousness is free. The Sun
Which bright to our forefathers shone
To us, but little healthful, does appear,
And though not guilty of one spott, not clear:
Whatsoever immortal thing we see
In high Olympus, silly we
Do over-cast with Envy's shade; here one
From his own native Hills the rising Sun
Disclaimes; or the ancient Moon, that strikes
Her beams through's fathers glass, dislikes.
Each year we change our air, and soil, so light;
Him, Hollands warmer Climate does invite:
Another differs, and does cry
Ausonia's clearer Suns please me.
In vain all this, if faithful sicknesses
Wait close behind; if secret griefs never cease,
All Is one, whether in Chariot
Thou go, or in Venetian boat.
Poor exiles! then, things left do please us most,
Who a sure building can from virtue boast,
To him the smoke of's father's Hall
Does never hurt his eyes at all.
Virtue oft-times, rich in a rustic ease
Confines her self to her own private bliss;
And in the guiltless straw, her throne
With great delight can lean upon.
Out of Solomon 's sacred Marriage Song. CHAP. 1. 7. Tell me (o thou whom my
soul loves) where thou feedest, where thou make thy flocks to rest at
noone, etc. (...). Od. 19. Lib. 4.
THou said, farewell my Spouse, and went away
More fleet then Clouds with liquid paces stray:
Oh what a longing, Jesu thus
With thy delay thou make in us?
It Is now high noone, the scorching Sun does burn
IN ch' midst of the pole, the mower spares the corn,
The Shepherd, with his flocks, is glad-
And painted birds, to seek cool shade.
But Jesu! where at thou? what region's blessed
By holding thee so long in silent rest?
What darksome shade denies my love?
Or with thick boughs what shady Grove?
Knew I on what green Turfe thou do repose
Thy fainting limbs; what wind with soft breath blowes'
What stream, with bubling, passing by
Disturbs thy sleep, or wakens thee;
Oh! lest the too much noise should raise thee, I
Would let fall streams of tears should qualify;
My warmer sighs thou mixed should find
With the cold blasts of the Eastern wind.
Out of Solomon 's sacred marriage song. My beloved spoke and said unto me,
rise up my love, my Dove, my fair one, and come away; for lo the winter is
past, the rain is over and gone: the flowers appear on the earth, the time of
singing of birds is come, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land. The
figtree puts forth, etc. Ode 21. Lib. 4.
Do I mistake? or from Elyzium clear
My life's call do I hear?
Sister arise, and harness thy sweet pair
Of Doves, thy self more fair;
Mount and drive hither, here let thy Chariot stop,
From Libanus hye top;
At thy approach the falling showers do fly,
Tempestuous storms pass by,
The lightning's quenched under thy harmless feet,
Winter turns Spring to see it.
While in the sacred Green, a bow're we see
Does spread it self for thee.
The Earth new Turff's it self for thee to tread,
The straying stars fresh fields make glad.
Here with their dams, of Kids the amazed flocks
Hang on steep sides of Rocks;
Here as they swim, the wanton Hinds do play
In the cool streams all day.
The Lion with the Libard down is l'ed
Tame and well governed;
Each with his Lamb about the Mountains skip,
Over Hills they lightly trip.
By these a spacious brook does slowly glide,
Which with a spreading tide
Through bending Lilyes, banks of Violets
From the hollow Pumice sweats.
The rivers gently flow, and a still sound
From mossie Rocks does bound.
The sporting fish dance in the crystal Main,
The Birds sweetly complain,
The air, if doleful comforts please, does ring
with mournful murmuring.
For when the Doves echo each others cry
That sound does hither fly.
As they with widowed notes themselves do please,
Just so, our joys increase.
No want appears; the officious Vine does stand
With bending clusters to our hand.
Here, thou shall pick sweet Violets, and there
Fresh Lillyes all the year:
The Apple ripe drops from its stalk to thee,
From taste of death made free.
The luscious fruit from the full Figtree shall
Into thy bosom fall.
Mean while, the Vine no pruning knife does know,
The wounded earth no plow.
The Corn grows green alone, and the unhurt land
Does white with harvest stand.
The grass affords a stately bed, the Plane
Spreads thee to entertain.
Arabian mists sweat from the gummy tree
Os Balm, and all for thee;
Which through the air, a rich perfume do throw,
Fanned with each neighboring bough.
Arise my Sister dear, why do thou stay,
And spend the unwilling day?
Behold thy harnessed Doves, at thy delay
Do sigh, come, drive away.
Put on, and hither drive thy beauteous pair
Of Doves, thy self more fair.
To Ianusius Skuminus. When he performed the Funeral obsequies of his most
dear Wife. (...). Ode 30. Lib. 4.
WHat though the Gods have promised she shall be
Enfranchised to Eternity?
Yet (valiant Sir) so great a loss still cries
For a just tribute from your eyes;
View but her pious mind, that tow're of state
Not shaken by sad storms of Fate,
Her humble innocent soul, her guiltless fear,
Her modesty chief Regent there;
The prudent thrift of her presaging mind
Her constant zeal, pure and refined;
And who can then forbear t'embalme her Heaerse
With the daily precious dew os tears?
It Is not in Fate to promise length of days,
To things of such esteem and praise;
Nor can the stars suffer so ripe a birth
To be long sullied with dull earth.
Load not the Heavens then with unjust complaints,
For taking back one of their Saints.
The courage of her richly temp'red breast
Made her for them a fitter guest:
Such jewels of her mind sparkle about her
The stars themselves cannot shine without her.
Thus Tanaquil; thus Claudia's virgin band
Steered the unwilling Bark to land.
Thus she, that durst her Husbands fate abide,
And Cloelia over Tiber's tide;
Too early crop'd, survive in Poesy,
And keep perpetual jubilie.
It Is not in Art to fetch her back again,
Or charm the spirits with Orpheus strain,
To break the bars of Adamant, or scale
The Rampires of the Elysian wall,
No Orisons prevail, sent from the breast
Of great Apollo's choicest Priest.
Yet in the arched entrance, chinks there be,
Which may befriend the covetous eye;
Through these to the hidden mysteries I peep,
And (if the spirits nor dream, nor sleep)
I saw, or else me thoughts, I there had seen
Her, wandering over a spacious Green,
With walls of Diamond, gates of purest glass,
No Crystal more transparent was:
Each blade of grass was gold, each tree was there,
A golden Periwig did wear.
The swelling banks of Violets did curle
Themselves with Gems, and Orient Pearl;
The glorious nothing, of the Trigon glass-
And all Apelles Art, which pass.
Through the sweet vales a Quire of Damsels sing
Eternal Paeans to their King.
The stars with sparkling light stand round I see,
Twinkling to their shrill melody.
Her and her tender darling, then I spy.
IN the midst of that blessed company;
With looks more fresh and sweet, then are the Roses
Of which her Garlands she composes --
Two flowery Chaplets, which with Gems set round
Her own and Nepew's temples crowned.
But here a veyle was drawn, I must not pry
Nor search too far with mortal eye,
Nor would you more. It may suffice that she
Has changed frail flesh for blessed Eternity.
To Albertus Turscius. Of his Dreams, and Lyricks. Ode 32. Lib. 4.
Whether a shorter sleep, or whether
A long one (Turscins) joins mine eyes together
In my soft dreams, me thinks, I see
To my light shoulders wings set on, and I
With joy transported, upward soar,
The flowery Meddowes, and the pastures over;
Where the green Grove its cool shade yields
To the stately grasse-plotts, and ripe swelling fields:
Straight, 'mid'st the river Swans, up hyer
A winged foul above the clouds IN aspire;
The lively Lakes below, I slight,
And with sweet strains a bird I counterfeit.
See, now me thinks, the clouds in throngs
The lightning leaps too, at my ravishing songs;
Iris about my neck hangs round,
And with her diverse colored bow, IN me bound.
Being now my self, and newly waked,
My not unwelcome dreams, just now off shak'd;
Thrice over my Lute, I scarce had run
With nible finger neat division;
Remembering Horace, Thee, my guide,
When my high Genius through the air does ride;
Now over the scatt'red Islands, then
Over Seas, with dry feet passing back again;
Nothing that is mortal of me, now
I bear, and naught to my dull bulk I owe.
Yet Turscius thou have often told,
And warned me, lest then Icarus of old
By a true fall indeed, I make
A louder tale, and change the name of the Lake.
In vain: Remembering Him, I had
A care, and counsel, to my folly, add:
For when I sleep, in bed I lie,
And if I write, my secure chair holds me.
To Quintus Tiberinus. Ode 34. Lib. 4.
THou shall not Tiberinus, call
Him rich, whose every Acre shall
Outvie the Eastern glebe, whose field
Fair Fortune's clearest stream does gild.
Nor him, whose birth, and pedigree
Is famed abroad by's Heraldrie;
He who by fleeting glory's hurld
In his rich Chariot through the world.
He Is poor that wants himself, yet weighs
Proudly himself; in this scale lays
His lands, in the other broad one, by,
The false weight of his gold does lie,
Great to himself, to others small,
That never knows himself at all,
As the false people raise him higher,
Himself in's shadow he will admire.
The fairest Gemme without true light,
Without true praise great titles, slight:
Blessed Tiberinus, and most free
In thy self alone thou wilt learn to be.
To Paulus Coslovius. Ode 35. Lib. 4.
THe Western winds, with the warm breath of the Spring,
Return, and over our fields their soft gales fling:
The flowry-garnish'd Meadows by,
With freshest colors painted lie.
The River, which the gainful ships so throng,
With welcome silence gently glides along,
Although the neighboring Hill does ring
With the shrill notes of birds that sing;
Although the Swain 'on the green bank that fits
Old Sonnets with his Oaten Pipe repeats,
Although the Seaman does not fail
At length to strike his full blown sail.
To thy Palladian labors interpose
Such changes Paullus; when the Sun forth shows
And with his golden presence smiles
On the hye tops of highest Hills,
We Will mount the back of green Luciscus, where
He Is thickest set with tallest Oaks, and hear
The bubbling noise of streams that flow
From Fountains that close by him go.
Thence from the midst of the hill all Vilna shall
Our prospect be; our eye shall lower fall-
On Vilia's cooler streams, that wind,
And with embraces Vilna bind.
From thence, far off, the Temples we will behold,
And radiant Scutcheons all adorned with gold;
Then we will look over that double tower,
The extent of great Palaemon's pow're.
How in a settled peace, and kingdoms rest
The easy people rise themselves, so blessed!
Three Temples in three years we have seen
To the Citizens have reared been;
Where Gediminian Rocks themselves extol
With their plain tops, and then the Capitol,
Those buildings, whose proud turrets stretch
Themselves to the Clouds, and stars do reach:
Great things to greater growth do thus increase,
And with least pains, improve themselves by peace.
Here, tops of Hills, themselves behold,
In all their flowery pride unfold.
The Poplar now that shakes, when the East winds blow,
Stood cloth' d in gray, under the lingering snow:
The Springs that now so nimbly rise,
Were all of late locked up, in Ice.
The fields that now with blushing Roses spread,
Lay barren, and in hardest frost all hid:
The birds which chirping sit in the Spring;
When Winter comes, forget to sing.
Break off delays then, and from grievous care
A constant day, set by; which the evening fair
Does promise, and the next days Sun
With his white Steeds will freely run.
To Paulus Iordanus Vrsinus, Duke of Bracciano. He commends the pleasantness
of the Country, where, in the feasts of September, he retired from Rome. Ode
1. Lib. Epod.
Appear ye spritefull Quire with choicest sports,
All pastime fit for Phoebus Courts;
And Thou great Master of the Revels, join
The Graces, to thy Daughters nine;
Wit pure and quaint, with rich conceits and free
From all obscaene scurrilitie:
Here free from care, nimbly let us dance a round
Upon Bracciano's softer ground.
A gentle Cliffe from a steep Hill does rise
That even to Heaven, mounts by degrees,
And safe, with uncouth passage, leanes upon
The solid backs, of Rocks and stone:
Whence 'mid'st the Bulwark'd Forts, we may descry
A displayed Banner from on hye,
Which to the Imperial force a terror was,
A terror to great Borgias,
When through the brazen troops of's threatening foes,
His fearful thunderbolts he throws,
Pursuing routed Caesar, whom he brought
To that he promised him, to naught.
Great Ursin here puts reins to the Tuscan pow're
The grace of Heroes and the flow're;
Heir to his father's worth, chief guide and stay
And praise of great Oenotria.
A Bow're grows green, set round with trembling Oaks
Which fanns the Heavens with gentle strokes.
It clothes the Hills, and spreads it self all over
To the open Theaters a cover.
Close joined to the walls, the Nymphs cool Arbor stands,
Which to the Sunny shore commands;
By these a bank of Vines, which the neighbor Trench
With milder waves does daily drench.
Nowhere the Lakes with fuller Sea does roar,
Either of Larius that boyles over,
Or rough Albanus whose troubled waves do mix
With the unnavigable Styx:
Not stormy Julia, when her swelling pride
Most rages in her highest tide,
Benacus does not raise more froth, when he
Assaults the rocks with fiercest Sea.
With rugged tops the bending mountains round
Upon the slow calm streams look down.
Romanus here his snowy back up-reares,
And draws down envy from the stars:
The lofty head of Cyminus here shakes
The Oak with trembling leaves which quakes,
And holds off Boreas, when his rawer blasts
Against the weak Southern winds he casts,
Commands the Country far, and out he sets
His Winter sides against Heavens threats.
Mean while a pleasant calm does smooth the Lake,
The waves against one another break,
Mild Thetis self, with her own self finds sport,
And waters do the waters court:
Through which a ship does cut, with pleasant gales,
Or nimble Bark with swelling sails:
The large-fin'd Crystal cattle as they go
Are forced whether they will or no
With ready dragnet; then with lines of hair
They round the Lake, or Nets more rare.
Rich Polla's stately house there shines, and here
Full stored Fish Ponds do appear:
The friendly Foords which toward the Sea do lie
Water Trebonian Vineyards by:
Here neat Aurelius farm looks gay, chief Lord
And Master of that healthful Foord,
Whose water cures diseases, whose quick springs
Do purge out all infectious things.
Where Flora makes the banks, and gives the name
To Fountains, proud of so much fame;
From lively stones perpetual waters flow,
And wash the fields wheresoever they go,
Their father Tyber, and their King they sound
And flow to Rome, with homage bound.
Nature does purely there advance each part,
Not any place is helped by Art:
As yet the virgin furrow, the Hills yet stand
Untouched, by any tender hand.
Chaste Tethys, Bacchus courts, Thetis does woo
Bacchus again, and Ceres too.
Hence Evius cheerful rises, and does twine
With the Elm, that closely clings toth' Vine,
With' s plenteous horn he swells, his locks hang by-
With flowing Clusters tangled lie.
Not Lesbos him, nor the sweet smelling grace,
Of rich Campania's fruitful race
Delights; the purple Grape not so fair shows,
In the Falernian sun that grows.
He Will not prefer Faliscus sandy ground,
Nor Rhaetia, that does so abound;
The yellow Tilths of happy Cyprus, he
Never loved so much, nor Rhodos by:
As in his own -- in his own channells he
Hugging himself, does proudly lie.
Sole Empress Ceres of the fertile lands
Whose large possessions she commands:
The fields with yellow waves do ebb and flow,
The ripe ears swim, when winds do blow.
No vapor, here, Heavens cleared face does stain,
No clowdy fleece stretched out with rain:
The Northern blasts are still, and all at peace,
And the hoarse noise of the woods does cease:
The stubborn Afric winds that use to stray
About the unruly sandy Sea,
Are all hushed up, and no Alarm sound
To the other winds, entrenched round;
Only the Evening fair, a gentle gale
Of winds that each year never fail:
The bright Sun darting through the enlightened Air
His beams, does guild the Moutaines clear,
The hours drive on heavens torch, that shine so bright,
And Phoebus father of the light-
With a peculiar influence bedewes
The Hills all over, when night ensues.
The warm Favonian winds with whistling gale,
Do merrily the boughs assail,
And with their temperate breath, and gentle noise,
Sweet pleasing slumbers softly raise.
The prattling Nests mean while no silence keep,
Their wandering guests never sleep.
To's mate, the Turtle amongst the branches groans,
And with complaints breaks hardest stones,
The Nightingale, the pleasant Groves about
Refreshes, with her warbling note,
Bewayles her loss to the woods, in the cruel fields
Against Tereus her cries she yields:
And what the mournful birds do so complain,
The shrill woods answer back again.
The Oak, the Alder tells; the Poplar tree
The Ash; and that, the Elm stands by.
The Groves rejoice with the Echo they afford
And tell them back -- even word for word.
Jordanus here, hither thy self command,
Great Ruler of the Oenotrian land.
Withdraw thy self from cares, from all resort
So cloyed with' City, and with Court,
So full of great affairs, at length thy breast
Convey to thy domestic rest.
Here thou may pass thy Foord, in gloomy shade,
On each side, by thine own trees made,
And here between thy Mounts, with tall Oaks set,
A large walk thou shall get:
Or in December, when the fields look white,
And the Hills, with the' earlyest snow does light;
Sometime the entangled game, with twining nett
IN the wood, with fear thou shall besett:
Sometimes with courser fleet, pursue full sore,
The Buck thou may, sometimes the Bore;
With thy thrown dart the red Deer thou shall stick.
And the frighted ravenous Wolves shall strick,
And if that Star of the sacred dignity
The glory of all Italy,
Will also from his cares, himself make free,
And keep his Festivals with thee;
Each Citizen of thine, and every guest
With the compleatest joy is blessed.
To the Fountain Sona, When he returned. Ode 2. Lib. Epod.
O Fount more clear then spotless glass,
More pure, then purest snow e're was,
The Nymphs desire, and Countries grace,
Thou joy of this my Native place.
Tired with a tedious journey, I,
And pressed with cares that grievous lie,
From the far Tuscan Land made free
Thus low I bow my self to thee:
Oh, if thou can, vouchsafe to be
Pressed, and with hollow palm drawn dry!
So let thy peace no wandering beast
Disturb, no broken bough, thy rest:
So when thou cutt'st with prattling noise
The Meads, and leap'st, men hear thy voice;
May the whistling leaves of Poplar trees
With their unwelcome murmurs cease-
To thee, and thy Priests Lute: if naught
Urban approves, in vain is thought
TO Blandusia thou can nothing owe;
Nor to mild flowing Sirmio.
A Palinode To the second Ode of the book of Epodes of Q. H. Flaccus. The
praise of a Religious Recreation. Ode 3. Lib. Epod.
BUt, Flaccus, now more happy he appears,
Who, with the burden of his cares,
Far off has left his father's ground, set free
From the fierce wrangling Lawyer's fee;
No scorching heat, nor blasts of Winter Jove,
Does hurt his fruit, or him can move;
He shuns all strifes, and never does resort
The sinful gates of the greedy Court.
But either does bewail those days and nights,
Lost by him in profane delights;
Or else retired, strives to collect and find
The dispersed flock of's wandering mind;
Having first fairly poised the recompense
And gains of a good conscience.
At evening, when the harbinger of night
The torches of the sky does light,
How he admires the immortal rays break forth,
And their bright Orbs, more large then earth;
How through his trickling tears, he helps his sight,
Unto the open Courts of light,
Which with thy self, o Christ, thy self in prayer
He' Adores, to Eternal life an heir!
The Stars with golden wheels, are hurried by,
And let their prostrate exile lie,
Over whose face, the plenteous tears do stray,
Which chase all drowsy sleep away;
As Soon as Phoebus head begins t'appeare,
Lately in Indus streams made clear,
From depth of soul, less then himself he lies,
And bends the angry powers with cries:
Or when the Sun shines clear, the air serene,
And April Festivals begin,
His eyes, so used to Heaven, he down does throw,
On a large prospect here below:
He viewes the fields, and wondering stands to see
In's shade the shining Deity.
See how (says he) each herb with restless leaves
To the stars does strive and upward heaves:
Removed from heaven they weep, the field appears
All over dissolved in pious tears:
The white-flowr'd Woodbine, and the blushing Rose
Branch into the air with twining boughs;
The pale-faced Lilly on the bending stalk,
To the stars I know not what does talk;
At night with fawning sighs they'expresse their fears
And in the morning drop down tears.
Am I alone, wretch that I am, fast bound
And held with heavy weight, to the ground?
Thus spoke he to the neigbouring trees, thus he
To the Fountains talked, and streams ran by,
And after, seeks the great Creator out
By these fair traces of his foot.
But if a lightsome Country house that is free
From care, such as Luciscu's be,
Or Nemicini' s, if Besdan's fruitful field
Can Grace to his rude table yield,
To his plain board with country dainties set,
In August's dry and parching heat;
Even at his door, under a private shade
By a thick pleasant Poplar made,
Provision of all sorts, expect their guest,
A shell with salt, pure and the best,
New bread, for which, 'midst the thin briars, the Maid
Picks Strawberries, and's gladly paid.
Cheese newly pressed, close by, the friendly Cann
With Cup clean washed, does ready stan'^
With me the Lucrine dainties will not down,
The Scare, nor Mullet that is well grown;
But the Ring-dove plump, the Turtle dun does look,
Or Swan, the sojourner of the brook,
A mess of Beans which shuns the curious pallet,
The cheerful and not simple sallet;
Clusters of grapes last gathered, that miss
And nothing owe to the weighty press.
Then after noone he takes a kind of pride
To the Hills to walk, or River side,
And 'midst the pleasant Oaks, a shade does find,
T'avoyd the blasts of the Southern wind;
To the darksome shore, by the deep poole he goes,
And through, with nimble Boat he rows;
Sometimes the sporting fish, his bait thrown in,
He plucks up with his trembling line.
Mean while the spacious woods with ecchoing note
Do answer to the Bulls wide throat,
The shady rivers bleat; the Nightingale
IN the bushes chirps her doleful tale.
With' s hastening pipe the sheapheard drives away
His flock, which through the thickets stray:
To which as from the field they pass along,
Each mower sings by course, his song;
Over yiedling furrows, carts full pressed with corn
Groan, and are like to break the barn.
Our work once done, we do not silent sit,
When knots of our good fellows meet;
Nor is our talk prolonged with rude delay;
In harmless jests we spend the day;
Jests dipped in so much salt, which rubbing shall
Only make fresh our cheeks, not gall.
If that rich churl, this had but seen, when he
A Country man began to be,
The money which in the Ides he scraped in
Next month he would not put out again.
Epig. 4. Let my beloved come into his Garden. Cant. 5.
LOve takes the tools of a rude Country clown,
His own Artill'ry, and his torch lays down;
With staff in's hand, Oxen to the Plow he set
For tillage, and such honest labor fit;
Straight, as he turned up hearts with easy share,
And grace in the virgin-furrowes did appear,
Amongst thousand others, one flower, quoth he, is mist:
That none may wanting be, come thou, O Christ.
Who is thy Beloved? Out of Cant. 5. Lib. Epig. 37.
WHat is that Spouse of thine? that fairest He?
The barbarous people said, of late, to me.
A Pen I took, and in a Tablet drew
Whatsoever, O Christ, in thy blessed orb I view
Roses, and Gold I paint, Gems, Groves, Corne-land,
Green Gardens, Lakes, and Stars with nimble hand;
Would you needs learn, what might my fairest be?
Look over this tablet, pray, O such was He.
Epig. 40.
THou run'st, and running cry'st, why do thou stay
My Spouse? thou would be taken, not get away.
Ep. 48. To -- bearing Lillyes in her hand.
THese Lillyes which on virgin stalks do bend,
From whence do they their chaster leaves extend?
The Paestan beds such flowers did never bring forth,
Nor Pharian fields e're gloried in such worth:
Alcinous purple banks, never teemed with these,
Nor rich Carystos watered by the Seas.
Since then these flow'res no native place do know,
Who can deny from her chaste hand they grow.
Ex. Lib. Ep. 51. To Johan de Lugo, when after a long sickness, he returned to
his intermitted Lecture of Repentance.
WIth hairs unkemb'd Repentance late did mourn,
When with so feirce a Fever thou were torn:
She Is said, to let loose raynes t'untamed grief,
To afford her moyst'ned bosom, no relief,
But when the desks again, thy sickness tamed,
Thou mountd'st, she is said her careless hair to have kemb'd
To Have bridled in her conquered grief, and smile,
Of tears, her opened bosom to beguile.
Who cannot then be glad, thou being safe?
When tears rejoice, and grief it self does laugh.
The voice of Christ upon the Cross. I THIRST.
ALas I thirst, great King, thou loud do groan;
I have no pleasant Wine for Thee, thirst on,
Yet oh I thirst, thou cry'st: a Cup to thee
Woes me! IN le give: but mixed with gall't must be.
Drink this, my Spouse: perhaps thou wilt ask to whom?
To me, O Christ, to the health of the world let't come.
FINIS.
