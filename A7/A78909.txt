His Majesty's Massage to the House of Commons.
From the Court at York the 13 of August 1642.
HIs Majesty, taking notice of an Order lately made by the House of Commons,
whereby that House has unduly assumed to themselves Authority to order,
direct, and dispose of one hundred thousand pounds, part of those moneys which
the Adventurers for the reducing of the Rebels of Ireland have paid to that,
and only to that purpose, to other uses and intents, contrary to the express
words of the Act of Parliament concerning the same; Wherein it is enacted, That
no part of the money, which should be paid in according to that Act, shall be
employed to any other purpose, then the Reducing of those Rebels, until they
shall be declared to be subdued, Out of His Piety and Princely care for the
confirming and reestablishment of Gods true Religion in that His kingdom of
Ireland, for the relief of His distressed Subjects there, for the suppression
of that horrid and bloody Rebellion, for the supply and payment of His Armies
there, now in great want and necessity, does strictly require the House of
Commons, as they will answer the contrary to Almighty God, His Majesty, and
those that have trusted them, That they immediately retract that mischievous,
illegal, and unjust Order; Wherein His Majesty expects their speedy Answer,
and Obedience; And the rather, That he may thereby be secured, That such part
of the four hundred thousand Pounds as is or shall be collected from His good
Subjects of England, by virtue of the late Act of Parliament, whereby the same
is granted, may not likewise (under false pretenses) be diverted from its
proper use, for which it was intended, and mis-imployed to the Disturbance of
the Peace of this Kingdom, in a war against His Sacred Majesty.

Imprinted at York by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
