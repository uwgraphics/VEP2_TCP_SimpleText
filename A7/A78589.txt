A CHARACTER OF AN ANTIMALIGNANT, Or right Parliamentier; Expressing plainly
his opinion concerning King and Parliament.
AN Antimalignant, or right Parliamentier, is one who lays aside all
partiality, and makes reason his Perspective, through which he looks upon King
and Parliament, weighing the ends and actions of both in an equal balance; nor
is he so confident in the success as the cause, knowing that when God
purposes to punish a people for their transgressions, he suffers (many times)
their scourge to prevail, till they be reformed or destroyed. And therefore if
at any time the malignant party gets the better, it begets no doubts in him
whether he be in the right or no, esteeming it not as a blessing upon them, but
a just punishment upon the Nation. Neither is he so great a soother of the
Parliament, as to maintain that all their proceedings are (in some of their
Agents) so exactly justifiable as their curse is undoubtedly good: For being
enforced to trust so many in all places of the Kingdom, with carrying the
bag) it is almost impossible but there must be some Judasses amongst them,
who (with fair and splendid pretenses) obscure their own foul and covetous
ends; some Achans, who busy themselves more in hiding The Babylonish Garment,
the Shekels of silver, and Wedge of gold, then the Reformation either of Church
or Commonwealth, who are yet unfound out, which he conceives (though we humble
our selves before the Lord) to be one main reason that the men of Ai have
prevailed so far (sometimes) against us; for God will accomplish his own
work, his own way: but as He is not refractory to reason, and things probable,
so He will by no means be drawn to the belief of impossibilities and
contradictions, as that Papists, Monopolists, Fugitives from Parliament, Popish
Prelates, corrupt Judges, and other Renegadoes, (who are the chief Fomentors
of this unnatural War, both in their purses and persons, and are all justly
under the lash of the Parliament for their foul abuses, both in Church and
Commonwealth) can by any possible means be likely men to assist his Majesty
in fighting for the true Protestant Religion, the Privilege of Parliament, and
Liberty of the Subject; and therefore cannot but acknowledge that his Majesty
has justly rendered his integrity suspected in the opinion of his people: For
it is to Him a Riddle, (though it be the Common salve for the Kings evil, to
put off all from him, and lay it only upon his evil Council) how any man can
believe that evil Counselors make an evil King (who dare not appear before
him, except they first find him fit for their purposes) that is, with a
propensity and forwardness in him to consent to such things as by them shall
be propounded: So that upon the matter they are but only Abettors and
Cherishers of him in such ways as (by their own former observations they have
discovered him to be addicted unto. That the King has consented to his
Parliament in the redress of diverse insufferable oppressions, he does not
deny; but yet not without they cry of the people in his ears for justice,
which the Malignants call driving him out of the Town: But the evil he has
done us has been voluntary, acted with much zeal and industry, to the great
disturbance and hazard as well of his own Person, as three Kingdoms. Nor will
He acknowledge that the very calling of this Parliament was a voluntary act of
the Kings: For if you consider the abrupt and sudden dissolution of the former
so little before, and in what condition the Kingdom stood when this was
called, you shall easily perceive it was a thing to which he was absolutely
necessitated, to still the people, who were otherwise resolved to throw off the
burden of oppression from their own shoulders with their own Arms, which he
conceives might possibly have been done by them (though not so lawful and
loyal a way) yet with more facility, less charge, and effusion of blood then
now. And from hence arises a quaere, which he knows not how to resolve, that
is, Why so many, who were implacable without a Parliament, should since have
their understandings so infatuated, as to forsake the same Parliament, and draw
their swords to purchase their own bondage against them who with the hazard of
their lives and livelihoods, have faithfully endeavored the preservation of
their Liberties.

And this he looks upon with grief, as a great forerunner of ruin, it being
an undeniable truth, that the misplaced confidence of the multitude, is the
only opener of a convenient gap for men that are great and bad, to bring in
upon a Commonwealth unresistable destruction, which sad experience makes too
manifest amongst us; for by that means pretense has raised all these powers
against reallity: So many false fighters for the priviviledge of Parliament,
antd the liberty of the Subject against the Parliament, because they will not
betray the trust of the Kingdom, in yielding up both that and themselves to
perpetual slavery: So many quarrellers with them, that nothing is made better,
but all things worse, and the greivance of the subject greater then before;
which he conceives to be as absurd to one of right understanding, as if a man
in the hands of Thieves and Murderers, ready to be spoiled and robbed of all he
has, should quarrel with his Rescuers, because both he and they are wounded in
his rescue. And his opinion is, that these preposterous mistakes proceed (in
part) from the astonishment of the people, being so amazed with these miserable
and unexpected alterations, that they are in their sufferings like a man in
drowning, who distractedly catching at any thing to save himself, fastens upon
his friend that comes to preserve him, to the loss or danger of both their
lives: For he conceives that no well recollected man can possibly believe, that
his Majesty now fights to maintain what he has already granted, a Trienniall
Parliament, the continuation of this, and the putting off all power from
himself to dissolve this or any other at his own absolute pleasure; but
rather, as one that has gone too far, to raze out the memory of those things
by the sword, and make them not Acts but oversights. For the better
illustration whereof, he would have you remember what a Noli me tangere the
prerogative has been to former Parliaments, when the sole power was in his
Majesty to dissolve them with a Sic volo, which does plainly demonstrate his
liberal yielding to this, in so many things, to be the highest point of
policy; that his evil Council did ever advise him to, since his coming to
the Crown, being not done by them with the least intention of any performance
(as we have since found by experience) but only to incline the peoples minds
to an opinion of a refractory Parliament, and the graciousnesse of the King:
upon which foundation, his Army was first raised; whereas if otherwise he had
relinquisht the Parliament, without passing those satisfactory Acts, he had so
evidently discovered himself to all his subjects, that this presence would
rather have fastened their malignity upon him, then persuaded their assistance,
which no man he conceives, can deny, that is not resolved to make his own
humor and partiality, the only object of his will, and wilfully suffer his
understanding to be led into error, by impossible positions, grounded upon
contrarieties, as that his Majesty has expressed much love to his subjects, and
care of the Commonwealth, in being so industrious to destroy both; or that he
undoubtedly purposes to govern a Parliamentary way, as his predecessors have
done; because he has so king strugled with the Laws of the Kingdom, to rule
by his Prerogative, without a Parliament, and at last forsaken it, when he knew
not how to dissolve it: for thus a malignant must prove his tenants, and no
otherwise.

His conclusion therefore is, that upon due consideration of these things, no
man can repine or murmr at the Parliament, for his present sufferings, except
he look only upon the present, and esteem future times impertinencies.

FINIS.
