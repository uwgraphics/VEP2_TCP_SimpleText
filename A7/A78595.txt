THE CHARACTER OF THE RUMP.

LONDON, Printed in the Year 1660.

The Character of the RUMP.
A Rump is the hinder part of the many-headed Beast, the Backdoor of the
Devils Arse a Peake, Tyranny and Rebellion ending in a Stink, the States
Incubus, a Crab Commonwealth with the But end foremost; 'tisa Town-ditch
swelling above the walls, a Sink taking possession of the whole House, the
Humors left behind after the substance of the Body politic is purged away by
the devils potions, the Tumor of the Breech, Caninus Apetitus in Ano, the
Epilogue grown greater then the Play, the Close of the Will crept into the
place of In nomine Dei Amen, the Whore of Babylon with her Arse upwards, it is
like a Comet which is all tail, and portends no less mischief, or you may call
it the tail of the Great Dragon, and it is a Thumper, for the devils tail in
Chaucer, being stuck in this, would look but like a maggot in a Tub of Tallow,
and yet he says That certainly Sathanas has such a Tail
Broader then of a Pinnace is the Sail.


If you would reach me the Equator, or rather one of the Tropiques, I would
give a shrewd guess at its abominable bigness; but it is best measured with
the Sword, as there is one has done it to my hands, Saint George killed the
Dragon, but George Monck killed the Dragons tail; it is pity to blurr this sheet
with its prodigious nature, unless we mean to make it a windingsheet for their
Rumpships, but that is needless, for they have another Scene to act, under the
Gallows, it being just they should corrupt the air being dead, that made it
their business to oppress the earth whilst they were living; Its mother is
Rebellion, and the Devil its reported father, but the truth is, it owes its
first being to the Pope, who that time made the Devil a Cuckold; Folly and
Self-interest were its Nurses, but the noble General Brown was its Godfather,
it is observed that Pride first raised them, and Pride it was that gave them
their first fall; when Noll, like an expert Mountebank gave them a Glister of
Opium, which made the Speaker dumb, and (O wonder) kept Sir Arthurs everlasting
wag-tail'd tongue quiet, and put them all into a sleep, which would have lasted
till doomsday, if the rustling of a Lamb-beard had not awakened them, but they
have had a nap since, and besides that, the symptoms of death are now upon
them, for by the violence of a Scotch potion they are become stark mad, and
every day are about to destroy themselves, the only Cordial which is left them
is the hopes of a Commonwealth, and there can be no restorative, but an Army of
Sectaries; their physic hitherto has bin only purging, but because the matter
of the disease is a Mass of earth, (Kings and others Lands) lying upon their
consciences) the noble Monck is providing them a Vomit, which with an Aymulett
of Hemp to be tied about their necks, will render them perfectly cured, An
ingenious person has observed, that Scot is the Rumps man Thomas, and they
might have said to him when he was so busy with the General, Peace for the
Lords sake Thomas, least Monck take us,
And drag us out as Hercules did Cacus.


But John Milton is their Goos-quill Champion, who had need of A Help meet to
establish any thing, for he has a Ramshead, and is good only at Batteries, an
old Heretic both in Religion and Manners, that by his will would shake off his
Governors as he does his Wives, four in a Fourtnight, the Sunbeams of his
scandalous papers against the late Kings book, is the Parent that begot his
late new Commonwealth, and because he like a Parasite as he is, by flattering
the then tyrannical power, has run himself into the briars, the man will be
angry if the rest of the Nation will not bear him company, and suffer
themselves to be decoyed into the same condition; he is so much an enemy to
usual practices, that I believe when he is condemned to travel to Tyburn in a
Cart, he will petition for the favor to be the first man that ever was driven
thither in a Wheel-barrow; and now John you must stand close and draw in your
Elbows, that Needham the Commonwealths Didapper may have room to stand by you;
this is a Mercury with a winged conscience, the Skip-Jack of all fortunes, that
like a Shittle-cock drive him which way you will, falls still with the Cork end
forwards: The Rumps Trumpeter being he that first found out the way to make a
Fart sound in Paper; A rare Fellow at funeral Orations, witness his eloquent
shreds in praise of that Devil incarnate King-killing Bradshaw, a brazen face
that dares lay his excrements under the Nose of the whole World, and has less
wit then the Countryman, who patting down his Breeches in the open Streets,
turned his Buttocks to the Company, because they were not so well known as his
Face; he was one of the Spokes of Harringtons Rota, till he was turned out for
cracking. As for Harrington he is but a demy-semy in the Rumps Music, and
should be good at the Cymball, for he is all for wheeling Instruments, and
having a good invention, may in time find out the way to make a Consort of
Grind-Stones. He has Oceans in his head, which if he take not heed will deluge
his other Parts. He is no common Man, for such he says can only feel and not
see, but the next summer he will see his Errors first, and then feel the
smart of them, would any man in his wits (think he) renounced his own present
Interest, and possession, to be at the curtesy of others for another Portion or
Inheritance. The People of England have lived happyly even to the envy of
others under Regal Government, they knew their own Rights, and Native
Privileges, shall they surrender these, and cancel their present happiness
which they are sure of, for the expectance of a better condition at the will
and pleasure of new Masters, upon the only security of Mr. Harringtons
Romantic Commonwealth? that the new Senators will do all they can to keep the
People in slavery, and to support their own Authority, is strongly to be
presumed from the fresh example of the late Monopolizers at Westminster, and if
they should do so, what better remedy have the freeborn people of England,
then Mr. Harrington had against him, that said his Oceana was a Strumpet, he
may know that if there were any inconvenience (as no Government is perfect) yet
it is prudence rather to suffer a Stone ill placed in the Foundation (though it
be an eyesore) to lie unmoved then by endeavoring to pluck it out, endanger
the whole building. How many new Laws have been made in this Nation, with full
and deliberate advise of the three Estates for the benefit of the
Commonwealth, when yet time and experience, the touchstones of truth, have
found them inconvenient afterward, and given occasion of their Repeal in
subsequent Parliaments. Have not many men applauded themselves with the
beautiful figure of a House drawn in Paper, when the material building
framed after the model has deluded their hopes, and given Repentance in stead
of Satisfaction? Surely Mr. Harrington did not copy any of his lines out of the
Book of Fate, therefore there is no necessity but that it may be subject to the
incidents of other projects, whereof not one in a thousand but have engaged the
untakers in infinite more troubles and vexations, then were at first foreseen. I
shall say no more of him, but desire him to recant in time, least he be esteemed
hereafter but the Rump of a Politician. The Rump had no mouth but that of their
Speaker, which is not very big, but has spoke a horrible deal of Treason in
his days, Its Arms have extended through the whole three Nations, and at last
whipped their own politic Breech, but I think it wants the propagating part ever
since Noll Eunuch't it, so that no Rump can be borne such, they must be framed
by Art, and the receipt of their composition you will find in the following
lines, copied from Sir Arthur Hasleriggs own Manuscript, Hew out a Statue from
Mount Caucasus,
Big as the Colosse in the Isle of Rhodes;
Then add a Brazen face, and Iron Hands,
A poisonous Vipers heart, and Leathern Lungs,
A Tongue of Bell-mettal, and an Ostrich-stomack
To digest Iron, Let his Legs and feet,
Be made of Quicksilver half fixed, and when
His outward Members are by curious Art,
Framed out in such dreadful Proportions.
Then let the Furies in Hells dark Alembeck,
With damned Chemistry extract the spirits
Of secret Treason, cursed Sacrilege,
Black murder, and false-hearted Perjury,
Pride, Hatred, Lust, and Swinish Luxury,
Fraud, Drunkenness, Oppression, and the rest
Of the black Progeny of Vice; and with
The Quintessence of these, being sublimated
Unto the height of wickedness, Inform
The ugly Mass with a more ugly soul.
And that the Monster may not want a name,
Say he is a Rumper, and we'll say the same.


FINIS.
