A delicate new Song, Entitled, Sweetheart, I love thee.
To the tune of, See the building.


Sweetheart I love thee
And deem no Less above thee
in all this City:
Sweetheart I woo thee,
And vow I Will never do thee
any harm for pity:
Sweetheart tell me thy fathers name,
and where he lives,
and what he gives
With you his Daughter,
who is so fair a Dame:
For it was to seek a wife
that I to London came.
Good sir forgo me,
My friends will not bestow me
upon a Clown.
I scorn to have one,
Unless he be a brave one,
who lives in Town:
I Will have one that comes from Court,
that swears and swaggers,
until he staggers,
That spends his means
and is not sorry for it,
Oh such a lively Lad
will show a Less good sport.
Sweetheart be milder,
I never embraced a wilder,
in all my life.
Sweetheart content thee,
Thou shall no whit repent thee,
to be my wife:
I have five pounds a year,
a brace of Geldings,
and sumptuous buildings
For thee and I to sit
and make good cheer,
If thou will be my Honey,
my Dove, my Ducke, my Dear.
A pox take your riches,
It seems by your great breeches,
from Court you came not:
I scorn such Asses,
Do court your Country Lasses,
for yours I am not:
Farewell my Coridon, farewell,
for I see now, man,
thou art some Plowman,
Thy very looks the same to me do tell,
Go kiss thy bouncing Kate,
and clip thy bonny Nell.
My suite is ended,
And I no whit offended
at thy disdain,
I Will beware me,
How ever I ensnare me
with such again:
Farewell, then, I scorn thy disdain,
away be trudging:
and fear no grudging:
For I Will go woo
some more honest and plain:
For I respect true love,
and prize it above all gain.
The second part,
to the same tune.


CIty Dames, attend ye,
With counsel I Will befriend ye,
if you will be witty:
For now I find it,
Though one I did not mind it,
more was the pity:
A Countryman excels a Courtier,
though not for bravery,
nor yet for knavery,
But if he will have thee,
do him not deny,
For any smooth-tongu'd
Courtiers flattery.
I once was wooed,
And well beloved
of o Countryman:
But I refused him,
Nay more with words abused him,
thus coy Dames can
With flouting words squib the simple,
that come to woo them,
with love to prove them,
Yet those Dames will show them
to be so nice and coy,
And count their loves
but as an idle toy.
A Merchants Daughter,
Her mind still runs after
some Squire or Knight:
She Will have a Courtier,
for to support her,
it is a goodly sight,
To see a man that struts in the fashion,
augments loves fire,
And still desire
to have a neat spruce Lad,
To strut before them,
as he were Anticke mad.
So they have a Gallant,
they never respect their talent,
nor stand for money:
If he be a fine one,
Yea or a witty-tongu'd one,
he shall be their Honey:
Proud City Dames are grown so dainty,
my self do know it,
of late did show it,
But now beshrow it,
that ere I seemed so coy
To that honest Country man,
that once held me his joy.
Thus she lamented,
Her mind was discontented,
and deeply vexed:
Her joys exiled,
The Gallant her beguiled,
which her perplexed
With tears she then did wail her
and then repent,
she never lamented,
But discontented
that man with proud disdain,
And sighing wished
she might his love obtain.
FINIS.
