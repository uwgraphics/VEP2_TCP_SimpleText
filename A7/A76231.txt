TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, And my much honored Christian Friend, TOBIAS FRIAR
Esquire, Justice of Peace in Norfolk, and now a Member of the High and
Honorable Court of PARLIAMENT.
R. B. Wishes all Grace, Health, and Happiness in this life, and eternal
Blessedness in the life to come.
Right Worshipful,
MAN, who is called of the Philosopher (...), or the little world, being an
Epitome or Map of the great Universe, although he be of the most beautiful
form, and fairest shape, excelling all other living creatures upon earth; being
styled of Hermes or Mercurius, A great miracle, a creature like the Creator. Of
Pythagoras, (...), The measure of all things. Of Plato, (...), The wonder of
wonders. Of Theophrastus, (...), The pattern of the whole Universe. Finally,
that Ancient Zoroaster, having long admired the singular workmanship shining in
the frame of man, at length cried out; (...), O man, the glory of nature, even
in her chiefest ruff and pride, and her Masterpiece, when she durst contend
with heaven it self. The Divines call him Omnem creaturam, because he is in
power (in a manner) all things; not for matter and substance, but by
participation or reception of the several species or kinds of things. Others
call him the royal temple, but I am sure he is the image of God. For as in
coin, the picture of Caesar, so in man the Image of God is apparently
discerned. The Kingly Prophet David full of heavenly inspiration, Psalm. 8.
desciphereth the dignity of man on this manner; Thou have made him little
lower then the Angels, Thou have crowned him with Glory and Honor, and given
him Dominion over the works of thy hands. Plato says, (and Aristotle from him)
that in the soul of man are three especial faculties.

1. The first he calls (...), The vegetative faculty, which of others is
called Virtus naturalis, the natural virtue of increasing; and the seat of this
in man, he says to be the liver; the properties whereof are to nourish, and to
beget, etc.

2. The second he calls (...), The sensitive faculty, whose seat (he says)
is in the heart; and to which he ascribes the vital virtue, and the motions of
the sensitive appetite.

3. The third he calls (...) the reasonable faculty, whose seat (says
Galenus) is the head; and whose operations are to imagine, to remember, to
understand, to judge, and to guide all voluntary motions. In the reasonable
soul, is a lively resemblance of the ineffable Trinity, represented by the two
principal faculties, the understanding, and the will; with the intellective
memory. But alas, who can describe the essence of the soul? Hippocrates
calls it, (...), The inaspectable or invisible nature, which can no more be
described by us; then our eye is able to see it self. For could the soul be
discerned with the eye, or conceived by the mind, how would it ravish us, and
lead us into an excessive love of it self.

This only is indivisible, and immaterial, this alone is incorporeal, immortal,
(...), or immutable; and may be called the receptacle, promptuary, or
storehouse of all the species or kinds of things, being a created substance,
and wholly in every particular part of man. These are excellent commendations,
which man has partly from his soul, the most excellent of all forms; and
partly from his body, which is, as it were, the measure and exemplary pattern
of all corporeal things; Also he is rightly endued with goodly gifts of nature,
so that by him are wrought and invented mavelous things.

And as the natural influences of the high lights (moveable and fixed in the
firmament) be known unto mankind; even so be the virtues of every creature here
in earth: as Beasts, Foul, Fish, Serpents, Trees, Plants, Fruits, Flowers,
Herbs, Grass, Gum, Stone, and Metal: There is nothing so secret, hidden
within the Minerals of the earth, or lurking so low under the floods of the
Sea, but by means and policy they are brought to use. Their Names, Qualities,
and Natures, are known unto mankind; To this end, that he should serve his
Creator in righteousness and holiness all the days of his life, for these
his gifts: Although, I say, man was thus gloriously created by the wise God of
Nature, at the first, good and healthful; God communicating to him wisdom, and
holiness; and all the perfections of other creatures being summed up in him;
and the rule, and dominion of all the works of God delivered up into his hands;
Though he were thus happy in his first estate, and should have continued so for
ever, if he had continued in obedience: Yet by disobedience, eating the
forbidden fruit (tempted thereunto by the old Serpent who envied his
happiness) he brought a ruin upon both worlds; upon the great world
calamities, etc. upon the little world, diseases and death. So that the whole
life of man is full of misery, and there be more ways of death, then there be
means to preserve our life: for as the Poet says, Mill modis lethi miseros
mors una fatigat. Though there be but one way for all men to come into the
world, yet there are a thousand ways for every man to go out. And so we find,
some have perished with sudden death, as Ananias and Saphira; Some with
gluttony, as Domitius A^fer; others with drunkenness, as Attila King of the
Hunnes; others by waters, as Marcus Marcellus; Some with hunger, as Cleanthes;
others with thirst, as Thales Milesius; some were stifled with smoke, as
Catulus; others died with a fall, as Nestorius; others with overwatchings, as
M. Attilius; some with poison, as Phocion; others choked with flies, as Pope
Adrian; And Anacreon with a kernel of a Raisin; others torn in pieces by wild
beasts, as Heraclius, Lucan, and Acteon by dogs; Hypolitus, by wild horses;
Licus the Emperor by Lions; Ancaeus King of Samos, by Bores; and Hatto Bishop
of Mentz, by Rats; And so some with joy, as Chylo the Lacedemonian; And
Diagoras the Rhodian; who seeing his three sons crowned Champions in one day,
he rejoiced so much, that he died for joy in the same place, more die with
grief; Quia spiritus tristis exiccat ossa; because a broken spirit dries the
bones; But most men die with sicknesses and diseases, Fevers, Fluxes, Gouts,
Dropsies, Plagues, and 1000. more, they being so many, that neither Galenus nor
Hippocrates, Bosq. de finibus b^no r^m d^r inal page 31. and 32.
nor all the best Physicians in the world can number them, says Bosquierus;
the generations of men here on earth, being as Homer says, (...). Like unto
the leaves of the tree, whereof some do perish, and others spring in their
places: They spring, they flourish, they wax old, and soon wither away; Et tum
quoque cum crescimus, vita decrescit, and our life then decreaseth, as our
years increase.

Ut rosa mane viget, and sero vespere languet,
Sic modo qui fuimus cras levis umbra sumus.
That is, in the Prophets phrase, we bring our years to an end, as a tale that
is told. So that for all the excellent commendations, and singular virtues
given to man, yet he does decay, die, and return unto the dust, and become as
though he had never been; Although he be never so honorable, yea, or poor,
death does make equality between them. Every man's course is appointed, they
cannot prolong their time: notwithstanding God has ordained sundry means, by
his ministers to help mankind in time of sickness, to ease their pains, and
heal their diseases; And I being a child of the commonwealth, am bound unto my
Mother, that is, the Land in which I am borne, to pleasure it with any good
gift, that it has pleased God to bestow upon me: Not to this end, to instruct
the learned, but to help young and green Students in Physic and Chyrurgery;
That they may resort to this Enchiridion medicum, which I do dedicate unto your
Worship, as an argument of my good zeal and love that I bear unto you: Which
bold attempt of mine, I hope your wisdom will pardon; for I do plainly
confess, that I have not thought this Book of mine worthy to be perused by
you, as well because of mine own unabilty to perform any thing that your
Worship may like of, as also in respect of those manifold Graces wherewith the
Lord has filled you: by the virtue of which you could in a tongue far more
eloquent then this, discern and know the secrets of Physic. Yet
nevertheless, when I consider with my self that it was not the affectation of
any popular praise, but an honest zeal to benefit my contrymen, which begat
in me this desire to publish this Work, as likewise an earnest willingness
which I have always had to commend some piece of service unto your Worship: I
say, these causes meeting together, did especially induce me with such a bold
confidence, as it were, to rush into your presence, and to demand, without any
show of merit, your Worships most favorable Protection, that this Book of mine
(unable of it self) may run under your Patronage. The Lord God (who has
made you a notable instrument to work the advancement of his glory, the
furtherance and propagation of piety and good learning by your example)
lengthen and protract your life beyond your fatal period, and give you a will
to live, a desire still to bear up that burden, which the Country has laid
upon your shoulders; and with these, all good success in this world, and
sempiternall happiness in his most glorious Kingdom.

Your Worships most humble Servant, ROBERT BAYFIELD.
From my study in Norwich, December. 11. 1654.
TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
I Have for thy benefit collected out of sundry Ancient and Modern Authors, as
it were a breviary or Abridgement of Physic, and together with those
deductions, I have enterlaced many experiments of mine own, which by continual
use and practice, I have observed to be true. But I may seem to some overbold
in setting forth this book, when as the works of so Honorable and Learned men,
who have labored in this kind, are so learnedly penned, and highly esteemed.
In truth I must, and do most willingly confess, that neither in learning or
experience, I am to be compared with the least of them; nay unfit to carry
their books after them: yet notwithstanding, because many industrious Students
want an estate to purchase such Authors, their several prizes amounting to so
much, and also considering the great utility of an Epitomy of Physic, whose
matter is manifold, and use general; and that no English Author (I am sure in
this volume) as yet extant, has the Definitions, Causes, Signs, and Cures of
so many diseases, amounting to the number of one hundred and fifty, besides all
those particular diseases that are handled disperstly in this book, I have
thought it good therefore, I say, to epitomize, and contract the learned works
of the learnedest and best Authors in England now extant with us, into a
portable Enchiridion. Now what profit this my book will bring to young
Students, and such as thirst after knowledge, I leave to the event: If none, I
hope Godwill esteem my labors, Non ex eventu, sed ex affectu, not according to
what it did, but according to what I desire it should do. I know it will pass
under the censure and judgment of diverse sorts of men; some are ignorant and
cannot judge; Et ideo grave judicium est ignorantis, and the ignoranter man,
the severer Judge. Others are too rash, and are ready to censure it before they
read it, or at least do read by starts, and judge by parcels, and so must needs
be partial in their judgment. Others are malicious, maligning, and depraving
other men's labors; and I know many about this City that can hear all, but can
speak well of none, being full fraughted with jeeres, and can so well dispute
and craftily reason, that they will easily make Candida de nigris, and de
candentibus atra.

But to such I say, as one lately did to the like,

Cum tua non edas, carpis mea carmina Leli:
Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua.
Sloth sits and censures what the industrious teach, Foxes dispraise the grapes
they cannot reach.

Therefore I entreat thee who ever read this Work, that thou would give
thy mind, as well to pardon failings, as to know the truth. If thou meetest
with any faults escaped, either through forgetfulness or non-understanding; I
desire thee either with thy pen to correct them, or in courtesy to conceal
them; Remembering that the first editions of young Writers may have some faults:
If my endeavors want strength, thou can not in equity deny me pardon, seeing
thou thy self may run upon the same Rocks in other difficulties: for, Nemo
sine crimine vivit.

Now Courteous Reader, expecting thy favorable acceptance of these my
labors, which expectation of mine, if it be not deluded, I shall be further
encouraged to consecrate the residue of my studies to thy commodity.

Thine ever to his power, ROBERT BAYFIELD.

ENCHIRIDION MEDICUM: Containing The Causes, Signs, and Cures of all those
Diseases, that do chiefly affect the Body of MAN, etc.
CHAP. I. LIB. I.
APOPLEXIA is a disease that, (...).
in the strength of it, is mortal, and admits no cure but by Divines: but in a
small Apoplexy there may be some small hope, and the cure is not altogether
impossible.

The cause is a dull, slow, gross, phlegm, Causa.
filling the ventricles of the brain, and the Arteries of the Rete mirabile,
that the spirits cannot pass from the heart, into the ventricles of the brain,
which is called by Hippocr: Hippocrates
(...). The Metropolis or chief seat of cold and glutinous moystures.

The sign is, Signa.
when there is a sharp pain in the head: brightness before the eyes: the veins
in the neck swell: and a gnawing of the teeth while they sleep: their urine is
little in quantity, black like rust, and canker in metal, and a residence like
Meal, they lack sense altogether, they lie as they were asleep with their eyes
shut, and do snort. A strong Apoplexy is, when the breathing is so diminished,
that it can hardly be perceived; and that is almost evil, when the breath is
stopped for a while, and then fetched out with great violence.

Hippocrates says, Hippocrates
it is impossible to cure a vehement Apoplexy, and not easy to cure a weak
one, for it threatens speedy death; besides, if it chance by medicines to be
taken away, for the most part it leaves a palsy behind it, either in the whole
body, or in some part thereof: but if it be a weak one, it may perhaps be
cured, as experience has proved in some.

If you perceive plenitude, Curatio. Venae-sectio
open a vein, but not without the counsel of other Physicians, for it either
kills or delivers, if they do join in it, open the Cephalica vein, and then
this clyster following.. Clyster.

without any further expectation, to digest the matter (for if it be not looked
unto the same day, the patient dies) we give these pills following: or if the
patient be so stupid, that he cannot swallow them, they may be dissolved in a
sufficient quantity of Sage-water, and so give it him in the form of a potion..
Pilularum Cochiarum, Pilul. foetidarum, Pilulae.
ana.ss. Pil. aurearum,.j. misce cum syrupo de Stoecade. f. pil. No. 5. Then it
is good to apply cupping glasses on the calfes of the legs, Cucurbitulae.
and afterward below the buttocks, and ascending upwards till we come to the
shoulders, let his drink be oximel compos. If he cannot swallow syrups, put
into his mouth a dram or two of the best Methridate, for it is very profitable
in this disease: Methridatum.
both before and after evacuations, keep his body loose, and he may drink of
the palsy drink, which you shall find in the following Chapter; Lastly.

CHAP. II.
PARALYSIS, is a deprivation of sense, (...).
and motion, but not of the whole body, as happens in the Apoplexy, but one
side; or all the parts of the body, are infected; besides the head: as the jaw,
the tongue, the eye, the foot, the hand, the arm, and sometimes the lip:

The cause are gross, and clammy humors, Causa.
stopping the sinews, and hindering the animal faculty, that it cannot come,
from the fountain to the members.

For the cure; Curatio.
if you see cause, open a vein of the sound side, and draw blood by degrees,
because that nature may thereby send the matter from the part that is hurt,
Venae sectio
to the part that is sound: after bleeding, or if perhaps the patient have not
bled, yet nevertheless frictions and rubbings must be used on the sound part,
whereby the matter is diverted, and also light rubbings and frictions to the
part affected, whereby natural heat may be stirred up, then purge with such
things that purge the phlegm, as these Pills following.. Pilulae.
Pilularum de hiera Simpl..ij. Agarici troch..ss. misce. cum syrupo de
stoecade, and fiant pil. 5. which must be given to the patient at midnight, or
if you see cause, you may make a potion that purges phlegm. The next is to
drink often of the syrup of oximel, and take a tent and dip it in mustard, and
put it into the nostril, is very good: and to drink of this decoction following
is excellent.. Decoctio.

Bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae, and fiat decoctio. Also Methridate,

CHAP. III.
VERTIGO, is a disease, (...).
wherein the patient does imagine, that his head and all other things, does
turn round, and the brain is so affected, that the eyes grow dark and dim, that
if the patient be not stayed up, he falls to the ground.

The cause, is, either of the brain, Causae.
being distempered, and evill-affected, or of the mouth of the stomach
offending the brain. The brain it self is evill-affected, when as a gross and
tough humor is contained in it, from whence a vaporous and windy spirit, being
resolved by weak heat, is moved inordinately about the brain. The mouth of the
stomach does affect the brain, when through corrupt homours, being gathered
abundantly in it, vaporous and windy exhalations are carried up to the brain,
and so turn about the animal spirits contained in it.

For the cure, the first intention is, Curatio.
to open a vein, drawing away a little blood at a time, Venae sectio
if nothing forbid it: then to purge with a dosse of head-pills, as. Pilularum
cochiarum,.j. f. pill. 7. Pilulae.
when the body is well purged, take this sternutament following, as much as
will lie upon a halfpenny piece at a time, in a morning fasting; snuff it up
into your nostrils, many have been perfectly cured with this Receipt only..
Sternutamentum. Pulvis.
Sem. Maioranae, Betonicae, ana.ss. Pyrethri..ss. Hellebori. alb.,ss. Piperis
nigri. Euphorbii. an..j. fiat pull. Also, foeniculi dulcis, beaten to fine
powder, and taken in the pap of an apple in a morning fasting, and to drink
oximel, is good. If there be inflammation, the opening decoction is very
profitable, Vomitus.
but if the cause come from the stomach, then it must be cured by vomiting, and
stomach pills; Lastly, this electuary following is very good to strengthen the
head and stomach.. Electuarium. Hollerius.
Specierum aromatici rosati, triasantali an..ss. sacchari rosati q. s. cum sir.
rosato. fiat elect.

CHAP. IV.
PHRENITIS, (...).
is a disease wherein the mind is hurt only, and differs from madness, which
is called in Greek or Latin, Melancholia aut Mania, for that a fever is joined
with the frenzy, and therefore the frenzy may be called a continual
madness and fury, joined with a sharp fever.

The cause, Cause. Galenus.
as Galen says, is an inflammation of the brain, or filmes thereof; some
Physicians are of opinion, that this disease proceeds from a hot impostume of
the brain, and that it is in vain to undertake the cure; and the reason is,
because it is confirmed in a principal member; wherefore the intention of the
Physician must be, to hinder that it may not happen, for having once taken a
man, it is in vain to enterprise any cure: yet I will show you a way, under
God, to prevent it: but first I will let you to know, when the patient is
inclined to a frenzy.

The signs of a frenzy to come, Signa.
are the signs of a present Paraphrenisis, as continual headache, redness of
the face, overmuch heat, redness of the eyes, with too much appearance of
their veins, staring, thirst, dryness of the tongue, unquietness, different
from wonted actions, and some Alienation of mind, whether these things happen,
by the force of some acute fever, or some other cause; by these you shall judge
Paraphrenisis, and a fear of a frenzy to come.

For the cure, Curatio.
first consider whether there be fullness of the body or no; if there be, we
may open the vein which is common, or the vena nigra, of the right arm, Venae.
secti^
and draw out five ounces of blood, let this be done in the morning, and in the
afternoon, administer this clyster following.. Malvae, violarum, Mercurialis,
an. M. j. Clyster.
Bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae, usque ad consumptionem medietatis.
strain it, and add olei violati.iij. Cassiae Nov. ext..ss. Sacchar. Rub..ij.
As much salt as will lie on a sixpence: and this is to be considered, that the
oil of Violets is most requisite in the frenzy, because the patient is
subject to watchfulness, and Violets do procure sleep, but in sleepy diseases
it must be avoided, as in Subeth, Lethurgies, Subeth.
and such like: the next day following, we may open the Cephalica vein in the
right arm, and draw forth the quantity of four ounces of blood; which done,
about four of the clock in the afternoon, let him take the foresaid clyster,
make him barley water, Victus ratio.
nip the juice of Lemonds into his beer: ale of chirmd-milk is good, but no
strong beer: the next day, which is the third day, if the disease grows
worse, the hemerodial vein must be opened, out of which must be drawn three
ounces of blood; and if the disease do still remain, then we are to doubt of an
Impostume engendered, wherefore we must be bold to open the vena Recta of the
forehead, and to draw the quantity of three ounces of blood, for by this
blood-letting, all evil affects of the head, for the most part are removed;
then to procure sleep, take this Julep that follows.. Julepus.
Syrupi de papavere, err. and aquae lactucae, ana..ij. If all this will not
serve, commend the sick to God, and so much of the frenzy.

CHAP. V.
EPILEPSIA, (...).
or the Falling Sickness, does show it self as a convulsion of all the parts
of the body, but not perpetually: and it does bring with it hurt of mind, and
sense. There are three differences in this disease, for either it happens
when the brain is affected by it self, which is, when the original springs
from thence, or else it springs through the consent of the stomach, being
evil-affected, from whence vapors arise to the brain: or else through the
consent of some other subject part, from whence venomous vapors do arise, and
do creep into the brain by hidden passages: for some say that they do feel the
cause of the evil, from that part of the body, from whence it springs, as it
was a vapor, or cold air, carried into the brain, by the continuity of the
parts.

The cause for the most part, Causa.
happens from the abundance of a melancholy and phlegmatic humor, from
whence venomous, corrupt, and virulent vapors do arise, from which happen
obstructions in the Meatus, and passage of the brain.

As soon as this evil takes them, Signa.
the sick falls down, and they are plucked up together, they snort, and
sometime they cry out, many do tremble, and turn round about, but the peculiar
sign is foming at the mouth.

For an infant take green pionie roots, Curatio.
slice them length-ways, and cut them so as they may be made fit to hang about
the child's neck, like a bracelet, then make this Ecligma following:. Cranii
humani, pulveris paeoniae, mellis opt. misce. omnes, quant. suf. fiat Ecligma.
Ecligma.
Oximel is also very profitable, anointing the neck behind with oil of dil,
and exetor, Oleism.
only advise a diet for the nurse, of meats of good juice, Victus ratio.
(if the child be not weaned) her diet must be hot and dry, that thereby her
milk may be the hotter, and thinner. For those that are elder in years, if you
perceive they be of a plethorick body, Venae-sectio
a vein may be opened: and withal, once a week the humors offending, may be
avoided by purgations, and first this clyster.. Clyster.

this clyster be given about ten in the forenoon, at night let him drink a
little oximel, and anoint behind his head with oil of dil, Pilulae.
and exetor, then take Pilulae Epilepsiae, two or three at a time, if the fit
come in the night, take them in the night; if in the day, take them in the
morning: also this bolus following, a dram at a time, in the morning about
seven of the clock, is good.. Bolus.

Afterward if you see cause, you may purge with this potion.. Potio purgans.

CHAP. VI.
LETHARGVS is a disease, (...).
which does provoke the patient to sleep without resistance, and it brings
with it, forgetfulness, and for the most part deprivation of all the senses,
the reason is, because not only the hinder part of the head is affected, and
therefore principally the memory is hurt, but also the forepart of the head, by
which the patient does not perfectly feel this disease, that has a great
affinity with Caros and Subeth, Caros. Subeth.
but only differs in that Caros is void of a fever; but indeed a more profound
necessity of sleeping, possess him; for being pricked, he is scarce stirred,
Caros or dead sleep is scarce discerned from the Apoplexy, yet nevertheless
in this it does differ, that he that is affected with Caros, does breathe
freely and easily, but the contrary does happen in the Apoplexy, yet the cure
is all one, to the lethargy, and performed alike, they that have the lethargy,
will answer to a question, if much compelled.

It is caused of abundance of phlegm, Causa.
which cools and moisteneth the brain, and thereby provokes sleep, the
phlegm putrifieth the brain, and thereby causes a fever, which is always
annexed with this disease.

Their pulse is watery, great, Signa.
and strikes seldom, they are continually sluggish, and sleepy, they will
sometime open their eyes, if you cry aloud to them, and shut them forthwith;
they gape and gasp often, sometime they keep their mouth open still, as though
they had forgot to shut it. Curatio.
For the cure, first administer this clyster following.. Clyster.
Radicis lilii alb..j. Rutae, salviae, maioranae, Malvae, ana, M. j. florum
Roris-Cam. Meliloti. Centaurei. Minor. Betonicae, an. M. ss. Sem. lini, anisi.

Afterward if blood do abound, Venae-sectio
you may open the Cephalica vein, then after that it will be very necessary to
purge, with these pills following.. Pil^^ae.
Pil. hierae. pierae galeni..ij. pilul. stomac. castorii. cochiarum. an..ss.
cum sir. de stoecade. q. s. f. pil. 8. If the patient cannot swallow them, then
dissolve them in.iij. of aq. betoniae, mellis Rosati,.j. and give the patient
to drink: for the faculty sensitive is so stupefied, that the patient does
scarce taste the bitterness: then it would be very profitable, Cucurbit^lae.
to apply cupping glasses to the shoulders, and keep accustomed evacuations if
they be retained, such as are the hemroydes, menstrues, etc. and a tent of
strong mustard put up into the nostrils, Sternutamentum.
and to provoke sternutation is good: and lastly, take mustard seed bruised,
Mixtura.
and mix it with honey, vinegar, and methridate, rub and anoint the tongue,
and palate of the mouth; Gargarismus. Marquardus.

CHAP. VII.
SPASMOS in Greek, Convulsio in Latin, (...).
is a disease, in which the sinews are drawn, and plucked up against our will.
There be of it three kinds of differences. The first is called in Latin
distensio; it is, Distensio.
when the neck remains altogether immovable, and cannot be turned away, but
must be holden right forth. The second is called Tensio ad anteriora, Tensio ad
anteriora.
in this disease the head, and neck, be drawn down to the breast. The third is
called Tensio ad posteriora, Tensio ad posteriora.
in this disease the head is drawn down backward to the shoulders, which is
most dangerous.

The cause of this disease, Hippocrates, Causa. Hippocrates
appoints but only two, that is, fullness and emptiness of the sinews in
the body, sometimes it comes with the biting, or stinging of some venomous
beasts. If the cramp take one that is whole, or by and by, as soon as the
disease comes, or not long after, then this disease is caused of fulness; but
when the convulsion comes after, in any sweats, vomits, watchings, or
dryness, or purging, then it comes of emptiness. The diet of them that have
this disease, coming of fullness, must be hot and dry: but where it is caused
of emptiness, their diet must be moist soopings, and fat broaths: If this
disease be of fullness, first administer this clyster following. Curatio.
. Radicum Liliorum alborum..j. fol. salviae, Clyster.
Betonicae, ana. iij. florum cardui benedicti. Camomeli, Mercurialis,

Car..j. mellis Ros..j. olei lilio. alb. iij. salis. q. s. f. Enema. Then if you
perceive he has a very foul body, and full of blood, Venae-sectio
it were very fit to open a vein, and also if phlegm bear a share, and
windiness in this disease, of fullness, then purge with this following potion,
but first prepare the humor with oximel, over night.. Potio purgans.
Diaphaenicon.ij. pull. Sanct. benedict. ana.ss. oximel. q. s. fiat potio. Then
it were fitting the convulsed parts were rubbed, and chafed with warm linen
clothes, and then anointed with oil of Rue, and castoreum, O'cum castorei.
or oil of dil, and exetor, and hypericon, which you will; and after they be
well anointed, bind them up with Wolves or Foxes skins, if you can get them:
let them be bound up warm, Sternutamentum.
and straight; also use the sternutation, and with the oils aforesaid, anoint
the hole of the neck. There is one thing more that is excellent in this cause,
Infusio me. thridatum.
and that is the infusion of castoreum, and a dram of methridate, administered
in oximel fasting in a morning: if you see cause, you may give it at twice. If
this disease happens by the biting or stinging of a venomous beast;
Medicamentum.
then bruise scabious, to which mix a little treakle, with the yelk of an
egg, and so apply it upon the affected part; if this disease chances through
emptiness, it is such an evil, Victus ratio.
as that it is almost incurable: their cure is moist soopings, and fat broaths

whole cure must always be like the cure of hecticks; now after he has

best way will be to boil them in a larger quantity, until the flesh come from

will serve for another clyster, because you cannot well boil a sheeps-head in a
quart, much less two heads, if occasion should serve.. Mythridatii.ss.

CHAP. VIII.
CEPHALALGIA. (...). Galenus.
Galen says, there are three pains in the head, and they are sundry. The
first is Cephalalgia as aforesaid, that is, when the pain is new and
tolerable. The second is Cephalaea, which is an old inveterate headache,
stubborn, and confirmed. The third is, Hemicrania, and does occupy the half
part of the head.

The cause of Cephalaea, Causa. (...)
is abundance of blood and other humors, or by the sharpness of humors and
vapors, contained within or without the scull, and inflaming the head.

The sign is, Signa.
exceeding pain, continuing long, and hard to cease, upon which light occasion,
have very sharp and great fits followed, so that the patient can neither abide
noise, loud speech, nor clear light, drinking of wine, nor savors, that fill
the brain, but desires for the greatness of the pain, to sit or lie quiet in
the dark, supposing that his head were stricken with a hammer.

The cause of Hemicrania, Causa. (...).
is by the ascending, or flowing of many vapors, either hot or cold, either by
the veins, or arteries, or by both.

It is a painful evil, Signa.
remaining in the one half of the head, either in the right half, or in the
left of the head; to be short, the cures of the pains in the head, are
according to the diversity of causes. But first I will show you from whence it
proceeds, whether from heat, cold, moisture, or dryness, etc.

The sign of headache, Signa.
caused of heat of the, Sun, is when a body tarry long in it, having vehement
pain, you shall feel their head hot, as soon as you touch it, and their skin is
drier than it was wont to be; their eyes do look red, and are delighted with
the sprinkling, and anointing of cold things.

The sign of headache caused of cold, Signa.
outward, as when the air is very cold, especially when one tarry in it a long
time bare headed, or by applying suddenly any cold thing to the head: the pain
is vehement, yet the head when it is felt on, is not hot, and the face and eyes
do not look red, nor their face is not dry, and shrunk, as that which is
caused of outward heat, but contrariwise, full, and pale, their eyes are
swollen, and swarth, and they feel ease by hot things.

The signs of headache caused of dryness, Signa.
are: there come few excrements, or none at all out of the nose; If the eyes be
hollow, and the patient, that is pained, has watched much before, and the skin
of the head is drier, then it is a certain sign, that it comes of dryness.

The sign of headache caused of moisture, Signa.
is meant either by moystening medicines, or by the moist air, by bathes, or
the like: There is much filth coming out of the nose, the eyes puffed up, and
swelled, and the patient sleeps much, while you judge of it, be sure you
mark, whether it be hot and moist, or cold and moist, do cause the pain.

The sign of headache caused of blood, Signa.
is: when the veins swell, the face and eyes be red: the veins commonly, when
blood do much abound, may be seen even to the smallest; the the pulse is great
and vehement, the urine reddish, and thick: the veins of the temples do beat;
and the pain is heaviness.

The signs of headache caused of choler, Signa.
are: the pain is like the headache caused through heat of the Sun, but their
pain is more sharp, and pricking, their head is moderately hot, their face is
pale and wan, but the peculiar sign is bitterness of the mouth, and dryness of
the nose, eyes, and tongue.

The signs of headache caused of phlegm, Signa.
are: there be fullness and heaviness of the head, and whiteness and moystness
of the face; moreover, the sick will easily fall asleep, he is slow, his senses
are dull, and he abounds with moisture or excrements in his head, this
headache is apt to breed some ill infirmity, if not looked to in time.

The signs of headache caused of windiness, Signa.
are: there be felt distension, and streaching in the head, without heaviness
and beating, and if there be sound and noise in the ears, then it betokens
windiness.

The sign of headache caused through the default of the stomach: Signa.
it may be known through the biting and gnawing pain they feel; moreover in
this kind of headache, if the sick, fast and suffer hunger long, the pain is
the more vehement, for through long abstenence, the Malice of the humor
increases.

The sign of headache caused by fevers, Signa.
is evident enough, and the sign is all one to that of blood, and choler. Now
I will go forward to the cures of these headaches, one by one.

The cure of Cephalaea, Curatio. Venae sectio
is first to open the Cephalica vein, on the same side, if strength will suffer
it, and anoint the head with oil, or ointment, of a cooling quality; and this
cooling clyster following, is very proper in this headache.. Malvae, violarum,
Mercurialis, an. M.j. Clyster.
Bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae, usque ad consumptionem medietatis:
colatura, add butyri quantit. ovi, sactharum Rub.. j. salis communis.ij. fiat
Enema. Administer it about four of the clock in the afternoon, and give cooling
things.

The cure of Hemicrania. Curatio.
if it proceed of a hot cause, cure it as you do Cephalaea, and abundance of
humors, only purge twice in two days, with the aforesaid clyster. If it come
of a cold cause, purge strongly with this Recipe following.. Pilularum
foetidarum pil. cochiarum. an.. ss. Pilulae.
fiat pil. 5. Anointing the head with oils, that have power to heat, and
dissolve, for although here be many things which be excellent, for headaches,
yet nevertheless, we have seen pain of the head and teeth proceeding of a cold
cause, with one only purgation, has been removed, and so a hot cause with one
only blood-letting.

The cure of headache, Curatio. Oleum.
caused through heat of the Sun. Take oil of Roses, and a little vinegar being
added to it, it will pierce the faster, and deeper, and also besprinkle
Rose Water on the forepart of the head, where the seam goes overwhart; for it
is the thinnest part of the scull, stupefactive things are to be avoided, such
as juice of Poppies, Nightshade, or of Mandrake.

The cure of headache, Curatio.
caused by outward cold, is to anoint the forepart of the head with with oil
of Rue, or the like, and if plethorick, and somewhat costive, Ol^umrutae
Clyster. Curatio. Oleum.
you may give a sharp clyster, that you think proper.

The cure for the headache caused of drines: you may anoint the forepart of
the head with oil of sweet almonds, or with oil of violets, and cammomel,
mixed together; it is also good to drop some of these oils into the nostrils.

The cure for the headache caused of moisture, Curatio. Oleum.
is to anoint the head with oil of Rue, Cammomel, or Euforbium, or oil of
Ireos; this must be done: if the cause be cold with moisture, (as you may in
part judge by the water) then use such things as are hot and dry, if the cause
be cold and moist: and use such things as are cold and dry, if the cause be
hot and moist. In this Chapter are remedies enough of all sorts.

The cure for the headache caused of blood, is first to open the Cephalica
vein, Curatio. Venae-sectio
on that side the grief is on; eschew strong beer, wine, hotwaters, and spices;
but take all cooling things; if much blood does still abound, you may open the
vein in the forehead, and it were fitting a cooling clyster were administered,
Clyster.
such a one as you shall think fit.

The cure for headache caused of choler, Curatio. Purgatio.
must be begun with purging of the chollerick humor straightway, because
choler is thin, and moveable, and will easily be purged out: for digestion is
nothing else, but an alteration of the humor causing the disease, therefore
such medicines must be used each morning fasting, before you do purge, until
good concoction appear in the urine; for by this means choler being concoct,
and as it were tamed, and made mild, becomes so obedient unto nature, that it
will soon, without any grief be drawn out by purging, therefore for a
preparative, use this or the like medicine, syrup of violets, or syrup of
popies, which of them you will. j. Iulepus.
Syrup of water lillies,.ss. distilled waters of Indive, Succory, and Roses, of
either.j: mix them, and let them drink of it in the morning fasting, or you
may give the decoction of saene,, and then you may purge with pil. aurae, make
six or seven: Pilulae.
also anoint the forepart of the head with oil of lillies, and popies. If
choler in the stomach do disturb the head, vomit with Stibium, Oleum, Vomitus.
the infusion thereof, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14. according as you shall see cause,
sometimes nine dragmes is sufficient.

The cure of headache caused of phlegm, Curatio.
is first to extenuate, and make it thin, fit for purging, with oximel, and
Sir. de stoecade, when that is done, take this. following.

. Pilularum. cochiarum, Pilulae.
pilulae hiero cum agarico, ana. ss. Sem. paeonia. no.. Sir. de stoecadae. q.
s. fiat. pil. 7. But remember that you provoke vomit with Asaron, Asaron.
if their body be loose: and if choler be the cause, as aforesaid, vomit not
with Stibium, until the body be loose; either naturally or artificially. If
the headache be inveterate, and abundance of phlegm, purge twice in four days
with the aforesaid pills, Sternutamentum.
sternutation is also good.

The cure for headache caused of windiness, Curatio. Oleum.
is to anoint the head with oil of Cammomel, but the best, is oil of Nutmegs,
Mace, Rue, and such things as have power to discuss windiness: neesing is also
very good, and a clyster made with Aniseeds, Clyster.
Fennel-seeds, Carraway-seeds, and Commin-seeds, boil these (of each alike,
with one large handful of Bettonie) in a quart of water to a pint, strain it,
and ad. Benedict. lax.. ss. diaphenicon.. ij. this is for a lusty body.

The cure for headache caused through default of the stomach, Curatio.
Vomitus.
is to vomit, and if any humor fire the tunicles of the stomach, purge with
Hierapicra, Hierapic.
which is a sovereign thing.

The cure for headache caused by fevers, Curatio. Venae-sectio
is forthwith to bleed, if nothing prohibit it: eschew all hot things, and take
all cooling things, anointing the head with oil of Roses, and juice of popies.
Lastly, a cooling clyster will be wondrous proper, such a one as you shall
think fit: and to procure rest, bathe the temples of the head with a little of
this liniment, following. Linimentum.

MEMORIA DEPERDITA. The loss of memory, chances sometime alone, and sometime
reason is hurt with it.

The cause is sometimes of coldness, Causa. Signa.
with moisture, and sometimes by a cold and dry distemperature; If coldness
with moisture be the cause, then the party is very drowsy and sleepy, and much
moisture is avoided at the nose. If it be caused of a cold and dry
distemperature, the patient is watchful, and yields forth little or no
moisture. Curatio. Oleum. Gordonius.


For the cure, if it be caused of a cold and moist distemperature. Gordonius,
advises to use oil of Castoreum, and of Euphorbium; also to give for certain
days together, Confectio ex ana cardis. ij. with the decoction of smallege,
and fennel roots, and it is sufficient to mix one dragm: with a little
quantity of Methridate, Methridatum.
or Treakle, and to take every morning a spoonful of sir. of stoecados, does
profit much; oil of cinnamon is good to anoint the head, Ol. Cinamomi.
and if the cause be cold and dry, cure it with things that be hot and moist.

MELANCHOLIA, is a delirium, or doltishnesse, (...).
which springs from a melancholic humor, without a fever, which does so
perturbe the seat of the mind, that the speech and actions are altogether
void of Reason.

The cause sometime is of the common vice of melancholy blood, Causae.


The signs are, Signa.
fearfulness, sadness, hatred, and also they which be Melancholius, do
always laugh, and weep; some think themselves inspired with the holy Ghost,
and do prophecy upon things to come: but these be the peculiar signs of them
that have melancholiousnes, Melancholius, caused naturally, or through certain
thoughts, watchings, or eating of wicked meats, through hemroyds, or
suppression of Menstruis: but they which have Melancholia,

For the cure, if it be caused of adusted blood, Curatio.
first administer a clyster, Venae-sectio
that if good blood shows forth, close up the vein, but if the blood shall
appear gross, black, and turbulent; then we draw away according as we shall
see cause, a sufficient quantity, but first administer this clyster following..
Epithymi, thimi, florum. Stoecados, violariae, Clyster.
Mercurialis, fol. Malvae, an. M.j. bulliant in sufficienti quantitate aquae,

administer such a potion, as you shall think proper: then to digest the matter,
we give this syrup following.. Sir. de pomis. simpl..i. Sir. violati.ss. aqua.
Mixtura.
bugloss. violarum, boraginis, ana.j. misce. Let his meats, Vietus ratio.
be meats of good juice, which are hot and moist, but more moystning than
heating, and music, with what delights you can, but let his diet be slender.

If it be caused of adusted melancholy; Purgatio.
first purge with pills, or potion, which purge melancholy, afterward, if you
see that blood abound, open a vein with the former caution, but however open
the hemroyd veins with leeches, and use a concoctive syrrup, and anoint the
temples of the head, and pulse of the hands, and soles of the feet, with this
ointment, made as follows.

. Linimentum. Vnguentum.
Olei nenupharis, ung. popui..ss. misce. prolinimento. Or else you may take

poppies.ij. mixed with.iv. of the water thereof, Iulepus.
is good: let him ride or walk by places pleasant, sailing on waters, and such
things to delight in.

If the disease proceeds from the stomach and sides, Vomitus.

remember to keep accustomed evacuation, which you do with this decoction.

MANIA AVT INSANIA FVROR, that is, madness, (...).
they that have this disease be wood and unruly like beasts, it differs from
this frenzy, that because this disease comes without a fever.

The cause is much blood, Causa.
flowing up to the brain, and yet the blood is temperate, sometime it happens
through a sharp chollerick humor, and sometime melancholy and choler do so
prevail, that they are forced to be bound in their beds some are of opinion,
that sometimes a spirit troubles this kind of evil, which say they, is known
by discoursing with him, after the fit.

For the cure: if it be caused of blood, Curatio. Venae-sectio
you must begin with blood-letting, and in women cut the inward vein in the
anckle, anointing the head with unguents or oils that be cold and moist, to
procure sleep. And purge if you see cause with a cooling clyster. Vomitus.
If it be caused of choler, purge or vomit with such things as purge choler,
if the fits be violent and strong, take this powder following. Pulvit.
. Take Brimstone, Gunpowder, Hypericon, Mugwort, Vervine, powder of peony
roots; of each a like quantity in powder; mix them altogether, cast a little
on coals, and hold his head over it.

CHAP. XII.
CATALEPSIS, (...).
or conglation, is a certain sudden detension; both of the mind, and of the
body, with the which whosoever is taken, does retain the same figure of the
parts of the body, which he had when he was taken, whether he were sitting or
lying; from whence it is called of some, Stupor vigilans,, because the sick is
become senseless, and altogether without motion. This disease does agree with
the Apoplexy, in this, that, as in the Apoplexy; so in this disease, the
patient does lose both sense and motion; but herein it differs, because here
the spirits themselves are affected, and congealed, and do remain as it were
still, and quiet, and in whatsoever part of the body they are taken, the parts
do remain cold, stiff, and hard, but contrary in the Apoplexy. The eyes of
those that are Apoplectick, are closed up.

The cause of this disease, Causa.
is an exceeding cold, and dry distemper of the brain, by which it happens;
as well the brain, as the animal spirits, to be both congealed and dried: this
disease if it be not speedily cured, it kills the patient.

For the cure of this most grievous evil, Curatio.
we must administer those things that do moderately heat, and moysten, and
first a clyster, which you shall find to be excellent; it is made as
follows.. Floru. camomeli, meliloti, ana. M.ij. Clyster.

clamors and noise, with painful bindings and rubbings of the extreme parts, the
better to excite and stir up the sick: Sternutamentum. Venae sectio
for that purpose we administer also sneesings. If this disease proceed from
abundance of blood, open a vein, then afterward use such ointments and oils,
as resolve; such as be. Ol. Anethi, ol. camomeli, and ol. liliorum; ana.i.ss.
coquantur in iis, cum hyssopi, thimi, Vnguentum.
postea addatur, colatura, castorei. i.ss. fiat ung. s. A. with which anoint
the cataleptick parts, as the hinder part of the head or the like; those oils
you use to bathe withal, let them be oil of Castoreum, or Euphorbium, Ol.
Castor. Euphorb.
and the like; be sure to keep the body solluble in the cure, then afterward,
we give such things as are comfortable, and have a property to comfort the
brain, and heart, as follows.. Electuarijum.
Theriacae.j. Diamusci. dull. laetificiantis Gal. ana.. ij. ss. Conservae
Buglos. anthos, an..ss. Syrupi buglossati. q. s. ad Electuarii mollis,

curnell fasting: also Dianthon, Dianthon.
in the composition aforesaid, will be very proper, and thus thus briefly (at
this time) I end this most dangerous disease called Catalepsis.

CHAP. XIII.
ANGINA: (...)
is an Inflammation of the larinx, or weasand, and of the rest of the parts of
the throat, which does hinder both breathing, and swallowing: this disease is
very dangerous, if not looked to in time, because he can hardly draw breath,
nor receive nourishment.

The cause for the most part is of blood, Causa.
flowing from the jugular veins, in which there is great store, or else from a
bilous, or choleric blood; Angina notha.
or else from some defluxion of a cold humor, and then it is called Angina
notha, or bastard squinsie.

For the signs, Signa.
if it proceed of blood, there is a full pulse, and great difficulty of
swallowing, and breathing, redness in the tongue, and face, with a troublesome
fever: if it proceed of a chollerick blood, then there is a very sharp and
acute fever, with intolerable burnings, and with bitterness of the mouth, if
it proceed from a cold humor, then there is much moisture, little or no fever,
the pain is less, and the tumor more lax:

We must at the first open a vein under the tongue, because there is need of
present help, Curati^. Venae-sectio
but if it has gone past three days, do not open a vein without the
concurrance of some other learned man, give all cooling things, and make a
Gargarisme with strawbury leaves, Gargarismas.
woodbind, and fivefinger, of each alike, boil them in fair water, and in the
latter end of the boiling put in a little Alum, and honey, gargarise the
throat often.

To cure the squinsie caused of a cold humor, as phlegm, take Sturcus canis
album, Calamenthae fiat decoctio, dissolve allom with oximel, or let the
foresaid powder be blown into the throat through a quill. Also to gargarise
with thin mustard, is good: and administer a clyster. But above all, if the
body be bound, give such a quantity of jallap, Jalapium.
in oximel, as you shall think proper, which I have found by experience to be
excellent good, and some have been perfectly cured therewith. Also this Ecligma
following is good.. Piperis.ss. croci myrrhae ana scrup. j. mell. Ecligma.

PLVRITIS, (...).
the plurisie, is an inward inflammation, or apostumation of the upper skin,
girding the ribs, or sides within.

The cause is an abundance of hot blood, Causa.
flowing unnaturally to that part, and this is pluritis vera, it takes its
name from the part affected, called plura.

The sign, Signa.
is difficulty of breathing, a cough, a continual fever, vehement and pricking
pain, with a high and hard pulse.

For the cure, Curatio. Vanae-sectio
first the liver vein must be opened, on the same side that the patient is
grieved, for thereby shall the matter be presently drawn forth, Clyster.
and then administer a coolling clyster; Take all cooling things, because of
the fever annexed with it, Apozema.
and refrain all hot things. And take an Apozem with loosening syrups;
Sacculus.
and apply this bagg. following.. Camomeli. M.j. Boil it in a pint of the
oldest strong beer you can get, when it is well boiled, then put in as much
course wheat bran, as will thicken it like a poultis, put it into a bladder,
and apply it as hot as may be endured: then. Haustus. Marquardus.

CHAP. XV.
PERIP NEVMONIA is a hot impostume, or Inflammation of the lungs, (...). Causa.
with a sharp fever: for the most part it is caused of strong and hot Rheumes,
and distillations, falling upon the lungs.

The sign is great difficulty of breathing, Signa.
fulness, and streaching out of the breast, without pain, but if the skins, which
be joined all the length of the breast be inflamate, then they feel pain of the
breast, all the face, and the agrieved place, look red, the nose is crooked in
the top, the veins of the temples do beat, the tongue is dry, the appetite is
lost, the breath is hot, they covet cold water, they have a dry cough, and is
frothy, or chollerick, and bloody, or red, which be the worst tokens: if the
sick shall die, Prognostica
he shall watch much, and shall have fearful short sleeps; If he recover, there
will follow bleeding in abundance.

For the cure, Curatio.
if this disease come after other diseases going before, you must eschew
blood-letting: Venae-sectio
but if it begin without any disease going before, then bleed, if strength will
suffer it, on both arms a little at a time: Lohoch e scylla. Ecligma.
e pulmone vulpis, and syrup of Hyssop is good, the cure is much like the cure
of Pluritis.

CHAP. XVI.
SPVTVM SANGVINIS proceeds of diverse causes, Causa.
as fullness, and abundance of naughty blood, which by its sharpness does gnaw
and erode asunder the veins, and so does break open the heads of them,
sometimes through sharp humors, which do distill from the head to the lungs,
or else are engendered in the lungs themselves, or through some fall, or through
great crying, Hippocrates.
or immoderate cold, as Hippocrates witnesses, breaks the veins.

For the sign, Signa.
if the spitting of blood, be of blood in abundance, then it comes out gushing
all at once, and after it is out, the sick is better; but if it be caused
through bursting of a vein, then hot perturbations have gone before it, and
comes out on heaps, by little and little, with the cough, and they are
always worse, also if it be froathy and palish, and comes forth now and then
with the cough, then it is a certain sign, it proceeds from the lungs, so it
be without pain. If phlegmatic blood be spitted out with easy coughings and
streachings, then the blood comes from the Trachaea Arteria. If blood be
spitted forth, being black and clodded together, having also the cough and pain
in the agrieved place, then it is a token it comes from the breast, many times
it comes out of the nose from the head.

For the cure; Curatio. Venae-sectio
If it be caused of abundance of blood, then open a vein, and use the juice of
nettles, to snuff up into the nostrils, or to drink, and minister such things
as be altogether of a cooling quality; if it proceed from the lungs, charge
them that they do not breathe much, nor make a noise, Aq. sperm. ranar.
but speak as little as may be, use Aqua spermatis Ranarum, which seldom or
never fayles, and indeed it is good for either of them. If there be a great
faintness and danger of Syncope, Vinum.
give a little Claret wine burnt often: also if you see cause, you may give the
patient bolus-armeniae, Pulvis.

dragm with Rob. deriberius, or with Syrrupo myrthino, or conserve of Roses.

CHAP. XVII.
TREMOR in Latin, (...).
trembling or shaking in English. It is a disease which is accompanied with two
sundry movings; one is, while the member is constreyned through heaviness and
grief to creep downward, the other is, while the member is carried upward from
his natural course and faculty.

The cause is altogether through weakness of the sinews, Causa.
and does plainly declare old age, but privately it comes of other causes,
that is, of very cold temperature of nature, cold drink taken out of time, or
season; especially in fevers, moreover, the abundance of a cold, gross, and
clammy humor, and much using of wine that is unmixt and clear, old age, and
fear, are causes thereof; as for signs you need none, because it is known by
the sight, and words of the patient.

For the cure it is in a manner all one to the cure of the palsy, Curatio.
and cramp (letting of blood only excepted) the decoction of Egrimony, Decoctio.
Castoreum, and the brains of a hare are said to be good, but if it comes by
drinking of wine, let him drink the decoction of sage, Decoctio.
and betony, with Hydromel, until he be cured.

CHAP. XVIII.
PTHISIS AVT TABES, (...). Signa.
is an exulceration of the lungs, which does follow for the most part, spitting
of bloody matter, or the cough proceeding off or from some sharp defluxion;
sometimes also the lungs are exulcerated by reason of Apostumes of the breast,
and when the matter of one being broken forth into the spaces of the breast, and
cannot in time be purged and avoided, but there does lie and putrify.

The sign is, Signa.
there does follow this disease, weakness, and a pining away of the whole
body, the nails grow curned and crooked, the eyes are sunk into the head, the
face is deadly and wan, the hairs fall away, and there follows a flux of
the womb, and finally death.

This disease has always been accounted incurable, Curatio.
and especially by the ancient Physicians: for although we may cure the ulcers
of the lungs, yet because there is left behind it certain callos and fistulous
relics, they do very easily, and in short time, break out again: but as
concerning the cure, the medicines following are approved to be very good, for
cleansing the ulcer. Hydromel alone, and Mulsa; remembering always when we will
deterge, and cleanse the Ulcer, we must give the honey cruide; but to glutinate
and join up, the honey must be boiled, but if you will have a medicine, that
shall both deterge, and consolidate, take this. following.. Lohoch de pull.
vulpis, lohoch sanum, ana.j. Lohoch.
Sir. ros. siccarum. and de glyzyrhyzoe, de hyssopo, capil. vene, tussila. and

CHAP. XIX.
PALPITATIO CORDIS is an immoderate elevation and depression of the heart
against nature: the new sorts of Physicians do wrongfully call it Cardiaca
passio, Cardiaca passio.
for that is an effect of the mouth of the stomach it self, and not of the
heart.

The cause is either a distemper, Causa.
or the multitude of an humor, contained in the outward skin that goes about
the heart; or else swelling contrary to nature, and such like.

The sign is known by the pulse, Signa.
for in a hot distemper there comes a fever, and the pulse is swift and great,
and their urine very high colored; In a cold distemper, the contrary. If
plenty of an humor contained in the upper skin of the heart do cause beating
thereof, then the pulse is soft and feeble. Indeed it is easily known by the
words of the patient, who does feel the beating and panting.

The cure is performed according to the diversity Curatio.
of causes. If it be caused of a cold cause, or the multitude of a cold humor,
Purgatio.
then purge with such a purgation as you shall think proper by the water,
Decoctio.
and to administer the drink set down in the Chapter of the palsy. And amongst
simple medicines, these be profitable. Amber, musk, saffron, wood of aloes,
styrax, cloves, and mace: among compounds these are good, Elect. diamber,
dianthos. Species Aromaticum Rosarum, diamargariton callidum; Electuarium.
of these you may make Electuaries and lozinges, and of the simple medicines
use the oils thereof, as, anoint outwardly the region of the heart with oil
of saffron, cloves, mace, O^^um.
amber, and the like. Those that be vexed with beating of the heart, caused off
a hot distemper, they must have remedy by cold medicines, which can correct the
hot distemper, and add strength to the heart, as those be among simples, as
Roses, Violets, Borage, flowers of water lillies, Saunders, Coral, Camphere,
and such like amongst compounds be these, Diamargariton frigidum, diarrhod

and comfort the heart.

CONCRETIO LACTIS is caused through abundance of milk, Causa.
which is not drawn forth: it is caused also of some hot distemper, when
through overmuch heat, the thinner part of the milk is digested, and dissolved,
and the rest grows together, and turns into curds: it may also be caused of
cold, which may cause the milk to congeale, and turn to curds.

For the sign, Signa.
there needs no tokens to know this evil, for it is known by and by, both by
touch, and the patients words.

For the cure, Curatio. Victus ratio.
the diet is diverse, according to the diversity of causes, for in a hot
distemper of the paps, their diet must be of a cooling quality, in a cold
distemper, contrary. If it chance through grossness of the milk, then there
must be an extenuating diet. If there be abundance of milk, not being as yet
curded, it must by little and little be sucked out. If heat cause the curding
of the milk, then anoint them with juice of Nightshade, also apply oil of
Roses and vinegar, also a Lilly root roasted and stamped with oil of Roses,
Cataplas. ma. Oleum.
and applied, is good. If it be a cold distemper, anoint the paps with oil of
cammomel, dill, and lillies, beware you touch not the nipple; also this
Emplaster following is held to be excellent good. Emplastrum.
Take honey half an ounce, styrax callamite three dragms, of oxes gall two
dragms, oil of Cammomell,.ij. Myrrh, and Frankincense, of either two ounces,
make an Emplaster according to Art. In a cold cause oil of wormwood is good,
also women use linseed oil, and searge cloth thereof, Oleum.

CHAP. XXI.
INFLAMMATIO MAMMARVM, Causa.
is caused of abundance of hot blood, flowing to the paps, sometimes through
milk curded, and turned to suppuration, and matter; the aforesaid causes are
easy to discern asunder: for the first cause of Inflammation chances to them
that be not with child, nor brought to bed, the other chances only to such.

For the cure, Curatio. Venae-sectio
it is good first to open a vein in the arm, (...), the inner or internal
vein, unless the Menstruis be stopped, for then it is better to cut the vein
on the ham or ankle, afterward if the body be costive, losen it with a cooling
clyster, and if you see cause, you may give this gentle Apozem, that cools and
quenches the Inflammation, and opens obstructions in the breast, as
follows.. Apozema.

of Roses, Ol. Rosar.
vinegar, and juice of nightshade, also crummes of bread and fair water
applied like a poultis with vinegar is good, let them beware that they drink no
strong beer, wine, hot waters, nor spices, but altogether soopings of a cooling
quality, no fish, nor flesh, that is hard of digestion; if the milk be curded,
turn back unto the foregoing Chapter, and that will direct you what to do. If
there be much pain,. Epithema. Weckerus.

CHAP. XXII.
IMBECILITAS STOMACHI is caused through distemper of the working qualities,
without any flowing of humors, Causa.
sometimes it is caused of an humor contained in the bosom, and large space
of the stomach, which has power, either to heat, cool, movsten, or dry, or
two of these qualities, mixed together; and sometimes it is caused of an
humor, stuffed and drowned in the filmes, or coats of the stomach.

For the sign, Signa.
in a cold cause there is dull and difficult concoction, the taste of the
nourishment is felt long after, there is sharp belchings, and little or no
thirst, but contrary in a hot cause, there is exceeding thirstinesse, abhorring
of meat, and bitter belchings, and this is certain, that if the cause be heat,
the patient is cased by administering of cold things, if it be a cold cause,
then he is eased by hot things, if that choler cause it, there is such bitter
belchings, that there is cast forth bitter choler, with bitterness of the
mouth.

For the cure, if it come of a cold caul, Curatio. Pilulae.
as of phlegm, purge gently with stomachal pills, if they have gone a day, and
have not had a stool, then take one pill an hour before supper. Then take this
cordial Electuary following, which is said to be good.. Electuarium.

Nucis Muscatae, ana. ss. Sir. absynthii, and de Hysopo, q. s. f. Elect. Molle:
If necessity do require, Methriditum.
add two dragms of Methridate, and take of it every morning the quantity of a
Walnut curnel, then eat a piece of Lozing. aromat. Rosat. and drink after it a
draught of Wormwood wine, for that will prepare the stomach to the next
concoction, and also bathe outwardly with oil of wormwood, Oleum.
nutmegs, cinnamon, or mastick; or the best is to spread honey on bread tosted,
and cast thereon the powder of nutmegs, cloves, and cinnamon, and for the
richer sort, take this made as follows.. Pulvis.

emplasters, and cataplasms, must not only be applied before, but behind also,
about the thirteenth Vertebra.

In a hot cause purge with Cassia, Apozema.
and Rhubarb, or else an Apozem; and open a vein if you see cause, Venae sectio
and then this Electuary is said to be very good.. Electuarium.
Cons. Rosarum. j. Diarrhodon. alb.. i. ss. Sir. assato. lymonum. q. s. f.
Elect. Also direct Lozenges of Diarrhodon alb. Triasandali, and make him broth
with cooling herbs, currents, and damask pruins; also bread dipped in Posca is
wondrous proper to be eaten; Posca.
as for outward applications, use oil of Roses, Oleum.
Quinses, or the like; but take heed of things that cool too much, yet give him
no strong beer, no wine, hot waters, spices, nor milk, etc. If chollar do
abound with costivenesse of body, purge with an Apozem made with Cassia,
Rhubarb, Apozema. Vomitus.
or the like. If temperate, provoke vomits with Stybium, the infusion thereof.

CHAP. XXIII.
CANINA APPETENTIA, (...)
is an immoderate or dog-like appetite, or desire of meat, and when they cannot
refrain their appetite, they devour in meat without measure, then being heavy
with the multitude of meats, and the stomach being not able to bear the same,
they turn to vomiting, then afterward they fill themselves, and turn again to
vomiting like dogs, the part affected is the mouth of the stomach.

The cause is a perpetual gnawing or biting of the mouth of the stomach, Causa.
like unto a sucking, sometimes it happens through a cold distemper of the
mouth of the stomach: sometimes through cold, sharp, and vicious humors:
sometimes it proceeds through certain kinds of worms, which do devour the
meat that is taken into the stomach, as fast as it is received: sometimes
through dissipation of whole body.

For the sign, Signa.
if it be a cold distemper, it is known by windiness, and rumbling: sharp
humors are known by four belchings, dissipation is known by the excrements,
for they be scorched, and less in quantity than before.

For the cure, Curatio. Pilulae.
in a cold cause it is good first to take stomacal pills; also Hierapicra
Galeni. 6. with wine infused with water, or given in oximel fasting, is good,
and to drink muscadell is good, he must abstain from all sour and restrictive
meats; but let his meat^ be meats of good juice: if a child labors in this
disease, the body being bound, Sir. de Rhubarb.
and a doubt of worms, give it one ounce of Syrrup of Rhubarb, or more,
according to the age and strength of the child, the one half over night, and
the other half in the morning warm, either in muscadel, oximel, or the juice of
pruins; also let it have muscadel oftentimes instead of beer: Vinum.
If the child be very young, give it no beer until it be well. Also oximel is
good, give it honey with any thing you give it if the disease be caused of
dissipation, Mel.
or extreme heat, give it all cooling things, and if you fear worrnes, let
Wormseed and Rue be boiled in vinegar with honey, Syrrupus.
and give thereof often. You may boil the Wormseed in muscadel, if nothing
forbid it; Fernelius. Avicenna.
if you want more, look in Fernelius, and there you may find plenty of
remedies: Also Avicen bids that wine should be given before meat, and Galen
commends a vomit. Vomitus.


CHAP. XXIV.
CATARRVS is a distillation of some Rhumatick matter into the lower parts:
(...).
as when it falls to the mouth or jaws, it is called Gravedo, when it
falls into the nose, Gravedo.
and causes the pose, some call it Raucedo, Raucedo.
others when it does descend to the nostrils, and cause opilation, they do call
it Coryza, Coriza.
and when it does desce^^ to the parts in the throat, Branchus.
it is called Branchus, and when it does descend to the breast and lungs, then
it is called a Catarrhum, from whence this verse does arise; Si fluit ad pectus
Rheuma, tunc dico Catarrhum, Ad fauces Branchon, ad nares, dico Coryzam. The
cause is either of some outward cold, Causa.
or heat, sometimes evaporation of meats, sometimes the smell of hot or cold
things, the immoderate use of Venery, over much sleep, violent exercise, or too
much rest, or repletion.

For the sign, Signa.
if the flux of humors come off heat, the head is hot, and a sharp and thin
humor distilleth as well by the nose as by the mouth; also the face and nose
is red, and for the most part there follows a fever: contrariwise they that
have the flux caused of a cold humor, their head and forehead is stretched
forth every where, also a phlegmatic and thick humor, distilleth out of the
nose. For the cure, Curatio.
if a hot humor distill from the head, together with a fever, the first thing
is to purge (if costive) with this cooling Apozem.. Apozema,
Decoctio sennae.6. Sir. Rosarum. j. Sir. de Rhabarbaro..ss, Mix them, and make
an Apozem, and give it half overnight and the rest in the morning warm: or if
you think proper, you may wash the belly with a clyster, Venae-sectio
and be sure you open the Cephalica veins if nothing forbid it; also power rose
vinegar upon hot tile-stones, or iron, and so receive the fume, but the best is
this Gargarisme following.. Gargarismus.

(if it be salt rheum, and falls to the eyes, Emplastrum.
apply an attractive plaster to the hole of the neck, and every night when they
go to bed, Vuguentum.
gr. ij. of ung. Tutiae, will be good to put into the corners of the eyes, then
shut them, and anoint the eyelids all over) in a cold cause, after you have
purged as aforesaid, either with pills or potion, use this hot Gargarisme
following.. Gargarismus.
Cyperi, calami, aromat, ana. ij. fol. Myrtinum. M.ss. corticis Thuris,.ss.

proper to use fumes of Styraxcal, Fumigatio.
cinnamon, frankincense, cloves, mastick; these you may make into powder to
strew upon coals: also of these may be made booles, adding thereto Syrrup of
Myrtles, with a little cinnamon water. Lastly, draw the rhume back with a
plaster of Cantharides, and take Pillulae de cynoglossa, made as follows..

CHAP. XXV.
ASTHMA is a certain difficult, thick, (...)
and hard respiration without a fever: Causa.
and is, when as gross and clammy humors, in abundance, be gotten into the
grissles and lappets of the lungs, or when there is some swelling like unto a
botch, sometimes a pestilent air, and the fume of quicksilver may be the
cause; also intemperate diet, and idleness, and grossness of body, but
chiefly it happens from a gross clammy and viscus phlegm, which does stick
in the passages of the sharp Artery.

For the sign, Signa.
it is easy to be known asunder (for distillation does often chance in hayl
folks, by and by through a manifest cause, in a manner altogether without a
fever, having the tokens of distillation following it, if there be swelling of
the lungs like a botch, then there must needs follow a fever, and so within few
days after it, the inflamed botch being rotted, the matter is cast out with
the cough, if there be a cruid and raw Tubercle, and both engendered, such do
not feel any great grief, neither are they troubled with much difficulty of
breathing, but they are much troubled when they eat or drink, because they
cannot swallow but with great grief.) Now they which be properly Asthmatick, or
orthopnicks, have no fever at all, and there chances to them heaviness of
sense, and they do not spit out matter with their spittle. There is also a
difficulty of breathing, Morbus virgineus. Glissonius.
not unlike this, which happens unto young women, commonly called the Green
sickness, or white fever.

For the sign of this sickness, Signa.
you shall know it thus, their water is pale, and inclining to greenish, their
Menstruis be retained, and great difficulty of breathing when they stir,
their complexion is like the wall, and they do desire those things generally,
that put out natural heat, as milk, apples, nuts, pears, fish, roots,
turnips, wheat, oatmeal, and such like; now I shall first give you a way how to
cure Asthma, and then the green sickness, which is a disease very common.

For the cure of Asthma, Curatio. Victus ra. tio.
is first to erect a fit and convenient diet: that I leave for brevities sake,
to the discretion of the learned Physician. The next intention must be to purge
with this or the like purgation.. Potio pur. gans
Diaphenicon..ij. pull. Sanctus, Jallap. and benedict. lax. an.. ss. vini albi.
q s.f. potio. Or if there be abundance of blood, Venae sectio.
a vein may be opened, always providing that you keep accustomed evacuations.
And to use moderate exercise, after the taking of this loch, in mornings, or
before meals; is good,. Conserv. Rosa. Rub..j. pull. Ireos. Lohoch.
and sulphur. liquiritiae, ana. j. Anisi.. j. Tussilag. q s. fi. lohoch. Which
must be taken the quantity of a Walnut curnel last at night, and first in the
morning, and in the day time between meals. Wormwood here is also very
profitable, and to eat three figs every morning, Matthiolus Ficuum. Emplastru^.
madufied in Aqua vitae, Matthiolus does much commend it; lastly, to apply to
the breast a plaster of figs, barley meal, having rosin, honey, and wax commixed
with it, and to anoint the breast with oils of Ireos, Dill, and Rue. Oleum.
For the cure of that which is like a botch, has need of medicines, to
atenuate and dry; It must be cured with aromatic things: Theriaca,
Methridatum, Theriaca, etc.
Diamber, Aromaticum Rosarum, Diamargariton callidum, and many such other like,
remembering you keep accustomed evacuations, and moderate exercise.

For the cure of the green sickness, Curatio. Victus ratio. Febris virginea.
the first intention is to prescribe a fit and convenient diet, such as is
Rabbets, Chickens, Veale, roast, reare-egges, or the like; and if you will take
a right course, some kind of women must be stented of their meat and drink, or
else they cannot be cured; that beer they do drink should be of the best beer,
and they must beware of meats that are scorched, and must leave at meals with
an appetite, they must eat no trash, as milk, roots, fish, green fruit, and no
salt things, and drinking after supper to bedward, or fasting a mornings, is
not good: the second intention is to take a vomit with Alsaron, Vomitus.
Venae-sectio
the third to bleed of the foot, and to take of this drink following, a quarter
of a pint at a time, Exercitiu^.
every morning fasting; and to use exercise after it, either to work or play is
very profitable; Take new beer three pintes, when it is in the fat wrought
ready to tun, boil in it herb-grace, Decoctio.
and unset hysop, of either a handful, red Currants a quarter of a pound,
until half be wasted, then strain it, and add a little saffron. The fourth
intention is to take this Electuary following.. Elect^ariu^.
Cons. Rosarum Rub.. i. ss. confect. Gariophil..ij. Ireos-Chalybs, ana..iij.
spec. Arom. Rosat. pull. cinemomi ana.ss. sir. de Hyssopo. q.s.f. Elect. Molle.
Take of this every morning fasting, Lozenge. Vinum absynthium.
the quantity of a Walnut curnel, and eat a piece of Lozenge after it, and
drink three or four spoonfulls of Wormwood wine, and exercise by degrees. Some
have been helped by this,. Take two penniworth of nutmegs, Pulvis.
as much mace, and as much saffron, powder them fine, and add a quarter of a
pound of sugar, and three penniworth of prepared steel, mix them; probatum est.

CHAP. XXVI.
SYNCOPE, (...).
is a sudden, and swift failing of the strength, and it is a terrible symptom,
because it is the image of death, for both natural, animal, and vital, chiefly
do fail, from hence it happens, that there is no pulse, nor respiration,
sense, and motion is abolished. The face is wan and pale, the extreme parts are
chill, and moist, with a faint sweat.

For the cause, Causa.
it may come by immoderate watchings, anger, sorrow, great cares, sudden
fears, intolerable pain, acute fevers, immoderate emptiness, famine, sweats,
labors, vomitings, exceeding fluxes, loss of blood, a soddain emptying of
water, as in the dropsy; oftentimes it proceeds from abundance of gross,
cruid, rotten sharp, and biting humors, which do daily check, and as it were
fill the mouth of the stomach in such sort, that the passages of the spirits
are obstructed, that their motion is intercepted, even as it is when
respiration is let and hindered, as it is when abundance of humors are
concluded in the passages of the lungs, that the sick cannot draw in air, to
serve for the cooling of the heart.

For the cure, Curatio. Vinum. Galenus.
it is according to the diversity of causes, Galen in every swounding does
commend wine, which otherwise in burning fevers is dangerous, nevertheless it
may be used sparingly, in time of intermissions, so it be diluted with
Buglosse, Borage, and such like. Odors, and sweet smells, do comfort very much,
except choking of the mother be the cause, then sweet odors must be received
underneath, and to the nostrils apply things that be foetid and stinking, as
Castoreum, Assafoetida, and burnt hair; besides, we cause sternutation,
Sternutamentum.
which if the patient cannot do, it is a most manifest sign of death: If it
proceeds from poison, if we know the venim, we administer the proper antidote,
if not, we give treakle, or methridate.

If Cardialgia, Cardial. and stomachica. Medicamentum.
and Stomachica, do follow the syncope, then we take a toste of bread,
moystened in wine, and scatter on it the powder of Nutmegs, and Cloves, and so
apply it to the stomach, but not upon the heart, and this is to be observed,
that nothing repaires the spirits so soon as wine, because it is vaporous, and
has a great affinity with the the spirits: but some will say, why do they
sprinkle cold water on the face. I answer, because that the heat and the
spirits flying outward, may be driven and turned back, from their
circumference unto their Center, yet cold water must not be used in the syncope
of a flux; Theria^a. Galenus.
for thereby the flux will be increased, but rather use new Treakle; for Galen
affirms it stays all super-purgations and fluxes: if it happens through
immoderate sweats, then we sprinkle the face with Rose Water campherated,
Ol^r^s^^um.
and rub the body with cold linen, and anoint it with oil of Roses.

If it comes through inanition, or emptiness, as immoderate watching, much
venery, famine, and two much exercise or violent motion: then sprinkle the face
with wine, and let them smell to mint-water, and administer some cordial
Electuary, Electuarium cord.
as you shall think proper, remembering you put in new Treakle or Methridate.

If it be caused through vomiting, use frictions below, if through a flux use
frictions above: and wine is most proper in the syncope, coming of emptiness;

CHAP. XXVII.
SINGVLTVS is a motion, (...). Causa.
as it were a a cramp, raised through the expulsive faculty of the stomach,
which goes about to expel hurtful and evil matter.

For the most part it is caused of fullness or emptiness, as Hippocrates does
affirm, Hippocrates.
also sometimes it is caused of (or through) the biring of sharp humors in the
stomach, or coldness; and sometimes hot fevers may be the cause, when either
the stomach, or some other bowel is inflamed.

Fullness is known by heaviness, Signa.
and emptiness of those things that went before: you may know if the meat be
corrupt, by the burnt savor of it, but you shall know sharpness by gnawing,
pricking, and pulling.

1. Prognostics are, if neesing follow upon the Hicket, the patient is
delivered, so that it proceeds of fullness.

2. The Hicket coming in an Iliac passion is evil, or coming with swouning, or
with distention of nerves, or with dilerium, is a deadly sign.

3. Also coming upon the inflammation of the liver, of the womb, of the brain,
or upon some notable wound, is very dangerous, and oftentimes deadly.

4. In acute diseases, and burning fevers, and the pestilence, it is for the
most part deadly.

5. Also if it happens through two much emptiness, it is always evil.

6. It is also evil if it comes with vomiting, for it threatens danger of
inflammation of stomach, Cu^atio.
and brain: As concerning the cure, we must consider the cause. If it proceed
of emptiness it is the more dangerous, and therefore must be helped, by giving
fit and convenient nourishment, that thereby that which is defective, may be
supplied. If a flux of blood, or an exceeding flux of the womb do cause this
infirmity, we may give oil of sweet Almonds, either by it self, or in warm
water, he is to be nourished with cordial broth, there are some that cure this
Hicket with drinking of milk that do refresh, Amilum. Victus ratio.
but the best is Amilum given with milk: and the broth of an hen, and the flesh
thereof, capons, chickens, and Rear-egges, with the powder of Eringium, is
wondrous proper; his drink must be white wind diluted with water, Oleum.
the back and stomach must be anointed with oil of violets, and sweet almonds.

If sharp humors have stirred up the hicket, we must give such things as are
sweet and fat, as the fat of broth, of hen, or cock, or two spoonfulls, of
clarified honey, or penidice, Mel.
or pinecarnels, with sugar; or it may be purged, Purgatio.
so that it be prepared before with drinking of Aqua mulfa: if it proceed
through heat, Vomitus.
and biting sharpness, then to provoke vomit is wondrous proper, and to give
all cooling things, as julleps, Apozems, or juices, Julepus. Theriac.
or waters of succory, and such like, you may compose your juleps, with syrrups
of violets, Nymphea, of poppie, or the like; when the hicket is most strong, we
give new treakle.

If it proceed from a cold cause, and the matter gross, and viscus, prepare
the humor with oximel, and then a vomit, or purge, as you shall see cause, and
compose this Electuary following, for them that are able.

sufficient; Dioscorides.
Dioscorides commends Aristoloch. radix cum aqua, and Asplenum herba cum posca,
and castorum cum aceto. Also he commends Ineezing, if Singultus comes of
fullness. Dioseor. lib. 2. cap. 4.

DOLOR STOMACHI, or pain of the stomach is caused diverse and sundry ways, Causa.
as when naughty, venomous, and gnawing humors be kept in the stomach, whereby
it chances, that through intolerable gnawing, they cause swouning, Stomachae
cardialgiae.
which they call Stomachia, or cardialgia; sometime pain of the stomach is
caused through some stroke or fall; and an inflammation may be the cause
thereof.

In a hot cause, Signa.
there is felt a sharp pricking pain, gnawing in the mouth of the stomach,
bitterness in the mouth, vomiting of chollar, and there follows a great
weakness and feebleness of the whole body: in a cold cause the pain is less,
Curatio.
and more dull, and slow; in a hot cause, give this Apozem following, the one
half over night, and the other half in the morning warm.. Apozema.
Sir. de Rhubarb.. j. Rosarum sol.. ss. Decoctio. Sennae q. s.f. Apozema. Or if
you see cause, Vomitus.
you may vomit with the infusion of Stybium, and afterward you may take the
seeds of paeony in water of succory. If it proceeds through some stroke, or
fall, then this following is good.. Mixtura.
Mumiae gran. j. boli arm. gran. xvj. croci gran. vij. Let it be given the

In a cold cause, purge with such a purgation, Purgatio.
as you shall think proper by the water, or clysters, according as you shall
see cause, such a one as may purge wind and phlegm, or perhaps melancholy with
Cassia, and after may be given the seeds of Nasturtium, in Goats milk,
administering Sir. de absynth. menthae, mel. rosati, in aqua feniculi, and

TVSSIS, Galen in lib. 1. cap. 2. (...). Galenus. Causa.
de Symtomatum causis, does affirm that a cold distemper of the instrument of
breathing, to be the cause of the cough, also a humor distilling from the
head, to the Trachaea arterea, going about within, does provoke the cough,
sometimes it is caused through cold, or phlegm, descending upon the lungs,
sometimes it happens through heat, dissolving the superfluous matter of the
brain, and so through a cattarrhal distillation the cough is excited.

The outward signs, Signa.
they spit out nothing while they cough, neither is it so violent, but may be
eased by holding the breath, because through holding the breath, the
instruments of breathing, that were vexed with cold, do wax hot, and contrary
they are provoked with breathing, oftentimes to cough, their face is pale, and
they are not thirsty.

If a hot distemper be the cause, Trachaea arteria, and sometimes happens in
the plurisie.

For the cure in a cold cause, Curatio.
which for the most part happens in winter, may be helped with hot things,
his neck and feet are to be kept warm, Oleum.
and oils of mace, dill, and lillies, be good to anoint the breast; and if he
have a plethorick body, give a purgation made by the judgment of the water: If
a thin cold Rheum, give penedice, in every sooping they take, and syrrup of
oximel is wondrous proper. Oximel.
If from thin and sharp humors, then ingross it with syrrups of violets,
foals-foot, and maidens-hair, and stay the distilling humor with such things,
as you shall find proper in Catarrhus.

In a hot cause first an Apozem as you shall see proper, after take mallows,
M.6. currents, Apozema.
M.3. stamp them together, Decoctio.
then take Liquoress -j. boil them in four pints of water till half be
wasted, strain it, and add stone-sugar.ij. Syrrup of violets. j. give the
patient five or six spoonefulls at a time last at night, first in the morning,
about ten in the forenoon, Sir. de papavere erratico.
and four in the afternon; also syrrup of poppies in poppy water, or given
alone is good.

CHAP. XXX.
PICa, is a languishing of the stomach, (...).
with a provoking and desire of vomit, or casting of meat received, and
sometimes vomiting of chollar and phlegm, or it is a certain desire of vicious
and unwholesome meats, for they desire strange things, as raw-flesh, shells,
coals, chaulk, lime, salt, vinegar, old rags, rotten leather, tar, candles, and
one I knew would eat tobacco-pipes.

The cause according to Piso is a hurtful action of the animal faculty, which
does err, Pisco.
and not desire good nourishment, the part affected is the mouth of the
stomach, as may be perceived by the appetite, this disease happens for the most
part to young women, being repleat and full of naughty humors, but chiefly
when they are with child, sometimes to maids, and girls, and such as are
troubled with Cachexia, which is an evil state of the whole body with a
waterish disposition, whereby it waxes loose and soft, the cause, sign, and
cure you shall have in its proper Chapter.

For the sign of pica or malacia, Signa. Malacia.
is, that if there be shed, burnt, and black chollar in the stomach, they
desire such things as are acrid and sharp, as coals, ashes, tobacco-pipes, and
all such things as are dry. If salt humors, they desire those things that are
salt, some have referred the cause of this disease to be crudity and corruption
of the whole body, which being communicated to the mouth of the stomach, they
will have it to be affected by consent; in like manner there do appear daily
spittings, gnawing of the mouth of the stomach. If there be phlegmatic humors,
(heaviness) and according to the variety of vicious humors, and patient does
desire the foresaid diverse, and strange meats: This disease for the most part
as I said before, happens to young women with child, about the fourtieth day
from conception, and do continue often until the fourth month, and then it
cease, partly because vicious humors are avoided by vomit, and partly
because they are concocted, by reason that about those times, the woman
receives but little nourishment, through a loathsomenesse, partly because the
multitude is diminished by evacuation, that in the first two months, the child
draws but little to it self, because it is but small of growth, but in the
increase it does require more nourishment, (so much) as it draws something
that is vicious, as well as good, and so it happens that the whole body
becomes more empty from that vicious quality, and is less offended with
naughty humors. As for women with child, Curatio. Vi^ctus Ratio.
they seldom make use of a physician, but if any do prescribe a sparing diet,
as chickens, rabbets, or the like, with parseley; but nothing that is fat: a
mornings to eat almonds, and reysons of the Sun, and oximel, and to drink
muscadel in the day time is good, but suffer not much drink to be drunk,
because the meat will swim, and if a plethorick body, give clysters, Vomitus.
or provoke gentle vomits, but not in the first month, for danger of Abortive,
or if a child labors of this disease, use the means prescribed in the
Chapter of Canina appetentia: if it take hold on men, which is but seldom
known, Vomitus.
first prepare the humor with oximel, and then administer such a vomit as you
shall know to be proper. If chollar be adust and scorcheth, prepare the humor
with this Apozem following.. Sir. de Rhabar.. j. sir. Rosarum sol.. ss. Apozema.
Decoction Sennae. q.s.f. Apozema. Let it be taken the one half over night, and
the other half in the morning; after this, give such a purgation as you shall
know to be proper by the water, or if need be, give stomachal pills, Pilulae.
which are wondrous proper, to take one pill at a time, one hour before supper,
when they have gone a day and have not had a stool; or they may purge good
roundly with 7 or 9 at a time, Syrrup of Rhubarb is good for children, Syrrup.
de rhabarbaro.
and so is honey and muscadel, but indeed they must be diligently admonished,
and must be constrained from the use of such unwholesom feeding; those of
reason must hearken to persuasion, and children must be made to forbear with

CHAP. XXXI.
ANOREXIA, (...). Causa.
or loss of appetite, is for the most part caused through abundance of cruid
and raw humors, lurking in the stomach, or oppressed through nourishment
corrupted: sometimes it is caused by consent, as from a defluxion of the brain,
from whence a thin wheyish matter is sent unto the stomach, or else from the
liver being strongly affected; for it happens oftentimes upon the recovery of
some sharp and acute disease, that there is left behind a weakness of the
stomach: Also a chollerick humor, pressing the mouth of the stomach, may cause
this evil; and also it happens in fevers, and especially in Synochus, not
putrified, because through the abundance of blood, there is no attraction.

For the sign, Signa.
in a hot cause there is felt gnawing in the stomach, a desire to vomit, and
thirst, sometimes a fever with rotten humors; but contrary in a cold cause,
the part affected is the mouth of the stomach.

In a hot cause or chollerick humor, Curatio. Victus Ratio.
a cold diet must be prescribed, moderate sleep, and quietness, must be used or
provoked, his body must be kept soluble; if you see cause give a vomit, Vomitus.
if otherwise, purge with this Apozem following.. Sir. de Rhabarb. j.
Rosarum..ss. Decoct. Apozema.

else purge, which you shall find to be most proper by the water: with his meat
let there be given mustard, or else cloves, cinnamon, pepper, and vinegar with
sugar; or tarragant is good (with mutton) or capers: and to drink on mornings
wormwood-wine is wondrous proper; also Electuaries, Lozenges, Vinum absynth.
and the like: but for the poorer sort, first vomit, or purge, and drink
wormwood beer; Lastly refrain all kind of trash, and take of this Electuary
following.. Rosarum. Ligni Aloes ana.vj. macis, Electuarium latificans. Rhasis.

CHAP. XXXII.
SITIS, (...).
has a twofold cause: natural, and animal. The natural is by natural
inclination, to require a cold and moist substance, for to supply the place of
the substance, that was dissipated, wasted, and spent: but the animal appetite
is, when the stomach, feeling it self to be empty of moisture, does desire
drink, as happens in burning fevers.

Sometimes falt humors are the cause, Causa.
and drinking of old wine, the part affected is the mouth of the stomach,
either by it self, or by consent with the heart, or liver, and chiefly by the
inferior parts thereof, or with the lungs, or by the veins of the
Mesenterium, or the Jejunum inflamed; for those parts are accompanied with a
hot and dry distemperature, and indeed hapueth for the most part in hot and
putrified fevers, in hydropsies, and such like.

As for the sign it is needless, Signa.
for it may be known by the patients words: if the stomach be heavy and dull,
it signifies repletion: if falt humors, that is known by the patients eating of
salt things: if the cause be windiness, there is felt extension: if chollar,
bitter belchings, and extreme thirst: if sharp humors, biting, gnawing, and
such like.

If the cause be an hot inflammation, Curatio.
he must abstain from hot things, salt things, and immoderate exercise, and if
a plethorick body, Venae sectio
open a vein, and administer an Apozem, made as you shall see fit, and a Julep
made as follows: Julepus.
Take (French barley. i. ss.) French pruins.iv. boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water, until half be wasted, strain it, and add plantin wator.ij.
conserve of barberries. j. mix them, and drink thereof often; and hold the
conserve of aforesaid in your mouth, letting it dissolve by degrees, add to
the julep, loafe-sugar, and if it proceed of drunkenness, drink Aqua hordei; if
it comes of salt humors, Julepus.
as in the scurvie, then drink Aqua fumariae, and syrrupus fumariae, make a
julep, and drink thereof: Also purging is good, and refrain salt things. But
when it chance to those that have burning fevers, then give them Posca, that
is, Posca.
vinegar and water sodden together; if you will, Aqua spermatis ranarum.
you may add conserve of barberries: and Aqua spermatis Ranarum is very
effectual, mixed either with some cooling syrrup or conserve, or given by it
self, a spoonful at a time, Sperma ant semen ranarum colligitur mense Martio.
Destillatur autem per alembicum vitreum. Quercetanus.

CHAP. XXXIII.
NAVSEA, (...).
is a naughty and wicked motion of the expulsive faculty of the stomach.

It is caused of a vicious humor contained in Causa.
the stomach, being either hot or cold, which humor either swimmeth in the
concavity or hollownesse of the stomach, or it is stuffed in the filmes
thereof, cleaving like bird-lime, sometimes great exercise after meals,
sailing on the seas, and over fat meats, or stopping of the Menstruis, may be
the cause.

In a hot cause, Signa.
you shall find the sign in the Chapter of weakness of the stomach: if vicious
humors do swim in the stomach, then for the most part vomiting, follows; If
a tough humor like bird-lime be drowned in the cotes of the stomach, it
causes a disposition to vomit, but brings forth nothing; also a dullness
throughout the whole body.

As touching the cure of vomiting, Curatio.
you must note in the beginning, it ought not to be stopped, if the sick be the
better for it, especially if such things be purged, as ought to be; it is also
good, and may be suffered, if not, it is evil: for the cure, Clyster.
the readiest way is sleep, if it may be procured, as in a hot cause: if the
body be costive, administer a cooling clyster, adding thereto oil of
violets.iij. or give gr. iij. of laudanum Paracel. which is good: providing the
body be first made soluble: also infuse a piece of bread in white wind vinegar,
or rose-vinegar, and bruise it in a mortar, Ceratum.
and add thereunto powder of cinnamon, cloves, red-roses, or the like; this
may be applied to their stomachs warm; if children be troubled with vomiting,
give syrrup of Rhubarb, Cataplasma.
such a quantity as fitteth the age and strength of the child; and you may take
cammomel, wormwood, mint, and porret, of either half a handful, boil them in
half a pint of wine-vinegar, and thicken it with crumbs of white bread, like a
poultis, spread it on a double cloth, and apply it warm. If the body be
temperate, and a doubt of worms, instead of the syrrup aforesaid, use
worm-seed, according to the directions, in the Chapter of Canina appetentia; if
blood cause vomiting, you shall have directions in the Chapter of sputum
sanguinis: Vomitus.
In a cold cause procure vomiting with Asaron, if nothing prohibit; Pilulae.
and after use stomachal pills, mint-water, and the syrrups of wormwood, if you
want more, look in Sitis, and Imbecillitas stomachi; I have oftentimes stopped
vomiting with Aquamenthae and syrrup. cidoniorum, Mixtura.
of either one ounce mixed together.

CHAP. XXXIV.
CHOLERICA PASSIO, is an immoderate perturbation of the stomach, caused by
vomits upwards and downwards, the Latins call it Cholerici.

It is caused through much crudity and rawnesse of the stomach, choler, Causa.
and sharp humors, with an ill and corrupt digestion.

For the sign, Signa.
there is pricking and biting about the stomach, and withal vomiting, and a
flux of the belly; it is called the chollerick passion in English: there do
oftentimes accomcompany this disease, cold sweats, a swift pulse, frequent,
little, and short, with Syncope.

If children be taken with this disease, Curatio.
sleep profits much, in old men for the most part deadly; the juice and
syrrup of Quinces, with syrrup of Roses and Myrtills, is excellent in a hot
cause, as this Recipe following.

Sir. de Rhabarb. and Rosarum. sol. ana.j. The decoction of Seen, as much as
suffices to make an Apozem, give the one half over night, and the other half

broth made with cooling herbs, Victus ratio.
as sorrel borage, and burnit, Endive, succory, sorrel possets, and lemmond
possets, barley water, and cooling juleps are very good, Julepus.
made with the waters of Endive, purslaine, sorrel, and syrrups of the same.

as much as sufficieth to make a potion, or you may give stomachal pills; if
their body be not able to bear a strong purge: but these vomitings many times
in a hot cause, syrrups or juyces of quinces, and syrrup of Myrtils: in a cold
cause the syrrup of mints, and cordial mint water, is sometimes sufficient;
Lastly, this emplaster following is excellent, to be applied either to the
stomach or belly.. Olei cotoneorum, myrthini, ana.ij. Emplastrct. Weckerus.

CHAP. XXXV.
IMBECILLITAS JECINORIS is caused of a distemper, either hot, cold, moist,
Causa.
or dry.

1. Signa.
A hot distemper does burn up as well the humors which were before in the
liver, as also those humors which are carried to the liver, by the veins
Mesenterii, and there is stinking gross choler, avoided by the belly, and is
abundantly colored; also a fever vexes him, he abhors meat, and many times
casts up choler, with a sore thirstinesse, the urine high, and a swift pulse.

2. In a cold distemper, it does make the phlegmatic and raw humor, which is
already contained in the liver, tough and hard to be moved, and the humors
that be carried to the liver, it leaves them half digested; this indureth long,
and the belly flows certain days abundantly, but less stinking, and not so
much in quantity; and is like putrefact blood curded, but indeed for the most
part you shall find it, as it were a certain slime, and dregs of grossblood,
coming nigh to melancholy: many times there appears a faint fever, the face
does not fall, and there is a greater appetite of meats.

3. A dry distemper, does make the humors drier and thicker, and less in
quantity than the former, but thirsty.

4. A moist distemper make the humors more thin and watery, and they are less
troubled with thirst, therefore they which have a weak faculty of the liver,
are called Hepatici.

1. Curatio. Venae-sectio
In a hot cause, if there be not great aridity, and dryness, with exceeding
heat, open the liver vein of the right arm, otherwise not; for blood is a
bridle, Ceratum. Victus ratio.
and temperator of choler: in all heat of the liver, Ceratum santalinum, is
good, Use broth wherein is boiled Lettice, Endive, and Succory; no flesh
except it be chickens, partridg, birds of mountains, or a little veal; no
wine, except the stomach be weak, then let it be very thin, and anoint the
stomach, but especially the region of the heart, Oleum. with Oleum Rosarum aut
violarum.
If he be in a pining condition, make him gellies, and put in red saunders, and
let him take of this julep following.. Julepus.
Syrrupus Endiviae. Acetosae, Portulacae, Rosarum Rub. and violarum ana.j.

thereof.

2. In a cold cause or distemper, take savory Hysop, sage, and parsley in his
broth, let his meat be dressed with aromatic things, as Cinnamon, Cloves, etc.
Also wine is good, Vinum. Decoctio.
especially clarret, providing they avoid idleness, also the decoction that is
set down in Paralysis is good, adding, wormwood, calamint, anise, fennel, and
let the one half be wine; sometimes drink it with syrrup of wormwod, and
agrimony, use hot oils, as nard, wormwood, cammomel, cinnamon, cloves, and
spicknard, Oleum.
also for the poorer sort, use wormwood beer, and wormwood wine.

3. In a moist distemper, use a drying diet, Diacurcue ma.
and provoke sweat; Diacurcuma is good, so is syrrup of wormwood.

4. In a dry distemper, use a moystning diet, also mix strengthening things
with your moist things, one dragme of wolves liver in powder, and ministered in

is a disease whereas one thinks himself (in the night) to be oppressed with
a great weight, believing that something comes upon him, and thinks that he
is strangled.

It is often times caused of excess of drinking, Causa.

vapors, gross and cold, filling the ventricles of the brain, and letting the
faculties of the brain to be dispersed by the sinews.

They that have this disease can scarce move, Signa.
being astonished, and as it were held by something that does violently invade
them; the voice is suppressed, some do believe (though vainly) that they hear
the thing that does oppress them; now at the last with much trouble, the
vapors being attenuate, and driven away, and the passage of the spirits being
opened, the sick is by and by raised to his perfect senses.

If this disease continue, Signa. Prognostica. Curatio.

EMPYEMA, (...). Causa.
which signifies a mattery spitting, it is caused when an impostume, or botch
being in the upper skin, girding the ribs, or else in some other skin of the
breast is broken all at once, and shed into the empty place of the breast, which
is between the lungs and the upper skin, it is fometimes caused through
bursting out of blood, sometimes through a flux of the head, and other upper
parts falling thither, which is wont often to change into the squinsie.

There is felt heaviness in the bottom of the breast, a strong and dry cough,
Signa.
without pain in the beginning, there chance to them fevers, faint, inordinate,
and hard to be judged, when the impostume draws now to a rupture, then the
fever is more vehement with quaking, and they are troubled in their speech; the
matter that comes out is sometime clear, sometimes thick, and dreggy, and
sometimes flows upward into the void place of the breast; and these be most
perilous, sometimes they flow downwards to the paunch, bowels, and bladder,
such always labor of the fever Hectic. Curatio. Victus ratio.


Let them use meats of good juice, broth of cocks, and flesh of hens, chickens,
and birds of mountains, let his drink be Aqua mulsa, and thin white wine, it
must be speedily looked to, or else the matter gathered together will cause the
Ptisick, or an ulceration of the lungs, therefore a drink made with liquoress,
figs, and aniseeds, is good to rot and void the matter; if it creep into the
belly, minister mollifications, if to the bladder, such things as provoke
urine; if it comes out by a cough, then give ptisan mixed with good honey; you
shall have plentiful remedies in the Chapter of the Ptisick, and in Astma, and

is nothing else but great and vehement famine, or hunger.

It is caused through coldness of the stomach, want, and weakness of
strength, Causa.
long journies (especially when there is snow) cause this disease.

In the beginning there is felt much hunger, Signa.
yet does not long endure, for afterward the patients heart fails him, with
coldness of the extreme parts, and want of spirit and breath. Curatio.


If this trouble happen in a journey without a fever, Vinum.
comfort them with bread infused in odoriferous wine burnt with cinnamon, if he
be very faint, it is the best thing to let them smell to penny-royall; new
bread holden to the nose helps much, so does the savor of roasted meat, well
seasoned with salt; but above all, sweet odours, and compel them to eat. Spec.

DIARRHAEA; (...).
is a great and copious flux of the womb, without exulceration and
inflammation.

It is caused through weakness of the instruments that do serve to digestion;
Causa.
also through abundance of corrupted meat, and nourishment that is moist and
viscous, moreover gnawing and biting of those things that are contained in the
belly: also flowing of some humors from above the belly, and weakness of the
retentive virtue may be the cause.

1. Signa.
Diarrhaea be caused through weakness of the Instruments that serve for
digestion, as the stomach, bowels, liver, and spleen, seek the signs out of
their own proper Chapters, as in Imbecillitas stomachi, and Iecivoris.

2. If through weakness of the virtue retentive, seek the signs in the
Chapters above.

3. If through much devouring of evil meats, and drinks, it is known by the
Patients words.

4. If it be caused through Choleric humors, the excrements are yellow color,
there is felt gnawing and heat whilst they are casting out; there is also felt
bitterness of the mouth, thirst, a thin state of the body, and other tokens
signifying choler.

5. If phlegmatic humors be the cause, all those forementioned signs are
contrary.

6. If humors flow from the head to the belly, the egestious will appear
frothy, and the temperature of the brain will be very moist.

7. If through fullness of the body, it is easily known.

1. Curatio.
If it be caused through weakness of the instruments, you shall find remedy in
the Chapter of Imbecill stomach.

2. If through the fullness, or other causes, and nature labor to help it self,
you must suffer it a while; for being stopped, the vicious humors are carried
upwards, and do cause pain in the head, a frenzy, lethargy, or impostumation
behind the ears: but if it shall continue long, casting forth, not only
superfluities, but melting as it were the state of the body, and consuming the
strength, then labor to stop it.

3. If through chollerick humors, Apozema.
an Apozem of the infusion of Rhubarb is much praised, at the first taking of
this disease, Cassia and Manna is good, then this julep following.. Aqua

Mirti. and cons. oxiacanthae ana.j. Make a julep, and take steel gadds red
hot, Chalybs.
quench them in milk, scum it, and drink, it is much commended, if there be no
fever; if there be, power a fourth part of water to the milk, and boil it
until half be consumed.

4. If chollar be in the bowels, Clyster. Electuarium.
give a clyster of the decoction of French barley, with oil of Roses or the
like, then make an Electuary with conserve of Roses, Diatrion Santalon. and
Syrrup. Mirt. For the poorer sort take bolearmenia, (instead of the Diatrion
sant.) Aliud.
with the conserve of Roses, and Sir. Lujulae, or Myrtills.

5. If it be caused of phlegmatic humors, that be gross and tough, minister
the infusion of Agarick, with Mirabol. Emblici, or use clysters made with the
decoction of Centory, and oil of Rue; Cataplasma.
after that, apply the poultis (outwardly upon the stomach) which you shall
find in the Chapter of Nausea, page the 67. only instead of vinegar use
clarret, or red-wine, and a little cinnamon; and if he be over-greedy of meat,
let him use a spare diet.

6. If it be caused through weakness of the virtue retentive, bathe the body
with oil of of Myrtills, sour mulberries dried in the Sun, and beaten to
powder, Pulvis.
and drunk in some binding syrrup, do marvellously stop: This Lohoch following
is good.. Cons. Ros. Rub.. ss. Diarrhod. Abb. Diamoron, Lohoch.

plantin water, (leaving out the conserve, and syrrup) you may make Lozenges,
Rice-broath is good.

7. If Diarrhaea comes through Rheumatick matter, see the Chapter of Catarrhus.

CHAP. XL.
LIENTERIA, is a certain lightness, (...).
or smoothness of the bowels, even like as there chances a scarre on the
outside of the body: in this disease the bowels do not hold the meat, but let
it slide away before it be changed, or perfectly digested, in the same likeness
that it was eaten.

It is caused oftentimes through a grievous flux, Dysenteria (by name) going
before, Causa.
which causes deep exulceration of the bowels, and consequently scarres; now
the mouths of the veins which draw nourishment from the bowels being
obstructed, and the bowels being become smooth, will not suffer meats to be
distributed, but let them slide out before they be altered, this disease is
many times caused through debility of the virtue retentive in the stomach: also
sometimes when dropsy water is avoided by the belly, this flux Lienteria
follows.

Whatsoever causes this flux, Signa.
the sick do taste or feel no meat, there is an evil plight of the body, their
excrements are pale, cruid, raw, whitish, unequal, and very watery, not mixed
with blood, or choler, he feels a burning all over the sides, loathing of
meat; if sour belchings do happen, it is a good sign the meats abide some
while in the stomach.

For the cure let him be sparing of drink, Curatio.
for much is forbidden in all fluxes.

1. If it be engendered through weakness of the virtue of the stomach, search
the cure in its proper Chapter, as in Imbecill. Stomachi Diarrhaea, and the
following Chapter; But to be short, minister those things that restrain and
strengthen the stomach and bowels; as syrrup of wormwood, mints, and wormwood
wine, Oleum.
is good; use outwardly oil of mastick, wormwood, mints, and myrtills, make
the poultis that is set down in the former Chapter, and strew on the powder of
Cinnamon, Cloves, Galingale, Baulaustia, or red Roses.

2. Those that have a scarre, the eating of sharp things are profitable, for
that it causes a Refrication, and rubbing upon the scarre, it renueth natural
heat, therefore use scouring things with restrictive medicines, with the meat
use vergis, the juice of sour pomegranates, lemonds, or the syrrup of the
same, or of unripe grapes; also a clyster of the decoction of Balaustia,
Clyster.
sloes, French pruines, unripe grapes, and such like: some Authors do much
commend vinegar, to receive the fume upon hot tile stones, others the fume of
Frankincense, Laud paracel.
and Amber, to be an excellent thing, but in all fluxes, Laudanum paracel.
judicially administered two or three grains, is said to be a most sure help:

Also for the same purpose, Actuarius his Diacodion is wondrous proper, the
making of which you shall find in Weckerus his antidotary, lib. 2. p. 786.

CHAP. XLI.
DYSENTERIA, (...).
is an exulceration of the bowels, being tormented, and fretted very much with
pain, some reckon four kinds of Dysenteria.

1. The first is when blood is sent forth by circuit, through some part of the
body being cut off: or through some exercise of the former life, let pass for
a time.

2. The second is when watery blood, like the water wherein new killed flesh
have been washed, or soaked, (which chances through weakness of the liver) is
sent forth.

3. The third is, when there is sent forth an humor, more shining and blacker,
than that which is natural, being commixt of blood, and Melancholy.

4. The fourth kind in which by little and little, and between whiles is cast
out pure blood, yet sometimes clodded, and shavings of the bowels comes out
with pure blood, and many times thick dung, sprinkled with drops of blood; of
this fourth kind I shall treat at this time, and let pass the other three.

The cause of this last kind is through exulceration of the bowels, Causa.
caused many times through outward cold, heat, and moystnesse, sometimes
through pernicious medicines, as scammomy, eating of fruit, or sharp, and sour
meats, crudity, and rawness, or through sharp and gnawing humors, flowing
from the whole body to the belly, or engendered in the belly it self; and this
does sometimes begin after Tenasmus; the excrements are choleric, diverse, and
fatty, because the fat, that cleaves within the bowels, is melted, so that
when the Superficies of the bowels are bare, and the exulceration abiding about
it, then the excrements be dreggy, and bloody, but when the ulcer is pierced
deeper, then there is sent forth filthiness, having as it were little pieces
of parchment commixed with it, so that if it be not stopped, it eats the
places nigh unto it, and sends forth such excrements, as are wont to run
from dead bodies.

1. Signa.
When the small guts are exulcerate, there is pain about the Navill, the
excrements are chollerick, the patient feels grief, and frettings, and
gnawings, so that the patient is not far from fainting; they are not thirsty,
and feverous, the excrements are cruid and raw, and the bowel Jejunium is
exulcerate sometimes, though seldom; and sometimes they vomit, and abhor
meats.

2. But if the exulceration be engendered in the great bowels, there the ordour
is pure, and much heaped together, coming out with windiness, and frothinesse;
mixed with fatness, blood swimming aloft, the knowledge of this greatly
helps to the cure.

1. Curatio.
If the exulceration be in the upper or small bowels, you must cure it by
medicines given at the mouth. If in the great or lower bowels, it must be done
by clysters, be the cause what it will, endeavor to procure rest, and give
them little meat; milk is good, and Rice with milk, if there be no fever,
marmalad of Quinces, Plantin boiled in the juice of French pruins, with
balaustia, no flesh, except Birds, or Rabbits, etc. Chalybs.
steel quenched in running-water is good. If the stomach be weak give
restringent wine not very old, amongst syrrups take plantin, knotgrasse,
purslain, sharp mulberries, Balaustia, Frankincense, Terra lemnia, and grape
curnels, all these restrain: the tallow of goats, swine, geese, and hens, these
assuage the acrimony, which should be first looked to, that thereby the patient
may be eased: Hares creem, Hartshorn burnt, the shells of Crabs, running
water, and sage, these dry up. This clyster following is good for Dysenteria,
though the cause rests in the great bowels, as well as in the small, and
better., Fol. Ros. Rub. Plantag. Centinodium, Clyster.

now though this Clyster be set down at large, yet you may direct one for a poor
body, not so costly, with some of the Engredients: This clyster is most proper
for the Dysenteria, in the great bowels.

2. If the exulceration be in the small bowels, then give unto them such things
as you shall find proper in Diarrhaea, use syrrup of dried Roses, Myrtils, and
Quinces, apply this Cerate outwardly.. Ceratum.

and of others suspected, but oil of vitrial is much commended in plantin
water, the distilled water of the spawn of frogs is an excellent Remedy,
Aqsperm. ranarum.
if it be well made; if the patient be weak, make him broth with chickins,
with a little cinnamon.

1. Clyster.
If there be deep excoriation, make a clyster with the decoction of brann, and.
ij. of deer suet, clysters of milk is good, for either of them.

2. Purgatio.
If it happens through contagion of Air, at the first give a strong potion of
Rhubarb, infused in plant in water, with a little cinnamon, and then a little
treakle or methridate, in cinnamon or treakle water, is excellent. But after
purging, endeavor next to procure rest, either with Laudanum, or something
else, and then give a scruple of treakle, or methridate, in etc. Theriaca
mithridat.
as aforesaid, forbear bleeding, or purging, except with Rhubarb, many have
been cured with Hartshorn burnt, others take hard bones of Beef, or Pork,
calcined, or burned until they be white, made into powder, and so drunk in
ordinary drinks continually, with some few drops of cinnamon water, and cinnamon
and nutmegs in powder, are good. This unguent following is wondrous proper to

TENASMVS, is a continual desire to go to stool, (...)
with extension and straining out of the right gut, called Intestivum rectum,
being stopped, avoiding nothing except it be a little blood, or filthy matter,
like snivel, or snot.

1. Causa.
The cause is sometimes through outward cold.

2. Sometimes through sharp chollerick humors.

3. Sometimes through salt phlegm.

4. Sometime through impostumation.

5. Sometimes through inflammation engendered in the straight gut.

6. Sometimes the blind gut is stopped with hard dung.

1. Signa.
The sign is as various: if it be caused of cold, it is known by the tale of
the sick, whether he has set on any cold stone, etc.

2. If chollerick, it is known by the color of the humors, or excrements that
comes out.

3. If an impostumation, botch, or bile, there is mattery corruption flowing
forth, and he feels a pricking in the fundament.

4. Inflammation causes swelling in the right bowell, with grievous pain,
together with a fever.

5. If a phlegmatic humor, it is also known by the color of the humors, or
excrements.

6. If abundance of dung, it causes distension, and streching out about the
bottom of the belly.

1. Curatio.
The cure is diverse, according to the diversity of causes: if it be caused of
cold, use hot oils, Clyster.
as of Lillies, and Rue, administer clysters made with mints, origan,
calamints, cammomel, sothernwood, aniseed, and sennel-seed, adding oils of
dill, cammomel, or lillies.

2. If through chollerick humors remaining in the bowels, and fundament, you
must cast in this clensing clyster.. Decoct. Hord. lb. ij. Mel. Rosarum.j. ol.
Clyster.
Rosarum.iij. Sugar Roset..i.ss. two yelkes of eggs, make a clyster, eschew
all sharp things and let things be used that be cold and moist, which do stop
and temperate, the sharpness of choler.

3. If it be caused of phlegmatic humors, it shall be cured like as that which
is caused of cold: only commix with the the clyster aforesaid in a cold cause,
such medicines as purge phlegm, Benedict. laxativa.
as Diaphaenicon, aut Benedict. laxativa.

4. If of inflammation, Clyster.
then I would have you to take this clyster of the liquor of the decoction of
plantin,.5. oil of Roses.ij. the white of one egg, make a clyster; outwardly
use oil of Myrtills, and when there is need of suppuration, use fenegreek, and
roots of Althaea, boiled and injected, or fomented.

5. If through an ulcer, impostume or botch, look into Dysaenteria, for many
times Tenasmus follows that grievous flux; Fumigatio.
use a fume of frankincense, and pitch, which is said to help suddenly, also
use cooling oils, or clysters aforesaid. If the pain be intolerable, procure
rest with ungentum populi cum opio. Vnguentu^.
Adding two or three drops of oil of nutmegs, or else minister Laudanum.

6. If through abundance of dung, use gentle clysters, as little in quantity as
may be. Take Mallows, Althaea, Mercury, Beets, Violet leaves, Clyster.
of either M.j. fenegreek, and Linseed, ana. ss. boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water, strain it, and add Cassia. i. ss. common oil.iij. salt

CHAP. XLIII.
COLLICA PASSIO, (...).
has his name of a gut called Colon, it is a disease accompanied with grievous
pain, it happens very often, when excrements are retained beyond custom.

It is caused many ways, Causa.
as through choleric humors, sometimes through humors in the stomach,
gathering wind from the liver, and milt, or from the reins of such as have the
stone, or from an impostume in the womb, sometimes from all the parts in man's
body, as in fevers, where the humors are expelled from the veins to the guts,
so that either it may proceed from hot and dry, or cold, and dry
distemperatures, but never of moist: there are many causes, but I shall treat
but of these four especially that follow.

1. Sometimes it is engendered through gross and phlegmatic humors, fallen down
within the skin of the gut Colon.

2. Sometimes through windiness, which have no room to get out.

3. Also it is caused through inflammation of the gross and thick gut, nexing,
and stretching out.

4. Lastly, through sharp and gnawing humors, which afflict the aforesaid
bowell, vehemently.

1. They that have it engendered of a gross, Signa.
and phlegmatic humor, they be nexed aloft, all over their Abdomen, that is,
the place which is under the mouth of the stomach, especially they are grieved,
where the gut Colon lies, for the pain is as though it is brayed, or bored
with a bodkin, having a disposition to vomit, with belchings and costivenesse.

2. If it be caused of windiness, they feel extension, and stretching forth.

3. If through inflammation, there is felt inward burning, and heat, with no
small fever, and costivenesse, with retention of urine, troubled with thirst,
vomiting of choler, without ceasing; and this is most grievous, and threatens
Iliaca passio.

4. If of sharp humors there is thirst, and watching, small fevers, the urine
sharp, and choleric humors are sometimes thrown out; going to stool, eases
the torment, hot drinks do the same, but beware of cold drink.

1. Curatio.
When gross and clammy humors do cause the chollick, there diet must be
extenuate, flesh of birds, hens, Partridg, Turtles, black-birds, and doves, the
flesh of calves, beware of pulse, Victus ratio.
for pot herbs use fennel, Apium, Asperage, let his food be easy of digestion,
ingendring good juice, and eschew fullness, Vinum.
he may drink wine, (a little) thin, shining, of mean age, temperately allayed,
yet beware of medicines, heating vehemently, Clyster.
Clysters made with Rue, Cammomel, Dill, Althaea, mellilot, with the oils
thereof, also cummin, and fenegreek, Mercury, Mallows, and if need be
hierapicra, benedicta lax, Mell Rosarum; If the patient can vomit before supper
it helps much, some do commend a vomit after a clyster to be exceeding good,
Vomitus.
and to sit in the decoction of Althaea, peniroyal, Decoctio.
laurel leaves, fenegreek, cammomel, Motherwort, dill, etc: wine wherein
wormwood is infused, is much commended, also Castoreum one dram at a time,
Castoreum.
continually drunk in Aqua mulsa, destroys the disease utterly.

2. Clyster.
If it be caused through windiness, then this clyster, take Sothernwood,
origan, peniroyal, calamint, cammomel, ana M. j. Rue, wild mints, ana M. ss.
seeds of Annise, fennel, carawayes, commin, dill, ana. ij. boil them in a
sufficient quantity of water, strain it, and add Hierapicra, benedict, lax,
ana. ss. castoreum. j. powder of Diacuminum. ij. oils of rue, and dill, ana.
i. ss. common salt. i. ss. make a clyster, there may be added thereto the
confection of bay berries, which is effectual to drive away windiness,
Cataplaf.
also a poultis outwardly of wormwood, mint, bay berries, cinnamon, pepper, and
such like; beware of any thing that ingenders windiness.

3. Venae sectio
If it be caused through inflammation of the bowels, open a vein in the arm,
if there be suppression of urine, cut the vein in the Ankle, you may use some
of the aforesaid, and following remedies, except hot and sharp things, and
vehement purges, rather use clysters easing pain.

4. If it be caused of sharp and gnawing humors, give such things as wash,
without causing mordacity, and gnawing, as broth of ptisan, or the decoction
of fenegreek, linseed, cammomel, Althaa, fresh Goose-grease, Clyster.
Hensgrease, and oil of Roses, compound a clyster, or take violet leaves,

CHAP. XLIV.
ILIACA PASSIO, (...)
is a most painful disease, proceeding from obstructions of the small guts,
which suffers nothing to pass downwards, but their excrements many times
issue out at their mouths; it differs from the chollick in the situation, in
that it has its place and being in the small guts, and the chollick in the
great guts; this disease takes its name from a gut called Ilion.

It is caused sometimes of crudity of meats, Causae.
especially fat, which commonly ingenders obstructions in the small guts or
Ilion; sometimes of stripes in places where the small guts lie, or through
vehement cold, restraining the excrements, or through abundant eating, but
especially drinking of cold things in a sweat, sometimes the bowels with the
dung fall into the cods, and being violently thrust back, is inflamed, or
through drinking of deadly medicines, or through hard dung, impact about the
thin bowell, yet for the most part Iliaca passio is engendered, either of
inflammation, or obstruction, this disease is common to children, but through
the help of natural humidity, they easily escape, but in ancient people it is
dangerous.

They that have Iliaca passio, Signa.
have vehement pain, the thin and small guts are swelled, and stretched out
with overmuch moystness of the stomach, empty belchings, rumbling, and noise
of the bowels; and both wind and dung ^ants evacuation. If the disease wax
greater, (...) avoydeth all upward, voyding sometimes ^^gme, and choler, and a
coldness of the whole body, to some difficulty and hardness of breathing. To
them that shall die, there chances cold sweats, difficulty of making urin, and
the fundament is so close, that it will suffer no small instrument to enter,
and sometime dung is cast up by vomit, also there happens the hicket,
Delirum, and convulsions: their wind and excrements are much stinking; these be
deadly signs.

For the cure it must be performed in children, Curatio.
with foments, and clysters, as in the chollick, but in the aged otherwise.

1. Vomitus.
If it be caused of crudity and fullness, provoke vomit; If the stomach be free
from crudity, Clyster.
administer clysters as this that follows. Take Mercury, Rue, leaves of
Althaeae, Centory, ana M.j. Hysope, calamint, wormwood, ana M.i.ss. Root of
Althaeae,.j. Root of wild cowcumber,.i.ss. seeds of flax, and fenegreek,

i. ss. common salt. j. make a clyster, you may foment with oils of Rue, and
Dill: after a clyster, if need be purge, Oleum.
a vomit is much commended.

2. If it happen through some venomous or poisonous medicine, give them warm
water to drink, after that hot oil to drink, or fat broth, that they may
vomit; after that, Theriaca.
give him Theriaca, dissolved in wine; if it be a corroding medicine, milk is
commended.

3. If through inflammation, begin with phlebotomy, cast in cooling clysters,
made with mallows, linseed, fenegreek, with oil, and butter.

4. If through falling of the bowels into the cods, labor presently, (the
patient lying upright) to thrust back the bowels, and keep them up without
violence, and make a trusse. Note that Stircus Lupinum, is a remedy in Iliaca
passio, Stircus Lupinum;
as Album Graecum is in Augna. Lastly, if the pain be violent, use
fomentations; and labor to procure rest.

CHAP. XLV.
VERMES, There be three kinds of them; The first round and long, Teretes. The
second be broad, Teretes.
called therefore Lati: Lati. Ascarides.
the third is called Ascarides: The first kind be round, and a hand breadth in
length, and sometimes longer, they be comoner than the other, and they are
often in the slender and small guts, and they go into the stomach, and
therefore often voyded by the mouth, and often some out at their nostrils, and
this kind is peculiar to infants, children, boys, and girls.

2. Plinius.
The second be broad long, and of incredible bigness, as Pliny witnesses,
lib. 2. cap. 33. sometimes they are seen three hundred foot long, Paulus.
Aetius.
Paulus, and Aetius, witnesses they are nothing else but a permutation of the
thin films going about the small guts within; into a certain living body that
will move and stir.

3. The third kind be thin, short and small, and found most commonly in the
right gut, and in the end of the fundament.

All these be engendered of cruid, Causae.
raw, gross, and phlegmatic matter, and through a kind of rottenness in
children, especially in great eaters.

1. Signa.
They that have Teretes, do feel incredible gnawing of the bowels and stomach:
with thin and small coughs, provoking to vomit (often times) with dryness, in
some yelking, with movings of the stomach, and do arise up unreasonably: many
do walk and leap up with noise, and crying out, and fall asleep again, some put
forth their tongue, and shut their mouth, and be quiet, and keep a silence, but
do fret and fume with them that raise them; because they cannot watch, they are
so weak: some have their eyes sprinkled with blood, and their pulse unequal,
obscure; failing, and running back; to many there chances loss of appetite,
children, while they sleep chew their tongue, and also do fast join their
mouth, as though they sucked meat: to some gnashing of teeth, others refuse
meat, for if compelled to eat, they can scarce swallow it, or else vomit it up
again. In many the belly throws out corrupt meats, being puffed up as it were
a tympany: The rest of the body consume without fasting, or purging, going
before: sometimes the face is red about the Halles of the cheeks: but it
turns again into a swarthy color: some speak foolish things in their sleep,
like frantic persons; some change the place they lie down on, tumbling from
one place to another. And a fever is increased without order, with vehement
coldness of the extreme parts, having fits the third or fourth day without
order: but all these signs must not be looked for in every body, but the
chiefest of them.

2. Broad worms bring continual gnawing of the stomach, and an impotent and
incorrigible appetite to meat; for being in the guts, they devour the meat, so
that they have need of more straightway, or else the bowels are gnawne: there
follows slenderness and weakness of body, with inequality. The infallible
sign is, if certain things like coucumber-seeds, be avoided out with the
excrements.

3. Ascarides do raise vehement itch in the fundament, and provoke the patient
to go to school continually, and they that be troubled with this disease, for
the most part are better after egestion, and easing themselves.

For the cure, Curatio.
eschew all things that engender phlegmatic humors, but they must be fed, and
not hunger: Victus ratio.
no hot things if there be a fever, but be diligent to get the worms out of the
body, or else they will gnaw until they die; therefore first kill them, and
then drive them out; these symples following are good (if there be no fever, if
there be, use them outwardly or inwardly with some thing that is of a cooling
quality) wormwood, Seryphium, a kind of wormwood growing in the Sea,
Sothernwood, Callamint, Horehound, Dittanie, Hysope, Rue, leaves of Persica,
Coriander seeds, Hartshorn, Lupines, Mints, Peniroyal, Origan, Centory, Fern,
Gentian, Aristolochia rotunda, Garlic, seed of Coleworts, and roots of Ennula
campana; but Aloes is most commended, so is wormseed; of all these you may make
either powders, decoctions, or poultices, also Pulvis contra lumbricos is good,
Palvis.
but remember to give your powders with milk, honey, or Syrrup of liquoris,
because it allureth the worms: outwardly you may use Bulls gall, or the oils
of some of the forementioned symples; Emplastru^,
and a plaster of honey and Aloes is good, also Rue and wormseed boiled in
white wind vinegar, Decoctio.

gall, and apply it a little above the Navill: sometimes syrrup of Rhubarb is
sufficient. Hierapicra, Pilulae.

and bringing out worms: If there be a flux joined, search the Chapters of
fluxes, but remember to add, with restrictive things, those things that do
kill worms, but labor to strengthen the stomach.

The worm called Ascarides, in children that be infants; they must be brought
out with Suppos: made with honey and salt, or such like: Suppositoria. Clyster.
in them that be elder give clysters with some of the symples abovesaid, adding
oils of the same; but first take a piece of old powdered flesh, fashion it like
a suppository, fit for the fundament, Suppositor.
and thrust it into the Tuel, applying a ligament or band; let it alone awhile,
and then draw it out with the worms that stick on it: after this the clyster,
and then anoint the straight gut or fundament with Acatia, Hypocischidos,

It is caused of vapors gross, and windiness, hard to digest; sometimes of
viscous humors in the ends of the veins, springing from the flat part of the
liver.

1. Signa.
If gross and vaporous windiness wanting free passage, does engender
obstruction, there arises heaviness and grief about the right side, and a
feeling of distention, and stretching out.

2. If through viscous humors, there is heaviness, pain, easy, and sometimes
vehement with a fever, and sometime without, especially when the patient uses
vehement moving after meat, when the body is stopped, there is pricking and

HEPATIS INFLAMMATIO there is, Causa.
as well as in other members, and through the same causes that they be
ingengred of.

If the liver be vexed with inflammation, S^gna.
there is felt pain and heaviness all over the right side, with swelling in
the place; he has a sharp fever, a small and dry cough, insatiable thirst,
abhorring of meats, difficulty of breathing, the tongue is first red, and after
that black, vomiting pure choler; the body is costive, the color of the body
is changed like Icterus: they have the hicket. In their fit they rave, voyding
forth sharp urine: The inflammation that chances through causes in the crooked
and hollow parts of the liver, have the foregoing symptoms, but if engendered in
the outward and round part of the liver, it causes greater pain in drawing
breath, and a greater cough than the other: And sometime the Muscles leaning
upon the liver be inflamed, causing the skin round about to be stretched with
swelling, sometimes a swelling fashioned like the liver, which is a true sign

In the beginning open the liver vein, Curatio. Venae sectio
which has society with vena causa, draw out a large quantity, Clyster.
if nothing forbid: the next intention must be to administer a cooling clyster:
foment with oil of Quinces, and Roses, putting to it odoriferous wine: Ceratum.
Ceratum Santalinum, is good: remember that restrictive things do exceed those
that mollifle and loosen when the heat is vehement: on the contrary, when it
decreases, let those that mollify exceed the other: beware you do not apply
things cold, but warm them a little: Fomentatio.
foment with the decoction of wormwood, mellilot, red roses, cammomel, dill,

second parsley, also barley broth is good.

If the inflammation change to suppuration, the aforesaid signs will increase,

the spleen is nexed with inflammation, as often as hot blood flows thither

It is known by heaviness, Signa.
and swelling of the left side, which will not give place to the feeling; also
it is known by pain, stretching out of the place, by burning heat, and fevers:
and if abundance of humors rush in thither, it is known by the greatness, and
swiftness of the ingendring the inflammation.

For the diet look, Curatio.

LIENIS SCIRRHVS, Inflammation of the spleen not rightly cured, draws
together a hard swelling of the spleen: Causa.
The cause is a certain humor cleaving stubbornly to the spleen; but it is
when hardness ingendreth without inflammation, in overmuch swelling.

It is easily known by touching, Signa.
of what cause soever it be.

His diet must be easy of digestion, Curatio. Victus ratio. Exercitium
he may drink pure wine, being without all restriction: exercise before meat is
excellent, strong potions are good, root of capers are good: Hart's-tongue, the
root and herb of Tamariscus sodden in vinegar or oximel; juice of centory drunk
the decoction of bitter lupines, rue and pepper. Iron often quenched in wine is
a convenient remedy, if a fever quench it in Posca: steel is commended; also
wormwood, Cassia, Chalybs.
Aniseeds, etc. you may make a fomentation with the symples above mentioned:
oil of capers, lillies, and ireos, are good: Vng. Dialthaeae, fenegreek,
linseed, Goose-grease, Hens, and Badgers grease: Gum Ammoviacum, Bdellium, and
Galbanum, being first dissolved in vinegar are good; Opoponax, myrrh, and

CHAP. LI.
OBSTRVCTIO LIENIS: Causa.
It chances not only through weakness of the attractive virtue in the spleen,
but also through stopping of the passage from the liver unto the spleen; after
that naughty blood is distributed over the whole body, it being corrupt, and
inclines to blackness, and sometimes has uncurable ulcers: the causes are the
same with that of Obstructio hepatis.

It is known by heaviness on the left side, Signa.
by the color of the face, difficulty of breathing, and troublesome dreams.

The diet, with plenty of remedies, Curatio.
you shall find in the Chapter of obstruction of the liver; but remember the
spleen requires strong medicines, and has need of preparatives before purging:
the purging medicines you shall find in the former Chapter. Lastly,

ICTERITIA, (...).
is nothing but a shedding of yellow choler, or of melancholy over all the
body: sometimes over the skin, the liver being safe. Causa.
It is caused sometimes through corruption of blood without a fever, or through
biting of venomous beasts, and so the blood is made chollerick: sometimes
through diseases of the spleen, and also weakness of the bladder may be the
cause, or through obstruction and debillity of the vessels, whose mouths are
derived from the gall, to the liver.

When choler burst out to the skin, Signa.
by reason of a good Crisis in fevers, the excrements and urine be of natural
color.

1. If there be heaviness under the right side, it signifies inflammation of
the liver, by whose violence the blood is changed, and sent over all the body:
If no fever, and yet heaviness under the right side, white excrements are
avoided in them, judge obstruction in the passages of the bladder; If such
egestions come forth without heaviness, the attractive virtue from the liver,
or the expulsive virtue which drives out to the bomels is weak, and sometimes
chollerick humors be sent out abundantly with the urine, making the froath as
yellow as saffron.

2. If melancholy be sent to the skin, together with the blood, they be vexed
with sadness, gnawing in the belly, difficulty of breathing, abhorring of meat,
voyding black urine, and dung being costive; but contrary, if yellow choler
causes the Jaundies, indeed the whites of the eyes and face do betoken the
cause: however there is a sluggishness in either, and their veins under the
tongue are swelled.

1. If caused of a good Crisis, Curatio. Oleum.
when the fever is ended, use a moist and extenuating diet; use frictions with
oils of Cammomel, Dill, etc.

2. If through biting of a venomous beast, you must search the cure in some
other Chapter following; the cure is much like that of the biting of a mad dog.

3. If through distemper or inflammation of the liver, look into the proper
Chapters.

4. If through obstruction of the bladder, Venae-sectio
use blood-letting, and purging; If the liver be affected, open the Basiltea:
If the spleen, cut the vein in the left arm; Clyster.
make clysters with Endive, Hore-hound, Agrimony, Maiden-haire, Wormwood, seeds
of Anise, fennel, parsley, sperage the roots of liqueris, Apium, and fennel,
oils of Dill, Cassia, hiera picra, Electuarium e succo rosarum: Purgatio.
purgations are best, providing you use clysters first, and broth, with some
of the symples above said, Vinum.

good: you may pick many remedies out of the foregoing words in this Chapter:
rosemary boiled in the former oils to bathe with, is good. Also Chalybs

CACHEXIA, (...).
is an evil disposition of body, being spread abroad with weariness, and all
over, the flesh is loose, and waxes soft.

For the most part it is caused of a long sickness, Causa.
also it follows when some intraile is hardened; especially, the hardness of
the liver, and spleen; also in a continual Dysenteria, and the disease called
Caliacus morbus; or through letting of some accustomed excretion.

The whole body is made whitish and weak, Signa.
his legs being scarce able to bear him; in the beginning appetite remains,
but afterward follows abhorring of meat: their breathing seldom and weak, the
belly sending out unequal excrements; old men and children are chiefly taken
with this disease, which soon perish through weakness of the vital faculty: If
it continue long, it turns into the dropsy.

A thin and dry diet is best, wine that is white, Curatio. Victus ra. tio.
thin and odoriferous is best: If nothing forbid, draw away a little blood at
several times, Exercitiu^.
some commend waters springing from Alum, Saltpeter, and sulpher, a potion of
wormwood is commended; also this powder following: Take nutmegs, mace, saffron,
of either two peniworth, Pulvis.

CHAP. LIVE.
ANASARCA, (...).
is a dropsy causing all the body and flesh to be loose, and wet like a
sponge, spitting when it is pressed: It is called also Lupophlegmatia. (...),
etc.

This kind of dropsy is caused through great coldness of the liver, Causa.
or other parts that be cooled, which brings the liver into the same affect;
as the coldness of the spleen, stomach, Bowels, Lungs, Reins, and Midriffe:
sometimes through unmeasurable voyding of Hemroyds, or Menstruis, or through
their retention: for in all these the liver has no unnatural swelling, and yet
the dropsy follows only through refrigeration of the liver: sometimes it
waxes hard, as is seen in those that drink cold water, and so cool the liver
on heaps, and so the dropsy follows before it be lifted up into a knotty
swelling: sometimes it follows the Gout; loathing of meat; evil state of
body; Jaundies, Caeliacus morbus, and dysenteria.

The whole body swells, Signa.
and is like a dead body: and there is difficulty of breathing, heaviness,
naughty color, and thirst: women are less troubled with the dropsy then men;
but children for the most part are taken with Anasarca; this is least dangerous.

First, if age and strength will suffer, Curatio.
and that there be retention of Hemroyds, or Menstruis, draw blood; Secondly,
purge with Jalap, Jalapum. Cambogiae. Vinum absinth.
or Rhubarb, or Gambogiae, gr. 12. with syrrup of wormwood; also wormwood-wine
and beer is good: purge often, and not too much at once. Elder roots sodden in
wine are good; you shall find remedies enough in obstruction of the liver, you
must provoke urine with broom-flowers, Vinum genistae.
M. ij. in white wind quar. 1. also eringa roots boiled in broth, are good.
Take wormwood, flowers of broom, hysop, tops of red nettles, ana M.j. chop them
small, seeds of annise, fennel, carraway, ana.j. bruise them, mix them, and

wrought, let it stand a week, and then let the patient drink of it often: or
take a dry broom faggot, half a peck of bean hulls, three handfulls of dry
wormwood, Lixivium diuret.

this drink is much commended. Take a pint of the ashes of bean hulls, put it

and stir it all the while until it begin to boil, then set it by one hour
or two, then power it from the ashes through a cloth, and add twelve ounces of
syrrup of Dialthaea, brue it together, and drink a quarter of a pint at a time,

this kind of dropsy swells the whole body, except the upper parts thereof,

is also properly called Hydrops, as well as Anasarca: It is caused of wind and
water, swelling the belly, so that it is stretched out.

The sign is, Signa.
the belly is puffed up higher than that of Ascites, the navil is thrust forth,
if one clap upon it, it gives a noise or sound, and all the other parts of the
body wax lean: this kind is most dangerous.

There diet is like the other, Curatio. Exercitiu^.

thirst does succor the patient. First purge as aforesaid: also clysters,

as in Ascites, only you may add in the boiling, roots of Apium, fennel,

MIGTVS SANGVINIS, is a disease of the reins, through the which thin wheyish
blood is pissed.

It is caused through weakness of the reins, Causa.
being not able to divide the urine, or through amplitude of the reins,
breaking of a vein in the reins, caused through lifting or leaping: sometimes
sharp humors gnaw the reins, flowing from above; also stones in the reins
may be the cause.

If this disease be caused through weakness, Signa.
the blood is wheyish; If through amplitude and largeness of the veins, they
feel no pain: If through breaking of a vein, then the blood comes forth
abundantly: If through gnawing humors, the blood is sent forth by little and
little, with pain vexing the reins: If through a stone, look into its proper
Chapter.

If through weakness of the reins, Curatio.
rest profits, black wine, and restrictive meats, Se sputum sanguinis;
abstain from carnal copulation, Venus.
and diuritick things, hartshorn with wine, or juice of Marygolds is good:
Decoctio.
and Lapis Hematitis: also the decoction of knot-grasse, Sir. de rosis succis,
myrtils, sheeps milk,.iv. mixed with a dram of Bolearmoniack, is only praised;
Bolusarus.
and loafe-sugar with it is not amiss: look into the Chapter of Dysenteria:
also myrtill berries, pomegranet rinds, and Balaustia, give meats of good
juice; sometimes blood is curded in the bladder, then cleanse, but first
dissolve, and then use astringent things, Venae sectio
as aforesaid: If through breaking of a vein, or gnawing of sharp humors, open
a vein in the same side: draw blood by little and little: If there be
inflammation, give cooling things inwardly and outwardly, and avoid sharp and
salt things; If an exulceration be left, look into the same Chapter. If it be
caused by certain circuits, the cure is the same. Aq. sperm. ranarum.
Aq. sperm. ranarum is most excellent, especially if there be inflammation, or
exulceration.

CHAP. LVIII.
INFLAMMATIO RENVM, is an inflammation of the reins, Causa.
caused through corrupt humors and medicines, which ingendreth inflammation of
the reins, and especially continual and vehement ridings; also stripes may be
the cause.

There is a beating pain behind about the joint of the back, Signa.
a little above the bastard ribs: the pain stretching inwards toward the
liver; the right side reine most commonly is vexed, and also the bladder;
privy members, loins, hips, share, and thighs: weakness of limbs: their
extreme parts are cold, as the calves of the legs, and feet: there is
difficulty of making urine: in the beginning it is thin and watery, but
afterward more rubicund, gross, and filthy; a vehement fever, a disposition to
vomit, gnawing of the stomach, and vomiting of choler; this is when it comes
to a Nephritick passion: some are vexed with sweats and faintings, costivenesse
of body, puffings up with wind, and abhorring of meat.

First, his diet must be of a cooling quality, Curatio. Victus ratio.
Phlebotomia.
and thin; Secondly, bleed the Basilica vein on the same side, and after the
Saphena: beware of hot diuretics, and acrid medicines; as scammony: use
outwardly oil of roses, and quinces: cooling clysters with Cassia is very
good, Olcum.
or Cassia inwardly with syrrup of violets: also to drink Aq. sperm. ranarum,
is excellent; Aq. sperm. ranarum.
fasting is hurtful; use diuretics (when the Absessus is broken) as parsley,
and fennel: in clysters, put in oils of roses, violets, and cammomel: If you
want more, look into the Chapters of other inflammations; and the Chapter of
ulcers in the reins; for the which honey and milk is good. This clyster
following is proper in the inflammation of the kidneys.

CALCVLVs RENVM, (...). Causa.
happens oftener to men then to children.

The cause is continual crudity and rawnesse of the stomach, whereby much
gross and earthly humors are heaped up together, which being parched with a
burning fiery heat about the reins, hardneth into a stone: The stones do
sometimes differ in greatness, and figure; color and sharpness; they are black,
whitish, and pale.

They feel grievous pain in the reins, Signa.
even as it were a bodkin thrust through, and yet no swelling without; he have
much ado to turn his back bone: the leg against the diseased rein is astonished,
with abhorring of meat and vomiting: the urine is sometime pissed forth little
in quantity and watery: afterward follows perfect suppression of urine: the
womb avoyddeth nothing, yet makes many proffers to go to the stool; sometimes
blood is avoided through the violence of the stones, especially if they be
sharp: the urine has gravelly residence, when the stone is removed: If the
stones be light and round, they are easily sent forth, but very hard if they be
long and sharp.

For the cure, Curatio.
if thou would first prevent it in any person, prohibit fullness of diet, and
all such things as engender gross and obstructive juice, unleasened and light
bread, gross and new ale, and beer, with new and unsettled wines, and their
exercises must be mean; also let them avoid cheese and milk, and plenty of
flesh: all things that do heat and inflame the liver and kidneys are to be
avoided; let him not stand with his back against the fire, sallets are good,
Victus ratio.
and let his meat be such as yield nourishment; as veal, pullets, chickens,
partridges, doves, larks, and hedge-sparrowes, which is said to be best: Cassia.
Cassia is much commended to be given in a good quantity with syrrup of
violets. Althaeae, maiden-haire, or lymonds; the broth of Althaeae is very
good, with the roots of parsely, fennel, cicers, and the root and seed of
saxifrage, with a little new butter:. Bolus.
Terebinth. venet.j. aut.i.ss. let it be washed in saxifrage water, take it in
wafers, also some of the aforesaid syrrups taken in Aq. sperm. ranarum, cannot
but be excellent, wine of Alkekengie, Vinum.
and also the milk of an ass is much commended by Aetius: also syrrup of
marrich mallows, Aetius. Potius diuret.
taken in parietary, saxifrage, or onion water is good.

Secondly, if the stone be engendered, Phlebotomia.
if nothing forbid it, otherwise take this clyster following.. Malvae,
Althaeae, merculialis, capil. ven. Clyster.
parietariae, ana M.j. nastur. M.i. ss. Sem. Apii, feniculi, ana.iij. Boil
them in a sufficient quantity of water, strein it, and add.i. of Cassia:
Hierapicra,.ss. oils of dill, and cammomel, ana.j. Salicom..ij. f. Enema:
anoint the region of the reins, and loins, with oils of dill, sweet Almonds,
cammomel, and Althea: Cataplas.
A cataplasme made with wheat meal, linseed, fenegreek, lupines, cammomel,
fennel roots, beaten well, and leaves of Althea: If the stone stick fast, or
rest quietly in the kidneys, beware of diuretics: you must first loosen the
reins with foments, and cataplasmes, as aforesaid, and if the stone shall
happen to fall into the bladder, or yard, and so stop the urine; then make use
of a silver Cathetur, and diuretics; the blood of the goat in saxifrage water
is good: Elect. Dulcis.
the ancients use Justinum, or Elect. Dulcis: In the fit you may use clysters,
bathes, unction, Cassia, turpentine, to disturb the stone, use the clyster
abovesaid, to which may be added in the boiling cammomel; roots of parietary,
and aniseed, in the streining honey of of violets.j. venus turpentine. ss. oils
of scorpions,. ij. aut. ss. give syrrup Dialthaea, Sir. alth.
to make the passages slippery in some diuretic water: but this is to be
noted, that if the stone be old or hard, it is in vain to use diuretics, but
if it be sand, and small stones, then use those things aforesaid: If you want
more, look into the Chapter of obstructions, and the three kinds of dropsies;
and also into the Chapter of inflammation of the reins. Hercul. saxonia lib.
3. cap. 41. p. 346.
Hercules Saxonia did frequently use Turpentine, and indeed it is of great
force, not only to cleanse the reins and bladder from slime and gravel, but
also to break the stone.. Bolus. Riverius.

CHAP. LX.
DIABETES, is a disease about the reins, (...)
causing much thirst, and what is drunk, is pissed out again, even as it is
taken.

It is engendered of weakness of the retentive virtue of the reins, Causa.
but the attractive virtue is so strong, that it sucketh the whole body through
immoderate heat, causing a stubborn thirst.

For the sign, they drink continually, Signa.
because the drink they take passes swiftly out again: their bowels seem to
burn, the loins swell up, and the stones and haunches; also gnawing in the
bowels, a wrinkled stomach, the body is lean with consuming.

If there be fullness of blood, bleed in the arm, Curatio. Venae-sectio Victus
ratio.
if nothing forbid it. Let his pot herbs be endive, lettice, and purslain,
pomegranets, also are good: wine that is red and thick, being well allayed with
water is good: Rob. de ribis, or barberries, and juice of knot-grass, syrrup of
Myrtils, and juice of pomegranets, are good: and sweating is very excellent:

VLCERIS RENVM, To an inflammation suppurated, there does succeed a great and
hollow ulcer, which is seldom or never cured; for the continual passage of
urine hinders the consolidation of the ulcer, the cure consists in exsiccation
and drying.

It is caused through breaking of the vein in the reins, Causa.
through sharp and gnawing humors carried into the reins.

There is pain in the loins, Signa.
with heaviness; and matter is commixed with the urine, with lttle pieces of
flesh, or hairs, swimming in it; Hippocrates says, lib. 4. Aphor. 75.

For the cure, barley water is good, Curatio. Phlebotomia.
clysters with Cassia; open a vein if nothing forbid it. Asses milk is good to
scour the ulcer, goats milk to replenish; and incarnate the ulcer: also an
emulction made with sweet Almonds, Emulsic.

watching, and immoderate riding: let his diet be tender and easy of
digestion: for pot herbs, mallows, endive, sorrel, purselain, and lettice;
almond milk is good with honey; also goats whey, and pull. contra gonorr. is
good: If you want more, look into the former Chapter: and also into the Chapter
of ulcers of the bladder. Ex sententia Rhasis nihil melius est in ulceribus

CHAP. LXII.
CALCVLVS VESICAE, stones in the bladder, engender oftener in children, than in
elder folk.

It is caused through gross and thick urine, Causa.
that is carried into the bladder, and setleth there, and through the heat that
is in children, breeds into a stone.

The sign is, Signa.
often itching with handling their members, which are swollen; and making water
continually, being vexed with a strangury, their urine is cruid and waterish,
with white sand: to be certain, the chirurgian may use the Catheter, yet many
have been deceived, because the stone is sometimes wrapped in a coat of clammy
phlegm, so that it yields no sound.

The cure is much alike to the stone in the reins, Curatio.
only if possible use stronger diuretics: excellent authors affirm, Sectio.
the safest way is to cure it by section, and not to strive so long with
saxifrage, because it wastes the spirits; so in the end they are not able to
endure to cure: To inject oil of scorpions is much commended, Ol. Scorpienum.
and to anoint the perinaeum with it: also the powder of the stone that is
found in the gall of an ox, the stones of spunges in powder, and goats blood
being warm, Pulv. sem. gemistae.
and injected with a syringe; also broom-seed in powder, and drunk in
white wind: also this. following is much commended, Infusio.
Take parietary of the wall, and parsley, of either a handful; a good great
red onion; bruise them grossly, then put them into a quart or three pintes of
white wind, let them stand all night, in the morning strain them, and add. 4.
of syrrup of marsh mallows: you may infuse Juniper berries with it: Bacc.
Juniperi.
in this drink will be fit to take any diuretic powder: Raphanus Rusticanus.
also horseradish roots are much commended. Lapis vesicae si confirmatus jam
sit, and ad aliquam magnitudinem jam pervenit, vix alia ratione curari potest,

CHAP. LXIII.
IN FLAMMA VESICAE, Hippocrates
according to Hippocrates, it is for the most part deadly: he says, Si vesica
sit dura, and dolor vexetur, Funestum eoque magis si accedat Febris continua.

They are vexed with a sharp fever, Signa.
they watch, rave, and speak they wot not what; they vomit pure choler, and
they cannot make water, the share is hard with vehement pain, and have a desire
to the stool: as in Tenasmus the order is thin, and sometimes the womb is
costive.

For the cure, bleeding first in the arm, Curatio. Phlebotomiae Clyster.
and afterward in the foot is much commended; but first a cooling clyster to
ease pain: nourish the bladder with oil, wherein is sodden dill, linseed, rue,
or fenegreek, or Althaea; and remember the bladder is full of sinews, and
therefore cold things are hurtful: I conceive that Aq. Mixtura.
sperm. ran. with syrrup dialtheae given warm, must needs be proper: If there
be necessity, use a syringe to draw out the urine, but beware of strong
diuretics, wine, sharp things, and spices: Victus ratio.
and let their diet be thin, and of a cooling quality. In inflammatione vesicae
valent cadem, quae in inflammatione renum. Hartmannus.

CHAP. LXIV.
VLCERIS VESICAE, Causa.
It is caused either through some byle or botch, or swelling, which has been
before, or through some rupture, or gnawing of a flux.

There follows sharp pain of the bladder, Signa.
casting out matter: when the ulcer is foul and filthy, the matter is more
slimy and dreggy: sometimes thin skins like leaves and wool are sent out. If
the ulcer spread abroad and feed deep, the urine is bloody, mattery, and
stinking; also there is difficulty of making water, and rising up of the yard:
if there be pain about the pubes, it shows the ulcer to be in the bladder. If
pain be in the perinaeum, then the ulcer is in the neck of the bladder; If in
the yard, in the uriter: note that ulcers of the bladder be incurable, or at
least very hard to cure, as well because the bladder is sine wey; as also
because the urine which is of nature sharp, does continually touch the ulcers,
and so gnaweth them, that it will not suffer them to conglutinate.

For the cure, Curatio.
if he have a fever, which for the most part is annexed with it; labor to
quench it: milk is much commended, Lac. Clyster.
either drunk or injected: make a clyster with mallows, fenegreek, linseed,
cucumber-seed, etc. when you administer it, let the Patient lie grovelling upon
his knees: Pilulae.
give milk and honey to scour and cleanse the ulcers: pills of Alkakengie with
opium, are commended to ease pain: If you would stop the ulcer from spreading,
use lotions made with bolearmenie, and barley water: Mel. rosa.
Mel rosarum injected with milk is a good cleanser: also Syrrup. rosarum
ciccarum in barley water, to inject is good: what is wanting else, you shall
find remedies enough in the Chapter of Ulceris renum. Yet you may (according to
Fontanus directions) use this injection following, every fourth day.

ISCHVRIA in Greek, (...).
Suppressio urinae in Latin; it is a disease in which the urine of the Patient
is stopped.

It is caused sometimes through weakness of the bladder, Causa.
not being able to thrust out that which is contained in it; it is also caused
of gross humors, or of a stone congealed: sometimes of inflammation, or of
hardness: sometimes by a piece of flesh, or hard knob engendered in the passage
of urine: also of clodded blood: also it is caused of matter sent down to the
reins or liver, or from some other part: also through overlong holding of the
urine: also through the obtuse sense of the bladder.

If stopping of the urine be caused through weakness of the bladder, Signa.
it may be known by their diet, and course of life: If of the stone, you may
know that by the signs in the Chapter of the stone. If through inflammation or
swelling, it is known by pain, fever, and sight; if through a piece of flesh or
knob, is may be known by putting in an instrument; and also if the knob or
boil be broken, there comes out blood, or fragments of flesh: if clotted
blood be the cause, there went before pissing of blood.

1. Curatio.
For the cure, if it be caused through imbecility of the bladder, use heating
things; as pasneps, Apium.
fennel, Apium, sperage, smalledge, etc. after diuretics, the palsy drink
were good.

2. If through gross humors, then use those things that cut and divide,
Decoctio.
as oximel, decoction of hysope, peniroyal, origan, thime, and inject oil of
lillies, etc.

3. If through clodded blood, horseradish roots infused in white wind is good:
Raphanus Rustica.
in drink motherwort, stichas, wormwood, sothernwood, etc.

4. If through inflammation, look into its proper Chapter.

5. If through a piece of flesh, give such things as spread abroad the pipe and
conduit of urine, Siphon.
as in the Chapter of the stone in the reins: also the using of a syringe is
good.

6. If through a dull sense of the bladder, it must be cured, even as the
weakness thereof is cured, only beware of strong diuretics.

7. If through holding their urine too long, stand so as the neck of the
bladder may lean downward, and lay both your hands about the share, and press
it, thrusting out the urine by little and little; and thus he may do, in the
dull sense of the bladder, which some I think do but suppose may be the cause
of Ischuria; some commend clysters of parietary, cammomel, Nasturtium, Clyster.

CHAP. LXVI.
DYSVRIA: (...). Causa.
urinae difficultas, is a disease wherein the urine is hardly pissed: It is
caused through weakness, and coldness of the bladder, sometimes through gross
humors.

Weakness and coldness is known by the patients words; Signa.
and the thinness and whiteness of the urine.

For the cure, Curatio. Diacur. cuma. Oleum. Hercul. Saxon.
Diacurcuma is commended: and to noursh the share with oils of Rue, Dill,
Lillies, and Castoreum: there is plenty of remedies in the other foregoing
Chapter, and thither I refer you. Hercules Saxonia says, that Curatio die
suriae, quando provenit ex humoribus permistis cum urina, habet omnes has
intentiones, ut evacuentur, revellantur, deriventur, contemperentur, and parts
a quibus gener antur, corrigantur.

Si a frigore infirmitas, Hollerius.

CHAP. LXVII.
STRANGVRIA: Stillicidium urinae; (...).
is a disease, whereas the urine distilleth down by drops, or by little and
little, and causes a continual provoking to piss.

It is caused through the sharpness of urine, Causa.
or by exulceration of the bladder, inflammation, or an impostume of the liver
or reins; which being broken, and sending the filth to the bladder, through
the shar pness it causes continual desire to piss: In old men sometimes sharp
humors is the cause.

Sharpness is known when the urine is chollerick, and gnawing about the
bladder: Signa.
An exulceration of the bladder, an impostumation of the liver, and reins, are
known by the signs mentioned in their proper Chapters.

For the cure, Curatio.
in aged persons some commend exceeding much, (as Galen. lib. 5.) Galenus.
Terebinthina. Cassin. Phlebotomia. Clyster.
Turpintine washed in plantine water: If there be sharp humors, with
inflammation, and a young body, bleed and purge with Cassia in whey: but beware
of hot things; and many diuretics: Clisters are good of Mallows, purslain,
violets, cucumber seed, beware of salt things, and sharp things: Lac.
also hot milk indeed is the best thing to assuage pain: to the former clyster
add Althea, water lillies, in the boiling: and Cassia fistula, sugar, oil of
violets and roses in the streining. Lastly, Aq. sperm. ranarum.
Aqua spermat. ranarum, is most excellent. Yet these emulsions following are
much commended by Gorraeus in his Treatise de formul. Gorraeus.

CHAP. LXVIII.
VRINAE INCONTINENTIA, is an involuntary pissing, by reason of the palsy of
the bladder.

1. Causae.
The muscle Sphincter being resolved through coldness and moisture, or the
nerves that spring from os sacrum, being ill affected; the urine goes away
against the will of the patient. Galenus.
Galen defines (...) to be (...), The way of the humors in the veins.

2. Besides imagination, which does chiefly work in us when we are asleep;
there happens also a laxness of the round muscle, caused by the abundance of
urine; and the sharpness thereof do provoke urine, as that some persons piss
their bed.

For the first, Curatio.
a purgation of the infusion of seane and Agarick.

1. A bag of primula veris, Ina arthretica, Sacculus.
Salvia, majorana ex floribus Anthos, Stacados, and cammomel; which may be
applied to the pubes, perinaeum, and also to the loins: also anoint those
places with oils de castoreo, costi, Oleum.
cinnamomi, vulpis; remember to make that strengthening decoction set down in
paralysis, Decoctio.
but make it with wine: you may inject the oils and waters of sage, primroses,
rue, Injectio.
and Stecados; promise no short cure, for it ever proves long and difficult.

2. For the latter, some use Pil. de quinque gener. Pilulae.
myrobolanorum: or you may infuse two dragmes of rhubarb in the decoction
aforesaid: or a clyster, wherein dissolve Oleum nervale; Pulvis.
some commend Vesica capre, suis, Tauri, being dried in an oven, and powdered;
and. j. or two given in wine, or the decoction aforesaid: Aetius.
Aetius commends the lungs of a goat to be roasted, and eaten fasting a
mornings: the testicle of a hare boiled in wine, the wine to be drunk, and the
stones eaten: It is a common thing, and confirmed by Galen, to give Farcimen ex
muribus. Galenus.


FINIS.
(...).
CHAP. I. LIB. II.
EPHEMERA in Greek, (...).
Diaria febris in Latin, in English one day fever; The Patient having but one
fit, and so for the most part finished in one day of his own nature: It is the
spirit or breath that is inflamed. Galenus.
Galen calls it, A simple fever.

A fever properly is an unnatural heat, Definitio febris.
which taking his beginning at the heart, is spread by the arteries and veins
into the whole body, and does let and hurt the operation of it.

Now of simple fevers some reckon three kinds; an unnatural heat engendered in
the spirits of breath causes Ephemera, or Diaria (as aforesaid) whereof be two
kinds, that is, Ephemera, Simpliciter or Diaria: Secondly, Diaria plurium
dierum, otherwise called Synochus non putrida, enduring three or four days:
unnatural heat engendered in the humors, causes Putrida febris, a rotten
fever; they do not in two places, within the vessels, and that two ways; for
either all the humors do putrify and rot equally, and cause a fever called
Synochus putrida: or one only humor putrifieth, and so causes a continual
fever.

If there be putrefaction of choler, it causes a continual Tertian, or a
burning fever: If of phlegm, it causes a continual Quotidian. If of
melancholy, it causes a continual Quartan.

If they rot without the vessels, then they cause an intermitting fever: for if
there be putrefaction of choler, it causes an intermitting Tertian; If of
phlegm that is sweet, an intermitting quotidian, exquisite and pure. If of
phlegm that is glasen, it causes Epialos: Epialos.
If of melancholy, an intermitting fever Quartan.

The cause of Ephemera is, Causa.
when as the breath is inflamed, and heat above nature without any putrefaction
or rottenness: also through watchings, crudities, lack of digestion, sadness,
fear, vehement care of mind, kernels in the throat, and such like; which heat
and inflame the spirits, and the whole body.

1. The signs are six: first, Signa.
the pulse are greater, swifter, and oftener.

2. Secondly, their urine is like a hail bodies urine.

3. Thirdly, their heat is gentle and easy.

4. Fourthly, the fever ends on a sudden.

5. Fifthly, there wants evil symptoms, as pain of the head, stomach, etc.

6. Sixthly, they are always engendered of an outward cause.

1. If watching be the cause, there is heaviness of the eyes, swartness of the
face.

2. If of anger, there is redness of the face and eyes, with a swift pulse.

3. If care and sorrow be the cause, there is a noughty color, heaviness of
the body, hollowness of the eyes, swartness of the face.

4. If of Sun-burning, the head is hot, and their veins sometimes puffed up.

5. If through cold, there follows distillations and Rhumes.

6. If of weariness, the skin is dryer.

7. If through drunkenness and hunger, it is known by the telling of the sick.

8. If through swelling about the throat, their pulse is great, swift, and
often with a red and swelled face.

If there be inflammation, Curatio. Victus ratio. Vinum.
and want of rest, let his diet be cold and moist: white wind that is thin is
much commended in all diary fevers, except there be headache: Galenus.
It helps digestion, provokes urine, and procures sweat; Galen commends
baths and gentle sweatings: oils of Ireos, Oleum.
and Nardinum to anoint outwardly is good: juice of ptisan and lettice in
broth: If there be crudity in the stomach, wash the belly with clysters,
bathing it with oil of wormwood, Oleum absynthii.
and procure rest, which digesteth crudity marvellously. And if nothing forbid,
administer this clyster.. Clyster. Carolus Amatus.
Decoctirutae, sem. lini, radicum althaeae, fl. Chamo. lb. ij. ss. olei
rutacei.ij. olei viol..j. Agarici.ij. misce pro enemate. This is good for a
strong body, and one that abounds with phlegm and wind; If the inflammation be
great, make your clyster of a more cooling quality, with Ol. Violar.

The pulse is equal, great, swift, frequent, and vehement.

Phlebotomy is much commended, Curatio. Venae sectio

all the humors do putrefie and rot equally together within all the vessels, by
reason of a feverons heat kept within the body.

The signs are an unseparable redness in the face: Signa.
an inflation of the veins, arteries, and temples: with lassitude and
wearisomeness of the body with a sleepy disposition: The urine is red and
gross; difficulty of breathing: a full, high, and swift pulse.

First administer a cooling clyster. Curatio: Venae-sectio
Secondly, draw blood out of the Basilica, Galen counsels even to the
fainting of the patient: Sanguisugae.
If it cannot be done, apply Sanguisugae, to the thighs, legs, and
shoulders: or provoke the Hemorrhoyds, Menstruis, or bleeding at the nose:
sometimes purge the body with strong Apozems, Apozema.
of the infusion of Rhubarb, with the syrrups of fumitory, and cichory: To
resist putrefaction, give Syrrupus de limonibus; Aqua graminis.iv. Julepus.
of the syrrup two ounces make a julip. Also the syrrups of Bugloss, fumitory,
and cichory, given in the waters of Roses, and sorrel, with a few drops of oil
of vitriol do well: Clyster.

FEBRIS CONTINVA, (...). Causa. Signa.
a continual fever: It is caused when one only humor does rot within the
vessels: There is not a more certain sign of a continual fever (either Tertian,
Quotidian, or Quartan) than that none of them do come to intermission, or
slaking altogether between the fits, until the fever be quite quenched: Also it
begins not with vehement cold, and stiffenesse: nor ends in quiet and rest, as
an exquisite intermitting Tertian does: likewise a continual Quotidian has not
any absolute intermission; an exquisite Quotidian has: In like manner a
continual Quartan comes not to quiet and rest between fits: the exquisite
quartan does: and this is all that puts a difference in the signs between
them: Curatio.
Observe this compendium in curing rotten fevers, First quench; Secondly, let,
or stop the portion of the fever (which is not yet kindled) from being
inflamed: Thirdly, heal the rottenness, and let, and stop that which is already
to engender putrefaction: Venae-sectio

CAVSOS: Ardens febris: continua Tertiana, (...).
a continual Tertian or burning fever.

It is caused when choler rotteth and putrifieth within the veins; Causa.
it agrees with an exquisite intermitting Tertian, because it is engendered of
the same humor that the other is: But yet differs, in that in an intermitting
Tertian the choler is carried all over the body (but in this causos, it is
contained in the vessels with the blood) so that when the choler is stirred
vehemently, and driven about by nature, there is wont to follow vehement cold,
and rigor: Hippocrat.
Hippocrates says 4. Aphoris. 58. That if it happens in a burning fever, the
Patient is delivered from the disease.

It is known by these signs: Signa.
their tongue is dry, gross, rough, and black: also gnawing of the stomach,
thirst, watchings, and many times ravings: their egestions of the womb be
liquid, and pale.

For his cure, use lettice, and sorrel, Curatio. Victus ratio.

violets, and water lillies: also sprinkle cold water in the room.

humor to be voyded, either by sweats, vomits, or egestions downwards; and
labor to quench the heat with Aq. sperm. ranarum, or the like; or if you
please, you may make a julep of barley water, Julepus.
wherein is boiled the strings of the vine a handful bruised; with a few
pruines; to the streining add sugar, syrrup of violets, poppies, or any other
syrrup that is of a cooling quality. The manner of preparing barley water,

Galen in the most hottest fevers gives counsel to draw blood, even ad
lypothimiam: Galenus. Curatio. Vena sectio
after the third fit it is most proper to be done. At the first opening of the
vein, we may draw blood more in quantity then at the second; because the first
is for evacuation; the second but for refrigeration: let this be done the day
before the fit. The next day at the hour of the coming of the fit, give a
vomit of the infusion of Stibium, Vomitus.
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15. drams, according to the strength of the

flowers of violets, burrage, roses, water lillies, endive, succory, lettice,

decoctions.

Amongst compounds, there is Elect de prunis damascenis, without diagridium:

third, and phlegm in a quotidian daily: Valescus reports, Valescus.
that he saw a man that had a fever every thirtieth day, for the space of
thirty years: that quartan is safest which proceeds not from other diseases,
for there be some fevers that degenerate into a quartan.

The sign is known by things antecedent, Signa.
as if the sick were melancholy, etc. It begins with trembling and shaking,
but not vehement at first; but afterward with rigor, and extreme cold: His
bones seem to be bruised, and feels pain in his lower parts, because the
humor is cold, dry, and gross. A small and low pulse, little hear, except
there be burnt choler: they have little sweat, the urinc thin, and waterish,

because from thence begins this fit: Rondeletius. Vinus salvTrallianus.
Valescus.
Rondeletius commends sage-wine: Trallianus affirms, that a live Bittle hung
about the neck, tincted with saffron, to be a sure help: Valesc. commends the
heart of a Hare prepared, as the lungs of a Fox, and given in wine 4, or 5,
times.

Of a simple Quartan may soon be made a double, or triple one; if hot things be
given before it comes to its state: Lastly, this infusion following is

CHAP. IX.
QVOTIDIANA FEBRIS, intermittens: (...). Causa.
It is engendered of putrified and rottenflegm, it is called of the Greeks
Amphimerina; because it causes a fit every day: yet the learned may be
(sometimes) deceived; for Duplex tertiana, Triplex quartana.
and Triplex quartana, does return daily:



The Quotidian with cold of the extreme parts:

It is known by the slownesse of the pulse, Signa.
being little and weak, they feel no thirst, the urine is white and thin; or
thick and troubled; no sweat in the first days: They oftentimes vomit phlegm:
phlegmatic persons are always vexed with it, but never choleric:

If salt, thirst.



(...).
then it ingendreth a fever called Epialos febris, in which the Patient is
feaverous, and vehemently cold both together: feeling both immoderate heat and
cold in all the parts of his body at the same time: Forpart of the humor which
is not as yet putrefied,

But the other rotten part of the humor engenders the fever:

Lipyria is a fever much like Epialos, (...).
you may have both their cures (out of the Chapter of Quotidiana febris) which
is as follows.

First administer this clyster. Curatio. Clyster.

a vomit made with the juice of Asaon, and oximel, and given before the fit, is
a sure help. To drink oximel simplex with oximel scilliticum, or if rest be
wanting, with syrrup of poppies, Haustus.
is good: If you see cause, procure a sweat, with possetale, wherein is boiled
Carduus benedict, centory, and liqueris: when the humors are extenuated,
provoke urine with broth, wherein is boiled smalledge, parsley, and fennel
roots: The juice of Horse-radich in whey is excellent for the same purpose:
stomach pills are good: also anoint his back with oil of flower-delice or
dill: Ceratum.
and use ceratum stomachale, with oil of nutmegs: and give him syrrup of
wormwood sometimes: And it is held for certain, that a dragme of old Treakle,
Diaphoreticus.
or mithridate, (the body being purged) given in pure white wind, before the
fit, does cure the same: Lastly, if you see cause, give him this potion..
Diaphaenicon. ij. jalap. benedict. lax. Potio purgans.

CHAP. X.
HECTICA FEBRIS: (...).
is anunnatural heat kindled, not only in the spirits and humors, but also in
the sound and fleshly parts: The Patient is not sensible of the fever, nor of
any pain.

It is caused for the most part of burning fevers continuing long: Causa.
also great evacuations may be the cause: A feverous heat invades the dewy or
alimentary humor, called Cambium; and at length consumes the humidity that is
contained in the body of the heart: melting fevers the Greeks call Marasmos.

There may be felt heat if you lay your hand on them: Their urine is thin,
cruide, white, Signas
and pale, at last oily: a dry cough, a slack and hard pulse: It is called
Hectic by reason of the dry Artery, their hands and feet are hotter after
meals then before; their stomach sticks almost to the ribs: the face is
leady: at last he is like a ghost: his eyes hollow, his nose sharp, his hairs
fall, his legs swell; and lastly, a flux of the belly; then judge that death
is nigh.

It is called a fever Hectic, so long as natural humidity is reserved; when
that is consumed, then is called Marasmos.

The whole cure consists in cooling and moystning: Curatio. ^tisanae. Victus
Ratio.
let him eat ptisan, also flesh of kids, feasants, birds of mountains, cocks
stones, capons flesh, reer-egges, lettice, endive, cichory, gourds, spinach,
mallows, cherries, strawberries, pruines, pomegranets, melons; milk is
extremely commended, if it be not compounded with another fever; Aq. sperm.
ranar. is excellent: Clyster.
beware of purging: if need be, give cooling and moystning clysters, adding the
marrow of cassia fistula. The syrrups of violets, purslain, water lillies, and
poppies, are good: so are gellies; also lambs heads, and calves feet boiled in
the decoction for clysters.

Let four young men take a sheet and dip it in cold water ( in aqua sperm.
ranarum, so I conceive to be far better) and lay the Patient in it, and
immediately tumble him into another; into a third; and so into a fourth: also
to dippe or plunge him into cold water is commended; and then to wipe him
softly, with soft linen clothes: and to anoint his body with oil of roses,
Galen much extolleth it.. Epithema pro cord.
Aqua violarum nenupharis, lactucae, ana iij. aceti. ss. rosar. rub. triasant.

Pollio Romulus being above a hundred years old, Divus Augustus asked him, by
what means he kept his strength of body and mind, he answered, Intus mulso,
foris oleo, that is, I keep me moist with mulso within, and oil I anoint upon
my skin: Asses milk is good: some commend bleeding, but not above two or three
ounces at a time.

Lastly, Marasmos is not to be cured: (...).
for even as to pour oil into a lamp where is no week nor match, is nothing
else but oleum and operam perdere; so in vain we strive to restore to nature
that solid substance, being by heat consumed and taken away. If you want more,
look into the Chapter of Ptisis. Lastly,. Cons. ros. antiquae.j. trochisc. de

SEMITERTIANA Febris, (...).
Haemitritaeon in Greek, in English Half a tertian: Its framed of a continual
quotidian; and of an intermitting tertian: Causa.
It is caused through putrified phlegm, that is mixed with rotten choler.

They altogether tremble, and shake daily; Signa.
being often troubled with unquietness, bitterness, (watchings, thirst,) of the
mouth; with lassitude. From phlegm proceeds the cold, from choler, a light
succession; But from both, trembling: He is far more grievous than a terrian;
Hippocrates.
Hippocrates says, its deadly, because it leaves no time to nature to nourish
the body, concoct hurtful humors, and repair strength: so that they have
often syncops: when the tertian exceeds the quotidian, there is vehement cold
in the augmenting of the fit; Also more burning: yellow choler is sent forth
by vomit, or stool: If the quotidian exceeds the tertian, there is cold in the
extreme parts: but little shaking; and less heat: If of like force, it comes
with horror and shaking, then it is an exquisite Hemitrice fever.

The remedies must be mixed against choler, Curatio.
and phlegm: The stomach strengthened, and the liver cooled: search the
Chapters of Tertiana, Quotid. and Tertiana notha febris.

CHAP. XII.
FEBRIS PESTILENTIA; (...). Causa.
is a disease which happens unto many: Having his beginning from an un-usuall
putrefaction; also having its beginning likewise sometimes in our selves; the
humors do degenerate so much from their natural temperament, that they take
unto themselves a pernicious and venomous quality: sometimes it is caused by
outward means, as putrefied exhalations communicated to the air from dead
carcases not buried: Fennes, Pools, standing waters, stinking channels,
venomous dens, and mettalin spirits arising out of the earth: Also from the
variable commistion of the planets: and then it is the scourge of the most high
God for our sins: Also a corrupt air may be the cause: I mean diet: It
rages commonly at the latter end of Summer, and the beginning of Harvest or
Autumn.

The outward members are cold, Signa.
the inward hot: There is heaviness, wearisomenesse, sloth, difficulty of
breathing, pain in the head, carfulness of mind, sadness, mavelous
sleepy, and sometimes raging vexes him; with loss of appetite, thirst, often
vomiting, bitterness, and dryness of the mouth: a frequent, small, and deep
pulse: the urine thick and stinking: yet sometimes it is like a hail bodies
urine. Lastly, the sure token is botches behind the ears, or under the
arme-holes, or about the share: also small spots all over the body, with great
faintness.

First, burn juniper, oken wood, laurel, Curatio. Fumigatio.
or Tamariscus in the house: or strew juniper berries, mirrhe, frankincense,
rue, Angelica (in powder) upon coals: Also sprinkle vinegar upon the pavement.

Secondly, If a plethorick body, open a vein, Venae-sectio Vomitus.
on that side the botch is on: and on that vein that comes from thence: some
commend a stibium vomit, especially if choler abound: also Electuarium de ovo,

a botch; Cataplas.
rot it with a poultis made of fenegreek, linseed, roots of Althaea, white
lillies, and figs; or goose-dung dissolved in oil of Cammomel: for his sauce
vinegar is good, and lymonds: he may drink wine that is thin and watery: And
let him often smell on Rue: He must eschew Venus that fears this fever; and
bleed after the body be well purged, Pil. pestilentialis.

CHAP. XIII.
LVES VENEREA, is a contagious evil, gotten for the most part by the use of
venery, and of unclean bodies: The part affected is the liver.

The cause is an impure touch in copulation, Causa.
the man or woman having their privities troubled with virulent ulcers, or
molested with a virulent strangury; the contagion whereof is eommunicated from
one infected body to another.

The woman takes it by receiving the virulent seed of an unclean person; The
signs thereof remaining in the wrinkles of the womb, may be drawn in by the
pores of the open and standing yard, and so infect the man; whence succeed
ulcers, and a virulent strangury in the privities of both persons.

It may be taken by breathing only, or by eating, drinking, and lying with the
infected, or after them in their sheets: I read of a nurse that infected a
Gentlewomans child, the child, the mother, the mother, her husband, and the
husband infected two of his other children.

There appear Bubos in the groine, Signa.
pustuls in the yard, the urinary passages are ulcerated: The prepuce is
sometimes so scorched with heat, that it will not slip over the Glans: the
urine burns with pain, and a virulent Gonorrhea: Sometimes red, sometimes
yellow, and filthy spots like warts, are over the body, which in time prove
ulcers and pustuls: There is pain of the nerves, shoulders, head, and neck: In
many there is pustuls in the pallat of their mouth, jaws, nose, and tongue,
which in time ulcerate: oftentimes the hair of the head, and Beard fall away:
They cannot sleep, for they have exceeding pain in the night, more then in the
day.

Because the venereous virulency lying asleep, is enraged by the warm bed:
also the Patients thoughts are fixed upon the object of pain most in the night.

On their joints and shin-bones, they have certain tophies and tumors very
hard to be dissolved: and especially in their foreheads, and shoulders;
Prognostica
The effects of Lu. ve. are sad. For some lose one, or both their eyes, or
eyelids; looking very ghastly; some lose their hearing, and their noses do
sometimes fall flat, with the loss of the bone called Ethmoides; so that they
faulter and fumble in their speech: some have their yards cut off, by reason of
a Gangreen, and women a great part of their privities are tainted with
corruption: men sometimes have their urethra obstructed by budding caruncles,
or inflamed pustules, and often stand at need of the Cathaetur: some their
mouths are drawn awry, others grow lame of arms, or legs: some are
troubled with Asthma, others have the leprosy: some with Hectica febris,
others their throats eaten with putrefied and cancrous ulcers: some are
troubled with a filthy flux of blood, and the falling sickness.

Sometimes there follows a disease called Plica: being most loathsome, and
horrible: Plica. Glissonins.
and bred by modern luxury and excess, seizing specially on women.

It is a viscous venomous humor, that glues together (as it were) the hair of
the head, with a prodigious entanglement: sometimes taking the form of a great
snake, or else of little serpents, full of nastinesse, vermin, and noisome
smell: so that being pricked with a needle, they yield bloody drops. It began
in Germany, I mean, at the first, in Poland: Those that cut off their hair,
either lost their eyes, or the humor falling down, tortured them very much in
their lower parts: The cure of this most grievous disease, you may pick out of
this Chapter; yet if you would see farther concerning it, Herculsaxonia
look into Hercul. Saxonia his tenth book De Plica: and in it you shall find 67
Chapters of this disease; which with the rest aforementioned, are oftentimes
the offspring of the Lues venerea: whose proper Antidote is Argentum vivum.
Also many become impotent to Venery: venereous ulcers on the yard are hard to
cure.

But if being healed they remain hard, and callous: they are signs of the
disease lying hid in the body. Mentagra. (...).
A disease called Mentagra, that vexed the Romans in the time of Claudius, was
very like this, which oftentimes is transferred from the parents to the
children: Lastly, many perish with a fever (that have Lues venerea) having
continual sorrow and grief.

This disease being newly taken, Curatio. Venae sectio
admits of an easy cure:

1. The first intention must be to open a vein.

2. The second is, the gross humors must be attenuated: for which purpose,
The decoction of Radicum foeniculi, eringii, enulae campanae, Oximel.
lentium, uvarum passarum, ficum, etc. also oximel scillitici, is good for the
same purpose.

3. Potio purgans.
Next purge him with confectio hamech in the decoction of Guiacum: which you
may make after this manner.. Decoctio guaiaci.
Ligni guaiac..viij. cortic. ejusd..iv. Sarsaeparill. rad. chinae, lign.

the wine

Some add Carduus benedictus, sweet fennel-seed, Staecadas, germander,
anniseed, parsley, rue, diptane, flowers of marygold, broom, balm, and
rosemary: also zedoary, sage, betony, juniper berries, the three sanders,
Agrimony, and Centory.

4. He must drink a quarter of a pint of the decoction (above said) at a time,
evening and morning, and between meals: make another drink of the same
ingredients, that he may drink of it at meals. Also. Decoct. guaiacicum card.
benedict.. v. Haustus.
Theriac. mithridat. ana ij. vel..i.ss. olei guaiac. Gut. 8. vel 10. olei

5. Let the Patient sweat often with this draught, an hour at a time: his sweat
must be wiped off with fine dry clothes, taking heed of cold: you may add
centory, and liqueris to the aforesaid decoction, and it will be the stronger
to procure sweat.

If the Patient be much feverous, leave out the Guaiacum, and its bark: And put
in Borrage, Bugloss, Cichory, Violets, Polypody, Currants, etc.

6. Also let Sarsaeparilla, China, and Eringo roots, be boiled in his broth:
made with the knuckles of veale.

7. Let his body be often purged: and a vein often opened: Also this electuary
following is good.. Conserv. cichor. rosarum, ana.iij. Electuarium.
ligni guaiac. subtiliss. pulverisati, sarsaeparill. ana.ss. spec. diarrhod.
Abdiatrion santal.. j. cum sir. de cichor. fiat Electuarium;

Let him eat thereof often; it will comfort and corroborate:

9. If the disease be stubborn, you must come to unction.. Axung. porci li. j.
olei cammomeli, anethi, Linimentu^.
terebinth, laurini, ana. j. argenti vivi. vj. theriac, ven. mithridat. ana.ss.
fiat linimentum secund. artem. First boil your hogges-grease with sage,
rosemary, thyme, marjoram, and lavender: then kill your Quicksilver, and mix
them altogether: and beat them for the space of a whole day: with this anoint
his joints, wrists, the spine of his back, his elbowes, knees, ankles, and
shoulders: in a close room; and beware of cold, which is most hurtful in Lues
venerea.

Let your frictions be gentle, and you must so long use them with unctions,
until the virulent humors be evacuated, by spitting and salivation, by
stool, urine, sweat, or insensible transpiration; which you shall know by the
falling away; and drying up of the pustules; And the ceasing of the pains and
other symptoms proper to this disease: unction must be used twice aday on
strong bodies; upon rare and delicate bodies but once; upon weak bodies, every
two or three days; and then bind up their limbs with gray paper.

Observe if nature be stirred up, and bent to any kind of evacuation, either by
the mouth, pores, stool, or the like, then use frictions every 2, 3, 4, or 5,
days.

Dysenteries caused by unction, may be helped by clysters; wherein much
hog's grease is dissolved.

If you should anoint some to death, you cannot bring them to flux at the
mouth; yet through some other evacuation they recover: this Emplaster following
is much commended for hard tophies.. Massae emplast. de melil, Emplastru^.
and oxycrocei ana li. ss. argenti vivi extin..vj. ol. laurini, and de spica,
reducantur ad formam emplastri.

10. Spread of it on leather, and apply it as you shall see cause: or.
Emplastri de meliloto pro spleen li. ss. argent. Ceratum.
viv.. ij. olei laurini, petrolei, terebinthinae, ana Q.S. fiat cerotum. For
the ulcers of the mouth, make a decoction of barley, marsh mallows, and
lettice: Also to wash the mouth with cowes milk warm, is good.

11. If the mouth and jaws become so swelled, as a gangreen is to be feared;
then use restrictive and repelling gargarismes, Gargarismus.
made of barley water, plantin, nightshade, knot-grass, sheppards purse,
quinces, lettice, water lillies, and wood-binde: also Balaustia, red roses, and
myrtills: syrrups of dried roses, quinces, and barberies; honey of roses, and
diamoron.

His diet in this condition must be reer-egges, Victus raetio.
barley creames, cullesses, made of the decoction of knuckles of veale, and
gellies.

12. For the ulcers on the prepuce, and glans, every night anoint them with
ung. Argenti vivi: so far as they are scorched with inflammation, or ulcerated;
and in the morning wash it with the coction of guaicaum, or china, or
sarsaeparilla: so do until the ulcer be dried, and healed, and the
inflammation quenched; this is a sure help; its called Paraphimosis.

13. For the virulent Gonorrhaea annexed with it: Gonorrhaea virulenta.
First direct a dry diet; as biscakes, raisons, blanched almonds, to make
meals of them often.

14. Then purge him with this potion following.. Potio purgans.
Decoct. com.. vj. cassiae re. extractae. ss. Syrrupus rosarum. sol.. ss.
misce. Let him take the one half overnight warm, and the rest in the morning:
If he be a strong body, put in.ss. or.vj. of Diaprunum sol. instead of Cassia:
let him drink of the decoction of Sarsae and China constantly.

15. And let him take half an ounce of washed turpentine in wafers, 2, or 3
times; and sweat once or twice, if need be.

For this Gonorrhaea, is the beginning of the Lues venerea; and will certainly
follow, if not prevented with the aforesaid means: And so much shall suffice
for this most detestable and grievous evil, which by Gods command, has
assailed mankind; as a scourge or punishment to restrain the too wanton and
lascivious lusts of unpure persons.

CHAP. XIV.
SCORBVTVS: (...).
called by Pliny, Sceletyrbe, and Stomacace. It is a disease obstructing the
spleen, whereby the course of melancholy is hindered; which being mingled with
the rest of the blood, infecteth all the body: The grosser part falling down
stains the legs with spots; the thinner part being carried up, defiles the gums.

The cause is a gross and corrupt diet; Causa.
and also a full and delicate diet (using no exercise) may be the cause:
sometimes it follows a quartan fever.

The gummes are foul, Signa.
and swelled with black blood: the teeth loose, black, and leady spots in the
legs: and sometimes in the face. There is weakness in the joints, difficulty
of breathing, being ready to die when they move: but being laid, they are
refreshed: they are greedy of meat, costive of body, yet some have a flux: some
have swelled, and ulcerated legs, so that their shin bone lie bare: In some
bodies it turns into a kind of leprosy: those that die of this disease, their
bodies are found to be spotted all over.

First open the vein on the left arm, Curatio Venae sectio
called Lienaria, and draw away blood according to the strength, and age of the
Patient: Basilica; but if they be far spent, abstain from phlebotomy, except
it be by the haemorrhodiall veins: Next give this Apozem following.. Decoctio.
com..vj. cassiae re. extractae. ss. Apozema.
Syrrupus de epithymo cretens. Sir. fumariae ana.j. misce. and f. Apozem. Give
him half over night, and the other half in the morning warm: For this disease
admits not any vehement purgations. Becabunga
called Becabunga: you may put two or three ounces of it into posset ale, drink
it and sweat, if possible. Also this julep following is good to drink often of
it.. Aqua fumaria p. 1. Sir. ejusd.. ij. ol. vitr. gr. Julepus.
vj. misce. For children make this syrrup.. Syrrupus.
Succi chochleariae, succi becabungae, an li. iij. sacchar. albis. li.ij.

berries, ginger, and pepper: and put them all into the wine and water; let them
stand a whole night; strain it, and let the Patient drink a quarter of a pint
at a time, last at night, and first in the morning. Forestus.
If any man desire more knowledge of this disease, let him read Forestus his
observations in diseases of the spleen.

CHAP. XV.
PRIAPISMVS, (...). Causa.
is a disease in which the yard is extended in length and bigness, without any
lusting.

It is caused either through immoderate opening the mouths of the arteries; or
else of a vaporous spirit engendered in the hollow and fistulous sinew, or
through long abstinence from carnal copulation: Satyriasis.
If there be panting, and beating of the yard, with a desire to the act of
generation, then it is called Satyriasis.

They suffer as it were a cramp, Signa.
the yard being puffed up, and stretched out: they quickly perish, without
sudden help: And when they die, their bellies be puffed up, and their sweat is
cold.

First open Mediana of the arms; Curatio. Clyster. Venae-sectio
then clysters made of beets, mallows and mercury; adding Manna, and Cassia:
but beware of purges, and things that be diuretical: to procure gentle vomits
are good: Aq sperm. ranarum.
give him to drink a little Aqua sperm. ranar. with sugar. And keep him from
sights, and stories appertaining to lechery: Let him drink barley water: If a
virulent Gonorrhaea be annexed with it, then frictions (on the fistulous sinew)
of ung. argenti vivi, helps him: In this disease, Forestus in his first Tome,
and 26. Forestus.
Book, and ninth observation, commends a vomit made with Asaron.

CHAP. XVI.
GONORRHAEA: seu seminis profluvium: (...).
It is excretion and shedding of seed against the Patients will; without
sickness of the yard.

It is caused through imbecility of the retentive virtue, in the vessels
containing the sperm: Causa.
or violent moving, may be the cause.

The sperm is watery, Signa.
and thin, without aptetite to carnal copulation: some feel not the flux,

Gonorrhaea which is found in plethorick bodies, abounding with blood; that

CELE in Greek, (...).
Ramex and Hernia in Latin: of the barbarous writers Ruptura: there be seven
kinds or nine.

1. Enterocele, or Ramex intestinorum, (...).
is when the Peritonaeum do break, and the bowels fall down into the Cods.

2. Bubonocele, or Ramex inguinis, (...).
is when the bowels do cleave, or stay above the privy members.

3. Hydrocele, or Ramex aquosus, (...)
is when a watery humor is gathered into any part of the filmes or skin of the
Cods.

4. Sarcocele, (...).
or Ramex carnosus is when there grows hard flesh within the coats, and
tunicles of the stones.

5. Epiplocele, or Ramex omenti, (...).
is when the kall or filme, that laps in the bowels, do fall down into the Cods.

6. Enteroepiplocele, or Ramex omenti and intestini, is when the bowels do slip
down with the filme.

7. Cirsocele, or Ramex varicosus, (...)
is when the veins, which nourish the stones, are spread abroad, and swollen
out of measure on heaps.

8. Ramex ventosus.
Physocele or Hernia ventositatis, is when wind is gathered into the skin of
the Cods.

9. Hyrophysocele or Ramex ventosus and aquosus, when wind and water is
gathered into the filmes of the Cods.

They are caused by some violent accident, Causa.
as a stroke, leaping, crying, fall, or lifting, which do break the
peritonaeum; Ramex intestinorum; Ramex inguinis.

Or the vessels joined together, and increasing in the Cods; or the vessels
being broak, and slidden down, sends blood thither; which being changed into
a watery, or wheyish substance, Ramex aquosus. Ramex carnosus is caused through
a stripe or blow,

The signs of the two first is a manifest swelling in the Cods; Signa.


The signs of a watery humor,

The signs of Ramex carnosus is hardness,

You must lay the Patient upright, Curatio.
yet so as his head may be lower then his buttocks; Fomentati.
and nourish the place with wool dipped in oil. Also take Emplastrum ad
Herniam; Emplastru^.
let it lie on seven days, being bound fast with his truss: and let him give
himself rest for thirty days; this is an excellent help.

Also make a decoction with comfry roots, Decoctio.
and leaves of laurel, boil them in red wine, and water of plantin, and then
sweeten it with sugar.

For a watery rupture look into the Chapters of the dropsies, as Ascites, etc.
Peritonaeum, in men of full growth, seldom admits of cure.

A certain chyrurgion did use to beat a loadstone into fine powder, Historia.
and give of it to children in a little pap: and then he anointed the groine
with honey, and then strewed on it the fine filings of Iron: this he did for
10, or 12, days together; keeping up the bowels straight with a truss.

Thus have you had directions for the curing of the first, second, third,
fifth, and sixth: As for the fourth rupture, its more properly a chirurgious
work, Paraeus.
and if you please you may take Parey for your guide; so likewise for the
seventh: As for the eighth and ninth, look into the Chapters of the dropsies.

There is also Hernia Humoralis, Hernia humoralis,
or between the tunicles which involve the testicle: Pneumatocele, which is a
flatulent tumor in the Cod, Pneumatocele.

If against nature, no superfluous blood in them. Also gross blood, bleeding
at the nose, etc. sweating, continual vomiting, fluxes of the belly, hardness,
scars, or a piece of flesh engendered in the mouth of the matrice, may be the
cause: also carelessness, fear, and sorrow.

There is heaviness, a desire to vomit, Signa.
abhorring of meat, pains about the loins, thighs, neck, eyes, and head;
sometimes fevers, and blackish urine made with difficulty.

1. A cold distemper is known by dullness, a white and leady color in the face,
and a watery, thin and greenish urine.

2. A hot distemper of fullness, is known by vehement pain about the loins,
and privy members; with swollen veins.

1. For a cold distemper turn back to lib. 1. Curatio. Sabina.
chap. 25. page 52. for a poor body let the leaves of savine be boiled in wine
and drunk, or receive the fume of savine; it will force them: It does also
expel the dead child.

2. In a hot cause bleed on the feet, Venae sectio
cool and moysten; and give syrrup of steel: And when the distemper is over,
then observe the former directions: for fullness make a purgation with
Diaphaenicon, Hierapicra, and benedicta laxativa: Purgatio.
Amongst simples that provoke the terms, are roots of parslay, sperage,

This flux of the matrice is a continual distillation and flowing out for a

The humor is red like putrefied blood; Signa.
yet sometimes pure, which notes erosion or gnawing: mattery, white, and
sometimes watery: the secret part is continually moist with the humors, being
of diverse colors: She is ill colored, abhors meat, her eyes are swollen,
and she breaths difficult^y.

CHAP. XXI.
VTERI STRANGVLATIO seu suffocatio, (...).
otherwise called Hysterica passio: It is a drawing of the womb to the upper
parts, as it were by a convulsive motion.

It is caused through the defluction either of seed being sometimes corrupted:
Causae.
or the flowers which causes the womb to be swelled, and the vessels and
ligaments to be distended with fullness, and pressing the Diaphragma, causes
shortness of breathing: Also the whites, or some other humor, or a tumor, or
a rotten impostume, or some ill juice putrefying, and resolving into gross
vapors, may be the cause.

The womb removes out of his seat, and does one while fall toward the liver;
another while toward the milt, another while toward the midriffe; stomach,
and downwards toward the bladder: sometimes the child is very great, that it
press the midriff, and so cause the fits.

When the fit is nigh, Signa.
there is heaviness of mind, slowness, paleness, and sorrowfulness.

Being present, there is a drowsiness, also doting, and a withholding of the
instruments of breathing, they wax dumb, and draw up their legs, and a moist
humor flows out of the womb.

1. If it assail the guts, the bowels make a noise.

2. If it trouble the stomach, there is vomiting.

3. If it assail the breast and throat, there is choking.

4. If the brain, there is madness.

5. If the heart, there is swouning; some sleep sound, others talk foolishly,
others they breath so little, that they seem dead.

1. If you would know whether she be dead or not, take a smooth looking-glass,
lay it, or hold it before her mouth and nostrils; if she breath though never so
obscurely, yet the glass will be duskey.

2. Or take a fine downish feather, and hold it likewise as aforesaid, and it
will by the trembling, or shaking motion thereof; show that there is some
breath, and therefore life remaining in the body.

3. But the surest way is to blow up sneesing powder, but if no breath appear,
do not presently judge the woman for dead; for the small vital heat may be
drawn into the heart, and so not quite destitute of life; but for the present
nature is contented with transpiration only. So flies, gnats, and pishmares, or
pismires, live all winter without breathing.

1. If it proceeds from the corruption of the seed, the accidents are more
grievous and violent: difficulty of breathing goes before, and shortly after
comes the deprivation thereof: And the whole habit of the body seems more cold
then a stone: She is a widow, or a woman that her husband has a long time been
absent from her, so that she has great store of seed, which causes heaviness
of the head; loss of appetite, sadness, and fear: Also young maids that are
prone to lechery, abounding with blood and seed; are often troubled with this
disease, so that if the abundance of seed be the cause, they speak things that
are to be concealed; some laugh, others weep, and some sing: But the peculiar
signs, if the midwife tickle her womb with her finger, there comes away thick
and gross seed, with much pleasure and delight; as may be perceived by the
Patient: so that all symptoms do quickly vanish.

2. It is very like it is caused by the suppression of the flowers, if they had
them very well formerly, and on a sudden they stop, and the fits likewise
quickly follow after. Look the cause of Mensium suppressio, I mean the sign:
many do perish in the fit, or within few hours after, which happens when the
pulse are swift and inordinate, and then vanish clean away.

In the Fit, place her on her back, Curatio.
with her breast and stomach loose, and her garments slack about her, that she
may breathe the more freely.

Some pull the hairs of the secret parts, using frictions below: and fumes of
cinnamon, Lignum aloes.
Callam. aromat. lignum Aloes, Ladanum, Benzoin, and storax: An instrument may
be made for this purpose, with a tunnell on the top, through which, the fume
may pass into the matrice.

Contrariwiwise, to the nostrils Gum. galbanum, Sagapenum. Assafoetida
ammoniacum, Assa foetida, the snuff of candle, also hair, old leather,
horse-hoofees, and partridges feathers burnt, are good.

If she be a married woman, let her be strongly encountered by her husband, who
possibly may be the cause, by not affording her due benevolence: for one I knew
once to be guilty of this crime, and for no other end, but because he was
unwilling to have any more children by her: so that the woman had undoubtedly
perished in her most grievous fits, if I had not persuaded him to relieve her;
which accordingly he did, and she very suddenly recovered.

If she be a maid, or widow, let the midwife anoint her finger with Oleum
moschaetalinum, Oleum.
or cloves, or the best is a little amber greece, or civet, Sacculi.
and tickle the top of the neck of the womb (which Plato calls (...), a
craving creature,) Also to apply sitle bags (of motherwort, origan, cammomel,
peniroyal, lavender, and mugwort) hot to her secret parts, is a present remedy,
in the time of the fit. And procure sneesing with Helleborus albus, or
pilletary, with a little powder of Castoreum. After the fit I have procured
gentle vomiting, with good success; and Castoreum drunk in wine, is excellent.

Also open a vein on the foot, Venae-sectio
especially if the menstruis be stopped: using other means also to procure
them. And administer this clyster following.

PROCIDENTIA VTERI, (...).
or a falling down of the womb, so that it sticks out outwardly.

The cause is of falling from an high place, Causae.
sore travel of childbirth, or through the unskilfulnesse of the midwife, who
draws away the womb with the child, or with the secundine cleaving fast
thereunto.

Also a tenasmus may be the cause, or whatsoever weightily presses down the
Diaphragma; or the muscles of the Epigastrium; or setting on a cold stone:
Therefore what thing soever resolve, relax, or burst the ligaments or bands,
whereby the womb is tied, are supposed to be causes of the accident.

There is felt pain in the entrails, loins, or os sacrum: Signa.
And a tractable tumor at the neck of the womb: It is sometimes seen hanging
out, of the bigness and form of goose egg, like a piece of red flesh.

If that hangs out be putrified, Curatio.
it must be cut away; being first tied, and the rest seared with a cautery.
Paulus, and others testify that some women have lost the greater part, others
all their womb, and yet have lived very well, after it: If it hangs down
between the thighs; it is hard to cure, yet place her on her back; her buttocks
and thighs being lifted up, and her legs drawn back, then anoint with oil
of sillies: Fomentatio
If it be swelled, use a fomentation of mallows, Althaea, and fennegreek, then
thrust it up gently with your finger into its place, whilst the woman draw her
breath as as if she supt something: then wipe away the oil, and foment with an
astringent decoction made with pomegranate pills, Decoctio.
roche-allam, cypress nuts, Clyster.
barberries, etc. boiled in smithswater: Also a clyster is good. Or prepare
wool in figure and thickness, according to the proportion of the member: wind
it about with a fine cloth, dip it in the juice of Acatia, and Hypocischis,
put it into the womb, and you shall by little and little, Vomitus.

MOLA, of the Greek word Mile, (...). Galenus.
which signifies a millstone: Galen in lib. 14. There. meth. defines a Mola to
be a piece of flesh without shape, or (...). an idle and imperfect flesh. It is
a false conception of deformed flesh, round and hard: sometimes distinguished
into members, coming by corupt and weak diseased seed, Causae.
and the immoderate flux of terms, overwhelming the man's seed, changes it
into a Mola: which disease cannot happen to any without the help of man, whose
seed does only minister matter for the generation thereof.

There is a pricking pain (at the beginning) that troubles the belly, Signa.
which will swell sooner then it would, if it were a true issue: and will be
distended with greater hardness, being more troublesome because contrary to
nature: presently after the dugs swell, but shortly they fall lank: for nature
sends milk thither in vain, because there is no issue in the womb that may
spend the same.

1. It will move before the third month, but the true conception will not.

2. Also this motion is of the faculty of the womb, and of the spirit of the
seed dispersed through the Mola, and not of the intellectual soul, or spirit,
sent from above, But is nourished and increased after the manner of plants.

3. The Mola by reason of its greatness and heaviness rowleth like a stone:
unto that side the woman declineth her self.

4. She waxes lean in all her members, especially her legs; although toward
night they swell.

5. she is slow in going.

If it cleaves not very fast, it falls away in 3, or 4, months; some have it
cleaving so fast to the sides of the womb, and Cotylidons: that they bear them
5, or 6, years, some as long as they live.

6. She has an evil color, loss of appetite, and suppression of menstruis,
as in the lawful conception.

7. There is sometimes difficult making of urine, and the excrements stop for a
week together, by reason the Mola presses the guts.

8. There happens sometimes excellent fluxes that lesseneth the body; in one
womb sometimes are found 2, or 3, Moles: And sometimes the Mola is annexed
with a child.

9. Lastly, about the ninth or tenth month, some expel sounding blasts of
wind, whereby the womb falls lank and slender, which before was so puffed
up, as every one thought them to be with child.

For the cure, Curatio.
all things that provoke the flowers, and exclude the dead child are to be
prescribed: inwardly put up, and outwardly applied: look into the Chapter of
Mensium suppressio: make fomentations with mallows, Fomentatio.

VTERI INFLAMMATIO: Causa.
It is caused through a stripe: the stopping of the menstruis, abortion,
exulceration, unmeasurable lechery, or immoderate deambulation may be the cause.

There is an acute fever, Signa.
pain of the head, share, loins, and roots of the eyes; convulsion and cramp
of the arms, fingers, and neck: pain of the stomach, and womb. If the hinder
part be inflamed, there is pain about the loins: if the fore part, there is
pain about the privities; so that a strangury, or difficult making of urine do
follow: when it affects the mouth of the matrice, the mouth is hard, shut up,
and burning hot: If the sides be inflamed, the parts above the privities are
distended, and the legs grieved.

First open a vein on the foot (if it came not by abortion or a flux of blood)
Secondly ptisan, Curatio. Venae. sectio
and cooling clysters are exceeding good: Apply to the share cataplasmes of

The bottom of the body is swelled with hardness, Signa.
and a pain that pricketh even to the Diaphragma, and stomach, to the loins,
share, and navel,: If wind be gotten into the hollownesse of the womb, there is
heard a rumbling noise: If into the thin, and slender passages, the pain is
vehement and hard to cure.

Fasting is good: if a plethorick body, Cura tio. Venae sectia
open a vein: an excellent clyster for this purpose you may have in uteri
strangulatio: Bathe her body with oil of Rue, Dill, and Origan: you may power
them into her womb, for they resolve windiness: In her broth boil the seeds
of Apium, fennel, caraway, cummin, and anise: Also with cammomel, calamint,
motherwort, penniroyal, and sothernwood, may be made poultises. If there be
clods of blood, let the midwife put her finger (being first anointed) into her
privities, and bring it forth by little and little, that the windiness may
pass. Lastly, with her meat give her this powder.. Cinnamomi, nucis moscata,

even to their fingers ends.

For the cure, Curatio: Venae-sectio
first bleed, if nothing forbid it: If there be much heat, look back into the

and honey: Also Mulsa with the decoction of Ireos, Aristolochia, wormwood, or
Agrimony: eating ulcers must be washed with Mares, or Asses milk, with honey.

The ulcer being cleansed, Decoctio.
make a decoction of pomegranate rinds, roses, quinces, myrtills, Acatia, with

man is troubled with a Phymosis; upon the praeputium for the most part.

It is caused of exulceration, Causa.
and an inflammation going before: or Lues venerea, which lies hid in the
body: Signa. Curatio. Fomentatio
There needs not any signs: Fomentations must be used that can dissolve and
mollify; made of fenegreek, Althaea, etc. And put up a dry sponge, having
cord hanging to it: If it fall out put in a thicker: sometimes anoint the
sponge with oil of Ireos, and goose-grease: If there be much inflammation use
oil of roses, instead of oil of Ireos: Oleum.
Thus must you always use spunges until the end of the cure: If this Phymosis
(which is a callous hardness) happens upon a man's yard, use dissolving
things, as. Muscilag. fic. and faenug. ana. ij. Stirac. Vnguentu^.
myrrhae, ammo. diss. in ol. irino ana. ji cerae novae q.s. fiat unguentum. If
it will not yield to this means, use ung. argent. viv. extinct.

CHAP. XXVIII.
STERILITAS: Causa.
or barrenness: It is caused either of the woman's, or of the man's part; when
his seed is either too hot, cold, thin, watery, or too feeble: Their yards too
short, or their bellies too big.

2. Also women of their part cannot conceive, because their matrice is either
too hot, cold, and moist, or too foul, filthy, or dry, or too straight, or
too open: Also unwilling carnal copulation, or their age too great, or too
little, does let and hinder conception.

3. A fertile woman is commonly of a moderate stature, and height of body,
breadth of loins, and share: her buttocks sticking out, a handsome and
convenient greatness of belly, a straight breast, and large paps.

1. Signa.
The hot distemper of a man is known by his lascivious and readiness to carnal
lust, yet he is satiated and filled.

2. Coldnness is known by their want of hair, for their stones are bald, and
they have little desire to lust.

1. If through too much heat of the matrice, the rest of their body is hot and
they are lecherous.

2. Coldness is known by their despising carnal lust, and the stopping of the
menstruis.

3. If through too much moystnesse, then in the act they are bedewed with
moystnesse, and the menstruis flows much in quantity.

5. Dryness of the womb is known by the contrary signs to moystnesse.

Moderate exercise and a good diet does well. Curatio. Exercitiu^.


1. If she be full of corrupt humors, purge her,

2. If the menstruis be stopped, look back into the Chapter of Mensium
suppressio.

3. If coldness be the cause, Fomentatio
make a fomentation of penniroyal, aniseed, and cumminseed, let her drink
Castoreum, and the juice of sage in wine.

4. If heat be the cause, cool and moysten, with lettice, plantin, purslain,
and gourds; Aq. sperm. ranarum.
to make a decoction, or boil them in broth; But Aqua sperm. ranarum, is
excellent.

5. If moystnesse be the cause, let her exercise, purge, and use a dry diet,
and sometimes give her a cup of restrictive wine, wherein sage is boiled and
steeped.

6. If dryness be the cause of barrenesse, use those things that moysten.

7. Hierapicra.
If gross humors be the cause purge her with Hierapicra in whey or the like,
labor and sweating is good.

8. If witdninesse, look into the Chapter of uteri Inflatio.

9. If through too much straightness of the matrice, look into the Chapter
Vteriphimosis.

10. Fomentatio
If through gaping of the mouth of the matrice, let her use a dry diet, and
fomentations of the decoction of pomegranate rinds, quinces, myrtils brambles.
Acatia, etc.

11. If the matrice be writhed, use mollifying pessaries Paulus says that
carnal lust used backward, is good to conceive. Faul^^.


CHAP. XXIX.
DIFFICILIS PARTVS: Causa.
hard travel in childbirth, chances either through default of the parent, of
the child, of the secundine, or through some outward cause.

1. Of the parent, as if she be gross, fat, fainthearted, and unskilful of
pain, or if the matrice be small, inflamed, or vexed with some other disease.
Or if she be naturally weak, or labor before time: or if the neck of the
matrice be crooked, or some piece of flesh engendered there, of a bile or ulcer
going before.

2. Default of the child is, when it is of an unaccustomed bigness or if it
have two heads, or three feet. Or if it be dead, or if they be two or more: or
weakness of the child, may be the cause.

3. The travel is made difficile through the secundine: If it be not pulled
away, because of the grossenes of it: or if it break before it should, because
of the thinness of it, and so the privities are left without moisture, which
should make a slippery passage for the child.

4. Also it is caused of outward causes, as of cold, that thickens the matrice,
and streightneth the passages: or through a great heat that dissolveth and
weakneth the strength.

1. Outward causes are easily known by the telling of the Patient, Signa.
or them that sit by them.

2. Weakness of the child is known by its flow motion.

3. Greatness of the child may be known by the greatness of the woman's body,
and the bigness of the Parents themselves.

4. Grosseness and thickness of the secundine, is known thus; none of the
aforesaid signs are present, and the woman is strong, and the child stirs
lively.

1. The signs of a birth at hand, is pain under the navel at the groine, and
loins, the Genitals swell with pain, and a certain fever like shaking, invades
the body: the face waxes red by reason of the endeavor of nature, armed unto
the expulsion of the infant. Also when the infant by kicking, breaks the
membranes, so that the humors run out, is a certain sign the child is at
hand: If the infant come forth with those waters, the birth proves easy.

2. The child in the womb until it be fully formed, sends forth his urine by
the passage of the navel or Vrachus: but a little before the time of
childbirth, the Vrachus is closed up, and then the man-child voydeth it by the
conduit of the yard, and the woman child by the neck of the womb.

3. This urine is gathered together in the coat Chorion or Allantoides or
Farciminalis (being all one membrane) together with other excrements as sweat;
and wheyish superfluities of the menstruall matter.

4. He voyds two sorts of excrements, namely urine, and sweat; in both which he
swimmes.

5. If the woman have a man-child she is merry, strong, and better colored:
The males stir in three months and a half, her right parts are strongest to
every work or motion of the body. The right dug sooner waxes hard; and that
child stirs most on the right side, if she have a female, contrary signs
appear.

1. There be three concoctions, the first is performed in the stomach, which
being driven down into the intestines, is voyded by the fundament.

2. The second comes from the liver, and is threefold, first choleric, a
great portion whereof is sent to the bladder of the gall, and part is expelled
by sweat. The other is like whey which goes with the blood into the veins, to
nourish the whole body, and part thereof is expelled by sweat and urines. The
third is the melancholy excrements, which being drawn by the milt, the purer
part nourishes the milt, and the remnant is purged by the Hemorroidal veins,
and partly sent to the orifice of the stomach, to instimulate appetite.

3. Thelast concoction is absolved in the habit of the body; and breathed out
by insensible transpiration; is partly consumed by sweat, and other passages,
as the brain unloadeth it self by the nose, mouth, ears, eyes, palate bone, and
sutures of the scull.

Lastly, Signa.
if the child be dead in the womb, it moves not: the woman's belly is cold,
having great pain about the navel,

2. Also the waters are flowed out, and the secundine come forth: which are
certain signs of a dead child: Because the child breathing by the arteries of
the navel, and the breath being received by the cotylidon of the arteries of
the womb; It must of necessity come to pass (when the secundine is separated
from the infant) that no air or breath can come unto it.

3. Moreover the child will be more heavy to the mother, falling like a stone
to that side the mother inclines her body: she is vexed with sharp pains from
the privities even to the navel: with a perpetual desire of making water, and
going to stool, because nature is wholly busied in expulsion: The Genitals are
cold, as well as the womb.

3. The child corrupts in three days, and sends vapors up to the brain,
and heart, etc. which causes often swounding: Her dugs do fall, and her body
is more puffed up then before.

5. If she be weak, having a feeble pulse, a cold breath, a livid and ghastly
color: cold sweats, and cold in the extreme parts, then judge death is nigh.

1. For the cure of hard travel in childbirth, Curatio.
First place her in such a posture as is fit; namely on a stool or chair, that
is hollow and lyned with cloth (and covered with linning) made on purpose, or
else place her on a bed, in posture like one that is ready to be cut of the
stone.

2. Then let the midwife anoint the mouth of the matrice with unsalted butter,
oil or hens-grease, and open it wide by little and little, having her nails
pared close, and her rings taken off, if she have them on.

3. A fearful woman must be comforted, and encouraged, commanding her to hold,
and stop her breath strongly.

4. If adstriction be the cause, as through cold, foment with decoction of
mallows, fenegreek, etc.

5, If she be very weak give her foam cordial, and let her smell to vinegar.

6. If the infant be overgreat, make the mouth of the matrice as wide as you
can.

7. If an unnatural form of the child be the cause, bring him to a natural
form, partly by putting back, drawing to you, partly by turning, and partly by
making it straight; the midwifes arms being bare all the time, and well well
anointed with some fat thing.

8. If there be 2, or 3, bring out that which seems most ready, driving back
the rest.

9. But if it be dead, and the Physicians cannot prevail (with potions, baths,
fumigations, sternutatories, vomits and pessaries) to expel the dead child: It
must then be done by chirurgical extraction (if the woman be able to endure the
same) with instruments made on purpose to tear in pieces, if necessity require
the same.

10. If the tunicle or secundine be very thick and strong, cut it.

11. If the humor contained in the tunicle or secundine, comes away, so that
the places are dried up, and a hard labor like to follow: wash it all about
with the whites of eggs: and with the decoction of mallows and fenegreek, or.
Olei ex seminibus lini.i.ss. Linimentum.
olei de castoreo. ss. olei liliorum. ss. Galliae moschatae.iij. ladani.j. fiat
linimentum.

12. Also this powder following is much commended, as an universal remedy to
help all that have sore travel in childbirth.

. Ginnamomi elect.. ij. myrrhae, cassiae lig. Pulvis.
ana,j. succini alb..i. ss. fiat pulvis. If you please you may add dictamni.
i. ss. sacchari albi ad pondus omnium: but it is better without if they will
take it, let them take. j. in pure odoriferous wine.

13. If the secundine stick to some part of the matrice, draw it out by little
and little, but not violently; your arm being warm, and well anointed.

14. But if the neck of the womb be shut, Fomentatio
use somentations that can mollify and release.

15. If she be strong let her sneese, Sternutamentum.
with castore^m and pepper; use fumigations, and the same things you would use
to procure the terms.

16. Sees in a pot motherwort, Ireos, savin, penniroyal, calamint, dictamnus,
and such like, put the pot under a close chair, upon the which let the woman
sit; If the womb will not open with this means, whereby you may draw away the
secundine, yet it will rot and turn into matter, and so fall away.

1. When the woman is delivered, give her 2, or 3, spoonfulls of oil of sweet
almonds, Ol amigdal. dulcium.
extracted without fire, or cullises, or gellies.

2. Let the secundine be presently drawn away (before the neck of the womb be
closed, according to the former directions.

3. Then must the navel-string be tied with a double thread, an inch from the
belly; let not the knot be two hard, lest that part of the navel-string without
the knot should fall away sooner then it ought: neither too slack, or loose,
lest that an exceeding and mortal flux of blood should follow after it is cut
off: when the knot is made, the navel-string must be cut in sunder the breadth
of two fingers beneath it with a sharp knife: upon the section you must apply a
double linen cloth, dipped in oil of roses or sweet almonds, to mitigate the
pain, for so within a few days after, that which is beneath the knot, will
fall away being destitute of life, and nourishment; By reason the umbilical
vein and artery are tied so close, that no life nor nourishment can come into
it: commonly midwifes do let it lie unto the bare belly of the infant, whereof
comes grievous pain and griping by reason of its coldness: being destitute of
heat: but it were better to roll it in soft cotton, or lint, until it be
mortified, and so fall away.

4. Then the child must be wiped and cleansed from all filth with oil of roses
or myrtills; being first washed with warm water and wine, wherein is boiled the
leaves of roses red, and myrtils; adding thereto a little salt is excellent:
some use this lotion 5, or 6, days together, with very good success; for it
washes away all the filthy matter.

5. If there be any passages stopped, or covered with a membrane, as often
happens to the ears, nostrils, mouth, yard, womb, and fundament: It must be
cut, and tents put in to keep it open.

6. And if the ligamental membrane under the tongue be short and stiffer then
it ought; it must be amended by an expert Chyrurgion.

7. If there be a chalky substance, both in color and consistence, that
sticks on the inner side of the mouth (which the Frenchmen call the white
Cancer) cleanse it with a linen cloth bound to a little stick, and dipped in
a medicine made with oil of sweet Almonds, Medicamentum.
honey, and sugar: This cancer will not permit the child to suck.

8. Also give the child a spoonful of oil of sweet Almonds, extracted without
fire, and rub the inner side of the mouth therewith.

9. If the child be troubled with fretting in the guts, apply moist or sweaty
wool, macerated in oil of cammomel.

10. Children ought not to be weaned before their teeth appear.

11. Those that are scabby all over the heads, face, or body, voyding many
excrements, are like to be strong and sound of body.

12. Those that are fair of body, gather the matter of many diseases in their
bodies, which in time will appear. Certainly by the sudden falling of such
matter into the back bone, many become crook-backt.

1. The belly of the woman must be bound about with a ligature, made of
indifferent breadth and length, to keep out cold (which brings hysterical
suffocations, painful frettings in the guts, and a fever with other mortal
diseases) and to press out the blood.

2. Then give her some capon broth, or caudle, with saffron, and to keep the
belly from wrinkling,.

CHAP. XXX.
IS CHIAS in Greek: (...)
The barbarous sort call it Sciatica: It is a grievous pain which chances
about the joint, which the Greeks call Ischion, the Latins Coxa; in English the
Hucklebone.

1. A plentiful phlegmatic humor, Causa.
that is cold, gross, and viscid, flows down into this joint.

2. The pain not only troubles the leg, but entering very deep, is extended to
the muscles of the buttocks, the groines, knees, and very ends of the toes: yea
oftentimes it vexes the Patient with a sense of pain, in the very Vertebra of
the loins.

3. The cause of such wandering pain, is to be referred to the manifold
distribution of the nerves, which come to the joint from the loins and
holy-bone.

4. Continual rawness and unmeasurable using of venereous acts do not a little
help: Also neglect of exercises, and a slux suddenly stopped may be the cause:
sometimes there is a flatulency, mixed with the humor that runs into the
cavity of this joint.

There is a bitter and violent pain in the Hucklebone, Signa.
some have pain about the privy members; and the bladder being vexed, they
have difficulty of pissing: The whole leg from the haunch to the heel,
suffers pain, yet oftentimes no swelling, redness, nor distemper, manifest
to the eye. Lastly, the ligamentous bodies moystned, with this excrementious
humor, become loose, whence succeeds lamenesse, and at last a hectic fever.

First, Curatio. Venae sectio
if there be an inflammation, and the Patient full of blood, open the Basilica
on the grieved side for revulsion; and then for evacuation of conjunct matter,
the Vena Ischiadica; on the one side of the Ankle. If the pain be most in the
inside, take the Sapheia on the inside of the Ankle; Also acrid clysters are
good: If there be no ulcers in the guts, or Hemorrhoids,. Clyster.

Also Pilul. arthritic. is good: vomiting is commended, and sweating, with the
decoction of Guaiacum, and Sarsaeparilla. If heat molest, bath first with
vinegar, and then with oil of roses. For attractives use emplasters of pitch,

you want more, search the following Chapter.

CHAP. XXXI.
ARTHRITIS in Greek, (...)
in Latin Articularis morbus; the joint sickness: It is a disease harming the
substance of the joint, by the falling down of a virulent matter; endued with
a malign and venenate quality; accompanied by four humors; There are ten in
number.

1. Siagonagra, of Siagon. a jaw, (...).
is when the virulent matter falls upon the joint of the Jaw.

2. Trachelagra, of Trachelos, (...).
is that which affects the neck.

3. Rhachisagra, of Rhachis: the spine, is, (...).
when it troubles the backbone.

4. Omagra, of Omos, the joint of the shoulder; is when it molests the
shoulders.

5. Cleisagra, of Cleis; (...).
is when it affects the joints of the collar bones.

6. (...).
Pechyagra, so called for Pechys, which signifies the elbow.

7. Chiragra, of Cheir a hand.

8. Gonagra, of Gony, the knee.

9. Podagra, so called, for that the Greeks term the foot Pous: this gout is
most hard to help.

10. (...).
Ischias, so called, for that the Grecks term the Hip Ischion: of this gout I
have treated of in the former Chapter.

Abundance of raw humors is the cause of this disease, Causa.
occasioned by immoderate diet; and many other causes, which is to be found in
the other Chapter.

Those humors that do abound and fasten in the joints, either be sanguine,
choleric, phlegmatic, or melancholious: and sometimes engendered of the
commixtion of humors: The humor causing the gout is different from that which
causes a Phlegmone, edema, Erysipilas, or Scirrhus; Aetius.
for as Aetius says, it never comes to suppuration, like other tumors. The
reason I think is, because it happens in parts destitute of blood.

As soon as it falls into the spaces of the joints, Signa.
it causes cruel pain; one while with heat, as if they were burnt, another
while with extreme cold. Such as have this disease hereditarily, can no more be
freed therefrom, then those in whom the matter of the disease is become knotty:
as Ovid says well.

Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram.

The matter of the gout is a thin and virulent humor, yet not contagious;
offending rather in quality, then in quantity; instigating the humors,
together with flatulent spirits, prepared ready for defluction upon the
affected parts, do there cause extreme pains, that are intolerable.

1. I read of a Gentlewoman that had many terrible fits, by reason of a tumor
scarce equalling the bigness of a pease, on the outside of the joint of the
left hip: In her fit she did cry and roar, and rashly and violently threw her
body this way and that way above her nature, Thrusting her head between her
legs, and laid her feet on her shoulders, as if she had been possessed with a
devil, being most violent when the tumor was touched: yet all the quarter of
an hour the fit held, she had her senses, and no inflammation, no other
swelling did appear. At last a potential cautery was applied to the grieved
part or tumor; and after the fall of the eschar, very black and virulent sains
flowed out; which freed the woman ever after: whence you may gather the
malignity and venenate quality of the humor.

2. The matter of the gout comes for the most part from the liver or brain.
If from the brain, it is phlegmatic, thin, and clear; it passes out of the
muscles, skin and Pericranium, as also through the large hole by which the
spinal marrow (the brains substitute) is propagated into the spine, by the
coats and tendons of the nerves, into the spaces of the joints: and it is
commonly cold.

3. That which proceeds from the liver, is diffused by the great vein and
arteries; and participates of the nature of four humors.

1. If it flows from the head, there is heaviness, and dullness of the head;
with pain: the functions of the mind are hurt by the malignity of the humor:
The musculous skin of the head swells, with a certain oedematous tumor.

2. If from the liver blood and choler bear the sway, the veins are large and
swollen, the defluction is on a sudden; and through crudities it degenerates
into phlegm and a wheyish humor: if it degenerates into melancholy, the gout
resembles the nature of a Scirrhus; but it is rare to be found.

1. Melancholy causes numnesse, and a dull pain; the gout being of a livid or
blackish color.

2. A phlegmatic humor is also known by the color; being white like the
neighboring parts; giving place to the finger, it is cold, and the urine thin
and watery, and the pain is not very sharp.

3. The sanguine gout looks red, and the veins are puffed up by it.

4. The choleric, fiery or pale; the pain is sharp like lancing: he is eased
by cooling things, in the fit a fever takes him, he is thirsty, and his urine
yellow, many many times if the choler be acrid, a gangreen ceazeth on the
affected part.

5. If salt phlegm, there is itching, gnawing, and biting,

1. A gout healed, often leaves a palsy behind it.

2. They often desire venery, which is hurtful, because it dissipates the
spirits, and weakeneth the nervous parts, and exasperates the pain.

3. The great heat dissolves the seminal matter, which flowing to the genitals,
distends them.

1. Curatio. Theriaca. Avicenna.
Treakle is commended in all Arthritical affects, because it dries and wastes
the malignity thereof; so says Avicen. in lib. de there. ad pisonem. c. 15.

2. If blood be the cause, cut a vein on the opposite part; as if the right arm
be troubled with a gouty inflammation, Venae-sectio
open the Sapheia on the right leg; this is for revulsion and evacuation: If
this eases him not, open the vein next the pain, let him abstain from wine and
flesh.. Lac caprae. v. vitell. ovor. no 2. ol. rosar..j. Ca^aplas.
croci.ss. With the crumbs of bread make a cataplasme: stamping them well
together. Bathe with vinegar, and then with oil of roses.

4. After the body is once fed, they must not return to meats, before that the
concoction be perfected in the stomach (which is called Culina communis totius
corporis) lest the liver draw by the mesaraick veins, crude and ill digested
matter, and so deprive the body of its nourishment; for vitium prioris
concoctionis non potest corrigi per sequentes. Keep his body soluble with
clysters, Purgatio.
if a full body give a strong purge.

5. Vomitus.
For a choleric flux a vomit of Stibium is good; for vomiting in the gout is
commended, Potio purgans.
and purging is good with Electuarium e succo rosarum, in the common decoction:
and apply medicines that can cool and restrain, the medicine made with goats
milk described before is good: adding popy seeds. iij. or opium ss. leaves of
roses, nightshade, plantin, Hemlock, and henbane are good: In all hot gouts
apply clothes wet in Aqua sperm. Aq. sperm. ranarum.
ranarum: for it is a singular remedy.

6. When you are forced to use stupefactive medicines in vehement pains,
nourish and recreate the part afterward, with things that do heat, as origan,
savorie, etc.

7. In all gouts, things that are diureticall are commended.

8. Vomitus. Purgatio.
For a phlegmatic flux, a vomit of Asaron is good: or a purgation downward is
the safest way, the making of which you shall find in the former Chapter: But
first extenuate the humor with oximel scillitic. Oximel.
or the like: Let him abstain from meat often: Cataplas
desolving fomentations are good, take mallows boiled in milk, and stamped,
adding thereto saff^on, goosegrease, and wheat bran, to make a poultis: or
Arkangel stamped with white wind vinegar, is good: or. Vnguentu^.

CHAP. XXXII.
MORBVS SPINALIS, (...).
vel spinae dorsi: The disease of the spine of the back: In English, the
Rachites, or the Rickets.

1. The primary essence of this disease, consists not in the animal
constitution, or in that which depends upon the influx of the brain into the
parts.

Nor in the vital constitution, or in that which depends upon the influx of
the heart into the parts: But this disease consists in the natural
constitution, being rooted in the similary constitution of the natural parts.

1. Those parts that are primarily affected, do labor under a notable cold
distemper, with penury and stupefaction, or benumednesse of spirits: many
famous physicians have attributed the first essence of this disease to the
liver; but it will be proved otherwise, for it is one thing to produce a common
cause of a disease, and another thing to be the first essence of a disease.

The affect of the liver does follow this disease, and its substance is
augmented in this affect: But in dissected bodies it has been seen inculpable,
in respect of the other conditions; neither is the liver grievously and
evidently (throughout the progress of the disease) afflicted: neither does it
labor under a cold and moist distemper; for if it did, the face could not be
so well colored, and the cheeks so ruddy: moreover the debility of the
muscles, and the dislike of exercise, seems not to have any correspondence
with the liver.

The lungs cannot be admitted for the first seat of this disease.

1. For the narrowness of the breast does not presently arise from the very
beginning of the disease.

2. Neither does the Asthma perpetually accompany this affect.

3. The cough is sometimes present, and sometimes absent.

4. An inflammation of the lungs does not presently afflict the Patient.

5. Hard swellings, impostumes, and bunches may follow; for they are common to
men as well as children.

6. The ptisick comes after a long continuance of this affect, being far from
the essence of this disease.

7. The impotency of the external parts to motion, and the inequality of
nutrition, cannot be deduced from the affected lungs.

1. The spinal marrow issuing out of the skul, does seem to discern the first
place.

2. The second all the nerves produced by it.

3. The third all the membranous and fibrous parts, unto which those nerves are
carried along; In these alone, the first essence of this disease is rooted.

The softness, looseness, and Atony of the whole spine, without the skull, of
all the nerves arising from thence, of all the fibers of the universal body, do
cause inability to motion, slothfulness, and affectation of rest, which bewray
themselves from the very beginning of this affect; do abundantly evince the
parts to be affected with coldness, defect, and benumednesse of spirits.

2. The secondary essence of this difease is radicated in the natural
constitution; and also in the vital, which are both vitiated in this affect:
The secondary essence, has a dependency upon the primary. The secondary
essence of this disease, is likewise in the animal constitution; which is that
affection of the body, consisting in the generation and due motion of the
animal spirits, by which is understood the excursion of them from the brain
through the nerves like lightening, and again their recourse back to the brain,
whereby they declare unto it, what is perceived by the organs of the outward
senses.

Now by reason the animal spirits have their passage through the first affected
parts, namely through the spinal marrow without the skull, through the nerves
from thence proceeding, and through the parts into which those nerves are
distributed, and seeing that all these parts in this affect do labor with a
cold distemper, with a paucity and dullness of inherent spirits, the animal
constitution must needs be vitiated, and the activity of the spirits in some
degrees retarded, and yet the sense is not vitiated; for almost the gentlest
motion of the nerves, is sufficient for sense, but not for motion; because the
latter requires a greater strength and vigor of the nerves.

The parents may be troubled with Cachexia, Causae. Febris alba.
the dropsy, the green-sicknesse, which some call the white fever: The scurvy,
French pox, and the jaundies, which corrupt the blood, that cannot be changed
into laudable and fruitful seed: so that infants may borrow a disposedness
(from their parents) to this affect: But it cannot be comprehended under the
species of an hereditary disease, properly so called; for that consists in
the formation. This disease according to its primary essence is a similary
disease, as before demonstrated.

1. Yet in many children, this disease does fall under a second species of an
hereditary disease, improperly so called, as when the parents are troubled with
the diseases aforesaid.

There is also many times in the parents penury of natural spirits, as
happens after large evacuation in fluxes, which wastes the strength, and is
not repaired before coition; especially a consumption, or hectic fever; a
Gonorrhaea, or a cold, or a moist distemper of the genitall parts, and womb; or
excessive sleepiness of the woman with child, or slothfulness and ease, may be
the cause of this disease.

2. A cold and moist air does powerfully contribute to this disease, which
easily happen to such children as are born near great Rivers, Ponds, or Meers:
So does an extreme hot and subtle air, for that allureth forth, and consumes
the inherent spirits: Also a plentiful diet may be the cause.

3. Likewise a stupidity and sluggishnesse of the first affected parts, a
defect of motion, and want of exercise, immoderate sleep; and on the contrary,
inordinate watching may be the cause.

Also things preternaturally retained, as if choler abound and luxuriate in the
body, for it dissipates the natural spirits. Likewise terrene dregs of the
belly, a sour humor, and also phlegm may be the cause: immoderate sweating does
much dissipate the spirits. Precedent diseases may be the cause, as a
phlegmatic Cachocymi. Hepaticus fluxus.
A Cachexia, a dropsy, immoderate vomiting, Lyentery, Dysentery, the Hepatical
flux, Diabetes, excessive sweating, a feeble appetite of the ventricle, an
obstruction or scirrhus of the mesentery, sweetbread, spleen, or liver; also
an opoplex, palsy, or lethargy.

It is possible for this disease to happen to those of full growth, being
conjoined with another, which is the primary cause; although it seldom comes
to pass, because of their continual exercise.

The magnitude of the head, the leanness of the joints, the crookedness of
the shank bone, or the elbow, the inflexions of the joints, and the sharpness
of the breast, do not accompany this disease presently, but in process of time
they bewray themselves, there is a consumption of the parts which is only a
symptom, and not a disease.

Some are so gently affected with this disease, as you would scarce suppose
them to be sick; they ear, they drink, and sleep like those that are healthful,
only they play with more unchearfulnesse, and show forth some slight signs of
sickness, and yet by the only benefit of nature, without any assistance of art,
they recover.

The Rachites degenerate often into a consumption, a Hectic, or into a slow
putrid fever.

The usual companions of this malady are Hydrocephalus, the fault of breeding
teeth, an Asthma, Pthisis, Hectica febris, a slow and erratical fever, and
Ascites, etc. yet these may happen, although the Rachites have not preceded.

Lastly, such as have little or no dependence upon this affect, are a malignant
fever, the French pox, the scurvie, and the strumatical affect, which do
sometimes associate this evil, and yet they are all distinct from this.

The dogmatical signs relating to the animal actions, are these, Signa.
the looseness and softness of the parts, the debility and languidness, and
finally, the slothfulness and stupefaction.

1. First a certain laxity, and softness, if not a flacciditie of all the first
affected parts, is usually observed in this affect: the skin is soft, and
smooth to the touch: the joints are easily flexible, and many times unable to
sustein the body; for the most part they speak before they walk, if they be
infested with it the first year, which among us is held to be a bad Omen.

2. But if they be afflicted with this disease after they have begun to walk,
by degrees they stand more feeble upon their legs, they stagger and stumble at
every small occasion, and cover sitting.

3. Upon a vehement increase of this disease, they totally lose the use of
their feet, being not able to sit with an erected posture, and the weak and
feeble neck does scarce, or not at all sustain the burden of the head.

4. A kind of slothfulness and numbness does invade the joints, and presently
after the beginning of the disease, and by little and little is increased: The
younger that are carried in the nurses arms, do not laugh heartily, when they
are delighted and pleased with any thing: neither do they kick or cry so
fiercely, when they are angered: when they are committed to their feet, and the
disease prevails, they are averse from all motion of their limbs.

5. They are moderate in sleeping, and waking, ingenious, not stupid; but for
the most part of forward wits, unless some other impediments arise. Their
countenance is more composed, and severe, then their age requires; as if they
were ruminating upon some serious matters; these signs being taken do
constitute a sufficient Pathogonomonical Syndrom, or concourse of symptoms; of
the first kind, which relate to the animal actions.

1. Of how great moment the Alogotrophy, or unequal nourishment of the parts,
in this affect; we have already demonstrated.

2. Secondly there appears the unusual bigness of the head, and the fullness
and lively complexion of the face, compared with the other parts of the body:
yet there is a Cacotrophy, or vicious nourishment, proper to this affect.

3. Thirdly, the fleshie parts are daily more and more worn away, made thin
and lean, which excellently demonstrateth the motion and degree of this
disease, by its increase; This sign being joined with the former, does at least
constitute a Pathognomonical sign of the second kind, that is such a one as is
proper to this disease alone.

4. Certain swellings, and knotty excrescences, also carruncles, knobby
swellings, and hard bunches of flesh about some of the joints, are observed in
this affect; chiefly conspicuous in the wrists; and somewhat less in the
Ankles: the like are in the tops of the Ribs, where they are conjoined with
grissles in the breast and stern. These tumors are situated in the very
bones, which witnesses the species of the disease.

5. Some bones are crooked, as the spine bone, the shank bone, the Fibula, or
small bone in the leg; then afterward the greater shank bone, and the lesser
bones of the elbow: the bones of the head stick out. Hippocrates
But in health according to Hippocrates, (...), The bones do give unto the
body, stability, uprightness, and form or fashion.

6. The stern is elevated, that it may yield room to the augmented bulk of the
liver.

7. The former parts of the Ribs are more soft then the hinder, and do more
easily receive their aliment, and augmentation then the harder: so that the
foremost parts of the Ribs, which are soft, are more lengthened then the
undermost. The teeth come forth slowly, with trouble; and then oftentimes wax
loose and black, falling out by pieces, and new ones come again: though late,
with pain.

8. The breast becomes narrow (in the higher progression of the disease) on
both sides, and sticks out like the breast of an Hen, or Capon, which indeed
may somewhat happen in an Atrophy, or a defective nourishment of the parts: but
it can scarce so fall out according to the change of the figure, without an
Alogotrophy; this must also be reputed a Pathognomonical sign of the second
kind.

9. Again, a swelling of the Abdomen, and an extension of the Hypochond parts,
which hinder the free motion of the Diaphragma downwards, and consequently
interrupt the breathing, proceeding partly from the windiness of the stomach
and guts, and partly from the bigness of the liver, and other bowels.

10. A cough is frequent, and stoppings, hard tumors, impostumes, and
inflammations of the lungs, is usual; and there is a lateral growing of the
lungs in the Plura, which partly is the cause of the vitiated figure of the
breast: They are averse from lying on their sides, either because of the
coalescence of the lungs with the Plura, or by reason of some tumor; but these
are not conspicuous, whilst the child is living: The pulse in the wrists are
small and weak.

11. Their excrements of the belly and bladder, do resemble theirs that are in
health; they loathe sweet things, they weigh heavier then others that are in
health, of the same age and stature.

12. The Hydrocephalus is known by dullness of the senses, the magnitude of the
head, the sutures do gape more wide, the bone in the forehead sticks out,
there is a water outwardly contained undet the Pericranium: for the signs of
other diseases, which are usually complicated with this affect, look into their
proper Chapters.

The observations collected from the dissection, and inspection of bodies
subdued by this disease, are these.

1. The Abdomen being opened, the liver has exceeded in bigness, yet well
colored, and not much hardened.

2. The spleen for the most part is not to be contemned, whether you consider
the magnitude, the color, or the consistence of it.

3. The stomach and guts are somewhat more infected with flatulent humors,
because of the extension of the Hypocondriacal parts.

4. The mesentery is somewhat faultlesse, and sometimes affected with
glandulous excrescencies, and sometimes with swelling bunches.

5. The sweetbread is suspected to be obstructed, and to have a Scirrhus.

6. The kidneys, uriters, and bladder, are laudably sound, unless there be a
concomitancy of other diseases.

1. The stern being withdrawn, there is perceived stoppings or stuffings of the
lungs, which always more or less grows with the Plura; some have glandulous
knobs or bunches, though but seldom.

2. In the cavity of the breast, is sometimes seen, a collection of wheyish
waters, and more frequently then in the cavity of the Abdomen.

3. Sometimes all the lungs on the left or right side (though seldom) is
infected with an impostume, so that being crushed, they yield a copious, thick,
and stinking matter; of a yellowish color, and in the impostume is contained
much water.

4. The kernel in the cavell bone is always observed to be great.

1. The skull being sawed through in a circular figure, and the little cover
being opened, you may observe the Dura matter to be firm, and adhered to the
skull in many places.

2. Between the Dura matter, and the Pia matter, and in the very ventricles of
the brain, is sometimes found wheyish and waterish humors, which is the cause
of the Hydrocephalus.

3. The Carotides and the jugular veins, exceed in many, their just
proportion: but the arteries and veins, are usually slender in this affect.

1. The prognostical signs are these; the disease properly natural; or if it
invadeth before the birth, is the most dangerous, and seldom end in health.

2. The more early the invasion is after the birth, the more dangerous the
disease is.

3. Elder children that go up and down, are more easilier cured then young
infants that cannot use their legs.

4. This disease proceeding from some other foregoing affects, is more
dangerous then that which is introduced by an erroneous regiment of health.

5. This disease chiefly invadeth the cradles of the Gentry, who live at great
ease.

6. The greater the head is, the longer and harder is the cure.

7. The weaker the back bone is, the greater and the more dangerous is the
affect.

8. The great swellings in the bones of the wrists, and the ends of the ribs,
the crookedness of the shank bone, the shoulder bone, or the bone of the arm;
and the great inflexion of the joints, do presage the continuance of the
disease.

9. If the Hydrocephalus be complicated with the Rachites, it ever imports
great danger; If the sutures of the brain-pan, do gape and water, get into the
middle spaces, and swell the the Dura matter into a waterish and soft tumor, it
is mortal.

10. A painful breeding of teeth is sometimes accompanied with most vehement
symptoms, and even threatens death: but the dog tooth portends more danger in
this disease.

11. An Asthma, especially the Orthopny, Othopnaea.
in which the Patient cannot draw breath, but with an erected neck, is very
dangerous; for that prompteth to a suspicion of some tumor, impostume, plurisy,
or inflammation of the lungs, or some growing of the lungs with the Plura.

12. If the ptisick be complicated with this affect, it is for the most part
mortal.

13. This disease in time changes into the ptisick, at least brings a
consumption to the destruction of the sick, unless some grievous affect and
symptom do intervene, and prevent by hastening death: as a convulsion, the
loud cough, the swelling of the lights, (vulgarly called the rising of the
lights) a fever, a plurisy, etc.

14. If a dropsy of the lungs, or an Ascites, be complicated with the
Rachites, it portends a desperate, and deplorable condition.

15. A hectic, slow, putrid, and continual fever, makes this disease
desperate.

16. If the venereous pox, be consociated with the Rachites; be it hereditary,
or contracted by infection, it is incapable of remedy.

17. The scurvie does very much retard the cure.

18. Strumatical tumors, internal or external, do not very much suspend the
hopes of cure.

19. Whosoever are not perfectly cured before the first five years of their age
be spun out, they afterward live but miserably and sickly; and being either
Asthmatical, cachectical, or ptisical, they die before they arrive at the
consistance of their age, or else they grow deformed, crooked, or dwarfish.

20. If scabs, wheales, pimples, or the itch, come after this affect, it does
hopefully expedite the cure.

For the cure, Curatio.
the method to practice is divided into (...), and (...), the Therapeutical and
the Prophylactical part, or the curative, and the preservative: The curative
part presupposes the Physiology, Pathology, and Semeiotical part, which
require a manifold exercise of every operation of the understanding.

1. Indication that noble instrument of the method of cure: Galen delivers to
be, Galenus.
an insinuation or declaration of the consequence, that is something to be
done: In this sense it may be defined to be an objective action of the
indicant, relatively considered, which represents to the understanding the
thing indicated: that is, what may be helpful, what hurtful, what elected and
applied, what forsaken, and avoided.

2. The indicant is a state of the body, as it is moveable, relatively
considered; namely, as it intimates what is to be done in that particular.

3. The thing indicated is a medical action (directing to health) required on
the part of the indicant.

4. There are nine things to be considered (according to Argenterius) in
indicated actions; Argenterius.
An? Quid? Qua materia? Quantum? quale? qu^modo? quando? ubi? quo ordine
agendum? That is, whether? what? with what matter? How much? of what kind?
after what manner? when? where? In what order a thing must be done?

These indicated actions, are found out by the force of indication: which
indication is referred to some generation of the understanding: They vainly
attempt the cure, who are ignorant that one thing is indicated from one
indicant; which indicant the understanding does comprehend, together with the
indicate in the indication according to Galens definition, Galenus.
(...). Item in alla definitione, (...).

1. For the indications curative, first this disease indicateth that those
things are to be avoided which cherish and augment the distemper: and such
things are to be implored, that may subdue the same, namely, hot and dry.

2. Secondly, Those things must be avoided, that can scatter and consume the
spirits: and such things must be elected, that have virtue to restore, cherish,
and multiply them.

3. Thirdly, those things that make thick, fix, or stupify the spirits, are to
be avoided; and all those things that can excite the spirits, and expel their
stupefaction are good; as exercises, motion, and frictions, etc.

4. Fourthly, those things are to be avoided that are wont to mollify, loosen,
and weaken the tone of the parts, and those things are to be given that can
render them more solid and firm.

5. Fifthly, a caution is to be had of those things which promove the flux of
blood toward the head: or retard the passage thereof to the first affected
parts: also choice must be made of such things as stir the pulses of the
arteries in the parts first affected, and that do excite the spirits to a
greater activity.

6. Sixthly, the unequal nutrition indicateth those things which promove the
even and impartial distribution of the alimentary heat to the extenuated parts:
The crookedness of the bones require such things as attract the aliment to the
hollow side, as frictions, etc.

7. Seventhly, Cephalicals, and such things as facilitate the distribution, as
exercise, and those things that corroborate and strengthen the parts, are good.

1. For the indications preservative, or the prophylactical part: they are
deduced either from the antecedent, or the present causes, the latter is
propounded.

2. The causes are either impurities, or excrementitious humors, (which are)
collected or impated in the first passages, which unless they be taken away,
do not only infect the nourishment inward, but they dull and hinder the
appropriate medicines: They indicate therefore an evacuation, either by a
gentle vomit, or by a lenetive purgation.

3. The head requires a particular evacuation; which usually is performed by
scarrification of the veins in the hollow of the ear: also blisters raised
between the first and second turning joint of the neck.

4. If the Cacochymical humors be unapt for motion, then medicines must be
used that do prepare such humors; more especially if tough and gross humors
be impacted, and settled in certain parts of the body; Hippocrat.
according to Hippocrates, Corpora quum quis purgare volet, ea fluxilia faciat
oportet, when you would purge a body, you must first make it fluxible, with
such a preparation, as has a peculiar reference to that part in which they are
inherent: for the humors in the liver require one kind of preparation, those
in the lungs another, etc.

1. Life it self consists in a triple constitution of the body, the natural
comprehends under it, first the temperament, secondly, the inherent spirits,
with their plenty and vigor: thirdly, the tone of the parts; fourthly, the
structure of the organs, fifthly, the continuity.

2. The vital contains first the generation, secondly, the distribution of
the vital spirits, thirdly, their participation with those parts unto which
they are distributed; namely, the union of them with the said parts, and the
communicated heat.

3. The animal comprehends first the generation, secondly the distribution of
the animal spirits: thirdly, the due stretching of the parts, depending upon
the influx of the brain: all these because life consists in them, are called
vital indications; which directs to the conservation of the animal, vital,
and natural constitution.

1. First, in this affect you shall make choice of the best nourishments, such
as are easy of concoction.

2. Secondly, cherish and strengthen the parts most affected.

3. Thirdly, gentle evacuations are good, the violent must be avoided.

4. Fourthly, prepare the tough humors before purging, Hippocrat.
according to Hippocrates, Quae movenda sunt fluida prius facere oportet.

5. Fifthly, let your remedy arrive at the seat, and penetrate to the very cause
of the disease.

6. Sixthly, if the humors be naturally apt to move upwards, expel them by
vomit: If downwards by siege: in like manner root out the causes by spitting,
by urine, and by sweating.

7. Medicines mingled with the nourishment, ought to be grateful to the
palate, lest they subvert the stomach, and hinder concoction.

8. The universal causes yet flowing to and fro in the body, being impediments,
must be first expelled.

9. We must relieve the more urgent and weighty indicant; first, unless there
be an interruption of some impediment.

The chyrurgions work is to scarrify the ears, make issues, raise blisters,
apply cupping-glasses, leeches; also ligatures and swathing bands are to be
used, to sustein and erect the bending of the joints and bones.

Many children are cured only by the means of issues: it is a powerful remedy
against the Hydrocephalus, both curative and preservative; and very much
conduces to lessen the magnitude of the head, and to evacuate the superfluous
water thereof: represseth the inordinate increase of the bones, and dries up
the too much humidity of the spinal marrow, exciteth heat, strengthens the
nerves, and expels the astonishment: the issue must be made between the
second and third turning joint of the neck.

To streighten the trunk of the body, or to keep it straight, they use to make
brest-plates of whale-bone, put into two woollen clothes, and sewed together,
but the best way is to fasten them to the spine of the back, with a handsome
string fitted to that use.

1. Those remedies that can cleanse, and wash the first passages, are clysters,
vomits, and lenitive purgations.

When the belly is costive, the excrements hardened, and windy humors torment
the guts, or some vehement pain in the bowels afflict the Patient; then
clysters are commended, as. Clyster.

ss. misce. fiat Enema.

2. Emedical remedies, or vomits, do chiefly perform three things; First, they
evacuate crude and corrupt humors, or impurities contained in the stomach.

2. Secondly, by an agitation, and commotion, they loosen the gross and viscous
humors, adhering unto the bowels and other parts; and unlock obstructions.

3. Thirdly, they most effectually irritate the expulsive faculty of all the
parts of the body; as the guts, liver, sweetbread, spleen, kidneys, lungs,
brain, etc. Finally, the whole body (by straining to vomit) is prone to a
Diaphoresis; either by a manifest sweating, or by an occult and insensible
transpiration: If the humors tend upwards of their own accord; and the child
be naturally, or customarily apt to vomit, then administer one, according to
the strength and age of the child, as. Infusionis croci metallor. in vino

4. Remedies preparatory, partly relate to the preparation of the humors
(which are either phlegmatic, thick, viscous, chollerick, melancholy, etc.)
partly to the ways through which they are to be expelled; and partly to the
passages themselves, which sometimes require Cephalicals, Hepaticals, and
pectoral preparations. The simples are these, Catalagus simplicium.
Herbae omnes capillares, Imprimis, Trichomanes, Ruta muraria; Spicae radicis
osmundae regalis; Polypodium murale, Phyllitis, Ceterach, Hepatica, Agrimonia,

For profuse and excessive sweating; mark what Hippocrates says, Hippocrates.
sudorem illum, qui praeter causam fluit, purgationem postulare. That that
sweat which flows away without cause, requires purgation. For which purpose
Rhubarb is most excellent, Rhabarb.
also French, and Rennish-wine is commended. But because according to Galen,
Galenus.
Vinum pueris inimicum, by reason it heateth above nature, and hurts the
head; Mix with it rose water, or put in Borrage, or roasted Apples, add a
little sugar, and nutmeg: Also Electuaries with steel, Electuariu^.
(If there be no cathar, cough, inflammation, plurisie, or flux) Diarrhod. abb.
Diatri. sant. and conserve of Barberies, are good.

For the painful breeding and aching of the teeth, vomiting is commended; or to
rub the teeth with a tobacco leaf moystened. Nurses use coral, but to rub the
gums with a marsh mallow root is better. If the pain be violent, use Laud. gr.
ss. as before. Laudan.


8. External remedies may be divided into two kinds, namely the manner of
exercise, and things externally applicable: Gentle exercises are referred to
the manner of lying down. To the agitation of the body in the cradle. To the
carrying them about in the nurses arms, and to sedendary pastimes.

1. First, lying upon the back, among all postures of the body, does chiefly
recede from exercise: and is almost only allowable in the extreme weakness of
the spirits, as in acute fevers, inflammation of the liver, spleen, lungs, in a
plurisie, in the growing of the lungs with the Plura, and an impostum, etc. The
simple lateral position contains somewhat more of exercise, to correct the
crookedness of the backbone, a little bag may be made to lay under the
gibbous part.

2. Secondly, rocking of the cradle in time of sleep, must be intermitted: This
kind of exercise is most profitable for weak infants, that can scarce stand
upon their feet.

3. The bearing them about in the nurses arms, is most agreeable to the same
children. Let the nurse sing, and wave the child to and fro; if it be strong,
to hold it up gently by the hands; if weak, under the arms; also rolling the
child upon a bed is good, or upon a table, laying a hard cushion underneath,
whereon the gibbous part may rest.

4. Sedendary games and pastimes are the least profitable.

Masculine exercises of greater note are referred to these three titles:
Exercitiu^.
To going, to an artificial hanging of the body, to friction, rubbing, and
contrectation of the Hypocondries, and the Abdomen. Let the nurse use frictions
with her warm hand upon the back bone, thighs, hips, legs, ankles, and soals
of the feet, but not on the gibbous part that sticks out, but on the hollow
part: Let the nurse sometimes lift up the bowels, and sometimes depress them:
sometimes remove them towars the right, and sometimes toward the left hand:
and sometimes thrust the tops of the fingers under the bastard ribs, thereby to
deliver the liver from any preternatural growing with the Peritonaeum; If any
such should chance to be: It easily happens by reason of the greatness of the
liver, and the stretching of the Hypocondriacal parts, whereupon the
Peritonaeum and the membrane of the liver are most nearly and strictly
conjoined, and so by the help of time may easily grow together.

Things to be externally applied are liquors, oils, liniments, ointments, and
plasters. First, 1. Fomentatio

the flowers of sage etc. and in the time of anointing, to mingle therewith oil
of Castoreum, and oil of nutmegs by expression, is excellent.

ACHOR, vel Tinea, (...).
or scald head: is a disease possessing the musculous skin of the head, or the
hairy scalp, and eating thereinto like a moth.

1. Furfur is also a kind of ulceration of the head, Furfur.
like a scurf or dandruff, and is like unto bran or oatmeal; some term it a
dry scall.

2. There is another called Ficosa, Ficosa.
a fig-like scall, because when it is despoyled of the crust or scab, which is
yellow; there appears grains of quick and red flesh, like to the inner seeds or
grains of figs, and casting out a bloody matter.

3. But Achor is properly an ulcerous scall, for it abounds with ulcers, which
are open with many holes, flowing with liquid saines, like the washing of
flesh; stinking, sometimes livid, and sometimes of a yellowish color.

4. If the holes be somewhat larger, Cerion. Favosa.
its called Cerion, or Favosa, (that is like a honey comb) The matter which
flows resembles honey in color and consistence.

They all proceed of a humor which is less or more vicious. Causa.

ALOPECIA, is baldness, (...).
or falling off of the hair; expert Physicians do reckon nine kinds of
defaults of the hair. First,

1. Contorsio, which is a curling or intangling of the hair. Secondly,

2. Decoloratio, a deformity of the color. Thirdly,

3. Quassatio, a splitting or cleaving asunder of the hair. Fourthly,

4. Fractio, which is a short breaking away of the hair, for it snappeth
asunder. Fifthly,

5. Atrophia, a drying away, or consuming of the hair, for lack of food.
Sixthly,

6. Canities, is when the hair before its due time becomes gray or white.
Seventhly,

7. Defluxio, which is a falling away of the hair, like as in them who lost
their natural heat, or recovered after a long continued sickness. Eighthly,

8. Phiasis, is when the hair is colored like a snake. The ninth and last is
this,

9. Alopecia I now treat of.

The causes of Alopecia, Causa.
are inflamed moystures, whereby the hair before was fed; which through
inflammation thereof is taken away.

If blood abound, open a vein, Curatio. Venae sectio Fomentatio

TORTVRA ORIS, called of Almansor, Contractio: it is untruly named the palsy,
for it is more nearer a cramp; yet if it proceed from moisture, it is a kind of
palsy; if through drowth, then it is a kind of cramp, and is commonly a sign
of death.

The chief cause springs, Causa.
as of that of the palsy, or cramp, called Spasmos, or else of cold, or some
angry passion.

The mouth and lips are contracted to the right or left side, Signa.
so that one eye is sometimes clear shut up; and the breath issues out at one
corner of the mouth.

For the cure, Curatie.
if you look into the Chapters of Spasmus, and Paralysis, you shall find plenty
of remedies; yet this bag following is much commended.. Sacculus.

OPHTHALMIA, (...).
is an inflammation of the coat Adnata, and consequently of the whole eye, with
beating, and great pain.

It may be caused either by a fall, Causa.
a stroke, dust, or small sand flying into the eyes: or by a defluxion of a
thin hot humor upon the eyes, or an inflammation of the Dura matter, or
pericranium, may be the cause.

The signs are great heat, Signa.
redness, and pain, which sometimes is so vehement, that it forces the eyes
out of their orb, and breaks them asunder: they are sometimes taken with
vomiting, which is a sign that the matter of the disease proceeds from the
stomach.

Their diet must be moderate, Curatio. Victus ratio Venae-sectio Galenus.
and of a cooling quality, and if nothing forbid, give him a gentle purgation,
and open a vein in the arm. But Galen commends the opening of a vein in the
forehead, to be a most speedy help. Then use repercussives, as. Collyrium.

CHAP. VI.
SVFFVSIO, vel cataracta, (...).
is a disease in which the Patient imagines that he sees black things: It is
the concretion of an humor into a thin skin under the horny coat, just against
the apple or pupil: or it is a corrupt water congealed like a curd betwixt the
Tunicles, and set before the sight of the eye, and the cristalline humor; so
that the sight is quite lost, weak, or somehat depraved.

Leucoma, or the web of the eye, Leucoma. Glaucoma.
is not much unlike the cataract: and also Glaucoma, which is, when the
cristalline humor is dry and thick, and the color of it is green, so that the
eyes seem green.

The causes of a cataract may be a fall, Causa.
stroke, heat, cold, or pain; by whose means the humor is drawn and gathered
together: or else vapors and humors ascending to the brain, and from thence
descending to the eyes, which in process of time, and by reason of cold, are
changed into water; and in the end becomes thick and congealed.

When the cataract is formed and ripe, Signa.
it resembles a thin membrane spread over the Apple or pupil; and appears in
color sometimes black, green, livid, citrine, and a quicksilver-like color,
which are all held uncurable, because it is very like that the optic nerve is
obstructed: But a chestnut, or a sky, or seawater color, with some little
whiteness, yield great hope of a happy and successeful cure.

At the first when it begins to breed, they seem to see many things, as
flies, hares, nets, and black things: sometimes every thing appears two, and
sometimes less than they are, and their sight is best in the morning: now if
this filme cover half the pupil, then all things show but by halfes: But if the
midst thereof be covered, and as it were the center of the cristalline
humor, then they seem as if they had holes or windows: but if it cover all,
then can they see nothing at all, but shadows of visible bodies, and that but
confusedly, and by conjecture.

He must abstain from wine, Curatio.
pease, beans, turnips, and especially from venery: Let his bread be seasoned
with some sweet fennel-seeds: Venae sectio
phlebotomy, and purging, if they be requisite, shall be appointed: Also
masticatories to be used in the morning; and frictions upon the eyelids are
commended. Bright shining things, as the Stars, the Moon when it is at the
full, Looking-glasses, Diamonds, etc. for the Patient to look earnestly upon
them, are said to dissipate a beginning cataract; also for this purpose,
Collyrium.
take two ounces of Damask rose water, warm it on the fire, and half a dram of
Aloes succotrine pulveris'd, mix them with the juice of Cellendine, as much as
suffices; drop three drops into the eye every night eight nights together. I
was taught this by a very good friend of mine, that held it for a great secret;

somewhat hard, then let the expert Chyrurgion touch it with a needle according
to art: The powder of a mowshell put into the eye upon a web, wastes it.

CHAP. VII.
LIPPITVDO, blear eyes: (...).
or blood-shot eyes, is nothing else but a certain white filth, flowing from
the eyes; which oftentimes agglutinates or joins together the eyelids.

Sometimes it is hereditary, Causa. Rhasis.
and then not to be cured: Rhasis says, that when the white of the eye is
turned to redness, it is caused of some salt humor, or super-abundance of
Rhume, with corruption of blood: Also excrementious phlegm may be the cause.

Some commend Emplast. contra rupturam, Curatio. Cucurbitulae.

AEGILOPS, (...).
fistula lacrymosa; or weeping fistula of the eye, it is in the corner thereof,
near unto the nose, where there is a glandule made for the receiving, and
retaining moisture; for the humecting the eye, lest it should dry by continual
motion: This glandule sometimes swells, impostumates, and ulcerates: by reason
of a sanguine, Causa.
or pituitous defluxion, falling violently from the brain, and in time it
rotteth the bone that lies under it.

There is for the most part a tumor of the bigness of a pease, Signa.
the which being pressed, flows with a sanious, serous, red, or white, and
viscid matter: In time they cause an Atrophia of the eye, in some blindness,
Prognostic.
and a stinking breath.

Some chirurgions cut up the uppermost skin, Curatio.
and wring or press out the impostume, which lies locked in a little bladder;
and cut it off as near as may be, the rest they take away with an actual
cautery: The same swelling does settle it self otherwhiles in the length of the
eyelids, yet both are to be helped with oat-meal, wine, and Tutiae, tempered
together in manner of a salve: Anchylops.
Anchylops somewhat differs from Aegilops, for that is a superfluous flesh in
the corners of the eye, whereto humors gather.

but if once it comes to be hard, it is scarce curable, and is hardly brought to
suppuration: The best way is to open them, and then to press forth the matter:
If the pimple be small, thrust it through with a needle and thread, and leave
the thread therein, of such length, that you may fasten the ends thereof with a
little Emplastrum gratia Dei, to the forehead; if it be on the upper eyelid;
or to the cheeks, if on the lower, you must draw forth a fresh one every second
day, as is usually done in chyrurgical Setons: Thus at length the swelling will
be destroyed, and made plain. Forestus, Tom. 1. lib. 11: obs. 45.
Forestus does much commend the fat of a cock to bathe the pimple called
Hordeolum with, and also the decoction of Cammomel.

CHAP. XI.
MYDRIASIS, (...).
is the dilatation of the pupil of the eye.

It happens either by nature, Causa.
as from the default of the first conformation, (which is uncurable) or by
chance as a blow, fall, or contusion upon the eye, which causes the offspring
of a humor, to flow down from the brain.

First open a vein, Curatio. Venae-sectio
then use cupping-glasses with scarrification, and frictions, whereby the
defluxion may be hindered: Take the blood of a turtle-dove, pigeon, or chickin,
reaking hot out of the veins, and pour it upon the eye; then apply thereto
this Cataplasme.. Parinae fabar. and hordei ana.. iij. ol. rosar. Cataplas.

CHAP. XII.
HYPOPYON, (...).
is the suppurate or putrefied eye.

Sometimes it is caused by a defluxion, Causa.
and sometimes it comes after an inflammation, sometimes by a stroke; through
which occasion a vein being opened, has poured forth blood thither, which may
presently be turned into pus or quitture.

Evacuate the matter (the Corea being opened) at the Iris, Curatio.
in which place all the coats meet, you may cleanse the ulcer with Hydromel or
the like.

There are diverse other affects of the eyes; as the Hydatis, Hydatis. Proptosis.
or fatness of the eyelids. Proptosis, or the falling or starting forth of
the eye. Chemosis.
Chemosis, or the turning up of the eyelids. Pterygion, Pterygion. Staphyloma
or web of the eye. Staphyloma, or grape-like swelling. These affects of the
eyes, and their cures, are also so well known to expert chyrurgions, that for
brevities sake I will omit them without giving you either the causes, signs,
or cures of them; because I have been large in the former affects of the eyes;
So that the cure of the former, may serve for the cure of these. Forestus.
If you desire to be further satisfied, see Forestus. Tom. 1. lib. 11. de morb.
occul. and palpeb.

CHAP. XIII.
DOLOR AVRIVM: pain of the ears, Causa.
is caused in some through cold taken in a journey, by cold winds (...) also it
chances to many through a hot distemper, or inflammation: sometimes sharp and
biting humors do cause pain in the ears.

If cold be the cause, Curatio. Clyster.
administer a sharp clyster, made with rue, balm, bettony, wormwood,
bay leaves, and rosemary; also a poultis of the same herbs, Cataplas.
with oil of cammomel would do well; and drop into the cares a little oil of
bitter almonds: make a cake of Rye-meal and water, when it is well baked split
it, and lay on English honey, apply it to the pained ears hot, and upon the cake
a hot brick or tyle, so do three or four times, I once used it with good
success.. Ol. amygd. dull. and Chamaem. an..i. ss. ol. Oleum.

CHAP. XIV.
SONITVS AVRIVM; sound and noise of the ears, is for the most part engendered
of windy vapors, Causa.
or of gross and clammy humors: It may be caused through weakness of the
members, and of outward things, as of cold, heat, or a blow on the head.

First purge with a dragm of head pills, Curatio. Pilulae. Sternutamentum.
if nothing prohibit: And let sweet fennel-seed be baked in his bread: Every
third morning let him take sneesing-powder, and drop into the ears every night
certain drops of oil of rue, Oleum,
and aniseed, and keep the ears stopped with cotton wool; This Electuary
following is good.. Electuarium.

Lastly, a dragm of Venus-treakle given in posset-ale (wherein rosemary is
boiled) is excellent. Forestus. Vinum.
Forestus does direct wine to be drunk in this affect; and the decoction of
Coriander seed prepared.

CHAP. XV.
SVRDITAS, and gravis auditus; deafness, (...).
and slow hearing; It does begin sometimes at ones birth, and sometimes
afterward.

It chances either through choleric humors, flying upwards, Causa.
or through crude and gross humors, stopping the hearing.

First administer a dragm of head pills, Curatio. Pilulae cochiae. Oleum.
or give him the infusion of senne, and sweet fennel-seed. Take an onyon, roast
it soft, stamp it, and strain out the juice, and mix it with a little fresh
goosgrease, and drop three or four drops at a time often into the ears, and
then stuff them with black cotton wool, and let him keep his head very warm.
The juice of coal-worts, mixed with white wind, is good for the same purpose:
Fumigatio. Stern tamentum.
Let him receive the fumes of frankincense, and amber into his ears. Also
provoke sneesing: Let him lean his ear upon a quill, or reed, having one end
made fit for the ear, and the other for the pot (let there be in the pot
wormwood, mints, marjoram, stoechas, rue, seeds of dill, and cummin sodden in
water) that the vapor may pass into the course of hearing: Oil of Rue, and
Castoreum, Ol. caster.
are good to drop into the ears, so is the vapor of vinegar taken with a
reed.. Scoriae ferri. j. decoq. Rondeletius in vino, Injectio.
quod postea injiciatur in aurem.

CHAP. XVI.
PAROTIDES: (...).
be inflammations, which are wont to issue in the kernels, which be by the
ears.

It is caused of abundance of hot blood, Causa.
which is either mixed with choler, phlegm, or melancholy: sometimes of humors
compact in the head, and sometimes Parotides breaks out in fevers.

If fullness of blood be the cause, Signa.
then there is vehement pain; if choleric blood, they seem much like
Erysipelas; if of melancholy blood, they do not vex with vehement pain, they
are hard, but do not look red: If of phlegmatic blood, in the swelling they be
raised sharp upward.

First cut the Cephalica vein on the same side, Curatio. Venae sectio Fomentatio
and make a fomentation with Fenugreek, Althaea, cammomel, and meal of Linseed,
to ease pain: Emplastru^.
Emplast. Oxycroceum, and melilot plaster is good, some have performed a
perfect cure with Argent. Vng. enul.
vivum. The ointment thereof being rubbed upon a plaster of melilot, and
applied two or three times: Lastly, this cataplasme following is very good..

cause, you may put Vng. Enulat. in the Cataplasme.

CHAP XVII.
OZAENA: (...).
is an ulcer in the inside of the nose, deep, stinking, and rotten, out of
which are sent forth a loathsome and stinking savor, with many crusty and
stinking excrements.

The cause is sharp and rotten humors, Causa.
which flow to the nostrils.

Let the head be dried and strengthened; Curatio. Pilulae cochiae.
but first purge him with one dragm of head pills: and. Omphacii.ss. cortic.

And to mitigate pain Weckerus ( in lib. 2. par. 2. page 423.) does commend
axungia gallinae cum ol. viol. and pauca cera.

CHAP. XVIII.
PROFLVVIO SANGVINIS ex naribus: flux of blood at the nose, Causa.
is caused by a twofold means, as internal, and external; external, as some
fall, a stripe, vehement exercise, and tarrying in the sun; of inward causes,
as plenty of blood, and thinness of the same, and sometimes great drinking of
wine.

You may know if it come through plenty of blood, Signa.
by a heavy pain in the head, much blood in the face, and by the redness of
the eyes.

First open a vein on the arm, Curatio. Venae-sectio
if nothing forbid, Then take a little bolearmeny, and Aqua sperm. ranarum; mix
them together, and spread them on a double cloth, and apply it to the temples:
and let the Patient snuff up a little of the water aforesaid, often cold: If
the Patient be ancient, and have lost much blood, comfort him with claret wi^e
burnt, Historia.
and sweetened with loaf-sugar. This course I did once take with an ancient
woman of fourscore years of age (that had lost so much blood that I feared
greatly she would die under my hands) and God cured her: There are many
excellent remedies to be found in the Chapters of other fluxes. Yet this
medicament following is of great use.. Medicamentum.

CHAP. XIX.
POLYPVS; (...)
is a fleshly matter growing in the nostrils, like unto a kind of carbuncle:
Hippocrat.
Hippocrates does affirm that it is uncurable.

Sometimes it is caused through gross humors descending to the nostrils,
Causa.
and sometimes it arises through a melancholy humor. Signa.


It is one while white, another while reddish, and adheres to the bone of the
nose^, and sometimes fills the nostril, hanging toward the lips, and resembling
the foot of a sea Polypus. There is also found sometimes a softmembrane, long
and thin, and is filled with a phlegmatic and viscid humor, which in
expiration hangs out of the nose, but is drawn in and hid by inspiration: It
makes one snuffle in their speech, and snort in their sleep.

Some kinds of Polypi are painful, hard, Curatio.
and resisting: having a livid or leading color, such must not be touched with
the hand: But apply this Anodine.. Olei vitell. ovorum.ij. lytharg. auri,
Anodyna.
and tutiae praep. an..j. succi plat. solani an.. j. lapid. haematit. and
camphorae an.. ss. Let them be wrought in a leaden mortar, and so make a
medicine to put into the nostril: Those that are soft, loose, and without pain,
are curable; some pluck them away with an instrument: but the best way is to
waste them away with Aqua fortis, or oil of vitriol, and then to ease pain,
take ung. de bolo, and nutritum: for a fleshly Polypus, some commend a Polypody
root to be put through it, to waste it.

CHAP. XX.
FOETOR ORIS: stinking of the mouth: it is caused for the most part through
putrefaction of the gummes, Causa.
or teeth: or through meat sticking still in the teeth: many times it comes
through a hot distemper of the skin of the mouth, sometimes through corrupt and
rotten humors sticking in the mouth of the stomach, sometimes ulceration of
the mouth, or lungs, is the occasion of the stinking breath.

If it chance through putrefaction of the gums, Signa.
or teeth, or meat sticking in the teeth, it is easily known. If through heat
in the mouth, there is felt thirst: If through vice in the stomach, the breath
is more stinking before meat, than after. Exulcerations of the lungs, are known
by extenuation of the body, and by coughing, etc.

Let his meat be easy of digestion, Curatio. Victus ratio.
if stinch of the mouth come through corruption of the gums, look into the
Chapter of the scurvie: If through ulceration of the lungs, look into the
Chapter of Ptisis. Vomitus.
If it proceeds from the stomach, administer a vomit, and then strengthen the
stomach with Aromat. Aromat. rosat. etc.
rosat. Diambre, etc. If through ulceration of the mouth, look into the
following Chapter.

CHAP. XXI.
APHTHAE, (...).
are certain ulcers bred in the uppermost part of the mouth, and are by the
Barbarians called Acola: they have a certain burning heat; some be whitish,
some be reddish, and some be blackish, and those be most perilous of all other.
They engender for the most part in children, Causa.
Causa.
when either the nurses milk is naught, or the child cannot well digest it.
These ulcers sometimes chance to them that be of perfect age, caused by a flux
of vicious and sharp humors.

The tokens are easy, they which be red, Signa.
do show blood to have the mastery, yellowish, signify bitter choler,
whiteness, phlegm, blackness, melancholy.

This gargarisme following will serve for the cure, if the ulcers be not
malign. Curatio.

DOLOR DENTIVM; the toothache: It is caused sometimes through a hot or cold
sometimes through flowing of humors out of the head, unto the roots of the
teeth; which through their sharpness do gnaw about them.

In a hot distemper the whole body is hot, Signae.
and the face red, cold is known by the contrary judgments. If through the
flowing of some humor, then there is pain, not only in the teeth, but also
into other parts which it passes by. An hot humor ingendreth vehement pain, a
cold humor causes less pain.

If it come of cold, Curatio.
wash the teeth with warm wine, or this Gargarisme following.

vehement, seethe in vinegar the seeds of lettice and poppy. Oleum.
And bathe the cheeks with oil of roses, and water lillies. If through flowing
of humors, cut the Cephalica or media, Venae-sectio

CHAP. XXIII.
DENTES DENIGRATI, and molles. Causa.
Teeth that be black and loose, happen through the flowing of vicious humors;
and sometimes through a stripe or fall, sometimes through flowing of moisture,
which does loose the sinews and ligaments, and so does make the teeth loose; or
else gnawing, and weakness of the gummes, in which the teeth are set, may be
the cause. Also the scurvie.

You must begin with purging; Curatio.
then use Dentifrices.. Fulvis pro dentifricio

Then make a collution to fasten the teeth with red roses, Lotio.
mints, plantin, the barks of cypress nuts, seeds of myrtyls, Sumach, Acacia,
pomegranate-rinds, and restrictive wine. If the scurvie causes the looseness
of the teeth, look into the Chapter of the Scurvie, for there is plenty of
remedies. Lastly,. Pulvis.

CHAP. XXIV.
EPULIS; (...).
is a fleshly excrescence of the gums, which by little and little often times is
increased to the bigness of an egg, so that it does hinder the speech, and
eating. It casts forth Salvious and stinking filth, and not seldom degenerates
into a Cancer, which you may understand by the propriety of the color, pain,
and other accidents; and then you must not touch it with your hand.

If there be no pain, Curatio.
begin your cure as speedily as may be. Let it be tied with a double thread,
which must be twiched so straight, until such time as it fall off, then let
the place be burnt with a cautery, put through a pipe, or with Aqua fortis, or
oil of vitrial; Aq. fortis. Oleum.
but have a great care you hurt not the sound parts: for if so be it be not
burnt, it usually returns. Epulis does oftentimes turn into a grisly and bony
substance (for want of a timely cure) as well as into a Cancer. If you would be
further satisfied concerning Epulis, read Felix Platerus. Platerus.

CHAP. XXV.
COLVMELLAE INFLAMMATIO, The inflammation of the Collumella, or uvula; which is
a little piece of flesh, spungy, and somewhat sharpened to the form of a pine
Apple, hanging in the upper, and inner part of the palate, so that if one gape
wide, and hold down his tongue, it may be seen: It serves to break the force of
the air drawn in: And to form and tune the voice: It is often vexed with
inflammation.

It is caused through blood, Causa.
and other humors descending from the head.

There chances difficulty in swallowing, Signa.
pain, swelling, redness of the Collumella, and a fever.

Their diet must be of a cooling quality, Curatio. Phlebotonaa.
cut the Cephalica vein in the arm, and afterward the vein under the tongue:
purge the belly with cooling clysters, Clyster.
and restrain the flux of humors, with such things as are of a restrictive
quality, as Balaustium, red roses, plantin, myrtyls, etc. of which may be made
collutions. As,. Gargarismus.

perceived by his color, and will not break with Mulsa, and Oximel scilliticum,
or such like; Then open it with some instrument; after the matter is burst out,
use cleansing, abstersive, and glutinative medicines: especially the juice of
Eupatory, etc.

CHAP. XXVI.
COLVMELLAE LAXATIO: oftentimes it chances that a loose Columella, or Uvula
does hang upon the roots of the tongue, and jaws.

It is caused for the most part through abundance of Rhume, also great labor,
Causa.
and great weakness or sickness, may be the cause.

You must use in the beginning such a kind of cure, as the inflammation thereof
requires; Curatio.
you must make gargarismes that restrain and dry, as. Nuc. cupressi m. j. ros.
rub. balaustior. Gallar. Gargarismus.

Take the ashes of centory, the powder of dogs dung, and honey, Mixtura.
mix them for the ulcers of the uvula, etc.

CHAP. XXVII.
BRONCHOCELE: (...).
The Latins call it, Gutturis Hernia; The rupture of the throat, is a great
round tumor in the throat: It setleth it self between the skin and the sharp
artery, in which sometimes gross phlegm is included; I mean flesh, as it were a
kind of humor like unto honey, fatness, or like unto cheese and eggs sodden
together.

It proceeds in women, Causa.
from the same cause as an Anurisma.

In some there is found a fleshy substance, Signa.
having some small pain, some are small, others great: some have a cist or bag,
others have no such thing; those that shall be curable, may be opened with an
incision-knife, Curatio.
and if possible, let out the matter: when the matter is evacuated, let the
ulcer be consolidated, and cicatrized: but before you attempt this kind of
cure, make Gargarismes, Cataplas. Marquardus.
and poultises, of figs, fenugreek, linseed, Althaea, etc. Lastly, if need be,
purge with Diacatholicon or Diaphaenicon in oximel; open a vein under the
tongue, and. Haustus.

CHAP. XXVIII.
TONSILLARVM INFLAMMATIO, inflammation of the tonsils, or almonds; whose places
be hot and moist; and therefore the more subject to inflammation. They are most
vexed with this evil that abound with blood. Nature has placed these two
Glandules opposite to one another, at the Jaws near the roots of the tongue,
in figure and magnitude like Almonds: their office is to receive the spittle
falling down from the brain, which serves to moysten the tongue; which
otherwise with continual speaking, would grow dry, and fail, which often
happens in fevers.

The inflammation of the almonds, Causa.
called Amigdalae, is caused sometimes by the drinking of strong wines; and
through greedy devouring of meat; sometimes there flows a great quantity of
crude, phlegmatic, and viscid humors, together with the blood, whence arises
a tumor. Signa.
Swallowing is painful to the patient, he has a fever: and many times the
muscles of the throttle and neck, is so swollen together with the glandules,
that the patient is strangled.

First administer a cooling clyster, Curatio. clyster. Venae-sectio
then open a vein under the tongue; if he abound with blood, first open the
Cephalica on the arm. To ease pain, apply a poultis, made of barley meal,
seeds of flax, fenugreek, althaea etc. or this cataplasm following.. Nidi
hyrund. iij. pull. nuc. cupress. j. ros. Cataplas.
.ss. excipiantur oxymel. fiat ad formam Cataplasmatis, applicetur in lateribus
colli. Then use astringent Gargarismes, Gargarismus.
if still the inflammation increases, and there be sharp gnawings in the
evening; then look for rotting of it; Decoctio.
for which purpose Aqua mulsa is good, and the decoction of figs, hyssop, seeds
of Althaea. etc. when it is perfectly rotten, break it with sharp collusions,
or cut it with some fine instrument; and after it is broken, let the patient
bow his head downward, that the matter may the better run out: and then let him
gargarise with Aqua mulsa, Aq mulsa.
until it be healed. Sometimes there are ulcerations of the Tonsils, which
happens unto those that do abound with vicious humors; I shall refer you
to the Chapter of Aphthae.

CHAP. XXIX.
RANVLA: (...).
is a tumor under the tongue, which takes away the liberty of pronunciation of
speech: wherefore the Greeks call it Batrachium; because such as have this
disease of the tongue, seem to express their minds by crooking, rather then by
speaking.

It is caused by the falling down of a cold, Causae.
moist, gross, tough, viscid, and phlegmatic matter from the brain, upon the
tongue; which matter in color and consistence, resembles the white of an egg:
yet sometimes it looks of a citrine or yellowish color.

You shall open the tumor with a cautery of hot iron; Curatio.
that so it may not return again: when it is opened, thrust out the matter
contained therein, Gargarismus.
and then wash the Patients mouth with some barley water, honey, and sugar of
roses: for so the ulcer will be safely and quickly healed. Or. Aquae

CHAP. XXX.
HYDROCEPHALVS: (...).
is as it were a dropsy of the head, by a waterish humor; and is a disease
almost peculiar to infants newly born.

The violent compression of the head by the hand of the midwife, or a fall,
Causa.
or contusion may be the cause; from hence comes a breaking of a vein, or
artery; and an effusion of blood under the skin; which by corruption becoming
wheyish, at last degenerateth into a certain waterish humor, or abundance of
serous and acrid blood, sweating through the pores of the vessels, as between
the musculous skin of the forehead; and the Pericranium, or between the skull
and the Duramater; or in the ventricles of the brain may be the cause.

It is a tumor without pain, soft, Signa.
and much yielding to the pressure of the finger.

1. If it be a tumor contained between the musculous skin and the
Pericranium.

2. When it remains between the Pericranium and the skull, the tumor is a
little harder, and there is a little sense of pain.

3. When it remains between the skull and the Duramater, or in the ventricles
of the brain, there is dullness of sight, and hearing: the tumor does not
yield so much to the touch, the pain is more vehement, the head more swollen,
the forehead stands further out, the eye is fixed and immovable, and also weeps
by reason of a serous humor sweating out of the brain. Vesalius.
Vesalius writes that he saw a girl of two years old, out of whose head rann
nine pound of water: Some their heads grow so big, that their necks cannot bear
them.

An external tumor is easily taken away; Curatio.
It must first be assailed with resolving medicines.. Lin mentu^.
Pulveris absynthii, cammomillae, meliloti an. ij. Butyri recentis, olei
cammomillae an..iv. cerae parum, fiat linimentum. Vel. Linimentu^.
Olei cammomillae, vel anethini. iv. sulphuris.j. fiat linimentum. If it be
complicated with the Lues venerea, mix with the liniment a little Vnguentum
enulatum. If it cannot be so overcome, you must make an incision, taking heed
of the temporal muscle, and then press out all the humor; then the wound must
be filled with dry lint, and covered with double bolsters, and then bound with
a fitting Ligature.

CHAP. XXXI.
PHLEGMONE; (...)
It is a general name for all impostumes, which the abundance of inflamed blood
produces; (...)
as a Phygethlum, which is a little swelling hard and red in the crown of the
head, and Phyma, (...).
or a little swelling like a boil; A fellon, Carbuncle, inflammation of the
eyes, squinsy, Bubo, etc. That is called a true phlegmon, which is made of
laudable blood, offending only in quantity. But a bastard phlegmon, or a
phlegmonous impostum has some other proper name, as a carbuncle, fellon,
gangreen, etc. If a small portion of phlegm be mixed with a greater quantity
of blood, then it is called an Oedematous phlegmon. But if the quantity of
phlegm be greater, then it is a Phlegmonus oedema. A phlegmon though most
commonly it be in the flesh, yet sometimes it happens in the bones, Hippocrat.
Galenus.
as Hippocrates (lib. de vuln. Galen lib. de tumor. praeter naturam) witness.

The causes of a phlegmon, are of three kinds, Causa.


1. First primitive, as falls, contusions, strains, immoderate labor,
frictions, application of acrid ointments, burnings, long staying, or laboring
in the Sun; and an inconsiderate diet which breeds much blood.

2. Secondly, Antecedent, as the great abundance of blood, too plentifully
flowing in the veins.

3. Thirdly, conjunct, as the collection or gathering together of blood impact
in any part.

The signs are swelling, tension, resistance, Signa.
feverish heat, pain, pulsation, (especially while it suppurates) and
redness; by which the abundance of blood is signified. The cause of pain and
pulsation, is heat, and abundance of blood, contained in the vessels and
arteries (which more frequently then they are wont incite the atteries to
motion, that is, to their Systole and Diastole) and the compression and
straitning of the said arteries, by reason of the repletion and distention of
the adjacent parts, by whose occasion the parts afflicted and beaten, by the
trembling and frequent pulsation of the arteries are in pain.

First, Curotio. Victus raratio.
his diet must be of a cooling quality, and he must shun all such things as
generate blood too plentifully, or that heat the blood; rest must be commanded.
Let him have his body soluble, if not by nature, then by art; as by the
frequent use of clysters. Clyster.
Let him avoid all vehement perturbations of mind, as Hate, Anger, etc. and let
him wholly abstain from venery. Venus.
If strength and the age of the Patient permit, give him a cooling purgation;
and open a vein. Venae-sectio
If much pain trouble the part, it must be mitigated with medicines, asswaging
pain.

1. In the beginning of a phlegmon, you must use repercussives, as. Cataplas.
Far. hordei. ij. succi semper vivi, plantag. an.. iij. pull. malicorii,
balaustiorum, and rosar. an.. ij. ol. myrtill. and rosar. an.. j. fiat
Cataplasma. Vel. Linimentu^.
Ol. nymph. and rosar. ana. iij. aq. ros. solani, and plantag. an.. ij. aceti.
iij. albumin. ovorum n. iij. fiat linimentum. Let linen clothes be dipped in
it, Aq s^e^m. ranatum.
and applied to the part. Also Aqua sperm. ranarum, is excellent for the same
purpose.

2. In the increase you must use this local medicine.. Farinae hord.. iij.
farinae sem. lini, Cataplas.
and faenugraeci ana. j. coquantur in aqua communi, addendo sub finem pull.
myrtillorum, rosarum, and chamaemeli an.. ss. axungiae, anseris, and olei
rosarum an.. j. misce. fiat Cataplasma.

3. In the state, Anodines ought to be mixed with repercussives and
discussives, as. Rad. altheae. iv. malvae, parietar. an. m. ij. Cataplas.
coquantur sub cineribus, addendo farin. fabarum, and lentium, ana. ij. pull.
chamaem. and meliloti, an.. ss. olei chamaem. and rosar. ana. j. axungiae gal..
ij. fiat Cataplasma. This cataplasme following is exceeding good to ease pain..
Mucagin. rad. altheae. Cataplas.
and foenugraeci ana. iij. ol. ros. and aneth. an.. j. farin. sem. lini quantum
satis, ut inde formetur cataplasma satis molle. Or you may use populeon with
Opium, Vnguentu^.
or narcotick medicines, if the pain shall still remain.

4. In the declination, that is, when the violence of pain, and other symptoms
are assuaged, you must use more powerful and strong discussives; as. Empl.
mucag. and oxycr. ana. i. ss. Diachyl. Emplastru^.
mag.. j. emplas. de melilot.. ss. olei liliorum, chamaemeli, and aneth.
quantum satis est: fiat emplastrum molle. But if the humor be so impact, that
it cannot be repressed; and so gross that it cannot be discussed, which may be
known by the greatness of the heat, and swelling, by the bitterness of the
pricking pain, the fever and pulsation, and by the heaviness: you must then
use suppuratives, as. Emplast. molle.
Emplast. diachyl. mag.. iij. ung. basilicon.. j. ol. liliorum. ss. misce. When
the heat, pain, fever, and other accidents shall remit; and when the tumor
has a sharp head; and when by the pressing of the finger, the humor flow to
and fro; then you may know that it is ripe. Then without any further delay, the
tumor must be opened, either with an incision-knife, or a potential cautery,
in which action consider,

1. First, that you put your knife to the softest part of that Abscess.

2. Secondly, to the lowest part.

3. Thirdly, you must make your incision according to the wrinkles of the skin,
and the right fibers of the muscles, lying next under the skin.

4. Fourthly, turn your knife from the large vessels and nerves.

5. Fifthly, the matter must not be evacuated too abundantly at once in great
Abscesses.

6. Sixthly, handle the affected part gently.

7. Seventhly and lastly, after the matter is evacuated, the Abscess must be
cleansed, filled with flesh, consolidated, and cicatrized.

The ulcer must be dressed 2 or 3 days with this medicine.. Medicamentum.
Vitellum unius ovi, terebinth. venetae, and ol. rosar. an.. ss. fiat
medicamentum. Then use this detersive medicine.. Mellis rosarum. j. syrupi
rosar. Medicamentum.
and terebinth. venetae an.. i. ss. farinae hordei. ij. fiat medicamentum ad
usum. But if you would cleanse it more powerfully, use Vnguentum Apostolorum,
Vnguentu^.
or Aureum and Aegyptiacum mixed, according to the scope you conceive in your
mind.

Amongst the symptoms which most usually accompany phlegmons, fevers are the
chief, as Ephemera, Synochus, etc. Their causes, signs and cures, you shall
find in the second book of this volume.

CHAP. XXXII.
ERYSIPELAS, or inflammation. (...). Herpes miliaris.
It is a general name for all impostumes brought forth by choler; as the
Herpes miliaris, The eating Herpes, Ring-worms, and Tetters, etc.

They are made by most thin and subtle blood, Causa.
(which upon any occasion of inflammation easily becomes chollerick) or by
blood and choler hotter then is requisite or by choler mixed with an acrid
serous humor, but oftentimes by sincere and pure choler, which by Galen is
called a true and perfect Erysipelas. Galenus.


1. If choler being predominant be mixed with blood, it is termed Erysipelas
phlegmonodes.

2. If with phlegm, Erysipelas oedematodes.

3. If with melancholy, Erysipelas scirrhodes. But if they concur in equal
quantity, there will be made Erysipelas phlegmone; Erysipelas oedema,
Erysipelas scirrhus.

There is great heat, Signa.
pulsation and pain (which is pricking and sharper then the pain in the
phlegmon) without heaviness, a yellowish red color. They quickly slide back
into the body, at the least compression of the skin. Erysipelas principally
assayles the face, by reason of the rarity of the skin of that place. Galenus.
Galen acknowledges two kinds of Erysipelas, one simple without an ulcer,
Prognostic.
the other ulcerated. If an Erysipelas possess the womb, it is deadly; And in
like manner, if it spread too far over the face, by reason of the sympathy of
the membranes, with the brain. So impostumes of a monstrous bigness are often
deadly, by reason of the great resolution of the spirits caused by their
opening. Hippocrat. Curatio. Venae sectio Victus ratio.
Hippo. Aphor. 8. Sect. 6.

The cure is performed by evacuation, and refrigeration. Open a vein if nothing
prohibit; the Cephalic vein, if it assayles the face. Let his diet be of a
cooling quality, then give a clyster of refrigerating and humecting things.
Galenus Avicenna.
Galen and Avicen commends this oxycrate following.. Oxycratum
Aqua font.. vj. aceti acer.. j. fiat oxycratum. In which you may wet linen
clothes, and apply them to the affected part, and renew them often. If it be
upon the face,. Linimentu^.
Vnguentum ros.. iv. succi plantagin. and semper vivi an.. j. trochis. de
camphora. ss. aceti parum, misce fiat linimentum. Also Aqua sperm. ranarum is
excellent; Aq. sperm. ranarum.
you may wet clothes in it, and apply them. If the pain be intolerable, this
narcotick is good.. Succi hyoscyami, solani, cicutae an.. j. Linimentu^.
album ovorum, n. ij. aceti. ss. opii and camphor. an. gr. iv. croci. ss.
mucaginis sem. psyll. and foenugr. extractae in aq. ros. and plantag. an.. j.
ol. de papav.. ij. fiat linimentum, addendo ung. refrigerantis Gal. camphor. q.
satis sit. But if the fiery color begin to wax livid and black, abstain from
narcotick medicines, and use resolving and strengthening things, as. Rad.
altheae. ij. fol. malvae, bismal. pariet. Fotus.
absynthii, salviae an. m. j. flor. chamaem. meliloti rosar. rub. an. m. ij.
coquantur in aequis partibus vini and aquae, and fiat fotus cum spongia. After
the fomentation, Emplastru^.
apply a plaster of Diapalma dissolved in oil of cammomile and melilote.
Erysipelous tumors do bring with them (oftentimes) Tertian fevers, as
Exquisita Tertiana, Tertiana notha and Semitertiana febris.

CHAP. XXXIII.
HERPES, (...). Causa.
is a tumor caused by pure choler, separated from the rest of the humors, and
carried to the scarf skin; and is diffused over the surface thereof. If choler
be compounded with some small mixture of phlegm, it will raise little blisters
over the skin like to the seeds of millet; Herpes miliaris. Herpes exedens.
This tumor of the ancients is called Herpes miliaris. And if it have any
admixture of melancholy, it will be an Herpes exedens.

Let his diet be of a cooling quality; Curatio.
Clysters often times suffices for the purging of the peccant humor. The
surgeon shall have regard to the resolving of the tumor, and the drying of
the ulcer; for which purpose. Vnguentu^.
Cerusae, and tuthiae praep an.. j. ol. ros. and adipis capon. an.. ij.
corticis pini usti. ss. cerae, quantum satis, fiat unguentum. For an Herpes
miliaris,. Vnguentu^.
Pulv. gallarum, malicurii, balaust. boli armeni an.. j. aqua ros.. iij. aceti
acerrimi. j. axungiae an. ser. and olei myrtill. an.. i. ss. terebinth.. j.
fiat unguentum ad usum. Vnguentum enulatum is of great force in the removing
this tumor, Vng, enul.
for it kills the pustules, and wastes the humor. Also fretting ulcers, which
seem uncurable, may be healed, by touching the edges with Aq. fortis, or oil
of vitriole.

CHAP. XXXIV.
OEDEMA, (...)
is a soft, laxe, and painlesse tumor; caused by collection of a phlegmatic
humor. And may be said to be a general name, for all tumors, which phlegm
produces; Antheromata. Steatomata Melicerides
as the Atheromata, Steatomata, and Melicerides; The matter of every one of
these tumors, is shut up in its bladder or bag, as it were in a peculiar cell.
The matter of the first is like childrens pap. Of the second like tallow. And
the third contains matter like honey, in color and consistence. Also the
Testudo or Talpa, is a tumor soft diffused, vaulted, Testudo seu Talpa.
or arched like a Tortois, sometimes arising in the head, in the form of a
mole. Nata.
And the Nata is a great fleshly tumor growing for the most part on the
buttocks, not much unlike a melon. Glandula.
The Glandula is a tumor which commonly breeds in the glandules, or
Emnunctories of man's body. The Nodus or knot, Nodus.
is a round tumor hard and immovable, which usually arises on the bones of
such as have Lues venerea. Also Ganglion, strumae, Wens, waterie ruptures, the
Ascites, and Leucophlegmatia, may be reduced to an Oedema, and all flatulent
tumors which the abundance of corrupt phlegm produces. But phlegm is sometimes
natural, and offends only in quantity, whence the true Oedema proceeds.

The causes of all Oedema's are the defluxion of a phlegmatic or flatulent
humor into any part. Causa.


There is a whitish color like unto the skin, Signa.
a soft tumor rare and laxe, and without pain: when you press it with your
finger, the Print thereof remains. Oedema's breed rather in winter then in
summer, and chiefly possess the bloodless parts, and is terminated sometimes by
resolution, as in dropsies, etc. but oftener by concretion, as in kernels, etc.
and seldom by suppuration. A symptomatical Oedema, as that which follows upon a
dropsy, or consumption, admits no cure, unless the disease be first taken
away. Curatio. Aer. Cibus. Potus. Motus. Quies.


First prescribe moderation in the use of the six things not natural; as
namely, the air, meat and drink, sleep, and watchfulness, exercise and rest,
Somnus. Repletio. Inanitio. Animi pathemata. Venus. Hippocrat. Cataplas.
emptiness and repletion, and the affects of the mind. If his belly be not
naturally loose, let it be made so by art. The moderate use of venery is good,
if he be a strong body; for according to Hippocrates, it is a cure for
phlegmatic diseases. You may use this following cataplasme.. Farinae hordei.
iv. coquantur in lixivio communi, addendo pulveris nucis cupressi, corticum
granatorum, balaust. ana. j. myrrhae, aloes alum. an.. ss. olei myrtill.. ij.
fiat cataplasma. After this, Fomentatio
let frictions be used, and a fomentation made with white wind, in which, sage,
rosemary, time, lavender, cammomile, ^^^d melilote flowers, red roses, Orris
roots, stechas, and such like, have been boiled with a little vinegar added
thereunto. As for the cure of flatulent and waterish tumors, I refer you to
the Chapters of the dropsies, especially Tympanites. And also in the Chapter of
the chollick, you may find plenty of remedies.

Oedemateous Tumors do bring oftentimes with them intermitting Quotidian
fevers.

Oedema, Oedematis tempora.
ut ceteri tumores, quatuor habet tempora, nempe principium: augmentum: statum:
and declinationem. Oedematis terminatio
Hoc genus tumoris ut plurimum terminatur per resolutionem, seu exhalationem.

CHAP. XXXV.
GANGLIVM, A wen or ganglion, (...).
is a tumor sometimes hard, sometimes soft, yet always round, and uses to
breed in dry, hard, and nervous parts; having commonly their bladder wherein to
contain them. Wens or Ganglions are called of some Lupiae.

For the most part they happen through dull blows, falls from high places,
strains, Causa.
and other such like occasions.

From small beginnings they grow by little and little to a great bigness,
Signa.
in the space of six or seven years. Some of them yield much to the touch; and
almost all of them are without pain.

At the beginning, Curatio. Argentum vivum.
strong and frequent frictions must be used. A plate of lead rubbed with
Quicksilver, and strongly bound to the affected part, has a wonderful force
to resolve and waste the subject humor. But if the Wen be on the face, chest,
belly, or throat, so that you can make no strong impression, then. Gummi ammon.
bdelii, galban. an.. iij. Emplastru^.
liquefiant in aceto, and traj ciantur per setaceum, addendo olei liliorum, and
lauri an.. j. aq. vitae pulveris ireos, salis ammon. sulphur. vivi, vitrioli
romani, an.. ss. fiat emplastrum. If the tumor cannot be thus resolved, it must
be opened with a knife or cautery, and after the eschar is removed, and the bag
wasted by Egyptiacum, Egyptiacum.
or Mercury, The ulcer must be cleansed, replenished with flesh, and
cicatrized. But sometimes Wens grow to so great a mass, that they cannot be
taken away, but by the chyrurgions hand and instrument, this may be done if the
wen be not too nigh the greater veins and arteries, or seated in the neck near
unto the jugular veins, or under the arm-holes, or in the groine, or under the
ham; It will be better in such a cause to let them alone, least deadly
symptoms arise. Yet if they have a slender root and broad top, they must be
straightly tied, and so cut off. There are also certain small tumors of the
kind of Lupiae, which grow chiefly on the wrists of the hands, and Ankles of
the feet, caused by the imbecility of a Nerve or Tendon; got by wresting,
extension, a blow, or labor; which causes the Alimentary juice (that flows
to those parts) to be converted into a cold and gross humor, which in time
concretes into a tumor. It is not fit to use any iron instrument to these
Ganglia, which possess the tendons and joints; Galbanum Ammoniac.
but only apply Galbanum, and Ammoniacum, dissolved in vinegar, and Aq. vitae,
or Vigo's plaster with double mercury: also a plate of lead rubbed with
quicksilver, and applied, is excellent: If you want more, look into the
following Chapter, and there you may find plenty of remedies.

CHAP. XXXVI.
STRVMAE, or Scrophulae, That is, (...).
the Kings evil. They arise in the glandulous parts: as the breasts, arm-holes,
groines, but chiefly in the glandules of the neck, commonly contained in their
proper cist or bag.

They are made of gross, cold, viscid, Causa.
and phlegmatic matter, with some admixture of Melancholy.

Some of them are moveable, Signa.
other-somme woven with the neighboring nerves, remaining unremoveable. They
are oftentimes painful, especially when they wax hot by putrefaction: sometimes
they degenerate into cancerous ulcers.

A slender diet helps much to waste these tumors. Curatio. Victus ratio.
Let the superfluous humors be purged. Then take this emollient and resolving
medicine.. Mucaginis alth. foeenugr. and ficuum ping. an. Cerolum.
. ij. olei liliorum, and chamaem. an.. j. pinguedinis anseris, and axungiae
porci, an.. ss. terebinth. ven.. i. ss. ammoniaci, and galbani, in aceto
dissolutorum ana. j. cerae novae quantum satis, fiat cerotum secundum artem ad
modum diachyli magni. With some of this Cerote, may be mixed the powder of
Quicksilver; and applied: for many have been helped therewith; they must be
dressed every second or third day. The unguent for the French disease, and
Vigo's plaster, are excellent for this purpose, especially if they be continued
so long, until the Patient come to salivation. The best way if possible, is to
bring it to suppuration, and then let the expert Surgeon open the tumor, or
tumors; but not before all the contained humors that appear, be converted into
pus or matter: for we must not as soon as any portion of the humor, be turned
into pus, hasten the apertion; because one portion of the suppurated humor,
causes the rest to suppurate. As fruits which begin to rot. If the putrefying
part be not cut away, the residue quickly becomes rotten. Also natural heat is
the efficient cause of suppuration. Such as are in the neck, and have no deep
roots, may be cut away; but special care must be taken, that the jugular
veins, the sleepie arteries, and the recurrent nerves, be not violated or
hurt. Lastly, some commend this emplaster following.. Emplastru^. Manardus.
Rhabarbari electi,. ss. Aloes hepaticae. j. Lixivti fortis lib. j. Saponis
veneti lib. ss. cerae. ij. Decoquantur ad duritiem justam.

CHAP. XXXVII.
SCIRRHVS, (...).
is an hard tumor proceeding of melancholy. A cancer, leprosy, corus, a
Thymus, Gemursae. (...).
which is a kernel under the canell bone; The Dracunculus, which is a
generation of hairs like worms, and are bred in the musculous part of man's
body; whose cure according to Gorraeus, Gorraeus.
is performed after the same manner, and by the same method of section, and
incision, as the varices are; Varices.
A varix is a crooked swelling vein, or if you will, it is the dilatation of a
vein; Morpheae.
Also the morphew black and white, and all other impostumes arising from a
melancholy humor, Scirrhus legitimus.
may be reduced to a Scirrhus, a true and legitimate Scirrhus is generated, of
a natural melancholy humor, being endued with a little sense, hard and without
pain.

The illegitimate Scirrhus is generated of a melancholic humor, Scirrhus
illegitimus.
concrete by too much refrigerating, it is insensible, and without pain. There
is also a Cancerons Scirrhus, bred by the corruption and adustion of a
melancholy humor; And lastly, an Oedematous Scirrhus. Causa.


The cause is a gross, tough, and tenacious humor, concrete in any part; which
happens by an ill and irregular diet, or the unnatural affects of the liver,
or spleen, as obstruction, or by suppression of the Haemmorrhoids, Signa.
or courses. The signs are hardness, renitency, a blackish color, and a
dilation of the veins of the affected part, with blackishnesse. The
illegitimate or bastard Scirrhus, and also the cancerous, admit no cure; and
the true legitimate scarce yield to any.

First prescribe a convenient diet, Curatio. Victus ratio.
and let the Patient be free from all perturbation of anger, grief, and
sadness; and let him fly from venerie, as from an enemy. Secondly, Venus.
procure the Haemorrhoids in men, and the courses in women, and purge with this
potion following. Potio purgans.
. Diacatholiconis, tripherae persicae, an.. iij. diasennae solut.. ij.
rhabarbari in aqua endiv. infusi and expressi. j. cinnamomi gr. iv. aquarum
lupuli, and end^viae an.. ij. misce, and fiat potio. At the beginning
emollients must be used; and then presently resolving, or such as are mixed
both of resolving, Emplastru^.
and emollient faculties; for which purpose the emplaster of vigo with a double
quantity of Mercury is effectual; for that mollifies, resolves, and wastes all
tumors of this kind. Lastly Goats dung is very good to discuss Scirrhus
tumors. If you want more, look into the Chapters of the diseases of the
spleen. Quartan fevers happens often upon Scirrhus tumors.

CHAP. XXXVIII.
CANCER, It is a hard tumor, rough, and unequal; (...).
round and immovable; of an ash or livid color, horrin by reason of the
veins on every side, swollen with black blood, and spread abroad to the
similitude of the stretched out legs, and claws of a crab.

The suppression of accustomed evacuations, Causa.
an irregular diet, and obstruction of the spleen, may be the cause.

It torments the Patient with pricking pain, Signa.
like the pricking of needles with acrid heat, being of a livid and ash color,
and representing the toothed claws of a crab. There is an ulcerated or
manifest Cancer, and the not ulcerated or occult, some are inveterate; one
small, another great, one raging and malign, another more mild. Every Cancer is
held uncurable, or very difficult; for it is a particular leprosy. Some
possess the internal parts, as the womb, guts, and fundament. Others the
external, as the breasts. The tumor seems soft to the eye, but hard to the
touch. The ulcer is filthy, with lips, thick, swollen, hard, knottie, turned
out, and standing up, casting forth fllthie and carrion like filth, having a
horrid aspect; The pain, fever, and all the symptoms are increased by acrid
medicines.

In weak bodies we must not attempt the cure; Curatio.
but only keep them from growing more violent, and from spreading further.
Hippocrat.
Hippocrates says, that such as are cured of an occult cancer do quickly die,
but such as are not cured, live longer. Galenus.
Galen affirms he cured a cancer not ulcerated. The cure is performed by
medicines purging melancholy, by phlebotomie, and shunning all things that may
breed ill and feculent blood. A cooling and humecting diet must be prescribed,
Victus.
and the part affected with the cancer must be gently handled. Asses milk is
exceeding fit to assuage the acrimonie of the cancerous humor; taken
inwardly, and applied outwardly to the cancerous ulcer. If the cancer be
small, and in a part which may suffer amputation; cut a way (according to art)
whatsoever is corrupt even to the quick; Historia.
A near kinsman of mine was (eight years agone) troubled with a cancerous tumor
in his breast; for a certain time I bathed the part affected with Oleum rosarum
omphacinum, Ol. ros. omp.
and applied many plasters of Diacalcitheos, Diacalcith.
and it pleased the Lord to cure him. Yea (and contrary to the Aphorism of
Hippocrates) he lived many years after. Hippocrat.
This following medicine is very commendable.. Plumbiusti loti, pomph. thuris

Some apply leeches, Sanguisugae.
others whelps, and chickins, cut long ways, and applied warm.

If the cancer affect the womb, the Patient feels pricking pain in the groines,
and kidneys, and is often troubled with difficulty of making water, and when it
is ulcerated, it powers forth filth, or matter exceeding stinking, and carrion
like, and that in great plenty; The filthy vapor of which is carried up to the
heart and brain, and causes often swounding. In this cause fomentations must be
used to ease pain, and cordial Epithemes must be applied to the heart, Epithema.
and let the Patient drink Aq. Aqua opt.
sperm. ranarum often, five or six spoonfuls at a time; also let it be injected
with a syring.

A plate of lead besmeared with quicksilver, Argentum vivum.
and applied to a not ulcerated cancer is much commended by diverse; yea it is a
good medicine for malign and inveterate ulcers, which contemn the force of
other medicines, and is as it were an antidote to waste and overcome their
malignity and evil nature.

CHAP. XXXIX.
ANEVRISMA, is a soft tumor yielding to the touch: made by the blood and
spirit, poured forth under the flesh and muscles, by the dilatation or
relaxation of an artery.

They are made by the Anastomasis, Causa.
springing, breaking, erosion, and wounding of the arteries. They happen
frequently in the throat, especially in women after a painful travel, by
holding their breath too strongly for the expulsion of the birth, the artery is
dilated and broken; whence follows an effusion of blood and spirit under the
skin. Also an artery wounded, and closing too slowly may be the cause.

Aneurisma, is a swelling, one while great, Signa.
another small; soft, with a pulsation, and a color not varying from the other
fleshy parts: If you press it with your finger, the arterious blood and
spirits flies back into the body of the artery, so that the tumor seems
vanished; but the fingers being taken away, they return again with like
celerity, making a noise like hissing.

Aneurismaes under the armpits, Curatio.
in the groines, or any other part where there are large vessels, admit no
cure. They ought not to be opened, unless they be small in an ignoble part.
But the manner of cure shall be this, cut the skin which lies over it, until
the artery appear; then thrust a blunt and crooked needle with a thread in it,
under it, and bind it; then cut it off, and so expect the falling off of the
thread of it self, whilst nature covers the orifices of the cut artery with new
flesh. The Aneurismaes which happen in the internal parts are incurable. This
matter many times by little and little, is so dried and hardened, that it
degenerates into a grisly, or else a bony substance. Victus.

no pulsation, neither can you press the blood into the artery, because many

PROCIDENTIA ANY, the falling down of the fundament, is very frequent to
children.

It is caused through the relaxation of the muscle Sphincter, which ingirts the
fundament; Causa.
which happens by reason of the too much humiditie of the belly. A bloody
flux, or a strong endeavor to expel the excrements, or sitting upon a cold
stone, a stroke or fall upon the holy bone, or a palsy of the nerves, etc. may
be the cause.

so great a contraction, and oftentimes narrowness in the fundament, and the
neck of the womb, that scarcely the top of ones finger may be put into the
orifice thereof; like unto pieces of leather or parchment, which are wrinkled
and parched by holding of them to the fire. They arise sometimes in the mouth,
that the Patient can neither eat, speak, nor open his mouth; so that the
chyrurgion is constrained to cut it. In the cure thereof, all sharp things are
to be avoided, and those which mollify, are to be used; look Vteri Phymosis.

is a tumor in the ends of the fingers, under the nails, with great

It is caused through a malign, Causa,
and venomous humor; which from the bones by the Periosteum, is communicated
to the tendons and nerves, of that part which it affects.

There follow pulsifique pain, Signa.

You must begin with purging, Curatio. Venae-sectio
and blood-letting. Then make incision in the inner part of the finger even to
the bone, along the first joint thereof; This must be done before it come to
maturation, suffer it to bleed well; then let him dip his finger in strong and
warm vinegar, in which some treakle has been dissolved; and then appease the
pain with Vnguentum populneum, or the like. And take this ointment following..

EXOMPHALVS, or swelling of the navel. (...).
It is caused by the Peritonaeum, either relaxed or broken; by which occasion
oft-times the Guts or Kall fall into the seat of the navel, and sometimes
superfluous flesh is there generated; sometimes this tumor is an Aneurisma.
Sometimes it is caused by a flatulent, and sometimes by a waterish humor.

If the fall be the cause, Signa.
the color is like the skin; soft, and almost without pain. But if the tumor
proceed from superfluous flesh, it is hard and immovable. If from wind, it
sounds when you press it. If by a waterish humor, it is easily known. If from
the effusion of blood, it is of a livid color; but if the effused blood be
arterial, then there are signs of a Aneurisma. If it be caused by the falling
down of the guts, there is heard a noise when you press it.

If the tumor ptoceed from the Kall and Guts, you must force them into their
due place. Curatio.
Then may the skin be taken up, and thrust through with a needle, and double
twined strong thread; next let the sides be scarified, then thrust it through
with a needle three or four times, and twich it strongly with a thread, that the
skin with the ligature may fall off. But you may cut off the skin so distended
even to the ligatures, and then cicatrize it. In a watery tumor, a small
incision must be made, and the wound kept open until the water be emptied.

CHAP. XLV.
GANGRAENA: (...).
a Gangrene is a certain disposition and way to the mortification of the part
which it seizes upon, dying by little and little. When there is a perfect
mortification, (...).
it is called by the Greeks Sphacelos, and by the Latins Syderatio, which
according to Fallopius, Fallopius. Fabricius.
and Fabricius, is an affect of a part already utterly mortified, and therefore
not to be cured, but by amputation; that the whole body come not to corruption
thereby. Or it is a perfect and total privation of sense, being a mortification
not only of the fleshy parts, but also of the nervous parts, even unto the
bone, and sometimes of the bone it self.

The cause of a Gangrene may be an exceeding effusion of blood and spirits,
Causa.
or a distemper of the four humors. Also extreme erosion, or corrosion of
caustic medicines, or corrosive humors. A venomous and poisoned blood, great
burnings and scaldings; or overmuch hunger and thirst, may be the cause. Also a
Gangrene may happen by the pricking of a nerve, by a fever, precedent; by a
frost, and also by extreme cold, by the biting of venomous beasts, or mad dogs,
or through great incised wounds, but especially confuted wounds, and by
unreasonable stripes. Finally, from all intercepons, intersections, or
interruptions of spirits, what, or wheresoever mayproduce a Gangrene.

The signs of a Gangrene are these, Signa.
an extinction of the lively color, which was in the precedent phlegmon.
Grievous pain, and continual pulsation in the diseased part; apparent by the
arteries, being at first very sensible, but afterward declining their due
force: The part agrieved seeming for the most part in color to be blackish,
bluish, or of a duskie, or livid color; yea sometimes putrid, and being
opened, a filthy Ichor of an unsavory smell proceeds from it.

If there be sense, there is life, and hope. Curatio.


1. First, empty out abundantly the corrupt blood, which is stuffed in the
affected member; Venae-sectio
For this purpose some apply horse-leeches, others cut the fullest vein about
the affected member, also deep scarifications are good.

2. When you have drawn out blood abundantly, by deep slashes or cuts; the
place must be splashed with salt water; then lay on a medicine appointed for
corrupted sores, or wash it with hot vinegar, or Mulsum, twice a day.

3. Unguent. Aegyptiacum.
When the fury of the evil is somewhat slaked, minister Vnguentum Aegyptiacum;
whose wonderful affects have been often tried: It is made after this manner..

may serve. This Lotion is good to wash the affected part, before the Egyptiacum
be laid on;. Lotio.
Aceti optimi lb.j. mel. ros..iv. sir. acet..iij. salis com..v. bull. simull,

4. If the evil will not yield to these remedies, stronger must be used, to
wit cauteries; after whose application, Galenus.
Galen bids to put upon it the juice of a Leek with beaten salt, to hinder
putrefaction.

5. But if all these things shall nothing help, and now Gangraena is turned
into a sphacell, or mortification, and that the part is thoroughly dead, which
you may know by the color, for it is black, and colder then a stone to your
touch; It rises not again after the pressure of the finger, and the skin comes
from the flesh lying under it. The smell is so strong (especially in an
ulcerated sphacel) that the standers by cannot endure it. There is also a
sanious moisture, viscid, green, or blackish flowing from thence, and the part
is quite destitute of sense and motion; though you pull it, beat it, crush it,
prick it, burn it, or cut it off. I read of one, Historia.
who many months after the cutting away of his leg, grievously complained that
he felt exceeding grear pain of that leg so cut off. A thing wondrous strange,
and prodigeous. Now if Gangraena be turned into Sphacelus, cut of that member
very speedily, even to the whole; so that no filthiness remain behind, for
(...); the infected parts of the body, Hip. lib. 2. Aphor. 9.
the more they are cherished, the more they are indammaged; and therefore the
amputation not to be deferred.

6. Then let the veins and arteries be bound up, as speedily and as straightly
as you can. But the ends of the vessels lying hid in the flesh, must first be
taken hold of with a Crows beak, and drawn forth of the muscles; whereinto they
presently after the amputation, withdrew themselves; when you have so drawn
them forth, bind them with a strong double thread; and strew upon the wound an
emplastick powder, made with bolearmenick, etc. Pulvis emplast.
laying thereupon dry lint, (also the juice of leeks is good) and apply a
defensitive. The member being placed upon a plillow stuffed with wheat bran, it
must not be stirred for four days, unless great necessity urge. Then to
agglutinate. Boli arm. farin. hord. picis resinae, gypsi, an. Pulvis,
.iv. aloes, nucum cup. cort. granat. an..j. incorporentur omnia simul, fiat
pulvis subtilis. Herewith let the whole ulcer be strewed over, for 3 or 4
days; which being ended, let only the seats of the vessels be powdered
therewith, for eight or ten days; the rest of the cure is easily performed.
But great diligence must be used to procure the falling away of the ends, or
scales of the bones, which may be done by applying to their ends actual
cauteries, but take heed you touch not the sensible parts with fire. Some
presently after amputation, make use of actual cauteries, but that brings great
horror to the Patient.

1. Victus ratio.
Remember that those which are troubled with Gangraena and Sphacelus, their
diet must be of a cooling quality.

2. If nothing do let, turn away the flux by letting blood.

3. Purify the blood with Catholicon, cassia, the decoction of Tamarinds, or
fumitory.

4. Let the sick take Theriaca, which is able to defend the heart, from those
corrupted and filthy smelling fluxes, which are mounted upwards.

CHAP. XLVI.
EXANTHEMATA, (...).
the small pox are pustules, and the measles, spots, which arise in the top of
the skin, by reason of the impurity of the corrupt blood sent thither by force
of nature.

Most of the Ancients have delivered that this impurity is the relics of the
menstruous blood, remaining in the body of the infant; Causa.
being of that matter from whence it drew nourishment in the womb, which lying
still for some space of time, but stirred up at the first opportunity of a
hotter summer, or a hidden malignity in the air, and boiling up or working with
the whole mass of blood, spread or show themselves upon the whole surface of
the body. The small pox are caused of a more gross and viscous matter, to wit,
of a phlegmatic humor. But the meazles of a more subtle and hot, that is, a
choleric matter.

At first, Signa.
when the matter of the pox seek passage out, the Patients often sneeze, and
are held with a continual fever, with pain in their backs, itching of their
nose, headache, and a vertiginous heaviness, and with a kind of swounding or
fainting, a nauseous disposition, and vomiting, a horsenesse, difficult and
frequent breathing, and inclination to sleep, a heavines of all the members,
their eyes are fiery, and swollen, their urin red and troubled. The small pox
are extuberating pustules, white in the midst, but red in the circumference. On
the third or fourth day they bunch out, and rise up into a tumor; becoming
white, before they turn into a scab. They prick like needles, (by reason of a
certain acrimonie) and cause an itching. The meazles yield no marks, but
certain small spots without any tumor; and they be either red, purple, or
black, without pricking or itching. The pox does not only mangle and spoil the
fleshy parts, but oftentimes eat, and corrupt the bones, like the Lues venerea;
and brings the dropsy, ptisick, hoarsnesse, Asthma, bloody flux, ulcerating
the guts; and at length death. Some have lost their sight, others their
hearing, and other-some their smelling. Some that have died of this disease,
and their bodies being dissected; Their entrails have been found to be covered
with scabby or crusted pustules, like those that break forth upon the skin.

If a sucking child be assailed with the pox, Curatio.
it must be kept warm, and there must be provided for the nurse medicated
brothes, with purslain, Victus ratio.
lettice, sorrel, succory, Burrage, and French barley, bound up in a cloth: she
must shun all salt, and baked, or spiced meats; and in stead of wine, Decoctio.
let her drink a decoction of liquorice, raisins, and sorrel roots: also she
must take purging medicines, and keep the child from pap.

If the child be weaned, let him abstaim from flesh, until the fever have
left him, and the pox be come forth. Victus.
Let him feed on barley and Almond creames, chickin broths (wherein have been
boiled the forementioned herbs, and the shavings of Ivory and hartshorn)
Panadoes, gellies, cullases, and raisins. Let his sleep be moderate, for too
sound sleep draws back the matter to the center, and increases the fever.
You must neither purge, nor draw blood, the disease increasing; or being at the
height; unless there be a plurisie, squinancie, etc. A gentle clyster is good
in the state, and increase of the disease; Decoctio.
you must make a sudorifick decoction of figs, liquorice, husked lentils,
citron seeds, the seeds of fenell, and smalledge; the roots of grass, raisins,
dates, gold, millet, marygold flowers, and harts-horne, at the latter end of
the boiling, put in some saffron, or. Radic. gram. aspar. foenic. an..iv.

1. You must defend the eyes, Medicamentum.
when you first begin to suspect the disease, with rosewater, or vinegar, and a
little camphire. If the pain and inflammation be great, then use Aloes, Aliud.
and Tuttie, washed in the water of fennel, eyebright, and roses.

2. You must defend the nose with a Nodulus; Nodulus.
made with a little vinegar, water of roses, the powder of sanders, and
camphire.

3. You must defend the jaws, throat, and throttle, and preserve the integrity
of the voice, Oxycratum
by a Gargle of oxycrate.

4. The Lungs, and respiration must be provided for, by syrups of jujubes,
violets, Syrupi.
white poppies, and water-lilies.

5. To prevent Pockarrs, after they are ripe, open them with a golden or silver
needle; lest the matter contained in them, should corrode the flesh that lies
under and after the cure, leave pock-holes behind it.

6. The pus or matter being evacuated, Lini^
they shall be dried up with ung. rosat. adding thereto ceruse, Aloes, and a
little saffron in powder.

7. Olcum.
Being dried up like a scurf or scab, anoint them with oil of Almonds, or
Roses, or with some cream, that they may the sooner fall away.

8. Vnguentu^.
If there be any excoriation through scratching, then shall you heal it with
Vnguentum album camphor. adding thereto a little powder of Aloes or Desicativum
rubrum.

9. To help the unsightly scars of the face, Lac virginale, Ol. lil.
Goose, Ducks, and Capons grease are good; and also oil of lillies, and Hares
blood newly killed and hot. Many cry out against bleeding, though it be done a
little before the pox come out; Phlebotomia.
for my part, I have opened a vein (ofttentimes) with good success on strong
bodies, so that the pox have come forth within 24 hours after bleeding,
without any danger. Also Bezoar is excellent to send forth the pox. Byzabar.
But the most familiar thing for children, Diascordium.
is Diascordium.

Lastly, the meazles are cured by resolution only, Cons. samb.
and not by suppuration. For which purpose conserve of Eldern flowers is
especially commended; not only to be eaten, but also to be rubbed upon the
heated parts. If there be great faintness, Cordial.
take Aqua Mariae, sir. lujulae, of either one ounce, give him a little often.

CHAP. XLVII.
ELEPHANTIASIS, (...). Paulus. Avicennas Galenus.
or leprosy (according to Paulus) is a cancer of the whole body, The which, as
Avicen adds) corrupts the complexion, form, and figure of the members, or
according to Galen. This disease is an effusion of troubled or gross blood
into the veins, and habit of the whole body.

1. The primitive cause is, Causa.
either from the first conformation, or comes to them after they are born, by
the too frequent use of salt, spiced, acrid, and gross meats. Also
familiarity, copulation, and cohabitation with leprous persons. Sweat and
spittle left on the edges of the pots or cups (for there is a certain hidden
virulencie in the leprosy) strong wines, drunkenness, gluttony, and a
laborious life, full of sorrows and cares. The suppression of the Hemorrhoids,
and courses. The small pox, and meazles. Also a Quartan fever, the drying up
of old ulcers; for that they defile the mass of blood; and thus in conclusion,
the leprosy is caused.

2. The antecedent causes are, the humors disposed to adustion, and
corruption, into melancholy by the torrid heat.

3. The conjunct causes are, the melancholy humors, which are now pertakers of
a venenate and malign quality, and spread over the whole habit of the body;
corrupting and destroying it, first by a hot and dry distemper, and then by a
cold and dry, contrary to the beginnings of life, which consists in the
moderation of heat and moisture.

1. The first sign is, a falling away of the hairs, and you may perceive
scauls in the head.

2. The second is a numerous and manifest circumseription, of round and hard
pushes or pustules under the eyebrows, behind the ears, and in several
places of the face, like hard kernels.

3. The third is, the more contract, and exact roundnesse of the ears.

4. The fourth is, A Lyon-like wrinkling of the forehead, which is the reason
that some term this disease Morbus Leoninus.

5. The fifth is, the exact roundnesse of the eyes, and their fixed and
immovable steadiness.

6. The sixth is, the nostrils are flat outwardly, but inwardly strait and
contracted.

7. The seventh is the lifting up, thickness and swelling of the lips; Also
the stinch, filthiness, and corrosion of the gummes; by acrid vapors rising
to the mouth.

8. The eighth is, the swelling and blackness of the tongue, and as it were
varicous veins lying under it. Their face rises in red bunches, or pushes, and
is overspread with a duskie and obscure redness. Their eyes are fiery, fierce,
and fixed. Some leprous persons have their faces tinctured with a yellowish,
others with a whitish color, according to the condition of the humor; for
Physicians affirm, that there are three sorts of Leprosies, one of a reddish
black color, consisting in a melancholy humor: another of a yellowish green,
in a choleric humor: another of a whitish yellow, grounded upon adust phlegm.

9. The ninth sign is, a stinking of the breath; and also of all the excrements
proceeding from leprous bodies.

10. The tenth is a hoarsness, a shaking, harsh, and obscure voice, coming as
it were out of the nose.

11. The eleventh is, a morphew, or defedation of all the skin, with a dry
roughness, and grainie inequality; such as appears in the skins of plucked
Geese, with many tetters on every side, a filthy scab, and ulcers, not casting
off only a branlike scurf, but also scales and crusts.

12. The twelfth is, the sense of a certain pricking, as it were of needles
over all the skin.

13. The thirteenth is, a cunsumption and emacination of the muscles, which are
between the thumb and forefinger. Also their shoulders stand out like wings

14. The fourteenth is, the diminution of sense, or a numbnesse over all the
body; by reason that the nerves are obstructed, and so the free passage of the
animal spirit is hindered.

15. The fifteenth is, the corruption of the extreme parts, possessed by
putrefaction and a Gangrene.

16. The sixteenth is, they are troubled with terrible dreams, for they seem in
their sleep to see Devils, Serpents, Dungeons, Graves, Dead bodies, and the
like.

17. The seventeenth is, they are subtle, crafty, and furious; and suspicious
in all their dealings.

18. The eighteenth is, they desire venery above their nature.

19. The nineteenth is, if you wash their thick, gross, and livid blood; you
find a sandy matter therein.

20. The twentienth is, the Languidnesse and weakness of the pulse; Also the
urine is sometimes thick and troubled, and oftentimes of a pale and ash color.
Lastly, the face and all the skin is unctuous or greasy.

Cure cannot be promised to such as have a confirmed leprosy; Curatio.
for it is scarce curable at the beginning. Therefore care must be taken to
free such as are ready to fall into so fearful a disease. Such therefore must
shun all things in diet and course of life, whereby the blood and humors may
be too vehemently heated.

Let them make choice of meats of good juice. Victus ratio.
Purging, bleeding, and bathing shall be prescribed, by some learned Physician.

Gelding is much commended in this cause, because it deprives them of the
faculty of generation; and makes them become cold and moist, which temper is
directly contrary to the hot and dry distemper of leperous persons. I have
oftentimes (after purging and bleeding) used Vnguentum enulatum with good
success in the beginning of the leprosy, ^nguentu^.
whilst the body was covered only with a scurf. Let them drink the water and

I am persuaded it is an excellent water to kill the virulencie of this disease,

ulcerated cancer, it must needs be effectual in the leprosy. Gesner says,
that the dung of a Fox pounded with vinegar by anoyntment, cures the leprosy
speedily. Remember to keep accustomed evacuations, which you may with this

The cause is twofold, Causa.
external, as a fall, bruise, or by going too narrow gi^t, etc. Internal, as
gluttony, indigestion of the stomach, weakness of the virtue digestive of the
liver: Also humors gathered together in the liver; and sometimes it happens
through imperfect cleansing of the Gall, Spleen, Raines, and Intestines. Also
through cold.

There is pain in the right side, Signa.

He can hardly lie upon his sides, and especially on the right side; his face is
very black, he has no appetite, his urine is blood-red, especially if the
impostume be hot; he has a cough, and also the hick-cough, parbreaking, short
oreath, retention of urine, and great thirst. If cold be the cause, there is
heaviness and oppression. ^uratio. ^^uae-sectio

CHAP. XLI.
PESTIS. (...).
The plague is an horrid disease, venomous, and contagious; loathsome, noysom,
fearful, and hateful to mankind; yea and deadly for the most part; being
accompanied with variety of grievous sores: as carbuncles, botches, blaines;
and also producing spots and discolorings of the skin; and may fitly be called
(Flagellum Dei pro peccatis mundi) the rod of God for the sins of the world;
for it produces diverse fearful and deadly accidents with great celerity,
seazing upon the animal, vital, and natural faculties; and seldom or never
goes without a fever.

The material cause thereof is sin; Causa. Of the supernatural cause.
For it is a confirmed, constant, and received opinion in all ages amongst
christians, that the plague and other diseases, which violently assail the
life of man, are often sent by the just anger of God, as punishments for our
offenses. Yea when the Almighty will show himself in his fury against dust and
ashes, he can put the host of heaven in his order, to fight against us) (Nam
astra regunt homines, sed regit astra Dens;) for the stars govern man's body,
and God governs the stars. And we have no way to escape his judgments, but by
prayer, and unfeigned repentance.

This furious disease, as it were disdaines any general method of cure, when it
is in his rage; so that we must needs conclude (Quicquid facimus mortale genus,
quicquid patimur, venit ab alto) that whatsoever man does, or whatsoever man
suffers, all proceeds from above. And as for all other natural or efficient
causes, they are constellated, put on, and put off by divine providence, viz.
ex praescientia Dei, by the foreknow ledge of God.

The terrestrial causes thereof, are venomous, Of the natural causes.
and stinking vapors arising (by the warmth of the Sun, and so communicated to
the Air) from dunghils, sincks, channels, vaults, or the like; as also from
unclean slaughter-houses of beasts, unclean dwelling-houses, Lanes, Allies, and
Streets, in great Cities, as in London, etc. Also want of food, and unwholsom
food, and the eating of abundance of raw fruits, may be a great cause of the
increase of the plague. See lib. 2. chap. 12.

It begins cold, Signa. Of the precedent and accidental signs of the plague.
and with pain in the head and stomach, and sometimes in the back, being
commonly taken for an Ague.

In some also it begins hot, with pain and giddiness of the head: others
find a general discouragement and weakness over all their whole body; many are
taken with great desire to sleep; but it is not safe to permit such to sleep
before a Diaphoretick be administered, to send forth the venomous vapors by
sweat.

In some it begins with a raging and fierce fever, so that their speech
fail them, and their eyes turn strangely to and fro in a fearful manner; being
in their slumbers oppressed with grievous and fearful dreams, and fantasies.

In others it begins with sweatings, with pain of the back, and a stinking
breath; and such are ever very doubtful of cure, and ten to one but they have
inward carbuncles. The one cheek is red, and the other pale, others have sweat
drops on their noses, a fierce countenance, with grinding of the teeth.

And to be brief, no symptom of any disease, but is incident to the infected
of the plague.

The signs that presage death are these that follow, Prognostic.
namely, when the Patient is possessed with swounding, and faintings, with cold
and clammy sweats, often changing of the countenance, vomiting of sharp, slimy,
and ill colored phlegm; with greenish, yellowish, blackish, or blood-coloured
sanies, or avoiding excrements, either fatty, blackish, unctuous, or
unnaturally stinking, convulsions, contractions of the nerves, graveling and
pidling with the fingers, plucking up of the bed-clothes; a sudden flux of the
belly of stinking matter, rusty, or of a greenish color. A sudden going back
of an impostume, carbuncle, or Bubo. Also it is a deadly sign in the
pestilence, to have a continual burning fever, the tongue dry, rough, and
black, with unquenchable thirst, and great watching; to have frenzy and
madness together, the hicket, heart-beating, and the face pale, black, of an
horrid and cruel aspect; bedewed with a cold sweat. Also when the Patient is
insensible of the departure of his urine, and excrements.

There are some have ulcerous and painful weariness, pricking under the skin,
with great torment and pain. The eyes look cruelly, and staringly, the voice
waxes hoarse, and the understanding decaying; so that the Patient talks of
frivolous things; these show the plague to be deadly. Also if the urine be
pale, or black, and the contents blew, greenish, fatty, or oily. Or if the
flesh of the Carbuncle be dry, and black, or the flesh about it be black and
blew.

If the eyes wax dim, if the nostrils be contracted or drawn together, if the
mouth be drawn aside, or if the nails be black, then you may prognosticate that
death is at hand; yet you may use cordial medicines, but it is too late to
purge, or let blood.

The symptoms of recovery are these, namely, when the fever cease, the sick
person takes moderate rest, a botch come to good suppuration, a carbuncle to
separation, or a blain to yield his usual indigested quitture, with mitigation
of the dolor; or that the blaines withering by Gods mercy, through cordial
diaphoreticks (for no sores heal faster then pestilential sores do) or that a
cheerfulness in the sick appear, these are all good signs.

Now the three certain outward signs of the plague are these.

1. First, the Bubo pestilentialis, Bubo pestilentialis.
which is a tumor at the beginning long and moveable, but in the state
immovable; with a sharp head, and fixed deeply in the glandules or kernels, by
which the brain exonerates it self of the venomous and pestiferous matter, into
the kernels that are behind the ears, and the neck the heart into those that
are in the arm-holes; and the liver into those that are in the groin. It is a
deadly sign if the tumor be livid or black, and come very slowly unto his just
bigness, or if it increase suddenly, and come to his just bigness, as it were
with a swift violence, and as in a moment, have all the symptoms in the
highest excess; as pain, swelling, and burning. But if it be red, and increase
by little and little, it is a good sign.

2. (...).
The second outward sign, is that most fierce burning carbuncle called
Anthrax, or the burning cole, which happens in any part of man's body without
order or rule, within the body as well as without.

It appears commonly inflamed and hard, and in the midst thereof, they feel
burning pain like to burning fire, so that it will sometimes blister, which
pain is so fierce and great, that the Patient grows to be mad with extremity
thereof.

It is round in shape or figure, and the color uncertain, for sometimes it is
pale, sometimes reddish, sometimes black, or purple, or greenish; and the two
last are most fearful, and deadly signs. You shall see some carbuncles smooth
as glass, of a blackish shining color, not unlike pitch; with intolerable
pain, and the member whereon they are fixed, will be ponderous and unwildy to
move to and fro.

This disease is seldom healed without so much loss of the musculous flesh and
skin, as it takes first hold of, in what part soever it happen; except the
fury thereof in the beginning be changed, by sweating medicines. The carbuncle
seldom or never comes to suppuration, but it will admit separation, and in
time will come to fall out (if nature be strong) as a gangrenated part does in
one entire piece, from the sound. But if it grow black, and separate not, and
the fever does not abate, then it may be feared, death is at hand.

3. The third sign is the pestilential blain: Pustula pestilentialis.
it is a painful and angry push, somewhat like the small pock, yet in color
more red, and cloudy; and far more painful, with a small head, of an angry
blew, or reddish color. Sometimes of a lead color, and somewhat hard or
fleshy; some have many, others not one. This blain seldom kills, for by
virtue of good medicines, and by the strength of nature, it dries away, and
requires no other cure: Maculae pestilentae.
There may be added a fourth sign of the plague, namely marks or spots,
commonly called by the name of purples, and tokens; but they are not always
certain signs of the pestilence. These spots are upon some like flea-bitings,
in others larger, in some as big as a penny, being of diverse colors, as red,
yellow, brown, violet, or purple (and therefore called the purples) blew and
black; and also of a lead color, and are ever without pain; yet they produce
faintings, swoundings, trembling of the heart, and oftentimes death.

If they are of a purple or black color, with often swounding, and sink in
suddenly without any manifest cause, they foreshew death.

But first for prevention, Curatio.
two things are of chief account; the first is, that we strengthen our bodies,
and the principal parts thereof, against the daily imminent invasions of the
poison, or the pestiferous and venenate air. The other, that we abate the force
of it, that it may not imprint its virulencie in the body; which may be done,

1. Phlebotomia.
First, by purging and bleeding, and shunning much variety of meats, which are
easily corrupted in the stomach, and cause obstructions.

2. Secondly, let the belly have due evacuation, either by Nature, or Art.

3. Thirdly, let the heart, the seat of life, and the rest of the Bowels, be
strengthened with Cordials, and Antidotes, applied, and taken.

4. Fourthly, if thou can make choice of a pure air, and far remote from
stinking places.

5. Fifthly, kindle a clear fire in all the lodging rooms, and perfume the
whole house with aromatic things. Fumigatio.
As frankincense, myrrh, benzoin, Ladanum, styrax, lavender, rosemary, sage,
savory, wild time, marjarum, broom, pieces of fur, juniper berries, or
cloves; also vinegar sprinkled upon hot bricks, and let your clothes be aired
in the same.

6. Sixthly, whilst the plague is hot, stir not out of door before the
rising of the Sun; and persuade the Magistrates, that the Canons (laded only
with powder) may be discharged morning and evening, turning their mouths upon
the City.

7. Seventhly, all public and great meetings and assemblies must be shunned;
you must do nothing in a pestilent season, whereby you may grow hot, Venus.
and therefore venery is chiefly to be eschewed.

Let the poorer sort which are not able to purchase rich cordials, Allium.
take garlic in a morning, with a draught of good wine, for it being
abundantly diffused over all the body, fills up the passages thereof, and
strengthens it in a moment.

Amongst cordial remedies Aqua Theriacalis, is much commended, being drunk,
Aquae opt.
and rubbed on the nostrils, mouth, and ears; for it strengthens the heart,
expells poison, and is not only good for a preservative, but also to cure the
disease it self. The confection of Alkermes, and Clove-gilliflowers are good.
Also the pills of Ruffus are accounted most effectual preservatives against
this disease, Pilulae.
so that Ruffus himself says, Ruffus.
that he never knew any to be infected, that used them. Some roll in their
mouth, and chaw between their teeth the root of Angelica; Angelica.
others drink wormwood wine.

To be short, Treakle and Mithridate, faithfully compounded, excel all
cordial medicines; adding for every half ounce of them, Electuarium.
one ounce and an half of conserve of Roses, or of Bugloss; and three dragmes
of Bolearmenick prepared: Mithridates.
Mithridates highly commends Walnuts, take two in number, those that be very
dry, two figs, Mixturae.
twenty leaves of Rue, and three grains of salt, beat and incorporate them
together, and take the quantity of a Hasel nut at a time fasting, and drink a
little wormwood-wine after it.

Also pomanders are good, and it will be very convenient to apply to the region
of the heart, a bag filled with yellow sanders, Saculus.
mace, cloves, cinnamon, saffron, and treakle; shaken together and
incorporated, and sprinkled over with strong vinegar and rosewater in summer,
and with strong wine in winter. Thus much for prevention.

1. Now so soon as one is blasted with the pestiferous air, after he has
taken some preservative against the malignity thereof; he must withdraw himself
into some wholesome Air. And it were good to hang the chamber, and also the
bed, with thick or course brown linen clothes, moystened in vinegar and water
of roses. And sweet fires may be made of Juniper, Ash, Benzoin, etc.

2. Victus ratio.
Their diet must be cooling and drying. And first of all begin the cure with an
Antidote; because by its specific property, it defends the heart from poison;
and drives and expels it out of all the body, by sweat, vomiting, scouring, and
other kinds of evacuation. The Antidote I would have you make choice of,
Theriaca Mithridatum.
is Treakle, or Mithridate, that is three or four years old, which excel all
other Antidotes; for by strengthening the noblest part, and the mansion of
life, they repair and recreate the wasted spirits, and overcome the poison;
not only being taken inwardly, but also applied outwardly to the Region of the
heart, botches, and carbuncles: for by an hidden property they draw the poisons
unto them.

If there be great heat, Mixtura.
mix with Treakle or Mithridate the juice of limmons in sorrel water. The
Patient ought to walk presently after he has taken his Antidote, but yet as
moderate as he can: After that he must be put warm to bed, and covered with
many clothes, and apply swines bladders filled full of Carduus water, to the
groines and arm-holes, to procure sweat; for sweating in this disease is a most
excellent remedy. When he has sweat sufficiently, according to the strength of
his body, let the sweat be wiped with warm clothes, and dried. Let him be kept
from sleep (if possible) until the third or fourth day; yet if necessity
require, he may sleep, but not above three or four hours on a day and a night;
but not at all on the first day.

After sweating, let him take the rind of a preserved citron, conserve of
roses, bread tosted and steeped in wine, the meat of preserved myrabolane, or
the like; then let him eat of some cordial confection. And you may make
Epithemes after the following forms.. Aquar. rosar. and melissae, ana. iv.

use them, take some portion of them in a vessel by its self, wherewith let the
affected bowel be fomented warm, many will not allow either of purging or
bleeding in this disease. I confess in weak bodies it ought to be neglected;
but in strong bodies that abound with corrupt humors, both are necessary to be
done: Hippocrat. Sec. 2. Aphor. 22.
for Hippocrates says, Morbos ex repletione ut curat evacuatio, sic eos qui ex
evacuatione fiunt repletio, etc. The best way if purging be fit, is to take six
or ten grains of scammonie, Purgatio. Pilulae.
beaten into powder, with one dragme of Mithridate or Treakle. Ruffus his pills
may be profitably given, half a dragm at a time every morning, two or three
hours before meat; they ate to be had at the Apothecaries. Agaricus.
The ancient Physicians have greatly commended Agarick for this disease,
because it does draw the noisome humors out of all the members; let it be
elected and prepared truly into Trochisces. Also Antimonium is highly praised
by the experience of many: Antimoniu^.
So is mugwort, and the pickle of Anchovis; Vide Rond elet lib. 7. de pis. c 3.
for some have taken eight ounces at a draught, and have been freed from this
disease, so that it has been counted a most certain and approved remedy
against the pestilence.

1. Cucurbitulae.
So soon as the Bubo appears if nothing forbid, apply a cupping-glasse with a
great flame unto it; and let it stick to the part for the space of a quarter of
an hour, and be renewed again every three quarters of an hour. Then apply this
liniment, Linimet^.
take Vnguentum dialthaea, one ounce and an half; oil of scorpions half an
ounce, of mithridate dissolved in aqua vitae half a dragm.

After it is fomented, Cataplas.
fill a great onion (being hollowed) with Treakle, and the leaves of Rue, then
roast it under the hot embers, beat it with a little leven, and a little swines
grease; and so apply it warm unto the Abscess or sore; let it be changed every
six hours until it be grown unto its full ripeness and bigness.

If the inflammation be great, Cataplas.
make a Cataplasme with the roots of marsh mallows, and lillies of each half a
pound. Of line, sorrel, and fenugreek, of each half an ounce; of Treakle one
dragme, ten Figs, and as much hog's grease as shall suffice, make a Cataplasme
according to art.

When the Bubo is come to perfect suppuration, it must be opened with an
incision-knife, or with a potential cauterie; the rest of the cure is easily
performed.

2. So soon as the carbuncle appears, Fomentatio
Let it be fomented with water, and oil mixed together, wherein a little
treakle has been dissolved. The day following, Cataplas.
take the leaves of sorrel and henbane, roast them under the hot ashes,
afterward beat them with four yelks of eggs, two dragmes of treakle, oil of
lillies three ounces, barley meal as much as may suffice; make thereof a
Cataplasme, and apply it.

And round about the carbuncle, Medicaementune.
lay the salve of fine Bolus, made with vinegar and rose water, for to defend
the parts adjacent from heat. Also Scabions brayed between two stones, Aliud.
and mixed with hog's grease, the yelks of eggs, and a little salt, is much
commended by the Ancicients. Rapbanus rustican.
And a radish root cut in slices, and so the slices laid one after one unto a
carbuncle or pestilent tumor, does mightily draw out the poison.

In the beginning the point or head of the carbuncle must be burned if it be
black, Aq fortis.
by dropping on scalding hot oil, or Aqua fortis: After this burning, hasten
the falling away of the eschar, which will seem to separate it self from the
flesh round about it, and is a token of the Patients recovery, etc. A Carbuncle
and Bubo are tumors of a near affinity, consisting of one kind of matter,
unless that which makes the Bubo is more gross and clammie; and that which
causes the carbuncle more sharp, burning, and raging, by reason of its greater
subtility; so that it makes an eschar on the place where it is. Their cures
are somewhat alike, only the carbuncle requires things to be applied that are
of a more cooling quality, then the Bubo does.

3. Lastly, Blaines, or Eruptions, and Spots, are cured, only by driving forth;
for which purpose minister Treakle or Mithridate inwardly, to procure sweat: or
this ointment following will be good to draw them forth. Take of hog's grease
one pound, Vnguentu^.
boil it a little with the leaves of sage, time, rosemary, of each half a
handful; strain it, and in the straining extinguish five ounces of
Quicksilver, which has been first boiled in vinegar, with the forementioned
herbs; of Sal nitrum three dragms; the yelks of three eggs, boiled until they
be hard; of Treakle and Mithridate of each half an ounce; of Venus Turpentine,
oil of Scorpions, and Bays, of each three ounces; incorporate them all
together in a mortar, and make thereof an unguent, wherewith anoint the
Patients arm-holes, and groins; avoiding the parts that belong to the head,
breast, and backbone, then let him be laid in his bed, and sweat.

When the spots and pustules do all appear, it shall be convenient to use
diuretic medicines. And this may suffice for a discreet student, as concerning
the cure of that cruel and contagious disease, called the plague.
