A pleasant new Ballad of two Lovers.
To a pleasant new Tune.


Complain my Lute complain on him
that stays so long away,
He promised to be here ere this,
but still unkind does stay.
But now the Proverb true I find,
once out of sight then out of mind:
Hey hoe my heart is full of woe.
Peace liar peace, it is not so,
he will by and by be here:
But every one that is in Love,
thinks every hour a year.
Hark, hark, me thinks I hear one knock
run quickly then and turn the lock,
Then farrewell all my care and woe.
Come gallant now, come loyterer,
for I must chide with thee:
But yet I will forgive thee once,
come sit thee down hy me,
Fair Lady rest your self content,
I will endure your punishment,
And then we shall be friends again.
For every hour that I have staid
so long from thee away,
A thousand kisses will I give,
receive them ready pay.
And if we chance to count amiss
again we will reckon them every kiss,
For he is blessed that is punished so.
And if those thousand kisses then
we chance to count aright
We shall not need to count again
till we in bed do light:
And then be sure that thou shall have,
thy reckoning just as thou shall crave.
So shall we still agree as one.
And thus they spent the silent night,
in sweet delightful sport,
Till Phoebus with his beams so bright,
from out the fiery port
Did blush to see the sweet content,
in sable night so vainly spent,
Betwixt these Lovers two.
And then this Gallant did persuade,
that he might now be gone:
Sweetheart, quoth he, I am afraid,
that I have stayed too long.
And will thou then be gone, quoth she,
and will no longer stay with me:
Then welcome all my care and woe.
And then she took her Lute in hand,
and thus began to play,
Her heart was faint she could no stand,
but on her bed she lay.
And art thou gone my love, quoth she,
complain my Lute, complain with me
Until that he does come again.
FINIS.
