BY THE KING
A Proclamation against the Opression of the Clergy by the Intrusion of
Factious and Schismatic Persons into their Cures, and inverting and
detaining their Tithes, and possessions by Orders of one or both Houses of
Parliament, contrary to all Law and Justice.
WHEREAS by the Great Charter of the Liberties of England it is provided, that
the Church should have all its Rights whole, and the Liberties inviolable and
amongst others the Church has these Privileges, That regularly no
Ecclesiastical Possessions may be extended, seized or sequestered but by the
Ordinary, And that Distresses may not be taken of Lands wherewith Churches have
been anciently envowed; And that Churches presentative cannot be filled, and
the Lawful Incumbents; hereof removed but by the Ordinary, nor the Cure of the
Incumbents served by Curates, Lecturers or others, but by their own
appointment, or in their default by the appointment of the Ordinary; neither
are any of Our Subjects of the Laity by the Common-Lawes of Our Realm capable
to take or receive Tithes (which are the portion of the Clergy) unless by
demisse from them, or such as are appropriate and made Lay-Fee: Nevertheless
by color of Orders or pretended Ordinances of one or both Houses of
Parliament, the Estates Real and Personal as well of Our Clergy as La^ty have
been and are daily seized, sequestered and taken from them, and their
Possessions d^strayned for illegal Taxes and Contributions for supporting the
Rebellion against Us; Which being clearly against Law and unwarrantable, We did
forbid by Our Proclamation of the seventh of April last, and do hereby forbid
the same, under the penalties in that Our Proclamation contained. And whereas
diverse of Our Clergy Eminent for their Piety and Learning, because they publish
Our Lawful and Just Commands and Declarations, and will not, against the known
Laws of the Land and their own Consciences, submit to Contributions, nor
publicly pray against Us and Our Assistants, but conform themselves to the
Book of Common Prayer established by Law, and Preach Gods Word according to the
Purity thereof, and in their Sermons will not teach Sedition, nor will publish
illegal Commands and Orders for fomenting the unnatural War Levied against
Us, are some of them driven and forced from their Cures and Habitations, some
others Silenced and discharged from the Exercise of their Cures, and Persecuted
and their Curates, if Orthodox, displaced, and others who are Factious and
Schismatic intruded and put in, to sow Sedition and seduce Our good Subjects
from their Obedience, expressly contrary to the Word of God, and the Laws of
the Land, and the Giebs, Tithes, and other Emoluments of Right belonging to
such Incumbents as will not conform to that Faction, are diverted in all
Parishes where such Arbitrary power prevails, and distributed, part to such
Factious Curates, and the test to the maintenance of this War, against Law
and the Liberties of the Church; Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, and We do
hereby straightly charge and command all Our Subjects as well Ecclesiastical as
Temporal, not to presume to intermeddle in discharging or hindering any of Our
said Clergy for the cause aforesaid, or any other the like pretenses, or any of
them from the exercise of their Cures and Functions, or in displaceing the said
Curates substituted by them, nor do presume to intrude or cause any Curates,
Lecturers or others, to be intruded or put into fuch Curates substituted by
them, delete the records or to take or dispose the Globe; Tithes, Fruits, or
Emoluments belonging to any of our said Clergy, Who are so silenced, forced
from their Cures, and persecuted as aforesaid, And we do hereby require and
command all Our Subjects duly to set forth and pay their Tithes to their
several and respective lawful Incumbents of their Parishes or to their
Farmors Assigns, or Deputies, without any guile or fraud; and so as the same
may be received and enjoyed by the same Incumbents, without any diminution,
substraction or diversion, notwithstanding any sequestration or pretend Orders
or Ordinaces, or other command whatsoever of one or both Houses of Parliament.
And if any Person or Persons whatsoever shall presume to transgress this Our
Command, We do hereby Declare and Signify, That they do not only oppugue and
infring the good old Laws of the Land and the Liberties of the Church (which
all Our Subjects, as well as Our Self, are bound to mantaine and observe) but
do also assist a Rebellion against Us, for which We shall proceed against them
according Law, as they shallbe apprehended and brought to the Hands of Justice
and will give direction for taking their Lands and Goods into safe Custody in
the mean time.

And We do hereby farther straightly commmand and require all Churchwardens,
Sides-men and Patishiones whatsoever, to resist all such Persons as shall be so
intruded or put into any of the Cures aforesaid by, or upon pretense of any
such pretense of any such pretended Orders or Ordinances or commands as
aforesaid, and to assist (as much as in them lies) the Lawful Ancumbents,
their Curates, Farmors, Assigns or Deputies, in the receaving taking and
enjoying the Glebe, Tithes, Fruits Emoluments to them of right belonging,
Willing and commanding all Sheriffs, Majors, Bayliffes, Justices and Peace,
Constables, Head-boroughs and other Our Officers and loving Subjects
what is;oever, upon their Allegianc, and the severest punishment that by the Law
may be unflicted upon them, not only to obey and observe carfuly these Our
co^ma^ds, but to be aiding and assisting to the utmost of their power to all
such Persons as shall requirs their assistance and Protetection in this
behalf, and to resist and repel, by force of Arms, all such as shall oppose
this Our Legal command. And Our Will and pleasure is, That this Our
Proclamation be read in all Churches and Chappells in this Our Kingdom.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the Fifteenth day of May, in the Ninteenth year
of Our Reign. May. 27. 1643
