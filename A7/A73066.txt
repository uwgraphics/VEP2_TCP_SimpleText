Jesus confronts a man on his knees

Jesus confronts a man on his knees

Deus.
Our gracyous god most in magnyfyce^ce
His merciful eyes casts from heue on hy
Seeing his creatures in deedly vyole^ce
Himself complayneth by pity full ruthfully
Saying o man deuoyde of intellygence
Open thyn eeres unto my call and cry
And tell me if I have done to the offense
That thou forsakest my wyllyngly
Man such a love to the I did take
This world in seven days when I it wrought
Thou was the last thing that I did make
Because I would thou wanted naught
What thing the might help did not lake
That at thy need if it were sought
Foul fysshe all thing for thy sake
For thy comfort all was forth brought
More over I gave the that dygnyte
All beestes to bow the until
I made the also like unto me
And gave the conning and free will
Me to serve that thou should se
To chose the good and leave the ill
I ask nothing again of the
But love thy sovereign as it is skyll
But unto this take thou none entente
Thou tournest fro me full unkindly
On loves unlawful thy love is lent
Thy heart beholds not heaven so hye
For all the goods I have the sent
The lysteth not ones to say gramercye
In time to come or thou repent
Man make amends or that thou dye Remors of conscy.
A christian soul conceived in sin
Received in conscience thus complanynge
He fell dowue flat with delefull dynne
And said lord mercy sovereign king
I most unkind wretch of man kynne
I know I am thy traitor untrue in my living
This wicked life that I live in
I may it naught hyde from thy knowing
I want words and also wit
Of thy kyndnesse to speak a cause
That I have thou gave me it
Of thy goodness withouten cause
Though I have grieved the and do yet
Thy benefaytes thou naught withdrawse
I have deserved to have hell pytte
So have I lived against thy lawse
But lord thou know man's feblenesse
How frail it is and has been aye
For thought the soul have thy likeness
Man is but fulsome earth and clayne
In sin conceived and wretchedness
And to the soul rebel always
First a man grows as does gresse
And he wastes after as flowers or hay
Sith man is than so frail a thing
And thy power so great in kind
This world is but a twynkelynge
Thou may destroy the might of the fend
With thy right lordemercy mynge
And to my sore salve thou send
Sore merepenteth of my myslyuynge
Mercy lord I will amend
Man if thou amends will make
Give thyn alms of thyn own goods
And se thou works no man to wrake
To venge any other men's modes
If thou untruly from any take
And therewith find forty their fodes
Such sacrefyce I forsake
They be to me as sour as worm wode
The poor people thou do oppress
With sleyghtes and wyles many one
Thou make chyrches and do sing mess
Thou mendest ways where men over gone
And some men curse and some men bless
Which shall I here of these two
I thou will have grace as I guess
Let all falsnes be fled the fro
The mothes that thy clothes ete
And thou let poor men go bare
Thy drink soureth and mouleth thy mete
Wherewith the poor man might well fare
The rust that thy silver does frete
Thy goods that evil gotten are
They cry on the vengeance great
The for to spyll but yet I spare
With hodest here against the right
From thy servants upon the cry
Man oftentimes thou have me hygth
Thou would amend and leave folly
Thou spekest full fair both day and night
Thou brekest my commandments co^tynually
yet is me loathe with the to fight
But make amends or that thou dye
Sweet lord I may not against say
I have not holden that I the hight
I grieve the gretely every day
I do not as I had the plyght
In would do well but welawaye
With enemies I am ever beset
When my soul feign would the pay
My flesh is first that will me let
And ever the fader that I it feed
Ever the fressher it is my foo
yet bear it about I must need
Full feeble it is it will me sloo
The world / the fend / the flesh they bid
Some with well and some with woo
What may I do with a wicked wede
To fight against three enemies so
When I enforce me other whiles
And think I will live a true live
And forsake all batayles and gyles
The world byddeth me battle belyue
And but I will use wrethes and wyles
The comym voice is I shall not tryue
Some me scorneth and at me smyles
And count me but a kind caytyue
But now I think withstondynge this
To forsake falsnes withouten end
And restore that I took amys
And pay my dettes fair and hende
And to reward each man his
As reason is than will I spend
And give mine alms there need is
Mercy Ihesu I will amend
Man I have sent the kyndly sight
And vndestandynge skyll and wit
To rule thy self by reason right
As reherseth holy writ
That clearly shows the godly light
How thou should deedly sin forsake
And on that manner thou please me might
What ayleth the thus fro me to shake
World richesse ryall repair
In wealth and things of Iolyte
Fysshes / beestes / and birds of the air
These thinks me semely for to se
That thing yt peryssheth and does appayre
Unto thy sight thus pleasynge be
Well may thou wit I am full fair
Of whom each thing has this beauty
But man as thou wytlesse were
Thou lokest aye downwarde as a be
It behooves the of me to here
Foul speaking is to the a feast
I comfort the I make the chere
And thou in wardly love me leest
I call the to me year by year
Thou will not come at my reqest
As fro thy foo thou fro me feles
I follow the fast and on the cry
Thou wrappest the with all vanytes
And think my speech to the but folly
And a thing that noutght is you will lose
My Joy that lasts endleslye
Man yet vice leave and virtue chese
And make amends or that thou dye
Sweet Ihesu none answer I can
But often cry mercy with heart stable
Alas for woo why is a man
Worse than a be unreasonable
All beestes sytheathe world began
In kyndely werkynge ben durable
Save only I of will wan
That do full many deeds dampnable
I was made to know my maker
And to love him over all thing
And I a sleper and never waker
To take kind knowing of my king
To tryfles have I ben a great head taker
A song of sorrow may I sing
For had I ben of sin a forsaker
Of christ should I have had some knowing
My ghoostly eyes ben full of lust
Cursed couetyse has blinded me
They ben blood shotten with fleshely lust
That heavenly king may I not se
But lord though I have been unjust
Thorough help of thy benygnyte
I hope to rube away the ruste
With repentance and grace of the
And where that I have before this
My will in world thing have spend
From hens forward my purpose is
Thy law to learn to my lives end
Thy. x. commandments truly I wys
Them to keep I will me mende bend
And there as I have done amys
Mercy Ihesu I will amend
Man if thou will my mercy get
Through my passion of most virtue
Why ceasest thou not me for to beat
Each day on the cross do me new
With deedly sin on morrow at mete
As tourmentours to me untrue
And namely with thy oaths great
To swear thou will no thing eschew.
No lymme of me / nor thou derest
Why say thou evil against good
By my soul often time thou swerest
By my body and by my blood
With thy tongue thou me all to terest
When thou art wroth and almoost woman with thyn unkindness thou me d^ re^t
More than they rent me on the rode
Thou have more pity of thy too
If it be hurt and a little blede
And all that ever that I did do
I suffered it for thy mysdede
When thou art taught that thou should do
Of swerynge but when it were need
Thou scornest them that says so
Thou take to my bidding no head
Loud lesynges on me thou make
Sometime to win an half penny
When to witness thou me take
And yet for swerest the wylfully
Byenge and selling thou not forsakest
But vain and falls to swear me by
When thou do thus thy bale thou take
Man make amends or that thou dye Remors of conscy.
Sweet Jesus how should I again say
But that I am a caytyfe and more curste
That does on the curse every day
With great oaths and works worste
And much more the greueth than they
On caluary that flewe first
For had they known the for god very
^o do the to death they had not durst
^ut I know after my believe
That thou art god omnypotent
^^d I seace not the to grieve
Well worthy I am to be shente
How may thou lord suffer to meue
Of the traitors that the tourment
Marvel it is I do not myscheue
Or am not killed / drownet / or brent
The earth opened and swalowed quycke
Satan and abyron for their sin
And as I wene they were never so wycke
As most certyfefull mankynne
Indeedly sin men dye now thycke
Disease full great now does begin
Yet in my sin I stand and stycke
Evil custom is full hard to blynne
I would be wanton and do evil
But I would none me reprehende
But let me live after my will
This was lefull sometime I wend
But now I se that it is skyll
^uche light lord thou haste me send
^^t I leave sin it will me spyll
^ercy lord I will amend
Man do penance while thou mor
Leest suddenly I take vengeance
Bydd^ I the not day by day
For cause I would thou did penance
Man I am more ready always
To forgive thy mysgouernaunce
When you of all thy friends haste made assaye
Thou shalt find none like to me
Thou will amend oftetymes thou sa^^^
Again amends no man may^e
Do true penance and I am paid
From endless pain to make the fre
For thy love my life I laid
What friend should have done so for the
With sorrowful heart thy sin thou shryue
And make amends to thyn enemy
If thou thus leave thy wicked live
I will be thereof glad truly
Think oftentimes of lothes wine
And turn not to thy sin again
Let no dyspayre down the drive
Think on Peter and Magdalayne
Man wype away thy wickedness
And keep my bidding by and by
And thou shalt have in my palesse
Worship withouten vylany
No pouerte but all rychenesse
Health / strength / and wisdom truly
Thou shalt be full of all swetnesse
And than to live and neuermore dye
Grant mercy Ihesu croppe and rote
Of all frendshyp for in none fayles
Ayen^ ^he I wy^ not mote
But as often as me evil ails
I will fall down flat to thy foot
To help me in ghoostly batayles
Now wot I where I shall me hyde
When I am styred to any sin
In the great wound of thy right side
And be hertely hid therein
As in a toure there may I abide
For ought ye find can me ymagyn
For all this world that is so wide
Therein is sovereign medecyn
There may no wanhope make me care
That have of they aungeiles so good
To keep me that I not mysfare
And thy mother myldest of mode
Lord shende us thy wounds then
And than of mercy we may not mysse
And than to help christian men
Now Ihesu lord thou us wysse
That we with the may bide to bliss
In Joy and bliss withouten end
That to thy people ordained is
That leave sin and them amend
AMEN.
