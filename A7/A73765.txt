Good News to Christendom. Sent to a Venetian in Ligorne, from a Merchant in
ALEXANDRIA. Discovering a wonderful and strange Apparition, visibly seen for
many days together in Arabia, over the place, where the supposed Tomb of
MAHOMET (the Turkish Prophet) is enclosed: By which the learned Arabians
prognosticate the Reducing and Calling of the great Turk to Christianity.
With many other notable Accidents: But the most remarkable is the miraculous
rayning of Blood about ROME. Done out of the Italian.

LONDON, Printed for NATHANIEL BVTTER. 1620.

THE TRANSLATOR to the Reader.
Gentle Reader:
I Confess unto you, when this letter came first into my hand; which was about
the 20 of December, brought as it should seem by some of the last Venetian
company, I read it as a thing according to the Italian phrase, trouata or
bugiarda; and christened it with this opinion, that it could march in no other
rank of verity, then amongst our selves the Sussex Serpent, the German
Ghosts, and the great Army met in Tartarie marching by the Caspian shore over
Taurus, all which of my own knowledge came out of the shop of invention, and
were beholding more to devise, then either religion or discretion: so that in a
manner I disclaimed the translating of it, and put it from me with a kind of
contracted brow: but in truth there were certain reasons, which got the
masterie over my Judgment, and kept that a while predominant against further
presumption. First, the difficulty of the style, being my self a very poor
Linguist. For had not the pulling hook of Florios Dictionarie brought many
words nearer unto me, they had all passed for strangers, and those which you
have, merely come from the apprehension of the sentence in the coherence of
the matter, rather then the particular signification of the words by
themselves. Secondly, the time, wherein we live, not like that concise
Historiographer Cornelius Tacitus, who spoke what he thought, and wrote what he
spoke; but we as soldiers under good Commanders, who must simply obey, and
though never so wise, dispute not a word by way of contestation with the
business imposed. Thirdly, a private conference with some Italians, who only put
it off with a shrug of the shoulder, when any thing is distasting unto them:
although some of them went further, and cried out aloud, as their manner is,
Cancro and Cazzo when they dislike a thing. Last of all, my own poor
affairs, which have busied me otherwise, and out of the rules of morality
tied me to the prevention of wants, and that intolerable and insupportable
vexation to depend upon any man's bounty. For questionles Friendship now adays
is but like a fire from a painted cloth, which for all the brave show
reflecteth no warmth: so that I may well conclude with the Dutchman, he never
fared worse then when he wished for his dinner: notwithstanding all these
reasons, and some thing else more pleasantly enforced, the importunity of my
friends, and that same auri sacra fames, got the upper hand of nicitie, and not
only put the book into my hand, but extracted this poor revolution out of a
barren spring, which more and more I confess opened her self from my own
affection to the matter and poor experience of certain repinings even amongst
the Turks themselves, against the long protraction of Mahomets return, being
now full 40 year elapsed beyond their own account, and his promise to bring
them glad tidings of a new Paradise: and in truth when I considered those
excellent praedictions of Scripture, that Antichrist shall not only be
discovered, but even punished in this world; that the Jews should be recalled,
and all apparently to be seen before that doom of doomes, and scourge of
incredulity, the terror of the last judgment, I cast up a new account for the
entertaining this relation, and rancked it thus in the maniple of my endeavors,
which though it troop with a file or two, yet according to the straitnes of
the passage may serve the turn, as well as a greater Army, or stronger
forces. Accept it then, good Reader, and if you be not curious concerning the
fullnes of truth, and infallibility of the matter; you may make this bulrush
of novelty hold up your head in the calmer waters of security, that you sink
not over head and ears into pride, contempt, and carelesnes. First,
considering God has such a work to bring to pass, and he will finish it in
his due time. Secondly, that although the Vrim and the Thummim cease, and
miracles are very sparing; yet the heavens declare the glory of God, and many
fearful accidents have bin prefigured by apparition. Thirdly, that therefore
the heavens burn first to light us the way to repentance, and seeing there
must come a dissolution of all things, to prepare our hearts to put confidence
in nothing: Fourthly, and that we be not so stupefied, as not to admire the
Apocalypse of hidden mysteries, but verily believe there is something to be
done, which we cannot apprehend by reason. Last of all, to continue our holy
duties, especially private prayers, and contrition, which shall so mollify our
hard hearts, that they shall make the lifting up of our hands as incense, and
by way of propitiation move God to continue his mercies, and auert his
judgments from us.

TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIGNIOR ALUISO CANDIDO, of the family of Morisini,
resident at LEGORNE, as Governor of the Venetian Factorie there.
Right worthy:
ACcording to the trust reposed in me, I made my commorance in Allexandria, all
the while the goods were vnloding out of the Castor and Pollux of Leuca:
wherein I received those balls of silk, and roules of gold, for which I
presently trucked with Eleazar Bedly the Jew, dwelling in the Semiter street
of the tribe of Isachar, and received in sultaneses and uncut stones, what I
thought correspondent to the value, all which I have returned unto you by my
book of accounts, under the trust of Bartholomeo Ioco the Florentine, who
stands charged and is accountable for the same: the greater stuffs and chests
of glasses are entered into the blancks of the custom house, and you shall
receive the bill of Benjamin Hely the Jew, who is chief farmer under the Basha
for the same: and so when I had thus ordered your business with some
cheerful confidence, that you should receive 4. for one; I took the
opportunity of a Turkish Carmisall, and went presently to Cayro: we took the
middle stream: for you must know, that Nilus brancheth out with 7. heads into
the midland sea, and having a pleasant wind Northwest and by north, quickly
saluted the river in her fullness, which without controversy had driven us
back with the swiftness of his current, had not the goodness of our sails
counterchecked the violence of his speed, so that we made three days journey
of this passage and although I do not accustom to fill up a private letter
with public discourses, either concerning Topography or Poligraphy, yet cannot
I over pass an accident that happened unto us the second day: For a little a
fore noone we heard a great cry among the reeds, and wondering what it was, we
might well perceive it was nothing but a crocadile howling over a woman, whom
it had caught? as if a heard of wolves had bin coming down the mountain to
bark at the moon. And truly Good Sir, it is strange to relate, how ravenous
and fell in desires these creatures are of women, and will hunt them extremely
by the sent, imitating the Allegators of Guinea, never to show their bodies
till they can obtain their pray: yea such is their manner, that they will
pass by children and men, and take only the opportunity to surprise the
women, whom they will strip as hansomly of their apparel, after they have
brought them to their nests, as if they had bin taught a kind of cunning not to
be combred with their sluttishness: yet must I not let pass this secret of
nature, that they commonly use to pinch the neck and head so at the first,
that the miserable wretch left to a pray finds a courtesy in the dispatch of
her life, for otherwise it were a thousand deaths to be so long a dying,
considering she is three hours a howling over the body, before she devour it,
of which yet how ravenous so ever she be, she leaves the head only untouched,
but after she has done howling, she eats, after eating she weeps, after
weeping she sleeps, and then, they are many times slain, and their young ones
stolen from them: this was the voice we heard, and within an hour after we met
a boat of Aegiptians, who came to seek the woman, and discovered unto us, that
she was a poor man's wife, that had been to gather reeds that morning with
her husband, and by reason of some displeasure, thought to be revenged by
sequestring her self, and so was surprised by the serpent, as a warning to
other women, not to make every small unkindness, the author of a lumpish
countenance, or a sullen heart: the next day we aproached the great City, of
which to talk never so little, would make my letter to great, and besides you
have bin in these parts your self, and make daily use of most vberant
relations, and remarkable circumstances. It was not long ere I prepared my
lodging, nor long ere Signior Stephano Delphino came unto me, who finding more
conueniency in mine then his own, quickly settled himself to bear me company,
nor long ere the great Carauan troup of merchants arrived from Ormus, who came
the next way over Arabia with 600. Camels, and 200. Arabian horse for their
Conuoy, whose intertainement for 5. weeks cost the Merchants 3000. Checkinoes
amongst them: they only tarried a day and a night to make themselves drunk;
which they may quickly do. For though the wine of Palestina, which we much
vented here, be reasonable good, yet as if they would pleasure Bacchus with an
unsatiate desire to cellebrate his Orgies, they intermingled the berries of
Aethiopia, whose fulsome juice do rather intoxicate the brain, then quench
the thirst: The next day they departed, and the next day I singled out the
company, to find what Italians were amongst them: For in a word I never saw
so many strangers in one journey and agreeing so well together, the report of
it was pleasant, but when I heard it from their own mouths, it added both
delight and conte^tme^t, I could both name the parties and the places of their
abode. But because I aim at another mark I will not unfurnish my quiver to
spend a rouing shaft to no purpose, but in a word, here were many of my
acquaintance, amongst whom only Siluano Gritti and Bartholomeo Caponi with two
friars, one an Augustine, another of the order of Serui, lodged in the same
house with us: They spent three days in rest, and rested the night very
soundly, yet the friars were many times iangling, and so angered Signior
Stephano, that ouer-passionate one night he bad the devil take them, whether
they crossed themselves or no: the darkness interdicted my discovery, but I
will be sworn, I heard them thump their breasts to my bed, and I entreated my
Gent: to let them alone. Oh, said the Mendicant friar, little do you know the
disceptation between us, and less may we instruct you in it, till a fitter
opportunity. For we have such a strange story to discourse upon, as will spend
a day in the Epitome, and make all Europe to wonder in the exemplification.

Truly good Sir, the very Emphasis of his words amassed me, and the over desire
of instruction led me presently to the way of vigilance, and I sat up in my
bed, as if I meant to hear a tale indeed, had not Signior Stephano made me
also the subject of his anger, and bad me go out of the bed, if I was so
womanish and idle, that I could not tarry til day light, to hear a lying tale
of a friar.

Till this the Augustine friar was silent, but now in some distemperature
raised his passion, as high as ever Signior Stephanoes was, telling him to his
face, it was spoke like a Lutherane, and Heretic, to lay any such imputation
on men of their quality, religious obseruants, and father-confessors. For they
made a conscience of telling an untruth, and acknowledged it more then a
Venial sin to countenance a lie through the credit of any religious order:
well; said Signior Stephano if you will not lie in your words, yet I pray you
lie still in your beds, and it shall be part of my penance, to acknowledge mine
error, and make a retractation of offending you: This answer made way to the
sedation of this unquietness, and so we gave over our parlee, and made some
use of a mornings sleep.

The next day the friars of themselves remembering their Matutine hours, after
devotion was ouerpassed, came voluntarily into our chamber, and with a small
preamble of pacification prevailed so much with my companion, (who by this time
was as desirous of the nouelty, as my self) that we arose, and because they
would not be interrupted in their discourse, we made a short repast together,
and so locking the door to us, attended the poor Mendicant; who thus began.

My Brother and I about the tenth of September, embarked our selves from Ormus,
and came to Catara, where the Christian Carauan was almost ready for their
voyage to Cayro, but before I proceed any further, I will be plain to tell you
the occasion of our going thither; 1. partly for Curiosity; 2. partly for
Devotion; 3. partly for Wealth.

1. First, for curiosity, the desire of acquaintaince with foreign Countries,
and the willingness to put the Practique in the other scale against the
Theory; or, if you please, to make our superficial reading the sweeter by
industrious experience, taught us the way to conceive, that all Countries might
be national to a wise man.

2. Secondly, concerning Devotion, having long since heard, that the Persians
in this place condiscended even against the rule of their Alchoran, to
communicate with certain Portingall Friars, about the Verity of both
Religions, we thought it not amiss to put it to the trial, whether we might
attain to such a meritorious act as the Conversion of a Mahumetane.

3. Thirdly, concerning Wealth, at the end of August there is a general
fishing for Pearl, by reason that the Oysters in this hot month resort to the
shore, and as if nature had taught them to breathe for air, they gape, as it
were in sholes, and then the fishers, and such as are appointed for this
purpose, throw little peblestones into their mouths, and so keep them from
closing again; and thus are their Pearls kindly taken out, and known to be
full ripe by their color. For you must consider the Pearls grow as the meat
in bigness, and yield great plenty being soft, but afterward most worth of
estimation, as she is Oriental, the shell makes that we call Mother of Pearl,
and in the same they are ranked together like teeth in ones mouth, as if they
were couched in a bed of purpose; sometimes 15. or 16. in a shell, only the
Union has his name of being alone, and I think is privileged with
extraordinary greatness by being alone: Now at every draught (or if you will,
course of separation) they have a custom by way of gratuitie, to give to such
religious men as are resident amongst them, to some more, somelesse, according
as affection shall induce them, so that for my part such as they are, I have
500. to show you: at Catara we had diverse camels, that came from Iafu and
Catiffa: and within three days according to their custom 200. Arabian horse
came from Zoar and Cazape: there was one principal Aga and 4. under Captains,
and so in several companies we prepared for the great desert of Elact, passing
such mountains and strange woods, that the voyage alone were worthy the
description; in regard we found snow in greater abundance, then is in mount
Senese, and so many wild beasts both on the mountains, and in the woods, that
we lay not one night without a hedge of fire, and in several companies we made
a show as it were of a burning camp, and both Lions and Tigers came to see,
what we did, though they durst not approach, we made thirty days of this
travel, and ere we came to Mecha had only sight of 3. Towns, for whose sake
we fetched a great compass, although the pretense was to avoid the hugest
hills, and so we went from Catara to Lagana to Salata and Gacha: from thence
loding our camells with many skins and teeth of beasts, as we vnloded them of
our provision, we came in good time to Mecha. I cannot call it a city because
it is unwalled, nor a village, because it has 8000. houses in it, nor rich
because the opulent merchant lies at Liden a port town upon the red sea, some
50. Italian mile from Mecha, nor poor because it is so populous, for the
resort of so many thousand strangers that come hither to view the tomb of
Mahomet, in which (as I my self was) they are all deceived: for although he
was borne here, and has Charactered with his Fame one of the gloriousest
stories in the world, yet was he not buried here, but by a strange policy
translated over a great desert, to Medina Talnabi, where at this hour is both
his Temple and his Sepulcher; by the way you come to the pretty town of
Tacine: and howsoever any man presumes of his own cunning, and better
intelligence, yet from what coast soever he comes, he must go to Mecha first,
and their receive a ticket from the Beglerbeag; for which he paies half a
florence ducket, ere he can be admitted into the Conuoy for Medina: a littell
apprehension brought us to the knowledge of these things, and so by general
consent, my brother and I to cure our understanding the better, which was
almost vlcerated with strange variety both of report and history, went thither
in person about the end of September, to be beholding to our own experience
against opinion: But before we came thither, we met with many passengers, as it
were distracted with fear, and when we came found all the country confounded
at a vision or apparition, which had lasted for a fortnight, and so continuing:
7. days longer, affrightted the people, and the rather because no man durst
interpret the same, or could indeed be beholding to discovery for the truth;
only one of the Deruices, astonished them with a sudden boldness, and because
here were many of the race of Mahomet, and some Doctors of the law, who
repugning the oratory, rather believed Naturalls and Lunaticks, whom indeed
they immagine extraordinarily inspired with a Supernatural Spirit. the poor
Priest was much offensive in his discourse to them all; so they conspired
against him, and put him to death, by which occasion here are Four remarkable
things to be considered, 1. First the vision it self. 2. Secondly his oration,
3. Thirdly the manner of his execution. 4. Fourthly what a Deruice is.

Concerning the vision about the 20. of September, there happened so great a
tempest, that there was as it were a sencible darkness about midnight, so
fearful a thunder, that those, which were asleep were a wakened at the same,
and those which were awake, besides themselves: at last a voice like lightning
made a strange rupture, and with Significant Arabian Characters so opened the
thick clouds, and dispelled the vapowres that with a kind of stench, and
suffocating smoke the darkness departed, and the people heard, and the rest read
it to this purpose, O why will ye believe in lies? For when the storm was
appeased, and that the serene ellement presented herself to their veiwe, they
might easily read these words in the firmament. Some two hours after between
to and three in the morning, there appeared a woman all in white compassed with
the beams of the Sun, her countenance was amiable and cheerful, and she
held in her hand a written book: she had no sooner mounted out of the North
west and by West, to her full height and radiance, but round about the East,
and Sowth many armies of Turks, Persians, Arabians, Moors and such like
appeared, rancked as it were with martial discipline, and ready to charge upon
her, but she with an undaunted courage, kept her standing, and used no other
means, but only opened the book, at the sight whereof the whole army fled,
and presently all the lamps about Mahomets tomb were extinguished. For as
soon as ever the apparision or vision vanished, which was commonly an hour
before Sun rising, a pleasant murmuring wind was heard, to whose eruption
they imputed the putting out of the lamps. For you must understand, that
though the windows of the temple, were dooble barrd with iron, and richly
guilt, well glazed and curiously cemented, yet the storm came upon them with
such impetuositie, that neither glass nor iron withstood the violence: the
Temple, itself is very high, made with a rotunde and cube fashion, it has
many galleries, yet none so near in approach, as to discover, how the Tomb is
fastened: only the common opinion is, that it is made of steel, and by cunning
imposture placed in the Center of the Church, under a great Adamant, whose
virtue attracted it to the top, this the lamps show plainly, that there hangs
such a coffin: For 3000. lamps continually, night and day make a most
resplendant show about the galleries, but yet how the coffin is fastened, do
not discover: only my brother and I learnt thus much, that the coffin is
indeed most cunningly mortised into the roof, and has nothing in it, but the
first Alcheron originally writ by Sergius a monck, of the first order that ever
was, which contracted with him; who lived to see the people apprehend, that the
Angels had drawn him to heaven, and kept his monument with their continual
guard about it: The monck indeed buried the body just under the place, and
lived so long, that he saw this position of the religion ratefied, that it was
Capital for any man to dispute of the verity of the story:

The ancient pilgrims I mean Turks of Mahomets race, who after they have
visited this place never cut their hair, were much exanimated, and so
exasperated at this accident, that they wrecked their anger upon the poor
Priest, who, for his plain dealing paid for all.

2. This is the Second thing considerable: For his discourse tended to this
purpose: Ayama Horranda: which is as much as Honorable troop of auditors, who
knows not but the God, that made the heaven and earth by his instrument, our
Prophet Mahomet, has chosen us of all the nations of the world to be his
secret people, and for this purpose raised the great Othoman to expatiate his
power, and enlarge the Turkish Empire: For the world had never but three true
religions, every one of which had three principal Prophets:

First God chose the Jews, and wrought wonders for them in Aegipt, and Canaan
under the conduct of that same Prophet Moises; who prescribed them a law, which
had both blessings and cursings, wherein questionless, if they had held the
beam of integrity up aright, no doubt he would have bin as an inpregnable wall
of brass about them, and terrified their enemies with an hedge of fire; as
they use against beasts in the wilderness: but when neither promises nor
threatenings, blessings nor judgments, prosperity, nor adversity, could keep
these people close to their maker, but they proved obstinate and rebellious,
yea such refractary delinquents, that they denied their God, and committed
Idolatry in despite, and made their sonns go through the fire (an exorbitant
device of the Devil: then God not only gave them over to diverse captiuities,
but at last extirped them and dissipated them over the earth, like chafe
before the wind, so that by lamentable experience we see, they have now
neither King, nor Priest, nor law, nor kingdom, nor government, nor city, nor
any country of their own; notwithstanding God would not be unfurnished of
seruitors, but presently raised a new Prophet who taught the religion of
Christianity, and which is a wonder to relate: For all they crucified this good
man, and condemned him for a deceiuer of the people, neither taken with the
piety of his life, nor apprehending the greatness of his miracles, neither
wondering at his person, nor admitting of his doctrine, yet after he was dead
the very report of a few fisher men, made that impression into the hearts of the
people, that the mightiest Emperors and kings of the world, veiled their bonets
to his very title, and laid their crowns down, to be commanded by his
ministers; But it should seem they grew as corrupt as the Jews, falling into
a maine devision of their Church, with the distinction of East and west:
erecting most grosely Idolatry again, with setting up of images, and a number
of most gewgaw foppish ceremonies, besides corruption of life and personal
falts in many impious breaches of their law, so that God was weary of them to,
and not only sent divisions amongst them, but forsook them in the midst of
their violent race to gormandize and ease, lashing their sides with the whipps
of foreign people, and dispossessing them of their chiefest cities Jerusalem
and Constantinople to the contristation of their hearts, and irrecouerable
vexation of their souls: yet still is God the governor of the world, and
prouides himself of another Prophet and people, raising our great Mahomet, and
giving way to our nation to open the storehouse of his wonders to all the
world, and to hold the victory of many nations the stronger unto us, with an
vnvanquishable arm, so that no doubt we shall thrive with a perpetuity, if we
can serve this God aright, and take warning by the relapse of others, not to
degenerate from the people of God indeed, but observe them with the same faith
and trust, as they are committed unto us. But alas I tremble to speak it, what
have we done, and what have we seen, we have transgressed in every point, and
from a premeditated wilfulness abrogated our first constitutions, so that God
is not only angry, but has manifested it by wonderful signs and tokens,
keeping back our Prophet from us, who as you know prefixed a time to return,
with the full consummation of all happiness to his people, so that full 40.
years are elapsed beyond his limitation, and our account, whereupon this
fearful vision is a prediction of great troubles and alteration:

For either does the opening of the book in the woman's hand portend our
manifest faling away, from the first scope and intent of our law, whereat as
ashamed the whole armed multitude departed, confounded with the guiltiness of
their own consciences: or else it signifies some other book, in which we have
not yet redd, and against which neither force nor policy (as it should seem)
shall prevail. so that to speak with an undaunted confidence of mercy from my
God for telling the truth; I am a fraide our religion will be proved
adulterate, and our Prophet discovered for Collusion, and another brought from
the touchstone of truth, for the purer mettaile, and so this Christ that they
talk of, shall shine as glorious as the sun and set up his name with
everlasting eternity.

Till this, the company were silent, but when they heard him so audatious, they
cried out upon this blasphemy, and taking advantage of their law, which makes
all blasphemy Capital, they presently condemned him by a definitive sentence,
and acquainting the Beglerbeag with all the occurrences, had both his consent
and warrant to put him to death.

3. This is the third remarkable thing, which I proposed, because he died not
the ordinary death amongst them, which is commonly either to tie about his
neck a huge stone or pellet, and so cast him into the sea; or else to strangle
him with a string made of sinues, like our bowstringes, for which executions
certain mutes are always ready, who cast it over his head with a riding knot,
and so two pulling one way, and two another, quickly thrattle him, and many
times with the violence even su^der the wine pipe in twain: but they took him
by the way of torturing, and striping of him gave him first the Corbatch, which
was 100. blows on the soles of his feet, with a flat lever even to the draing
of blood, the poor man still crying out on the woman that opened the book.
Then they took a Bulls pizell, and beat him all over to the cracking of his
sinews, last of all they laid, him upon a wheel, and with an Indian sword
made of sinews half an inch thick, a full yard long, a handful broad, only
it increased toward the point like a fishes tail, brake his bones all to
pieces, the Priest crying to the last gasp O thou woman with the book save me,
and so yielded up his soul, no man knew to whom: nor indeed how to demean
themselves: For the same instant was a fearful tempest, and the Beglerbeag by
the consent of the Muftie dispatched certain of the Spahies to the port of
Sidon, that so they might acquaint the Emperor at Constantinople with all these
occurrences the sooner.

4, The Fourth thing considerable was the explication of this order of
Deruices, who are more significantly called Turners, they are of the lowest
degree and strictest order amongst them, much like our Capuchines, they live in
contemplation, and seem ravished with the apprehension of the joys of
paradise. For they preach nothing but abstinence, and with the Platonist infer
the immortality of the soul: on the day of solemnity, which is our friday,
they meet all together in one quadrant, or if you will some rotunda, which is
gallered round about for the people to be sequestered in the hearing and viewing
their ceremonies, which on this day commonly last three hours: the principal
of these Preests, all the rest sitting cross legd in the quadrant, raises up
himself unto a certain pulpit, before which, such as have been pilgrims at
Mecha with shagg and long hair are seated, and on a desk lie their books,
both of Persian and Arabian character: thus advanced for the better
accommodating his speech to the auditory, he preaches an hour, and ever as he
names the God that gives them bread, a murmuring silence much like our custom
at the name of Jesus, is heard amongst the people with low bending of their
bodies, but not a word spoken. After his discourse certain music begins, and
a song of thanksgiving is distinctly pronounced, which finished, the Priest,
that preached comes into the quadrant amongst the rest, and leads a kind of
measures, with a soft and sober gate; according to the modulent sound of the
music, going faster, and faster, as the music increases, they continuing in
the gesture, of looking up to heaven, and holding up their hands, till they
turn round as fast as they can, which lasts a full quarter of an hour, so
that either by faintness or by custom, they fall down flat upon the ground,
being all in a swet, and so lie groueling, til they have recovered their former
breath and strength, certain officers in the mean while casting ma^tels over
them, least they catch cold: this turning has four divisions, and lasts a
full hour, but time overcomes all things, and so this solemnity receives
her period, only the Priest, that preached, returns back again to his
pulpit, and after another song, blesses the company, who presently depart.
But you must understand, that no man out of the galleries has his shoes on,
nor in any of their Mosques, though they pass but through. Besides, they are
of great account, and some of the fantastiques amongst them, will undertake to
interpret dreams and visions, and as we say, tell fortunes: they commonly
discover the strange gesture of naturals and lunaticks, who are vnmocked,
unhurt amongst the people, and so reverenced with the better sort, that they
verily believe some inspiration and extraordinary infused spirit belongs unto
them.

After the Priests execution, and that the whole country grew tumultuous
through the intricatenes and fearful disputing of this Vision, my brother and
I, to prevent further danger, hasted to Cayro, and in good time, as you saw,
came orderly with the Carauan, only the last night there happened this
disceptation between us: that the opening of the book in the Vision must
needs signify our Bible; to which my hastines inferred, not by way of
contradiction, but by diversity of argument, that then surely we do ill to
shut the book, that the people may not read; which my Augustine brother
plainly told me was schismatic. For the book might be opened to the
Clergy, though not to the Laity: whereupon I replied, then belike the Laity
must know no other, then what we relate unto them: great reason too (said my
brother) the letter is death to ignorant men, and it is sufficient for such as
remain in other callings, to understand no more, then properly belongs to
their salvation: I still opposed, whereby our conference grew to unkindness, and
so rests, till a fitter opportunity for the deciding.

Well said Signior Stephano, agree as well as you can; but to this I agree,
that as I am much amassed at your discourse, so I am resolved, that this
presageth the conversion of the Turks to Christianity; therefore let us haste
home into Italy, and there we shall know what to trust unto, or at least both
secure our selves from the confusions of these Kingdoms, and be able to
furnish our understanding with a better certainty of these ambiguities. I told
them I would accompany them to Alexandria, but I could yet pass no further,
till I had received letters from Florence for my discharge: and so we ordered
our affairs accordingly, and coming with the stream, took the next arm of
the river, which led us to the Port.

But good Signior, one novelty begets another, at our settling our selves, we
found that the day before, there was arrived the Archbishop of Rhodes, confined
into Egypt by the Bashaw, even in a manner upon the like occasion, as the
Deruice Priest was executed about Mecha: yet there was suggested against him
the delivering of certain prisoners, whom they call by the name of slaves;
amongst whom, diverse Knights of Malta so overcame the private regard of
himself, that in mere commiseration and some happy remembrance of the place,
wherein he lived, he adventured his own life for their freedom; all which I
learned out of a discourse of his own, as the Friars brought us into his
presence, and we gave attention unto his gravity and orderly relation of his
business: but before I enter upon the particulars of his discourse, I must
remove certain blocks of contradiction, and make my way clear from
absurdity, and that rough manner of disputing by Questions, according to a
proverb, that a fool may ask a Question, that all the wise men in the world
cannot resolve.

1. First then you must know, that although the Turk have conquered Greece,
and some parts of Hungary, yet he admits the toleration of any religion, so
that they contribute his customs, and acknowledge his superiority, he is
contented to leave them to their own establishments; so that the Greek Church
do publicly maintain their ceremonies, and the Roman Catholics have by
themselves a Church by the name of Francks, even in Constantinople, or if you
will, in the Vines of Pera, or Galata, choose you whether: yea when the covetous
Patriarcke of Constantinople would have farmed his place to the Jews, the
Viceer did not permit the same, but by way of punishment, confinde him to Zio,
from whence with a beliall spirit, he in a monstrous contumacie went to Mosko,
and about the year 1588. resigned that title to the Archbishop there, and for
100000. pieces of gold, invested him with the absolute Primacie of the
Patriarck of the Greek Church: but see the just judgment of God, ere he had
passed quite through Moldauia, certain Ianisaries set upon him, and not only
took away his gold, but bereaved him of his life.

2. Secondly, you must consider, that among the Turks in taking of prisoners,
they have no distinction of persons, but in their ransom accounting all
slaves, and confining them to the Galleys with an ignominious robe, shauing
them, and marking them on some parts of their flesh.

3. Thirdly, that this famous town, and harbor, and Island of Rhodes was
remarkable for two things. 1. First, for a Colossus of brass, which boasted of
great antiquity, and was indeed a man in absolute proportion stradling over
the haven, between whose legs, a ship with full sails, top and top gallant,
might enter, so that when the Turk surprised this place, he laded 1500 Camels
with the rubbish of this one monument, whereby most of his great Ordinance were
cast, which be now in the Tapinare, the office of his Artillery; and whereas
you shall read that S. Paul writ to the Colossians, it was no other then the
inhabitants of Rhodes. 2. Secondly, that after the Knights Templars were
dissolved, there arose a new order to supply that place, called S. John's of
Jerusalem, who when the Turks conquered Siria and Palestina, were of so great
reuenew in Europe, that for many years, they both expulsed the Saracens, and
held wars with these new Mahumetanes: till at last the high decider of
controversies submitted them to alteration, and both their Monastery and their
Palace were pulled in pieces, by those barbarous hands, that neither spared
Jerusalem, nor the wonderment of the world, the Temple of Diana in Ephesus,
falsified by some stories upon Herostratus, who to perpetuate to himself a
name of villainy, set it on fire. 4. Last of all, that howeuer the Alchoran
position, of not disputing of their religion, sealed up as it were the
lauishnes of men's tongues from going at large, yet will they hear strangers in
civil opposition, and even the strictest arguments, that may conculcate and
beat down their new inventions: but this seldom happens, because either they
learning none but the Persian or Syriack language, few men understanding
theirs, can dispute with them.

But now to the Archbishop.

After the Friars had ouerpassed the ceremonies of gratification, and amplified
the discourse of there travel with the circumstances of the vision, the
Archbishop replied: your news has no way got any hand of my admiration. For
it has been long since frequent amongst us, and upon another report of the
troubles in Europe, especially that it rained a whole day blood into Tiber, and
that three sunns were seen in full radiance over the city of Rome, many
Greek preests resorted unto me to Rhodes with an impressed cheerfulness, as
if our Church were already re-established in the first form of the primitive
pattern: nor passed it thus amongst our selves; but the Bashaw sent for me in
all have, and not only demanded my opinion of these things, but made means to
certain doctors of their law to enter into further disputation with me, I told
them plainly, that the original of Mahomet was a mere devise, which they
might easily perceive by the assotiation of Sergius one of our moncks. For if
he had been a Prophet of God, he would questionless never have intermingled
any devises of man: then again for his prefixed time of returning, it was a
thing never heard nor red of, that any one returned from the dead, nor shall
ever rise, till the last dissolution, and therefore how much are you beholding
to that God which you do now worship, that has from heaven discovered unto
you in a vision what you must trust unto in these latter times, and if you be
not stupefied with obstinacy, and remain more stony hearted then ever the Jews
were, that crucified the Savior of the world, now are glad tidings brought
unto you: For the woman, which appeared is questionless the Church of God
compassed about with a Sun, representing the son of righteousness, even
Christ the Savior of mankind, without whom no flesh can come to happiness;
the book in her hand is questionless the scriptures, and the opening of it,
prefigureth the searching and contemplation of the secrets: but whereas so
great an army still fled, as she opened the book, how can any thing be
personated by it, but that both Persians, Moors, and your selves, will be
ashamed and abashed to conceive in what a sottish ignorance and senceless
blindness, you have been so many years detained, therefore embrace the
truth, and return to Christianity, which will bring you into the direct path
of salvation, and in the end the glorious kingdom of heaven. Why replied one
of the Doctors, Jewish Doctors.
how can this be? your prophet was but a man, as ours was, and for inventions
of men your religion exceeds, and far exceedes those fanaticall impositions,
as you term them that ever Mahomet gave us.

But among all as the Jews have often told you, there be three or four such
strange things in your religion, that it is impossible for an honest resolution
to apprehend, that God would be served so foppishly, and childishly: First the
erecting of Images: did God cast away the Jews, and as I have heard, cursed
Ieroboams calves, yea rent the kingdom from your great Solomon, and all
because he gave way to the Idols of his wives, and will you haue^ us be so
entangled again, as to heap up vengeance for so foul an absurdidie on our
own heads? Believe it, it will never be and it is impossible.

2. Secondly your profanation of the Sabbath. Do we or the Jews buy and sell
as you do? labor and travel, eat and gurmandize, gamboll and play, dance,
and sing and commit such abuses on that day, as if all the week were tied into
one bundell, and then set open to flourish her expenses.

3. Thirdly your dispensations with sin and selling of indulgences for money:
O God! is God a receiver of money? or what conceit have you to think, that he
that is all love and mercy, will be corrupted with reward, or brought about
with mercenary bribes?

4. Last of all your sumptuous lives, and excess of vanity, wherein your
Cardinals go beyond greater princes, and shame indeed their profession with
unsanctified superfluity: I name no more because, I know these be un
answerable and not capable of the distinction of personal falts.

With that I replied, although these might be all well excused with
circumstantiall infirmities, and apologicall inferences, that the maine points
of saluations are held amongst them, yet you know, we have opposed Rome in
these things, and not only returned the pride of their supremacy upon their
heads, but discovered their tirannous usurpation of our rights. For
Christianity began in Antioche and the Greeks were the first receivers of the
truth, long before the Latins, therefore believe it without further disputing,
unless we had time to over look Ptolemeis library of 200000. books, both Rome
shall be disrobed, Antichrist discovered, and the river of Tiber flow with
blood, as this the rayning of blood prefigureth, and Mahometh himself proved
an impostor, so that both Jews and Turks do what you can, and say what you
list, shall be taken into our fold, and set down in the accounts of Gods
sheep, and the Christian flock of Christ.

When I had made an end of my speech, I protest I cannot tell; whether I left
them to the extremity of rage or laughter: For they were so far from
approouing my words, that they cried out it was pity such a fellow should
live, and so the Bashaw to show himself a true maintainer of the Othoman
glory, committed me to prison, where I remained, until such time as their came
a new enforcement against me, for hiding out of the way certain knights of
Malta, slaves, and taken by their galleys in a florentine ship as supposed to
join with the pirates, that had proiected the surprising of Scanderon: but the
Bashaw willing to save my life, as much affecting these gray hairs, my former
demeanor, and that outward proportion I carry, shipped me from Rhodes to Alex:
and has confined me an exile to Aegipt, with license to live in Cayro as I
list.

Hence arose a new contention between the Friars and himself, about the Popes
supremacy, and the augmentation of the Clergies power from the donation of
Princes, and the suffrages of general Councels, but the Archbishop quickly cut
them of, and told them plainly, that the Italian Bishop was but an usurper,
and he made no doubt but the raining of blood into Tyber prefigured the
destruction of Rome, and the shining of the Sunns an hereafter manifestation of
greater truth: For fellows, says he, you know, that our John, Patriarch of
Constantinople began these tumors of ambition, against whom your Bishop of
Rome, called the Great Gregory opposed, assuring him that any assumption of
such an universal title was antichristian but what followed: the destruction of
Phocas and Mauritius the Emperors of the East, and the horrible combination of
Bonifacius in the West, which your Bishops can relate, as for your Arrian
faction; what a wonder was shown in the world, when our poor Athanasius for
opposing 700. Bishops, was condemned for an Heretic, had not our blessed
Emperor interdicted the sentence, and saving him, by a vision sent for him to
private conference, wherein the spirit made him so great a workmaster, that he
confirmed the Emperor in his faith, and made that Creed, which is so famous,
for the conversion of Europe: as for your Images, who knows not, that the
Counsels of Nice, and Constance were contradictory about it, and at last a
sentence prevailed for their overthrow, and so could I proceed to the overthrow
of the rest, but that I will have no further wrangling, therefore have you into
Italy and mark but the revolution of times, and what I by way of prediction
have spoken: For on my soul both Jews and Turks shall turn to Christianity,
and Rome your babilonish Rome, shall beset on fire, to the terror of all the
world, that have wished well to the great strumpet, who has made the Kings of
the earth drunk with the cup of her abomination. With this the company divided
themselves. The Archbishop prepared for Cayro: the Friars and the rest for
Florence, and I settled awhile in Alexandria, from whence having so convenient a
messenger I thought it my duty to acquaint you with these occurrences, wherein
if I have somewhat extended the limits of a letter, I crave your pardon and
hope you will conceive, that my good will overcame discretion; and so I commit
my self to your care for my dispach, and in all humility. Bascio le honorate
mani di V. S.

The Translators Epilogue.
WHat I have done, you now both see and read. For it cannot be recalled, nor do
I mean to make any apology, though it be but like a spiders cobweb, fit for
nothing but sweeping away, least I prove like the courtier, that leaped
reasonable well upon the sudden taking him in his boots, but when he thought
to put them of, and make apparent his further dexterity and strength, he came
far short, and thus you shall read of Protogenes pencell, that having made an
arteficiall dog and coming to finish it, with the muzsled hair about his
chaps, he still misliked it, and wiped it away, till at last casting his
pencell from him in a rage, he effected that by chance, which all his art was
defective in: For application I have now done a thing as we say, ex improuiso,
not caring to what use the reader puts it to, so I have my own ends: yet as I
hear, it will be likt, whether I will or no, and is merely a trick of blind
fortune to outface both good endeauours, and true scholership: For let me
never be trusted, if ever so hood-winckt a bayard adventured before on so hard
a style, and durst publish it as a work, either worthy the viewing, or
censuring. The obstinate Papist will storm, and the pedanticall humorist will
swear, if not sweat: the censorious traveler will smile, the nouelist will
buy it, though it were a lie; and he that lives by an Almanac will suppose,
there may be something in it for direction; the young man may affect it, being
himself not solid enough for a Critic; and some old men may be young enough to
entertain it: The free-hearted Gentleman will say, it was well done to
affright idleness with some endeavors; and the man of gravity and learning will
conclude it a devise to get money. To get money; what as this world goes? In
the name of Covetousness, who would care for money? when every man's doors are
open to the hungry belly, every naked soul clothed, every empty purse filled,
nay a man cannot look sadly, but his friend will ask him, what he ayleth; and
if want be the cause, send him a gratuitie the next morning; when our young
Ladies will leave off their tiers, painting, and feathers to bestow it on poor
Scholars, and a man shall no sooner character a book with a Moecenas, but the
Lord will send all over the town to look him out, and not trouble him to
wait upon him: when the money shall be spared, that was wont to be spent upon
Barbers, panders, and whores, and equally divided amongst men of
well-deseruing. In a word, when old acquaintance will stay his Caroch in the
streets to speak to his decayed friend; and when he comes home to negotiate
with him, will send for him up without excuses, though he be in bed with his
Lady. Notwithstanding all this, considering my disastrous improuidence, and
dogged humor to snarle at the baseness of men indeed; I was glad it got money:
For if the worst fall; I shall be able while it last to pay for my dinner, and
prevent the cutting my throat, in expecting to be sent for elsewhere: yet good
Reader, in way of civility, I would it could get you somewhat too; that is, if
you cannot believe it as truth, yet to make that use of it, as if it were true;
and then shall you know, there is but one way to happiness, and all the
praedictions, prophesies, visions, apparitions, Comets, inundations, storms,
tempests, famine, war, alteration, and subversion of Kingdoms, with all the
cabinet of of mysteries, tend to this end, that proemium and poena be the
mastring curbs of the world: that is, that God has a Magazin of judgments to
inflict on the obstinate sinner with punishments; and a storehouse of mercy to
support the penitent soul with comfort.

FINIS.
