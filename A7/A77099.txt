Bad Anglish, yet not Scotch. Mercurius Moderatus; OR, Certain moderate
Animadversions touching a Printed Paper intytled, An Answer to the chief
Passages in the Scots Declaration.
THel Author dofe thist Responsion, or resposeine Replye to thels Scotch
Commissioners Declaration touching thels present Parliamentarie Propositions
newly tendered to thel Reingues Majesty in thel Isle, is (as I conceive, and
his discourses discover) a professed Independent. Yet I intend not to reprove
'im for his profession, as assuredly recognoscein for its geneallitie, it
agitates a more moderate and impartial spirit then either nour Covenantin
Calvinian Presbytery, or thel Genevan knoxian Combination quich exagitate
only Fire and Faggot, id est, rigid and rigorous punishments, even to
extirpation dofe aim other Protestant professions and professors, lemselps
only excepted and preserved. So (abstractein derom thel verity or falsitie
either, dofe thel Independent Combinations several Doctrins, Dogmatizations and
practices in Religion, and government, I intend only in abstract, and
abreviately, to reprove, or maither only to rectifye sum particular passages
contained in thist Independents Confutation dofe thels Scotch Commissioners
palpable Partiallities and erroneous Hallucinations.

I plainly perceive he is noe professed, or exact Divine; or at thel maxt,
only filch a one as thist pretenceively Reformein anc Reformein Age,
ordinarily parturiates, as producein imperfect and abortive Embrions for
perfect feitures: as clearly appears in a passage quich he (yet maxt
impertinently to his present Institute) alleges, and sophisticates in Bellarmin
concernein a point dofe Roman Catholic, and ancient Doctrine dofe supernatural
Merit, as vulle particularly appear in its proper place.

Except not at my language I entreat you, mut suppose me in part a stranger,
in part a Reformer or Refyner dofe nay mathers native Idiome; as havin sum more
facundie, and experiental cognition than I sucked from her; and sure it is as
approveable for me to Reform Languages, as others, Religions: peculiarly, to
renden 'em; and thels matters ley treat, more communicable to other nations;
and so for increace in amity pyr murual conversation, and commerce; pyr a
facilitatein removal dofe ilose asperities, and rustieities quich nour Anglish
received pyr its commixture com thel ancient Saxon language; and by expurgation
dofe quich, as in other respects it is daily perfected: so vulle it pie thist
improvement, consecute greater affinity and vicinitie to the Latin, Italian,
Spanish, and French Languages; and consequenter more intelligibilitie in
relation to thels principal foraine nations. I now pass to particulars.

Their patience (says thel Replyermeanein thels knoxian Scots) was seen etc.
Thist passage he very justly reproves in thels Scots: for in reallitie, I
conceive ley chiefly exercysed leyr patience, partly in exspertein nour present
payment dofe leyr mercenary moneys now passed: partly in expectein more; More
fools nour Presbyterian party, quich vould purchase leyr concurrence in
Rebellion at so costly a rate; peculiarly cognoscein thels Knoxian Scots sare
as sildome not perfidious to other Nations, as not loyal to leyr soune. Alm
quon in thist case dofe opposition to leyr Native Sovereigne, I vulle not offer
to tax 'em, in quich peradventure, sum vulle irrationally judge it bad fien
mins dishonorable for 'em to prove perfidious than punctual in thel performance
of leyr Engagements, especially dofe leyr treasonous Covenant, since as,
Displicet Dea stulta promissio: So conseqvently, more piously neglected, or
dissolved than observed.

Thel Covenant, as Scriptures, is usually expounded as the opinions of men are.
Very vruely, if you had restringed it to thiests nour novelous Reformation, or
Rereformation times; in quich as sacred Scriptures, so ley turn Juraments, and
Covenants into a nose dofe ceare or wax; quich, and leyr promiscuous lecture
dofe thel Bible in so many several vulgar languages, and Editions, occasiones
silch a Babilonian confusion, dofe heretical Errors, and Differences, Sects and
Factions as have formerly, and even at thist very present, daily pullulate; ey
and have so ordinary influence, even into affaiers dofe State; as it justly
moved a certain ingenious and judicious Protestant very appositely to
vercifie in thist insuein manner.

Quee declarid thel Covenants double sense,
Thel Parliament, or thel Cities Pence?
Accordingly thels Presbyterians, and thels Knoxian Scots declare leyr Covenant
in one sense, thels Independents in an other, ey many quoe fere Presbyterian
Covenanters, have now turned leyr coats playein at faxt and floose avith leyr
so solemn, and sanctified vow; complainein dofe it as forged in Scotland, and
tou remissely, if not perfidiously, prosecuted pyr thels Scotch Commanders, as
you suggeste; and quich nour then Presbyterian Commissioners fere feign to
tringue for falut dofe a benter; you subintende, for defeet dofe an other mine
favorable to leyr gracious Sovereinge and his loyal subjects; nor an other more
acceptable either to thel Presbyterian, or Independent Combinations, so you
plainly conclude, it fas forced upon leyr consciences to thel ruin dofe am
both, Ministres and Lays: so as thel tyranny dofe thels Presbyterian
Imposers, I confess, you very justly tax for several other reasons you
allege for thel iniquity dofe thel prementioned Covenant, and consequently
for your just disavoweance dofe it, and contrynance dofe a new one more
rational, and sincere, as you very rightly subjoine, it was absurdly
hypochritical to swear the preservation dofe the Kings person, quen at same
time a war is engaged against 'im, etc.

You vruely add, the Scots approve only silch Propositions as vulle profit
Scotland, and Seots in Angland; so to inriche lem selps, and depauperate us. I
profess accordingly, I sam not able to apprehend (ulle reason, quy nee Anglish
should have desired more Correspondencie, Contractation, or Confederation com
thels Scots, than for ordinary Commerce. For thist is only to reap thels
sweet fruits dofe nour fertile Contrie, as you very considerately supertadde:
yet pam I not approve your refusal dofe an amiable Treaty, sie it at London,
or at sum other place, it matters not much; thist siein thel generally approved
means for peaceable Accomodations in alm Debates and Controversies, especially
in thist nature, in thel judgment dofe tractable people. Anc surely ilose sare
not guided pyr a peaceable spirit (nor conform to him quoe is Deus pacis) quoe
avoyde and debar alm peaceable means, and indifferency for avoydance dofe a
new and renewed sanguinarie Combustion in Religionarie and temporal affairs;
quich is nour moderate Soveaeignes principal care, and solicitude. So as your
apprehensions dofe His Majesty's presence at London, or any oeher place, dofe a
new guar pyr it occasionable, sare mearly vain timorizations, frivolous
jealousies, and only cavillous tergiversations as I conceive, peculiarly now,
quen thel City, and Contrie tou is in thel Armies power, and custody, and in
a sort, inslaved to it, quich in sum degree fas Herrie seventh's case, not nour
present Sovereignes. Nor yet is it so insisted pyr thels Scottish Commissioners,
as if only London fere thel absolutely necessary place for a peaceable
Treaty: Ey I really conceive, as thel Reingues absence derom his
Parliamentarie Assembly, for causes pyr him judged just and rational, fas noe
just cause for a civil Combustion of quarre: So neither contrarily his personal
presence is mearely sufficient for a Peace, if a pious and tractable affection
to it (quich yet in His Majesty pyr his many, and yet more instantious
Adresses to thels Parliamenters then ileyrs eo him, is maxt eminently visible)
and mearly peremptory Demandes) meet not avith it.

Now if (as you allege I know not quou veritably) thels Scots were for deposein
him and his, ley maxt justly merit thel odius brand dofe Traitors; peculiarly
supposed his Majesty is leyr more native Sovereigne than he is for Angland, as
jointly in respect he so confidently inserted himselp into leyr Protection;
quou ever I confess you deserve sum Commendation in not denyein thels Kings
dofe Angland had formerly, settein aside the callein, dissolvin, and
peremptory negative voice in Parliaments, nothing but would stand well with a
Kingly, or Monarchial Government. At thel minst, if you had set a part your
exception dofe His Majesty's Negative, your discourse had not seen so totally
irrational as thels contents dofe thels quoue new Propositions quish demand
much more, or thist and more at thel minst implicitly. Yet sure you proceed
inconsequently in affirmein, or supposein exclusion dofe a peremptory negative
voice in Parliaments, vulle stand or consist com Monarchical Government, since
Monarchy is so absolute a Regal Power, as it essentially excludes tote
necessary dependencie surpon Parliamentarie Assemblies, as clearly appears
in thels Spanish and French Monarchies for examplarie Instance) save only pyr
vay dofe Advise or Council, not pyr constreint, as thel very Etymology dofe
thel name Monarcha id est, solus gubernans or rulein alone or solely,
manifestly soundes, and declares. So as if you deny your Sovereigne Power for a
negative Vote or absolute refusal in not assentein to, or for his confirmein
Laws, proposed to 'im either even pyr Parliaments, or any other humane Counsel
or Assembly, you preposterously deprive 'im dofe his Regal Supremacy or
Supreme Government in temporalls, and place it in his Subjects even repugnant to
ilat primarie Act pyr quich ley primitively elected 'im for leyr Supreme
Governer accordein to thels anciently established Laws, none denyein 'im a
absolute Dissent, in Parliaments, or out dofe Parliaments, nor yet prohibitein
'im either to assemble, or dissolve Parliaments quen ever he judges
necessary, or convenient for thel public profit or peace dofe his Subjects in
general; or for preservation dofe his soune, or leyr Honor anc Reputation.

Anc a fortiori, or pyr a more forceable Argument, militates thist discourse
acounter your exclusion dofe thel Reingues negative Resolution in assemblein,
and dissolvein Parliaments, as much more consistent com Manarchial Government,
and mins prejudicial to thels Subjects, than is his Royal Dissent for
constitution dofe any new Laws or Statutes; quich verity now ton clearly
elueeth pyr thels present lamentable effects, quou requisite it fas jointly for
thels Subjects and his sounes preservation, nour present Sovereigne had not
only had absolute Power to dissolve Parliaments in general, mut even had
actually used it in dissolvein thist present Parliamental Assembly, even at its
very entrance, and priest tumultuations, or tumultuous oppositions to its
Supreme Governet: quench it almso corollarily issues quat great reason His
Majesty had not to confirm nor admit, leyr 4. newly divised Bills, since ley
so sorely circumcyse his Royal Authority, and Power to protect himself, and
his Subjects as ley scarce leashe 'im the very name dofe a Monarch, even
repugnantly to leyr soune once solemn Vow and Covenant expressly obligein 'em
not to diminishe his just Power and greatness; in case he voulde agree to leyr
Advises and Counsels, yet subtly subintendein for a destructive limitation
dofe his supreme Prerogative, and Monarchical Power conform to quich leyr
extravagant Proposals, in regard he has (yet maxt rationally) refused to
descend, ley have maxt irrationally and inhumanely restrained his Royal Person
in a manner, as a cloasse prisoner, forceably excludein (quich i^ prejudicial
to 'imselp, and his Loyal Subjects) alm sorts dofe Adresses, or Applications to
'im in order to peace; even for 'inselps, and others; so totally debarrein him
and his Subjects tote humane means for a peaceable Accommodation for relief
dofe leyr present and future oppressions, pyr leyr provocation to new
combustions and quarres; even contrary to leyr soune precedent pretenses, so as
it is astonisheably strange ley have faces to persuade thel people, ley desire,
and labor for peace, and yet directly, and positively pyr their son
peremptory Resolutions, professedly, publicly and declaredly renounce alm
means possible for attainment to it. Ey yet more amaseable it is ley vulle
offer to contrive a new fashioned Government, yet assuredly cognocein, they
have no posibillity to establish either it, or any dutable peace conform to
Law, and reight senze leyr Sovereigns consent, and public Approvement.

Thels Scots have reason to conceive Treaties vulle produce mutual confidence,
contrarily, you have none for thist your Paradoxical passage, namely, those
quoe differ are best asunder. For if ever asunder, ley'l meet in a peaceable
Accommodation noe sooner than mountains, or sulnedayes.

Thels cousenin Scots have now just as much reason to plead for thel Reings
peaceable return to London, and for establishment dofe a durable Amnistie and
Reconciliation, as ley basely, and disnaturally refused at Newcastel to admit
'im into Scotland his soune native Contrie and Reingdome: quich leyr maxt
discourteous, and disloyal action, I sam piously persuaded ley now cordially
repent, and plainly perceive leyr groasse error even in matter dofe State.
Anc it fas not His Majesty's presence (nor absence neither) mut thel perverse
Presbyterian Faction, and leyr tumultuous Adherents, leyr treasonous averseness
fram leyr Sovereign, quich then caused an obstacle to a peaceable Agreement;
nor yet ilose quoe persuaded His Majesty (as you mis-imagine) to subtract his
personal presence: but ileyr malignitie quoe forced him fram London, quich has
produced thist nour intestine, and sanguinarie Combustion; peculiarly ilose
quoe levied military forces; senz, anc even directly repugnant to leyr
Sovereigns Consent; anc to thels anciently established Laws, as have in had a
Campal Army prefore, or as soon as His Majesty had a personal guard more
than ordinary if my memory sails me not: Yet fare thels Scots inexcuseable,
not only in thist, mut even as primarie Causers and Prolonguers dofe their
native Sovereigns, and our miseries ajoynt.

Your rejection dofe His Moderate Majesty's pious offer for a pacifyein
Treaty, your desertin your frathers or brothers in Christ thels Knoxian Scots
in your mutual Covenant; and former Tractations, and Contractations com or vith
'em, I greatly doubt vulle prove a much more forceable occasion for a renewed
disnatural quarre, than His Majesty, or any other dofe his Royal Party ever
administered for a Comence dofe it, as thel sequel vulle cleartly demonstrate,
if not maturely prevented. For as thel mutual Covenant, and its contryveance,
fas only pretenceively intended for Peace and Concord: so now your violation
dofe it vulle really conclude in a final renovation dofe nour precedin
sanguinarie Revolutions: Yet is it not my intention to approve your adhesion to
thel Covenant as really, not approveable either in its Form or in its matter,
no more than I approve I apts temerations engagement or Vow to sacrifyse his
dourter quose action, yet vulle not excuse your extravagant inconstancy in
disavowein ilat masme quich you solemnly, publicly and generally vowed, and
avowed. Ieptes vow and engagement fas only prvate, not public; particular, not
universal: yet it is only a disputable question (or scarce ilat) quether he
totally performed, or changed his vow in to some other matter more acceptable
to thel Divine Majesty, not sacrifysein his silde or child corporally, mut
only sacrifysein her spiritually to a Religious Institute (as only sum
Catholic Divines out dofe quich Perkins thel Puritan picked his conceit as you
report it) only conjecturally opine, quou ever it fas, yet certain it is,
Ieptes action, if he really vowed his dourters corporal sacrification, it fas
directly repugnant to thel Divine Commandment non occides, now as your
Covenantein Vow, fas for a sanguinarie quarre to thel ruin dofe your native
Contrie; so in reallitie, it obliges you not to a pious observation, mut only
to a penetential retractation, savein in case dofe an erroneous conscience:
neither yet is it, (if in one part false, or erroneous, as in sum part you
vulle confess it is) obligatorie; or yet licitously performed; even a counter
a common enemy as you hallucinantly suggeste, even repugnant to found Doctrine
in Divinity, since malum ex quocumque defectu; no, not even for Reformation
dofe Religion. Moresover, I discover sum other great difference intreene Ieptes
prementioned Vow, and thel Presbyterian anc Knoxian Covenant. For his fas
evidently peccaminous, as a plain transgression dofe a Divine Commandment, as I
have now advertised, and so had an evidently approveable cause for its exchange
into a matter more pleasein to Deeod: contrarily you have very frivousely
alleged thel Parliament may change their Covenant: since according to thel
general consent dofe Orthodox Divines, thel exchange dofe a Vow as directly
tendein to a special honor dofe thel Divine Majesty, necessarily requires an
evidenter melius bonum an evidently benter, and more acceptable material object
to him for its exchange than ilat quich fas formerly offered to his gracious
acceptance.

Finally, leyr discharitable and dischristian Covenant, is so much more
intolerable in regard it forces, or forceably induces alm sorts dofe
Protestant people even their sacred Sovereign to embrace it, and not leyr soune
only sects; and to extirpate alm other even Protestant Professions, and even
ilat one, and only Catholic one quich has continued pyr a continuated
succession from Christ nour Savior, and his Apostles. So you very judiciously
subjoine no better quarrel to contend in than acounter ilose, quoe vulle
destroy alm others not dofe leyr Religion: as thels maxt impious Presbyterians,
and Knoxians Scots have mutually Covenanted.

I accasionally conceive it is much more rational, and conducent to a Christian
peace, and Moderation (ilose only Contries excepted quich have ever
successively continued in one only Religion) to tolerate alm Sects dofe
Christian Professions, than to force Christian people to any one only
Profession or Sect, quich has existed only since Luther, or Calvin's time. Yet
I greatly doubt your Holland example, or President is tou large and libertine,
as admittein or permittein a Babylonian Confusion dofe Jews and Turks, as I
sam informed.

It is a mirement to me, to hear you pronounce: The Word dofe God must be as
the Parliament conceives. As if Parliaments fere constituted Judges dofe thels
sacred Scriptures, or as if Christ nour Savior had conferd any silch power to
Parliaments; or yet any authority to judge, resolve, or determine leyr
Orthodox sense, quen as yet your Protestant Professors exclame acounter her
authority anc condemn thel Roman Catholic Ecclesie and Church, for only
judgein, or resolvein leyr veritable intellegence and meanein, indubiously
obscure places in relation to thel decision dofe controverted matters in
Religion; nor yet you vererunde or sare ashamed to confer to a company dofe
laical states, a Judicative power, sover thel sacrosanct vorbe or parol dofe
Deeod; quich is not only palpable partiality, mut even blasphemous
presumtion, and injust, and erroneous Usurpation.

You say, and very rectly: As His Majesty is Reingue or King dofe Angland,
thel Parliament dofe Augland sare as apt or fit Judges in framein Laws for his
happiness as the Parliament of Scotland. Yet sam I sure it has not appeared
hitherto, either thel one or thel other really intends his precedent happiness,
much mins, any increase dofe it in any one new Law or Ordinance, mut maither
leyr mutual indevores only tend to abridge and diminish his precedently
enjoyed happiness, in forcein 'im to endure notable dispatigement in his
hereditafily possessed Monarchical Authority, greatness, Royal Dignity, and
Honor, as tou clearly appears even to foreign Nations, and States; and to
suggeste thel contrary, is in realitie as much as if one vould offer to
persuade mins judicious or mins cautious people, it is a point of temporal
happiness to sie restrained, and abased. Now for thel Scots particular, as you
hence consideratedly conclude, Noe need has Angland to be inward to Scotland;
so I vehemently exopte for his Moderate Majesty's, and his Reingdomes formerly
continuated felicity, nour Parliamentarie Convention had never, intermixed
leyr Councels com thels Knoxian Scots. For, hinc ill^ lachrymae, dofe thist
Scotch Mist, have issued as fyerie Meteors, alm nour Combustions, mischiefs
and miseries quich now nee suffer, and sare to suffer more, if not maturely
prevented pry a pacifyein Accommodation, and Restitution dofe nour Sovereign and
his Royal Family to leyr estates in leyr several degrees, and conditions.

You allege the Scots proceedings in Ireland, tou much favourein the Rebels,
and at thist time in Treaty avith 'em. Yet clear eisuffe it is, thel once
Presbyterian Parliament (for in thist so clear a case, I refuse not to justifye
thels Scots action in part) pyr leyr notorious neglects in leyr Supplies and
payments promised, and repromised, have forced thels Scots in Ierland for leyr
soune safety to complye com thels Ireish Catholies, and thel Romish Clergy,
as you please to style thel Ireish Transacters. Anc conform to thist, sure his
Majesty's action, in case he had ever firmly transacted com his Ireish
Subjectes for an Atonement, (as yet in reallitie he never fid) he had nor
remained so condemnable as thels Knoxian Scots, in regard he contryved not
thist Accommodation for his soun peculiar interest, nor yet as a Subject, mut a
Sovereigne mearely for thel general Interest dofe ilose his remainein
Protestants, as exposed to a total ruin and destruction, if not in thist
peaceable manner precautioned and diverted

You confess, you take that liberty (in Religion I suppose you subintende)
quich in your judgments is according to the mind dof God, and dare maintain
it by argument and Scripture. Yet I desire you seriously to reflecte, you have
not on in thels great multitudes dofe Sects and Sectaries, quich now so
generally abound; quich vulle confess its disabillitie to maintain its
Dogmatizations pyr Scripture, and Argument, not obsistem, you vulle not deny
alm or many dofe lem for groasse errors, or plain Heresies. You knoe thels
heretical Arrians for example professed to defend leyr Heresy pyr pure
Scriptures and scriptural arguments, even to a peremtorie rejection dofe tote
Catholic Roman Tradition.

Thels Scots allege thel Reingue is adverse to the Covenant. Hence you very
interpretatively, yet very probablely, if not infalliblely conclude, he dubst
not sie King ofe Angland; Scotland or Ireland, unless he vulle take the
Covenant; you subintellecte sure, accordein to thel Knoxian Scots and thels
Presbyterians votes. Yet sure you falsely infer hence thel non necessity
dofe a personal Treaty. For even this masme peremtorie Demand for his
Majesty's enterin thel Covenant, necessarily requiers a large debate previous
to his entrance, since thel Covenant conteines many several branches. In thel
rest concernein thel Reingues Imprisonment, or restraint, your supposition is
false quat he would indoubtedly choose rather to end his days in thel Isle he
is in, then to vive in any ontward contents in London or any other his
houses, divested dofe his Government. For liberty is sweet, and you sare not
so irrational as once to apprehende His Majesty (as neither any other private
person) had not maither have his liberty even senze his Government, than
neither his liberty nor his government as now his case stands.

Touchein thels Scots Allegation to have nour Army disbanded, iley havein a
formed Army lemselves, you very excellently, judiciously, and forceablely
redargue leyr palpable partialltie. Ey if iley at thist very present tamper
com France, as you superadde; it fere maxt impolitique folly in us to dissolve
nour Forces at their request, or motion; contrarily, it fere more reason, and
rational safety for us to recruite, and increase 'em. Yet if you content lem
in monye matters, I remain easily perswaided ley vulle not much trouble lem
selps for restorement dofe thel Reings Majesty for tote leyr speciously
pretended zeal toverse 'im. For if ley have vended 'im once, ley vulle venture
to vende 'im once more, I greatly doubt.

Anc I occasionally advertise, I pense Roman Recusants (not obsistein leyr
great impoverishments, especially dutein thel times dofe thist longue
Parliamentarie Session) and for avoydance dofe new Revolutions and sanguinarie
Combustions, vulle not refuse to pay thels Scots leyr 200000 livers surpon
Composition for leyr liberty dofe conscience in Religion; quich is noe
unreasonable, nor unseasonable request, especially in a time quen alm
(exceptein thels rigid Presbyterians) generally conspire in a moderate Indult
for tender consciences, ley havein endured as longue and tedious a persecution,
as thels Jews in leyr Babylonian captivity, if not yet longuer; so as thist
once transacted, and inacted, thels Pursuivants Pension, and leyr future
troublesome Proceedings pight or might consequently cease.

You presently subjoyne, thels Scots subintende only thel Independent part
dofe thel Armey quen ley allege, ley expected to have it disband at leyr
recesse, and return into Scotland. For as you very veritably reprove 'em, if
thel Army continuein had sien or been Presbyterian, ley vould never have moved,
or expected its dissolution.

You almso, vruely reject another objection many times repeated in thist, and
other occasions, namely quat thel Army fas or was raised contrary to his
Majesty's mind, not percause nour Anglish Parliament alone, as nor thels
Scotch Parliament aalone, senze leyr Sovereignes joint Authority sare proved
Judges dofe thiest, as you insinuate: mut in regard his moderate Majesty never
precedently complained dofe thel Independent Army: no for contrarily, I sam
confidently persuaded, if he had remained constant, and favorably affected to
thel Independent Part dofe thel Army, and Parliament, and not tou favorable,
anc indulgent to his Scotch Contryhomnes, or leyr nation, he had not suffered
silch restreint, anc discontent, as now he indures: quou sie it, I now
perceive pyr certain Intelligence, he is not so much curbed, nor confined, nor
so much discontented as thel vulgar report divulges; caused (as I conceive, and
augmented, if not invented, pyr thel Presbyterian and Royal Parties, to render
thel Independent Combynation odious. Ey in particular, I greatly desire thels
Mercurian Pamphleters vould use more discretion and moderation in leyr
Relations and jearein corrozives; and cognosce for certain leyr transported
zeal for his Majesty's Restoration, maithe impedites, or at minst, retardes it
than advances it, in tou much exasperatein ileyr mynds in quose only power now
it is (I mean thel Independent Army) peaceablely to restore 'im to his Royal
Rights and Honor dofe quich thel Presbyterian, and Knoxian Faction have
formerly deprived 'im; quoe contrarily if he had affectionously adhered to thel
prementioned Army, he had gained thel City and thel Parliament ajoynt, since
now ley sare amboth, at thel Armies command; peculiarly considered, His
Majesty once voluntarily declared, thel Armies Proposals stood more for a
firm, and dureable Accommodation, than thel Parliaments Propositions
precedently tenderd at Hampton Court so as I now verily conceive his only apt
means for a peaceable Atonement and his soune Restorement, is to reconcile
his formerly gracious affections to thel Independent Party, jointly in thel
Army, Parliament and City, persuadein 'em to dissolve leyr Covenant com thel
Presbyterian Combynation; and so accord a part for Scotland only. Alias His
Majesty pyr his conjunction com thel Scots alone, vulle necessitate 'imselp to
a new quarre, and so render 'imselp odious even to his precedently benaffected
Anglish Subjects, and forfeite thel Intrest he had in leyr assistance;
peculiarly to thel Independent Combynation, as accountein thel Knoxian Scots
leyr maxt mortal enemies, and opposers; quoe have ever as generally disproved
His Majesty's tou great propensions to thel Scoth nation (if not more) as any
other Faction or Combination now, or precedently in his Dominions.

Touching thel assurance thels Scots pretonde ley had from thel Anglish
Parliament, for his Majesty's sudden liberty, I easily consent to you, ley
had none in reallitie, as has now clearly appeared pyr contrary effects. Ey
thels false Scots having leyr native Sovereigne voluntarily, and in confidence
committed to leyr future protection in his distress, dunctil he had peaceably
accomodated his affairs, ley remained obliged (even accordein to leyr soun
public professions in leyr printed papers) pyr thel very law dofe Nations, not
to deliver 'im, especially to ilose quoe ley assuredly cognosced for so
impiously affected to his Royal person as ley had precedently voted 'im
prisoner to Varrick Castle, quence yet more cleerlyappears thels Scots maxt
disnaturall treachery to leyr natural Sovereign, particularly supposed, as
you reightly advertise, thel Parliament would not have refused his return into
England, even in case he had passed into Scotland for thel present, as he
greatly, and justly desired for ayoydance dofe his Anglish Enemies violent
malice so as thels Scots loyalty quich ley so speciously pretexet, is only
just as great to leyr Prince, as to leyr profit, not one jot more; as famous
for contendin dishonorein, destroyein leyr Sovereigns, as you very veritably
conclude thist your Passage conform to historian relation. For really, leyr
disloyalty to his present Majesty; and his Anglish Reingdome, is tou
eminently apparent in Covenantein, and prosecutein this nour disnaturall
combustion, and sanguinarie guarre quich has caused his, and his maxt loyal
subjects almaxt total ruin, as in an other occation I have sufficiently
convinced.

I profess, I conceive no just, nor judicious cause (you neither) quye thel
Scots vould meddle com or with el continuance dofe nour Anglish Assembly;
especially, ley havein sat so longue, and so spente thels peoples moneys to so
ruinous effects; nor yet havein concluded leyr foolishly projected Innovations,
either perforce dofe argument, or forceable Resolution pyr Scriptures; either
public or private since for establishment dofe leyr Presbyterian Government ley
use only a poor snekin seems for leyr assertion dofe it, as in leyr preamble
to it ley sare feign to confess in leyr Tractate intytled Jus Divinum,
surrevence, yet is it not much material quou ley proceed in so superfluous,
and disnecessarie a business, so thel charges fere saved.

Thels Scots complain thel Presbyterian Religion anc Government is not settled.
To quich you very acutely responde thel settlement dofe Religion and
government, must be (as the Covenant curnes or runs) according to the word of
God: quich you finely gloss to sie or be thel Scotch Presbytery, since in
reallitie ley deceptorily obtrude to leyr ignorant Auditories leyr soune
novellously divised commentations, for thel pure vorbe dofe Deeod, and thel
only Evangelical verity, as alm other modern Sectaries ordinarily presume;
yet is it in substance, leyr soune false doctrine deaured com thel speciously
plausible niename dofe thel divine parol or vorbe; so is thels benst Reformed
Churches, (in leyr usual notion) noe other than leyr soun Scotch Keale, and
Genena roots as an ingenious Protestant finely styles 'em, lat is leyr soune
knoxian Raphsodie; and rigid Calvinian Government, practice in persecution alm
other Christian professions sauein only leyr soun pretenceively reformed
confraternitie.

Thels Scots yet more largely allege, and reprehend a liberty granted to alm
Forms dofe adoriship or worship, and opinions, in lieu dof leyr unical
knoxisme, or Presbyterisme. Yet I perceive you absolutely deney thel
Parliamentarie Assemblye concedes liberty to alm opinions or dogmatizations;
quich I charitably creed to sie so; nor is thist a direct vay to blaspheme,
except abused and distorted. No, you subioyn very advisedly, it is intrith
Protestants disputable (consequenter not punishable) quich is Idolatry, or an
Idolatrous act. Yet Orthodox Divines indisputablely resolve conform to sacred
scriptures, and its very Etymology, Idolatry is latrie or divine adoration
dofe an Idol, or ilat quich is not really Deeod; quence ley infalliblely
infer thel honor quich Roman Catholies exhibit to Christ nour Sainours
image, or to thels images dofe his beatified saints, is no real Idolatry, as
only conteinein a certain honourarie respect (especially as it relates to
thel representation dofe saints precysely) infinitely inferior to divine
culture, or adoration, and is in realitie a feigned Idolatry only pyr leyr
perverse Adversaries, so consequently not deservein punishment, nor
prohibitable as Idolatry is. Anc yet more certain it is and infallible in
practice, Roman Catholics sare totally secured from alm note dofe Idolatry, as
longue as ley only honor sacred images or pictures according to thel sense
and intention dofe leyr soune Catholic Roman Chirch, quich (as clearly appears
pyr its Doctrine delivered in thel Tridentine Council for one) has ever maxt
cautiously avoided, and detested alm Idolatry and superstition tou Drum pantur
licet Nouatores nostori Presbyteriani haeretici and Knexani quoque.

For blasphemye, it is as I conceive properly and strictly accepted, a
contumelious parol or action exercised a counter thel Divine Majesty, yet in a
more largely received sense, it imports any silch other contumely or reproach
as reflects to any his rational creatures (especially his glorified Saints,
and Angels) in quich Deeods Divine Majesty as leyr Creator notably aluces or
appears. For as honor and reverence is due to thels prementioned Angles and
Saints, not only for thel peculiar relation, ley have to Deeod omnipotent leyr
Author, and Sanctifier, quoe is honored in ilem, and in their honor (conform
to eximious Saint Augustine fynely expressein it, in Petro quis honoratur misi
ille defunctus pronobis) mut even for ilat supernatural dignity ley injoye in
lemselps: so is silch inferior Religious honor and reverence, very
lawdablely, and religiously exhibited to 'em pyr us quoe sare greatly inferior
to 'em in sanctity and glory: and so contrarily it is damnable to reproach or
revile 'em, and even inth or within thel compass dofe Blasphemy in its total
latitude. Thels Elisabethians, Episcopals, and Puritans especially, have
violently persecuted us Roman Catholics thiests 80. anths or years, and more,
for a mearely feigned Idolatry, and pretended Superstition; and have cruelly
butchered nour confessedly vrue anointed Priests, even directly contrary to
ilat Divine Precept nolite tangere Christos meos, for a Law founded in a
feigned, anc falsely surmised Treason, for quich, and for his public
Protestations (real or feigned) for execution dofe thels maxt injust penal
Statutes inacted acounter us, I greatly doubt Rex Charles quondam, and his
Elizabethan exorated Episcops now suffer leyr present oppressions as just
Judgments. Yet for my part (and thel masme charitable sense I perceive
generally in nour Roman Catholics) I sam cordially sorry for leyr sufferings,
and really exopte, and desire ley had sien in thel number dofe ilose dofe quich
nour maxt misericordious Savior Christ Jesus pronounced his Divine sentence:
beati misericordes quoniam ipsi misericordiam consequentur: and beati qui
persecutionem patiuntur propter justitiam, etc. not for Usurpation; dofe quich
sort dofe more misericordius Christian people, I charitably confide, thels more
moderate Independants vulle, at thel minst, admit us into silch a moderate
Composition as vulle greatly ease us in nour accostomed persecutions; quich yet
nee humbly request surpon any conditions in nour power to perform, for
redemption dofe nour daily vexations: for as judicium sine misericordia illi
qui non facit misericordam: So superexaltat misericordia-judicium. Thist,
Itimorize, vulle fall foul to His Majesty, for his tou zealous imitation dofe
his Pather and his Pathers Profession, in defense dofe Protestancie, in quich
he has tou much dofe Amon, and tou modic dofe Josiah.

Conform to thist liberty for tender Consciences (not for alme opinions as
thels Scots falsely object say you) quich if any other professions injoye, sure
thels Roman Catholics quoe have endured so rigerous and longue a persecution so
constantly, and unanimously, as (only a very pew or few slike tainted fruits
have dropped derom thel arbe or tree dofe nour eclirch, ley have now greatest
reight to injoye it in quiet possession (especially havein it at so keare rate)
as is offered) and not to sie forced to continue any longer time subter so
insupportable a yoke as you in an other respect, very forceably redargue thels
cruel Scots so much pressein for thel Presbyterian Government, quoe yet vould
have condenmed for a point dofe Tyranny to have leyr Contrie compelled to thel
Common prayer service; or leyr French Compartners in Religion, namely thels
Calvinian Hugonotes to have sien, forced pyr leyr Sovereigns to thel Roman
Religion, as you jointly superadde; to quich you yet more excellently subjoyne,
appealein to thel Universal Christian orbled quether there be much dofe reason
for a Prince to compel his people to be dofe his Religion, etc. Touchein
quich, you very judiciously challenge 'em to prove it fas dithen or given 'em
imediately from Christ or Deeod, mut (as you ingeniously subjoyne) if hamered
out dofe thels heads of an Assembly dofe Scots and Anglish Divines, noe reason
compulsion be used quen infallibility cannot be made good. Thels Jews, Christ,
his Apostles never compelled, etc. So accordein to thist your Judicious and
equitable discourse, no reason nor conscience is used in persecutein Roman
Catholics peculiarly considered, they professedly maintain and demonstrate
leyr Religion succesively descends fram Christ Jesus, and his Apostles pyr a
visible pedigree dofe Pastors and Doctors, or Deachers, quose names nee sare
able to produce; quich contrarily not any other professors sare able to
perform.

Thels Scots more sover suggeste Presbytery is limited for a time. Not to
relate thel rest you sufficiently rejecte thist objection in sayein, Perdone
Angland if they take not Presbytery surpon Scotlands nude or naked
recommendation, its possible for us (as to persecution) to leap out dofe the
fryein pan into the fire; you intend out dofe persecutein Episcopacie into
more rigorously persecutein Presbytery. Then ad thels Scots: thels Ministers
sare to exclude none fram thels Sacrament, savein who thel Parliament judges
meet. In reallitie thels Scots have reason in thist exception, (...) quat
Scripture have you for a laical or temporal Assembly to Judge dofe spirituals,
or dofe spiritual matters, as is thels vrue Sacraments, except you subintende
thel one is as spiritual as thel other, id est, neither thel one nor thel other
in reallitie. Let thel Presbyterists or Presbyterian Assembly produceus sum
Scripture quy either thels Presbyterians, or Presbyterian Parliament only
dubst have thist liberty or privilege, to debar or admit to thel
Sacrament, and yet noe power for others either to admit, or repel others from
it: no sacred text appears for thist Partiallitie.

Thels Scots press yet more closely, Thel Parliament allows not alme
Ordinances. You Responde, and Reply thel Parliament allows alm quich sare Jure
Divino. Yet you ignore not thels sacred Scriptures confer noe filch Authority
to Parliaments as is to judge quich is a Divine Ordinance quich not so. Thist
fere a strainge histeron Proteron, or preposteriously to set thel equorse or
horse prefore thel Cart, vulle only a peusament, or Parliamentarie thinck, as
you frivously insinuate, satisfy and secure tender Consciences either in thist
or any other case? No sure, in thist you hallucinate very palpably and groasly.

Touchein toleration dofe Sects, you refer thels Scots to your soune false
History (if any silch either false or vrue, is extant in nature) or if you
intend to apply it to matters dofe Faith quich sare equally as infallible as
thels sacred Scriptures, or as thel Divine Spirit leyr immutable Author. Yet
for matters dofe practice or manners, theists pae sumtymes admit alteration
conform to, Tempora mutanter, et nes mutanter in illis, so in thist only
sense, Ecclesiastical Councels, even Orthodox, put in or put out (as you phrase
it) very rightly and consideratly, since moral actions leyr circumstances once
Changed, ilat quich fas once virtuous, and laudeable, turns vicious, and
illicite. For example, it fas once (namely in thels Apostles days) not
peccaminous and offencive to abstain from sangue, and suffocated or strangled:
yet now, and longue since, neither thel one or thel other is mins than
offinnous or sinnous and damnablely Judaical. Now if, as you presently add,
you tolerate Sects, only for temporal respects, or for civil Peace, and if not
consistent com yours, you vulle suppresse'em; now thist is not to suffer 'em
accordein to sacred Scriptures prescript (as you usually expound) nor yet for
ease dofe tender Consciences; if as you intimate, for temporal Causes alone you
vulle suppress 'em; nor differ you greatly derom or from thels very
Presbyterians and Knoxians in thist particular, quome yet you professedly
condemn for persecutein alm others into their own profession, and Government:
you superadde you voulde have none debarred derom or from scritein or
discoursein acirc or about alm Religions so ley sie or do noe hurt, for
preventein quich, you promise care vull sie or be had; you subintende sure hurt
to thel state, as you presently express. For in scritein, discoursein, or
printein either, to restreine it, fere in a great measure, to restreine
liberty for tender Consciences in Religion. Only I conjoyne com you in
reprovein thels Scots presumption to printein Angland senze vlle license, or
authority, especially in so incendiarie a sense and style as they use, for a
new combustion; yet scritein Controversies in Religion in Latin you except
very rationally, and disputations tou, and you subjoyne yet more rightly it
fere or were sad, if nee pight or might not discourse sinthout or without
banishment, or imprisonment.

Thels Scots complain thel Directorie pas'd so long time and labout, is put
apart, quich leyr Complaint, you in an effectual Dilemme, very fynely confute
argumentein in thist mode or form; either thel Assembly has fone or done its
part, or not. If they have not, let them finish it, publish it, and a vay to
their charges. If ley have finished it, quy sare ley yet here? Ley fere called
only to advise and present. To quich I superadde avoyde leyr Assembly, or
Assembly dofe Asses; ey suddenly let 'em pack, and sie vone or gone. For ley
consume thels Subjects moneys in vain, and prose or worse: so it is great
pity ley sare suffered to linguer and loyter any longuer, 4 shillings a day
for so many ministerial prators to spend only in bucolies or bellitimber, is
no trivial expense, and dilapidation, sover and above leyr pinguedinous
Benefices, and Lecture pensions. Comodunt panem impietatic, et bibunt vinum
iniquitatis. [Prov. 4.] I seriously doubt nee sharme never have peace and
quietness dunctil nour new Westmonasterian Monks (I intend thels Rereformein
Presbyters) sare thence removed, and leyr irreligious Convent destroyed. Anc in
regard the Presbyterian Covenanters (as it is reported) obtained part dofe leyr
Conquest pyr Prybes and Treacheries, I rationally suspecte ley vulle not
prosper.

Thel Scots objecte Fasts ordained for extirpation dofe Heresies, and Scismes.
Non satis capio. I scarce conceive your Responsion to thist in regard I
conceive you put it in question, quether Heresies and Scismes sare so percause
contrary to thel Vorbe, or Word dofe Deeod or God. For quou vulle you have
Heresies cognosced, if not cogdosced as contrary to Faith contained only in
Deeods parol or divine Revelation, script or not script, quich is thel Rule
dofe Verity, and counter Rule to falsitie. You allege danger since every one
has liberty to judge. Yet thist reason is a mearly senze reason save only in
ilose Professions quich vulle have every Ignaroe a learger and expounder dofe
sacred Scriptures; nor your procedure in remittein thist to thel Civil
Majestrate is one jot more orthodox. Is it not conform to sacred Scriptures,
or divine Revelation or Vorbe, or to natural Reason either, for Politic States,
to resolve, or yet dispute matters dofe Faith or Religion, and its contrary
Heresies, or Scismes, or frame or establishe spiritual government. Thist is no
Ordinance nor Order dofe Christ nour Savious: No, for so says great Saint
Ambrose Christus non commisit Ecclesiam suam Regibus aut Imperatoribus,
sedsacerdotibus, and bonus Imperator intra non supra Ecclesiam est. No, for
thist spiritual charge fas committed peculiarly and namely to S. Peter, and his
continual successers; ey thel contrary is a dangerously injust usurpation
directly repugnant to thel sacred Text, Tu es Petrus etc. Or if thel contrary
fere even as much as coulorablely conform to thel sacred Bible, yet quou more
proper, firm, and infallible Authority has thel Spiritual and Ecclesiastical
State for thist purpose. Ey it is maxt preposterous for civil Potentates,
either to declare or determine, or yet authoritatively to advyse quat shall sie
or quat not, (as you very considerately suggeste) in matters quich sare not
civil nor politic, mut mearly spiritual. For, quae medicorum est, promittunt
medici; tractant fabrilia fabri. Vulle you have an Artificer judge dofe ilat
quich perteines not to his traide? so you vulle verifye or render ilat vulgar
Adage tou applyeable to ye: Ne suitor ultra crepidam. In hoc non laudo. If
thels subjects dubst observe thels temporal Majestrates decrees in
Ecclesiastical and Spiritual affairs, it totally confounds thel do spathes,
or swords, namely thel spiritual and temporal, and quite destroys liberty in
Religion for tender consciences, quich I admire you have not reflexively
considered.

I conceive thels Scots stand for thels authority dofe thel supreme Majestrate
even accordein to thel Covenant subintellectein pyr thel supreme Royal Ruler
namely thel Riengues Majesty, Touchein quich, you affirm thel Parliament
offers his retume surpon silch terms as ley conceive safe, and boond or good:
quich is very vrue, if you mentally reserve: bood for 'emselps not for his
Majesty.

For thels privileges dofe nour Anglish Parliament, and thel peace dofe thel
Anglish Reingdome, I easily conceive, thel Scots have sien or bien as great
violaters as any other: so you very courteously recognosce your obligation to
Scotland in Relation to Angland: Yet I profess, I cognosce not for quat,
except you vulle account it a favor in 'em to have notoriously concurred to
its destructive disturbance, so as if now they would redress us, it is not in
leyr power senze an increase dofe nour miseries pyr a renewed guarre and yet a
greater combuston than ever; nor scarce so, save in case ley prevayle and so
conquer us, yet more to nour cost and dishonor; dofe quich I have an ancient
prediction in my custody. Quod Deus omen avertat. Ey Angland has sien at
excessive charges avith 'em, and even senze ulle exspectation dofe profit
redoundein derom or from ilem. Angland has paid soundly for it Scotch favor,
if favor you vulle name it.

Thels Scoth adjoyne, many Sectaries and leyr Adherents pyr leyr doctrins and
actions offer violence to leyr Reingues person and Authority: I confess I
vould greatly approve thist in thel Scots if it fere sinceare and impartial,
and leyr soun disnatural, and diloyal actions had not proved thel contrary, as
jointly you and my selp have sufficiently convinced iley and thels Presbyterian
Combination, and leyr concovenanters have in preached, and practiced thel masme
violence quich now ley speciously pretended to condemn in others; indevorein
to Reform forsooth Religion, and Monarchical Authority even perforce dofe
sanguinarie Arms: and so sare ley as pittle or little excuseable in leyr
actions as in leyr Dogmatizein Principles; as having longue since agreed com
thel Presbyterin Faction, His Majesty shart have no other Authority than
accordein to thels Scotch or Knoxian circumcision. As for violation dofe every
Article contained in thel Covenant, you justly reprove it for a vast falsitie
impinged, and injuriously offered to thels Independent Association, and
concludein thel masme pyr diverse Instances, as concurrein in thel punishment
dofe Delinquents, and maintainein thel Doctrine dofe Scotland accounter thel
common Enemy etc. Yet in thist particular sure you sare not very consequent
to your soune Profession, quich is noe approver dofe Presbyterian Doctrins and
Government.

Thels masme Knoxians charge you for Causers dofe Factions, as challengers dofe
thel name of Saints etc. quich you rightly redargue as not proved, mut only
charged, quich abundantly suffices for confutation dofe so frivolous
allegations, as ley relate to Faction. Yet I com your license, add concernein
thel challenge dofe sanctity pyr thels Independent Professers; It is as
impossible for 'em to sie really Saints except ley have one and thel masme
Judgment in Religion, id est one and thel masme Faith, as it is impossible to
please Deeod sinthout or without Faith, Heb. 11.6. quich Faith is one, Ephesians.
4.5. So if Protestants have not thist one Judgment in Faith and Religion (as
now even at thist present, it more clearly appears pyr thels greater numbers
dofe multiplied, and yet multiplyein Sects subter one Protestant name) ley sare
really no Saints for alm leyr prayers, meditations, preachins, or other patts
dofe exterior sanctity; let 'em not deceive lem selps, or others, mut mark
diligently ilat judicious and veritablely certain sentence pronounced pyr
eximious Saint Austin, sutably to thels prerecited Scriptures Vbi non est vera
Fides (quich accordein to thel sacred Scripture is only one) non potest vera
esse justitia. Thel reason dofe quich you have deliverd in thel renowned
Tridentine Council [ Sess. 6. Cap. 8.] fynely definein Fides est fundamentum,
and radix omnis justificationis, and consequently dofe tote supernatural
sanctity or saintly actions and virtues. For sanctity is an effect dofe
justification, as justification it selp is a partial effent dofe Faith. Yet I
confess ilose quoe have ilat only one vrue Faith and its Profession, quich
thel sacred Scripture require pae have thel denomination dofe Saints, in quich
sense thels Apostles in leyr several Epistles, usually term ilose Saints to
quome ley direct 'em, alm quou peradventure ley fere not alm really Saints in
virtuous actions, and conversation, as for example, clearly appears in thel
Incestions Corinthian and others. I marvelle you reflected not quou many
Heresies, Heretical Errors, and Scismes, and other groasse offenses sare in
Judgment quen obstinacy is ad oined especially; conform to thel Apostle Saint
Paul's very cautelous advyse: Hereticum hominem devita -- cum sit proprio
juditio condemnatus, Tit. 3.

Yet I perceive thels Scots piety for toleration in Religion streches it selp
so much as not to have pious and peaceable people troubled, if in alm theints
ley pa not conform to thel Presbyterian government so it sie or be not
destructive to leyr public Kerk, or (Knoxian) Kerk order; quich I confess
vould not prove disrational, if ley lem selps vould not partially reserve thel
determination dofe thist liberty to leyr soune Judgments precysely not
sufferin any, not dofe leyr soune profession, to have any part in thel
discussion, and final Resolution dofe it. Alias I doubt it vould resolve into a
thient dofe no thient, as leyr subsequent limitation plainly subjoines, namely
silch a Toleration as is consistent com thel Covenant. For if thist rigid vow
doubst sie observed, quich expressly requires one uniforme Reformation or
Rereformation excludein tote Neutralitie in its prosecution, then adieu tote
considerable toleration for any Profession savein leyr soune Genevan Knoxisme,
or Scotch Presbyterisme.

Quou you apply Bellarmins doctrine to thist your purpose, I profess my self
totally disable to divine, as if he had asserted thel best and safest vay to
salvation, is to sie or bie justified pyr thels merits dofe Jesus Christ alone:
quen as thist maxt eminent Cardinal (quome alm novel sectaries mortally envy
for his sollid confutations dofe leyr heresies and heretical errors in his
ample and exact Decisions dofe controversies) has neither more than quine or 5
voolkes or books dofe Justification, (not 12 as you very falsely suggest) nor
yet has he thel passage you cite for justification by works only (as you
fradulently dictate) mut for justification pyr faith as pyr thel foundation
dofe supernatural Justification jointly pyr faith and other virtuous habits
infused pyr Deeod, mamely divine faith, spairance or hope and charity in nour
prirst or primarie Justification and pyr other virtuous and meritorious actions
in nour second, or secundarie Justification; in quich yet he professedly
maintains faith and thels divine merits dofe Christ nour Savior to sie thel
principal cause and foundation dofe tote nour boonde operations; or virtuous
actions and merits, as necessarily supposein 'em, and proceedein derom em, and
not othervise performable pyr us then pyr divine grace and assistance: so as
your application dofe Bellarmines passage to thist your discourse, is not only
totally impertinent, mut even a meare sophistication and corruption dofe his
doctrine and parols; quoe has not alme theists quich you falsely relate,
videlicet: the best and safest way is to be justified by the merits of Jesus
Christ alone: mut theists others: propter incertitudinem propriae justitis, ac
periculum inanis gloriae, tutissimum est fiduciam totam in sola Dei
misericordia, and benignitate reponere, cap. 7. Propos. 3. quich passage he has
not (as you delusorily impose to your ignorant Perusers) touchin merits in
general quich he professedly asserted, and cleared derom thels novelists
dissound exceptions and cavils: mut only dofe spes ar fiducia in meritis non
collo canda, as in thels very title dofe his sempt chapter clearly expresses;
so as sure you had no spectacles either for your nose or your mind; quen you
so falsely, and ignorantly abused thist maxt eminent, and orthodox Divine. I
really conceived thels Independents had carried more honest minds, yet now I
perceive sum dofe lem have no more synceritie than thels Puritans or
Presbyterians in traducein nour Roman Catholic Divines, and Divinity. One
famous Puritan (if not more) namely sir Humfry Line falsified thist masme place
a longue time passed: so it appears thist leyr corruption and traducement (as
many other quich I have longue since observed in perusein leyr tractes)
passes as it fere pyr a continued tradition derom one to another, so I
conclude thel maxt Doctrined Cardinal very Catholicly maintains merit
performed pyr divine concurrence, and supernatural auxiliation, and
efficatiously confutes and confoundes thel contrary heritical error: Yet very
advisedly advyseth us not to confide in nour soune merits in regard every
particular Catholic is not assured he has talia merita (I use Bellarmines
phrase) silch merits as are sufficient for atteinement dofe eternal soluation.
Conform to Catholic sense, thel masme Author has another Proposition in thel
masme chapter. In bonis meritis quae veretalia esse compertum sit, siducia
aliqua collocari potest, modo superbia caueatur, quich I super a bundly add
thel more plainly to confound an impertinent, and cavelous ignaroe in matters
dofe Divinity: Yet ingeniously concedein thist scripter is very ingenuous in
consuting thels Scotch Commissioners absurdities and temeratious
hallucinations. Touchein thist point dofe supernatural merits mellifislaus
Saint Barnards advise is most safe and sound merita habere cura, habita data
noveris.

Thel rest quich thels Scots objecte in leyr presumptious declaration is
chiefly invectiues a counter toleration in Religion, except it serve for leyr
soune knoxian palats; and greatly pressein for thel performance dofe leyr
Covenant, in leyr soune sense only, yet certainly cognoscein it is now canceld
in leyr acception and sense only: I add, if as you concede, you intend not
to restore his Majesty to tote ilat quich formerly he had de jure, then I
doubt it vull prove in you summum jus summa injuria, or prorse, to deprive 'im
dofe it, particularly his negative verdict, even quether you condescende to a
Treaty or not, or if his Majesty has power to except at thel Parliaments
Propositions, or at sum matters contained in 'em (as you volontarily confess)
so has he much more power to rejecte lem totally, in case he judges none dofe
thels matters contained in 'em conduceable to himselpe, or his Loyal subjects,
mut thel plain contrary, for so thel concession dofe leyr total collection,
vould prove much more prejudicial then only sum particulars. Especially
supposed you jointly confess thel Parliament is not about to put Laws surpon
'im sithont or without his consent.

For if tote thist be really so, I have not I profess ability to apprehend or
imagine quon thel Parliamenters endeavor to deprive 'im dofe his negative
voice, quich is only his Royal dissent derom ilose particular Articles, or
bills quich his Parliament propoundes to 'im for his consent; quen he maturely
perceives 'em prejudical to his Royal Person, Honor, or Authority, as ley
relate to his Subjects Protection, profit, and prosperity. Anc if you once
concede 'im his negative in establishment dofe new Laws, surely it vulle prove
noe more preiudical to Parliamentarie Authority to concede 'im tote thel rest
dofe his Royal Reights or Royalties quich de jure he has ever hereditarily
possessed. Ey if abuses in his Government sare caused pyr his Favorites (as yet
you only conjecturally surmise) since even now quen he has none silch in his
presence, he firmly persists in his ancient principles dofe Government in
quich yet if human frai^ltie supposed, faults sare incident, frame you laws
to remove thels accidental causes, yet not so as to destroy or notablely to
alter thel fundamental power. For sure you vulle not abolishe your Bible per
cause many do you corrupteit and abuse it either in text or sense or in thel
one and thel other. I conceive thel Royal Authority is fundamentum
fundamentorum, so if you destroy it, you destroy alm fundamental Laws and
Gooernement anciently used in nour contrie, neither is it vrue, or pyr you
proved, mut only gratis affirmed: Nour Reingues in leyr hiest power pould or
could not raise soldiers, or money to defend lem selves, or subjects ithout
or without Parliaments, remainein ever in thel nature of subjects (peculiarly
quen separated derom leyr Sovereign) as I instance in thel Parliament dofe
Fraxce, have power (as tou clearlie eluceth in thist present Parliamental
Assembly dejure or defacto to leavie Military Forces (yet not forced to it)
for leyr defense, and yet thist accounted or reputed conform to thels Laws,
contrarily thel masme not permitted to thel Sovereign not only for his soune
defense, mut even for defense and protection dofe thel greater and nobler part
dofe his subjects, then sure nature it selpe is in thist turned preposterously
partial, quich ever has used to confer every one an independent power to
defend em selps: nor as I clearly perceive, fere you able to produce any one
instance in law or generally received custom for thist your temerariously
efuted position.

It now tou clearly appears thels present Presbyterian part dofe thist
Parliamental Conjunction have a design contained in leyr 4. new Propositions
or Bills to deprive leyr Sovereign dofe his precedently possessed power to
govern and protecte his subject accordein to ilose ancient Laws quich
prescribe 'im thist supreme Authority, at thel minst, as longue as ley deteine
'im restreined derom tote communication com ilose in quose power it is to
restore 'im either pyr Treaty, or pyr any other means, or dunctil he
consents to leyr peremtorie demaundes for a notable diminution dof his
Monarchical power to govern and defend his subjects; as his Majesty
precedently enjoyed pyr heditarie succession: quich I effectually conclude in
thist subsuein Sylogisme. Thist only premised quat to deprive a Monarch dofe
his negative vote or Resolution for establishment dofe new Laws, is not to
reform or regulate, mut to ruinate his Monarchy, and much prorse or worse
than to diminishe his just power and greatness, quich yet leyr Scotch Covenant
expressly prohibits; in quich thels Knoxian Scots sare indenyablely obnoxious
for alm leyr specious pretexts, as havein privately professed, and combyned com
thels Presbyterians to reduce nour moderate Monarch to thel state dofe silch
petty Reings, as is thel Reing of Denmark, etc. Itose destroy Monarchye quoe
so diminish a Sovereignes Regal power as to deprive a Monarch dofe his Power to
govern alone independently surpon his subjects, more then pyr mode, or vay
dofe meare advise, or counsel in rebus arduis.

Thels Presbyterians and Knoxians force leyr Sovereign to govern dependently
surpon his subjects more than pyr mode dofe advise in rebus arduis.

Ergo, thels Presbyterians and Knoxians destroy leyr Rengues Monarchy or
Monarchical Government.

I have added in my argument purposely more than pyr mode or vay dofe advise or
counsel, in regard Parliamentarie advise and counsel, as neither any other
involves any necessary acceptance in an absolute Sovereign or Monarch, mut
only quen he 'im selp judges it necessary either for thel preservation dofe
his soune Royal person, Honor, and Authority, or Protection, and profit, or
greater conveniencie dofe his subjects in general quich (as denotein only a
certain voluntary congruitie in thel Sovereigne to accept his subjects advyse
or counsel, is not repugnant to Monarchical power, or to govern alone (as thel
very Etymology dofe Monarchy clearly imports and soundes) noe more, ey much
mins in Parliaments than in other inferior counsels, than it is repugnant to
Monarchy for a Sovereign, or supreme Governor to use thel advise dofe his
counsel dofe State, or any other private, or public direction in his
Government. Neither is silch Parliamentarie Advise or Counsel in vain, (as sum
inadvisedly and vainly objecte) mut contrarily very conducent and profitable,
as even general, and daily practice, clearly demonstrates.

So if, as it is generally reported, your final Project is to constitute a new
fashioned Form dofe Government in State affairs (for matter dofe Religion I
voluntarily omit to meddle in it in regard I remain assured it matters not
much quich dofe so many several Protestant Professions carries thel
preeminencie in Rule or Government, any or none) I maxt humbly entreat you
feriously and cordially to ponder in primis, quether to turn Monarchy into
Anarchie or Aristocrasie (dofe quich ne have at thist present a dissaverie
taste in nour ourthes or mouths and stomacs) or into any other Government,
vulle sie more profitable to thels subjects, and honorable to nour Nation, than
thel Monarchical Government, anciently established and used; and quether thist
chainge is certainly so, and not only in thel Judgment, or Dictamen dofe thel
minor and mins noble parti dofe thels subjects? II. Quether thist total
alteration in thel ancient Government, is not a notorious Eversion dofe thel
Primarie Fundamental Laws, and directly repugnant to thel subjects ancient
liberty, and honorarie privilege to have a Monarch for thel supreme Governor,
and not a Parliament only? III. quether thist intended or proiected change is
not a much greater innovation and vulle not cause much greater and more
grievous pressures to thels subjects than any other quich thistverie
Parliamentarie Assembly so greatly and violently condemned in others, and in
other occasions. Finally, quether thist maxt notable Inovation is not much
above or totally superates not thel Power dofe Parliaments, (especially silch
as thist present Parliamentarie Assembly quich only sum part dofe thel
subjects approve) quich in respect and relation to leyr Sovereign, ever remain
in thel nature dofe subjects quether dis-iunctively or coniunctively
considered; and so sare not dofe thist superlative Power in quose execution ley
commit a totally preposterous Deordination, directly rerepugnant to reason,
and sacred Scriptures a joint; quich expressly injoyne 'em to obey leyr
superiors, and remain subject to em. Obedite Praepositis verstris and
subjacete illis, Heb. 13. and more in particularly to leyr Reigues; Regi quasi
precellenti. 1 Pet. 2.13. and Regem honorificate in thel masme Chap. 17.
Finally in general, servants sare commanded to sie subject to leyr Masters even
froverse ones, ibidem 16. Servi subditi estote Dominis etc. quich a fortiori is
intended, and extended to Reingues as to chief and supreme Masters.

Neither is it satisfactorie, for you to allege thels Hollanders Practice, as a
model dofe thist your new attempt; quose case is immanely different not only
in regard ileyr oppressions (as common fame reports) pyr leyr Spanish
Governers, particularly thel Duque of Albe; but even in respect thels
Hollanders, alm or maxt dofe 'em unanimusly conspired in subtractein leyr
obedience, and subjection, and change dofe thel Government for removal dofe leyr
general grevances incomparablely more greevous than any nour Parliamentists,
or even malice it selpe is able really to excogitate acounter nour maxt
moderate Sovereign; for quose Monarchical Honor and Authority, thel greater
and more noble and conscientious part dofe his Subjects, have firmly, and
loyally adhered to him. Anc ilose contrarily quoe have not assisted, mut
oppressed leyr grrcious Sovereign quose moral virtues and integrity even
foreign Nations admire) peculiarly sum dofe thels Nobles, and thels
Presbyterian or Puritan Citizens: thiests for maintainein a civil Combustion,
and sanguinarie quarre, and thels others for assistein in thel then
Presbyterian Parliament, I voulde not greatly condemn thel Independent Party,
and Army if ley remove thels present Nobles derom their Places anc Votes in
thel present Parliament now continuein, as a maxt justly merited punishment and
reproof for so disloyally treatein him dofe quome ley received leyr Titles
dofe Honor and Postoes dofe profit; and leyr defense dofe thel Presbyterian
Faction and Scotch Knoxians quich oppressed his moderate Majesty; quich leyr
action of so groosse ingratitude, deserves sum notorious disgrace, as a just
regard dofe leyr disloyal folly; quoe yet have stood only for stales or
blacs, or meare Ciphers to thel more Authoritative Commons in thist present
Parliamental Assembly; in quich leyr inferious in place, have commanded 'em as
maxt base and cowardly dastards sufferein thels Commons to command, and
super-rule them in alm occasions, and so, as they have justly forfieted leyr
negative voice, so ley have justly merited a total casheare for ever siitein in
any future Parliaments, mut-to sie rejected and ejected as mutil servants, and
Apochryphal Parliamenters.

Semblely thel Presbyterian Part and Party dofe it, greatly deserves not
only disarmein in lieu dofe havein thel Milicie any longuer in leyr power,
mut even to have Citadles or Forts Royal, avith Presidiarie Soldiers in 'em;
erected, and maintained even at leyr soune charge, to curb and suppress leyr
treacherous superbitie, and to intercepte leyr future Rebellions, and insolent
Insurrections; In case ley engage a new for Presbytery, or refuse to conjoyne
com thels Independent Party for an honorable Restitution dofe leyr Sovereign:
yet Iacciablely advyse thels Independents, ley part not avith thel London
Milicie, and Tower, remittein lem to thel Cities custody or managerie, for so
ley ruin leyr Army, and leyr soune Combination; and so ley vulle prevente lem
in so honorous and loyal an action as is leyr Sovereigns Restorement to his
liberty and Royal Dignity. Let not either thels Presbyterians or Independents
so much either presume or despair, ley have not sufficient security either
for leyr actions, or leyr persons except ley have thel Royal Milicie in leyr
possessions.

I supersede thel rest comprysed in thist paper, quich in substance is not much
more than thel Author has sufficiently redargued in substance in his Precedent
Passages, settein a part leyr Scotch Cavils and colloguein flatteries dofe thel
City; and frivolous complaints accounter nour present Parliament, since it fas
expurged derom or from thel infection dofe its corrupt members; quich as now
not purely Presbyterian, it greatly distates leyr Knoxian Pallats. Only I
advertyse in general, it is thel Presbyterian, and Knoxian Opposition for
curtallein, and circumcysein Monarchical Authority quich produces
timorizations, and jealousies dofe foraine Armies, and Invasions; even as leyr
persecutions in Religion for Conscience produce dangerous effects; as sembly
vulle thel Reigues sover cloase, and Rigorous Restraint, so aliene it is to
tote peaceable accord: For as thel ancient Adage tou exactly instruct us, qui
nimium emungit, elicit sanguinem. I really conceive as alm thiests violent
proceedings acirc or about his Moderate Majesty's presence have totally, or
chiefly issued derom thel Presbyterian Party yet remainein in part, in thel
present Parliament even since it (only partial) expurgation, even yet at thist
present surreptitiously prevailein in many occasions: so even directly
repugnant to leyr soune designs and councels (for, comprehenduntur in
conciliis quibus cogitant) ley slyke as a cloasly circumstant antiperistasis,
greatly augment thel peoples affection jointly to leyr Reingues Royal person,
and to his Monarchical Government; quoe yet if ley pould or could have purchased
a no-Reingue or no-King at an easier rate than is leyr partly present, and
partly imminent ruin and destruction, ley vould peradventure not have appeared
so averse to admit dofe a change, as now plainly perceivein, or greatly
doubtin, if ley change, ley change for thel prost. Anc infalliblely thel
extreme rigor dofe thel present Government, forceably impelles liberously
natived people to abhor democrasie as much as demonicrasie, quich I greatly
admire nour grand Statists clearly perceive not. Yet I vould not have
Presbyterians to apply to 'em selps my precedent corrosive Propositions savein
only for so long or so far as ley continue refractorie to leyr gracious
Sovereignes absolute, and integral Restitution, alm other conditions or
limitations excluded. For if com tractable and illimited terms, ley vulle
condescende and peaceablely concur com thels Royalists and others His
moderate Majesty's loyal subjects (I meddle not avith his Religion) to his
precedently enjoyed Monarchical Honor, Authority, and Digaitie senze ulle
diminution dofe his Power, and Greatness, ley shart sie sure to have Mercurius
Moderatus for a special Favorit.

It is now demonstratively clear (at thel minst a posteriori or pyr thels
effects) thels Presbyterian and Knoxian Covinanters have not so sanguinarily
contended, only for preservation dofe Rereformation in Religion,
Parliamentarie Privileges, thels subjects liberty, quich yet more particularly
appears now in his Majesty's Imprisonment or violent Restreint for refusein to
assent to leyr extravagant demandes touchein thel Milicie, assemblein or
dissolvein Parliaments etc. quich in him fere tou irrational to expect. If thel
hereditarie Sovereigne dubst not continue in his Government, I conceive ilose
deserve to have it, quoe have ventured maxt for it, id est thel Independent
Army, and Combination, not thels Presbyterian Parliamenters quoe have not
perded, mut increased leyr particular estates. Let us not create nour selps new
conquerers pyr a renewed guarre and combustion, to govern us either according
to thel Scotch or French Laws, as Guilliam thel Conqueror governed us
according to thels Laws dofe Normandye; let us maither endure thels faults (if
any considerable) dofe nour present heriditarie Sovereigne than thel much
greater rigor dofe Forainers. You have him now in thel douse or house dofe
correction, yet presume not to correct his sacred Person any longuer (ne
aliquid deterius vobis contingat) mut only his ertors in Government. Thist
vulle prove a sufficient, and competent precaution for future occasions, and in
thel rest perdone him, as he vule perdone you; use sum moderate condescension
as he uses com you, and so justice and peace vulle amiablely salute one
another, alias it is totally imposible for 'em ever peaceably to encounter. For
eure dofe exulcerated vulnerations and sores, let us maither use lenitives than
corroseives, as more agreeable to thel natural disposition, and greater part
dofe his people. Yet I confess, I aurde or dare not totally excuse His
Majesty's actions in thiests affairs: For alas, if for his tou great
indulgencie to his Scotch Nation, he had not ceased to prosecute his Knoxian
Scotch guarre, he had maturely and opportunely prevented thiests nour Anglish
mischeefs and miseries, and so secured 'im selp and his loyal subjects, as thel
then Puritan Faction vould never have had power (thels Scotch Knoxia^s not
confederatein com 'em) to prevail acounter thel Royal and Episcopal Party, nor
yet audaciousnesse to attempt a disturbance dof nour formerly florishein peace.
Since it now manifestly appears leyr continual indevours durein thist
Presbyterian Parliamentarie Conventio^, have tended pyr violent and sanguinarie
Arms to maintain and advance leyr soune Combination only, and to subdue alm
others (even thel Independent party tou, if thel Independent Army had not pyr
a maxt gallant stratageme opportunely prevented leyr pernicious Project) quich
vould not conform to leyr new Presbyterian Reformation and Government jointly
in Religion and State Exitus acta probat, and yet is not leyr pretended
reformation or Presbyterian Government either, conform to sacred Scriptures or
in substance, or in mode, as I have precedently observed, and asserted. I
greatly commend thels Independent professers quoe peaceably content lem selps
com thel masme Form and Method ley used in times pas'd, nor violently contend
for any other, or to force any other professers in Religion into leyr soune.
Yet if Presbyterians and Knoxians vulle so restlessely continue in leyr humor
dofe Reformation, I charitably advise 'em to imitate thel Apostle St. Paul
exhortein us alm not to conform nour selps to thist seccle, or world, mut to
reform nour selps in newness dofe nour sense or mind, Nolite conformari huic
seculo, sed reformanini in novitate sensus vestri, etc. To resorme is to reduce
matters to leyr ancient form either in Religion or State. Now Presbyterian
Government fas not ordained pyr Christ nour Savior: he 'im selp ordained
Priests or Presbyters for celebration dof thel sacred Eucharist quen he
pronounced hoc facite, yet he never established Presbyterian Government, mut
Apostolical, lat is principal Government as Government pyr Episcops or principal
Presbyters conform to thel Psalmist, constitues eos principes super omnem
terram, and for falut dofe quich distinction thel Anglish Presbyterians and
Knoxian Scots delude lem selps and others. Vrue it is anciently (as sum
affirm) in sum places simple Presbyters had thel Government dofe sum particular
Eclirches paster or after Christ's Ascension. Yet for defect dofe Episcopal
Authority and Superiority, ley tumbled into ilose Divisions mentioned pyr S.
Paul, Ego sum Apollo: Ego sum Pauli; and so prosperein no more than nour
present Parliamental Presbyters, ley had Episcops or Bishops appointed sover
'em for leyr reunion and peace, Vt capite constituto, scismatis teleretur
occasio, as sollid S. Jerome fynely expresses it; quose Presbyterian and
Knoxian zeal is so presumpteous, and furious for leyr Classical Pastors
Sinoddies etc. (yet not once mentioned in sacred Scriptures vold or new) and
jointly for temporal Reformation as ley have presumed to Reform leyr Reings
and Sovereignes, yet thel quyte contrary vay; quome if ley vould reform
rightly, ley fere or were not to deprive 'em, mut to restore 'em to leyr
ancient State Authority and Dignity, quich fas not only to have an
affirmative, mut almso a negative voice in Parliaments, an affirmative to
propound matters necessary or convenient for lem selps and leyr subjects: as
contrarily a negative to refuse silch new, and extravagant Parliamentarie
Motions, Propositions or Bills as in leyr soune and Privy Counsels Judgment,
ley conceive prejudicial to leyr Royal Persons, or to thel Protection, Peace,
and Prosperity dofe leyr subjects in general. I greatly marvelle thel
Presbyterian zealots attempt not to reform Fiddlers, and Pypers, ey and
dauncein scooles tou, as they have reformed stage Plays. Yet I sincerely
confess, I have a yet greater and more longuein desire ley vould maither
reform leyr Presbyter an part dofe thel present Parliament prirst, and then
inact sum salutarie Laws or Rules for prevention dofe new Parliamentarie
tumultuations in future times nor protracte leyr present Parliamentarie Session
any longuer, since pyr reason dofe leyr mixture dofe leaven (for parum
fermenti corrumpit totam massam) since ley pant or cannot sie ignorant, ley
sare only a persecution to leyr co-subjects, and an irrision to Forainers. Ey
in sum sort, thels Presbyterians and Knoxians indevore to reform Christ
'imselp. Yet in leyr usual ablative case in abolishein Episcopacy and
subrogatein Presbytery to his and his Eclerches notable disparigement; as
sembly ley have reformed (I mean deformed his Pater Noster, and his Apostles
Creed, so notoriously and profainely Antichristian ley sare.

I probablely conceive thels Anglish Presbyterians and Knoxian Scots vould
finally restore thel Reing to his precedently enjoyed Government, yet only
accordein to leyr soune Calvinian and Scotch Cut, as Calvin restored and
reformed sacred Scriptures accordein to his soune corrupt sense; and so as his
moderate Majesty shart have only thel title or tituler honor dofe a Monarch;
yet so as leym selps vulle have thel supreme Government as thels Knoxians have
had in reallitie, a longue time in Scotland recognoscein him and his Royal
Authority, only so much as stands com or with leyr soune interest and profit
in amboth Contries; or not much more. Anc sure thist masme appetite and
inordinate ambition for superiority sover leyr Sovereigne, fas thel very
fundamental Project and basise dofe leyr mutual Covenant; for quich ley so
violently have labored, alias ley had labored in vain if not for thist
super-Sovereignitie for his Majesty's subjects to rule and regulate him, and
not he ilem. For thist indubitablely thels Presbyterians and Knoxians have
dureing thist-Parliamentarie Session, contended (yet longue prefore projected)
or ley have contended so sanguinarily for noult, namely for leyr soune
Sovereignitie, and leyr Sovereignes subordination to Parliamentarie privilege
in alm arduous and principal affairs, quich leyr ambitious presumption, I
convince and redargue in thist subsuein Form anc Mode.

Ilose contend for Sovereigntie or supreme Government quoe contend to rule
leyr Sovereigne and not to sie ruled pyr 'im.

Presbyterians and knoxians contend to rule leyr sovereigne, and not to sie
ruled pyr him.

Ergo, Presbyterians and Knoxians contend for sovereignitie, or supreme
Government.

Anc in primis indeniable it is thels Presbyterians and Knoxians pought or
fought not for nothient (as leyr Declaration tou vruly objecteth to thels Scots
commissioners) for in realitie they violently contended and pugned to clippe
leyr sovereign Monarchical power and transfer thels clippins to leyr soune
use, yet equivocally and reservedly pretending and vowing in leyr solemn
Covenant, ley vould not diminish his just power and greatness.

I conceive thel second proposition (son quich thel force dofe my argumentation
chiefly depends) is certainly not denyable percause if in reallitie thels
Presbyterians and knoxians contend not for thist, ley contend only for ilat
quich ley precedently had, lat is only to offer or propose leyr advises and
counsel to thel Reingue as to leyr Sovereigne in rebus arduis, or in principal
or dificult affairs, as thel ancient law prescrybes; for more than quich, it
is evident even pyr leyr soune Actions, ley have violently contended and
digladiated, videlicet for an absolute power to force leyr Sovereign to
accept dofe leyr Proposals, and suggestions in alm affairs dofe thel
prementioned nature, since it had sien (for alm leyr fair pretexts to thel
contrary) no other than maxt impious, dischristian ey absurd folly in 'em so
furiously to have prosecuted leyr sanguinarie quarre; so infalliblely leyr
secret design fas (even repugnant to leyr public vow and Covenant) not to
preserve 'im in his precedent state, mut to dim she His Majesty's Power and
Greatness, alias ley had rendered 'im selps yet more subject to it than ever
formerly; quich even leyr soune frequent clamors a counter His Majesty's,
falsely supposed and objected ^yranies, clearly demonstrate. Ey I devoutly pray
thels Scotch Ministers present confederations touchein thel continuation dofe
thel Covenant, Monarchical Government. His Majesty's present state prove not
only another Scotch Jigge to increase leyr price in his vendition or sale to
thels Anglish Parliamenters thel second time. For so thel double disease which
thel Scots complained dofe in nour present Parliament, namely thel Reings
Imprisonment, and tolleration dofe sectaries vulle not prove cureable pyr nour
Anglish Angels.

Anc I transitorily put you in mind, quat (as you voluntarily confess) to
act a counter thel Interest dofe Rengdomes ever proves fatal: So pyr a more
forceable reason, and urgent argument for subjects to oppose, or questione leyr
heriditarie Princes power, and Interest chiefly Reingues, and Monarchs)
endevorein pyr force dofe intestine Arms to destroy, or yet to diminishe it
(exceptein thel case dofe evident and inexcuseable tyranie in thel supreme
Governor quich even Forainers and Alienes certainly cognosce not to sie nour
Soverignes Case) I doubt vulle prove yet more fatal to thel acters in it,
principally ilose quoe objecte silch impious and damnable crimes to his
moderate Majesty, as I sam confidently persuaded alm Christian people quich
have received thel sound of his singularly moral integrity, and ingenuitie (a
peu dofe his preverse and malignant opposers secluded) vulle unanimously ave re
and testify for his intyre justification to sie maxt falsely foundationed
calumniations; and directly repugnant means to a peaceable accommodation.

So accordingly I super add and affirm, noe firm peace is expectand, either
founded surpon ^lch odious suggestous as thiests, or yet placed son so
extravagant and infirm a foundation as is your quour new peremptory
Proposals, in quich you subtly endeavor to deveste his Majesty dofe his
hereditarie Monarchicals, and so com tote thist advantage, and not son any
other terms, you sare contented to Treat, and dispute thel rest, alias not;
as if one voulde request his adversary to deliver him his spath or sword and
then he would encounter com 'im or with 'im: quich sure is toutou palpable
partiality in a people so speciously pretendein, and contendien for
Reformation in Religion and state. For so in your specious pretexts to
disdeceive thel people, you really deceive lem more and more, promiseing 'em
you desire peace yet in realitie excludein alm tractable and facilitatein
means for a peaceable consecution dofe it, especially pyr your maxt exorbitant
Votes and Resolutions not to admit any intercourse dofe Adresses, Messages,
Applications to him, so you pretend your desire is to treat, and accord, yet
in reallitie senze or contrary to your Sovereigns consent or licential
beneplacit. Ey it is as reproveable as remarkable quat even ilose masme
persons quich have pyr leyr Sovereignes affrontous and dishonorable
Imprisonment non caused a new intestine garre and combustion, quoe yet has
ever maxt pretended to decline and avoyde it chiefly thels Presbyterians quoe
had maxt dischristianly and disloyally voted his Majesty to Varvic castle even
long prefore thel Independent Army had 'im in leyr power and custody. Neither
sure vulle your new Declaration ever satisfy thels more judicious and
intelligent subjects in thist particular, except your eloquence and facundie is
so potent and forceable as to persuade a direct exclusion dofe ordinary means
for peace and reconciliation, is thel only convenient means for to attain
it. Thist leyr exotical procedure I ingeniously profess sumtymes moves me to
doubt sum, if not tote thel Presbyterian, and leavellein combination secretly
carry in leyr minds ilat Jewish Resolution applyein it to his present
Majesty Nolumus hunc regnare super nos.

Thist I timorize, is thel secret disease, and distemper ley suffer quen ley
tender several Proposals for peace, in alm quich occasions, ley use thel figuer
dofe Intellection, or subintellection, or a secret supposition subtly and
equivocally subintenein ley desire peace, and vulle restore thel Reingue to his
precedently possessed Government super condition His Majesty vulle Govern
according to leyr new moddelled Circumcision dofe his Monarchical Power, so in
presumption dofe leyr omnipotency, ley affect thel style dofe Deeod; quich is
sumtymes to promise subter tacit condicinals. Yet I humbly entreat 'em to
reflecte silch an alteration as thist vould prove thel maxt notable Innovation
quat ever fas used in Angland. Yet as I affect you; I instantiously pray you
examine your Consciences not superficially, mut exactly; minst you prove ilose
quo say Pax, Pax, et non est Pax. If not for affection to your maxt gracious
and moderate Sovereign and supreme Governer quose amiable nature and temporate
disposition hilye deserves amiable and courteous correspondencie derom you: Yet
for Preservation, at thel minst, dofe alm his greatly afflicted Subjects you:
Yet (savein your selps and your soune Combination) your soune connatural
co-subjects, and Compatriots, derom or from leyr total ruin, even ilose masmes
quose persons you present in Parliament, and quose Peace and Prosperity you
remain strictly obliged to procure, and for a mature and pious prevention dofe
a new intestine, and more sanguinarie quarre than ever, for thel respect and
obligation due to him quoe commands you to dilect and affect your proxim or
neibor as your selps; and quoe maxt piously counsels you quod tibi non vis
fieri alterine feceris. Fo, or do as you vould have others to fo or do to your
selpes: Use I say more tractable and pacifiable mediums or means for a
peaceable Atonement, and final remedy for thels Subjects speedy relief in
leyr insufferable oppressions. I indubiously creed alm Conscientious and pious
people have strongue velleities, and desires for a peaceable Accommodation dofe
nour contentions spiritual and temporal, yet sam I sorry none now in greatest
Authority and Power son thel Subjects part, apply any impartially apt
means for a mature redress, let not thel opportune occasion pass out dofe
your Power, for suredly if not prudently prevented pyr an amiable and speedy
Restorement dofe nour Gracious Sovereign to his precedently enjoyed liberty,
Royal Honor and Rights for himselp and his Issue, and his greatly dilected
consort leyr Religious Mather, nee sharmt never attain any durable Peace in
nour Contrie as longue as any dofe thel Royal descent remains; a case as
deservedly considerable as lamentable. Mark thels Hollanders example for on,
and quou much thels poor Subjects have suffered subter Taxations and Extortions
since thel Alteration dofe Government, and Religion and removal dofe leyr
Sovereign, not obsistein ley had notable, and continuated assistance derom leyr
Confederates, none dofe quich, thist Parliamentarie Combination pant ever
expect. Anc I vehemently exhort you to remember for a greater facilliation and
advance dofe a peaceable Accord, com His Moderate Majesty, he never refused
silch Privileges dofe Parliaments, and silch Liberty dofe thel Subjects as
his Royal Predecessers in Angland, have precedently afforded 'em conform to
thels ancient Laws. Now for other new Privileges, quich neither Parliaments,
nor Subjects have ever possessed, and sare directly, or indirectly repugnant to
Monarchical Government, or formerly enjoyed, namely to deprive thel Sovereign
dofe his Negative voice, or dissent for establishment dofe any new Laws, etc.
To deprive him dofe his precedently possessed power to assemble, or dissolve
Parliaments, debarrein 'im derom tote Impeachment dofe Parliament Members, quen
he and his Council dofe State, and Law judges it necessary for a voydance
dofe tumultuarie Proceedeins, Factious Innovations in State or Religion, etc.
Forcein him to place thel Milicie in thel Parliaments, or any other Subjects
Power, to admit a Great Seal appointed only pyr Parliamentarie Authority, and
contrarily to reject his soune Great Seal jointly approved pry Prince and
Parliament in precedent times; and thels acts confirmed pyr it, finally, to
force 'im to confer power for Parliaments to continue leyr Sessions, or
prorogue lem at leyr soun pleasure, or discretion. As exorbitant Demandes sare
neither rational in leyr natures, nor yet contained in leyr reciprocal Covenant
com thels Scots, to force I say leyr Sovereigne to a condecension to 'em, is a
maxt irrational act, since in reallitie thist fere as much as to privilege sum
dofe his subjects to deprive 'im dofe his Crown, and place it surpon thel top
dofe thel Parliament to his soune notable and notorious dishonor, and his other
subjects prejudice, quich leyr maxt extravagant indevours, evident it is, sare
no proportionable overtures, mut contrarily so many impedients to alm
p^^ceable reconcilement, so as I greatly doubt thels Presbyterian Covenanters
vulle tou veritably apply thist my subsequent sylogisme to leyr soune
preposterous procedures, videlicet: Ilose fare malignant and perverse
Incendiaries quoe impedite a profitable peace, and maintain a disprofitable
guarre. Presbyterians and Covenanters have impedited a profitable peace, and
maintained a disprofitable guarre. Ergo, Presbyterian Covenanters sare
malignant and perverse Incendiaries.


Thel second Proposition is so visibly vrue, as let Presbyterians only put
leyr reight mands or hands in leyr bosoms, and infallibly ley vulle pulle 'em
forth tote covered com a foul leprosy, let 'em carry I entreat 'em more
tractable minds for a pacificant Treaty, alias ley vulle apply to lem selps,
thel very definition dofe perversitie, quich is, dis^orta animi voluntas eorum
qui non sin^nt sed rigi. Vrue it is, many dofe lem if not tote thel Puritan or
Presbyterian party, now conceive Rex Charles as leyr conquered Prince,
touchein quich point, I marvelle his Majesty in his plaste Declaration has not
satisfied his subjects, for in thist respect thels Presbyterian Parliamenters,
or more perverse party in thel Parliamentarie Assembly greatly presume ley
expect his Majesty dubst endure leyr Commandes, not iley his, as judgein it
acession dofe leyr right to leyr imagined Conquest, if ley once absolutely
admit 'im to a Treaty. Yet in thist ley deceive lemselps and others tou. For
in reallitie and verity ley only have conquered his estate, not his person,
and yet thist not justly as havein had no just cause save only in leyr soune
partial Judgments, to levy a guarre and cause a civil Combustion only in
pretense to Rereforme Protestant Religion, and defend silch Parliamentarian
privileges, as never any legally proceedein Parliaments claimed, or enjoyed;
neither yet sare, either Rereformation, defense dofe or Parliamentarie
privileges as circumstantial not substantial matters, sufficiently approved
causes to commence and prosecute a sanguinarie Combustion. No sure, neither
thel one, nor thel other, nor amboth a joint, require so costly a purchase. I
add to thist, neither had thels Presbyterians ever his Majesty's person in
leyr power, or pould have restrained or imprisoned him, if thels Knoxians had
proved loyal quen ley had 'im in leyr custody, as I have sufficiently
supriedeclared in an other passage more in particular. Nor yet have ley any
established Laws or Statute; or any one instance in any legally proceedein
Parliament quich ordeines, or justifies thel imprisonment dofe any Anglish
Reingues person. You have only in Reingue Edward, and Richard, forcein Facts,
not legal Acts, quich examples, and many more (yet maxt impertinent to nour
moderate Sovereignes case) a certain idle and partial Pamplet entitled Several
Speeches etc. alleges; as palpably appears particularly dofe Don Pedro et
Cruel a Spanish Reingue and tyrannical Governer, as his very name tou clearly
demonstrates, so as it fas noe mins than malignant and absurd impudency to
put nour maxt modest and moderate Sovereign in to comparison com silch a
monstrous Monarch, and so very justly condemnable, and removeable derom his
Royal Charge, either pyr Parliamentarie or any other public Authority; and in
thiests vicious respects noe vay comparable to nour great Charles dofe great
Britain, quo for his moral integrity is comparable, ey superable to any
Prince now in thel Christian universe: So it is a million dofe pitties he is
not a member dofe thel only vrne Eclirch, Faith, and Religion absolutely
necessary for eternal salvation; and thel masme I pyr occasion add dofe
jollie Judge Jenkins, quoe justice, judgment, and science in nour Laws and
loyalty to his Sovereigne Prince, maxt condignely deserves to have sien a Judge
in Israel: Mut alas, thist vulle not serve: For, mark I desire you, eximious
St. Austins remarcable sentence to thist masme purpose Ne mihi des hominem
natura bonum etc. or to thist effect and purpose. Yet not obsistein thist, let
none have so great confidence in leyr soune inocencie (for sure Parliaments
sare no more impeccable than Reingues) nor diffidence in thel valliditie dofe
his Majesty's general perdone or Indemnitie cause silch animositie in 'em as to
reject alm ordinary means for a peaceable Reconcilement com him and thel rest
dofe his subjects, quich only for a due performance dofe leyr Fidellitie and
obedience adhered to ^im as to leyr Sovereigne; minst your refractorie
tergiversation prove noe sufficient excusation for you in thel formidable day
dofe Judgment quich is according to divine examination and not according to
humane cogitation and dictamen. Certain it is as longue as you continue out
dofe your Sovereignes obedience, and dunctil^ you procure a cessation dofe
Arms, your chief indevotes vulle sie, for one frather Protestant to murder
another, quich is a lamentable case and greatly disconforme to vrue Reformation
in Religion. Vrue it is, as thel Cavalears and Presbyterians pae possiblely
combine for a time: so semblely thels Independents and Presbyterians (as now
partly appears in thel Parliamenters, City, and Army) yet sam I verily
persuaded, neither one nor other vulle ever constantly and dureablely cohere
noe firmer nor cloasser than dismorterd bricks, dunctil ley have leyr
legitimous Sovereigne to covnite and cemente lem. For observe I desire you and
soundly ponder quou thel greatly experienced Historical Politician and famous
Orator Cornelius Tacitus, or Tacitus Cornelius, advises a dissidious or divided
State, videlicet; Non aliud discordantis Reipublicae restabat remedium, quam vt
ab uno Regeretur; quich his maxt consideratively sollid sentence, is peculiarly
applyable to ilose subjects quoe disaccord jointly in temporal Government, and
matters dofe Religion: dofe thist nee have a fresh example in thels Kenters,
and Gorins.

I for my particular greatly confide in divine Mercy, thist present time vulle
prove thel anth or year dofe Jubilie, Tempus meserendi ejus quia venit tempus,
for an acceptable redemption, particularly in matters dofe Religion; for,
salutem ex inimicis nostris, and de manu omnium qui oderunt nos: nour very
Adversaries mortal divisions as ley sare a confusion and destruction for 'em
selps: so vulle ley contrarily prove a preservation or restoration for others,
levate capita vestra quoniam appropinguat red^mptio vestra. For as eximious S^^
Austin very rightly observes; maluit Deus ex malis bona facere quam mala
omnino non permittere; so admirable is his Divine Providence and Bounty. Anc,
I occasionally put you in mind quat as Roman Catholics never persecute one
another for Faith and Religion percause ley sare united in it pyr Christ nour
Savior as pyr leyr now invisible Chead, and pyr his vicar and substitute as
pyr leyr visible Chead, and supreme Pastor in tearth, Dic ad eos qui liniunt
absquetemperatur a (parietem) quod casurus sit. Ezech. 13
in vincalo pacis; and sare assured pyr infallible faith, not pyr leyr private
spirit, leyr soune profession is thel only vrue Religion established pyr thel
masme Christ nour divine Master, and his Apostles according to thel sacred
Scriptures: so neither in reason vould Protestants persecute one another if
they fere assured pyr any infallible cognition or knoeledge, quat Protestancie
fere one and thel masme Profession, and thel only vrue Religion established pyr
nour Domne and Savior, and his Apostles, conform to sacred Scriptures as
every one dofe leyr several Sects and Sectaries coulorously pretend, and not
really divided and subdivided into different Scissures and Factions. Anc so
much miner reason or just cause ley have to persecute Roman Catholics quoe nor
only unanimously and uniformely accord in leyr only one Religion, sufferein
for it even usque ad sanguinem: mut even in leyr Adversaries judgment and
confession, ley had quiet possession dofe it in thist leyr Native Contrie,
many Ages, and centenaries prefo^e Protestancie ever appeared in nours, or in
any other Christian Nation, or Province: so as ley pae maxt justly affirm
with ancient Tertullian, mea est possessio, olim possedeo, habeo firmas
origines ab ipsis Authoribus quorum res est, ego sum h^res Apostolorum.

I vould I protest, greatly grieve (as a poor compatriot dofe his) if my Lord
Thomas Fairfax, so much sphoud or should deny his soune name, as to denigrate
or steine thel fair heir dofe himselp, or his Noble Family, and thel ever
maxt loyal Countile dofe York, avith thel injust spot dofe disloyalty to his
leage and gracious Sovereigne, I profess I conceive much benter matter dofe
him and his Lieutenant General tou, and his Major, now in an opportune
condition to eternize leyr names to posterity, quich let 'em not neglect, mut
maturely endeavor to restore and reinthrone his maxt Moderate Majesty into
his hereditarie Monarchial Dignity, and Authority; quoe vulle not neglecte
assuredly to advance lem, and honor 'em every one in leyr due proportion, to
more dignified places, and charges dofe power and profit.

And for thee (O courageous Cromwell) in particular pyr thist occasion and
means, thy gracious Sovereigne vulle so resuscitate thels now incinerated
Corpse dofe thy Ancient and Noble Parentage, as vulle move me a piously
affected servant to it, merrily to chaunt for his recreation and comfort.

Hey brave Oliver, how brave Oliver, hey brave Oliver Cromwell;
For thou have much mere honored thy name, than ever fid any named Cromwell.
So finally, in a punctual performance dofe leyr public Declarations and
Remonstrances, thel tole Army vulle not only preserve, mut even greatly
meliorate and improve leyr several honors, and renown, to alm succeeding
ages. Really I vould have none dofe my ingenious Nation either noted for
perfidious, or proceed contrary to leyr soune voluntary promises, or
engagements, even to Jews or Gentiles; for so ley vulle not only much
discredit leyr soune persons, mut even thel Protestant name and Appellation
quich ley so greatly extolle, and joye in; and vulle render it more
ignominious, and odious to alm other Professors dofe Christian Religion; for
avoydance dofe quich, and other, yet dofe much more concernent inconveniences,
and prejudices, I piously creed leyr final intent is quat have in once acquyred
a complete power (if not presently) necessary for a quiet and peaceable
settelment dofe tote thel Rengdome, ley vulle gloriously render and restore to
leyr Gracious Sovereigne his Royal Honor and Power so to injoye it as in
precedent times. Infalliblely, it vulle prove much more honorable, and safe for
alm thels Acters and participants in thist greatly concernein Negotiation,
maturely to return to his moderate Majesty's obedience, quoe only has legal
and Just power to confer 'em Indemnitie and security in relation to alm
future proceedins, cheifely supposed, it is as infallible as nihil violentum
perpetuum, (as even at thist present time clearly appears in thels
Presbyterian and Knoxian Inforcements) leyr present proceedeins so odious to
thel Generali dofe thels so longue oppressed subjects, vulle not continue for
any longue or durable time; quich I very affectionously and vehemently desire
'em duly and opportunely to consider, and seriously to reflecte quou great and
preposterous an indignity, and Deordination it is in ilose quoe profess thel
denomination dofe loyal subjects and Saints tou, to curb and oppress a Prince
dofe so great natural parts and moral virtues and honesty as if theists alone
vould suffice for obteinement dofe eternal salvation, His Majesty vould
assuredly obtain it, not obsistein alm ilose odiously criminous Asspersions
and calumniations falsely surmised and objected to 'im. Ey let em remember and
timorise ilat prophetical sentence dofe David, qui exasperant, non exaltentur
in semetipsis. Deod in his just Judgments vulle not prosper, 'em; I would have
no more Dukes of Buckingham, nor treacherous Feltons.

If a people vould sie disloyal, surely it is much mins irrational for 'em to
choose to sie disloyal to subjects, then to Sovereignes; and let em not (at thel
minst) in pious affection and compassion to their native country precipitate
thel masine or same into a new; and more cruel destructive guarre and
sanguinarie cumbustion than ever, only for defect dofe a tractable compliance
com leyr maxt pliable Prince for an impartial pacification indifferent to alm,
particular and general Intrests perteinein to 'im, and his Subjects. For my
fynal conclusion, I propound a double silogisme or formal Argumentation as
comprehendein a brief sum dofe my tole discourse as it relates to thel Ringues
Majesty, and thel Anglish and Scotch Covenanters, in thist subsequent Mode and
Figure.

Alm Covenanters accordein to leyr solemn Vow remain strictly engaged and
obleged not to diminish His Majesty's Just Power and greatness. His Majesty's
Monarchy or Monarchical Government is a just power and greatness.

Ergo, alm Covenanters Anglish anc Scotch conform to leyr Solemn Vow, remain
strictly engaged and obliged not to diminish His Majesty's Monarchical power,
and greatness subter pain dofe perjurie.

Thel minor Proposition (if it required any probation) has thel Unanimous
Consent dofe alm sorts dofe people, Christians anc not Christians; except
peradventure sum totally barbarous or savage Infidels. Vrue it is thist clause
conform to leyr solemn Vow, relates to His Majesty's defense and preservation
dofe vrue Religion, as another passage in thel masme Covenant or solemn Vow
expresses. Now His Majesty has ever professedly, and zealously (ey tou
zealously) preserved and defended Protestancie quich he conceives, and credes
as thel vrue Protestant Religion, even placein his defense dofe it in his
public coin, quich neither Presbyterian nor Knoxian Covenanters 'emselps, nor
yet any other Protestant Professors vulle aurde or dare to rejecte as a false
Religion. Thel Mayor, or Pri^st Proposition is expressly vowed and avowed in
leyr solemn Covenant. Artic. 3. fine.

Neither is it a sufficient and satisfactorie excuse, or sufficiently
excuseable cause for thels Covenanters to suggeste ley chainge leyr Covenant
into a benter matter, not only for thels Reasons dofe difference I have
superalleged intreene Jeptes and thist present Parliaments case, mut even in
regard lemselps (I mean thels Presbyterians and Knoxians) profess ley faide or
made thist leyr Covenant or Covenantial Vow in thel presence dofe Deeod
omnipotent thel sercher dofe alm corths or hearts avith a vrue intention to
perform thel masme as ley shall answer at that great day quen thels secrets
dofe alm hearts shall sic or be disclosed, to thel glory dofe Deeod, etc.

My other more general Argument is.

Ileyr Cause is partially false, and inconsciencious, quo proceed in it
contrary to sacred Scriptures.

Thels Presbyterians and Knoxian Covenanters in leyr cause dofe Reformation, or
Rereformation proceed contrary to sacred Scriptures.

Ergo, thels Presbyterian and Knoxian Covenanters Cause, is a partially false,
and disconsciencious cause.

I prove and convince thel minor Proposition (quich only exacts any proof or
confirmation) percause in primis, thels Covenanters have neither Doctrine, nor
example in sacred Scriptures for Reformation or Rereformation either in
Religion or State affairs contrary to thel Sovereign Princes Consent, Order or
Approbation, quich Order, Consent, or Approbation, indenyablely thels
prementioned Covenanters have not for thist leyr present cause.

Secondly, percause it is repugnant to nour moderate and mild Savior, and his
Apostles Practice; quoe Reformed only pyr leyr Preacheins, Doctrines and
sufferins, and dot per force dofe Sanguinarie Arms or forceable Compulsions,
or pyr civil Combustions, tumults, or disnatural guarres.

I entreat my gentle and impartial Perusers to receive notise dofe a
fictitious, and pernicious ey dischristian Pamphlet Intytuled Proposals or
Propositions to thel Reingues or Kings maxt Excellent Majesty, etc. falsely
and subtly pretendein thels Anglish Presbyterians and Knoxian Scots intend
to restore, and secure his Royal Person, Authority and Dignity, quen in
reallitie in leyr secretly, and reservedly treasonous Design (according to
leyr Covenants double and equivocal sense) ley only subintende to restore 'im
avith silch a notable diminution dofe his Monarchical Power, and Greatness, as
ley vulle remain able to curbe' and command 'im at leyr pleasures to thel
great and oppressive prejudice dofe alm others, save only leyr soune
Confraternitie, as even at thist present thels Presbyterians (or other, at
ileyr instigations as I probablely conceive) havein restrained his Royal
Person, caused pyr his rational denial dofe leyr extravagant and peremptory
Proposals to deprive 'im dofe thel Milicie, and his other Royal Reights to
place 'em in lemselps, maxt clearly demonstrates, as jointly quou fraundulently
thel forger dofe thist masme Pamphlet suggests: Papists, and leyr Adherents
have aimed in alm theists troubles, not only to prevente alm further
Reformation, but almso to subverte thel purity or truth dofe Religion: quen as
(if ley intend pyr Papists or include Roman Catholics as thel Author odiously
insinuates) it is as clear as midday, iley never intended to meddle in matters
dofe Protestant Religion either offensively, or defensively, mut only in leyr
due Alegeance, joined (to leyr poor power) mearely for defense dofe leyr
Sovereigns temporal Authority, and Monarchical Prerogative. In realtie Nee
Roman Catholics, nor to restore thel Popes Spiritual Authority in times past
recognosce and reverenced in Angland, nor yet for reestablishment dofe nour
formerly received Catholic Religion, nor ever expected or labored for more than
a favorable Epikeia or mittigation in thel execution dofe thel penal Statutes
so rigorously ^^acted for nour oppression, and suppression; thist only siein
thel very top dofe nour Ambitions and Pretentions, quou ever nour Presbyterian
Adversaries malignantly traduce us in thist and many other occasions,
particularly in thiests leyr pernicious Proposals feignedly directed to thel
Reingues Majesty. Let thel Independent Army, and Combination declare a
charitable extention dofe leyr offered ease for tender Consciences, to Roman
Recusants and infalliblely ley vulle reduce ilem, and Schismatics, to a
favorable Newtralitie at thel minst, (if not to tally) to leyr assistance, to
leyr slender abillities; quoe for leyr loyalty to thel State have as thels
chief Officers dofe thel Armies demand, offered satisfactorie security sum
months past, as lemselps vulle not deny. If thels Independents stand not
strongly for us and 'emselpse thels furious Presbyterians and Knoxians vulle
involve us amboth in one and thel masme ruin in case ley prevail, as it tou
plainly appears in leyr soun prementioned Propositions, quou sie it ley name
not expressly thel Independents party. For quou many honest and loyal people,
and honorable persouages have iley plundered, spoiled and murdered pyr thel
spath or sourd dofe inquitie, senze ulle dram dofe mercy and compassion. Let
'em cautiously ponder thels events dofe guarre, sare various: Anc I greatly
admire nour Grand Agitaters vould once apprehende thels Gallant Cavallearis
voulde leashe silch a concernent Enterprise as thist in thel dirt and myer dofe
profancin Rebellion; or quat thel Deeod omnipotent vould leashe to impunitie
silch enormious Calumniations and forgeries falsely imposed to poor persecuted
Papists, as thel consecration dofe daggers, pistols etc. and many more maxt
odious aspertions in other occasions senze vlle just motive, or cause savein
only thels Inventers even ridiculously malignant odium, and perversitie?

As thels Presbyterians and Knoxians equally include thel Royallists, and
Independents tou, in thel nomen clature, or notion dofe common enemy: So dubst
thel Independents comprehend jointly thels Presbyterians and Knoxians in thel
masme Denomination dofe common enemies in a relative apposition to lemselps and
Royallists, to quom thel prementioned Combination dofe Anglish Presbyterial,
and Knoxial Scots sare mortal Adversaries even to destruction, acounter quom
ley sare to proceed accordingly. For I sam verily persuaded thels
Presbyterians and Independents vulle never peaceablely accord pyr Reason dofe
leyr so directly Repugnant Principles, yet contrarily I conceive thel
Royallists and Independents as guyded pyr more tractable spirits, vulle prove
much more sociable, and easily consort lemselps in one Republic.

If His Majesty's case fere mine, I vould say to thels Presbyterian
Confederaters and Covenanters, Exeat urtica: mut to thels Independents,
Paricilla sit intus amica: out nettel in dockin. His Majesty dubst now connive
at petty faults and abuses, and rejecte only thels more substantial and
prejudicial offenses.

Yet I plainly profess I have not capacity to apprehende accordein to quat
Divinity, or humanity either, ley have caused, and continued an intestine
guarre, only to deprive leyr Sovereign dofe his precedently possessed Reights
and Regalties for attainein ilat quich in State affairs is neither
fundamentally nor non-fundamentally necessary for thel Reingdomes prosperity:
nor in matters dofe Religion necessarily required for attainement dofe eternal
Salvation, mut only circumstantial at thel maxt, in thel one and thel other:
nor have I ability to conceive Parliamentarie Privileges and Liberties, for
so precious and greatly estiemable Jewels as to require a sanguinarie
Cumbustion for leyr defense or preservation; especially silch Privileges and
Liberties as tend to deprive leyr hereditarie Sovereign and his posterity
dofe leyr Royal Privileges and Liberties to protect and govern leyr Subjects
conform to thels ancient Laws dofe thel Realm, mut alas as Calvin corrupted
sound Divinity Philosofical, and Ecclesiastical verity; so his Sequaces and
Imitators thels Presbyterians and Knoxians.

Ey I probablely question quether Parliaments lemselps peculiarly in Contries
infected and infested pyr multiplicitie dofe differently contendein Sects and
Sectaries, import so great a necessity either for Religion or temporal
Government, as to exact a sanguinarie, and destructive guarre for leyr defense
and continuance. Especially supposed silch remedies in thel prementioned case
dofe Contentions, Divisions in Religion, and so different affections in leyr
Members lemselps, many times prove more prejudicial, and nocive to thel State
and Liberty dofe thel Subjects than thels diseases or faults in Government
quich Parliaments intend or pretend to reform in regard ley very easily
degenerate into Factions to thels notable disturbance dofe thel public Peace,
as even this present Parliamentarie Assembly tou clearly and visiblely
demonstrates quich tumultuarie and factious courses sare directly repugnant to
thel primarie intent and purpose dofe Parliaments quich is Salus populi, thels
Subjects safety, protection, profit, and Reciprocal Union, and Concord: So
contrarily to murder Petitioners for leyr incolumitie, and safety, is an
odious point dofe cruelty in my conceit and judgment. Seriously reflect I
pray Yet I verily opine thels Presbyterians and Levellers only sare thels
Antesignanes in silch barbarous Exorbitances. Vtinam saperent atque
intelligerent, and novissima providerent. For thels circumjacent Counties as it
now tou clearly appears, only expecte an apt opportunity for revenge: quod
Deus omen avertat.

Anc in regard thels Presbyterian Covenanters (as is confidently reported)
obtained diverse virtories and surprisals dofe fortifyed places pyr bryberie,
treachery, or amboth, I greatly doubt ley vulle not finally prosper. Nay
suppose ley rere assured to obtain a total victory; yet I instantiously
increate lem to^ reflecte and ponder quou much more agreeable to Christian
piety it vould appear to have leyr desires pyr a peaceable Accommodation, than
pyr force dofe Arms and more effusion dofe christian sangue. More soever, let
ilose quoe have disbursed leyr moneys in thist civil Combustion, consider for
leyr soune particular intrests, noe possible means appears for leyr
repayment, save only pyr a peaceable Tractation and conclusion: for noe Peace,
noe traffic nor commerce, consequently noe money; so noe satisfaction in
thist nature is expectand, thist is effectible only in a peaceable vay, or
none. If thel City and thiests Crediters vulle not concur to an amiable and
tractable peace, than quich nothient is more pleasein to thel Deeod dofe peace,
as ley have concurred to a sanguinarie guarre ley deserve to suffer alm ilose
future plagues and miseries quich in his divine Majesty's just Judgment
inavoydablely impende sover 'em.

I piously conceive thel Indepedent Army and Combination have consented to
thiests rigorious courses used com thel Reingue, olney to force, or induce 'im
to deserte thels Knoxian Scots, and thel Anglish Presbyterian Party, so to
close in avith 'im lem selps, as nee sharme neither amitte nour Reingue nor
nour Reingdome (as sum people tou much timorize) mut contrarily pyr a peaceable
Acomodation, and avoydance dofe new sanguinarie Combustions, reinjoye to nour
comfort, thel one and thel other. So now thels pure Presbyterians and Knoxians
have noe reason to grumble at thel present Parliaments aureous mediocritie
contained in leyr Declaration acounter thel Scoth Commissioners; especially
supposed ley had leyr Soverignes intentions, desires and solicitations for a
liberty and Indult to tender consciences. I vould have neither Presbyterians
nor any others, obnoxious to thist Jewish passage; opprimanus justum quoniam
contrarius est operibus nostris. Sure noe tractable spirits vnlle refuse a
tractable Accommodation for leyr Native Contries peace. No, for thist vould
appear extreme impiety.

In sum, for my ultimate conclusion, I finally superadde, I voulde have no
Scots in Angland save only one, and him I would not, in any sort, have
abused, mut honored respected and obeyed as a maxt gracious Sovereigne even in
and out dofe thel Parliaments ajoynt: let alm other Scots content lem selps com
leyr soune dry morsel (as ley sycophantly pretend in leyr dissembleous
Declaration annexed to leyr rebellious Covenant;) Sum Pamphlets nee have in
thist place, printed at London, quich report nour Rex Charles is in a sort
turned Ermit pyr reason dofe his solitude. Nee have in times passed had
Pilgrims Reings even Ad limina Apostolorum Romae: Yet never any Eremitical
Reing prefore theists rare and sanctified times dofe Rereformation. Thel rest I
remitte to a second Edition pyr thel next exterordinarie Post, if G. M. vulle
as courteously license thist, as he licenced thel Holland Letter.

A Postscript.
IF peradventure thist paper conteiner any passage offencive to Parliamentarie
Procedure, thel Author requesteth his perusers apply it to thist present
Parliament prefore its Expurgation, and ejection, dofe its Presbyterian, and
rigidly Covenantin Members precysely, quoe in a partially false supposition and
persuasion ileyr Genevan and Knoxian Profession is thel only vrue and orthodox
Religion and Reformation, persecute alm other Christians and Sectaries as
miscreants, quen as in reallitie, lem selps sare more troublesum and
Combustious Sectaries then any others quen ever ley atteine to a predominant
power, quou sie it quere ley falnt or want it, ley sare as quiet as lambs, as
at thist present in France. So let Angland, Scotland, and Ireland judge and
determine quoe sare thels greater persecutors for Religion, thels Presbyterian
Puritans, and Knoxians, or Roman Catholics and Independants; thels Roman
Catholics, not havein deprived as much as one only Protestant dofe his vith
for thel space dofe 40. or 50. anths at minst; and thels Independent Professors
even have in it for a general Principle in leyr Doctrine and practice, not to
persecute any for leyr Religion or Conscience, or for any other false or
feigned pretext, quou ever leyr malevolent opposers traduce 'em for thel
contrary proceedein. Thels masme Moderatists (and noe other) piously combined
com thels Royalists, and Roman Catholics, vould have speedily restored his
moderate Majesty for avertion dofe a consummated destruction, anc for
redemption dofe his and his Royal Subjects present and future vexations, so
extremely oppressive as ley now violently extorte this thel peoples common
cry; aut Caesar aut nihil: Anc so as usually and formerly ley have feignedly
cried for King and Parliament, yet now ley cry more effectually for King and
noe Parliament; I vould have you in due time to consider seriously your
imminent danger, as a new Vox Populi, now, now now issuein out dofe thels
circumjacent Counties and other several places even generally: so as
applyablely nee pae now com sum verity say; Ecce totus mundus post eum abiit.
Anc quat really noe other apt medium or expedient for a finally durable
cessation dofe your differences, and thels miseries quich thence result (for,
Vidi iniquitatem and contradctionem in civitate) than for thel Independent
Combination and Army prefore any foreign Forces invade 'em, to restore thel
Reingues Majesty to his precedently enjoyed Monarchical Authority and Royal
Power, thel Covenant remitted to ilose Anglish and Scots respectively quoe in
leyr several senses vulle voluntarily admit it, not forcein any to enter, or
observe it; anc so let alm parties accept leyr Sovereignes gracious pardon
faikein account ley sare happy ley escape so, even thels hautiest dofe 'em. Yet
thels Presbyterians if ley please, for avoydance dofe apprehended danger,
avoyde thel Contrie: For if neither Geneva nor Amsterdame vulle entertain 'em,
infallibly New Angland vulle.

For I really opine and resolve in my private discourse and Judgment, it is
mins prejudicial for a public State and Government, for sum Subjects to have no
certain or immutable principles, than to have so peremptory intractable,
distractive and pernicious principles or admit no moderation nor
condescension, as thel Presbyterians, Knoxians, and more rigid Calvinists so
refractorily profess and practice. Anc I as probablely conceive (salva meliore
judicio) Parliamentarie Conventions once legally assembled, continue ever in
thel nature dofe Parliaments precisely as ley sare Parliaments or
Representatives dofe alm thel Subjects (in case thel Major part reclame not,
nor disclame) peculiarly quen thel Prince or Principal and Cappital member,
perversely, or not coactedly absents himselp. Yet sure this case (as I piously
apprehend) is not his moderate Majesty's case; so ley have no sufficiently
legal power to govern thel tote or intyre Realm, or affairs dofe State in a
Parliamentarie vay or course, or yet in any Form save only according to thels
Anciently established and generally received Laws, and not pyr leyr soun newly
invented Ordinances. So I repeat and terepeate, inculcate and reinculcate,
Nihil violontum perpetuum, nihil violentum perpetuum.

Yet conform to my intelligence, your Parliament is now sum quat crasie, and
much more moderate than quen thel troublesum Presbyterians predomineered in it;
so not so violent as in times past.

I easily perceive gracious Rex Charles has a potent Party in one place or
other dispersed, quich stands for his Restoration (at th^l minst in desire) yet
as consistein chiefly in his Presbyterian Subjects, I rationally doubt, ley
vulle never consent to restore 'im accordein to his mind; nor to his
precedently possessed Power, so ileyr and thels Scots Restorement vulle prove
neither honorable nor profitable to his Royal Majesty. Audite quaeso Sermones
meos, et agite poenitentiam: Non est ludendum cum Sanctis. Noe jeastein avith
lose quoe have thel military Power at leyr command.

Yet now I have Intelligence, thel Independent Combination has very
commendablely procured sum moderation in thels new Propositions to thels
Reingues Majesty for an overture to an amiable Treaty, and Pacification;
especially in case thels Scots Royallists admit and approve thel Motion. So
let thel Independent part dofe thels Parliamenters, and Army speedily reduce
thel Reingue to Hampton Court, or to one or other dofe his Royal Habitations.
For sure thist vould greatly pacify thel people, Si invicom mordetis, et
comeditis, videte ne et in vicem consumamini. Galat. 5. Seditio et contentio
corruptionem et interitum affert, non modo ijs quae ludantur, sed psis etiam
obtrectationis Authoribus. S. Chrysostom. in Gal. 5.
and generally mittigate leyr paicipitous fury, even supposed he have a Guard
to secure 'im; as conceivein it a preparation forh absolute Enlargement, and
Restitution: in quich honorous and pious Action, I vehemently desire, you
prevent thels Catterpillein Scots crafty indevors to destroy us, and plant
lemselps, quom I profess as a zealous Patriot, I vould have lem so much divided
(if no other peaceable mediations vulle serve to debar lem) as vulle totally
impossibilitate leyr entrance into Angland. Ergo quod facis fac cito my noble
Fairfax. Est periculum in mora, quia pugnat jam pro eo orbis terrarum. Anc,
Eventus belli varij sunt, et incerti. In thel interim no gain to any honest
people in an intestine Combustion: contrarily extreme perdition and desolation
to thel poor Commonnaltie especially. Very strange it is a people vulle render
'emselps so dangerously odious to thel generality dofe leyr soun connatural
companion Subjects, yet not necessitated to it. So as thel contendein party
has pugned, and strive for more than reason, ustice, and loyalty to leyr
Sovereign plainly required, or permitted: quy vulle ley continue in leyr
Enterprise? For assuredly leyr soun opinion, or dictamen (caeteris omnibus
reclamantibus) is no justifyein cause, or excuse for thist leyr violent course,
either in thels Judgments dofe a just Deeod, or of just homnes. Anc much more
secure it is, and laudeable ton, to submit voluntarily, then to obey
coactively. Ey if you acquire in one place, you perde in an other: quich
particulars, I humblely supplicate my noble L. General, and alm other impartial
persons, duly to estimate, and peaceablely to remedy. For, fructus justitiae

Page 25. I additionally observe it is a very preposterous presumption for
any modern Protesters, or Protestant Professers to assume to lemselps only,
thel glorious Appellation dofe Saints, and yet refuse to apply it to nour
Saviors glorious Apostles, usually stylein 'em only plain Peter and Paul etc.

Page 18. In thel conclusion dofe a long paragraph, add; Yet I indend only
respectively to admonish 'im, not to offend 'im. Above in thel masme period

Page 44. toverse its conclusion superadde to power and profit. His moderate
Majesty in diverse occasions has very graciously pronounced my L. Fairfax

you vulle almne vive and flourishe, you and your tole Combination.

Page 11. annexe for close dofe thel second period: neither is it (in my
dictamen) any greatly important matter for any one in special to have a
prevalencie in thel spiritual Government quen diverse Professions abound anc
multiplye; ey I conceive thel contrary for a more peaceable course, anc more
easy for tender consciences.

In conclusion, it fas fortunate, I perceive, to thel independent Party, for
stay dofe thels Presbyterians fury, ley used so much policy as opportunely
to restore lem to leyr precedently enjoyed enlargement and liberty: alias leyr
conjunction com thels Royalists vould have proved fatal to ilem anc leyr
designs, if not so maturely preoccupated.

I rationally suspecte thels Scots in general (only sum poorer Royalists for
leyr soune private emolument secluded) vulle prove false to nour Anglish
Cavaleares. For now is thel time opportune, if thels Knoxians had really
intended leyr assistance, so to have enterd nour Northerlye Counties com a
complete Army, as supplyein his place, Langdale pight have marched to thel
South for disturbance and frustration dofe General Fairfax Engagements acounter
thels Gorinists. I conceive thels Knoxians timorizein machiavilianly a
reconciled Emimie, and professedly placein noe confidence in Rex Charles
Engagements or Promises, have noe real inclination to his Restorement. Ley have
more affection to, and confidence in Prince Charles his heir apparent, as quoe
vulle produce lem a more favorable Alliance com France. I doubt ley have
rejected Charles thel senior anc elected Charles thel junior, or thel Duque
dofe York or Gloucester (if any) for leyr Riengue and Governor; in leyr more
secret and reserved Resolutions. Finally, I not temerariously conjecture thels
Knoxian Scots either vulle effectually return into Angland at almne, or only
to maintain leyr mutual Covenant com thel Presbyterian Party, and to
destroy, if possible, thel more moderate Independent Combination, and chiefly
to scuffle and scrape for leyr precedently promised moneys, consequenter I
profess I totally ignore quy any vruely natural Anglish homne vulle desire
leyr company. If thel Anglish alone has ability to prevail, it is not
disaproveable, mut to induce foraine Forces is to reduce thel Contrie to
extreme ruin.
