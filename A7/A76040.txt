Algier Slaves Releasment: OR, The Unchangeable Boat-Swain.
No Prison like the Jayl of Love,
nor no such torments found;
To those that loyal mean to prove,
whose loves are firm and sound;
This loyal person never would change,
like a true Lover he;
Endured his Fetters and his Chains,
and Betty's Captive be.
To the Tune of, Awake, Oh my Cloris.






OF a Constant Young Seaman,
a Story I Will tell:
That I hope all true Lovers
will please very well:
All his cry was still, though
I continue a Slave;
Yet the want of my Dear.
is far worse than a Grave,
All the tedious song Night
in close Prison I lie;
But methinks I behold
my dear love lying by:
In the mid'sf of my pains,
this does still give me ease;
That is pleasant to me,
which some call a Disease.
Sometimes to the Galleys
I Am forced to go;
Though amongst all my Fellows,
like a Slave I do Row:
And when I am spent
with this Labor and Pain;
The thoughts of my Love
does revive me again.




ANd when with Strappa does
sometimes I do meet:
I find little Pain,
if I think on my sweet:
Thus 'twixt Pleasure and Pain,
my time I do spend;
Yet vow to be Constant
unto my Lives end.
No Torture nor Prison
shall make me forsake,
Nor fly from my Reason,
for my Betty's sake:
I do slight all the Torments
bestowed by the Turk;
When I think on my Dear,
and in Gallses do work.
But a Renegado
to make me they strive;
I Will never consent to it,
whilst I am alive:
But will a Courageous
true Protestant be:
I Will be true to my faith,
and be constant to thee.
Ah Betty, when Billows
do Rage and do Roar,
For want of thy sight
I am troubled sore:
Whilst others are troubled
with terror and fear;
Yet I am cheered up
with the thoughts of my Dear.
No Prison is like
to the want of thy sight;
Which Locks up my bliss,
for thou art my Delight:
Though distant I am,
therefore only oppressed:
Yet still my dear Betty
does lodge in my breast.
In the midst of my forrows,
whilst others do mourn;
It Is the want of my Love
that does make me forlorn:
Yet would not enjoy thee
in this cursed place;
Though for want of thy Love,
my tears trickle apace.
But be of good cheer,
for every one knows,
It Is an is it Wind indeed
that no comfort blows.
And again I do hope
thee in England to see:
Then who will be so happy
as Betty and me.
And now thorough Provsdence.
I am returned;
By Shipwreck I escaped,
for our Ship it was burned:
No torment like mine was,
when I was a Slave:
For the want of my Betty,
was worse then a Grave.
FINIS.
