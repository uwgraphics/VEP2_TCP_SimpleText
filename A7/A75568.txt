ARGYLES ARRAIGNMENT; OR, TREACHERY DISPLAYED.
SCotland now raise thy Triumphs to the height,
Since Heaven intends to Vindicate thy Right
And Liberty; Justice begins to smile,
Since the Commitment of the Arch-Argyle,
Whose horrid Crimes still added to thy pains,
Thou never were free till he was bound in chains:
What Ruin, Murder, Sacrilege and Rapes,
Upon the Lives, Souls, Honor, and Estates
Of faithful men committed were by him,
Whose every action was a heinous crime
Against King and Country; We may justly crave
Vengeance on him, who most unjustly gave
Such barbarous injustice unto all,
And yet (O strange) was Justice General Argyle was Justice General of the
Highlands, and slands in Scotland.

The noble Ghosts of Huntley and Montrose,
With thousands more, who bravely did oppose
His cursed designs, whose Royal blood he spilt,
Which now at last serves to enhance his Guilt,
Shall gladly from the highest Heavens descend,
To view his Tragic and deserved end,
And be Spectators of his fatal Doom
As be rejoiced in their Martyrdom.
No words can serve to utter what I think,
No world of Paper, nor a Sea of Ink,
Can well point out these Villainies which he
Has acted by infernal Treachery
Against his God, his Country, and his Prince,
His Father, Friends, and Kindred, all at once.
I leave him then, till heaven be pleased to bring
Him to the Justice of his God and King.
