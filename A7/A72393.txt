The Preface.
What each man does, and each man blante^ nor onse we may him see
Come face to face, but we once gone then stoutly stepp^ out he:
And all he carpes that there he fyndes ere half he read to end,
And what he understands not, blames* though naught he can amend.
But were it so that such were none, how may these youthful days
Of mine, in thing so hard as this deserve of other praise?
A labor long (quoth I) it is that riper age doothe crave:
And who shall travail in thy books, more judgment ought to hou^
Then I: whose greener years thereby no thanks may hope to win.
Thou see dame Nature yet has sett^
No hears upon my chynne.
Traue this therefore of grauer age, and men of greater shill.
Full many be that better can, and some perhapps that will.
But if thy will be rather hent, a young man^ wit to prove,
And think that elder learned men perhaps it shall behoue,
In woork^ of w^ight to spend their time, go where Minerua^s men,
And finest wits do swarm: whom she has taught to pass with pen.
In Lyncolnes Inn and Temples twain, Grayes Inn and other mo,
Thou shall them find whose paynfull pen thy verse shall florishe so,
That Melpomen thou would well ween^ had taught them for to wright,
And all their woorks with stately style, and goodly grace t'endight.
There shall thou se the self same North, whose work his wit displayes,
And Dyall does of Princes paynte, and preach abroad his praise.
There Sackuyldes Sonettz sweetly sauste, and featly tyned he,
There Nortons ditties do delight, there Yeluerton^ do flee
Well pewrde with pen: such young men three, as ween thou might again,
To be begotte as Pallas was, of wyghtie Jove his brain,
There hear thou shall a great reporie, of Ba^wyns worthy name,
Whose Mirror does of Magistrates, proclayme eternal fame.

^upid Venu^ darling dear,

^ou tookst on thee Asscanius shappe.
Would I not like grief should grow,
(...) thereby, as did to me.
But that she may then partly kn^w^
What time I spend in misery,
Ne yet I wish her no such end,
As destiny did to Dido send.
But only this I wish thereby,
That she as l^tle power may have,
At any time aside to wrie,
The humble iute that I do crave,
As Did^ had when she did yield,
Unto Eneas in the feelde,
Finis.

For to be deer, who will neicer,
In feathers fre^^ and fair,

That sugared poysen each ill woman is.
To poison sweet, tho Mantua like,
Fair dames as fresh as flowor.
Yet pleasnunt tas^t. shall be imbraste,
Before the cause that's sour.

For Paris wrought that strife.

Which through the world had (...) so great renown^

The variable thoughts of the Lover captive.
I Live in hope and yet despair,
I do rejoice when grief does grow,
I fly aloft above the air:
But dwell always in Limbo low.
I never seek: tho much I find,
Yet find nothing and still do seek:
I see what best contents my mind:
When most in mind I do mislike.
One has me in captivity,
So suer that I uneath may swerve:
Who lets me live at liberty,
As free from bands that I deserve.
Finis.
The defense of vvomens will.
WHo women wishes in things to have their myu^
To leave good life in judgment is but blind. w. v.
