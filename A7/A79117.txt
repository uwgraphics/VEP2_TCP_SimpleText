Inconveniences and Mischiefs that may arise and happen by the Riotous and
Tumultuous Assemblies, in and about the Cities of London and Westminster, not

and the Liberties thereof, and also of the Suburbs and Confines of the said
Cities and places adjoining, That upon no occasion they do assemble themselves
in any Tumultuous or Riotous manner, in any part or place in or near the said
Cities or Liberties, and that all persons now assembled in any numbers,
(without His Majesty's authority) do forthwith, upon publishing this His
Majesty's Proclamation, dissolve their Assemblies and Companies, and repair to
their dwellings or places of abode, upon their perils, of being proceeded
against as violaters of the public Peace of this His Majesty's Kingdom, and of
being punished according to the severity of the Laws and Statutes of the same.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, this eight and twentieth day of December, in
the seventeenth year of Our Reign.
