A PROFITABLE And well Grounded Concordance, Both fitted for the meanest
Capacity, and very useful for general good; Wherein may be readily found the
chiefest Words contained in the Scriptures. Also the chiefest Doctrinal Heads
of Scripture, opened and illustrated, both by Reason, and Argument. Being a
Subject of the most useful nature yet Extant. By the industrious Labors of W.
Chadwell.

John 5.39. Search the Scriptures. Psalm. 19.7. The Testimony of the Lord is
sure, making wise the simple. LONDON, Printed by G. Dawson, for Francis Smith,
at the Elephant and Castle, near Temple-Barr, 1660.

Mr. Den in Commendation of this Book.
THis Concordance will pleasure the poor, who are not able, and the rich, who
many times are not willing to be at so much cost as will purchase those of
greater value; I am confident it will be helpful to the Ignorant, and useful to
the Learned, who will not disdain to take it into their hands: The Author never
saluted the University Schools, lays no claim to the Title of Master or
Doctor, makes not his boast of the knowledge of the seven Sciences, neither is
he skilled in any save his Mother Tongue, but is counted among the number of
those, whom the World counts Unlearned; yet surely he seems to have learned the
Holy Scriptures, and the things of God, which is the best Learning; it appears
he has not spent his vacant hours in idleness, or more vain occupations, but
in frequent Meditation, and reading of the holy Word of God, so often tracing
the walks of Gods Garden, that he is able to show you in what Bed every Flower
grows. This his painful industry will judge the greatest number of men,
especially those whose trade it is to search into the Secrets of the Word, and
have nothing else to do, but to give attendance unto Reading, and yet read
nothing less than the holy Scriptures, which is the reason they are so great
strangers to the Words of God, and to Truth it self.

I did once hear a great Rabbi in the University, deny that there were any such
words in the New Testament as these, If Jesus had given them rest, then would
he not after have spoken of another day, Heb. 4.8. I could fill a sheet with
Stories in this kind; I was once present before a Committee of men of great
wealth, and repute, within Trinity College, Cambridge, where the Chairman
denied, that there was any Text of Scripture, that spoke of the Baptism of
Women; he that affirmed, demanded of the rest of the Gownmen, whether none of
them had ever read of Women Baptized, all being silent, a Bible was required,
and the 8. of the Acts, and the 16. of the Acts laid before them; they then
confessed, they had never observed it before: Is it not a vanity of vanities,
for men to read a multitude of Books, and to neglect the great Book. The Author
of this Concordance seems to have walked in the best path, to the best
Learning; I confess when the Book was brought unto me, and I had conferred with
the Author, I could not without admiration, remember what is written, 1 Cor.
1.26, 27. You see your calling brethren, and the like; I could not without
blushing look upon the Book, considering with my self, what a Learned man once
spoke of old; Indocti rapiant caelum, etc. which at better leisure I translated
into this Distich;

Unlearned men do find the path to Heaven,
When Scholars miss the way, who claim Arts seven.
From Rosemary Lane, Aug. 7. 1659. Hen. Den.

FRIENDS,
WE have taken a veiw of this Concordance, and we cannot but judge, according
to our understanding, that it will be of more use than any of the like Volumn
or price now in being, and will be a great help unto such, who desire to be
acquainted with the holy Scriptures, which is a thing of great use, especially
in these our days: we cannot but judge, that the Author has taken great pains
in bringing of it into this order, and also loss of time, and charge, and
therefore we hope that none who fear the Lord, and desire to make his Law their
Rule to walk by, will slight it, although the Instrument from whom it come, be
of little esteem in the World, but rather to accept of it, and give glory to
him that has given such wisdom to poor Creatures: And whereas he has enlarged
himself upon many things, as Faith, and Fear, and the like, we shall say little
to it, the Scriptures are proof sufficient, and therefore it needs none to
speak for it, much less such as we are; but for as much as it is impossible in
these our days, that any thing can be put out to public view, but it will
meet with opposition, let it be never so sound, therefore it cannot be
expected, that this will go free from censures; but if any that fear God, or
desire so to do, may be benefited by it, it is no matter what such say, who are
apt to carp at any thing; which that it may so profit, shall be the desires of
us, who shall be ready to serve you, in what we can, in the Lord Jesus Christ,

Farewell.

Thomas Perrot. Christopher Miles.


Mr. Harrison in Approbation of this Book.
I Have (as my time and opportunity would permit) cursorily perused this brief
Concordance; wherein I find many principal Doctrines of the Gospel opened, and
confirmed, several practical Truths deduced, and applied, and all this from
variety of Scripture proofs; which (though I had not leisure particularly to
examine, yet so far as I can judge by a sudden glance) I conceive are
pernitent and concluding; and therefore do commend the pious, and sober
endeavors, diligence, and pains of the Author, (a person altogether unknown to
me, but by this his Labors) in contributing his Mite to help forward weak
Christians, in finding out the mind of God in the Scriptures, (especially in
such a day as this, wherein so much precious time is wasted, and so much
innocent paper blotted, to vilify, debase, and overthrow the authority of Gods
holy Word, and to introduce senseless, profane, and cunningly devised Fables,
of brainsick Apostates, into the room thereof) hoping it may (by the blessing
of God) prove some furtherance to the Faith and Piety of such, who shall make
trial of it.

September 5. 1659. Edward Harrison.

To the Churches of Christ Jesus, who are called to be Saints, and are built
upon the sure Foundation, and wait upon God in his own way, contending
earnestly for that Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints.
IT has been, and yet is, the way and manner of men, to Dedicate and shroud
their Works under the Wings of some Honorable Persons here on Earth, not
considering the saying of Solomon, Eccles. 4.13. Better is a poor and a wise
child, than an old and foolish King. And also, Prove. 28.6. Better is the poor
that walks in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though
he be rich. But through the goodness of God, I see and know you to be the
Persons, who are the Objects of Gods Honor, Psalm. 91.15. John 12.26. For you
are the Sons and Daughters of the great God; the Brethren of Christ; Partakers
of the Holy Spirit; and Heirs of a most glorious Kingdom: And therefore to you
I commend this small Treatise, hoping it will be profitable, and of great use
unto many, who desire to be Studients in the meaning of their Heavenly Fathers
Will; which that it may, shall be the hearty desires of him, who is,

A lover of all those, who in sincerity wait for the Coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ. WILLIAM CHADWELL.

The Occasion of this Treatise.
IT has been in all Ages, and yet is, the manner of Gods dealing with the sons
of men to reveal his truth, and to give wisdom and knowledge into such, as are
despised in the Worlds eye, amongst which number, the Lord has been pleased to
give some Testimony of the goodness of his Grace toward me, and knowing it was
not good to hide my Talent in a Napkin; Also remembering a passage concerning
four Lepers, who when the Famine was sore in Samaria, by reason it was
besiedged by the Assyrians, and knowing of they staid in the City, they should
die with Famine, and if they went out, they could but die, so they ventured out
into the Camp of the Assyrians, who when they came, contrary to their
expectation, found their enemies fled and gone, and had left abundance of
Wealth and Victuals behind them; so these four Lepers did eat and drink, and
took plenty of Silver and Gold, and hid it; but remembering that their Brethren,
and friends wanted within the City, and they had enough; They said one to
another, we do not well, this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our
peace, if we tarry until the morning light, some mischief will come unto us;
now therefore come that we may go and tell the Kings household, 2 Kings 7.9. From
whence we may note, that it is not good for those who have been made partakers
of mercy, to hide it from their Brethren, but to declare it, that they may be
partakers with them; and therefore I having in my mind purposed to compose a
brief Concordance for private use, but showing some of the Copy unto several
Friends of mine, they solicited and encouraged me not to let it lie hid, but to
have it Printed for others use as well as mine; and indeed considering some
other Reasons, which are as follow, induced me unto it; 1. Because the great
Concordances are so volumnious, that they tire the Reader. 2. Men cannot carry
them about them. 3. The price is so great, that hundreds of People cannot
attain them. 4. They at the best, do but direct to find the Word, not the sense
of the Word, which many do not understand; but in this little Treatise, you
have both the way to find the choicest Words, and the sense of the chiefest
Heads besides, which shall afterward be showed; And therefore whoever thou art,
that read this Book, and art profited by it, give the glory to him, who is
the giver of Wisdom unto all; and so I Remain,

A Well-wisher both of Soul and Body, of all those that seek the prosperity of
Zion. WILL. CHADWELL.

Directions to find the use of this CONCORDANCE.
Courteous Reader,
BE pleased to take notice, that this Concordance, though but small, contains
as much as if it were larger, I studied brevity, I could have made it larger,
but for those reasons before showed, I abridged it, and yet nothing which is
very useful is left out neither; for whereas many Concordances, are stored with
many Words which are not needful, as for example, the word Aaron, David, and
Saul, and abundance more which are not so needful as others; and likewise those
words which are useful, are so clouded with impertinent Scripture, which
causes those Concordances to be so large; but in this Treatise, the choifest
words are only quoted, and the choifest Scriptures to those words. Now to show
you the use of this Concordance, it is as follows; the Book is placed
Alphabetical, as A. B. C. D. E. and the like; now if you would find any word of
note, mind the first and second Letter in the word, and then look on the top of
the page, and when you see those two Letters, there you may then soon have your
desire; as for example, if you would find the word Baptism, or Barren, or any
word which begins with B A, look in the second Letter of the Book, on the top
of that page where you see B A, you will soon have your desire; if you would
have the word Blind, or Blood, then look B L, and so of all the rest; if you
would consider something about the Fear of God, then look in F, for F E; if you
desire the word Faith, then look F A; or if you would find Repentance, look in
R, for R E; or if you would find Watching, or Waiting upon God, then look in W,
for W A; if you would find Wisdom, then look W I, and so of all the rest; and
although there is not a Line to every Scripture, with the word at length, which
would have made the Book volumnious, yet there is such divisions, that you may
find the sense of any Scriptures in short time; Thus leaving the Reader, who
faithfully improves the Talent given him, unto the blessing of God; and the
Book, unto the rugged waves of men's censures; I remain.

A Friend to all so far as they are the Truths, Will. Chadwell.

Romans 2.16. 2. Cor. 2.15, 16.

2 They shall be as Justices of peace on the Bench, and consent to Christ's
Judgment.

Object. The Saints shall Judge the world; 1 Cor. 6.2.

Answ. As assessors with Christ bearing witness to it, approving it, and
assenting to it as the Apostles before.

2 As they are members of Christ the Judge.

3 As their example of life and conversation shall be alleged to condemn the
wicked; Jer. 35.16. Luke 11.32. Heb. 11.7.

Of Justification.
The first thing to he noted is this; that the whole world, was guilty before
God, and in an uniustifiable estate; Romans 3.19. Gal. 3.22. Rom: 11:32.

2. Justification, is by the free grace of God, and in his love to mankind;
Romans 3.24. Tit. 3.7. Rom: 8:33.

And as justification, is by the free grace of God, so it is through the death
and resurection of Jesus Christ; Isa: 53:11. Rom: 3.24. Rom: 4:25. Rom: 5:9.

Justification, is in having the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and so
made ours by imputation; Jerem: 23:6. Rom: 5:18, 19. 1 Cor: 1:30. 2 Cor: 5:21.
Phil: 3:9.

In the 4th Place, as justification is by the free grace of God, through the
death of Christ, and by his Rightousnesse being imputed to us, yet the
application of this justification to any people, is by faith and obedience to
God and Christ; Acts 26:20. Rom: 1:17. Gal: 3:8. Rom: 3:30. Gal: 2:16. Jam:
2:24. Ephesians: 2:10. Rom: 5:1.

Object. Rom: 4:5.11:6.

But to him that works not, but beleiveth, his faith is counted for
righteousness; from whence some argue, that if they believe, it is enough, for
the Apostle beats down works say some, as not necessary to Justification.

Answ. The Apostle in these and other Scriptures, speaks against the works of
the law which are abolished by the coming of Christ; Rom: 9:32.10:4. Gal:
2:16.3.11.

Answ. 2. None are justified for their works, lest any man should boast and
say, they shall be justified for their works; Ephe: 2:9. For all must
acknowledge it to be the gift of God given freely; Ephesians 2:8. Tit: 3.5.

Object. David says, Psalm: 143:2. in Gods sight no man living shall be
justified.

Answ. That is no man by his own ways, or his own righteousness, or
worthiness, Phil: 3:9. But in the righteousness of the Lord, shall all the
spiritual seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory, Isa: 45:25.

K
Of Keeping the Words, Statutes, and Commandments of God.
It is the duty of all Men; Genesis 18:19. Deuteronomy. 26:16. Eccles. 12.13. Luke 8:15.
2 Timothy 1:14. Jude 21. Acts 16:4.

Reasons Why.
Circumcision, nor uncircumcision availes any thing, but Keeping the commands
of God; 1 Cor. 7:19.

It shows forth wisdom in men so to do; Deuteronomy. 4:6.

It shows men love God by keeping his commands; John 14:15. 1 John 2:5.5.3.

If we keep Gods commands, God dwells in us, and we in him; 1 John 3:24.

Thereby men keep in the love of God; John 15:10.

Who so keeps Gods commands shall feel no evil thing; Exodus 15:26. Eccles.
8:5.

God is merciful to such; Deuteronomy. 7:9. Psalm. 103:18.

2 Cor. 11.14. 1 These: 5:5.

2 Cor. 4:4. 2 Timothy 1:10: 2 Pet: 1:19.

Arguments to prove the Scriptures to be a light to walk by.
1. All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light, for whatsoever
does make manifest is light; Ephesians. 5:13.

But the Scriptures has in former ages, and now does reprove, and convince
persons of Sin; ergo it is a light; Acts 8.32, 35. Luke 24.32. Acts 17.11, 12.
Romans 7.7. Acts 18.28. 2 Timothy 3.16.

Jesus Christ did never bid any man continue still in darkness, but told him
the way to attain true light; John 8.12.

But Jesus Christ did bid persons search the Scriptures upon the account
aforesaid.

Therefore the Scriptures are a light for men to square their life by; Mat.
22.29. Luke 10.26. John 5.35.

3. If persons that speak not according to the law and testimony, which is the
Scriptures, have no light in them, then the law and testimony which is the
Scriptures is a light.

But persons that speak not according to the law and Testimony, which is the
Scriptures, have no light in them; Isa. 8.19, 20.

Therefore the law and testimony, which is the Scriptures; is a light.

The Lord is long suffering; Exodus 34.6. Numb. 14.18. Psalm. 86.15. Jer. 15.15.
1 Pet. 3.20.

Why the Lord is long suffering; Romans 2.4. 2 Pet. 3.9. Revel. 2.21.

for us; Romans 5.8. Ephesians. 5.25, 26. 1 John 3.16. 1 John 4.9.

His love is manifested in quickening us by his grace, who were dead in
Trespasses and sins; Ephesians. 2 4.

Now if Christ be preached, that he rose from the dead, how say some among you,
that there is no Resurrection of the dead; 1 Cor. 15.12.

Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a
better Resurrection; Heb. 11.35.

And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own
power; 1 Cor. 6.14.

All shall be raised, both the just and the unjust.
And many which sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake, some to
everlasting life, and some to shame, and everlasting contempt; Dan. 12.2.

And before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate one from
another, as a Shepherd devideth his sheep from the Goats; Mat. 25.32.

Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the
graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good
unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation; John 5.28, 29.

And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall
be a Resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust; Acts 24.15.

And the Sea gave up the dead which were in it, and Death and Hell delivered up
the dead which were in them, and they were judged every man according to their
works; Revel. 20.13.

But some man will say, how are the dead raised, and with what body do they
come; 1 Cor. 15.35.

Answ. The same body which men have here in this world, only they shall be
changed.

Though worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall
see for my self, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another, though my reins
be consumed within me; Job 19.26, 27.

Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices, my flesh also shall rest
in hope, for thou will not leave my soul in Hell; Psalm. 16.9, 10.

So also is the Resurrection of the dead, it is sown in weakness, it is raised
in power, it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; 1 Cor.
15.42, 43, 44.

The reasons why the same body of flesh, shall rise again.
That every one may receive the things done in his body, that the same body may
receive joy or punishment and not another body, according to the works done in
the flesh, whether they be good or bad; 2 Cor. 5.10.

It would be rediculous that any other body should be crowned, then that which
suffered, or punished, then that same body which sinned.

Object. Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; 1 Cor. 15.50.

Answ. By flesh and blood, is not meant simply of the body, but as it is
clothed with sin, which is in Scripture called flesh, and indeed none living
and dying, in that estate, can inherit Gods Kingdom; John 3.5, 6. Romans 8.13.
Gal. 5.19, 21. Ephesians. 2.3. Gal. 6.8. Col. 2.11.

The order of the Resurrection.
The Saints shall rise first, but every man in his own order; Christ the first
fruits, afterward they that are Christ's at his coming; 1 Cor. 15.23.

For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shoute with the voice of
the Archangel, and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
first, 1 These. 4.16.

And I saw Thrones, and they sat on them, and Judgment was given unto them;
and I saw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and
for the word of God -- And they lived and reigned with Christ 1000 years.

But the rest of the Dead lived not again, until the 1000 years were finished;
This is the first Resurrection; Revel. 20.4, 5.

Lastly, this Resurrection will be at the last day, at the personal appearing
of Christ.

Whose eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will
raise him up at the last day; John 6.54.

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last Trump; for the trumpet
shall sound and the Dead shall be raised; 1 Cor 15.52.

For if we believe that Jesus dyed and rose again, even so them also, which
sleep in Jesus will God bring with him; 1 These. 4.14.

1. The divine Revelations with which they were graced from Heaven, for God was

4 The conversion of the souls of men, and women, by the power of God in the
Scripture; Acts 8.35, 36. Acts 17 11, 12.18.28.

5 The comfort the godly find in them, in all their troubles and afflictions,

6 The miraculous calling of the men, as we may see in Moses and the Apostles,
who wrote the Scriptures

7 The internal testimony of it, is the the witness of Gods Spirit, who in the
hearts of the Godly does avouch so much, and this is a Testimony proper to the
household of God.

8 The Scriptures harmony is another Testimony to confirm this truth, it being
written in so many ages of the world, so many hundreds of years at a distance,
and written by so many several men, and yet to hold such a harmony without
contradiction, clearly argues it to be given forth by one spirit, although in
such variety of times; 2 Pet: 1:21.

Of Sin.

Sin is the transgression of Gods law; Romans 4.15. 1 Cor. 15.56. 1 John. 3.4.

All unrighteousness is Sin; 1 John 5.17. Job. 1.5. Prove. 10.19.

The thought of foolishness is sin; Pro. 24.9.

The Degrees of Sin.
The first beginning of Sin is by beholding any object of vanity which pleases
the flesh, and so by being enticed thereby through the pleasantness of it, they
embrace it, though it be never so contrary to the mind of God; Ger. 3.6. Josh.
7.21. 2 Samuel 11.2, 4. Jam. 1.15.

The 2d degree of Sin, is when persons do not only embrace one opportunity, or
so by being overtaken, or through strong temptation, though that be too much,
but come to delight and glory in Sin; Prove. 1:22. Isa. 66:3. Prove. 2:14. Jer.
11.15. Prove. 10:23. Ezekiel. 16:34. Prove. 14:9. Isa. 22:13. Phil: 3:19. Arn. 6:13.
Romans 1.32.

The 3d. degree of Sin is hardness of heart, that is, when persons set their
whole heart and mind on iniquity, and worldly things, not considering, nor
laying to heart Gods mercies nor the latter end of those wicked ways; Isa.
5:18. Hosea 4:8, 11. Isa. 42:24, 25. Ezekiel. 24:25. Hosea 7:6. Isa. 47:7. Mal.
2.2. Isa. 57:11. Mark 3:5. Romans 2:5.

The 4. and last degree of Sin, is impenitency, that is when Persons will not
reverence God, nor receive correction from him fortheir own good, neither will
they receive instruction from him, nor from his Messengers, but refuse to
hearken, and wilfuly reject Gods gracious invitations, yea and make their
hearts like unto an Adamant Rock; 2 Chronicles. 36:15.16. Isa. 9:13.26:10. Jer. 5:3.
Isa. 28:12. Jer. 2:30. Ezekiel. 24:13. Isa. 30:15, 16. Jer. 22:21. Zech. 7:11, 12.

Of Gods Will.
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is;
Ephesians. 5:17.

What Gods will is.
It is Gods will all should come to Repentance and be saved; Ezekiel: 33:11. Mat:
18:14. 1 Timothy: 2:4. 2 Pet: 3:9.

It is Gods will that every true believer in Christ, should have evelasting
life; Joh. 6.40.

It is his will that Christ should raise them up all at the Last day; John 6:39.

It is Gods will persons should live a godly holy life, and not according to
the lusts of the flesh; Joh. 1:13. 1 These: 4:3.

Rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing, in every thing give thanks, for this
is the will of God in Christ Jesus, concerning you; 1 These. 5:16, 17, 18.

It is the will of God that with well doing by a holy conversation, we put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men; 1 Pet. 2:15.

It is Gods will, that his people should not be conformable to this world, nor
the things thereof, but transformed, that is to say, changed, or out of love
with it; Romans 12:2. 1 John 2:15.

The Reasons why persons must be obedient to Gods will.
1. Because Christ came to suffer and to perform all the will of God for our
sakes; John 4:34.5:30. Gal: 1:4. Heb. 10:7. 1 Pet. 4:1, 2.

2. Because the Apostles prayed fervently for the Saints completing in all the
will of God; Col. 1:9.4:12. Heb 13:21.

3. Because they are exhorted to it; Romans 12:1, 2.

4. Because not every one that says Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven, but he that does the will of our Father which is in Heaven; Mat.
7:21.

5. Because such who know the will of God and do it not, shall be beaten with
many stripes; Luke 12:47. Romans 2:18, 23.

Encouragements to those who live in obedience to the will of God.
They are Gods sons and daughters; John 1:12, 13. Mat. 12:50.

They who do the will of God, shall be of a discerning spirit, to know Gods
Doctrine from any others; John 7:17.

God will hear the prayers of such; John 9:31.

The world passes away, and the lust thereof, but he that does the will of God
abides for ever; 1 John 2:17.

Such have a strong plea, to resign the keeping of their souls to God, 1 Pet:
4:19.

The promises of God belong to those who do the will of God; Heb: 10:36.
