The Kings Speech to his Soldiers.
Gentlemen,
YOu are called Cavaliers and Royalists, in a disgraceful manner: If I suffer
in my fame, needs must you do also. Now express your selves my friends and
not malignants, fight for your King, the peace of the Kingdom and the
Protestant Religion; It is not so great an honor to keep the white candor of

the Protestane Religion, and by me intended to the same purpose, does express
a secret distrust of reality in my Royal intentions. You are called Cavaliers
in a reproachful signification, and year all designed for the slaughter if
you do not manfully behave your selves in this Battle: They call all the Kings
Troopers Cavaliers; but let them now know that the valor of the Cavaliers has
honored that name both in France and other Countries, and now let it be known
in England as well as Horseman or Trooper, it signifying no more but a
Gentleman serving his King on horseback, show your selves therefore now
courageous Cavaliers, and beat back all opprobrious speeches and aspersions
cast upon you by the Enemy. Let them know and discern that for your King you
dare adventure your selves, and for the eternal reward of a just acquired
honor.
