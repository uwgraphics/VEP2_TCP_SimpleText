A Remark upon the Baths, In the City of Bath in Somersetshire.
With a Word of Tender Caution and Admonition to the Inhabitants thereof.
I Have traveled far and near,
this Nation up and down;
I Have loved to see and hear,
God's Works of great renown.
Wonderfully indeed
they set forth his great Power,
To which we must take heed,
and fear him every hour.
Earth's Book that is here below
does set forth God's great Power;
Most glorious Works does show
unto this very hour.
And herein stands our Bliss,
to serve the living Lord;
And that Man blessed is,
whose Deeds with it accord.
Though I have great things seen,
the Baths I must admire;
Hot Waters there have been,
and still are, without Fire.
Some wise Men there have sought,
this Mystery to find out,
Their labor is at naught,
they leave off with a doubt.
This wonder makes me pause,
my Thoughts have gone about:
Here Is Supernatural Cause,
to me it is beyond doubt.
The Effects thereof declare
the Cause, that it is so;
The works of it are rare,
Lame whole away do go.
Diseased of many a place
come here to find relief;
It yields in many a case,
and takes away their grief.
The Cripple, with his Crutch,
comes limping to this place;
The Virtue of it is such,
he is healed, and goes a-pace.
Crutches advanced are,
as I did plainly see,
To show Bath's Virtue rare,
O let God honored be!
As for Bethesda's Pool,
it differed in Nature;
For doubtless that was cool,
but these are still hot Water.
Now may I speak to you
in Meekness and in Love,
The Counsel given's true,
may it effectual prove.
Inhabitants of Bath,
I have to you Good Will,
And truly wish you Faith,
God's Mercies do you fill.
Do ye submit to him,
who is your great Creator,
Whose Mercies great are seen
in this your Virtuous Water.
Come, hark to me a while,
for my intent is good,
There Is no such place in the Isle,
whose Springs yield so much Food.
For by your Virtuous Springs,
I easily may suppose,
Given by the King of Kings,
you have both Meat, Drink and Clothes,
Let Love of God therefore
for evermore take place;
Sin, Vanity give over,
for it does you disgrace.
Be cautioned in time,
for God hates all such things:
Repent of every Crime,
lest Virtue leave your Springs.
I pray you Serious be,
and fear the Living God;
For you I show how He
may visit with his Rod.
But as you heed do take,
to his Divine Appearance,
Of which the Scripture speak
with a most plain Coherance.
Then may ye Fruits bring forth,
which Mercy may engage,
And him who has and does,
may bless you in your Age.
I pray this Caution take,
as given in true Love,
So may God's Mercy make
you Joyful from above.
And thus, when Health shall end,
and this Life cease to be,
The Lord may be your Friend
to all Eternity.
