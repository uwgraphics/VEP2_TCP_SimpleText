CAUSES Of a Solemn National Fastand Humiliation, agreed upon by the
Commissioners of the late General Assembly, met at Edinburgh the 4. of June
1696: And presented to the Lords of His Majesty's most Honorable Privy
Council, To be read by the Ministers, in all the Churches at the Intimation of
the said Fast.
THE KING'S MAJESTY, being gone Abroad, and Engaged in a Dangerous War, and His
ROYAL PERSON exposed to Danger, on whose Safety and Success under GOD, the
Welfare of these Nations, and of the Churches of GOD, both at Home and Abroad*
much depends: It is Our Judgment, that there is great need of pouring out
fervent Prayer, and Supplications to GOD, for the Preservation of His
MAJESTY'S PERSON, and for Directing His Councils, and Blessing the Forces of
His MAJESTY, and His ALLIES by Sea and Land with Success; and in Order to Our
Acceptance with GOD, It is Our Duty to join Fasting and Humiliation and
Reformation, with Our Prayers, and to be Humbled, and Lament bitterly before
the LORD, That though there have been for some Years past, diverse solemn National
Fasts, and in some of them, a Particular Enumeration of the Nations Sins, yet
few have been duly Humbled for these Sins, and few have joined suitable
Reformation, with their professed Humiliation; and that notwithstanding of all
the Great Things, GOD has wrought for Us, and the shaking of his terrible
Judgments of the Sword of a cruel Enemy, and Arrow of Famine, Yet few have
turned from the Evil of their Ways unto GOD, or sought him with all their
Heart, We have been unthankful for Our Deliverance* many have been angry at, or
murmr under it, the Gospel has little success, yea by many is much
contemned, Iniquity abounds in City and Country, and in the Army, and while
some are in great Straits, others abuse their Plenty to Excess and Riot and
Lasciviousness, and by frequent Murders Blood touches Blood, Animosities and
Divisions continue, and these contrary to the many Obligations We ly under from
GOD, and have taken on Us to GOD, and under all this Sin and Danger, there is a
woeful Security among Us.

For these and other Sins this Nation has Cause, By Solemn Fasting, to humble
Themselves before the LORD, And to Repent and Reform, And to pour out Fervent
Prayers to GOD, That He would give Repentance to all Ranks of Persons, and
Forgive Our Sins, and Avert Deserved Wrath, And would Bless the Gospel with
Success, Remove Iniquity from among Us, And Advance the Life and Power of
Godliness, Heal Our Breach^s, Unite Us more to GOD, and one another in Him,
That GOD, would Preserve, and Bless the KING, and Cover his Head in Danger, and
go out with his Forces, and these of his ALLIES, And Bless them with Success,
against the Common-Enemy, And in due time give a Comfortable well Grounded
Peace.

We ought likewayes with Cordial Symphathy to pray for all the Reformed
Churches of CHRIST, and in a special manner for our afflicted Brethren of the
French and other Churches, whom the French King has grievously persecuted and
Scattered.

We ought also to pray That GOD would Pity and provide for the Poor in this
present Dearth, and that he would alwise Bless the Land with seasonable
weather, that there may be a plentiful Crop, and joyful Harvest, that the Poor
may be satisfied with Bread.

And the said Commissioners do* Beseech and Exhort all both Pastors and People
to be Sincere and Serious in this Great Work, and who can tell, but the LORD
will be Gracious, and avert deserved Wrath, and turn his Hand against Our
Enemies, and yet delight to dwell among us, and do us Good.
