A Proclamation for the better Defense of the Kings Royal Person, and of this
University and City.
WHEREAS by Our Proclamation of the 28 of April past, taking notice of the
desires of the Lords and Commons of Parliament here Assembled, We did straightly
Charge and Command all Persons whatsoever residing in this University and City
speedily to List themselves in the Regiment of Auxiliaries under the Command of
the Earl of Dover, which is upon no occasion to March out of this City upon
service, otherwise then upon Sallyes in case of a Siege, nor to do duties
therein, except in case of a Siege, or other extraordinary occasion; And
whereas We have since given a like Commission to the Lord Littleton, Keeper of
Our Great Seal, to raise one other Regiment of Auxiliaries to consist of
Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, and others appertaining to the Law:
Notwithstanding which We find that many Persons have not, nor do not (as We
are informed) intend to List themselves at all in any of the said Regiments, or
any others here in Garrison, to the manifest prejudice of Our service, and
neglect of their duties for the preservation of this University and City.
Wherefore We have thought fit, by the advice of Our Council of War, again
straightly to charge and Command all persons whatsoever (not already listed)
(except such as are already Officers or Soldiers in some other Regiment of Our
Army, and except the Members of both Houses of Parliament, the Gentlemen of Our
Troop, Our Meniall Servants, and the Servants of Our Dearest Son Prince
Charles, Our Commissioners, such as have entered into holy Orders, or such as
for age, or some infirmity are not of ability to bear Arms) to List
themselves in the City Regiment, or in one of the said Regiments of
Auxiliaries, before the 27 of this instant May, or else to depart the City, as
Persons unfit to reside here, or to have the benefit of Our Protection. And if
any shall be found after that time (not being excepted) who have not Listed
themselves, We do Command the Governor to cause such to be forthwith
apprehended and proceeded against, as Persons disaffected to Our service and
the good and security of this City. And We do farther straightly Command all the
Inhabitants of this City able to bear Arms, with their servants, to List
themselves in the City Regiment, and to arm themselves accordingly before the
said 27 of May, upon pain of being severely proceeded against for their
neglect, which We require as well the Governor, as the Colonel and other
Officers of the said City Regiment in their respective Charges to see straightly
obeyed; and to the end that no Person who shall reside here may be exempt, We
shall take some speedy course that those of Our servants, and of Our Dearest
Son the Prince, whose attendances are not immediately required, shall be
Listed under such Commands, as that upon all occasions they may be ready for
the defense of this City. And that We may find the effects hereof, Our express
pleasure is, That the City Regiment, and both the Regiments of Auxiliaries
appear before Us in Arms upon Tuesday next in the morning in the New Parkes,
where We intend to view them and their numbers. This Our Pleasure We Command
shall instantly be published in this City and University, to the end it may, be
observed accordingly.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the 24th day of May, in the Twentieth year of
Our Reign. 1644.
