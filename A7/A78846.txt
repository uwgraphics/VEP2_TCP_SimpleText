HIS MAJESTY'S LATE PROTESTATION Before His Receiving of the Sacrament.
His MAJESTY being to receive the Sacrament from the hands of the Archbishop
of Armagh, used these public expressions, immediately before the blessed
Elements; He rose up from His knees, and beckning to Bishop Usher for a short
forbearance, made this Protestation.

MY Lord, I epsy here many resolved Protestants, who may declare to the World,
the resolution I do now make. I have to the utmost of my power prepared my
soul to become a Worthy Receiver: And may I so receive comfort by the blessed
Sacrament, as I do intend the establishment of the true Reformed Protestant
Religion, as it stood in its beauty, in the happy days of Queen Elizabeth,
without any connivance of Popery. I bless God, in the midst of the public
Distractions, I have still Liberty to Communicate; And may this Sacrament be my
Damnation, if My Heart do not join with my Lips in this Protestation.

Printed in the Year of our Lord, 1643.
