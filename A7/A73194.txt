A pleasant new Song of a iouiall Tinker.
To a pleasant new tune, called, Fly Brass.


There was a iouiall Tinker
dwelt in the town of Thurbie,
And he could mende a Kettle well,
but his humors were but scuruie.
Yet still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke, tincke,
Tara ra ring tincke, tincke,
Room for a jolly drinker:
He would stop one hole, and make two,
was not this a iouiall Tinker.
He was as good a fellow
as Smugge, which made much laughter:
Full little would you think that in his drink,
he would beat both his Wife and Daughter.
Yet still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke, tincke,
Tara ra ring tincke, tincke,
Room for a lusty drinker:
He would stop one hole, and make two,
was not this a iouiall Tinker.
He walked about the Country
with Pike-staffe and with Budget:
Full little would ye wat, when he was drunk as a Rat,
how trimly he would trudge it.
Yet still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke, tincke,
^^ra ra ring tincke, tincke,
Rome for a lusty drinker:
^e would stop one hole, and make two,
was not this a iouiall Tinker.
There Is none of his profession,
was ere so skilled in Mettle:
For he could mende your Drying Pan,
your Skellet, and your Kettle.
Yet still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke, tincke,
Tara ra tincke, tincke,
Room for a lusty drinker:
He would stop one hole and make two,
was not this a iouiall Tinker,
He Would toss the jolly Tankard,
the Blacke-pot, and the Pitcher:
No Ale or Beer for him was dear,
to make his Nose the ritcher.
Yet still would he cry
Tincke, tincke-etc.
He walked to Fayres and Markets,
to furnish his red Nose:
And when he was drunk, would beat his Punck
and make her pawn her Clothes.
Yet still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke, etc.
Who was it durst molest him:
his Brass did him inuiron;
Sargeants arrest, yet he was blessed,
for he was bayld with Iron.
Yet still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke, tincke. etc.
FINIS.
The Second Part of the iouiall Tinker.
To the same tune.




ANd now this jolly Tinker,
the Country has forsaken,
And with his Pack upon his back,
(to see what may be taken)
In London he cries
Tincke, tincke, tincke,
Tara ra ring tincke, tincke:
Room for a jolly drinker,
He can stop one hole, and make two,
is not this a iouiall Tinker.
But first about the City,
this lusty man of Mettle,
Does cry and call to stop a hole,
and Skellet, Pan, or Kettle.
And still would he cry
Tincke, tincke, tincke,
Tara ra ring. etc.
In The Strand I saw him tincking;
when straight his eyes he raised,
The new Exchange to him was strange,
on which he stood and gazed.
Then up he went,
with tincke, etc.
One questioned why he did so*
he said, to keep them waking,
Least they should sleep who shops did keep,
they had so little taking.
And then away, with
Tincke, etc.
And as he went down Fleet-streete,
a Lawyer was offended,
That he should cry so loud and hie,
to have old Kettles mended,
Yet still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke. etc.
To him this Tinker thus replies,
I do but ply my calling:
And you (said he) some time (like me)
will keep as bad a bawling.
And still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke. etc.
And still this man of Thurbie,
that in his trade was grounded:
As he did pass from place to place,
his Kettle-drum he sounded.
For still would he cry,
Tincke, tincke. etc.
In Cheapside then full lightly,
he beat upon his Kettle:
Where when the Gold he did behold,
he wished it had been such mettle.
And nimbly he cries
Tincke, tincke. etc.
Then meets he with the Sow-gelder,
the blows his Horn so finely,
(That all about does cry, Look out,)
and him he greetes full kindly.
Together then, with
Tincke, tincke, tincke,
Tara ra ring tincke, tincke,
What work here, cries the Tinker:
The Sow-gelder looked out, looked out,
who was as sound a drinker.
Then to an Alehouse hie they,
their iouiall humors keeping:
Where tincke, tincke, tincke, fell hard to drink,
and there I left him sleeping.
And when he awakt,
Tincke, tincke, tincke. etc.
FINIS.
