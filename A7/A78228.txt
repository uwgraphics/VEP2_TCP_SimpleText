The Case of the Ancient TENANTS of the late Deane and Chapters of Durham.
THat they held their respective Tenements by Lease, from twenty one years to
twenty one years for ever, at a fine certain, different from most Tenants in
other Deanaryes.

That in consideration thereof, It was ordered by the honorable Committee for
removing obstructions, etc. 17. October 1649.

That in their respective purchases, an abatement or reprize should be made
valuably, proportionable to their way of holding; And afterward it was
resolved, that the same should be reported to the House.

It is therefore prayed by the Petition of Capt. John Shaw, and others in
behalf of the said Tenants.

That a Reprize may be ordered of some certain part of their purchasemoney, or
that they may be admitted to make their second payments out of the one hundred
and 20 thousand pounds, to be advanced by way of doubling.

For these reasons,

1. In consideration of their case so just and equitable, and so much different
from the Tenants of other Denearies. 2. Of the poverty, and great pressures,
by the daily march and quartering of Armies much increased by their vicinitie
to Scotland. 3. For that they had no benefit of the former doubling, being some
months completed before they purchased, and therefore bought their bills for
making their first payments at very dear rates.
