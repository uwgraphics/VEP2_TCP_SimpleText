An Alarm to the City and Soldiery, God grant they may not neglect it.
Gentlemen, and fellow Soldiers,
AT this time, when our Ruin and Destruction is upon us, there is no place for
many words. The Fifth Monarchy men are Armed, Officer'd, and every way in a
Readiness, upon the word given them, to surprise and suppress the Army, to Fire
the City, and to Massacre all considerable People of all sorts, whom they
suspect averse to what they impiously designed. Feake has lately (...) them
the Alarm in Print: Sir Henry Vane is Chief in the Design, and lately said in
confidence to a Friend, This Army was any way to be suppressed; for otherwise,
they should not be permitted to sit long. The Parliaments new Militia, and
their Listings in several Counties, is in order to no other Design. If God
gives you not eyes to see the destruction that is even at your doors, or if you
see it, you want hearts and courage to prevent it, it then seems the Decree is
gone out against you. You have your Warning, and we have done our Duties.
Beware Tuesday next; we say, Beware.

June 6. 1659.
