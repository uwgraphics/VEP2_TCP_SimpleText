To the Right Honorable, THE Lady ANNE PIERPOINT Elder Daughter To the Lord
Marquisse of DORCHESTER.
MADAM,
THough your Ladyship be already in the high road of Piety and Virtue, so that
none need to show you the way; yet these following Examples of the best of
Women, and drawn out of the best Records, will not, I presume, prove
altogether superfluous; for they may confirm and encourage You in the same
road: But he who would counsel your Ladyship hereunto, must needs commend when
he counsels, and by his Exhortations, approve of your actions; so I rest,

Madam, Your Ladyships most devoted servant
ROBERT AYLETT.

The Good Woman's Prayer.

And grant that I may practice them in word and deed.

As was in Genesis 31.19
Rachel, Ruth. 1.10 and 2.12
Ruth, and 1 Sa. 4, 21
Phinees Bride;
Unto thy Word my due 7 Attention move,
As thou did Ac. 16.14
Lydiu's by the river side,
And Luk 10.41
Mary's, whose good choice and part was not denied.
Make me 9 Obey thy will with all submission,
Like 1 Ki. 17.15
Ely's Hostess, and in me create
Ge. 13 17
Leah's and 1 Sa. 1.15
Hannah's spirit of 11 Petition;
With Ex. 15.26
Miriam let me thy 10 Praise relate,

Anna, that lived four score years without a mate.
O grant that I the Church may stand in stead
By Jud. 2.25

She that Joash gave his first seven years of life.
My spiritual 14 Labors (Lord) grant the success
Of Romans 16 7. and 12
Junia, Persis, Triphose, and Triphene,
That thy elected Vessels me may bless;
Grant that my bodily dangers may be seen,
As Exo. 1.17
Egypts Midwives, Jud. 4.21
Jahel great, Est. 4.16
Ashuerus Queen.
Toward my Husband settle thou my 16 Mind,
As was Genesis 24 65.

Loving as Ge. 31.16
Rachel, Jos. 15.18
Achsah, and as kind

Dame,
Discreet as Isaacks Ge. 25.28 et 24.19
Wife let me appear,
Whose pains with Rut. 2.16
gleaning Ruth, give me the grace to bear.
Indue me with the 19 Courage to maintain
My Families right like fair Nu. 28.4
Zelopiads breed;
With Sarah wicked servants to constrain
TO amend, or else out of mine Ge. 21.10
house to weed
Profane, proud Hagar, with her scoffing Saracens seed
Grant me Luke 1.6
Elizabeth's 20 unreproved Life,
The seasoned 21 Speech of 2 Kin. 5.3
Naamans wife and maid
Genesis 3.10 and 4.25
Eve's 22 Happiness; who for lost Abels life
Was with the birth of Holy Seth repaid,
My 24 days like Ge. 23.1
Sarahs! worth the numbering may be said.
Apochriphal are the Stories, not the Life
Of Valiant Judith and Susanna chaste;
2 Mac. 7.1
Mother of martyrs seven, young Tobi's wife.
Two 2 Macca. 6.10
women with their babes down headlong cast
God make me not the least, although of these the last.
But since these stars have had their slower motions
Preserve me, from their errors and commotions.
A Good Woman's Prayer.

enticing, Setting my heart on 11 Envy, 12 Pomp, 13 Promotions, My heart in to

Dissimulation, all 17 ambitious Commotions.

O Lord the God of Love, which do not love
Self-love 1, where by man does himself misprise,
Created in thine image from above;
Humble me, lest I seek to equallize
Thy Natures 2 Dignity, as Judt. 6.
Angels did devise.
Or like Dan. 3.7
Nebuchadnezzar, for to gain
The 3 Worship that to thee is only due,
As Hest. 3.2
Haman and Dan. 6.7
Darius, Act. 12.13
Herod's train;
Or of thy mighty 4 Power to make false show,
As 2 Timothy 3.8
James, Jambres, Esa. 14.14
Belshazzer and Act. 8.10
Magus crew.
Inspire me, lest thy 5 Justice I despise
As King 2 Ki. 6.33

Jeroboam durst;
Genesis 4.24
Lamech, 2 K. 19.12
Sennacherib: Or thy 6 Promise,
As Ge. 25.33
Esau, and young Genesis 21.9

Lest thy 7 Commandment I disobey,
Like Genesis 11.4
Nimrod, Genesis 38.9
Onan, Exodus 5.7
Pharoh, bloody Ge. 46.8
Cain;
Or due and just 8 Reproofs do cast away,
As 2 Samuel 3.7
Abner when he had with Rispa lain,
The Lu. 16.14
Pharisees, and Ioh. 12.5
Judas that has Christ betrain.
Neither thy 9 Prophets slightly entertain,
As men of the old Ma. 24.38
World drowned in the flood;
Genesis 9.22
Cham, 1 Ki. 22.26
Ahab, Matthew. 27 46.
Pharisees, two 2 Kin. 1.9
Captains slain,
With the devoured Bethels 2 Ki. 2.23
mocking brood,
King Amo. 7.10
Amaziah, Lu. 23.11
Herod in his scoffing mood.
Turn me from Job. 7.49

Absalom, and all
The vain superfluous pride in Hest. 1.3
Ahashueros Hall
From motions all of Pride do thou me save,
Even such as thy deer children set on fire;
As Genesis 3 6
Adam 14 Knowledge only sought to have,
And 2 Co. 12.7
Paul, who did enjoy his own desire;
Or Nu. 11.29
Joshua, who for envy did thereof enquire.
Let no 15 Advancement (Lord) my heart lift up
As 2 Sa. 24.1
David's, when he would the people number;
Or 2 Chr. 32 25.
Ezekiah when God filled his cup;
As Mat. 20.21
James and John, styled the Sons of Thunder,
Whose mother did desire to keep the Apostles under.
At which the Matthew. 20 24
Ten were moved with 17 Indignation,
As sons of Jacob, that their brother sold,
Were moved Act. 7.9
with envy at his divination:
And Nu. 12.1
Aaron that with Moses sought to scold.
Me as I am, not worse nor 16 better let men hold.
