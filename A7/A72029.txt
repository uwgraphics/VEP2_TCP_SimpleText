To all that affect the famous exercise of ARCHERIE frequenting Finsburie
fields.
SHooting in the long bow being of it self very laudable, and our English
nation in all ages surpassing therein all others, yea neither the Getes,
Seythes, Parthians, Sarmathians, Armiaspes famous for that quality, nor any
other people could become equal with English Archers. And yet (a matter to be
lamented) this laudable exercise of late days has become cold in most places
of this land, famous London retaining the most arde^t desire to maintain the
same, as appears by the daily concourse of Citizens, to their great
commendations, in diverse companies in the convenient fields about the city,
but most especially in that choice place Finsburie, most especially garnished
with many beautiful Marks in this little Treatise Alphabetically mentioned,
whereby the benefactors therein shall have perpetual memory recorded by the
titles of their several erections.

And for that every hand ought to bring some portion of help toward the
preservation and increase of so commendable actiuitie, we have (by the help of
our friends) cast in also our mite, wishing it to work a continuing in the
old, and a growing goodwill in such young beginners as would become skillful in
this most acceptable quality, for whose sakes this little work is reuiewed,
revived and republished, with such necessary, easy, and helpful observations
as may seem best to satisfy those that are desirous to come to knowledge in
the Marks.

Rules touching the use of the Treatise.
1 First, you must note, that sundry Marks have two or three words for their
names, look for the mark always in the first word, as in the Kings Mace,
look not for Mace but for Kings: also the House of Lancaster, look for House
not for Lancaster, and so in the rest.

2 And it is further to be noted, that the first number shows the scores, the
second the yards: you must shoot long aim, because this is set down by
measure of the line

3 Again you must note, that we have set down the marks to be taken all
going into the fields, and if you be coming homeward, look for the mark you
shoot at, and not for the mark you stand at. And we have placed from every
mark all the marks from the left hand to the right, leaving out none from 9.
score to 18. or 19. score. And when a mark is found along a bank, you must
always look for the mark from the West toward the East.

4 Also for the aid of young shooters we: have set down in the end of the
book a Table of the names of all the marks, with direction in what page to
find them, for the ease of those that are unacquainted with the names of the
marks.

For the better advertisement of such as are not acquainted with the order of
the game and custom of the field, whereby often arise controversies, and
diverse times grow rash and unadvised oaths, to the derogation of Gods glory,
we have thought it good to set down such orders as are sit to be observed
in this exercise.

1 First for the finding of your mark, it must be within every man's reach.
Also the precise naming of your mark preuenteth much cavil.

2 Secondly, for whites you may have as many as you will, so they be all
forwards, and if you shoot at any loose white, and it be stricken out of
sight, it is no mark.

3 Thirdly, for the highest of stakes, if the wood be above the pin, you are to
measure at the wood, although the pin has been put in for the same purpose.

4 Fourthly, if you find a bush or a black, whatsoever you find highest in
it, being within the compass of the mark, you are to take it for the height.

5 Fifthly, for all trees you are to measure at foot and pole, except in the
naming of it you say, at the nail in such a tree, or hole in such a tree, or
being a tree of so small height, that you may reach the top of it with half
your bow, then you may take the highest.

6 Sixthly, if there be so nigh a shoot that it cannot be given by the
contrary side, or by another company, then the better of them two is to win
the shoot at the next mark, and not to let it lie dead to the advantage of
the contrary side. If in measuring of the shoot, by haste the mark is
stirred, he is to lose the shoot that measures it.

7 Seventhly, when you come to the mark and claim two, and the contrary sides
draw their arrows, and when your mate comes he says his would win too, you
are to win no more then you claim.

8 Lastly, if you name one mark and shoot at another, you are to lose your
shoot, and they are to follow at the mark named.
