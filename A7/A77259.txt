The Devils White Boys: OR, A mixture of malicious Malignants, with their
much evil, and manifold practices against the Kingdom and Parliament.

With a bottomless Sack-full of Knavery, Popery, Prelacy, Policy, Treachery,
Malignant Trumpery, Conspiracies, and Cruelties, filled to the top by the
Malignants, laid on the shoulders of Time, and now by Time emptied forth, and
powered out, to show the Truth, and shame the Devil.

allegorical depiction of Time and the Devil Time now at the last
poures out much knavery.
The Devil holds down fast
to hinder the discovery.


Malignants are the Devils Agents still,
The Sack is England, which they strive to fill
With misery and mischief, and this Sack
Full stufft, is laid upon Times aged back;
Time poures it out now in an angry mood,
That all their Knaveries may be understood.

The Devils White Boys, OR, A mixture of Malicious Malignants with their much
evil, and manifold practices against this Kingdom and Parliament.
O England! how have thou been tossed and tumbled? VV^at have thy sufferings been
since ^his war began? Atlas bears the world on his shoulders, and alas,
sin has laid sorrow on thy back, thou have been, O England a long time
nothing but a medly of confusion, of murder, p^under and Malignant wickedness,
and have like a Porter, groaned under the burden of a S^ckful of knavery, ease
now thy tired shoulders, and pour out some of them to the view of the World.
Before the beginning of this Parliament, thou were diverse ways oppressed, and
many were thy greevances which thou did suffer under great men; and how did
the Star Chamber domineere over the wronged Subject? what corruption and
Bribery was there in the Law? what buying and selling of Justice? This Lord,
and that Lord must be solicited and sued unto, even as sat as Coventry, or the
Devil of Dunsmore HEATH (now with the King) that it would please their
Lordships to take a Bribe to do a po^rs man Justice.

There was nothing but Playing, Dancing and Masking; the Commonwealth was a
tree of Pleasure, and whoring was the top branch, when the Queen Mother was
here, and it is thought, the Bishops ease and good fare, made them lusty, even
to beget Bastards, which they could do with ease in their studies; they loved
pleasure better then Preaching, and were the Hogs of our Israel, that fatted
themselves with the Acornes of Spiritual Livings; Then the Judges were the
Kings Parrets, and cried out, Ship Money, but the Subjects regarded those
Judges no more then Parrats or prating Sicophants; that with the Cobblers Crow,
were taught to cry, Ave Caesar, God save the King; Amen cried the people, and
deliver him from such malignant Judges, that would make his Prerogative a Pick
pocket; and a hand to squeese out the wealth of the Subiest, according to the
Princes pleasure, that so our King might like a foreign, whom I could name, be
Rex Assinorum, a King of English Asses, when the liberty of the Subject should
be subject to the Tyranny of his Prerogative. These devices were then set on
foot, and are now marching abroad on the Soldiers legs in the Kings army: for
what does the Kings Army fight for? but first for an universal Tyrany, or
unbounded Monarchy, that the freeborn English may submit themselv^s to Royal
slavery, in token whereof, the Scholars of Oxford not long before these wars
began, made a Play called, The Royal Slave, as if they had Prophesyed, that
all England should be turned into a company of Royal slaves, and for this the
Cavaliers fight, cut and kill the Kings Majesty's Subjects, that they may
conquer us into servitude, and (if they could) beat us out of our Name of
Subjects, into the title of slaves, but there is no doubt, we shall be able to
baffle such knaves, that being pack't together, have shuffer'd in the King
amongst them, and by their evil Counsel, have made the King like an incensed
Lion against his people and Parliament. And what mad Laws do you imagine, if
the Cavaliers were lawmakers? It should be lawful in the first place to kill
any man for his money, if it were demanded, cum privilegio, that is by virtue
of the Kings Prerogative. And the subjects should be turned into sub-jacks,
every great man should have a Monopoly to maintain his pride and luxury, the
Kings Will should be the liberty of the subject, and my Lords will, and my
Ladies will, and my Lords Secretaries will, and my Lords great Horses will must
be obeyed, so that Jack should be in Office, and every Courtiers will, even to
Will the Scullion in the Court Kitching, should be a King, if the Malignants
could have their will.

Then for Religion, we should have superstition, Organs piping, Lawnesleeves
preaching, Bulls of Basin roaring, and singing Anthems, Little young Levites
preaching Morallity instead of Divinity, and cringing and complementing in the
Pulpit; fat Benefices, and lean Sermons, Dunces that could only read Service,
and pray for fair weather, should be Country Curates, but it is no matter, this
Religion would serve the Malignants, who are half Epicures, half Papists, and
half Atheist, and a medly of mad wickedness, they and the Devil have been in
Counsel a great while, to devise a plot how to destroy all the honest
Religious Protestants in England, and the Earl of Strafford, he sits in
Counsel every day about it with Pluto, Ashteroth, and the other Infernal
Counselors, but this Devilish Counsell-Table, cannot yet, nor never shall be
able to work the ruin of the Protestants; No? yes the Cavaliers, the Irish,
and Papists in the Kings Army will do their endeavor, and with their swords
mow them down; the^es Digby, and Cottington, and a great many Lords and
Knights that are Politic Divills, that could instruct the King to undo the
Commonwealth in the times of peace, and cannot they play the Devil in the
time of war? yes, yes, no doubt, they enticed the King the head of the
Parliament from the members, only to save their own heads, and will not they
incense the King to kill his true Subjects under the title of Roundheads? Come,
believe it, they are wicked enough, how can they fail in their plotts? when
experience tells us, that Papists are full of black Invention and hellish
Plotts: what was the Gunpowder Plot, and Straffords plot; but what talk you
of Plots? The Kings Majesty will have it so, and blind men in Divinity have
the best eyes; they preach, Obey the King, and dishonor God, but as for
cruelty and cutting of throats I leave that to Prince Rupert, and will
acknowledge that there was heretofore no other purgatory but the Chancery. But
what said my Court Lady at Oxford, I love the Roman Catholic Faith, for I
would lie in bed and be religious, and confess my sins, and live in pomp
and pleasure, and know nothing but complementing in French, and praying in
Latin^, and hearing Mass, and when she did go to heaven, and v^si^e the Lady
Mary, and all the Papists that are in heaven, which are very few, for they do
not live after the rate of going to Heaven, unless bloody murders, Idolatry,
and killing of Kings be the way to Heaven.

These Malignants in my conceit are like those pictures which have a dubble
aspect, one like a man, the other like a Devil, when they are to do mischief
by flattering the King, or making the country people rise in the Kings
behalf, then they put on smooth faces, and tell them of the Kings power and
Prerogative, and that the Parliament is no Parliament, and therefore they may
figh^ against it, that the King is wronged, when indeed no body wrongs him but
his malignant Councillors, that they fight for the Protestant Religion, that
is for Popery, and to defend the Laws, that is the Law of tyrannical
slavery, which the King would impose upon his subjects, and that as the Locust
devoured the Land of Egypt, so they might swarm again and devour us as they
did in England in the times of peace, when all the Law was in the hand of the
Judge, and that hand must be filled with gold, or else no Law was to be had:
but now for cunning wickedness, which is the malignants other face, and wherein
he resembles the Devil, consider him as he was in the shape of Guido Faulx
when he went with his dark lanthorn in his hand to set fire to the Gunpowder
plot, and was taken in this Devils shape, and afterward he and his
Complotters were executed for traitors, but what a number of black malignants
are there now in this Land, being a kind of smooth-faced machivilian Devils,
some with flattering bellows blowing the coals of dissension between the King
and Parliament; then there be horned malignant Devils that will roar, swear,
domineer, use nothing but Dammees, and R^mmees, as the Cavaliers, who blaspheme
Heaven and Earth, and are ready to swear themselves a live into Hell; then
there are Irish Devils as hot as fire, and as bloody as Beelzebub, these
delight in firing of houses, in killing women and Children, in tearing the
flesh off Protestants shoulders with hot Pincers, as they did in Ireland,
together with their horrible cruelties here in England, these are cruel Irish
Devils, such as do not he idle in the Marketplace, as the Divill did upon
his Elbow, because he knew they would lie and swear fast enough there, to damn
themselves; but these Malignants are no Dormant Devils, but active and
stirring to do mischief; they proclaim his Majesty's will, and their own
counsel to be Oracles, and make the King believe that none have wit or
understanding, but his Majesty's Cavaliers, and his newborn Counselors, and
that none are so fit to make Priests and Jesuits, as the Oxford Scholars; and
that if his Majesty print but a plausible Oath, or a Proclamation, that all he
does, is for the advancement of the Protestant Religion; is Majesty may do
what he will in favor of Papists, and follow their Counsels, as long as the
Malignants can but brand the Protestants with the name of Brownist, Anabaptist,
Separatist, or Roundheads, and then the Scholars of Oxford do make Sermons
before the King of the fidelity of Papists, and how far they are to be
preferred above Puritanes and Protestants, whom they accoumpt religious
Traitors; but O King, be ruled no more by wicked Evil Counselors, but follow
the advice of Scripture wisdom; If this Counsel, or this work of the
Parliament be of men, it will come to naught, but if it be of God, ye cannot
overthrow it, least (happily) ye be found fighters against God. Behold, O King,
but the disposition of all these Ear wigs, that insinuate into your Counsels;
can dissolute lawless Cavaliers defend good Laws? Or can Papists and Atheists
fight for the true Protestant Religion, that were as strange, as for Thorns to
bear grapes, and Thistles to bear figgs, and as strange it were, that Papists
and Athiests should bear arms, to defend the Laws, the Liberty of the
Subject, and the Protestant Religion, the Devil they will; no, they fight to
errect here the Kingdom of Darkness and Popery, that spiritual ambition may
domineere flat-cap, and the four-corner'd Cap may fill the four corners of the
world full of knavery, there should be then no schism, but a constant
Lubberisme in England, Bishops, Deans, Doctors, Dunces, and Lubbers, that when
they preached (being very seldom) would, speak with a hoarse low voice, as if
two or three steeples (having plutallity of Benifices) stuck in their throat;
and when young Wives and wenches came to Confession, how the Friar (like the
Devil) would hugg them? would not this be a pretty medly of confusion; nay,
right and wrong shall be all one, fetch me such a Subjects, head, 'tother
subjects bed, and his table, nay plunder him to a Pewter spoone, if he will not
submit unto the Kings Prerogative; but banish conscience, for miters and
Bishops cannot endure him, Papists Priests can devise an easy Religion for my
Court Lady, that she may go to heaven on a bed of Roses; and never take the
pains to come thither, she is troubled with a looseness in the bottom of her
belly, and cannot sit out a long Sermon, nor make long Prayers, let her give a
few scraps at her door, and a doal of Puddings at her death, and Angels shall
carry her to Pope Iom. But let us let these she fools alone, these
shee-Papists and malignant women, that will talk themselves out of breath
against the Parliament, but if they might have their wills, to beat and cuckold
their husbands by act of Parliament, then, and not till then they would praise
the Parliament.

But Time, since thou have thus far discribed the Malignants, go on with
boldness, pour out the rest of thy Sackfull of knavery, make the Proverb
true, speak truth, and shame the Devil, who stands behind thee, pulling down
the sack, to hinder the emptying of it; but out with the trumpery, the Knavery,
the Popery, the Policy, the Malignancy, flattery, and all the close wickedness
and impiety that has been laid upon the back of Time, do it briefly, roundly
and plainly, and shake out of thy Sack, all varieties of Knavery.

Well done Time, what comes out here first? Inprimis, hundred-pound baggs of
money, and these were for Bribes for my Lords the Judges; and for Symony to
procure a Benifice for Master Dunscombe, a Levite of littell learning, and
less Conscience, whose Bribe being taken, he was admitted to the Parsonage. O
this money makes the Commonwealth a common whore, that lies down, and let
fools ride her, and deride her, while Knaves thrived, and honest men went to
wrack, and every Jack might be made a Sir John, for an hundred pounds, and to
conclude, malignant hundred pounds have sent hundred thousands to the Devil.

What comes next, Malignant pounds of Candles, made only for Polititions, to
give them light how to study Plots against the Protestants; the Bishop of
Canterbury burnt twenty pounds of these candles, in studdying how to bring in
Popery; the Earl of Strafford studdyed always by one of these malignant
Candles, till at last, the Devil puff't out both the light of his Candle, and
the light of his life both together; It is known that Diogines had a malignant
candle in his Lantern, which gave him light to see how to rail, and so
Malignants, and all wicked men have some of these Candles, Prince Rupert never
goes to bed, but the Devil lights him up a candle, that he may see to forget
to say his prayers, and that he may not see his cruel plunderings; and one of
these candles are continually burning before the Kings Majesty, which gives ^im
such a dim light, that he cannot see the way how to return unto his Parliament*

Next comes out the Papists Relics, beads, crosses, crucifixes, whips, papist
books licenced by the Bishop of Canterbury, fire and faggots, with which they
intended to have burnt the Protestants, as they did in the days of Queen Mary;
and our Queen Mary thought to have seen the like bon-fires in her days: Hold
down the mouth of thy sack, Time, what great gray thing is that come out
tumbling? Oh, it is one of the Friars that lived at Saint Jameses, fatt and full
of knavery and popery; bold, there is a Surplesse, and two pair of
Lawn-Sleeves, a hood, a cope, and the poopish Service-boke that was sent down
to the Scots, and a pair of Or^gans, and a may-poole, and the skull of the
Queen Mother, with a number of p^p^st skulls, that while they lived, were all
Traitors to the Commonwealth of England.

What Is here, Serpents? such as Cottington and the rest of the Kings evil
Counselors; and look here are Eeles, Court Eeles, that would slip into any
place of preferrment, but it is known, that thunder does break the bedds of
Eeles, and since the thunder of war began, these malignant Eeles are all run
unto the King, and do live in the fresh waters at Oxford, Bristoll, and other
puts in the West Country.

Now comes forth Lawy^rs black-boxes, poor men brought these by their sides
out of the Country to London, and returned again with nothing but penury and
papers; shake them out Time, for when these times were, the Devil and the
Lawyer were always full of business in the Term time.

What Is here? a Lions skin, with a Foxes tayl^ to it, a very good Emblem,
to show that malignant Counselors d^e make use of the Lions power, to back
their malignant plotts, and thus the King is abused by the malignants policy.

But oh horrible and monstrous, here is a hand with a sword in it, full of
hearts, that have been run through by the Sword, and upon the point of the
sword is a Crown, Oh I fear this sword does too evidently point out the King,
who has been abused by his Evil Counsello s, his Cavaliers, and the Irish
Rebels, who have run their swords through the hearts of many thousand
^rotestants, this is a bloody sight shook out of the Sack of Time.

Here are more swords, all which have been guilty of English blood, not only
their hilts, but their blades are sanguin'd over, they look red, and blush,
that friends and brothers, should with hearts of Iron, hard as their swords,
kill one another; but now comes out of the sack two bloody hands, the one
holding a sword, the other a Torch, and this does signify Prince Rupert, who
is a bloody man of his hands, and does show continual cruelty with fire and
sword, as he did at Bolton in Lane shire, and in many other places, which have
suffered under this plundering Prince.

Here comes out n^w a Box, full of Commissions to do nothing; such as the
Duke of Buckingham had when he went to relieve the Protestants in Rochell, and
Sicill, when he went Cales Voyage; and then here is another box, with the Kings
Arms upon it, and in it there is the Commission of Array, with a great many of
the Kings Protestations, together with letters from he Queen, and how the Kings
Cabbinetts of Jewels, being pawned, he has nothing left but a box fu^l of
papers not of ^oetry, but policy, and they must needs be strong l^nes, that
are writ by a King and Queen, and their strong malignants.

Now comes out tumbling together Ship Money, Coxcombes for earpet-Knights, such
as Jermyn and Endymion Porter, being new made Gentlemen, and now being
malignants, are made I know not what: here comes out Monopolies of
white-soape, rags, mary-bones, cards, tobacco, and a pattent that should
have been granted for pissing against the wall; m^nopolies and knaveties, come
out here.

W^^ts here? Oh it is the Bishop of Canterburies new book, that he sent to the
Scots, being sent to him from his Holiness of Rome, and contrived by the Pope,
but the mischief was, the bishop of Canterbury could not get a close cover for
this book, so that the Scots discovered his Popish purpose, and would rather
see it burnt, then entertain a leaf of it, to be read in their true reformed
Churches.

Hold, hold, heer' a company of eyes and ears, and tongues poured out of the
Sack of Time; why Time, will thou shame thy self, could there ever be a Time so
wicked, that the Star Chamber should endeavor to pluck out the eyes of
Religion, and to pick out the best men, to have them disgraced by cutting off
their ears nay, and by cutting out their tongues, that is, by sil^ncing Godly
Ministers in the Diocesses where the bishops reigned, this was true enough.

But what is here? Oxford Trumpery, and Knavery, Scholars flat-caps, and
square-caps, Divines gowns which the Scholars lay down, and while they drink
healths to the confusion of the Roundheads, they will cry; Lie there Divinity;
these are pretty fellows to make Popish Priests of; it is known that Aulicus is
one of these drunken fellows of All souls College; but here comes out more,
namely Christ-Church Organs, surplesses, Beads, Crosses, Halfe-Crowns coined
out of Oxford Place, Cuckolds horns made by the Cavaliers, Books of Popery, of
con^uring and all sorts of Malignant Pamphlets, long gowns, that cover the
Oxford Levites, that have little Gospel in them, with spears, gunnes and
Corslets and Helmets, which the Bishops and Scholars ware at Oxford, being
better head pieces than their own.

But oh what comes out now? the very worst of all, the bottom of bottomless
Popery and cruelty, Heads, Arms, Legs, feet, and whole quarters of men, women
and children butchered by the Rebels in Ireland, and here comes out tongs and
Pincers wherewith being heated red-hot, they did pluck the flesh from the
bodies of the Protestants; Daggers with which they stabbed the Protestants, and
let them bleed to death in their fight, Gridirons whereon they roasted
Protestants; with Halters, Clubs wherewith they knock out the brains of
Protestants, long Knives wherewith they ripped Children out of their Mothers
bellyes, and cut the throats of many thousand Protestants, Axes, wherewith they
quartered Protestants, cutting some into small pieces, but the burden of
varieties, of cruelt^es which Time has born in England and Ireland, is
insufferable, the Papists Plots and projects innumerable the Malignants malice
and policy unchangeable; the Kings heart implacable, so that it would be a
hard matter for Time to shake all Malignants out of his Sack, he is no
small-coal-man, for his sack can never be emptyed, it having no bottom, but is
as deep as the Sea of Rome, that have so many that help to fill it with
knavery, as Bishops, Malignants rotten Lords, Cavaliers, Pint-pot Preachers,
Judges, Lawyers, Country Knig^ts, Malignant Majors of Towns, Bristoll,
Cottington, Prince Robert Mauris, Lords of Cumber-land, Bath, Southampton,
Dorset, Northampton, Devenshire Bristoll, Barkshire, Hopton, Capell, with the
Lord Digby, and the Lord Devil, the grand Malignant.

FINIS.
