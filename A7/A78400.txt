CHeer up your hearts, and be not afraid,
all you that faithful served the King,
What though you long have bin dismayed,
good news I now intend to bring:
Let sorrows depart,
And cheer up your heart,
and think not on your troubles past:
Lets pray for the King,
And merrily sing,
long looked for may now come at last.
The first good news I shall unfold,
I Am sure 'twill make you all full glad,
It Is news of money I am told,
I hope it will not make you mad,
The old Cavaliers,
Shall have their arrears,
and some content for their service past.
This is truth I declare,
Then do not despair,
long looked for now will come at last.
Your sufferings long has bin it is known,
ashamed I am for to express,
Some part already has bin shown,
and yet no comfort nor redress,
But now coms the time,
Then do not repine,
for long you have not to endure:
Such want and poverty,
For your Faith and Loyalty,
long looked for now will come be sure.
In every County of the Land,
Commissioners will fit be sure,
To hear and for to understand,
what hands each Soldier can procure,
And if they have bin,
True to the King,
and for him stood still firm and fast,
Then to their deserts,
They shall have their parts,
long looked for then will come at last.
But let no turn-coats then appear,
for if they do 'twill be in vain,
Nor no dissembling Cavalier,
they must be free from any stain,
For if they be found,
They once turned round,
Then all their time they will spend in wast,
None must appear,
Then for Cavalier
but he that stood for the King to the last.
The second part,
to the same Tune.

MOre news I have to tell you here,
I hope 'twill give you all content,
Our Royal Queen they say is near,
upon the Seas she now is bent,
Her flee 's under Sail,
With a brave gallant gale,
God send them a fair and pleasant blast,
And safe with the King,
That we may all sing
long looked for now it is come at last.
The King with all his Noble train,
prepared is to go likewise,
In Royal pomp to entertain.
his Consort, and to solemnize,
That happy day,
Where in we may,
With voices loud be heard and seen,
With one accord.
Crabe all of the Lord,
to bless our gracious King and Queen.
A happy month of May we had,
when as our King to London came,
It made all faithful subjects glad,
I hope this will produce the same:
There is no fear,
But this happy year,
will make amends for many past
Content let us be,
And then we shall see,
long looked for now will come at last.
For to conclude and end my song,
some things I do desire to see,
In it I shall do none no wrong,
who faithful to the King will be,
That all may agree,
In Love and Unity,
To forgive and forget all that is past,
Next that we might,
Every one have his right,
long looked for then would come at last.
That Cavaliers may all be paid,
and Traitors too have their desert,
That have the Kingdom to decayed,
I think there is few will take their part,
I mean none but those,
That yet are our foes,
and longs to see this Kingdom wast:
But let them beware,
Of the Hangmans snare.
long looked for then may come at last,
FINIS.
