THE PSALMS OF DAVID In Meeter.
PSALM I.
THat man has perfect blessedness,
who walks not astray
In counsel of ungodly men,
nor stands in sinners way,
Nor sits in the scorners chair.
But places his delight
Upon Gods Law, and meditates
on his Law day and night.
He shall be like a tree that grows
near planted by a river,
Which in his season yields his fruit,
and his leaf fades never:
And all he does shall prosper well.
The wicked are not so:
But like they are unto the chaff
which wind drives to and fro.
In judgment therefore shall not stand
such as ungodly are,
Nor in the assembly of the just
shall wicked men appear.
For why? the way of godly men
unto the Lord is known:
Whereas the way of wicked men
shall quite be over-thrown.
PSALM. II.
Why rage the Heathen? and vain things
why do the people mind?
Kings of the earth do set themselves,
and Princes are combinde
To plot against the Lord, and his
Anointed, saying thus,
Let us asunder break their band
and cast their cords from us.
He that in Heaven sits shall laugh:
the Lord shall scorn them all:
Then shall he speak to them in wrath,
in r^^e he vex them shall.
Yet notwithstanding I have him
to be my King appointed:
And over Sion, my holy hill,
I have him King anointed.
The sure decree I will declare:
the Lord has said to me,
Thou art mine only Son, this day
I have begotten thee.
Ask of me, and for heritage
the Heathen I Will make thine,
And for possession I to thee
will give earths utmost line.
Thou shall, as with a weighty rod
of iron, break them all,
And, as a potters sheard, thou shall
them dash in pieces small.
Now therefore, Kings, be wise, be taught
ye Judges of the earth.
Serve God in fear, and see that ye
join trembling with your mirth.
Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire
ye perish from the way,
If once his wrath begin to burn.
Blessed all that on him stay.
PSALM. III. A Psalm of David when he fled from Absalom his son.
O Lord, how are my foes increased?
against me many rise.
Many say of my soul, for him
in God no succor lies.
Yet thou my shield, and glory are,
th'uplifter of my head.
I cried and from his holy hill
the Lord me answer made.
I laid me down and slept, I waked,
for God sustained me.
I will not fear though thousands ten
set round against me be.
Arise, O Lord, save me, my God;
for thou my foes have stroke
All on the che^k-bone; and the teeth
of wicked men have broke.
Salvation does appertain
unto the Lord alone:
Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore
thy people is upon.
PSALM. IV. To the chief musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.
GIve ear unto me when I call,
God of my righteousness:
Have mercy, hear my prayer, thou have
enlarged me in distress.
O ye the sons of men, how long
will ye love vanities?
How long my glory turn to shame,
and will ye follow lies?
But know that for himself, the Lord
the godly man does choose:
The Lord, when I on him do call,
to hear will not refuse.
Fear, and sin not, talk with your heart
on bed, and silent be.
Offerings present of righteousness:
and in the Lord trust ye.
O who will show us any good?
is that which many say:
But of thy countenance the light,
Lord, lift on us always.
Upon my heart bestowed by thee
more gladness I have found,
Than they, even then, when corn and wine
did most with them abound.
I will both lay me down in peace,
and quiet sleep will take:
Because thou only, me to dwell
in safety, Lord, do make.
PSALM. V. To the chief musician on Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.
GIve ear unto my words, O Lord,
my meditation weigh.
Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;
for I to thee will pray.
Lord, thou shall early hear voice;
I early will direct
My prayer to thee, and looking up
an answer will expect.
For thou art not a God that does
in wickedness delight:
Neither shall evil dwell with thee.
Nor fools stand in thy sight.
All that ill-doers are thou hat'st.
Cut'st off that liars be:
The bloody and deceitful man
abhored is by thee.
But I into thy house will come
in thine abundant grace:
And I will worship in thy fear
toward thy holy place.
Because of those mine enemies,
Lord, in thy righteousness
Do thou me lead; do thou thy way
make straight before my face.
For in their mouth there is no truth,
their inward part is ill;
Their throat's an open sepulcher,
their tongue does flatter still.
O God destroy them; let them be
by their own counsel quelled:
Them for their many sins cast out,
for they against thee rebelled.
But let all joy that trust in thee;
and still make shouting noise:
For them thou sav'st: Let all that love
thy Name, in thee rejoice.
For, Lord, unto the righteous man*
thou will thy blessing yield;
With favor thou will compass him
about, as with a shield.
PSALM. VI. To the chief musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, a Psalm of David.
LOrd in thy wrath rebuke me not,
Nor in thy hot rage chasten me.
Lord pity me, for I am weak:
Heal me, for my bones vexed be.
My soul is also vexed sore:
But, Lord, how long stay will thou make?
Return, O Lord, my soul set free:
O save me for thy mercies sake.
Because those that deceased are,
Of thee shall no remembrance have:
And who is he that will to thee
Give praises lying in the grave?
I with my groaning weary am,
I also all the night, my bed
Have caused for to swim, and I
With tears my couch have watered.
Mine eye consumed with grief grows old,
Because of all mine enemies.
Hence from me wicked workers all,
For God has heard my weeping cries.
God has my supplication heard;
My prayer received graciously.
Shamed, and sore vexed be all my foes,
Shamed, and back-turned suddenly.
Another of the same.
IN thy great indignation,
O Lord, rebuke me not;
Nor on the lay thy chastning hand
in thy displeasure hot.
Lord, I am weak, therefore on me
have mercy, and me spare:
Heal me, O Lord, because thou know
my bones much vexed are.
My soul is vexed sore; but, Lord,
how long stay will thou make?
Return, Lord, free my soul, and save
me for thy mercies sake.
Because of thee in death there shall
no more remembrance be:
Of those that in the grave do ly,
who shall give thanks to thee?
I with my groaning weary am,
and all the night my bed
I caused for to swim: with tears
my couch I watered.
By reason of my vexing grief,
mine eye consumed is;
It waxes old, because of all
that be mine enemies.
But now depart from me, all ye
that work iniquity;
For why, the Lord has heard my voice,
when I did mourn and cry.
Unto my supplication
the Lord did hearing give;
When I to him my prayer make,
the Lord will it receive.
Let all be shamed, and troubled sore,
that enemies are to me;
Let them turn back, and suddenly
ashamed let them be.
PSALM. VII. Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the
words of Cush the Benjamite.
O Lord my God, in thee do I
my confidence repose:
Save and deliver me from all
my persecuting foes.
Lest that the enemy my soul
should like a Lion tear,
In pieces renting it, while there
is no deliverer.
O Lord my God, if it be so
that I committed this;
If it be so, that in my hands
iniquity there is.
If I rewarded ill to him
that was at peace with me:
(Yea, even the man that without cause
my foe was, I did free.)
Then let the foe pursue, and take
my soul, and my life thrust
Down to the earth, and let him lay
mine honor in the dust.
Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thy self,
for my foes raging be:
And to the judgment, which thou have
commanded, wake for me.
So shall the assembly of thy folk
about encompasse thee:
Thou therefore for their sakes, return
unto thy place on hie.
The Lord he shall the people judge:
my judge, Jehovah, be,
After my righteousness, and mine
integrity in me.
O let the wickeds malice end,
but stablish steadfastly
The righteous: for the righteous God
the hearts and reins does try.
In God, who saves th'upright in heart,
is my defense and stay.
God just men judges, God is wroth
with ill men every day.
If he do not return again,
then he his sword will whet;
His bow he has already bent,
and has it ready set.
He also has for him prepared
the instruments of death;
Against the persecutors he
his shafts ordained has.
Behold, he with iniquity
does travail as in birth;
A mischief he conceived has,
and falsehood shall bring forth.
He made a pit, and dug it deep,
another there to take,
But he is fallen into the ditch
which he himself did make.
Upon his own head, his mischief
shall be returned home;
His violent dealing also down
on his own pate shall come.
According to his righteousness
the Lord I Will magnify:
And will sing praise unto the Name
of God, that is most hie.
PSALM. VIII. To the chief musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.
HOw excellent in all the earth,
Lord, our Lord, is thy Name!
Who have thy glory far advanced
above the starrie frame.
From infants and from sucklings mouth
thou did strength ordain,
For thy foes cause, that so thou might
the avenging foe restrain.
When I look up unto the heavens
which thine own fingers framed,
Unto the moon, and to the stars,
which were by thee ordained;
Then say I, what is man, that he
remembered is by thee?
Or what the son of man, that thou
so kind to him should be?
For thou a little lower have
him then the angels made,
With glory and with dignity
thou crowned have his head.
Of thy hand-works thou made him Lord;
all under's feet did lay:
All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts
that in the field do stray:
Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,
all that pass through the same.
How excellent in all the earth,
Lord, our Lord, is thy Name!
PSALM. IX. To the chief musician upon Muth-labben, A Psalm of David.
LOrd, thee I Will praise with all my heart,
thy wonders all proclaim.
In thee most high, I Will greatly joy,
and sing unto thy Name.
When back my foes were turned, they fell,
and perished at thy sight.
For thou maintained my right and cause,
on throne sat'st, judging right.
The heathen thou rebuked have,
the wicked over-thrown;
Thou have put out their names, that they
may never more be known.
O enemy! now destructions have
an end perpetual:
Thou cities razed, perished with them
is their memorial.
God shall endure for ay: he does
for judgment set his throne:
In righteousness to judge the world,
justice to give each one.
God also will a refuge be
for those that are oppressed;
A refuge will he be in times
of trouble to distressed.
And they that know thy Name, in thee
their confidence will place:
For thou have not forsaken them
that truly seek thy face.
O sing ye praises to the Lord,
that dwells in Sion hill:
And all the nations among,
his deeds record ye still.
When he enquireth after blood,
he then remembers them:
The humble folk he not forgets
that call upon his Name.
Lord, pity me, behold the grief
which I from foes sustain,
Even thou who from the gates of death
do raise me up again;
That I, in Sions daughters gates,
may all thy praise advance:
And that I may rejoice always
in thy deliverance.
The heathen are sunk in the pit,
which they themselves prepared
And in the net which they have hid
their own feet fast are snared.
The Lord is by the judgment known
which he himself has wrought:
The sinners hands do make the snares
wherewith themselves are caught.
They, who are wicked, into hell,
each one shall turned be,
And all the nations that forget
to seek the Lord most hie.
For they that needy are, shall not
forgotten be always:
The expectation of the poor
shall not be lost for ay.
Arise, Lord, let not man prevail,
judge heathens in thy sight.
That they may know themselves but men,
the nations, Lord, affright.
PSALM. X.
Wherefore is it, that thou, O Lord,
do stand from us afar?
And wherefore hidest thou thy self,
when times so troublous are?
The wicked in his loftiness
does persecute the poor:
In these devices they have framed
let them be taken sure.
The wicked of his hearts desire
does talk with boasting great;
He blesses him that is covetous,
whom yet the Lord does hate.
The wicked, through his pride of face,
on God he does not call:
And in the counsels of his heart
the Lord is not at all.
His ways they always grievous are:
thy judgments from his sight
Removed are: at all his foes
he puffs with despite.
Within his heart he thus has said.
I shall not moved be:
And no adversity at all
shall ever come to me.
His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,
is filled abundantly:
And underneath his tongue, there is
mischief and vanity.
He closely sits in villages:
he slayes the innocent:
Against the poor that pass him by
his cruel eyes are bent.
He Lyon-like lurks in his den:
he waits the poor to take:
And when he draws him in his net,
his prey he does him make.
Himself he humbles very low,
he croucheth down withal,
That so a multitude of poor
may by his strong ones fall.
He this has said within his heart,
the Lord has quite forgot:
He hides his countenance, and he
for ever sees it not.
O Lord, do thou arise; O God,
lift up thine hand on hie:
But not the meek afflicted ones
out of thy memory.
Why is it that the wicked man
thus does the Lord despise?
Because, that God will it require,
he in his heart denies.
Thou have it seen, for their mischief
and spite thou will repay:
The poor commits himself to thee,
thou art the orphans stay.
The arm break of the wicked man,
and of the evil one:
Do thou seek out his wickedness
until thou find none.
The Lord is King through ages all,
even to eternity:
The heathen people from their land
are perished utterly.
O Lord, of those that humble are
thou the desire did hear:
Thou will prepare their heart, and thou
to hear wilt bend thine ear:
To judge the fatherless, and those
that are oppressed sore,
That man, that is but sprung of earth,
may them oppress no more.
PSALM. XI. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
I in the Lord do put my trust:
how is it then that ye
Say to my soul, flee as a bird
unto your mountain hie?
For lo, the wicked bend their bow,
their shafts on string they fit:
That those who upright are in heart
they privily may hit.
If the foundations be destroyed,
what has the righteous done?
God in his holy Temple is,
in heaven is his throne:
His eyes do see, his eyelids try
men's sons. The just he proves:
But his soul hates the wicked man,
and him that violence loves.
Snares, fire and brimstone, furious storms
on sinners he shall rain:
This, as the portion of their cup,
does unto them pertain.
Because the Lord most righteous does
in righteousness delight,
And with a pleasant countenance
beholds the upright.
PSALM XII. To the chief musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
HElp Lord, because the godly man
does daily fade away;
And from among the sons of men
the faithful do decay.
Unto his neighbor every one
does utter vanity:
They with a double heart do speak,
and lips of flattery.
God shall cut off all flattering lips,
tongues that speak proudly, thus,
We Will with our tongue prevail, our lips
are ours: who is Lord over us?
For poor oppressed, and for the sighs
of needy, rise will I,
Says God, and him in safety set
from such as him defy.
The words of God are words most pure:
they be like silver tried
In earthen furnace, seven times
that has been purified.
Lord, thou shall them preserve and keep
for ever, from this race.
On each side walk the wicked, when
vile men are high in place.
PSALM. XIII. To chief musician, A Psalm of David.
HOw long will thou forget me, Lord,
shall it for ever be?
O how long shall it be, that thou will hide thy face from me?
How long take counsel in my soul,
still sad in heart, shall I?
How long exalted over me
shall be mine enemy?
O Lord my God, consider well,
and answer to me make:
Mine eyes enlighten, lest the sleep
of death me overtake.
Lest that mine enemy should say,
against him I prevailed;
And, those that trouble me, rejoice
when I am moved and failed.
But I have all my confidence
thy mercy set upon:
My heart within me shall rejoice
in thy salvation.
I will unto the Lord my God
sing praises cheerfully,
Because he has his bounty shown
to me abundantly.
PSALM. XIV. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
That there is not a God, the fool
does in his heart conclude:
They are corrupt, their works are vile,
not one of them does good.
Upon men's sons the Lord from heaven
did cast his eyes abroad;
To see if any understood,
and did seek after God.
They altogether filthy are,
they all aside are gone:
And there is none that does good,
yea, sure there is not one.
These workers of iniquity
do they not know at all,
That they my people eat as bread,
and on God do not call?
There feared they much: for God is with
the whole race of the just.
You shame the counsel of the poor,
because God is his trust.
Let Isreal's help from Sion come.
When back the Lord shall bring
His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,
and Israel shall sing.
PSALM. XV. A Psalm of David.
Within thy tabernacle, Lord,
who shall abide with thee?
And in thy high and holy hill
who shall a dweller be?
The man that walks uprightly,
and works righteousness,
And, as he thinks in his heart,
so does he truth express.
Who does not slander with his tongue,
nor to his friend does hurt,
Nor yet against his neighbor does
take up an ill report.
In whose eyes vile men are despised;
but those that God do fear
He honors: and changes not,
though to his hurt he swear.
His coin puts not to usury,
nor take reward will he
Against the guiltless. Who does thus
shall never moved be.
PSALM. XVI. Michtam of David.
LOrd keep me: for I trust in thee
To God thus was my speech,
Thou art my Lord, and unto thee
my goodness does not reach:
To saints on earth, to th'excellent
where my delight's all placed.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied,
to other gods that haste:
Of their drink offerings of blood
I will no offering make,
Yea, neither I their very names
up in my lips will take.
God is of mine inheritance
and cup the portion:
The lot that fallen is to me,
thou do maintain alone.
Unto me happily the lines
in pleasant places fell;
Yea, the inheritance I got,
in beauty does excel.
I bless the Lord, because he does
by counsel me conduct:
And in the seasons of the night,
my reins do me instruct.
Before me still the Lord I set:
since it is so, that he
Does ever stand at my right hand,
I shall not moved be.
Because of this my heart is glad,
and joy shall be expressed
Even by my glory: and my flesh
in confidence shall rest.
Because my soul in grave to dwell
shall not be left by thee;
Nor will thou give thine Holy One
corruption to see.
Thou will me show the path of life:
of joys there is full store
Before thy face, at thy right hand
are pleasures evermore.
PSALM XVII. A Prayer of David.
LOrd, hear the right, attend my cry,
unto my prayer give heed,
That does not in hypocrisy
from feigned lips proceed.
And from before thy presence forth
my sentence do thou send:
Toward these things that equal are,
do thou thine eyes intend.
Thou prov'dst mine heart, thou visitst me,
by night thou did me try,
Yet nothing found'st: for that my mouth
shall not sin purposed I.
As for men's works, I by the word
that from thy lips does flow,
Did me preserve out of the paths
wherein destroyers go.
Hold up my goings, Lord: me guide
in those thy paths divine,
So that my footsteps may not slide
out of these ways of thine.
I called have on thee, O God,
because thou will me hear:
That thou may hearken to my speech,
to me incline thine ear.
Thy wondrous loving kindness show,
thou that by thy right hand
Sav'st them that in thee trust, from those
that up against them stand.
As the apple of the eye me keep;
in thy wings shade me close,
From lewd oppressors, compassing
me round, as deadly foes.
In their own fat they are enclosed:
their mouth speaks loftily,
Our steps they compast; and to ground
down bowing set their eye.
He like unto a lion is,
that is greedy of his prey,
Or lion young, which lurking does
in secret places stay.
Arise, and disappoint my foe,
and cast him down, O Lord:
My soul save from the wicked man,
the man which is thy sword.
From men which are thy hand, O Lord,
from wordly men me save,
Which only in this present life
their part and portion have:
Whose belly with thy treasure hid
thou fill'st, they children have
In plenty, of their goods the rest
they to their children leave.
But as for me, I thine own face
in righteousness will see:
And with thy likeness, when I wake,
I satisfied shall be.
PSALM. XVIII. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord,
who spoke unto the Lord the words of this song, in the day that the Lord
delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and
he said,
THee will I love, O Lord, my strength.
My fortress is the Lord,
My rock, and he that does to me
deliverance afford:
My God, my strength, whom I will trust,
a buckler unto me,
The horn of my salvation,
and my high towr is he.
Upon the Lord, who worthy is
of praises, will I cry:
And then shall I preserved be
safe from mine enemy.
Floods of ill men affrighted me,
deaths pangs about me went.
Hells sorrows me environed:
deaths snares did me prevent.
In my distress I called on God,
cry to my God did I:
He from his temple heard my voice,
to his ears came my cry.
The Earth, as affrighted, then did shake,
trembling upon it seized;
The hills foundations moved were,
because he was displeased.
Up from his nostrils came a smoke,
and from his mouth there came
Devouring fire, and coals by it
were turned into flame.
He also bowed down the heavens,
and thence he did descend:
And thickest clouds of darkness did
under his feet attend.
And he upon a cherub rode,
and thereon he did fly:
Yea, on the swift wings of the wind
his flight was from on hy.
He darkness made his secret place:
about him for his tent
Dark waters were, and thickest clouds
of th'airie firmament.
And at the brightness of that light
which was before his eye,
His thick clouds past away, hailstones
and coals of fire did fly.
The Lord God also in the heavens
did thunder in his ire,
And there the highest gave his voice,
hailstones and coals of fire.
Yea, he his arrows sent abroad,
and them he scattered:
His lightnings also he shot out,
and them discomfited.
The waters channels then were seen,
the worlds foundations vast
At thy rebuke discovered were,
and at thy nostrils blast.
And from above the Lord sent down,
and took me from below,
From many waters he me drew,
which would me overflow.
He me relieved from my strong foes,
and such as did me hare:
Because he saw that they for me
too strong were, and too great.
They me prevented in the day
of my calamity:
But even then the Lord himself
a stay was unto me.
He, to a place of liberty
where room was, has me brought:
Because he took delight in me,
he my deliverance wrought.
According to my righteousness
he did me recompense,
He me repaid according to
my hands pure innocence.
For I Gods ways kept, from my God
did not turn wickedlie.
His judgments were before me, I
his Laws put not from me.
Sincere before him was my heart,
with him upright was I:
And watchfully I kept my self
from mine iniquity.
After my righteousness the Lord
has recompensed me,
After the cleanness of my hands
appearing in his eye.
Thou gracious to the gracious art,
to upright men upright.
Pure to the pure, froward thou kythes
unto the froward wight.
For thou will the afflicted save,
in grief that low do ly:
But wilt bring down the countenance
of them whose looks are hy.
The Lord will light my candle so,
that it shall shine full bright:
The Lord my God will also make
my darkness to be light.
By thee through troops of men I break,
and them discomfite all:
And, by my God assisting me,
I over-leap a wall.
As for God, perfect is his way:
the Lord his word is tried:
He is a buckler to all those
who do on him confide.
Who but the Lord is God? but he
who is a rock and stay?
It Is God that girdeth me with strength,
and perfect makes my way.
He made my feet swift as the hindes,
set me on my high places.
Mine hands to war he taught, mine arms
brake bows of steel in pieces.
The shield of thy salvation
thou did on me bestow:
Thy right hand held me up, and great
thy kindness made me grow.
And in my way, my steps thou have
enlarged under me,
That I go safely, and my feet
are kept from sliding free.
Mine enemies I pursued have,
and did them over-take:
Nor did I turn again, till I
an end of them did make.
I wounded them, they could not rise:
they at my feet did fall.
Thou girdest me with strength for war:
my foes thou brought down all.
And thou have given to me the necks
of all mine enemies:
That I might them destroy and slay
who did against me rise.
They cried out, but there was none
that would or could them save:
Yea, they did cry unto the Lord,
but he no answer gave.
Then did I beat them small, as dust
before the wind that flies:
And I did cast them out like dirt
upon the street that lies.
Thou made me free from peoples strife;
and heathens head to be:
A people whom I have not known,
shall service do to me.
At hearing they shall me obey,
to me they shall submit.
Strangers for fear shall fade away,
who in close places sit.
God lives, blessed be my rock: the God
of my health praised be.
God does avenge me, and subdues
the people under me.
He saves me from mine enemies:
Yea, thou have lifted me
Above my foes: and from the man
of violence, setst me free.
Therefore to thee will I give thanks
the heathen folk among:
And to thy Name, O Lord, I will
sing praises in a song.
He great deliverance gives his King:
he mercy does extend
To David, his anointed one,
and his seed without end.
PSALM. XIX. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
THe heavens Gods glory do declare:
the skies his hand-works preach.
Day utters speech to day, and night
to night does knowledge teach.
There is no speech nor tongue, to which
their voice does not extend.
Their line is gone through all the earth,
their words to the worlds end.
In them he set the sun a tent,
Who bride-groom-like forth goes
From's chamber, as a strong man does,
to run his race, rejoice.
From heavens end is his going forth,
circling to the end again:
And there is nothing from his heat
that hidden does remain.
Gods Law is perfect, and converts
the soul in sin that lies:
Gods testimony is most sure,
and makes the simple wise.
The statutes of the Lord are right,
and do rejoice the heart:
The Lords command is pure, and does
light to the eyes impart.
Unspotted is the fear of God,
and does endure for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true,
and righteous altogether.
They, more then gold, yea, much fine gold,
to be desired are:
Then honey, from the honey comb
that dropeth, sweeter far.
Moreover, they thy servant warn
how he his life should frame:
A great reward provided is
for them that keep the same.
Who can his errors understand?
O cleanse thou me within
From secret faults. Thy servant keep
from all presumptuous sin,
And do not suffer them to have
dominion over me:
Then righteous and innocent
I from much sin shall be.
The words which from my mouth proceed,
the thoughts sent from my heart
Accept, O Lord, for thou my strength
and my redeemer art.
PSALM. XX. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
JEhovah hear thee in the day
when trouble he does send,
And let the Name of Jacobs God
thee from all ill defend.
O let him help send from above,
out of his sanctuaries
From Sion his own holy hill,
let him give strength to thee.
Let him remember all thy gifts,
accept thy sacrifice.
Grant thee thine hearts wish, and fulfill
thy thoughts and counsel wise.
In thy salvation we will joy;
in our Gods Name we will
Display our banners: and the Lord
thy prayers all fulfill.
Now know I, God his King does save:
he from his holy heaven
Will hear him, with the saving strength
by his right hand that is given.
In chariots some put confidence,
some horses trust upon:
But we remember will the Name
of our Lord God alone.
We rise, and upright stand, when they
are bowed down, and fall.
Deliver, Lord, and let the King
us hear, when we do call.
PSALM. XXI. To the chief musician, A psalm of David.
THe King in thy great strength, O Lord,
shall very joyful be,
In thy salvation rejoice
how vehemently shall he!
Thou have bestowed upon him
all that his heart would have,
And thou from him did not withhold
what e're his lips did crave.
For thou with blessings him prevent'st
of goodness manifold;
And thou have set upon his head
a crown of purest gold.
When he desired life of thee,
thou life to him did give:
Even such a length of days, that he
for evermore should live.
In that salvation wrought by thee,
his glory is made great,
Honor and comely majesty
thou have upon him set.
Because that thou for evermore
most blessed have him made:
And thou have with thy countenance
made him exceeding glad:
Because the King upon the Lord
his confidence does lay,
And through the grace of the most high
shall not be moved away.
Thine hand shall all those men find out
that enemies are to thee,
Even thy right hand shall find out those,
of thee that haters be.
Like fiery ov'n thou shall them make,
when kindled is thine ire:
God shall them swallow in his wrath,
devour them shall the fire.
Their fruit from earth thou shall destroy,
their seed men from among.
For they, beyond their might, against thee
did plot mischief and wrong.
Thou therefore shall make them turn back,
when thou thy shafts shall place
Upon thy strings, made ready all
to fly against their face.
In thy great power and strength, O Lord,
be thou exalted hie:
So shall we sing with joyful hearts,
thy power praise shall we.
PSALM. XXII. To the chief musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.
MY God, my God why have thou me
forsaken? why so far
Art thou from helping me, and from
my words that roaring are?
All day, my God, to thee I cry,
yet am not heard by thee;
And in the season of the night
I cannot silent be.
But thou art holy, thou that do
inhabit Isreal's praise.
Our fathers hoped in thee, they hoped,
and thou did them release.
When unto thee they sent their cry,
to them deliverance came:
Because they put their trust in thee,
they were not put to shame.
But as for me, a worm I am,
and as no man am pris'd:
Reproach of men I am, and by
the people am despised.
All that me see laugh me to scorn:
shoot out the lip do they,
They nod and shake their heads at me,
and mocking, thus do say,
This man did trust in God, that he
would free him by his might:
Let him deliver him, since he
had in him such delight.
But thou art he out of the womb
that did me safely take:
When I was on my mothers breasts,
thou me to hope did make.
And I was cast upon thy care,
even from the womb till now:
And from my mothers belly, Lord,
my God and guide art thou.
Be not far off, for grief is near;
and none to help is found.
Bulls many compass me; strong bulls
of Bashan me surround.
Their mouths they opened wide on me,
upon me gape did they,
Like to a Lion ravening
and roaring for his prey.
Like water I Am powered out, my bones
all out of joint do part:
Amidst my bowels, as the wax,
so melted is my heart.
My strength is like a potsheard dried:
my tongue it cleaves fast
Unto my jaws; and to the dust
of death thou brought me have.
For dogs have compast me about:
the wicked, that did meet
In their assembly, me enclosed,
they pierced my hands and feet.
I all my bones may tell: they do
upon me look and stare.
Upon my vesture lots they cast,
and clothes among them share.
But be not far, O Lord, my strength;
haste to give help to me.
From sword my soul, from power of dogs
my darling set thou free.
Out of the roaring Lions mouth
do thou me shield and save:
For from the horns of Unicorns
an ear to me thou gave.
I will show forth thy Name unto
those that my brethren are:
Amidst the congregation
thy praise I will declare.
Praise ye the Lord, who do him fear:
him glorify, all ye
The seed of Jacob; fear him all
that Isra'ls children be.
For he despised not, nor abhorred
th'afflicteds misery:
Nor from him hid his face, but heard
when he to him did cry.
Within the congregation great
my praise shall be of thee:
My vows before them that him fear
shall be performed by me.
The meek shall eat, and shall be filled:
they also praise shall give
Unto the Lord that do him seek;
your heart shall ever live.
All ends of the earth remember shall,
and turn the Lord unto:
All kindreds of the nations
to him shall homage do.
Because the Kingdom to the Lord
does appertain, as his:
Likewise among the nations
the governor he is.
Earths fat ones eat, and worship shall:
all who to dust descend
Shall bow to him: none of them can
his soul from death defend.
A seed shall service do to him,
unto the Lord it shall
Be for a generation
reck'ned in ages all.
They shall come, and they shall declare
his truth and righteousness
Unto a people yet unborn,
and that he has done this.
PSALM. XXIII. A Psalm of David.
THe Lord's my shepherd, I Will not want.
He makes me down to ly
In pastures green: he leads me
the quiet waters by.
My soul he does restore again;
and me to walk does make
Into the paths of righteousness,
even for his own Names sake.
Yea, though I walk in deaths dark vale,
yet will I fear none ill:
For thou art with me, and thy rod
and staff me comfort still.
My table thou have furnished
in presence of my foes:
My head thou do with oil anoint,
and my cup overflowes.
Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me:
And in Gods house for evermore
my dwelling place shall be.
PSALM. XXIV. A Psalm of David.
THe earth belongs unto the Lord,
and all that it contains:
The world that is inhabited,
and all that there remains.
For the foundation thereof
he on the seas did lay,
And he has it established
upon the floods to stay.
Who is the man that shall ascend
into the hill of God?
Or who within his holy place
shall have a firm abode?
Whose hands are clean, whose heart is pure,
and unto vanity
Who has not lifted up his soul,
nor sworn deceitfully.
He from The Eternal shall receive
the blessing him upon,
And righteousness, even from the God
of his salvation.
This is the generation
that after him inquire,
O Jacob, who do seek thy face
with their whole hearts desire
Ye gates lift up your heads on high,
ye doors that last for ay
Be lifted up, that so the King
of glory enter may.
But who of glory is the King?
the mighty Lord is this,
Even that same Lord, that great in might,
and strong in battle is.
Ye gates lift up your heads, ye doors,
doors that do last for ay
Be lifted up, that so the King
of glory enter may.
But who is he that is the King
of glory? Who is this?
The Lord of hosts, and none but he
the King of glory is.
PSALM. XXV. A Psalm of David.
TO thee I lift my soul:
O Lord, I trust in thee,
My God, let me not be ashamed,
nor foes triumph over me.
Let none that wait on thee
be put to shame at all;
But those that without cause transgress
let shame upon them fall.
Show me thy ways, O Lord;
thy paths O teach thou me.
And do thou lead me in thy truth,
therein my teacher be:
For thou art God that do
to me salvation send,
And I upon thee, all the day
expecting, do attend.
Thy tender mercies, Lord,
I pray thee to remember,
And loving kindnesses: for they
have been of old for ever.
My sins and faults of youth
do thou, O Lord, forget:
After thy mercy think on me,
and for thy goodness great.
God good and upright is:
the way he will sinners show.
The meek in judgment he will guide,
and make his path to know.
The whole paths of the Lord
are truth and mercy sure
To those that do his covenant keep,
and testimonies pure.
Now for thine own Names sake,
O Lord, I thee entreat
To pardon mine iniquity:
for it is very great.
What man is he that fears
the Lord, and does him serve?
Him shall he teach the way that he
shall choose and still observe.
His soul shall dwell at ease;
and his posterity
Shall flourish still, and of the earth
inheritours shall be.
With those that fear him, is
the secret of the Lord:
The knowledge of his covenant
he will to them afford.
Mine eyes upon the Lord
continually are set:
For it is he that shall bring forth
my feet out of the net.
Turn unto me thy face,
and to me mercy show:
Because that I am desolate,
and am brought very low.
My hearts griefs are increased:
me from distress relieve.
See mine affliction and my pain,
and all my sins forgive.
Consider thou my foes,
because they many are,
And it a cruel hatred is,
which they against me bear.
O do thou keep my soul,
do thou deliver me:
And let me never be ashamed,
because I trust in thee.
Let uprightness and truth
keep me, who thee attend.
Redemption, Lord, to Israel
from all his troubles send.
Another of the same.
TO thee I lift my soul, O Lord:
My God, I trust in thee:
Let me not be ashamed; let not
my foes triumph over me.
Yea, let thou none ashamed be
that do on thee attend;
Ashamed let them be, O Lord,
who without cause offend.
Thy ways, Lord, show; teach me thy paths.
Lead me in truth, teach me:
For of my safety thou art God,
all day I wait on thee.
Thy mercies, that most tender are,
do thou, O Lord, remember,
And loving kindnesses: for they
have been of old for ever.
Let not the errors of my youth,
nor sins remembered be:
In mercy, for thy goodness sake,
O Lord, remember me.
The Lord is good and gracious,
He upright is also:
He therefore sinners will instruct:
in ways that they should go.
The meek and lowly he will guide
in judgment just always:
To meek and poor afflicted ones
he will clearly teach his way.
The whole paths of the Lord our God
are truth and mercy sure,
To such as keep his covenant.
and testimonies pure.
Now for thine own Names sake, O Lord,
I humbly thee entreat
To pardon mine iniquity:
for it is very great.
What man fears God? him shall he teach
the way that he shall choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease, his seed
the earth, as heirs, shall use.
The secret of the Lord is with
such as do fear his Name,
And he his holy covenant
will manifest to them.
Toward the Lord my waiting eyes
continually are set:
For he it is that shall bring forth
my feet out of the net.
O turn thee unto me, O God,
have mercy me upon:
Because I solitary am,
and in affliction.
Enlarged the griefs are of my heart:
me from distress relieve.
See mine affliction, and my pain,
and all my sins forgive.
Consider thou mine enemies,
because they many are;
And it a cruel hatred is,
which they against me bear.
O do thou keep my soul, O God,
do thou deliver me:
Let me not be ashamed, for I
do put my trust in thee.
O let integrity and truth
keep me, who thee attend.
Redemption, Lord, to Israel
from all his troubles send,
PSALM. XXVI. A Psalm of David.
JUdge me, O Lord, for I have walked
in mine integrity:
I trusted also in the Lord;
slide therefore shall not I.
Examine me, and do me prove;
try heart and reins, O God.
For thy love is before mine eyes,
thy truths paths I have trod
With persons vain I have not sat,
nor with dissemblers gone.
The Assembly of ill men I hate:
to sit with such I shun.
Mine hands in innocence, O Lord,
I Will wash and purify:
So to thine holy altar go
and compass it will I.
That I, with voice of thanksgiving,
may publish and declare,
And tell of all thy mighty works,
that great and wondrous are.
The habitation of thy house,
Lord, I have loved well,
Yea, in that place I do delight,
where does thine honor dwell.
With sinners gather not my soul,
and such as blood would spill:
Whose hands mischievous plots, right hand
corrupting bribes do fill.
But as for me, I will walk on
in mine integrity:
Do thou redeem me, and, O Lord,
be merciful to me.
My foot upon an even place
does stand with steadfastness:
Within the congregations
The Eternal I will bless.
PSALM. XXVII. A Psalm of David.
THe Lord's my light, and saving health,
who shall make me dismayed?
My life's strength is the Lord, of whom
then shall I be afraid?
When as mine enemies and foes,
most wicked persons all,
To eat my flesh against me rose,
they stumbled and did fall.
Against me though an host encamp,
my heart yet fearlesse is:
Though war against me rise, I will
be confident in this.
One thing I of the Lord desired,
and will seek to obtain,
That all days of my life I may
within Gods house remain,
That I the beauty of the Lord
behold may and admire,
And that I in his holy place
may reverently enquire.
For he, in his pavilion, shall
me hide in evil days:
In secret of his tent me hide,
and on a rock me raise.
And now, even at this present time,
mine head shall lifted be
Above all those that be my foes,
and round encompasse me:
Therefore unto his tabernacle
I Will sacrifices bring
Of joyfulnesse, I Will sing, yea, I
to God will praises sing.
O Lord, give ear unto my voice,
when I do cry to thee:
Upon me also mercy have,
and do thou answer me.
When thou did say, seek ye my face,
then unto thee reply
Thus did my heart, above all things
Thy face, Lord, seek will I.
Far from me hide not thou thy face,
put not away from thee
Thy servant in thy wrath: thou have
an helper been to me:
O God of my salvation,
leave me not, nor forsake.
Though me my parents both should leave,
the Lord will me up take.
O Lord, instruct me in thy way,
to me a leader be
In a plain path, because of those
that hatred bear to me.
Give me not to mine enemies will:
for witnesses, that lie,
Against me risen are, and such
as breath our cruelty.
I fainted had, unless that I
believed had, to see
The Lords own goodness in the land
of them that living be.
Wait on the Lord: and be thou strong,
and he shall strength afford
Unto thine heart: yea, do thou wait,
I say, upon the Lord.
PSALM. XXVIII. A Psalm of David.
TO thee I Will cry, O Lord, my rock,
hold not thy peace to me:
Lest, like those that to pit descend,
I by thy silence be.
The voice hear of my humble prayers,
when unto thee I cry:
When to thy holy oracle
I lift mine hands on hy.
With ill men draw me not away,
that work iniquity:
That speak peace to their friends, while in
their hearts does mischief ly.
Give them according to their deeds,
and ills endeavored:
And, as their handie-works deserve,
to them be rendered.
God shall not build, but them destroy
who would not understand
The Lords own works, nor did regard
the doing of his hand.
For ever blessed be the Lord,
for graciously he heard
The voice of my petitions,
and prayers did regard.
The Lord's my strength and shield, my heart
upon him did rely,
And I am helped, hence my heart
does joy exceedingly,
And with my song I will him praise.
Their strength is God alone:
He also is the saving strength
of his anointed One.
O thine own people do thou save,
bless thine inheritance:
Them also do thou feed, and them
for evermore advance.
PSALM. XXIX. A Psalm of David.
GIve ye unto the Lord, ye sons
that of the mighty be,
All strength and glory to the Lord,
with cheerfulness give ye.
Unto the Lord the glory give,
that to his Name is due;
And in the beauty of holiness,
unto Jehovah bow.
The Lords voice on the waters is:
the God of majesty
Does thunder, and on multitudes
of waters sits He.
A powerful voice it is, that comes
out from the Lord most hie;
The voice of that great Lord is full
of glorious majesty.
The voice of the Eternal does
asunder cedars tear:
Yea, God the Lord does cedars break
that Lebanon does bear.
He makes them like a calf to skip:
even that great Lebanon,
And like to a young unicorn
the mountain Sirion.
Gods voice divides the flames of fire:
The desert it does shake:
The Lord does make the wilderness
of Kadesh, all to quake.
Gods voice does make the hindes to calve;
it makes the forests bare:
And in his Temple every one
his glory does declare.
The Lord sits on the floods: the Lord
sits King, and ever shall.
The Lord will give his people strength,
and with peace bless them all.
PSALM. XXX. A Psalm and song at the dedication of the house of David.
LOrd, I will thee extol, for thou
have lifted me on hie,
And over me thou to rejoice
made not mine enemy.
O thou who art the Lord my God,
I in distress to thee
With loud cries lifted up my voice,
and thou have healed me.
O Lord, my soul thou have brought up,
and rescued from the grave:
That I to pit should not go down,
alive thou did me save.
O ye that are his holy ones,
sing praise unto the Lord:
And give unto him thanks, when you
his holiness record.
For, but a moment lasts his wrath;
life in his favor lies:
Weeping may for a night endure,
at morn does joy arise.
In my prosperity, I said,
that nothing shall me move.
O Lord, thou have my mountain made
to stand strong by thy love:
But when that thou, O gracious God,
did hide thy face from me,
Then quickly was my prosperous state,
turned into misery.
Wherefore unto the Lord, my cry
I caused to ascend:
My humble supplication,
I to the Lord did send.
What profit is there in my blood,
when I go down to pit?
Shall unto thee the dust give praise?
thy truth declare shall it?
Hear, Lord, have mercy, help me, Lord.
From me thou turned my sadness,
To dancing: yea, my sackcloth loosed,
and girded me with gladness.
That sing thy praise my glory may,
and never silent be:
O Lord my God, for evermore
I will give thanks to thee.
PSALM. XXXI. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
IN thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
shamed let me never be:
According to thy righteousness,
do thou deliver me.
Bow down thine ear to me, with speed
send me deliverance:
To save me, my strong rock be thou,
and my house of defense.
Because thou art my rock, and thee
I for my fortress take:
Therefore do thou me lead and guide,
even for thine own Names sake.
And since thou art my strength, therefore
pull me out of the net,
Which they in subtlety for me
so privily have set.
Into thine hands, I do commit
my sp'rit: for thou art he,
O thou Jehovah, God of truth,
that have redeemed me.
Those that do lying vanities
regard, I have abhorred:
But as for me, my confidence
is fixed on the Lord.
I Will in thy mercy gladly joy:
for thou, my miseries
Considered have; thou have my soul
known in adversities;
And thou have not enclosed me
within the enemies hand;
And by thee have my feet been made
in a large room to stand.
O Lord, upon me mercy have,
for trouble is on me;
Mine eye, my belly, and my soul
with grief consumed be.
Because my life with grief is spent,
my years with sighs and groans:
My strength does fail; and for my sin
consumed are my bones.
I was a scorn to all my foes,
and to my friends a fear:
And specially reproacht of those
that were my neighbors near:
When they me saw, they from me fled.
Even so I am forgot,
As men are out of mind, when dead:
I Am like a broken pot.
For slanders I of many heard,
fear compast me, while they
Against me did consult and plot,
to take my life away.
But as for me, O Lord, my trust,
upon thee I did lay:
And I to thee, thou art my God,
did confidently say.
My times are wholly in thine hand:
do thou deliver me
From their hands, that mine enemies
and persecuters be.
Thy countenance to shine, do thou
upon thy servant make:
Unto me give salvation,
for thy great mercies sake.
Let me not be ashamed, O Lord,
for on thee called I have:
Let wicked men be shamed, let them
be silent in the grave.
To silence put the lying lips:
that grievous things do say,
And hard reports, in pride and scorn,
on righteous men do lay.
How great's the goodness thou for them
that fear thee keepst in store;
And wroughtst for them that trust in thee,
the sons of men before!
In secret of thy presence, thou
shall hide them from man's pride:
From strife of tongues, thou closely shall,
as in a tent, them hide.
All praise and thanks be to the Lord;
for he has magnified
His wondrous love to me, within
a city fortified.
For from thine eyes cut off I am,
(I in my haste had said)
My voice yet heardst thou, when to thee
with cries, my moan I made.
O love the Lord, all ye his saints:
because the Lord does guard
The faithful, and he plenteously
proud doers does reward.
Be of good courage, and he strength
unto your heart shall send,
All ye whose hope and confidence
does on the Lord depend.
PSALM XXXII. A Psalm of David. Maschil.
O Blessed is the man, to whom
is freely pardoned
All the transgression he has done,
whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man, to whom the Lord
imputes not his sin,
And in whose sp'rit there is no guile,
nor fraud is found therein.
When as I did refrain my speech,
and silent was my tongue,
My bones then waxed old, because
I roared all day long.
For, upon me both day and night,
thine hand did heavy ly,
So that my moisture turned is
in summers drought thereby.
I thereupon have unto thee
my sin acknowledged,
And likewise mine iniquity,
I have not covered:
I will confess unto the Lord
my trespasses, said I;
And of my sin, thou freely did
forgive th'iniquity.
For this, shall every godly one,
his prayer make to thee,
In such a time he shall thee seek,
as found thou may be.
Surely, when floods of waters great,
do swell up to the brim,
They shall not over-whelm his soul,
nor once come near to him.
Thou art my hiding place, thou shall
from trouble keep me free:
Thou, with songs of deliverance,
about shall compass me.
I will instruct thee, and thee teach
the way that thou shall go,
And, with mine eye upon thee set,
I will direction show.
Then be not like the horse, or mule,
which do not understand:
Whose mouth, lest they come near to thee,
a bridle must command.
Unto the man that wicked is,
his sorrows shall abound:
But him that trusts in the Lord,
mercy shall compass round.
Ye righteous, in the Lord be glad,
in him do ye rejoice:
All ye that upright are in heart,
for joy lift up your voice.
PSALM. XXXIII.
YE righteous in the Lord rejoice:
it comely is, and right,
That upright men with thankful voice,
should praise the Lord of might.
Praise God with harp: and unto him
sing with the psalterie,
Upon a ten-string'd instrument
make ye sweet melody.
A new song to him sing, and play
with loud noise skilfully.
For, right is Gods word, all his works
are done in verity.
To judgment, and to righteousness,
a love He bears still:
The loving kindness of the Lord
the earth throughout does fill.
The heavens by the word of God,
did their beginning take;
And by the breathing of his mouth,
He all their hosts did make.
The waters of the seas He brings
together as an heap:
And in storehouses, as it were,
He lays up the depth.
Let earth, and all that live therein,
with reverence fear the Lord:
Let all the worlds inhabitants
dread him with one accord.
For he did speak the word, and done
it was, without delay;
Established, it firmly stood
whatever he did say.
God does the counsel bring to naught,
which heathen folk do take:
And what the people do devise,
of none effect does make.
O! but the counsel of the Lord,
does stand for ever sure,
And of his heart the purposes,
from age to age endure.
That nation blessed is, whose God
Jehovah is: and those
A blessed people are, whom for
his heritage he chose.
The Lord from heaven sees, and beholds
all sons of men full well.
He views all from his dwelling place,
that in the earth do dwell.
He forms their hearts alike: and all
their doings he observes.
Great hosts save not a King: much strength,
no mighty man preserves.
An horse for preservation,
is a deceitful thing:
And by the greatness of his strength,
can no deliverance bring.
Behold, on those that do him fear,
the Lord does set his eye:
Even those, who on his mercy do
with confidence rely.
From death to free their soul, in dearth,
life unto them to yield.
Our soul does wait upon the Lord:
he is our help and shield.
Since in his holy Name we trust,
our heart shall joyful be.
Lord, let thy mercy be on us,
as we do hope in thee.
PSALM. XXXIV. A Psalm of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech:
who drove him away, and he departed.
GOd will I bless all times: his praise
my mouth shall still express.
My soul shall boast in God: the meek
shall hear with joyfulnesse.
Extol the Lord with me, let us
exalt his Name together.
I sought the Lord, he heard, and did
me from all fears deliver.
They looked to him, and lightened were:
not shamed were their faces.
This poor man cried, God heard, and saved
him from all his distresses.
The angel of the Lord encamps,
and round encompasseth
All those about that do him fear,
and them delivers.
O taste and see, that God is good:
who trusts in him is blessed.
Fear God his saints: none that him fear
shall be with want oppressed.
The lions young may hungry be,
and they may lack their food:
But they that truly seek the Lord,
shall not lack any good.
O children, hither do ye come,
and unto me give ear:
I shall you teach to understand
how ye the Lord should fear.
What man is he that life desires,
to see good would live long?
Thy lips refrain from speaking guile,
and from ill words thy tongue.
Depart from ill, do good; seek peace,
pursue it earnestly.
Gods eyes are on the just; his ears
are open to their cry.
The face of God is set against
those that do wickedly,
That he may quite out from the earth
cut off their memory.
The righteous cry unto the Lord,
he unto them gives ear;
And they, out of their troubles all,
by him delivered are.
The Lord is ever nigh to them
that be of broken sp'rit:
To them he safety does afford,
that are in heart contrite.
The troubles that afflict the just,
in number many be:
But yet at length, out of them all,
the Lord does set them free.
He carefully his bones does keep,
what ever can befall;
That not so much as one of them
can broken be at all.
Ill shall the wicked slay: laid waste
shall be, who hate the just.
The Lord redeems his servants souls:
none perish that him trust.
PSALM. XXXV. A Psalm of David.
PLead, Lord, with those that plead, and fight
with those that fight with me.
Of shield and buckler take thou hold,
stand up mine help to be.
Draw also out the spear, and do
against them stop the way,
That me pursue: unto my soul,
I Am thy salvation, say.
Let them confounded be, and shamed,
that for my soul have sought:
Who plot my hurt, turned back be they,
and to confusion brought.
Let them be like unto the chaff,
that flies before the wind:
And let the angel of the Lord,
pursue them hard behind.
With darkness cover thou their way,
and let it slipperie prove,
And let the angel of the Lord
pursue them from above.
For, without cause have they for me
their net hid in a pit,
They also have without a cause,
for my soul dug it.
Let ruin seize him unawares,
his net he hid withal
Himself, let catch: and in the same
destruction let him fall.
My soul in God shall joy: and glad
in his salvation be.
And all my bones shall say, O Lord,
who is like unto thee,
Which do the poor set free from him
that is for him too strong;
The poor and needy from the man
that spoils and does him wrong?
False witnesses rose; to my charge
things I not knew they laid.
They, to the spoiling of my soul,
me ill for good repaid.
But as for me, when they were sick,
in sackcloth sad I mourned:
My humbled soul did fast, my prayer
into my bosom turned.
My self I did behave, as he
had been my friend, or brother:
I heavily bowed down, as one
that mourns for his mother.
But in my trouble they rejoiced,
gathering themselves together:
Yea, abjects vile, together did
themselves against me gather;
I knew it not, they did me tear,
and quiet would not be.
With mocking hypocrites, at feasts
they gnasht their teeth at me.
How long, Lord, lookst thou on? from those
destructions they intend
Rescue my soul, from lions young,
my darling do defend.
I will give thanks to thee, O Lord,
within the assembly great:
And, where much people gathered are,
thy praises forth will set.
Let not my wrongful enemies
proudly rejoice over me:
Nor, who me hate without a cause,
let them wink with the eye.
For peace they do not speak at all.
but crafty plots prepare
Against all those within the land,
that meek and quiet are.
With mouths set wide, they against me said,
Ha, ha, our eye does see.
Lord, thou have seen, hold not thy peace:
Lord, be not far from me.
Stir up thy self; wake, that thou may
judgment to me afford:
Even to my cause, O thou that art
my only God and Lord.
O Lord my God, do thou me judge
after thy righteousness,
And let them not their joy against me
triumphantly express.
Nor let them say within their hearts,
ah, we would have it thus;
Nor suffer them to say, that he
is swallowed up by us.
Shamed and confounded be they all
that at my hurt are glad:
Let those against me that do boast,
with shame and scorn be clad*
Let them that love my righteous cause
be glad, shout, and not cease
To say, the Lord be magnified,
who loves his servants peace.
Thy righteousness shall also be
declared by my tongue,
The praises that belong to thee,
speak shall it all day long.
PSALM. XXXVI. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord.
THe wicked man's transgression,
within my heart thus says,
Undoubtedly the fear of God
is not before his eyes.
Because himself he flattereth
in his own blinded eye,
Until the hatefulness be found
of his iniquity.
Words from his mouth proceeding, are
fraud and iniquity:
He to be wise, and to do good,
has left off utterly.
He mischief, lying on his bed,
most cunningly does plot,
He sets himself in ways not good;
ill he abhoreth not.
Thy mercy, Lord, is in the heaven;
thy truth does reach the clouds.
Thy justice is like mountains great;
thy judgments deep as floods;
Lord, thou preservest man and beast.
How precious is thy grace!
Therefore, in shadow of thy wings,
men's sons their trust shall place.
They, with the fatness of thy house,
shall be well satisfied:
From rivers of thy pleasures, thou will drink to them provide.
Because of life the fountain pure
remains alone with thee:
And in that purest light of thine,
we clearly light shall see.
Thy loving kindness unto them
continue that thee know;
And still on men upright in heart,
thy righteousness bestow.
Let not the foot of cruel pride
come, and against me stand:
And let me not removed be,
Lord, by the wickeds hand.
There fallen are they, and ruined,
that work iniquities:
Cast down they are, and never shall
be able to arise.
PSALM. XXXVII. A Psalm of David.
FOr evil doers fret thou not
thy self, unquietly,
Nor do thou envy bear to those
that work iniquity.
For even like unto the grass,
soon be cut down shall they,
And, like the green and tender herb,
they wither shall away.
Set thou thy trust upon the Lord,
and be thou doing good.
And so thou in the land shall dwell,
and verily have food.
Delight thy self in God he will give
thine hearts desire to thee.
Thy way to God commit, him trust,
it bring to pass shall he.
And, like unto the light, he shall
thy righteousness display,
And he thy judgment shall bring forth
like noontide of the day.
Rest in the Lord, and patiently
wait for him: do not fret
For him, who prospering in his way,
success in sin does get.
Do thou from anger cease, and wrath
see thou forsake also:
Fret not thy self in any wise,
that evil thou should do.
For, those that evil doers are,
shall be cut off and fall:
But those that wait upon the Lord,
the earth inherit shall.
For, yet a little while, and then
the wicked shall not be:
His place thou shall consider well,
but it thou shall not see.
But, by inheritance, the earth
the meek-ones shall possess:
They also shall delight themselves
in an abundant peace.
The wicked plots against the just,
and at him whets his teeth.
The Lord shall laugh at him, because
his day he coming sees.
The wicked have drawn out the sword,
and bent their bow, to slay
The poor and needy, and to kill
men of an upright way.
But their own sword, which they have drawn,
shall enter their own heart,
Their bows, which they have bent, shall break,
and into pieces part.
A little that a just man has,
is more, and better far
Then is the wealth of many such
as lewd and wicked are.
For sinners arms shall broken be:
but God the just sustains.
God knows the just man's days, and still
their heritage remains.
They shall not be ashamed, when they
the evil time do see:
And when the days of famine are,
they satisfied shall be.
But wicked men, and foes of God,
as fat of lambs decay,
They shall consume; yea, into smoke
they shall consume away.
The wicked borrows, but the same
again he does not pay:
Whereas the righteous mercy shows,
and gives his own away.
For such as blessed be of him,
the earth inherit shall;
And, they that cursed are of him,
shall be destroyed all.
A good man's footsteps by the Lord
are ordered aright:
And, in the way wherein he walks,
he greatly does delight.
Although he fall, yet shall he not
be cast down utterly:
Because the Lord with his own hand
upholds him mightily.
I have been young, and now am old:
yet have I never seen
The just man left, nor that his seed
for bread have beggars been.
He Is ever merciful, and lends:
his seed is blessed therefore.
Depart from evil, and do good:
and dwell for evermore.
For God loves judgment, and his saints
leaves not in any case,
They are kept ever: but cut off
shall be the sinners race.
The just inherit shall the land,
and ever in it dwell.
The just man's mouth does wisdom speak:
his tongue does judgment tell.
In's heart the Law is of his God,
his steps slide not away.
The wicked man does watch the just,
and seeks him to slay.
Yet him the Lord will not forsake,
nor leave him in his hands,
The righteous will He not condemn,
when he in judgment stands,
Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,
and thee exalt shall He,
The Earth to inherit: when cut off
the wicked thou shall see.
I saw the wicked great in power:
spread like a green bay tree.
He past, yea, was not: him I sought,
but found he could not be.
Mark thou the perfect, and behold
the man of uprightness:
Because that surely of this man
the latter end is peace.
But those men that transgressors are,
shall be destroyed together,
The latter end of wicked men
shall be cut off for ever.
But the salvation of the just
is from the Lord above,
He, in the time of their distress,
their stay and strength does prove.
The Lord shall help, and them deliver:
He shall them free and save
From wicked men: because in him
their confidence they have.
PSALM. XXXVIII. A Psalm of David to bring to remembrance.
IN thy great indignation,
O Lord, rebuke me not:
Nor on me lay thy chastning hand,
in thy displeasure hot.
For in me fast thine arrows stick,
thine hand does press me sore.
And in my flesh there is no health
nor soundness any more.
This grief I have, because thy wrath
is forth against me gone:
And in my bones there is no rest,
for sin that I have done.
Because, gone up above mine head
my great transgressions be:
And, as a weighty burden, they
too heavy are for me.
My wounds do stink, and are corrupt:
my folly makes it so.
I troubled am, and much bowed down;
all day I mourning go.
For a disease that loathsome is,
so fills my loins with pain.
That in my weak and weary flesh
no soundness does remain.
So feeble and infirm am I,
and broken am so sore;
That through disquiet of my heart,
I have been made to roar.
O Lord, all that I do desire,
is still before thine eye:
And of my heart the secret groans
not hidden are from thee.
My heart does pant uncessantly,
my strength does quite decay:
As for mine eyes, their wonted light
is from me gone away.
My lovers and my friends do stand
at distance from my sore:
And those do stand aloof, that were
kinsmen, and kind before.
Yea, they that seek my life, lay snares:
who seek to do me wrong
Speak things mischievous, and deceits
imagine all day long.
But, as one deaf, that hears not,
I suffered all to pass:
I as a dumb man did become,
whose mouth not opened was.
As one that hears not, in whose mouth
are no reproofs at all.
For, Lord, I hope in thee, my God,
thou wilt hear me when I call.
For I said, hear me, lest they should
rejoice over me, with pride:
And over me magnify themselves,
when as my foot does slide.
For, I am near to halt, my grief
is still before mine eye.
For I Will declare my sin; and grieve
for mine iniquity.
But yet mine enemies lively are,
and strong are they beside:
And, they that hate me wrongfully,
are greatly multipli'de.
And they, for good that render ill,
as enemies me withstood:
Yea, even for this, because that I
do follow what is good.
Forsake me not, O Lord: my God,
far from me never be.
O Lord, thou my salvation art,
haste to give help to me.
PSALM. XXXIX. To the chief musician, even to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.
I Said, I will look to my ways,
lest with my tongue I sin:
In sight of wicked men, my mouth
with bridle I Will keep in.
With silence, I as dumb became,
I did my self restrain
From speaking good, but then the more
increased was my pain.
My heart within me waxed hot,
and while I musing was,
The fire did burn: and from my tongue
these words I did let pass.
Mine end, and measure of my days,
O Lord, unto me show
What is the same: that I thereby,
my frailty well may know.
Lo, thou my days an hand-bredth made,
mine age is in thine eye
As nothing: sure each man at best
is wholly vanity.
Sure, each man walks in a vain show:
they vex themselves in vain:
He heaps up wealth, and does not know
to whom it shall pertain.
And now, O Lord. what wait I for?
my hope is fixed on thee.
Free me from all my trespasses,
the fools scorn make not me.
Dumb was I, opening not my mouth,
because this work was thine.
Thy stroke take from me: by the blow
of thine hand, I do pine.
When with rebukes thou do correct
man, for iniquity,
Thou wastes his beauty like a moth:
sure each man's vanity.
Attend my cry, Lord, at my tears,
and prayers, not silent be:
I sojourn as my fathers all,
and stranger am with thee.
O spare thou me, that I my strength
recover may again,
Before from hence I do depart,
and here no more remain.
PSALM. XL. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
I Waited for the Lord my God,
and patiently did bear;
At length to me he did incline
my voice and cry to hear.
He took me from a fearful pit,
and from the myrie clay,
And on a rock he set my feet,
establishing my way.
He put a new song in my mouth,
our God to magnify:
Many shall see it, and shall fear,
and on the Lord rely.
O blessed is the man whose trust
upon the Lord relyes:
Respecting not the proud, nor such
as turn aside to lies.
O Lord my God, full many are
the wonders thou have done;
Thy gracious thoughts to us ward, far
above all thoughts, are gone:
In order none can reckon them
to thee: if them declare,
And speak of them I would, they more
then can be numbered are.
No sacrifice, nor offering
did thou at all desire,
Mine ears thou bored: sin-offring thou,
and burnt, did not require,
Then to the Lord, these were my words,
I come, behold and see:
Within the volume of thy Book,
it written is of me:
To do thy will, I take delight,
O thou my God that art:
Yea, that most holy Law of thine,
I have within my heart.
Within the congregation great
I righteousness did preach:
Lo, thou do know, O Lord, that I
refrained not my speech.
I never did within my heart
conceal thy righteousness:
I thy salvation have declared,
and shown thy faithfulness:
Thy kindness, which most loving is,
concealed have not I,
Nor from the congregation great
have hid thy verity.
Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me
O do thou not restrain:
Thy loving kindness, and thy truth,
let them me still maintain.
For ills, past reckoning, compass me,
and mine iniquities
Such hold upon me taken have,
I cannot lift mine eyes:
They more then hairs are on mine head,
thence is my heart dismayed.
Be pleased, Lord, to rescue me:
Lord, hasten to mine aid.
Shamed and confounded be they all
that seek my soul to kill:
Yea, let them backward driven be,
and shamed that wish me ill.
For a reward of this their shame,
confounded let them be,
That in this manner scoffing say,
Aha, aha, to me.
In thee let all be glad, and joy,
who seeking thee abide:
Who thy salvation love, say still,
the Lord be magnified.
I Am poor and needy, yet the Lord
of me a care does take:
Thou art my help and Savior,
my God, no tarrying make.
PSALM. XLI. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
BLessed is he that wisely does
the poor man's case consider;
For, when the time of trouble is,
the Lord will him deliver.
God will him keep; yea, save alive,
on earth he blessed shall live;
And to his enemies desire,
thou will him not up give.
God will give strength, when he on bed
of languishing does mourn:
And in his sickness sore, O Lord,
thou all his bed will turn.
I said, O Lord, do thou extend
thy mercy unto me;
O do thou heal my soul, for why,
I have offended thee.
Those that to me are enemies,
of me do evil say:
When shall he die, that so his name
may perish quite away?
To see me if he comes, he speaks
vain words; but then his heart
Heaps mischief to it, which he tells,
when forth he does depart.
My haters, jointly whispering,
against me, my hurt devise.
Mischief, say they, cleaves fast to him:
he lies, and shall not rise.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend,
on whom I did rely,
Who ate my bread, even he his heel
against me lifted hie.
But, Lord, be merciful to me,
and up again me raise,
That I may justly them requite
according to their ways.
By this I know, that certainly
I favored am by thee:
Because my hateful enemy
triumphs not over me.
But as for me, thou me upholdst
in mine integrity:
And, me before thy countenance
thou setst continually.
The Lord, the God of Israel,
be blessed for ever then,
From age to age eternally.
Amen, yea, and amen.
PSALM. XLII. To the chief musician Maschil, for the sons of Korah.
LIke as the heart for waterbrooks
in thirst does pant and bray;
So pants my longing soul, O God,
that come to thee I may.
My soul for God, the living God,
does thirst: when shall I near
Unto thy countenance approach,
and in Gods sight appear?
My tears have unto me been meat
both in the night and day,
While unto me continually,
Where is thy God, they say?
My soul is poured out in me,
when this I think upon;
Because that with the multitude
I heretofore had gone:
With them into Gods house I went,
with voice of joy and praise,
Yea, with the multitude, that kept
the solemn holy days.
O why art thou cast down, my soul,
why in me so dismayed?
Trust God, for I shall praise him yet,
his countenance is mine aid.
My God, my soul's cast down in me:
thee therefore mind I will
From Jordans land, the Hermonites,
and even from Mizar hill.
At the noise of thy water-spouts,
deep unto deep does call:
Thy breaking waves pass over me,
yea, and thy billows all.
His loving kindness yet the Lord
command will in the day,
His song's with me by night, to God,
by whom I live, I Will pray.
And I will say to God, my rock,
why me forgets thou so?
Why, for my foes oppression,
thus mourning do I go?
It Is as a sword within my bones,
when my foes me upbraid:
Even when by them, Where is thy God,
it is daily to me said?
O why art thou cast down, my soul?
why, thus with grief oppressed,
Art thou disquieted in me?
in God still hope and rest;
For yet I know I shall him praise,
who graciously to me
The health is of my countenance,
yea, mine own God is he.
PSALM. XLIII.
JUdge me, O God, and plead my cause
against the ungodly nation;
From the unjust and crafty man,
O be thou my salvation.
For, thou the God art of my strength,
why thrusts thou me thee fro?
For the enemies oppression,
why do I mourning go?
O send thy light forth, and thy truth:
let them be guides to me,
And bring me to thine holy Hill,
even where thy dwellings be.
Then will I to Gods Altar go,
to God my chiefest joy:
Yea, God, my God, thy Name to praise
my harp I will employ.
Why art thou then cast down, my soul?
what should discourage thee?
And why, with vexing thoughts, art thou
disquieted in me?
Still trust in God, for him to praise
good cause I yet shall have;
He of my countenance is the health,
my God that does me save.
PSALM. XLIV. To the chief musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.
O God, we with our ears have heard,
our fathers have us told,
What works thou in their days had done,
even in the days of old.
Thy hand did drive the Heathen out,
and plant them in their place;
Thou did afflict the nations,
but them thou did increase.
For, neither got their sword the land,
nor did their arm them save:
But thy right hand, presence, and arm;
for, thou them favor gave.
Thou art my King: for Jacob, Lord,
deliverances command.
Through thee, we shall push down our foes,
that do against us stand:
We, through thy Name, shall tread down those
that risen against us have.
For, in my bow I shall not trust,
nor shall my sword me save.
But, from our foes thou have us saved,
our haters put to shame.
In God we all the day do boast,
and ever praise thy Name.
But now we are cast off by thee,
and us thou purst to shame;
And, when our armies do go forth,
thou go not with the same.
Thou make us from the enemy,
faint-hearted, to turn back:
And they, who hate us, for themselves
our spoils away do take.
Like sheep for meat thou gave us:
among Heathen cast we be.
Thou did for naught thy people sell.
their price enriched not thee.
Thou make us a reproach to be
unto our neighbors near;
Derision, and a scorn to them,
that round about us are.
A byword also thou do us
among the Heathen make:
The people, in contempt and spite,
at us their heads do shake.
Before me my confusion
continually abides;
And, of my bashful countenance,
the shame me ever hides.
For voice of him that does reproach,
and speaks blasphemy:
By reason of the avenging foe,
and cruel enemy.
All this is come on us; yet we
have not forgotten thee,
Nor falsely in thy Covenant
behaved our selves have we.
Back from thy way our heart not turned:
our steps no straying made:
Though us thou breakst in dragons place,
and coverest with deaths shade.
If we Gods Name forgot, or streacht
to a strange god our hands:
Shall not God search this out? for he
hearts secrets understands.
Yea, for thy sake, we are killed all day:
counted as slaughter-sheep.
Rise, Lord, cast us not ever off,
awake, why do thou sleep?
O wherefore hidest thou thy face?
forgetst our case distressed,
And our oppression? For our soul
is to the dust down pressed;
Our belly also on the earth,
fast cleaving, hold does take.
Rise for our help, and us redeem,
even for thy mercies sake.
PSALM. XLV. To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah,
Maschil, a song of loves.
MY heart brings forth a goodly thing:
my works that I endite
Concern the King: my tongue's a pen
of one that swift does write.
Thou fairer art then sons of men:
into thy lips is store
Of grace infused; God therefore thee
has blessed for evermore.
O thou that art the mighty One,
thy sword gird on thy thigh:
Even with thy glory excellent,
and with thy Majesty.
For meekness, truth and righteousness,
in state ride prosperously:
And thy right hand shall thee instruct
in things that fearful be.
Thine arrows sharply pierce the hearts
of the enemies of the King;
And under thy subjection
the people down do bring.
For ever and for ever is,
O God, thy throne of might:
The scepter of thy Kingdom is
a scepter that is right.
Thou love right, and hate ill:
for God, thy God most hie
Above thy fellows has, with th'oyl
of joy, anointed thee.
Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia,
a smell thy garments had;
Out of thy ivorie palaces,
whereby they made thee glad.
Among thy women honorable
Kings daughters were at hand:
Upon thy right hand did the queen,
in gold of Ophir stand.
O daughter, hearken and regard,
and do thine ear incline;
Likewise forget thy fathers house,
and people that are thine.
Then of the King desired shall be
thy beauty vehemently:
Because he is thy Lord, do thou
him worship reverently.
The daughter there of Tire shall be,
with gifts and offerings great:
Those of the people that are rich
thy favor shall entreat.
Behold the daughter of the King
all glorious is within;
And, with embroyderies of gold,
her garments wrought have bin.
She shall be brought unto the King,
in robes with needle wrought:
Her fellow-virgins following,
shall unto thee be brought.
They shall be brought with gladness great,
and mirth on every side,
Into the palace of the King,
and there they shall abide.
In stead of those thy fathers dear,
thy children thou may take,
And in all places of the earth,
them noble Princes make.
Thy Name remembered I will make,
through ages all, to be:
The people therefore evermore
shall praises give to thee.
Another of the same.
MY heart enditing is
good matter in a song:
I speak the things that I have made
which to the King belong:
My tongue shall be as quick
his honor to endite,
As is the pen of any scribe
that uses fast to write.
You Are fairest of all men,
grace in thy lips does slow:
And therefore blessings evermore
on thee does God bestow.
Thy sword gird on thy thigh,
thou that art most of might:
Appear in dreadful Majesty,
and in thy glory bright.
For meekness, truth and right,
ride prosperously in state:
And thy right hand shall teach to thee
things terrible and great.
Thy shafts shall pierce their hearts
that foes are to the King:
Whereby into subjection
the people thou shall bring.
Thy royal seat, O Lord*
for ever shall remain:
The scepter of thy Kingdom does
all righteousness maintain.
Thou loves right, and hates ill:
for God, thy God most hie,
Above thy fellows has with th'oyl
of joy anointed thee.
Of myrrh and spices sweet
a smell thy garments had:
Out of thy ivorie palaces,
whereby they made thee glad.
And, in thy glorious train,
Kings daughters waiting stand:
And thy fair queen, in Ophir gold,
does stand at thy right hand.
O daughter, take good heed,
incline, and give good ear;
Thou must forget thy kindred all,
and fathers house most dear.
Thy beauty to the King,
shall then delightful be:
And, do thou humbly worship him,
because thy Lord is he.
The daughter then of Tire
there with a gift shall be,
And all the wealthy of the land
shall make their suit to thee.
The daughter of the King
all glorious is within;
And, with embroyderies of gold,
her garments wrought have bin.
She comes to the King
in robes with needle wrought:
The virgins that do follow her
shall unto thee be brought.
They shall be brought with joy,
and mirth on every side,
Into the palace of the King,
and there they shall abide.
And, in thy fathers stead,
thy children thou may take,
And, in all places of the earth,
them noble Princes make.
I will show forth thy Name
to generations all:
Therefore thy people evermore
to thee give praises shall.
PSALM. XLVI. To the chief musician for the sons of Korah, A song upon Alamoth.
GOd is our refuge, and our strength,
in straits a present aid.
Therefore, although the earth remove,
we will not be afraid:
Though hills amidst the sea be cast,
Though waters roaring make,
And troubled be; yea, though the hills
by swelling seas do shake.
A river is, whose streams do glad
the City of our God:
The holy place, wherein the Lord
most high has his abode.
God in the midst of her does dwell:
nothing shall her remove;
The Lord to her an helper will,
and that right early, prove.
The Heathen raged tumultuously,
the Kingdoms moved were:
The Lord God uttered his voice,
the earth did melt for fear.
The Lord of hosts upon our side
does constantly remain:
The God of Jacob's our refuge,
us safely to maintain.
Come, and behold what wondrous works
have by the Lord been wrought:
Come, see what desolations
he on the earth has brought.
Unto the ends of all the earth
wars into peace he turns:
The bow he breaks, the spear he cuts,
in fire the chariot burns.
Be still, and know that I am God:
among the Heathen I
Will be exalted, I on earth
will be exalted hie.
Our God, who is the Lord of hosts,
is still upon our side.
The God of Jacob our refuge
for ever will abide.
PSALM. XLVII. To the chief musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
ALL people clap your hands, to God
with voice of triumph shout.
For dreadful is the Lord most high,
great King, the earth throughout.
The Heathen people under us
he surely shall subdue:
And he shall make the Nations
under our feet to bow.
The lot of our inheritance
choose out for us shall he,
Of Jacob whom he loved well,
even the excellency.
God is with shouts gone up, the Lord
with trumpets sounding hie.
Sing praise to God, sing praise, sing praise,
praise to our King sing ye.
For, God is King of all the earth,
with knowledge praise express.
God rules the nations, God sits on
his throne of holiness.
The princes of the people are
assembled willingly,
Even of the God of Abraham
they who the people be.
For why, the shields that do defend
the earth, are only his:
They to the Lord belong, yea He
exalted greatly is.
PSALM. XLVIII. A song, and psalm for the sons of Korah.
GReat is the Lord, and greatly He
is to be praised still,
Within the City of our God,
upon his holy hill.
Mount Sion stands most beautiful,
the joy of all the land;
The City of the mighty King
on her north side does stand.
The Lord, within her palaces,
is for a refuge known:
For lo, the Kings that gathered were
together by have gone.
But, when they did behold the same,
they wondering, would not stay;
But, being troubled at the sight,
they thence did haste away.
Great terror there took hold on them,
they were possessed with fear,
Their grief came like a woman's pain,
when she a child does bear.
Thou Tarshish ships with east wind breaks;
As we have heard it told;
So in the City of the Lord
our eyes did it behold,
In our Gods City, which his hand
for ever stablish will.
We, of thy loving kindness thought,
Lord, in thy Temple still.
O Lord, according to thy Name,
through all the earth's thy praise:
And thy right hand, O Lord, is full
of righteousness always.
Because thy judgments are made known,
let Sion mount rejoice;
Of Judah let the daughters all
send forth a cheerful voice.
Walk about Sion, and go round,
the high towrs thereof tell:
Consider ye her palaces,
and mark her bulwarks well,
That ye may tell posterity.
For this God does abide
Our God for evermore, he will
even unto death us guide.
PSALM. XLIX. To the chief musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
HEar this all people, and give ear
all in the world that dwell,
Both low and high, both rich and poor.
My mouth shall wisdom tell.
My heart shall knowledge meditate,
I will incline mine ear
To parables, and on the harp
my sayings dark declare.
Amidst those days, that evil be,
why should I, fearing, doubt?
When of my heels th'iniquitie
shall compass me about.
Who e're they be, that in their wealth
their confidence do pitch,
And boast themselves, because they are
become exceeding rich.
Yet none of these his brother can
redeem by any way,
Nor can he unto God, for him
sufficient ransom pay;
(Their souls redemption precious is,
and it can never be)
That still he should for ever live,
and not corruption see.
For why? he sees that wise men die,
and brutish fools also
Do perish, and their wealth, when dead,
to others they let go.
Their inward thought is, that their house,
and dwelling places shall
Stand through all ages; they their lands
by their own names do call.
But yet in honor shall not man
abide continually;
But passing hence, may be compared
unto the beasts that die.
Thus, brutish folly plainly is
their wisdom, and their way;
Yet, their posterity approve
what they do fondly say.
Like sheep, they in the grave are laid,
and death shall them devour;
And, in the morning, upright men
shall over them have power:
Their beauty, from their dwelling, shall
consume within the grave.
But, from hells hand God will me free,
for he shall me receive.
Be thou not then afraid, when one
enriched thou do see,
Nor when the glory of his house
advanced is on hie.
For, he shall carry nothing hence,
when death his days does end;
Nor shall his glory after him
into the grave descend.
Although he his own soul did bless
whilst he on earth did live,
(And when thou to thy self do well,
men will thee peaises give)
He to his fathers race shall go,
they never shall see light.
Man honored, wanting knowledge, is
like beasts that perish quite.
PSALM. L. A Psalm of Asaph.
THe mighty God, the Lord
has spoken, and did call
The earth, from rising of the sun,
to where he has his fall.
From out of Sion hill,
which, of excellency
And beauty the perfection is,
God shined gloriously.
Our God shall surely come,
keep silence shall not He;
Before Him fire shall waste, great storms
shall round about Him be.
Unto the heaven's clear,
He from above shall call,
And to the earth likewise, that He
may judge his people all.
Together let my saints
unto me gathered be,
Those that by sacrifice have made
a covenant with me.
And then the heavens shall
his righteousness declare;
Because the Lord himself is He,
by whom men judged are.
My people Israel hear,
speak will I from on hie,
Against thee I will testify,
God, even thy God am I.
I, for thy sacrifice,
no blame will on thee lay,
Nor for burnt-offrings, which to me
thou off'redst every day.
I Will take no calf, nor goats,
from house or fold of thine:
For, beasts of forests, cattle all
on thousand hills are mine.
The fowls on mountains high,
are all to me well known,
Wild beasts, which in the fields do ly,
even they are all mine own.
Then, if I hungry were,
I would not tell it thee;
Because the world, and fullness all
thereof belongs to me.
Will I eat flesh of bulls?
or goats blood drink will I?
Thanks offer thou to God, and pay
thy vows to the most hie;
And call upon me, when
in trouble thou shall be,
I will deliver thee, and thou
my Name shall glorify,
But to the wicked man
God says, my laws and truth
Should thou declare? how dare thou take
my covenant in thy mouth?
Since thou instruction hates,
which should thy ways direct.
And, since my words behind thy back
thou casts, and do reject.
When thou a thief did see,
with him thou did consent;
And with the vile adulterers
partaker on thou went.
Thou giv'st thy mouth to ill,
thy tongue deceit does frame;
Thou sits, and against thy brother speaks,
thy mothers son does shame.
Because I silence kept,
while thou these things have wrought;
That I was altogether like
thy self, has been thy thought:
Yet I will thee reprove,
and set before thine eyes
In order ranked thy misdeeds,
and thine iniquities.
Now, ye that God forget,
this carefully consider;
Lest I in pieces tear you all,
and none can you deliver.
Who so does offer praise,
me glorifies, and I
Will show him Gods salvation,
that orders right his way.
Another of the same.
THe mighty God the Lord has spoke,
and called the earth upon,
Even from the rising of the sun,
unto his going down.
From out of Sion, his own hill,
where the perfection hie
Of beauty is, from thence the Lord
has shined gloriously.
Our God shall come, and shall no more
be silent, but speak out:
Before him fire shall waste, great storms
shall compass him about.
He, to the heavens from above,
and to the earth below
Shall call, that He his judgment may
before his people show.
Let all my saints together be
unto me gathered,
Those, that by sacrifice, with me
a covenant have made.
And then the heavens shall declare
His righteousness abroad:
Because the Lord himself does come,
none else is judge but God.
Hear, O my people, and I Will speak:
O Israel by name,
Against thee I will testify,
God, even thy God I am.
I, for thy sacrifices few,
reprove thee never will;
Nor for burnt-offrings to have been
before me offered still.
I Will take no bullock, nor hee-goats
from house, nor folds of thine:
For, beasts of forests, cattle all
on thousand hills, are mine.
The fowls are all to me well known,
that mountains high do yield;
And I do challenge as mine own,
the wild beasts of the field.
If I were hungry, I would not
to thee for need complain;
For earth, and all its fullness, does
to me of right pertain.
That I, to eat the flesh of bulls
take pleasure, do thou think?
Or, that I need to quench my thirst,
the blood of goats to drink?
Nay, rather unto me, thy God,
thanksgiving offer thou,
To the most high perform thy word,
and fully pay thy vow.
And, in the day of trouble great,
see that thou call on me;
I will deliver thee, and thou
my Name shall glorify,
But, God unto the wicked says,
why should thou mention make
Of my commands? how dare thou in
thy mouth my covenant take?
Since it is so, that thou do hate
all good instruction;
And since thou casts, behind thy back,
and slights my words each one.
When thou a thief did see, then straight
thou joined with him in sin;
And, with the vile adulterers,
thou have partaker bin:
Thy mouth to evil thou do give,
thy tongue deceit does frame,
Thou sitst, and against thy brother speak,
thy mothers son to shame.
These things thou wickedly have done,
and I have silent bin;
Thou thought that I was like thy self,
and did approve thy sin:
But I will sharply thee reprove,
and I will order right,
Thy sins and thy transgressions
in presence of thy sight.
Consider this, and be afraid,
ye that forget the Lord,
Left I in pieces tear you all,
when none can help afford.
Who offers praise, me glorifies:
I will show Gods salvation
To him that orders aright
his life, and conversation.
PSALM. LI. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet
came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.
AFter thy loving kindness, Lord,
have mercy upon me:
For thy compassions great, blot out
all mine iniquity.
Me cleanse from sin, and thoroughly wash
from mine iniquity.
For, my transgressions I confess,
my sin I ever see.
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
in thy sight done this ill,
That, when thou speaks, thou may be just,
and clear in judging still.
Behold, I in iniquity
was formed the womb within;
My mother also me conceived
in guiltiness and sin.
Behold, thou, in the inward parts,
with truth delighted art;
And wisdom thou shall make me know
within the hidden part.
Do thou with hyssop sprinkle me,
I shall be cleansed so;
Yea, wash thou me, and then I shall
be whiter then the snow.
Of gladness, and of joyfulnesse,
make me to hear the voice;
That so, these very bones, which thou
have broken, may rejoice.
All mine iniquities blot out,
thy face hide from my sin.
Create a clean heart: Lord, renew
a right sp'rit me within.
Cast me not from thy sight, nor take
thy holy sp'rit away:
Restore me thy salvations joy;
with thy free sp'rit me stay.
Then will I teach thy ways unto
those that transgressors be;
And those that sinners are, shall then
be turned unto thee.
O GOD of my salvation God,
me from blood-guiltinesse
Set free: then shall my tongue aloud
sing of thy righteousness.
My closed lips, O Lord, by thee
let them be opened;
Then shall thy praises by my mouth
abroad be published.
For thou desir'st not sacrifice,
else would I give it thee;
Nor will thou with burnt-offering
at all delighted be.
A broken spirit is to God
a pleasing sacrifice,
A broken, and a contrite heart,
Lord, thou will not despise.
Show kindness and do good, O Lord,
to Sion thine own hill;
The walls of thy Jerusalem
build up, of thy good will.
Then righteous offerings shall thee please,
and offerings burnt, which they,
With whole burnt-offrings and with calves,
shall on thine altar lay.
PSALM. LII. To the chief musician Maschil, A Psalm of David, when Doeg the
Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of
Ahimelech.
Why do thou boast, O mighty man,
of mischief and of ill?
The goodness of Almighty God
endures ever still.
Thy tongue mischievous calumnies
devises subtily,
Like to a razor, sharp to cut,
working deceitfully.
Ill more then good, and more then truth
thou love to speak wrong:
Thou love all devouring words,
O thou deceitful tongue.
So God shall thee destroy for ay,
remove thee, pluck thee out
Quite from thy house, out of the land
of life he shall thee root.
The righteous shall it see, and fear,
and laugh at him they shall:
Lo, this the man is, that did not
make GOD his strength at all:
But he, in his abundant wealth,
his confidence did place;
And he took strength unto himself
from his own wickedness.
But I am in the house of God
like to an olive green:
My confidence for ever has
upon Gods mercy been.
And I for ever will thee praise,
because thou have done this:
I on thy Name will wait, for good
before thy saints it is.
PSALM. LIII. To the chief musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalm of David.
THat there is not a God, the fool
does in his heart conclude:
They are corrupt, their works are vile,
not one of them does good.
The Lord upon the sons of men
from heaven did cast his eyes,
To see if any one there was
that sought God, and was wise.
They altogether filthy are,
they all are backward gone;
And there is none that does good,
no not so much as one.
These workers of iniquity
do they not know at all,
That they my people eat as bread
and on God do not call.
Even there they were afraid, and stood
with trembling all dismayed,
Whereas there was no cause at all,
why they should be afraid.
For God his bones that thee besieged
has scattered all abroad,
Thou have confounded them, for they
despised are of God.
Let Isreal's help from Sion come*
When back the Lord shall bring
His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,
and Israel shall sing*
PSALM. LIVE. To the chief musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when
the Ziphims came and said to Saul, does not David hide himself with us?
SAve me, O God, by thy great Name,
and judge me by thy strength:
My prayer hear, O God; give ear
unto my words at length.
For they that strangers are to me
do up against me rise;
Oppressors seek my soul, and God
set not before their eyes.
The Lord my God my helper is,
lo, therefore I am bold,
He takes part with every one
that does my soul uphold.
Unto mine enemies he shall
mischief and ill repay.
O for thy truths sake cut them off,
and sweep them clean away.
I will a sacrifice to thee
give with free willingness:
Thy Name, O Lord, because it is good,
with praise I will confess.
For he has me delivered
from all adversities:
And his desire mine eye has seen
upon mine enemies.
PSALM LV. To the chief musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David.
LOrd, hear my prayer, hide not thy self
from my entreating voice:
Attend and hear me, in my plaint
I mourn and make a noise.
Because of the enemies voice, and for
lewd men's oppression great;
On me they cast iniquity,
and they in wrath me hate.
Sore pained within me is my heart,
deaths terrors on me fall;
On me comes trembling, fear and dread
o'rewhelmed me withal.
O that I like a dove had wings,
said I, then would I fly
Far hence, that I might find a place
where I in rest might be.
Lo then far off I wander would,
and in the desert stay:
From windy storm and tempest I
would haste to escape away.
O Lord, on them destruction bring,
and do their tongues divide:
For in the city violence,
and strife I have espide.
They day and night upon the walls
do go about it round:
There mischief is, and sorrow there
in midst of it is found.
Abundant wickedness there is
within her inward part;
And from her streets deceitfulness
and guile do not depart.
He was no foe that me reproached,
then that endure I could,
Nor hater that did against me boast,
from him me hide I would.
But thou man, who mine equal, guide,
and mine acquaintance wast,
We joined sweet counsels, to Gods house
in company we past.
Let death upon them seize, and down
let them go quick to hell;
For wickedness does much abound
among them where they dwell.
I Will call on God, God will me save.
I Will pray and make a noise
At evening, morning, and at noon;
and he shall hear my voice.
He has my soul delivered,
that it in peace might be,
From battle that against me was,
for many were with me.
The Lord shall hear, and them afflict,
of old who has abode:
Because they never changes have,
therefore they fear not God.
Against those that were at peace with him
he has put forth his hand:
The covenant that he had made,
by breaking he profaned.
More smooth then butter were his words,
while in his heart was war;
His speeches were more soft then oil,
and yet drawn swords they are.
Cast thou thy burden on the Lord,
and he shall thee sustain;
Yea, he shall cause the righteous man
unmoved to remain.
But thou, O Lord my God, those men
in justice shall overthrow,
And in destructions dungeon dark
at last shall lay them low.
The bloody and deceitful men
shall not live half their days;
But upon thee with confidence
I will depend always.
PSALM. LVI. To the chief musician upon Jonath-elemrechokim, Michtam of David,
when the Philistines took him in Gath.
Show mercy, Lord to me: for man
would swallow me outright:
He me oppresses, while he does
against me daily fight.
They daily would me swallow up,
that hate me spitefully;
For they be many that do fight
against me, O most hie.
When I Am afraid, I Will trust in thee:
In God I Will praise his word,
I will not fear what flesh can do,
my trust is in the Lord.
Each day they wrest my words, their thoughts
against me are all for ill.
They meet, they lurk, they mark my steps
waiting my soul to kill.
But shall they by iniquity
escape thy judgment so?
O God, with indignation, down
do thou the people throw.
My wanderings all what they have been
thou know, their number took.
Into thy bottle put my tears,
are they not in thy book?
My foes shall, when I cry, turn back,
I know it, God is for me.
In God his word I Will praise, his word
in God shall praised be.
In God I trust, I will not fear
what man can do to me.
Thy vows upon me are, O God:
I Will render praise to thee.
Will thou not, who from death me saved,
my feet from falls keep free,
To walk before God in the light
of those that living be.
PSALM. LVII. To the chief musician Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled
from Saul in the cave,
BE merciful to me, O God,
thy mercy unto me
Do thou extend, because my soul
does put her trust in thee.
Yea, in the shadow of thy wings
my refuge I will place,
Until these sad calamities
do wholly overpasse.
My cry I will cause to ascend
unto the Lord most hie,
To God, who does all things for me
perform most perfectly.
From heaven he shall send down, and me
from his reproach defend,
That would devour me; God his truth
and mercy forth shall send.
My soul among fierce lions is,
I firebrands live among,
Men's sons, whose teeth are spears and darts,
a sharp sword is their tongue.
Be thou exalted very high
above the heavens, O God;
Let thou thy glory be advanced
over all the earth abroad.
My soul's bowed down, for they a net
have laid, my steps to snare;
Into the pit, which they have dig'd
for me, they fallen are.
My heart is fixed, my heart is fixed,
O God, I Will sing, and praise.
My glory wake, wake psaltry, harp;
my self I Will early raise.
I Will praise thee among the people, Lord,
among nations sing will I*
For great to heaven thy mercy is,
thy truth is to the sky.
O Lord, exalted be thy Name,
above the heavens to stand:
Do thou thy glory far advance
above both sea and land.
PSALM. LVIII. To the chief musician Al-taschith, Michtam of David.
DO ye, O congregation,
indeed speak righteousness?
O ye that are the sons of men,
judge ye with uprightness?
Yea even within your very hearts
ye wickedness have done;
And ye the violence of your hands
do weigh the earth upon.
The wicked men estranged are
even from the very womb;
They speaking lies do stray, as soon
as to the world they come.
Unto a serpents poison like
their poison does appear;
Yea, they are like the adder deaf,
that closely stops her ear:
That so she may not hear the voice
of one that charm her would,
No not though he most cunning were,
and charm most wisely could.
Their teeth, O God, within their mouth
break thou in pieces small;
The great teeth break thou out, O Lord,
of these young lions all.
Let them like waters melt away,
which downward still do flow:
In pieces cut his arrows all,
when he shall bend his bow.
Like to a snail that melts away,
let each of them be gone:
Like woman's birth untimely, that
they never see the sun.
He shall them take away, before
your pots the thorns can find,
Both living, and in fury great,
as with a stormy wind.
The righteous when he vengeance sees,
he shall be joyful then;
The righteous one shall wash his feet
in blood of wicked men.
So men shall say, the righteous man
reward shall never miss;
And verily upon the earth
a God to judge there is.
PSALM. LIX. To the chief musician Al-taschith, Michtam of David: when Saul
sent, and they watched the house to kill him.
MY God, deliver me from those
that are mine enemies:
And do thou me defend from those
that up against me rise.
Do thou deliver me from them
that work iniquity;
And give me safety from the men
of blood cruelty.
For lo, they for my soul lay wait;
the mighty do combine
Against me, Lord, not for my fault,
nor any sin of mine.
They run, and without fault in me
themselves do ready make:
Awake to meet me with thy help,
and do thou notice take.
Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts*
thou God of Israel,
To visit Heathen all: spare none
that wickedly rebel.
At evening they go to and fro;
they make great noise, and sound
Like to a dog, and often walk
about the city round.
Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
and in their lips are swords:
For they do say thus, who is he
that now does hear our words?
But thou, O Lord, shall laugh at them,
and all the Heathen mock.
While he is in power I Will wait on thee:
for God is my high rock.
He of my mercy that is God,
betimes shall me prevent:
Upon mine enemies God shall let
me see mine hearts content.
Them slay not, left my folk forget;
but scatter them abroad
By thy strong power; and bring them down,
O thou our shield, and God.
For their mouths sin, and for the words
that from their lips do fly,
Let them be taken in their pride,
because they curse and lie.
In wrath consume them, them consume,
that so they may not be:
And that in Jacob God does rule
to the earths ends let them see.
At evening let thou them return,
making great noise, and sound
Like to a dog, and often walk
about the city round.
And let them wander up and down
in seeking food, to eat;
And let them grudge when they shall not
be satisfied with meat.
But of thy power I Will sing aloud
at morn thy mercy praise:
For thou to me my refuge wast,
and towr in troublous days.
O God, that art my strength, I will
sing praises unto thee;
For God is my defense, a God
of mercy unto me.
PSALM. LX. To the chief musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to
teach, when he strove with Aram Naharaim, and with Aram Zobah, when Joab
returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt, twelve thousand,
O Lord, thou have rejected us,
and scattered us abroad,
Thou justly have displeased been,
return to us, O God.
The earth to tremble thou have made;
therein did breaches make:
Do thou thereof the breaches heal,
because the land does shake.
Unto thy people, thou hard things
have showed, and on them sent:
And thou have caused us to drink
wine of astonishment.
And yet a banner thou have given
to them who thee do fear:
That it by them, because of truth
displayed may appear.
That thy beloved people may
delivered be from thrall;
Save with the power of thy right hand,
and hear me when I call.
God in his holiness has spoke,
herein I will take pleasure:
Shechem I will divide, and forth
will Succoths valley measure.
Gilead I claim as mine, by right,
Manasseh mine shall be,
Ephraim is of mine head the strength,
Judah gives laws for me.
Moab's my washing-pot, my shoe
I Will over Edom throw:
And over Palestina's land
I will in triumph go.
O who is he will bring me to
the city fortified?
O who is he that to the land
of Edom will me guide?
O God, which hadest us cast off,
this thing will thou not do?
Even thou, O God, which did not
forth with our armies go.
Help us from trouble: for the help
is vain which man supplies.
Through God we will do great acts: he shall
tread down our enemies.
PSALM. LXI. To the chief musician upon Neginoth, A Psalm of David.
O God, give ear unto my cry.
unto my prayer attend.
From the utmost corner of the land
my cry to thee I Will send,
What time my heart is overwhelmed,
and in perplexity;
Do thou me lead unto the Rock
that higher is then I.
For thou have for my refuge been
a shelter by thy power,
And, for defense against my foes,
thou have been a strong tower
Within thy Tabernacle I
for ever will abide:
And under covert of thy wings
with confidence me hide.
For thou, the vows that I did make.
O Lord my God, did hear:
Thou have given me the heritage
of those thy Name that fear.
A life prolonged for many days
thou to the King shall give:
Like many generations be
the years which he shall live.
He in Gods presence, his abode
for evermore shall have:
O do thou truth and mercy both
prepare that may him save.
And so will I perpetually
sing praise unto thy Name.
That, having made my vows, I may
each day perform the same.
PSALM. LXII. To the chief musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.
MY soul with expectation
depends on God indeed;
My strength and my salvation does
from him alone proceed.
He only my salvation is,
and my strong rock is He;
He only is my sure defense;
much moved I shall not be.
How long will ye against a man
plot mischief? ye shall all
Be slain, ye as a tottering fence
shall be, and bowing wall.
They only plot to cast him down
from his excellency;
They joy in lies, with mouth they bless,
but they curse inwardly.
My soul wait thou with patience
upon thy God alone:
On him depends all my hope
and expectation.
He only my salvation is,
and my strong Rock is He;
He only is my sure defense:
I shall not moved be.
In God my glory placed is,
and my salvation sure:
In God the Rock is of my strength,
my refuge most secure.
Ye people place your confidence
in him continually;
Before him pour ye out your heart:
God is our refuge hie.
Surely mean men are vanity,
and great men are a lie:
In balance laid, they wholly are
more light then vanity.
Trust ye not in oppression,
in robbery be not vain:
On wealth set not your hearts, when as
increased is your gain.
God has it spoken once to me,
yea, this I heard again,
That power, to Almighty God
alone, does appertain.
Yea, mercy also unto thee
belongs, O Lord, alone;
For thou according to his work
rewardest every one.
PSALM. LXIII. A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
LOrd, thee my God I Will early seek:
my soul does thirst for thee,
My flesh longs in a dry parcht land,
wherein no waters be.
That I thy power may behold,
and brightness of thy face,
As I have seen thee heretofore,
within thy holy place.
Since better is thy love then life,
my lips thee praise shall give.
I in thy Name will lift my hands,
and bless thee while I live.
Even as with marrow and with fat,
my soul shall filled be;
Then shall my mouth, with joyful lips,
sing praises unto thee:
When I do thee upon my bed
remember with delight,
And when on thee I meditate
in watches of the night.
In shadow of thy wings I Will joy.
for thou mine help have been.
My soul thee follows hard; and me
thy right hand does sustain.
Who seek my soul to spill, shall sink
down to earths lowest room:
They by thy sword shall be cut off,
and foxes prey become.
Yet shall the King in God rejoice,
and each one glory shall
That swear by him, but stopped shall be
the mouth of liers all.
PSALM. LXIV. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
When I to thee my prayer make,
Lord, to my voice give ear:
My life save from the enemy
of whom I stand in fear.
Me from their secret counsel hide
who do live wickedly;
From insurrection of those men
that work iniquity.
Who do their tongues with malice whet,
and make them cut like swords;
In whose bent bows are arrows set;
even sharp and bitter words:
That they may at the perfect man
in secret aim their shot;
Yea suddenly they dare at him
to shoot and fear it not.
In ill encourage they themselves;
and their snares close to lay
Together conference they have,
Who shall them see? they say.
They have searched out iniquities,
a perfect search they keep:
Of each of them the inward thought,
and very heart is deep.
God shall an arrow shoot at them,
and wound them suddenly.
So their own tongue shall them confound:
all who them see shall fly.
And on all men a fear shall fall;
Gods works they shall declare:
For they shall wisely notice take
what these his doings are.
In God the righteous shall rejoice,
and trust upon his might;
Yea they, shall greatly glory all,
in heart that are upright.
PSALM. LXV. To the chief musician, A Psalm and song of David.
PRaise waits for thee in Sion, Lord;
to thee vows paid shall be.
O thou that hearer art of prayer,
all flesh shall come to thee.
Iniquities, I must confess,
prevail against me do:
But as for our transgressions,
them purge away shall thou.
Blessed is the man whom thou do choose,
and make approach to thee:
That he within thy courts, O Lord,
may still a dweller be:
We surely shall be satisfied
with thy abundant grace,
And with the goodness of thy House,
even of thy holy place.
O God of our salvation,
thou in thy righteousness
By fearful works unto our prayers
thine answer do express:
Therefore the ends of all the earth,
and these afar that be
Upon the sea, their confidence.
O Lord, will place in thee.
Who, being girt with power, sets fast,
by his great strength, the hills.
Who noise of seas, noise of their waves,
and peoples tumult stills.
Those in the utmost parts that dwell
are at thy signs afraid:
Th'outgoings of the morn and even
by thee are joyful made.
The earth thou visit'st watring it,
thou make it rich to grow
With Gods full flood; thou corn prepar'st,
when thou provid'st it so.
Her ridges thou do water much,
her furrows settleft;
With showers thou do her mollify,
her spring by thee is blessed.
So thou the year most liberally
do with thy goodness crown;
And all thy paths abundantly
on us drop fatness down.
They drop upon the pastures wide,
that do in deserts ly:
The little hills on every side
rejoice right pleasantly.
With flocks the pastures clothed be,
the vales with corn are clad;
And now they shout and sing to thee,
for thou have made them glad.
PSALM. LXVI. To the chief musician, A song or psalm.
ALL lands to God in joyful sounds
aloft your voices raise.
Sing forth the honor of his Name,
and glorious make his praise.
Say unto God, How terrible
in all thy works art thou?
Through thy great power thy foes to thee
shall be constrained to bow.
All on the earth shall worship thee,
they shall thy praise proclaim.
In songs: they shall sing cheerfully
unto thy holy Name.
Come, and the works that God has wrought
with admiration see:
In's workings to the sons of men
most terrible is he.
Into dry land the sea he turned,
and they a passage had.
Even marching through the flood on foot,
there we in him were glad.
He rules ever by his power,
his eyes the nations see:
O let not the rebellious ones
lift up themselves on hie.
Ye people bless our God; aloud
the voice speak of his praise.
Our soul in life who safe preserves,
our foot from sliding stays.
For thou did prove, and try us, Lord,
as men do silver try;
Broughtst us into the net, and made
bands on our loins to ly.
Thou have caused men ride over our heads;
and though that we did pass
Through fire and water, yet thou broughtst
us to a wealthy place.
I Will bring burnt-offrings to thy house,
to thee my vows I Will pay,
Which my lips uttered, my mouth spoke
when trouble on me lay.
Burnt-sacrifices of fat rams
with incense I will bring;
Of bullocks and of goats I will
present an offering.
All that fear God come hear, I Will tell
what he did for my soul.
I with my mouth unto him cried
my tongue did him extol.
If in my heart I sin regard,
the Lord me will not hear:
But surely God me heard, and to
my prayers voice gave ear.
O let the Lord, our gracious God,
for ever blessed be,
Who turned not my prayer from him,
nor yet his grace from me.
PSALM. LXVII. To the chief musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or song.
LOrd, bless and pity us,
shine on us with thy face:
That the earth thy way, and nations all
may know thy saving grace,
Let people praise thee, Lord,
let people all thee praise.
O let the nations be glad,
in songs their voices raise:
Thou Wilt justly people judge,
on earth rule nations all.
Let people praise thee, Lord, let them
praise thee both great and small.
The earth her fruit shall yield,
our God shall blessing send.
God shall us bless, men shall him fear,
unto earths utmost end.
Another of the same.
LOrd, unto us be merciful,
do thou us also bless:
And graciously cause shine on us
the brightness of his face.
That so thy way upon the earth
to all men may be known,
Also among the nations all
thy saying health be shown.
O let the people praise thee, Lord,
let people all thee praise.
O let the nations be glad,
and sing for joy always:
For rightly thou shall people judge,
and nations rule on earth.
Let people praise thee, Lord, let all
the folk praise thee with mirth.
Then shall the earth yield her increase,
God, our God bless us shall.
God shall us bless, and of the earth
the ends shall fear him all.
PSALM. LXVIII. To the chief musician, A Psalm or song of David.
LEt God arise, and scattered
let all his enemies be;
And let all those that do him hate
before his presence flee.
As smoke is driven, so drive thou them:
as fire melts wax away,
Before Gods face let wicked men
so perish and decay.
But let the righteous be glad,
let them before Gods sight
Be very joyful, yea let them
rejoice with all their might.
To God sing, to his Name sing praise,
extol him with your voice,
That rides on heaven by his Name JAH,
before his face rejoice.
Because the Lord a Father is
unto the fatherless:
God is the widows judge, within
his place of holiness.
God does the solitary set
in families; and from bands
The chained does free, but rebels do
inhabit parched lands.
O God, what time thou did go forth
before thy peoples face;
And when, through the great wilderness,
thy glorious marching was;
Then at Gods presence shook the earth,
then drops from heaven fell;
This Sinai shook before the Lord,
the God Israel.
O God, thou to thine heritage
did send a plenteous rain;
Whereby thou, when it weary was,
did it refresh again.
Thy congregation then did make
their habitation there:
Of thine own goodness for the poor,
O God, thou did prepare.
The Lord himself did give the word,
the word abroad did spread;
Great was the company of them
the same who published.
Kings of great armies foiled were,
and forced to flee away,
And women, who remained at home,
did distribute the prey.
Though ye have lain among the pots,
like doves ye shall appear;
Whose wings with silver, and with gold
whose feathers covered are.
When there The Almighty scatt'red Kings,
like Salmons snow 'twas white.
Gods hill is like to Bashan hill,
like Bashan hill for hight.
Why do ye leap ye mountains high?
this is the hill where God
Desires to dwell, yea God in it
for ay will make abode.
Gods chariots twenty thousand are,
thousands of Angels strong;
In's holy place God is, as in
mount Sinai, them among.
Thou have, O Lord, most glorious
ascended up on hie,
And in triumph victorious led
captive captivity:
Thou have received gifts for men,
for such as did rebel,
Yea, even for them; that God the Lord
in midst of them might dwell.
Blessed be the Lord, who is to us
of our salvation God,
Who daily with his benefits
us plenteously does load.
He, of salvation is the God,
who is our God most strong*
And unto God the Lord from death
the issues belong.
But surely, God shall wound the head
of those that are his foes;
The hairy scalp of him that still
on in his trespass goes.
God said, my people I will bring
again from Bashan hill;
Yea, from the seas devouring deeps,
them bring again I will.
That in the blood of enemies
thy foot imbrued may be;
And, of thy dogs dipped in the same,
the tongues thou may see.
Thy goings they have seen, O God,
the steps of Majesty
Of my God, and my mighty King,
within the sanctuary.
Before went singers, players next
on instruments took way;
And them among the damsels were
that did on timbrels play.
Within the congregations
bless God with one accord;
From Isra'ls fountain do ye bless
and praise the mighty Lord.
With their Prince little Benjamin,
Princes and council there
Of Judah were, there Zabulons
and Naphtalies Princes were.
Thy God commands thy strength: make strong
what thou wrought'st for us, Lord.
For thy house at Jerusalem
Kings shall thee gifts afford.
The spear-mens host, the multitude
of bulls, which fiercely look,
Those calves which people have forth sent,
O Lord our God rebuke,
Till every one submit himself,
and silver pieces bring:
The people that delight in war
disperse, O God and King.
Those that be Princes great, shall then
come out of Egypt lands,
And Aethiopia to God
shall soon stretch out her hands.
O all ye Kingdoms of the earth,
sing praises to this King;
For he is Lord that rules all,
unto him praises sing.
To him that rides on heavens of heavens
which he of old did found;
Lo, he sends out his voice, a voice
in might that does abound.
Strength unto God do ye ascribe;
for his excellency
Is over Israel, his strength
is in the clouds most hie.
You Are from thy Temple dreadful, Lord;
Isra'ls own God is he
Who gives his people strength, and power:
O let God blessed be.
PSALM. LXIX. To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, A Psalm of David.
SAve me, O God, because the floods
do so environ me,
That even into my very soul
come in the waters be.
I downward in deep mire do sink,
where standing there is none:
I am into deep waters come,
where floods have over me gone.
I weary with my crying am,
my throat is also dried;
Mine eyes do fail, while for my God
I waiting do abide.
Those men that do without a cause
bear hatred unto me
Then are the hairs upon my head,
in number more they be:
They that would me destroy, and are
mine enemies wrongfully
Are mighty: so, what I took not,
to render forced was I.
Lord thou my folly know, my sins
not covered are from thee.
Let none that wait oh thee be shamed,
Lord, God of hosts, for me.
O Lord, the God of Israel,
let none, who search do make
And seek thee, be at any time
confounded for my sake.
For I have born reproach for thee,
my face is hid with shame.
To brethren strange, to mothers sons
an alien I became.
Because the zeal did eat me up
which to thy House I bare;
And the reproaches cast at thee,
upon me fallen are.
My tears and fasts t'afflict my soul
were turned to my shame.
When sackcloth I did wear, to them
a proverb I became.
The men, that in the gate do sit,
against me evil spoke;
They also, that vile drunkards were,
of me their song did make.
But in an acceptable time
my prayer, Lord, is to thee:
In truth of thy salvation, Lord,
and mercy great, hear me.
Deliver me out of the mire,
from sinking do me keep;
Free me from those that do me hate,
and from the waters deep.
Let not the flood on me prevail,
whose water overflows;
Nor deep me swallow, nor the pit
her mouth upon me close.
Hear me, O Lord, because thy love
and kindness is most good;
Turn unto me, according to
thy mercies multitude.
Nor from thy servant hide thy face,
I Am troubled, soon attend.
Draw near my soul, and it redeem,
me from my foes defend.
To thee is my reproach well known,
my shame, and my disgrace:
Those that mine adversaries be,
are all before thy face.
Reproach has broke my heart, I Am full
of grief; I looked for one
To pity me, but none I found;
comforters found I none.
They also bitter gall did give
unto me for my meat:
They gave me vinegar to drink,
when as my thirst was great.
Before them let their table prove
a snare; and do thou make
Their welfare and prosperity
a trap, themselves to take.
Let thou their eyes so darkened be,
that sight may them forsake;
And let their loins be made by thee
continually to shake.
Thy fury pour thou out on them,
and indignation;
And let thy wrathful anger, Lord,
fast hold take them upon.
All waste and desolate let be
their habitation,
And in their tabernacles all
inhabitants be none.
Because him they do persecute,
whom thou did smite before;
They talk unto the grief of those
whom thou have wounded sore.
Add thou iniquity unto
their former wickedness:
And do not let them come at all
into thy righteousness.
Out of the book of life let them
be razed, and blotted quite;
Among the just and righteous
let not their names be writ.
But now, become exceeding poor,
and sorrowful am I:
By thy salvation, O my God,
let me be set on hie.
The Name of God, I, with a song,
most cheerfully will praise;
And I, in giving thanks to him,
his Name shall highly raise.
This to the Lord a sacrifice
more gracious shall prove,
Then bullock, ox, or any beast
that has both horn and hoof.
When this the humble men shall see,
it joy to them shall give:
O all ye, that do seek the Lord,
your heart shall ever live.
For, God the poor hears, and will not
his prisoners contemn.
Let heaven, and earth, and seas him praise,
and all that move in them.
For God will Judah's cities build,
and He will Sion save;
That they may dwell therein, and it
in sure possession have.
And they that are his servants seed,
inherit shall the same;
So shall they have their dwelling there,
that love his blessed Name.
PSALM. LXX. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.
LOrd, haste me to deliver,
with speed, Lord, succor me.
Let them, that for my soul do seek,
shamed and confounded be:
Turned back be they and shamed,
that in my hurt delight.
Turned back be they, Ha ha that say,
their shaming to requite.
In thee let all be glad,
and joy that seek for thee:
Let them, who thy salvation love,
say still, God praised be.
I poor and needy am,
come, Lord, and make no stay:
My help thou and deliverer art,
O Lord, make no delay.
Another of the same.
MAke haste, O God, me to preserve,
with speed, Lord, succor me.
Let them that for my soul do seek
shamed and confounded be:
Let them be turned back and shamed,
that in my hurt delight.
Turned back be they, Ha ha that say,
their shaming to requite.
O Lord, in thee let all be glad,
and joy that seek for thee:
Let them, who thy salvation love,
say still, God praised be.
But I both poor and needy am:
come, Lord, and make no stay:
My help thou and deliverer art,
O Lord, make no delay.
PSALM. LXXI.
O Lord, my hope and confidence
is placed in thee alone:
Then let thy servant never be
put to confusion.
And let me, in thy righteousness,
from thee deliverance have;
Cause me escape, incline thine ear
unto me, and me save.
Be thou my dwelling rock, to which
I ever may resort:
Thou gav'st commandment me to save,
for you are my rock and fort.
Free me, my God, from wicked hands,
hands cruel and unjust.
For thou, O Lord God, art my hope,
and, from my youth, my trust.
Thou from the womb did hold me up:
thou art the same that me
Out of my mothers bowels took,
I ever will praise thee.
To many I a wonder am;
but you are my refuge strong.
Filled let my mouth be with thy praise,
and honor, all day long.
O do not cast me off, when as
old age does overtake me;
And, when my strength decayed is,
then do not Thou forsake me.
For those that are mine enemies,
against me speak with hate:
And, they together counsel take
that for my soul lay wait.
They said, God leaves him; him pursue
and take; none will him save.
Be Thou not far from me, my God:
thy speedy help I crave.
Confound, consume them, that unto
my soul are enemies:
Clothed be they with reproach and shame,
that do my hurt devise.
But I with expectation
will hope continually;
And yet with praises more and more
I will thee magnify.
Thy justice and salvation
my mouth abroad shall show,
Even all the day; for I thereof
the numbers do not know.
And I will constantly go on
in strength of God, the Lord:
And thine own righteousness, even thine
alone, I will record.
For, even from my youth, O God,
by Thee I have been taught;
And hitherto I have declared
the wonders Thou have wrought.
And now, Lord, leave me not, when I
old and gray headed grow;
Till to this age thy strength and power,
to all to come I show.
And thy most perfect righteousness,
O Lord, is very high,
Who have so great things done: O God,
who is like unto Thee?
Thou Lord, who great adversities,
and sore to me did show,
Shall quicken, and bring me again
from depths of earth below.
My greatness, and my power thou will
increase and far extend:
On every side, against all grief,
thou will me comfort send.
Thee, even thy truth I Will also praise,
my God, with psalterie:
Thou holy One of Israel,
with harp I Will sing to Thee.
My lips shall much rejoice in Thee,
when I thy praises sound:
My soul, which Thou redeemed have,
in joy shall much abound.
My tongue thy justice shall proclaim,
continuing all day long;
For they confounded are, and shamed,
that seek to do me wrong.
PSALM. LXXII. A Psalm for Solomon.
O Lord, thy judgments give the King,
his son thy righteousness.
With right he shall thy people judge,
thy poor with uprightness.
The lofty mountains shall bring forth
unto the people peace;
Likewise the little hills the same
shall do by righteousness.
The peoples poor ones he shall judge,
the needies children save:
And those shall he in pieces break
who them oppressed have.
They shall thee fear, while sun and moon
do last, through ages all.
Like rain on mown grass he shall drop,
or showers on earth that fall.
The just shall flourish in his days,
and prosper in his reign:
He shall, while does the moon endure,
abundant peace maintain
His large and great dominion shall
from sea to sea extend,
It from the river shall reach forth
unto earths utmost end.
They, in the wilderness that dwell,
bow down before him must:
And they, that are his enemies,
shall lick the very dust.
The Kings of Tarshish, and the Isles
to him shall presents bring;
And unto him shall offer gifts
Sheba's and Seba's King.
Yea, all the mighty Kings on earth
before him down shall fall:
And all the nations of the world
do service to him shall.
For He the needy shall preserve,
when he to Him does call;
The poor also, and him that has
no help of man at all.
The poor man and the indigent
in mercy He shall spare:
He shall preserve alive the souls
of those that needy are.
Both from deceit and violence,
their soul He shall set free;
And in His sight right precious
and dear their blood shall be.
Yea, He shall live, and given to Him
shall be of Sheba's gold;
For Him still shall they pray, and He
shall daily be extolled.
Of corn an handful in the earth
on tops of mountains high,
With prosperous fruit shall shake, like trees
on Lebanon that be.
The city shall be flourishing,
her citizens abound
In number shall, like to the grass
that grows upon the ground,
His Name for ever shall endure,
last like the sun it shall:
Men shall be blessed in Him, and blessed
all nations shall Him call.
Now blessed be the Lord, our God,
the God of Israel,
For He alone does wondrous works,
in glory that excel.
And blessed be His glorious Name
to all eternity;
The whole earth let His glory fill:
Amen, so let it be.
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
PSALM. LXXIII. A Psalm of Asaph.
YEt God is good to Israel,
to each pure hearted one.
But as for me, my steps near slipped,
my feet were almost gone.
For I envious was, and grudged
the foolish folk to see,
When I perceived the wicked sort
enjoy prosperity.
For still their strength continues firm,
their death of bands is free:
They are not toiled as other men,
nor plagued as others be:
Therefore, their pride, like to a chain,
them compasses about;
And, as a garment, violence
does cover them throughout.
Their eyes stand out with fat, they have
more then their hearts could wish.
They are corrupt, their talk of wrong
both lewd and lofty is.
They set their mouth against the heavens,
in their blasphemous talk;
And their reproaching tongue throughout
the earth at large does walk.
His people oftentimes for this
look back, and turn about,
Since waters of so full a cup
to these are poured out.
And thus they say, How can it be
that God these things does know?
Or, can there in the Highest be
knowledge of things below?
Behold, these are the wicked ones,
yet prosper at their will
In worldly things, they do increase
in wealth and riches still.
I verily have done in vain
my heart to purify:
To no effect in innocence
washed my hands have I.
For daily, and all day throughout
great plagues I suffered have;
Yea, every morning I of new
did chastisement receive.
If in this manner foolishly
to speak I would intend,
Thy childrens generation
behold I should offend.
When I this thought to know, it was
too hard a thing for me,
Till to Gods Sanctuary I went,
then I their end did see.
Assuredly thou did them set
a slippery place upon:
Them suddenly thou castedst down
into destruction.
How in a moment, suddenly
to ruin brought are they!
With fearful terrors utterly
they are consumed away.
Even like unto a dream, when one
from sleeping does arise;
So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st,
their image shall despise.
Thus grieved was my heart in me,
and me my reins oppressed.
So rude was I, and ignorant,
and in thy sight a beast.
Nevertheless continually,
O Lord, I am with thee:
Thou do me hold by my right hand,
and still upholdest me.
Thou, with thy counsel, while I live,
wilt me conduct and guide;
And to thy glory afterward
receive me, to abide.
Whom have I in the heavens high,
but thee, O Lord, alone?
And in the earth, whom I desire
beside thee, there is none.
My flesh and heart does faint and fail,
but God does fail me never;
For of my heart God is the strength,
and portion for ever.
For lo, those that are far from thee,
they quickly perish shall:
Them, that a-whoring from thee go,
thou have destroyed all.
But surely it is good for me,
that I draw near to God:
In God I trust, that all thy works
I may declare abroad.
PSALM. LXXIV. Maschil of Asaph.
O God, why have thou cast us off?
is it for evermore?
Against thy pasture sheep why does
thine anger smoke so sore?
O call to thy rememberance
thy congregation,
Which thou have purchased of old;
still think the same upon.
The rod of thine inheritance,
which thou redeemed have,
This Sion hill, wherein thou had,
thy dwelling in times past.
To these long desolations
thy feet lift, do not tarry;
For all the ills thy foes have done
within thy Sanctuary.
Amidst thy congregations
thine enemies do roar:
Their ensigns they set up, for signs
of triumph, thee before.
A man was famous, and was had
in estimation,
According as he lifted up
his axe thick trees upon.
But all at once with axes now
and hammers they go to,
And down the carved work thereof
they break, and quite undo.
They fired have thy Sanctuary,
and have defiled the same,
By casting down unto the ground
the place where dwelt thy Name.
Thus said they in their hearts, Let us
destroy them out of hand:
They burnt up all the Synagogues
of God, within the land.
Our signs we do not now behold;
there is not us among
A prophet more, nor any one
that knows the time how long.
How long, Lord, shall the enemy
thus in reproach exclaim?
And shall the adversary thus
always blaspheme thy Name?
Thy hand, even thy right hand of might,
why do thou thus draw back?
O from thy bosom pluck it out
for our deliverance sake.
For certainly God is my King,
even from the times of old,
Working in midst of all the earth
salvation manifold.
The sea, by thy great power to part
asunder, thou did make;
And thou the dragons heads, O Lord,
within the waters brake.
The Leviathans heads thou brake
in pieces, and did give
Him to be meat unto the folk
in wilderness that live.
Thou clave the fountain and the flood,
which did with streams abound:
Thou dry'dst the mighty waters up
unto the very ground.
Thine only is the day, O Lord,
thine also is the night;
And thou alone prepared have
the sun and shining light.
By thee the borders of the earth
were settled every where:
The summer and the winter both
by thee created were.
That the enemy reproached has,
O keep it in record;
And that the foolish people have
blasphemed thy Name, O Lord.
Unto the multitude do not
thy turtles soul deliver;
The congregation of thy poor
do not forget for ever.
Unto thy covenant have respect:
for earths dark places be
Full of the habitations
of horrid cruelty.
O let not those that be oppressed
return again with shame:
Let those that poor and needy are
give praise unto thy Name.
Do thou, O God, arise and plead
the cause, that is thine own:
Remember how thou art reproacht
still by the foolish one.
Do not forget the voice of those
that are thine enemies:
Of those the tumult ever grows
that do against thee rise.
PSALM. LXXXV. To the chief musician Al-taschith, A psalm or song of Asaph.
TO thee, O God, do we give thanks,
we do give thanks to thee:
Because thy wondrous works declare
thy great Name near to be.
I purpose, when I shall receive
the congregation,
That I shall judgment uprightly
render to every one.
Dissolved is the land, with all
that in the same do dwell;
But I the pillars thereof do
bear up and stablish well.
I, to the foolish people said,
Do not deal foolishly;
And unto those that wicked are,
Lift not your horn on hie.
Lift not your horn on high, nor speak
with stubborn neck: but know,
That nor from East, nor West, nor South
promotion does flow.
But God is Judge: He puts down one,
and sets another up.
For in the hand of God most high
of red wine is a cup;
It Is full of mixture; he pours forth,
and makes the wicked all
Wring out the bitter dregs thereof,
yea, and they drink them shall.
But I, for ever will declare,
I Jacobs God will praise.
All horns of lewd men I Will cut off;
but just men's horns will raise.
PSALM. LXXVI. To the chief musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or song of Asaph.
IN Judah's land God is well known,
his Name's in Israel great:
In Salem is his Tabernacle,
in Sion is his Seat.
There arrows of the bow he brake,
the shield, the sword, the war.
More glorious thou then hills of prey,
more excellent art far.
Those that were stout of heart are spoiled,
they slept their sleep outright;
And none of those their hands did find
that were the men of might.
When thy rebuke, O Jacobs God,
had forth against them past,
Their horses and their chariots both
were in a dead sleep cast.
Thou, Lord, even thou art He that should
be feared, and who is he
That may stand up before thy sight,
if once thou angry be?
From heaven thou judgment caused be heard;
the earth was still with fear,
When God to judgment rose, to save
all meek on earth that were.
Surely the very wrath of man
unto thy praise redounds:
Thou to the remnant of his wrath
wilt set restraining bounds.
Vow to the Lord, your God, and pay;
all ye that near Him be
Bring gifts and presents unto Him,
for to be feared is He.
By Him the spirits shall be cut off
of those that princes are:
Unto the Kings that are on earth
He fearful does appear.
PSALM. LXXVII. To the chief musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.
UNto the Lord I with my voice,
I unto God did cry
Even with my voice, and unto me
his ear he did apply.
I in my trouble sought the Lord;
my sore by night did run,
And ceased not: my grieved soul
did consolation shun.
I to remembrance God did call,
yet trouble did remain;
And overwhelmed my spirit was
whiles I did sore complain.
Mine eyes debarred from rest and sleep,
thou make still to wake:
My trouble is so great, that I
unable am to speak.
The days of old to mind I called,
and often did think upon
The times and ages, that are past
full many years agone.
By night my song I call to mind,
and commune with my heart,
My sp'rit did carefully inquire
how I might ease my smart.
For ever will the Lord cast off?
and gracious be no more?
For ever is his mercy gone?
fails his word evermore?
Is It true that to be gracious
the Lord forgotten has?
And that his tender mercies He
has shut up in his wrath?
Then did I say, that surely this
is mine infirmity:
I Will mind the years of the right hand
of Him that is most hie.
Yea, I remember will the works
performed by the Lord;
The wonders done of old by thee
I surely will record.
I also will of all thy works
my meditation make,
And of thy doings to discourse
great pleasure I will take.
O God, thy way most holy is
within thy Sanctuary:
And what God is so great in power,
as is our God most hie?
Thou art the God that wonders do
by thy right hand most strong;
Thy mighty power thou have declared
the nations among.
To thine own people with thine arm
thou did redemption bring;
To Jacobs sons, and to the Tribes
of Joseph that do spring.
The waters, Lord, perceived thee,
the waters saw thee well;
And they for fear aside did fly;
the depths on trembling fell.
The clouds in water forth were poured,
sound loudly did the sky;
And swiftly through the world abroad
thine arrows fierce did fly.
Thy thunders voice along the heaven
a mighty noise did make:
By lightnings lightened was the world,
the earth tremble did and shake.
Thy way is in the sea, and in
the waters great thy path;
Yet are thy footsteps hid, O Lord,
none knowledge thereof has.
Thy people thou did safely lead
like to a flock of sheep,
By Moses hand and Aarons Thou
did them conduct and keep.
PSALM. LXXVIII. Maschil of Asaph.
A Trend, my people, to my Law,
thereto give thou an ear:
The words that from my mouth proceed
attentively do hear.
My mouth shall speak a parable,
and sayings dark of old:
The same which we have heard, and known,
and us our fathers told.
We also will them not conceal
from their posterity:
Them to the generation
to come declare will we:
The praises of the Lord our God,
and His Almighty strength,
The wondrous works that He has done
we will show forth at length.
His testimony and His law
in Israel He did place,
And charged, our fathers, it to show
to their succeeding race.
That so the race, which was to come,
might well them learn and know;
And sons unborn, who should arise,
might to their sons them show:
That they might set their hope in God,
and suffer not to fall
His mighty works out of their mind,
but keep His precepts all.
And might not, like their fathers, be
a stiff rebellious race,
A race not right in heart; with God
whose sp'rit not steadfast was.
The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows
nor other arms did lack,
When as the day of battle was
they faintly turned back.
They brake Gods covenant, and refused
in His commands to go.
His works and wonders they forgot,
which He to them did show.
Things mavelous He brought to pass,
their fathers them beheld,
Within the land of Egypt done,
yea even in Zoans field.
By Him divided was the sea,
He caused them through to pass;
And He the water made to stand,
that like an heap it was.
With cloud by day, with light of fire
all night he did them guide.
In desert rocks He clave and drink
as from great depths supplied.
He from the rock brought streams, like floods
made waters to run down.
Yet sinning more, in desert they
provoked the Highest One.
For, in their heart they tempted God:
and speaking with mistrust,
They greedily did meat require
to satisfy their lust.
Against the Lord himself they spoke,
and murmuring said thus,
A table in the wilderness
can God prepare for us?
Behold, He smote the rock, and thence
came streams and waters great;
But can He give His people bread?
and send them flesh to eat?
The Lord did hear, and waxed wroth,
so kindled was a flame
Against Jacob; and against Israel
up indignation came:
For they believed not God, nor trust
in His salvation had:
Though floods above He did command,
and heavens doors open made;
And Manna rained on them, and gave
them corn of heaven to eat.
Man Angels food did eat, to them
He to the full sent meat.
And in the heaven He did cause
an Eastern wind to blow;
And by his power He let out
the Southern wind to go.
Then flesh, as thick as dust, He made
to rain down them among;
And feathered fowls, like as the sand
which ly'th the shore along.
At his command amidst their camp
these showers of flesh down fell,
All round about the tabernacles
and tents where they did dwell.
So did they eat abundantly,
and had of meat their fill;
For He did give to them what was
their own desire and will.
They from their lust had not estranged
their heart and their desire;
But while the meat was in their mouth,
which they did so require,
Gods wrath upon them came, and slew
the fattest of them all;
So that the choice of Israel,
overthrown by death, did fall.
Yet notwithstanding of all this,
they sinned still the more;
And, though He had great wonders wrought,
believed Him not therefore.
Wherefore their days in vanity
He did consume and wast,
And by His wrath their wretched years
away in trouble past.
But when He slew them, then they did
to seek Him show desire:
Yea, they returned, and after God
right early did inquire.
And that the Lord had been their Rock
they did remember then:
Even that the high Almighty God
had their Redeemer been.
Yet with their mouth they flattered Him,
and spoke but fainedly,
And they unto the God of truth
with their false tongues did ly.
For, though their words were good, their heart
with Him was not sincere:
Unstedfast and perfidious
they in his covenant were.
But full of pity, He forgave
their sin, them did not slay;
Nor stirred up all His wrath, but often
his anger turned away.
For that they were but fading flesh
to mind He did recall;
A wind that passes soon away,
and not returns at all.
How often did they Him provoke
within the wilderness?
And in the desert did Him grieve
with their rebelliousnesse?
Yea, turning back they tempted God,
and limits set upon
Him who in midst of Israel is
the only Holy One.
They did not call to mind His power;
nor yet the day when He
Delivered them out of the hand
of their fierce enemy.
Nor how great signs in Egypt land
He openly had wrought,
What miracles in Zoans field
His hand to pass had brought.
How lakes and rivers every where
He turned into blood;
So that nor man, nor beast could drink
of standing lake or flood.
He brought among them swarms of flies,
which did them sore annoy;
And diverse kinds of filthy frogs
He sent, them to destroy.
He to the caterpiller gave
the fruits of all their soil:
Their labors He delivered up
unto the locusts spoil.
Their vines with hail, their sycomors
He with the frost did blast.
Their beasts to hail He gave, their flocks
hot thunderbolts did wast.
Fierce burning wrath He on them cast,
and indignation strong,
And troubles sore, by sending forth
ill angels them among.
He to His wrath made way: their soul
from death He did not save;
But over to the pestilence
the life's of them He gave.
In Egypt Land the firstborn all
He smote down every where;
Amongst the tents of Ham, even these
chief of their strength that were.
But His own people like to sheep
thence to go forth He made;
And He amidst the wilderness
them, as a flock, did lead.
And He them safely on did lead,
so that they did not fear:
Whereas their enemies by the sea
quite overwhelmed were.
To borders of His Sanctuary
the Lord his people led,
Even to the mount, which His right hand
for them had purchased.
The nations of Canaan
by His Almighty hand
Before their face He did expel
out of their native land,
Which for inheritance to them
by line He did divide,
And made the tribes of Israel
within their tents abide.
Yet God most high they did provoke,
and tempted ever still,
And to observe His testimonies
did not incline their will.
But like their fathers turned back,
and dealt unfaithfully:
Aside they turned, like a bow
that shoots deceitfully.
For, they to anger did provoke
Him with their places hie;
And with their graven images
moved Him to jealousy.
When God heard this, He waxed wroth,
and much loathed Israel then:
So Shilohs tent He left, the tent
which He had placed with men:
And He his strength delivered
into captivity,
He left his glory in the hand
of his proud enemy.
His people also He gave over
unto the swords fierce rage:
So sore His wrath inflamed was
against his heritage.
The fire consumed their choice young men:
their maids no marriage had.
And when their priests fell by the sword,
their wives no mourning made.
But then the Lord arose, as one
that does from sleep awake;
And like a giant, that by wine
refresht, a shout does make.
Upon his enemies hinder parts
He made his stroke to fall;
And so upon them He did put
a shame perpetual.
Moreover, He the tabernacle
of Joseph did refuse;
The mighty tribe of Ephraim
He would in no wise choose.
But He did choose Jehudahs tribe
to be the rest above,
And of mount Sion He made choice,
which He so much did love.
And He his Sanctuary built,
like to a palace hie,
Like to the earth, which He did found
to perpetuity.
Of David, that his servant was,
He also choice did make;
And even from the folds of sheep
was pleased him to take.
From waiting on the ews with young,
He brought him for to feed
Israel, His inheritance,
His people Jacobs seed.
So after the integrity
of his heart He them fed;
And by the good skill of His hands
them wisely governed.
PSALM. LXXIX. A Psalm of Asaph.
O God, the heathen entered have
Thine heritage, by them
Defiled is Thy house; on heaps
they laid Jerusalem.
The bodies of thy servants they
have cast forth to be meat
To ravenous fowls, thy dear saints flesh
they give to beasts, to eat.
Their blood about Jerusalem
like water have they shed;
And there was none to bury them
when they were slain and dead.
Unto our neighbors a reproach
most base become are we;
A scorn and laughing stock to them
that round about us be.
How long, Lord, shall thine anger last?
will thou still keep the same?
And shall thy fervent jealousy
burn, like unto a flame?
On heathens pour thy fury forth,
that have thee never known,
And on these kingdoms which thy Name
have never called upon.
For these are they which Jacob have
devoured cruelly,
And they his habitation
have caused waste to ly.
Against us mind not former sins:
thy tender mercies show,
Let them prevent us speedily,
for we are brought very low.
For thy Names glory help us, Lord,
who have our Savior bin:
Deliver us; for thy Names sake
O purge away our sin.
Why say the heathen, Where Is their God?
let Him to them be known,
When these, who shed thy servants blood,
are in our sight overthrown.
O let the prisoners sighs ascend
before thy sight on hie:
Preserve those in thy mighty power,
that are designed to die.
And to our neighbors bosom cause
it sevenfold rendered be,
Even the reproach, wherewith they have,
O Lord, reproached thee.
So we thy folk, and pasture-sheep,
shall give thee thanks always,
And unto generations all
we will show forth thy praise.
PSALM. LXXX. To the chief musician upon Shoshannim Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph.
HEar, Isreal's Shepherd, like a flock
thou that do Joseph guide;
Shine forth, O thou that do between
the cherubims abide.
In Ephraims and Benjamins,
and in Manassehs sight,
O come for our salvation,
stir up thy strength and might.
Turn us again, O Lord, our God,
and upon us vouchsafe
To make thy countenance to shine,
and so we shall be safe.
O Lord of hosts, Almighty God,
how long shall kindled be
Thy wrath against the prayer made
by thine own folk to thee?
Thou tears of sorrow gives to them,
in stead of bread, to eat;
Yea, tears in stead of drink thou gives
to them in measure great.
Thou make us a strife unto
our neighbors round about:
Our enemies among themselves
at us do laugh and flout.
Turn us again, O God of hosts,
and upon us vouchsafe
To make thy countenance to shine,
and so we shall be safe.
A vine from Egypt brought thou have,
by thine outstretched hand:
And thou the heathen out did cast,
to plant it in their land.
Before it thou a room did make,
where it might grow and stand;
Thou causedst it deep root to take,
and it did fill the land.
The mountains veiled were with its shade,
as with a covering:
Like goodly Cedars were the boughs,
which out from it did spring.
Upon the one hand, to the sea
her boughs she did out send;
On the other side, unto the flood
her branches did extend.
Why have thou then thus broken down
and taken her hedge away?
So that all passengers do pluck,
and make of her a prey.
The boar who from the forest comes
does waste it at his pleasure:
The wild beast of the field also
devoures it out of measure.
O God of hosts, we thee beseech
return now unto thine;
Look down from heaven in love, behold
and visit this thy vine:
This vineyard which thine own right hand
has planted us among:
And that same branch, which for thy self
thou have made to be strong.
Burnt up it is with flaming fire,
it also is cut down:
They utterly are perished
when as thy face does frown.
O let thy hand be still upon
the man of thy right hand;
The son of man, whom for thy self
thou made strong to stand.
So henceforth we will not go back,
nor turn from thee at all:
O do thou quicken us, and we
upon thy Name will call.
Turn us again, Lord God of hosts,
and upon us vouchsafe
To make thy countenance to shine,
and so we shall be safe.
PSALM. LXXXI. To the chief musician upon Gittith A Psalm of Asaph.
SIng loud to God, our strength; with joy
to Jacobs God do sing.
Take up a psalm, the pleasant harp,
timbrell and psaltry bring.
Blow trumpets at new moon, what day
our feast appointed is;
For charge to Israel, and a Law
of Jacobs God was this.
To Joseph this a testimony
He made, when Egypt land
He traveled through, where speech I heard
I did not understand.
His shoulder I from burdens took,
his hands from pots did free.
Thou did in trouble on me call,
and I delivered thee:
In secret place of thundering
I did thee answer make;
And at the streams of Meribah,
of thee a proof did take,
O thou, my people, give an ear,
I Will testify to thee;
To thee, O Israel, if thou will
but hearken unto me.
In midst of thee there shall not be
any strange god at all;
Nor unto any god unknown,
thou bowing down shall fall.
I am the Lord thy God, which did
from Egypt land thee guide:
I Will fill thy mouth abundantly,
do thou it open wide.
But yet my people to my voice
would not attentive be;
And even may chosen Israel
he would have none of Me.
So to the lust of their own hearts
I them delivered:
And then in counsels of their own
they vainly wandered.
O that my people had me heard,
Israel My ways had chose!
I had their enemies soon subdued,
my hand turned on their foes.
The haters of the Lord, to Him
submission should have feigned;
But as for them, their time should have
for evermore remained.
He should have also fed them with
the finest of the wheat:
Of honey from the rock, thy fill
I should have made thee eat.
PSALM. LXXXII. A Psalm of Asaph.
IN gods assembly GOD does stand;
He judges gods among.
How long, accepting persons vile,
will ye give judgment wrong?
Defend the poor and fatherless,
to poor oppressed do right.
The poor and needy ones set free,
rid them from ill men's might.
They know not, nor will understand,
in darkness they walk on:
All the foundations of the earth
out of their course are gone.
I said that you are gods, and are
sons of the Highest all;
But ye shall die like men, and as
one of the princes fall.
O God, do thou raise up thy self,
the earth to judgment call:
For thou, as thine inheritance,
shall take the nations all.
PSALM. LXXXIII. A song or Psalm of Asaph.
KEep not, O God, we thee entreat,
O keep not silence now:
Do thou not hold thy peace, O God,
and still no more be thou.
For lo, thine enemies a noise
tumultuously have made;
And they that haters are of thee,
have lifted up the head.
Against thy chosen people they
do crafty counsel take;
And they against thy hidden ones
do consultations make.
Come, let us cut them off, said they,
from being a nation;
That of the name of Israel may
no more be mention.
For with joint heart they plot, in league
against thee they combine.
The tents of Edom, Ishmaelites,
Moabs, and Hagars line.
Gebal and Ammon, Amalek,
Philistines, those of Tire;
And Assure joined with them, to help
Lots children they conspire.
Do to them as to Midian,
Jabin at Kison-strand;
And Sisera, which at Endor fell,
as dung to fat the land.
Like Oreb, and like Zeeb make
their noble men to fall*
Like Zeba, and Zalmunna-like,
make thou their princes all:
Who said, For our possession
let us Gods houses take.
My God, them like a wheel, as chaff
before the wind, them make.
As fire consumes a wood, as flame
does mountains set on fire;
Chase and affright them with the storm
and tempest of thine ire.
Their faces fill with shame, O Lord,
that they may seek thy Name.
Let them confounded be, and vexed,
and perish in their shame.
That men may know, that Thou, to whom
alone does appertain
The Name JEHOVAH, do most high
over all the earth remain.
PSALM. LXXXIV. To the chief musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of
Korah.
HOw lovely is thy dwelling place,
O Lord of hosts, to me!
The Tabernacles of thy grace
how pleasant, Lord, they be!
My thirsty soul longs vehemently,
yea, faints thy Courts to see:
My very heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for thee.
Behold, the sparrow finds out
an house wherein to rest:
The swallow also for her self
has purchased a nest:
Even thine own altars, where she safe
her young ones forth may bring,
O thou Almighty, Lord of hosts,
who art my God, and King.
Blessed are they in thy House that dwell,
they ever give thee praise.
Blessed is the man whose strength thou art,
in whose heart are thy ways.
Who passing through Baca's dry vale,
therein do dig up wells;
Also the rain that falls down
the pools with water fills.
So they from strength unwearied go
still forward unto strength,
Until in Zion they appear
before the Lord at length.
Lord God of hosts, my prayer hear,
O Jacobs God, give ear.
See God, our shield, look on the face
of thine anointed dear.
For in thy Courts one day excells
a thousand; rather in
My Gods house will I keep a door,
then dwell in tents of sin.
For, God the Lord's a sun and shield:
He Will grace and glory give;
And will withhold no good from them
that uprightly do live.
O thou that art the Lord of hosts,
that man is truly blessed,
Who by assured confidence
on thee alone does rest.
PSALM. LXXXV. To the chief musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
O Lord, thou have been favorable
to thy beloved Land:
Jacobs captivity thou have
recalled with mighty hand.
Thou pardoned thy people have
all their iniquities,
Thou all their trespasses and sins
have covered from thine eyes.
Thou tookst off all thine ire, and turn'dst
from thy wraths furiousness.
Turn us, God of our health, and cause
thy wrath against us to cease.
Shall thy displeasure thus endure
against us without end?
Will thou to generations all
thine anger forth extend?
That in thee may thy people joy,
will thou not us revive?
Show us thy mercy, Lord, to us
do thy salvation give.
I Will hear what God, the Lord; will speak:
to his folk He Will speak peace,
And to His saints; but let them not
return to foolishness.
To them that fear Him, surely near
is His salvation;
That glory in our land may have
her habitation.
Truth met with mercy, righteousness
and peace kissed mutually.
Truth springs from earth, and righteousness
looks down from heaven hie.
Yea, what is good the Lord shall give:
our land shall yield increase.
Justice, to set us in His steps,
shall go before His face.
PSALM. LXXXVI. A Prayer of David.
O Lord, do thou bow down thine ear,
and hear me graciously;
Because I sore afflicted am,
and am in poverty.
Because I Am holy, let my soul
by thee preserved be:
O thou my God, thy servant save
that puts his trust in thee.
Since unto thee I daily cry,
be merciful to me.
Rejoice thy servants soul: for, Lord,
I lift my soul to thee.
For thou art gracious, O Lord,
and ready to forgive,
And rich in mercy, all that call
upon thee, to relieve.
Hear, Lord, my prayer; unto the voice
of my request attend.
In troublous times I Will call on thee,
for thou will answer send.
Lord, there is none among the gods
that may with thee compare;
And like the works which thou have done
not any work is there.
All nations, whom thou made, shall come
and worship reverently
Before thy face; and they, O Lord,
thy Name shall glorify.
Because thou art exceeding great,
and works by thee are done,
Which are to be admired; and thou
art God thy self alone.
Teach me thy way, and in thy truth,
O Lord, then walk will I:
Unite my heart, that I thy Name
may fear continually.
O Lord, my God, with all my heart
to thee I will give praise;
And I the glory will ascribe
unto thy Name always.
Because thy mercy toward me
in greatness does excel;
And thou delivered have my soul
out from the lowest hell.
O God, the proud against me rise,
and violent men have met,
That for my soul have sought; and thee
before them have not set.
But thou art full of pity, Lord,
a God most gracious,
Long-suffering, and in thy truth
and mercy plenteous.
O turn to me thy countenance,
and mercy on me have:
Thy servant strengthen, and the son
of thine own handmaid save.
Show me a sign for good, that they
which do me hate, may see,
And be ashamed; because thou, Lord,
did help and comfort me.
PSALM. LXXXVII. A Psalm or song for the sons of Korah.
UPon the hills of holiness
He his foundation sets.
God, more then Jacobs dwellings all,
delights in Zions gates.
Things glorious are said of thee,
thou City of the Lord.
Rahab and Babel I, to those
that know me, will record:
Behold even Tyrus, and with it
the land of Palestine,
And likewise AEthiopia;
this man was born therein.
And it of Zion shall be said,
This man, and that man there
Was born; and He that is most high
himself shall stablish her.
When God the people writes, He Will count
that this man born was there.
There be that sing, and play; and all
my well-springs in thee are.
PSALM. LXXXVIII. A song or psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief musician
upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.
LOrd God, my Savior, day and night
before thee cried have I.
Before thee let my prayer come,
give ear unto my cry.
For troubles great do fill my soul:
my life draws nigh the grave.
I Am counted with those that go down
to pit, and no strength have.
Even free among the dead, like them
that slain in grave do ly,
Cut off from thy hand, whom no more
thou have in memory.
Thou have me laid in lowest pit,
in deeps, and darksome caves.
Thy wrath lies hard on me, thou have
me pressed with all thy waves.
Thou have put far from me my friends,
thou made them to abhor me;
And I am so shut up, that I
find no evasion for me.
By reason of affliction
mine eye mourns dolefully:
To thee, Lord, do I call, and stretch
my hands continually.
Will thou show wonders to the dead?
shall they rise and thee bless?
Shall in the grave thy love be told?
in death thy faithfulness?
Shall thy great wonders in the dark,
or shall thy righteousness
Be known to any in the land
of deep forgetfulness?
But, Lord, to thee I cried, my prayer
at morn prevent shall thee.
Why, Lord, do thou cast off my soul?
and hid'st thy face from me?
Distressed am I, and from my youth
I ready am to die;
Thy terrors I have born, and am
distracted fearfully.
The dreadful fierceness of thy wrath
quite over me does go:
Thy terrors great have cut me off,
they did pursue me so.
For round about me every day
like water, they did roll:
And gathering together, they
have compassed my soul.
My friend thou have put far from me,
and him that did me love;
And those that mine acquaintance were
to darkness did remove.
PSALM. LXXXIX. Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
GOds mercies I will ever sing,
and with my mouth I shall
Thy faithfulness make to be known
to generations all.
For mercy shall be built, said I,
for ever to endure.
Thy faithfulness even in the heavens
thou will establish sure.
I with my chosen one have made
a covenant graciously;
And to My servant whom I loved,
to David sworn have I:
That I thy seed establish shall
for ever to remain;
And will to generations all
thy Throne build and maintain.
The praises of thy wonders, Lord,
the heavens shall express;
And in the congregation
of saints, thy faithfulness.
For who in heaven with the Lord
may once himself compare?
Who is like God among the sons
of those that mighty are?
Great fear in meetings of the saints
is due unto the Lord;
And He, of all about Him, should
with reverence be adored.
O thou that art the Lord of hosts,
what Lord in mightiness
Is like to thee? who compast round
art with thy faithfulness.
Even in the raging of the sea
thou over it do reign;
And when the waves thereof do swell,
thou stillest them again.
Rahab in pieces thou did break,
like one that slaughtered is;
And with thy mighty arm thou have
dispersed thine enemies.
The heavens are thine, thou for thine own
the earth do also take:
The world, and fullness of the same,
thy power did found and make.
The North and South from thee alone
their first beginning had:
Both Tabor mount, and Hermon hill
shall in thy Name be glad.
Thou have an arm that is full of power,
thy Hand is great in might;
And thy right hand exceedingly
exalted is in height.
Justice and judgment of thy Throne
are made the dwelling place:
Mercy, accompanied with truth,
shall go before thy face.
O greatly blessed the people are,
the joyful sound that know:
In brightness of thy face, O Lord,
they ever on shall go.
They in thy Name shall all the day
rejoice exceedingly,
And in thy righteousness shall they
exalted be on hy.
Because the glory of their strength
does only stand in thee,
And in thy favor shall our horn
and power exalted be.
For God is our defense, and He
to us does safety bring:
The Holy One of Israel
is our Almighty King.
In vision to thy holy-one
thou said, I help upon
A strong one laid; out of the folk
I raised a chosen one.
Even David, I have found him out
a servant unto Me;
And with my holy oil My King
anointed him to be.
With whom My hand shall stablisht be,
Mine arm shall make him strong.
On him the foe shall not exact,
nor son of mischief wrong.
I will beat down before his face
all his malicious foes:
I will them greatly plague, who do
with hatred him oppose.
My mercy, and my faithfulness
with him yet still shall be;
And in My Name his horn and power,
men shall exalted see.
His hand and power shall reach afar,
I Will set it in the sea;
And his right hand established
shall in the rivers be.
Thou art my father, he shall ery,
thou art my God alone;
And he shall say, Thou art the rock
of my salvation.
I Will make him My firstborn, more high
then Kings of any land:
My love I Will ever keep for him.
My covenant fast shall stand.
His seed I by My power will make
for ever to endure;
And, as the days of heaven, his throne
shall stable be and sure.
But if his children shall forsake
My Laws, and go astray,
And in My judgments shall not walk,
but wander from My way.
If they My Laws break, and do not
keep My Commandments,
I Will visit then their faults with rods,
their sins with chastisements.
Yet I Will not take My love from him,
nor false My promise make;
My covenant I Will not break, nor change
what with my mouth I spoke.
Once by My Holiness I swear,
to David I Will not ly.
His seed and throne shall as the sun
before Me last for ay.
It like the moon shall ever be
established steadfastly;
And like to that which in the heaven
does witness faithfully.
But thou displeased, have cast off,
thou did abhor and loath;
With him that thine anointed is
thou have been very wroth.
Thou have thy servants covenan
made void and quite cast by;
Thou have profaned his crown, while it
cast on the ground does ly.
Thou all his hedges have broke down,
his strong holds down have torn.
He to all passers by a spoil,
to neighbors is a scorn.
Thou have set up his foes right hand,
made all his enemies glad;
Turned his swords edge, and him to stand
in battle have not made.
His glory thou have made to cease,
his throne to ground down cast;
Shortened his days of youth, and him
with shame thou covered have.
How long, Lord? will thou hide thy self
for ever in thine ire?
And shall thine indignation
burn like unto a fire?
Remember, Lord, how short a time
I shall on earth remain;
O wherefore is it so, that thou
have made all men in vain?
What man is he that lives here,
and death shall never see?
Or from the power of the grave
what man his soul shall free?
Thy former loving kindnesses,
O Lord; where be they now?
Those which in truth and faithfulness
to David sworn have thou.
Mind, Lord, thy servants sad reproach:
how I in bosom bear
The scornings of the people all
who strong and mighty are.
Wherewith thy raging enemies
reproached, O Lord, think on,
Wherewith they have reproached the steps
of thine anointed one.
All blessing to the Lord, our God,
let be ascribed then:
For evermore so let it be.
Amen, yea and amen.
PSALM. XC. A prayer of Moses, the man of God.
LOrd, thou have been our dwelling place
in generations all.
Before thou ever had, brought forth
the mountains great or small.
Ere ever thou had formed the earth,
and all the world abroad,
Even thou, from everlasting art
to everlasting, God.
Thou do unto destruction
man that is mortal turn:
And unto them thou say, again
ye sons of men return.
Because a thousand years appear
no more before thy sight
Then yesterday, when it is past,
or then a watch by night.
As with an overflowing flood
thou carriest them away:
They like a sleep are, like the grass
that grows at morn are they.
At morn it flourishes and grows,
cut down at even does fade:
For by thine anger we consume,
thy wrath makes us afraid.
Our sins thou and iniquities
do in thy presence place,
And setst our secret faults before
the brightness of thy face.
For in thine anger all our days
do pass on, to an end;
And, as a tale that has been told,
so we our years do spend.
Threescore and ten years do sum up
our days and years we see:
Or if by reason of more strength,
in some fourscore they be;
Yet does the strength of such old men
but grief and labor prove;
For it is soon cut off, and we
fly hence, and soon remove.
Who knows the power of thy wrath?
according to thy fear
So is thy wrath. Lord teach thou us
our end in mind to bear:
And so to count our days, that we
our hearts may still apply
To learn thy wisdom and thy truth,
that we may live thereby.
Turn yet again to us, O Lord;
how long thus shall it be?
Let it repent thee now, for those
that servants are to thee.
O with thy tender mercies, Lord,
us early satisfy;
So we rejoice shall all our days,
and still be glad in thee.
According as the days have been
wherein we grief have had,
And years wherein we ill have seen,
so do thou make us glad.
O let thy work and power appear
thy servants face before;
And show unto their children dear
thy glory evermore.
And let the beauty of the Lord
our God be us upon:
Our handie-works establish thou,
establish them each one.
PSALM. XCI.
HE that does in the secret place
of the most High reside,
Under the shade of Him, that is
The Almighty, shall abide.
I of the Lord, my God, will say,
He is my refuge still,
He is my fortress, and my God,
and in Him trust I will.
Assuredly He shall thee save,
and give deliverance
From subtle fowlers snare, and from
the noisome pestilence.
His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust
under His wings shall be:
His faithfulness shall be a shield
and buckler unto thee.
Thou shall not need to be afraid
for terrors of the night,
Nor for the arrow that does fly
by day, while it is light:
Nor for the pestilence, that walks
in darkness secretly,
Nor for destruction, that does waste
at noonday, openly.
A thousand at thy side shall fall,
on thy right hand shall ly
Ten thousand dead, yet unto thee
it shall not once come nigh.
Only thou with thine eyes shall look,
and a beholder be;
And thou therein the just reward
of wicked men shall see.
Because the Lord, who constantly
my refuge is alone,
Even the most High is made by thee
thy habitation.
No plague shall near thy dwelling come,
no ill shall thee befall:
For thee to keep in all thy ways
His Angels charge He shall.
They in their hands shall bear thee up,
still waiting thee upon;
Lest thou at any time should dash
thy foot against a stone.
Upon the adder thou shall tread,
and on the Lion strong;
Thy feet on Dragons trample shall,
and on the Lions young.
Because on Me he set his love,
I Will save and set him free:
Because My great Name he has known,
I will him set on high.
He Will call on Me, I Will answer him,
I will be with him still
In trouble to deliver him,
and honor him I will.
With length of days unto his mind
I will him satisfy;
I also My salvation
will cause his eyes to see.
PSALM. XCII. A psalm or song for the Sabbath Day.
TO render thanks unto the Lord
it is a comely thing,
And to thy Name, O thou most high,
due praise aloud to sing.
Thy loving kindness to show forth,
when shines the morning light;
And to declare thy faithfulness,
with pleasure, every night,
On a ten stringed instrument,
upon the psalterie:
And on the harp, with solemn sound,
and grave-sweet melody.
For thou, Lord, by thy mighty work,
have made my heart right glad;
And I will triumph in the works
which by thine hands were made.
How great, Lord, are thy works! each thought
of thine a deep it is;
A brutish man it knows not,
fools understand not this.
When those that lewd and wicked are,
spring quickly up like grass,
And workers of iniquity
do flourish all apace,
It is that they for ever may
destroyed be and slain:
But thou, O Lord, art the most High,
for ever to remain.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord,
thine enemies perish shall:
The workers of iniquity
shall be dispersed all.
But thou shall, like unto the horn
of th'unicorn exalt
My horn on high; thou with fresh oil
anoint me also shall.
Mine eye shall also my desire
see on mine enemies;
Mine ears shall of the wicked hear,
that do against me rise.
But like the palm tree, flourishing
shall be the righteous one:
He shall like to the Cedar grow
that is in Lebanon.
Those that within the house of God
are planted by His grace,
They shall grow up, and flourish all
in our Gods holy place.
And in old age, when others fade,
they fruit still forth shall bring:
They shall be fat, and full of sap,
and ay be flourishing.
To show that upright is the Lord,
He is a rock to me:
And He from all unrighteousness
is altogether free.
PSALM. XCIII.
THe Lord does reign, and clothed is He
with majesty most bright:
His works do show him clothed to be,
and girt about with might.
The world is also stablished,
that it can not depart.
Thy Throne is fixed of old, and thou
from everlasting art.
The floods, O Lord, have lifted up,
they lifted up their voice;
The floods have lifted up their waves,
and made a mighty noise.
But yet the Lord, that is on high,
is more of might by far,
Then noise of many waters is,
or great sea billows are.
Thy testimonies, every one,
in faithfulness excel:
And holiness for ever, Lord,
thine House becomes well.
PSALM. XCIV.
O Lord God, unto whom alone
all vengeance does belong,
O mighty God, who vengeance own'st,
shine forth, avenging wrong.
Lift up thy self, thou of the earth
the Sovereign Judge that art,
And unto those that are so proud
a due reward impart.
How long, O mighty God, shall they
who lewd and wicked be,
How long shall they who wicked are,
thus triumph haughtilie?
How long shall things most hard by them
be uttered and told,
And all that work iniquity
to boast themselves be bold?
Thy folk they break in pieces, Lord,
thine heritage oppress:
The widow they, and stranger slay,
and kill the fatherless.
Yet say they, God it shall not see,
nor God of Jacob know.
Ye brutish people understand,
fools, when wise will ye grow?
The Lord did plant the ear of man,
and hear then shall not He?
He only formed the eye, and then
shall he not clearly see?
He that the nations does correct,
shall He not chastise you?
He knowledge unto man does teach,
and shall Himself not know?
Man's thoughts to be but vanity,
the Lord does well discern,
Blessed is the man thou chastnest, Lord,
and make thy Law to learn.
That thou may give him rest from days
of sad adversity,
Until the pit be dig'd for those
that work iniquity.
For sure the Lord will not cast off
those that His people be,
Neither His own inheritance
quite and forsake will He.
But judgment unto righteousness
shall yet return again,
And all shall follow after it
that are right hearted men.
Who will rise up for me, against
those that do wickedly?
Who will stand up for me, against those
that work iniquity?
Unless the Lord had been my help,
when I was sore oppressed,
Almost my soul had in the house
of silence been at rest.
When I had uttered this word,
My foot does slip away,
Thy mercy held me up, O Lord,
thy goodness did me stay,
Amidst the multitude of thoughts,
which in my heart do fight,
My soul, left it be overcharged,
thy comforts do delight.
Shall of iniquity the throne
have fellowship with thee,
Which mischief, cunningly contrived,
does by a law decree?
Against the righteous souls they join,
they guiltless blood condemn:
But of my refuge God's the rock,
and my defense from them.
On them their own iniquity
the Lord shall bring and lay,
And cut them off in their own sin,
our Lord God shall them slay.
PSALM. XCV.
O Come, let us sing to the Lord,
come, let us, every one,
A joyful noise make to the Rock
of our salvation.
Let us before His presence come,
with praise and thankful voice:
Let us sing Psalms to Him with grace,
and make a joyful noise.
For God a great God, and great King,
above all gods, He is.
Depths of the earth are in His hand,
the strength of hills is His.
To Him the spacious sea belongs,
for He the same did make:
The dry land also from His hands
its form at first did take.
O come, and let us worship Him,
let us bow down withal,
And on our knees before the Lord,
our maker, let us fall.
For He Is our God, the people we
of His own pasture are,
And of His hand the sheep; to day
if ye His voice will hear,
Then harden not your hearts, as in
the provocation,
As in the desert, on the day
of the tentation.
When Me your fathers tempt'd, and proved,
and did My working see:
Even for the space of forty years
this race has grieved Me:
I said, This people erres in heart,
My ways they do not know:
To whom I swear in wrath, that to
My rest they should not go.
PSALM. XCVI.
O sing a new song to the Lord,
sing, all the earth, to God:
To God sing, bless His Name, show still
His saving health abroad.
Among the heathen nations
His glory do declare:
And unto all the people show
His works that wondrous are.
For great's the Lord, and greatly He
is to be magnified;
Yea, worthy to he feared is He
above all gods beside:
For all the gods are idols dumb
which blinded nations fear:
But our God is the Lord, by whom
the heavens created were.
Great honor is before His face,
and majesty divine:
Strength is with in His holy place,
and there does beauty shine.
Do you, ascribe unto the Lord,
of people every tribe,
Glory do you unto the Lord,
and mighty power ascribe.
Give ye the glory to the Lord
that to His Name is due:
Come ye into His Courts, and bring
an offering with you,
In beauty of His holiness
O do the Lord adore:
Likewise let all the earth throughout
tremble His face before.
Among the heathen say, God reigns:
the world shall steadfastly
Be fixed from moving, He shall judge
the people righteously.
Let heavens be glad before the Lord,
and let the earth rejoice,
Let seas, and all that is therein,
cry out, and make a noise:
Let fields rejoice, and every thing
that springs of the earth:
Then woods, and every tree shall sing
with gladness and with mirth
Before the Lord; because He comes,
to judge the earth comes He:
He Will judge the world with righteousness,
the people faithfully.
PSALM. XCVII.
GOD reigns, let the earth be glad,
and isles rejoice each one.
Dark clouds Him compass, and in right
with judgment dwells His Throne.
Fire goes before Him, and His foes
it burns up round about.
His lightnings lighten did the world,
earth saw, and shook throughout.
Hills, at the presence of the Lord,
like wax, did melt away:
Even at the presence of the Lord
of all the earth, I say.
The heavens declare His righteousness,
all men His glory see.
All who serve graven images
confounded let them be:
Who do of idols boast themselves
let shame upon them fall.
Ye that are called gods, see that
ye do Him worship all.
Sion did hear, and joyful was,
glad Judahs daughters were,
They much rejoiced, O Lord, because
Thy judgments did appear.
For thou O Lord, art high above
all things on earth that are:
Above all other gods thou art
exalted very far.
Hate ill, all ye that love the Lord:
His saints souls keeps He,
And from the hands of wicked men
He sets them safe and free.
For all those that be righteous
sown is a joyful light,
And gladness sown is for all those
that are in heart upright.
Ye righteous in the Lord rejoice,
express your thankfulness,
When ye into your memory
do call His holiness.
PSALM. XCVIII. A Psalm.
O sing a new song to the Lord,
for wonders He has done:
His right hand, and His holy arm
Him victory has won.
The Lord God his salvation
has caused to be known:
His justice in the heathens sight
He openly has shown.
He mindful of His grace and truth
to Isreal's house has been:
And the salvation of our God
all ends of the earth have seen.
Let all the earth unto the Lord
send forth a joyful noise:
Lift up your voice aloud to Him,
sing praises, and rejoice.
With harp, with harp, and voice of psalms,
unto JEHOVAH sing.
With trumpets, cornets, gladly sound
before the Lord, the King.
Let seas, and all their fullness roar,
the world, and dwellers there.
Let floods clap hands, and let the hills
together joy declare
Before the Lord; because he comes,
to judge the earth comes He:
He Will judge the world with righteousness,
His folk with equity.
PSALM. XCIX.
THE Eternal Lord does reign, as King,
let all the people quake:
He sits between the Cherubims,
let the earth be moved and shake.
The Lord in Sion great, and high
above all people is.
Thy great and dreadful Name (for it
is Holy) let them bless.
The Kings strength also judgment loves:
thou setlest equity,
Just judgment thou do execute
in Jacob, righteously.
The Lord our God exalt on hie,
and reverently do ye
Before His footstool worship Him:
the Holy-One is He.
Moses and Aaron amongst His priests,
Samuel with them that call
Upon His Name; these called on God,
and He them answered all.
Within the pillar of the cloud
He unto them did speak:
The testimonies, He them taught,
and laws, they did not break.
Thou answeredst them, O Lord, our God,
thou wast a God that gave
Pardon to them, though on their deeds
thou would vengeance have.
Do ye exalt the Lord, our God,
and at His holy hill
Do ye Him worship; for the Lord
our God is Holy still.
PSALM. C. A Psalm of praise.
ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
Know, that the Lord is God indeed,
Without our aid He did us make:
We are his flock, he does us feed,
And for his sheep he does us take.
O enter then his gates with praise,
Approach with joy his Courts unto:
Praise, laud; and bless his Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
For why? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure:
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
Another of the same.
O All ye lands, unto the Lord
make ye a joyful noise.
Serve God with gladness, him before
come with a singing voice.
Know ye the Lord, that he is God,
not we, but He us made;
We are his people, and the sheep
within his pasture fed.
Enter his gates and courts, with praise,
to thank him go ye thither:
To him express your thankfulness,
and bless his Name together.
Because the Lord our God is good,
his mercy fails never;
And to all generations
his truth endures ever.
PSALM. CI. A Psalm of David.
I Mercy will, and judgment sing,
Lord, I will sing to thee.
With wisdom, in a perfect way
shall my behavior be.
O when in kindness unto me,
will thou be pleased to come?
I with a perfect heart will walk
within my house, at home.
I will endure no wicked thing
before mine eyes to be:
I hate their work that turn aside,
it shall not cleave to me.
A stubborn and a froward heart
depart quite from me shall:
A person given to wickedness
I will not know at all.
I Will cut him off, that slandereth
his neighbor privily:
The haughty heart I will not bear,
nor him that looks hie.
Upon the faithful of the land
mine eyes shall be, that they
May dwell with me: he shall me serve
that walks in perfect way.
Who of deceit a worker is,
in my house shall not dwell:
And in my presence shall he not
remain, that lies does tell.
Yea, all the wicked of the land
early destroy will I:
All from Gods city to cut off,
that work iniquity.
PSALM CII. A prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed, and pours out
his complaint before the Lord.
O Lord, unto my prayer give ear,
my cry let come to thee;
And in the day of my distress
hide not thy face from me:
Give ear to me: what time I call,
to answer me make haste.
For as an hearth my bones are burnt,
my days, like smoke, do waste.
My heart within me smitten is,
and it is withered,
Like very grass, so that I do
forget to eat my bread.
By reason of my groaning voice,
my bones cleave to my skin.
Like pelican in wilderness
forsaken I have bin:
I like an owl in desert am,
that nightly there does moan:
I watch, and like a sparrow am
on the house top alone.
My bitter enemies all the day
reproaches cast on me:
And being mad at me, with rage
against me sworn they be.
For why, I ashes eaten have,
like bread, in sorrows deep;
My drink I also mingled have
with tears that I did weep.
Thy wrath and indignation
did cause this grief and pain:
For thou have lift me up on high,
and cast me down again.
My days are like unto a shade,
which does declining pass:
And I am dried and withered,
even like unto the grass.
But thou, Lord, everlasting art,
and thy remembrance shall
Continually endure, and be
to generations all.
Thou shall arise, and mercy have
upon thy Zion yet:
The time to favor her is come,
the time that thou have set.
For in her rubbish, and her stones
thy servants pleasure take,
Yea, they the very dust thereof
do favor, for her sake.
So shall the heathen people fear
the Lords most holy Name:
And all the Kings on earth shall dread
thy glory, and thy fame.
When Zion by the mighty Lord
built up again shall be,
In Glory then, and Majesty
to men appear shall He.
The prayer of the destitute
he surely will regard,
Their prayer will he not despise,
by him it shall be heard.
For generations yet to come
this shall be on record:
So shall the people, that shall be
created, praise the Lord.
He from his Sanctuaries height
has downward cast his eye*
And from his glorious Throne in heaven,
the Lord the earth did spy:
That of the mournful prisoner
the groanings he might hear,
To set them free that unto death
by men appointed are:
That they in Zion may declare
the Lords most holy Name,
And publish in Jerusalem
the praises of the same:
When as the people gather shall
in troops with one accord,
When Kingdoms shall assembled be
to serve the highest Lord.
My wonted force and strength he has
abated in the way;
And he my days has shortened:
Thus therefore did I say*
My God, in mid-time of my days,
take thou me not away:
From age to age, eternally
thy years endure and stay.
The firm foundation of the earth
of old time thou have laid:
The heavens also are the work
which thine own hands have made.
Thou shall for evermore endure,
but they shall perish all;
Yea, every one of them wax old,
like to a garment, shall:
Thou as a vesture shall them change,
and they shall changed be.
But Thou the same art, and thy years
are to eternity.
The children of thy servants shall
continually endure,
And in thy sight, O Lord, their seed
shall be established sure.
Another of the same.
LOrd, hear my prayer, and let my cry
Have speedy access unto thee.
In day of my calamity
O hide not Thou thy face from me:
Hear when I call to thee, that day
An answer speedily return:
My days like smoke consume away,
And, as an hearth, my bones do burn.
My heart is wounded very sore,
And withered, like to grass, does fade:
I am forgetful grown therefore
To take and eat my daily bread.
By reason of my smart within,
And voice of my most grievous groans,
My flesh consumed is, my skin,
All parcht, does cleave unto my bones.
The Pelican of wilderness,
The Owl in deserts I do match,
And Sparrow-like companionlesse,
Upon the houses top I watch.
I all day long am made a scorn,
Reproached by my malicious foes:
The mad men are against me sworn,
The men against me that arose.
For I have ashes eaten up,
To me as if they had been bread;
And with my drink I in my cup
Of bitter tears a mixture made.
Because thy wrath was not appeased,
And dreadful indignation,
Therefore it was that thou me raised,
And thou again did cast me down.
My days are like a shade always,
Which does declining swiftly pass:
And I am withered away
Much like unto the fading grass.
But thou O Lord, shall still endure
From change and all mutation free,
And, to all generations, sure
Shall thy remembrance ever be.
Thou shall arise, and mercy yet
Thou to mount Zion shall extend:
Her time for favor which was set,
Behold, is now come to an end.
Thy saints take pleasure in her stones,
Her very dust to them is dear.
All heathen lands and kingly thrones
On earth, thy glorious Name shall fear.
God in his glory shall appear,
When Zion he builds and repairs.
He shall regard and lend his ear
Unto the needies humble prayers.
The afflicteds prayer He will not scorn:
All times this shall be in record,
And generations yet unborn
Shall praise and magnify the Lord.
He from his holy place looked down,
The earth he viewed from heaven on hie;
To hear the prisoners mourning groan,
And free them that are damned to die;
That Zion, and Jerusalem too
His Name and praise may well record,
When people and the Kingdoms do
Assemble all to praise the Lord.
My strength he weakened in the way,
My days of life he shortened.
My God, O take me not away
In mid-time of my days, I said:
Thy years throughout all ages last.
Of old thou have established
The earths foundation firm and fast:
Thy mighty hands the heavens have made.
They perish shall, as garments do,
But thou shall evermore endure:
As vestures, thou shall change them so,
And they shall all be changed sure.
But from all changes thou art free,
Thy endless years do last for ay.
Thy servants, and their seed who be,
Established shall before thee stay.
PSALM. CIII. A Psalm of David.
O thou my soul, bless God, the Lord,
and all that in me is
Be stirred up his holy Name
to magnify and bless.
Bless, O my soul, the Lord, thy God,
and not forgetful be
Of all his gracious benefits
he has bestowed on thee.
All thine iniquities who does
most graciously forgive:
Who thy diseases all and pains
does heal, and thee relieve.
Who does redeem thy life, that thou
to death may not go down:
Who thee with loving kindness does
and tender mercies crown.
Who with abundance of good things
does satisfy thy mouth:
So that, even as the Eagles age,
renewed is thy youth.
God righteous judgment executes
for all oppressed ones.
His way to Moses, he his acts
made known to Isreal's sons.
Lord our God is merciful,
and he is gracious,
Long suffering, and slow to wrath,
in mercy plenteous.
He will not chide continually,
nor keep his anger still.
With us he dealt not as we sinned,
nor did require our ill.
For as the heaven in its height
the earth surmounteth far,
So great to those that do him fear,
his tender mercies are.
As far as East is distant from
the West, so far has He
From us removed, in His love,
all our iniquity.
Such pity as a father has
unto his children dear,
Like pity shows the Lord to such
as worship Him in fear.
For He remembers, we are dust,
and He our frame well knows.
Frail man, his days are like the grass,
as flowr in field he grows.
For over it the wind does pass,
and it away is gone,
And of the place where once it was
it shall no more be known.
But unto them, that do Him fear,
Gods mercy never ends;
And to their childrens children still
His righteousness extends:
To such as keep, his covenant,
and mindful are always
Of His most just commandments,
that they may them obey.
The Lord prepared has His Throne
in heavens firm to stand:
And every thing that being has
His Kingdom does command.
O ye his Angels, that excel
in strength, bless ye the Lord,
Ye who obey what he commands,
and hearken to his word.
O bless, and magnify the Lord,
ye glorious hosts of his,
Ye ministers, that do fulfill
what e're his pleasure is.
O bless the Lord, all ye his works,
wherewith the world is stored
In his dominions everywhere:
my soul bless thou the Lord.
PSALM. CIV.
Bless God, my soul: O Lord my God,
thou are exceeding great,
With Honor and with Majesty
thou clothed art in state.
With light, as with a robe, thy self
thou coverest about;
And, like unto a curtain, thou
the heavens stretchest out.
Who of his chambers does the beams
within the waters lay;
Who does the clouds his chariot make,
on wings of wind make way.
Who flaming fire his ministers,
his Angels spirits does make;
Who earths foundations did lay,
that it should never shake.
Thou did it cover with the deep,
as with a garment spread:
The waters stood above the hills,
when thou the word but said.
But, at the voice of thy rebuke
they fled, and would not stay:
They, at thy thunders dreadful voice,
did haste them fast away.
They by the mountains do ascend,
and by the valley ground
Descend, unto that very place
which thou for them did found.
Thou have a bound unto them set*
that they may not pass over,
That they do not return again
the face of earth to cover.
He to the valleys sends the springs,
which run among the hills:
They to all beasts of field give drink,
wild asses drink their fills.
By them the fowls of heaven shall have
their habitation,
Which do among the branches sing
with delectation.
He from his chambers waters
the hills, when they are dried:
With fruit and increase of thy works
the earth is satisfied.
For cattle he makes grass to grow,
he makes the herb to spring
For the use of man, that food to him,
he from the earth may bring.
And wine, that to the heart of man
does cheerfulness impart,
Oil that his face makes shine, and bread
that strengthens his heart.
The trees of God are full of sap,
the Cedars that do stand
In Lebanon, which planted were
by his Almighty hand.
Birds of the air upon their boughs
do choose their nests to make:
As for the Stork, the fir-trees she
does for her dwelling take.
The lofty mountains for wild goats
a place of refuge be:
The Conies also to the rocks
do for their safety flee.
He sets the Moon in heaven, thereby
the seasons to discern:
From Him the Sun, his certain time
of going down, does learn.
Thou darkness make, it is night, then beasts
of forests creep abroad.
The Lions young roar for their prey,
and seek their meat from God.
The Sun does rise, and home they flock,
down in their dens they ly.
Man goes to work, his labor he
does to the evening ply.
How manifold, Lord, are thy works!
in wisdom wonderful
Thou every one of them have made;
earth's of thy riches full.
So is this great and spacious sea,
wherein things creeping are
Which numbered cannot be; and beasts
both great and small are there.
There ships go, there thou make to play
that Leviathan great:
These all wait on thee, that thou may
in due time give them meat.
That, which thou give unto them,
they gather for their food;
Thine hand thou op'nest liberally,
they filled are with good.
Thou hid'st thy face, they troubled are;
their breath thou take away,
Then do they die, and to their dust
return again do they.
Thy quickening Spirit thou sendest forth,
then they created be:
And then the earths decayed face
renewed is by thee.
The glory of the mighty Lord
continue shall for ever:
The Lord JEHOVAH shall rejoice
in all his works together.
Earth, as affrighted, trembles all,
if He on it but look:
And if the mountains He but touch,
they presently do smoke.
I will sing to the Lord most high,
so long as I shall live;
And while I being have, I shall
to my God praises give.
Of Him my meditation shall
sweet thoughts to me afford;
And as for me, I will rejoice
in God, my only Lord.
From earth let sinners be consumed,
let ill men no more be.
O thou my soul, bless thou the Lord:
praise to the Lord give ye.
PSALM. CV.
GIve thanks to God, call on His Name,
to men his deeds make known.
Sing ye to him, sing psalms; proclaim
his wondrous works each one.
See that ye in his holy Name
to glory do accord:
And let the heart of every one
rejoice, that seeks the Lord.
The Lord Almighty, and his strength
with steadfast hearts seek ye.
His blessed and his gracious face
seek ye continually.
Think on the works that he has done,
which admiration breed;
His wonders; and the judgments all
which from his mouth proceed.
O ye that are of Abraham's race,
his servant well approv'n,
And ye that Jacobs children are,
whom he choos'd for his own,
Because He, and He only, is
the mighty Lord, our God;
And his most righteous judgments are
in all the earth abroad.
His Covenant he remembered has,
that it may ever stand:
To thousand generations
the word he did command.
Which Covenant he firmly made
with faithful Abraham,
And unto Isaac by his oath
he did renew the same:
And unto Jacob, for a Law,
he made it firm and sure,
A Covenant to Israel,
which ever should endure.
He said, I Will give Canaans land
for heritage to you:
While they were strangers there, and few,
in number very few.
While yet they went from land to land,
without a sure abode;
And while, through sundry kingdoms, they
did wander far abroad:
Yet notwithstanding suffered he
no man to do them wrong:
Yea, for their sakes, he did reprove
Kings, who were great and strong.
Thus did he say, Touch ye not those
that mine anointed be,
Not do the Prophets any harm
that do pertain to Me.
He called for famine the land,
he brake the staff of bread.
But yet he sent a man before,
by whom they should be fed:
Even Joseph, whom unnaturally
sell for a slave did they;
Whose feet with fetters they did hurt,
and he in irons lay.
Until the time that his word came
to give him liberty:
The word and purpose of the Lord
did him in prison try.
Then sent the King, and did command
that he enlarged should be,
He that the peoples ruler was,
did send to set him free.
A Lord, to rule his family,
he raised him, as most fit;
To him, of all that he possessed,
he did the charge commit.
That he might at his pleasure bind
the Princes of the land;
And he might teach his Senators
wisdom to understand.
The people then of Israel
down into Egypt came:
And Jacob also sojourned
within the land of Ham.
And he did greatly, by his power,
increase his people there;
And stronger then their enemies
they by his blessing were.
Their heart he turned to envy
his folk maliciously,
With those that his own servants were
to deal in subtilty.
His servant Moses he did send,
Aaron his chosen one:
By these, his signs and wonders great
in Hams land were made known.
Darkness he sent, and made it dark:
his word they did obey.
He turned their waters into blood,
and he their fish did slay.
The land in plenty brought forth frogs
in chambers of their Kings.
His word all sorts of flies and lice
in all their borders brings.
He hail for rain, and flaming fire
into their land he sent:
And he their vines and fig trees smote,
trees of their coasts he rent.
He spoke, and Caterpillars came,
Locusts did much abound,
Which in their land all herbs consumed,
and all fruits of their ground.
He smote all firstborn in their land,
chief of their strength each one.
With gold and silver brought them forth,
weak in their tribes were none.
Egypt was glad when sorth they went:
their fear on them did light.
He spread a cloud for covering,
and fire to shine by night.
They asked, and he brought Quails; with bread
of heaven he filled them.
He opened rocks, floods gusht, and ran
in deserts, like a stream.
For on his holy promise he,
and servant Abraham, thought,
With joy his people, his elect
with gladness forth he brought*
And unto them the pleasant lands
he of the heathen gave,
That of the peoples labors they
inheritance might have;
That they his statutes might observe,
according to his word,
And that they might his Laws obey.
Give praise unto the Lord.
PSALM. CVI.
GIve praise and thanks unto the Lord,
for bountiful is He:
His tender mercy does endure
unto eternity.
Gods mighty works who can express?
or show forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that judgment keep,
and justly do always.
Remember me, Lord, with that love,
which thou to thine do bear:
With thy salvation, O my God,
to visit me, draw near:
That I thy chosens good may see,
and in their joy rejoice,
And may with thine inheritance
triumph with cheerful voice.
We with our fathers sinned have,
and of iniquity
Too long we have the workers been,
we have done wickedly.
The wonders great which thou, O Lord,
did work in Egypt land,
Our fathers, though they saw, yet them
they did not understand:
And they thy mercies multitude
kept not in memory,
But at the sea, even the Red Sea,
provoked him grievously.
Nevertheless he saved them,
even for his own Names sake;
That so, he might to be welt known
his mighty power, make.
When he the Red Sea did rebuke,
then dried up it was:
Through depths, as through the wilderness,
He safely made them pass.
From hands, of those that hated them,
he did his people save,
And from the enemies cruel hand
to them redemption gave.
The waters overwhelmed their foes,
not one was left alive:
Then they believed his word, and praise
to him in songs did give.
But soon did they his mighty works
forget unthankfully,
And on, his counsel and his will
did not wait patiently.
But much did lust in wilderness,
and God in desert tempt.
He gave them what they sought, but to
their soul he leanness sent.
And against Moses, in the camp,
their envy did appear,
At Aaron they, the saint of God,
envious also were.
Therefore the earth did open wide,
and Dathan did devour,
And all Abirams company
did cover in that hour.
Likewise among their company
a fire was kindled then,
And so the hot consuming flame
burnt up these wicked men.
Upon the hill of Horeb, they
an idol-calf did frame,
A molten image they did make,
and worshipped the same
And thus their Glory, and their God,
most vainly changed they
Into the likeness of an ox
that eats grass or hay.
They did forget the mighty God,
that had their Savior been,
By whom such great things brought to pass
they had in Egypt seen.
In Hams land he did wondrous works:
things terrible did he,
When he his mighty hand and arm
stretched out at the Red Sea.
Then said he, he would them destroy,
had not, his wrath to stay,
His chosen Moses stood in breach,
that them he should not slay.
Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
believed not his word;
But in their tents they murmured,
not harkening to the Lord.
Therefore in desert, them to slay
he lifted up his hand:
among nations to overthrow their seed,
and scatter in each land.
They unto Baal-Peor did
themselves associat:
The sacrifices of the dead
they did profanely eat.
Thus, by their lewd inventions,
they did provoke his ire;
And then, upon them suddenly
the plague brake in, as fire.
Then Phineas rose, and justice did,
and so the plague did cease:
That to all ages counted was
to him for righteousness.
And at the waters, where they strove,
they did him angry make,
In such sort, that it fared ill
with Moses for their sake.
Because they there his spirit meek
provoked bitterly,
So that he uttered with his lips
words unadvisedly.
Nor, as the Lord commanded them,
did they the nations slay;
But with the heathen mingled were,
and learned of them their way.
And they their idols served, which did
a snare unto them turn:
Their sons and daughters they to devils
in sacrifice did burn.
In their own childrens guiltless blood
their hands they did embrew,
Whom to Canaans idols they
for sacrifices slew.
So was the land defiled with blood;
They stained with their own way,
And with their own inventions
a whoring they did stray.
Against his people kindled was
the wrath of God therefore,
Insomuch that he did his own
inheritance abhore.
He gave them to the heathens hand,
their foes did them command:
Their enemies them oppressed, they were
made subject to their hand.
He many times delivered them,
but with their counsel, so
They him provoked, that for their sin
they were brought very low.
Yet their affliction he beheld,
when he did hear their cry:
And he for them his Covenant
did call to memory:
After his mercies multitude
he did repent; And made
Them to be pitied of all those
who them did captive lead.
O Lord, our God, us save, and gather
the heathen from among,
That we thy holy Name may praise
in a triumphant song.
Blessed be JEHOVAH, Isreal's God,
to all eternity:
Let all the people say, Amen.
Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSALM. CVII.
PRaise God, for he is good, for still
his mercies lasting be.
Let Gods redeemed say so, whom he
from the enemies hand did free:
And gathered them out of the lands,
from North, South, East and West.
They strayed in deserts pathlesse way*
no city found to rest.
For thirst and hunger in them faints
their soul. When straits them press
They cry unto the Lord, and he
them frees from their distress.
Them also in a way to walk,
that right is, he did guide,
That they might to a city go,
wherein they might abide.
O that men to the Lord would give
praise, for his goodness, then,
And for his works of wonder done
unto the sons of men.
For he the soul that longing is
does fully satisfy,
With goodness he the hungry soul
does fill abundantly
Such as shut up in darkness deep,
and in deathsshade abide,
Whom strongly has affliction bound,
and irons fast have tied
(Because against the words of God
they wrought rebelliously,
And they the counsel did contemn
of him that is most hie)
Their heart he did bring down with grief,
they fell, no help could have.
In trouble then they cried to God,
he them from straits did save.
He out of darkness did them bring,
and from deaths shade them take:
These bands wherewith they had been bound,
asunder quite he brake.
O that men to the Lord would give
praise, for his goodness then,
And for his works of wonder done
unto the sons of men.
Because the mighty gates of brass
in piece she did tear,
By him in sunder also cut
the bars of iron were.
Fools for their sin, and their offense,
do sore affliction bear.
All kind of meat their soul abhors,
they to deaths-gates draw near.
In grief they cry to God, he saves
them from their miseries:
He sends his word them heals, and them
from their destructions frees.
O that men to the Lord would give
praise, for his goodness then,
And for his works of wonder done
unto the sons of men.
And let them sacrifice to him
offerings of thankfulness,
And let them show abroad his work
in songs of joyfulnesse.
Who go to sea in ships, and in
great waters trading be,
Within the deep these men Gods works,
and his great wonders see.
For he commands, and forth in haste
the stormy tempest flies,
Which makes the sea with rouling waves
aloft to swell and rise.
They mount to heaven, then to the depths
they do go down again,
Their soul does faint, and melt away
with trouble and with pain.
They reel and stagger like one drunk,
at their wits end they be:
Then they to God in trouble cry,
who them from straits does free.
The storm is changed into a calm,
at his command and will,
So that the waves which raged before,
now quiet are and still.
Then are they glad, because at rest
and quiet now they be,
So to the haven he them brings
which they desired to see.
O that men to the Lord would give
praise, for his goodness, then,
And for his works of wonder, done
unto the sons of men.
Among the people gathered,
let them exalt his Name;
Among assembled Elders spread
his most renowned fame.
He to dry land turns water-springs,
and floods to wilderness:
For sins of those that dwell therein
fat land to barrenness.
The burnt and parched wilderness
to water-pools he brings.
The ground that was dried up before
he turns to water springs.
And there, for dwelling, he a place
does to the hungry give,
That they a city may prepare
commodiously to live.
There sow they fields, and vineyards plant
to yield fruits of increase.
His blessing makes them multiply,
lets not their beasts decrease.
Again they are diminished,
and very low brought down,
Through sorrow, and affliction,
and great oppression.
He upon Princes pours contempt,
and causes them to stray
And wander in a wilderness,
wherein there is no way.
Yet sets he the poor on high
from all his miseries;
And he, much like unto a flock,
does make him families.
They that are righteous shall rejoice,
when they the same shall see;
And, ashamed, stop her mouth
shall all iniquity.
Who so is wise, and will these things
observe, and them record,
Even they shall understand the love
and kindness of the Lord.
PSALM. CVIII. A song or Psalm of David.
MY heart is fixed, Lord: I will sing,
and with my glory praise.
Awake up psaltery and harp,
my self I Will early raise.
I Will praise thee amongst the people, Lord,
among nations sing will I.
For above heaven thy mercy's great,
thy truth does reach the sky.
Be thou above the heavens, Lord,
exalted gloriously:
Thy glory all the earth above
be lifted up on hie.
That those who thy beloved are
delivered may be;
O do thou save with thy right hand,
and answer give to me.
God in his holiness has said,
Herein I will take pleasure,
Shechem I will divide, and forth
will Succoths valley measure.
Gilead I claim as Mine by right,
Manasseh Mine shall be,
Ephraim is of My head the strength,
Judah gives laws for Me.
Moab's My washing-pot, My shoe
I Will over Edom throw,
Over the land of Palestine
I will in triumph go.
who is he will bring me to
the City fortified!
O who is he that to the land
of Edom will me guide!
O God, thou who had cast us off,
this thing will thou not do?
And wilt not thou, even thou, O God,
forth with our armies go?
Do thou from trouble give us help,
for helpless is man's aid.
Through God we shall do valiantly,
our foes He shall down tread.
PSALM. CIX. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
O thou the God of all my praise,
do thou not hold thy peace:
For mouths of wicked men, to speak
against me, do not cease;
The mouths of vile deceitful men
against me opened be:
And with a false and lying tongue
they have accused me.
They did beset me round about
with words of hateful spite:
And, though to them no cause I gave,
against me they did fight.
They for my love became my foes,
but I me set to pray.
Evil for good, hatred for love
to me they did repay.
Set thou the wicked over him,
and upon his right hand
Give thou his greatest enemy,
even Satan, leave to stand.
And when by thee he shall be judged,
let him condemned be;
And let his prayer be turned to sin,
when he shall call on thee.
Few be his days, and in his room
his charge another take.
His children let be fotherlesse,
his wife a widow make.
His children let be vagabonds,
and beg continually;
And from their places desolate
seek bread for their supply.
Let covetous extortioners
catch all he has away:
Of all for which he labored has
let strangers make a prey.
Let there be none to pity him,
let there be none at all
That on his children fatherless
will let his mercy fall.
Let his posterity from earth
cut off for ever be,
And in the following age their name
be blotted out by thee.
Let God his fathers wickedness
still to remembrance call;
And never let his mothers sin
he blotted out at all.
But let them all before the Lord
appear continually,
That He may wholly from the earth
cut off their memory.
Because he mercy minded not,
but persecuted still
The poor and needy, that he might
the brokenhearted kill.
As he in cursing pleasure took,
so let it to him fall;
As he delighted not to bless,
so bless him not at all.
As cursing he like clothes put on,
into his bowels so
Like water, and into his bones
like oil down let it go.
Like to that garment let it be
which does himself array,
And for a girdle wherewith he
is girt about always.
From God let his be their reward
that enemies are to me,
And their reward, that speak against
my soul maliciously.
But do thou, for thine own Names sake,
O God the Lord, for me:
Since good and sweet they mercy is,
from trouble set me free.
For I am poor and indigent,
afflicted sore am I,
My heart within me also is
wounded exceedingly.
I pass like a declining shade.
am like the locust tossed.
My knees through fasting weakened are,
my flesh has fatness lost.
I also am a vile reproach
unto them made to be:
And they that did upon me look
did shake their heads at me.
O do thou help and succor me,
who art my God and Lord:
And, for thy tender mercies sake,
safety to me afford.
That thereby they may know, that this
is thy Almighty hand,
And that thou, Lord, have done the same
they may well understand.
Although they curse with spite, yet, Lord,
bless thou with loving voice:
Let them ashamed be, when they rise:
thy servant let rejoice.
Let thou mine adversaries all
with shame be clothed over,
And let their own confusion
them, as a mantle, cover.
But as for me, I with my mouth
will greatly praise the Lord;
And I among the multitude
His praises will record.
For He shall stand at his right hand
who is in poverty,
To save him from all those that would
condemn his soul to die.
PSALM. CX. A Psalm of David.
THe Lord did say unto my Lord,
Sit thou at My right hand,
Until I make thy foes a stool,
whereon thy feet may stand.
The Lord shall out of Zion send
the rod of thy great power:
In midst of all thine enemies
be thou the Governor.
A willing people, in thy day
of power, shall come to thee,
In holy beauties, from morns womb:
thy youth like dew shall be.
The Lord himself has made an oath,
and will repent him never,
Of the order of Melchisedek
Thou art a Priest for ever.
The glorious and mighty Lord,
that sits at thy right hand,
Shall, in his day of wrath, strike through
Kings, that do Him withstand.
He shall among the heathen judge,
He shall with bodies dead
The places fill, over many lands,
He wound shall every head.
The brook that runs in the way
with drink shall Him supply:
And for this cause, in triumph He
shall lift His head on hie.
PSALM. CXI.
PRaise ye the Lord: with my whole heart
I will Gods praise declare,
Where the assemblies of the just
and congregations are.
The whole works of the Lord our God
are great above all measure,
Sought out they are of every one
that do therein take pleasure.
His work most honorable is,
most glorious and pure,
And his untainted Righteousness
for ever does endure.
His works most wonderful He has
made to be thought upon:
The Lord is gracious, and He is
full of compassion.
He gives meat unto all those
that truly do Him fear;
And evermore His Covenant
He in his mind will bear.
He did the power of His works
unto His people show,
When He the heathens heritage
upon them did bestow.
His handy-works are truth and right:
all His commands are sure;
And done in truth and uprightness,
they evermore endure.
He sent redemption to His folk,
His Covenant for ay
He did command: Holy His Name
and reverend is always.
Wisdoms beginning is Gods fear:
good understanding they
Have all, that His commands fulfill:
His praise endures for ay.
PSALM. CXII.
PRaise ye the Lord. The man is blessed
that fears the Lord aright,
He who in His commandments
does greatly take delight.
His seed and offspring powerful
shall be the earth upon:
Of upright men blessed shall be
the generation.
Riches and wealth shall ever be
within his house in store:
And His unspotted righteousness
endures for evermore.
Unto the upright light does rise,
though he in darkness be:
Compassionate and merciful,
and righteous is he.
A good man does his favor show,
and does to others lend:
He with discretion his affairs
will guide unto the end.
Surely there is not any thing
that ever shall him move:
The righteous man's memorial
shall everlasting prove.
When he shall evil tidings hear,
he shall not be afraid;
His heart is fixed, his confidence
upon the Lord is staid.
His heart is firmly stablished,
afraid he shall not be,
Until upon his enemies
he his desire shall see.
He has dispersed, given to the poor,
his righteousness shall be
To ages all; with honor shall
his horn be raised high.
The wicked shall it see, and fret,
his teeth gnash, melt away:
What wicked men do most desire
shall utterly decay.
PSALM. CXIII.
PRaise God: ye servants of the Lord,
O praise, the Lords Name praise.
Yea, blessed be the Name of God
from this time forth always.
From rising Sun, to where it sets,
Gods Name is to be praised.
Above all nations God is high,
'bove heaven His glory raised.
Unto the Lord, our God, that dwells
on high, who can compare?
Himself that humbles things to see
in heaven and earth that are.
He from the dust does raise the poor,
that very low did ly,
And from the dunghill lifts the man
oppressed with poverty:
That He may highly him advance,
and with the Princes set,
With those that of His people are
the chief, even Princes great
The barren woman house to keep
He makes, and to be
Of sons a mother full of joy.
Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSALM. CXIV.
When Israel out of Egypt went,
and did his dwelling change,
When Jacobs house went out from those
that were of language strange,
He Judah did His Sanctuary,
His Kingdom Israel make:
The sea it saw, and quickly fled,
Jordan was driven back.
Like rams the mountains, and like lambs
the hills skipt to and fro:
O sea why stedst thou? Jordan back
why wast thou driven so?
Ye mountains great, wherefore was it,
that ye did skip like rams?
And wherefore was it, little hills,
that ye did leap like lambs?
O at the presence of the Lord
earth tremble thou for fear,
While as the presence of the God
of Jacob does appear.
Who from the hard and stony rock
did standing water bring,
And by His power did turn the flint
into a water spring.
PSALM. CXV.
NOt unto us, Lord, not to us,
but do thou glory take
Unto thy Name, even for thy truth,
and for thy mercies sake.
O wherefore should the heathen say,
Where is their God now gone?
But our God in the heavens is,
what pleased Him He has done.
Their idols silver are and gold,
work of men's hands they be:
Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
and eyes, but do not see.
Ears have they, but they do not hear;
noses, but savor not:
Hands, feet, but handle not, nor walk,
nor speak they through their throat.
Like them their makers are, and all
on them their trust that build.
O Israel, trust thou in the Lord,
He is their help and shield.
O Aarons house, trust in the Lord,
their help and shield is He.
Ye that fear God, trust in the Lord,
their help and shield He Will be.
The Lord of us has mindful been,
and He will bless us still,
He will the house of Israel bless,
bless Aarons house He will.
Both small and great that fear the Lord
He will them surely bless.
The Lord will you, you and your seed
ay more and more increase.
O blessed are ye of the Lord,
who made the earth and heaven.
The heaven, even heavens are Gods, but He
earth to men's sons has given.
The dead, nor who to silence go,
Gods praise do not record.
But henceforth we for ever will
bless God* Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM. CXVI.
I Love the Lord, because my voice
and prayers He did hear.
I, while I live, will call on Him,
who bowed to me His ear.
Of death the cords, and sorrows did
about me compass round,
The pains of hell took hold on me,
I grief and trouble found.
Upon the Name of God, the Lord,
then did I call, and say,
Deliver Thou my soul, O Lord,
I do thee humbly pray.
God merciful and righteous is,
yea, gracious is our Lord.
God saves the meek: I was brought low,
He did me help afford.
O thou my soul, do thou return
unto thy quiet rest
For largely lo* the Lord to thee
His bounty has expressed.
For my distressed soul from death
delivered was by Thee,
Thou did my mourning eyes from tears,
my feet from falling, free.
I in the land of those that live
will walk the Lord before.
I did believe, therefore I spoke:
I was afflicted sore.
I said when I was in my haste,
That all men liars be.
What shall I render to the Lord,
for all His gifts to me?
I Will of salvation take the cup,
on Gods Name will I call:
I Will pay my vows now to the Lord,
before His people all.
Dear in Gods sight is His saints death.
Thy servant, Lord, am I,
Thy servant sure, Thine handmaids son:
my bands Thou did unty.
Thank-offerings I to Thee will give,
and on Gods Name will call.
I Will pay my vows now to the Lord,
before His people all
Within the courts of Gods own house,
within the midst of thee,
O City of Jerusalem.
Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSALM. CXVII.
O give ye praise unto the Lord,
all nations that be:
Likewise, ye people all, accord
His Name to magnify.
For great to usward ever are
His loving kindnesses:
His truth endures for evermore.
The Lord O do ye bless.
PSALM. CXVIII.
O praise the Lord, for He is good:
His mercy lasts ever.
Let those of Israel now say,
His mercy fails never.
Now let the house of Aaron say,
His mercy lasts ever.
Let those that fear the Lord now say,
His mercy fails never.
I in distress called on the Lord;
the Lord did answer me,
He in a large place did me set,
from trouble made me free.
The mighty Lord is on my side.
I will not be afraid:
For any thing that man can do
I shall not be dismayed.
The Lord does take my part with them
that help to succor me:
Therefore on those that do me hate
I my desire shall see.
Better it is to trust in God,
then trust in man's defense:
Better to trust in God, then make
Princes our confidence.
The nations, joining all in one,
did compass me about:
But in the Lords most Holy Name
I shall them all root out.
They compast me about, I say,
they compast me about:
But in the Lords most Holy Name
I shall them all root out.
Like Bees they compast me about:
like unto thorns that flame
They quenched are: for them shall I
destroy in Gods own Name.
Thou sore have thrust, that I might fall,
but my Lord helped me.
God my salvation is become,
my strength and song is He.
In dwellings of the righteous
is heard the melody
Of joy and health: the Lords right hand
does ever valiantly.
The right hand of the Mighty Lord
exalted is on hy:
The right hand of the Mighty Lord
does ever valiantly.
I shall not die, but live, and shall
the works of God discover.
The Lord has me chastised sore,
but not to death given over.
O set ye open unto me
the gates of righteousness:
Then will I enter into them,
and I the Lord will bless.
This is the gate of God, by it
the just shall enter in.
Thee will I praise, for thou me heardst,
and have my safety bin.
That stone, is made head cornerstone,
which builders did despise:
This is the doing of the Lord,
and wondrous in our eyes.
This is the day God made, in it
we will joy triumphantly.
Save now I pray thee, Lord, I pray
send now prosperity.
Blessed is He, in Gods great Name
that comes us to save.
We, from the house which to the Lord
pertains, you blessed have.
God is the Lord, who unto us
has made light to arise:
Bind ye unto the altars horns,
with cords, the sacrifice.
Thou art my God, I Will thee exalt:
my God, I will thee praise.
Give thanks to God, for He is good,
His mercy lasts always.
PSALM. CXIX.
ALEPH. The first part.
BLessed are they that undefiled,
and straight are in the way:
Who in the Lords most holy Law
do walk, and do not stray,
Blessed are they, who to observe
His statutes are inclined;
And who do seek the living God
with their whole heart and mind.
Such in his ways do walk, and they
do no iniquity:
Thou have commanded us to keep
thy precepts carefully.
O that thy statutes to observe
thou would my ways direct:
Then shall I not be shamed, when I
thy precepts all respect.
Then with integrity of heart
thee will I praise and bless,
When I the judgments all have learned
of thy pure righteousness.
That I will keep thy statutes all
firmly resolved have I:
O do not then, most gracious God,
forsake me utterly.
BETH. The 2. part.
By what means shall a young man learn
his way to purify?
If he according to thy Word
thereto attentive be.
Unfainedly Thee have I sought
with all my soul and heart:
O let me not from the right path
of thy commands depart.
Thy word I in my heart have hid,
that I offend not thee.
O Lord, thou ever blessed art,
thy statutes teach thou me.
The judgments of thy mouth each one
my lips declared have:
More joy thy testimonies way
then riches all, me gave.
I will thy holy precepts make
my meditation:
And carefully I Will have respect
unto thy ways each one.
Upon thy statutes my delight
shall constantly be set:
And by thy grace I never will
thy holy word forget.
GIMEL. The 3. part.
With me thy servant, in thy grace,
deal bountifully, Lord:
That by thy favor I may live,
and duly keep thy word.
Open mine eyes, that of thy Law
the wonders I may see.
I am a stranger on this earth,
hide not thy Laws from me.
My soul within me breaks, and does
much fainting still endure,
Through longing that it has all times
unto thy judgments pure.
Thou have rebuked the cursed proud,
who from thy precepts swerve.
Reproach and shame remove from me,
for I thy Laws observe.
Against me Princes spoke with spite,
while they in council sat:
But I, thy servant, did upon
thy statutes meditate.
My comfort, and my hearts delight
thy testimonies be,
And they in all my doubts and fears
are counselors to me.
DALETH. The 4. part.
My soul to dust cleaves: quicken me
according to thy word.
My ways I showed, and me thou heardst:
teach me thy statutes, Lord.
The way of thy commandments
make me aright to know:
So all thy works, that wondrous are,
I shall to others show.
My soul does melt, and drop away,
for heaviness and grief:
To me, according to thy word,
give strength, and send relief.
From me the wicked way of lies
let far removed be,
And graciously thy holy Law
do thou grant unto me.
I chosen have the perfect way
of truth and verity:
Thy judgments, that most righteous are,
before me, laid, have I.
I to thy testimonies cleave:
shame do not on me cast.
I Will run thy precepts way, when thou
my heart enlarged have.
HE. The 5. part.
Teach me, O Lord, the perfect way
of thy precepts divine,
And to observe it to the end
I shall my heart incline.
Give understanding unto me,
so keep thy Law shall I;
Yea, even with my whole heart, I shall
observe it carefully.
In thy Laws path make me to go,
for I delight therein.
My heart unto thy testimonies,
and not to greed incline.
Turn thou away my sight and eyes
from viewing vanity,
And in thy good and holy way
be pleased to quicken me.
Confirm to me thy gracious word,
which I did gladly hear,
Even to thy servant, Lord, who is
devoted to thy fear.
Turn thou away my feared reproach:
for good thy judgments be.
Lo, for thy precepts I have longed:
in thy truth quicken me.
VAU. The 6. part.
Let thy sweet mercies also come,
and visit me, O Lord,
Even thy benign salvation,
according to thy word.
So shall I have wherewith I may
give him an answer just,
Who spitefully reproacheth me:
for in thy word I trust.
The word of truth out of my mouth
take thou not utterly:
For on thy judgments righteous
my hope does still rely.
So shall I keep for evermore
thy Law continually:
And since that I thy precepts seek,
I Will walk at liberty.
I Will speak thy word to Kings, and I
with shame shall not be moved:
And will delight my self always
in thy Laws, which I loved.
To thy commandments which I loved,
my hands lift up I will:
And I will also meditate
upon thy statutes still.
ZAIN. The 7. part.
Remember, Lord, thy gracious word,
thou to thy servant spoke,
Which, for a ground of my sure hope,
thou causedst me to take.
This word of thine my comfort is
in my affliction:
For in my straits I am revived
by this thy word alone.
The men whose hearts with pride are stuffed,
did greatly me deride:
Yet from thy straight commandments
I have not turned aside,
Thy judgments righteous, O Lord,
which thou of old forth gave,
I did remember, and my self
by them comforted have.
Horror took hold on me, because
ill men thy Law forsake.
I in my house of pilgrimage
thy Laws my songs do make.
Thy Name by night, Lord, I did mind,
and I have kept thy Law.
And this I had, because thy word
I kept, and stood in aw.
CHETH. The 8. part.
Thou my sure portion art alone,
which I did choose, O Lord:
I have resolved and said, that I
would keep thy holy word.
With my whole heart I did entreat
thy face, and favor free:
According to thy gracious word
be merciful to me.
I thought upon my former ways,
and did my life well try:
And to thy testimonies pure
my feet then turned I.
I did not stay, nor linger long,
as those that slothful are,
But hastily thy Laws to keep
my self I did prepare.
Bands of ill men me robbed; yet I
thy precepts did not slight.
I Will rise at midnight, thee to praise,
even for thy judgments right.
I am companion to all those,
who fear, and thee obey.
O Lord, thy mercy fills the earth:
teach me thy Laws, I pray.
TETH. The 9. part.
Well have thou with thy servant dealt,
as thou did promise give.
Good judgment me, and knowledge, teach;
for I thy word believe.
Ere I afflicted was, I strayed,
but now I keep thy word,
Both good thou art, and good thou do:
teach me thy statutes, Lord.
The men, that are puffed up with pride,
against me forged a ly:
Yet thy commandments observe
with my whole heart will I.
Their hearts, through worldly ease and wealth,
as fat as grease they be:
But in thy holy Law I take
delight continually.
It has been very good for me,
that I afflicted was,
That I might well instructed be,
and learn thy holy Laws.
The word that comes from thy mouth
is better unto me,
Then many thousands, and great sums
of gold and silver be.
JOD. The 10. part.
Thou made and fashionedst me: thy Laws
to know give wisdom, Lord.
So who thee fear, shall joy to see
me trusting in thy word.
That very right thy judgments are
I know and do confess,
And that thou have afflicted me
in truth and faithfulness.
O let thy kindness merciful,
I pray thee, comfort me,
As to thy servant faithfully
was promised by thee.
And let thy tender mercies come
to me, that I may live:
Because thy holy Laws to me
sweet delectation give.
Lord, let the proud ashamed be:
for they, without a cause,
With me perversely deal; but I
will muse upon thy Laws.
Let such as fear thee, and have known
thy statutes, turn to me.
My heart let in thy Laws be sound,
that shamed I never be.
CAPH. The 11. part.
My soul for thy salvation faints:
yet I thy word believe.
Mine eyes fail for thy word: I say,
When will thou comfort give?
For like a bottle I Am become,
that in the smoke is set:
I Am black and parcht with grief, yet I
thy statutes not forget.
How many are thy servants days?
when will thou execute
Just judgment on these wicked men
that do me persecute?
The proud have dug pits for me,
which is against thy Laws.
Thy words all faithful are: help me
pursued without a cause.
They so consumed me, that on earth
my life they scarce did leave:
Thy precepts yet forsook I not,
but close to them I clave.
After thy loving kindness, Lord,
me quicken, and preserve:
The testimony of thy mouth
so shall I still observe.
LAMED. The 12. part.
Thy word for ever is, O Lord,
in heaven settled fast:
Unto all generations
thy faithfulness does last.
The earth thou have established,
and it abides by thee:
This day they stand, as thou ordained:
for all thy servants be.
Unless in thy most perfect Law
my soul delights had found,
I should have perished, when as
my troubles did abound.
Thy precepts I will never forget:
they quickening to me brought.
Lord, I am thine: O save thou me:
thy precepts I have sought.
For me the wicked have laid wait,
me seeking to destroy:
But I thy testimonies true
consider will with joy.
An end of all perfection
here have I seen, O God:
But as for thy commandment
it is exceeding broad.
MEM. The 13. part.
O how love I thy Law! it is
my study all the day.
It makes me wiser then my foes:
for it does with me stay.
Then all my teachers, now I have
more understanding far:
Because my meditation
thy* testimonies are.
In understanding I excel
those that are ancients,
For I endeavored to keep
all thy commandments.
My feet from each ill way I stayed,
that I may keep thy word.
I from thy judgments have not swerved,
for thou have taught me, Lord.
How sweet unto my taste, O Lord,
are all thy words of truth!
Yea, I do find them sweeter far,
then honey to my mouth.
I, through thy precepts that are pure,
do understanding get:
I therefore every way that is false
with all my heart do hate.
NUN. The 14. part.
Thy word is to my feet a lamp,
and to my path a light.
I sworn have, and I will perform,
to keep thy judgments right.
I am with sore affliction
even overwhelmed, O Lord:
In mercy raise, and quicken me,
according to thy word.
The free will offerings of my mouth
accept, I thee beseech:
And unto me thy servant, Lord,
thy judgments clearly teach.
Though still my soul be in my hand,
thy Laws I Will not forget.
I erred not from them, though for me
the wicked snares did set.
I of thy testimonies have
above all things made choice,
To be my heritage for ay,
for they my Heart rejoice.
I carefully inclined have
my heart, still to attend,
That I thy statures may perform
always unto the end.
SAMECH. The 15. part.
I hate the thoughts of vanity,
but love thy Law do I.
My shield and hiding place thou art:
I on thy word rely.
All ye that evil doers are,
from me depart away;
For the commandments of my God
I purpose to obey.
According to thy faithful word
uphold and stablish me,
That I may live, and of my hope
ashamed never be.
Hold thou me up, so shall I be
in peace and safety still,
And to thy statutes have respect
continually I will.
Thou treadst down all that love to stray,
false their deceit does prove.
Lewd men, like dross, away thou putst,
therefore thy Law I love.
For fear of thee my very flesh
does tremble, all dismayed;
And of thy righteous judgments, Lord,
my soul is much afraid.
AIN. The 16. part.
To all men I have judgment done,
performing justice right:
Then let me not be left unto
my fierce oppressors might.
For good unto thy servant, Lord,
thy servants surety be:
From the oppression of the proud
do thou deliver me.
Mine eyes do fail with looking long
for thy salvation,
The word of thy pure righteousness
while I do wait upon.
In mercy with thy servant deal,
thy Laws me teach and show:
I am thy servant, wisdom give,
that I thy Laws may know.
It Is time thou work, Lord: for they have
made void thy Law divine:
Therefore thy precepts more I love
then gold, yea gold most fine.
Concerning all things, thy commands
all right I judge therefore:
And every false and wicked way
I perfectly abhore.
PE. The 17. part.
Thy statutes, Lord, are wonderful,
my soul them keeps with care.
The entrance of thy words gives light,
makes wise who simple are.
My mouth I have wide opened,
and panted earnestly,
While after thy commandments
I longed exceedingly.
Look on me, Lord, and merciful
do thou unto me prove,
As thou art wont to do to those,
thy Name who truly love.
O let my footsteps in thy word
aright still ordered be:
Let no iniquity obtain
dominion over me.
From man's oppression save thou me
so keep thy Laws I will.
Thy face make on thy servant shine:
teach me the statutes still.
Rivers of waters from mine eyes
did run down, when I saw
How wicked men run on in sin,
and do not keep thy Law.
TSADDI. The 18. part.
O Lord, thou art most righteous,
thy judgments are upright.
Thy testimonies thou command'st
most faithful are and right.
My zeal has even consumed me,
because mine enemies
Thy holy words forgotten have,
and do thy Laws despise.
Thy word's most pure, therefore on it
thy servants love is set.
Small, and despised I am, yet I
thy precepts not forget.
Thy righteousness, is righteousness
which ever does endure:
Thy holy Law, Lord, also is
the very truth most pure.
Trouble and anguish have me found,
and taken hold on me:
Yet in my trouble my delight
thy just commandments be.
Eternal righteousness is in
thy testimonies all:
Lord, to me understanding give,
and ever live I shall.
KOPH. The 19. part.
With my whole heart I cried, Lord, hear:
I will thy word obey.
I cried to thee, save me, and I
will keep thy Laws always.
I of the morning did prevent
the dawning, and did cry:
For all my expectation
did on thy word rely.
Mine eyes did timously prevent
the watches of the night,
That in thy word, with careful mind,
then meditate I might,
After thy loving kindness hear
my voice, that calls on thee:
According to thy judgment, Lord,
revive and quicken me.
Who follow mischief, they draw nigh;
they from thy Law are far:
But thou art near, Lord: most firm truth
all thy commandments are.
As for thy testimonies all,
of old this have I tried,
That thou have surely founded them,
for ever to abide.
RESH. The 20. part.
Consider mine affliction,
in safety do me set:
Deliver me, O Lord, for I
thy Law do not forget.
After thy word revive thou me;
save me, and plead my cause.
Salvation is from sinners far,
for they seek not thy Laws.
O Lord, both great and manifold
thy tender mercies be:
According to thy judgments just
revive and quicken me.
My persecuters many are,
and foes, which do combine:
Yet from thy testimonies pure
my heart does not decline.
I saw transgressors, and was grieved:
for they keep not thy word.
See how I love thy Law! as thou
art kind, me quicken, Lord.
From the beginning all thy word
has been most true and sure:
Thy righteous judgments every one
for evermore endure.
SHIN. The 21. part.
Princes have persecuted me,
although no cause they saw:
But still of thy most holy word
my heart does stand in aw.
I at thy word rejoice, as one
of spoil that finds great store.
Thy Law I love, but lying all
I hate and do abhor.
Seven times a day it is my care
to give due praise to thee:
Because of all thy judgments, Lord,
which righteous ever be.
Great peace have they who love thy Law:
offense they shall have none.
I hoped for thy salvation, Lord,
and thy commands have done.
My soul thy testimonies pure
observed carefully:
On them my heart is set, and them
I love exceedingly.
Thy testimonies and thy Laws
I kept, with special care:
For all my works, and ways each one
before thee open are.
TAU. The 22. part.
O let my earnest prayer and cry
come near before thee, Lord:
Give understanding unto me
according to thy word,
Let my request before thee come:
after thy word me free.
My lips shall utter praise, when thou
have taught thy Laws to me.
My tongue of thy most blessed word
shall speak, and it confess:
Because all thy commandments
are perfect righteousness.
Let thy strong hand make help to me:
thy precepts are my choice.
I longed for thy salvation, Lord,
and in thy Law rejoice.
O let my soul live, and it shall
give praises unto thee:
And let thy judgments gracious
be helpful unto me.
I like a lost sheep went astray,
thy servant seek, and find:
For thy commands I suffered not
to slip out of my mind.
PSALM. CXX. A song of degrees.
IN my distress to God I cried,
and He gave ear to me.
From lying lips, and guilful tongue
O Lord, my soul set free.
What shall be given thee? or what shall
be done to thee, false tongue?
Even burning coals of juniper,
sharp arrows of the strong.
Wo's me, that I in Mesech am
a sojourner so long;
That I in tabernacles dwell
to Kedar that belong.
My soul with him that hates peace
has long a dweller been.
I am for peace: but when I speak
for battle they are keen.
PSALM. CXXI. A song of degrees.
I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
from whence does come mine aid:
My safety comes from the Lord,
who heaven and earth has made.
Thy foot He Will not let slide, nor will
He slumber that thee keeps:
Behold, He that keeps Israel,
He slumbers not, nor sleeps.
The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade
on thy right hand does stay:
The Moon by night thee shall not smite,
nor yet the Sun by day.
The Lord shall keep thy soul, He shall
preserve thee from all ill:
Henceforth thy going out and in
God keep for ever will.
PSALM. CXXII. A song of degrees of David.
I joy'd, when to the house of God
go up, they said to me.
Jerusalem within thy gates
our feet shall standing be.
Jerusalem as a city is
compactly built together:
Unto that place the Tribes go up,
the Tribes of God go thither,
To Isreal's testimony, there
to Gods Name thanks to pay.
For thrones of judgment, even the thrones
of David's house there stay.
Pray that Jerusalem may have
peace and felicity:
Let them, that love thee and thy peace,
have still prosperity.
Therefore I wish that peace may still
within thy walls remain,
And ever may thy palaces
prosperity retain.
Now, for my friends and brethrens sake,
peace be in thee, I Will say:
And for the house of God our Lord,
I Will seek thy good always.
PSALM. CXXIII. A song of degrees.
O thou that dwell in the heavens,
I lift mine eyes to Thee.
Behold, as servants eyes do look
their masters hand to see,
As handmaids eyes her mistress hand,
so do our eyes attend
Upon the Lord our God, until
to us he mercy send.
O Lord, be gracious to us,
unto us gracious be:
Because replenished with contempt
exceedingly are we.
Our soul is filled with scorn of those
that at their ease abide,
And with the insolent contempt
of those that swell in pride.
PSALM CXXIV. A song of degrees of David.
HAd not the Lord been on our side,
may Israel now say:
Had not the Lord been on our side,
when men rose us to slay:
They had us swallowed quick when as
their wrath against us did flame:
Waters had covered us, our soul
had sunk beneath the stream.
Then had the waters, swelling high,
over our soul made way.
Blessed be the Lord, who to their teeth
us gave not for a prey.
Our soul's escaped, as a bird
out of the fowlers snare:
The snare asunder broken is,
and we escaped are.
Our sure, and all-sufficient help
is in JEHOVAH'S Name;
His Name, who did the heaven create,
and who the earth did frame.
Another of the same.
NOw Israel
may say, and that truly,
If that the Lord
had not our cause maintained:
If that the Lord
had not our right sustained,
When cruel men
against us furiously
Rose up in wrath,
to make of us their prey.
Then certainly
they had devoured us all,
And swallowed quick,
for ought that we could deem;
Such was their rage,
as we might well esteem:
And as fierce floods
before them all things drown,
So had they brought
our soul to death quite down.
The raging streams,
with their proud swelling waves,
Had then our soul
ov'rwhelmed in the deep:
But blessed be God,
who does us sefely keep.
And has not given
us for a living prey
Unto their teeth
and bloody cruelty.
Even as a bird
out of the fowlers snare
Escapes away,
so is our soul set free;
Broke are their nets,
and thus escaped we.
Therefore our help
is in the Lords great Name,
Who heaven and earth
by his great power did frame.
PSALM. CXXV. A song of degrees.
THey, in the Lord that firmly trust,
shall be like Zion hill,
Which at no time can be removed,
but stands ever still.
As round about Jerusalem
the mountains stand always,
The Lord His folk does compass so
from henceforth and for ay.
For ill men's rod upon the lot
of just men shall not ly,
Left righteous men stretch forth their hands
unto iniquity.
Do thou to all those that be good
thy goodness, Lord, impart;
And do thou good to those that are
upright within their heart.
But as for such as turn aside
after their crooked way,
God shall lead forth with wicked men:
on Israel peace shall stay,
PSALM. CXXVI. A song of degrees.
When Zions bondage God turned back,
as men that dreamed were we.
Then filled with laughter was our mouth,
our tongue with melody:
They among the heathen said, The Lord
great things for them has wrought:
The Lord has done great things for us,
whence joy to us is brought.
As streams of water in the South,
our bondage, Lord, recall.
Who sow in tears, a reaping time
of joy enjoy they shall.
That man, who bearing precious seed,
in going forth does mourn,
He doubtless, bringing back his sheaves,
rejoicing shall return.
PSALM. CXXVII. A song of degrees for Solomon.
EXcept the Lord do build the house,
the builders lose their pain:
Except the Lord the city keep,
the watchmen watch in vain.
It Is vain for you to rise betimes,
or late from rest to keep,
To feed on sorrows bread: so gives
He his beloved sleep.
Lo, children are Gods heritage,
the wombs-fruit His reward.
The sons of youth as arrows are
for strong men's hands prepared.
O happy is the man that has
his quiver filled with those:
They, unashamed, in the gate
shall speak unto their foes.
PSALM. CXXVIII. A song of degrees.
Blessed is each one that fears the Lord,
and walks in his ways.
For of thy labor thou shall eat,
and happy be always.
Thy wife shall, as a fruitful vine,
by thy house sides, be found,
Thy children like to olive plants
about thy table round.
Behold, the man that fears the Lord,
thus blessed shall he be.
The Lord shall out of Zion give
His blessing unto thee:
Thou shall Jerusalems good behold,
whilst thou on earth do dwell.
Thou shall thy childrens children see,
and peace on Israel.
PSALM. CXXIX. A song of degrees.
Often did they vex me from my youth,
may Israel now declare:
Often did they vex me from my youth,
yet not victorious were.
The plowers plowed upon my back,
they long their furrows drew.
The righteous Lord did cut the cords
of the ungodly crew.
Let Zions haters all be turned
back with confusion.
As grass on houses tops be they,
which fades ere it be grown:
Whereof enough to fill his hand
the mower can not find:
Nor can the man his bosom fill,
whose work is, sheaves to bind.
Neither say they who do go by,
Gods blessing on you rest;
We, in the Name of God, the Lord,
do wish you to be blessed.
PSALM. CXXX. A song of degrees.
LOrd, from the depths to thee I cried.
My voice, Lord, do thou hear:
Unto my supplications voice,
give an attentive ear.
Lord, who shall stand, if thou, O Lord,
should mark iniquity?
But yet with Thee forgiveness is,
that feared Thou may be.
I wait for God, my soul does wait,
my hope is in His word.
More then they, that for morning watch,
my soul waits for the Lord:
I say, more then they that do watch
the morning light to see.
Let Israel hope in the Lord,
for with Him mercies be,
And plenteous redemption
is ever found with Him.
And from all his iniquities
he Israel shall redeem.
PSALM. CXXXI. A song of degrees of David.
MY heart not haughty is, O Lord,
mine eyes not lofty be:
Nor do I deal in matters great,
or things for me too hie.
I surely have my self behaved
with quiet sp'rit and mild,
As child of mother weaned: my soul
is like a weaned child.
Upon the Lord let all the hope
of Israel rely,
Even from the time that present is
unto eternity.
PSALM. CXXXII. A song of degrees.
DAvid, and his afflictions all,
Lord, do thou think upon:
How unto God he swear, and vowed
to Jacobs mighty One.
I will not come within my house,
nor rest in bed at all:
Nor shall mine eyes take any sleep,
nor eyelids slumber shall,
Till for the Lord a place I find,
where He may make abode:
A place of habitation
for Jacobs mighty God.
Lo, at the place of Ephratah
of it we understood:
And we did find it in the fields
and city of the wood.
We'll go into His Tabernacles,
and at His footstool bow.
Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest,
the Ark of Thy strength, and Thou.
O let Thy Priests be clothed, Lord,
with truth and righteousness:
And let all those that are Thy saints
shout loud for joyfulnesse.
For thine own servant David's sake,
do not deny Thy grace,
Nor of Thine own anointed one
turn Thou away the face.
The Lord in truth to David swear,
He will not turn from it,
I of thy bodies fruit will make
upon thy throne to sit.
My Covenant if thy sons will keep,
and Laws to them made known,
Their children then shall also sit
for ever on Thy throne.
For God of Zion has made choice,
there He desires to dwell.
This is My rest, here still I Will stay,
for I do like it well.
Her food I Will greatly bless, her poor
with bread will satisfy.
Her priests I Will cloathe with health, her saints
shall shout forth joyfullie.
And there will I make David's horn
to bud forth pleasantly:
For him that Mine anointed is,
a lamp ordained have I.
As with a garment, I will cloathe
with shame his enemies all:
But yet the crown that he does wear,
upon him flourish shall.
PSALM. CXXXIII. A song of degrees of David.
BEhold, how good a thing it is,
and how becoming well,
Together such as brethren are
in unity to dwell.
Like precious ointment on the head,
that down the beard did flow,
Even Aarons beard, and to the skirts
did of his garments go.
As Hermons dew, the dew that does
on Zion hills descend:
For there the blessing God commands,
life that shall never end.
PSALM. CXXXIV. A song of degrees.
BEhold, bless ye the Lord, all ye
that his attendants are,
Even you that in Gods Temple be,
and praise Him nightly there.
Your hands within Gods holy place
lift up, and praise His Name.
From Zion hill the Lord thee bless,
that heaven and earth did frame.
PSALM. CXXXV.
PRaise ye the Lord; the Lords Name praise,
His servants praise ye God:
Who stand in Gods house, in the Courts
of our God make abode.
Praise ye the Lord, for He is good,
unto Him praises sing:
Sing praises to His Name, because
it is a pleasant thing.
For Jacob to Himself the Lord
did choose, of His good pleasure,
And He has chosen Israel
for His peculiar treasure.
Because I know assuredly
the Lord is very great,
And that our Lord, above all gods,
in glory has His seat.
What thing soever pleased the Lord,
that in the heaven did He,
And in the earth, the seas, and all
the places deep that be.
He from the ends of earth does make
the vapors to ascend:
With rain He lightnings makes, and wind
does from His treasures send.
Aegypts firstborn from man to beast
who smore. Strange tokens He
On Pharaoh, and his servants sent,
Egypt, in midst of thee.
He smote great nations, flew great Kings:
Sihon of Heshbon King,
And Og of Bashan, and to naught
did Canaans Kingdoms bring.
And for a wealthy heritage
their pleasant land He gave,
An heritage which Israel
His chosen folk should have.
Thy Name, O Lord, shall still endure,
and Thy memorial
With honor shall continued be
to generations all.
For why, the righteous God will judge
His people righteouslie,
Concerning those that do Him serve
Himself repent will He.
The idols of the nations
of silver are and gold,
And by the hands of men is made
their fashion and mold.
Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
eyes, but they do not see:
Ears have they but hear not, and in
their mouths no breathing be.
Their makers are like them, so are
all that on them rely.
O Isreal's house bless God; bless God
O Aarons family.
O bless the Lord of Levies house
ye who His servants are;
And bless the Holy Name of God
all ye the Lord that fear.
And blessed be the Lord our God,
from Zions holy hill,
Who dwells at Jerusalem.
The Lord O praise ye still.
PSALM. CXXXVI.

Their land in heritage to have,

In our low state who on us thought:
for He has mercy ever.
And from our foes our freedom wrought*
for His grace fails never.
Who does all flesh with food relieve:
for He has mercy ever.
Thanks to the God of heaven give:
for His grace fails never.
Another of the same.

Most firm and sure
Eternally.
The Lord of lords praise ye,

For certainly, etc.
Which God Omnipotent,
By might and wisdom hie,

For certainly, etc.
To Him who did outstretch
This earth so great and wide,
Above the waters reach
Making it to abide:
For certainly, etc.

Which shines in our sight:

To guide the darksome night:
For certainly, etc.

Who did his message scorn;
And in His anger hot
Did kill all their firstborn:
For certainly, etc.
Thence Israel out He brought:
For His grace lasts ever.
With a strong hand He wrought,
And stretched out arm deliver:
For certainly, etc.
The sea He cut in two;
For His grace lasts still:
And through its midst to go
Made His own Israel:
For certainly, etc.
But overwhelmed and lost
Was proud King Pharao,
With all his mighty host,
And chariots there also:
For certainly, etc.
To Him who pow'rfully
His chosen people led,
Even through the desert dry,
And in that place them fed:
For certainly, etc.
To Him great Kings who smote:
For His grace has no bound.
Who slew and spared not
Kings famous and renownd:
For certainly, etc.
Sihon the Amorites King:
For His grace lasts ever.
Og also who did reign
The land of Bashan over:
For certainly, etc.
Their land by lot He gave,
For His grace fails never,
That Israel might it have,
In heritage for ever:
For certainly, etc.
Who has remembered
Us, in our low estate;
And us delivered
From foes who did us hate:
For certainly, etc.
Who to all flesh gives food:
For His grace fails never.
Give thanks to God most good,
The God of heaven for ever:
For certainly, etc.
PSALM. CXXXVII.
BY Babels streams we sat, and wept,
when Zion we thought on.
In midst thereof we hanged our harps
the willow trees upon.
For there a song required they
who did us captive bring;
Our spoilers called for mirth, and said,
A song of Zion sing.
O how the Lords song shall we sing
within a fora in land?
If thee Jerusalem I forget,
skill part from my right hand.
My tongue to my mouths roof let cleave,
if I do thee forget
Jerusalem, and thee above
my chief joy do not set.
Remember Edoms children, Lord,
who in Jerusalems day,
Even unto its foundation
raze, raze it quite, did say.
O daughter thou of Babylon,
near to destruction,
Blessed shall he be that thee rewards,
as thou to us have done.
Yea, happy surely shall he be,
thy tender little ones
Who shall lay hold upon, and them
shall dash against the stones.
PSALM. CXXXVIII. A Psalm of David.
THee will I praise with all my heart,
I will sing praise to thee
Before the gods: And worship will
toward thy Sanctuary.
I Will praise thy Name, even for thy truth,
and kindness of thy love:
For thou thy word have magnified
all thy great Name above,
Thou did me answer in the day
when I to thee did cry:
And thou my fainting soul with strength
did strengthen inwardly.
All Kings upon the earth that are,
shall give thee praise, O Lord,
When as they from thy mouth shall hear
thy true and faithful word.
Yea, in the righteous ways of God
with gladness they shall sing:
For great's the Glory of the Lord,
who does for ever reign.
Though God be hie, yet He respects
all those that lowly be;
Whereas the proud and lofty ones
afar off knows He.
Though I in midst of trouble walk,
I life from thee shall have,
Against my foes wrath thou wilt stretch thine hand,
thy right hand shall me save.
Surely that which concerns me,
the Lord will perfect make:
Lord, still thy mercy lasts, Do not
thine own hands works forsake.
PSALM. CXXXIX. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
O Lord thou have me searched and known.
Thou know my sitting down,
And rising up; yea, all my thoughts
afar to thee are known.
My footsteps, and my lying down
thou compassest always;
Thou also most entirely art
acquaint with all my ways.
For in my tongue, before I speak,
not any word can be,
But altogether, lo, O Lord,
it is well known to thee.
Behind, before, thou have beset,
and laid on me thy hand.
Such knowledge is too strange for me,
too high to understand.
From thy sp'rit whither shall I go?
or from thy presence fly?
Ascend I heaven, lo, thou art there;
there if in hell I ly.
Take I the mornings wings, and dwell
in utmost parts of sea:
Even there, Lord, shall thy hand me lead,
thy right hand hold shall me.
If I do say, that darkness shall
me cover from thy sight,
Then surely shall the very night
about me be as light.
Yea, darkness hides not from thee,
but night does shine as day:
To thee the darkness and the light
are both alike always,
For thou possessed have my reins,
and thou have covered me,
When I within my mothers womb
enclosed was by thee,
Thee will I praise, for fearfully
and strangely made I am;
Thy works are marvelous, and right well
my soul does know the same.
My substance was not hid from thee,
when as in secret I
Was made, and in earths lowest parts
was wrought most curiously.
Thine eyes my substance did behold,
yet being unperfite,
And in the volume of thy book
my members all were writ,
Which after in continuance
were fashioned every one,
When as they yet all shapelesse were,
and of them there was none.
How precious also are thy thoughts
O gracious God, to me?
And in their sum how passing great
and numberless they be?
If I should count them, then the sand
they more in number be:
What time soever I awake,
I ever am with thee.
Thou, Lord, wilt sure the wicked slay:
hence from me bloody men.
Thy foes against thee lewdly speak,
and take thy Name in vain.
Do not I hate all those, O Lord,
that hatred bear to thee?
With those that up against thee rise
can I but grieved be?
With perfect hatred them I hate,
my foes I them do hold.
Search me, O God, and know my heart,
try me my thoughts unfold:
And see if any wicked way
there be at all in me;
And in thine everlasting way
to me a leader be.
PSALM. CXL. To the chief musician, A Psalm of David.
LOrd, from the ill and froward man
give me deliverance,
And do thou safe preserve me, from
the man of violence.
Who in their heart mischievous things
are meditating ever;
And they for war assembled are
continually together.
Much like unto a serpents tongue
their tongues they sharp do make;
And underneath their lips there lies
the poison of a snake.
Lord, keep me from the wickeds hands,
from violent men me save;
Who, utterly to overthrow
my goings, purposed have.
The proud for me a snare have hid,
and cords, yea they a net
Have by the way side for me spread,
they grins for me have set.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art
my God: unto the cry
Of all my supplications,
Lord, do thine ear apply.
O God the Lord, who art the strength
of my salvation,
A covering in the day of war
my head thou have put on.
Unto the wicked man, O Lord,
his wishes do not grant,
Nor further thou his ill device,
lest they themselves should vaunt.
As for the head and chief of those
about that compass me,
Even by the mischief of their lips
let thou them covered be.
Let burning coals upon them fall,
them throw in fiery flame,
And in deep pits, that they no more
may rise out of the same.
Let not an evill-speaker be
on earth established:
Mischief shall hunt the violent man
till he be ruined.
I know God will th'afflicteds cause
maintain, and poor men's right.
Surely the just shall praise thy Name,
th'upright dwell in thy sight.
PSALM. CXLI. A Psalm of David.
O Lord, I unto thee do cry,
do thou make haste to me,
And give an ear unto my voice,
when I cry unto thee.
As incense let my prayer be
directed in thine eyes;
And the uplifting of my hands
as th'ev'ning sacrifice.
Set, Lord, a watch before my mouth,
keep of my lips the door.
My heart incline thou not unto
the ills I should abhor,
To practice wicked works with men
that work iniquity:
And with their delicates my taste
let me not satisfy.
Let him that righteous is me smite,
it shall a kindness be;
Let him reprove, I shall it count
a precious oil to me:
Such smiting shall not break my head:
for yet the time shall fall,
When I in their calamities
to God pray for them shall.
When as their Judges down shall be
in stony places cast,
Then shall they hear my words, for they
shall sweet be to their taste.
About the graves devouring mouth
our bones are scattered round,
As wood, which men do cut and cleave,
lies scattered on the ground.
But unto thee, O God the Lord,
mine eyes uplifted be:
My soul do not leave destitute,
my trust is set on thee.
Lord, keep me safely from the snare,
which they for me prepare,
And from the subtle grinnes of them,
that wicked workers are.
Let workers of iniquity
into their own nets fall,
Whilst I do by thine help escape
the danger of them all.
PSALM. CXLXII. Maschil of David: a prayer when he was in the cave.
I with my voice cried to the Lord,
with it made my request:
Poured out to Him my plaint, to Him
my trouble I expressed.
When in me was overwhelmed my sp'rit,
then well thou knew'st my way:
Where I did walk, a snare for me
they privily did lay.
I looked on my right hand, and viewed,
but none to know me were;
All refuge failed me, no man
did for my soul take care.
I cried to thee, I said, Thou art
my refuge, Lord, alone,
And in the land of those that live
thou art my portion.
Because I am brought very low,
attend unto my cry;
Me from my persecuters save,
who stronger are then I.
From prison bring my soul, that I
thy Name may glorify:
The just shall compass me, when thou
with me dealst bounteously.
PSALM. CXLIII. A Psalm of David.
LOrd, hear my prayer, attend my suits
and in thy faithfulness
Give thou an answer unto me,
and in thy righteousness.
Thy servant also bring thou not
in judgment to be tried;
Because no living man can be
in thy sight justified,
For the enemy has pursued my soul,
my life to ground down tread:
In darkness he has made me dwell,
as who have long been dead.
My sprit is therefore overwhelmed
in me, perplexedly;
Within me is my very heart
amazed wondrously.
I call to mind the days of old,
to meditate I use
On all thy works; upon the deeds
I, of thy hands, do muse.
My hands to thee I stretch: my soul
thirsts, as dry land, for thee.
Haste, Lord, to hear, my spirit fails,
hide not thy face from me:
Lest like to them I do become,
that go down to the dust.
At morn let me thy kindness hear,
for in thee do I trust.
Teach me the way that I should walk,
I lift my soul to thee.
Lord, free me from my foes, I fly
to thee, to cover me.
Because thou art my God, to do
thy will do me instruct:
Thy sp'rit is good, me to the land
of uprightness conduct.
Revive and quicken me, O Lord,
even for thine own Names sake:
And do thou, for thy righteousness,
my soul from trouble take.
And of thy mercy slay my foes;
let all destroyed be
That do afflict my soul, for I
a servant am to thee.
Another of the same.
OH, hear my prayer, Lord,
And unto my desire
To bow thine ear accord,
I humbly thee require:
And in thy faithfulness
Unto me answer make,
And in thy righteousness
Upon me pity take.
In judgment enter not
With me thy servant poor:
For why, this well I wot,
No sinner can endure
The sight of thee, O God,
If thou his deeds shall try,
He dare make none abode
Himself to justify.
Behold the cruel foe
Me persecutes with spite,
My soul to overthrow:
Yea he my life down quite
Unto the ground has smote,
And made me dwell full low
In darkness, as forgot,
Or men dead long ago.
Therefore, my sprit much vexed
Overwhelmed is me within;
My heart right sore perplexed,
And desolate has bin.
Yet I do call to mind
What ancient days record,
Thy works of every kind
I think upon, O Lord.
Lo, I do stretch my hands
To thee my help alone,
For thou well understands
All my complaint and moan:
My thirsting soul desires,
And longs after Thee,
As thirsty ground requires
With rain refresht to be.
Lord, let my prayer prevail,
To answer it make speed,
For lo, my sp'rit does fail;
Hide not thy face in need,
Left I be like to those.
That do in darkness sit.
Or him that downward goes
Into the dreadful pit.
Because I trust in thee,
O Lord, cause me to hear
Thy loving kindness free,
When morning does appear:
Cause me to know the way
Wherein my path should be,
For why my soul on hie
I do lift up to thee.
From my fierce enemy
In safety do me guide,
Because I fly to thee,
Lord, that thou may me hide.
My God alone art thou,
Teach me thy righteousness:
Thy sp'rit's good, lead me to
The land of uprightness,
O Lord for thy Names sake,
Be pleased to quicken me:
And for thy truth, forth take
My soul from misery.
And of thy grace destroy
My foes, and put to shame
All who my soul annoy:
For I thy servant am.
PSALM. CXLIV. A Psalm of David.
O Blessed ever be the Lord,
who is my strength and might,
Who does instruct my hands to war,
my fingers teach to fight.
My goodness, fortress, my high tower,
deliverer, and shield,
In whom I trust; who under me
my people makes to yield.
Lord, what is man, that thou of him
do so much knowledge take?
Or son of man, that thou of him
so great account do make?
Man is like vanity: his days,
as shadows, pass away.
Lord* bow thy heavens come down, touch thou
the hills, and smoke shall they.
Cast forth thy lightning, scatter them:
thine arrows shoot, them rout.
Thine hand send from above me save,
from great depths draw me out:
And from the hand of children strange,
Whose mouth speaks vanity:
And their right hand is a right hand
that works deceitfully.
A new song I to thee will sing,
Lord, on a psalterie;
I, on a ten-string'd instrument,
will praises sing to thee.
Even He it is, that unto Kings
salvation does send:
Who His own servant David does
from hurtful sword defend.
O free me from strange childrens hands,
whose mouth speaks vanity;
And their right hand a right hand is,
that works deceitfully.
That as the plants our sons may be
in youth grown up that are;
Our daughters like to corner stones
cary'd like a palace fair.
That to afford all kind of store
our garners may be filled;
That our sheep thousands, in our streets
ten thousands they may yield.
That strong our oxen be for work,
that no in-breaking be,
Nor going out, and that our streets
may from complaints be free.
Those people blessed are, who be
in such a case as this:
Yea, blessed all those people are,
whose God JEHOVAH is.
PSALM. CXLV. David's psalm of praise.
I Will thee extol, my God, O King,
I Will bless thy Name always:
Thee will I bless each day, and will
thy Name for ever praise.
Great is the Lord, much to be praised,
His greatness search exceeds,
Race unto race shall praise thy works,
and show thy mighty deeds.
I of thy glorious Majesty
the Honor will record,
I Will speak of all thy mighty works,
which wondrous are, O Lord.
Men of thine acts the might shall show,
thine acts, that dreadful are:
And I, thy Glory to advance,
thy Greatness will declare.
The memory of thy goodness great
they largely shall express:
With songs of praise they shall extol
thy perfect righteousness.
The Lord is very gracious,
in him compassions flow,
In mercy He is very great,
and is to anger slow.
The Lord JEHOVAH unto all
His goodness does declare:
And over all His other works
His tender mercies are,
Thee all thy works shall praise, O Lord,
and thee thy saints shall bless.
They shall thy Kingdoms glory show,
thy power by speech express.
To make the sons of men to know
His acts done mightily,
And of His Kingdom th'excellent
and glorious Majesty.
Thy Kingdom shall for ever stand,
thy reign through ages all.
God raises all that are bowed down,
upholdeth all that fall.
The eyes of all things wait on thee,
the giver of all good,
And thou in time convenient
bestows on them their food.
Thy hand thou openest liberally,
and of thy bounty gives
Enough to satisfy the need
of every thing that lives.
The Lord is just in all his ways;
Holy, in his works all.
God's near to all that call on him,
in truth that on him call.
He will accomplish the desire
of those that do him fear:
He also will deliver them,
and he their cry will hear.
The Lord preserves all who Him love,
that naught can them annoy:
But he all those that wicked are
will utterly destroy.
My mouth the praises of the Lord
to publish, cease shall never:
Let all flesh bless his Holy Name
for ever and for ever.
Another of the same.
O Lord, that art my God and King,
Thee will I magnify and praise:
I will thee bless, and gladly sing
Unto thy holy Name always.
Each day I rise, I will thee bless,
And praise thy Name time without end.
Much to be praised, and great God is,
His Greatness none can comprehend.
Race shall thy works praise unto race,
The mighty acts show, done by thee.
I will speak of the glorious grace,
And honor of thy Majesty:
Thy wondrous works I will record.
By men the Might shall be extold
Of all thy dreadful acts, O Lord:
And I thy greatness will unfold.
They utter shall abundantly
The memory of thy goodness great,
And shall sing praises cheerfully,
Whilst they thy righteousness relate.
The Lord our God is gracious,
Compassionat is he also,
In mercy he is plenteous,
But unto wrath and anger slow.
Good unto all men is the Lord:
Over all his works his mercy is.
Thy works all praise to thee afford:
Thy saints, O Lord thy Name shall bless.
The glory of thy Kingdom show
Shall they, and of thy power tell.
That so men's sons his deeds may know,
His Kingdoms grace that does excel.
Thy Kingdom has none end at all,
It does through ages all remain.
The Lord upholdeth all that fall,
The cast-down raises up again.
The eyes of all things, Lord, attend,
And on thee wait, that here do live:
And thou in season due do send
Sufficient food them to relieve.
Yea, thou thine hand do open wide,
And every thing do satisfy,
That lives, and does on earth abide,
Of thy great liberality.
The Lord is just in his ways all,
And holy in his works each one.
He Is near to all that on him call,
Who call in truth on him alone.
God will the just desire fulfill
Of such as do him fear and dread:
Their cry regard, and hear he will,
And save them in the time of need.
The Lord preserves all, more and less,
That bear to him a loving heart:
But workers all of wickedness
Destroy will he, and clean subvert.
Therefore my mouth and lips I Will frame
To speak the praises of the Lord:
To magnify his holy Name
For ever let all flesh accord.
PSALM. CXLVI.
PRaise God: the Lord praise, O my soul.
I Will praise God while I live:
While I have being, to my God
in songs I Will praises give.
Trust not in Princes, nor man's son,
in whom there is no stay:
His breath departs, to's earth he turns,
that day his thoughts decay.
O happy is that man and blessed,
whom Jacobs God does aid,
Whose hope upon the Lord does rest,
and on his God is staid
Who made the earth and heavens high,
who made the swelling deep,
And all that is within the same:
who truth does ever keep:
Who righteous judgment executes
for those oppressed that be;
Who to the hungry gives food,
God sets the prisoners free.
The Lord does give the blind their sight,
the bowel down does raise:
The Lord does dearly love all those
that walk in upright ways.
The strangers shield, the widows stay*
the orphans help is he:
But yet by him the wickeds way
turned upside-down shall be.
The Lord shall reign for evermore,
thy God, O Zion, He
Reigns to all generations.
Praise to the Lord give ye.
PSALM. CXLVII.
PRaise ye the Lord: for it is good
praise to our God to sing:
For it is pleasant, and to praise
it is a comely thing.
God does build up Jerusalem:
and He it is alone
That the dispersed of Israel
does gather into one.
Those, that are broken in their hearts,
and grieved in their minds,
He heals, and their painful wounds
he tenderly up binds.
He counts the number of the stars,
he names them every one.
Great is our Lord, and of great power:
his wisdom search can none.
The Lord lifts up the meek, and casts
the wicked to the ground.
Sing to the Lord, and give him thanks,
on harp his praises sound:
Who covers the heaven with clouds,
who for the earth below
Prepares rain, who makes grass
upon the mountains grow.
He gives the beast his food he feeds
the ravens young, that cry.
His pleasure not in horses strength,
nor in man's legs does ly:
But in all those, that do him fear,
the Lord does pleasure take,
In those that to his mercy do
by hope themselves betake.
The Lord praise, O Jerusalem;
Zion, thy God confess:
For thy gates bars he makes strong,
thy sons in thee does bless.
He in thy borders makes peace:
with fine wheat fills thee.
He sends forth his command on earth,
his word runs speedily.
Hoar frost, like ashes, scatters he:
like wool he snow does give:
Like morsels casts forth his ye;
who in its cold can live?
He sends forth his mighty word,
and melts them again:
His winds he makes to blow, and then
the waters flow amain.
The doctrine of his holy word
to Jacob he does show;
His statutes and his judgments He
gives Israel to know.
To any nation never He
such favor did afford:
For they his judgments have not known.
O do ye praise the Lord.
PSALM. CXLVIII.
PRaise God. From heavens praise the Lord,
in heights praise to Him be.
All ye his Angels praise ye Him,
his hosts all praise Him ye.
O praise ye Him both Sun and Moon,
praise Him all stars of light.
Ye heavens of heavens Him praise, and floods
above the heavens height.
Let all the creatures praise the Name
of our Almighty Lord:
For he commanded, and they were
created by his word.
He also, for all times to come,
has them established sure:
He has appointed them a Law,
which ever shall endure.
Praise ye JEHOVAH from the earth,
dragons, and every deep:
Fire, hail, snow, vapor, stormy wind,
his word that fully keep.
All hills and mountains, fruitful trees,
and all ye cedars hy.
Beasts, and all cattle creeping things,
and all ye birds that fly.
Kings of the earth, all Nations,
Princes, earths Judges all.
Both young men, yea, and maidens too,
old men, and children small.
Let them Gods Name praise: for his Name
alone is excellent:
His glory reaches far above
the earth, and firmament.
His peoples horn, The praise of all
his saints exalts He
Even Isreal's seed, a people near
to Him. The Lord praise ye.
Another of the same.
THe Lord of heaven confess,
On high his glories raise.
Him let all Angels bless,
Him all his armies praise.
Him glorify
Sun, Moon, and Stars:
Ye higher Spheres,
And cloudie sky.
From God your beings are,
Him therefore famous make:
You all created were,
When he the word but spoke.
And from that place,
Where sixth you be
By his decree,
You cannot pass.
Praise God from earth below,
Ye dragons, and ye deeps:
Fire, hail, clouds, wind and snow,
Whom in command He keeps.
Praise ye his Name
Hills great and small,
Trees low and tall:
Beasts wild and tame.
All things that creep or fly:
Ye Kings, ye vulgar throng,
All Princes mean or hie.
Both men and virgins young,
Even young and old,
Exalt his Name,
For much his fame
Should be extold.
O let Gods Name be praised
Above both earth and sky:
For He his saints has raised,
And set their horn on hy;
Even those that be
Of Isreal's race
Near to his grace.
The Lord praise ye.
PSALM. CXLIX.
PRaise ye the Lord: unto Him sing
a new song, and his praise
In the assembly of his saints
in sweet Psalms do ye raise.
Let Israel in his Maker joy,
and to Him praises sing:
Let all, that Zions children are,
be joyful in their King.
O let them unto his great Name
give praises in the dance:
Let them with timbrel and with harp
in songs his praise advance.
For God does pleasure take in those
that his own people be:
And He with his salvation
the meek will beautify.
And in his glory excellent
let all his saints rejoice:
Let them to him upon their beds
aloud lift up their voice.
Let in their mouth aloft be raised
the high praise of the Lord,
And let them have in their right hand
a sharp two-edged sword:
To execute the vengeance due
upon the heathen all,
And make deserved punishment
upon the people fall.
And even with chains as prisoners, bind
their Kings that them command,
Yea, and with iron fetters strong
the nobles of their land.
On them the judgment to perform
found written in his word:
This honor is to all his saints.
O do ye praise the Lord.
PSALM. CL.
PRaise ye the Lord: Gods praise, within
his Sanctuary raise:
And to Him in the firmament
of his power give ye praise.
Because of all his mighty acts
with praise Him magnify:
O praise Him, as he does excel
in glorious Majesty.
Praise Him with Trumpets sound, his praise
with Psaltery advance:
With Timbrel, Harp, string'd instruments,
and Organs, in the dance.
Praise Him on Cymbals loud, Him praise
on Cymbals sounding hie.
Let each thing breathing praise the Lord.
Praise to the Lord give ye.
