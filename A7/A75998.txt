AN ALARM TO THE HEADQUARTERS.
FRIENDS,
you of the Cabinet Counsel, we wish you all Jewels to your Country, that
when the work is done, that the Comonalty, ^he Key of the Kingdom have looked
at your hands, they may lock you into their own bosoms and affections; where
you may be safe, where you may be indempnified without the concurrence of any,
against all, or any that shall demand of you what you have done. But we pray
God you do not prove thorns in the sides, and blocks in the way of those that
have and shall declare and stand up to their first solemn engagements, never
to lay down the sword, till they have thrown down to the ground, all
oppositions and tyrannies whatsoever, and in whomsoever they find them. When
we consider how highly and hotly you have contended with that Indian Diety,
the King (whom you yet own) what affronts, oppositions by Pen and Sword have
been made against him, what running? What hunting after him? What means have
been used, and after what a manner, to bring him on his knees (notwithstanding
you laid the fault on his evil Counselors) and to give him that fatal blow,
^o cut off his force, power, and domineering greatensse over us, that would be
free Commoners of England; whereby you might acquiesse, and cry, victory,
victory: And we had thought to have the sound thereof run through our
streets, and into our houses; but behold the face of War! we hear the noise
thereof, and shall truly feel the s^art thereof, except ye before hand take
this Alarm, and stand to your guard, see Sentinels in every quarter of your
Army, and of the whole Kingdom, and go out and meet it in the very face, for
it comes upon you unawares, and sweeps you away both root and branch. We had
once thought that he that was feign to flee for his guilty conscience, as being
a fraid of what his whole 16. years reign of cruelty and tyranny would produce
upon him if he did not betake himself first to maintain (Vi et Armis) by force
and power, what he had unjusty, ^llegally and tyrannically manopolized (from
the people) into his own most cruel and bloody hands; which he thought to have
kept, no^ only by right of succession; which is as much as to say, by right of
conquest, or by right of donation; which is as much as to call us fools, and
slaves, to give away our birthrights and inheritance, into the hands of him
that shall use it against us: but also to settle it upon himself and his
posterity, by Charter and Act of his own (if that would serve) such was his
confidence in us, King-ridden and Priest ridden fools; we say, we had thought
that the whole sixteen years Reign, was declared by the Parliament, to be one
continued act of cruel oppression and tyranny; and thereupon was by their
Declarations, engagements and promise^, to aid, assist, help and stick close
to, to live and dye together with the Commons of England, who first called them
forth, and drew us out both in person and estates, lives and fortunes, to free
our selves, not only from his said cruelty, oppression and tyranny, but also
from his insolent insulting Title over us, or any thing enjoyed by us and
belonging to us; and therefore we were invited, and called forth to use all
means possible, not (verbis byss^is) in silken words to court him, but by soul
means, that is, by means of the Sword, and force of Arms to bring him down,
and proc^^^me him CHARLES no King, neither by the grace, or any concurrence of
God, or the election of us free Commoners; defenders of his ins^lting, Title of
usurping conquest over us, by tyranny and blood: An enemy to the faith, to good
men, and to goodness itself etc.

We had thought that we should not need this deal of do, this striving
contending; and sending again and again to our conquered enemy. We did not
expect that we should have been beholding to him, when once we had brought
him on his knees. To send propositions, to pass an act for our Indemnity, and
I know not what: Is this according to the law of Arms? According to the law of
conquest? Is this the liberty of the Commons? We pray next send a Proposition,
for him to pass for our Arrears, and next for out ears, to keep them on our
heads, if that be the worst, declare, if he be not yet conquered but still must
usurp that insolent Right and title, to the power of a negative Voice: Why do
we thus sit picking of strawes? How dare we then to send Propositions, or
contend with him, for ungranted, unlicensed privileges; ay but he is in
durance, truly so much the worse: Do ye not know what word he sent you from
Holdenby? Is he in durance, and not conquered? Or if conquered, and yet must
r^taine that power of a negative voice: This is childrens play! This is fine
sport indeed: If you had at first intended this, you or the Parliament, you
might have told us so; you might have put it in one of your mellifluous
Declarations, whereby ye drew us Commoners forth, and said thus much; Sirs,
you see what the King is, what he intends, no good to us, but blood and misery;
what he has been from his first years reign to this time: you see now that
thereupon, he being fearful that he shall be called to an account, i^ gone
away; raised war against us, to the utter ruin of us, our families and
posterities after u* If we do not make timely resistance, (...) stand up ^n our
own defense, and seek by all means to quell, abate, bring down, and utterly
exticipate his power and malice, for if we do not he will curb us to some
purpose: handle us without mittinds; demand any of our persons when he please,
and for what he please; violently wrest a way our rights and estate^, and do
w^^t seems best in his own eyes, and according to hi^ own malicious humor
and passion; therefore look to your selves every one of you, and betake you
not only to resist, but cut off his power, force and greatness, and when you
have conquered him, and subdued all your enemies, yet you must retain his in
solent hethenish laws, usages and customs, that he has violently introduced
upon us (which if we do, he may undeniably and unquestionably, from those his
own Normand laws; sue and recover what he had (though) forfited and lost) yet
notwithstanding all this we say and declare, that you must have an act of
Indemnity from him, and must come cap in hand, and on your knees, to as^ him
forgiveness, and pray him to pass an act thereto; do you think such a
Declaration as this would not have relisht and taken well with the People? I
warrant you it would to some purpose, taken away their ^ffections and stomocks
to fight with him, who though conquered, yet must ask him forgiveness; you
should have gone hoop for Soldiers for us, and for many others too, that now
have done the work, yet have a new one now to begin; and when it will be at an
end, the wifest know not; except ye juggle together with the King; you and the
Parliament make a compact, to send the Propositions, that will easily down,
when he has a hood for his swelling stomach and malice, you may be sure they
will easily take, when he sees their is no other help for him; but we believe
they will prove broken Reeds, run into the side of those that lean thereon.

Gentlemen, and dear friends, whom we prize as the apple of our eye, who have
preserved us from the raging insolent swelling waves of a prerogative negative
voice, by the power of which, we and our estates might have gone to stake, if
you had not stood in the way, to curb, cut off, and throw it down to the ground.

Concious, and confident we are of your integrity, uprightness and valor,
but let us tell you that the standers by may often times, perceive more then
the gamsters, not but that we honor your wisdoms and watchfulness for our
good: but surely all is not at it should be; some viser then some; some more
vigerous then some; as some of you to your everlasting honor be it spoken,
have witnessed of those men who now appear, and stand up for common rights and
freedom, in the Remonstrance of the CA^E OF THE ARMY, truly stated by the
Agents of sive Regiments; but let not your joining with them, he a hinderance
to their proceedings; do not go about to undermine or abstruct the work that
is begun; rouse up your spirits, and do not give your selves u^ nor the
Kingdom, the rights and liber^ie^ thereof, unto the sweeping power of a
negative voice, to deny the passing an act for our good: If this most stand,
and ye yield up this, yeil up all; make us free now for ever, or absolute
slaves, villens and vassals.

What will you ma^^ your selves to be? Or what will your actions in contesting
with such a Prince of your own, prove you to be, but, Rebels and Traitors,
that have forfeted your lives and estates? What will this Army be what will the
Parliament be, but a rebellious Army, a rebellious and traiterous Parliament,
and accordingly such shall be their reward? Or do you intend to make your
peace with him whom ye have overcome and brought in subjection, by making our
liberties and privileges to be of the Court fashion, and to have the royal
stamp? And that we shall give up and resign the whole ware house of our
liberties, with all the locks and keys, into the power of a negative voice;
what do ye mean else by this your delatory and slow proceedings? What one
good deed have you done, since your march through the City of London? Show us
if you can; the people cry none, now you have removed those that were in your
way, and clockt near the City? You would make us believe the work is done;
and as a fore you went a King catching, now ye will go a King courting; is
this fair play? This must not be, you will ruin us, your selves and families
and the whole Kingdom: Do but you your duty, remove all oppressions, ease the
Country, down with all monopolies, and tyrannous oppressions; draw up a
Declaration fully to the People, and Remonstrate that this ye will do for
them, this ye will have, this ye have fought for, this you will maintain,
live and dye, for resolvedly: we will warrant you hobnailes and clouted shoes
will give you hearty thanks and help and assist you: You need not fear them,
ease them of their oppressions, pity their cries, redress their grievances,
and the work is done for them; for what say people, do something or nothing;
and if ye will not do it, tell the people so, if ye be faint-hearted after
all your worthy, and honorable courage and valor for your Country, tell the
people so; if it be so, give way, let others come in, whose firm resolutions
will stand, to engage for common right and freedom, for liberty and for
justice unto blood, do not therefore hinder others, those that now appear,
and those who shall join with them, but suffer us to free our selves, and the
whole commonalty of the Kingdom, from such an intolerable burden and slavery;
to shake and tumble down that mountain of dishonor and oppression, that this
Kingdom for so long time has groaned under; which the flattery of succeeding
times, and the servile slavishnesse of our times Have attributed to those grand
usurpers, our Kings, and their domineering progenitors or successors: as
though the Right, Title and power over us free Commoners, did run along in the
veins, in the loyne, and in the blood, of our insolent usurpers and
taskmasters: Is this liberty? nothing more insufferable to free Denizons, and
to such as would be accounted other then the progeny of Cham: Therefore we
say, if you do not wholly free us from, and take him off from this his insolent
domination, and usurpation, and degrade him and his posterity, of that
pretended usurping name, Right, power and Title, that he insultingly lays
claim to, and that he has so many years together truly executed; you shall
find and feel, he will shake it as a Rod over your heads one day; he will cry
quit with you, and recover damages of you to some purpose: Therefore we
profess seriously from our hearts; we cannot own you, nor your proceedings,
nor should never have assisted you with so vast an expense of our treasure and
blood, if you were resolved to keep up this Dagon amongst us and over us: For
how can we cordially receive or embrace him, or any of his posterity, that
shall lay claim to us after such a way and manner of usurpation, and
domineering? How can we love or fight for those laws, which are imprisoned in
the barbarous language of our enemies, and are ours only by our enemies
introduction, and are our disgrace instead of honor, tokens and badges of
servile slavery and subjectednesse to our exatick, exorbitant prerogative Lords
and Taskmasters, and as little heart have we also to pray or wish for the
safety and preservation of others, more sound and wholesome, more reasonable,
suitable, and consonant to the commonalty of England, until that grand, and yet
neglected grievance and oppression of Normand, prerogative negative Voice, of
our usurping Lord, be removed and wholly taken away; and what if it be pleased
that power is alone residing in him to pass or not pass, to consent: or not
consent, to the good things agreed on by the Commons, and that it is inherent
in him, by virtue of succession (that is, by a pretended right of conquest over
us) for so argues the negative voice; and all are Kings since the death of that
perjured bastard, Duke William of Normand: r^^kon the time of their reign, not
from the time of their coronation, but death of their predecessors, and the
prerogative royal Title, is attended with a POST CONQUESTUM, as if dishonor,
mischief, oppression and slavery, were to be invincibly entailed upon us and
our posterityes, by a law, even by this law of their own making, and forcing it
upon us: Yet let me tell you, his domination over us, is not such, as against
the right and equity whereof there is no pleading, yea, but there is much
pleading; for first, consider, (Vinci humanum est) no people but may be
overcome, that may be born withal but (sub virtoria aquiessere, to lie
snoaring in a captive and servile condition, as though we were perpetual
slaves, eare-board slaves: Now we have after so vast an expense of blood and
treasure regained our liberties, from of our his cruel and bloodthirsty
cluthes, now we have conquered him; subdued all the visible enemies in the
Kingdom, and reduce^ that power to it is proper center that at first was
originally, naturally and legally inherent and residing in us the free
Commoners of this Nation, and yet not withstanding we must still keep up the
usurper, and his usurpers power and greatness over us, and must be beholding to
his negative Voice, pray beseech and obsecrate for it is concurrence in an act
of Indemnity, which is as much as to cry PECCAUI, and to come on your knees to
him so conquered, and ask him forgiveness, that he may grant and give you a
pardone for what you have done, as though ye could not indemp^ify your selves,
and save your selves harmless, but must be beholding to the conquered, to an
enemy, to one that could eat your flesh; and drink your blood to a usurpor to
indempni^y you, we thank you for nothing; you have brought your hogs to a
sarre market have you not? And if he does pass this Proposition to indempnify
you, and to give free and full power to the representative body of the
Commonalty to make Laws, and repeal Laws, (which he is as willing to part
with, as his eyes; witness his stiff standing out still) We are then much
bound to him, are we not? He does but give us a pig of our own Sow; he gives
us that which we never yet forfited or lost, but has been violently wrested
from us; or if we did, we have since regained it, and therefore are no longer
under the pleasure or displesure of the conquered; and therefore choose him
whether he be willing to part with it yea, or no, we will no longer stand to
his courtesy, we have the best end of the Staff, and he must be forced to
let go, when we knock off his fingers: Therefore declare unto the People,
this you have gained, this you will keep.

Secondly, admit he were a conqueror of us, and that his right and Title was
good by virtue of the Law of conquest, and consequently by the same Law, he had
power in him to overtop all the powers and wills of his Subjects, and to stop
all proceedings and that what he passes in the affirmitive, are but acts of
mere grace and favor, revokable at pleasure, and what he passes in the
negative must stand for a law, yet what is that now to us? We know him not, the
case is altered now, there is now no pleading for that, but you are taken off,
with a VICTUM EST, he is conquered and over come, and so subject unto us; and
therefore our sending Propositions, asking an act of Indemnity, etc. is but
superfluous, more then we need do; and is but an argument of our clemency and
goodness toward him, acts of our mere grace and favor: we had almost said,
an argument of our willing mindedness to slavery still, or of our own
selfe-guikinesse: And profess we unto you Gentlemen, that if that Right and
Title (which is but pretended and usurped at the best) must stand and remain in
him or any of his consanguinians* (...) we so again receive him; we look to see
our selves, you, and every honest man in the Kingdom, that is resolved to put
himself in the gap, to stand up for common right and freedom, to fall and
moulder away like dirt; and he is a novice too, if he do not in time cry quit
with you, for what ye have thus many years together done toward him: I Will
warrant you, he will think upon all, your carriages toward him, and bring you
in such a bill of Items that shall break your backs, and yet no^e of you be
sensible of it, or know by whom it is done, but as you may ghuesse: and let us
deal truly with you, what can ye expect less? Or how can ye gain say or
contradict it, or in the least know how to help it? Or if you do go about to
free your selves and the Nation, as you have already pretendedly done, what
will you prove your selves to be, but Rebels and Traitors? And besides what
will all your Propositions, and his passing of them, avail you, if that
insolent, insulting, usurping Title and power that is claimed must stand? What
good will his act of oblivion? Your act of Indemnity do you? What, send
propositions to a conqueror, who dares do it? What, to be your own carvers
and choosers, and hourly lie at the mercy of your enemy and conqueror that has
the prerogative power of a negative voice? Monstrum horrendum. No, no, he may
make you smart for this your boldness and presumption; be content, you are
vassels, villen^, slaves, ^ar^bor'd slaves, incapable of enjoying any thing
that is properly your own, in as much as it is at the dispose of your
prerogative Task-master; incapable of enjoying freehold land, though you
purchase never so much, it belongs to your absolute Lord, and conqueror, and
his prerogative Creatures. Witness, the transplantation of colonies in other
Countries.

If this usurping power of a negative voice must yet stand (notwithstanding the
incapability thereof as ^eing conquered) what have we^ fought for ^ll this
while, and so hotly contested with him, If we must still stand to his pleasure
or displeasure, and stand or fall to his mercy, and act of grace, in passing in
the aff^rmitive, or denying in the negative, by this his tyrannical prerogaive
voice? Consider into what a predicament, and miserable condition we have cast
our selves; such as makes us incapable of acquiring, demanding, or asking any
thing at his hands tending to our peace, welfare, liberties and freedoms,
and for (...) dis-inabling us to stan^ in our own defense, to contest with him,
either by word (...) sword, for any justice or freedom, or any thing else
whatsoever, though in nearest relations to us, for as much as we contend with
him, and so have, done all this while, for un-granted privileges; things that
we have no right to, either to sue for, ask or demand, seeing that his
negative voice must stand, by virtue of that insolent usurping right and Title,
that he pretends to us and over us, and we lie at his mercy and favor,
insomuch as but for the mere and only asking or begging of a common boon,
tending to the Kingdom, to our selves, or families, it may pass in the
negative, and so we shall be checked, controuled affronted, abused, fined;
imprisoned, and what not! and at last, have no remedy for this, or any where to
go for help; seeing we ask we know not what, things that belong not unto us;
for our selves and all that belong unto us are at the disposing of him, and his
creatures; and if he be graciously pleased so far to condescend and demean
himself, as to extend his grace and favor toward us, in passing any
proposition for our good, it is more then he needs do, or you can acquire, and
moreover this, it is revocable at his pleasure, and but for durance, or
gracious permittance for season, for so are all acts of grace that proceed from
the prerogative power of a negative voice; which things should have been
abundantly proved: but that this was intended chiefly for an Allarum, to
awaken the drowsy spirits of you, and those that ly^ snoaring under the
overtoping, insolent, swelling, and overgrown usurping power of a negative
Voice, and therefore in a word, never talk of getting honor in regaining your
and our Countries libertyes, except ye first unconquer your selves. a word to
the intelligent man is sufficient.
