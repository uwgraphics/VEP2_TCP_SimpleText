A DISCOURSE, or PARLEY, continued betwixt Partricius and Peregrine (upon their
landing in France) touching the civil Wars of England and Ireland.
Peregrine. GEntle Sir, you are happily arrived on this shore; we are now upon
firm ground, upon the fair Continent of France: we are not circumscribed or
coopt up within the narrow bounds of a rheumatick Island; we have all Europe
before us. Truly I am not a little glad to have shaken hands with that
tumbling Element the Sea; And for England, I never intend to see her again,
unless it be in a Map; nay, In statu quo nunc, while this Faction reigns, had
I left one eye behind me, I should hardly return thither to fetch it;
therefore if I be missing at any time, never look for me there. There is an
old Proverb, From a black German, a white Italian, a red Frenchman, I may add
one member more, and, from a Round-headed Englishman, The Lord deliver us.


Partricius. I have often crossed these Seas, and I found my self always
pitifully sick; I did ever and anon tell what Wood the Ship was made of; but
in this passage I did not feel the least motion or distemper in my humors:
for, indeed I had no time to think on sickness, I was so wholly taken up, and
transported with such a pleasing conceit, to have left yonder miserable Island.


Pereg. Miserable Island indeed; for I think there was never such a tyranny
exercised in any Christian Country under Heaven; a tyranny that extends not
only to the body, but the brain also; not only to men's fortunes and estates,
but it reaches to their very souls and consciences, by violented new coercive
Oaths and Protestations, composed by Laymen, inconsistent with the liberty of
Christians. Never was there a Nation carried away by such a strong spirit of
delusion; never was there a poor people so purblinded and Puppified, if I may
say so, as I find them to be; so that I am at a stand with my self, whether I
shall pity them more, or laugh at them. They not only kiss the stone that
hurts them, but the hands of them that hurl it; they are come to that passive
stupidity, that they adore their very persecutors, who from polling fall now a
shaving them, and will flay them at last, if they continue this popular reign.
I cannot compare England, as the case stands with her, more properly, then to a
poor beast, sick of the staggers, who cannot be cured without an incision.
The Astronomers, I remember, affirm that the Moon (which predominates over
all humid bodies) has a more powerful influence over your British Seas then
any other; so that according to the observation of some Navigators, they swell
at a spring tide in some places, above threescore cubits high: I am of opinion,
that that inconstant humorous Planet, has also an extraordinany dominion over
the brains of the Inhabitants; for when they attempt any Innovation (whereunto
all Insulary people are more subject then other Citizens of the world which are
fixed upon the Continent) they swell higher, their fancies work stronglier,
and so commit stranger extravagancies then any other: witness these monstrous
barbarismes and violences, which have been, and are daily offered to Religion
and Justice, (the two grand supporters of all States) yea, to humane Reason it
self, since the beginning of these tumults.

And now, noble Sir, give me leave to render you my humble thanks for that true
and solid information you pleased to give me in London of these commotions.

During my short sojourne there, I lighted on diverse odd Pamphlets upon the
Seamstresses stalls, whom I wondered to see selling Paper sheets in lieu of
Holland: one the one side I found the most impudent untruths (vouched by
public authority) the basest scurrillities, and poorest gingles of wit, that
ever I read in my life; on the other side I met with many pieces that had good
stuff in them, but gave me not (being a stranger) a full satisfaction, they
looked no further then the beginning of this Parliament, and the particular
emergences thereof: But you have, by your methodicall relation, so perfectly
instructed and rectified my understanding, by bringing me to the very source
of these distempers, and led me all along the side of the current by so
straight a line, that I believe, whosoever will venture upon the most intricate
task of penning the story of these vertiginous times, will find himself not a
little beholden to that piece, which, in deed may be termed a short Chronicle
rather then a Relation. We are come now under another clime, and here we may
mingle words, and vent our conceptions more securely, it being, as matters
stand, in your Country, more safe to speak under the Lilly then the Rose; we
may here take in, and put out freer air; I mean, we may discourse with more
liberty: for, words are naught else but air articulated, and coagulated, as it
were, into letters and syllables.


Patr. Sir, I deserve not these high expressions of your favorable censure
touching that poor piece; but this I will be bold to say; That whosoever does
read it impartially, will discover in the Author the Genius of an honest
Patriot, and a Gentleman. And now me thinks I look on you unfortunate Island,
as if one did look upon a Ship tossed up and down in distress of wind and
weather, by a furious tempest, which the more she tugs and wrastles with the
foamie waves of the angry Ocean, the more the fury of the storm increases,
and puts her in danger of shipwreck; and you must needs think, Sir, it would
move compassion in any heart, to behold a poor Ship in such a desperate case,
specially when all his kindred, friends and fortunes; yea, his Religion, the
most precious Treasure of all, are aboard of her, and upon point of sincking.
Alas I can contribute nothing now to my poor country but my prayers and
tears, that it would please God to allay this tempest, and cast over board
those that are the true causers of it, and bring the people to the right use of
Reason again. It was well observed by you, Sir, That there is a National
kind of indisposition, and obliquity of mind that rages now amongst our
people, and I fear it will be long ere they return to their old English
temper, to that rare loyalty and love which they were used to show to their
Sovereign: for all the Principles of Monarchy are quite lost amongst us,
those ancient and sacred flowers of the English Diadem are trampled under foot;
nay, matters are come to that horrid confusion, that not only the Prerogative
of the Crown, but the foundamentall Privilege of the freeborn subject is
utterly overthrown, by those whose Predecessors were used to be the main
supporters of it. so that our King is necessitated to put himself in Arms for
the preservation not only of his own Regal rights, but of Magna Charta it
self, which was never so invaded and violated in any age, by such causlesse
tyrannical imprisonments, by such unexampled destructive taxes; by stopping
the ordinary processes in Law, and awing all the Courts of Justice, by unheard
of forced oaths and Associations, and a thousand other acts, which neither
president, Book case or Statute can warrant, whereof, if the King had done but
the twentieth part, he had been cried up to be the greatest Tyrant that ever
was.


Pereg. Sir, I am an Alien, and so can speak with more freedom of your
Country. The short time that I did eat my bread there, I felt the pulse of
the people with as much judgment as I could; and I find, that this very word
Parliament is become a kind of Idol amongst them, they do, as it were pin
their salvation upon it; it is held blasphemy to speak against it. The old
English Maxim was: The King can do no wrong; another Nominative case is now
stepped in; That the Parliament can do no wrong, nor the King receive any: And
whereas there was used to be but one Defender of the Faith, there are now
started up amongst you, I cannot tell how many hundreds of them. And as in the
sacred profession of Priesthood we hold, or at leastwise should hold, That
after the Imposition of hands, the Minister is inspired with the Holy Ghost in
an extraordinary manner for the enabling of him to exercise that Divine
Function: so the English are grown to such a fond conceit of their Parliament
members, that as soon as any is chosen by the confused cry of the Common
people to sit within the walls of that House, an inerring spirit, a spirit of
infallibility presently enters into him (so that he is thereby become like
the Pope, a Canon animatus) though some of them may happily be such flat and
simple animals, that they are as fit to be Counselors there, as Caligula's
Horse was to be Consul, as the Historian tells us.


Patr. Touching Parliament, there breaths not a Subject under Englands Crown,
who has a higher esteem of it then I, it makes that dainty mixture in our
government of Monarchy, Optimacie and Democracy, betwixt whom, though there be
a kind of co-ordination of power during the sitting of Parliament, yet the two
last, which are composed of Peers and People, have no power, but what is
derived from the first, which may be called the soul that animates them, and by
whose authority they meet, consult and depart: They come there to propose, not
to impose Laws; they come not to make Laws by the sword; they must not be
like Draco's Laws, written in blood. Their King calls them thither to be his
Counselors, not Controllers; and the Office of Counsel is to advise, not to
enforce; they come thither to entreat, not to treat with their Liege Lord; they
come to throw their Petitions at his feet, that so they may find a way to his
heart.

It Is true, I have read of high things that our Parliaments have done, but
'twas either during the nonage and minority of our Kings, when they were under
protectorship, or when they were absent in a foreign war, or in time of
confusion, when there were competitors of the blood-royall for the Crown, and
when the number of both Houses was complete and individed; but I never read of
any Parliament that did arrogate to it self such a power Paramount, such a
Superlative superintendence, as to check the Prerogative of their Sovereign,
to question his negative voice, to pass things, not only without, but
expressly against his advice and royal command: I never heard of Parliament,
that would have their King, being come to the meridian of his age, to transmit
his intellectualls, and whole faculty of reason to them. I find some
Parliaments have been so modest and moderate (And moderation is the Rudder that
should steer the course of all great Counsels) that they have declined the
agitation and cognizance of some state affairs, humbly transferring them to
their Sovereign and his privy Counsel: a Parliament man then, held it to be
the adaequate object of his duty, to study the welfare, to redress the
grievances, and supply the defects of that place for which he served; the
Burgeois of Linne studied to find out something that might advance the trade of
Fishing; he of Norwich, what might advantage the making of Stuff; he of Rye,
what might preserve their Harbor from being choked up with Sand; he of
Taveston, what might further the Manufacture of Kerseyes, and they thought to
have complied with the Obligation, and discharged the consciences of honest
Patriots, without soaring above their reach, and roving at random to treat of
universals, to bring Religion to their bar, to pry into the Arcana Imperii,
the cognizance of the one belonging to the King, and his interne Counsel of
State: the other to Divines, who, according to the Etymology of the word, use
to be still conversant in the exercise and speculation of holy and heavenly
things.


Pereg. I am clearly of your opinion in these two particulars; for, secrecy
being the soul of policy, matters of State should be communicated but to few;
and touching Religion, I cannot see how it may quadrat with the calling, and be
homogeneous to the profession of Laymen, to determine matters of Divinity, who,
out of their incapacity and unaptnesse to the work, being not pares negotio;
and being carried away by a wild kind of Conscience without Science, like a
Ship without a Helm, fall upon dangerous quicksands; so that whilst they
labor to mend her, they mar her, whilst they think to settle her, they
confound her, whilst they plot to prevent the growth of Popery, they pauce
the way to bring it in, by conniving at, and countenancing those monstrous
Schisms, I observed to have crept into your Chruch since the reign of this
Parliament: so that one may justly say, These your Reformers are but the
executioners of the old project of the Jesuits, the main part whereof was, and
is still, to hurl the ball of discord, and hatch new opinions still 'twixt the
Protestants, to make fractions and scissures between them, and so render their
Religion more despicable and ridiculous.

But me thinks, matters are come to a strange pass with you in England, that
the Judges cannot be trusted with the Law, nor the Prelates with the Gospel;
whereas from all times, out of their long experience and years, these two
degrees were of men used to be reverenced for the chief Ttruch-men, and
unquestionable Expositors of both, which another power seems now to arrogate
to it self, as the inerring Oracle of both: but I pray God that these grand
Refiners of Religion, prove not Quacksalvers at last; that these upstart
Politicians prove not Impostors: for I have heard of some things they have
done, that if Machiavell himself were alive, he would be reputed a Saint in
comparison of them. The Roman ten, and Athenian thirty, were Babies to these;
nay, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Bloet-Rade (that Council of blood) which
the Duke of Alva erected in Flanders, when he swore, That he would drown the
Hollanders in their Butter-tubs, was nothing to this; when I consider the
prodigious power they have assumed to themselves, and do daily exercise over
the bodies, the estates and souls of men.

In your former Discourse you told me, that amongst multitudes of other
mischiefs, which this new Faction has wrought, they have put division twixt
all sorts and sexes, twixt all conditions, both of men and women; one thing
more I may say they have done in this kind: for, they have labored to put
division between the Persons of the holy Trinity, by making the first Person to
be offended at that voluntary genuflexion and reverence which has been from
all times practiced in the Christian Church to the name of the second Person;
so that Iesu-warship, as I have read in some of your profane Pamphlets, is
grown now to be a word of reproach amongst you.

But to the point; there is one thing I can never cease to wonder at: that
whereras at the beginning of this Parliament, there were as able and
experienced, as stout and well spoken Gentlemen, as any in the whole Kingdom,
that sat in the House, and made the far major part, I wonder I say, that they
would suffer this giddy-headed Faction to carry all before them in that violent
manner, that they did not crush this Cocatrice in the shell.


Patr. First, Sir, you know there is nothing so agreeable to the nature of man,
as noveltie; and in the conduct of humane affairs, it is always seen, that
when any new design or faction is afoot, the Projectors are commonly more
pragmaticall and sedulous upon the work; they lie centinell to watch all
advantages, the Sand of their brains is always running this has caused, this
upstart Faction, to stick still close together, and continue marvellously
constant to their ends; they have been used to tire and out-fast, to weary and
out-watch the moderate and well-minded Gentlemen; sometimes till after
midnight, by clancular and nocturnall sittings; so that as his Majesty says
in one of his Declarations, most of their Votes may be said to be naught else,
but Verdicts of a starved Jury.

Another reason is, That they countenanced the flocking together of the
promiscuous rabble from London, notwithstanding the two several motions the
Lords made unto them, that they might be suppressed by Parliamentary Order:
This rioous crew awed the wonted freedom of speech in both Houses, cried up
the names, and confronted many of their Members: yet these new Politicians not
only connived at them, but called them their friends; and so they might well
enough, or rather their Champions; for they had ordered the matter so, that
they were sure to have them ready at their devotion, at the heaving of a
finger: and from this tumultuous mongrell crew, they derived their first
encouragements to do such high prodigious insolences they have committed
since. Add hereunto, that they complied exceedingly besides with the Common
Council of the City, they used to attend them early and late, and knock heads
together; and if any new thing was to pass in the House, they would first wait
on them, to know their pleasure, and afterward it should be propunded and put
to Vote in the House: And how derogatory it is to the high Law-making council,
to make their chiefest Members wait from time to time on the Magistrates of the
City, who in former times were used to attend them upon all occasions in
Westminster, I am ashamed to think on; nor am I less ashamed to remember
those base Artifices and indirect courses that were practiced at the election
of this pretended Major; here they tacked about to a second choice after the
the first was legally made, and how the Common Council was packed up of the
arrandest Schismatics up and down the City. And to that mutinous
wealth-swolne City, and the said unbridled pack of Oppidans (seconded
afterward by the Country clownes) who offered such outrages to Gods House,
the Kings house, and the Parliament house, may be ascribed all our miseries,
and the miscarriage of things: for they caused his Majesty to forsake his own
standing palace, to absent himself from his Parliament, and make that unusual
progress up and down his Kingdom ever since, it put all Counsel at a stand,
and in a confusion: But because the business may take better impression in you
for the further illustration of it, I will relate unto you an old Egyptian
Fable which comes pat to this purpose:

Upon a time, the Stars complained to Apollo, that he displayed his beams
too much upon some malignant Planets; That the Moon had too great a share of
his influence, and that he was carried away too much by her motion: They
complained also, that the constellation of Libra (which holds the balance of
Justice) had but a dim light, and that the Astrean Court was grown altogether
destructive with diverse other grievances. Apollo hereupon, commanded Mercury to
summon a general Synod, where some out of every Asterisme throughout the whole
Firmament were to meet; Apollo told them, I am placed here by the finger of the
Almighty, to be Monarch of the Sky, to be the measurer of Time, and I go upon
his errand round about the world every four and twenty hours: I am also the
Fountain of heat and light, which, though I use to dispense and difofuse in
equal proportions throughout the whole universe; yet I make difference twixt
objects, a Castle has more of my light then a Cottage, and the Cedar has more
of me then the Shrub: But touching the Moon, (the second great Luminary) I
would have you know, that she is dearest unto me, therefore let none repine
that I cherish her with my beams, and confer more light on her, then upon any
other. Touching the malignant Planets, or any other Star, of what magnitude
soever, that moves not in a regular motion, or has run any excentrique
exorbitant course, or that would have made me to move out of the Zodiak, I put
them over unto you, that upon due examination, and proof, they may be
unsphear'd, or extinguished. But I would have this done with moderation; I
would have you to k epe as near as you can between the Tropiques and temperate
Zones: I would have things reduced to their true principles, reformed, not
ruined; I would not have the whole government of the Sky overturned for
redress of a few petty abuses; I would have the spirit of malice and lying,
the spirit of partiality and injustice, the spirit of tyranny and rigor, the
base spirit of fear and jealousy to be far from this glorious Synod; I would
have all private interests reflecting upon revenge or profit, to be utterly
banished hence: moreover, I would not have you to make grievances, where no
grievances are, or dangers, where no dangers are, I would have no creation of
dangers; I would have you to husband time as parsimoniously as you can, lest by
keeping too long together, and amusing the world with such tedious hopes of
redress of grievances, you prove your selves the greatest grievance at last,
and so from Stars, become Comets: Lastly, I would have you to be very
cautious how you tamper with my Sovereign power, and chop Logic with me in
that point; you know what became of Him, who once presumed to meddle with my
Chariot: Hereupon the whole host of Heaven being constellated thus into one
great Body, fell to a serious deliberation of things; and Apollo himself
continued his presence, and sat amongst them in his full luster, but in the
mean time, whilst they were in the midst of their consultations, the lesser
sort of the mongrell Stars which make up the Galaxia (the milkie way in
Heaven) gather in a tumultuous disorderly manner about the body of Apollo, and
commit many strange insolences, which caused Apollo (taking young Phosphorus
with him) to retire himself, and to withdraw his light from the Synod: so all
began to be involved in a strange kind of confusion and obscurity; they
groaped in the dark, not knowing which way to move, or what course to take,
all things went Cancerlike, retrograde, because the Sun detained his beams
from them? Such as the Sun is in the Firmament, a Monarch is in his Kingdom:
for, as the Wisest of men says, In the light of the Kings countenance there is
life, and I believe that to be the moral of this Astrean Fable.


Pereg. I thank you a thousand times for this rare high fetched Apologue; there
is nothing illustrates things better, or fasteneth them more firmly in the
mind, and makes the memory of them more pleasing to the fancy, then Apologues,
Emblemes, Allegories and Parables: And now, that you compare a Monarch to the
Sun, I remember to have read in your story, of a complement that Marshall
Byron put upon Q Elizabeth, who, after a splendid audience, where the choycest
Ladies about the town were commanded to wait, when she asked him, how he
liked her Maids, he answered, Mad me, There is no body able to judge of the
light of the Stars whilst the Sun is up. A handsomer complement then that
Lord (whom I will forbear to name) who was sent from his late Majesty to
condole the Archduke Albertus his death, did put upon the late Infanta at
Bruxel, who when the Infania had made an Apology, That she could not
entertain him then, in that high degree that the Ambassador of so great a King
deserved, it being a time of mourning: he answered, Madam, This turns to my
advantage; for it were dangerous to look upon the Sun, unless some cloud
interposed. Your Britannick Sun, though he be now o're-set with these unluckie
clouds, engendered of the vapors of distempered brains, and the rotten hearts
of many of his own meniall servants, who have proved like the sons of
Serviah unto him, ungrateful monsters, yet is he still in his own Orb, and
will, when this foul weather's passed, and the air cleared a little by
thunder, shine more gloriously and powerfully then before, it being a maxim of
State, That Rebellion suppressed, makes a Prince the stronger; And Rebellion
durst never yet look a Prince long in face: for the Majesty of Gods anointed,
uses to dart such refulgent piercing beams, that dazzle the eyes of
disloyalty, and strikes her stark blind at last. And truly, as you say, I am
also clearly of opinion, that these ungrateful Londoners, as they were the
comencers, so have they been the continuers and contrivers of this ugly
Rebellion ever since; They seem to have utterly forgotten who has given them
the sword, and by, and from whom they hold their Charter. Their Corporations
are now grown body politics, and so many petty Republikes amongst them; so
that they begin to smell rank of a Hans-town, Poor simple Annimals, how they
suffer their pockets to be picked, their purses to be cut; how they part with
their vital spirits every week; how desperately they post on to poverty, and
their own ruin, suffering themselves in lieu of Scarlet-gownes, to be
governed by a rude company of Red-coats, who 'twixt plundring, assessements,
and visits, will quickly make an end of them. I fear there is some formidable
judgment of regal revenge hangs over that City; for the anger of a King is
like the roaring of a Lion; and I never read yet of any City that contested
with her Sovereign, but she smarted soundly for it at last. The present case
of London bears a great deal of proportion with that of Monpellier here in
France, in Charles the seventh's time; for when that town had refused the
publishing of many of the Kings Edicts and Declarations, murdered some of his
Ministers and Servants, abused the Church, and committed other high acts of
insolency; the Duke of Berry was sent to reduce the town to obedience, the
Duke pressed them with so hard asiege, that at last 600. of the best Citizens
came forth in procession, bare-headed, and barefooted, with white wands in
their hands, and halters about their necks, to deliver the keys of all the
gates to the Duke, but this would not serve the turn, for two hundred of them
were condemned to the galleys, two hundred of them were hanged, and two hundred
beheaded, the King saying, he offered those as victimes for the lives of his
servants whom they had murdered with the false sword of Justice.

But, Sir, I much marvel how your Church Government, which from all times has
been cried up to be so exact, is so suddenly tumbled into this confusion? how
your Prelates are fallen under so dark a cloud, considering that diverse of
them were renowned through all the Reformed Churches in Christendom for their
rare learning and piety? At the Synod at Dort, you know, some of them
assisted, and no exception at all taken at their degree and dignity; how came
it to pass, that they are now fallen under this Eclypse, as to be so
persecuted, to be pushed out of the House of Peers, and hurried into prison? I
pray you be pleased to tell me.


Patr. Sir, I remember to have read in the Irish Story, That when the Earl of
Kildare, in Henry the eighth's time, was brought before the Lord Deputy for
burning Cassiles Church, he answered, My Lord, I would never have burnt the
Church, unless I had thought the Bishop had been in it; for 'twas not the
Church, but the Bishop I aimed at. One may say so of the Anglican Church at
this present, that these fiery Zelots, these vaporing Sciolists of the times
are so furiously enraged against this holy Primitive order: some out of Envy,
some out of Malice, some out of Ignorance, that one may say, our Church had not
been thus set on fire, unless the Bishops had been in it. I grant there was
never yet any Profession made up of men, but there were some bad; we are not
Angels upon earth; there was a Judas amongst the first dozen of Christians,
though Apostles, and they by our Savior's own election: Amongst our Prelates,
peradventure (for I know of no accusation framed against them yet) some might
be faulty, and wanting moderation, being not contented to walk upon the
battlements of the Church, but they must put themselves upon stilts; but if a
golden chain has happily a copper link, two or three, will you therefore
break and throw away the whole chain. If a few Shooe-makers (I confess the
comparison is too homely, but I had it of a Scots Doctor) sell Calfes skin for
Neats leather, must the Gentle-Craft be therefore utterly extinguished, and
must we go barefoot therefore? Let the persons suffer in the Name of God, and
not the holy Order of Episcopacy. But because you desire to be further informed
of the procedures against Bishops, I will relate unto you another Apologue
which principally glaunceth at this subject:

Upon a time the Birds met in Council, for redress of some extravavagancies
that had flowne into the volatill Empire; Nor was it the first time that Birds
met thus; for the Phrygian Fabler tells us of diverse meetings of theirs: And
after him we read that Apolonius Thyanent, undertook the interpretation of
their language, and to be their Dragoman.

They thus assembled in one great Covie by the call of the Eagle their
unquestioned hereditary King, and by virtue of his royal authority. Complaints
were brought, that diverse Cormorants and Harpies, with other Birds of prey, had
got in amongst them, who did much annoy and invade the public liberty:
sundry other Birds were questioned, which caused some to take a timely flight
into another air.

As they were thus consulting for advancement of the common good, many Rookes,
Horne-Owles and Sea-guls flocked together, Citizens, Seamen.
and fluttered about the place they were assembled in, where they kept a
hideous noise, and committed many outrages, and nothing could satisfy them,
but the Griffons head, Ear. Straff. Crest.
which was therefore chopped off and offered up as a sacrifice to make them leave
their chattering, and appease their fury for the time.

They fell foul afterward upon the Pies, who were used to be much reverenced,
and to sit upon the highest perch in that great Assembly: they called them
Idolatrous and inauspicious Birds, they hated their mixed color, repined at
their long train, they tore their white feathers, and were ready to peck out
their eyes: they did what they could to put them in Owls feathers, to make
them the more hated, and to be star'd and hooted at wheresoever they passed.
The Pies being thus scared, presented a Petition to the royal Eagle, and to
this his great Counsel, that they might be secured to repair safely thither
to sit and consult, according to the ancient Laws of the Volatill Empire
continued so many ages without controllment or question: in which Petition they
inserted a Protest or Caveat, that no public Act pass should in the interim.
This Supplication, both for matter and form, was excepted against, and cried
up to be high Treason, specially that indefinite Protest they had made, that no
Act whatsoever should be of any validity without them, which was alleged to
derogate frrom the High Law-making power of that great Counsel, and tended to
retard and disturb the great affairs which were then in agitation: so the
poor Pies, as if by that Petition they had like the Blackbird voyded Lime to
catch themselves, for Turdus cacat sibi malum, were suddenly hurried away into
a Cage, and after ten long Months canvassing of the point, they were
unpearch'd, and rendered for ever incapable to be members of that Court, they
were struck dumb and voyce-lesse, and suddenly blown up away thence without
any force of powder, as once was plotted against them. But this was done when a
thin number of Birds had kept still together, and stuck close against them, and
after that the Bill concerning them had been once ejected, which they humbly
conceived by the ancient order of that Court could not be readmitted in the
same Session. They Petitioned from the place they were cooped in, that for
heavens sake, for the honor of that noble Counsel, for truth and justice
sake, they being as freeborn Denisons of the air Region, as any other
Volatils whatsoever, their charge might be perfected, that so they might be
brought to a legal trial, and not forced to languish in such captivity. They
pleaded to have done nothing but what they had precedents for: And touching the
Caveat they had inserted, it was a thing usual in every inferior Court of
Judicature, and had they then forborne to have done it, they had berayed their
own nest, and done wrong to their successors. It was affirmed they had been
members of that Body politic, long before those lower pearch'd Birds, who now
would cast them out; and that they had been their best friends to introduce
them to have any thing to do in that general Counsel. they prayed they might
not be so cruelly used, as the Solan-goose, Scot.
and Redshanke had used them, who were not content to braile and clip their
wings only, but to sear them so that they should never grow again; to handle
them so unmercifully, was not the way to make their adversaries Birds of
Paradise: In fine, they advised them to remember what the sick Kite's mother
answered him, when he desired her to pray to the gods for him, How can thou,
said she expect any good from the gods, whose temples thou have so often
violated? At last, upon the importunity and pitifulness of their Petitions,
the accusation of Treason, which kep^ such a noise at first, being declined
against them, they were released in the morning, but cooped up again before
night: and after the revolution of four full Moons, they were restored again
to a conditional liberty, under which they remain till this day.

There wants not some, who affirm, that in this great Counsel of Birds. there
were some Decoyes, (and it is well known where Decoyes were first bred) who
called in, Holland.
not only these mongrell obstreperous Birds from abroad to commit such outrages
as were spoken of before, but drew after them also many of the greatest Birds,
who sat in that Assembly, to follow them whither they listed: Others, who were
of a more generous extraction, disdained to be such Buzzards, as to be carried
away hood-wincked in that manner, to be Birds of their feather. Thus a visible
faction was hatched in this great Counsel; as if the said Decoyes had
disgorged and let fall some grains of Hemlock seeds amongst them: Or, as if
some Spinturnix, that fatal incendiary Bird, or some ill-boding Scrich-Owle,
which as Stories tell us appeared once at Rome, in a famous, though unfortunate
great Council (when there was a schism in the Pope dome) had appeared also
here. There wanted not also amongst them some Amphibious Birds, as the
Barnacle, which is neither Fish nor Foul; and the cunning Batt, who sometimes
professes himself a Bird, sometimes a Mouse, I will not say there were any
Paphlagonian Birds amongst them, who are known to have double hearts: But it is
certain that in this confusion there were some malevolent Birds, and many of
them so young, that they were scarce sledg'd, who like the Waspe in the Fable,
conspired to fire the Eagles nest; and a Waspe may sometimes do mischief to
an Eagle, as a Mouse to an Elephant: Moreover, some of these high brained Birds
flew so high that they seemed to arrogate to themselves, and exercise the
royal power of the Eagle; but let them take heed, we know what became of the
Crow upon the Ram's back, when she thought to imitate the Eagle: And it was
observed, that they were most eager to attempt those high insolencis against
Jove's Bird, who had been stark naked, and as bare as Cootes, unless he had
feathered them; so that the little Ant was more grateful to Esops Bire then
those Birds were to the Eagle, their liege Lord. But the high-borne Bird with
the two golden wings, the noble Faulcons, the Martlets, the Rovans, the Swan,
the Chough, aed all the ancient Birds of the mountains remained faithful and
firm to the Eagle, and scorned to be carried away by such Decoyes; As also the
generous Ostriches, who unless they had had an extraordinary stomach, could
not have digested such iron pills as were ofiered them.

The foresaid destractions continued still, and increased more and more in that
general convention of Birds; therefore the Turle would stay there no longer,
there was so much gaull amongst them: the Pelican flew away, he saw piety so
vilified; the Dove was weary of their company, she found no simplicity and
plain dealing amongst them: And the Kings-Fisher, the Halcyon, (the Emblem of
Pies) quite forsook them, he found so much jarring dissentions and bandings
on all sides; the Swallow also, who had so ancient and honorable a rank
amongst them, got into another air, he foresaw the weather was like to be so
foul: And lastly, Philomela, the Queen of Volatills, who was partner of the
Eagle's nest, abandoned them quite, and put a Sea 'twixt her and them; nay, the
Eagle himself withdrew his royal presence from them; so the Decoyes
aforesaid carried all before them, and compoted themselves by their Orders in
that highth, as if like the Lapwing, every one had a Crown on his head; they
so enchanted in a manner, all the common sort of the Oppidan rural, and
Sea-birds, and infused such a credulity into them, that they believed they had
an inerring spirit, and what came from them, was as true as the Pentuteuch:
Moreover, it was shrewdly suspected, that there was a plot amongst them to let
in the Storke, who is never seen to stay long in any Monarchy.


Pereg. Sir, by this Ornilogicall Apologue, you have not only confirmed, but
also enriched, and much enlarged my understanding in the knowledge of things.
Good Lord, how pitifully were those pore Prelates handled; what a Tartarian
kind of tyranny it was, to drag twice into prison twelve grave reverend
Bishops in that manner, causa adhuc inaudita, and afterward afterward not to
be able to frame as much as an accusation of misdemeanor, against them, much
less of Treason, whereof they were first impeached with such high clamors: But
I conceive it was of purpose, to set them out of the way, that the new Faction
might pass things better amongst the Peers. And it seems they brought their
work about; for whilst nhey were thus reclused and absent, they were thrust
out of doors, and ejected out of their own proper ancient inheritance, as it
were. But would not all this, with those unparalleled Bills of Grace you
mentioned in your first Discourse, which had formerly passed, suffice to beget
a good understanding, and make them confide in their King?


Patr. No, but the passing of these Bills of Grace, were termed Acts of Duty in
his Majesty; they wet so far, that 'twas not sufficient for him to give up his
Tower, his Fleet-Royall, his Magazines, his Port, and Castles and Servants,
but he must deliver up his Sword into their hands, all the Soldiery and
Military forces of the Land; nay, he must give up his very Understanding unto
them; he must resign his own Reason, and with an implicit Faith and blind
Obedience, he must believe, who they did, was to make him glorious; and if at
any time he taxed them, or prescribed ways for them to proceed and expedite
matters, or if he advised them in any thing, they took it in a kind of
indignation, and 'twas presently cried up to be Breach of Privilege.


Pereg. There is no way in my conceit, to make a King more inglorious, both at
home and abroad, then to disarme him; and to take from him the command and
disposing of the Militia throughout his Kingdom, is directly to disarme him,
and wrest the^ Sword out of his hand: and how then can he be termed A Defenders
how cand he defend either himself, or others? it is the only way to expose him
to scorn and derision; truly, as I conceive, it was a thing most unfit for
them to ask, or him to grant: But I pray Sir, be pleased to inform me
further touching this particular.


Patr. Because I find your Genius to be delighted with Apologues, I will go on
to illustrate this point unto you that way, I began with the Heavens, I then
descended to the lower Region of the Air; and now I will bring you to the
Earth.

Upon a time, The Flowers assembled, and met in one general Counsel, by the
authority and summons of the Sovereign Rose, their undoubted natural King,
who had taken the Lilly for his royal spouse. The dew of Heaven fell
plentifully upon this happy conjunction. which made them to Bourgeon, to
propagate any prosper exceedingly, in so much, that the sweet fragrant odor
which they did cast, diffused it self over all the earth. To this meeting came
the Violet, the Gilliflower, Rosemary, the Tulyp, Lavander and Thyme, the
Cinquefoyle (though of an exotique plantation,) had an honorable rank amongst
them; and as some observed, got too much credit with the royal Rose. The
Flowers of the field were admitted also to the great Counsel: the Couslip, the
Honysuckle and Daisie had their Delegates there present, to consult of a
Reformation of certain abuses which had taken rooting in the Commonweals of
Flowers, and being all under the Rose, they had privilege to speak of all
things with freedom; complaints were made, that much Cockle Melampod and
Darnel, with other noxious Herbs and Tares were crept in amongst them; that the
Poppie did pullulat too much with diverse other grievances: The success of this
Senate, this great Bed or Posie of living Flowers, was like to prove very
prosperous, but that the herb Briony, Wormwood, Wolfebane, Rue, and Hemlocke,
(the emblemes of Sedition, Malice, Fear, Anbition and Jealousy) thrust in
amongst them, and much distempered their proceedings: These brought in with
them the Bur, which exceedingly retarded and entangled all businesses; and it
was thought that the Thistle was too meddling amongst them, which made matters
grow to that acrimony and confusion, as if the herb Morsus diaboli had got in
amongst them. Amongst many other good-morrowes, they propounded to the Rose,
that he should part with his prickles, and transmit his strength that way to be
disposed of by them; the Rose liked not this bold request of theirs, though
couched in very smooth language, but answered, I have hitherto condesended to
every thing you have propounded, much more then any of my Predecessors did; but
touching these prickles, which God and nature has given me, and are inherent
in me and my stock from the beginning, though they be but excressencies, yet
you know they fortify and arm me, Armat Spina Rosam, And by them I protect
you and your rights from violence; and what protection I pray can there be
without strength? therefore I will by no means part with them to enfeeble my
regal Power, but will retain them still, and bequeanh them to my Posterity,
which I would be loath to betray in this point; nor do I much value what that
silly infected Animal, the King of Bees tells me sometimes, when humming up
and down my leaves, he would buzze this fond belief into me, that it added
much to his Majesty that nature gives him no sting as all other Bees have,
because he should rely altogether upon the love and loyalty of his subjects.
No, I will take warning by the Eagle, the King of Volatills, and by the Lion,
King of Quadrupedals, who (as the Prince of Moralists report) when by fair
insinuations the one had parted with his tallons, the other with his teeth tnd
engles, wherein their might, and consequently their Majesty consisted, grew
afterward contemptible to all creatures, and qute lost that natural
alleigeance and awe which was due unto me, the one from all Birds, and to the
other, from all Beasts of Field and Forest.


Pereg. This Fable seems to me, like a Nosegay of fragrant flowers, the
matter of it is so closely put together and made up; but I pray Sir, What
should be the reason, that they made that extravagant proposal for mannaging
the Militia throughout this land.


Patr. They cried out that the Kingdom was upon point of being ruined; that it
was in the very jaws of destruction; that there were foreign and inland
plots against it: all which are proved long since to be nothing else but mere
Chymera's; yet people for the most part, continue still grossly besotted, that
they cannot perceive to this day, that these forged fears, these Vtopian
plots, those public Idea's were framed of purpose, that they might take all
the martial power into their hands; that so they might without controlement
cast the government of Church and state into what mold they pleased, and
ingrosse the chiefest offices to themselves: And from these imaginary invisible
dangers proceeded these visible calamities, and grinding palpable pressures
which has accompanied this odius war ever since.


Pereg. Herein me thinks, your Stastis have shown themselves politic enough,
but not so prudent; for Prudence and Policy, though they often agree in the
end, yet they differ in election of the means to compass their ends: The one
serves himself of truth, strength of Reason, and integrity, and gallantnesse
in their proceedings; the oteer of fictions, fraudulence, lies, and other
sinister means; the work of one is lasting and permanent, the other work
moulders away, and end in infamy; for fraud and frost always end foul. But
how did they requite that most rare and high unexampled trust his Majesty
reposed in them when he before passed that (total) Act of continuance, a
greater trust then ever English put in Parliament. How did they perform their
solemde promise and deep Protestations, to make him the most glorious (at home
and abroad) the richest and best belovedst King that ever reigned in that
Island.


Patr. Herein I must confess, I they held very ill correspondence with him;
for the more he trusted them, the more diffident they grew of him; and truly,
Sir, herein white differs not so much from black, as their actions have been
disconsonant to their words: Touching the first promise, to make him glorius;
if to suffer a neighboring Nation to demand and obtain what they pleased of
him; if to break capitulation of peace with a great foreign Prince by the
renvoy of the Capuchins, and diverse other Acts; if to bring the dregs and
riffraffe of the City to domindere before his Court gato, notwithstanding his
Proclamations; if to confront him and seek his life by fire and sword in open
field, by open defiance, and putting him upon a defensive war; if to vote his
Queen a Traytresse, to shoot at her, to way-lay her to destroy her, if to
hinder the reading of his Proclamations, and the slight in of his Declarations
enclosed in Letters, signed and sealed with his own hand, for fear they
should bring the people to their wits again; if to call them fetters of gold,
divellish devices, fraught with doctrines of division, real mistakes, absurd
suppositions, though never dropped from Princes pen, more full, more rational
and strong sinewy expressions; if to suffer every shallow brained Scoolist to
preach, every Pamphletter to print; every rotten hearted man or woman to prate
what they please of him and his Queen; if to slight his often acknowledgement,
condissentions, retractations, pronuntiations of Peace, and proffers of Pardon;
if to endeavor to bring him to a kind of submission; if to bar him of the
attendance of Domestiques, to abuse and imprison his messengers, to hang his
servants for obeying his Commission; if to prefer the safety and repute of
five ordinary men, before his honoue; and being actually impeached of Treason,
to bring them in a kind of triumph to his House; if for subjects to Article,
Treat and Capitulate hith him; if to tamper with his Conscience, and make him
forget the solemn sacramental oath at his Coronation; if to divest him of all
regal rights, to take from him the election of his servants and officers, and
bring him back to a kind of minority; if this be to make a King glorious, our
King is made glorious enough. Touching the second promise to make him the
richest King that ever was; if to denude him of his native rights, to declare
that he has no property in any thing but by way of trust, not so much
property as an Elect King; if to take away his customs of his inheritance; if
to take from his Exchequer and Mint; if to thrust him out of his own towns,
to suffer a lousy Citizen to lie in his beds within his royal Castle of
Windsor, when he himself would have come thither to lodge; if to enforce him
to a defensive war, and cause him to engage his Jewels and Plate, and plunge
him a bottomless gulf of debt for his necessary defense; if to anticipate
his revenue royal, and reduce him to such exigents that he has scarce the
subsistence of an ordinary Gentleman; if this be make a rich King, then is our
King made sufficiently rich. Concerning their third promise, to make him the
best belovedst King that ever was; if to call all the aspersions that possibly
could be devised upon his government by public elaborate remonstrances; if to
suffer and give Texts to the strongest lung'd Pulpiteers to poison the hearts
of his subjects, to intoxicate their brains with fumes of forged jealousies,
to possess them with an opinion, that he is a Papist in his heart and
consequently has a design to introduce Popery; if to slight his words his
promises; if to his Asseverations, Oaths and Protestations, when he calls
heaven and earth to witness, when he desires no blessing otherwise to fall
upon himself, his wife and children, with other pathetick deep-fetcht
expressions, that would have made the meanest of those millions of Christians
which are his vessals to be believed; if to protect Delinquants, and proclaimed
Traitors against him; if to suscitate, authorize, and encourage all sorts of
subjects to heave up their hands against, and levy arms to emancipate
themselves from that natural allegiance, loyalty, and subjection, wherein,
they and their forefathers were ever tied to his royal Progenitors; if to
make them swear and damn themselves into a rebellion; if this be to make a
King beloved, then this Parliament has made King Charles the best belovedst
King that ever was in England.


Pereg. I cannot compare this Rebellion in England, more properly then to that
in this Kingdom; in King John's time, which in our French Cronicle, bears to
this day the infamous name of Iaqerie de Beauvoisin; Then Peasans then out of a
surfeit of plenty, had grown up to that height of insolenco, that they
confronted the Gentcie, and gathered in multitudes, and put themselves in arms
to suppress them; and this popular tumult never ceased till Charles le Sage
suppressed it; and it made the Kings of France more puissant ever since: for it
much increased their Finances, in regard that these extraordinary taxes which
the people imposed upon themselves for the support of the war, has continued
ever since a firm revenue to the Crown; which makes me think of a fractious
speech of the late Henry the Great, to them of Orleans: for whereas a new
imposition was laid upon them, during the league by Monseur de la Chastre, who
was a great stickler in those wars, they petitioned Henry the fourth, that he
would be pleased to take of that tax, the King asked them, Who had laid that
tax upon them? they said Mons. de la Castres, during the time of the League,
the King replied, Puis que Monsieur de la Chatre vous a ligue qu'il vous
dessligue; and so the said tax continues to this day.

I have observed in your Cronicles that it has been the fate of your Kings to
be baffled often by petty companions; as Jack Stpawe, Wat Tyler, Cade, Warbecke
and Symnel. A Waspe may sometimes do a shrew turn to the Eagle, as you said
before; your Island has been fruitful for Rebellions, for I think there
happened near upon a hundred since the last Conquest, the City of London, as I
remember, in your Story has rebelled seven times at least, and forfeited her
Charter I know not how often, but she bled soundly for it at last, and commonly
the better your Princes, tree worse your people have been, or the case stands, I
see no way for the King to establish a settled peace, the by making a fifth
Conquest of you: and for London, there must be a way found to prick that
tympany of pride wherewith the swells.


Patr. It Is true, there has been from time to time many odd Insurrections in
England, but our Kings gathered a greater strength out of them, the inconstant
people are always accessory to their miseries: Kings Prerogatives are like the
Ocean, which as the Civilians tell us, if he lose in one place, he gets in
another. Care and Cross ride behind Kings, and the same they say, may be
eclypsed awhile, but they will shine afterward with a stronger luster. Our
gracious Sovereign has these three or four years passed a kind of Ordeal or
fiery trial; he has been matriculated and served half an Appretiship in the
School of Affliction; I hope God will please shortly to cancel the Indenture,
and restore him to a sweeter liberty then
