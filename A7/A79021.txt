royal blazon or coat of arms
BY THE KING.
His Majesty's Proclamation forbidding the Tendering or Taking of the late Vow
or Covenant, devised by some Members of both Houses to engage His Majesty's
good Subjects in the maintenance of this odious Rebellion.

Whereas We have lately seen a Vow or Covenant pretended to be taken by some
Members of both Houses of Parliament, whereby after the taking notice of a
Popish and Traitorous Plot for the subversion of the true Reformed Protestant
Religion, and the Liberty of the Subject, and to surprise the Cities of London
and Westminster, They do promise and covenant, according to their utmost
power, to assist the Forces pretended to be raised and continued by both Houses
of Parliament, against the Forces raised by Us, and to assist all other Persons
that shall take the said Oath, in what they shall do in pursuance thereof;
Which Oath as the same has been taken without the least color or ground, the
contrivers thereof well knowing that there is no Popish Army within this
Kingdom, that We are so far from giving countenance to that Religion, that We
have always given, and always offered Our consent to any Act for the
suppression of Popery and the growth thereof; and that the Army raised by Us is
in truth for the necessary defense of the true Reformed Protestant Religion
established by Law, the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and Our own just
Rights according to Law, all which being settled and submitted to, or such a
free and peaceable convention in Parliament being provided for, that the same
might be settled, We have offered and are still ready to disband Our Armies; and
as the said Oath was devised only to prevent Peace, and to preengage the Votes
of the Members of both Houses (directly contrary to the Freedom and Liberty of
Parliament) and to engage them and Our good Subjects in the maintenance of this
horrid and odious Rebellion; so it is directly contrary, as well to their
natural Duty as to the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy established by Law,
which obliges them to bear to Us Truth and Faith of Life, Members and Earthly
Honor, and to defend Us to the utmost of their powers against all conspiracies
and attempts whatsoever, which shall be made against Our Person, Our Crown and
Dignity, and to do their best endeavors to disclose and make known to Us all
Treasons and Traitorous Conspiracies which shall be against Us, and to their
power to assist and defend all Jurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences, and
Authority belonging to Us, or united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of
this Realm. And whereas We are informed that some desperate seditious Persons
do endeavor to persuade and seduce others of Our Subjects to take the said
Oath, thereby to engage them and this Kingdom into a continuance of these
miserable and bloody distempers, We do therefore out of Grace and Compassion
to Our people, and that they may not by any craft or violence suffer themselves
to be seduced against their Duty and Conscience, warn them of their natural
Allegiance, and their Obligations by Oaths lawfully administered to them, and
with them to remember the great blessings of God in peace and plenty which the
whole Kingdom has received, whilst that Duty and these Oaths were carefully
observed, and the unspeakable miseries and calamities they have suffered in the
breaking and violation thereof. And We do straightly Charge and Command Our
loving Subjects of what degree and quality soever, upon their Allegiance, that
they presume not to take the said seditious and traitorous Vow or Covenant,
which endeavors to withdraw them from their natural Allegiance which they owe
unto Us, and to which they are or ought to be sworn, and are bound by the known
Laws of the Land, albeit they are not sworn, and engages them in Acts of High
Treason by the express letter of the Statute of the 25. year of King Edward
the third. And We do likewise hereby forbid and inhibit all our Subjects to
impose, administer, or tender the said Oath or Covenant: And if not
withstanding this Our gracious Proclamation any person s;hall presume to
impose, tender, or take the said Vow or Covenant, We shall proceed against him
or them with all severit, according to the known Laws of the Land.

Given at our Court at Oxford the one and Twentieth day of June, in the
nineteenth year of our Reign.
