, and goodness Psalm. 119.68. with Mat. 19.17.

28.19. 1 Ioh. 4.7. 2 Cor. 13 14.
.

ART. II. Of the Word, or Son of God, which was made very Man.
The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the
Father Pro. 8 22, to 31. Joh. 1 1, 2, 14.
, the very 1 John 5 20. Romans 9.5.
and eternal God Joh. 17.5. Heb. 1.8. with Psalm. 45.6.
, of one substance with the Father John 10.30, Heb. 1.3.
, took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance Joh.
1.14. Isa. 7.14. Luke 1.35. Gal. 4.4.
: So that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say the Godhead and the
Manhood, were joined together in one person, never to be divided, whereof is
one Christ, very God and very Man Isa. 7.14. with Matthew. 1.23. Romans 1.3, 4.
Heb. 13.8
, who for our sakes truly suffered most grievous torments in his soul from God
Isa. 53.10, 11 Mark 14.33, 34.
, was crucified, dead, and buried 1 Pet. 2.24. Phil. 2.8. 1 Cor. 15.3, 4.
, to reconcile his Father to us Ezekiel. 16.63. Romans 3.25. 2 Cor. 5.19.
, and to be a Sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for actual sins
of men Isa. 53.10. Ephesians. 5.2. 1 John 1.7. Heb. 9.26.
.

ART. III.
As Christ died for us, and was buried, so it is to be believed, that he
continued in the state of the dead, and under the power and dominion of death
Psalm. 16.10. with Acts 2.24, 25, 26, 27, 31.
, from the time of his death and Burial until his resurrection Romans 6.9 Matthew.
12.40.
: which has been otherwise expressed thus, He went down into Hell.

ART. IIII. Of the Resurrection of Christ.
Christ did truly rise again from death 1 Cor. 15.4. Romans 8.34. Psalm. 16.10.
with Acts 2.31. Luke 24.34
, and took again his Body, with Flesh, Bones, and all things appertaining to
the perfection of Man's nature Luke 24 39. with Joh. 20.25, 27.
, wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sits Psalm. 68.18. with Ephesians.
4.8. Psalm. 110.1. with Acts 2.34.35. Mar. 16.19. Romans 8.34.
, until he return to judge Act 3.21. Psalm. 110.1. with 1 Cor. 15.25, 26. Acts
1.11.
all Men 2 Cor. 5.10. Acts 17.31.
at the general resurrection of the Body at the last day Exodus 3.6. with Luke
20.37, 38. Acts 24.14, 15. 1 Cor. 15.12. to the end. Joh. 5.28, 29.
.

ART. V. Of the Holy Ghost.
The Holy Ghost is very and eternal God, of one substance 2 Samuel 23.2. with
verse. 3. Isa. 6.5, 8. with Acts 28.25. Acts 5.3, 4. 1 Cor. 3.16. 1 Cor. 6.19.
, Majesty Job 26.13. Job 33.4. 1 Cor. 12. chap. Mat. 28.19. 2 Cor. 13.14.
, and glory with the Father and the Son 1 Cor. 12.11. Ephesians. 1.17. and 1 Cor.
2.8. with 1 Pet. 4.14.
, proceeding from the Father and the Son Joh. 15.26. Matthew 10.20. and 1 Cor.
2.11, 12. with Gal. 4.6. and Romans 8.9. and Phil. 1.9. Joh. 16.14. Isai. 11, 2.
Isai. 61.1. Genesis 1.2. 2 Chronicles. 15.1.
.

ART. VI. Of the sufficiency of the holy Scriptures for Salvation.
Holy Scripture Romans 1.2. 2 Timothy 3.15. 2 Pet. 1.20, 21.
contains all things necessary to salvation Psalm. 19.7. 2 Timothy 3.15.16, 17.
Jam. 1.21, 25. Acts 20.32.
; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to
be believed as an Article of Faith, or necessary to salvation Prove. 30.5, 6.
Isa. 8.20. Acts 26.22. with ver. 20, 27. Gal. 1.8, 9. Joh. 5.39.
.

By the name of holy Scripture, we understand all the Canonical Books of the
Old and New Testament; which follow.

Of the Old Testament, Genesis, Exodus, etc. Of the New Testament, The Gospel
according to Matthew, etc.
All which Books, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and
acknowledge them to be given by the inspiration of God, and in that regard to
be of most certain credit, and highest authority.

ART. VII. Of the Old Testament.
The Old Testament is not contrary to the New, in the doctrine contained in
them Acts 26.22, 23. 2 Pet. 3.2. Luke 24.44, Romans 3.31. Gal. 3.21.23, 24.
; for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind
by Christ Genesis 3.15. Genesis 22.18. with Gal. 3.8, 14. 1 Cor. 10.2, 3, 4. Luke
1.69.70. Acts 3.24. Isa. 53. Chap.
, who is the only Mediator between God and Man Dan. 9.17. Romans 8.34. 1 John
2.1. Heb. 7.25. 1 Timothy 2.5 Ioh. 14.6.
, being both God and Man Gol. 4.4.5. Acts 20.28. Phil. 2.7, 8.
. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign, that the old Fathers did
look only for temporary promises Acts 26.6, 7 Romans 4.11. Gal. 3.9. Heb. 11.10,
16, 35.
.

Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites,
do not bind Christians Gal. 4.9, 10. Col. 2.14, 16, 17. Heb. 9.9, 10.
; nor the Civil precepts given by Moses, such as were peculiarly fitted to the
Commonwealth of the Jews, are of necessity to be received in any Commonwealth
Acts 25.9, 10, 25. with Deuteronomy. 17.8, to 13. Rom 13 1, 5. ^i^. 3.1. 1 Pet. 2.13,
14.
: yet notwithstanding no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of
the Commandments which are called Moral Matthew. 5.17, to the end. Romans 13.8, 9,
10. Ephesians. 6.1, 2, 3. Iam. 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Romans 7.25. Romans 3.31. Matthew. 7.12.
. By the Moral Law we understand all the ten Commandments taken in their full
extent.

ART. IX. Of Original, or Birth-sin.
Original sin Psalm. 51.5. Ioh. 3.5, 6.
stands not in the following of Adam, as the Pelagians do vainly talk Job
14.4. Job 15.14. Romans 6.6. John 3.3, 5, 7.
: But, together with his first sin imputed Romans 5.12, to 19. Genesis 2.17. with 1
Cor. 15.22.
, it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every Man, that naturally is
propagated from Adam; whereby Man is wholly deprived of Original righteousness
Col. 2.13. Romans 7.18. Eccles. 7.29.
, and is of his own nature inclined only to evil Genesis 6.5. Genesis 8.21. Ier.
17.9. Romans 7.8. James 1.14.
. So that the lust of the flesh, called in Greek (...), which some do expound
the Wisdom, some Sensuality, some the Affection, some the Desire of the flesh,
is not subject to the Law of God Romans 8.7. 1 Cor. 2.14 Col. 1.2.
, and therefore in every person Born into this world, it deserves Gods wrath
and damnation Ephesians. 2.3. Romans 8.6, 7.
. And this infection of nature does remain, yea in them that are regenerate
Prove. 20.9. Romans 7.17, 20, 23, 25.
, whereby the flesh lusts always contrary to the Spirit Gal. 5.17.
. And although there is no condemnation for them that are regenerate and do
believe Romans 8.1, 13. Ioh. 3.18.
, yet the Apostle does confess that concupiscence and lust is truly and
properly sin Romans 7.17, 20.
.

ART. X. Of Free Will.
The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn or
prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith and
calling upon God Ephesians. 2.1, 5. 1 Cor. 2.14. Ephesians. 2.8, 9, 10. John 6.44, 65.
; wherefore we have no power to do good work pleasing and acceptable to God
Romans 8.8. Heb. 11.6.
, without the grace of God by Christ, both preventing us, that we may have a
good Will, and working so effectually in us, as that it determines our Will to
that which is good Ezekiel. 11.19.20. Ezekiel. 36.26, 27. Jer. 31, 32 33. with Heb
^.10, 11. Phil. 2.12, 13. Joh. 6.45. Ephesians. 1.19 20. 1 Cor. 4.7.
, and also working with us when we have that will unto good Heb. 13.21. Phil.
1.6. Heb. 122.2. 1 Pet. 5.10. 1 Thessalonians. 5.23, 24. 1 Kings 8.57, 58.
.

ART. XI. Of the Justification of man before God.
We are justified, that is, we are accounted Righteous before God, and have
remission of sins Romans 4.5, 6, 7. Psalm. 32.1, 2.
, not for nor by our own works or deservings Romans 3.20. Gal. 2.16. Gal. 3.10,
11. Phil. 3.^.
, but freely by his grace Romans 3.24. Tit. 3.7.
, only for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's sake Romans 3.24, 25. Romans 5.1. 2
Cor. 5.18, 19.
, his whole obedience and satisfaction being by God imputed unto us Romans 5.9,
17, 18, 19. Romans 3.25, 26. Romans 4.6, 24. 2 Cor. 5.21.
, and Christ with his Righteousness, being apprehended and rested on by faith
only Romans 3.22, 25, 26, 28. Gal. 2.16. Isa. 28.16. with Romans 9.33. and 1 Pet.
2.6. Phil. 3.9.
. The doctrine of Justification by Faith only, is an wholesome Doctrine, and very
full of comfort 2 Timothy 1.13. Romans 5.1, 2, 8, 11. Romans 15.13. 1 Pet. 1.8.
: notwithstanding God does not forgive them that are impenitent, and go on
still in their trespasses Psalm. 68.20, 21. Exodus 34.6, 7. Luke 13.3, 5.
.

ART. XII. Of good Works.
Good works, which are the Fruits of Faith Gal. 5.6. Jam. 2.17, 18, 22.
, and follow after Justification Tit. 2.14. Tit 3.7, 8. Ephesians. 2.8, 9, 10.
, cannot put away our sins Romans 3.20, 21. Romans 4.4, to 9. Dan. 9.18, 19.
, and endure the severity of Gods Judgment Neh. 13.22. Psalm. 143.2. Job
9.14.15, 19, 20.
; yet are they, notwithstanding their imperfections Exodus 28.38. Rev. 8.3, 4.
, in the sight of God pleasing and acceptable unto him in and for Christ 1 Pet.
2.5. Heb. 13.16, 20, 21. Col. 1.10. Phil. 4.18.
, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith Jam. 2.16. 1 John
1.4.
, in so much that by them a lively Faith may be evidently known, as a tree
discerned by the fruits Jam. 2.18, 22, John 15.4, 5. 1 John 2.3.5. Matthew. 12.33.
.

ART. XIII. Of Works before Justification.
Works done before Justification by Christ, and Regeneration by his Spirit, are
not pleasing unto God Tit. 1.15, 16. Matthew 7.18. Romans 8.8. Prove. 15.8, 26.
Prove. 21.27. Romans 3.12.
, for as much as they spring not of Faith in Jesus Christ Hebr. 11.5.6. Gal.
5.6.
; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School-Authors
say) deserve grace of Congruity 2 Timothy 1.9. John 1.13.
; yea rather, for that they are not done as God has willed and commanded them
to be done, they are sinful Romans 8, 7, 8. Hagg. 2.14 Isa. 58.1, to 5. Isa.
66.2, 3.
.

ART. XIV. Of Works of Supererogation.
Voluntary Works, besides, over and above Gods Commandments, which they call
Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught Matthew. 5.48. Mar. 12.30, 31. Phil.
4.5, 9.
without arrogance and impiety Job 9.2, 3.20, 21. Psalm. 143.2. Prove. 20.9.
Phil. 3.8, to 15.
: for by them men do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as
they are bound to do; but that they do more for his sake than of bounden duty
is required; whereas Christ says plainly, When you have done all those things
that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants, we have done that
which was our duty to do Luke 17.10. with ver. 7, 8, 9.
.

ART. XV. Of Christ alone without sin.
Christ in the truth of our nature, was made like unto us in all things, sin
only excepted Isa. 53.3, 4, 5. Heb. 2.17. with Heb. 5.15.
, from which he was clearly void both in his Flesh and in his Spirit Luke 1.35.
with Act. 3.14. John 14.30. 2 Cor. 5.21. Heb. 7.26.
: he came to be the Lamb without spot 1 Pet. 1.19.
, who by Sacrifice of Himself Ephesians. 5.2.
once made Heb. 9.26, 28. Heb. 10.10, 12.
, should take away the sins of the world John 1.29.
; and sin (as Saint John says) was not in him 1 John 3.^.
. But all we the rest, although baptized and regenerate, yet offend in many
things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is
not in us James 3.2. 1 John 1.8, 10.

Rules and Directions CONCERNING Suspension from the SACRAMENT OF THE LORDS
SVPPER in case of Ignorance.
1. ALl such persons who shall be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper
ought to know that there is a God, that there is but one ever-living and true
God, maker of Heaven and Earth, and Governor of all things; That this only
true God, is the God whom we worship; that this God is but one, yet three
distinct Persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all equally God.

2. That God created man after his own Image, in knowledge, righteousness, and
true holiness; That by one man sin entered into the World, and death by sin, and
so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned; That thereby they are
all dead in trespasses and sins, and are by nature the children of wrath, and
so liable to eternal death, the wages of every sin.

3. That there is but one Mediator between God and Man the Man Christ Jesus,
who is also over all, God blessed for ever, neither is there salvation in any
other; That he was conceived by the holy Ghost, and Born of the Virgin Mary;
That he dyed upon the Cross to save his people from their Sins; That he rose
again the third day from the dead, ascended into Heaven, sits at the right hand
of God, and makes continual intercession for us, of whose fullness we receive
all grace necessary to salvation.

4. That Christ and his benefits are applied only by faith; That faith is the
gift of God, and that we have it not of our selves, but it is wrought in us by
the Word and Spirit of God.

That faith is that grace whereby we believe and trust in Christ for remission
of sins and life everlasting, according to the promise of the Gospel, that
whosoever believes not on the Son of God, shall not see life, but shall perish
eternally.

That they who truly repent of their sins do see them, sorrow for them, and
turn from them to the Lord, and that except men repent they shall surely perish.

That a godly life is conscionably ordered according to the word of God, in
Holiness and Righteousness, without which no man shall see God.

That the Sacraments are Seals of the Covenant of Grace in the blood of Christ:
That the Sacraments of the new Testament are Baptism and the Lords Supper; that
the outvvard Elements in the Lords Supper are Bread and Wine, and do signify
the Body and Blood of Christ Crucified, which the worthy Receiver by Faith,
does partake of in this Sacrament, which Christ has likewise Ordained for a
remembrance of his death, that whosoever eats and drinks unworthily, is guilty
of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and therefore that every one is to examine
himself, lest he eat and drink Judgment to himself, not discerning the Lords
Body.

That the Souls of the faithful after death do immediately live with Christ in
Blessedness, and that the Souls of the wicked do immediately go into Hell
torments. That there shall be a Resurrection of the Bodies both of the just and
unjust at the last Day, at which time all shall appear before the Judgment
Seat of Christ to receive according to what they have done in the Body, whether
it be good or evil: And that the righteous shall go into life eternal and the
wicked into everlasting punishment.

And it is further Ordained by the Lords and Commons, That those who have a
competent measure of understanding concerning the matters contained in these
Articles, shall not be kept back from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper for
Ignorance; And that the Examination and Judgment of such Persons as shall for
their ignorance of the aforesaid points of Religion not to be admitted to the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is to be in the power of the Eldership of every
Congregation.

15. That an Act or Acts of Parliament be passed, That the Deputy or chief
Governor, or other Governors of Ireland, and the Presidents of the several
Provinces of that Kingdom, be nominated and made in such way as by both Houses
of the Parliament of England shall be appointed, or in the Interv^^^ of
Parliament by such Committees as shall be appointed by both Houses of
Parliament, to continue during the pleasure of both Houses; And that the
Chancellor, or Lord Keeper, Lord Treasurer, Commissioners of the Great Seal or
Treasury, Lord High Admiral of England, Commissioners of the Admiralty, Lord
Warden of the Cinque Ports, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Duchy, Secretaries
of State, Masters of the Rolls, Judges of both Benches, and Barons of the
Exchequer of the Kingdoms of England and Ireland, the Constable and Lieutenant
of the Tower of London, and the Vice-Treasurer, and Treasurer at Wars of the
Kingdom of Ireland, Be nominated and made in such way as by both Houses of the
Parliament of England shall be appointed to continue Quam diu se been
gesserint, and in the Intervals of Parliament, by the said Committee appointed
by both Houses of Parliament as aforesaid, to be approved or disallowed by both
Houses at their next meeting.

16. That for the more effectual disabling of Jesuits, Papists, and Popish
Recusants, from disturbing the State, and deluding the Laws, and for the better
discovering and speedy conviction of Popish Recusants an Oath be established by
Act of Parliament to be administered to them, wherein they shall abjure and
renounce the Popes Supremacy, the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, Purgatory,
Worshipping of the Consecrated Host, Crucifixes and Images, and all other
Popish Superstitions and Errors; and refusing the said Oath, being tendered in
such manner as shall be appointed by the said Act, to be a sufficient
conviction of Popish Recusancy.

17. An Act or Acts of Parliament for Education of the Children of Papists by
Protestants, in the Protestant Religion.

18. An act or acts for the true Leavy of the Penalties against them; which
Penalties to be Leavied and Disposed in such manner as both Houses shall agree
on.

19. That an Act or Acts be passed in Parliament, whereby the practices of
Papists against the State may be prevented, and the Laws against them duly

The like for the Kingdom of Ireland, concerning the four last preceding
Propositions.

20. That the King do give his Royal Assent to an Act or Acts for the due
Observation of the Lord's Day.

21. And to the Bill for the suppression of Innovations in Churches and
Chapels, in and about the Worship of God.

22. And for the better advancement of the Preaching of Gods Holy Word, in all
parts of this Kingdom.

23. And to the Bill against the enjoying Pluralities of Benefices, by
Spiritual persons and Non-residency.

They have also Commanded us to desire. That your Majesty give your Royal
Assent to these Bills, by your Letters Parents under the Great Seal of England,
and Signed by your Hand, and Declared and Notified to the Lords and Commons
assembled together in the House of Peers, according to the Law declared in that
behalf, it appearing unto them upon mature deliberation, that it stands not
with the safety and security of the Kingdom and Parliament, to have your
Majesty's assent at this time given otherwise; They desire therefore, that your
Majesty be pleased to grant your Warrant for the draught of a Bill for such
your Letters Patents, to be presented to your Majesty, and then a Warrant to
Edward Earl of Manchester, and William Lenthal Esquire, Speaker of the House of
Commons, who have now the Custody of the Great Seal of England, to put the same
to such your Majesty's Letters Pateuts Signed as aforesaid, thereby authorizing
Algernon Earl of Northumberland, Henry Earl of Kent, John Earl of Rutland,
Philip Earl of Pembrook, William Earl of Salisbury, Robert Earl of Warwick, and
Edmund Earl of Mulgrave, or any three of them, to give your Majesty's Royal
assent unto the said Bills, according to the Law in that behalf Declared: And
for the other particulars contained in the aforementioned Propositions, the two
Houses of Parliament will after such your Majesty's assent given to the said
Bills, send a Committee of both Houses to Treat with your Majesty in the Isle
of Wight thereupon.

FINIS.
