By the King. A Proclamation touching common Maultsters, and Brewers.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty has taken into consideration the manifold
inconveniences that arise to this Kingdom by the excessive number of persons,
who take upon them the Art and mystery of Mault-making in all parts of the
Realm, who from time to time engrosse and get into their hands such quantities
of Barley to convert into Malt, as often produces a scarcity of that kind of
Grain, which for the poorer sort of people is their usual Bread the Markets
also by means hereof are forestalled and unfurnished, and sundry abuses and
deceipts are practiced by them in the making of Malt in unseasonable months
of the year, and in lesser space of time in the Fatt, and Floor, then it can
be perfectly made, and by making it of Mow-burnt, or spired-Barley, and by
slack and deceitful drying thereof, and by mixing and selling of good and bad
Malt together, and by putting to sale of Malt not well and sufficiently
trodden, rubbed or fanned from the dross thereof, whereby it becomes
unwholesome and deceiptfull in the use, contrary to sundry good provisions made
by several Acts of Parliament in that behalf, and to the common deceit of
this Kingdom and people; His Majesty out of his Princely care to reform
as well these evils, as sundry other unlawful practices now used in the making
and selling of Malt, Has thought fit (by the advice of His privy Council) to
lessen their multitude, and to appoint and settle in fit places of the Realm a
competent number of meet persons for common Maultsters, such as being approved
of by his Majesty's Privy Council, and after incorporated and reduced under
government, in each County, may become bound to His Majesty to reform the
abuses now commonly practiced in that Trade, and to make and sell good and
wholesome Malt, and at reasonable prices according to the law: And therefore
His Majesty does hereby declare and publish His Royal will and pleasure to be;
And does straightly charge and command, that no person or persons whatsoever now
using, or which hereafter shall use any other Trade or mystery, shall use or
practice the Trade of a common Maultster, or shall buy Barley or other Grain
to malt it, and sell it again; And that no persons whatsoever, in the months
of June, July and August, or any of them do convert any Barley or other Grain
into Malt to sell; And that in other the proper and seasonable months of the
year for maulting, the same Malt shall have in the making thereof (viz.) in
the Fatt, Floor, steeping and drying thereof, the time and space of three
weeks at the least, without which time the same cannot be well and perfectly
made, nor wholesome for man's body: And that no persons whatsoever that convert
any Grain into Malt to sell, shall buy any Malt, to the intent to sell the
same again. And His Majesty's pleasure is, that no persons whatsoever, from
and after Christmas next, shall take upon them the Trade of common Maultsters,
or shall make Malt to sell, unless they shall be incorporated and reduced
under the said government, nor shall use the Trade of Maulting in any other
Town or place then shall be assigned them by His Majesty's Privy Council, or
His Commissioners in that behalf. And in all and singular the premises, His
Majesty requires all due conformity and obedience of His Subjects, upon pain
of His Majesty's high indignation and displeasure, and such penalties and
punishments as by the Laws or Statutes of the Realm, or otherwise may be
inflicted on them for their contempts or neglects herein.

Nevertheless, His Majesty's intentions are, that it shall be lawful for all
persons which shall have of their own any Barley or Corn growing, or any
Tithe Corn, or Rent-corne reserved upon any Lease or Demise, to convert into
Malt all or any such Barley or Corn, and to vent and sell the same without
restraint; And that any person or persons shall and may buy any Corn or
Grain, and convert the same into Malt for the use and provision of his or
their own house or family only, any thing herein contained to the contrary
thereof notwithstanding.

And herein also His Majesty does further declare his Royal Will and Pleasure
to be, That if any Maultsters whatsoever, already Incorporated or Licenced, or
hereafter to be Incorporated or Licenced, or any other persons whatsoever,
shall at any time or times hereafter, directly or indirectly, conspire,
combine, covenant, or agree together, That they will not buy Barley, or other
Grain to convert to Malt, nor will sell the same so Maulted, but at set and
certain prices limited and appointed by and amongst themselves, whereby His
Majesty's Subjects shall be constrained to sell their Barley or other Maulting
Grain at low and cheap prices, and to buy their Malt at high and dear
rates, or shall make or put in ure any other conspiracy, combination, practice,
covenant, or agreement amongst themselves, or any of them, tending to the
Inhauncing or abating of prices, or other public inconvenience, That then
every such Corporation, or persons so Licenced, or others whatsoever so
conspiring, combining, practicing, or agreeing together in setting of prices
(being convicted thereof) shall not only incur the forfeitures, penalties,
and punishments ordained by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm in that
behalf, but shall be disabled for ever after to use that Trade, and shall be
further proceeded against with all severe and exemplary punishment, which His
Majesty will strictly require to be executed on them. And whereas his Majesty
has likewise taken into consideration the manifold inconveniences arising to
his Kingdom and people, for that Innkeepers, Alehouse-keepers, Tauerners,
Cooks, and other Victuallers, do take upon them to Brew the Beer and Ale
they utter by Retaile, and thereby, for their own private lucre and gain, and
with the consumption of double the Malt, and Fuel that is needful, do make
strong, heady, and unwholesome drinks, serving rather for drunkenness and
excess, then for any good or necessary use, and do utter and Retaile the same
without keeping the Assize or prices appointed by the Law; His Majesty
intending reformation likewise herein, is pleased to appoint and settle in fit
places in England and Wales, a convenient number of common Brewers, such as
shall be allowed of by His Majesty's Privy Council, who being likewise
Incorporated and reduced under government, may become bound to His Majesty, as
well to reform the abuses now commonly practiced in that Trade, as to Brew
wholesome Beer and Ale, and therein to observe the Assise and prices appointed
by the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, and who may also breed and bring up
Apprentices in the same Trade. His Majesty therefore by like advice of His
Privy Council, does hereby express and declare his Royal Will and Pleasure
to be, and does straightly charge and command, That no Innkeeper,
Alehouse-keeper, Tauerner, Cook, or Victualler whatsoever, in any County,
City, Borough, Town Corporate, or other place or places whatsoever, within
the Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales, as well within Liberties as
without, from and after the Feast of S. Michael the Archangell next coming,
shall Brew any Beer or Ale, to utter or sell by Retaile, but shall have or
receive the same, of or from some common Brewer, allowed and settled, or to be
allowed and settled by His Majesty, or by His Commissioners in that behalf.
Nevertheless, His Majesty's intentions are, That in such places where there
shall be no such common Brewers allowed, or being allowed, they will not serve
the said Innkeepers, Alehouse-keepers, and other Victuallers with Beer and
Ale, by carrying and delivering of the same at their several houses, that in
every such place only, and in none other, it shall be lawful for any the said
Innkeepers, Tauerners, Alehouse-keepers, and Victuallers, to Brew their own
Beer or Ale, and to sell the same by Retaile, as heretofore they have done;
Any thing herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

And His Majesty does hereby further declare; That every such person as shall
be allowed, as aforesaid, for a common Brewer, shall not be licenced or allowed
to make his own Malt, nor shall use the Trade of a common Maultster, Cooper,
nor any other Trade; And that every person so to be allowed for a common
Brewer, shall make and sell wholesome Beer and Ale, and shall sell and utter
the same at reasonable prizes, and shall keep the Assize thereof according to
the Laws and Statutes of the Realm; And to these his Majesty's Royal
commands, His Majesty does likewise require of all His Subjects, all due
conformity and obedience, as they tender His high displeasure, and such
punishments as shall be meet for their contempts.

Provided always, that these presents, or any thing herein concerning Brewing,
shall not extend to the City of London, or four miles distance of the same.
And His Majesty does lastly require and command all Justices of the Peace,
Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffes, Constables, Head-boroughes, and all other His
Majesty's Officers and Ministers, to take care in their several places, that
His Majesty's Royal pleasure herein declared, may be duly performed, as they
tender His Majesty's service.

Given at the Court at Greenwich, the ninth day of July, in the thirteenth
year of His Majesty's Reign.
God save the King.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1637.
