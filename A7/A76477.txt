3 Of my own spiritual estate how it stands before God. Rev. 3. 17. Thou
know not that thou art wretched, etc. in what state thou stand before God.
1 What I am in a state of nature, viz. in a woeful estate of sin and misery.
Romans 5. 17. and 21. As sin has reigned unto death. 1 I am in Adam altogether
lost. Wherein note three things, 1 That Genesis 1. 27. God created man in his own
Image, that is, in knowledge, righteousness and holiness, Ephesians. 4. 24.
Adam the first man was created of God in his own Image. 2 That Genesis 3. 21 Have
thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should not eat.

All have sinned (in Adam) and fall short of the glor^ of God, that is, they do
not attain to that glorious Image of God which man ha^ at first.
fruit, was deprived of this glorious Image of God. 3 That by Rom 5. 12. and
19. By one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, so death passed upon
all men. By Adam sin, that is, the guilt of sin, by imputation, and corruption
by propagation, entered in^o the world, that is, came on all his posterity and
death the wages of that sin, seized on all his posterity. Ephesians. 2. 3. By
nature the children of wrath, as we are in Adam the first that sinned, we are
all liable to the wrat^ of God.
Adam sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so I sinned in Adam, and am
by nature a child of wrath.
2 I am in sin wholly dead. Wherein two things. 1 By Romans 5 12 In whom, i. e.
in Adam, all have sinned, ph'. Genesis 6. 5. That every imagination of the
thoughts of his heart was only evil, i e. or the whole frame of the soul,
and all the purposes and intentions thereof.

dye. Romans 6. 23. The wages of sin is death.
to corporal and eternal death.
3 I am by the Law of God accursed. Wherein 4 things, 1 The Romans 10. 5. The man
that does those things, that is, that are commanded in the Law, shall live by
them. Gal. 3. 12 that is, that does exactly perform them.
Law of God requires exact obedience to every Command. 2 The Lev. 18. 5. If a
man do, he shall live in them, or by them: This is a legal promise, and
differs from the promises of the Gospel, wherein life is promised to him that
believes in Jesus Christ. Romans 2. 13. The doers are justified.
Law of God promises life to the doer, i. e. eternal life to him that obeyes
it. 3 The Gal. 3. 20. Cursed is every one that continues not in all things that
are written in the book of the Law to do them. Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Cursed is he that
establishes not the words of this Law to do them.
Law threatens death, and the curse to the transgressour. 4 Every Romans 3. 19.
What things the Law says, it says to them who are under the Law. Romans 7. 1.
The Law has dominion over a man that is under it. 1 Timothy 1. 9. The Law is not
made for a righteous man, that is, in its exacting and condemning power, but
for the lawless.

redeemed. Wherein two things 1 That Ephesians. 2. 2. According to the Prince of the
power of the Air, that is, Satan the prince of darkness, in the lusts of our
flesh. 2 Timothy 2. 26. Who are taken captive by him at his will, that is, by
Satan.
I was by nature in bondage to sin and Satan, under their power at their
commands. 2 I am 1 Pet. 1. 19. Ye were redeemed with the precious blood of
Christ. 1 Timothy 2. 6. Who gave himself a ransom for all, that is, a sufficient
price of redemption for all. Matthew. 20. 28. The Son of man came to give his
life a ransom for many.

to be a ransom for me.
