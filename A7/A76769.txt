THE BISHOPS Last Vote in PARLIAMENT.

OR, Their Supersedeas from both Houses, in February, 1641.

Who are now wished to attend their Flock, seeing they have time and leisure.

Or if they will to preach in the Tower.

Tempora Mutantur. London, Printed for John Thomas, 1641.

Good Night to the Lord Bishops.
WHat gone my Lords, clean outed, has an exit now at last passed upon the
Myter, though with much ado: Why God be thanked for it, and never send us
worser news, Now you are eased of your Lordships, we hope that you will be
better acquainted with the familiar and Christian term of brother, and seeing
ye are dismissed of Temporal, (knowing that you hold it not only a great
shame, but a great sin to be idle) we trust to find you more frequent in your
spiritual charge and Pastoral employment, the execution whereof would be
questionless more consonant to reason, more agreeable to the minds of all good
men, and more acceptable to your Master that should be, (and as I hope for
hereafter you will better take him to be) Jesus Christ. Who for his part we all
know never gave order, never allowed greatness in his, save such as proceeds
from contemptaion and annihilation of a man's own self, which indeed is the
only greatness greatly, yea; only respected of him, and which if he sees not
in his immediate servants, (viz.) his Ministers, they shall be very small with
him how great soever they may be either in their own dazzling eyes, or in these
of worldly men: Good (Mr. Bishops, for my Lord is gone now) let me be bold to
tell you that which I suppose some of you know already (though for all I dare
not undertake their Bishoprics far in revenue surpassing, their knowledge in
actu, did you ever observe that creatures living in two Elements, were never
beloved, but ever hanted and pursued by either the Beast or Foul, solely
appropiated unto one or the other Element nature loves no division in place,
not the God of Nature in employments, are not the Otter, the Beaver the so^^e
eshewed, hated, shunned, and fled from by all Fish and Fire of the Sea, are
they not sought or watched for, and laid in wait for, by all creatures on
land, Dread they not these, fear they not those, are they in peace in the
Water; are they quiet on Shore, nor flock they nor sort they together in
flocks, or companies as all other creatures that only challenge unto
themselves one Element or continual reside and stay, neither are they not
termed Animalia Soliuaga, creatures wandering alone, and that may bid a pox of
their Company? Marry are they, what may the reason of this be, it is apparent,
divided in nature, divided in disposition out of a covetous desire to share in
commons with all other settled and determinate creatures in respect of Station,
they utterly loose them in love and affection, would it had not been your
fortune or rather faults, that the world had not had so just an occasion and
ground to note you, like to the forenamed beasts in the quality of your
Function, for then surely it would never have proved to you, as all other
creatures did to them in them, in the matter of disaffection, nothing about you
that you wore for matter of habit, nothing that you taught for matter of habit,
nothing that you taught for matter of belief or Doctrine, nothing that you did
for matter of employment and action, none to whom you did belong in matter of
service and duty, but savoured, yea stunke of an Otter, Beaver, or Soil, viz.
of a strange sundred Hocus Pecus, Hodge Podge, incongruus ridictionus,
monstrous exorbitancie, and now let us first by leave examine your Lincie
Wolsey habit; that is Mag-pie like white and black, making show of more
cleanness without then ever by good action could appear of innocence within,
next a cap God bless upon your heads, and that must have as many corners as a
Cushion, or else the fats in the fire, for each corner forsooth points at a
Cardinals virtue, doubt it not, as certainly as the Sea-mans Card does at the
four Cardinal Winds, though upon trial made, your pericranium will be found
as guiltless of their knowledge, as your lives and doings are of the practice
(except I cry you mercy good gaffer Bishops) your Cap-corners may point at
the four Cardinal Virtues of Rome, there perhaps he points right, for some of
you within these late days have been sound as well proceeded in the Cardinal
Virtue of Pride, in the Cardinal Virtue of Coveteousnes, and in the cardinal
Virtue of detestable Sloth and Idleness, (to say nothing of the cardinal Virtue
of Superstition, because if I should name more cardinal Virtues then the cap
has corners) I say with these cardinal virtues you are as ably endowed, as
any cardiuall in the conclave at Rome whatsoever, now for your Doctrine, if
that was not composed of two Elements let the world judge, for what was the
scope of your discourse whenever you were pleased to stand half an hour in
the Pulpit, but this that a man might live as safe in the Water as on shore, in
the puddles of the Roman Superstition, as on the firm ground of Gods Gospel,
you were lukewarm forsooth, between the cold Papist, and the hot Zealous
Protestant (who you in your temporizing temperate discretion are pleased to
call Puritan) and are therefore vomited out of the mouth of Christ, and out of
the respect of all good men; your employment was part for Heaven, and your
Master, Christ, when you had nothing else to do, partly for Earth and your
Master the King, whom I must needs say you served a great deal better then
Christ, for truly to give you your due you plied his service, but some think
your own under his Skirts, both in the Star Chamber, and the High Commission
exceeding well, but it was both with reservation and expectation that the King
should ply you with fat Benefices, great Bishoprics, high Honors, for no man
must conceive that you must plie for nothing, you plide the King in what you
thought fitting, the King must comply with you forsooth in what you please, but
now the World is come about, it is day all abroad although it is night with
you, there be some others (of whom you little dreamt some two or three years
ago) that have plide you now (somewhat to your easel must confess, though not
to your content) and as they have plide and served your pompous Titles and
Temporal Votes in Parliament, with Courts and Jurisdictions with a Writ of
Ease, for we trust they will distribute your enclosed ast means and
unmeasurable Revenues with a Writ of conscionable division; for to come to the
matter, if you are so well skilled in the Scripture, as both your age and place
requires, how dare you gape after earthly Titles, when Christ your master
(whom now I hope you will hear seeing you can better tend it) commands you
plainly, be yea not called Lords? and tell his Disciples (whose successors
you would feign be in Dignity, but not in pains) that though it was so among
the Heathen yet it should not be so with them, you must needs equal
Potentates and Kings, you are personae mixta, you are, no no the Parliament
has contrived you out of that opinion now, you were, and you had somewhat to
do about Heaven, and more upon Earth (divisum Officium) but fee the Power and
efficacy of a Parliament, they have made you all to mind Heavenly things, yea
although it be against your will, to be short good Bishops, mind that calling
for which all good men will mind you, think no more of serving two masters,
least you be beloved of neither, hunt no more after earthly employments and
preferments, least at length you have no place neither in one nor other, follow
my council, in so doing you may in time gain something that you have lost,
but be that cannot be content to come out of the Tower and preach as his
Brethren do, let him for my part stay there still, or if he will needs have
the Title of Lord, let him quit the Kingdom and trudge Tiber, if he will to
Tiburne, no question we shall soon have an ^onester man in his place who will
be content with such dignity, as it has pleased Christ to give him.

FINIS.
