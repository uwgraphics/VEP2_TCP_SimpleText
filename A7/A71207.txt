The danger of TREATIES WITH POPISH-SPIRITS.
OR, A seasonable Caveat, and Premonition to our present most renowned
PARLIAMENT, touching the frail trust in the Vows and Protestations of
Popishly-affected Princes, for Peace and Reconcilement with their Protestant
Subjects.
Abundans Cautela non nocet.
ALthough it must needs be granted, that (as the Poet sings) pax est
dulcissimareru^; Peace (especially married to truth) is a most sweet and
precious temporal blessing, and a most amiable and desirable thing; And that,
that of the Apostle, To. 12. 18. is most true, If it be possible, as much as in
you is, have peace with all men; And although I therefore do most justly and
ingenuously acknowledge, that our most renowned Parliamentary Worthies do most
holily and honorably both before God and all good men in entering into Treaties
and Propositions for peace, and thereby do most prudently and piously l^berare
animas suas, and stop the slanderous mouths of malignants: yet it must be as
necessarily granted that it is a most essential part of prudence, to be most
careful and circumspect in the managing the results and settlement thereof
unto such safe and secure issues for succeeding times, and (if it be possible)
for the more certain avoiding of future dangerous after-claps, as themselves,
and the Subject may receive certain content and comfort therein for future
times, especially after a promised and (though most deeply) protested
reconciliation with popishly affected, and atheistically principled Malignants
formerly offended with their Protestant Peers and people. In which respect, O
the most sad and sanguine, O the base and bloody after claps, and calamitous,
catastrophes, and most lamentable events which have followed and fallen upon
the plain and honest-hearted peacedefiring people and Protestant Subjects of
popish Princes, under the name and vicious vizard of pretended and protested
peace, forsooth, end reconcilement with them! Most worthily, therefore, says
the fountain of truth, the Spirit of God, by the pious Prophet David, though he
himself was a very virtuous and holy King, Put not any trust in Princes, nor
in any sons of men. Which is most true, not only in respect of the brevity
and shortness of their lives, but also of the inconstancy of their words and
promises; for; how did Ioab one of David's Princes or famous war-worthies, under
show and semblance of pretended love and peaceful embracements, most
treacherously murder both Abner and Amasa, two other most renowned worthies of
Israel, whom, otherwise, in open hostility he could hardly have wronged? And
how was that ancient and famous City of Troy (so renowned by Poets pens,
especially Homer and Virgil; we will not dispute the authenticknesse of the
history, but only make use of the morality of it) suddenly, even in one
night, so ruinated and depopulated, that as they sang of it, Seges, nunc, ubi
Trojasuit. And all under the Sinonian deceit, and fraudulent pretense of a holy
(or rather hollow) horse, by Pallas or Pelasgan art and policy built and
brought into the walls of Troy; which in one night, I say, utterly ruinated
that most renowned City, which ten years siege and war before could never
conquer or overcome: So that, seeing the Trojans would not timely listen to
Laocoons counsel or wary watchword, Timeo Danaos and dona ferentes, they were
therefore made a proverb to posterity, by a Sero sapiunt Phryges.

But, what need so far fetched and ancient examples, since we have so many
manifest and remarkable ones of this kind, more modern and nearer home? Whereof
(for brevities sake) I will only instance in two most eminent ones, and most
pertinent to our present purpose; the one out of France, the other out of
Germany: both which being seriously read and ruminated, let the wise reader
rightly judge, and truly tell me, whether our present most renowned and pious
Parliament, both eminent and excellent Lords and Commons, yea and the most
loyal Senate, and City of London too, with them, have not extraordinary need
and great cause to take special care and caution, with all Christian
providentiall wisdom and circumspection, as our good and most wise God (being
first sought unto) shall enable them, how they make a peace, and how far they
will trust and rest on the fairest promises, and profoundest Protestations,
that Princes or Courtiers can make unto them, especially, as I said, being
popishly, or atheistically, and malignantly principled, and in their deepest
and dearest relations and engagements addicted and devoted to Popery, Atheism,
and Malignant, enemies of true piety and honesty.

The first serious example (then) most pregnant to this purpose, shall be that
of Charles the ninth, King of France, Anno 1571 the year of that most
execrable, base and bloody massacre at Paris. Oh the most horrid and hateful,
the most deep and devilish dissimulation of the King, and his (then)
Queenmother, merely and mainly under a color of love and reconcilement to that
most famous Admiral of France (a most wise, magnanimous and pious Protestant,
yea, (under God) the maine pillar and prop of the French Protestants) and by
deepest vows and promises of peace and high privileges and immunities, for
his sake, to all the rest of the protestants in France: And yet all this only
to ensnare and entrap this most renowned Admiral (and with him the rest of the
prime protestant Peers of France) into their pitfall at Paris, there the more
commodiously, (or rather accursedly) to massacre and murder them, (as
afterward they did) in a most barbarous and butcherly manner; but to give you
a few most material particulars for the most full clearing of the thing. Oh
how did this King Charles, at the first, (with most exquisite Machivilian
hypocrisy) bind himself by most deep vows and protestations, yea and
execrations of himself, on the contrary, to give the Admiral full assurance
of his fair and clear intent and resolution to settle and confirm all acts
and edicts, and all desiderable privileges, for the advancement and
confirmation of the league and religion of all his protestant Subjects in
France, backed most firmly (so see to) with the marriage of his daughter to the
young King of Navar, a protestant Prince, and by this means also in a special
manner got the foresaid renowned Admiral, the King of Navarr, the young Prince
of Conde, another Protestant Peer of France, and all or most of the most
eminent protestant Nobility of France, joyfully and unjelously to assemble
together at Paris, (the appointed Theater of the ensuing Tragedy) for the more
solemn celebration of this mischievous marriage; How did the King also at this
time (to take away all jealousies and mistrusts) receive the said Admiral
(being now, by these wiles drawn to Court) with all French complements, and
eve^ extreme demonstrations of love and embracements, yea with large and
liberal recompenses of all the Admirals losses, sustained in his wars, by the
gift of 100000 Frankes; besides the present grant (for one whole year) of all
the revenues which his brother the Cardinal of Chastillon enjoyed, being then
lately deceased in England, gave him a place in his privy Council, advised
with him touching the managing of his greatest wars, then in Flanders, and made
show to be governed by his only advise and counsel; yea, honored him with
the most plausible name of Father, and treated with him so familiarly, that the
popish party began to murmur and say that Charles their King not only favored
that Hugonet, (for so in France they nickname the Protestants, as our
malignants and papists in England call true Christians, Puritans and
Roundheads) but would, they scared, shortly himself also become a Hugonet; yea,
I say, so extraordinarily and so extremely (as I may say) did the King seem,
thus, to hug and honor this most Noble and renowned, grave and godly Admiral,
to free him from all suspicious and relucting jealousies, which sometimes were
put into him, by the advisement of some of his dear and faithful protestant
friends, that (like honest hearted good Gedaliah, touching Ismaels treachery)
he could, now, taste no admonitions, or fear any unfaithfulness, his
honest-meaning spirit was so transported with the Kings counterfeit countenance
and bewitching words. But now see, how (when all things were ripe for the
ensuing wicked work) all those favors and fair word, all K. Charles his
deep vows, promises and protestations proved but so many sugared baits to
swallow down, the smoothlier, the Kings most base and bitter pills of horrid and
inhumane treachery. For, when as, I say, the designed day was now come, and all
things ready for plotted and resolved ruin and destruction; First, this good
aged Admiral securely reading a petition, was suddenly shot at with a
Harguebuse, which instantly took off the forefinger of his right hand, and
sorely wounded his left arm; whereof the King being presently certified by the
King of Navarr and the Prince of Conde, o how he swore and took on, for
seeming sorrow! o how he vowed with most bitter execrations to take such speedy
and severe revenge on the actors of this outrage, as to make his justice
exemplary to all the world, and fully satisfactory to the good Admiral and all
his friend^! Whereupon great search was made, and the Harguebuse found, but the
actor having a brave Spanish gennet at the door below waiting on him, was fled
and gone, and there was all was done. For, all this proved but a preparatory to
a far more bloody Scene and accursed Catastrophe, now instantly intended: for
now, the good Admiral being conveyed into a bedchamber for cure, within a day
or two, at most, after this, the Duke of Guise (by the full consent of King
Charles, the Queen Mother, and others privy to the plot) set strong guards of
Swissers and such like bloody villains about the Admirals lodgings and
bedchamber, whereinto a servant of the said Dukes first boldly enters, and
with a naked Sword runs at the good aged Admiral, as he lay wounded in his
bed, and instantly and desperately thrust him through his body with his Sword,
then doubles the blow on his head, another shoots him into the body with a
pistol, a third sorely wounds him on his legs as he lay, and then they cast
that most Noble and renowned personage dead on the floor, whom living and in
health, the proudest papist in France durst not (in a martial w^y) look in
the face. This done, the devilish Duke of Guise caused his dead body to be
cast out of the window to him, into the street, and those butcherly villains
hurld him down headlong unto him, who having wiped the blood from his
besmeared face, he said, Now I know it is he, and so despightfully spurning him
with his foot, he left him, and then set forward the rest of the murtherous and
massacring work all over Paris: in which interim, they left not this noble
Admiral, thus, but an Italian (of the Duke of Nevers household, one of the
complotters) cut off his head, and instantly carried it to the King and
Queene-Mother, who joyfully causing it to be enbalmed sent it shortly after, as
a choice present to the Pope, for an assurance of the death of his most
capital enemy in France. Nay the rage of these French Romish Tigers rested not
here, but like so many mad-Dogs, the rest of the ignoble rabble ran to his dead
Corpse, and one cuts off his hands, another his privy-members, and for the space
of three days, they dragged his dead carkasle (as the Grecians did Hectors
about the walls of Troy) with all inhumane indignity, through the streets of
Paris, and then hanged up his (thus) poor mangled body, by the heels on a
Gibbet, and ceased not this most horrid and hellish massacre, till they had
most lamentably murdered at least 10000 Protestants, men, women and children
in Paris, besides many thousands more in other parts of France, at the same
time. Yea and yet to add more to all the impiety of this popish (and therefore
faithless) King: He sending, now for the King of Navarr and the Prince of
Conde, gave them both to understand, even from himself, that all this was done
by his own special command, and with all, peremptorily resolved the death of
both these young Princes too, if they on his threats had not (as wretchedly
they did) renounced their religion, turning Romish Catholic (against the light
of their consciences) to save their lives and enjoy their honors. And thus you
have summarily seen the sad effects of this most perfidious princes former
deep vows, promises and protestations; And therefore, let all the World
judge, whether, in this case, that be not most true.

Jurat? Creed minus, non jurat, credere noli;
Jurat, non jurat hostis, ab host cave.
That is;

Does thy foe swear? none of his Oaths believe;
Swears he, or swears he not; fear, he will deceive.
The other example is little inferior to this former, for Popish barbarity,
and perfidious disloyalty, and that was of Ferdinando, late Emperor of
Germany, father of the now present Emperor, which in brief was thus.

After that this Ferdinando had (for his disloyal violation of the Bohemian
Laws and immunities, especially by introducing the Jesuits among them to
tyrannize over their Bodies Estates and Consciences) been deposed and
dispossessed of that Kingdom; (over which, being Electorate, the Nobility and
whole State of Bohemia had chosen him their King) afterward by the unanimous
consent of the said Nobles and Magistrates, the Prince Palatine of the Rhine,
unhappy son in Law to King James of England, was in his stead chosen to be
their King, according to the fundamental Laws and power of that Kingdom: But
not long after it so pleased the Lord (the Almighty and most wise disposer of
all things) that at the great battle fought near Prague by Bucquoy, the said
Emperors Generalissimo, the Palsgrave, the foresaid new elected King of
Bohemia's forces were quite defeated and overthrown by the said Bucquoy; and,
thereby, the famous and ancient City of Prague was reduced by conquest to the
obedience of Ferdinando, this being about 24 or 25 years ago. Now the
Emperor though thus re-estated, by the sword, and in some measure
re-established in the Bohemian throne, yet, in the first place, to weave and
insinuate himself the more into the hearts and affections of the Nobility (for
the more sure and infallible effecting of his secretly intended devilish
design) and the heads of the Inhabitants of that City, which was the
metropolis of that whole Kingdom; he thought it most fit, and accordingly put
in practice with dexterious Machivilian craft and policy, to make most deep
vows, protestations, and promises of full and free pardon and mercy for what
was past, and a fuller fruition and enjoyment of his love and favor and of
their rites and privileges, than ever formerly they had enjoyed from any of
his predecessors: which he accordingly forthwith performed with all present
possible confirmations, and carried himself in a very plausible and exceeding
well pleasing deportment, every way, to them, for the space of above one half
year, at the least. But, at last, about the expiration of a such like distance
of time, the Emperor pretending some important and weighty affairs of the
Kingdom to be consulted of and consented to by him and his whole Nobility, for
the more successful and peaceful settlement of the state of the Kingdom and
their immunities, he summoned them all that were, then, absent from the City,
to make their appearance at Prague, at a day and time prefixed, who (by reason
of the Emperors so fair and friendly carriage to them, all this while, and
there so full and free enjoyment of their promised privileges and lawful
immunities) not suspecting any evil, much less such a bloody Tragedy to be
acted on them, as afterward they found and felt, in obedience to his Imperial
Majesty's command and gratitude for his great favors, they readily and
cheerfully assembled together according to their summons at Prague; where
being met, together with the magistrates of the City, and most kindly saluted
and entertained with all expressions of seeming love and affection, within a
day or two after, they were all by a strong guard of armed soldiers, prepared
and appointed thereunto, unexpectedly brought upon a great stage, privately
built up and prepared for this purpose, where the headsman stood ready; and
they all, thus suddenly ensnared and utterly unarmed, both prime Nobility and
chief Magistrates of this City, who had had a hand in the Emperors former
deposing and expulsion, did every man of them suffer the loss of his life, by
the fury of a treacherous sword; and (which makes the abomination of this
perfidious cruelty and treachery the more odious and execrable) the Emperor
had appointed and placed about 60 D^ummers underneath the stage, who (much like
the cruelty of that tyrannical Emperor Phalaris, with Perillus his roaring
brazen-Bull) should with incessant importunity, beat upon and rattle their
D^ums, during all the time of the Execution, that so the noise, cries or
complaints of all these innocent Nobles and Gentlemen dying on the stage above,
might not be heard or pitied, in their just exclamations of the Machavilian
and most abominable craft and cruelty executed on them. But, in vain did this
faithless Emperor Ferdinando think to keep that from the ears and knowledge
of men which had already with a crying noise (like murdered Abels innocent
blood) reached the ears of the omniscient and bloudavenging God, who soon cut
short the thread of his life, and ever since and before his Death made hiswhole
most unhappy Empire to him and to his bloody Son after him a lamentable
Golgotha and stage of little else but rapine, ruin and destruction. Now, both
these so pregnant presidents and examples, so eminently pertinent to our
present times may be (me thinks) most remarkable Memento's and worthy
warning*peeces to us in England, even to our most renowned Lords and Commons in
Parliament, and to the most loyal and active eminent Citizens of London, to
take special and extraordinary care, and with great wisdom and circumspection
to be very cautious and heedfull what Peace they make, and what vows, promises
and deepest protestations (though backed with ever so heart-amazing curses) and
execrations they trust and rest on, whereof already the rotten-hearted
Royalists and Atheistical crew of impious Oxonian Malignants have not been
wanting, and all in the Kings Name, at least, to cheat, gull, and abuse the
Kingdom and bring our precious Patriots into their base and bloody snares, and
all forsooth under a color and pernicious pretext of Peace and future safety
and security, whereas indeed they intend nothing less, and aim at nothing
more, than the ruin and destruction of their precious Lives and Estates, and
(which is most dear to them, and us all) the extirpation of the true religion.
And so much the rather do I the more seriously desire to press this seasonable
caution, at this time, because, even now already (as indeed it has been the
constant practice of our Oxonian adversaries in all the times of their
pretended Treaties) they apparently show they go but about to cheat and gull
us to our faces, with bare shows and pretenses of peace and all well meaning
toward us, having, indeed, honey and butter (an acknowledgement of our
Parliament at Westminster to be the parliament of England) on the tip of their
Tongues, but gall and wormwood at the root of their hearts: nothing but pence,
pacifications and privileges, at that time, when Branford sorely bleeds,
Bristoll must be betrayed and diverse dangerous Fine-designes are set on foot,
yea, so many and so mischeivous, that they know not which to set upon first,
thus, heretofore and all along. And is it better or is there fairer play above
board, now ad^ies than has been heretofore. If it be so, let Reding,
Lyn-regis, Plymouth, Abington and Dover, at this time witness, even now in the
nick of time of this present pretended, accommodation and treaty of peace
wherein, let all the World judge (with us) if they aim at any thing else, than
gros^y to gull ^s, and (as the sad and bad Catastrophe of all) to get us into
their treacherous trap and pernicious pit-fall, for certain ruin and a
merciless massacre even of all the best and most honest and loyal subjects of
the whole Kingdom; and hereof, truly, we have had, I say, too foul and
frequent experiences, namely, that their dissembled words of peace have ever
done us more mischief than all their sharpest swords of War. And if they have
been thus hot, hasty and foolhardy after the murder and massacring of the
Kingdoms most innocent ones (witness, with the rest, that desperate and most
bloody design of January the fourth 1641 in the house of Commons in
Parliament, countenanced and attempted with our King Charles his own person)
apparently to our faces, even then, and now (though now ada^es more craftily)
when we have power to oppose them. O what may we fear for the future, when they
may have fully or rather foulely and faithlesly got our famous Patriots (by a
fallacious accommodation) into their resistlesse paws and power, as those
forementioned most memorable examples have remarkably manifested, it is possible
may be. Certainly a little length of time is not like to lessen their intestine
malice and malignity, but believe that to be most true which the Poet sung of
Juno, (with a little inversion) Manet alta mente reposita, Invidia Principum.
And let, I say, all popishly and atheistically principled Princes, and their
semblable adherents protest and pretend what they please and what they can, let
us in the strength and wisdom of our God, stand wisely always on our guard,
and still look on them all with just and most jelous vigilance, suspicion and
circumspection, having often in remembrance that pretty and pertinent apology
(which I have read) of the Cat and the Mice, with which I will conclude all I
have h^erin to say, which is thus related. The Cat having along time craftily
preyed upon Mice, the poor creatures, at last, for their safety contained
themselves within their holes; but the Cat finding his prey to cease, as being
too well known to the Mice that he was their inveterate enemy, and a Cat; he
devises this course following, viz. He changes his hue, gets on a
religious habit, shaveth his crown, and walks gravely by the holes: And yet,
perceiving that the Mice still kept their holes, and looking out suspected the
worst, he most formally and fatherly said unto them Quod sueram non sii,
frater, caput asp^ce tonsum; that is, I am not (brothers) as I was want to be,
No more a Cat, my coat and shorncrown see. Hereupon, some of the more credulous
and bold mice among them ventured forth; and were presently snatched up and
devoured: But the rest seeing this, when afterward the Cat came, thus, to
entice them again, to come forth, they would no more adventure out, but when
he called unto them, as before, they kept in and answered, Cor tibi restat
idem, vix tibi praesto sidem. Talk what you can, we will you not believe, you
still retain a Cats heart to deceive. Thus let us (as Solomon advises the
sluggard to learn of the Pismire) learn vigilance of these Mice; And when we
deal with dissemblers (as now we do) let us wisely and warily consider, that
the best, safest and surest way (by Gods blessing and assistance) is, that old
and plain well known rule, fast bind, fast find. Yet, trust and seek God
herein, above all; But, put no confidence in popishly affected Princes or
Machivilianly principled Courtiers or malignants. Now the God of grace and
wisdom make us all wise unto salvation, and give our most honorable and pious
Patriots understanding in all things. Amen and Amen.

Tuta frequensque via est per amici fallere nomen:
Tuta frequensque licet sit via, crim^n habeat. That is
A safe and common way it is through friendship to deceive:
As safe and common as it is, it is knavery by your leave.

FINIS.
