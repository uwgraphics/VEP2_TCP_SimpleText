A Proclamation for the free and safe passage of all Clothes, Goods, Wares, and
Merchandise to Our City of LONDON.
WHereas We have been informed, that diverse of Our loving Subjects, who have
been traveling from Our Western Counties, and other parts of Our Kingdom to
Our City of London with Clothes, Goods, and other Merchandise, have been of
late stopped and interrupted in their Iournies, and other Clothes, Wares, and
Merchandise have been taken or detained from them, whereby the season and
benefit of their Markets have been lost to them, and considering, that if the
same License and Course shall be still taken and held, that the damage and
mischief thereof will not only fall upon Places and Persons disaffected to Us,
but upon very many of Our good and loving Subjects of all parts, and that
thereby the general Trade and Commerce of the Kingdom (which We have always,
and do desire to advance to the utmost of Our Power) will in a short time
decay, and the poor People, wanting work, be brought to Penury and Famine. We
are graciously pleased to declare, and do hereby will and require all the
Officers and Soldiers of Our Army, and all other Our Officers and Ministers
whatsoever, that from henceforth they give no stop or interruption to any of
Our loving Subjects as they travel to Our City of London with any Clothes,
Wares, or other Merchandise, but that they suffer them, and such their Clothes,
Wares, and Merchandise freely and peaceably to pass without any let, trouble,
or molestation whatsoever. And We do hereby promise and assure all Our loving
Subjects, that if they shall henceforth suffer by any Soldiers of Our Army in
this Case, and shall not upon Complaint to the chief Officers of Our Army where
such damage is suffered, receive Justice and Reparation for the damage they
sustain, upon complaint made to Us We will take speedy care for the severe and
exemplary punishment of the Offenders, and for the full satisfaction of the
Parties grieved and injured.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the eight day of December, in the Eighteenth
year of Our Reign.
God save the King.
