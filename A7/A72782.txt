An Act of Common Council, concerning the Preservation and clensing of the
River of Thames, made the eight and twentieth day of September, in the thirtieth
year of our Sovereign Lord King Henry the eight.
WHere by the Statute made in the seven and twentieth year of the Reign of our
Sovereign Lord King Henry the eight, among other for reformation of the
misordering of the River of Thames, by casting in Dung, or other filth, many
great shelues and other risings have been of late grown and made within the
same River: By reason whereof, many great breaches have ensued by occasion
thereof: which of like shall be the occasion of the utter destruction of the
said River, unless that the same Law, be put in due execution, according to
the true intent and meaning thereof.

Wherefore, for a further reformation of the same, and to the intent that the
said good and wholesome Statute may be put in more execution, and better
knowledge of the people: It is enacted by the authority of this Common
Council, that Proclamation may be made within this said City, and the same
to be put in writing, and Tables thereof made and set up in diverse places of
this City, That it shall be lawful to every person or persons, to dig,
carry away, and take away Sand, Gravel, or any Rubbish, Earth, or any thing
lying, or being in any shelue or shelues within the said River of Thames,
without let or interruption of any person or persons, and without any thing
paying for the same: and after that, to sell the same away, or otherwise
occupy or dispose the said Gravel, Sand, or other thing, at their free
liberty and pleasure. And that all Pauiers, Bricklayers, Tilers, Masons, and
all other that shall occupy Sand, or Gravel, shall endeavor themselves, with
all their diligence, to occupy the said Sand or Gravel, and none other,
paying for the same reasonably, as they should and ought to pay for other Sand
or Gravel, dug out of other men's grounds about the said City, which after
is filled again with much filthy things, to the great infection of the
Inhabitants of the said City, and all other repayring to the same. And that
further, humble suite may be made to the Kings Highness, That all persons
having Lands or Tenements along the Riuerside, upon certain pain by his
Highness, and the Lords of his most Honorable Council, to be limited, shall
well and sufficiently repair and maintain, all the Walls and Banks
adjoining to their said Lands, so that the water may not, nor shall break in
upon the same. And the same to be continued, until the time the said noble
River be brought again to his old course and former estate. And that strong
grates of Iron along the said water side, and also by the street side, where
any watercourse is had into the said Thames, be made by the Inhabitants of
every Ward, so along the said Water, as of old time has been accustomed. And
that every grate be in height, four and twenty inches at the least: or more,
as the place shall need: and in breadth one from another, one inch. And the
same to be done with all expedition and speed. And if the Occupiers of the
said Lands and Tenements make default contrary to the ordinance aforesaid: or
else if any person or persons, in great raines or other times, sweep their
soylage or filth of their houses into the Channel and the same after is
conveyed into the Thames, every person so offending, shall forfeite for every
such default twenty pence: and that upon complaint to be made to any Constable
next adjoining to the said place, where any such default shall be found, it
shall be lawful for the said Constable or his sufficient Deputy for the time
being, from time to time to distraine for the same offense. And to retain the
same irreplegiable, and like law to be observed, and kept, and like penalty to
be paid for every person, that burn rushes and straw in their houses, or wash
in the common streets or Lanes, and to be recovered as aforesaid: and the one
moity thereof to be to the Mayor and Commonaltie: and the other moity to be
divided between the said Constable that takes pain, and the party finder of
the said fault. And if the Constable or his Deputy for the time being refuse
to do his duty according to the true meaning of this Act, That then the
Constable or his Deputy, which shall so refuse to do his duty, as aforesaid,
shall forfeit and pay for every time offending, three shillings and four
pence. And the same penalty of the said Constable to be recovered and
obtained by distress irreplegiable, to be taken by any of the Officers of the
Chamber of London, to the use of the Mayor and Commonalty of London.

And further, that no person or persons, having any Wharfe or house by the said
waterside, make not their Laystals nigh to the river aforesaid, except only
the common Laystalles, where the common Rakers of this City use to repose, and
lay all their soylage, to be carried away by them with their Dung-boates. And
that the said Rakers shall lay their said dung, carried in their dung-boats to
such convenient place or places, as shall be appointed by the Lord Mayor of
London for the time being, with the advice of his brethren the Aldermen of the
same, and to none other place or places, upon pain to forfeit for every such
default, five pound to be recovered in any of the Kings Courts within the City
of London, by Bill, Plaint, moytie of debt, or information by any person, that
will or shall pursue for the same: the one moytie thereof to be to the Mayor
and Commonalty of London, and the other moytie to him or them that will or
shall pursue for the same: in which actions or suites, no wager of Law nor
Essoile shall be allowed.

God save the King.
