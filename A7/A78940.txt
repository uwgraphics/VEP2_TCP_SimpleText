HIS MAJESTY'S Most Gracious MESSAGE, MAY the 12th. from HOLDENBY, To the LORDS
and COMMONS in the Parliament of ENGLAND, Assembled at WESTMINSTER,

And the Commissioners of the Parliament of SCOTLAND; With his Answer to the
Propositions.

LONDON, Printed for RICH. ROYSTON. 1647.

His MAJESTY'S most gracious Message from HOLDENBY, May 12. 1647.
C. R.

AS the daily expectation of the coming of the Propositions has made his
Majesty this long time to forbear giving his Answer unto them, so the
appearance of their sending being no more for any thing he can hear, then it
was at his first coming hither, notwithstanding that the Earl of Louderdale
has been at London above these 10 days, (whose not coming was said to be the
only stop) has caused his Majesty thus to anticipate their coming to him,
and yet considering his Condition, that his Servants are denied access to him,
all but very few, and those by appointment, not his own Election, and that it
is declared a crime for any but the Commissioners, or such who are particularly
permitted by them, to converse with his Majesty, or that any Letters should be
given to, or received from him, may he not truly say that he is not in case
fit to make Commissions, or give Answers, since he is not master of those
ordinary Actions which are the undoubted Rights of any freeborn man, how
mean soever his birth be. And certainly, he would still be silent as to this
subject, until his Condition were much mended, did he not prefer such a
right understanding betwixt Him and his Parliaments of both Kingdoms, which
may make a firm and lasting Peace in all. His Dominions, before any particular
of his own or any earthly blessing, and therefore His Majesty has diligently
employed his utmost endeavors for diverse months past, so to inform His
Understanding, and satisfy His Conscience, that he might be able to give such
Answers to the Propositions, as would be most agreeable to His Parliaments, but
He ingeniously professes, that notwithstanding all the pains that He has
taken therein, the nature of some of them appears such unto him, that without
dischiming that Person which God has given him to judge by for the good of Him
and His People, and without putting the greatest violence upon His own
Conscience, He cannot give His consent to all of them, yet His Majesty (that
it may appear to all the World how desirous He is to give full satisfaction)
has thought fit hereby to express His readiness to grant what he may, and
His willingness to receive from them, and that personally if His two Houses at
Westminster shall approve thereof, such further Information in the rest as may
best convince His judgment, and satisfy those doubts which are not yet clear
unto him, desiring them also to consider that if His Majesty intended to wind
himself out of these troubles by indirect means, were it not easy for him
now readily to consent to what has or shall be proposed unto him, and
afterward choose his time to break all, alleging, that forced concessions are
not to be kept, surely he might, and not incur a hard censure from some
indifferent men? But maxims in this kind are not the guides of His Majesty's
actions, for he freely and clearly avows, that he holds it unlawful for any
man, and most base in a King to recede from his promises for having been
obtained by force or under restraint; wherefore his Majesty not only rejecting
those arts which he esteems unworthy of him, but even passing by that which he
might well insist upon as point of honor, in respect of his present condition,
thus answers the first Proposition. That upon his Majesty's coming to London,
he will heartily join in all that shall concern the honor of his two
Kingdoms or the Assembly of the States of Scotland, or of the Commissioners or
Deputies of either Kingdom, particularly in those things which are desired in
that Proposition, upon confidence that all of them respectively with the same
tenderness will look upon those things which concern his Majesty's honor.

In answer to all the Propositions concerning Religion, His Majesty proposes,
that he will confirm the Presbyteriall Government, the Assembly of Divines at
Westminster, and the Directory, for three years, being the time set down by
the two Houses, so that His Majesty and His Household be not hindered from that
form of Gods Service which they formerly had; And also, that a free
consultation and debate be had with the Divines at Westminster (twenty of His
Majesty's nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be determined by His
Majesty and the two Houses, how the Church shall be governed after the said
three years or sooner, if differences may be agreed. Touching the Covenant,
His Majesty is not yet therein satisfied, and desires to respite His
particular answer thereunto until His coming to London, because it being a
matter of conscience he cannot give a resolution therein till he may be
assisted with the advice of some of His own Chaplains, which has hitherto bin
denied Him, and such other Divines as shall be most proper to inform Him
therein; and then He will make clearly appear, both His zeal to the
Protestant profession, and the Union of those two Kingdoms, which he conceives
to be the maine drift of this Covenant. To the 7th and 8th Propositions, His
Majesty will consent, to the 9th His Majesty doubts not but to give good
satisfaction when be shall be particularly informed how the said penalties
shall be levied and disposed of. To the 10th His Majesty's answer is, That he
has been always ready to prevent the practices of Papists, and therefore is
content to pass an Act of Parliament for that purpose; And also, that the
Laws against them be duly executed. His Majesty will give His consent to the
Act for the due observation of the Lords Day, for the suppressing of
Innovations, and those concerning the Preaching of Gods Word, and touching Non
Residence and Pluralities, and His Majesty will yield to, such Act or Acts as
shall be requisite to raise moneys for the payment and satisfying all public
Debts, expecting also that his will be therein included. As to the Proposition
touching the Militia, though his Majesty cannot consent unto it in terminis as
it is proposed, because thereby he conceives, he wholly parts with the power
of the Sword entrusted to him by God and the Laws of the Land, for the
protection and government of his people, thereby at once divesting himself,
and dis-inheriting his Posterity of that right and prerogative of the Crown
which is absolutely necessary to the Kingly Office, and so weaken Monarchy in
this Kingdom, that little more then the name and shadow of it will remain:
yet if it be only security for the preservation of the peace of the Kingdom,
after the unhappy troubles, and the due performance of all the agreements which
are now to be concluded (which is desired) which his Majesty always
understood to be the case, and hopes that herein he is not mistaken, his
Majesty will give abundant satisfaction, to which end he is willing by Act of
Parliament, That the whole power of the Militia, both by Sea and Land for the
space of ten years be in the hands of such persons as the two Houses shall
nominate, giving them power during the said term to change the said persons,
and substitute others in their places at pleasure, and afterward to return to
the proper channel again, as it was in the times of Queen Elizabeth and King
James of blessed memory. And now his Majesty conjures his two Houses of
Parliament, as they are Englishmen and lovers of Peace, by the duty they owe
to his Majesty their King, and by the bowels of compassion they have to their
fellow Subjects, that they will accept of this his Majesty's offer, whereby the
joyful news of Peace maybe restored to this languishing Kingdom, his
Majesty will grant the like to the Kingdom of Scotland if it be desired, and
to agree to all things that are propounded touching the conserving of peace
betwixt the two Kingdoms.

Touching Ireland, other things being agreed, His Majesty will give
satisfaction therein. As to the mutual Declarations proposed to be established
in both Kingdoms by Act of Parliament, And the Modifications, Qualifications,
and Branches which follow in the Propositions, His Majesty only professes,
that He does not sufficiently understand, nor is able to reconcile many things
contained in them; but this He well knows, That a general Act of Oblivion is
the best Bond of Peace; and that after intestine Troubles, the wisdom of this
and other Kingdoms has usually and happily in all ages granted general
Pardons, whereby the numerous discontentments of many Persons and Families
otherwise exposed to ruin, might not become fuel to new disorders, or feeds
to future troubles. His Majesty therefore desires, that his two Houses of
Parliament would seriously descend into these considerations, and likewise
tenderly look upon his Condition herein, and the perpetual dishonor that must
cleave to him, if He shall thus abandon so many persons of Condition and
Fortune that have engaged themselves with and for Him, out of a sense of Duty,
and propounds as a very acceptable testimony of their affection to him, That a
general Act of Oblivion and free Pardon be forthwith passed by Act of
Parliament. Touching the now great Seal, His Majesty is very willing to
confirm both it and all the Acts done by virtue thereof until this present
time, so that it be not thereby pressed to make void those Acts of his done by
virtue of his great Seal, which in honor and justice he is obliged to
maintain; And that the future Government thereof may be in his Majesty,
according to the due course of Law. Concerning the Officers mentioned in the
19. Article, His Majesty when he shall come to Westminster will gratify his
Parliament all that possibly he may, without destroying the alterations which
are necessary for the Crown. His Majesty will willingly consent to the Act for
the confirmation of the Privileges and Customs of the City of London, and all
that is mentioned in the Propositions for their particular advantage. And now
that His Majesty has thus far endeavored to comply with the desires of his
two Houses of Parliament, to the end that this agreement may be firm and
lasting, without the least face or question of restraint to blemish the same,
his Majesty earnestly desires presently to be admitted to his Parliament at
Westminster, with that Honor which is due to their Sovereign, there solemnly
to confirm the same, and legally to pass the Acts before mentioned, and to
give and receive as well satisfaction in all the remaining particulars, as
likewise such other pledges of mutual love, trust, and confidence as shall
most concern the good of him, and his people; upon which happy agreement, his
Majesty will dispatch his Directions to the Prince his Son, to return
immediately to him, and will undertake for his ready obedience thereunto.

For the Speaker of the Lords House (pro tempore) to be communicated to the
Lords and Commons in the Parliament of England at Westminster, and the
Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland.

FINIS.
