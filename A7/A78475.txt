Certain Motives, Provocations and Reasons to encite to the present Speedy
taking and applying the Medicine to cure Englands Insensible consumption by
Farthing Tokens.
The Medicine it self follows.

AN exhortation to all them that do approve of my way, to ease the grievance
by Farthing Tokens; to be both certain, easy, and cheap, and in every Trades
own power amongst your selves to effect it, without troubling the Parliament,
disobeying his Majesty's Proclamation, harming your neighbors, or hindering the
poor; but much conducing to the good of you all. in showing your selves
obedient to his Majesty's Proclamations: I do now entreat your help in the
prosecution hereof. And for the furher enciting you hereunto, I entreat you to
consider the unthought on loss that is upon the Subjects by Tokens, against
his Majesty's intent in his Proclamation, wherein he only desires your ease
and benefit by Tokens. Secondly, How every one that takes or pays them under
21 for 20, is guilty of doing much more wrong to his Majesty, the Kingdom, to
posterity, and neighbors then either the Patentees or Token-house do: For
indeed, they having a Lease for which they pay yearly Rent, do but as others
do, making the most of their Commodities; and when men speak to them of the
wrong by Tokens, they say men may let them alone, for they desire none to fetch
them out but for their necessary exchange: but the fault indeed is in almost
all Subjects in general, but most especially in all Tradesmen; for indeed I
know not how they can clear themselves from being either willingly or
ignorantly Thieves to the Kingdom, or at lest Receivers; and we use to say,
The Receiver is as bad as the Thief: but herein they are worse (although
honester men in themselves) then the Thieves, for the Thieves gain by the
evil of their practice, and make themselves more able to lend to the King and
Parliament, and give to the poor, but the receivers and dispersers to others
make themselves and others more unable for all these. Again, whereas other
Thieves rob particular persons, these rob the King and all good Subjects; for
the wealth of a King is in the wealth and abundance of his Subjects. And for a
further motive, consider how much this practice tends to the ruin of the
Kingdom, til (if not some way prevented) your Silver will be turned into
Copper, or into nothing; but the most of it will be consumed into nothing: for
if you did but consider it, you should find that so many Tokens as you take in
one week, so many you lose outright every one and twenty weeks, or else you
wrong your neighbors, by causing them against their wills, and his Majesty's
Proclamation, to take them, and so you do not as you would be done unto, which
should be our Rule. Consider again, how that they which let them lie by them,
and do not weekly exchange them, do cause the greater loss at last; for the
poor Patentees are loath (against their gain) to let any go away without
Tokens for their money, and therefore your not supplying them with your store
weekly causes them still to make more, which will increase your loss in
general when they fall, which of necessity they must one day do. Consider, by
relation there are now abroad about two hundred thousand pounds in Tokens, do
any think they can change them all? yet your keeping so many by you cause them
to have custom yet for more; and by relation they do make after the rate of
26000 pounds a year: if but 20, consider first the two hundred thousand pounds
worth made, will by a weekly exchange be twice so much loss, and upwards,
every year, and yet the same Tokens remain for the like loss the next year,
which is above four hundred thousand pounds loss in the year, beside the
twenty thousand a year made, which add forty thousand a year to the loss,
beside the loss of all at last, when they fall, for then they will be but
Copper shruf. Again consider, the longer you drive off the preventing of this
loss, the greater the loss will be, seeing every year does add to the
increase of your loss forty thousand pounds, so that if this year the loss
be four hundred thousand pounds, the next will be four hundred and forty
thousands; the next, four hundred and eighty thousands; the next, five hundred
and 20 thousands, till all your Silver be consumed and become Copper shruf.
Again, consider that the poor Tradesmen that lose but twelve pence a week,
it is more to them then twenty shillings a week to rich men; and fifty
shillings a year would pay a poor man's house rent, and they especially are
they that are constrained to take Tokens. I heard one say, seeming to have good
store of money in her bag that it was all Tokens: Another, that his Wife took
but ten shillings, and 7 of it was Tokens: All which this course will soon
prevent or put an end to, if you set upon it, and will make that there will
never any desire a Token Patent more, and the Tokens now made will be necessary
change for you and posterity after you; and so howsoever. these will be no
loss to any, and any Neighbor or Tradesman may let any country body have
Tokens as cheap as the Token-house, although they buy but five penny worth at
once, and be no losers, and who then will go to the Token-house for any; and
the poor, that sell them to Gentlemen, may have them of Brewers, and other
great Tradesmen, as cheap as at the Token-house, and yet without loss to the
Tradesmen or themselves. By this course how soon will our grievance be our
benefit, for the Country throughout will have them for necessary exchange,
when they koow the future loss, as also the increase of them is prevented. And
whereas now the Token-house will change them but one part of the day, they will
then have more leisure then lift to take them in both forenoone and afternoon.
And further consider, if you do not ease this grievance, having this light
into the way of it, and power in your hands to do it, seeing it is good to
all, if afterward the poor be undone with the downfall of them, which will of
necessity be either sooner or later, how shall you have besides your own loss
the just curse of the poor, that will be quite undone thereby, because you
would not prevent their ruin at so cheap a rate; especially seeing they that
take Tokens as they are now taken, do wrong themselves, and disobey the King;
and they that pay them so, do wrong their Neighbors, and cause them to wrong
others by their example. Consider how that ignorantly we have been worse
thieves then the Token-house, for they by putting out more then they take in
get out of the Kingdom but eighteen or nineteen shillings in the pound, for
which they do the Kingdom service, and never get more out of the same Tokens
though they exchange them never so often; but we in an ordinary course as we
have taken them, if we return them weekly (as we ought to do) do insensibly
rob the Kingdom by every twenty shillings about eight or nine and forty
shillings a year, and as much by the same the next year, and every year as
long as they last as much: for so many as a man takes in one week so many he
loses outright in 21 weeks, and as many more in 21 weeks more.

But some rich men and others may say, they never lost by Tokens, therefore
they will not meddle in this work to have ought to do with it.

Consider (I beseech you) if it be not all one as if London should say the
Cavaleers never plundered us, therefore we will not prevent their entering the
City:or seeing some Neighbors houses burned down, and others on fire, should
say, because it has not burned their houses they will not endeavor the
quenching thereof. But whereas rich men, that trade not in small things, think
they lose nothing. I think they especially are like to lose the most, although
they feel it least; for when thousands of poor Tradesmen are undone quite,
no one of them can lose much, because they have very little of their own to
lose, but the special loss will be their Landlords and Creditors, whose
houses and goods are in their possession; who also after this must help to
relieve those poor and their families.

But some may say, the Token-house will deliver 22 for 20 if we take this
course, for they stand them in little.

I answer, so they would soon undo themselves, for then they would soon
have store of Customers that would take out 22 for 20, and presently take out
twelve pence and send them again, and enforce them (as they are bound by their
Patent) to give them twenty shillings in silver for 21 of the 22 shillings they
had of them. But farther, to the end the benefit of Tokens might redound to the
good of the whole Kingdom, it were desirable that the Soldiers had a good
part of their pay of them, twenty one for twenty, I conceive they would be
profitable for them, and also for those-parts of the Kingdom that having
formerly been abused with Tokens, do now refuse to take them for exchange, who
if they hear of this course taken, to ease the grievance, and prevent the
increase of them, they will be glad of them for exchange; and so they shall
have exchange, and the City shall be eased of her burden.

And whereas some say, they like the practice well, and it is a certain good
way, but they are loath to have a hand in it because the Parliament takes the
rent of the Token-house for the Kingdoms occasion.

I answer, shall we have such mean low thoughts of that honorable Assembly,
to conceive that they should not make their bargain sure for their rent: but
if not, that they should in the least desire that the Token-house rent of three
or four thousand pounds a year should be paid with the Kingdoms loss of as
many hundred thousands a year and upwards and mean Tradesmen to be deepest
sharers therein.

Other things I could mind you of concerning the Tokens, which are not
convenient at present; but with the help of God I hope I shall thankfully and
satisfactorily answer any man's objection against any thing in this paper or
heretofore written by me concerning Tokens. Thus entreating your acceptance
and furtherance I rest.

Your poor Servant
