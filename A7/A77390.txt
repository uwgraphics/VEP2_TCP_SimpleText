THat the Pope of Rome has for some Ages last past pretended ^a Sovereign
Right over Christian Kings and Princes, cannot be unknown to any, who are
acquainted with the writings of their most approved Authors, the Decrees of
their councils, or the Instances of such u^ped authority recorded in Histo^ for
these Five Hundred years. The judgment of their Licenced Au^ors, their
Councils, and their Laws (...) this Case, is excellently published by the
Learned Pen of the Right Re^rend Bishop of Lincoln; and that the (...) me
Doctrine has been by them generally received, I can bring no greater proofs,
than their common practice recorded in History. How many Em^rours, Kings, and
Sovereign Prin^ have been de Facto deposed by them, ^w many great Maslacres and
private Murders have been Encouraged and Defended, how many Tortures, and
unheard of Cruelties, how any Treasons, and Damnable Con^acies to the
subversion of whole kingdoms, have been contrived, and ^me executed by Jesuits,
and other ^issaries of Rome, would require a large Volumn to relate; I shall
refer the Reader to a few Authors, for his abundant satisfaction herein.
Thuanus, a (...)
Bodinus, and the Exact Collections of b (...)
Mr. Fowlis. Nor was there any place felt the weight of (...) Popes Iron Rod
more grievous ^n the Kingdom of England; hence (...) he wont to exact vast
sums of ^ney, which were as readily paid: (...) of what esteem it was with
him, (...) may gather from the Character he gives, when he calls it (...) Inno^
Anne
Puteus inexhaustus. And from the time it has pleased God to set us at liberty
from their yoke and burden which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear,
what Damning Censures and Violent Excommunications have been sent out against
us, what Secret and Horrible Plots have been contrived to destroy our Kings and
Kingdoms, I hope will never be forgot: and all this not so much to reestablish
here the Religion, as the Authority which the Pope has lost: and the right of
that Title which he claims to this Kingdom, he thinks equal to that pretended
from Constantin's Donation. And to this purpose his Sub-Collector c (...)
Polidore Virgil tells us, that Ina was the first King who made this Kingdom of
England Tributary to the Pope: But he forgets himself page 740. where he says
Peter. pence was given Pietatis and Religionis Causa, for Gods sake, and
therefore not by way of Homage and Subjection. This Gift was continued by Offa,
Atulphus, Canutus, and Edward the Confessor, who calls it the (...)
Kings Alms. William the Conqueror allows this gift, but renounceth all
Obedience to the Pope, as appears by Lanfranks Epist. d (...)
Pope Pascal 2. in a Letter to Hen. 1. calls this Donation Beati Petri
Eleemosyna, and c (...)
Bishop Andrews tells us, that it was an Alms given to a Hospital at Rome,
where they used to entertain Pilgrims out of England.

The Second pretended Title is from King John's Resignation of the Crown to
Pandulphus the Popes Legate, and receiving it again under Fealty, and Homage,
and at the yearly Tribute of a Thousand Marks. Which Title upon several
accounts will appear invalid. First as to matter of Fact; Sir Thomas Moor, who
could not want all advantages of informing himself in affairs of this nature,
denies it, his words are these; Some Writers say, that King John made England
and Ireland Tributary to the Pope, by the grant of a thousand Marks; we dare
surely say again, that this is untrue, and that all Rome neither can show such
a grant, nor ever could, and if they could, it were right naught worth: For
never could any King of England give away the Realm to the Pope, or make the
Land Tributary if he would, nor no such money is there paid, nor never was.
These are the words of that great Statesman, who was no enemy to the Popes
Authority. But granting there was something done to this purpose, in the
presence of a few Peers, and without the Consent of Any, as Mat. Paris a Monk
of Saint Albans, who lived at that time, acquaints us; I shall take my Second
Argument to invallidate this Title, from the words of Sir Thomas Moor before
cited: for if they could at Rome show any such grant, yet it were right naught
worth: for never any King of England could give away the Realm to the Pope, nor
make the Land Tributary if he would. And herein agree the Learned Grotius,
Bodinus, and other Lawyers: and the Barons of this Realm were obliged by their
Oaths, (g) Lambers Apx. p. 170. lib. 50: de obsequis (...) Regem lege 59. p.
171.
Terras and honores Regis omni fidelitate ubique servare cum eo, and contra
inimicos and alienigenas defendere, To preserve together with the King the
Territories and Honor of the King, and to defend them against their Enemies and
Forraigners. And here with agrees the Command which the Conqueror laid upon all
the Commons; Firmiter pracipimus ut omnes liberi homines totius Regni praedicti
sint fratres jurati ad Monarchiam nostram pro viribus suis and facultatibus,
contra inimicos pro posse sue defendendum, and viriliter servandum. i. e. We
strictly Charge and Command, that all Freeholders in all parts of our Kingdom
shall be sworn Brethren, Sworn to defend our Monarchy with their Persons and
Estates, to the utmost of their ability, and manfully to preserve it: by which
it appears that the Commons were as well as the Lords bound to defend their
Country against Usurpations and Invasions; and we doubt not but the same
English courage is to be found amongst their posterity, which we find (h) Co^.
Postbum. page 348. which (...) quoteth e lib. Sancti Albani fol. 207.
Recorded about the 44. year of Henry the third. For when Pope Alexander the
Fourth demanded a revocation of Adomar Bishop of Winchester, because he was a
Churchman, as was urged, and not subject to lay Censures, who had been
Banished by the joint consent of the King, Lords, and Commons, for his
intolerable Insolence, the Commons gave this resolute answer to the Popes
demand, Peter de Monford being Prolocutor; Si Dominus Rex and Regni Majores hoc
vellent, (meaning Adomar's revocation from Banishment,) COMMVNITAS tamen ipstus
ingressum in Angliam jam nullatenus sustineret. Though the King, and Peers of
the Realm should declare for his return, yet the Commons would by no means
endure it. Lastly no man can confer a greater Right upon another, than what is
in himself; and that King John was an Usurper, is evident from all Histories of
that Age; for Arthur of Britain, his Elder Brothers Son, was Thirteen years of
Age, when John invaded the Throne, but fearing that he might not be long quiet
in his Possession, whilst the Right Heir was alive, he Murdered his Nephew, and
imprisoned his Neice Elianor, who survived him; and this does utterly make void
his Right to dispose of what he had not right to keep. And of what small
account was this pretended Title, not only the Resolution; of the Commons before
mentioned, but also this Letter Subscribed by all the Peers of England will
abundantly manifest.

THe Reader may please to take notice, that the Exemplar whence this was taken
is in Corpus Christi College Library in Oxon, and Recorded by Mat.
Westminster, and Walsingham, and mentioned by Parsons in his answer to the Lord
Chief Justice Coks Reports, but without any Reply, page 266. cap. 11. and
whereas in that the Names round the Arms are in an ancient English letter, the
Graver being unacquainted with the Character, for his own ease, and more
convenient Reading, has put them in the Modern.
