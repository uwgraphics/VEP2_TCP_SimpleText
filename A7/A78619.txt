THE ACCVSATION Given by His MAJESTY Against the Lord Wilmot:

TOGETHER With the Lord Wilmots Declaration of his innocence.

ALSO A Petition of the Officers of the old Horse to his Majesty, in behalf of
the Lord VVilmot: With his Majesty's Answer thereunto.

By which it is most evident, that the Lord Wilmot is in great danger of losing
his head, (if he has not lost it already, as some affirm) for being a suitor
to his Majesty for Peace; and for being averse to the proceedings of Prince
Rupert, showing a just dislike that he, being the grand favourer of the Irish
Rebels should be so much countenanc^^ and entrusted by his Majesty with so
great a power.

Published according to Order.

LONDON, Printed by Francis Leach, August 30 1644.

The humble Petition of your Majesty's old Officers of Horse;
Humbly shows,
THat whereas they have had the honor to serve your Majesty under the command
of the Lord Wilmot, of whose just and loyal intentions they conceive they have
had some demonstrations; but now to their great amazement, and almost
distraction, find him fallen into your Majesty's displeasure and suspicion:
And although they intend not to arrogate unto themselves a liberty of searching
into your Majesty's designs, nor disputing your commands, yet they most humbly
beg pardon, if they believe it a right they owe themselves and your Majesty's
service, to request they may receive some present light of this business from
your Majesty, that they may not have reason to suspect themselves partakers of
his crimes, having bin by your Majesty's order exequutors of his commands. And
we hope for such a satisfaction from your Majesty's Justice in this particular
as may encourage your Petitioners to go on with the same zeal to your service,
as they have hitherto expressed in the hazard of their lives and fortunes, and
in their prayers for your prosperity, which shall ever be continued by

Your Majesty's most humble etc.

Our Answer to the humble Petition of the Officers of the old borse, concerning
the Lord Wilmot, presented to Us August 8. 1644.
CHARLES REX.

We have considered of your Petition, and receive it as a thing well becoming
you, to express unto Us a sense of the misfortune of a person, who has so
long commanded you as the Lord Wilmot has done, in so eminene a charge as that
of Lievrenant general of Horse; since We assure you the occasion We had to set
so great a Mark of Our displeasure, upon one so highly trusted and favored by
Us, is an affection to Our self not inferior to the greatest which his best
friends can conceive by the effect of it: And We shall expect that you will be
kind unto Us, in your b^l^efe either of Our Justice, or prudent care at least
of Our own interests, as to be consident of that at this season, when the
cheerfulness and unanimity in Our service, wherewith all of you have hitherto
so eminently obliged your King, is so much more necessary then it has bin at
any time, We should not have done an act that might hazard the discontenting
many, had We not been forced unto it by the assurance that it was absolutely
necessary to the preservation of Us all. And though in such eases, wherein a
Crown lies at the stake upon the decision of battle, a small suspi^ion is
ground enough for a Prince to remove any person, but doubted for such a trust,
whereby he had power so easily to destroy all; yet so desirous are We to give
full satisfaction unto you, whose merit of Us has bin such, that We must ever
profess, no King did ever owe more to Gentlemen and Officers, that We thought
fit hereunto to annex a Declaration of the causes of the Lord Wilmots removal
from that trust: being only sorry for this, ^h^t we (urged by your desires)
publish more perhaps then ever We intended, of the unfaithfulness and
ingratitude of a person, whom we had not only trusted so long and so far, but
also so highly, and so many several ways obliged, that it is a great
improvement of grief and trouble to Us, that when it shall please God by your
means to restore Us to Our Rights, We can scarce ever hope for power to do
proportionably to the rest of you.

Given at our Court at Buconock Aug 12. 1644.
THat the Lord Viscount Wilmot has endeavored principally these three months
last past to possess the officers of his Majesty's Army with disvalue and
contempt of his Majesty's person, and with prejudice against the sincerity of
his intentions for the good of his people, and endeavored (as far as in him
lay) to draw men to revolt from their allegiance. And particularly, has used
discourses and persuasions to this effect, and to persons of change, power, and
credit in the Army, That the King he saw would put all the power into his
Nephews hands, that rather then suffer it they should (for his part he would)
make him submit to his Parliament. And to others to this effect, That the King
was afraid of peace; That he was not a man ever to go through this business:
That there was no way but one, which was, to set up the Prince, who had had no
share in the cause of these troubles, and that he would declare against those
about his Father, wherein all honest men would stick unto him, and put an end
to all. That the said Lord Viscount VVilmot has without his Majesty's
knowledge sent secret messengers of dangerous nature unto the Earl of Essex:
particularly, it being resolved by his Majesty, that a private message should
be sent unto the Earl of Essex from a person of honor, to whom the said Earl
professes respect, invi^ing him to send two persons of most trust with him to
meet and confer with the said persons of honor, and another, of whom the
said Earl was believed to have a good opinion: and the instructions unto the
mess^nger (one who had free access unto the Earl of Essex) being punctually
drawn at a private Counsel at the which the Lord VVilmott was present, with
precise directions, that the messenger should know no more the business, or
deliver any things concerning the public, but what was set down by unanimous
consent at the Counsel and attested by the Secretaries of Sat, the said L.
VVilmot notwithstanding desired the said Messenger to commend him kindly to the
E. of Essex and tell him from him he had many good friends in the Army, that he
should lay hold of this opportunity, and that then they would show themselves,
and that the Court should not have power to hinder it or carry it as they have
don, or words to this effect by which secret Message from him being Leiutenant
General of his Majesty's Horse unto the General of the Rebels Army, he did
not only forfeit his duty and allegiance, but has by giving the E. of Essex
such assurances, though most false of a party in his Majesty's Army and of such
division betwixt that and the Court been probably the cause of that insolent
return, which the said Earl has made unto his Majesty's most gracious Letter
which he vouchsafed to write him with his own hand, to invite him to peace,
and so frustrated the great hope which his Majesty had raised to himself by
such a letter, of saving the further effusion of blood, and prouring the
happiest accomoda ion: whereof had there been the least hope left, his Majesty
has declared that he would have connived at these, yea, if possible at greater
Crimes.

An Answer to A Declaration and Charge against the Lord VVllmotte.
I doubt not but my actions, and the loss of what I have in his Majesty's
service, might satisfy the world of my integrity and respect to his Majesty's
person and dignity, If I should only insist upon that; but since my accusers
intend to prove the contraty by the Averment of persons of Charge, Power, and
Credit in the Army, I am confident it is a right I owe my own Innocence, and
Civility to men of their quality, wholly and absolutely to refer my self to
the Justice and Integrity of their Testimonies without endeavoring to assure
the world from my self, of my own Innocence: Though I doubt whenever it
shall please the King to call me to my public trial, which I am promised
will be speedily, I shall be able to make that appear with as much clearness
to the whole world, as I now find in the private* satisfaction of my own
Conscience. But since some persons have thought fit to intrest themselves in my
Justification, I conceive my self obliged to satisfy their desires in this
general account, for the present, I must in the first place rejoice with them,
that the malice it self of my Accusers can suggest nothing of practice to me,
the height of my pretended of, fences, were they confessed by me, or proved by
them, reach no further then words, though of such nature, as are as
disagreeable to my Loyalty and duty, as they were always distant either from
my intentions or expressions. Till my adversaries fin de our away to make good,
as barely to accuse: I must require from the Justice of all persons, since my
actions have in all points fully contradicted these pretended accusations, a
suspension of judgment: and desire they would not put the forged suggestions of
my enmies, in equal balance to the endeavors of my whole life, and after
hazard of it (if his Majesty had thought sit;) he might have found would have
been still continued, in as full and faithful a degree in his Majesty's
service as ever, the truth is, my affection has always inclined to peace: But
I take God to witness, such a one as might have agreed with the honor of the
King, and the happiness of the Country, and though my intentions are not to
recriminate yet in order of my own justification and acquitment, I must take
leave to say, I do more then fear it agrees not with the interest and
inclinations of some persons so fully as I could wish, which I take to be the
principal cause of my present condition, but I have only undertaken to clear
my self, may each man's particular faults light on his own head whosoever
shall abstract the substance from the Copiousnesse and subtle Aggravations of
Language, I am confident will find what ever dress they may be able to put
upon the ground work of their accusations to be barely nothing but a too
violent expressing my Inclinations to Peace, whether I have ever sought it
further then my Alleagiance and duty to his Majesty allowed of, Or my
obligation to my Country, might exact from me. I must refer to my public
answer, in the mean time I desire and doubt not, but that all good men will
be satisfied with this profession and Protestation, that I never had a private
Treaty, nor ever speak any thing to the prejudice of the public Cause, yet
if there could be a means found out to reconcile the just intrest of the King
and Kingdom, such as becomes an honest and well affected man to appear in, I
am sure I should be very forward to engage all my assistance, and shall think
it an action may very well be Justified to God my King, and all honest men in
which resol^^^on I intend to live and dye.

FINIS.
