If Old Age ben't crept too far on;

Take but the Measures which I shall here give you,
I have Rare Medicines will never deceive you,
For I have studdy'd Copulation.
Above this Sixty Years in this Nation.
[2]
Young brisk Wives who never have Lain-in
Who of Wedlock are Complaining,
And at Christ'nings tell your Neighbor,
How sparing your Spouse is of his Labor:
Let it proceed from what Causes soever,
Suffer me but to use my Endeavor;
Take a Dose of my Elixir,
And I am certain, 'tw;ll do the Trick Sir.
[3]
You in your Neighbors Houses,
Swear the Fault to be your Spouses,
If too weak we^ll make him stronger,
If he is too short we'll make him longer:
Let him o serve the Directions I Will give him,
Of all Impediments I Will relieve him,
To a Shilling I Will hold Twenty,
Next merry Bout he does content ye.

If your Husbands O^d and Crazy,
Or if Young, and grown too lazy,
I^ll renew their Strength or Beauty,
And make them able to do their Duty
Of their forbearance I quickly would ease you
They every Ni^ht should take pain^ to please you:
My Receipt should I but (...) it,
You would be satisfied I c^^^ld d^ it

Barren Wive^ let me beseech you,
If you want or covet Issue,
Make to me your Application,
I Will assist you in Pro^reation,

Closely embracing (...) Mag-Mallion,
Lest that these Directions fail you.
In the Mint they would better tell you.
