I Smell a Rat.
To the tune of, Upon a Summer tide. OR, The Seminary Priest.


I Traueld far to find
where honesty abides,
And found in England more
then all the world besides;
But where true virtue grows,
vice quickly ruins that:
A poor man must not speak,
although he Smell a Rat.
When Justice has her sight,
she is beautiful in show:
But when she Masks her face,
how vild she soon does grow;
I do perceive the cause,
but dare not speak of that:
I Will not offend the Laws,
but yet I Smell a Rat.
When I see welthy men,
by worldly causes rise:
I count them happy here,
and truly worldly wise;
But Folly often makes lean,
what Wit has long kept fat:
Who knows how rich men fall?
in troth I Smell a Rat.
Some gathers in their rents,
and hordes the coin with care:
Stretching their credits great,
for money or for ware:
When such great men do break,
what is the cause of that?
In troth I dare not speak,
and yet I Smell a Rat.
To see a Courtier kind,
is common every hour,
To Widow, Wife, or Maid,
or any in his power:
The Husband's welcome to,
but what is the cause of that?
I do not justly know,
but yet I smell a Rat.
When luber marries wealth,
how joy full are the twain,
On both sides wealths increase
comes in with ill got gain:
This wealth commands their minds,
they live like Dog and Cat;
What should the occasion be?
in faith I Smell a Rat.
When rates of all things rise,
within a plentious year:
What should the occasion be,
that every thing's so dear;
Some censure rich men's faults,
and some say this and that:
Let al say what they will,
for faith I Smell a Rat.
When Age does marry Youth,
how lovingly they live:
The want of youthful blood,
this tender Wife does grieve:
The old man jealous grows,
occasion often bids that:
When wealth and beauty meet,
in faith I Smell a Rat.
The second Part,
To the same Tune.


Wherefore does women paint
or youngmen pruine their hair?
It may be it is to make,
this earthly carkase fair;
Yet there are causes great,
are ten times worse then that:
It Is beauty tempes the eye,
in faith I Smell a Rat.
When Strumpets strive by Art,
and fond enticing strains,
To bring poor youth to spend
both substance, strength, and veins:
What sickness follows lust?
what poverty brings that?
I have no cause to know,
but yet I Smell a Rat.
When guls and gooscaps find,
the vildnes of expense:
How penitent their mind,
will grow for that offense:
But folly to such men,
does show them what is what:
I speak not all I know,
but still I Smell a Rat.
To see a Whore fall sick,
why it is a common thing:
A Hakney soon will tire,
does too much burden bring:
Beside, an inward grief
may be the cause of that,
Let Surgions lend relief:
for faith I Smell a Rat.
When Seigneur Roman T,
did go upright and straight:
He crumples in the hames,
so great's his bodies weight:
Nay stradles twice as wide,
what is the cause of that?
There Is something bars his stride
in troth I Smell a Rat.
Why grows your Bawds so big,
when Panders prove so lean:
When they were young they sweld
and nere will fall again:
The Panders swift on foot,
and so keeps down his fat,
By bringing some vnto't:
in troth I Smell a Rat.
When Officers let slip
to punish such as these:
Pray where does Justice sit,
or railes she when she please:
It may be she is bribed,
and so kept blind by that:
Else none of these could thrive,
in troth I Smell a Rat.
When sin strives to surcease,
and folly flies away:
Where love and lasting peace,
will make a glorious day:
When England harboures none,
that bears the name of Whore,
The Rat will run away,
and I shall Smell no more.
FINIS.
