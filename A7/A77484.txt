A SCOTCH ANTIDOTE Against The English Infection OF ARMINIANISM.

Which little Book may be (through Gods blessing) very useful to preserve those
that are yet sound in the faith, from the Infection OF Mr JOHN GOODWIN'S Great
Book.

BY ROBERT BAILIE, Minister of the Gospel at Glasgow.

London, Printed for Samuel Gellibrand, at the Ball in Paul's Churchyard. 1652.

To the Aequitable READER.
THe shortness of the following Treatise admits not long prefacing: It has
been much wished and long expected from the learned Divines of this land, that a
plain and short Manual of the chief controversies should have been published,
whereby the people might be forearmed against the invasion of seducing spirits
which every where are but two frequent. Long ago two much stuff of this kind
is provided for Scholars, These have but too many and too big Volumes of
controversies always at their hand; but our people are not so furnished either
with sword or buckler as need were, which makes them to their shame and grief,
when they run counter with adversaries (which they cannot choose but often to do)
lie open to wounds: The children of this world are in this, as in many other
things, wiser than the children of light: the Jesuits let not their Proselites
have any lack of their Encheiridia, their Vade mecum, their little pocket Books
of controversy, to enable them both to strike and keep, when they meet with
our people.

These years bygone too much time has been lost among us on Ceremonies and
Disciplinary Questions. It has bin the policy of Satan to hold us intent, and
busy on these out-sconces, that so the main fortresses of Antichrist should
stand safe without assault. Would to God that our too too long and hot
skirmishes about purging of the ditches of Bishops, and Ceremonies, had not
cast open at our backs the gates of our great Towers, and given opportunity to
our Enemy to undermine the very foundations of our Church.

Of all the Errors which in too great a number do corrupt England this day,
these which are called after the infamous name of Arminius, are the most
prevalent. While therefore the Learned may be pleased to demit themselves for
the good of the people, while some gracious Divine may be moved to take leisure
for the publishing of some short and plain System of all, or of the most
material controversies, it were good that some little thing were done in this
beginning of our glorious Liberty from Oppressions, for the arming of the godly
against the errors of Arminius, which so malepertly these bygone years have
been blown abroad, and the opposition thereto has been so strictly discharged,
and so severely punished: while a better comes, the subsequent Treatise will
serve somewhat for that end. Of its worthlet every man pronounce according as
he finds. In its first birth it was a Speech delivered upon a short warning in
the general Assembly of Glasgow, and there not mislik't. Since that time it
has not increased much in stature. If the feature of it please any intelligent
eye, it is easy in a few nights for any to make the members of it grow so
great and long as you will: but it is the Authors opinion, that treatises
intended to thefore-named ends are the more handsome and serviceable, the more
short and simple they be; and the more unprofitable and unpleasant, the more
accurate and long: However, such as it is, enjoy it who will, misregard it who
please.

An Antidote against AMINIANISM.
ARmintus was a late Preacher of Holland, Who Arminius was
minister first at Amsterdam, and then professor of Divinity at Leiden, a man
of very great ingine; in his outward conversation almost unblameable; but much
given to Innovation and self conceit. The Novelties which mainly he loved were
diverse errors of our old Country man Pelagius, which the Jesilites in his time
had revived. After that the Spirit of God had banished the Heresies of Arius,
Nestorius, Madedonius, and Eutiches, which Satan in their persons had raised
against the persons of the Trinity, against the nature and person of Christ,
Pelagius a Scottish man did oppose not the Nature, nor the Person; but the Grace
of God: against him the Lord raised Augustine, who by the force of Scripture
beat the Heretic in all his errors, yet there were some relicts of that
subtle Heresy after Augustine death, which set up the head both in the
Eastern and Western Churches sometimes more, sometimes less; In the days of
Remigius and Hincmarus, great was the trouble that the Semipelagians made in
Germany and France, as we see in the cause of Goteschalcus, set down by
Gerhardus Vossius, but much more honestly by Primate Usher.

From that time there was not much dinne about these questions, When he came
to be infected with error.
till after the year 1590, when Molina a Spanish Jesuit began to renew many of
the Pelagian errors about Grace and Freewill, Election, and Reprobation, and
such heads.

Against him Alvarez a Dominican at Rome, did oppose at length: This fire
betwixt these two Orders began to burn first in Spain, and then in West
Flanders: from Lovan, the Jesuit Lessius blew over the reik to Amsterdam, where
Arminius was Preacher, the flame burning in his wanton Engine, brake out first
openly in a Treatise against Perkins golden Chain, thereafter he did spread his
errors where ever he might: Being called to the University of Leiden to
succed good Iunius, for sometime he was quiet, but at once with all diligence
he infected not only the youth in the University, but by them very many
Ministers over all the Land.

His petulant wit was not content to broach these remaynders of Pelagianisme
which Molina and his followers professed, but beside he fell on many more
dangerous novations and at last began to like much of Vorstius and Socinus
tenets.

This fire in the Holland Church burnt bold ly in the time of the Truce with
Spain, and was likely to threaten their estate with ruin in the time of
peace, more than the Spanish sword had done in all their wars.

So long as Arminius lived there was no remedy, When Arminianisme was crushed
in Holland.
when God had killed him, the evil grew no less; some Statesmen and Court
Ministers for their own ends did hold these errors on foot; the welminded
people cried still for a general Assembly as the only help of their Schisms:
the Arminians by might and maine set themselves against the meeting of a Synod,
as the certain ruin of their Party; so long as their Patron Barnavelt lived,
they got the Assembly shifted, but when that Traitors head was stricken off,
and King James our blessed Prince had advised often the States, and half by
threatenings commanded them, at last a general Assembly was called at Dort, not
only of Divines and ruling Elders from all the Provincial Synods of the
Netherlands, but almost from the whole Reformed Churches; there the most
excellent Synod being met that Christendom had seen for some hundred years;
the Arminian Questions were handled at leisure from November to May, and all
that was needful, was clearly decided.

That labor was so blessed by God, that the Land which through the Arminian
Schism and Errors was at the point of ruin, since that time has had peace
from these turbulent Schismatics. When Arminianisme did take root in Britain.


But here the pity, Britain whose waters mainly had slakened that fire abroad,
began at once to be scorched at home by some sparks of that flame.

The hopes of the Arminians in England were but small so long as K. James did
live, for that good Prince both in word and writing did threaten to burn these
Heretics if any of them should appear in his Dominions; see his Declaration
against Vorstius: yea, so long as Abbot was in grace at Court, the Arminians
kept a low sail, but after that his Successor even in his own time had come
in favor, that unhappy Sect under the patronage of Mountagu and White's
learning began to spread far and near, yea, at last silence in a public Edict
was enjoined to their opposers, and all favors conferred on those who had
skill and will to promote that Cause, and many evident disgraces poured on well
deserving men for no other reason, but their Anti-Arminian spirit.

All this time our Church was free of these evils; but so soon as the advancers
of Arminianisme at the English Court, began to intermeddle with the affairs of
our Kingdom, at once these men were eyed, who inclined that way, prime places
were put into their hands for no other virtue the World could discern in them,
but their boldness to let out their inclination toward the Arminian Error.

This way of advancement being perceived, incontinent many among us set their
hearts toward that art which was likeliest in haste to promote their fortunes,

It is to be remarked that the Arminian spirit in Holland leads men to hell
another way then here in Britain; The British Arminians decline to Popery, but
the Belgic to Socinianisme.
there the Arminians with great boldness running after Vorstius and Socinus
with a mavelous petulancy fell to brangle the Trinity of the Divine persons,
yea, the simplicity of the Divine nature it self.

But that Devil finding this his rashness to revive openly Manes and Arrius,
did make people abhor him, and flee away, he became more wary; so that among
us he lets these old condemned Heresies alone, and goes another way to work;
He leads by a new method to the errors of Antichrist; A Netherlandish
Arminian will scorn the superstitions, the Idolatries, the Tyrannies of the
Romish Church, but is much inclined after Vorstius and Socinus, under the
pretext of Liberty to run licentiously into Heresies condemned in the first
Oecumenick Coun cells: On the contrary, a British Arminian with the Ancients
will abhor the Extravagancies of Vorstius and Socinus, yet their heart is hot
and inflamed after the abominations of Rome: God who put Confusion in Babel,
has divided Satan's Kingdom against it self, else this subtle Devil might
have endangered the safety of the whole Reformed Church; But while in Holland
the horn of Arminianism is now broken out in his front long and great, and in
England the horn of Popery, we trust these two long black ugly horns shall
make that evil spirit both here and there so well known, that he shall not
be able to do so much harm any where as once was feared from him; however the
great Hammer that brake the neck of the beast over Sea, was that National
Synod and the mayn hope we have to get it mastered here at this time is by the
hand of our God in this present Assembly.

For the story I will say no more but come to the Doctrines; The five Arminian
Articles.
The multitude of their singularities was reduced at their own desire, both in
the Conference at Hage, and Synod of Dort to five Articles, or rather four,
for Grace and Freewill are commonly disputed together.

The first Article concerns Predestination, The state of the question in the
first Article.
the next the Death of Christ, the third and fourth Grace and Freewill, the
fifth Perseverance, we may add Justification as a sixth, whereon both these
over Sea, and their followers among us, run as mad as on any of the former.

Concerning Election, the first and chief part of Predestination, they teach,
that it is posterior to Faith, Works, and Perseverance; Arminius at the
beginning made faith alone previous to Election, but long since his followers,
and our men also join works, yea, perseverance to the end in faith, and works;
as if God first did foresee by his eternal Prescience, some men of their own
Freewill assenting to his Call in time, believing and going on to the end in
faith and good works, and after this foresight, did pass his Decree of
Election to glory upon these men clothed with the named qualities.

But we teach that Faith, Works, and Perseverance are posterior to Election;
that this is the cause, root, fountain, whence all grace in us does flow; that
our Election has no Antecedent cause, condition, or good quality on our part,
but flows merely from Gods good pleasure, and mercy looking upon us, lying in
our blood, corrupted with original sin, and in that case choosing us of his
free mercy to be members of his Son, to who^ he will give grace and glory,
though others as good and nothing worse then we are permitted to lie still in
the mass of corruption for the glory of his mercy to us and justice toward
them, without any ground of gloriation to the one, or complaint to the other,
as if any wrong were done them, when they are past by.

This our Doctrine of Election it is clear from Scripture, Our first argument
for absolute election is from Ephesians. 1.3.
1. see Ephesians. 1.3. [Blessed be God, who has blessed us with all spiritual
blessings in Christ, according as he has chosen us in him, that we should be
holy and blameless before him in love, having predestined us to the adoption
of children, according to the good pleasure of his will]

Here we are chosen to be holy and blameless, not because we were holy,
therefore we were chosen, Holiness is made posteriour to our Election; Now
Faith, Perseverance, Charity, and such graces are all parts of holiness, are
all fruits of the holy Spirit. Here also all spiritual blessings for which God
is to be praised, flows from this original; Election is the rule according to
which God distributes these graces.

Adoption also is made a fruit of Election, yea, the only reason of this
Election is made Gods good pleasure. By this place of Scripture Augustine beat
down the Pelagians, who taught an Election of foreseen works. [ Praedest. c.
8. Praesciebat ergo ait Pelagianus qui futuri erant sancti and immaculati per
liberum voluntatis arbitrium, and ideo eos ante mundi Constitutionem elegit,
quia tales futuros praescivit.
God foresaw (says the Pelagian) who should be holy and unblameable by their
own freewill, and therefore he did elect them before the foundation of the
World, because he foresaw they would be such.] What answers he to this
Arminian Objection in the mouth of the Pelagians? [ Intueamur Apostoli verba
atque videamus utrum propterea nos clegit quia sancti futuri eramus, an ut
essemus, benedictus, inquit Deus, etc non quia futuri eramus sed ut essemus,
nempe certum est, nempe manifestum est, ideo quippe tales eramus futuri quia
elegit ipse praedestinans ut per gratiam ejus tales essemus, cernitis
proculdubio, cernitis quanta manifestatione Apostolici eloquii defondatur haec
gratia, contra quam merita extollunt humana, tanquam homo aliquid det Deo and
retribuatur ei.
Let us behold the Apostles words, and see whether therefore he did elect us
because we were to be holy, or that we might be such: Blessed says the
Apostle, be God who has chosen us not because we were to be such, but that we
might be such: Why the matter is certain, it is manifest, for we were to be
such because God predestinating did choose us that we by his grace might
become such: you see doubtless, you see with what evidence of Apostolic
utterance, this grace is defended, against which humane merits extols it self,
as if man did give any thing to God, and it were rendered to him.] So does the
Father convince the Pelagians from these same words; he also closes the
mouths of the Semipelagians who taught that albeit works and holineffe was not
prior to Election, yet Faith or at least some beginnings of faith behoved on
our part to go before, to these thus he speaks, [ De dono Perseverantiae cap.
7. Audiant and ipsi in hoc testimonio (praedistinarisecundu^ propositum ejus
qui universa aperatur) ipse and ut inerpiamus credere operatur qui universa
operatur, nec fides ipsa praecedit, non enim quia credimus sed ut credamus,
elegit nos.
Let even these hear in this passage (predestined according to his purpose,
who works all things) he that works all things, works also that we begin to
believe, neither does faith it self go before his work, for he has chosen us
that we might believe, not because we did believe] Against both the whole and
half Pelagians, so he concludes triumphantly, [ Contra istam veritatis tam
claram tubam quis hom^ sobriae vigilantisque sidei voces ullas admittat humanas.

Our second argument from Romans 11.5.


Against so clear a trumpet of Truth, what person of sober and watchful faith
will admit the contrary voice of any man.]

Another Scripture, Romans 11.5. Even so also at this present time there is a
remnant according to the election of grace, and if of grace it is no more of
works otherwise grace is no more grace.

Here the Reason is given why among the misbelieving obstinate wicked Jews,
there was a few remnant who did believe and were saved: the grace, faith,
salvation of this Remnant is ascribed to their Election as the Cause, and this
Election is affirmed to come alone of Gods Grace, and denied to have proceeded
of any of their works, yea, these things are not simply affirmed, that the
grace and salvation of the remnant came from Election, that this Election was
of grace that it was not of works, but farther works and grace in this matter
of Election are declared to be inco^patible, so that those who make our
Election to depend on works, or to be posterior in Gods mind to his
foreknowledge of our works, say what they will, they are enemies of the grace
of God.

This place is so clear, that Arminius so long as he lived durst never ascribe
Election to good works as his followers now do, yea, the Lutherans to this day
dare not do it: but the place refutes even that which they say, that Election
is of Faith albeit not of works clearly enough, especially as Arminius
expounded Faith, for he made Election and Justification to depend on Faith,
not as it is an instrument applying Christ, but as it is an Evangelicall work
which God has appointed under the Gospel to be a saving quality of it self,
as perfect obedience should have been under the Law. In this sense Faith is a
true work, and who denies Election to be of works denies it as well to be of
Faith, which is a work. But take Faith as you will, this place removes it from
Election, for it ascribes Election to Gods grace alone excluding Faith, works,
or what ever is in us: The clearness of this place changed Augustine his
mind, and delivered him from that Lutheran error, wherein long he lay,
believing Election to have been of Faith, albeit not of works.

[ Ad hoc perduxi ratiocinationem ut dicerem non ergo elegit Deus opera
cujusquam in praescient^a sed fidem in praescientia elegit, ut quem sibi
crediturum esse praesciret ipsum eligeret, sed nondum diligentius quaesieram,
nec adhuc invenera^ qualis sit Electio gratiae de qua Apostolus. Our third
argument from Romans 8.28.
This was the issue of my argumentation that I said, God has not chosen any
man's works in his foreknolwedge, but he has chosen faith in his foreknowledge,
but I had not at that time diligently enough enquired, neither had I yet found
what was that Election of Grace, of which the Apostle spoke.

A third Scripture is, Rom 8.28. Whom he did predestinate, them he also
called, and whom he, etc. Here Election is made prior to calling and
Justification, as they to glorificatio^, much more to faith, works,
perseverance which are all posteriour to calling, we must first be Justified
before we can persevere to the end, we must first be called by the Word and
Spirit before we can believe. Faith then, and works and perseverance are
posterior to effectual vocation, much more to Election, which in this Scripture
is set before vocation it self, yea, before all the consequences and effects
of vocation.

The Arminians cannot get away from the grip of this place, but by wresting of
it pitifully, both at Hage Conference and in the Synod, and all their
posteriour writs, they with a strange impudence avow that Predestination,
Vocation, Justification in this place is no ways relative either to grace or
glory, but only to the cross and affliction: of all the malepert Wresters of
Scriptures that live this day, the Remonstrants are the chief. This present
subterfuge is Socinus his Invention, a wicked Heretic, who denies the merit,
the power, and the true satisfactions of Christ's death and blood, and so indeed
he has reason if his grounds be true; For with Arrius he spoils Christ of his
Godhead, which if he did want, his blood and death could not be satisfactory
for any one sin, yet this most pernicious heretic, the Arminians think no
shame to follow, in wresting the present Scripture, but to little purpose, for
the analogy of the whole Scripture, the scope of this Text will not let them
expound Predestination, Calling, and Justification as Socinus would, if we
admit in this place three of their greatest friends, and of our greatest foes
to be Judges, Pelagius, Arminius, Molina. From them all we have testimonies
that this place cannot admit Socinus interpretation, but I must haste.

A fourth Scripture is, Our fourth argument from Romans 9.11.
Romans 9.11. For the Children being not yet born, neither yet having done any
good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of
works but of him that calls, etc.

The purpose of God according to Election is understood here of Gods Eternal
Predestination as Pelagius and Arminius both in their Commentaries on the place
confess, this Election is ascribed only to God who calls, all works are
excluded because they were none, there could be none, the persons not yet being
borne, our Adversaries run here two diverse ways from this text.

Spalato understands works as existing not as future, saying, that Jacob was
elected not for any works which he had done, but for those which he was to
do, which was before God in his prescience.

This Pelagian subterfuge Augustine treads down in the first birth: [ Vestrae
ealiginis latebra propter quod profecto a sipitis, quia dicente veritate non ex
operibus sed ex vocante, vos dicitis ex futuris operibus quae Deus illum
facturum esse praesciebat Iacobum esse dilectum atque ita contradicitis
Apostolo dicenti non ex praesentibus operibus sid ex futuris.
This is the lurking hole of your darkness, wherefore truly you err, for the
truth saying not of works, but of him that calls, you say, Jacob was loved
for the works which God foresaw he was to do, and so you contradict the
Apostle saying, not of works, as if he could not have said, not of works
present, but for works to come.]

Arminius flies another way, granting that Jacobs Election was not of works,
yet avowing it was of faith, this hole Augustine stopped long ago, when the
Semipelagians would have been at it, Numquid dixit non ex operibus sed ex
credente, prorsus etiam hoc abstulit homini ut totum daret Deo, dicens sed ex
vocante, non quacunque vocatione, sed qua vocatione fit credens.
[Did the Apostle say not of works, but of him that believes, even this also
did the Apostle take from man that he might give all to God, saying but of him
that calls, not with every call, but by such a call wherewith we are made to
believe.]

One other Scripture, Our fifth argument from Acts 13.48.
Acts 13.48. As many as were ordained to life eternal believed: Gods
Ordination to life eternal goes before faith: belief is here an effect
ascribed to Election, as the cause whence it comes. To fly this Argument, the
Aeminians follow Socinus to a worse error then they would eschew, they
expound, ordained to eternal life, those who before all faith and calling by
their own free will were fitted and disposed for faith and salvation: This is
such an high degree of Pelagianisme that the Lutherans and Papists also, for
the most part do abhor it.

Second article stated.
IN the second Article of Redemption they Second Article stated.
teach that Christ by his death intended the universal Redemption of all men
without distinction of Elect and Reprobate, that he by his death did actually
impetrate to all the favor and grace of God, that the application of the
graces impetrated depends alone on the freewill of man, some according to their
Liberty making use of that purchased gift, Others to whom that grace and
salvation was alike purchased and intended on Gods part by their own neglect
and contempt, according to the same liberty of their will rejecting it.

We teach that Christ did give his life and blood alone for those who get good
by it, only for the faithful, even the Elect his own members.

Horrible absurdities follow on the Arminian Tenet, Absurdities consequent to
the Arminian tenet.
some whereof they acknowledge, and others are bound on their back by
inevitable consequences, to wit, that the fruit of Christ's death depends
absolutely upon the contingent assent of man's free will, that notwithstanding
his death it was possible and very contingent, that all men had perished, that
no soul had bin freed from hell by his blood, that God should never have had
any Church at all, that now by the virtue of his death, true grace is given to
all, that all Pagans as well under the Law as Gospel, who never heard of
Scripture, are truly reconciled to God by his death, that all Infants even of
Pagans are saved by Christ, who die before the years of discretion, That in no
man is any original sin, but every one when he is born is put in the state
of innocence, that Baptism is not necessay, for no sin is therein remitted
because there is none then to be remitted.

But how ever see how our doctrine is grounded on Scripture, Our first argument
that Christ died only for the Elect from John 17.9.
John 17.9. I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for those thou have
given me out of the world, for they are thine: Christ had no intention to give
his life for them for whom he avows, he would not pray, at that same time
when he was going to die; shall he give his life for those for whom he would
not open his mouth to pray; for his own only, for his Fathers proper ones, who
are given over and recommended to him, for these only and not the World he
avows, he does then pray.

Another, Ephesians. 5.24. Our second argument from
Christ is the head of the Church, Ephesians 5.24.
and a Savior of the body. Christ also has loved his Church, and gave himself
for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, and present it to himself a
glorious Church: Christ here gives himself to death, not for all but for the
Church only, he is a Savior only of the body of these whom he loves as his
spouse, whom he sanctifies and presents to God one day glorious without spot;
such are not the world of the damned.

A third Scripture, Our third argument from John 10.14.
John 10.14. I am the good shepherd and know the sheep, and am known of mine,
and lay down my life for my sheep: for whom has Christ laid down his life?
Only for his sheep, for those that are his, for those that know him as their
shepherd, of whom he takes notice as of his sheep, but for the Goats of the
world whom he knows not, over whom he never bare rule, who never were in his
fold, he lays not down his life.

A fourth Scripture, Our fourth from Ioh. 15.13
John 15.23. Greater love than this, has no man, that a man should lay down
his life for his friend: Christ lays down his life for his friends, not for
those who live and die strangers and enemies to him; for whom he dies, to them
he shows the highest degree of love, but to numbers of the Reprobates, he
never sends his Word, much less his saving grace; how then have they the fruit
of his greatest affection, even to die for them.

See also that of the 53 of Isaiah: Our fifth argument from Esaias 53. etc.
By his stripes are we healed, and that of the Apostle, He was made sin for us,
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him; those for whom Christ
was slain, are healed by his stripes, are made righteous and absolved from sin
by his blood, which he as their pledge shed for them: It is the justice of
God, that for whose sin he has received an infinite satisfaction, To these
should not be imputed their sins for a second satisfaction in their own
eternal torments, but so it is, that numbers of people are never freed from
their sin, never healed but perish.

Against all this their prime Objection, The Arminian objection answered.
in these Scriptures wherein Christ is said to have died for all, the Answer is
easy, that no man can deny but diverse Scriptures which are conceived in
universal terms, must be expounded with restrictions, for example Christ is
all in all, when I am risen I will draw all men to me, I will pour my spirit
on all flesh, they shall be all taught of God, will any man have these
universal Scriptures absolute and illimited; So does Augustine answer and beat
off the Pelagians when they press these Scriptures of Christ's dying for all and
every one; his words I pass for the time; when the Semipelagians rested not
content with his Answers to them he replies, de Correp. and Gratia, c. 14. in
these words well worthy the reciting, Omnes homines, omne hominum genus
intelligimus per quascunque differentias distributum, Reges privatos, nobiles
ignobiles, sublimes humiles, doctos indoctos, integri corporis debiles,
ingeniosos tardicordes fatuos, divites, pauperes, mediocres, mares, foeminas,
infantes, pueros, adolescentes, Juvenes, seniores, senes, in linguis omnibus,
in moribus omnibus, in artibus omnibus, in professionibus omnibus, in
voluntatum and consciont tarum innumerabili varietate constitutos, and si quid
aliud differentiarum est in hominibus.
[By all men we understand all kinds of men, divided by whatsoever
distinctions, Kings or private persons, noble or ignoble, high or low, learned
or unlearned, whole or sick, wise, simple, foolish, rich, poor, indifferent,
men, women, babes, children, youths, old men, of all languages, of al
dispositions, of al trades, of all professions, and according to their diverse
inclinations, innumerable ways diversified.]

Third and fourth article stated.
Concerning the third and fourth Article of Grace and Freewill, The third and
fourth Article stated.
consider that Freewill does denote formally the natural faculty of man's will
alone, yet because the light of understanding must direct the will, which of it
self is blind, and the will illightned does command the affections and the
other powers of sense and motion as her servants, for this connection and
dependence which is betwixt the will and all the natural powers of the soul,
the question about the power of all the natural faculties of man in furthering
his own salvation goes usually under the title of Free will alone.

The question of Free will, or of the power of nature, I mean of all the
natural faculties in the soul of man, whether understanding, will,
affections, or any other in the matter of salvation, This question has many
branches, but for shortness we only touch two heads therein: First, how far
nature can further grace and salvation, next how far it can hinder it: In the
first head sandry teach that nature alone without grace can save, that numbers
without the knowledge of Christ by their obedience to the Law of Nature through
the direction of right reason have been saved: Others ascribe not salvation
directly to nature alone without grace, yet they make saving grace to depend
upon nature, so that the right use of nature does draw by way of merit, at
least by way of infallible dependence the grace of Regeneration: Others go not
thus far in Pelagianisme, yet they give too much to nature in the matter of
salvation, they teach that sin has not taken away the power of the
understanding and of the will of man to believe and obey God, but only the
exercise of that power, that the power of man's Soul to all gracious works is
not dead but bound in fetters, farther that in the very first act of our
co^version, not only in all posterior acts of grace, God and Man, Nature and
Grace do concur as two partial causes, so that the whole effect of
Conversion does depend not only from Gods grace, but also the whole of it does
flow from Man and Nature, yea, that which makes Grace efficacious to
Conversion and Salvation is not Grace but Nature alone; for the concurrence of
Grace is often (say they) alike in these who are converted, and those who are
never converted, in these who are saved, and those who are damned, in both they
put a degree of grace simply equal, so that the only difference which casts
the balance, the only reason, why the same degree of grace which is
efficacious to convert and save one, yet is not efficacious for these effects
in another, is alone in nature, even in the free will of the one accepting and
yielding to that degree of grace, which the free will of the other made
inefficacious by its own resisting and rejection thereof.

In the second head of natures power to hinder Grace and Salvation, the most
common and infamous conclusion is, that the free will of man not only has power
to reject and refuse, to repel and frustrate, to overcome and make of none
effect the most efficacious motions of the regenerating Spirit of God, but also
very often does put this power in practice, hindering God when he intends to
convert and save, by its invincible perverseness to obtain that his gracious
end and merciful intention.

The errors of the first head the Arminians often in word do cast them from
themselves upon the Papists, yet in very deed they stumble too often upon them
all.

The errors of the second head they deny not to be their Tenets: however for
confutation of all errors in both the heads let us confirm these two
propositions.

First, neither free will, nor any other natural faculty in man has any power
at all to purchase either the beginning or midst of perfection either of grace
or salvation, but both grace and glory comes alone from God that quickens
nature, dead in sin, and makes it to work not in the strength of it self, but
alone of grace.

Secondly, that as Nature cannot further grace nor salvation, so can it not
hinder the Omnipotent power of the regenerating Spirit of God to call and
convert, and save whom ever he has a purpose to call, convert, and save. For
the full confirmation of the first proposition, see in Scripture these 3
grounds clearly set down.

First, Man by his free will is not able for any spiritual good.
That in no man by nature is any power at all to any spiritual good.

Secondly, That in every man by nature not only is a simple impotencie to good,
but also an exceeding great inclination to all spiritual evil.

Thirdly, What ever power to spiritual good, or what ever gracious operation is
found in any man, the only cause of that good is from God, who works it in man,
and makes man to work in the strength not of humane Nature, but of divine
Grace.

For the first, man's impotency, see John 6.44. No man can come to me except
the Father draw him. Jer. 5.23. Can the Ethiop change his skin, or the Leopard
his spots, then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil, Here
is man's impotency to convert to God, or change his wicked nature, 1 Cor. 2.14.
The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, For they are
foolishness to him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually
discerned. No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, 1 Cor. 12.3. 2 Cor. 3.5. Not
that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves, but
our sufficiency is of God; here the power to understand or think any good is
denied to man of himself, Mat. 12.34. O generation of vipers how can ye being
evil speak good things. 1 Cor. 14.3. No man can say, that Jesus is the Lord,
but by the Holy Ghost. Here holy and good speeches are denied to be in the
power of nature, all power of good deeds is also removed, Math. 7 18. Acorrupt
tree cannot bring forth good fruit, John 15.5. Without me ye can do nothing,
Whereupon Augustine commenting confounds Pelagius thus: Quid dicitis, quid vos
ipsos decipitis, non assertores sed praecipitateres liberi arbitrii ex alto
elationis per inama praesumptionis, in profunda submersionis, hom^nes si^i
placentes, mente corrupti, reprobi circa fidem, nempe vox vestra est, quod homo
ex seipso facit justitiam, sed veritas contradicit and dicit Palm non potest
fructum far a semetipso, nisi manserit in vite, Si est in vobis ullus sensus,
horretc, qu^ enim a semetipso fructum existimat far, in vite non est, qui in
vite non est, in Ch^sto non est, qui in Christo non est, Christianus non est
haec sunt profunda submersionis vestrae and ne quisquam putaret saliem parvum
aliquem fructum posse a semetipso se far, non ait quia sine me parum potestis
facere, sed nihil potestis facere, sive ergo parum sive multum, sine illo fieri
non potest, sine quo nihil fieri potest.
What say you, why deceive you your selves, not maintainers but casters down
of freewill from the heights of pride through the voids of presum ption into
drowning deeps, men pleasing themselves of corrupt minds, and concerning the
faith reprobate, for it is your sentence, that man of himself does justice.
But the truth contradicts and says the branch cannot bring forth fruit of it
self, unless it abide in the vine. If there be any sense in you, be amazed,
for who ever thinks he can bring forth fruit of himself, is not in the vine;
who is not in the vine is not in Christ; who is not in Christ is not a
Christian; These are your drowning deeps, and lest any should think that at
lest he might of himself bring forth some little fruit, he says not, without
me you can bring forth a little fruit, but you can do nothing: Whether
therefore it be little or much, it cannot be done without him, without whom
nothing can be done.]

This for our impotencie to all spiritual good.

For our perverseness and proclivitie to all spiritual evil, Man's will is
perverse and bent to all evil.
see Genesis 6.5. God saw that every imagination of man's heart was only evil
continually, Jer. 7.5. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked who can know it, Romans 7.14.18 I know that in me that is in my flesh,
dwells no good, for I am sold under sin, Ephesians. 2.5. We were dead in sins,
and 5.8. Ye were sometimes darkness, Ezekiel. 48.4. I know that thou art
obstinate, and thy neck is as an iron sinew, and thy brow is brass, Zachary
7.12. They made their heart as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the Law.

The third ground, All good in man comes only from grace.
that God alone works all our works in us, that our Illumination, Conversio^,
etc. flows from him alone, see, Ephesians. 2.10. We are his workmanship created in
Christ Jesus to good works. Psalm. 5.10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and
renew a right spirit with in me. 2 Cor. 4.6. God who commanded the light to
shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts. Phil. 2.13. It is God who
works in us both to will and to do of his own good pleasure. Ezekiel. 36.26. A
new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will
take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of
flesh, and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, 1 Chronicles. 4.7. Who makes thee to differ from another, and what have
thou that thou have not received? Why do thou glory, as if thou had not
received it.

We may see this doctrine of Scripture avowed often by all Christian Writers
especially by Augustine and Bernard, against the Pelagians, Hear some few of
their sayings. The 1 tells us, [ Libero arbitrio male utens homo and se perdidit
and ipsum, nameum libero peccaretur arbitrio amissum est liberum arbitrium.
Liberum arbi^rium ad diligendum Deum primi peccati granditate perdidimus,
magnas liberi Arbitrii vires homo cum crearetur, accepit, sed peccando amisit,
per velle malumrecte perdidit posse bonum, qui per posse bonum, libere elegit
velle malum. Peccato Adae liberum arbitrium de hominum natura periisse non
dicimus sed ad peccandum valere in hominibus subditis diabolo, ad been autem
pieque vivendum non valere, nisi ipsa voluntas hominis Deigratia fuerit
liberata ut velimus sine nobis operatur, cum volumus and sic volumus ut
faciamus, nobiscum cooperatur; tamen sine illo vel operante ut velimus vel
coope rante cum volumus ad bona pietatis opera nihil va^mus. Certum est nos
velle cum volumus, sed ille facit ut velimus de quo dictum est, Deu^in nobis
operatur velle, nos operamur sed Deus in nobis operatur and operari hoc nobis
expedit and credere and dicere, hoc est pium hoc est verum, ut sit humilis and
submissa confessio and detur totum Deo. Tutiores vivimus, si demus totum Deo,
non autem nos illi ex part and nobis ex part committimus. Bernard. Non partim
gratia and partim liberum arbitrium, sed totum quidem hoc, and totum illa sed
ut totum in illo sit and totum ex illa. Quid igitur ais, agit liberum
arbitrium. Respondeo breviter, salvatur, toll liberum arbitrium non erit quod
salvetur, toll gratiam non erit unde salvetur, opus hoc sine duobus esse non
potest, uno a quo sit, altero in quo vel cui sit. Deus author est salutis
liberum arbitrum tantum capax est dare illam, nisi Deus, nec capere valet nisi
liberum arbitrium.
Man abusing free will lost both himself and it. For when by free will sin
came, free will was lost: through the greatness of the first sin we lost
freedom of will to love God: Man in his Creation received a great strength of
free will, but by sin did lose it, by willing of evil, justly have we lost
power to good, who by power to good freely did choose to will evil: We say not
that by Adams sin free will is lost, but that in men subject to Satan, it
serves only for sinning, and is not able to make any live well and holily,
except the will of man it self by the grace of God be made free: God without
us makes is to will, when we will, and will so that we do he works with us,
yet without him both making us to will and working with us when we will, we
have no power to do any good or pious work: It is certain we will, when we
will, but he makes us to will, of whom it is said, God works in us the will:
We work but God in us works the work: It is good for us both to believe and
speak thus, this is piety, this is truth, that there may be a humble and
submissive confession, and all be given to God: We live more safely, when we
give all to God and do not commit our selves partly to him, and partly to our
selves.

Bernard. Not partly grace and partly free will, but both the one and the other
is all; But so that all is done in the one, and all from the other: What then
will thou say does free will, I answer shortly, it is saved, take away free
will and there shall be nothing which can be saved, take away grace and there
shall be nothing whereby to save. This work without two cannot be, the one in
which, the other from which it may be done. God is author of salvation, free
will only the subject thereof, none can give it but God, nothing can receive it
but free will.]

Our second proposition, The efficacious grace of God in man's conversion is
insuperable by man's will.
which the Arminians profess most to oppose, to wit, that free will nor
natural corruption does never, and is never able to overcom the motions of the
Spirit of God, when he purposes to call efficaciously and convert, John 6.37.
All that the Father gives me shall come to me. 8.45. Every one that has
heard and learned of the Father, comes unto me. Romans 8.30. Whom he has
called, them he also justified; also who have efficacious grace these have the
spirit of Christ, and who have Christ's Spirit are Christ's members.

Again, not only the will of man does ever obey Gods efficacious calling, but
it must do so, for the efficacy of Gods call stands in the removing of all
the perverseness and stubbornes that is in the will, in making the heart new,
soft and pliable to the Call, in making us will and believe, Phil. 1.29. Unto
you it is given not only to believe but to suffer. Phil. 2 13. God works in
you to will and to do. Ezekiel. 36.26. A new heart I will give to you, a new
spirit will I put in you, I will take away the stony heart, and give you a
heart of flesh.

Thirdly, GOD in man's conversion employes his strong and mighty power which the
Devil, the World, and the Flesh cannot overcome being the far stronger, Ephesians.
1.19. That ye may know the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward, who
believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in
Christ when he raised him from the dead. 1 John 4.4. Ye have overcome them
for greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world. Matthew. 12.29.
How can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods, except he
first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house.

Fourthly, The Creature cannot hinder its own Creation, nor the dead man his
own quickening, nor the child his own generation, nor the darkness its own
illumination, nor the white paper the writing on it self, nor the blind eye
the restitution of its light, nor the weak person the draught of a strong
hand: Now Scripture often compares the action of the Spirit converting a soul, to
a creation, a new life, a regeneration, an illumination, etc.

Fifthly, if the will of man could overcome the efficacious working of the
Spirit of God, then could the Decree of our Election and Salvation be made
altogether uncertain, and often be made null by the repugnance of man's will, and
the victory of our wickedness over the best, and most efficacious will of God,
but this were against Scripture, Esaias 14.24. The Lord of Hosts has sworn,
surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass, and as I have purposed so
shall it stand, the Lord of Hosts has purposed, and who shall disanull it. 2 Chronicles. 20.6. In thy hand is there no power? So that none is able to withstand
thee. Romans 9.29. Who has resisted his will? 8.30. Whom he has predestined,
them he also glorified.

The Fathers go here the Scriptures way: have some passages of Augustine cited
by Bellarmine himself; [ Deo volenti ^lvum facere ^ullum hominum ^sistit
arbitrium ^ic enim velle ^ut nolle ^n vo^entis aut nolen^is est potestate ^ut
divinam vo^untatem non impediat, nec ^superest potestatem, non est duhitandum
voluntati Dei vo luntatem huma^am resistere non posse, provisum est infirmitati
voluntatis humanae ut indeclinabiliter and inseparabiliter ageretur and ideo
quantumvis infirma non deficeret, nec adversitate aliqua frangeretur.
No will of any man resists God when he has a mind to save. For to will or
nill is so in the power of him that wills or nils that they do not hinder the
will of God, nor overcome his power: doubtless, the will of man is not able to
resist the will of God, God has so provided for the weakness of man's will,
that it should be led indeclinably and irresistably so that how weak soever it
is, it should not fall, nor by any opposition be broken.

The fifth Article stated.
THe question of perseverance is stated diversely, The fifth Article stated.
the Arminians now and many Jesuits do maintain a possibility to fall away from
grace totally and finally in all persons so long as they live, the most of the
Papists grant that those who are elected cannot fall away finally, but after
all interruptions there must be a return to grace, and that in them there is
a necessity of salvation: yet they say that many of the regenerate, and truly
faithful, may fall away even finally.

There is a kind of Arminians, who follow Joannes Gerhardus Vossius, who put a
degree of faith and grace, from which there is no deficiency, albeit from the
estate of faith essentially true, and from regeneration they teach falling
totally and finally; against all these we teach that God makes to persevere
and go on to the end, not only the elect but all the faithful, and that not
only those who are rooted in a high and excellent degree of faith, but all
whosoever have the least measure of true saving faith, who are regenerate,
justified, sanctified, in all these God keeps in some heat in the smoking
flax, puts under his hand when they fall, raises them ever up again, and leaves
not the building he has once grounded till he has crowned it with the
Capstone.

That thus it is, The necessity of perseverance proved from Mat. 24.29.
many Scriptures make evident Matthew. 24.29. He shall show great signs and
wonders that they shall seduce, if it were possible, the very elect, here the
Elect cannot possibly be seduced, all the wonders of Antichrist, the most
pregnant means that men and Devils can use to make the elect fall away do not
prevail, for it is not possible that such should be so seduced as to fall clean
away from Christ.

Jer. 32.39. The second from Ier. 32.39
I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, and I
will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from
them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their heart, that they shall
not depart from me. Here God promises to all the faithful, to all those with
whom the new Covenant is made, that they shall get an heart from God to fear
him, not for a time but for ever, that he will make with them an everlasting
Covenant that shall never be broken on either side, he assures not only for
himself, that he shall never change, but for them, that he will plant his
fear in their heart in such a measure that they shall stick to God, not for a
time, but so, that they shall never depart from him.

John 10. The third from John 10.
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, my sheep hear my voice,
and J give to them eternal Life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
any pluck them out of my Fathers hand. Behold, Christ's sheep are those who
believe, Christ assures them all of Life eternal, assuredly they shall never
perish because they are kept by his strong hand, the Father has put them into
the hand of his Son to be kept, yea, the Fathers own hand is about them, so
that they cannot perish except there arise some enemy stronger then God the
Father, to spoil him of his goods.

1 John 2.19. The fourth from 1 John 2.19.
They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us,
without doubt they had continued with us, but they went out that it might be
manifest that they were not of us. Who are they that do not persevere, who
fall away from Truth and Grace; these who were never gracious, even before
their Apostasy, for if ever they had been in the number of Christ's faithful
members, no doubt they would have continued so for ever. But God let them go
and depart that he might make manifest to the World, that Apostates even
before the appearing of their Apostacy were never sound, never rooted, nor
builded by faith on the rock, for if they had been such, when all storms of
temptations had blown, they would have stood firm, and the Ports of hell
should not have prevailed against them, they should have been as Mount Sion,
which never is removed but abides for ever.

Ephesians. The fifth from Ephesians. 1.13.
1.13. In whom after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit
of promise, which is that earnest of your inheritance: Here all the faithful get
the Spirit of Christ, as himself says to be their Comforter, and to abide
with them for ever, to be a seal, and to assure them that they are Gods, that
makes them call God Abba, Father, that witnesses to them that they are the
children of God, yea, Gods heirs, and Coheirs with Christ, which is their
earnest and first fruits of life eternal, which gives them full assurance of
hope, anchors their soul within the vail, and fills them with joy unspeakable
and glorious.

Among the infinite passages of St. Augustine for our tenet, take but one, de
corrept. and gratia, cap. 12. [ Primo itaque homini qui in eo bono in quo
factus erat rectus acceperat posse non peccare, posse non mori, posse ipsum
bonum non deserere, datum est adjutorium perseverantiae, sine quo per liberum
arbitrium perseverare non posset: Nunc vero sanctis in regnum Dei per gratiam
praedestinatis non tantum tale adjutorium perseverantiae datur sed tale ut
ipsis perseverantia donetur, non solum ut sine isto dono perseverantes esse non
possint, verum etiam ut per hoc donum non nisi perseverances sint, non solum
enim dixit, sine me nihil potestis facere, verum etiam dixit, non vos me
elegistis, sed ego vos elegi and posui vos, ut eatis and fructum feratis and
fructus vester maneat; quibi^ verbis non solum justitiam, sed and in ea
perseverantiam se dedisse monstravit: Christo enim sic cos ponente ut eant and
fructum ferant and fructus little maneat, quis audeat dicere forsitan non
manebunt, ^ne poenitentia enim sunt donum and vocatio Dei, pro his
interpellant^ Christo ne deficiat fides eorum, sine dubio non deficie^ usquein
finem, ac per hoc perseverabit usque in finem nec nisi manentem vitae hujus
inveniet finis: Major quippe libertas necessaria adversus tot and tantas
tentationes, quae in Paradiso non fuerunt dono perseverantiae munita atque
firmata, ut cum omnibus amoribus terroribus, erroribus suis, vincatur hic
mundus, q^^ sancti cuncta minantia, cuncta invitantia, cuncta (...) ruentia
superarent.
Unto the first man who in that good estate wherein he was created righteous,
had received a power not to sin, not to die; a power not to fall from his good
estate, to him was given the help of Perseverance: not such a gift whereby he
should persevere, but such with out the which he was not able by his free will
to persevere. But now unto the Saints, by the grace of God predestined unto
the Kingdom of God, not only such a help of perseverance is given, but such,
that perseverance it self is given to them, not only so that without that gift
they cannot persevere, but also that through that gift they cannot but
persevere: for he has not only said, without me ye can do nothing, but he
says also, you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you
that you should go on and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; in
which words he shows that he has not only given righteousness but perseverance
therein: for Christ having so set them that they go and bring forth fruit, and
their fruit abides, who dare say perchance they shall not continue, for without
repentance are the gifts and calling of God, Christ praying for them that their
faith fail not, without doubt it shall not fail to the end, and so shall
persevere to the end, and the end of their life shall find it remaining, for
now a greater liberty is needful against so many and so great temptations,
which were not in Paradise, being guarded with the gift of perseverance, that
this world with all his lusts, terrors, errors, might be overcome, and the
Saints prevail against all threats, all allurements, all power]

The current of Scripture and Fathers runs so straight against the total and
final apostacy of the Saints, that Arminius for all his boldness durst not,
so long as he lived, set his breast against that stream, albeit his Scholars
since have mainly set themselves to evert this Article, which is the chief
ground of all the comfort that the soul of man has in this miserable
pilgrimage.

Of all their contrary argumentations consider All baptized Infants are not
regenerate.
but one: Milions of these who were baptized in their infancy fall away finally
and totally, but all these who were baptized in their infancy were truly
regenerate, sanctified, justified, and put in the state of salvation, Ergo,
millions of these who were truly regenerate, justified, sanctified, and put in
the state of salvation, fall away totally and finally.

In this Popish argument the Arminians triumphed at the beginning, as our men
do yet, but after a little trial both Papists and Arminians, find it so
foolish and impertinent that long ago they have cast it away.

It is easy to show the falsity of the Minor that al Baptized Infants are
truly regenerate, etc. Scriptures, Fathers, Schoolmen, are all to the contrary,
but leaving these I only show that this assertion is against the Scottish
Confession; the twenty fifth Article restifies that the Reprobate only does
communicate in the outward benefits of the Sacraments, that they get no fruit
of Christ's death, that in this life their sins are not forgiven them, that
these blessings belong only to the Elect, that the Reprobate at their best are
but chaff, and at no time are good wheat, who therefore avow that the
Reprobate sometimes, to wit, in their infancy are truly regene rate, justified,
sanctified; who avow that Reprobates get many fruits of Christ's death and their
Sins some times forgiven them, they contradict clearly our confession, yea
almost all the confessions of the reformed Churches. If they will believe their
good friend D. Francis White he will assure them that none but Papists and
Lutherans will affirm reprobate infants by baptism to be regenerate.

How far the chief Arminian tenets are contrary to Scripture I I have shown;
Arminianisme is contrary to the Confession of the Church of Scotland.
Consider in a few lines how much they are opposite to the Confession of our
Kirk, and so I close. They teach that our Election is of Faith, Works,
Perseverance, as antecedent either Causes or Conditions, or at least Qualities
fore seen in us. Our Confession Article 8. says that God has chosen us of
mere grace, that faith to believe in Christ and all grace we lost in Adam, is
given us after our Election.

Again, they teach that Christ died for all, that in death he stood in the
place of all without distinction of elect and reprobate, that all have the
benefit of his death. Our Confession says, Art. 8. that Christ suffered for
us, that is the elect, of whom alone the whole Article speaks: Also that the
benefits which the elect have common with the reprobate are but their Creation,
no ways their Redemption and their Adoption thereby to be the sons of God: And
in the 25 Article it is said, that the Reprobates have no benefit of Christ's
Death, Resurrection, or Ascension.

Lastly, they teach that many of Christ's faithful members fall away and lose
not only all grace but salvation it self. Our Confession Art. 25. contradicts,
affirming, that all the faithful continue in the estate of Justification, that
albeit their sins be great, yet they are not imputed but covered with Christ's
righteousness.

Again it is one of the faithfuls privileges to go on constantly to the end,
till they be conformed to Christ's glorious body. And in the 21 Article, that
the faithful in such a manner become flesh of Christ's flesh, and bone of his
bone, that he abides in them and they in him for ever, no less then the
Godhead abides in the manhood of Christ, giving to it life and Immortality.

Our Confession crosses their Doctrine of free will, justification and other
their popish errors more clearly, but with those I do not meddle lest by
further prolixity I should longer withold so great an Assembly from their
most weighty Affairs.

FINIS.
