Ione is as good as my Lady.
To the tune of What care I how fair she be.




SHall I here rehearse the story
Of a Woman in her Glory,
You have heard how Euah came
Into the world, the first fair Dame,
she was naked had no clothing,
yet she did deserve no loathing:
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
What care I for silks array
That but glistereth in the day,
Each other Sense deserves as much,
That's to hear, to taste, to touch,
Gentle Ioane may be as fair
as a rich man's only heir,
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
Ione can call by name her Cowes,
And deck her windows with green bows
She can wreathes and Tutties make,
And deck with plumbes a Bridale Cake,
Is not Ioane a House wife then
Judge true hearted honest men:
Then good friend I say to thee
Ioane is as good as my Lady.
Ioane can bake and Ioane can brew
And to give sweet Ioane her due,
Any thing that longs to man,
Ioane will do it if she can,
she will seek all sorts to please,
and love no idleness or ease:
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
Ioane can spin and Ioane can card,
Joan keeps clean both house and yard,
She can dress both flesh and fish,
Or any thing that you can wish:
she can sow and she can knit,
Ioane for any thing is fit:
then good friend I say to thee.
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
Ioane is of a lovely brown.
Neat as any in the Town:
Heaire as black as any Crow,
And does nimbly trip and go,
slender waste, and fingers long,
roaling eye and nimble tongue:
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
The second Part.
to the same tune.




IOane is skipping like a Fawn
^n a pleasant verture Lawne.
When she plays at Barley-breake,
She of all does give the squeake:
Ioane can dance a Scottish ^igge
and does nimbly play the rigge:
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
When the young men of the Town
Gives the Maidens a green Gown,
Ioane has kisses more then they,
And does bear the Bell away
Soill the garland she does win
for her dancing trick and trime:
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
All the Youths of our Towns end
Strive to make sweet Ioane their friend,
Some gives Purses, some gives Rings,
With Bracelets, Girdles, and such things,
happy is their hour and time
who can give sweet Ioane the wine:
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
Put her on a Silken Town,
There Is no Lady in the Town,
But with her she may comp^^^
And is every way as fair,
painted clothes the body shapes^
making them phantasticke dies:
then good friend I say to thee,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
Spepheards Swains admires her note,
When she strainech but her throats,
Then they throw their Pipes away,
Vowing Ioane has got the day,
they join hands and dance a ring,
and this is all the song they sing,
we conclude, and all agree,
Ioanes as good as my Lady.
FINIS.
