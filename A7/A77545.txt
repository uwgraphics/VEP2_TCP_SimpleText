BRITANNIA, PASSIONATELY AND HISTORICALLY, Remembering her Misery and Happiness
in former Ages, and declaring her Calamities, and Epectations now.
O Stay and consider! I conjure ye by the being and original you have from me;
I conjure ye by all your native relations, Her adjuration.
by the blood which is so warm in your veins, and heats you into such famous
Resolutions for your Religion and Country; I conjure ye by all the peace, by
all the happiness and prosperity, by all the pleasures I have afforded you, by
all those terrene blessings, those glorious habitations and Cities, by all
those goodly Territories, by all that can be dear, or precious, or honorable;
I conjure ye by my sufferings, by my troubles, my slaughters, Her complaint.
by my present desolations and distractions, by the purple streams that flow
down every Province and County, by my torn and dishevelled Laws, Privileges,
Immunities, by the mutual wounds and discords, by all the disorders and
rapines, by all the tyrannies and woeful oppressions, by all the violations and
disturbances, by all the expressible or imaginable sorrows of a State and
Kingdom, by my own tears and sighs; behold and consider my meditations, and
power forth your passions with me: O let us contribute our lamentations, and
consociate our griefs, and let us lay our sorrows together, and make up a rich
and solemn lamentation, there is a glory in calamity, and a grandeur in
distresses: O let ue sit down and reason together, let us remember our former
sorrows, and call up the ghosts of ancient calamities, and recover the
miseries of other Ages from their Sepulchers, let us sit a while in the Region
and shadow of death, and ask the way into the land of forgetfulness, and
converse with the hoary spirits of our Ancestors, and contemplate those rivers
of blood, which run in the channells of those ages, and are now overflowing
into our own: let us ask after the golden times and prosperities which have
made our forefathers happy in the enjoying, and would almost make us miserable
in the remembering.

I was at first glorious in the name of Britain, The first britains.
and though I had no King or Monarch, but was divided into several States and
governments, yet I was a pleasant and pregnant soil, green and springing with
meadows, vartegated with flowers, shaded with trees, and white with harvests,
and painted with inhabitants, and undeflowred with aliens, unviolated either
with the languages, usages, or fashions, or dispositions of forrainers, I
enjoyed my self in my own banks girded with waters, abounding and flourishing,
and like the map of another world, as if Providence had made all over again in
me in a lesser Globe, and divided me from the rest, and walled and secured me
with Seas, I knew none mightier then Cassevalaunus, who had only a temporary
administration and rule, here was no Tyranny, no oppression, no divisions but
of provinces, till some Merchants having only a Maritine knowledge of me, gave
Caesar so much information as sent him over, and then factions increased at
home, and my inhabitants enflamed against one another, made breaches for the
Roman enemy to enter, then my peace wasted, and my glory declined, and I
became a tributary to another nation, till Voadicia, that famous Queen,
spirited with a British virtue would needs forget her Sex and constitution, and
turn masculine for the redeeming of her Country, and having rallied many
thousands of my inhabitants, defeated the Roman forces, yet being of a Sex too
weak for a victory, was forced to let it fall out of her hand again; and
Suetonius a Roman General took it up, then was I more miserable than before,
my oppression heavier: Thus has the Tyranny of Rome been ever fatal and
grievous to me unto this day, yet I confess, I bad some calmes and peaceable
distances, even then, but my Northern enemies broke in upon me while my Romano
governors were absent, and then I sent Ambassadors abroad unto them, but had
no redress, my people were taken from me, and in those mighty factions of Rome
spent, and I woefully depopulated; this was the complexion of my misery then;
and yet in all these oppressions my inhabitants have ever been mindful of
their ancient liberty, and have struggled against the Tyrannies of those ager,
and writ their National virtues in drops of blood unto Posterity.

And now my troubles grew to be more numerous, The Saxons.
and my factions potent, and Vortigern stands up in a supremacy, and being not
strong enough to support such a glorious advancement, he calls in a ravenous
and rude enemy, who though they landed upon my soil as Stipendaties, yet there
flowed in such numbers and streams of people by the interest they obtained in
a doting Prince, enamoured on a Saxon beauty, that they soon spread over into my
Northern Provinces: and thus possessed on such large Territories, they break
out into insolences, and they rage upon my inhabitants, who still retaining
their Native excellency, combine and fight with these usurpers, under the
Standard of a famous King: Arthur.
and now my Kingdom looks red again with new slaughters, and my people after
many bloody contentions are conquered and spoiled, and I left in a deplorable
condition, rent and divided into so many parts and Dominions, every grand Saxon
holding up a Scepter, and my poor inhabitants with all their Laws, Religion,
and Liberties entombed in a general desolation, all my delicacies not
regarded, but trampled on by a cruel and barbarous nation.

Now I am distracted again, and fresh Calamities succeed, The Danes
new stirs and broiles inflame me every day, and there comes over by degrees
another Nation fierce and Martial, and those arrive upon my coasts, and the
ride of blood flows higher than before, I was now in as sad a condition as
ever, and I had nothing to comfort me in these tumults of the Danes and Saxons,
but the light of the Gospel break in upon me, and gloriously shone upon my
white cliffs, and now I felt a new happiness, me thought, Augustine the Monk.
springing within my nation, now I conceited my self nearer heaven then
before, now my shadows fled away, and I saw and discovered further; and yet I
am able to say now, my beam was not so pure then, darting upon my eyes but
through a cloud of superstition, yet I had little peace, for, those that wasted
and spoiled my first people, they are now declining into a subject of revenge
themselves, and the Britains sufferings must now be required at the hands of
their oppressors, and they must now let out their bloods for expiation, the
Danes flow in like a crimson inundation upon the land, and I must now submit to
another desolation, and be ruined over again.

Nor am I long in this affliction, but things a little composed, The Normans.
I am looks upon again, by a new Conqueror, and thus exposed to an inevitable
invasion, the Normans come over and possess me, and clothe me in purple once
again at the battle of Hastings, and now all my Nobility and people
distracted at their overthrow, lay down their defensive power, and presents my
Crown and inheritances to that famous William: now my Laws, customs, William
the Conqueror.
Privileges are all changed, and I am made a little more happy then before,
and though I exchanged but one trouble for another, yet by a wise Providence,
this trouble like a wave lands me upon a more blessed shore of prosperity then
ever I had, now I am more civilized in attire and language, now I appear more
comely and beautiful, now I enter communion with other Nations, and am able to
look abroad and converse with other States and kingdoms, I begin to improve
an interest abroad, and trade for relations, and negotiate for Foreign
ornaments, now I can contemplate my former miseries, and admire the happiness
of my present condition, and yet my religion was but of a duskish color, for
now the cloud of Superstitions began to gather and cast a shadow upon many
nations as well as mine.

And now my Crown grows brighter and more glorious then before, now my power
becomes more Regal and Monarch call, and every day I receive some degree of
perfection and accomplishment, and the troubles are as yet no more then puts a
blushing die upon my face, and makes me more beautiful, and I am now busied
only to keep my self from the invasion of old troubles, and thus being
enriched and beautified by a new access of Majesty, I am courted by a
succession of Kings, of Williams, Henry's, a Stephen, a Richard espouse me, and
these are times rather of enlargement and happiness then of calamity to me.

But new revolutions of time brings with them revolutions of fortune, King
^ohns (...)
and misery appears to me again in the apparition of broiles and combustions,
my Prince and Nobles contend for liberties, and a supremacy from Rome
intercedes and stirs up more unhappy contentions, and now I am brought into a
new captivity, and my ancient liberties, which was before conquered from me by
a power from Rome, is now again after my recovery and re-establishment taken
away, and I am chained unto the Papal chair, and my Prince too, and my
inhabitants, and this my second servitude to Rome is worse and more Tyrannous
then my first, now my soul has lost her liberty, and I am disfranchised in
spirit and conscience, and all because I endeavored my redemption; and thus,
as if some fatality were now upon me, I am now espoused again to other Kings,
but still more unfortunate in my successors: now my Peerage and Sovereign are
beginning bloody discords, ^enry the (...)
and all the Quarrel is only for breaking the Coards which bound me fast, my
King will needs enslave me, and make me submit to an unjust power, and
Prerogative, and these my Nobles and Barons pitying to see my bondage, and not
able to see their mother lie so fettered, who used to triumph in her Liberty,
and walk in the pleasant meadows of enlargement, now my fields are embrued
again, and the bodies of my slain people lie scattered before my eyes.

And thus, as if a bloody Comet hung over me, other, and those more woeful and
calamitous stirs break forth, The wars of York and L^ncaster begun by Henry
the ^our^h.
and now my people fight for enjoying me, now I cannot but lament and bemoane
my present unhappiness, I weep over my own comeliness, and curse my features
and beauty, and call my Empire an unfortunate inheritance, that should occasion
such strifes and miserable distractions, alas how many lie gasping and bleeding
upon my plains, how are all my pleasures turned into sorrows, all my comforts
into sighs and groans, to see those that should live in peace with one
another, enjoying the comely intercourse of friends and neighbors and Country
men, and now wounding all these relations, and without difference and respects
making but one common sepulcher of those goodly Provinces.

And now a King takes me by the hand, and administers comfort and consolation
to me, now I feel better influences than before, Henry the sevenths Reign.
my blood is stanched, and my dead are buried, and I have new robes presented
me, and white garments, and those that were rouled in blood are taken from me,
and now I have a garland of Roses not red with battles, but Damaskt with peace
and happiness; now the birds return again and sing on my branches, and the
Heart and Roe trips upon my plains, my sheep graze upon my mountains in
flocks, and my shepherds begin to make oaten pipes, and warble their
harmless tunes unto the valleys which resound the joyful reconciliations
unto them, and now he that sits upon my throne, smiles upon me, and entertaines
me with pastimes, and glorious delights of peace.

Yet to put me in mind that I am not immortal, Henry the eights troubles
Commotions begin in me, and my Liberty being almost lost again, and the
Tyrannies of Rome overflowing into my kingdom; one that had espoused me for my
perfections, and possessions, rouses up himself and breaks the Cords that
superstition had tied him with to the Papal Dominion, and sets me at liberty,
and now I enjoy my freedom and ease, and rejoice in my old immunities, now I
am emancipated from another Supremacy, and those that led the souls of my
people captive, and forced them to bring all, and sacrifice to their pleasures,
making them to lay down not only their consciences, but their goods, lands, and
all my delightful situations at their feet, are expulsed from my dominions,
and though I remained still fettered in Superstitions and ignorance, yet I
gained a kind of enlargement, by the favor and Indulgency of this Prince.

After these, there arises a bright star, and shines upon me, Edward the 6. his
troubles.
and me thought I was much refreshed at the first dawning of it; this brought
me tidings of a more glorious light to follow, and yet in these days, when
religion cleared up more brightly then ever, many a dark cloud of trouble was
passing over me, and many stirs were beginning, but still happily becalmed by a
divine providence, and the mist which was so thick in my Kingdom before, begun
to break and scatter, and I had a cleerer prospect, now I could see about the
clouds, and many mysteries opened themselves to my discovery; and now my
Liberty increased, till this star fell into my lap, and then a horror and
darkness spread over me again.

Now my sufferings are returning again, and I must be once more wet in the
blood of my inhabitants, yet those troubles did more comfort me, Queen Mary's
troubles.
than the other did discontent me; and I rejoiced to be a tomb to those, whose
bodies and ashes were perfumed with the holiness of their souls, never did I
more triumph in my noone and height of prosperity, when I had peace and all
other blessings at the full, Oh! I gathered up those drops of blood from the
Martyrdom of those Saints, and congealed them into rubies and Coral, and made
me dressings and Jewels of them, oh the radiant flames of those fires which
gave more luster unto my Kingdom then all the luminaries of heaven, then either
Sun or stars: oh the glory of that age, and suffering, the lights of heaven,
the day it self was darkened and occlipsed with those fires, and the ashes of
those Saints were an ornament and rich covering upon me: these were troubles of
a fresher complexion, the tears that were then shed I preserved in channells,
and it pleased me to look upon such streams, such holy lamentations were
music to my hills and valleys, and the Psalms which carried up the souls of
my dying Martyrs were the sweetest harmony that ever the Trees of my Forest
ecchoed.

But these waves in a short time left raging, Queen Elizabeth's time.
and run in a smooth current, and now the storms gave way to a more peaceable
and quiet feason, and a Lady enters upon my Throne, attended with graces and
honors, with peace and flourishings, and this time I enjoy a composed and
undisturbed condition, pleasures abound in my palaces and cities, and wealth
and riches, and all plenties flow in all my habitations, now I am courted from
abroad, and other Kingdoms send me Ambassadors, and wooes my favors, and
acquaintance, not any noise of War is heard in my land, and when at any time a
cloud was gathering against me, either from abroad or at home, I saw a Divine
breath dispersing and blowing it away, and thus I passed years of pleasure, and
my Peace and happiness lengthens.

Now a new Prince comes in, King James his time.
and to make me more blessed and completely glorious, he brings with him a
people of his own, and a kingdom too, and now I am returned to my ancient
Liberties, and enlargements, now I am Britain again, and my dominions wider,
and I hear not now a murmuting, or the least whisper of any trouble, though
there were some endeavourings by night, yet it was only in a few treasonable
and personal practices; but oh, I had a strange misgiving then; me thought my
peace was but a prodigious and boding calm, and I prophesied to my self that
surely a tempest was not far off, and no sooner had a few years rolled over my
head, but another King is seated in my throne, and as he sat down, some drops
of blood sprinkled upon the Seat, and stained the robes, which made me fear
such a purple inauguration would be followed with as red a revenge, and with
streams of blood hereafter.

While I was triumphing some years in my new glory, King Charl^s his time.
enjoying the prosperity of a full throne, adorned with a Garland from France,
feasting and banqueting at home and abroad with foreign States, me thought I
felt a d^stemper of alteration running an my veins, I begun to be fensible of
new Ceremonies, and dressings, and paintings in my Religion, of new
oppressions, new exactions in my State, my Court grew full of pride, gallantry,
ambition, lust, and wantonness, my tribunalls full of injustice, of
unrighteousness, or bribery, my Cities full of deceits, cheatings, extortions,
usuries, my Countries full of oppressions, ignorance, profaneness,
covetousness, uncharitableness, my King grew credulous, my Courtiers
Tyrannous, my Nobles and Gentry many of them vicious, and while these things
were thus carried on, there begun some strivings in my Northern parts; and the
troubles gathered, and in a short time were so many, that I felt two Armies in
my bosom struggling, but they were soon appeased, and when I thought I had
seen the return of a peace, a new difference flames out, my King and subjects
contend together, and from paper to powder, from pen to pistol, and now behold
a generation is risen up, destroying my Religion, my Laws, my Liberties, my
Parliament, my inhabitants, my Cities, my Countries, my Palaces: I that have
enriched them, how do they impoverish me? how do they consume my cattle, my
wealth? how do they give my glory to the tramplings and scorns of my enemies?
how do they persecute my only darling? the conservatory of my peace, the
Cabinet of my prosperity? how is it broken up? Parliament.
how is that Parliamentary honor laid in the dust? how have they emboldned and
encouraged those that durst not appear in my ruin before? those that I had
curbed with laws, and chained with my national power? how have they have
violated all? and taken off their fetters, and brought them out to be the
persecutors, Papists.
the tormentors, the murderers of my dearest subjects? how have they complied
with other Nations, strangers to me in Religion, in Laws, in Liberties? and
these must be landed upon my shoares, and mixed with my inhabitants, a nation
whom their own Kingdom have vomited out, as unworthy to tread upon the soil;
and these must come over into my habitations with hands besmeared in the blood
of so many thousand Saints; O all ye that have any commiseration in your
souls, any bowels of compassion, go fall down at the Throne of my Prince,
speak to him with tears and sighs, to stop the bleeding of his Kingdom, to put
away those purple Counselors, that dash my people so together, that are never
weary with contriving new engines and devices of blood and calamity! O pray him
by his own obligations to me, his oath so solemnly taken to preserve me, pray
him by all his former and many Protestations to defend my Religion, my peace,
and Liberty, pray him by the comforts and endearments of the precious blossoms
upon his Throne, pray him, as he regards the preservation of his Crown, of his
Parliament, of his Kingdom, nay of all his Kingdoms: O tell him the miserable
and unfortunate glory of such a Conquest; the unhappy and unnatural triumph in
such spoils.

O call to those Princes that are about him, call to their chariots to stay,
before they drive into irrecoverable ruin, call to their swords before they
(...) drunken in the blood of those that have no crime, but Religion upon these
souls.

O call to the Divines there before they recover the banks of Tyber, call to
them to return from Idolatry, from Superstitions, call them home again before
they arrive at those shadows of desolation, which are in Babylon.

O call unto the people that are in Arms about him, that they will remember
their Liberties, and look back and see them swimming down in the blood of their
Ancestors, call to them to think upon their posterity, that they may not twist
such cords for to bind themselves, and make withs to tie their generations
after them; O call to them to come out of the mist they fight in, hold before
their eyes the Kingly and Parliamentary power they fight against, call to them
to bring home the person of their King to the Throne that wants him, hold forth
your Religion, your Reformation, which you received from other age^, and
desires only to improve it to the generation after ye, hold forth the
Likerties, the immunities of England, ask them if they be digging a Sepulcher
to bury their grand Charter in before they die, and if they fight to make the
(...) of their Prince a King?

And if still they go on in these contentions, they must know, I shall receiver
my Liberties against their swords, the ghosts of England will rise up, and
fight against them, those that have gone down to their graves in this defense
both in this age, and in the ages before: heaven is engaged for me, and my
people fight against an enemy whose idolatries, whose blood guiltiness, whose
blasphemies, and prophanations will take their part in destroying them, and now
is the time of my Reformation come, behold the many divine assistance, the many
heavenly deliverances, the many miraculous evidences my people have had since
the beginning of these wars, behold those eternal truths which are hastening
their accomplishment, behold the Prophetical declination of Rome, behold how
my people are returned home to me again, who have wa^dred abroad seeking
sanctuaries from persecutions, as if they were sent before hand to wait for
some new blessings, these are my certain and undeniable comforts, my
assurances, my expectations, and on the pillow of these I shall rest my
wearied, and distressed, and complaining soul.
