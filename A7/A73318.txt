A supplycacion to our most sovereign lord King Henry the eight / King of
England of France and of Irelande / and most ernest defender of Christ's
gospel / supreme head under God here in earth / next and immedyatly of his
churches of England and Irelande.

Matthei.ix. The harweste is great but the laborers are few. Wherefore pray
the lord of the harweste to send forth laborers into his harweste.

A supplication to our most sovereign Lord King Henry the eight King of
England / of France / and of Irelande. etc.
MOst dread Sovereign lord and most christen Prince / when I remember the
lamentable, and wonderful great blyndnes wherein the most part of all England
not only of ye layete called the temporaltie / but also of the Clergy / have
pytuousely erred and wandered many hundereth years / acceptinge / reputing /
and most ungodly / erronyousely / and blyndely / estemynge the Bishop of Rome
to be supreme head over and above all christen congregatio^s: and in diverse
other points such as be touching ye necessary articles of our faith. I
could not but meruell how and by what means such pestilent errors and
horrible dark blyndenes could or might enter / Invade and ouerflowe this your
realm / and to contynewe so long in the same / not espied / perceived / nor
repelled. Consideringe that by all that time and space this your Realm (as the
most part of men did then judge and esteame) was well endowed / replenyshed /
and furnyshed with many profounde learned clerks / whereof some were Bishops
Archedeaco^s / Deanes / Prebendaries / Parsons / Doctors / Bachelars in
deuinite / and other profounde learned clerks in both ye vniuersytees which
were / grave / sage / and ancient fathers. Contemplatinge and reuoluinge these
things in my mind: not a little moved / troubled / and vexed with ye same / I
applied me with all my power and dyligence exquysytely to search and to know the
original ground and cause thereof. And in co^clusyon amongst other things it
chanced me to read in the.v. chapter of Ezay a proposition that much
lamenteth ye captyuite and bondage which comes and grows to all people for
lack of knowleage in godds word / Saying / Therefore comes my flock also
into captyuite / because they have not understanding / their glory is famyshed
with hunger / and their pride marred with chyrste. Therefore gapeth hell and opens
her mouth meruelousely wide. By this text graciouse lord it appears that
all miserable blyndenes captyuite and bondage under sin / comes for lack
of knowleage in Gods word. Mar. xij,
I had forgotten at that time / that Christ reproved the Pharasees / saying /
You err not knowinge the scriptures. Which reprove and rebuke should have been
a suffycient admonycio^ and doctrine to me and to all other whereby we might
have known that all error comes for lack of understanding and knowleage
in the scriptures. But by what reason then could there be such error and
blyndenes for lack of knowleage in Gods word in this your realm most
gracious lord / seeing there were such profounde clerks and ancient fathers
/ Bishops and students in the same / which did teach and preach unto the
people co^tynually. The Apostle Paul in the.vi. chapter to Timothe descrybeth
two kinds of doctrynes / the one he calls a godly doctrine and a doctrine of
health / the other he calls a proud doctrine full of unprofitable questions /
stryuynge more for words than for godly knowleage / whereof spryngeth envy /
stryffe / raylings / evil surmysyngs / and vain dysputacions of me^ with
corrupt minds destytute of the truth / which think that lucre is godlynes.
This kind of learning and subtle dysputacyons unto this day we call scole
matters / from the which Paul commands all christyans to separate the^
selves. ij. Ti. iij
Soche clerks says Paul / be ever learning / but never atteyne to the
knowleage of the truth. With such wayne ungodly and unprofitable lerninge /
this your realm most redoubted sovereign was over much replenyshed through
the preachinge and teachinge of such scole men and subtle disputers /
otherwise called deceyuers. Which was one of the causes of our miserable
blyndnes / and of diverse errors and abuses spronge up and crept in to this
your graces realm. For certeynely if ye clerks of this your graces realm /
had been endowed with true knowleage of Gods word / and had also syncerely
preached the same / although such errors and blyndnes had entered into this
realm / yet they should never have so long contynewed in the same / but we
should have been delivered through the word clearly from them. As Christ
says. Io. viij.
If you continewe in my words / then are you my very disciples / and shall
know the truth / and the truth shall deliver you / and make you free.
Therefore most dread sovereign lord / saying yt all error / spyrytuall
blyndnes / miserable captyuite / and seruyle bondage unto sin comes for
lack of knowleage and sincere understanding in the holy scriptures / and of
ye contrary part / through ye knowleage and sincere understanding of the
holy scripturs we know god our father and his son Ihesus Christ our lord /
which is eternal liffe / we be also become free from all condempnation of
sin. Io^. v.
Io. xvij.
And through the sincere and true knowleage of ye word we be newly regenerate
and become ye childerne of god / the habitacle and dwellinge place of the holy
ghost / which moves and steareth us ever to mortefye the flesh / and all her
sinful lusts and concupiscence / to abhor and resyst vice. What is then so
necessary good and profitable for the christian people both spiritual and
cyuile wealth / as the word whereby we receive faith / and by faith the holy
ghost. What troubles all commen wealths / but treason / murder theft /
couetuousnes / adulterye / extorcion / whordome / dronckenes / periurye / and
such other sin / as says the holy ghost. Prouer. xiiij.
Justice and righteousness makes the people wealthy / but sin makes ye
people most miserable. And all these the faithful through ye true and sincere
understanding of gods word / do ever study and labor to overcome / and
utterly to abholyshe by faith. As Paul says. Gal. v.
They which be Christ's / do crucyfye the flesh with her lusts and
concupiscence. All good works and counceyles increased and stablyshed through
faith. There is no study / striffe / nor labor against sin but through
faith. All conscyences that be quiet from sins / only through faith be
made quiet. Romans v
As Paul says / Because we are iustyfyed by faith / we are at peace with god
through our lord Ihesus Christ. What counforte has any Christian man in
aduersytyes / temptacions / desperation / but only by faith in Gods word. The
Christyan man has no refuge nor help to resyst sin / but only by gods
word / as our savior christ did / wherein he must fyxe a sure and constant
faith. Mat..iiii.
Faith causes us and all ours / to be acceptable in ye sight of God. Roma.
xiiij.
For a conclusion / whatsoever is not of faith that same is sin. And wtowte a
constante and sure faith / it is impossyble to please God. Heb. xi.
All men may well perceive / that by the laws and by the just execution of
them / although sin may be for a time cohybyted and restrained / yet it can
not be suppressed and abholyshed / but only through faith. For there was never
more godly laws made for the punyshmente of sin / nor never more just and
godly executyon of laws admynistred / and yet there was never more sin
raygnynge. For cyuyle laws made by man / can not be of greater effycacye or
strength / nor work greater perfectyon virtue and good will in man / than the
law of god: but the law of God not only works no obedyence or virtue / but
rather through occasyo^ taken of the infirmyte of the flesh / steareth up
sin / as sayethe Paul. To. vij.
I know not what lust did mean / except the law had said thou shalt not
lust. But sin took an occasyon by the means of the commandemente / and
wrought in me all manner of concupiscence / for verily wtoute the law / sin
was dead. I ones says Paul / lived without law. But when the commandment came
/ sin reuyued / and I was dead / and ye very same commandment which was
ordained unto lyffe / was found to be unto me an occasyon of death. To. vij.
But now graciouse lord / for asmoche as it appears / yt the law of God
was not given to take away sin / but rather to declare and to punyshe sin:
much less any law made by man / can avoid and put away sin. But faith is
the true Instrument appointed by God / whereby sin is overcome and exiled.
Act. xv
As the scripture says / that God through faith / does puryfye and make
clean all hearts. Io. xv.
Also Christ sayethe / now are you clean / by the means of the words /
which I have spoken unto you. This faith shall cause / noryshe and bread /
true obeydyence / and all other virtues in your graces subjects hearts /
whereby they shall be enforced to labor not only to observe and keep Gods
laws / but also all your graces ordynances commandments and laws / without
grudge or murmuracyon. This faith as the Apostle says commethe by hearing
of Gods word preached / whereof Bishops Parsons / Vicars / and such other
called to have spiritual cure / be or should be dylygent mynisters / to whose
vocatyo^ justly parteyneth to declare and publyshe Gods word syncerely and
truly / to all the people committed to their spiritual charge. Romans x.
Most mighty Prince wherefore if the Pastors appointed to preach and teach
Gods word / wtin this your graces realm / do not dylige^tly instruct and
teach the people committed to their spiritual charge with the said word /
according as they be commanded in ye scriptures. Act. xx. i. Pe. v. Mal. ij.
Prove. xxix.
Act. xx. i. Pet. v. and Malache. xx. all kynde^ of sin shall increase and
abound / and the people utterly be devyded. As sayethe the holy ghost. When
ye word of God is not preached ye people perysheth. Also the Wise man sayethe.
Sa. xiij
All men be vain in whom there is not the knowleage of god. Wherefore without
any doubt ye wa^te and lack of preaching of gods word syncerely and truly
has been the very original ground and cause of all the insurrection /
co^motio^ / dyscention / which has risen or begone within this your graces
real me or any part thereof. For through the want of preaching of Gods word
syncely have entered in all popyshe blyndenes / vain and dead ceremonies /
me^nes tradycyons be crept into the conscyences of ye simple innocents in the
stead of the law of God. Yea ydolatrye and all hypocrysye with detestable
superstycyon for lack of ye light of Gods word / is become Gods service. And
yet notwtstandinge this want and lack of knowleage in Gods word and the
evil which co^methe manyfestly thereof / (the more it is to be lamented /)
there be many popish monckes which late were Abbottes (to whom not only
unworthily / but also unjustly / were geven great pensyons) and many of their
covent monks having another learning nor other godly qualytyes (apt meat or
convenyent to be in spiritual pastors) be now admytted to have cure of
souls. And some such which ded never know what is a soul / nor yet be able
to have cure over one soul / be now admytted to have charge over an hundredth
and many moo / to the increase of all yngnora^cye and all popish blyndnes /
the high way and means to let in all kind of sin / to the utter
dampnacion of all the souls committed to their spiritual charge. Alas do
another ye patrones of such benefyces / nor yet the incumbentes po^der or
regard Gods threatenyngs by his Prophet Ezechiell saying / As truly as I
live says the lord for as much as my sheep are robbed and deuowred of the
wild beasts of the field having no shepeherde / and seeing that my
shepherdes take no regard of my sheep / but feade them selves only / and not
my sheep. Ezech. xxxiiij.
Therefore here the word of the lord o ye shepherdes / thus says the lord
God. Behold I my self will upon the shepherdes / and require my sheep from
their hands / and make them cease from feadinge of my sheep. Yea the
shepherdes shall feade them selves no more / for I will deliver my sheep owte of
their mowthes / so that they shall not devour them after this. If this
threatenynge be not suffycient warning and monycion to such blind shepherdes
/ yet at the lest let them fear Gods curse pronownced in the same chapter
against such neglygent and ingnora^t shepherdes / saying. Woo be to the
shepherdes of Israel that feade them selves / should not the shepherdes feade
the flock / you have eaten up the fatt / you have clothed you with the wolle /
the best fedd have you flayne / but the flock have you not noryshed / heaven
and earth shall much rather perish / than these words wherewith God
threatened such pastors shall be found untrue / That is / I will require my
flock of the hands of the shepherde. Suerly most mighty prince it is to busye
an office / tomuche and laborouse for one spiritual shepherde (although he
were very expert and conning) to guide order / and keep / two or three flocks
of sheep / specially being so far dysta^t one from an other / that the said
shepherde can not be daily present with them / to se the governaunce of them /
whose nature is daily to fall into diverse offenses and spiritual dyseases.
For the office of a good shepherd is not only to feade his sheep in good
pasture / but also to seek the lost sheep / to call again the strayed sheep in
to the right way / to salve and to make hole ye broken which is broken by
aduersyte / the weak and sick sheep in the faith / with the counfortable
promyses of God / declared in the gospel / to make strong and constant: and
in co^clusyon to adventure his liffe (if need require) for the defense of his
sheep / ever circu^specte lyeng in wait / to resyst the roringe lion / which
never slepeth / goinge abowte and seakynge whom he may devour. i. Pe. v.
Such I say should be their diligence and daily cure over their flock showed
/ that not only their sheep / but also all other / seeing and preceyvinge their
great pains and labors sustained and taken for the help and counforte of
their sheep / the gentle entertayninge with all pacyence / humylyte and meakenes
/ the fatherly love / cure / and affeccion which the said bishops and other
Pastors should daily show / exercise and practyse toward Christ's flock
committed to their spiritual charge shall judge them not only good shepherdes
which enter in by the door / but also shall receive and take the^ to be most
gentle / prouyde^t kind / and lovinge spiritual fathers. But most prudent
gouernoure how shall this fatherly cure / love / zeal / and affection / be
showed by the pastoure to his spiritual sheep which daily cowcheth and
wayteth in your graces householde and court / and in other noble and
worshipful me^nes howses / attendinge to please me^ which is called only to
serve God. And not wtstandinge his calling to be a shepherde to feade Christ's
flock / yet he will sease se and visyte them ones in the year. And when he
visyteth his sheep / what ghostely council he geveth them / God knows. But
for the more part / he looks more to his own profett than to their wealth.
Alas the ambicyouse appetyte and burning covetuouse desire of the yearly
co^modyties / profettes and advauntages of the benefyces / has utterly
extynguyshed and supped up the spiritual love / zeal and affection which
ought to be in the spiritual shepherdes. So that now it is strange and
wonderful to se or know one justly to execute his office. Is this the
honowre of any King or of any other gouernowre / that under the cloak and
color of his service / a Byshope or Pryste called to seade the flock of
Christ / shall leave the same untaught / and so transgress the commandment
of Christ for the pleasure of men? Have not Kings and other rulers sufficyent
to endowe their chapelaynes / without retayninge such which have received
lyuinge and stypende to be in their churches feadinge Christ's flock. This is
tomoche dishonor to the higher powers / against gods commandment and
word to retain an other man's servant. But certainly although your highness or
other rulers would another call nor retain such ambyciouse blind guydes and
couetouse pastors / yet they their self will by their fryndes make
importunate suit and labor to be in service with your majesty and with
other rulers. The cause is this / (one inconuenyence granted / many follow.
Anno. xxi. He^rici. viij
There is alawe made in this your noble realm / that all spiritual parsons of
your counsel may have three benefyces with cure. And all the chaplaynes of
the King / queen / prince / princes or of any of the Kings children / brethren
/ sisters / uncles and auntes / may have license to have two benefyces with
cure. Every Duke / marquis / earl / vycounte / archebysshope / bysshope / with
diverse other estates as well men as women may have two chaplaynes which may
have two benefyces with cure / And also diverse other degres of scole may have
every one two benefyces with cure / so that over one of his cures although he
take the profyttes yet from that he must neades be no resydent and
peradventure to both he will be no feader nor teacher. And also in the same
estatute all attendaunce in the court and all other atte^daunces upon such
noble and worshipful men which be lycenced to have chaplaynes may be not
resydent / yea pilgrims in ye time of going and coming from their
pilgrimage be by that estatute dyspenced to be non resydent. O lord where was
ye light of thy word / which should have been written in the hearts of the
makers of ye estatute. If there had been godly shepherdes which had dyligently
executyd their office and calling / we had never wandered so blyndely to agree
or consent to the making of any such estatute. Do we which think us
Christen men esteame spiritual benefyces to be nothing else but lyvinges to be
given at owre pleasure to prystes for service done? Is not the benefyce given
in respect of a spiritual office to be executyd and done? Does not God
command straytely shepherdes to feade their flock dyligently? Can man or any
law made by man dyspence with Gods commandment? O lord in thy hands be the
hearts of all Kings and other rulers / enlyghten their hearts lord with the
light of thy word that they may know and see this pestylent ill blyndenes /
which so long has caused thy sheep to wander in darckenes. And when they
perceive it they may have grace and time to reform the same to thy glory and
the help of this realm. And I shall ever desyer of God and wish in my heart
to all such as be called to be attendaunte nere your magestie and all other
gouernowres / that for any carnal love / favor / or affectyon which they
bear to any man for kyndred / frendshipe / luker / or otherwise / they do not
make any such ungodly suytes petycions or requests to your highness or to any
other gouernowre for any parson to be admytted to any office other spiritual
or temporal / whom they do not certeynly know by most certain and sure
proves and witnesses / to be apt / meat / and conuenyent as well in learning
as in condycions / to exercise use and to occupye such office and rome /
whereunto he by such their suit made / should be called / appointed and
admytted (not only for the shame rebuke and troble which upon dew
examynacion had and found contrary to their untrue suit) might come and grow
to them / but also for the evil incommodyte and pestilent myschef which shall
ensewe to all such which shall be committed to his or their governance and
charge. Alas that ever amongst the christen flock should be known or seen
that such office which in Christ's church should be the most godly / most
necessary / most spiritual and most profitable both to the body and soul /
now is become a worldely honowre / a lordely dygnyte / a rich carnal proud
lyuinge estate and countenance / and the possessor thereof having only the
name of a spiritual minyster / but no virtue nor godly qualyte which of right
ought to be in every such minister. If this be well pondered and remembered
most merciful gouernowre / it is most to be lamented. But seeing this blyndnes
has so long co^tynewed and somoch ewill has ensewed and followed thereof in
the defaulte of godly postours / it is not only needful above all things to
be circu^spect in choosing ernestly cried / expecte / and well learned ministers
to preach Gods word syncerely / but also to compel the same to be demurante
abydinge and resydent upon their cures. And all such which be crepte into
benefices for luker and advantage upon untrue suggestion and false feigned
suits made / which can not or do not feade their flock / to depryue the^ of
such benefyces because they other can not or do not execute the office to
that belonginge. Suerly no wise man lyghteth a ca^dell and puts him under a
bushel. And if he set up a ca^dell (which other for lack of talowe or for
other cause can not give light) shortly he takes him down and putethe an
other which can give good light in his place. So all godly wise men will order
all spiritual lights which in deed can not give godly light for lack of
spiritual grace which should be in them. For Bishops and other Pastors which
be chosyne and instytuted contrary to the ordinance appointed and prescribed
by Gods word / which other do not or can not execute the office perteyninge
to his or their calling / be not godly and true Bishops but rather Images and
Idolles having and bearinge only the name and outward appearance of a
Bishop or Pastor. But as concerning the learning virtue and other godly
qualyties which parteyne and be of great necessyte and justice requysyte to
be in every godly pastor / they have nothing less. For if Christ (which said
to Peter from henceforthe I make the a fysher to catch men) do not endowe ye
offycer with learning / grace / power and good will to preach his word before
Patrons present him to any such spiritual office / the elect and admytted
notwithstanding the admyssion and Patrons presentment / Joan. x
shall contynually abide and remain an hypocryte / and such one which does
not enter in by the door / Math. xxij.
but presumes to enter withowte a wedding garment / whom Christ condempneth
to owtwarde darckenes / and also callethe him a thef / whose reward withowte
doubt / shall be at the day of the last judgment with thefes / if he repent
not and reasygne up his office which he can not execute fulfill and perform.
Wherefore I mystruste not but that all such which have power to present and to
admytte their clerks to spiritual offices reading this well book for the
dyscharge of their conscience and for the glory of God / the commodyte and
vtylite of the common wealth (which will ensewe the godly presentacyon and
admyssion of well learned / approved and godly clerckes to spiritual offices)
will from thenceforthe apply and conform them to the form and manner of
electyon of spiritual mynisters appointed prescrybed and lymytted by Gods
word / which is this. That every man chosyn to use any spyrituall office /
should be first well proved as well for their learning as also for their other
virtuous condycions. First for their learning wherewith they must not only be
able to enstructe and teach the people committed to their spyrytuall charge /
but also able to reprove other which resyst the same doctrine / with many other
godly qualyties. As it apperethe in the first Epistle of Paul to Tymothe and
also to Tyte. Tim. iij Tyt. i.
Now most mighty defender of the Christyan religyon / saying that Godds word
has prescrybed and declared that every man which shall be called and appointed
to be a spyrituall mynister must first be proved and known how godly and
spirytually he has instruct and teached the people / what learning he has
in the scriptures / and not in the laws / to reprove errors and to condemn
heresies. What pains he has taken in preaching Gods word / and also
whether he has given good example of lyuinge according to his doctrine. In
this manner every christian ought to prove his clerk before he other present or
admytt him. But now also most benyngne lord / co^sydre of the contrary part
and remember for what causes the Kings your noble progenitors in times paste
have chosen Bysshopps / and other patrons have presented their clerckes to
personagyes and Vicaragyes to have cure of sowles. These both causes well
considered no man will greatly meruell that we have wandered so long in
blyndenes. For in times paste Kings have given their Bysshoprycks to their
Councellers / chaplaynes which have been daily attendauntes in ye court /
which also have done to them good service / as enbasadoures / or to such which
have taken pains in their householde / as amners and deanes of ye chapel /
clercks of their closett and such other officers / where gods word does not
approve any byshopricke to be given to any man for any such service done / or
for any such pains taken / but only for ye gift which he has from God to
preach his word / and for ye pains and labors sustained in preachinge of
the said word And as Kings in times paste have abused their gifts of
byshoprikes / so noble men and worshipful me^ as well of ye clergy as of ye
layere have abused their presentacio^s to their prebe^des personages and
vicarages / giving the^ to their chaplaynes / or to other for kyndred in blood
or for alyaunce / or else to such as have been surueyours of their lands /
receyuoures of their rentes / stuardes of their household / faconers /
gardyners or to such other whom they favor for such worldely service and
qualyties. To such they give their benefyces as rewards or wagies to
hyrelynges for such service done / or to be done / having little or no
regard to the great charge and spiritual cure which by Gods word belongs
to all such spiritual offices. For Kings and rulers in times paste had no
less knowleage of any thing / then of Gods word which the subtle bishops
and crafty prystes were ever studiouse and desyrouse to keep secret from the
higher powers. For so long as Gods word was kept secret and hyde^ from
governors / so long ye clergy did lead not only the Kings / but also all
gouernowres and the commons whyther they would. This was the crafty polycye of
the clergy / to keep ye knowleage of Gods word from all men / that they might
unlawfully and unworthily be promoted to spiritual cures / and use the
profettes of them ungodly / and that they might also contynually exercise their
lusts and iniquyties. As Paul says They be against all men forbyddinge us
to speak to the people whereby they might be saved / The.ij.
that they might fulfill their iniquyte and sin contynually. Have not some of
the bishops with their retynewe at this day practysed their old polycy to
extinguyshe ye light through all England / that they might ones again lead
us quyetly in darckenes. Is not there a law made through their craft and
subtylte which gives power to certain co^myssioners whereof the bishops
chaunceler or co^myssarye shall be named to be two of the co^myssioners / which
shall have full power to take into their custodye all such books wherein is
contained any clause or article repugnaunte to any of the syx artycles / and ye
same books to burn and dystroye as to the discretion of three of them shall be
thought expedyent. Mark well what they purpose by this estatute. Are there
any books which write against the popes prymacie / but they also write
against some of the syx artycles? Their color is to take away all books
which write against the syx artycles / but their very inte^te purpose and
meaning is to take away all books which conteyne any godly learning that
write against ye bishop of Romes prymacy. How cruelly do the bishops punyshe
all the^ which pretend to have learning and specially in Godds word? Such
they call heretyques and persecute which putting them to open shame / with
enprysonme^te / and in conclusyo^ with death most fearful and paynefull. All
this they do to dyscorage all men from the study of Gods word / fearinge
least that by such studiouse brains which learn Gods word and publyshe the
same their iniquyte should be made manifest. What study and pains they take
to keep ye light from the people. But no man which knowethe ye scriptures will
meruell of this their policye and crueltye. Io^. iij.
For saint Johan declarethe their practyse plainly saying. He that does evil
hates the light / and why? because his works which be evil should not be
reproved by the light. And for as much as our bishops countenance of lyuinge
/ their great possessions / and lordely domynyons in them agrees with Godds
word / as death with lyffe / God with the devil / light with darckenes /
therefore they hate ye light which declarethe the same / and study to suppress
the same by all chaft and polycye. And saying they can so craftily iuggle and
have such frendshipe and fououre to convey / bring to pass / that all books
shall come into their hand and under the color of the syx artycles / it is
to be feared that shortly they will by like craft subtylte and frendshipe
procure the Bible in English to be taken from the layete / and then we shall be
ledd in darcknenes by our Bishops and other blind gydes and not Pastoures at
their pleasure and will / which is the effect of all their study labor and
purpose. Now most valeaunt defender of Christ / it appearethe plainly how
many myseryes we be wrapte in / through the ungodly electyon of such as be
admytted to have spirytuall cure and office to teach Godds word / which not
only have little learning / but also they be enemies to all men which can and
do preach Gods word sycerely and trewly / because they live contrary to the
same / as I have before declared / And this is the origynall grownde / and
cause of the abundaunce and increase of darkness and of sin / as also of the
long contynnaunce of popish blyndnes which has reigned in this realm so
long. Wherefore if the bishops and other elected and appointed to be shepherdes
according to their vocacyon and calling / be not first known and well
proved to have such knowleage and godly doctrine / so that they can and also
do instantely and dylige^tly preach Gods word, which is ye light expellinge
all darckenes of sin / then must needs sin increase and abound without
any restraynte or bridle. For if the light which is amongst you be darckenes
/ how much shall the darkness be? Matt. vi.
Your grace and your cyuile power do punnyshe sin / when it is done and
committed / according to the justice of laws / as to your vocatyon and office
of right belongethe to do. But the office and duty of the Pastor is to
preach Gods word / whereby he shall convert the heart of the sinner / which
is willinge and dissposed to do sin / so that he shall not break fourth to
do sin in the act / which ye cyuyle power for the example of other by
equity and justice is bound to punyshe. Therefore the dyligent executyon of the
office of the pastoure shall be the pryncipall mean and occasyon that less
sin shall be committed / and so the higher powers shall have less occasyon to
execute the extreme justice of laws / and consequently many men's ly^es which
now for lack of the knowleage of Gods word should be lost for co^myttinge
murder / felonye / and such other offenses / shall then be preserved that they
shall not commytte such offenses / which the higher powers by the laws of
equity and justice be compelled to co^dempne and to punyshe with death.
Wherefore ye godly tranquyllyte rest and peace of all this your realm
soueraygne lord / and the good order of the same hangs and rests much
upon the godly and dyligent executyon of the office of pastors and of the
spiritual shepherds dewly called and admytted according to Gods word.
Therefore it behooves the presenter of the clercke to a benefyce and cure of
sowles to be cyrcumspect and well ware what clerk he does present / and that
he have good knowleage experience and prove of his clercke before he present
him. For if a pastor do not feade the flock of Christ committed to his
charge / the death of their sowles shall be required of his hands. As the
Prophet Ezechiell says in the.xxxiij. Ezech. xxxiij.
chapi. And if the patron willingely / other for kyndred / favor /
frendshippe / service or money / present a clerk which he knows not to be so
learned in Gods word / that he be able to instruct and teach the people
committed to his charge both with the law of God and with the gospel / every
such patron co^senteth to the death and da^pnacion of the sowles committed to
the charge of such unlearned priest. And therefore such a Patron shall also be
punyshed with like pain / which is eternal / as the Apostell says. Romans i.
Not only they that do evil / but also they which consent thereunto shall be
punyshed with like pain. What wise man living would hyer a shepherde to
govern his beastly and worldly sheep which another would nor could feade /
handle / salve nor ones see his sheep committed to his charge. Such a wise
shepherde would shortly make his masters profet come to little advantage.
Surely a wise man would chose no such shepherde. And if he were deceived
through the persuasyon of some of his friends / yet when he has proved that
he has no conning nor dyligence / he will shortly dyscharge him of his cure
and service. Shall we be esteemed christen men which have more tender love and
affectyon to owre corruptyble profett / than we have to the honowre of God and
the eternal wealth of ye immortal sowles of owre christen brethren / whom
Good commands to love as owre self. Io. xxi.
Christ ded not commytt to Peter the cure and charge of his sheep before he
asked thryse of Peter whether he loved him. As who should say. I would not
commytt my best beloved Ioywell and treasure unto the / unless thowe love me
heartily. I would wyshe that all gouernowres and rulers in this case would take
example and follow Christ which knowing ye Good will of Peter's heart / yet as
one ingnora^te thereof ded demand this question of Peter before he ded co^mytt
ye cure of his flock to him / thereby to give example and common doctrine to
all his faithful folowers yt they should have such tender and fervent love
toward the Christen sowles / that they would not commytt the governance and
cure of them to any man / but unto such of whom they have prove and sure
knowleage / that as well by their preachinge and sincere teachinge of Gods word
/ as also by their virtuous lyuinge co^sonante to ye same word they had
unfeignedly a faithful hearty love toward Christ's flock. A blind eye which
can not dyrecte and lead the body is a blemyshe and a burden to the natural
body / and no commodyte. In likewise a man chosen to be a spyrytuall Pastor
which has not the knowleage and grace to preach the law and the gospel /
is but a blind eye not able to dyrecte and lead the spyrytuall body.
Wherefore if any patro^ chose any such ingnora^te man to be a pastoure / a
spiritual eye and light to lead the spiritual sowles / he not only
deceyueth them but also asmoche as lies in him kyllethe the body / and does
great iniurye to Christ's blood. Now it may please yowre highness to note and
mark what myschef and inco^uenyence follow the electyon and admyssion of an
ingnorante postour. First if an ingnorante byshope in Gods word be admytted /
he can not execute his office because he knows not the scryptures which
teaches him what should perteyne to his own office. And as the bishop is
ignorante in Gods word / so he admytteth such as be unlearned in Gods word /
evyn such as by no possybylite can execute the office of their calling. Idle
parsons / unhappy / dronckerdes / swerers / common players at all vnthryftye
games / in whom there is no chastyre / no humylyte / justice / nor temperance.
For a conclusion / such they admytte in whom there is no holiness / godly
doctrine / nor good example of lyuinge. To such they commytte ye health of
sowles / the flock of Christ dearly bought with his blood / by such idle
and wicked harlottes the enheritaunce of Christ is trodden under foot. All
evil condycions manners and doctrynes by them be tawght / so that in the stead
of holy scripture is crepte in the doctrine of lies / all superstycions / dead
and vain ceremonies / and license to do all kind of sin. Some of the
blind ignorante prestes teach the people that God is honowred / and souls
releued of their pains through the rynginge of belles / painting of posts /
and setting up tapers and candelles before the said posts / who^ the blind
prestes do both sense and spryncle with holy water. An other sort of blind
shauelings teach the people to get heaven with tastynge / this prescripte day
and that day / with trentalles and masses of scala celi / with forbearinge of
bodily works and kepinge idle holy days / they preach much holiness and Gods
service to stand in their holy oil / holy cream / holy water / holy ashes /
hallowed bedes / mumblynge of a number of psalms in laten / keapinge of church
ales in the which with leappynge / daunsynge / and kyssyng they maynteyne the
profett of their church (to the honor of God as they both say and thyncke.)
And thus the blind leads the blind / that both fall hedlonge into the lake
of eternal brenninge fire. What natural heart is there which will not
lamente the misery / yea the dampnacio^ most certe^ly thretenede by Gods word
unto all ingnorante and neglygent bysshopps and other spyrytuall shepherdes
which do not dylygently execute their office and vocation? What honest louinge
heart does not bewail the habundaunce of sin / the long miserable blyndnes
wherein this realm has been ledd and wrapped in through the yngnorancye and
negligence of such blind guydes. But is there any christen heart which can
forbere contynuall syghinge and morning / remembringe the multitude yea the
infynyte number of sowles (which without the great mercy of God passinge all
his worckes) through ingnorancye and negligence of such blind shepherdes / be
utterly cast away and dampened. What good cyuyle heart would not I say lament
and bewail the great burden wherewith this your realm (gracious lord) is
ouercharged through the great multitude of chauntery prestes / soul prestes /
chanons / resydensaryes in chathedrall churches / prebendaryes / muncke
pencyons / morrow mas prestes / unlearned curattes / prestes of gyldes and of
fraternytees or brotherhedes / rydinge Chaplaynes / and such other idle
parsons / which if they be well noted / and also what fruit spryngethe of them
indyffere^tly valewed / considered / and pondered / it will appear manyfestly
to all reasonable and godly wits / that they do bring no manner commodyte
profett or vtylyte other spyrituall or temporal to this your publycke wealth.
No / no / they be not only no commodyte nor profett to the common wealth /
but rather much hynderance. And truly no little wasters / spoylers / and
robbers / and that of the most poor / in dyge^t and neadye of your louinge
subjects / which be most craftily / subtelly / and vnrightuousely depryued of
ye charytable succoure and alms of many simple unlearned innocents / through a
vain hope and false confydence that their sowles should be releued and
released of their pains and torments dew for their sins / when they be
departed this world / by the long prayers of prestes. And (the more it is to
be lamented) no little nombre of your subjects through such ungodly trust
and confydence in masses and dyryges to be song and celebrated for them when
they be dead / be greatly encoraged to live both wickedly toward God / and
also vnfrutefully toward the world / little remembrynge and estemynge their
vocacion and calling wherein God has appointed them to walk / and much less
the extreme necessyte of their christen brethren. This vain hope in the
long prayers of prestes (no doubt graciouse lord) is a great occasyon of
much pouerte amongst the poor and neady of this yowr realm. For the spedy
remedy of this pouerte amongst your louinge subjects / and the utter
suppression of such vain hope in ye prayers of prestes to be made for your
subjects when they be dead / which is the great cause of this miserable
pouerte / it may please your majesty of your accustomed goodness to call to
your graciouse remembrance that all the people of this your regyon be subject
unto yowr gracious power / rule / and dominion as unto their supreme hedd and
gouernowre dewly by God appointed to govern them only during their natural
lives / but when it pleases God to take their sowles out of this miserable
world / than yowr grace is dyscharged of all governance / cure and charge over
the^ / as of such which after their death do not appertain to yowr grace /
nor be of your Kyngedome / but only of ye Kyngedome of God, under his
governance prouysion and rule. Into the which Kyngedome another your grace nor
no other erthely prince may lawfullye usurp or take any rule prouisyon care
or governance, for the souls entered thereunto. Seeing that your grace have no
auctoryte nor power over the souls departed, you be not only dyscharged to
govern to care or to provide for them being dead, but much rather to
provide that they may not be deceyuedde so under the color of long prayer,
but that they may be taught syncerelye GODS word while they be living under
your subjection so that they may believe constantelye and live godly, and
then by Christ's promise bell gates shall not prevail against them, much
less they shall have any neade of such strange succoure and help of men,
nothing appoyntedde nor taught by Gods word to be profitable or necessary
fortheyre souls after their death. Wherefore I mystruste not butte that your
majesty when you shall next entreat for the reformation of the enormytyes
and abuses spronge^ up in the christenne religion, you will godly reform
such abuse and dissembled^^ couetousenes, and certeynelye being to godly
remedy nor help for sowles departed which has no strength nor effycacye
of GODS word, which is the very true foundation of all the Christen
religion and help for souls. And in the mean season I do no less thyncke
and also pray hartelye to GOD that your majesty will provide and make
ordinance, that all such lands and possessions whereupon so many idle
hypochrytes and deceyuers be great burdeyne and charge to your realm, which
hitherto have lived ungodly and vnprofytablely, may from henceforthe be
partelye converted to the supportation and mayntenaunce of common stools,
whereby erroures crepte up through ingnorance may be through knoweledge
repressedde, and godly learning and knowledge more plenteouslye planted and
admynistred and partelye that your poor loving subjects may be more
mercyfullye releued and succored, while they live under your subjection
charge and governance. This godly dystrybution (most prudent Soueraygne) of
the lands and possessions ordeynedde and appoyntedde for the comfort succors
and help of yowre poor loving and living (...), is much more consonante
and agreeable to GODS word and more certain dyscharge of your graces
conscience then to suffer the same possessions to be ungodly cast away and
consumed under such false colowre and pretense to releue sowles departed, of
whom your majesty have another cure nor charge, nor can not assure to them by
Gods word through such long prayers of prestes relesse of pains after
their death, or any other aid comfort or succoure. For without any doubt
(gracious Lord) if such hyredde prayers had been godly and necessary for
the sowles departedde, other Christ or his Apostelles would have taughts it,
or at the least have praised or practisedde it, and not so manifestlye reproved
and thretened it, saying. Marc. xii.
Beware of them which devour wyddowes howses under color of long prayerres,
their judgment shall be much longer. In all the new Testamente there is no
mencyonne made of any such offycer nor office institutedde nor appoyntedde to
pray for the dead. And yet all men I thyncke will confess that the truethe
of GODS word was most syncerelye setforthe and preached in the time of
Christ and of his Apostelles, in whose time there was no such craftye
learning publyshedde nor taught by them, nor long time after.

But then men stablyshedde and grounded their religion and hope of health
upon Gods word, which teachethe us that who so beleuethe is saved and has
no neade of long prestyshe prayers, and who so beleuethe not, shall be
condemned. Between these extreme contraries there is no mean, as saint
Augustine sayethe. Note here. s. August in his book entyteled Hypognostico^,
fol. ix.
Wherefore I exhort all them (which contrary to all holy scriptures) trust to
the third place and there to have release of pains through the song prayers
of preastes, that they would give over such feigned fantasye of men (subtly
ymagyned only through insaciable couetousenes of ambiciouse prestes to get
money (therewythe to mayneteyne their ungodly lusts, and to live ydlely and
delycately and to trust rather to the sure and infallyble trewethe of Gods
word, which without doubt is to repent and believe, and utterly to forsake
all sin, and than constantelye to trust to Gods promise of mercy. Here
manifestly apperethe soueraygne Lord, in what miserable blyndenes the most
part of this your realm have long time be led, yea and almost drowned
through the long custom used therein. Who is it that can not lamente (I say)
this deplorate and miserable sort of blind shepherdes? Be not they boughte
with the same price wherwythe wede bought to be members of one body whereof
Christ is head. If we be members of one body certeynlye we can not then but
cast and feale not only their evil, but also the lamentable estate of all
other cast away through the Lord I trust the punishment is pa^^e wherwithe
thou hall threatened the world to be punishedde with hunger and christ not
with hunger and thryste of bread and drink, Amos. viii.
but for lack of hearing thy word. Yt is now time lord to show thine
accustomedde goodness and mercy, for the which we do daily and hartelye
pray, saying. Through the tender mercy of God wherwithe he has dysyred
us, Luce. i
give light to us which fyfte in darckenes and in the shaddowe of death, to
guide our (...) into the way of peace.

Also it is a daungerouse thing to admit one to be aspyrytuall pastoure
whose professyon and study all his youth has been in decrees and popyshe
laws. For such a study for the most part ingenderethe a popyshe heart. If
any such be admittedde to be a pastoure, he shall not only other se^^e^ely
in confession or by some other craftye means, poison his flock with man's
tradicions and popyshe doctrine, but all shall augmente the popish power,
forth abrogacion whereof your grace and your honorable counsel have taken
great pains and travail.

Now eftsoon I trust that all men which read this little book shall perceive
thereby what inconuenyence and dampnable evil enseweth the ungodly
presentacyon and admyssyon of the unlearned in Gods word, and carnal
prestes to spiritual offices. And although such Patrons have little zeal and
love to the common and publyke wealth, yet for the synguler and carnal love
which they bear to their clerks (whom they addycte and bind surely to
eternal dampnacion, if they give them such spyrytuall offices, which they
neither can nor will excute and perform or for the tender zeal and love
which they have to the souls so derely boughte with Christ's blood, they
will with all circumspection prou etheyr clerks that they be not only well
learned in Gods word but that they also have taken great pains in
preaching the fame, and that they have also (...) according to their
preaching. Such experyment and prove was commanded to be made of weddowes,
before they were (...) to live upon the charge of the congregacyon. As it
appearethe in Tymotheye.

i. Ti. v.
Much more than euydente and sure prove of Pastoures (whose office is so
necessary) should be had and made before they be admyttedde to their
spyrytuall office and charge. And although the election of the Bishop and
of other spyrytuall Pastors in every paynte be had and done according as I
have before written, yet (most dread soueraygne Lord) I see two foul
deformyties and great lamentable myschefes annexed to the vocacyon and office
of Bysshoppes, which not refourmedde will poison and utterly corrupt the
godly vocacyon and electyon of the said Bishops. The one infection and
pestylente poysonne is there great Lordeshyppes and domynions with the
yearly prouentes of the same. Which has so fasshynonedde them in proud
countenaunces and worldelye behauoure, that now they be most like to the
Heathen Princes and most unlike unto Christ, although they would be
esteamedde of al men to be his true successoures, yet poor Christ sayethe.
The foxes have hooles, the birds of the air have nestes, but the son of man has not wherein to lay his head. But our Bishops have gorgeouse and
sumptuouse builded howses manners and castelles pleasauntelye set about with
parches well replenished with dear, warrens (...) full of conyes, and fysshe
pooles well scored with diverse kinds of fysshes. And not only these
commoddities and pleasures, but also diverse other pleasures.

How this Lordely and worldely Bishop like estate agrees with Christ's
words, I think a man can not reasonablye conyecture or ymagen by their
countenance and living, that they be Christ's true disciples. The other
myschefe and evil is that they have to many worldly c^res and busynes. For to
these manners and Lordeshyppes belong many tenauntes, for whose leases to be
made fynes and haryottes to be appoyntedde and taken, a mercyamentes to be
affessed taxed and also forgeuen and dispencedde, there be no few suits made
to my Lord Bishop, also the hearing of testamentorye causes, dyuorses,
causes of matrymonye, of sclaunders, of (...), adulterye, and punyshement of
(...), and such other (...) court matters* Whereof not one belong to his
office and vocacion appointed by Gods word. My lord bishop is so occupied
and vnquycted, that he has no leisure to study nor to preach GODS word.
But such affairs and worldelye busynes nothing perteyneynge to his vocation
be (...) great hynderance and let to my lord Bishop that he can not apply
him to exercise his own office. Mat. v
For no man can serve two masters says Christ. The Apostles thought it not
just and equal to provide for the necessary lyuinge of the poor / leauinge
Godds word vntawght. Act. vi.
But my lord Bishop doing these things nothing perteyninge to his office /
thincketh that he has exactely done his office. From these great manners
comes yearly great rentes pleasures and profettes / which althowghe they be
the good creatures of God / yet thabundaunce of them (being where they be more
impedyment than help) be a great occasyon of corrupcion in the vser of them.
And peradventure they would allure and intyse a Bishops heart to trust in the^
and so corrupt him / as the scripture says. Blessed is the rich which is
found withowt blemyshe and has not gone after gold nor hoped in money and
treasures / where is there such a one and we shall commend him and call him
blessed / for great things does he among his people. And if my lord
Bishop should give the superfluyte of his goods to the poor (whose goods
justly they be) as the Prophet Ezay sayethe / Esa. iij.
Than my lord should lack the^ to furnyshe his lordely countenance / and so
my lord should loose his lordely honor and praise of the world Wherefore as
these superfluouse possessions be annexed to estates of Bishops by man's vain
fantasye and not by Gods word / so my lord Bishop will other keape them to
make him more fryndes / remembrynge that riches makethe many fryndes / but the
poor is forsaken of his neyghbowre / or deuyse the exspence of them contrary
to Gods word / other to make sure fryndes in the court about ye king to
obtain more promocions and benefices / or in curiouse buyldinge / sumptuouse
and delycate fare / well appareled servants / tryme decked horses to ride
pompeousely like a lord. Although there were no auctorite to prove this / yet
the lordely countenance and fasshyon of bishops / yea their common exercise
and also practyse ca^ well prove and testyfye this plainly before the face of
all men which knows the lordelynes of bysshopps. As the Prophet Ezay
sayethe. Esa. iij.
The chaungynge of their countenance bewrays them / yea they declare their
own sins them selfs as sodomytes / and hyed them not. Do not these things
fayntely agree with the saying of their predecessor Paul the Apostle which
says. i. Ti. vi.
When we have food and raymente we must be contented. Is not this lordely
honor dyrectely against Christ's words / which sayethe. Iu. xxij.
The Kings of nacyons raygne over them / and they that have auctoryte over
them are called graciouse lords. But you shall not be so. Also Peter speakethe
to his true successoures saying. Feade you Christ's flock as much as lies
in you / taking the ouersyght of them not as compelled thereunto / but
wyllyngelye / after a godly sort / nor for the desyer of fylthy luker / but of
a good mind / not as though you were lords over the paryshes / but that
you be an example to the flock / and that with good will. But owre lordely
Bishops estate and proud countenance of living (as it is now used) is
contrary to Gods word / as it appearethe by these words. But you shall not
be so. And also by these sayengs. Not as though you were lords over the
paryshes. Math. xij.
And Christ sayethe. He that is not with me / is against me. Wherefore so
long as they reign so lordely in the clergy contrary to Godds word / so
long be they against God. And so long as they be against God / they be not
sent from God / and then can they not preach trewly and syncerely his morde.
For how can they preach except they be sent says Paul. Romans x.
Christ was sent to preach as it appearethe. Marc. i. Luce. iiij. and Ezaye.
lxi. And Christ says to all his true dysciples. As my father sent me / so
I do send you. Joan. ij
And commands also all his Apostles and true successors of the Apostles to
preach the gospel to the holle world and not lordely to reign in the
clergy. Whom Paul teaches to be as mynisters / saying. Let a man this wise
esteame us / even as the mynisters of Christ and the stuardes of the secrets
of God. i. Cor..iiij.
To preach the gospel therefore (most gracious and prudente lord) is the
true vocacyon and office of all godly Bishops / Parsons / Vycars and of other
shepherdes / and not to be enbasadowrs to princes / nor to be judges to here
matters of contencyon / testamentarye causes / dyuorses / selaunders / bawdery
/ and such other. Your grace has of your lay fee suffycient both in
lerninge and wisdom and of good conscience to here and judge such causes and
varyaunces / remyttynge Bishops to attend their office and vocacyon by God
(and not by man) appointed. And therefore they should not excercyse any other
office than God has appointed to them. Mat. vi
For no man can serve two masters. And if Bishops and other Pastoures would
dyligently execute their vocacyon and office / much fewer of these matters of
contencyon shall be in ure and experience other to be hard or judged. Saying the
scriptures commands so ernestly every man to walk as he is called. Many
Christen men meruell greatly why the Bishops desire and procure so greadely to
exercise the office perteyninge to an other vocacyon / and to leave their
vocacyon and office (appointed by God to them to be exercysed) not executed nor
performed and done. Ioa^. ix.
Verily because they love the glory of men / more then the glory of God. And
surely even as Cayphas and Annas being Bishops and exercysynge the office of
seculer and temporal judges ded judge Christ to be crucified / so owr Bishops
so long as they contrary to their calling do exercise the^ office of
temporal judges / so long shall they persecute Christ and his members / and
study to suppress his word / and not to preach the same. Have not they
busynes suffycyent wherewith to occupye them in their own office? If they would
look well thereunto / do not they see on every side detestable sin reign
throughowt all this your realm. Is there not such excess and costelynes of
apparel / because of dyuersyte and change of fasshyons that scarce a
worshipful man's lands which in times paste was wont to find and maynteyne
twenty or thirty tall powemen / a good plentyfull howsholde for the releyfe and
counforce of many poor and neadye / and the same now is not suffycyent and
able to maynteyne the heir of ye same lands / his wiffe / her gentle woman or
maid / two yowmen / and one lackey. The pryncypall cause hereof is their costly
apparel / and specially their manyfolde and diverse chaunges of fasshyons
which the man and specially the woman must wear upon both headde and body.
Sometime cappe / sometime hoode / now the frenshe fasshyon / now the spanyshe
fasshyon / than the Italyan fasshyon / and then the myllen fasshyon / so that
there is no end of consumynge of substance and that vaynely and all to
please the proud folyshe man and women's fantasye. Hereof spryngethe great
myserye and neade. The fathers consumynge their goods in vain / pride / and
wanton lusts (called upon by yowr grace to serve yowr majesty for the defense
of this yowr realm) have not to do their duty / whereby they be compelled to
sell their lands / or else to burdeyne their fryndes / or else to danger them
self in debt to many. Hereof rysethe it that the father is compelled to
declare his will upon his lands to be executed after his death (when he can
not occupye the same him self) for the advancement and help of his children
and the payment of his dettes / whom easily he might in his lyffe have
advanced helped and dyscharged / if such ryotuouse expenses had been avoided.
Ose. iiij
The Prophet Osee sayethe. There is no trewethe / no mercy / no knowleage of
God in earth / cursynge / lyenge / murdre-thefte / adulterye has broken in /
and yet do owre shepherdes hold their peace. What commessacyon / dronckenes /
detestable swearinge by all the parts of Christ's body (and yet calling them
in scorn huntinge oaths) extorcyon / pride / couetuousenes / and such other
detestable vice reign in this yowr realm / against the which owre Bishops
and other Pastoures should contynually cry out / as the Prophet sayethe. Esa.
v.
Cry now as lowed as thou canste / leave not of / lift up thy voice like a
trompett / and show my people their offenses and the house of Jacob their
sins. But alas they be become both blind and dome / as the Prophet
sayethe. Esaye. lxvi.
His watchmen are all blind they have all together no understanding / they
are all dome dogs not able to barcke / they are slepye / folyshe are they and
lie snortinge / they are shameless dogs that be never satysfyed. The
shepherdes also in like manner have no understanding / but every man turnethe
his own way / every one after his own couetuousenes with all his power. What
is the cause that they do not execute this their office? Other because they
can not / or because they have somoche worldely busynes that they will not
apply them selfs to perform both. Or else they be afraid to speak the
trwethe / lest they should dysplease men. Whom Paul reproves saying. If I
should please men I should not be the servant of Christ. Gal. i. Psalm. lij
Also the Prophet sayethe. God breakethe the bones of them which study to
please men / they be confounded / because the lord dispyseth them.
Notwithstanding owr bishops love so well their great domynions whereby they
maynteyne their lordely honor / that they will not dysplease men with
preaching the treuth / lest they should then loose their great possessions /
and consequently their lordely glory. But surely as long as they possess
their great domynions / so long they will contynewe and maynteyne their
pride. And so long as they contynewe in pride / so long they shall not
receive the holy ghost / which shall teach-them to speak the treuthe. For
upon whom shall my sprete reaste (says the Prophet Esaye) but upon the meake
and lowely / and upon him which fearethe my sayengs. Esa. vi.
Also the Prophet says. God resysteth the proud / and unto the meake and
lowely he geuethe his grace. Wherefore so long as the bishops contynewe in this
worldely we althe and honowre / so long will they never do their duty and
office / but rather persecute the word of God which declarethe and shewethe
what is their office and their duty. And so long as they do not exercise
their office and vocatyon / but do persecute the word and such as syncerely
preach the same / so long shall sin increase. For if the eye be wicked /
all the body shall be full of darcknes. For even as at such time when the
Bishop of rome was first endowed with great possessions / a voice was hard
/ seyinge. Now venom and poison is cast and shed forth into the church of
God. In likewise no doubt most godly gouernoure / semblable voice and saying
may be veryfyed in and upon all the church of England / sythen yowr Bishops
were endowed with so great possessions and lordely domynions. No doubt
gracyous lord / so long as great lordely domynions / wordely honors and
wealth / be anexed and knyt to the vocacyon and offices of Bishops and other
Pastors / these myscheues and inconuenye^ces shall ever ensue and follow.
First the most proud and ambycyouse / the most couetuouse and wicked /
which other by money frendshyp or flattery can obtain the benefyce / will
labor with all study and polycye to get the benefice / only for the worldely
honor and not for the zeal and love which he should have to enstructe and
teach the people committed to his cure and charge. And for the profett which
belongethe and apperteynethe to the same benefyce / they will dyssemble
humylyte and despeccyon of all worldely profettes and pleasures / so colorablye
and subtelly / that yt shall be very hard for your majesty or any other
having aucthoryte to give benefyces to perceive them. And when they have
obtained the benefyce / than every Christen man shall well perceive that he
has not entered in by the door: that is for the zeal and love to do and
execute the office / but has clymmed up and assended by a another way / that
is for the luker and honor annexed to the office. And than certainly whosoever
assendeth and enterethe in by a another way / can not be but a thief / by day
and by night / whose study and labor must be to steal / kill / and to
destroy. As Christ (whose words must ever be true) sayethe. The thief
commethe not but to steal / to kill / and to destroy. Joan. x.
So that so long as so much worldely profett and honor be longethe to the
benefyce: so long will he that for want and lack of learning can not do the
office / and also the most couetuouse and proud / will labor to have the
office / whereby the people committed to his cure / shall not only be vntawgth
/ and not learned in Gods word / but also all they which can preach and teach
Godds word and love the same / by such a worldely wolf / shall be extremely
persecuted and tormented. For he can not but steal / kill / and destroy / and
utterly abhore / and hate the godly / as Christ sayethe. If you were of the
world / the world would love his own. But because you be not of the world /
but I have chosen you from the world / therefore the world does hate you. No
doubt a man shall much rather upon thorns gather grapes / and upon brambles
and bryres gather fygges / than of soche gredy thieves to have any Christen
relygyon: other setforthe / preached / or stablyshed. Wherefore (most redoubted
Prince) saying that their great possessions / riches / worldely offices /
cures / and busynes / be the impedyment and let that they do not execute their
vocacyon and office / which is so godly profitable and necessary for this
yowr common wealth / you being owr sovereign lord and King (whom God
has called to govern this yowr realm / and to redress the enormytyes and
abuses of the same) by all justice and equity are bounden to take away from
Bishops and other spirytuall shepherdes such superfluyte of possessions and
riches and other seculer cures busynes and worldely offices / which be the
cause of much sin in them / and no less occasyon whereby they be let to
execute their office / to the great loss and hynderance of much faith
virtue and goodness / which might be admynistred to your subjects / through the
true preaching of Gods word. And that done / than circumspectly to take
head that none be admytted to be Pastoures / but such as ca^ preach and have
preached syncerely Gods word. And all such as will not / to remove them from
their cures. This godly order observed in the electyon of spiritual pastoures
/ and the pestylent poison moved and taken away from their vocatyon / faith
shall increase / and sin shall decrease / true obedience shall be observed
with all humylite to your majesty and to the higher powers by your grace
appointed in office. Cyuile quyetnes rest and peace shall be stablyshed / God
shall be feared honored and loved / which is theffecte of all Christen lyuinge.

O Lord save our most soueraygne lord King Henry the eight / and grant
that he may ones thoroughly feale and perceive what miserable calamyte sorrow
and wretchedness we suffer now in these days a broad in the country / by these
unlearned / popyshe / and most cruel tyrauntes / even the very enemies of
Christ's cross / whose pain shall be withowt end / when we shall live in
Joy for ever. Grant yet ones again I say good lord and most merciful
father through thy sone Ihesus Christ / that when his grace shall know and
perceive (by thy gift and goodness) their most detestable ways in mysusynge
thy heretage / that he will ernestly go about to se a redress among them /
and to the penytent and contryte in heart to show his accustomed goodness / and
to the other his justice / according to saint Paul's doctrine / and his graces
laws.

And most dread soueraygne (with all humylyte and humblenes of heart) I
beseech your grace / (according to your accustomed goodness) to take this my
rude supplycacyon to the best / as a fruit of my obedyence / wheryn I have not
dyssembled / but have opened fully unto your grace the ground and very bottom
of my heart / not of any grudge evil will or malice that I bear to any
spirytuall shepherde (God I take to record) but only for the glory of God /
the honor of your grace / and the wealth and profett of your most natural
and louinge subjects.
