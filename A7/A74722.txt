A further Continuance of the Grand Politic Informer, Discovering the
wickedness and mysteries of the present State iniquities on foot about the 14
of September 1653.
OMNIVM RERVM VICESITVDO.
THe last sheet we gave you a hint of the design and intent of some of the
poorer wretches, as are very industrious in making a Knife to cut their own
throats; we mean in the altering the government of the City of London: But
first for their encouragement, let them consider, that Cromwell makes use but
of one sort of people to do one thing and so soon as that is done he lays
aside them, and makes use of another generation: As first against the Scots,
he made some instrumental, to cross their interest in the Presbyterians. So
soon as they had finished, he lays them aside: then he made use of some of
the late Parliament, to take off the late Kings head; these also he lays
aside, as you see in the late Disolving the Parliament, judging he has good
reason so to do (though he makes use of but one sort of men to commit one sort
of Treason) for he knows that he that is a Traitor to another trust will be a
Traitor to his trust that he reposeth in him. If he should entertain him long
in his service would be still expecting favors: but to prevent this he after
they have sweetened their mouths a little he turns them off and pretends
insufficiency; or that they are not holy enough, or some other thing: now by
this means he strengthens his interest, for whilst that they are in
employment they gain riches, and he winketh at them; so when he turns them
out of employment, they must still be owners of him and his Tyranny, for in any
other change (think they) our estates cannot be secure, because we have gained
them by indirect means; and there is no way like to the taking of Sanctuary
under the power of a Tyrant, that is guilty of betraying of trust, usurping the
supreme power, who will be ready to say if they will not question me for my
Treasons, I will not question them for their Villainies: No further then, for
loss of place to make way for other new Traitors to act their parts on the
stage: now we see what a miserable thing it is for men so readily to contribute
their helps or assistance to raise a Tyrant; but it is in hope, that they may
rise in the top of his favor, and be raised with him; we hear could tell you
many a story, how God does bring down Tyrants, when they are most strong they
become weak, etc. But as to the changing the government of the City of London,
its very strongly aggitated, that some clothed in red, not Saints clothed in
white; Saints should govern the City instead of Mayor, Aldermen, and Common
Council men, this is set on foot and contrived by some of the City, who have
taken the Oath of the City upon their making free; the substance was that they
should do nothing that should be for the hurt of the City of London; but it may
be they say, that they did take that Oath with a proviso (viz) if in case there
came not commands to the contrary from the Cockpit, we have too many -- think
the creatures of Cromwell's favor to be sufficient dispensations to all Oaths
and Villainies that can be committed: but he that has but half an eye might see
that, the changing of the government, and the seizing of the guards of the City
of London was designed when they took away the chains from the ends of the
streets, and threw down the forts; so when they were thus disarmed, they put
garrisons upon them by and under pretense of preventing malignant designs; but
under pretenses of that and of the pretending to promote the work of the Lord,
and securing the interest of the Lords people; they (viz.) the Lord Cromwels
interest and people; they have devoured all our wealth and liberties: but now
the design they drive at, in endeavoring to alter the government of the City
of London, is to take away all the rights or as much as they can of Election in
the people; for say they, if the government of the City of London should be
continued by the election of the people, they may elect such as we may not
stand well assured of complying with us in our Treasons, and we know that the
City of London is able to question us, and drive our Army into the sea, or
swallow them up at a mouthfull; therefore it is convenient that we (say they)
should take from them all means possible of their unloosing their bonds, the
which if they do, we must be bound: Besides (say they) if we can bind the
hands of the City of London, we shall lead the whole Nation into Captivity, and
to that end, is a great part of the Army come into the City, and upon their
march toward London to chose a Lord Mayor it may be; We see that saying of
Aratus to Philip of Macedon made good in our age; That Tyrants, Thieves and
Robbers make use of Arms, Rocks, and Forts, and decree it; There is nothing as
Papprius Masson says, so sacred, which the great Tyrants of this world will
not violate if some advantage may come unto them thereby. You see it and find
it to be true, that London that has been the fountain and cause of the
greatness of the Tyrants, now must disrobe her self of her most excellent
government, that she has kept unviolated many hundred years; but if this were
all we are in such a condition, that we should account it an happiness to be
only slaves and no more; but we must be miserable slaves: There is another
design on foot for wickedness in the highth, the like was never conspired nor
acted by any; nay it would make the worst in Hell ashamed, nay we are persuaded
it would make the Devil himself blush, and yet some of our Saints or white
Devils have that horrid, damnable, and wicked impudence to design that the
Records of the Nation should be burned; in this they have many ends: First,
that all that hold any Houses or Land by what little soever, when the Records
of the Nation are burned, it shall be much at the descretion of the Judge to
award judgment either to the Plaintiff or Defendant which so ever of them is
most a Saint alies an Hypocrite (God forbid that we should speak or open our
mouths against the good people of God, they we say, that profess to the love
it, and that do not make use of pretenses to carry on base wicked designs) for
you must assure your selves that they will provide Judges that shall be
Conscience proof, and that will incline much in their judgments to favor those
that favor the times: besides this is the only way that these Israelites will
come by the goods and lands of the Egyptians at advantage. John of Leydon
required his impostors and followers to seize of all the goods of the wicked,
by open force; but these are bringing of it home more covertly and obscurely by
these pretenses, viz. To prevent further contests and quarrels by suits of Law:
but if this be brought about, you shall have little cause to go to law, for you
shall have nothing to defend by it. Besides, he that does hold any thing must
hold and enjoy it upon their terms, that he must live and take the present
Tyrants orders for better for worse; besides these will keep the people more to
depend upon the favor of the Tyrants, for then they will see it to be a thing
of necessity to comply, for they see that upon the least distaste (and they
will not be wanting to take occasion as often as may) to turn them out of their
estates: likewise this of the burning of the Records is a good design for
those that have bad Titles to the Houses and Land they hold and to those that
would cheat Orphants, but the body of the design is this, that Magna Charta may
be no more pleaded, nor the Petition of Right; neither shall the people have
the least remain, to put them in mind of their ancient Liberty; [and the
people may account it a favor to live] and if they will have their causes
pleaded, it must be by friends, or else suffer you must. A third design is
that all Societies and meetings shall be prohibited under a pretense of
preventing of carrying on of plots and designs: and to that end throw down
Plays and Bear baiting, and all other pastimes; we do not here argue for
Plays, we only show what is designed when they pretend reformation. Next they
must prevent Fairs and Markets, meetings to Hunt and Hawk; what a sad condition
have these men brought themselves too? The Tyrant himself that makes us all
slaves is but a slave himself: for he cannot nor dare to go without his guards,
he is afraid of his own shadow, when it is his guilty conscience that puteth
him in fear, he calls about him stronger guards, and cries a plot to color
all: Pliny the songs in his Janegyr to Trajan, says that wicked princes makes
Arms their sanctuary, but good Princes make the affections of their people to
be their sanctuary. This design of preventing meeting has already taken in
Ireland, this was one of the parts that the Tyrant Dyonisius acted to secure
himself in his abominable tyranny, he would not permit the Syracutians to meet
in friendly and familiar meetings, thereby the better to prevent the knowing
one another minds; for says he, if they know not one another mind, they
cannot so redily put in execution any thing that may be hurtful to the
Tyranny! What a lamentable thing is it, that men should bring themselves into
such a condition, to fear their shadow. Another designe's on foot, is that
under pretense of preventing of the disarming of the royal party: it is
intended to disarm all the good people of England, that they may not be in a
capacity to resist the intended tyranny. [Do but remember what freedom you
enjoyed (under the Kingly power accounted by our Tyrants to meet in Arms, and
other friendly meetings] We shall press it onwards in answer to a Letter
pretended to be sent to Mr. John Lilburn, where in general is observed nothing
but weakness and madness. We find this person that enters the Lists in this
Letter, to be but of a mungril breed: he barketh round the Cage now the Lion is
fast barred therein: we cannot conceive it to be our work to take notice of
him, only we will feel his pulse, to know of what temper he is of; we find him
rightly principled for the intended Tyranny, in the 1. place we will match him
with Julian the Apostate, Who when any of the Christians complained unto him.
says he, Why complain you, your God commands you patiently to bear all
evils, reproaches and indignities; if one cheek be struk, turn the other. So
says this nameless and senseless Author of this Letter, admit he has
defamed you (meaning Major Packer defaming his Lilburn) says he, is that
Christian like for you to do so and so, by him, yea, he might as well have
said, John Lilburn, it is Christian like for thee to submit to God, to the
Gaolers, it being the will of the Tyrants, and their earnest desire and your
duty to submit to the higher powers. Though it be the duty of a Christian to
submit it to all such things that shall be done in opposition of that truth
which he professes in the name of Christ, yet that does not bind him up from
defending either his life, good name, or Estate in a civil respect. He has
another expression that seems very strange, wherein he complains of Mr.
Lilburns popularity, and says, that with his clouted shoes, blue aprons and
private Soldiers, threaten disturbance, it appears suddenly what temper this
Author is of: he cannot but know, that the persons now, whose greatness has
been, and will be the cause of much trouble: They we say, ascended by
popularity to that greatness they now are at, he has one claw more where he
takes exceptions at the Subscription of John Lilburn in a Letter to Cromwell,
where he subscribeth himself sturdy John Lilburne: says he The law of England
has only branded beggars and Rogues with the name sturdy, therefore says he,
you have not to boast therein: he does not rightly understand the meaning of
the Law in this point; which is, that no person that is sturdy or able for
employment should be suffered to beg; for under color thereof, they committed
Robberies, and diverse outrages: so that impotent men were suffered to take an
alms, in regard there was not that danger in them, neither could they do much
mischief as 18. E 1^ c ^ ^^ H 8

Lastly, says he, it may be that God may say, I have afflicted my servant John
Lilburn and he is not yet humbled; we believe that this generation that
afflicts John Lilburn God has sent as he sent the Devil to afflict Job: so
has he sent them, and set them up to be a scourge to the Nation as well as to
John Lilburn: but we have faith to believe that God will also cast them down.
In the next sheet, we shall show you the design that they have to lay aside
Trials by Juries, and upon it give you our Observations.

Reader, We desire thee to be content with the Eratae's that escape the press,
there are many in the third part of the pollitick Informer, in a case of
Lettletons, especially of estates upon condition, that and the rest shall in
the sixth part be corrected by an Errata; one thing more we would entreat thee
not to censure the Politic Informer, for inclining either to one faction or
another; assure thee his principles are right, for a true and just government
of a Common wealth, by a people representative, annually elected, as we shall
plainly demonstrate in the ensuing works; yet in the former part there may be
some probable ground to believe he enclineth to monarchy; we assure thee he
does not in the least incline to it; but he is of opinion, that no one ought to
usurp supreme power; neither ought any person or persons to have it above one
year: it is not the work of one that undertaketh pollitick observations to
incline any way, but only to discover the reasons of state, the proper
tendencie, the end and aim that these corrupt persons, that have now Usurped
and assumed the Supreme power to the great detriment of the people of England:
it was not the way of Tacitus Live or of subtacitus tranquillionis, or any
pollitick Historian to incline to speak or write in favor of either Galba
Otha, or Vitellias; but to unmask and unrobe the state of things, to declare
the truth; so shall it be our work to discover the high designs on foot, which
is to rob and destroy the Rights, Privileges, Estates, and Lives of the people
of England; which we mentioned of the perfidious dealing with the King, was not
that we did it in favor of him: we do acknowledge he did deserve death, but we
affirm it ought to have been another way, as is shown in the first part of this
Work, the Mirror, cap. 1. and Section 2. Affirms that the Kings were sworn to
be ruled and governed by the same Law that he should rule and govern by; we do
not acknowledge that any thing is to rule but Law, in which it may be said God
rules.

Reader, The tumult in Paul's Churchyard, Sunday 6 of October, is to be feared
was set on foot by Cromwell, thereby to take an occasion to question the Lord
Mayor, and alter the government of the City [Nero set on, fired Rome, and laid
it on the Christians; he thereby did punish Rome, and took an occasion to
persecute the Christians] We shall in our next give you our farther thoughts
therein, and an account how they have laid the plot to do it: that a Colonel
may be your Mayor, the Pikes your Aldermen, and Musketeers your Common
Council; we shall also discover to you the dangerousnesse, hellishnesse, and
wickedness of the design of the present power, in their intended taking away
of Forest Land, wherein they will destroy nigh four hundred thousand people of
England, and after they have ruined them make use of them to destroy the rich,
that thereby they may support themselves in their Tyranny; though they make use
of one party to destroy another: witness the contention at present, betwixt
the Citizens of London and their Lord Mayor, whose year being near expired,
denies the delivery of the Collar of Esses with the City Plate and Hangings,
(but he were much engaged to his Coachman or else he had got enough of that)
with the rest of the City goods, which goes from one Mayor to another; and this
is, as they say, because they will not allow him all the money which two of his
Brethren should have had toward their Mayoraldries if they had not laid down
their Cloates before; besides he had or would have turned out the four Clerks
belonging unto the City; and all this is done by instigation from our Grandees
at White Hall, who made him put by the trial of the soldier, who set the
Pistol to one of the Sheriffs breasts the sixth of October; but more of this
in the next.

FINIS.
