London, Printed in the Year, 1679.

THE EXAMINATION OF MARY the Wife of WILLIAM GODSAL, Taken at Cannon Froome IN
THE COUNTY OF HEREFORD July the 18th. 1679. before Richard Hopton Esquire One of
his MAJESTY'S JUSTICES of the PEACE for the same COUNTY.
THIS Examinant says, That upon the 16th. Day of this Instant July in the
Evening of the same Day, about an hour before Sun set, as she was Milking her
Cows at Shewall in the Parish of Stoake Idith, in the said County of Hereford,
she did see Drops, like the Drops of Blood, rain down upon the ground, where
she was Milking One of her Kine, That it covered all the ground where she was
Milking to the breadth of a Sheet, with thick Drops of Blood, That it covered
the Right Side of her Cow, as she was Milking, all over with Blood, That some
of the Drops fell into her Pail of Milk, and disperced it self all over the
Pail, and discolored the Milk, That she was much astonished and afraid, and
took up the Payl of Milk and went into her House and sent for some of her
Neighbors, (that is) the Wife of one Richard Billy, Alice the Wife of Phillip
Herrington, Margaret the Daughter of Edward Chamberlin, and Mrs. Carpenter the
Wife of one Warncomb Carpenter; and this Examinant and her said Neighbors went
into the said Ground, where it rained BLOOD as aforesaid; and there this
EXAMINANT and the rest of her Neighbors did see the Blood upon the Grass in
the said Ground, not only in the same place where the Examinant milked her said
Cow, but also in several other places in the said Ground: and this Examinant
seeing it continued raining drops of Blood in the said Ground she cast up her
Eyes toward the Sky, to veiw and see in what manner, and from whence the same
drops of Blood did come, and as she was beholding the same, several drops of
Blood fell upon her Face and her Neckcloath, the which Neckcloath she has
since washed, to see if she could get the Blood out, but she cannot get out the
same.

This is an Exact COPY of the EXAMINATION, taken before the said Worshipful
Justice of the Peace, concerning this Miraculous Relation, and is published to
prevent False Reports.

FINIS.
