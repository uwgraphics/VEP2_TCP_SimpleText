TO THE READERS.
TO remove all Doubts about this Proposition, as to the First Part of this
Book, you must understand, That the most noted Persons, first from Adam to
Joseph, A. M. 2198. are all Descendents one from another. From the death of the
said Joseph, and the servitude of the Jews from Moses to Saul, A. M. 2889. they
were all Judges; and from Saul to the Captivity, A. M. 3372. Kings of the Jews.
Then from Darius to Alexander the Great, succeeded the Monarchy of the
Persians; and from the said Alexander to Octavianus, is the Reign of the
Grecians; and then came in the Emperors of Rome to Leopold the First then
Reigning. But because from the time of Charles the Great, in the year of our
Lord 801, there were two Emperors; the one in the East, at Constantinople, and
the other in the West, you have an account of those of Constantinople, to the
taking of that City by the Turks, A. C. 1453. which are not so exactly
mentioned by Historians, especially to the days of John Cattacusinus; and
therefore it is no wonder, if there be any mistake of the former times. As for
the rest, all things are clearly demonstrated, and therefore there is no need
of any further explaining thereupon.

As to the Second Part, it was collected by a very diligent observer of many
years Actions therein named, which you may the easier be convinced of, when you
may see the day of the Month to every Action and Passage: Which exactness you
cannot find in any other Book of this kind whatsoever. Farewell.
