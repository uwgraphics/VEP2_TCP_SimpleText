AN English-mans Fundamental APPEAL. OR, The Third Humble Petiton and
Address of Captain WILLIAM BRAY.
Complaining shows,

THat on or about the 18th of June last, your Petitioner did deliver, or cause
to be delivered (to every Member then sitting) an application, wherein he did
endeavor to address himself in rational and modest manner (as he humbly
conceives, with submission to your great Judgment) to accomplish Justice, and
Equity to himself, in these ensuing particulars:

FIRST,
To obtain Justice, and satisfaction for his Arrears, disbursments, damages and
losses in your service, and intendedly (according to his understanding) for
your lawful preservation from violence, by the fury and rage of War, and the
dismal consequences thereof, publicly discovered, or promulged by your
Declarations.

SECONDLY,
To procure (if it were possible) some moderate satisfaction and consideration,
for his almost three years arbitrary, injurious and severe imprisonment; which
kind of Actions, and dealings with your long oppressed Petitioner, (in many
particulars) were contrary to the Fundamental, Essential, Righteous Ancient,
and Common Liberties and Safetyes, as your Petitioner diverse years ago, (in the
time of his Bonds) did often evidence, and publicly, and particularly attest;
and can easily (to any rational and unbiased understanding) make appear, and
justify himself (as a Member of the body of the People,) not only by the
amiable Fundamental Law of England (which is plain, and certain if there were
no President in the Case) but also by the Case of the Lord Kimbolton, Sir
Arthur Haslerig, etc. and by Mr. Pim's Speech to the Lord Mayor and
Common Counsel, in a Replicatory Answer to King Charles his Answer, and
Declaration made to the Petition of the City of London, etc. in vindication of
the said Lord Mayor, (...) Colonel Ven, and Colonel Manwaring. Your Petitioner
do^^ now (...), humbly revive his Claim of Justice, supposing after your long
interruption, and great ^^me and space given, (peradventure amongst the many
wise Reasons in Gods Wisdom, to the end to cause a mature, sincere
deliberation, and impartial consideration of former paths: as it was said in
the case of King Hezekiah, 2 Chro. 32.31. God left him to try him, to know all
that was in his heart,) There was no reason to judge it to be impossible, that
you should sincerly, and effectually mind your many Solemn Obligations,
Declarations, Vows, and Imprecations to Heaven, on the behalf of the said
Fundamental, Essential, Impartial Liberties, and Common Birthright of England,
which are known by the Almighty and All-seeing Eye, and can hardly be blotted
out humane memorials, as by your many Declarations, if relation (according to
obligation to God, Nation, and Conscience) be had to them (with an unbiased
understanding, and sincere affection to reduce things to action) will plainly
and fully appear (as your Petitioner also humbly conceives.)

THIRDLY,
The third part of your Petitioners Address consisted in reminding, and ^ming
you of his illegal and Arbitrary ejection, his Trust in the year 1648, and that
if you should have done him that further impartial Justice to restore him to
(...) place of Trust, he would study (according to his understanding)
faithfulness to you therein.

For the first part of it, if your Petitioner should humbly argumentize to your
great Wisdom, declared knowledge, public invitations, and Instructions on
the behalf of the Laws and Liberties, and what the nature of an Obligation
and promise is, and how much the same is valued, by such as have power or
ability, and a good Conscience with it, he thinks (with submission) it would be
as needless as to cast a drop of water into the Ocean, for thereby it will
appear, that he should have had satisfaction for the same as a just debt, the
obligation being of so Capital and great a nature as Public Faith, in which
matter, if your Petitioner had obtained just consideration, he might have
avoided many great inconveniences, and made some just benefit thereof the just
advantage and good of himself and relations, when he was arbitrarily excluded
his public Trust, and so made incapable of doing his Country service in a
public way, and also if he had not been interrupted by his said imprisonment;
And if your Petitioner could be (as he hops he cannot be) induced to lay
aside (for his defense, and to justify his claim, and particular just
concernments) those righteous Fundamental Laws, Liberties and ancient Rights
of the Nation, upon which the War was chiefly declared to be grounded, (the
conservation of which Libertyes and Rights, was so diligently looked into by
our honorable Parliamentary Auncesters and fully established; (upon rational
grounds and Maxims:) against any possibility of Invasion, and by mutual
agreement from the Crown of Monarchy,) yet Christ the head of all Christians
(from whom the name has been since either really derived to any, or unjustly
and improperly assumed by any) does give as a law of Talion and everlasting
command (as I humbly conceive with submission to your great understanding) That
every man ought to do as he would be done unto; not excluding any, or giving a
Prerogative or Previledge to any whomsoever upon any Political suggestion or
pretense whatsoever to disanul that Law.

And how indubitably necessary it is that Law should be a supreme bar,
against arbitrariness; and how consistent the Evangelicall Law is with the
light of Nature, and with the just concernment of every man's just interest and
defense, and how upon due impartial reasoning this may be applied, and by how
much the more the Rule is obligeing to the greatest Authorities or Powers in a
more especial manner, (as eminent examples to others) your Petitioner does
referr to your Conscience, and declared knowledge without useing other
arguments.

For the second part of it your Petitioner did (as he hops) in as model.
Terms, as he could imagine or conceive (with laying aside flattery, which is
hateful to the wisely just) defire consideration of his said almost three
years Imprisonment, as if the case had been your own, and as if God should
have permitted the late deceased called Protector, NOT ONLY TO INTERRUPT YOU,
BUT TO COMMIT YOU EVERY ONE AS YOU DID HIM; which said Imprisonment has tended
in many considerations to his injury, great loss, many inconveniences, ruin,
and destruction ever since; in so much that your Petitioner has often (in
affliction of mind, and peradventure with too great and deep a sense and
consideration of things) desired dissolution, as that good Prophet Elijah (with
whom your Petitioner cannot compare) requested for himself that he might dye,
and said it is enough now oh Lord, take away my life for I am not better then
my Fathers, for after the long defect of Justice, and humane consideration in a
moderate nature (which was only desired by your Petitioner?) your Petitioner
can only ascribe thanks to the great goodness of God for his preservation to
this day, which he yet hops has been in goodness, that he may after so long
a time reap your Justice, that humane nature should not be neglected and
trampled upon any longer. And for Argument to your declared exemplary
understanding, your Petitioner (hoping it may receive a revived Impression)
desires to mind you with your own Declarations in answer to the late King
Charles, which will restifie for him, and plead his cause, as will appear in
the book of Collection of Declarations, Printed by Mr. Edward Husbands by
order, and direction of the 24 March 1642 Page 694; Wherein you express your
selves in this manner, (viz.) Whatever be our inclination, Slavery would be our
condition, if we should go about to overthrow the Laws of the Land, and the
Propriety of every man's Estate, and Liberty of his Person; for therein we must
be as well Patients as Agents; and must every one in his turn suffer our selves
whatever we should impose upon others: And in your Declaration of the 19th of
May 1642, Page 202, wherein you express these words, (viz,) And as his Majesty
does graciously declare the Law shall be the measure of his Power, so do we
hearttly profess, that we shall always make it the Rule of our Obedience. And
therefore, as Christ that perfect Pattern of natural Justice and supernatural
Power and Mercy, John 5.30. does use these words, (viz.) As I hear I judge, and
my Judgment is just because I seek not mine own will, but the will of my Father
which has sent me: So I humbly suppose I may say and apply, as I have heard or
read in the righteous Foundations and Principles of the Law from our Ancestors,
and also averted by your own Writings. As I hear, I Judge and believe there is
a Rule of direction to me to believe my judgment is just, because I seek not my
own Will, grounded (as an Innovation) upon my own Judgment or private opinion,
but founded upon your own Declarations which testify to the Case.

As for the third part of your Petitioners aforesaid Application, he does
humbly confess since he did see a great or general endeavors and application
for a restoration and reinvestiture to Government, and to accept of Trusts and
places of profit, Power, and employment, he could not think his said address to
be any just cause of offense to you (as the case is,) but rather receiveable
with cheerful intention to do Justice. But your Petitioner seeing and
continually feeling (after 11 years sufferings and neglects, that his said
Application of the 18th of June was ineffectuall, he made another of the second
of July following, and apprehending that his place of trust, and investiture
might not be with your likeing, did not particularly mind that third part of
his said address, being willing to endeavor patience of mind and subjection,
rather then any such thing as any part or portion in YOUR GOVERNMENT.

Therefore your Petitioner does now again (by all obligations humane and
divine) request and desire of you to manifest a Presidentall or exemplary
Justice, and good Conscience suitable to a great Counsel, as to the speedy
consideration of his arreares, losses, damages and disbursements (intendedly
for your lawful preservation) and speedy and just satisfaction for his almost
three years arbitrary Imprisonment, that so he might not be any longer
neglected, destroyed and undone, contrary to the Rules of all just Law,
Humanity and Conscience, and in case your said oppressed Petitioner shall
obtain Justice (in his affection and respect, he desires to bear to
gratitude,) he shall pray that God would extend his Wisdom, and the power of
his Godhead to and for you and your posterity, if you or they shall have any
occasion to desire or expect Justice and goodness from any future Government,
Authority or Generations in the World.

WILLIAM BRAY.
29th, September. 1659.
