C R
HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms KING CHARLES His SPEECH
to the Six Eminent Persons who lately arrived at Brussels, to Treat with His
MAJESTY touching His Restoration to the Royal Throne and Dignity of his Father.
Gentlemen, and Loving Subjects,
HAving notice of your so sudden Applicaaion to us (by an Overture from several
of Our good Subjects) it has been Our diligent Care to provide for your
entertainment, in so Honorable a way as might stand with the Credit of Our
Royal Person, according to Our Ability, in this place of Our sad and tedious
Exilement. And being deeply sencible of the Calamities and miseries brought
upon Our poor Subjects by the late unnatural War; We hold it Our duty to use
all possible means and I join with you, the Messengers (we hope) of a true
Peace between Our self and all Our Loyal Subjects, and that by you (the
Instruments employed in behalf of Our Kingdoms, there may be wronght such a
perfect Union and conjunction, between Our Self, and Our People, who profess
to be so sincerely affected with the same Pious desire of the Public good as
may (God giving the success) produce a right understanding between Our Self
and you to make up all thpse great and innumerable Breaches between Us, and Our
Loyal Subjects, which by a misunderstanding have been planted and long
continued betwixt Us and them.

And wherers we do understand that you have undertaken this great Work to Treat
with Us, we shall adhere to any Propositions, that may conduce to the Glory of
God, and the maintenance of the true Protestant Religion, the Just and
inseparable Right of the Crown, and the Privileges of a Free and full
Paaliament, Elected by the Free consent of Our People, and to the Just Rights
and Liberties of our Subjects, And that to the end a Treaty tending to Peace
may not (as formerly) be founded on the blood of Our good Subjects.

We cannot indeed acquaint you with the inexpressible joy that We are sencible
of to find Our poor distressed and distracted Kingdoms in some hopes of
Settlement, and Restoration of its pristine Glory, by the Establishing of Our
Self; which we know and are Confident is the earnest desire of all our Loving
Subjects, being now at last unvailed, whereby they see cleatly the cruelty of
those Taskmasters who aspersed Us their lawful King with the name of Tyrant,
and have themselves destroyed Our Estates with the Estates of several of Our
good Subjects to maintain their Violences, enrich themselves with the ruins of
Our good People, and overthrow Our Royal Prerogatives, and the ancient
Fundamental Laws of Our Kingdoms.

Whereas it has been publicly declared to Our good People (which your selves
cannot be ignorant of) that Our intent was to come over with Foreign Force
(thereby to corrupt the good opinion of Our Loving Subjects) We do profess
from the bottom of Our heart it was never Our thought to take any such course
to regain Our Right, and settle Our Self in the Royal Throne and Dignity of Our
Father, but what We might in Justice, both according to the Laws of God and
nature prosecute for the recovery of Our own Birthright; To which end and
purpose we hope you are here (through Gods blessing) safely Arrived, and that
not only to restore Our Self, but to power Balm into the wound of Our three
Kingdoms.

Though indeed the Innocent blood of our Royal Father is a great grief to Our
Self, yet the desire of Revenge is so far from Our heart, that We shall leave
it to him who is the Just Judge of all both in Heaven and Earth; Our chiefest
aim being only to endeavor what in Us lies to Compose the difference between
Our Self and you (who are employed in the behalf of all Our good Subjects)
according to the Instructions you have received, so far as may stand with Gods
glory, and the Honor and Safety of Our Self; to which end and purpose we have
already provided several Peaceable Propositions which will be presented to your
hands an this present happy and (we hope) successful meeting.

Who knows but that the Divine Providence has sent you to Us, that you (by
Our Royal Assent to your happy endeavors) may be made the joyful Instruments
of a well-grounded Peace, and of restoring Religion to its purity, the Church
to its Rights, Our Self to Our Royal Prerogatives, the Laws to their Channel,
and Our good Subjects to their Liberties: All which if you resolve to join with
Our Self in performance of, may Crown Our Kindoms with eternal Honor.

And since it is manifest by the Laws of God, of Nature, of Our Kingdoms, and
of Humanity, that the Government of the Kingdom is due to One, why not to Our
Self, by Birth your Countryman, by Education a Protestant, by profession and
actions your Pious Prince, and by his gracious Compliance confident in your
Loyalty and Obedience. Let Us truly make a Covenant with Heaven, Religion and
Justice, and we may soon make up all the breaches of dissension in Our Kingdoms
by an happy union.
