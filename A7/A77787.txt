To the Right Honorable the Lords, assembled in the Higher House of Parliament.
The humble Petition of John Bulmer Sea-Captaine,
Shows,
THat the Kings Most Excellent Majesty was graciously pleased by Letters
Pattents, under the Great Seal of England, to grant unto your Petitioner
license, power, and authority, by his own art, industry, and means, to take
up any Ordnance, Ships, or other goods, wrackt, or sunk in the Sea, within any
of His Majesty's Dominions; without reserving any thing thereout unto His
Majesty, his Heirs, and Successors.

May it please your Lordships, That the Petitioner is informed by
Underofficers, belonging unto the Lord Admiral of England, and Lord Warden of
the Cinque Ports (for the time being) that all Goods, Treasure, or other
Merchandise, taken up out of the Sea, do belong unto one of their Lordships,
or some of their Underofficers, whereby such, who would otherwise be willing
to assist and supply your Petitioner with moneys and means, to take up such
things out of the Sea, are utterly discouraged to supply or assist him.

That for his own experience in this Art, he has expended of his Fathers, his
own, and Friends assistance, many thousand pounds; and is very loath that so
much experience of his gained, with much study, labor, and expense, in these
dangerous times, should be buried in oblivion, or fall to the ground, (he yet
being both active and willing to do His Majesty and the Commonwealth
service.)

His humble suit therefore to your Lordships is, That you would be pleased by
Order of this House to enable your Petitioner to make experience of his
endeavors in the aforesaid Art; (he undertaking the same at his own proper
cost and charges) always provided, that he may be free from any claim or
claims, that the now Lord Admiral, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, or
their Successors, their Deputies or Underofficers, may pretend or make.

And your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc.
