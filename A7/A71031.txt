TO HIS EVER HONORED PATRON Sir JOHN BOLLES Bart.
SIR,
THis Treatise, upon the first Publication, was Dedicated to your late Father,
and not without good reason; for, all the Motives that could enter into a
Dedication of that nature, did oblige me to it. First, as he was a most eminent
Patron of Music, and Musicians. Secondly, as he was not only a Lover of
Music, but also a great Performer in it. Thirdly, as the said Treatise had its
Conception, Birth, and Accomplishment under His Roof, in your Minority. Lastly,
as he was my peculiar Patron; affording me a cheerful Maintenance, when the
Iniquity of the Times had reduced me (with many others in that common calamity)
to a condition of needing it.

That Impression being spent, and another importuned, this Second comes now in
order to kiss Your Hands, and desire Your Patronage, as Immediate Heir and
Successor to your Father; not only to his Estate, but likewise to his Dignity,
Worth and Virtue. And in This Dedication I have some Advantages which I had not
in the Former. One is, that you were the chief occasion of this Book; and
therefore, if there be any thing of worth in it, the World may thank You for
it: For, it was contrived and carried on for Your Instruction in Music, at
such vacant hours as you were not employed in Studies of more concernment: And,
as it was made for You, so it has made You (by your ingenuity) not only the
greatest Artist, but also the ablest Judge of it, that (I think) is this day in
Europe; (I mean) of a Gentleman, and no Professor of the Science. And this
opinion of mine I find confirmed by a Paper of Verses printed at Rome, when you
traveled those Parts, which were occasioned by your rare Expressions on the
Viol at a Musick-meeting; in which were present not only diverse Grandees of
that Court and City, with some Ambassadors of Foreign States; but also the
Great Musicians of Rome, who are esteemed Superlative; all admiring your
Knowledge in Music, and your Excellency upon that Instrument. That I might
give Your self, our Nation, and the Author of those Verses the Right which is
due to each, I have presumed to Reprint them on the following Page, as well for
a Justification of what I have said, as also for an Encouragement to those who
shall make use of the same Instructions which guided you on to that Perfection.
I am loath to detain you too long, yet one thing I must acquaint you with, which
is, That our Division-Viol Sounds better now in Latin than it formerly did in
English; the Gentleman that has improved it is your kind Acquaintance, my ever
honored Friend (and sometime Scholar in Music) Mr. William Marsh, that it
might be understood in Foreign Parts; and I have caused its Native Language to
be joined therewith, to make it useful at Home as well as Abroad. This is all I
have to say, more than what I suppose you already know; which is, that I am

Superiorum permissu.

To the Reader.
I Came with great willingness (though under the Obligation likewise of a Duty)
to the reading of this Book; out of a Respect both to the Author, and to the
Subject of it: the One being my Familiar Friend, and the Other, my Singular
Entertaynment, and Delight. Having now thoroughly, and carefully perused it, I
should reckon my self a little wanting to the Public, if I acquainted not the
world, that in so doing I have received much Benefit and Satisfaction. It bears
for Title, THE DIVISION VIOL; or, The Art of Playing Extempore upon a Ground;
and it does certainly answer That pretense, both for Matter and Method, to the
highest point of reasonable Expectation. And yet I cannot so properly call it
the Best, as (indeed,) the only Treatise I find extant upon this Argument;
which without doubt renders it the more valuable, in that it is brought upon
the first essay so near to perfection: for it is a piece so Instructive, and of
such a Latitude, that it meets all Capacities, and finds no man either too
wise, or too weak to be the better for it. Briefly; As to the Command, and
Mastery of the Viol, (in that point which is the Excellency of That Instrument)
either for Hand, or Skill, I will take upon me to aver, that whoever has This
Book by him, has one of the best Tutors in the world at his Elbow. And let me
add, that although it be Calculated especially (as appears by the Title) for
the Division Viol, yet when you come to the Descant, and Directions for
Diminution upon a Ground, you will find it a work of exceeding use in all sorts
of Music whatsoever.

Ad Musices Amatorem.
EA rerum humanarum conditio est, ut dum explorantur, dum ad vivum resecantur,
Nihili nos sui, unde primum emerserunt, admoneant. Scientias Artesque quarum
stupendos progressus nemo non videt, ac Disciplinas praesertim Mathematicas si
ad Principia prima, ad Axiomata ac Postulata revoces, res nihili putes,
mirerisque subito tam exiguis e fontibus tantum prodigiorum confluxisse
Oceanum. Plurima istius generis e minimis initiis existunt maxima. Elucet prae
caeteris in Musica eximia quaedam ab exordio tenui claritudo. Eam si temere
ipso in limine intuearis, humilis inprimis, nulloque ornamento spectabilis,
intus canere videtur omnia; in penitiori Harmonia Sacrario illustris apparet
admodum atque de debellatis saepius Auditorum animis erecto sublime tropaeo,
victrix ac triumphabunda festivum Paeana ingeminat. Nisi forte illud Poetae ei
rectius convenit: Parva ortu primo, mox sese attollit in auras,
Ingrediturque solo, and caput inter nubila condit.
Ne longius abeam, vel hanc ipsam Chelyn Minuritionum artificio exornatum
consule. Praecepta quae in aditu primum occurrunt, exilia forsam ac tenuia
censeas; inde tamen si filum texueris, quo errabunda vestigia pedetentim
cauteque regas, difficili te Labyrintho sensim expedies, atque in apertis demum
amoenisque Minuritionum campis, magno cum foenore ac liquidissimo voluptatis
sensu spatiari demiraberis. Testantur id ii, quorum ex hisce elementis insignis
prognata modulandi solertia incredibiles passim animorum motus plaususque
excitavit. Quare visum est Chelyn hanc Anglicam latio donare ac publici juris
facere, ne res communibus votis tantopere expetita, Insula dumtaxat vna
circumscriberetur; atque ut, quo praevia jampridem pervolavit fama quanta cum
venustate ac art Chelys in Anglia tractari soleat, Ars quoque ipsa
transfretaret.

Forma Chelyos utravis Minuritonibus apta, sed Prima resonantior.
two division-viols in different forms The Figure or Shape of a Division-Viol
may be either of these; but the First is better for Sound.


CHELYS, Minuritionum Artificio Exornata.
PARS PRIMA. Chelyos tractandae Praecepta.
CHELYS peritum nacta Fidicinem, cum caeteris Instrumentis Musicis de palma
certare jure merito potest. De ejus inprimis agendum Constructione, tum de
Tangendi Modo. Libandum praeterea aliquid de Consonantiis Musicis; ut ad
Minuritiones, quae Chelyn ornant commendantque maxim, gradatim ascendatur.

De Chely ipsa, qualis Minuritionibus maxim quadret, and quomodo concinnanda.
CHelyn quae Minuritionibus destinatur, breviorem esse convenit ea, quae Choro
musico inservit; ut faciliori negotio stringi percurrique possit: qua in re,
manuum digitorumque, ut quisque arctioribus vel largioribus est, habenda ratio.
Magnitudo ut plurimum ejusmodi sit, quae Fidem duorum pedum and semissis a
Magade inferiori seu ponticulo ad Chordotomum seu crenas superiores admittat.
Sonus, sit tinnulus and excitatus, qualis fere esse solet minorum Chelyum seu
Violinorum. Eum videlicet sonum nanciscuntur simili figura majores, quarum
Vterus ex solido trunco, Lintris instar, excavatur.

Hexachordam esse oportet; annexis septem Ligulis, aliquanto crassioribus iis,
quae Testudinis collum ambiunt. Qua vero sede ad Fidem apertam Octava superius
in Canone sive manubrio resonat, ligulam extraordinariam figere opportunum
erit, quae digitos isthac oberrantes veluti familiare signum ad moneat, qua
intercapedine vicina deinceps intervalla rata proportione pertentanda sint.

Fides item sint paullo crassiores Chordis Lyrae-Chelyos, aequali discrimine
Canoni superextensae, ut facilius aptiusque premantur.

Ponticulus ita arcuetur, ut Chordae singulae distinct fidentique plectro
absque ulla anxietate vibrari queant.

Canon sit laevis and aequabilis. Ejus longitudo duas tertias parts spatii
occupet, quod inter ponticulum superioremque Chordotomum interjacet. Ponticulum
declivi utrimque flexu aemuletur; ut chordae singulae manubrio, quemadmodum
dictum est, aequaliter superemineant. Si Ponticuli curvatura fuerit ut Arcus A.
B. Canonis ima pars sit ut C. D. summa, ut E. F.

Haec Chelyum fabris proportio Commendatur.


De Plectro seu Arcu Musico.
PLectri Arcus rigidus sit, mediocri pondere: Setae ad duos pedes quadrantemque
tensae, asserculo haud oblongo, ad digiti latitudinem aut paullo altius,
attollantur; qui quasi Isthmus setas ab Arcu distineat.

De Collocatione Chelyos.
UBI te apta in sede collocaveris, Chelyn utroque genu decenter complectere,
ejusque pars ima suris utrimque innitatur. Pedes tantillum divaricati solo
firmiter insistant. Chelys summa ad sinistrum humerum leniter proclinet; ut eo
situ, etiam nullo manus fulcimento persistat.

Quomodo tenendus et movendus Arcus.
A Prehendatur Arcus prope Isthmum extremo pollice duobusque primoribus
digitis; ita ut Pollex and Index caudicem teneant, alterque digitus parumper
instexus setis obluctetur: eo pacto nimirum librabitur arcus, ne slaccidus ad
extremum pendeat. Adhiberi potest and annularis, si ejus open caeteri indigeant;
quamvis ad minuritiones id minuus conveniat.

Extento fidenter brachio, Fides haud procul a ponticulo sigillatim liquideque
vibrentur, genibus ne forte offendiculo sint, caute reductis.



De Sinistrae Collocatione, Motuque.
JVgum Chelyos ne manu constringe, ut in Violinis fit; sed ut in Testudine
Pollicem averso Manubrio ita applica, ut Indici in adverso Canone se moventi
plerumque respondeat. Hinc faciliori negotio manus pro re nata in omnem partem
perlabetur.

De Chelyos Chordotonia ad Scalam Musicam accommodata.
QVilibet fere Musicae candidatus Scalam Guidonianam callere solet; qua probe
intellecta, Chelyos attemperatio seu Chordotonia adjectae Tabellae open facile
adornabitur. Infima siquidem Semibrevis dabit tonum infimae Chordae in D. unde
caeterarum discrimen sumetur in G. C. E. A. D. Reliquos tonos supra D.
assequeris, si Chordam supremam per intervalla quae Ligulis designantur,
ponticulum versus gradatim presseris.

^

Attemperata jam Chely, reliquos sonos seu notas sursum deorsumque modulari si
velis, quibus id digitis perficias adjecti monent numeri, 1, 2, 3, 4; 1 Indicem
signat, 2 Medium, 3 Annularem 4 Minimum.

Qua ratione eaedem Notae in diversis Chordis exprimi possint.
ANimadvertendum porro est, earundem Notarum sonos, qui vel apertis Chordis,
vel per consuetos ligularum gradus exprimuntur, commodiore digitorum
applicatione in superioribus ligulis, atque aliena saepe in Chorda elici; uti
videre est iis in notis quibus appositus est Asteriscus: Earum nempe sonus,
tametsi paulo ante in suprema Chorda expressus fuerit, in altera tamen Stropha,
pressis secundae chordae ligulis, perinde ut in prima consequitur: Quod tuo
ipse Mart, dum digitorum commodo studes, identidem tentando explorabis.

Ex plurimis Scalae Musicae lineis, quinque tantummodo in usum Chelyos
assumuntur, cumque in Melodiae decursu Nota aliqua Pentadem evaserit, apposita
clavi altera, ad alteram similiter Pentadem reducitur.

In proximo Paradigmate operae pretium feceris, si manum sensim exerceas, nec
nisi lent admodum festines, id imprimis studens, ut suus cuique Notae sonus,
liquidus plenusque constet: quod fiet, si chordas extremis omnino digitis
constanter ac valide premas; tum Arcu, quantus quantus est, rursum prorsum
ducto singulas chromas distinct ad plenum evibres.

^

Quare Digiti sinistrae in eadem saepe sede continuandi sint.
SIquem ligulis digitum appresseris, eum, dum reliquis digitis caetera
exequeris, ne prius attolle quam id alia occasio postulet; quo pacto,
aequabiliori digitorum decursui consules, absque hiulco incertoque tripudio,
sonumque etiam sublato arcu continuabis. Ejus morae signum *; ab ea nota cui
digitum immorari oportet, ad eam usque extenditur, qua vibrata sustolli potest.

Regula movendi Arcum.
CVm numerum chromarum vel semichromarum parem observaveris, ut 2, 4, 6, 8.
Prorsum movendus est Arcus, tametsi in praecedenti Nota consimili motu adactus
fuerit; Quod si numerum imparem deprehenderis, ut 3, 5, 7; quod fere ob Notam
puncto auctam, aut pausas impares contingit, retrorsum revocandus est; quamvis
id subinde exceptionem patiatur, Cujus rei exemplum sub calcem Paradigmatis 5
reperies.

^

Quo ordine Digiti Canoni applicandi sint.
SIquando Minuritio ad extremas ligulas aut etiam ulterius processerit, Suprema
Nota tertio aut quarto digito premitur: Si tertio, primus and secundus in
proximis Notis ascendentibus vel descendentibus ordine suo occupantur: Si Nota
suprema quartum digitum seu Minimum vendicarit, Nota proxima si dura fuerit,
tertium; si mollis, secundum postulabit. Id vero certo certius statues, sive
tertium sive quartum suprema Nota distineat, Tertiam inferiorem Indice
premendam esse, unde ad caeteras Notas auspicandus est transitus. Quod si binas
notas proxime sibi succedentes eidem digito assignatas repereris, id propterea
fit, ut digiti ad praedictam Syntaxin disponantur, vel ut consimilis positurae
digitorum in alteram sedem transferatur. Observandum tamen Minimo digito rarius
locum esse versus Ponticulum, ubi interstitia tonorum ac Semitonorum
contractiora sunt, quam inter ligulas ubi majori dissident intervallo.

Quo porro ordine de Chorda in Chordam digiti movendi sint, sua quisque
industria facile indagabit, dum eorum expeditiori progressui consulit.

^

Quis motus Brachio dextro, Manusque juncturae conveniat.
QVod ad Brachii motum attinet; quamvis humeri juncturam movere saepenumero
necesse sit tardioribus in Notis, in celerioribus tamen vix id fieri poterit
absque totius corporis indecora succussatione. Quare ad notas breviores non
nisi Junctura manus moveri extento rigide brachio ut plurimum debet, in
aequabili praesertim minuritione; idque ad decentem corporis compositionem
Tyronibus maxim commendatur. Vbi tamen minuritio hinc inde subsultat, aut non
admodum properat, cubiti motum cum manus Junctura una conspirare opus est. Vt
arcus pro imperio gubernetur, ne non junctura porro debite moveatur, curandum
ut dum Arcus rursum prorsum vibratur, brachii motum manus aut quasi dux
tantisper procedat, aut quasi assecla proxime ancilletur.

Ad paradigma proximum in C fa ut, melius exprimendum, demittitur chorda infima
ad intervallum unius Notae, ut sic siat Octava Chordae antepenultimae, quod in
illa Clavi plerumque observatur. Vitabis autem frequentes quorumdam errores;
primo si lent primum Notas singulas, deinde aucta dexteritate, ac matura
audacia celerius percurras. Secundo, si sategeris ut Arens ac digitorunt motus
apprime conspirent. Tertio, si Arcus mediocri distantia tum a Ponticulo, tum ab
extremo suo cornu seu apice Chordas impellat.

^

Quomodo plures simul Notae perstringendae sint.
CVm plures Notas alias aliis superimpositas conspexeris, uno omnes ictu ita
vil^andae sunt, ut ab ima ad supremam, medias in occursu perstringendo,
progrediatur Arcus; ac sinistrorsum propellatur, ubi ejusmodi Notae duplices,
triplices, aut plures non nisi semel se offerunt; ast ubi saepius multiplici
serie continuantur, ad sinistram primo, deinde ad dexteram agitari debet
plectrum, Motusque ab ima semper chorda inchoandus est.

^

In Paradigmate figurae 1, 2, 3, 4, Notis non supra verticem sed ad latus
adscribuntur. Vbi autem hanc figuram (1) in eodem Notarum cumulo saepius
repetitam videris, indicium est primum digitum ad omnes ejusmodi Notas protendi
debere, ut in Thiorba sieri solet.

Aliud minuritionum Paradigma subjungitur. Plura, ubi te accurata firmaverit
exercitatio, ad calcem libri in promptu habes.

^

De Triplis.
TRiplas (sive Minimis sive Semiminimis constent, sive eae deinde in tenuiores
minutias dividantur, sive Basi communis mensurae superstruantur, adeo ut uni
Minimae tres Semiminimae, aut uni Semiminimae tres Chromae, aut uni Chromae
tres Semichromae respondeant) facile modulaberis, modo singulae mensurae binis
utrimque lineis definiantur.

De Sonorum blanditiis atque Leporibus.
LEpores varii ac elegantiae Notis adhiberi possunt, vel Arcu, vel Digitis.
Arcu nunc incitatius nunc remissius chordae pulsantur; prout cujusque genius
aut melismatis indoles suaserit: quae impulsus varietas eidem aliquando Notae
adhibetur, ita ut exordio submissiori paullatim assurgat vehementius and quasi
intumescat. Nonnulli arcu trepidare ac vacillare gestiunt, cujus frequentior
usus vix probatur. Plures subinde consequentes Notae eodem Arcus impulsu
venuste exprimuntur.

Nec non sinistrae manus digitis varius quasi color Notis appingitur, vel cum
ad vocis aemulationem unius Notae sonus in sonum alterius quodammodo
colliquescere cogitur, apposito vel retracto digito, paullo post Arcus
impulsum. Id si in ascensu fiat, Assurrectio; si in descensu, Delapsus, vocari
potest.

Nonnunquam via sternitur ad Notam, cum in eadem Chorda, vel a tertia inferiori
ad eam sensim adrepimus, diciturque Elevatio, nunc rarius in usu: vel cum idem
fit a Tertia superiori, estque quasi Delapsus duplex.

Aliquando Nota subsequens praecedentis Notae sonum particulamque mutuatur,
assumpto sibi ab altera puncti incremento, atque unius ejusdem vibrationis
beneficio utraque Nota coalescit; unde Coalitio dici potest.

Accidit etiam, ut exspirante fere Notae Sono, alterius digiti appressio
eliciat acuti nescio quid, atque adeo Acumen nuncupari queat.

Lepores ex tremoribus oriundi.
DIversis praeterea tremoribus Notis accrescit gratia. Pressius cum tremitur
leni admodum crispatione, vix variatur sonus, secus, cum apertius. Hoc
elegantiae genus exoritur, cum intra Toni distantiam fit tremor a loco, a quo
aut ad quem transit digitus. Hujusce Tremoris variae sunt species. 1o Cum ad
Notam sequentem assurgit digitus intremiscens, dicique potest Tremula
Assurrectio. 2o. Cum a Nota praecedenti recedit digitus cum Tremore; unde
Tremulus Delapsus vocari potest.

Quo pacto vero in Elevatioue, Coalitione, etc. Tremor fiat, ex ipso
Paradigmate adjecto, ubi signis characteristicis apponuntur Notae exponentes,
clarius elucescit.

Si quid praeterea in vocis ornamentis, Trillis, Gruppis, reliquisque
Teretismis singular est, digitorum blandimento simplicique Arcus vibratione ad
Chelyn concinne tranferri potest.

Inter has elegantias aliae sunt Masculinae, ut Assurrectio and Delapsus,
Bassoque potissimum convenient: aliae Femininae, quae scilicet Tremore leni vel
nullo fiunt; Superiorique seu Netodo inserviunt maxim: tametsi pro varietate

PARS SECUNDA.
Melothesiae Compendium.
MElothesiam seu Compositionem Musicam aliquot hic praeceptis complecti visum
est. Qua in re, tametsi quidam a Tenore seu Mesodo, nempe quod illi Parti in
Cantu Ecclesiae plano seu Gregoriano ceterae accinant atque subserviant,
reliquorum concentuum rationem distantiamque desumant; in nostra tamen Methodo,
a Basso seu Hypatodo quasi a Substrato ac Fundamento caeterarum Partium
Intervalla numerare multo erit opportunius.

De Intervallis.
PRimum contemplationi se nostrae sistit Vnisonus seu Isophonos, ejusdem
videlicet Soni seu Notae Repelilio, vel potius duarum Notarum in eundem Sonum
conspiratio; valetque perinde ac Vnitas in Arithmetica, Punctum aut Centrum in
Geometria, estque in nulla divisibilis intervalla. Dum Soni ab Vnisono plus
minusve recedunt, varia oriuntur Intervallorum genera. Secunda inprimis, quae
dividitur in perfectam and imperfectam: Perfecta vocatur Tonus, qui in duos ex
aequo Semisses, si Soni proportionem spectes, findi nequit. Attribuuntur ei a
plerisque novem Commata seu minora segmenta; quorum bina consiciant Diaschisma,
quatuor Semitonium Minus, quinque Semitonium Majus, adeo ut discrimen inter
utramque hanc Secundam imperfectam sit unius Commatis, quam differentiam
Apotomen nuncupant. Nonnulli subtilius observant aliquid Tono deesse, quo minus
novem Commata expleat; itidem Semitonio Majori quo minus quinque, Minori quo
minus quatuor attingat. Sed haec cum ad nostrum institutum haud admodum
conducant, aliis quibus vacat, pensiculatius indaganda relinquimus, uti and
caeterorum Intervallorum accuratiores minutias.

Tertia dividitur in perfectam seu majorem quae Ditonus vocatur, and
imperfectam seu minorem quae dicitur Semeditonus. Notandum vero particulam Semi
seu Seem hic atque alibi saepe, non signisicare Semissem sed defectum Soni,
utpote qui ad justi intervalli metam non pertingat.

Quarta dividitur in majorem quae Tritonus dicitur, estque intervallum
prohibitum, and minorem quae Diatessaron nuncupatur.

Quinta dividitur in Perfectam, quae Diapente appellatur; and Impersectam, quae
Semidiapente, seu falsa Quinta, vocatur.

Sexta dividitur in majorem, quae Hexachordon majus, seu Tonus cum Diapente
dicitur, and minorem quae Hexachordon minus sive Semitonium cum Diapente
nominatur.

Septima dividitur in majorem, quae Ditonus cum Diapente, and minorem quae
Semiditonus cum Diapente nuncupatur.

Octava dividitur in Perfectam, quae Diapason (seu per omnes chordas)
appellatur, and Imperfectam quae Semidiapason dicitur.

His Intervallis variae Concordantiae ac Discordantiae continentur, quarum
genesis ac ordo subjecto Schemate exhibetur, in quo Octavam vides in duodecim
divisam Hemitonia, cujusmodi in Chelyos Canone aliisque Instrumentis secundum
Scalam Diatonicam reperire est; ubi quia plura quam duodecim Segmenta seu
diastemata non distinguuntur, nullum discrimen (quoad Intervalla) apparet inter
Tritonum and Semediapente; cum utriusque distantia a quinta perfecta unius
duntaxat sit Semitonii: quamvis in praxi Tritonus Quartae, Semediapente Quintae
speciem prae se ferat.



De Concordantiis.
QVatuor ex his vocantur Concordantiae; Iertia, Quinta, Sexta, Diapason,
earumque Octavae; Tria reliqua intervalla dicuntur Discordantiae; Secunda,
Quarta (tametsi hanc quidam Concordantiis subinde annumerent) Septima, earumque
Octavae.

Inter Concordantias duae sunt Perfectae; Quinta and Octava: ita dictae, quod
aures plena quadam Voluptate permulceant. Reliquae duae sunt Imperfectae,
Tertia and Sexta; ita nuncupatae, quod tenuiori concentu aure's recreant.

Transitio Concordantiarum.
OBservandum porro duas Persectas ejusdem generis Concordantias sibi invicem
succedentes, verbi gratia, duas simul Quintas, aut binas continenter Octavas,
quod auditum nimia satietate oppleant, prohiberi; nisi forte adversis sibi
motibus, (in pluribus presertim partibus) occurrant, aut in eadem sede
consistant.

Illicita Illicita Licita Licita Licita in pluribus partibus ^5 5 5 5 8 8 8 8 5
5 5 8 8 8 8 8 5 5 5 ^Not allowed Not allowed Allowed Allowed Allowed in many
parts

A Quinta tamen ad Octavam, aut ab Octava ad Quintam promiscue transiri potest;
modo altera Pars sixa in statione permaneat, aut non nisi gradatim se moveat.
Nam si Parts per saltum una progrediantur, minus grata ista Perfectarum
collocatio accidet.

Imperfectae vero Concordantiae ascendendo aut descendendo continuari possunt.

Denique ab una Concordantia ad aliam transire nil vetat, modo evitetur Relatio
non harmonica, quae tum accidit, cum Nota mollis durae inconcinne absoueque
opponitur.

De Melothesiae Clavi seu Tono.
OMnis porro Melothesia ad Clavem aliquam seu Tonum reducitur, in quo nimirum
Bassus post varias fluctuationes quasi in Portu anchoram jacit. Tonus durus
dicitur, cum Tertia supra Notam Toni cardinalem dura est seu Ditonus. Tonus
denominatur Mollis, si praedicta Tertia mollis fuerit seu Semiditonus.

Mollis Durus Mollis Durus Mollis Durus^ Mollis Durus Mollis Durus Mollis
Durus^ Mollis Durus Mollis Durus^

Observandum porro Tonos Duros, tametsi alii aliis peregriniores appareant,
omnes esse non affines modo sed ejusdem plane indolis; adeo ut per
Transpositionem, non solum quotquot hic sunt reliqui, sed quotquot omnino
excogitari possunt, ad primum in G. nullo negotio revocentur. Quod de Tonis
Mollibus perinde intelligendum est.

Ad Tonum Bassi parts caeterae componumtur.

Horum omnium periculum optime fiet in Contrapuncto. Est autem Contrapunctus
cum Nota supra Notam, sine coloribus, Musice construitur.

Qua ratione Bassus conformandus sit.
IAciatur itaque imprimis fundamentum; hoc est, Bassus concinnetur iis legibus:
Primo, ut Tono conveniat, Cadentiis intermediis, siquae fuerint, assumptis
finali clausulae haud alienis; in Quinta videlicet aut Tertia superius. In Tonc
tamen duro vice Tertiae, in qua Cadentia minime convenit, assumatur Quarta aut
Secunda.

^5 3 5 4 2

Secundo, Bassus moveatur plerumque per Saltus ad Tertiam, Quartam, and
Quintam; gradibusque duntaxat iis gaudeat, quibus intra Toni fines coerceatur.
Cantus autem gradario ut plurimum incessu procedat.

Tertio denique, auspicium sumatur a Tono molli, sepositis consulto, ad majorem
facilitatem, Notis duris.

^ 3

Quo pacto Cantus Basso adstruendus sit.
SVperstrue porro Cantum Basso, adhibendo Tertias, Quintas, Octavas (seclusis
tantisper Sextis, quae Notis duris congruunt maxim) ut quaeque vicinior
magisque in promptu est. Numerosque arithmeticos 3, 5, 8, utpote
Concordantiarum characteres inscribe; ut sic vel ad oculum pateat cujusmodi
sint.

Cantus.^ Bassus.^

Notandum vero, ubi parts pauciores concinunt, imperfect as Concordantias
praelegendas perfectis, ut aurium fastidio consulatur. Hinc in Biciniis raro
usurpatur Octava, nisi in principio, clausula finali, aut intermedia, velcum
parts contrariis incedunt motibus.

De Triphoniis.
HIsce peractis, si alteram forte Partem annectere velis, verbi gratia, Altum,
cujus seeds est proxime infra Cantum, vide Concordantiis utaris, quae ad Cantum
propius accedunt; Tertiamque in alterutra Part nunquam omittas, dum Tricinium
adornas.

Cantus.^ Altus.^ Bassus.^

Vides in Paradigmate Cantum and Altum ambos in Octava desinere; quod in Tono
molli convenientius videtur, quam si Cantus transisset in Tertiam duram, quae
in ultima Clausula gregariae atque interiori Parti in Polyphoniis potius
convenit.

Quando Bassus assurgit ad Quartam, aut descendit ad Quintam, Nota quae
praecedit hujusmodi ascensum vel descensum requirit Tertiam majorem; unde
secundam and penultimam Alti notam duplicato decussi ad gradum Ditoni elevatam
vides.

De Tetraphoniis.
UBi te in Triphoniis jam satis exercueris, ad Tetraphonia transire poteris,
caeteris Partibus adjuncto Tenore. Quaedam autem hic observanda. 1o Vt Pars
assumpta adornetur Concordantiis, quantum fieri poterit, ab utraque alia Part
diversis. 2o Vt quam proxime Alto subnectatur; tum enim harmonia perfectissima
consurgit, cum Parts superiores maxim sunt affines atque conterminae. 3o Vt
duarum Quintarum and Octavarum consecutionem non minus inter superiores Parts,
quam inter illas and Bassum ascendendo aut descendendo fugias.

In Paradigmat, penultimam Alti, in duas Semiminimas divisam vides, quarum
prior Notae praecedenti colligatur, unde ligatura vocatur, Cadentiamque exornat
plurimum: quod imitari poteris qualibet in Part, quae Ditonum Basso occinit in
Nota penultima.

Cantus.^ 3 5 3 5 3 5 5 3 5 8 Altus.^ 8 3 8 3 8 3 3 8 3 8 Tenor.^ 5 8 5 8 5 8 8
5 8 3 Bassus.^

Vbi huic Methodo assueveris, majori deinde cum liberate omnes simul Parts
componere fas erit, quavis cuilibet parti attributa Concordantia, modo sua
singulis assignetur, nec interea omittatur Tertia.

De Sexta.
HActenus nihil actum de Sexta; quae tum adhibetur (loco Quintae) cum Bassus in
Notis duris versatur, quales fere sunt Ditonus supra Tonum Melothesiae,
Semiditonus infra, atque illa Nota quae Primariae proxime substat; ejusmodi
enim notae durae Sextam postulant. Vide Paradigma.

Cantus.^ 3 6 3 3 3 3 8 3 5 8 Altus.^ 8 3 3 8 8 6 5 8 3 8 Tenor.^ 5 8 6 5 5 3 3
5 8 3 Bassus.^ 1 2 3

Notandum vero 1o Quintam and Sextam in Contrapuncto nunquam simul usurpari. 2o
Semitonium infra Cardinalem Bassi Notam Octavam sine aurium offensione non
admittere; quare amandata Octava duae parts in eadem potius Tertia invicem
complecti debent. 3o Bases quae notis ut plurimum constant poscentibus Sextam,
paucioribus quam pluribus Partibus aptiores esse. 4o Bassum, cum ejusmodi Notas
recipit, carere ad sui complementum ac latitudinem debitam, Ditono inferiori;
quem si subnectas, jam Sextae mutabuntur in Octavas, Tertiae in Quintas,
quaeque fuisset Semitonii Octava sed inconcinna, jam cum lepore fit Tertia.

Cantus.^ 3 8 5 3 3 5 8 3 5 3 Altus.^ 8 5 3 8 8 8 5 8 3 8 Tenor.^ 5 3 8 5 5 3 3
5 8 5 Bassus.^

Ex his omnibus patet, non nisi tres reperiri Consonantias eodem simul tempore
Basso insistentes; eaeque sunt Tertia, Quinta, vel Sexta, and Octava. Quod si
plures quam quatuor Parts componere animus est, praedictae consonantiae in
suis Compositis sen Octavis repraesentandae sunt; Vnde, dum duarum Quintarum
aut Octavarum consecutionem declinas, suavem ac versicolorem Melodiae texturam
consurgere necesse est.

Quis Discordantiis locus sit.
DIscordantiarum in Musica duplex est usus. Primo, in Diminutione; cum
videlicet binae, trinae, aut plures Notae sibi invicem gradatim subnexae, uni
alterius Partis Notae respondent. Providendum tamen, ut primitia Nota sit
Concors.

^ 5 4 (...) 6 7 8 7 (...) 8 7 6 5 (...) 3 4 5 6 ^ 3 4 (...) 5 4 5 6

Hic observa duas, tres, aut plures subinde Notas in eadem linea vel Spatio
consistentes, instar unius longioris notae considerari posse; atque adeo easdem
omnino pati Discordantias, quas admitteret Nota illa integra longior, cujus hae
particulae censentur.

^ 7 6 5 4 3 2 3 8 7 5 ^ 8 2 3 4 5 6

Secundo, Discordantiis locus est in Syncopsi ac Ligaturis; cum nimirum pars
una nexu quodam ac colligatione duarum Notarum in eadem statione detinetur,
atque ab allisione alterius Partis quae interea progreditur quasi conscindi
videtur: habetque id plurimum elegantiae, si non temere sed cum iudicio fiat.

Syncopsis in Dyphoniis.

^ 8 7 6 6 5 4 3 4 6 7 6 8 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 23 8 3 23 2323 2 3 4 6 4 3 8 ^ 5676

3 3 3 3 3 843 843 843 8 3 3 3 3 434 3 4 3 8

Et quamvis Discordantia initio alicujus Notae in Basso applicatur, nihil
interest, modo particula prior ligaturae ei Concors sit, ac deinde
Discordantiam emolliat Concordantia subsequens, quae Imperfecta plerumque esse
debet.

Auribus vero per discordantias concordantiasque imperfect as varia
expectatione traductis atque suspensis tum demum fiet satis, cum in perfectis
Concordantiis Melodia quodammodo colliquescit. Idcirco enim Discordantiis in
Musica concessus est locus, tum, ut varietati consulatur, tum, ut ejusmodi
asperitate quasi vellicatae aures Consonantiarum successione levari ac
permulceri gestiant.

Transitus autem Discordantiarum ad Concordantias imperfectas maxim vicinas
fieri ut plurimum debet: quod etiam in progressione Imperfect arum ad perfectas
observandum est. Hinc Sexta major ad Octavam, minor ad Quintam genuino lapsu
pergit. Atque hac aequabili gradatione, suavior absque incon dita subsultatione
Melodia redditur.

De Tritono, and Semidiapente.
QVamvis supra dictum sit, Tritonum and Semidiapente intervalla prohibita, ac
Discordantias plerumque censeri; est tamen eorum usus nonnunquam in Musica
elegantissimus. Nam etiam absque Syncope Basso cum gratia opponuntur, quod
aliis discordantiis, nisi forte veterani Musurgi peritia site attemperentur,
vix conceditur.

^Semidiapente Tritone Tritonus. Semidiapente.

Curandumque ut Tritonus ad Sextam, Semidiapente ad Tertiam transeat.

Example.

^Tritonus. Semidiapente.

Diximus praeterea Quintam vna cum Sexta in eadem Contrapuncti plani sede
comparere neutiquam posse: Secus est, quando Semidiapente in posteriori part
ligaturae adhibetur; tunc enim requirit Patrocinium atque unbraculum Sextae, ut
sese auribus gratius sistat. Quo in casu, si recte expendatur, Semidiapente
supplet locum discordis Septimae, ac Sexta ei imminens obit vices Octavae; ut
facile patebit, si Bassum ad Tertiam inferius demiseris.

Contemplatio Concordantiarum Musicarum.
ATque hic quis non jure merito obstupescat, cum animum subit ex Concordantiis
dumtaxat tribus, paucis subinde intertextis discordantiis, tam innumerabilis
prognata soboles, ut quicquid unquam Melothesiae fuit vel futurum est, ex his
quasi elementis coalescat. Auget admirationem per septem distributa Gradus,
(unde haec concordia discors emanat) tam apta Sonorum complexio, eodem
literarum ordine in Scala Musica exhibita, quo recursantes per annum dierum
Hebdomadas primaevae rerum originis imaginem repraesentamus.

Numerum hunc Orpheus fastis immortalibus consecravit, cum Lyram suam, (quae a
Pythagora Samio in Aegyptiorum adytis reperta olim, atque e tenebris in bono
lumine collocata, Alexandri temporibus etiamnum superstes fuit) Heptachordam
esse voluit; ut septenis Fidibus septem Planetarum discursus atque concentum,
quoties fila pulsaret, auribus atque animo sisteret. Neque vero absimilis est
Sonorum ac Siderum harmonia, cum illorum concordia horum aspectibus ad amussim
respondeat. Isophonia siquidem Astrorunt refert Conjunctionem; exiremi Diapason
termini, Oppositioneni; comprehensae intra Octavam Concordantiae, Tertia,
Quinta, Sexta, Trinum, Sextilem caeterosque in Zodiaco aspectus intermedios.
Vtque Planetarum varia inter se collocatio orbi inferiori alios atque alios
impertit influxus, ita diversa Sonorum Eucrasia miros in auribus animisque
motus excitat, quibus in omnis harmoniae authorem admirabili sursum
contemplatione rapiantur. Vnde suum in Templis sacrisque locum Musica jure
merito vendicat.

Nec vacat Mysterio, ternos per intervalla sonos invicem superimpositos
universae Harmoniae medullam ac summam ambientis vinculi nodo nexuque
complecti. Divinae illius Monadis Triadisque, nutu suo omnia in ordine pondere
et mensura gubernantis, non leve simulachrum; quo nihil ad Musicae landem
illustrius, nihil excellentius.

Reliqua itaque huc attexere, tametsi admiranda, nil attinet; cujusmodi sunt,
fidem pulsatam ab altera homophona side etiam intacta responsionem quodammodo
aliquam acclamationemque accipere: Tubas, caeteraque ejusmodi oblonga
instrumenta pneumatica, Sonos gradatim consequentes modulanti negare, nisi
prius per solitas concordantias Saltitando exordium feceris.

Musicarum Concordantiarum Analogia ad Planetarum aspectus.
SEptem in sequenti Schemate gradatim soni, quos intra Limits Diapason, stilus
Diatonicus exhibet, in linea Diametro arithmetice repraesentantur. Circulus
Zodiacum refert, aspectumque Planetarum, cujus intersectionibus Octavae
partitiones exact respondent. Extremi siquidem ejus termini Conjunctionem
Oppositionemque imitantur. Partitio media, quae hinc Quartam, inde Quintam
respicit, adumbrat. Tertia ac Sexta Octavam ut ac * Hemicyclum explent. Quibus
add, Octavam duodecim constare Hemitoniis; non secus ac Zodiacus signa
duodecim variis animalium figuris descripta complectitur.

Figura infima Omnes omnino sonos quotquot concentum simul efficient, Ternarii
Harmonia identidem repetita contineri demonstrat.



Benedicta sit sancta et individua Frinitac


CHELYS, Minuritionum Artificio Exornata. PARS TERTIA.
Qua ratione Minuritiones ad Basin aptandae sint.
MInuritio ad Basin nihil aliud est, quam aut ipsius Baseos, aut aliarum
Partium, quae Basi accini possunt, in varias melicas Minutias Sectio; unde
vulgo Divisio Musica appellatur. Ea, uti omnium fere Instrumentorum Musicorum,
ita Chelyos imprimis perfectio Summa est. Rem omnem, si cui peregrina est,
verbo primum complectar; deinde fusius artis documenta subjungam.

Fundamentum quodvis recte concinnatum bis describitur; cujus exemplar alterum
Organo, Clavicymbalo, seu alii Instrumento sustinendum traditur; alterum ob
oculos Musurgi variis Melodiae elegantiis exornandum proponitur, quibus
inventionem dexteritatemque pariter ostentet: quod nonnullis faeliciter adeo
succedit, ut Auditores non modo singulari voluptate permulceant, sed
admiratione etiam incredibili non raro percellant.

Quod si ad tantam excellentiam primasque pertingere paucis conceditur, ac
reliquis certe in secundis non sine laud consistere licebit; si, quod
inventioni deest, dexteritate explere, atque aliorum compositiones concinne
modulari nitatur: tametsi enim hoe admirationis minus fortasse habeat, quod hic
aliena utendum sit opera, ac sedula praemeditatio plerumque antecedat,
Melothesiae tamen praestantia exacteque modulandi industria plus saepe affert
voluptatis. Atque ut ab hoc inferiori gradu ad altiorem conscendere pluribus in
promptu sit, visum est hujusce artificii fontes omnibus aperire, ac publici
juris facere.

Minuritionum genera.
EX Definitione jam tradita, triplex enascitur Minuritionum species.

Prima simplicissima, quae Fundamentalis dici potest, utpote quae fundamenti
duntaxat longiores Notas, in breviores celerioresque dividat.

Secunda magis composita, quae Melothetica nominari poterit; nempe, quae Basso
superiorum Partium minutias superstruit.

Tertia ex utraque mixta, quae fractiones tum Bassi, tum aliarum Vocum, vel
agglomeratis conjunctim, vel sparsis sigillatim Notis exhibet.

Hae pro cujusque genio promiscue, nullo servato ordine, usurpari possunt. Nos
vero ut ordinem doctrinae observemus, a simplicioribus ad complexa seu
composita progrediemur.

Minuritio Fundamentalis.
MInuritio Fundamenti vary perficitur, dum Semibrevis in duas Minimas, quatuor
Semiminimas, octo Fusas, sexdecim Semifusas, etc. comminuitur.

Idque fit primo cum Minutiae vel in eadem Vnisona sede, vel in Octava
consistant.

Paradigma.

^

Secundo, cum variatur quidem Sonus, deflexione tamen adeo exigua, ut tenuis
admodum Melodiae immutatio percipiatur; dum a Nota diminuta tantillum
receditur, ac subito ad eam regressus fit.

Paradigma.

^

Tertio, cum Minutiae adhibentur per modum Transitionis de Nota ad Notam, uti
in apposito Paradigmate videre est, ubi transitiones ad singula unius Octavae
intervalla, tum in ascensu tum in descensu repraesentantur.

Paradigma.

^ 3 4 5 6 7 8 Ascending. ^Descending ^ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Ascending. ^Descending ^
2 3 4 5 6 Ascending. ^Descending. 7 8 2 3 4 ^ 5 6 7 8 ^Ascending ^Descending

Adjecimus praeterea exemplum in Clavisuperiori, cum hic transitionum decursus
omnibus passim vocibus inserviat.

Quarto, quando Minutiae a Nota diminuta in alias Concordantias per Saltus
prosiliunt.

Paradigma.

^ 853 468 85635 853468 853

Quinto, dum ad dictas Concordantias gradatim pergitur, trium aut quatuor
Notarum sese consequentium fluxu continuo. Qui modus etsi fere ad Secundam
Minuritionum Speciem pertineat, cum tamen Basin potissimum respiciat, cujus
Notis, perexigua exorbitatione, inhaerit, ad primam revocari non immerito
potest.

^These pass up to the 3.d These to the 5.th These to the 8.th These to a 3.d
higher These to a 5.th higher. ^These to a 3.d These to a 5.th These to an 8.th
These to a 3.d higher ^2 These pass to the 4.th below These to a 6.th below
These to the 8.th below These into Concords both above and below.

Curandum vero 1o ut minutiae, dum ad Concordantias transeunt, ad Basin
harmonice construantur. 2o Vt ad proximam Basis Notam affini quodam Motu
suaviter perlabantur. 3o Si quando minutiae ad Discordantiam transeunt, id
locis congruis, ubi eae videlicet in Melothesia adhiberi assolent, et ex art
fiat.

^As thus. Exemp: Gratia. ^ 3 This pusses into a 4.th This into a 7.th

Minuritio ad initium sequentis Notae apt deducetur, si (ut fere contingit in
transitione ad Concordantias) tres aut certe duae ultimae minutiae ad hujusmodi
Notam gradatim ascendant vel descendant: ut in adjecto. Paradigmate
demonstratur, ubi Semibrevis in G. dividitur per varias transitiones ad
quodlibet intervallum Diapason.

^As thus or thus Thus or thus Thus or thus ^Thus or thus etc: ^

Atque hic incedendi modus probatur, sive lentior sive velocior sit minuritio,
quae quo suerit incitatior, plures minutias postulabit, uti experientia constat.

Jam vero quemadmodum harum regularum intelligentiam praxis perficiet, ita
praxin habitus facilitasque consequentur. Hanc in rem juvabit Fundamentum
aliquod facile seu substratum concinnare, cujus Notas singulas ad praecedentium
praeceptorum normam in varias Minutias frangas.

Cavendum autem 1o ut nativo quodam processu, quod supra monuimus, Minutiae
fluant: nec Notae durae aut molles temere inserantur, nisi quas Melodia
Fundamenti ac Toni indoles exigit.

Notandum 2o, Septimam ac Sextam in descensu aequipollere Secundae aut Tertiae
in ascensu, ut exemplo hic demonstratur.

Paradigma.

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8^7 6 5 4 3 2 8

Atque adeo eodem redit, sive succedenti Notae in Vnisono occurras, sive in
Octava. De Octavis enim eadem est ratio.

3o Vbi Basis, vel ad Quintam descendendo vel ad Quartam ascendendo, Cadentiam
prae se fert, Notas quae vel in Tertia superius vel inferius in Sexta ei
accommodantur, duras plerumque esse oportet.

Vltimo quemadmodum Minuritio Basin supergreditur in Tertia aut Quinta; ita ad
earumdem Concordantiarum Octavas, hoc est, ad Sextam, and Quartam, cum inferius
movetur, delabi debet.

535 535 535^464 464 464

Hisee praecognitis, Basin in Minutias frangere proximo Paradigmate disces: ubi
claritatis causa minutiae Singulis Fundamenti Notis superscribuntur.

An Example of Breaking the Ground^

In secunda autem variatione, sub initium tertiae mensurae, Basi occurritur in
Tertia; qui videlicet occursus eo loco maxim videbatur genuinus; adeoque
isthic atque alibi ad imitationem proponitur; si quando Melodiae decursus
istiusmodi contextum suaserit. Non absimilem occursum in Quinta, tertia mensura
variationis tertiae exhibet.

Disputant nonnulli, quid in Minutiis de Septima Superius and Secunda inferius
statuendum sit; debeatne videlicet duritiem induere, tametsi natura mollis sit.
In istiusmodi subitis mutationibus, tametsi aurium potissime judicio standum
sit, plerumque tamen haec regula observari potest, ut dum a Nota cardinali ad
Secundam aut Septimam descenditur, rursumque ad eandem Notam ascenditur, signum
B duri [*] apponatur.

Minuritio Melothetica.
DIffert Melothetica a Minuritione simplici Fundamentali, quod illa Notas Basis
duntaxat concerpit, nunc supra nunc infra (haud longa tamen ambage) ab isto suo
Polo digrediens: Haec vero Basso usque supereminet, ac coelo liberiore fruitur,
e qualibet voce seu Part superiori Minutias versicolores depromens,
Concordantiis debitis vel saltuatim vel gradatim Bassum inumbrans,
Discordantiasque legitime intertexens.

Regulas easdem admittit quas Melothesia; perque Tertias, Quintas, Octavas
incedit: Quintarum aut Octavarum consecutionem evitans; Troposque affectat
consimiles iis, quos in Minuritione simplici descripsimus. 1o Minutias in
Vnisono persistentes. 2o Soni variationem, servato in diminutionibus eodem fere
Melodiae tenore. 3o Transitiones de Nota ad Notam, ascendendo vel descendendo
per duos aut tres vicinores gradus. 4o Concordantiarum ex alia in aliam
desultorios motus. 5o Liberiorem per plures gradus ad varias Concordantias
decursum.

Discordantiae, ut dictum est, sub initium mensurae, nisi in Syncope, non
adhibentur. Sexta diminutionem raro inchoat, nisi forte in ligatura, aut ubi
eam Basis desiderat vice Quintae; cum scilicet duriores Bassi Notae Sextam
minorem expotunt, aut Molliores etiam majorem, ad melodiae suaviorem contextum

De b Molli and Duro.
HIc si quaeras, cur Fusae in B, appositum sit b molle; id propterea sit, quod
Minuritio inde ad F mollioris itidem soni descendat; uti paulo post, F.b. duro
atollitur; quia nimirum inde ad B. similiter durum ascenditur: Vtriusque porro
ratio eadem reddi potest, ut Relatio non harmonica evitetur auribus plane
ingrata, quae tum perpetratur, cum quatuor Notae gradatim ascendentes, aut
descendentes, terminos perfectae Quartae excedunt. Nam licet Quarta minor
passim in usu sit, attamen si Nota altera ab altera remotius divaricetur,
enascitur Tritonus harmoniae infestus; quod ne siat, a priore ad posteriorem
sternenda et emollienda est via: atque hic tria Quartarum genera observari
possunt: Tritonus, Diatessaron, and Quarta minor, cum nimirum superior Nota
mollis, inferior dura est.

De Fusis per saltus incedentibus id dicendum restat, videri istiusmodi
constructionem ad Basin Minuritionum minus idoneam. Si tamen occurrant, eadem
regula hic inservire poterit, quae de Semiminimis tradita est, conversis

Ejusmodi amplificatio cujuscumque Schematis, Inventioni non leve affert
subsidium, eamque omni anxietate liberat, dum nihil admodum elaborandum venit,
nisi ut prima Schematis ratio ad totam Basin consimili Syntaxi applicetur. Hinc
praeterea oritur Minuritionum analoga compositio, jucunda admodum, modo ne
eadem sigura nimia inculcatione fastidium creet, cui facile medebitur

Minuritionum Syntaxis.
PRincipio Fundamentum ipsum simplici ac liquida modulatione percurre: idque 1o
Vt Minuritionum Substratum ab Auditoribus clarius atque distinctius
percipiatur. 2o Vt Basin tu ipse ejusque genium melius comprehendas. 3o Vt, qui
tibi fundamentum accinit, probe intelligat, quo Mensurae temperamento uti velis.

Deinde Basin in varias Minutias Semiminimarum atque Fusarum dispesce, aut
aliquot fiosculos Melotheticos lentioris mensurae adsperge; idemque in Secunda
and tertia Stropha, si forte totidem Basis contineat, fieri poterit.

Tum vero Minuritiones celeriores earumque varia Schemata atque
amplificationes, ut supra ostendimus, adhibe.

Vbi hoc genere lusus dexteritatem auditoribus probaveris, ad Melothetica
ornamenta subtiliora Syncopasque transire licebit, nunc intensiori, nunc
remissiori manu, ut studiosius abblandiaris auribus, attentionemque concilies.

Demum varios Minuritionum saltus atque tripudia, cum multiplici Triplarum
genere, in medium produces; laxando Inventionis habenas, animoque, qua vocat
liberius, indulgendo; varietati inprimis atque aptae figurarum collocationi
studens, quo nova identidem attentione Auditorem allectes perque multiplices
assectionum motus, Musicae imperio rapias.

De Basi Continua,
QVod si Basis non per Strophas, sed perpeluo cursu ad exitum procedat (ut cum
pro fundamento Bassus Continuus alicujus Motecti aut Madrigalis assumitur)
principio sedato ac mera Basi inchoandum erit, ut Organoedus mensurae qua velis
uti, tenorem assequatur. Post aliquot vero Semibreves, ad Minuritiones quas
animus suggesserit, digredi poteris; donec ad clausulam perveneris, quae Manui
exerendae campum aperiat. Pausis aliquot subinde interpositis, concede
Organoedo nonnihil spatii quo te praecedat, ut illum deinde lepida aemulatione
consequaris. Varias demum Melothesias, Minuritiones Mixti generis, Triplas ac
caetera Inventionis Myrothecia essunde.

Minuritiones singulari Chely qua ratione aptandae.
PRaeter ea quae jam diximus, id curandum maxim in concinnandis
Minuritionibus, ut Symmetriae facilitatique consulas. Nam ex duabus Melothesiis
aeque praestantibus, ea meretur Palmam, quae faciliori negotio ac leviori manu
percurri potest: satisque liquet, eum qui Canonis indolem digitorumque
applicationem nesciat, vix esse ad Minuritionum compositionem idoneum artisicem.

Adhibenda porro sunt ad exemplum, aliorum opera, quorum industria in
excogitandis Minuritionibus cum laud desudavit. Quos inter, D. Henrici Butler,
and D. Danielis Norcome elucubrationes, aliorumque Nostratium, quibus pulsandae
Chelyos praerogativa facile conceditur, praecellentium Musicorum, nunquam sine
acroamate usurpari poterunt.

Qua Methodo duae Cheles Basi alludere debent.
HAec hactenus de Chely Simplici; nunc agendum de duplici. Cum duobus simul
Musurgis ad eandem Basin componendae atque accinendae erunt Minuritiones, hae
serventur regulae.

Primo Fundamentum in triplici charta describatur, quarum prima Organoedo qui
litera A. designari poterit, secunda ei qui primam pulsat Chelyn literaque B.
notabitur, tertia illi qui secunda canit Chely, insignieturque C. seorsim
tradendae sunt.

Exordiantur A. and B. Basinque simplici modulatione percurrant, interea dum C.
graviorem aliquam Melothesiam Basi apponit. Dumque B. eandem cum aliqua
variatione Melothesiam redintegrat, C. soli Basi immoretur. Atque eadem
methodus sive duae sint Fundamenti Strophae sive unica, observetur; altero
Basin, altero Melothesiam modulante.

Secundo, C. in procursum Minuritionum celeriorem exsiliat, cum B. simile quid,
sublimiori tamen stylo reponat. Id ut felicius eveniat, auspicetur Lusum is qui
Inventione pollet, sequatur qui manu expeditiori praecellit, ut assurgat potius
quam flaccescat Musica.

Tertio, post iteratam Chelyum altercationem, A. si dextra valet, signo dato,
suam quoque Minuritionum Symbolam in medium proferat; atque interea Chelys
altera Basin, altera Melothesiam graviorem moduletur. Tum denique Chelys
utraque seorsim, Organoedi Minuritiones haud impari artificio aemuletur.

Quarto, partiri inter se poterunt Stropham aliquam Fundamenti propositi; ita
ut B. simpliciter Basin frangat, nec nisi ad Octavam sursum aut deorsum
excurrat, sive in eadem Nota consistat, sive ad sequentem transitum paret. Quod
cum Musurgo C. consiiterit, eandem orbitam facile evitabit, seque ad Tertias,
aut Quintas, aut sicubi id Basis requiret, ad Sextas, subducet, Basique in
Vnisono aut Octava ad Notam finalem duntaxat occurret; atque adeo Quintarum and
Octavarum obstrepera collisio etiam in extemporali praxi haud aegre
declinabitur.

Quinto, C. Minuritionem aliquam inchoabit, quae spatium Brevis aut Semibrevis
occupet, iaque, signo dato, Musurgo B. indicabitur, qui eodem temporis spatio
Socii Schema in sequentibus Notis imitabitur; idque ad Strophae exitum alternis
deduci poterit. Similis concertatio ad breviora vel longiora, intervalla,
varietatis ergo, instituatur.

Sexto, Signum dari poterit Organoedo, si callet artem, ut Schema aliquod ipse
quoque hac postrema methodo auspicetur, quod post Brevem, Semibrevem, aut
simile Spatium, utraque Chelys aut separatim aut conjunctim excipiat; servata
hac regula, ut dum conjunctim canitur, altera Notas lentiores adhibeat, dum
altera in Minuritionibus circumvolitat.

Septimo, Chelys utraque, Organoedo ad Basin ablegato, priorem concertationem
celerius aut lentius renovare poterit, ac denique per varias Triplarum
aliarumque proportionum formas, liberius evagari, vel perpetuis vel
intercalatis Strophis: donec tandem junctis ambae viribus, aut quasi
tumultuario congressu, aut si id potius libuerit, temperata suavique clausula
coronidem labori imponant.

Atquae haec extemporaria concertandi ratio inter assuetos invicem sodales,
adeo feliciter aliquando vertit, ut plausum etiam majorem quam studiosius
adornatae Minuritiones reportarit.

Minuritiones plurium Partium Componendi ratio.
IN componendis Minuritionibus pro duobus Bassis, regula praecedens quid
agendum sit satis demonstrat: nimirum jam huic jam isti Parti attributo Choragi
seu Ducis officio, superiorem aut inferiorem provinciam alternis obtinebunt; ac
denique post appositas aemulasque concertationes, in unum ambo foedus atque
amplexum vel junctis Minuritionibus vel suavi Melothesiae textura conspirabunt.

2. Minuritiones pro duabus superioribus Partibus, methodo Melothetica
concinnandae sunt; dumque simul ambae incitatius feruntur, in Tertiis aut
Sextis plerumque invicem respondere gaudent, aliis subinde Concordantiis
interjectis, habita nimirum semper Fundamenti ratione. Caetera, nihil a
superioribus regulis diversum occurrit.

3. Si Basso atque Superiori Minuritiones adaptandae sunt, perpendenda est
utriusque Partis indoles; qua probe perspecta Melotheticas fractiones
Superiori, Fundamentales Diminutiones Basso ut plurimum tribues.

4. Eadem solertia Minuritionibus pro duobus Bassis and Superiore, item pro
duobus Superioribus and Basso utendum est.

5. In Minuritionibus pro tribus Bassis, Superioris, Mediae aut Insimae Partis
Diminutiones euilibet per vices tribuendae sunt. Verum Minuritiones pro tribus
Partibus ad certam Basin vix solent aptari; sed liberiore, per modum Fantasiae,
ut vocant, decursu sine certa lege hinc inde divagantur: Exordio plerumque
severiore, adeoque per modum Fugae incedant, Minuritionum alterna velitatione
in medium conjecta, conglobata subinde concertantium acie; demum quasi pactis
induciis, suavi ac placido plenioris concentus Episodio, dextras Musicamque
jungant.

Subtexi possunt ad levandum fastidium Melismata varia, Allemandae, etc.

Hujus generis Minuritiones variis Partibus accommodas, nos haud sane paucas in
Apollineae Academiae Tyronumque gratiam claboravimus. Plures reperire est inter
eximia D. Joannis Jenkins Opera: de cujus aliorumque nostratium Authorum

The DIVISION-VIOL, OR The Art of Playing ex tempore to a GROUND.
THE FIRST PART.
Of the VIOL it self, with Instructions how to Play upon it.
A VIOL in the hands of an excellent Violist may (no doubt) be reckoned amongst
the best of Musical Instruments. To Play ex tempore to a Ground is the highest
perfection of it: And this is the Subject of our present Discourse. But first
we must treat of some things necessary to that design; as namely, First, a
Viol fitted for that purpose; Next, Hands enabled to Play upon it; And then,
some knowledge in the Concords of Music. With these therefore we will begin,
in assistance to such as are not sufficiently informed therein: And first
concerning the VIOL.

2. What kind of Viol is fittest for Division, and how to be accomodated.
A Viol for Division, should be of something a lesser size than a Consort Bass;
that so the Hand may better command it: more or less short, according to the
reach of his fingers, who is to use it: but the ordinary size, such as may
carry a String of thirty Inches from the Bridge (duly placed) to the Nut. The
Sound should be quick and sprightly, like a Violin; and Viols of that shape
(the Bellyes being dug out of the Plank) do commonly render such a Sound.

It must be accommodated with six Strings; and with seven Frets, like those of
a Lute, but something thicker. If also you fasten a small Fret, at the distance
of an Octave from the open Strings (which is the middle betwixt the Nut and the
Bridge) it will be a good Guide to your Hand, when you stop that part of the
Finger-board.

The Strings a little bigger than those of a Lyra-Viol; which must be laid at
the like nearness to the Finger-board, for ease and convenience of Stopping.

The Bridge, as round as that of a Consort Bass; that so each several String
may be hit with a bolder touch of the Bow.

The Plate, or Finger-board, exactly smooth and even. Its length, full two
parts of three, from the Nut to the Bridge. It must also be of a proportionate
roundness to the Bridge; so, that each String may lie at an equal nearness to
it. As for example: If the Roundness of the Bridge, be as the Arch A. B. then I
would have the low end of the Finger-board to be as C. D. and the top of it, as
E. F.

Viol-makers may take notice hereof.


3. What kind of Bow.
A Viol-Bow for Division, should be stiff, but not heavy. Its length (betwixt
the two places where the Hairs are fastened at each end) about seven and twenty
Inches. The Nut, short. The height of it about a fingers breadth, or little
more.

4. How to hold or place the Viol.
BEing conveniently seated, place your Viol decently betwixt your knees; so,
that the lower end of it may rest upon the calves of your legs. Set the Soles
of your feet flat on the floor, your Toes turned a little outward. Let the top
of your Viol be erected toward your left shoulder; so, as it may rest in that
posture, though you touch it not with your hand.

5. How to hold and move the Bow.
HOld the Bow betwixt the ends of your Thumb and two foremost fingers, near to
the Nut. The Thumb and first finger fastened on the Stalk; and the second
fingers end turned in shorter, against the Hairs thereof; by which you may
poize and keep up the point of the Bow. If the second finger have not strength
enough, you may join the third finger in assistance to it; but in Playing Swift
Divivision, two fingers and the Thumb is best.

Holding the Bow in this posture, stretch out your arm, and draw it first over
one String and then another; crossing them in right angle, at the distance of
two or three Inches from the Bridge. Make each several String yield a full and
clear sound; and order your knees so, that they be no impediment to the motion
of your Bow.



6. The posture of the Left Hand.
WHen you are to set your fingers upon the Strings, you must not grasp the Neck
of your Viol, like a Violin; but rather (as those that Play on the Lute) keep
your Thumb on the back of the Neck, opposite to your forefinger; so as your
Hand may have liberty to remove up and down, as occasion shall require.

7. How the Viol is Tuned, and applied to the Scale of Music.
WE now suppose you to understand Song, and consequently the Scale of Music;
which known, the Tuning of your Viol appears in such order as you see the six
Semibreves which stand one over another, in the first part of the following
Scale: where note, that all the degrees arising above the highest of those
Semibreves, are expressed on the Treble or highest String, by stopping it still
lower and lower toward the Bridge.

^

Your Viol being tuned according to the six Semibreves, your next business is,
to play those other Notes, which you see ascend and descend by degrees, over
which I have set Figures to direct you with what Fingers to stop them; 1, 2, 3,
4, is set for first, second, third, and fourth Finger. Those which have no
figures over them, are played on the open Strings.

8. How the same Notes may be played upon different Strings.
YOU must know that sometimes Notes are played, not on those Strings to which
they seem properly to belong; but for ease or better order of Fingering, are
played upon some other String: An Instance whereof you have in those two Notes
marked with little Stars over their Figures; which Notes, are played upon the
second String; though, a little before, Notes standing in the same places were
played upon the Treble or first String: and therefore, when any difficulty
shall occur in Fingering, you are to consider how the same Notes may be
expressed with most ease and convenience to the Hand.

The Example before-going was set in the whole Scale; that you might better
perceive where every Line and Space take their places upon the Viol: But those
that follow, must be set down in the usual way of five Lines; and when Notes
exceed that Compass they are reduced again into the said five Lines by setting
another Cliff.

This which follows I would have you practice, first in a slow measure;
increasing the quickness by degrees, as your Hand advances in readiness: and
be sure to make all your Notes sound clear and full; pressing the Strings firm
and hard with the very ends of your Fingers. Also give as much Bow to every
Quaver, as the length thereof will permit. But before you set upon it, read the
two Rules which follow it.

^

9. A Rule for Holding on the Fingers.
WHen you set any Finger down, hold it on there; and play the following Notes
with other Fingers, until some occasion require the taking it off. This is done
as well for better order of Fingering, that the Fingers may pass smoothly from
Note to Note, without lifting them too far from the Strings, as also to
continue the Sound of a Note when the Bow has left it. Instances of these
Holds (for so they are called) you have, where you see such a Stroke as this *
drawn from One to some other distant Note unto which you must hold it.

10. A Rule for the Motion of the Bow.
WHen you see an even Number of Quavers or Semiquavers, as 2, 4, 6, 8. You must
begin with your Bow forward; yea, though the Bow were employed forward in the
next Note before them. But if the Number be odd, as 3, 5, 7; (which always
happens by reason of some Prick-Note or odd Rest,) the first of that odd number
must be played with the Bow backward. This is the most proper motion of the
Bow, though not absolutely without some exception: for sometimes the quickness
of the Notes may force the contrary, as you will see in the end of the fifth
Example. Also quick Notes skipping from the Treble to the Bass, and so persued,
are best expressed with contrary Bows. Let your next practice be this which
follows.

^

11. Of ordering the fingers in gradual Notes.
IN any point of Division which reaches to the lower Frets or beyond them; the
highest Note thereof is always stopped either with the third, or with the fourth
finger: If with the third, the first and second fingers take their orderly
places in stopping the two Notes gradually ascending to it, or descending from
it. If the highest Note employ the fourth finger, then the next Note under it
is stopped either with the third or with the second finger, according to the said
under Note being flat or sharp: If sharp, with the third; If flat, with the
second finger. But whether the highest Note employ the third or fourth finger,
the Third below does always employ the first finger, which serves as a Guide
to those two Notes above it. And whereas you will see sometimes two successive
Notes stopped one after the other with the same finger, it is always done either
to prepare the fingers to this posture, or to remove the said posture to some
other place. This Order of Fingering holds good throughout the whole
Finger-board (in stopping three gradual Notes upon one String) with this
difference only, that where the Stops are wide (as amongst the Frets) the
fourth or little finger is of more requisite use than it is lower down where
the Stops are more contract.

As for the posture of the Fingers in moving from one String to another, I must
refer you to your own observation, in making use of what Finger does offer it
self the aptest for stopping any succeeding Note.

^

If you find difficulty in this Example, play it the slower, until your Hand
have overcome it.

I must now propose unto you Notes of a quicker Motion, viz. Demisemiquavers;
but not before I have said something of

12. The Motion of the Right Arm and Wrist.
I Told you before that you must stretch out your Arm straight, in which
posture (playing long Notes) you will necessarily move your shoulder Joint; but
if you stir that Joint in quick Notes, it will cause the whole body to shake;
which (by all means) must be avoided; as also any other indecent Gesture. Quick
Notes therefore must be expressed by moving some Joint nearer the Hand; which
is generally agreed upon to be the Wrist. The question then arising is about
the menage of the Elbow-Joint; concerning which there are two different
opinions. Some will have it kept stiff; Insomuch, that I have heard a judicious
Violist positively affirm, that if a Scholar can but attain to the playing of
Quavers with his Wrist, keeping his Arm straight and stiff in the Elbow-Joint,
he has got the mastery of the Bow-Hand. Others contend that the motion of the
Wrist must be strengthened and assisted by a compliance or yielding of the
Elbow-Joint unto it; and they, to back their Argument, produce for instance a
person famous for the excellency of his Bow-hand, using a free and loose Arm.
To deliver my own opinion; I do much approve the streightness of the Arm,
especially in Beginners, because it is a means to keep the Body upright, which
is a commendable posture. I can also admit the Stiffness of the Elbow, in
Smooth and Swift Division; for which it is most properly apt; But Cross and
Skipping Division cannot (I think) be so well expressed without some consent or
yiedling of the Elbow-Joint unto the motion of the Wrist. To gain this Motion
of the Wrist, the ordinary direction is, to draw the Hand (in moving the Bow to
and fro) a little after the Arm. Or you may try how you can play the first
Example of Quavers by moving your Wrist only, keeping your Arm straight in the
Elbow-Joint; a little practice will effect it. This Motion or looseness of the
Wrist we mention, is chiefly in Demisemiquavers; for, in Quavers, and
Semiquavers too, we must allow so much stiffness to the Wrist as may command
the Bow on, and off the String, at every Note, if occasion so require.

I will set your next Example in C fa ut, with the lowest String put down a
Note, as we commonly do when we play in that Key. And, as I have formerly
admonished you to practice your Examples first flow and then faster by degrees,
that admonition is most requisite in Swift Division, where also you must be
careful that the Motion of your Bow and Fingers do equally answer each other,
bearing your Bow moderately stiff upon the Strings, at a convenient distance
from the point thereof; by which means you shall make your swiftest Notes more
distinguishable: A thing in which many fail, either through want of a due
compliance of the Bow to the Strings, or not exactly crossing them at a right
distance from the Bridge, or else by playing too near the point of the Bow;
which errors I note, that you may avoid them.

^

The little piece at the end of this Example, is set as an exception to what
was said ( page 5.) of Beginning each eaven number with a Forward Bow; for here
you must play them (as necessity will enforce you by reason of their quickness)
some forward, and some backward.

13. How to order the Bow in double Stops.
WHen two, three, or more Notes stand one over another (as you have in two
places of the last Example) they must be played as One, by sliding the Bow over
those Strings which express the sound of the said Notes. When one of them comes
by it self, it is commonly played with a forward Bow; but if diverse of them
follow successively (as in the passages hereto annexed) then each other must of
necessity by played by drawing the Bow back; but whether back or forward, be
sure to hit the lowest String first (insisting thereon so long as need
requires) and let the Bow slide from It to the highest, touching in its passage
those in the middle betwixt them.

^

The figures for more convenience, are here set before the Notes. Where you see
this figure (1) set before two or three Notes in the same Stop; it signifies
that the first finger must be laid over all the said Notes: in which, and in
all double Stops, the posture of the left hand is the same as if you played
upon a Thiorba. One Example more, and we have done.

^

When you have practiced these Examples according to the Instructions given,
you may then, for variety, look upon some of those Divisions at the end of this
Book; amongst which some are easy, made purposely for Learners; Others require
the hands of a good Proficient. And because in those (as also in other men's
Divisons) you will meet sometimes with Tripla's of diverse sorts, I will speak
something of them in this place.

14. Of Tripla's.
SOmetimes the Grounds themselves are Tripla-time, consisting (usually) of
three Semibreves, or three Minims, or three Crotchets to a Measure. Sometimes
you may meet with a Tripla upon a Tripla; as for instance, when upon a Ground
consisting of three Minims to a Measure, each Minim is divided into three
Crotchets, six Quavers, or the like. Again, in Divisions upon Grounds of the
Common-Time, you will meet now and then with diverse Tripla's, as sometimes
three Crotchets to a Minim, producing six Quavers, twelve Semiquavers, etc.
Sometimes three Quavers to a Crotchet, and sometimes three Semiquavers to a
Quaver; the Measure of all which, will not be hard to find out, where the
quantity of each Semibreve is marked out with Strokes or Bars.

It now remains, that in directing the Hand I speak something concerning the
Gracing of Notes: and though it depend much upon Humor and Imitation, yet I
will try how far it may be delivered in words and Examples.

15. Concerning the Gracing of Notes.
GRacing of Notes is performed two ways, viz. by the Bow, and by the Fingers.
By the Bow, as when we play Loud or Soft, according to our fancy, or the humor
of the Music. Again, this Loud or Soft is sometime expressed in one and the
same Note, as when we make it Soft at the beginning, and then (as it were)
swell or grow louder toward the middle or ending. Some also affect a Shake or
Tremble with the Bow, like the Shaking-Stop of an Organ, but the frequent use
thereof is not (in my opinion) much commendable. To these may be added that of
Playing two, three, four, or more Notes with one motion of the Bow, which would
not have that Grace or Ornament if they were played severally.

Graces performed with the Fingers are of two sorts, viz. Smooth and Shaked.
Smooth is, when in rising or falling a Tone or Semitone, we draw (as it were)
the Sound from one Note to another, in imitation of the Voice; and is expressed
by setting down or taking off the Finger a little after the touch of the Bow.
In ascending it makes that Grace which we call a Plain-Beat, or Rise; in
descending, that called a Back-fall.

Sometimes a Note is Graced by sliding up to it from a Third below, called an
Elevation, now something obsolete. Sometimes from the Third above, which we
call a Double Back-fall. This Sliding a Third, is performed commonly upon one
String.

Again, a Note is sometimes Graced by joining part of its Sound to the Note
following, like a Prick-crotchet whose following Quaver is placed with the
ensuing Note, but played with the same Bow of his Prick-crochet; This we have
called a Cadent.

There is yet another Plain or Smooth Grace called an Acute or Springer, which
concludes the Sound of a Note more acute, by clapping down another Finger just
at the expiring of it.

16. Shaked Graces.
SHaked Graces we call those that are performed by a Shake or Tremble of a
Finger, of which there are two sorts, viz. Close and Open: Close-shake is that
when we shake the Finger as close and near the sounding Note as possible may
be, touching the String with the Shaking finger so softly and nicely that it
make no variation of Tone. This may be used where no other Grace is concerned.
Open-shake, is when a finger is shaked in that distance from whence it was
removed, or where it is to be set down; supposing the distance exceed not the
wideness of two Frets, for wider than that we never shake. Graces made with
Open-shakes are these; a Beat, a Back-fall, an Elevation, a Cadent, and a
Double Relish. The Beat is the same in nature with the plain Beat, the
difference only a short shake of the finger before we fix it on the place
designed. This, as also the plain Beat, is commonly made from the Half Note, or
distance of one Fret. The shaked Back-fall is also the same in nature with the
plain, the difference only a shake of the finger taken off, which must be done
in the same wideness as it stood. How an Elevation, Cadent, Double Relish,
etc. employ the Open-shake, will better appear in their Examples which follow;
in which (exp.) stands for Explication. The Notes which have an Arch or Stroke
over or under them, are played with one motion of the Bow.

Smooth Graces. A Beat. Back-fall. Elevation. Double Back-fall. Cadent.

Cadent. exp: Backfall Shaked exp: ^Close Shake. exp: Shaked Beat. exp:

obliged to the ever famous Charles Colman Doctor in Music

To these may be added the Gruppo, Trillo, or any other Movement of the Voice
imitated on the Viol, by playing the like-moving Notes with one motion of the
Bow.

Of these forementioned Graces, some are more rough and Masculine, as your
Shaked Beats and Back-falls, and therefore more peculiar to the Bass; Others,
more smooth and Feminine, as your Close-shake and plain Graces, which are more
natural to the Treble, or upper parts. Yet when we would express Life, Courage,
or Cheerfulness upon the Treble, we do frequently use both Shaked Beats and
Back-falls, as on the contrary, smooth and swelling Notes when we would express
Love, Sorrow, Compassion, or the like; and this, not only on the Treble, but
sometimes also upon the Bass. And all these are concerned in our Division-Viol,
as employing the whole Compass of the Scale, and acting by turns all the Parts
therein contained.

The Hand thus directed, we will now proceed to the Concords of Music.

SECOND PART.
1. Use of the Concords, or a Compendium of Descant.
ALthough our excellent Countryman Mr. Morley, in his Introduction to Music,
does take his sight, and reckon his Concords from the Tenor, as the Holding
Part to which He and the Musicians of former times were accustomed to apply
their Descant, in order to the Gregorian Music of the Church; yet here, for
better reasons (as to our present purpose) I must propose unto you the Bass, as
the Groundwork or Foundation upon which all Musical Composition is to be
erected; and from it we are to reckon or compute all those distances or
Intervalls which we use in joining Parts together.

2. Of Intervalls.
IN reference to Intervalls, we are first to consider an Unison; that is, One
and the same Sound; whether produced by one single voice, or diverse voices
sounding together in the same Tone; and is, in Music, as an Unite in
Arithmetic, or as a Point or Center in Geometry, not divisible. As Sounds
recede more or less from the Unison, so do they make greater or lesser
Intervalls. As namely, first, a Second, divided into Perfect and Imperfect. A
perfect Second is called a Tone, and cannot (as some contend) be exactly split
in two equal halfs, as to proportion of Sound, but is by most Authors
subdivided into Nine lesser Segments or Comma's, two whereof are assigned to a
Diaschisma; four to the lesser, five to the greater Semitone: and the
difference between these two Semitones or imperfect Seconds, they call an
Apotome. Some more curious Observers of these Fractions will needs say, that a
Tone wants somewhat of nine Comma's, and that the greater Semitone does not
altogether reach to five, nor the lesser to four. But these and other like
observations being less requisite to our present purpose, it suffices to have
mentioned them; leaving a further disquisition thereof to such as find leisure
and pleasure to search into these nicer subtilties.

Next follows a Third comprehending the perfect or greater Third by the name of
Ditonus, and the Imperfect or lesser Third by the name of Semeditonus. And here
it is observable, as also elsewhere, that the particle Semi or Seem does not
import the half of the whole, but a deficiency, which makes the Sound fall a
Semitone short of the more complete and perfect Intervall.

A Fourth is divided into the greater by the name of Tritone, which is a
prohibited Intervall, and the lesser by the name of Diatessaron.

A Fifth is divided into Perfect and Imperfect; the former is called Diapente,
the later Semediapente; a false Fifth.

A Sixth is divided into the greater Hexachord consisting of a Tone and
Diapente, and the lesser Hexachord consisting of a Diapente and Hemitone.

A Seventh is divided into the greater consisting of a Ditonus and Diapente,
and the lesser consisting of a Diapente and Semeditonus.

An Octave is divided into Perfect, called Diapason, and Imperfect called
Semediapason.

From these Intervalls arise those Distances which we call Concords and
Discords, in such manner and order as you see in the following Scheme, where an
Octave is divided into twelve Semitones or Half-notes, such as may be observed
in the Stops of fretted Instruments, or the Keys of an ordinary Hapsecord or
Organ; where (by reason no more subdivisions than twelve are exhibited) no
difference appears between a Tritone and a Semediapente, (each being a Semitone
less than a perfect Fifth) though in practical Music their appearance be
different, the one like a Fourth, the other like a Fifth, as you shall see
hereafter.



3. Of the Concords.
COncords are these; a Third, a Fifth, a Sixth, an Eight, and their Octaves.
All the rest (with their Octaves) are Discords. A Fourth, as it is an Intervall
betwixt the Fifth and Eight in the two upper parts, may in that sense be called
a Consonant, but Computed with the Bass, it is a Discord.

Again, Concords are of two Sorts; Perfect and Imperfect. Perfect are these, a
Fifth and Eighth. Imperfect, are a Third and Sixth; which two last have yet
another Distinction, to wit, a greater and a lesser Third, as also a greater
and a lesser Sixth.

4. Passage of the Concords.
FIrst, take notice that two Perfects of the same kind, as two Fifths, or two
Eights, rising or falling together, is not allowed in Composition; but if the
Notes stand still in the same place, or if one of the parts remove into the
Octave it is allowed. Or if the parts remove in contrary motion, it may be
allowed in Songs of many parts, as thus,

^ Illicita (...) Illicita (...) Licita (...) Licita (...) Licita in pluribus
partibus ^5 5 (...) 5 5 8 8 8 8 (...) 5 5 5 8 (...) 8 (...) 8 8 8 (...) 5 5 5
^Not allowed Not allowed Allowed Allowed Allowed in many parts

But you may pass from a Fifth to an Eighth, or from an Eighth to a Fifth, when
you please; provided that one of the Parts either keep its place, or remove but
one degree: For if both Parts leap together, the passage is less pleasing.

As for Thirds and Sixths, which are Imperfect Concords, two, three, or more of
them rising or falling together, is no soloecisme in Music.

In fine, you have liberty to pass from any one, to any other different
Concord, provided you avoid Relation inharmonical; that is, a harsh and
unpleasing reflection of Flat against Sharp.

5. Concerning the Key or Tone.
EVery Composition in Music, be it long or short, is (or ought to be) designed
to some one Key or Tone, in which the Bass does always conclude. This Key or
Tone is called Flat or Sharp, according as the Key-note has the lesser or
greater Third next above it. If it be the Lesser Third, it is called a Flat Key;
if the Greater Third, it is a Sharp Key, thus exemplified.

^Flat (...) Sharp (...) Flat (...) Sharp (...) Flat (...) Sharp ^Flat (...)
Sharp (...) Flat (...) Sharp (...) Flat (...) Sharp ^Flat (...) Sharp (...)
Flat (...) Sharp

How strange or difficult soever some Songs may appear by reason of the Flats
or Sharps set at the beginning of them, yet all is but in relation to the
Lesser or Greater Third taking place next above the Key or Tone-Note; being the
very same, in all respects, with the first Instances of the Lesser and Greater
Third above G.

As the Bass is Flat or Sharp, so must the other Parts be set, which are joined
to it.

All these things will best appear in Counterpoint; that is, when we set the
Notes of the higher Parts, Note for Note, just over the Notes of the Bass,
which (to a Beginner) is the easiest way of showing the use of the Concords.
But first I must direct you

6. How to frame a Bass.
IN making a Bass three things must be observed; First, that it be natural to
the Key designed, making its middle Closes (if it have any) in such other Keys
as have dependence upon the said Key; such are the Fifth and Third, if it be a
flat Key; but if it be a sharp, employing the greater Third (which is not so
proper and easy for a middle Close) you may in stead thereof make use of the
Fourth or Second above the final Key, in this manner.

^5 (...) 3 (...) 5 (...) 4 (...) 2

Secondly, let your Bass move for the most part by Leaps of a Third, Fourth, or
Fifth; using degrees no more than to keep it within the proper bounds and Air
of the Key.

Thirdly, I would have you (for more ease) to make choice of a Flat Key to
begin with, and avoid setting of sharp Notes in it for some reasons which will
appear hereafter.

Let this short Bass serve for an Example, which has a middle Close in B the
Flat third to the Key.

7. How to join a Treble to the Bass.
ABass being pricked, you may join a Treble to it by setting like Notes a
Third, Fifth, or Eighth above it. As for Sixths (which properly belong to sharp
Notes) I shall speak of them hereafter. Now, as the proper movement of the Bass
in Counterpoint, is (for the most part) by Leaps, so the natural progression of
the Treble is a rising and falling by degrees: and therefore, when you have set
a Third, Fifth or Eighth over the first Note of the Bass, you may take for your
next, (and so from one to another) that Concord which affords the nearest
Compliance to that movement by degrees, as you see in the Example. If you set a
figure under each Note as you prick it, to signify what Concord it bears to
the Bass, as you here see them, it will be some ease to your Eye and Memory.

Take notice that in few Parts Imperfect Concords are more delightful than
Perfect, as not satiating or cloying the Ear so much as the multiplicity of
Perfects do. Hence it is that in Two parts we seldom use Eights, unless to the
Beginning-Note, Ending-Note, Cadent-Notes, or where the Parts proceed in
contrary motion; that is, one ascending and the other descending.

8. Composition of three Parts.
WHen you are perfect in setting a Treble and Bass, you may add to them a third
Part, as for instance, an Alt, whose proper region is next under the Treble;
and therefore I would have you set it (Note for Note) in those Concords which
are nearest thereto. Provided, that if you intend your Composition for no more
than three Parts, one of the two upper Parts be still a Third to the Bass, for
the reason abovementioned.

I have made the Treble and Alt both of them end in the Eight to the Bass,
which in my opinion is better (the Key being flat) than to have the Treble end
in the sharp Third; that Concord being more proper to some inward Part at a
Conclusion.

Cantus. ^3 5 3 5 3 5 3 5 8 Altus. ^8 3 8 3 8 3 8 3 8 Bassus. ^

Concerning those two Notes which you see made sharp in the Alt, take notice,
that when the Bass ascends a Fourth, or descends a Fifth, it commonly requires
the sharp or greater Third to that Note from which it so rises or falls.

9. Composition of four Parts.
BEing perfect in composing of Three Parts, you may try how you can add to them
a Fourth Part, which now remains to be the Tenor; concerning which, these
things are to be observed. (1.) That it be set (as much as may be) in Concords
different from the other two upper Parts. (2.) That it be set as near as you
can to the Alt; for the Melody is best when the upper Parts are joined close
one to another. (3.) That you avoid the Consecution of two Fifts, or two
Eights, rising or falling together; as well amongst the upper Parts themselves,
as betwixt any one Part and the Bass.

All which is at once performed by taking the next Concord, Note for Note,
which you find under the Alt. As appears by the following Example.

Cantus. ^3 5 3 5 3 5 5 3 5 8 Altus. ^8 3 8 3 8 3 3 8 3 8 Tenor. ^5 8 5 8 5 8 8
5 8 3 Bassus. ^

I have broken the last Note but one of the Alt, into two Crochets, and joined
one of them to the Note before it, making it, by that means, a Binding-Cadence;
which you may imitate upon the like Notes, in that Part always which bears the
sharp or greater Third to the Bass in the next Note before any Close.

Though for ease and order's sake I showed you first how to join one part to
your Bass, then two, and lastly three, by setting and adding one part after
another; yet now it is left to your liberty to carry on all your upper parts
(so many as you design) together, disposing them into such Concords as you
think most Convenient: Provided that one of the parts be still a Third to the
Bass, which in Composition of three or more parts, should never be omitted.

10. Concerning a Sixth.
IF your Bass have sharp Notes in it (such are commonly the Half Note under the
Key or Tone, the greater Third above it, and sometimes also the lesser Third
under it:) Notes standing in these places do commonly require a Sixth to be
joined to them, as you see in this Example.

Here you have three Notes in the Bass, which require the lesser Sixth to be
joined to them; The First in E. (the lesser Third under the Key) whose Sixth is
in the Treble. The Second in F Sharp (the half Note under the Key) whose Sixth
is in the Tenor. The Third in B. Sharp (the greater Third above the Key) whose
Sixth is in the Alt. Concerning which some things are to be Noted.

First, That when the Sixth is used, the Fifth must be left out; for a Fifth and
Sixth must not sound together in Counterpoint. Secondly, That the Half-Note
under the Key, does hardly admit an Eight to be joined to it, without offense
to a Critical Ear; and therefore have I put two parts in the same Third, as you
see in the first Bar, rather than have any part to sound in the Eighth to that
Sharp Note in F. Thirdly, That Basses, consisting much of Notes requiring a
Sixth, are more apt for few than for many Parts. Fourthly, That the Bass, in
such kind of Notes, does want a Third of its full Latitude or Compass; as is
evident in this, that if you do but remove the said Sharp Notes a Third lower,
those Sixths are changed in Eights, the Thirds into Fifts, and the Sharp
prohibited Eight into a Third, as in the Example following. And thus you see
where Sixths are used, and how they may be avoided when you desire it.

From hence it appears, that seeing a Fifth and Sixth are never used together
in Counterpoint, it consequently follows that there can be but three several
Concords (which are a Third, a Fifth or Sixth, and an Eighth) joined at once to
any one Note of the Bass. And therefore if you have a mind to compose more
parts than four, (as five, six, seven, or eight parts) it must be done by
redoubling those Concords in their Octaves, and making the parts pass into
different changes to avoid the Consecution of Fifts and Eights, which duly
observed, your Composition (no doubt) will be Harmonions.

Cantus. ^3 8 5 3 3 5 8 3 5 3 Altus. ^8 5 3 8 8 8 5 8 3 8 Tenor. ^5 3 8 5 5 3 3
5 8 5 Bassus. ^

11. Use of Discords.
DIscords are two ways admitted into Music: First, in Diminution; that is,
when two, three, four, or more Notes of one Part, are set against one Note of a
different Part: In which position a Discord is allowed to any Note of the
Diminution, except the Leading Note, which should always be a Concord. Example

^5 4 (...) 6 7 8 7 (...) 8 7 6 5 (...) 3 4 5 6 ^3 4 (...) 5 4 5 6

Here observe, that two, three, four, or more Notes standing together in the
same Rule or Space, may be considered as one entire Note; and may admit the
application of a Discord to any of them, the first, only excepted. Example.

^7 6 (...) 5 4 3 2 3 8 7 5 ^8 2 3 4 5 6

The other way in which Discords are not only allowed, but of most excellent
use, is in Syncopation or Binding; that is, when a Note of One Part ends and
breaks off upon the Middle of the Note of an other Part, as you see in the
following Examples.

Syncopation in two Parts.

^876 6543 4676 8 3 4 3 4343 238 323 2323 2346438 ^5676 7676 76765 4 38 343
43238 8 76 53656 765 4 38 ^

Syncopation in three Parts.

^5 6 7 6 85 6 7 65 7 6 8 3 65 3 65 3 65 4 3 8 5656 5656 7 6 5 8 ^323 3 3 3 4 3
3 3 3 3 843 843 843 8 3 3 3 3 434 3 4 3 8

In this way of Binding, a Discord may be applied to the first part of any Note
of the Bass, if the other part of the Binding Note did sound in Concord to that
Note which went before.

Discords thus admitted, we are next to consider how they are brought off, to
render them delightful to the Ear; for simply of themselves they are harsh and
displeasing, and introduced into Music for variety; or, by striking the sense
with a disproportionate Sound, to beget attention to that which follows; to the
hearing of which, the Ear is carried on (as it were) by a necessary expectation.

This winding or bringing a discord off, is best effected by changing from
thence into some imperfect Concord, to which more sweetness is added by the
Discord going before. Yet here the Ear is not fully satisfied until these
Discords and Imperfect Concords arrive at One more perfect, where (as at a
period) we understand the sense of that which went before. Now, in passing from
Discords to Imperfects; or from Imperfects to Perfects, the Rule should be
this; that we deflect to that which is nearest rather than to one more remote:
Hence it is that the greater Sixth is observed (by Des Carts) to pass more
naturally into an Eighth, and the lesser Sixth into a Fifth. This little
remove, by a Tone or Semitone, connects and makes smooth the Air of the Music
in passing from Concord to Concord; which, by a greater remove, would rather
seem disjointed.

12. Of the excessive Fourth, and Defective Fifth.
ALthough an Excessive Fourth and Defective Fifth be Discords, yet are they of
most excellent use in all Figurate Music, and are sometimes set without
Syncope or Binding, which (according to the Rules of Composition) is not
allowed to other Discords. Either of them consists of six Semitones, which
seems the same, as to proportion of Sound; But here we must consider them as
they are represented to the Eye, like a Fourth and a Fifth, which (if you place
one above the other) complete the Compass of an Octave, thus.

^ Semidiapente Tritone Tritonus. Semidiapente.

A Tritone naturally passes into a Sixth, a Semidiapente into a Third.

Example.

^ Tritonus. (...) Semidiapente.

A defective Fifth does naturally require a Sixth to be joined with it, as you
see it set in the Example; which perhaps may seem a contradiction to what I
said ( page 19.) that a Fifth and Sixth must not sound together; that is, as
Concords set Note against Note without binding: But this Fifth stands as a
Discord, and is backed with a Sixth to mollify its harshness: For (as I have
formerly said) there can be but Three Concords joined at once to the Bass,
which are always (except when a Sixth takes place) a Third, Fifth, and Eight.
And therefore if a Hundred or Hundred Thousand Voices were joined together in
Musical Concordance, they must all sound in these Three Concords or in their
Octaves, which is still but the same species.

13. Reflections upon the Concords of Music.
ANd here I cannot but wonder, even to amazement, that from no more than Three
Concords, (with some intervening Discords) there should arise such an infinite
variety, as all the Music that ever has been or ever shall be composed. And my
wonder is increased by a consideration of the Seven Gradual Sounds or Tones,
from whose various positions and Intermixtures those Concords and Discords do
arise. These Gradual Sounds are distinguished in the Scale of Music by the
same seven Letters which in the Calendar distinguish the seven days of the
Week; to either of which, the adding of more is but a repetition of the former
over again.

This Mysterious number of seven, leads me into a contemplation of the
Universe, whose Creation is delivered unto our Capacity (not without some
mystery) as begun and finished in seven days, which is thought to be figured
long since by Orpheus his seven stringed Lyre. Within the Circumference of this
great Universe, be seven Globes or Spherical Bodies in continual Motion,
producing still new and various figures, according to their diverse positions
one to another. When with these I compare my seven Gradual Sounds, I cannot but
admire the Resemblance of their Harmonies, the Concords of the one so exactly
answering to the Aspects of the other; as an Unison to a Conjunction, an Octave
to an Opposition; the middle Consonants in a Diapason, to the middle Aspects in
an Orb; as a Third, Fifth, Sixth, in Music, to a Trine, Quartile, Sextile in
the Zodiac. And as these by moving into such and such Aspects transmit their
Influences into Elementary Bodies; So those, by passing into such and such
Concords, transmit into the Ear an Influence of Sound, which does not only
strike the sense, but even assect the very soul, stirring it up to a devout
Contemplation of that Divine PRINCIPLE from whence all Harmony proceeds; and
therefore very fitly applied to sing and sound forth his Glory and Praise.

When I further consider that Three Sounds placed by the Interval of a Third
one above another, do constitute one entire Harmony, which governs and
comprises all the Sounds which by Art or Imagination can, at once, be joined
together in Musical Concordance; This I cannot but think a significant Emblem
of that Supreme and incomprehensible THREE in ONE, Governing, Comprising and
Disposing the whole Machine of the world with all its included parts, in a most
perfect and stupeadious Harmony.

I insist not upon things of common observation, as that a String being struck,
the like String of another Instrument (tuned in Concordance to it) should also
sound and move; or that the Sound of a Sackbot, Trumpet, or like extended Tube,
should, by a Stronger emission of the Breath, skip from Concord to Concord
before you can force it into any gradation of Tones, etc. What I have already
mentioned is enough to persuade me that there is a greater mystery in the
Harmony of Sounds, than what has been yet discovered.

14. The Analogy of Musical Concords to the Aspects of the Planets, illustrated
in the following Scheme.
WHere you have the seven Gradual Sounds in their orderly progression
represented on the Diameter-line. Upon which, is also described a Diapason with
its included Consonants, according to the Arithmetical division thereof, as
experimentally found upon a Monochord, or the String of any fretted Instrument,
from the Nut to the middle thereof. The outmost Circle represents the Zodiac,
and the Aspects of the Planets, to which you see the Diapason with its
Intersections exactly agreeing; as viz. The two Terms thereof, to a Conjunction
and Opposition; The middle Section (which generates a Fifth on one side, and a
Fourth on the other) to a. A Third and a Sixth completing also the Compass of
an Octave, as a and * do a Semicircle or the two opposite points of an Orb. To
which may be added, that a Diapason is divided into Twelve Semitones, as the
Zodiac into Twelve Signs or Sections.

The other Figure shows, that all the Sounds that can possibly be joined
together in Musical Concordance, are still but the reiterated Harmony of Three.

The DIVISION-VIOL, OR The Art of Playing ex tempore to a GROUND. THIRD PART.
1. Of Division, and the manner of performing it.
DIminution or Division to a Ground, is the Breaking, either of the Bass, or of
any higher Part that is applyable thereto. The manner of expressing it is thus:

A Ground, Subject, or Bass, (call it which you please) is pricked down in two
several Papers: One for him who is to play the Ground upon an Organ,
Harpsechord, or what other Instrument may be apt for that purpose; the Other,
for him that plays upon the Viol, who, having the said Ground before his eyes,
as his Theme or Subject, plays such variety of Descant or Division in
Concordance thereto, as his skill and present invention do then suggest unto
him. In this manner of Play, which is the perfection of the Viol, or any other
Instrument, if it be exactly performed, a man may show the Excellency both of
his Hand and Invention, to the delight and admiration of those that hear him.

But this you will say is a perfection that few attain unto, depending much
upon the quickness of Invention as well as quickness of Hand. I answer, it is a
perfection which some excellent Hands have not attained unto, as wanting those
helps which should lead them to it; the supply of which want is the business we
here endeavor. True it is, that Invention is a gift of Nature, but much
improved by Exercise and Practice. He that has it not in so high a measure as
to play ex tempore to a Ground, may, notwithstanding give both himself and
hearers sufficient satisfaction in playing such Divisions as himself or others
have made for that purpose; in the performance whereof he may deserve the Name
of an excellent Artist; for here the excellency of the Hand may be showed as
well as in the Other, and the Music perhaps better, though less to be admired,
as being more studied. But to our matter in hand:

2. Several kinds of Division.
IN Playing to a Ground we exercise the whole Compass of the Viol, acting
therein sometimes the Part of a Bass, sometimes a Treble or some other Part.
From hence proceed Two kinds of Division, viz. a Breaking of the Ground, and a
Descanting upon it: Out of which two, is generated a Third sort of Division; to
wit a Mixture of Those, one with the other; which Third or last sort, is
expressed in a two fold Manner; that is, either in Single or in Double Notes.

These several sorts of Division are used upon the Bass-Viol, very
promiscuously, according to the Fancy of the Player or Composer; Howbeit, for
Order and Methods sake, I must discourse of them severally; and will begin with.

3. Breaking the Ground.
BReaking the Ground is the dividing its Notes into more diminute Notes. As for
instance, a Semibreve may be broken into two Minims, four Crochets, eight
Quavers, sixteen Semiquavers, etc.

This Breaking or Dividing a Note admits diverse ways of expression, according
to the diverse ordering and disposing the Minute parts thereof.

First, Five ways of Breaking a Note.
when there is no variation of Sound, by reason of the Minutes standing still
in the same place, or removing into the Octave, which I account it but the same
Tone.

Example.

^

Secondly, when the Sound is varyed, and yet the Air retained, either by a
quick return, or by keeping near to the place of the Note divided: thus:

Example.

^

Thirdly, when the Minute Notes are employed in making a Transition to the next
Note of the Ground; as you see in the following Examples, where Notes are
broken to all the several distances in an Octave, both ascending and descending.

Example.

^3 4 5 6 7 8 Ascending. ^ Descending ^2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Ascending. ^ Descending ^2
3 4 5 6 Ascending. ^ Descending. ^7 8 2 3 4 ^5 6 7 8 ^ Ascending ^ Descending

I have set some part of the Example in a higher Cliff, because this Breaking a
Note by way of Transition, holds good in higher Parts as well as in the Bass.

Fourthly, when the Minutes are employed in skipping into other Concords, as
you see in breaking these four Semibreves.

Example.

^853 (...) 468 (...) 85635 (...) 853468 (...) 853

Fifthly, when the said Minutes make a Gradual Transition into some of the
Concords, passing from thence, either to end in the Sound of the Holding-Note,
Standing-Note, Ground-Note, and Note divided, are the same.
Holding Note, or else, moving on, to meet the next Note of the Ground. And
though this moving into the Concords, be the very same as Descant, so long as
it continues in that Motion; yet in regard of its returning either to its own
Note, or to meet the next following Note in nature of a Bass, we must here rank
it under the name and notion of Breaking the Ground. The manner of it you may
see in these following Instances.

^ These pass up to the 3.d These to the 5.th These to the 8.th These to a 3.d
higher These to a 5.th higher. ^ These to a 3.d These to a 5.th These to an
8.th These to a 3.d higher ^2 These pass to the 4.th below These to a 6.th
below These to the 8.th below These into Concords both above and below.

The chief Mystery of Division to a Ground may be referred to these three
Heads. How Division is made harmonious to the Holding-Note of the Ground.
First, That it be harmonious to the holding Note. Secondly, That it come off
so, as to meet the next Note of the Ground in a smooth and natural passage.
Thirdly, Or if it pass into Discords, that they be such as are aptly used in
Composition.

^ As thus. Exemp: Gratia. ^ This passes into a 4.th This into a 7.th

How Division is made harmonious to the Holding-Note, was showed in the Fifth
way of breaking a Note. And the Bringing it off to meet the next Note of the
Ground, How Division is brought off to Meet the next Note of the Ground.
is much after the same way, viz. by making the last three, or more of the
Minute Notes (at least two of them) ascend or descend by degrees, unto the next
succeeding Note, as you see here following where the Semibreve in G. is broken
to all the distances in an Octave.

^ As thus (...) or thus (...) Thus (...) or thus (...) Thus (...) or thus ^
Thus (...) or thus etc: ^

This holds good, be the Division quicker or slower; Only that in quick
Division more of the minutes will offer themselves in making this Gradual
transition to the succeeding Note, as you see in the Semiquavers of the
precedent Instances.

By this which has been showed, you see (I suppose) what belongs to Breaking a
Note: but this requires not only a Notion but a Habit also, which must be got
by practice. Wherefore I would have you prick down some easy Ground; and break
each Note making a Transition still from Note to Note, according to what has
been delivered. To the better effecting whereof, I will set you an Example,
with which take these Advertisements.

First, That your Division be carried on smoothly, as we have formerly
admonished; and that your Flats and Sharps have still relation to the Key and
Air of your Ground.

Secondly, you are to consider that a Seventh or Sixth falling, is the same as
a Second or Third rising, and so you may consider all other distances, with
their opposite Octaves.

Example.

^2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 ^7 6 5 4 3 2 8

And therefore you may choose whether you will meet, any succeeding Note of the
Ground, in the Unison, or in its Octave, above or below it; for, concerning
Octaves the reason is still the same.

Thirdly, in such places as the Ground does intimate a Cadence, by falling a
Fifth or rising a Fourth; all the Notes that hit upon the Third above, or Sixth
below, must be played Sharp. See Page 18.

Lastly, How Division is to Move below the Ground-Note.
as your Division passes into the Third and Fifth, whilst it moves above (by
which it is made harmonious to the to the Ground-Note) so, in moving beneath,
it must pass into the under Octaves of those Concords, viz. into the Sixth and
Fourth below the Ground-Note. Thus

^535 (...) 535 (...) 535 ^464 (...) 464 (...) 464

These things being known, you may break your Ground in such manner as follows;
where you have the Division placed over the Ground, that you may better observe
the breaking of each Note.

An Example of Breaking the Ground

^

Here you see every Note of the Ground broken, according to some One or Other
of those five ways beforementioned; only I have made the Division, in one
place, to meet the Ground-Note in the Third; and in another place in the Fifth:
both which are marked out unto you for your imitation, when the Point, or any
other convenience shall invite you thereunto.

Here a doubt may arise, concerning the Seventh above and Second below the
Divided-Note; which, in the Division, is sometimes made Sharp, and suddenly
Flat again, according to its own nature: in which doubts the Ear must always be
chief Umpire. Howbeit, in this particular, something (I think) may be delivered
by way of Rule; which is, that if we descend to a Second, and immediately
ascend again, that Second must be made Sharp: The same is understood of the
Seventh above, in reference to the Eighth, as you may see in breaking the two
Semibreves in D.

Example.

^

Here your Ear will tell you that the Note in C requires a Sharp: but in the
second Instance where the next Note does not so ascend, no Sharp is required.

From this Rule we must except, that if the Ground do suddenly rise or fall to
a Flat Second; or fall a Third, or make a Cadence: In these Cases no Sharp is
required, though the Note rise again, as you may see in these Instances.

Example.

^

Another observation is; that at a Close I would always have the Division to
end in the Sound of the Note next before the Close, and from thence leap off
into the Sound of the Final Note, as you see it does in all the Strains of the
last Example. And here I cannot but take notice of an error which I have
observed in some reputed excellent Violists; who in playing a Consort-Bass,
would sometimes at the very Close, run down by degrees to the Concluding-Note;
than which nothing is more improper: for, if any upper Part do fall from a
Fifth to an Eighth (a thing most frequent) the Bass, by such a Running down by
degrees, does make two prohibited Eights to the said Part.

Example.

^ Not allowed. (...) Not allowed. (...) Allowed. (...) Allowed. ^5 8 (...) 88
(...) 88 ^ Illicita. (...) Illicita. (...) Licita. (...) Licita.

Though this Running down by degrees, be worse in playing a Consort-Bass, than
in Division to a Ground; yet in This also it does not want its bad consequence;
the Organist commonly joining such Parts to his Ground, as the Composer does
unto his Bass.

4. Descant Division.
DEscant Division is that which makes a Different-concording-part unto the
Ground. It differs from the Former in These particulars. That breaks the Notes
of the Ground; This Descants upon them. That takes the liberty to wander
sometimes beneath the Ground; This (as in its proper sphere) moves still above
it. That meets every succeeding Note of the Ground, in the Unison or Octave;
This, in any of the Concords. But in the main business of Division, they are
much the same: for all Division, whether Descant or Breaking the Bass, is but a
Transition from Note to Note, or from one Concord to another, either by Degrees
or Leaps, with an Intermixture of such Discords as are allowed in Composition.

The Rules of Descant-Division are the same I gave you in joining another Part
to your Bass; That is, you may begin with a Third, Fifth or Eighth to the
Ground-Note; passing on to meet the next Note also in a Third, Fifth, or
Eighth: provided you avoid the consecution of Perfects of the same kind, as
has been delivered. The manner of Breaking this Descant is the same I gave you
in Breaking a Note, according to those Five Ways mentioned page 28. and left to
your liberty to use This or That, as occasion shall require.

A Discord is never used to the Beginning of the Ground-Note, unless in
Syncope, as has been showed. A Sext is seldom used as the Leading-Note,
unless in Binding, or to such Notes as require a Sext: not only Sharp Notes
requiring the lesser Sext, as was showed page 19. but sometimes also Flat Notes
which require the greater Sixth in stead of the Fifth, as you see in the middle
Bar of the Example following; in which, the black Notes express the full
latitude of the Bass, according to what has been formerly showed.

Example.

^6 (...) 66 (...) 6 (...) 6 (...) 6^

Now, if you do but break this Ground according to the black Notes, you will
find that your Division does (of it self) produce Sixths to those Notes which
stand a Third higher.

Example.

^6 (...) 6 (...) 6

And here you may perceive the reason, why such Notes affect a Sixth and not a
Fifth, because a Fifth would produce a Seventh to those Notes which express the
full latitude of the Bass.

5. Mixed Division.
I Call that Mixed Division which mixeth Descant and Breaking the Ground, one
with the other; under which name I comprehend all Division which presents to
our Ears the Sounds of Two or more Parts moving together: And, this is
expressed either in single Notes, by hitting first upon One String and then
upon an Other; or in double Notes, by touching two or more Strings at once with
the Bow. This, as it is more excellent than the single ways of Breaking the
Ground, or Descanting upon it, so it is more intricate, and requires more of
judgment and skill in Composition; by reason of the Bindings and intermixtures
of Discords, which are as frequent in This as in any other Figurate Music.

I will give you Examples of This and of Descant-Division; not insisting upon
the several distances in an Octave (now less needful) but upon such passages
as offer themselves most remarkable in Grounds; such are Cadences.

6. Cadences of two sorts.
THough Cadences may seem to be many in Number, yet in effect they are but Two;
to wit, a Seventh brought off with a Sixth, after which the Bass falls a Tone
or Semitone; or else, a Fourth brought off with a Third, after which the Bass
commonly falls a Fifth, or rises a Fourth, which is the same thing.

Example.

^76 (...) 76 (...) 43 (...) 43

Your first Example shall be upon the first sort of Cadence, and the Notes
leading to it: in which you have first, the Ground broken; then Descant; and
lastly, Mixed Division, both in single and double Notes; by which you may better
discern how they differ one from another.

Minuritio Ground Broken. Fundamentalis. Simplex. Descant. Melothetica.
Composita. Mixed. Mixta.
^ Example upon the first sort of Cadence. ^ Ground broken ^ Descant ^ Mixed ^
Mixed

In Playing to a Ground we do sometimes for humor or variety hold out One Note
of Descant to two or three Notes of the Ground (such as will bear it) as you
see in the first variation of Descant in this Example, where you may also
behold a Seventh brought off with a Sixth, which passes into its desired
Eighth. In the other Variations of Descant you have the figure [6] set under
those Notes which lead the Division answering to that Note of the Ground which
require a Sixth. Lastly, you may observe, that sometimes part of the Last or
Concluding Note is also divided, which is left to the liberty of the Player or
Composer.

Your next Example is the same Cadence Sharp, that you may perceive how great a
difference of Air there is, betwixt the same Notes Flat and Sharp; as upon
hearing you might easily judge; though the same Diminution were applied to each
of them.

^ Example upon the first sort of Cadence Sharp ^ Ground broken ^ Descant ^
Mixed ^ Mixed

We will now proceed to the other sort of Cadence, which is a Fourth brought
off with a Third; and first upon a Minim. Thus:

Example.

^ Example of the Second Sort of Cadence upon a Minim ^ Ground Broken ^ Descant
^ Mixed ^ Mixed

Where observe, that if the Notes were played twice so slow or long as they are
here set down, the Example would be a Cadence upon a Semibreve. Nevertheless, I
will set your next upon a Semibreve; and, that I may comprise something more
under the same Example, I will place four Minims before it; by which you may
see how to divide Notes descending by degrees.

^ Example of the Second Sort of Cadence upon a Semibreve ^ Ground broken ^
Descant ^ Mixed ^ Mixed

7 Concerning Fifths and Eighths in Division.
IN this last, and also in other Examples, there is one thing which may
scandalize a young Composer, and perhaps give offense to some old Critic, in
prevention whereof I will speak a little in this place. Every Composer knows
that the Consecution of Fifths and Eighths, is not allowed in Music; that is,
between two different Parts. Now when we Play Division to a Ground, it is to be
considered whether or no we Play a different Part from the said Ground. I
answer, in Descant Division we do. But in dividing a Ground, we play but the
same Part with it; in which doing, if we hit upon the Eighth above or below the
Ground-Note (which will produce, sometimes, two or more Eighths together, as
you see in the first variation of the precedent Example) yet this is still to
be accounted as but one and the same Sound with the Bass; and therefore if any
man except against such a Consecution of Eighths, he may as well except against
the Organ, Harpsecord, or Lute, having Octaves joined to their Basses, which
being struck one after another, produce the consequence of so many Eighths
together.

As for Fifths, they cannot occur in Breaking the Ground, because there we meet
every following Note in the Unison or Oclave. If they happen in Descant, there
is no Apology for them, except one of them be a false Fifth; which, though not
allowed by some precise Musicians of former times, yet our more modern Authors,
as well Writers as Composers, do both use it and approve it. For my own part, I
do not only allow the Consecution of Two Fifths, when one of them is Defective,
but (being rightly taken) esteem it amongst the Elegancies of Figurate Music.

Your next Example is a Cadence upon a Breve, with four Minims ascending to it
by degrees.

^ An Example of the Second Sort of Cadence upon a Breve ^ Ground broken ^
Descant ^ Mixed ^ Mixed

8. Concerning Sixths and Thirds in Division.
IN the mixed Division of these Examples, you have in some places many Sixths
taken one after another, in other places many Thirds; concerning which,
observe; that in Notes where we hit two Strings at once with the Bow, Thirds
are more easy for the Hand, and more pleasing to the Ear than many Sixths
together: But, in Mixed Notes where we hit one String after another, Sixths are
esteemed better than Thirds; for, the Leaps of those being greater, a greater
variety is conveyed unto the Ear. Thence it is, that in Skipping-Division we
rather make use of Tenths then simple Thirds, when there follow many of them
one after another. Howbeit, if skipping Thirds be expressed upon two different
Strings they are very delightful in Mixed Division.

Having spoken of Cadences, I must not omit a Close which is made without
either of the forementioned Cadences, and is used for a Conclusion to some
Fancies, Motets, or other grave Music; in which the Bass falls a Fourth or
rises a Fifth, and part of the final Note is commonly taken into the Descant
in this manner.

I will give one Example of dividing upon it, because, if at ^ any time you
play or compose Division to a Through-Bass or continued Ground, you may happily
meet with it. I will also set down a Long, or four Semibreves before the
Concluding Note; because I have known some Beginners apprehend great difficulty
in playing upon Notes standing long in the same place.

Where you see any Note with a Tail both upward and downward (as in the seventh
Line of the next example,) it signifies two Strings sounding in Unison; one
being stopped and the other open.

An Example of a Close without a Cadence

^

I have not distinguished the three sorts of Division in this last Example,
because the Ground-Notes standing so long in the same place, do not admit any
distinction betwixt Breaking the Ground and Descanting upon it. But this which
I have set down may suffice to show you the way of Dividing upon such Notes,
albeit their continuance in the same place were yet much longer.

Although I did set, in the former Examples, the several Ways by themselves,
that you might better observe how they differ one from another; yet in Playing
or Composing Division to a Ground, we may either continue any one Way (perhaps
a whole Strain together) or change from This to That, as frequently as we
please; insomuch, that sometimes part of the same Note is broken in one sort of
Division, and part of it in another, as you see in this Instance; In which the
first part of the Semibreve in D, is divided according to the way of Breaking
the Ground, and the later part of it in the way of Descant.

Example.

^

9. Of Crochets.
HItherto we have treated concerning the Dividing of Minims, Semibreves, or
longer Notes; which duly considered might also serve for Notes that are
shorter: But, that I may, as near as I can, omit nothing which may ease or
assist the young Practicioner, I will give some Examples upon shorter Notes, as
Crochets and Quavers, with such Observations as I think requisite; and first,
of Crochets ascending and descending by degrees.

^ An Example upon Crochets ascending by Degrees ^ The Ground broken ^ Descant
^ Mixed ^ Mixed

Paradigma Semiminimarum gradatim descendentium.

An Example upon Crochets descending by Degrees

^ The Ground broken ^ Descant ^ Mixed ^ Mixed

Having showed you Crochets moving by degrees, I will now let you see them move
by leaps, in a Ground of two Strains.

An Example of Crochets rising and falling by Leaps ^ The Ground ^ The Ground
broken ^ Descant ^ Mixed ^ Mixed

In this foregoing Ground you have all the Intervalls or Distances which are in
an Octave; for, in the first Strain you have Thirds falling and Fourths rising,
which include, as the same thing, Sixths rising and Fifths falling. In the
second Strain you have on the contrary, Thirds rising and Fourths falling,
which is the same with Sixths falling and Fifths rising. And lastly, for
Sevenths you have Them included (by their opposite Octaves) in such Notes as
rise or fall by degrees.

10. Of Quavers.
IF Quavers occur in a Ground upon which you are to Play or Compose Division;
you are, first, to consider, whether they be not the Minute parts of some
longer Note: as for example, when they move by degrees to make a transition to
some other Note, as in such instances as these.

Example.

^

Here they signify no more than the plain Notes which you see in the Bars next
after them; and therefore, if you divide upon such Quavers, as you would do
upon the said plain Notes, only making your Division proceed in a contrary
motion to to the Quavers, the Music may pass for current, especially in
Playing ex tempore to a Ground.

But, in case you desire to divide the Quavers themselves, or to Play Descant
or Mixed Division upon them, I will show you them according to the Method of our
former Examples, by rising and falling by degrees.

An Example upon Quavers Rising and Falling by Degrees

^ The ground (...) The Ground broken ^ The Ground (...) Descant ^ The Ground
(...) Mixed ^ Mixed.

The first variation of this Example, is a little irregular, as to what we have
delivered of meeting each following Note in the Unison or Octave, for here each
other Quaver is met in a Second. But necessity or shortness of Dissonance
renders that excusable in short Notes which would not be Allowed in longer.
For, as Crochets so broken into Quavers are not very commendable, so Minims
broken into Crochets after the same manner would be much worse. But if That
Ascending and Descending by degrees consisted of Prick-Notes, succeeded by
Notes of the next less quan tity; Then, that way of Breaking would be both
regular and commendable; as thus,

^ Ground (...) Broken (...) Ground (...) Broken

11. Of b Flat and Sharp.
IF you ask me why I put a b flat to that Quaver in B; I answer, because the
Division descends from it to F which is flat. Again, in the other part which
ascends, there is a Quaver in F, made sharp; because the Division ascends from
It to B, which is sharp: Both which are grounded upon the same Reason; which
is, that in four Notes ascending or descending by degrees, we seldom exceed
the distance of a perfect Fourth, lest we produce unto the Ear that harshness
which is called Relation not harmonical: for though the lesser Fourth be most
frequent and very agreeable in Musical progression, yet when both Terms are
extended, the Higher being sharp, and the Lower flat, the distance is then a
Tritone, which is more by half a Note than a perfect Fourth; and therefore when
this happens, we commonly alter that which comes first in compliance to, (and
preparing the Ear for) that which is to follow. And here you may observe Three
different Fourths in Practical Music, viz. a Tritone, or excessive Fourth,
Diatessaron or perfect Fourth, and the lesser Fourth we spoke of, which is when
the lower Term is sharp and the higher flat; thus exemplified:

^

As for Quavers moving by leaps, I have little to say, more than that Grounds
ought not to consist of Notes so quick as Quavers in such a movement. But if
such Notes should be proposed, you may serve your self by that Example you had
of Crochets; making them Quavers, and the Quavers upon them Semiquavers. Or, as
you see in this following Example.

Quavers moving by Leaps

^ The Ground broken ^ Descant ^ Mixed (...) Mixed

It now only remains that I give you some little assistance, by taking you (as
it were) by the Hand, and leading you into the easiest way of Playing Ex
tempore to a Ground.

First, you are to make choice of some Ground consisting of Semibreves or
Minims, or a mixture of these two: for such ought Grounds to be, which are
proposed to be Played upon at sight.

Next, you ought to be provided of ten, twelve, or more points of Division (the
more the better) each consisting of a Semibreve or Minim, which you may
accommodate to the first Note or Notes of your Ground.

Being thus prepared, take one of the said Points, and apply it first to One
Note, and then to another, and so through the whole Ground. When you can do
this, take another Point, and do the like with it, and so one after another so
many as you please.

I will here for your ease and encouragement furnish you with a Ground, and
also with some Points; to which you may add infinite more at your pleasure.

Example.

^ The Ground (...) points ^

Let us now take some of these Points and apply them to the precedent Ground,
that you may by Example see how they are to be carried on.

An Example for carrying on a point upon a Ground

^

This driving or carrying on of a Point, does much ease the Invention, which
has no further trouble, so long as the Point is continued, but to place and
apply it to the several Notes of the Ground: Besides, it renders the Division
more uniform and more delightful also; provided you do not cloy the Ear with
too much repetition of the same thing; which is easily avoided by a little
variation, as you see I have done in carrying on some of the foregoing Points,
Also you have liberty to change your Point though in the middle or in any other
part of the Ground: or you may mingle one Point with another, as best shall
please your fancy.

12. Concerning ordering of Division.
WHen you are to Play Division to a Ground, I would have you, in the first
place, to Play over the Ground it self, plainly and distinctly; for these
reasons: 1. That others may hear what Notes you divide upon. 2. That your self
may be better possessed of the Air of the Ground, in case you know it not
before. 3. That he who Plays the Ground unto you may better perceive the
Measure of Time.

The Ground being Played over, you may then break it into Crochets and Quavers;
or Play some neat piece of slow Descant to it, which you please. If your Ground
consist of two or three Strains, you may do by the second or third, as you did
by the first.

This done, and your Ground beginning over again, you may then break it into
Division of a quicker motion, driving on some Point or Points as has been
showed.

When you have prosecuted that manner of Play so long as you think fitting, and
showed some command of Hand; you may then fall off to slower Descant or
Binding-Notes, as you see cause; Playing also sometimes loud or soft, to
express Humor and draw on Attention.

After this you may begin to Play some Skipping Division; or Points, or
Tripla's, or what your present fancy or invention shall prompt you to, changing
still from one variety to another; for variety it is which chiefly pleases:
The best Division in the world, still continued, would become tedious to the
Hearer; and therefore you must so place and dispose your Division, that the
change of it from one kind to another may still beget a new attention: And this
is generally to be observed, whether your Ground consist of one or more
Strains, or be a Continued Ground; of which I must also speak a little.

13. Of a Continued Ground.
A Continued Ground used for Playing or Making Division upon, is (commonly) the
Through-Bass of some Motet or Madrigal, proposed or selected for that purpose.
This, after you have played two or three Semibreves of it plain, to let the
Organist know your measure; you may begin to divide, according to your fancy,
or the former Instructions, until you come near some Cadence or Close, where I
would have you show some Agility of Hand. There, if you please, you may rest a
Minim, two or three, letting him that Plays the Ground go on: and then come in
with some Point: after which you may fall to Descant, Mixed Division, Tripla's,
or what you please. In this manner, Playing sometimes swift Notes, sometimes
slow; changing from This or that sort of Division, as may best produce Variety,
you may carry on the rest of the Ground; and if you have any thing more
excellent than other, reserve it for the Conclusion.

14. Of Composing Division for one Viol to a Ground.
WHen you compose Division to a Ground, endeavor to make it easy for the Hand:
for, of things equally excellent as to Music, That is always to be preferred,
which is more easy to be performed. Hence we may conclude, that no man is sit
to Compose Division to a Ground (how great a Master in Music soever he be)
unless he know the neck of the Instrument, and the Method of Fingering
belonging unto it.

This is all I have to say concerning Division for one Viol; more than that I
would have you peruse the Divisions which other men have made upon Grounds; as
those of Mr. Henry Butler, Mr. Daniel Norcome, and diverse other excellent men
of this our Nation, who (hitherto) have had the pre-eminence for this
particular Instrument; observing and noting in their Divisions, what you find
best worthy to be imitated.

15. Of two Viols Playing together ex tempore to a Ground.
AFter this Discourse of Division for One Viol, I suppose it will not be
unseasonable to speak something of Two Viols Playing together upon a Ground; in
which kind of Music, I have had some experimental knowledge; and therefore will
deliver it in such order and manner as I have known the practice of it;
referring the Improvement thereof to further experience.

First, let the Ground be pricked down in three several Papers; One for him who
Plays upon the Organ or Harpsechord: The other two for them that Play upon the
two Viols: which, for order and brevity, we will distinguish by three Letters;
viz. A. for Organist, B. for the first Bass, and C. for the second.

Each of these having the same Ground before him, they may all three begin
together; A. and B. Playing the Ground, and C. Descanting to it, in slow Notes,
or such as may suit the beginning of the Music: This done, let C. Play the
Ground, and B. Descant to it, as the other had done before, but with some
little variation. If the Ground consist of two Strains, the like may be done in
the second: One Viol still Playing the Ground whilst the other Descants or
Divides upon it.

The Ground thus Played over, C. may begin again, and Play a Strain of quicker
Division; which ended, let B. answer the same with another something like it,
but of a little more lofty Air: for the better performance whereof, if there
be any difference in the Hands or Inventions, I would have the better Invention
lead, but the more able Hand still follow, that the Music may not seem to
flaccess or lessen, but rather increase in the performance.

When the Viols have thus (as it were) Vied and Revied one to the other, A. if
he have ability of Hand, may, upon a sign given him, put in his Strain of
Division; the two Viols Playing one of them the Ground, and the other slow
Descant to it. A. having sinished his Strain, a reply thereto may be made,
first by one Viol, and then by the other.

Having answered one another in that same manner so long as they think sit, the
two Viols may divide a Strain Both together. In which doing, let B. break the
Ground, by moving into the Octave upward or downward, and returning from thence
either to his own Note, or to meet the next Note in the Unison or Octave. By
this means, C. knowing B's motion, he knows also how to avoid running into the
same, and therefore will move into the Third or Fifth, (or Sixth where it is
required) meeting each succeeding Note in some one of the said Concords, until
he come to the Close; where he may (after he has divided the Binding) meet the
Close Note in the Octave; which Directions well observed, two Viols may move in
Extemporary Division a whole Strain together, without any remarkable clashing
in the Consecution of Fifths or Eighths.

When they have proceeded thus far; C. may begin some Point of Division, of the
length of a Breve or Semibreve, naming the said word, that B. may know his
intentions: which ended, let B. answer the same upon the succeeding Note or
Notes to the like quantity of Time; taking it in that manner, one after
another, so long as they please. This done, they may betake themselves to some
other Point of a different length, which will produce a new variety.

This contest in Breves, Semibreves, or Minims being ended, they may give the
Sign to A. if (as I said) he have ability of Hand, that he may begin his
Point, as they had done one to another; which Point may be answered by the
Viols, either singly or jointly; if jointly, it must be done according to the
former Instructions of Dividing together; Playing still slow Notes and soft,
whilst the Organist Divides; for that Part which Divides should always be
heard lowdest.

When this is done, both Viols may Play another Strain together, either in
quick or slow Notes, which they please; and if the Music be not yet spun out
to a sufficient length, they may begin to Play Tripla's and Proportions,
answering each other either in whole Strains or parcels; and after that, join
together in a Thundering Strain of Quick Division; with which they may
conclude; or else with a Strain of slow and sweet Notes, according as may best
suit the circumstance of time and place.

I have known this kind of Extemporary Music, sometimes (when it was performed
by Hands accustomed to Play together) pass off with greater applause, than
those Divisions which had been most studiously composed.

16. Of Composing Divisions of Two or Three Parts.
IN Composing Division for two Bass Viols, Two Basses
you may follow the forementioned method, making sometimes This, sometimes That
Part move above or below: Sometimes answering one the other in Points, joined
together in Division; sometimes in siow, sometimes in quick Motions, such as
may best produce Variety: but after their answering one another in Points, I
would always have them join together in some lofty Strain of Division, with
which, or with some slow and pleasing Descant you may conclude your Composition.

If you make Division for two Trebles, both must be in the way of Descant to
the Ground: Two trebles.
So, that (the Ground considered) the Composition is Three distinct Parts. When
the Trebles move together, their most natural passage is in Thirds one to the
other; sometimes in Sixths or a mixture with other Concords, but still such as
have relation to the Ground. As for their answering one another in Points;
their several Motions and Changes, in order to Variety; the same is understood
as of the former.

In Composing for a Treble and Bass, you are to consider the nature and compass
of either Part, Treble and Bass.
framing your Division according thereunto; which, in the higher Part will be
Descant; in the lower, a more frequent Breaking of the Ground.

The same regard, to the nature of the Parts, Two Trebles and a Bass. Two
Basses and a Treble. Three Basses.
must be had in Composing for two Trebles and a Bass, or for two Basses and one
Treble.

In Divisions made for three Basses, every Viol acts the Treble, Bass, or
Inward Part, by turns. But here you are to take notice, that Divisions of Three
Parts, are not usually made upon Grounds; but rather Composed in the manner of
Fancies; beginning commonly with some Fuge, and then falling into Points of
Division; answering one another; sometimes two against one, and sometimes all
engaged at once in a contest of Division: But (after all) ending commonly in
grave and harmonious Music.

Howbeit, if, after each Fancy there follow an Air (which will produce a
pleasant Variety) the Basses of These consisting of two short Strains, differ
not much from the nature of Grounds. These Airs or Almains begin like other
Consort Airs; after which the Strains are repeated in diverse Variations, one
Part answering another, and sometimes joining together in Division, as formerly
mentioned.

In these several sorts of Division of two and three Parts, my self, amonst
others more eminent, have made diverse Compositions, which perhaps might be
useful to young Musicians, either for their Imitation or Practice: but the
Charge of Printing Divisions (as I have experienced in the Cuts of the Examples
in this present Book) does make that kind of Music less communicable. Howbeit,
if you desire written Copies of that sort, (a thing most necessary for those
who intend to Compose such like themselves) none has done so much in that kind,
as the ever Famous and most Excellent Composer, in all sorts of Modern Music,
Mr. John Jenkins. And here might I mention (were it not out of the rode of my
design) diverse Eminent men in this our Kingdom; who, in their various and
excellent Compositions, especially for Instruments, have (in my opinion) far
outdone those Nations so much cried up for their excellency in Music: but my
naming them would signify little, they being sufficiently known and honored
by their own Works; neither had I taken upon me to nominate any particular
person, had it not been upon the necessary account of Division-Musick, the
peculiar Subject of our now ended Discourse.
