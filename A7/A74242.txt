A Declaration of the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament.
Die Martis, 30. Martii 1647.
THat the two Houses of Parliament having received information of a dangerous
Petition, with Representations annexed, tending to put the Army into a
distemper and mutiny, to put conditions upon the Patliament, and obstruct the
relief of Jreland, which has been contrived and promoted by some persons in
the Army. They do declare their High dislike of that Petition, their
approbation and esteem of their good Service who first discovered it, and of
all such Officers and Soldiers as have refused to join in it, and that for
such as have been abused, and by the persuasion of others drawn to subscribe
it; if they shall for the future manifest their dislike of what they have done,
by forbearing to proceed any further in it, it shall not be looked upon as any
cause to take away the remembrance and sense the Houses have of the good
service they have formerly done, but they shall still be retained in their good
Opinion, and shall be cared for with the rest of the Army in all things
necessary and fitting for the satisfaction of persons that have done so good
and faithful Service, and as may be expected from a Parliament, so careful to
perform all things appertaining to Honor and Justice; As on the other side it
is declared, That all those who shall continue in their distempered condition,
and go on in advancing and promoting that Petition, shall be looked upon, and
proceeded against as enemies to the State, and disturbers of the Public peace.

Die Martis. 30. Martii 1647.
ORdered by the Lords Assembled in Parliament, That this Declaration be
forthwith printed and published.
