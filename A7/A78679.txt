A COPY Of an intercepted Letter from His Majesty, To the Lords and
Gentenlemen, Committees of the Scots Parliament, together with the officers of
that Army.
MY Lords and Gentlemen: It is no small comfort to me, that my Native Country
has so true a sense of my present Condition, as I find expressed by your
Letter of the eight of this Month, and your Declaration, both which I received
upon Friday last, and the same reason which makes you Discreetly and Generously
at this time, forbear to press any thing to me, hinders me likewise to make
any particular Professions unto you, left it may be imagined that desire of
liberty should now be the only Secretary to my thoughts: Yet thus much I cannot
but say; that, as in all humane Reason, nothing but a free Presonall Treaty
with me, can settle the unhappy Distractions of these distressed Kingdoms: So,
if that could once be had, I would not doubt, but, that (by the grace of God) a
happy Peace would soon follow. Such force (I believe) true Reason has in the
hearts of all Men, when it may be clearly and calmly heard; and I am not
ashamed, at all times, to profess, that it has, and so shall be always want
of understanding, not of will, if I do not yield to Reason whenever, and from
whomsoever I hear it; and it were a strange thing, if Reason should be less
esteemed because it comes from me, which (truly) I do not expect from you:
your Declaration seeming to me, (and I hope your Actions will prove that I am
not deceived) to be so well grounded upon Honor and Justice; that albeit by
way of opinion, I cannot give a Placet to every Clause in it: Yet I am
confident, upon a calm and friendly Debate, we shall very well agree. To
conclude; I cannot (for the present) better show my thankfulness to you, for
the Generous and Loyal expressions of your Affections to me, then by giving
you my honest and sincere Advice; which is, Really and Constanstly, without
seeking private Ends, to pursue the Public professions in your Declaration,
as sincere Christians and good Subjects ought to do, always remembering, that
as the best foundation of Loyalty is Christianity; So true Christianity teaches
perfect Loyalty, for without this Reciprocation, neither is truly what they
pretend to be: But I am both confident that needs not to you, as likewise that
you will rightly understand this, which is affectionatly intended by

Carisbrook, Monday 31 July, 1648. YOUR (...)
