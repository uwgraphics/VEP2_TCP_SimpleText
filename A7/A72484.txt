was the nerrest way to pacifye and establische the conscience of ane christian
man in all materis of debait concerning faith, and religioun. I answerit, and
said, that questioun was ouir curious for ane man of my knawlege. Nochttheles, I
schew ou my sobir judgment, of yt quhilk I persauit ow mekle better content nor
their was cause: Quhairthrow inoportunelie have e often, and diverse times pray it
me, that I wald dilait our questioun, and put my judgment their of in write,
makand ane tractiue of the samyn: quhilk I have done (on the manner) as it hes
plesit god to supporte my great ignorance, and sobit knawlege. And dedicatis it

I AM assurit (beneuolent redare) quhe^ thou dois mark and considder the title

their is sua great diversity of opinioun amangis swa money pregnant men of

THE FIRST CHAPITRE.
THE Nerrest, and only way (beneuolent redare) to be satifiit and
establischeit in all materis brocht in debait concerning faith, and religioun
of all good christian man, is (after my sklinder and sobir judgment)
diligently to mark and considder: Give almychtie GOD (quha off his infinite
gudenes euir sen the first creatioun of man hes prouidit al thing is that mycht
be for the weill of man cocerning both Saul, and body,) hes alreddy prouidit
ane ordour, and way in cais of debait: be the quhilk all me^ hes just occasioun
to be satifiit? or give it be left in liberty to al me^ to be satifeit
according to their awin knawlege and understanding? Trewlie it is to be thocht,
that their hes been sum better ordour prouidit be almychtie GOD to tak away ye
occasionis of questioun or debait that hes fortunat, or sall fortune to rise in
materis concerning faith and religio^n, nor every man to tak quhat opinion he
plesis. And to ye effect that we may the mair perfectly understand, quhat is
the ordour that almychtie GOD hes prouidit to tak away questioun, and debait,
and to have perpetuale tranquillity and quietness in our conscience: we mon
considder that al error, and debait that euir hes been sen the beginning, hes
cheiflie procedit of the false and wra^g understanding of ye law, and scripture
of almychtie GOD. Tharfor quhensu^euir question or debait rysis, not for the
word of almychtie God, bot for the rycht understanding of the samyn: It is
markis point to considder, and know, quha is the judge appoyntit be God to
discern the rycht understanding of goddis word fra the wrang. Quhilk judge gif
all christian man were resolute vpoun, the great occasioun of error were taken
away. Quha is the judge? ye opinionis and judgment of money lernit and pregnant
men of ingyne ar different, and that nocht without the great calamity, misery,
and hurt, of ye kirk of god: Specialie in their dayis, quhairinto all hereseis
apperis to be assemblit, and gatherit to gidder as ane arrayit hoiste, to
inuaid, oppres, and alluterlie dounthryng the congregatioun, swa deirlie bocht
be the blude and death of Jesus Christ our Salueour.

As towart the principale point of our purpose, quhilk is to know quha is the
judge? The haly scripture of almychtie GOD (auld testament and new) the plane
pratick, and experience, (quhe^ ordour hes been taken for materis in debait
concerning the faith) euir sen the time of the Apostolis unto their dayis,
togidder with all good ressoun and authority, planelie, suffecientlie, and
habundantlie, perswadis, declaris, and techis, the kirk of GOD (callit the
christian congregatio^n) to be the only judge: to quhame all christian man
sulde have refuge, to be resolute, and pacifiit in conscience, in all materis
brocht in debait, concerning faith and religioun: and specialie in discernyng
the true understanding of goddis word fra the wrang, the scripture of GOD be
and the faithful and godly wytnes berar to the treuth, and verity of ane
christian ma^nis faith and religio^n, conform to the sayingis of our salueour
in sanct Iohnis Euangel, saying their wordis: Ioha. 5.
Cearse yescriptures, because they beir wytnessing of me. Mark (good redare)
ye scripture to occupy ye place of ane wytnes, and not ye place of ane judge. It
is ye dewite of ane judge to pronu^ce sentence, and of ane wytnes to beir
wytnessing. Tharefore it followis weill, quhasumeuir beris wytnes can nocht be
judge. Treuth it is, the kirk (callit the christian congregatioun) appoyntit be
GOD to be judge, is bunde to pronu^ce sentence conform to the tryale, and
instructioun hade be the scripture, as the true evident and faithful witness
berar of the will and mind of the Lord.

Sum factius, and curious men techeis the scripture to be judge, quha under the
pretense of ye auanceme^t and liberty of the Euangell, hes euir socht the
liberty of their flesche, furthsettyng off their errouris, auancement of their
awin glore, curiosity, and opinioun, wrestand and thrawing the scripture,
contrare the godly menynge of the samyn, to be the scheild and buklare to
their lusts, and heresiis. For give the scripture were judge (as men geuin to
opinnion in their dayis dremis) tha^ sulde follow money great inconuenientis: in
speciale that their sulde neuir be fine, nor resolution taken of any errouris.
For quhy? their was neuir man geuin till error (how great that euir it was) bot
he allegit the scripture to be for him, and wald tak na other judgment, nor
interpretatioun of ye samyn, bot sic as he thocht gana^d for his purpose.

This sulde the christian congregatioun, leave in perpetuale debait and
incertitude, give ye scripture were judge, as eftirwart ( GOD wylling)
habundantlie salbe declarit.

To the effect that we may the mair perfectly understand, how and in quhat
manner it appertenis to the kirk (callit the christian congregation) to tak
ordour in all materis brocht in debait concerning faith, and religio^n, as ye
only judge appoyntit be GOD to discern the rycht vnderstandying off goddis
word fra the wrang: necesiarelie we mo^ know, quhat is the kirk. Quhilk term
and word is taken in the scripture diverse manner off wayis, quhilkis all to
rehers were mair curious nor proffitabyll: and our pretense is not to satifie
and delight the delicat earis of curious men, bot to establische ye conscience of
sick as ar of mair sobir knawlege, Mark
and understanding nor be ar, give their be any.

This term and word kirk, or congregatio^n, Quhat is the Kirk
ama^gis money other wayis yt it is taken for i^ scripture, su^tyme it is taken
for ye heal and universal congregaoun unit to gidder in ane faith be Baptime,
to ye quhilk Christ is the head, Ephe. 1.
the congregatioun the mystical body, Coloss. 1.
and me^bris of Jesus Christ our salueour, in to ye quhilk, ar contenit o^ng and
auld, pure and rich, lernit, and Timo 2. 1. Cor. 5.
lawit, vicius, and virtuous, (they nocht being excommunicat nor heretikis).
Off this we have diverse exemplis both in the Euangelis and the Epistolis of
sanct Paull. The Math. 13. and 25.
kirk and co^gregatioun after this manner foresaid taken generally, is nocht the
principal way aggreabil till our purpose, be ressoun the kirk taken sua
ge^neralie, can neuir be gatherit togidder to tak ordour in materis concerning
faith. For quha will thynk that learnit and lawid, oung and auld (quhilkes ar
all membris of the co^gregatioun albeit thaye be nocht appoyntit to that
office) ar able to confer scripturis to discern the true understanding of
goddis word fra the wrang. Notheles, of this mystical body of Jesus Christ our
salueour, callit ye kirk and congregation vniuersalie and generalie taken, is
apoyntit be GOD, and euir hes been, ane speciale member, and quhatsu^euir
ordour was taken be ye said particulare member, had the sam denominatioun,
strenth, and effect: as give all the rest of the me^bris had co^currit, and
been present tharewt. Quhilk we sal preue planelie be Scripture ( GOD wolling)
both auld testament and new. Before that we cite the scripturis to confirm and
appreue our purpose, (...) will we mair planelie and familiarelie (ler^^t be
the Apostole sanct Paull) teache be exempyll how and in quhat manner, su^tyme it,
that is done be ane special member 1. Cor. 12
of the body, hes ye samyn den^^^^atioun, strenth, and effect, as give all the
(...) were present co^currand tharewt. For in ye understanding of this:
consistis the heal purpose, and markis point quhilk we schute at.

This term kirk, or congregatioun, propirlie may be comparit to this word,
body. Ane body is maid and ionit togidder, comprehending diverse me^bris.
Notheles, al ye me^bris of ane body are not apoyntit to ane Romans 12.
office. For give sua were, than were it nocht ane body, bot ane member: swa the
kirk or congregatio^n is al me^bris of a body: notheles al ye me^bris of the
co^gregatio^n ar nocht appoyntid to ane office. For sum is callit be God to ane
vocatioun, and su^ to ane other, as the Apostole 1. Cor. 12.
techeis. Als like as it is apoyntit be god to ye Ee, (quhilk is bot ane
speciale^ member of the body) to fouse all the inconuenientis yt may en^ on to
the rest of the me^bris of the body, and quhatsu^euir thing is foresene be ye
E, he yt sa^^yn denomination, strenth, and effert, as give all the me^bris of
ye body had co^currit, and seen with ye E: swa it appertenit to ye Apostolis, and
Seniouris eneite, to fouse all the inco^uenientis that mycht have cumin upon ye
rest of the me^bris of the congregation, concerning faith and religioun: and
swa ye apostolis and seniouris in their time were the E, and judge to discern
the true understanding of goddis word fra the wrange: quhareupon specia^^e the
occasioun of all materis of debait, and inco^uenientis concerning ye faith
rysis: and sen ye time of ye Apostolis and seniores (euin unto their dayis) they
quhilk succedit in ye apostolis place dewlie co^uenit togidder in general
co^nsalis, conform to the exemple of ye Apostolis, should, and euir hes been
judge, be the quhilkes ordour was taken to have ye rycht understanding of goddis
word, and all schysme, questioun, and debait, quhilkis were in the
co^gregatioun, were euir establischit: Swa that quahtsu^euir ordour was taken be
the Apostolis and seniores in that time; and sen ye time of the apostolis and
seniores, thai, quhikes succedit in their place dewlie co^uenit in general
counsalis (notwithstanding that they were bot ane special member of the
congregatioun) had the samyn denomynatioun, strenth, and effect, representand
the vninersale kirk, as gyf all the rest of ye me^bris had co^currit their with.

THE SECVND CHAPITRE.
NOW Restis to preue be plane testimony off scripture, the Apostles and
Seniores and them quhilkis succedit in their place (dewlie co^ uenit in
generale Cunsales) to represent the hale kirk and universal congregatioun, and
to be the only inge to discern the rycht understanding of ye scripture fra the
wrang to the rest of the mem^us, ye scripture being thairto faithful wytnes
berar and true evident, quhareby the Apostolis and all vtheris succedyng in
their place, hes taken instru^tidun of the will and mind of the lord, and be
this ordour were all errouris confoundit, quhilkes ^^^s of the wrang
understanding of the scripture, and the rycht understanding of the samyn, maid
patent to the rest of the co^gregato^in. To preue their foresadis, diverse
testimonyis of scripturis beand left (yt we give noth^ occasioun of fascherie
to ye redare) specialie will we call to rememberance to confirm our purpose;
it yt is w^i^in in y^ fiftene chapitre of the actis of ye Apostlis as after
follouis.

Actis. 15.
And certane men, quhilk come fra Iowry, techeit the brether, except e be
Circumcidst after the manner of Moses, e can nocht be sauit: not^ a little
sedutioun being mouit to Paull, and Barnabas aganis them, than they determinit
that Pauil and Barnabas, and certane vtheris, of them should pas to Jerusalem
unto ye Apostlis and eldatis about this questioun. Quhe^ they were cum to
Jerusalem, they were ressauit with the congregation, and Apostolis, and eldaris.
Than raise certane of ye sect of the Phariseis quhilkes did believe, sayng, yt it
was neidfull to circumeide them and to command them to keip the law of
Moses. And the Apostolis and eldaris come togidder to ressoun upon this matter.
Quhe^ their was mekle disputatio^n, Peter raise up and said unto them. e men
and brether, e know how la^g quhyle syne GOD chesit amangis ws, Act. 10.
that the Gentiles be my mouth should heir the wordis of the Euangell and believe.
(and after followis in the samyn text) and quhen they held their peace, James
answerit, saying, e men and brether herkin unto me. Simon tald how God at ye
beginning viseit the gentiles to ressaue off them ane pepyll in his name, to
this aggreis ye wordis of the Propheit as is wryttin, Amos. 9.
after this I will return agane and big the Tabernacle of Danid quhilk is
fallin down. (and after that James had citit and co^ferrit the scripturis, it
followis in the text) quhairfore. I judge that we troubyll not them quha fra
amagis the gentiles ar turnit to God, bot that we write that they abstain fra
ye filthynes of Ydolis, fra fornicatioun, fra it that is worteit, and blude.
Beneuolent redare, give you diligently will mark, and considder ye wordis ^bere
rehersit, thou sall find, and persaue diverse g^dlie and proper lessouis
aggreable for the establisching of our purpose. First thou sal mark and
co^sidder, that albeit Paulus and Barnabas (as ye scripture techeis Act. 13.
ws) was two Apostolis appoyatit be GOD to be prechoutis to the gentiles, and
yat they had the 1 Cor. 7.
spreit of God to preche the treuthe and verity, (as Paul him self testifeis
in money places) it wald they nocht be sa bald, as priuelie to decerne upon the
questioun mouit in the congregatioun, unto the time they come to Jerusalem,
quhare Peter the chief apostole was, with the rest of the Apostolis and Senioris.
Be this exemple off scripture we are sufficiently istructit na private noumer
(how godly and weil lernit that euir they be) to be sufficient, or ganand to
tak ordour in materis concerning faith and religioun. And als w^persaue how
vain and incertane is the judgment of money in their dayis, that folischelie
followis, and addictis them selfis to the wickit opinioun of su^ private
factius me^ towart the interpretatioun of scriptures, rebu^and and settand at
nocht the interpretatioun of Ancient generale counsales, to ^uhame it
appertenis (be the ordinance of almychtie GOD) to interpreit scripturis.

Secundlie, it is to be markit of this text, yt after that Paulus and Barnabas
were ressauit be the Congregatioun, Apostolis, and Eldaris, the Apostolis and
Eldaris onche, conuenit to dispute and decerne vpoun the questioun inouit in y^
congregatioun betuix the Iowis and Gennies. Quhareby we are learnit that it
appertenit to the Apostlis and eldaris dewlie co^uenit togidder, to dispute,
resson, and to pnunce sentence of materis brocht in debait concerning the true
understanding of the word of GOD: as the speciale me^o^r of the co^gregatioun
appoyntit be God to that office, and their deliberatioun in materis concerning
faith, and religioun, and interpretation of scripturis, to have ye samyn
denominatioun, strenth, and effect, as ye rest of the heal me^bris of the
congregatioun had co^currit their with.

Thridlie, it is to be notit that after Paulus and Barnabas had oppoyntit, and
declarit to the apostolis, and eldaris, ye questioun and debait that ra^^^n the
congregation betuix the Iowis and Gentiies, the Iowis being indurit perswadyng
cit^u^cisioun to be necessare with Baptime the Genteies be the co^trar disdanyng
the ok and seruitud of circu^ciu^oun, thynkand baptime only sufficient, Raise
up Peter, and after co^ferryng of scripturis, declarit Baptime sufficient without
Circu^cisioun. And als James citit ye scripturis to beir wytnessing, and
appreue the sayingis of Peter, quhilk being done, James in the name of the rest
of the apostolis (Because he was pastor, and bischop of Jerusalem quhair ye
apostolis were conuenit for the time) pnuncit sentence, and said: I judge. mark
good redare peter and James to callto remembrance the testi monits of
scripture, as wytnes berar of ye will and mind of ye lord, and ye apostolis to
occupy yt place of ye judge to ye questio^n mouit in ye congregatio^n. For James
said not, the scripture iugis, decernis or geuis sentence, Bot he takis the
place of the judge (in ye name of ye rest of ye apostlis) upon him self saying,
I judge. And to the effect that thou sall ye mair cleirlie persaue the Apostolis
to occupy the place of ane judge, to the interpretation of ye word of GOD, and
the scripture to be as wytnes berar of the will and mind of the Lord, quhareby
ye Apostolis tuke instructioun: thou sal mark ye sentence put in write, and
send away with Paulus and Barnabas, and sum other of the rest of the
congregatioun saying their wordis,

Act. 15.
It hes plesit the haly Gaist and ws to putt na other burdyng on ow, bot till
abstain fra ye filthynes of ydoles, blude, it that is worreit, and
fornicatioun, fra the quhilk e kepand ow, e do weill: and weill fair e.

Mark good redare the wordis of the sentene, saying: it hes plesit the halie
Gaist and ws, as the scripture wald say, and ws as iugis appoyntit be God to
discern the rycht understanding of goddis word fra ye wrang. Als it may be
notit that their is na testimony of ye scripture put in ye sentence, be ye
quhik it may be persauit the judgment only refertit to ye apostlis, and ye
scripture na wayis to occupy ye place of y^ judge towart ye interpretatio^n of
scripturis. Heir have we had ane perfect patroun and exemplar be the apostolis
of Jesus thrist our salueour, how and in quhat manner ordour was taken in their
dayis, and is to be takin quhe^ su^euir questioun ordebait rysis in ye
congregatioun

THE THIRD CHAPITRE.
NOW Sen we have had exempyll of the ordour yt was ama^gis ye Apostlis in to
ye new law to tak away al question schysme and debait, yt raise concerning
materis of faith and religioun: lat ws se quhat puisioun was had be almychtie
God in to ye auld law for y^ quietness of the congregatioun: quhairby we may
persaue ye great gudnes of our heavenly father towart his beluiffit creaturis i^
earth at all times, conform to the sayingis of the Propheit, saying, Esaye. 5.
Quhat mycht I have done to my wine aird: (as he wald say to my kirk, and
congrega rioun) that I did nocht? and first sall we co^sidder y^ almychtie God
sierit up the prophet Moses to be gydare and rewlare unto his chosin people,
and specialie, quhe^su^euir dout raise ama^gis them, decisio^n to be had be
him. Tharefter quhen Moses past unto ye montayne to ressaue ye law, puisio^n
was had yt Aarone and Hur should put ordonr till all questioun and debait that
mycht fortune to ryis ama^gis the people of God, As it is planelie wryttyn in
Exodi. And after their dayis that the congregatioun sulde not want remeid of
all questionis yat mycht rise ama^gis ye chosm people of god (specialie for ye
understanding of ye law and word off God) ye preistis of the Trybe of Leui, were
appoyntit be God as iugis to stay al questio^n and debait as is wrytin in
Deuternome on this manner, Gif their rise ane matter to hard for the, Deuteronomy. 17.
in judgment, and the matter cum to strife wtin thy ettis: than sal thou aryis
and get the up unto the place quhilk the lord thy GOD hes chosin and cu^ unto
the preistis of the trybe of Leui, and unto the judge yt salbe i^ tha dayis, and
ask, and they sall schaw the, the true Judgment, and thou sal do according to
yat, quhilk they of that place (quhilk thy lord GOD hes chosin) schaw the: and
you sal observe to do according till all that they inform the, according to ye
sentence of the lawis, quhilk they teache the, and according to ye judgment
quhilk they tell ye sal thou do, and declyne not fra that quhilk they schaw the,
nolder to the rycht hand, nor the left. And yt man quhilk will do presumtuuslie
and will not herkin unto the priest, (that standis their before the Lord thy
God to minister) be decreit of the Judge, that man sall de, and thou sal put
away evil fra Israel, and all the people sall heir, and feir, and do na mair
presumtuuslie.

Mark good redare this plane testimony of scripture, quhareby thou art
habundantlie instructit: quhensu^euir dout raise ama^gis the chosin people of
God, for the understanding of ye law, recours was had only unto ye preistis
of ye trybe of Leui, and to the judge that was in tha dayis to have decisioun of
their doutis, Deuteronomy. 17.
and not to the scripture. Attouir it is to be notit of this pas of scripture
above rehersit the seueir and rigorus sentence of almychtie God, yt cumis upon
thaim quhilkis stubournelie, and proudelie dissobeyis the deliberatioun, and
judgment of sic as God hes appoyntit to be iugis upon all materis brocht in
debait con cernyng the law of God, as was in ye auld law the preistis of ye
trybe of Leui, in the new law (...) Apostolis, and eldaris, and sen the time of
the Apostolis, they quhilkis succedit in yare place dewlie conuenit in generale
counsalis: quhilkis ar, and euir hes been the only Iugis appoyntit be GOD, to
establische all doutis mouit in the congregatioun to wart the understanding of
the la^w, and misteriis of ye scripture. Sen sic creuell punitio^n (as is above
Deuteronomy. 17
rehersit) was appoyntit be God to them that were dissobedient to the
ministeris in the auld law in declaratioun of the word of God: how mekle mair
creuell punischement is cu^ vpoun thaim, quhilkis contempna^dlie and curiuslie
leanis to their awin judgment, and su^ other private factius personis,
dissobeying the deliberatio^n of ye ministeris in ye new law in declaratio^n of
materis doutsum concerning faith and religioun? Heir have we hade ane perfect
exempyll of the scripture of almychtie God, declaryng how and in quhat manner
ordour was taken in the auld law, for the establischeing of all doutis quhilkis
mycht have ryssin, for the understanding of the law of God.

THE FERDE CHAPITRE.
Sen we haif had perfect exe^pyl, and understanding of the ordour quhilk was
before the cumyng of our Salueour, and his apostoles, for the establischeing of
all doutis that mycht have rissin amangis the chosin pepls of GOD for the
understanding of the law, and word of GOD: and als we have had sufficient
instruction, quhat ordour was takin be the Apostoles of Jesus Christ our salueur
to discern the rycht understanding of goddis word, fra ye wrang: quhaitupon
cheiflie the occasioun of all debatis, concerning the faith rysis;

Now it is to be considderit quhat ordour was had sen ye time of the Apostlis
to their our dayis, for the quietness of ye co^gregatioun, quhe^sumeuir questioun
or debait raise (as their did money) in materis doutsum concerning our faith: and
be this ordour it sabe easy to considder, and persaue, how and in quhat manner,
almychtie GOD hes euir prouidit ane assurit way for the quietness of his deirle
beluiffit kirk, and co^gregatioun, in all aigis eris, and times: quhilk ordour
being rycht co^sidderit, sall give just occasioun to every christian man
(quhilk is of godly, and temperat judgment) to magnify, and praise his lord
GOD: and als to be satifiit and pacifiit (conform to ye title of our tractiue)
in all materis doutsum concerning faith, and religioun of ane christian man.

To cu^ to the perfect knawlege and understanding of the ordour quhilk was in
the k^ k^ff god to tak away questioun, and debait quhilk raise in the faith, sen
the time of the Apostolis unto this dayis: ye knawlege, and triale of the samyn
mon be had be ye may ancient, and autorizate authoris, and historio
graphours, quhilk hes treatit of sic purposis, be ressoun ye samyn can not be
had of the scripture of almychtie GOD, noldit auld testament nor new, it is
mamfest be all wrytaris that ye christian co^gre gatioun fra the time of the
Apostolis, to y^ time of ye may excellent, and godly imperour callit
Constantine (quhilk was the space of three hundredth eris and mair) tholit sic
cruel persecutioun (not all anerlie of wickit, and Infidele princis, bot als
of heretikis, quha falsely professit thaim to be good christ^ane men, as money
dois in their (dayis) yt ordour could nocht be had, be the quhilk resolutio^n
mycht have been in materis brocht in debait concerning faith.

Amangis money wickit opinionis and errouris quhilkis rang in the time of
constantine the godly imperour, Eccl. hi^ Lib 10. Cap. 1.2. Trip. hist lib. 1,
cap 1.2.
and before his time their was ane in speciale, quhilk was sterit up be ane
wickit priest callit Arrius, quha was ane techear i^ane chief roun of Egypt
callit Alexandria: his error we are nocht wylling nor curious to rehers,
because their is sua money now in their dayis swa procliue to error: bot alwayis
his opinioun (be al me^ of godly learning) was thocht verray wickit co^trar
the scripture of GOD treulie understand: notheles he mantenit ye samyn be
diverse testimoniis of scripturis, quhilk is, and euir hes been familiar to al
heretikis to fortify and color their wickit oppinionis be allegiance of
scripturis thrawin after their manner: Math. 4.
as did ye Devil wylling to perswaid our Salueour be scripture falsely
allegit. It plesit GOD that be assistence, and fortificatioun of this may
nobyll and godly imperour, their suide be asse^blit, and gatherit togidder in
ane generale co^nsale into anetoun callit, Nicea, three houndrerh and auchtene
bischoppis, to resso^n and diffine upon ye error sterit up be Arrius: and be
this ord our, ye foresaid noumer of bischoppis co^uenand, according to the
exemple of the Apoostolis, the questien beand maturelie disputit, inuocatioun
maid vpo^n GOD, the Scripturis falsely allegit be Arrius to fortify his error
were trewiie interpretit, and the true faithful understanding of the samyn maid
patenr to the rest of ye congregatioun, and ye error conde^pnit. Notheles this
error was ma^taynit ane lang time after that it was co^dempnit be the laudabyl
counsale Nicene, like as their is money in their dayis quhilkis dois appreue, and
fortify, diverse great erroures, tustly condempnit of la^g time bypast be money
laudable and godly gn^ral co^nsalis, to quhame it appertenis (sen the time of
the Apostolis, and that be the prouisioun of God) to decerne on all materis
doutsu^ concerning ye true understanding of ye scripture: as (God wyllu^g) we
have, and sal sufficient^e preue. Thou sal mark (good redare) that alb^^t this
laudabyll ^^^nsale Nicene, was conuenit be thei^mperale power, and affistence
of ye may noble and godly Imprrour Constantine: notheles he occupyit na
place in judgment to ressoun on the questioun mouit in the co^gregatioun, bot
referrit the judgment allan^lie to the three hundredth and auchtene byschoppis
quhilkis were conuenit togidder: as may be cleir lie persauit in the tent buke,
Hist: Td. Lib. 2. c2. 2.
the secunde chapitre of historia ecclesiastica and in diverse other ancient
historiographouris. This counsale Nicene was ye first gn^rale co^nsale
immediately eft ye time of ye Apostolis, quhairby ordour was taken to confund
erroures: notheles their was su^ other provincial co^nsalis of before, Hist,
ecct Lib 6. c2. 33. and. Lib. 7. Cap. 25.
as was the Provincial Counsale quhareintyll Nouatus error was co^dempnit,
and diverse dtheris prouinciale counsalis, quhairinto the error of Paulus
Samosatenus was lykwyse condampnit: their forsaids priuatis and prouin cial
co^nfalis in the time that the kirk tholit may intolerable persecutioun, was
haldin.

To cum to r^orther knawlege of the ordoure quhilk was in the kirk of GOD after
the time off the Apostlis for the quietness of ye co^gregatioun, and
establisching of errouris quhilkis raise aganis ye faith: Thou sal co^sidder, yt
after the counsale Nicene, immediately followit the godly general co^nsale of
Constantinople, quhairinto was conuenit ane houndreth and fyftie bischoppis,
Eccl. hist Lib 10, cap.
scriptures being co^ferrit, inuocatioun maid vpoun God, conform to the
exemple of the Apostlis, the wickit error of Macidonius (quha was bischop of
Constantinople) with vtheris diverse, 23. and telp Hist. lib. 5 Capi, 41.
was justly condempnit.

THE FIFTE CHAPITRE.
THAIREFTER (thridlie) succedit the godly generale counsale Ephisene, Teip
hist. Lib. 12. Cap. 4.
quhairinto was justly co^dempnit the blasphem^us and intolletable heresy of
^^storius, incontrar ye divine mystery of the incarnatioun of ou^ Salueour,
affirma^d our salueour (and y^ (...)) to have two naturis diuidit in two
personis, and be the ane persoun to be the sone of GOD, and be the other to be
ye sone of man: inferrand that the blyssit virgin Marie was not ye mother of
God and man, bot the mother of man only. Thus was hie contrarius in his
wickit opinioun to the true faith, and believe of ye kirk of GOD, quhilk
(conform to ye word of God trewlie understand) hes euir techeit, our Salueour
to have two natures in ane persoun, quhareby the virgin Marie aucht and sulde
justly be callit the mother off God and man: notheles he fortifiit his wickit
heresy be three score of passis of scripture allegit be him (on his manner) swa
that give the scripture had been judge, he thocht he had sufficient matter to
defend his error, allegeand the scripture as the only judge euir for him, and
walde resiaue na other iterprctatio^n of ye samyn, betsie as he thoche gana^d
for his purpose: quhairby we may persaue that it oppiunis ane plane port to all
errouris to make the scripture judge, for their was neuir man genin till error
bot he allegit scripture habunda^tlie for his purpose. And quha doutis bot
Nestorius said planelie ye counsale Ephesene errit: and he had the true spreit
of GOD? as we may se in our dayis daily exemple, every man quhilk is ge uin to
opinioun, and it were neuir sua wickit, he will schaw (on his manner) scripturis
abunda^tlie both of the auld testament and the new for him, suerand the spreit
of GOD to repose in his breist, and swome in his lyppis, estemand ye counsalis
all to be led with the spreit of error and ignorance.

Thairfore meruell nocht (beneuole^t redare) albeit men geuin to wickit
opinioun lychtleis, contempnis, and settis at nocht the deliberatio^n off the
kirk of God (quhilk trewly is representit be ye generale counsalis dewlie
conuenit) takand the scripture only to be their judge, for that was euir ane
familiare falt and it is to al heretikis: because the declaratioun of
scriptures beand admittit conform to the i^terpretatio^n of the gn^rale
co^nsalis (as they aucht and sulde be of ressoun) than sall na private factius
ma^nis opinion nor vain glore (quha wald be thocht singular i^ his awin
oppinioun) have place.

Ferdlie followit the generale counsale of Calcedon worthy euirlastand memory,
quhairin were co^uenit sax hundredth and threttie Byschoppis, after the form of
the Apostolis invocation maid upon god, scripturis beand co^ferrit, ye wickit
heresy of Eutices was justly co^dempnit.

Beneuolent redare, give we walde call to reme^berance al ye generale
co^nsalis, quhilkis hes been fra the time of the Apostolis till our dayis,
quhairin ye wickit hereseis quhilkis raise aganis the true faith were justly
co^dempuit, our sobir and little tractiue sulde exceid ye boundis, and grow
unto ane great werk. Our pretense is (as it will pleis the lord GOD to
supporte our imperfectioun, and ignorance) to bestow our laubouris, as may be
to the glore of God, the quietness of the congregatioun, and after the may
compedious manner, to the eais and content me^t of the redare. Thairfore will
we cease fra ferther citatio^u (ordourlie) of ye gn^rale counsales, bot as the
occasioun sall serve. Nocht bot equale credit is to be geuin to the rest of the
generale counsales dewlie conuenit as to the co^nsalis above rehersit.

Heir have we hard diverse exemplis, of the ordour that was had in the kirk of
God, after the time of the apostolis, for ye quietness of ye co^gregatioun, and
suppressioun of errouris: swa that be this ordour above rehersit, and be the
general consalis dewlie co^uenit quhilkes succedit thairefter, weral erroures
justly condempuit, quhilkes raise of y^ wrang understanding of goddis word, fra
ye time of the Apostolis to their dayis: and the rycht understanding of ye samyn
maid patent to the rest of the Congregatioun.

It is nocht unknown to me, how that their is money in their dayis doutsum
(specialie sic as the apostolis spekis of, quhilkis ar inconsta^t, Ephe. 4.
^aueryng, and careit about with every wynd of doctrine) give the generale
co^nsalis representis the heal kirk of God (as I wald say) give it that is
done be the generale co^nsalis dewlie co^uenit, hes, and sulde (be the
ordinance of God) have, ye denominatio^n, strenth, and effect, as it had been
done be al ye me^bris of the co^gregatio^n and gyf they occupy the place of the
Apostolis, to wart the interpretatioun of scripturis? Ouha will diligently mark
our procedyngis above rehersit? I believe he sall find ane grer part of their
doutis al reddy declarit, notheles after the form of disputatioun, we sall do
diligence to move ye questiounis quhilkis we have hard, or red in the co^trar
of our purpose: and appelis the conscience of the ineffectionat redare to
considder, give we do the samyn trewlie or nocht. Thairefter God wylling we
sall schaw good will, to declare the foresaidis doutis as salbe fundin
aggreable to goddis word, and to ye co^tenteme^t of al me^, quhilkes ar of
godly and te^perat judgment. After this manner will we moan the first questioun.

Albeit that it apperteneth to the apostolis, be the prouisioun of God to tak
ordour in all materis off debait concerning ye faith, and specialie to
i^terprete ye scripturis, as thai quhilkis had ye spreit of god, and were ye
true kirk: It argume^tis not yat vtheris, quha hes conuenit sensy^e in generale
con^^les had the spreit of GOD, or were the true kirk: because that money of
their deliberationis ar aganis the word of God, and true kirk, for their awin
singular comoditie, proffeit, and vain glore: quhay vuder the pretense of
goddis glore, seikis euir ane way to set forwart superstition and tradioun off
men, as did the Scribes and Phariseis. And als: the Apostolis leuit ane Godly
life, precheande and techeand trewlie the word of God, wylling to suffer all
torment and distres for Christis saik; Be the contrar, they in their dayis, quha
vendicatis, and takis to thaim selfis (and yt iniustlie) ye place of the
Apostolis, and true kirk, (quha ar of very tie the kirk malingnant) nolder
leuis anegodlie life, nor it precheis, nor techeis the true ward of God.
Ouharefor sen they do na thing like to the apostolis (bot be the plane contrar)
their deliberationis, and i^terpretationis of scriptures are not to be ressauit
as the interpretatioun of the apostolis and true kirk of God, bot as the
interpretatioun of ye kirk malignant, Scribes, and phariseis.

To cum to ane resolute and perfect answeir off this questioun, and argument
above rehersit, their is four poyntis of the samyn specialie to be markit.
First to co^sidder, give ye g^^rale co^nsalis had the spreit of God to do that
thing quhik ryndit to the weill of the rest of the co^gregatio^un as had ye
Apostolis? Secundlie it is to be markit gif the generale counsalis representis
the true universal kirk of God, hauand authority as had ye Apostolis to
interpret scripturis, and to be as judge to discern the rycht understanding of
the samyn fra the wrang? Thridlie, give they quhilkis co^ uenit in generale
counsalis (sen ye time of the apostolis) leuit ane godly life conform to the
Apostlis? Ferdlie, give their constitutionis were aggreabyll with ye word of GOD
or nocht? Their four partis being weil declarit, and soluit, ye questionn above
mouit for ye may part will be maid patent.

As to the first part, to considder, give the generale consalis had ye spreit
of God, as had the apostolis or not, you mon considder (good redare) yat the
gift, and promeis of the haly gaist, was not promisit and geuin to the
apostolis only in respect off thaim quhay were callit to be Apostlis, bot
specialie insafer as they were sterit up be God to be ministeris and
instructaris of ye rest of ye me^bris of ye co^gregatioun. Als thou mon
dilige^tlie mark, that like as it is necessare, that the kirk of GOD, (callit
the christian co^gregatioun unit togidder in ane faith be Baptime) endure to
the end of the world, swa it is necessare, that they quhilkes occupyis the
place of the Apostlis, have the gift of ye haly gaist (conform to the Mat. 28.
promeis of our Salueour) to do in all sortis that ryndis to their office:
vtherwayis, it were nocht possible, that the kirk and co^gregatio^n mycht be
ordourit, and gydit in faith, and religcoun, to ye hououre and glore of
almyhetie God. Aggreable to this purpose, thou sal mark the wordis of our
Sasueour in S. Matthew, spe kand till his Apostolis on this manner, behald, I am
with ow at all times to the end of the world: And als in sanct Iohane, Ioh. 14.
I sal pray the father, and he sall give ow ane other co^fortar, yat may bide
with ow for euir, the spirit of verity. Mark good redare, that our salueour
spekis heir to the Apostolis in the personage, and place of all vtheris chief
ministeris, and rewlaris, quhilkis were to succeid in their place be authority,
and office, to the end of the world. For quhy? the apostolis were nocht to
remain to ye end of ye warlde, as was the promeis. Nochtheles, the office
geuin to the apostolis, and authority was to endure to the end off the warlde;
because the christian congregatio^n, quhilk is now presently in the world, is
als deirlie bocht be the blude, and deith of Jesus Christ our salueour, as was
the co^gregatioun in the apostolis dayis. Thairfore, we may be sure, yt ye
promeis of the halie gaist, quhilk was maid to ye A^ostlis sal endure with ye
ministeris and rewlaris of ye kirk of GOD, (in doing that thing quhilk ryndit
to their office) in all aiges, times, and eris, unto to ye end of the world: as
propirlie may be persauit be thewordis of our Salueour above rehersit.

THE SEXT CHAPITRE.
sen We are certifeit be Scripturis, and ressoun, the promess of thee haly Gaist
nocht only geuin, and promeist to ye apostlis, bot als to ye chief ministeris
and rewlaris of the kirk of god, quhilkis bell re succeid in their authority to
the end of the warlde,

Now followis ordourlie to answeir to the secund part of ye argument, quhare
question is, give they quhilkis conuenit in generale counsalis representit the
universal trewkirk of God? Trewlie (good redare) not wtstanding, that their is
na thing mair sure, than that the generale counsalis dewlie co^uenit
representis the universal kirk off GOD, hauand authority as hade the
Apostolis, and the gift of the haly gaist, quhilk was promeist be our salueour
to his apostlis and all other chief ministeris in his kirk: it it is verray
difficile to express, and declair ye samyn planelie and ordourlie (as ye matter
requiris and is of worthynes) specialie in our language, and at ye leist to ane
man of my sobir understanding. quharefore I pray GOD, give eucry christian
man wald be satifeit in all materis doutsu^ concerning ye rycht understanding
of ye scripture, conform to ye i^terpretation of ye gn^rale co^ salis, (as
they aucht and sulde be of ressoun) without disputatioun, or argument. Bot sen we
see, yt the warlde is growin to that wickitnes and curiosity that few or nane
wylbe satifeit in materis doutsu^ concerning the faith without curious ressonyng:
e and in diverse materis necessare to be beleuit, quhilks can nocht weill be
declarit, and ressonit, bot be faith only: quhat remedy? bot euerilk faithful
minis ter in the kirk of god, to bestow the grace quhilk god hes geuin him, as
may be to the plesour off god, and ye support of the imperfectioun of ye rest
of the me^bris of the co^gregatioun. And not withstanding, yt this purpose is
fer abufe my ability to expres, and declare the samyn, I sal do my deuore to
do ye eais I may, to sic as ar of sobir knawlege, as it will pleis the geuar of
all grace to supporte my ignorance, nocht doutyng bot the gentle redare will
tak my good will i^ favor, yis be y^ grace of god, hauand the beneuole^ce of
the redare, will we proceid on this manner.

To cum to ane resolute answeir of this questio^n, quhether give they quhilkis
co^uenit in generale co^salis, representit the vinuersale kirk, and hade
authority as had the Apostolis? we mon understand, quhat is the kirk? quhilk I
believe is suffe entlie declarit in the beginning of this buke, swa that heir
plixtlie to rehers were superfluus, nochtyeles, as salbe necessare for ye
present, we sal do.

The kirk Math. 13.1. Cor. 5.
su^tyme is taken gn^ralie in ye scripture, for the universal co^gregatioun
quhairin ar co^tenit all christin me^: and after that manner ye generale
counsalis are not ye heal kirk. for quhy? every man quhilk is of the kirk
(generalie taken) is not requirit, nor ca^ be co^uenit to do that thing quhilk
appertenis to ye generale counsalis. time the kirk is taken mair specialie, for
the Act. 15.
Su^ chief pastores and Deuteronomy. 17.
of the universal congregatio^n: and after this special manner, the generale
counsalis ar ye true kirk of GOD, and representis the universal co^gregatioun,
hauand authority to interpret the scripturis, as may stand to the weil and
quietness of the hale congregation. We preue their foresaidis on this manner. It
is sure, thatt like as almychtie GOD hes appoyntit his kirk, and congregation
necessarelie to be unit togidder in ane faith be baptime, hauand his word, and
law:

Swa it is necessare that prouisioun be hade to discern the rycht
understanding of the scripture fra the wrang, specialie, quhensumeuir
questio^n, or debait rysis for the samyn: vtherwayis ye having of the scripture
without the rycht understanding of the samyn, were little or na thing proffitabyl
to ye congregatio^n. bot swa it is, that all hereseis were suppressit, and the
rycht understanding of ye scripture fra the wrang was diseernit in all aigis,
eris, and times (sen the time of the apostoles) be the generale counsalis:
tharefore it followis weill, that the generale counsalis were the special member
of the congregatioun aponytit be GOD, representyng ye heal kirk to tak ordour
in all materis of debait concerning faith. Give their be su^ (as I thynk their
be money) quhilkes ar stifneckit, berand perpetuale disdane aganis the generale
counsalis, specialie, sick as wald have liberty to thraw the scripture to
their appetyte, desyrus of vain glore, and to be thocht singular in their
awin opinioun, I will ask them of ane questioun, quhilk is verray easy to
answeir to, that is, gyf euir their was onye heresyis sen the time off christ
or nocht? I a^ sure, their is na man sua schameles, and he were neuir sua
drownit in heresy, bot he will grant their hes been money great heresyis. for
quhy? their is nocht ane article of our faith bot it hes been impugnit, and
brocht in dout be heretikis affirmand their heresyis for ye may part al be ye
scripturis falsite allegit and interpretit.

Than will I speir, give their was ane ordour taken to suppress the heresyis or
nocht? I am sure, their is na man will thynk, that GOD, neclectit ye
congregatioun swa, that it sulde leave in perpetuale debait for the faith, and
na ordour to be taken.

Than will I inqyre, quhat was the ordoure (give it was nocht be ye generale
co^nsalis) quhilk was taken? tree wlie I believe their will na man schaw ane other
meyn, quhareby heresy was suppressit bot be the generale counsalis, specialie
quhilkis raise of the wrang understanding of the scripture of GOD as all
heresyis, co^mounlye dois. Than sen we are assurit yt their hes been money
abhominabyll heresyis incontrar our faith, and the ordour quhilk was taken for
the samyn was euir only be the generale counsalis dewlie conuenit, it may be
justly inferrit, that the generale counsalis were ye member of the
congregatioun sterit up be GOD, representyngye universal kirk of God, hauand
the denominatioun, strenth, and effect, of all the memberis of the
congregatroun. I believe their is nama^ of ressonable judgment, bot he will think
that their two argumentis above rehersit susticientlye perswadis, e and
conuictis, the generale counsalis, to be the membir of the congregatio^n
representand the vmuersale kirk of God. Nochtheles, perchance their is sum swa
religious, and clean fyngerit, that their will ua thing persuade thaim without
testimony of scripture, we will seahw good will to satifie their curiosity
sumpart, and on yis manner. It is wryttin be y^ Propheit Agge.

Great salbe the giore of this latter house mair nor the first. I will ask at
the, Agge. 2.
quhat is signifeit be yis latter house? bot Christis congregation, and kirk
unit togider in ane faith be baptime? quhat is signifeit be this first house?
bot the chosin people of God, quhilkes were before ye law of the Eua^gal? have we
nocht expressie in Deuteruome, Dent. 17.
that prouisioun was had in the auld law, quhen sumeuir questioun, or debait
raise amangis the chosin people of God for the understanding of the law, recours
was hade onilie to the Preistis of ye Eribe of Leui, and to the judge, to be
satifeit in all their doutis, and that ye people should na wayis make questioun
under the pane of deith, bot to ressaue ye judgment of the ministeris quhilkis
were for ye time? Art thou nocht than be the wordis of the Propheit above
rehersit compellit to say that the ministeris of the new law (quha oc cupyis
the place of ye preistis of the Trybe of Leui, e and heychar place) hes the
samyn place (e and gretar place) to stay all doutis that rysis ama^gis the rest
of the membris of the congregatioun for the understanding of the scripture and
law of GOD, and vtherwayis, how sal the wordis off the Propheit be of verity?
saying, that the glore of this latter house sulde be mair nor the first, gyf
their be nocht als sufficient ordour, puidit be god to stay all doutis
quhilkis rysis amangis thaim of this latter house, and give the ministeris of ye
samyn hes nocht als great place to tak ordour in all materis of debait
concerning ye faith of thaim quhilkis ar of ye latter house, as had ye
ministeris of the first house. Than will we (conform to Goddis word, and all
good ressoun) conclude: ye gn^rale counsalis dewlie co^uenit (quhairin ar the
mimsteris of the new law) to represent the universal kirk of GOD, hauand full
power and authority of God to tak ordour i^ all materis quhilk ar in debait,
(specialie to discern the true understanding of Goddis word fra the wrang) as
had the ministeris of the auld law, and rather greter.

THE SEVINT CHAPITRE.
FOR Ferther co^sideratioun that they quha conuenit in generale counsalis had
power and authority to do that thing quhilk ryndit to their office, as had the
Apostolis, thou sal understand, yt al authority is of God (conform to ye
saying of ye Apostole) and al authority quhilk is of God cumis be ane Romans 13.
ordour, than mon thou co^sidder that all men quhilk is euir come to have
authority in the kirk of God ordourlie (as to be ane of the membris of ye
congregation quhilk God hes appoyntit to tak ordour in all materis of debait
concerning ye true understanding of goddis word) come ane of three manner of
wayis. The first was ve God immediate he (as I wald say, be God allanerlie) like
as ye Propheit Moses Exodf. 3.
in the auld law, the twelf Math. 10.
apostolis, and sanct Paul in the new law. The secund be God and man as was
Iosue, quha at the command of God was sterit up be Moses to be gydare to the
people. Galat. 1.
The third way was of God mediatlie (as I wald say, Number ^^
he man allanerlie having authority of God) as were and ar all the ministeris
of the new law (callit the law of the Euangell) quhilk hes been sen the time of
the Apostolis to yir dayis: nochtheles, that all their three wayis ar of god
immediately, or mediatlie: it their was ane difference in the power quhilk was
geuin to the propheit Moses, and the twelf apostolis, quha was send
immediately be god, and to them quhilkes was send be god mediatlie: in that,
that the first hade power to kyith miracles, quhilk was nocht requstit nor
necessare to the vtheris, because the Apostlis quha was send be god only, were
ye first quhilkis schew and techeit ye fundame^t of our faith: (as did Exodl. 4.
the Propheit Moses the law to ye chosm people of God) for confirmatioun of y^
samyn, it was necesiare that they quha was yt first settaris forth of our
faith, should have power to co^fitme ye samyn be miracles, vtherwayis it was
nocht abyll to the Apostlis, and Prophetis to have perswadit the doctrine
quhilk neuir was hard of before. As towart vtheris quha hes succedit in the
place of the apostolis mediatlie be God, (as I walde say be man only) it
suffices to them to do al sic thyngis as were necessare to their ministiatio^n
without miracle, sic as to minister ye Sacrame^tis, discern ye true
understanding of goddis word fra the wrange, and vtheris diverse mimstrationis
as plesit GOD to give them grace to haif instructio^n of his word, and kirk,
discendit fra aige, to aige, and time to time. Of ye foresaid is it may justly
be collectit and inferrit, sen all authority is of god, and the ministeris in
the new law (quha co^uenit in generale co^salis) hes authority of god, that
their authority is als great and sufficient to do all sic thing as ryndit to
their office to wart the weil of ye co^gregatio^n co^mittit to their cure, as
the authority of the propheit, or the Apostlis immediately geuin to them be
god, for the weill of the co^gregatioun (according to ye time) co^mitit to
their cure and office.

Their is sum quhilkis cu^is to authority, takand it at their awin hand,
nolder of God, nor man, quha is nocht worthy to be reknit in the noumer of the
rest, because they cum but ordour. Thairfor they sulde be rather callit falls
Prophetis, or prechearis, nor me^ in autharitie: as was Machomet, quha in the
time that ye people was co^fundit with y^ wickit heresy of Arrius (of quhame we
maid me^tioun in the descriptioun of ye co^nsale Micen^) and brocht in, sic
dout of yt faith, that they wyste not quhat faith to cheis, na punischeme^t ane
la^g time followand thairupon. Than thocht he time to saw his wickit seid and
doctrine, specialie, sic as was novelty, and gave liberty aggreable to their
wyttis, and desire of the people, authorissing sum godly preceptis of the law
of god, sic as were aggreadyil to their capacity, that his doctrine mycht seune
the better, and be their menis abusit ye people in profound materis concerning
their faith above their wittis: as we may se now in our dayis in all partis,
infynit dissaitfull prechearis, seand the miserable people (for laik of good
doctrine and punilchement) brocht in sic debait, and bout of the faith, under
the color of godliness, disagyse them selfis (as sais 2 Co^. 1^.
the Apostole) to be Angellis of lycht, promittyng al libertic to yt people

yt it salbe thocht yt thai cu^ be ane ordour, they will say and sweir thai ar

S. Paul. Their pestilent precharis ar to be eryit out o^ be al me^ of godly
lerni^g and judgment, because y^ authorissing of sic, is aganis the law of God,
and man, and al good resso^n. Is it nocht expreslie co^mandit be 1 Cor. 14
S. Paul, that all thing sulde be done be ane ordour? and als expreslie
forbiddin, that any man sulde Hebre. 5
usurp authority at his awin hand say and, How sall thaye preche, bot give

be send? as he wald say, be God, or man? To be assurit that they come not off
god, their is na man yt estemis him self to be send be GOD allanerlie, bot he
mon give testification of the samyn, and confirm his doctrine be miracle. for
their is na other sure way that me^ sal discern falls Prophetis, and
precheouris (quha allegis them self to be send of God) fra godly Prophetis,
and precheouris. Reid ye scripture al throw, I dar baldlie say, thou sall neuir
find onye man send be god allanerlie, and nocht be man, bot he confirmit his
doctyne be miracles, or ellis the scripture makis plane mentio^n, yt he was
send be God. To give all good christian man ferther and just occasioun to
cry out on all sick precheouris, quha priuatlie but authority will mell them
with materis doutsum concerning the faith: thou sal under stand, it may be that
ane man have the gift of the haly gaist assuritlie, and it nocht understand all
the secretis, and misteriis of ye heal Scripture. To preue the samyn thou sall
have plane testimony of scripturis and na Sophistry, nor vain inuentioun of
man. It is wryttin that the Apostlis ressauit Act. 2.
the gift of the haly gaist the fyft day, (callit in our language, wytsounday).
Amangis the rest, Peter resauit ye gift of ye haly gaist: Nochtheles, we reid
yat Peter being in Act. 10.
Ioppe, quahair he was at ludgeyng he past up to ane secreit place to pray; in
ye menety me he grew hungry. their apperit to him to cum out of ye heuin
diverse kyndis of meatis; ama^ges vtheris their come su^ quhilkis were forbiddin
of the law; their come ane voce sayng, Peter, rise, slay, and eait: he was
astonissit of the reuelatio^n, and grudgeit in his conscience to eait the
meatis forbiddin of ye law. Quhairby thou may cleirlie persaue, that albeit
lange time of before he had ressauit the gift of ye halie gaist, it this
secreit (quhether give it was leifiu^ to eait meatis forbiddin be the law or
nocht) unto that time was hyd and obscure fta him. Likewise schortlie
thairefter, he Baptizate Cornelius, and (...) his houshaulde Act. 10.^
without Circumcisioun, qu hirs was misknawin to him of before, be ye quhilk
efterwart he affermit in ye co^nsale (quhare the la^f of the Apostolis were
conuenit in Hierusaiem) yat Baptime was sufficient without Act. 1^
Circu^cisioun. Be their plane testimomeis of scripture we are instructit how
vain is the opinioun of money in their dayis quhilkis assuritlie leanis to ye
opinioun of me^ cumand but authority, in declaratioun of ye misteriis of
Goddis word, hauand na manner of lernyng nor solid judgment, ymaginand, and
dremyng yam selfis to be send be GOD, haua^d ye gift of ye haly gaist: like as
it were necessare (quhilk is nocht) that GOD sulde wirke be miracle, now geuand
them (that cu^and but any manner of authority) the gift of the haly gaist to
interpret ye secretis of our faith (it being all reddy perswadit be the kirk
of god fra time to time,) as he did to his apostolis in the beginning of the
kirk quhilk was necessare, Math. 10
as I schew the off before, because thai were send having authority of god, to
be ye first furthsettaris of our faith. And als it plesit GOD that ye faith
should be set forth in the begyuning be Ideotis hauand the gift of ye haly gaist,
Actu. 4.
quhairby it mycht be kend that our faith come not be ingyne of man, bot be god
allanerlie, quhilk is nocht necessare now. Thairfore will you co^sidder ye scrip
ture all throw, you sall persaue, that it is requirit, yat they quha succedis in
the place of the apostlis be weill ^. Timo. 3
learnit, that they may be habyll Titu^. 1.
to teache the faith to vtheres trewlie as the kirk of god hes euir techeit
thaim, conform to his word: and not to think that god sal give instructioun to
any private man older in authority, or out of authority (as he did to his
apostolis) be miracle.

Lord god may we not now weil persaue, quhat blin dnes, quhat ignorance, quhat
fury and wodnes, is croppin in the hartis of christin men in yir dayis,
quhilkes leanis to ye judgment of sic Ioh. 21.
vagabundis in materis doutsu^ concerning our faith? Refusa^d ye judgment of ye
kirk? Have we not had the plane testimonye of scripture above rehersit, how
Peter quha was ye chief apostole of Jesus Christ, to quha^ in speciale thrice
eft other he co^me^dit his flok, and gregatio^n sua deirly bocht: and it after
yat he had resaure ye gift of ye haly gaist Act. 2.
assurnly be ane visibyllsigne, he knew not all the miu^ereis, and sectetis of
godis word: and now eueri have, will gif deter minatio^n on the gretast secreit
in all ye seripturis, geuand na authority to the kirk: like as the promeis of
the halye gaist had been maid equalye to him, as to the haly kirk.

Is it not ane gretar secreit to any wind fallin prechear, e or to any private
man on live, and he were neuir sua werll learnit, and of good life, Act. 10.
to decerne onye ineffable mystery of the blyssit sacrament of ye altar nor
it was to Peter to decerne upon meatis forbiddin be ye law, and to Paul and
Barnabas to discern (quha had both assuritlye the gift actis. 13.
of the haly 1. Cor. 7.
gaist) gyf Baptime was sufficient wout circu^cisioun: quhilk they on na wayis
wald do priuatlie; Act. 15.
quhill they come to Jerusalem, quhare ye laif of the apostlis were, they beand
all co^uenit togidder, the mistirie was declarit.

For Christis saik ale quhilkis ar blyndit with ye folysche perswation of sic
profane pestilent prechearis (yat gois about like maisterles doggis) tak head
how miserabilie e ar dissauit be yame, saya^d, ef^ their harbor manner (nocht
with standing that that cu^ but ouy mane^r of ordour) quhy may not God give thaim
grace to teache and preche the treuth, as he did to Peter and ye rest of ye
apostlis? quhilk is not expedient nor necssare bot rather co^trar goddis word
and all ressoun as I schew the of before.

THE AVCHT CHAPITRE.
THEIR IS ane other co^moun saying, quhilk every man in their dayis hes in head,
specialie sick as knawis leift: quhilk presently to report apperis to me not
impropir, nor improffitable for our purpose. The saying is this. Quhy sulde
nocht every man ^eid ye scripture to seik out his awin saluatioun? hes nocht
Christ bocht ws als deir as older Bischop, Abbot, Prior, or Pape? Mon nocht
every man Galit. 6.
beir his awin burding? their will nolder monk freir, nor priest answeir for my
saul bot my self,

Because (good redare) I have hard this purpose of diverse me^, perchance of
good zele, with little knawlege: I will answeir to ye samyn, in ye may sobir,
gentle, and familiare manner I can, rather be instructioun (as god will give me
grace) nor be curtous ressoning, and on this manner. Trewlie this saying above
rehersit is verray true, and meinis weill, give it were weil understand. For it
is als necessare, that ane pure christian man know all thyngis necessare for
his saluatio^n, (without ye quhilkes he can nocht be sauit) as they quhilkes ar
in the gretast dignitieis in ye world conform to the wordis of ye Apostole
saying 1 Cor. 14.
he yt misknawis salbe misknawin: Romans 2.
and als, their is na exception of personis with GOD. Bot it the nerrest way
wald be knawir, according to the ordinance and prouisio^n of almy chtie GOD, to
cu^ to ye samyn. Me think after my judgment their is nane ner, tha^ give every
man knew, quhat were his awin burdi^g quhilk presently to declare, swa largely
as ye matter requiris, were nocht ganand, nochteles, I sall schaw good will,
specialie in favor of sic as ar of good zele without knawlege. To that effect,
you mon understand that their is ane burding co^moun to all the congregatioun,
qubilkes ar ye me^bris of Jesus Christ, hie degree, or law: Mat. 22.
that is, to lufe thy god above all thing, thy nychtbur as thy self, in their
two preceptis is contenit all ye law. Thairfore, first thou mon know them, and
understand them; thairefter thou mon keip Mat. 19.
them, (as god geuis the grace) and answeir for the samyn on the latter day
thy self, this burding is co^moun foreuery man. To cum to ane sufficient
understanding, how thou salbe habyll to understand ye law thou mon co^sidder,
that all the memberis off the co^gregatioun ar nocht burthenit alyke. for su^
is apoyntit be GOD (and that be ane ordour, as I have alreddy declarit) to be
prechearis, and techearis of goddis wourde to the rest of the 1 Cor. 12.
membris of the congregatioun, and sum to be heiraris and it all ar membris of
the congregatioun: of this I gave ye exempyll of before, and it will report.
The Ee is ane member of ye body apoyntit be god, to forese all the
inconuenientis that may cum to the rest. The eir is ane other, it argumentis
not, bot the eir is ane member of the body, albeit it do not ye office of the
Ee. Swa it argume^tis noch albeit su^ be heiraris, sum be techearis, bot all ar
membris of ane body, hauand diverse offices, for give all the me^bris of ye body
did ane office, than were it not ane body, bot ane monsterous member. Conform
to their wordis, the apostole spekis on this manner, saying, Su^ ar appoyntit be
God, to be Ephe. 4.
Apostolis, su^ to be prophetis, su^ to be doctores.

Mark the wordis of the apostole, he sayis, su^ ar ordanit to be Apostolis, he
sayis nocht, all, for gyf sua were that every man occupyit ye place of ye Ee in
ye co^gregatio^n (as I wald say) gyf every man should be ane prechear and
techear, furthschawa^d ye way of Saluatio^n at his awi^ hand, it were ane
monsterous ordour in ye kirk of GOD. Perchance thou will say, quhat and he be
blind quhilk should furthschaw the way to vtheris? thou thynkis you wald rather
seik the way thy self, nor be led with him that is blind, in adventure e fall
Mat. 15.
both in the fowsie. Wald god thou had les cause to murmur nor thou hes.
nochtheles, their is ane commoun familiar, easy way quhilk thy Lord God hes
prouidit for the, and all me^ of hie degree, or law, quhilk give thou will seik,
as the kirk of God hes euir techeit the, their is na thing necessare for thy
saluatio^n, bot thou sal find in little beundis, quhilk is ye articles of our
treuth, callit in our language, the Creid: quhairin is co^tenit all thing
necessare for ane christin ma^nis belief. The secund is ye ten co^ma^dime^tis,
quhairin is contenit ye way to pleis thy lord god conform to the faith: and do
thy deuore like ane christin man to yi nychtbour. Their after ye prayer
appoyntit be ye lord god, and to be said dayite to hi^quhairin ar contenit al
thing is necessare to be desyrit of the lord god, ganand for ane christin man,
both for saul, and body. Traist weill this is ane singular, perfect and
plane way conmoun till al christin men, and hes been prouidit fra ye beginning,
be our heavenly father. It is thocht be men of godly lerning, yt the twelf
articles of our belief were collectit be ye twelf Mat. 10.
apostlis, and albeit it be not in ye samyn ordour planelie contenit in
scripture, it it is in effect: like as their ar diverse thingis mo^ be beleuit,
quhilkis ar agreeable with goddis word, and are not expreslie contenit in
scripture, as efterwart salbe declarit. Towart ye co^mandime^tis, Exo. 20
yat ar expreslie co^tenit in scripture: and als the prayer of ye lord callit
the Mat. 6.
Pater noster. Perchance thou will speir at me, give it be necessare to believe
and use ye Sacrame^tis, and know ye proffeit thou hes be thaim? We are assurit
be the Euangell, that to believe Ioha. 3. and 6.
and use the Sacrame^tis is necessare: bot it thou sall understand that nolder
the knawlege, nor ye use of al ye Sacrame^tis ar alyke necessare. To ye effect
that thou may the mair easily understand ye proffeit that al christin man hes
be ye rycht use off the Sacramentis, thou sall mark diligently yis lessoun
followande.

Albeit as sayis the Apostole, our Salueour Jesus Christ quha is both god and
man, offerit Ephe. 5.
up his precious body, as the heavenly sacrifice, be ye quhilk the wraith, and
Roma. 5.
ire of his father was pacifyit, quhilk all man incurrit throw the offense off
our forfather Adam, ^. Cor. 15.
it thou mon understand ye Christis death tuke nocht away all syn, sua as man
was nocht habyll to commit syn. for than hade the co^mandime^tis and law of the
Lord been geuin in vain, than hade Hell been ordanit be GOD in vain, for
punischeme^t of sic as deis but repentance, disparit of goddis mercy^ than mon
you know ye Christ was maid medicine, and remeid for all syn, quha was both
med cinar, and medicyne him self, and les nor this medicyne be applyit dewlie,
it is not proffitable for the part of him that misteris the medicyne (as al
me^dois) nochtheles, 1. Ioh. 2.
ye medicyne in the self is necessare proffitable, sufficient, and mekle mair
nor sufficient, for to be remeid aganis all the synnis in the warlde.

Perchance their wordis above rehersit will appeir strange, and obscure sum part
to me^ vnlearnit. Thairfor we will schaw good will to make them mair plane, and
familiare, in this manner. Their is na dout, bot Jesus Christ our salueour was
maid sacrifice, 2. Cor. 5.
and deit for all men, as sais the Apostole, not allanerlie for faithful me^
bot als for In fideles. 1. Tim. 2
sua yt he quha was with out syn, was maid remeid for all syn: this the falt was
nocht in him bot all men were sauit, and it his deith is nocht proffitabyll to
the Infideles, and that for two causis. The first, that they give na traiste to
ye medicinar: The secund, yat they apply nocht ye medicyne according to the
will of the medicinare. And als their is money christin men that applyis the
Medicyne, and abusis the samyn, swa that it is na mair proffitabyll to them
nor to the Infideles, Now mon thou understand, yt it is not sufficient to
believe in the medicinare: bot you mon als apply the medicyne conform to the
will and mind of ye medicinare: and als do yat lyis in ye, that the medicyne may
be proffitably conform to his will, as I wald say, it is not sufficient to
believe that Christ hes deit for ws, and be his death al syn is taken away, bot
his deith mo^ be apply it till all me^ conform to his ordinance, and will, and
every man thairefter mo^ adres him self (as he hes grace) in sic ane manner as
the fruct, and proffeit of Christis deith salbe renewit, and incres to his
lastand weill.

it mon thou understand the way, and menis quharehby Christ hes appoyntit his
deith to be applyit, and renewit in all christin man, quhilk is special lie be
his blyssit Sacrame^tis: as be exemple, Ioha. 3.
we are assurit be the Euangell, that their sall na man be sauit without
Baptime, nochtheles yat Christ hes deit for all me^ or they were baptizate:
Because Baptime is ane of ye principale Sacramentis, and is the our, and
interes to the rest, quhairbye Christis deith is aplyit: This will we conclude
(conform to goddis word and all verytie) that les nor Christis deith be
applyit according to his will be his blyssit Sacramentis, and thairefter leave
conform to goddis co^mant iment (as al me^ hes grace) his deith is unproffi
table to christin me^ as to Infideles. Now will and cum to ye purpose. We may
persaue of the lessoun above rehersit that the use of the Sacrame^tis is very
necessare: sen thai ar necessare, it is als necessare, yt we understand ye great
fruct, and proffeit that we have be yame (as they may be understand) for
trewly they ar ye great and secretis, and misteriis in all ye scripture. Than,
sen they ar the gretest secretis in all the scripture, and als ar necessare to
be knawin, quhat is the nerrest way yt Christ (quha institute ye sacrame^tis,
and of quhais deith only they have all effect) hes apoyntit the congregatio^n
(quhilk is his me^bris) to cum to the rycht knawlege, and understanding of
them? Will thou say, yat because they ar necessare for all me^nis salvation, al
me^ sall reid, and co^fer ye scripturis and be that menis cearse out the
knawlege of their profund misteriis, and that to be every ma^nis burding? Now
trewlie that were ane intolerable burding for any ane man in all ye world, or
euir was in it, other nor Christ, quha is both God and man: besides that, it
sulde make ane monsterous hermony, and evil sound amangis the me^bris of Jesus
Christ: for than should their in diverse partis of ye world stert up me^ pregnant
of ingyne and every man say, that he had ye rycht understanding of ye
Sacrame^tis, and eye rycht, all partiis allegeand scripturis (as the only judge)
co^firmand ye samyn be Doctores, and antiquiters. Dois nocht ye experience
teache us yis presently? is not Luther, and his disciple Ecolampadius direct
contrar in opinioun towart ye interpretatio^n of ye blyssit sacrament of ye
alter? as efterwart salbe declarit. Attour this were alluterlie by the mind of
our salueoure. For ane of the causis quhairfore yat ye sacrame^tis were ordanit,
is, that nocht allanerlie we sall have the fruct off his passioun renewit in us
be them; bot als yat yat salbe effectuus signis, and takynnis, to knawe them
quhilkis ar of Christis kirk: this sulde every man of great ingyne get certane
to his opinioun, vsyng and interpretand the Sacrame^tis as he thocht good,
saying, and assurand him, and his cumpanye to be Christis kirk: and diverse
vtheris walde do siclyke, reknande them selfis of na les knawlege, nor
spirit. Sua miserably should Christis kirk be deuidit, Mat. 24.
the simple ignorant people alluterlie be confoundit: as the experience daily
techeis ws.

Than mon we (on force) be assurit that ye good Lord hes prouidit ane better
way for hiskirk (sua deiriy bocht) nor to be every private ma^nis burdig to
reid ye scripturis, and be ye mean to cu^ to ye knawlege of all the secretis of
goddis word necessare for ane christin mannis Saluatioun.

I dar baldlie say, conform to ye hale scripture, haith ald testament, and new
and als according to the experience of ye time, euir sen the time of the
Apostolis to their dayis, to gidder with all good resso^n, and authority, their
is nathing mair sure, nor that the nerrest, and only way to establische ye
conscience of christin me^ (in all materis doutsu^ concerning our faith,
specialie to cum to the knawlege of all the secretis of goddis word necessare
for ane christian ma^nis saluatio^n) is to have refuge to the kirk of GOD,
quhilk trewly is representis be the generale counsalis dewlie conuenit: swa yt
ye way is maid patent alreddye be ye kirk of god, according to his godly
ordinance, and provision, how all men salbe habyll to beir their awin burding
be ye grace of GOD, to the plesour of our heavenly father creator, and
redemptor (that will not contempnandlie refuse the samyn) as efterwart (God
wylling) abunda^tlie salbe declarit, togidder with sufficient answeir to all
doutis mouit is the contrar.

THE NYNT CHAPITRE.
NOW will we rehers the co^moun sayingis, thaireff schortlie declare. For
trewlie, albeit the saying is be harbor, and commoun, ye rycht understanding
of the samyn seruis mekle for me^ vnlearnit, like as the wrang ledis money in
their dayis in great errouris. Quhy sulde nocht eueryie man reid ye scripturis to
cearse out his awin Saluatioun? Mon nocht every man beir his awin burdyng? For
understanding off this purpose, we will schortlie collect of our sayingis
above rehersit, All christin me^ hauand ane generale understanding of the
articles of our faith, (conform to the understanding yat ye kirk hes techeit
ws) the ten comma^dime^tis, the prayer off the Lord callit the Pater noster; It
suffices to them, to quhame it dois not appertene of their office, nor
vocatioun, to occupy the place of the prechairis, or techearis in the
co^gregatio^n. As to ye Sacrame^tis, and all other secretis of ye scripture
stand to ye judgment of thy pasture without curious ressonyng, or cersyng of ye
secretis of godis word, quha beris thy burding in all materis doutsu^ abone thy
knawlege conform to ye saying of ye Apostole: Heb. 13.
Obey unto our superiouris and be subject unto thaim, for thai wache for ow, as
thai quhilkes fall give ane coumpt for our saulis. And in cais they be
necligent, ressaue doctrine of the kirk as the time techeis ws. Be this way,
(quhilk is conform to godis word, and al verity) it salbe asie to all men,
quhat place, or estait in the co^gregatio^n that euir he occupy, to beir his
awin burding.

Releiff of all materis doutsum is to be hade be the kirk to all private
pasturis, and they agane to be the releif of the rest of the membris of the
congregatioun. Perchance, thou will speir at me gyf it be expedienf for me^ (to
quhame it appertenis to be heraris in the cu^gregatioun) to reid the scripture?
Trewlie the opinioun of learnit me^ in this questioun is verray different,
notheles, because ye kirk as it hes nocht diffynit thairupon, me^ may speik
frelie, sua it be to ane mesure, and ressoun. As to my opinioun, trewlie I
think it expedient to al sic as will reid the scripture te^peratlie, as I wald
say in sic ane man^ as may make thaim ye mair habyil to beir their awin burding,
quhilk is to leave conform to the law, and will of the Lord. As be exempyll,
give thou be inclynit to the vnressonable desire of ye flesche, you sal reid ye
scripture, and al ye places quhairinto god hes declarit his wraith aganis
voiuptuns me^ thou sall mark: and make thy wife, thy barnis, thy houshald to
knawe the samyn, that they may flee the ire of the Lord. As is the history of
king David quhare he co^mittit adultrie 2. Re. 11.
with Barsabe Vryis wife. And als thou sall mark the scueir sentence of the
Apostole, saying, 1 Cor. 6.
Adulteraris, and fornicatouris sal not be possessouris of the kingdom of
heuin. Give thou be inclynit to creueitie? mark the history of Abimelech, Iud.
9.
quha for his great creualtie maid ane mischeuous end. Als thou sai mark ye
terrible word of the Apost^le, saying, Iaco. 2.
judgment salbe to him but mercy, Quhilk hes nocht been merciful. Give you be
temptit with dispare, call to remembrance the gudnes of almychtie god towart ye
marie Lac. 7.
Magdalene, quha was ane great synnare: Peter, quha thryse Mat. 26.
denyit his Lord. And als David, quha ekit 2. Pe. 11.
creultie till adultrie. Nochtheles, thaye all gat the favor of GOD, be
mercy, and repentance. Walde GOD their were als money co^trefatit their
cepentance as dois their vice: quha all three wepit rycht sair for their
offenses. Schortlie, their is na kind of vice, bot thou will find exempyl in
scripturis geuand the occasio^n to beir thy burding, and lufe, and feir thy
Lord GOD. Reding the scripture after this manner, trewlie, it is commendabyll,
and Godly. Bot give thou redis ye scripture (as money dois in yir dayis) to se
quhat places thou can thraw againis ye godly doctrine of the kirk, under the
pretense of goddis word, seikand ane liberty to thy awin flesche, or ellis to
be thocht singular in thy awin opinio^n, steirand up contineuall strife, and
debait in ye congregatioun, aganis ye ressauit faith and doctrine quhilk ye
kirk of god hes euir techeit ws fra aige to aige, fra time to time, fra eir to
eir, eo^forme to goddis word: Treulie, I dar baldlie say, better you had neuir
seen the scripture. For conclusioun, abufe all thing lat every private man,
quhat vocatioun that euir God hes callit him to, flee curiosity in seikyng of
the secretis, and misteriis off the scripture, in speciale, sic as the
sacramentis, predestinatioun, Mark, quhate is curiosity
predestinatioun, fre will, and iustificatioun. I call curiosity, to any
private man on life to seik ane other understanding of their secretis, nor the
genecale counsalis hes all reddy the cheit ws: quha in declaratioun of materis
doutsu^, necessare, or exchristin ma^nis saluatio^n, assurifiie hes nruse
retit. Thus, refusand our awin judgment, and all other private ma^nis (how
godly, or weill leatnit that euir they be) in all materis doutsu^ pertening our
faith, submittyng our judgment to the kirk; It salbe asie for every man,
learnit and lawit, to beir his awin burding be ye grace of GOD, in sick ane
man^, as you sal cleirlie persaue ye wordis of our salueour facile to be
understand, saying: My ok is sweit, and my burding is lycht. Be the co^trar
will y^ thynk, that it is thy burdinge to cearse cute the secretis of goddis
word be thy labouries, or ye supporte of any noumer of private me^, be
conferrence of scripturis, specialie sic as GOD, hes nocht callit to that
vocatioun: I belcue it salbe haid to persaue the ok of the lord to be plesand,
asie, and lycht, (as it is in deid) and als, difficile, or rather impossible
till every man to beir his awin burding, be yt meinis and way. Besydis this, all
christin me^ should be co^foundit be diversity of opinioun, as I schew the of
before. Tharefor, I dar baldlie say, luke al ye ordour quhilk euir was taken
amangis christin me^ sen ye time of ye apostlis to their dayis, to be satifiit
assuritlie in all materis doutsu^ concerning ye faith specialie to know the
secretis of the sacramentis: was b^ ye gn^rale co^salis. True it is, to co^fer
scripturis with scripturis, and als to mark the judgment of the ancient doctouris
of yt kirk (as they quha co^uenit in generale counsalis euir ordourlie, and
trewlie did) it helpis mekle for the understanding of goddis word, bot that is
nocht sufficient. For quhy, I believe their is not ane doctor quhilk euir was in
the kirk (as their hes been money both godly, and weil learnit) quhilk had
greter knawlege of the scripture, nor had the Apostlis: and it they differrit
the sentence, and judgment to ye time they co^uenit in ane generale counsale,
as scripture planelie techeis us. This ar we assurit yt it is nocht every
private ma^nis burdyng to cearse the secretis of the scripture, and als
constraynit fermelie to believe the generale counsalis dewlie co^uenit, to
represent the universal kirk off GOD, quhairby all the rest of the membris of
the co^gregatioun salbe satifeit and pacifeit in conscience in all secretis of
ye scripture necessare to be knawin for ane christian ma^nis saluatioun, and
al other doutis concerning faith and religioun: vtherwayis, to oppin ane plane
port till al errouris quhilkis euir hes been sen ye incarnatio^n of Jesus christ,
and every man to tak quhat opinio^n he plesis, leua^d in perpetual debait, and
co^trauersie for the faith.

THE TENT CHAPITRE.
TO Give the redare ferther persuasion off this co^clusio^n above rehersit, be
ye quhilk is maid manifest the secund part of ye argument, quhilk was. Gyf the
generale Counsalis representis the universal kirk of god or not? Now will we
answeir to the third part of ye argument, quhare questioun is, gyf their life
was godly quhilkis co^uenit in gn^ral consalis, as were the lives of ye
apostlis or not? Trewly will we considder all the gn^rall consalis, quhilkis hes
been fra ye first to ye last, we sal euir find, yt they were ye may godly,
and best learnit me^ in ye world for y^ time. It is not unknown to me, how ye
sum obiectis to this, murmuryng unjustly, that their deliberationis, and
interpretationis of scripturis declaris the co^trar. To the quhilk god wylling
we sall answeir in the awin place. Nochtheles, for co^sidderation of this
present purpose albeit yt thays quha co^uenit in generale co^salis had been
dicius (as thai were not) it argume^tis not yt their vice did dirogatioun to
their authority, because ye almychtie GOD wirkis not with man in authority in
respect of his persoun, quhilk beris authority, bot rather to declare his awin
infinite power, and gudnes in respect of the co^gregatioun co^mittit to man in
authority. Ioha. 11.
As be exempyl, we reid yt Cayphas, (quha was als wick it ane minister as hes
been in the kirk of GOD sen his time, or of before) spak true prophefie: and
(as ye text sayis) not of him self, bot because he was chief priest of that eir.

Mark good redare, how wo^nderfullie GOD, wirkis with authority in manner
foresaid. The text sayis planelie that he spak prophecy (quhilk is the gift of
GOD) nocht of him self, 1 Cor. 12
as the scripture wald say, nocht in respect of any gudnes that was in him, bot
because he was chief priest of yat eir, as the scripture wald say, Ioha. 11.
in respect of his authority quhilk he had of god: quhareby it may be persauit
how wounderfullie god wirkis oftymes be ane wickit istrume^t being in
authority, as may stand to the weill of ye co^gregatioun co^mittit to his
cure, and to the great magnificence, praise, and glore off him quha is
omnipotent.

Als it is wryttin of the three wise me^ yat come fra ye orient, say and, Math.
2.
quha it is he quhilk is borne king of Iowis? off the quhilk Herod quha was
king being afrayit, and all the Cietie of Hieiusalem with him, co^uenit ye
pricipalis of the preistis, and sperit at them, quhare Christ should be borne?
that a^swerit, and said, i^ Bethleem Jude. Mark good redare, how that this
infidele prince Herod paste be ane ordour, and co^uenit the principalis of ye
prestis to cearse, and know, quhare Christ sulde be borne, and they beand
co^uenit, how GOD wrocht with them in authority sua yat they trewlie
interpretit ye scripture of God, and answerit Herod according to the
scripturis: Nocht with standing yt the intentioun of him quhilk sperit ye
questio^n was ungodly (as the process of the Euangell planelie declaris) and
they mekle mair ungodly quhilkis were in authority quhame at he sperit his
questioun and doubt. Lord God, ar they not mekle mair ignorant, and imperfect,
nor was this wickit Prince, quhilkis wylfullie co^tempnis to speir, and ressaue
the knawlege of goddis wourd at the ministeris of the new law, conform to the
doctrine of ye kirk, bot with great misordour, and imperfection, seikis ye
knawlege of goddis wourd at men cumand but Authority, Ioha. 10.
nocht knawande quharefra they cu^, nor be quhat ordour. To give ye sufficrent
persuasioun, that vice dois not dirogat to authoritic, thou sall co^sidder the
wordis of our saiueour spekand to his Apostlis o^ this manner: ow twelf have I
chosin, Ioha. 6.
and ane of ow is ane devil.

Mark good redare, y^ Judas was ane apostole, and ane devil, as the scripture
wald say, nocht with standing that the devil possessit ye heart of Judas to
betrais his Lord, and master, it the authority, and office remanit with him,
sua yt nane was chosin to be in his place quhil he was deid, as thou may
persaue be the actis Act. 1.
of the Apostlis. I believe their is na man will thynk, that euir their was ane
minister in the kirk of God sen the time of ye apostlis, quhais vicious life
did dirogatio^n to his authority, mair nor Judas. Als I trow suirlie their is
na christian man will thynk that y^ ministeris in the new law, quha co^uenit
in generale counsalis was sua vicius, or ignorant, (that thaye wernocht havyll
to do that thing quhilk ryndit to their office) as was Cayphas, and the
principales of the preistis, quha co^uenit at ye desire of Herod the wickit
king. Than may it justly be persuadit, and inferrit be sic testimonies of
scripturis, as ar above rehersit, that albeit ye ministeris of the new law,
quha co^uenit in generale counsalis, hade been vicious, (as they were not) it
their life did na dirogatioun to their authority, bot they mycht do in all
sortis quhilk ryndit to their office, specialic to discern yerycht under
standing of goddis word, fra the wrang, to the rest of ye me^bris of ye
co^gregatio^n co^mittit to their cure, takand vertew, power, and authority of
almychtie god, and not of thann selfis. As be exemple, quha doutis bot ane
wickit minister, may minister ye sacrame^tis, hauand als great effect to the
ressauar, as he were neuir sua godly? Because the sacrame^tis takis not effect
of ye minister, bot of god. Suadeclaratioun off materis doutsu^ concerning the
faith (quhilk we have euir had of ye generale co^nsalis) takis not effect
only of the ministeris of the new law, nor it authority, bot of God: and
that, specialie in respect of ye congregation co^mittit to their cure, and to
declare the power of him, quha is heid till all authority that cumis be ane
ordour, as efterwart mair largely salbe declarit.

To persuade this purpose till all me^ of natural judgment but learning, gyf
sua were, that vice did hinder, and dirogatioun till authority: their sulde
neuir man be assurit of any thing done be man in authority. For quhy, quha can
be sure gyf any man in authority is but syn or not? Eccle. 9. 1. Cor. 4
Give you wald have respect to him quha is author till al authority (quhilk is
almychtie God conform to the saying of y^ and postole, spek and on this manner,
al po were is of god) and nocht to man quhilk beris authority, you sal think it
na thing strainge, albeit a wick it minister do yat thig quhilk ryndis to his
office, as may stand to the weil of y^ congregatio^n co^mittit till his cure.
For quhy, albeit man be ye iustrume^t, GOD is the principal wyrkar, and it
quhilk is done be man in authority, takis nocht effect of man only, bot of
God principalie 2. Cor. 3. v. 5
wirk-and be man. Thairfore sayis the apostole, Romans 13. v. 2
he that resystis to the hiear power, he resystis unto God, and wirk is ye
thing quhilk is his awin damynatioun. Treuth it is, to do that thing quhilk
aptenis to his awin singular weill, it may be, yt he quha is in authority
want the grace of god to ye time that he know his offense, and cum to repen
tance: as, albeit Cayphas had the spreit of GOD to speik prophecy, quhilk was
to the verity, and weill of the co^gregatioun co^mittit till his cure:
Nochtheles, he had not the gift of the haly gaist to do that thing quhilk
ryndit to his awin saluatioun, because of his induritnes but repentance,
refusand the grace of God wylfullie, quhilk was reddye to him, and all man.

For conclutioun, to give the superfluus persuasioun, that vice dois nocht
hinder, nor dirogatioun till authority: chow sall mark the wordis of our
Salueour spekyng on this manner, In the Mat. 23.
Chyir of Moses sittis Scribes, and Phariseis, quhatsumeuir thing they bid ow
do, do it, bot do nocht as they do: Because they bid do, and dois nocht. Off
this text it may weill be persauit, that god will obedience till man in
authority (in doing yat thing quhilk ryndis till his office) albeit his life
were neuir sua vicius.

THE ALEVINT CHAPITRE.
IT IS not unknown to me y^ harbor, and co^mo^n sayingis of me^ vnlearnit,
spekand on this manner, Quhat and ye hiear poweris command ws ye thing quhilk may
not stand with ye word of GOD? we aucht rather Actu. 5.
obey God nor man. for co^sideratioun off their sayngis, the Authority that we
principallic speik of, for this present purpose, is, of ye authority of the
general counsalis, quha assuritlic hes euir declarit all materis doutsu^
concerning ye faith trewlie conform to go dis word: as efterwart mair cleitlie
save persauit. And as to materis plane, I belief surely, their was neuir
authority quhilk come be ane ordour (beand christin men) yt conma^dit any
thing contrare the command of GOD. And give they had sua done, they wet na
wayis to be obeyit: As be exempyll, gyf any man in authority walde command the
thing quhilk were express aganis the ten co^mande me^tis, or any article off
our believe, we aucht and should na wayis obey thaim: because it were agais god
manifestly knawin till all christin me^. Bot as to materis doutsu^ having
apperance for both the partis, quhilkes ar above thy knawlege, thou aucht to
ressaue the ingenie^t of the kirk without questioun, or ressonyng, specialie
anent the sacramentis, and all other misteryis necessare to be knawin for ane
Christin mannis Saluatioun.

Eeue thou will say, quhat and ye generale consalis hatre gettin ws ane other
declaratio^n of y^ sarrame^tis nor may stand with the word of GOD? Mark (good
redare) the proud ignorance, and great arrogance of yis saying, for quhy, may
it not justly be inferrit, yt he quhilk fyndis falt with it that is done be the
generale co^nsalis, reknis him self of gretar knawlege, and to have gretar gift
of the haly gaist takand gretare authority on him self nor the hale kirk of
God? quhilk is repugnant to the word of god expreslie, and till al ordour. For
will thou luke the scripture all throw thou sall neuir fyud, yat euir it was
lesum to the rest of ye me^bris of ye co^gregatioun, to find falt, or argoun in
the co^trar of that thing quhilk was done be the speciale member of ye
co^gregatioun appoyntit be God to interpreit or decerne upon materis doutsum
concerning the law. Thairfore, it was expreflie co^mandit under the pane of
deith, Deu 17.
that the chosin people of God sulde ressaue ye understanding of ye law
(quhe^su^euir questioun raise for the samyn) conform to the judgment of the
preistis of the Trybe of Leui and him quhilk was chief priest, without resso nyng
in the co^trar. Treuth it is, the preistis of ye trybe of Leui, and als the
ministeris of the new law, quha hes co^uenit in generale counsalis, were bound
till Interpreit the Scripture conform to the word of God, quhilk they euir
did assuritlie, nocht of them self, bot of god quhaeuir wirk is with authorite,
as said is. And alwayis god judge to ye hiear poweris (in doiyng y^ thing yt
tyndis to their office) and na private noumer of me^, how godly, or weill
lernit y^ euir they be, and ye subiectis mo^ euir stand at it quhilk is done be
ye hiear poweris (being christin me^ cu^and to authority be ane ordour) aye,
and quhill, the samyn be reducit be sufficient ordour, specially in sic
thyngis as ar above their knawlegs, because in the menetyme ye hiear poweris
beris their burding, and it is ^a way is the burding of ye subiectis to cearse
out ye secretis of goddis word, Heb 1.17.
bot to tak instructio^n of sic as god hes apoyntit abo^e thaim, as I schew ye
of before. Give thou, or any private noumer of me^ will say yt e have the plane
scripture for ow? they quha co^uenit in generale co^nsalis will say (and yat
trewlie) yt ye scripture is mekle mair plane for yame. And als they have
authority of god to decerne on materis doutsum concerning the law, quhilk na
private noumer of me^ hes, as ye experience hes euir techeit ws conform to
goddis word. Attour, quhat sais you in yt part, bot yt al me^ quhilk e^^ hes
been geui^ till error said before ye? For will you co^si^der al ye gn^rale
consalis quhilkes euir hes been fra ye first to the last, you sall euir find su^
seditius me^ yt was excellently learnit, beand of ye contrar opinioun, quhilk
said they had ye plane scripture for them, takand ye scripture euir to be
their judge, and that ye consalts errit. Be their meanis you sall bring and renew
alye erroures yt euir hes been co^dempnit sen the time of ye Apost lis to their
dayis in disputation, and constrane new ordout to be taken of the samyn, quhilk
were euirlastyng confusioun to be in the kirk of GOD.

Tharefore will we conclude conform to ye wordis of ye Euangell, sen they quha
co^uenis in generale counsalis occupyis ye place, and Chyir of Moses be
office, and authority, specialite to declare the rycht ordour in ministratioun
of ye sa crame^tis and to discern the rycht understanding of goddis word fra
ye wrang, for quietness of ye co^gregatioun co^mittit to their cure, it is ye
dewitie of all the rest of the me^bris to obey that thing quhilk me^ in
authority co^mandis, as plesis god to steir up their hartis to give
declaratio^n on materis doutsum concerning ye understanding of ye law, to the
quhilkes god is the only judge. And is nocht lesum to the subiectis, under ye
pretense of the auanceme^t of goddis word, allegeand ye seripture to be judge,
to serk ane liberty to their lustis and heresyis, makand plane rebellioun till
authority. For I dar baldlye say, luke the scripturis althrow, thou sall
neuirfynd, that it hes been lesu^ to ye subiectis to find falt, or correct it
quhilk was done be the hiear poweris cu^and till authority be ane ordour,
specially in doing that thing quhilk ryndit to their office. Now sall thou
co^sidder, how impropitlie, and falsely, me^ geuin till opinioun in their day
is, thrawis ye scripture contrar the godly menyng of the samyn, agams the
kirk. Actu. 5.
As be exempyll. It is wryttin in ye actis of the Apostoles in this manner,

We aucht till obey God rather than man. Thou sall mark (good redare) quha
spak thit wordis first. Secundlie, to quhame thai were spokin. Thridlie, for
quhat cause. And it, salve easy till persaue, give they be propirlie allegit, or
nocht. The first quhilk said their wordis was ye chief Apostole Peter with the
rest of the Apostlis. Thapwer spokin to the hie priest, and the rest of his
cumpanye. The cause, was that the hie preiste with the rest, co^mandit that in na
way the Apostolis sulde teache in the name of Jesus Christ. Thus sall thou
consider, that they quha gave ye command, beleuit nocht in Jesus Christ, nor
his Eua^gell, nor hade authority to command the Apostolis at that time.
Atrour, it quhilk they co^mandit, was express ag nus the Euangell manifestly
knawin to the apoitolis. Tharefore iustlic, and propirlie said the Apostoics,
Acts. ^^
God should be rather obey it than man. Be the contrar, they quha co^uems in
generale counsalis, co^fessis the Euangell to be the true word of God, and ar
christian men hauand authority of Jesus Christ, quha is Ephe. 1. Coloss 1.
heid to his kirk. And als, althe scripturis quhilkis euir they have declarit,
orexponit, hes diverse vtheris places of scripturis geuand thaim just occasio^n
conform to goddis word till interpreit the secretis of the samyn, as they
have done. Ouharfore it may weill be persauit, how im propirlie, falstie, and
ungodly, me geui^ till opinion i their dayis, applyis, and thrawis y^ scripture
contrar y^ kirk of god, quhilk was propirlie allegit, and applyit be ye
Apostolis contrar ye Iowis. Wald God me^ vnlearnit persauit, how wyckit me^ in
their dayis apply is money diverse places of scrip turis, as you may cleirlye
persaue be this scripture abone rehersit, geuand thaim occasioun of alkynd of
wickitnes, specialie of dissobedie^ce to their htear poweris. Off all ye vices
yt euir thou sall reid punischeit be God, thou sall find two in speciale. Ane
is, the dissobedience of the subiectis, the other, ye necligence of thaim quha
ar in authority, quhilk is do is not their dett, and dewtie to their subiectis
conform to their vocatio^n: Throw ye quhilk they ar punissit diverse manner of
wayis. Ane n speciale is that oftymes because ye hiear poweris and magistratis
dissimulis ouir mekle with ye faltis of the subiectis, 1. Reg. 4
and als geuis yame nocht sufficient instructioun, first to know their det, and
dewtie to almychtie god, thairefter to their magistratis: god permittis and
sufferis ye subiectis to rebel, and be dissobedient to the lawis and command
ime^tis off of the hiear poweris, takand the place of authority mysordourlie
on them selfis, quhilk is ane of ye creuell punischeme^tis yt may cu^ to all
quhilkis ar in authority. The exempyll is sua familiar in diverse partis of the
world, yt we mister not to tak pain, nor be curious in seikyng of ye samyn. And
because ye subiectis seikis not reformatioun of ye magistratis, conform to ye
will, and mind of ye lord, quhilk were after my judgment, to call upon god ve
contineuall prayer, be resso^n thai are not certane bot wickitnes desitis sic
unworthy heidis to regne abone thaim) almychtie God will provide sic rewlaris as
will bring them to ye knawlege of god, Tob. 34
and them self (perchance) fer by their appetyte, Osee. 13
albeit it may be to their great weill at lenth. Off this we have diverse
exemplis in scripture, ane in speciale will we call to rememberance, quhare
almychtie God tuke creuell vengeance, and punischeme^t for vsurpatio^n of
authority and dissobedience. We reid of three men, ane was callit Chore, Number.
10
the other Dathan, and the third Abyron, and for their dsurpyng of authority
and dissobediece to Moses, and Aaron, (being chief rewlaris to ye chosin people
of God) the earth oppiunit, and they were swellytt, body and saul perperualie to
the hell,

Thairfore as all good christian men wald avoid ye everlasting wraith of
almychtie God, obey ye hiear poweris in all thing done be thaim, quhilk is done
be ane ordour, conform to their us catio^n. Roma. 15^
And lat na subiectis make party be perswasioun of private men cu^and but
authority: quhilk was neuir vnpunischeit be almychtie God, specialie to mel i^
curious ressoning of materis obscure, concerning ye faith: sick as the kirk
alreddy hes taken ordour in to, quhilk is the only judge: and to be iugeit be
na man in earth, bot be god allanerlie, Hist. ceel Lib. 10. capi. 30
as said ye godly imperour Constantine, conform to goddis word and all
reasoun. For give that thing be brocht in disputatio^n, quhilk is done be the
hiear poweris conform to their vocatioun, at the desire of pryuate men: than
sall the world leave in perpetuale debait and contrauersie.

THE TVELFT CHAPITRE
Seu we have had just occasio^n (conform to goddis word and all ressoun) in ye
chapitre above rehersit, na wayis to have dout of yt thing, quhilk hes been
done be the kirk, in respect of their life, quha co^uenit in general co^salis.
Now will we cu^ to ye ferde part of ye argument, quhare question is: gyf their
lawis and co^stitutionis ar conform to goddis word or not? For understanding
of the samyn you sal co^sidder, that their is two extremiteis now rynga^d in the
world. Sum men ar sua fer geuin till superstitio^n, that give any man speik ane
word aganis their indurit custum, e perchance albeit it be little or na thing
aggreable with the word of god, bot croppin in the kirk be ane abuse rather
tha^ be ane ordour, fra hand they sall estime that man ane heretic. Be the
co^trar their is sum sua rasche of judgment, that nocht allanerlie they will
cry out on abuse and superstio^n, bot misordourlie will they condempnne al
manner of thing that euir hes been vsit or appoyntit be ye kirk fra ye
beginning. Betuix their two extremiteis give it plesit GOD that the myddis sulde
cum forth: apperandlie it were ane great ease, and ane great occasioun of quietness
to the hale Congregatioun. To cum to the myddis (after my sobir judgment) ye
nerrest way were to esteem first the command and law of the Lord (quhilk hes
procedit of God allanerlie) abufe all thing. The secundr, to regard the
co^stitutionis of the kirk, as constitutionis of men.

Bot nocht allanerlie as constitutioms of men, bot as constitutionis procedyng
of GOD mediatlie (as I wald say be the wirkyng of God be man in authority)
quhilkis aucht and should be obeyit, nocht allanerlie (as sayis ye Apostole) Romans
13.
for fear of man, bot als for fear of God: nocht in compair of the word of
God, bot to be regardit as the co^mandime^tis of the true ministeris, and
organis off almychtie God sterit up be the spirit of God, difpona^d every good
christin man to be ye mair able to keip ye law of God. Heir will we schortlie
answer to the unjust murmur of diverse men spek and aganis ye kirk on this
manner, saying yt ye kirk punissis me^ mair creuellie for transgressio^n of
their law (as it were heresy) nor for the trang ressioun of ye law of God,
quhareby it may be persauit that the Kirk preferris their law to the law of
GOD. For consideratioun of this purpose, thou sall understand, that man is
nocht puniste to the rigor for tra^sgression of the law of ye kirk, bot for
disso bedience, and the indurit opinioun qu^^lk he consauis thairester, thynk
and that he dois na offense in doing of the samyn; quhilk but dout is heresy
expres aganis the word of God: as sayis the Apostole, Roma. 13.
he that resystis the hiear power, he resystis unto God, and wirkis the thing
quhilk is his awin dampnatioun. Give ane man transgres the command of GOD, he
grantis him self to have done wra^g. Bot give any man wald be i^durit, saying,
it were na syn to transgress the law of GOD, trewly he aucht, and sulde be
punissit as ane heretic. Sua it is ye opinioun with pertinacitie, and
induritnes, that makis the heresy (quhair upon the punischement followis) and
not ye nature of the deid. For, nocht all syn is heresy, bot al heresy is
syn. And to the effect that thou may perfectly know, that the kirk na wayis
regardis, nor estimes their law, in co^pair of the law of God: it is lesu^ in
time of necessity to tra^sgres ye law of the kirk without syn, or punischeme^t:
quhilk was nev permittit be the kirk towart the law of god, for any manner of
necessity. Sum murmouris, saying, yt ye kirk offe^dis, co^mandi^g their law to
be kepit under pain of deidlie syn. Trewly albeit the kirk make the law, it is
GOD quha all reddy hes declarit the brekyng thairof, syn: nocht be nature of
the deid for the may part, (as I schew the off before) bot be ressoun of
dissobedience to ye hiear poweris: Specialie in trang ressioun of sic
co^stitutionis as geuis occasioun to me^ to be the mair habyll to keip the
command of god, and is to y^ weill of the hale co^gregatioun co^mittit to
their cure, as we reid in diverse partis of the scripture creuell punischeme^t
following for dissobedience, as I schew the of before of Chore, Dathan, and
Abiron. Number 16.
According to this purpose wrytis ye Apostole on this manner, Brether, stand e
fast, and keip the traditionis 2 These. 2 Actu. 15.
quhilkis e have learnit older be our precheing or be our Epistole. Now will we
return to our purpose: quhare co^nderatioun is to be had, how the law is and
co^stitutionis of the kirk disponis al christin man to be the mair hable to
keip the law of God, and is nocht comparit (co^ form to the godly menyng of
ye kirk) to ye word of God. As be exempyll, we will compair the wourde of GOD
to the wine arde: and the co^mande of the kirk and al other hieare power, to yt
dyik or closure of the wine ard. Than sall thou understand, that the dike is
not ordanif for the self, bot to the effect yat the wild beistis tramp not
down the tender branchis of the wine: Swa the co^man dime^tis of the kirk and
al other hiear poweris ar nocht allanerlie ordanit for them self, bot rather
to give me^ occasio^n to be the mait habyl to keip the command of GOD. Thus, ar
they in error and extremity, quha wald persuade ye ordinance of ye kirk to be
taken away: For than should goddis word be abusit, as gyff the closure of ye wine
arde be castin down, than sulde the wild beistis distroye and deuore the
tender wine branchis. Off this rigorus ingeme^t (mouit perchance on zele Romans
10.
but know lege as sayis ye apostole) their is money in their dayis beleuyng till
awance ye glore of god, quhilkes oppinnis ane plane port till all kind of
misordour incontrar ye command of God: as but dout, gyt thou will tak away y^
ordinancis of the hiear poweris, and lawis of the kirk: quhilkis ye time hes
euir techeit ws? and nocht allanerlie the lawis, bot tak away ye ceremonies, with
process of time yt people in the world sulde foret, their were ane God. For be the
outwart ceremonies we are brocht to ye mair perfect knawlege of god, conform to
ye doctrine of all men of godly learning. Treuth it is, give me^ leuit
conform to the law of God: the law of the kirk, and all other lawis, and
ceremonies mycht be the better sparit. As give their were na wild beistis to
trampe down the wine arde, the dyik were the les necessare. Perchance thou will
murmour, and say, that under the color off the co^stitutionis of the kirk,
their is growin sic abusioun, that goddis word is sclanderit, and abusit.
Albeit yat were true, it is nocht cause to tak awayane good co^stitutioun, for
ane wrang abusioun: Be ressoun me^nis maneris should be thrawin to the law, the
law sulde nocht be thrawin to me^nis maneris. For quhat is mair precius nor is
ye law of GOD? and it it is daily brokin, and abusit. Als thou may see, that
of all Heresyis quhilkis euir hes been, for the maiste part, men hes taken
deeasioun of the Scripture. Nochtheles ye falt was not in the Scripture, bot in
their awin peruerste mind, and laik of good doctrine: as in cais throw
necligence of the gardnare their enterit diverse wild beistis in the arde, and
under thee vmbre of the dyik they make their Dennis, and Cauernis: and
thairefter cum out and deuore and tramp down the tender wine brancheis: the
dyik hes nocht the wit, bot the Gardnare quhilk was sua necligent. This will
thou considder all the constitutionis quhilkis euit were maid be ye kirk, having
considderatioun^ of the time, and the occasie^n quharefore they were maid: thou
sall find them aggreabyll with Goddis word. Than sal thou euir persaue the
falt principalie to be in them to quhame it appertenis of their vocation to be
Instructaris of the people, and nocht in the ordinances of the kirk.

Perchance thou will say, that their is su^ constitutionis quhilkis were
tollerabyll and convenient for the time, and now ye time hes wrocht suayat,
they ar improffitabyll. Trewlie I thynk that to be verray true of sum:
Nochtheles every man quhilk persauis the falt aucht not to be ane correctare of
the samyn: Bot sulde complane to yt hiear poweris, and in cais they be
necligent, desire of GOO to steir up ye hartis of yame to quhame it appertenis
of their vocatioun to be correctaris, and nocht to every private man to think
vpone his zele, yt he will correct it (quhilk is done be ane ordour)
misordourlie. For I dar baldlye say, their sal mair i^co^uementis follow o^ al
thingis quhilkes ar done by ane ordour, nor to thole the to ye time God provide
ane remeid be ane ordour. As be exempyll in cais their be ane part of ye dike
quhilk is co^sumit, and seruis of not, it every man quhilk passis by, should not
cast do^n ye place quhilk he thynkis falteis at his plesour, bot should (give his
zele be godly) schaw to ye gardnar to quham it appertems to correct the falt.
Thus, should christin me^ seik reformatioun (and that be ane ordour) and nocht
plane distructioun, and co^fusioun, as men dois in their dayis.

THE THRETTEINT CHAPITRE.
THEIR Is sum mair rigorus and rasche of judgment, affirmand planelie yat their
is diverse co^stitutionis of ye kirk, quhilkes may na way stand with yt word of
god, sick as is ye co^stitutioun of fasting at certane times apoyntit:
inuocatioun to be maid unto sanc it is: marriage forbiddin to preistis. Aganis the
quhilkes they thraw money testimonies of scriptu it is, specialie the wordis of
the Apostole, spek and on this manner, In 1. Tim. 4.
the latter time sum sall fall fra the faith, forbiddyng to mary commanding to
abstene fra metis quhilkis god hes creat. 1. Tim. 2
Their is bot ane mediator betuix god and man. To make the redare sufficiently
to understand, how their, and money vtheris scripturis ar falsely, and
impropirlie allegit, and interpretit aganis the kirk: presently, were euir
prolixt. And als their is diverse vtheris, quhilkis hes habunda^tlie tretit their
purposis in ye Inglis tongue: Notheles, to the effect that the redare may
persaue quhate iniuris they quhilkis fortifyis sick ertouris dois, both to the
scripture and the kirk of Good, I will speir ane questio^n at their me^,
quhilkis ar sua subtle in disputatioun, and sua profoundly leatnit in
scripturis, Doctores, and antiquiteis. The questioun is yis. Quhether gyf
Hierome, Augustine, Chrysostom, Origene, and Cypriane, with the rest off the
ancient fatheris, understood yir scripturis allegeit be them, or nocht? I
believe their be nane of them wylbe sua proud, as to esteem him self till have
the knawlege, and all their ancient fatheris to have been in ignorance. Than will
I speir, give their ancient fatheris understood their scripturis, and als their
knawlege, and zele, being als great to the treu setting forth of goddis word,
and glore, as that is ar, quha co^tempnis the ordinance and doctrine of the
kitk: quhat was the cause yt their ancient fatheris interpretit not yir
scripturis, and allegeit them not incontrar the co^stitutionis of the kirk, as
the vtheris dois? will they say that yir co^stitutionis ar croppin in ye kirk
sen their doctores dayis? the co^trar is manifestly knawin to all men quhilk
redis their werkis: Because thee fasting of Lentren, and vtheris obseruit it in
ye kirk, ves lang before their dayis. And als iudcatioun upon Sanctis is alwayis
aggreabyl with the doctrine of ye doctores. To veryfie ye samyn^ sal reid ye
ancient father Iero^e (quha was ane of y^ may excellent men of learning, and
good life yt euir was in the kirk of god sen the time of ye apostlis unto their
dayis) writing aganis ane abominable heretyke, callit Vigilantius (quha was i^
his time) and vtheris diverse quhilkis did mok, and scorn all invocation maid
till sanctis, and al vtheris ordinances in ye kirk, as vain me^ dois in their
dayis: quhareby you may persaue yt albeit their wickit opinioms be laitlie
reuewit, it is lang sen thai war first inue^tit be wickit me^, and justly
condempnit be ye godly fatheris: For it is sen the time of Hierome aleum
houndreth thretie sax eris. This ancient father in his buke agams Vigilantius
makis plane me^tio^ (confirma^d ye samyn trewlie be plane testimoneis of
scripture, and i^uincible ressonis) of muocatioun to be maid to sanctis,
affirmand their prayer mekle mair helplyke to me^ i^ earth, nor any other
mortale creaturis: quhilk he na way is did, disparit of godis m^cy, or yt
Christ was not a sufficient mediator for him and al me^, bot yt habo^nda^^e of

PERCHANCE Sum zelus man having piety of ye pur miserabyl pepyll will say

Ass knew mair nor thai both. Quhat wounder is it (quhen sick disagysit

and nocht all anerlie sick me^ ar croppin in ye kirk be meanis of sum wickit

quhare now be tyrrannie, and Avarice (for the maiste part) as it were theuis, or

sall wary the time that ever he had the brother, or sone, to quhame he bure sic
fleschelie and ungodly favor, as to steir him up to be ane gydare, and rewlar
of Christis floke, quhilk culde not gyde him self: The malheurius prince sall

desire of his subiectis: The miserable ignorant sierit up in authority sall
curs y^ time that euir he tuke on him y^ charge, quhilk was na wayis convenient
for him: in ye menetyme the pure simple people sua deirlie bocht be ye blude,
and deith off Jesus Christ our salueour miserably perischeis, the kirk is
sclanderit, God is dishonorit, all heresyis, wickitnes, and vice regnis. As to
me I will say na thing: bot humelie beseik the Lord God, till Illuminat ye hartis
of ye Magistratis (specialie quhilkis hes the authority to be the vpsteraris
of faithful ministeris in the kirk of God) to provide sick qualifeit Pastouris
as will do conform to their vocatioun, and as may be to ye glore of God,
exoneratioun of their awin consciences, and thairis quha prouidis thaim to have
authority, and government of Christis flok. And als I besei^ y^ leuyng god, yt
they quha ar all reddy ministeris in the kirk of God (specialie quha occupyis
thee place of the Apostoles be office and authority) call to remembrance the
Seueir and rigorus sentence off the Apostole, saying, 1. Cor. 9.
wa be unto me, and I preche not. Ezec. 34.
And als the wordis of ye Propheit saya^d, wa be unto ow Pastores of I sraell,
quhilkes feidis our seifis, and nocht my flok, Quharethrow the Pastores doing
their dett, and deuore to the simpyll people co^mittit to their cure, all
Hereseis, wyckitnes, and vice sulde be suppressit: the kirk vnsclanderit, and
GOD honourit, to quhame be glore for euir.

Beneuoleut redare, as it hes plesit God to give ws grace, we have answerit till
al ye partis of ye argument abo^e rehersit, and obiectit aganis our purpose.
First, quhare questioun was: gyf they quha co^uenit dewlie in generale consalis
had the spreit of god as had the Apostolis, or nocht? We schew the, that like
as it was necessare, yat ye kirk of GOD should endure, and be gouernit i^ faith
and religioun to the glore of god, on to the end of the world: Swa was it
necessare, that the gift of the haly gaist should endure, and remane with the chief
ministeris of the co^gregatioun (in doing yat thing quhilk ryndit to their
office) to ye end of ye world: conform to the wordis of our Salueour spekyng
unto his Apostolis in the personage of the rest of the ministeris of the kirk
of god quhilkis were to succeid in the apostolis place, say and, Ioh. 14.
I sall pray the father, and he sall give ow ane other co^forter, quhilk may
bide with ow for euir, the spreit of verity. Quhare questio^n was, gyf they
quhilkes co^uenit dewlie in general co^salis representit the universal kirk
of god, or not? I schew ye diverse ressonis perswadyng the samyn, co^firmand
them be plane testimony of scripture, insafer as they occupyit the place of ye
Apostoles be office, and authority: (to quhame it appertenith as ye speciale
member of the co^gregatioun appoyntit be God, to tak ourdour in all materis
doutsu^ concerning ye faith) and als their authority geuin thaim of god. was,
and is als sufficient in all sortis, as was y^ authority of ye preistis of ye
Trybe of Leui: It followis weil, quhatsumeuir thing was done be the saidis
ministeris for ye weill, and quietness of the co^gregatioun co^mittit to their
^ure, hade the samyn strenth, and effect, that it had quhilk was done be the
Apostolis, or the ministeris of ye auld law, for the quietness of ye
congregation co^mittit to their cure. I gave the likewise just occasion to be
out of doubt of that thing quhilk was done be them quha co^uenit n generale
counsalis, without respect of their lives: be resso^n, yat albeit they had been
vi^ius (as they were nocht) it their vice did na dirogationn, nor hinder to
their authority. Off this I gave the diverse ressonis co^firmand the samyn be
plane testimony off scripture, sick as was of Ioha. 14.
Cayphas, and the Man. 2.
pretstis in the auld law, quhilkis co^uenit at the desire of ye wickit king
Herod, quha, nocht wtstanding yat they were als wickit ministeris, as euir were
in the kirk of God: it their vice did na hinder, nor dirogatio^n to their
authority, bot they had ye grace of god to do yt thing, quhilk ryndit to their
office. As towart the lawis, and co^stitutionis maid be the kirk: confer them
with the scripture (quha plesis) treulie understand, conform to the
interpretation of ye ancient Fatheris, hauand consideration of the occasionis,
and circumstances of ye time: I dar baldlie say (conform to the doctrine of
me^ of godly learning) they salbe fundin aggreabyll with goddis word, disponand
every christian man to be the mair habyll to keip the law of God. Thus hes you
just occasioun conform to the scripture of almychtie GOD, ressoun, and
authority, to be satifeit assuritlie in all poyntis of ye argument above
rehersit: nocht doutyng bot ye gentyl redare will tak in fauounres, albeit we
have been prolirt in doing the samyn, be ressoun, that nocht only we answerit
formalie to the four principal heidis of the argument, bot als to diverse
vtheris doutis, co^moun sayngis, and opinionis quhair with me^ vnlearnit (for ye
may part) ar abusit in yir unhappy dayis, And now (conform to our promeis)
be the grace of God will we praceid on vtheris questionis mouit in the contrar
of our purpose.

THE FYFTENT CHAPITRE.
HEIR After followis ane argument mouit incontrar our purpose on yis man^.
Quhairsu^euir ye spreit of God is, their is treuth and verytie without repugna^ce
or contrariety. Their hes been diverse generale co^salis repugnant ane unto ane
other, sua yt ane hes conde^pnit yat, quhilk ane other hes approuin. Tharefore
it followis yt ye gn^rale consalis hes not had ye spreit of god, nor ar ye
speciale member off ye congregation appoyntit be god to tas ordour i^ materis
of debait conretni^g faith. For understanding of yis purpose, you salesidder
quhen ye misteris in ye new law conuenit i^ gn^ral consalis, their was twahedis
i^ special quhair of thai tretit: Ane was to tak ordoure in materis concerning
religioun, ane other to tak ordour in materis concerning faith. I call materis
concerning religio^n, ceremonies, ^^u^^^ ordinances or lawis maid be the kirk,
geua^d christin me^ occasioun (as I schew the of before) to be the mair habyll
to keip the law of god. I call materis concerning faith, interpretatioun of ye
word of GOD, specialie that is necessare to be knawin, and vsit for ane
christian ma^nis salvation, as ar ye sacrame^tis. As towart materis concerning
religioun, trewlie their hes been diverse generale co^nsalis quhilkis hes maid
lawis and ceremonies, mouit be the occasioun of the time, and co^ditioun of the
people co^mittit to their cure, quhilkis, as ye time alterit, and co^ditionis of
the people: sua was it thocht expedient be the kirk to A^^^. 15.
alter sum lawis and ceremonyis, quhilk argume^tis na imperfection of ye
generale co^nsalis. For quhy, almychtie god (quha is and euir was patron of all
perfectioun) maid diverse lawis, and ceremonyis, as his godly wisdom and
providence thocht expedient to his chosin people for the time, quhilkis eferwart
were alterit, Actu. 15.
cheangit, and ceissit as the occatioun seruit, as thou may cleirlie persane
both in ye auld testament, and new. Swa thou may persaue yt it argume^tis na
imperfectioun, the alteratio^n of Lawis according to the diversity of time,
and condition of ye people. As towart materis concerni^g faith, luke all the
general counsalis fra the first to ye last, yt sall neuir find yat euir ane
hes exponit ane restimonye of scripture necessare to be knawin for ane
christian ma^nis saluatio^n, quhilk ane other hes exponit co^trariustie: or it
diffinit any thing concerning faith, quhilk hes been co^dempnit, correctit, or
repreuit be ane other. Treuth it is, their was ane co^uentio^n of heretikis,
quha co^uenit aganis the godly counsale Nicene, to defend the error of
Arrius, quhilk was neuir estemit worthy thee name of ane generale co^nsale,
because it was not dewlie co^uenit. For quhy, Liberius with the rest off the
godly Byschoppis (to quhame in speciale it appertenit to tak ordour in all
materis concerning the faith) planelie ganestude this wickit co^uentioun,
quhilk was haldin at Armmiu^. Fccl hist Lib 10. Cap 1.21.
And als their was money of ye byschoppis quhilkis were conuenit in yis wickit
co^uentio^n, quha retreatit their awin deliberatioun, quhilk was neuir done be
ye generale co^salis dewlie co^uenit. Their hes been diverse vtheris
co^uentionis of heretikis (quhilkes heir to rehers were over prolixt) and hes
euir been co^dempnit be the godly generale co^salis. Attouir their was ane
consale haldin in Aphric, quhareinto Cypriane with certane godly byschoppis
conuenit, Hist. ece. Lib. 7. Cap 1.2.
quhais opinioun for that present time was, that they quha were Baptizat be
heretikis should be baptizat agane. Notheles, their was ane general consale
quhilk correctit the samyn, because baptime takis not effect of the minister,
bot of god al lanerlie. This consale hald in in Aphrir, was bot ane prouinciale
co^sale, Libr 2. Cen. 10. D^^a^ist.
quhais deliberatioun ever in materis concerning faith (as sayis the ancient
father Augustine) is to be referrit to ye generale co^salis. Ils you sall
understand, yt the question tretit in this prouinciale consale was not towart
ye interpretation of scripture: For quhy, the scripture makis na me^tioun,
quhether gyf thai quhilkis ar baptizate be heretikis, ar to be baptizat agane
or not? Bot was ane question of opinio^n, quhairinto me^ in authority may
speik frelie (specialie haua^d appera^ce as thai had, mouit on godly zele
aganis heretykis) ay and quhill the generale consale had taken ordour
thairintyll. Thairfore this argument, and all other siclyke makis na dirogation
to the generale consalis: quha affuritlie in all materis pertenyng faith, neuir
errit nor variit.

Be the contrar, will you co^sidder the judgment and doctrine of all sic factius
and curious men, as disdanis to resaue of ye kirk, the true vnderstandig of the
misteriis of goddis word conform to ye doctrine of the samyn, and thou sall
easily persaue, that not allanerlie ar they repugnant, variant, and inco^
stant in materis concerning religioun: Bot likewise in materis concerning
faith. The exemplis ar familiar till all me^ quhilkis plesis to reid and confer
their werkis. The first in their dayis quhilk sterit up seditioun, refusand ye
judgment of ye kirk in materis concerning faith and religioun, was ane callit
Martine Luther: quha was ane Augustine freir, and la^g time thairefter maid an
mo^sterus marriage with ane Non. Ane other was callit Iohane Oecola^paudius
Almayne borne: quha was likewise ane rynnigat monk fra his religioun. Their two
perrellus patronis of irregulare religion ar als contrarius slkane to other in
declaration of diverse misteryis of the scriptures necessare to be knawin for all
christian me^nis salvation, as lycht to wyrknes. Amangis money diverse exemplis,
ane in speciale will we call to remembrance: Luther declaring ye wordis of our
salueour i^ ye latter supper, saya^d, In captiui tare Babilonica.
This is my body, exponis yaun to be said of ye verray natural body of our
salueour and na wayis to be spokin be ane similitude: and in yt, he is conform
to ye doctrine of ye kirk, and all the ancient fatheris of the samyn: Albeit
vtherwayis he is alluterlie repugnant thairto. Oecolampaudius be the plane
contrar exponis yir wordis of our salueur to be spokin be ane similitude, and
figure: quhairby he makis little, or na difference betuix this blyssit sacrament
and sacrifice, and ye sacrame^tis, and sacrifice of the Iowis. Zuynglius,
Melanchtone, Bucere, Bullinger, quha were men in their dayis quhilkis were chief
steraris up of sedition aganis the kirk (reid their werkis quha plesis) you sall
find thaim euir contrarius ama^gis thaim selfis, in materis concerning both
faith and religion. To verify ye samyn you sal reid ane tractiue set forth be
Melanchton, quha wrytis of the supper of the Lord inco^trar ye Anabaptistis:
quhare he dois afferme planelie ye reale presens of the blude and body of our
Salueour i^ ye blyssit sacrament of ye alter. Trac^t. de cena domi ni. contrae
Anabapti.
And als condempnis ye opinion of al sick as dois affirm ye wordis of our
salueour, saya^d This is my body, to be spokin be a metaphore, sunilitude, or
figute. Forther he sais planelie in ye sam tractiue, yt it is great
fuillhardines, to set forth any other doctrine concerning ye vnderstandig of
yis profo^nd mystery, nor sic as hes been approuin be ye kirk, of ald,
affirmand that it was euir the doctrine of ye kirk the Reale presens of the
precius body and blude of our Salueour to be in ye Sacrament of the alter. And
to appreue the samyn he callis to remembrance ye ancient fatheris of ye kirk,
sic as Cyrill, Cypriane, Chrysostom, Theophilact, and vtheris diverse. To ye
quhilk opinioun of Melanchton: Zuynglius, Bucere, Bullinger, ar alluterlie
contrarius. Luther after lange disputatioun quhilk was betuix him and
Oecolampadius, and lykwyse Bucere for ye understanding of yis mystery, wrait
diverse iniurius Epistolis inco^trar Bucere (quha was ane Apostat a blak freir)
and al quhilkis fauourit his opinion affirma^d thaim al to be heretics. They
wrait agane affirma^d Luther and al quhilkes fauourit his opinio^n to
beheretikis: as thou sall cleiclie persaue in ane Epistle quhilk Luther wrait
to ane call it Iohane Haruagius. Thairefter Bucere recantit his opinio^n and
come to the opinio^n of Luther. Attour, nocht only ar they variand in
declaratioun of the blyssit Sacrame^tis: bot likewise they differ in ye noumer
of them: Suin sayand, their is bot two, as did Luther, Su^yair is three, as
dois Melanchton i^ his buke callit his conmoun places. Swa yt their is na
certitude amangis them, nolder to wart the noumer of ye sacrame^tis, use, nor
effect, nor it in ye vnd^sta^dig and declaration of yame, specialie of yis
may excellent sacrament of ye alter, quhilk is a^^ of y^ may effectuus
sacrame^tis, quhareby Jesus Christ our salueour hes appoyntit ye fruct of his
passioun and deith, to be aplyit and rene^^t in all christin me^. Likewise they
ar different in diners vtheris miseryis of ye scripture. Luther in his wickit
werk quhilk he maid aganis fre wyi, is als repugnant to Melanchton in his
co^moun places, and in his werk callit De Anima, speka^d of fre will: In disput.
Lipsica.
as blak toquhyte. Luther affirmand purgatory, is repugna^d to al ye rest.
Attour, their seditious men above rehersit, quha vendicatis thaim selfis so have
greter knawlege nor Christis hale kirk, not onclie ar thai repugnant ane unto
ane vthe: rbot alsua it were ane mo^sterus fars to co^sidder, how co^trarius
thai ar planelie euerlikane to him self. Hes not Oecolampadius (quhais opinioun
men in their dayis praysis sua hichlie) alterit thryse? First he was of the
opinion of the kirk towart the understanding of the mystery of ye sacrament of
the altar, sua la^g as he remanit in religioun: Thairefter he was of ye opinion
of Luther: Last of all, he was of ye opinion of Beringarius: quha recantit his
error, and was ye first sterar up of ye sami^. How money hundredth places Luther
is co^trarius to him self, luke ye werk of Bunderius, callit Detcerio nugarum
lutheri, and Malleum Iohanis fabri, and thou sall easily persaue. Last of all
stert up ane callit Iohane Caluyne, ane french man borne, quha not allanerlie
is co^trarius to ye kirk of god, and all the ancient fatheris of the samyn: bot
als he is repugnant in materis concerning both faith and religioun, till al ye
rest of their factius me^ above rehersit, i^uentyng ane new factioun of his
awin, quharethrow he wald be thocht singular, (as he is in deid) for their hes
been bot few worcester (in all kind of wickit opinion) in ye hale world. And to ye
effect that the redare sall nocht thynk that this is said of dispyte to give
falls persuasioun, thou sall reid ane werk of Caluynnis quhilk he callis his
little buke of the supper of the Lord: Libel. de ce na domini.
quhare he rehersis ye great co^trauersie quhilk was ane langtyme betuir Luther,
Oecola^padius, Zuynglius, and Bucere for the understanding of ye sacrament of
the altar: and thou sal persaue yat he sayis planelie, yat Luther exponis this
mystery of the sacrament falsue, ad yat Oecolampadius, Zuynglius, and Bucere,
recheit nocht the hale treuth, and verity, towart the rycht understanding of
this sacrament. Thairefter he geuis his awin judgment, quhilk is contrarius to
al ye rest: affirmyng ye samyn but alder scripture or doctor. And thairfore, is
deir of ye rehersing, because it was euir misknawin to the kirk of god, and all
the ancient fatheris of the samyn. Marvel nocht (beneuolent redare) off yis
great variance of opinioun quhilk is and euir hes been ama^gis their seditius men
in their dayis: for this hes been euir ane famisliar falt to al heretykis,
quhilkis refusit the judgment of the kirk in declaratioun of the misteryis of
goddis word, as we reid of diverse sectis amangis ye Arrianis, Anabaptists,
Hist. eccl. Capi. 25. Libro. 10.
and Manacheis, ane, co^trarius to ane other. And not wtstanding of this great
variance of opinioun quhilk euit hes been amangis al heretykis in all aegis,
eris, and times: it their is ane graceles grace quhilk followis thaim al,
quhilk is, yat they aggre vniuersalie in ane opinion, to cry out with oppin
chaftes on ye halie consalis, cum as y^ Iowis cryit al with ane voce to crucify
Christ. Mat. 27 Ioha. 19.
And that, nocht without cause (as I schew the off before) for gyf the
declaratioun of goddis word, were ressauit conform to the interpretatioun of
the generale co^salis, (as they aucht and sulde be of ressoun) than sall na
private factius ma^nis opinion nor vain glore, (quha wald be thocht singular
i^his awi^ opinion) have place. And notheles that the fructe of their doctrine
declaris sufficietlie ye great imperfectioun of their believe and opinioun, it
pairtlie but schame will they allege, that the true faith and kirk is with them
only. Be the co^ trar, all men of godly learning hes euir co^stantlie
affirmit, that the ancient fatheris (quha co^uenit dewlie in generale co^salis)
had euir the true faith, conform to the doctrine of the Apostlis discending
fra time to time, representand the universal kirk of God and congregatioun.

And als thaye did big firmelye on that sure roke and fundament, that Jesus
Christ our salueour is the sone of God, secunde person in divinity, redemar
of the world. Now will I appele ye co^seience of the ineffectionat and godly
redare diligently to considder: quhilk of their two biggis may trewlye, and
maiste Godly coforme to Goddis word on this fundament? quhair neuir two of
their seditius me^ agreis togidder, nor it ane of thaim with him self: nocht
ouelie in materis concerunyng religioun, bot als in materis concerning faith?
or yt ancient fatheris (being dewlie conuenit in generale co^salis) quha neuir
variit, nor were repugua^t nolder i^ matis concerning faith, nor religioun? Give
their be any man offendir with their saying is? lat him mark ye text or place of
scripture necessare to be knawi for ane christian ma^nis saluatw, quhairsu
neuir ane generale co^sale dewlie co^uenand is repugnant ane unto ane other i^
declaration of the samyn, quhilk I am sure he sall neuir find, specialie in
declaration of ye misteriis of ye blyssit Sacramentis.

THE SEXTENT CHAPITRE.
NOW will I speir ane question at any vain man in yir dayis, quhailk refusis
ye doctrine and judgment pof the kirk in declaratioun of the misteriis of the
Scripture, and is led with every wynd, fallin precheair, and doctrine quhair
judgment will he follow? will thou follow Luther? Oecola^padius will sweir and
say, that thou art clean out of the way: For quhy, his doctry he is alluterlie
repugnant to the doctrine of Luther in declaratioun of diverse places of the
Scripture necessare to be knawin for ane christian mannis saluatioun, as I
schew the off before. Will thou follow Oecola^padius? Melanchton will say, thou
art led with the spreit off crrour: For quhy, In Lib. de cenae. Domini conra
Anabaptist.
luke Melanchton (quha plelis) in his werk abo^e rehersit, and als in his work
callit his commoun places, and thou sall persaue him fer different fra ye
opinion of Oecolampadins, Zuynglius, and Bucere, in declaration of ye Sacrament
of the altar, and money other purposis concerning both faith and religroun.
Melanch. In Locis Theo. Basil. anno. 1546. Impress.
Will thou follow Melanchton? Caluyne will say thou art not fast in the farth:
Because they differ towarte ye understanding of faith and workis, ather partiis
allegeand scripture assuritilie for thanim. Will you follow Caluyne? al ye rest
will sweir and say, yat thou art ane co^dempait heretyke: For quhy, he is
contrarius to all the rest, in materis concerning both faith and religion, as
I schew ye of before. Thus, give thou wylbe ane heretyke, as I wald say, give
thou will ma^teyne with pertinacitic, and induritues, and (...) opinion incontrar
goddis word and the kir^, quhame will thou follow? Will thou follow the
scripture only? thou art nocht abyll till explore and scik out the profunde
knawlege of ye misteriis of ye samyn, be thy awils private laubouris. Thairfore
vain man recant for schame, recant as thou luiffis the saluatioun of thy awin
saul, and return to the godly doctrine of the kirk, to quhame it appertenis
only (and that be the prouisioun of almy chtie God) to tak ordour in
declaratioun of all the misteriis off goddis word necessare to be knawin for
thy saluatioun, and all christian ma^nis: conform to the sayng of S. Libro.
2. contra domatist. ca. primo.
Augustine, affirmand ye authority of ye generale counsales, to be preferrit
to ye judgment of any ane perticulare Byschope, or ye co^sale of any ane
particulare regioun or country. Thairfore leave the judgment of their inconstant,
seditius private men and all vtheris quhilkis fauouris their factio^n, quha ar
to be rekuit (as said the apostolie) in the noumer of them that passie fra ws,
1. Ioh. 2.
bot they were nocht of ws, insafer as they ar deuidit fra the kirk of God in
materis concerning both faith and religio^n. It may be sperit, quhat was the
cause that thirseditius men above rehersit, were sua co^trarius amangisyame
selfis, and fell in sua great erroutes in declaraioun of the misieryis of the
scripture: For co^sidderatioun of this purpose, thou sall tak exemple be ye
Sone, quhilk furthschawis the way till all thing i^ earth: Nochtheles, gyf thou
will luke co^tincuallte in ye Sone, and not use it moderatlie, and temporatlie
as God and nature hes appoyntit: but doubt it sall make the blind, Swa curious
men (quha proudelie thynkis they will explore the knawlege of the scripture be
yare awin private laubouris, and will nocht according to the ordinance and
proursioun of God, moderatlie and temperatlie reid ye scriptures, ressauyng ye
understanding of ye misteryis of the samyn) as the kirk hes euir techeit them)
fallis in great erroures and ar maid blind in their faith. Thairfore said the
excellent clerk Erasme. In all materis difficile and obscure pertenand ye faith
he wald refuse his awin judgment, Epist. ad inferiores germany. ecclisiast.
and all other private mannis (how godly or weill learnit that euir he were) and
submit him self to ye judgment of the kirk. Attour, the godly docteres
approuin be ye kirk, red ye sam scriptures quhilkis their seditius men red, and
it they tuke contrarius iugementis of the samyn, as thou may persaue towart ye
understanding of ye wordis of the Apostole, saying, their sall cum in the
latter dayis quhilkis sall forbide Mariaige, 1. Tim. 4
and to abstain fra meatis quhilkis God hes creat: their is nane of ye
doctores (luke al their workis quha pleiis) takis occasioun of this pass of
scripture, or any other, to contempne ye ordinances of thee kirk, and now
diverse me^ quhilkis redis the samyn scripture, contempnis planelie ye
ordinances off the kirk, and fyndis after their rugeme^t that this text a^^ne
rehersit, and money vtheris, ar express ananis the ordinances of the kirk,
Quhat is the sause of this? bot that they reid nocht the scripiure hauand
siclyke godly mind and intentioun as had the ancient fatheris, quha euir red
the scripture, to give them occasion to suppres the desyris of the flesche:
and now men in their dayis redis the scripture (as ye experience daily techeis
ws) to se quhat places they may thraw to their awin appetit, by the godly
meinnyng of the samyng, makand this text of the Apostole, and diverse vtheris,
schetld and buklare to their lustis and heresiis. As be exempyll, thou seis be
experience yt the Soune will melt the waix, and hardin the clay. This cumis
nocht of the diversity of the nature of the Son, bot of the diversity of
the nature of tha thyngis quhairupon the Sone schynis. Swa this diversity of
opinioun proceadis of the diverse intentionis off men quhilk is redis ye
scripture, and nocht of the scripturis self. Thairfore we may be assurit,
quhasu^euir redis the scripture older to seik ye liberty of his flesche, or it
his awin glore (contempnande the ingement of the kirk towart the understanding
of ye samyn) he sal have sick proffeit be it (albeit he were of neuir swa great
learning) as hade the devil, Mat. 4.
quha familiarlie spak and ressonit with our Salueoure, and it the proffeit or
knawlege quhilk he had be ye samyn was little or na thing, bot passit away with
confussioun, frustrat of his pretense.

THE SEVINTENT CHAPITRE.
NOW Schortlie will we answeir to the rest of the obiectionis, and argume^tis
mouit in ye contrar of our purpose, sick as we have older red or hard. Sum
murmuris, saying, that the kirk is both party and judge. Trewlie it appertenis
to the kirk of GOD to be party till all wickit and ungodly doctrine,
specialie, quhilk rysis for the understanding of ye scripture, and to discern
quhilk is ye rycht understanding of ye samyn, as we have plane in scripture yt
ye apostlis was iugis to discern, gyf Circu^cisioun was necessare with Baptime:
Act. 1^.
and als they were party till al quhilkis did affirm cir cu^cisioun to be
necessare. Thairfore said ye apostole S. Paul: gyf Gala, 5.
e be circu^cidit Christ aualis ow nocht. Attour, we are certifut yt the godly
Byschope Athanasius, in speciale ganestude the wick it heresy of Arrius, Hist.
cee. Lib. 10. capi. 14.
with diverse vtheris godly fatheris: and it he and the rest were iuges quha
decernit on the samyn. Sua it makis na dirogatio^ to ye authority of the kirk,
yt the faithful ministeris of ye samyn be party till all ungodly doctrine:
and als judge thairupon, be ye quhilk ye verity may be maid patent to the hale
congregation.

Sum will object (and be ye menis seik ane color to defend the great variance
off opinioun quhilk is amangis seditius me^ in their dayis) saying, yt their was
diversity in opinioun amangis ye ald doctores approui^ be ye kirk, and als
amangis sum scolastick me^ laitlie sen the doctores time. This argument seruis
of nocht, for two ressonis. First ye doctores gaif their judgment in the
beginning before yt misteriis of ye scripture were maid pa te^t be ye kirk:
Epist. ad eccle. argentor.
Thairfor (as sais Erasme) their imperfectioun was to be borne with all, and als
quharesumeuir they vary, it is of materis (for ye may part) of opinion,
quhilkis are not expreslie contenit in ye scripture, bot as hes plesit god with
the time to steir up his kirk to tak ordour thairinto, sua yt all questioun,
debait, and schysme may be pacifyit in ye co^gte gatio^. Bot be the co^trar,
me^ geuin till opinion in their dayis, varyis for ye understanding of ye
scripturis necessare to be understand for all christian me^nis salvation:
specialie in sick purposis as the kirk alreddy hes taken sufficient ordour in
to, contempnand alluterlie the judgment of the kirk, preferrand their awin
private iugeme^tes to ye samyn, quhilk was neuir done be ye ancient fatheris,
nor nane vthetis scolastick wrytaris eft ye deliberatio^ of the kirk. Quharcfor
the similitude, and argument in defense of their euriositie and varia^ce,
seruis off nocht, as the diligent redare may persaue. Sum their is geuin till
opinioun, and they will admit ye judgment and deliberatioun of part of the
generale counsalis, and other part they will all uterlie cry out on: as
Melanchton, Bucere, Bullinger. Su^ time they clame to the authority of the
kirk, off the quhilk schortlie thou sall have exempyll. Su^ time thai contempne
ye authority of ye kirk. For co^syderation of this purpose ye redare sal
considder, yt all sick co^salis as hes condempnit any heresyis, quhilkis their
factius men are not wylling to mantayne: all sick they will admit, and authorize.

All co^nsalis quhilkes hes condempnit sick wickit heresyis as they ar wylling
to renew and fortify (albeit they were neuir sua godly) alwayis will thai
co^tempne. Nocht wtstanding yt ye authority of al ye generale consalis (dewlie
conuenit) is alyke, spe cialie to take ordour in materis concerning faith and
religioun, for the quietness of the co^gregatioun co^mittit to their cure. Quha
doutis bot Artius, Macedonius, Nestorius, and Eutices co^tempnit ye first four
generale co^salis, quhairin their heresyis were repellit, and justly
co^dempnit, allegea^d diverse pretendit seripturis, ressonis, and authoriteis
for them: like as me^ in their dayis iniustlie co^tempnis ye deliberatioun of
diverse godly gn^rale co^salis quhilkis hes proeedit incontrar ye wickit
heresyis quhilkis they ar wylling to renew and fortyfie. Thus do they detract
and repel ye authority of the kirk (to quhame it appertenis to discern the
true understanding of ye scripture fra ye wra^g) as they do repel ye
scripturis self. Dois not Luther repel S. Iamesepistole, and als ye Apocalipse
of S. Iohane, because their is diverse testimoniis of scripture contenit in
them, direct co^trar to his opinioun? And inlykewayis, sumtyme they repel ye
doctrine of the ancient fatheris, callit the doctores of the kirk. Sumtyme they
persuert, and thraw ye sayingis of ye doctores, persuadyng to me^ vnlermt, yt
their doctrine and the doctores doctrine ar alwayis agreabyll, of the quhilk I
will make ye redare quhilk is vnlernit to know ane m^uelous dissaitful craft,
mark aue secreit of heretykis.
quhilk is na little secreit ama^gis heretikis. It is familiar to the ancient
fatheris of the kirk, quhe^su^euir they write aganis any heresy quhilk was in
their time, to ressoun for both ye partis: thairefter thai conclude trewlie
conform to the scripture, and as ye kirk hes approuin: That part of the
argument ma^teanit be heretikis of la^g time bypast, quhilk factius me^ ar
wylling to renew in their dayis, (for their is few hereseis now in yir dayis bot
they have been condempnit of auld) fra hand apply they to foriifie their
purpose: and yus me^ vnlernit, persuadit that part of the argument quhilk
seruis for the opinioun of heretikis to be the propir sayingis of the Doctores,
(not wtstanding yt it is bot the opinioun of heretikis rehersit be the
doctores) nocht knawa^d yt manner for quhat purpose tha saying is were rehersit
be the doctores, nor it the contrar part of the argument nor conclusioun,
miserably ar dissauit, beleuand yt r^hers to be maid be the doctores, as
affirmyng that opinioun: and tha simple me^ ar nocht hable to confer the
doctores, to se give yt be true or not. Attour you sall understand, yt the
ancient fatheris maka^d me^tioun of diverse misteryis of ye scripture, sumtymes
spak with swa great reverence and fear, yt it is not easy to persaue their
iugeme^tes towart ye understanding of ye samyn. Su^tyme they declare their mind
mair planelie. The cause of yis was, (after ye judgment of learnit me^) that
the fatheris wald not diffyne on the profund misteryis of the scripture, unto
ye time the generale co^salis hade taken ordour thairinto. And als, their ar
diverse misteryis quhilkis were neuir brocht in dout in tha doctores dayis: lyk
as the misterye of the blyssit Sacrament of ye altar, quhilk was first brocht
in disputatioun be ane, callit Beringarius, Anno domini. 1051.
quhilk was sax hundredth eir and mair after ye time of Hierome, Ambrose, and
Augustyne, and money of the rest of ye ancient fatheris. Now sall thou
understand, that all sick places quhairinto ye doctores spak not planelie: they
places applyis the heretykis for their awin purpose, and swa affirms the
doctores to be for them all the way. All sick places quhairinto the doctores
mair planelie declaris their mind, they dissimule, and wynkis at them. And be
their meanis di^^aitfullie me^ geuin till opinioun dissauis y^ simpyl people,
quha is not hable to explore, and espy yis their wyckit craft and slycht. Ane
exemple will I give ye in special: S. Augustine (quha is ane of the may
excellent fatheris of the kirk) sumtyme spekand of ye Sacrament of the altar,
makis me^tioun only of the spirituale ma^ducatioun. Sumtyme planelye he makis
mentioun both of spirituale and reale ma^ducatioun of the samyn: quhairinto is
ye verray natural blude, and body of our salueour, to ye quhilk, propirlie
adoratioun is to be geuin, Psalm. 98.
specialie writing on the psalms, and diverse vtheris places. All sic places
quhairinto Augustine spekis of the spirituale ma^ducation only, diligently
do they mark, and peruerstlie apply for their awin purpose: All sic places
quhairi^to he plainly spekis both of spirituale and reale ma^ducation, me^
geuin till opinion in their dayis clenelie dois outrluke: and be their meanis
abuse thai me^ vnlearnit, quha ar nocht hable to seik ye fundame^t, persuading
falsely and dissaitfullie Augustine, and the rest of the fatheris to be for
their wickit opinioun.

Lord God (good redare) is not this ane m^uellus dissaitfull craft, quhilk al
ye world may se to be falls? For gyf the doctores sayngis (specialie in
declaration of ye sacramentis quhilkis ar sua necessare to the hale
congregation) had been co^ trarius to the doctrine of the kirk, how fortunat
it, yat Hierome, Augustine, and Ambrose, were euir reknit to be the may
excellent doctores approui^ be the kirk, aggreand with the doctrine of ye
samyn, specially in declaration of the blyssit sacrament of the altar? Were
all the fatheris quhilkis co^uenit in gn^rale consalis sen the time of their
doctores (quhilk is aleui^ hundredth eris syne and mair) sua ignorant, yt they
culde not persaue, gyf ye doctrine of their doctores, and ye rest, was
aggreabyll with ye doctrine of ye haly kirk or not? Quha is desirus to know
ferther, how factius me^ i^ yir dayis thrawis the godly doctrine of ye
doctores falsely to fortifye their hereseis, (specially incontrar the godly
doctrine of the kirk in declaratioun of ye misterye of the blyssit sacrament)
lat him reid ye Bischope of rochestaris excellent werk i^contrar Oecolampadius:
and their sall he abundantly persaue this intollerably dissaitfulnes
propirlie discouerit. Now may thou good redare persaue the gudnes of almychtie
God, (quha foresawe, that wickit men wald peruerit both doctores, and
scriptures by ye godly meaning of the samyn to their awin appetit, quharethrow
me^ vnlearnit, quhilkis ar nocht hable to confer the scripturis and ye
doctores, ar miserably diseeauit) quhilk hes apoyntit euir his kirk (quhilk
trewlie is representit be the generale counsalis dewlie conuenit) to be ane
assurit way for all me^ to be satifeit in all materis concerning faith and
religioun.

THE AVCHTENT CHAPITRE.
TO GEVE ye redare just persuasioun to considder, how necessare it is to lein
to the judgment of ye kirk i^ al materis concerning both faith and religioun:
you sall understand yat their is diverse thyngis quhilk we mon belief (give we be
faithful christian men) albeit they can nocht be prouin be express
testimonies of Scripture, bot techeit ws euir fra time to time, sen the time of
ye apostlis to yir dayis be ye kirk. As be exemple: Baptising of barnis as sais
S. Augustine likewise Origene, Contra do natist. lib. 4. Orige. in capi. 6. ad
Roma.
is ane traditio^n of ye apostolis, and is not expreslie contenit i^ ye
scripture. I believe gyf it had been in ye scripture, their ancient fatheris quha
bestowit al their time in co^tineuale redyng of ye samyn, wald have persauit it
als sone as any vtheris quhilk sayis ye contrar in their dayis. Melanchton in
his co^moun places likewise ascriues ye samyn to the tradition of ye apostlis,
and ye use of ye kirk, and sua dois Bullinger i^ his wickit werk dedicat to ye
king of Ingland. Ad Eduar dum. 6. Reg. ang.
Attour, is he to be estimate as ane christian man, quhilk walde deny (as did
Nestorius) ye blyssit virgin Marie to be ye mader of God and man? Trip. hist.
Liber. 12. Cap. 4.
And it it can not be prouin be erpres testimony of scripture. Is he not to be
^imit as ane heretic, quha walde deny the blyssit mother of Jesus Christ our
salueour to be ane per petuale vgine as did Heluidius? And it we half na plane
scripture for it. But doubt S. Hieron^ (quha was ane godly doctor euir
approuin be ye kirk) estimes him ane heretic: and for that errous in speciale,
of his ungodly iniuris aganis yt elect and chosin spous of ye halie gaist.
Attour, is he to be estunit ane christian man quha walde deny ane word of yir
propositionis followand? The father, the sone, ye haly gaist, ar three distinct
personis in ane godhed. The sone, secund person in divinity, is generate
without begyani^g without endi^g, equale with the father in divine nature. The haly
gaist pcedis of both, thride person in divinity, equale with the father and ye
sone: and it every thride word thairof is nocht expresiie centenit in ye
scripture: bot as the kirk hes techeit ws conform to ye scripture. Ferther, is
it not ane article of our believe, that our Salueour passit to the hell? And it
it is nocht easy to be prouin be plane testimonyis off Scripturis.

For conclusioun give any wickit man walde deny the Euangell of sanct Iohane to
be autentik scripture (as we reid of ane wickit heretyke, callit Marcion, quha
denyit diverse of ye Euangellis: Manacheus refusit al ye auld testament, Luther
now in our dayis repellis the Epistole of sanct James and ye Apocalipse of S.
Iohane,) be quhat meanis wald thou persuade to the co^gregatio^n, sick-sedicius
me^ to be heretikis, and their opinioun to be co^dampnable? Trewlie thou can
nocht preue the Euangell of S. Ihone to be autentyke scripture be other
scripturis: For quhy, their is na other scripture quhilk makis mention of it,
Hist.eccl. Libro. 3. Capi. 25.
because it was wryttin lang after all the rest of the scriptures. Attour their
is contenit in the said Eua^gell of sanct Iohane, quhilk is nocht co^tenit in
the rest: Sick as towart ye divine nature of our Salueour: The rasyng of
Lazarus fra deith to live: and that out Saiue our thryse ester other co^mendit
his floke to S. Peter, with vtheris diverse not able purposis. Will thou say, that
it is godly in the self, and thairfore sulde be reknit. as autentik scripture?
thy argument seruis of nocht: because nocht every godly thing quhilk is
wryttin sulde be reknit as autentik scripture. Will you say, that the spirit of
God techeis the inwartlye to believe yt the Eua^gell of S. Ihone, is autentik
scripture, and the true word of God? I will speir at the, gyf that be
sufficient argument to persuade ye hale congregation, and co^founde heretykis
quhilkis wald say the co^trar? This may we persaue (good redare) how necessare
it is to believe and leyn to the iug emt of ye kirk, in money diverse thingis
necessare to be beleuit, and ar nocht expreslie co^tenit i^ scripture, nor
hable to be collectit of scriptures. Their for said the ancient father S.
augustine, De prescr ip. Heret.
that he walde nocht believe the Eua^gell except ye authority of the kirk hade
mouit him sua to do: as he wald say, he was nocht habyll to knawe quhilk is the
Euangell, bot gyf the kirk had techeit him. Hauand consideration (beneuolent
redare) of yis daingerus time, quhairinto me^ ar swa procliue to falls and
wickit iugeme^tis: heir will we schortlie declare our mind towart ye authority
of the scripture, and the kirk, as we have learnit of me^ of godly doctrine
and good life. Because perchance su^ man will falsely collect of our sayingis
above rehersit, that we auance the authority of ye kirk sua hichlie, that it
extenuatis and obscuris the glore of goddis word, and trewlie we mean na thing
les. For consideration of this purpose thou sal understand, that their ar
diverse opinionis heirinto. Sum me^ raschelie ascryuis to ye scripture, it
quhilk is not to be ascryuit thairto: Sick as to make the scripture judge
quhensu^euir questioun, or debait rysis for the understanding of the samyn. Sum
superstitius me^ ascriues that to ye kirk, quhilk is aganis all verity,
affirmand the scripture to tak authority of the kirk, quhilk but dout takis
authority of the haly gaist only. Treuth it is, the kirk testifeis to the
congregation and certifiis, quhilk is autentik scripture, quhilk is nocht:
quhilk argume^tis nocht that the scripture takis authority of the kirk.
Tharefore the scrpture is nocht true because the kirk hes approuin it, bot
because the scripture in the self is true, it was and is necessare to ye kirk
to appreue ye samyn. As be exemple, sanct Ihone Baptiste testifiit that Jesus
Christ our Salueour is the Sone of God, redemare of the world, quhilk he did
be the inspiration of the haly gaist: Notheles our salueour tuke to authority
of S. Ihone, bot the father of heuin only: Sua sall thou co^sidder, that the
kirk off god geuis nocht authority to the scripture, bot be inspiratioun of ye
haly gaist testifyis, and makis manifest to the co^gregatioun, quhilk is
autentik scripture, quhilk is nocht, and sua ye kirk of god, and the scripture,
ar neuir co^trarius. Treuth it is ye kirk of God extendis to mair nor is
expreslie co^tenit in scripture quhilk al christian me^ behufis to believe, as
I have schawi^ y^ alreddy. Percha^ce thou will say, that the kirk hes na power
forther nor is contenit expressie in the scripture. Because ye scripture Apoc.
22.
cursis him quhilk ^kis or paris to ye word of God. First you sal understand,
that yir wordis ar mankitlie allegeit and falsely applyit, because their is
nocht in all the scripture sick ane word as eking and paryng to the word of
God. And als you sall understand, that it is nocht eking nor paring to ye word
of God, trewlie till expone and interpreit the samyn, nor it to make lawis
agreeable with ye law of God, as the kirk dois: For we have that ye Apostolis
Actu. 15. 1 Cor. 7. and n.
maid lawis quhilkis were nocht expreslie co^mandit be God. Thairfore thou redis
neuir that our Salueour forbad to belcue, or use any lawis bot them quhilkis
were to be co^tenit in the Euangell, or wrytin scripture. This you may persaue
yat the authority of the kirk extendis to mair nor is expreslie co^tenit in
scripture, quhilk argumentis nocht repugnance: For quhy, ye kirk was lang or
euir their was any wryttin scripture, bot it quhilk was wrytin in ye hartis of
godly me^.

Forther thou sall considder, that albeit the authority of the kirk extendis
to mair nor is expreslie contenit in the scripture (because thai ar diverse
thingis quhilkis we should believe and ar nocht contenit in scripture) nochtheles,
the scripture and kirk, ar both alyke true, equale of sirenth, power, and
dignity, gouernit euir with thee samyn spirit of God. To veufie thee samyn,
it is manifest that the apostolis ressauit their authority of Jesus Christ
lang or euir their was any wryttin scripture of the new testament: Ioha. 20.
Mat. 15.
Tharefore ye Apostolis in the sentence quhilk they send away with Paulus and
Barnabas to the gentyles, declaryng their determination towart circu^cisioun
sais planelie: Act. 15.
It hes plesit the haly gaist and ws. Quhareby thou may persaue, that thee
Apostolis had authority of the haly gaist only, and all vtheris quhilkis
succedit in their place; Nochtwithstanding that thaye were sterit up till
authority be man. For conclusion, like as it appertenis to the kirk of God to
discern, quhilk is the true and autentik scripture of God, quhilk is nocht:
Sw^ it appertenis to ye kirk to discern, quhilk is the true understanding of
ye scripture, quhilk is nocht, according to the doctrine of all men of godly
learning.

Tharefore we neuir say in all our little tractiue, that the kirk is judge to the
scripture, bot yat the kirk is judge to discene quhilk is ye true scripture of
God, and to make manifest to the congregatioun ye true understanding of the
samyn, (quhensumeuir questioun or debait rysis for the true Scripture, or
understanding their of) and swa the kirk hes and euir hade this authority off
our Salve our and their into is gouernit be thee inspiratioun of the halye
Gaist, conform to thee instructioun hade be the scripture, as the true
evident, and faithful wytnes berar of ye will, and mind of the Lord, and this
(to my judgment) is ye rycht understanding of the authority both of ye
scripture, and of the kirk of God conform to goddis word, and all ressoun.

AS IT HES plesit God to give ws grace. we half schawi^ good will (beneuole^t
redar) according till our promeis and sobir knawlege, geuand just occasion till
every christian man (quhilk is of godly and temperat judgment) to be satifeit
assuritlie in all the poyntis co^tenit in the title of our tractiue, be ressoun
that we have declarit (conform to the scripture of almychtie God, auld
testament and new, and als conform to the experience of the time euir sen the
time of the apostolis to their dayis, to gidder with sufficient ressonis and
authoriteis of the may excellent men of godly learning and good life,
quhilkis euir were ministeris in Christis kirk and co^gregatioun) the nerrest
and only way to establieshe ye conscience of all christian me^ in all materis
of debait concerning faith and religio^n. The meanis and way we schew the
likewise, quhilk was because, that all questioun and debait (for ye may part)
quhilk is or euir hes been mouit in the congregatioun for materis doutsum
concerning thee faith, raise, for the understanding of ye scripture, and nocht
for ye scripturis self. Thairfore, necessare it was to have and know the judge
appoyntit be God, to discern ye true understanding of the Scripture fra the
wrang. As towart the judge, we schew the (conform to Goddis word trewlie
allegeit and al good ressoun) that we are constraynit, assuritlie to believe the
generale counsalis dewlie conuenit, to represent the universal congregatioun
and kirk of God, quhairby all the rest of the membris sulde be pacifeit, and
satifeit in conscience, in all the secretis of ye scripture necessare to be
knawin for ane christian mannis saluatioun, and all other doutis concerning
faith and religioun, as the only judge prouidit be God, takand virtew, power,
and authority of almychtie God, vtherwayis till oppin ane plane port, till al ye
errouris quhilkis euir hes been sen the time of ye Apostolis to their dayis, and
every man to tak quhat opinioun he plesis, leuand in perpetuale contrauersie
and debait for the faith. Now sen we are certifiit assuritlie, quha is ye judge:
lat all christian man (quhilk is in dout) have refuge to the judge without curious
or forther ressonyng to be satifiit i^ his doubt: and be this mean and way
(quhilk is conform to goddis word and al ressoun) It salbe easy till all men
to be satifiit assuritlie in all materis doutsum concerning the faith and
religioun of all christian men: quhilk hes been prouidit fra thee beginning,
for the great weil, and quietness of ye hale congregatioun, be our heavenly
Father, To quhame with the Son, and halye Gaist, be praise honor, and glore,
for euir, and euir.
