Londons Lotterie: With an encouragement to the furtherance thereof, for the
good of Virginia, and the benefit of this our native Country; wishing good
fortune to all that venture in the same.
To the tune of Lusty Gallant.


LOndon, live thou famous long,
thou bearst a gallant minds:
Plenty, peace, and pleasures store,
in thee we daily find.
The Merchants of Virginia now,
has nobly took in hand,
The brauest golden Lottery,
that ere was in this Land.
A gallant House well furnished forth,
with Gold and Silver Plate,
There stands prepared with Prizes now,
set forth in greatest state.
To London, worthy Gentlemen,
go venture there your chance:
Good luck stands now in readiness,
your fortunes to advance.
It is to plant a Kingdom sure,
where sauadge people dwell:
God will favor Christians still,
and like the purpose well.
Take courage then with willingness,
let hands and hearts agree:
A brauer enterprise then this,
I think can never be.
Our most royal King and Queen,
in princely forwardness,
Has granted grace and favors both,
as thousands can express.
Sweet natures I^m Prince Henry he,
in love is not behind:
The Nobles of the Land likewise,
we all do forward stade.
W^ll may this famous Lottery,
have good success and speed,
When as the States of England thus,
do such good l^king breed.
Come Gallants, come; come noble minds
come venture now for Gold,
For smiling hope, here bids you all,
take cu^rage, and be bold.
Come Knights, and gallant Gentlemen,
put in your ventures all:
Let nothing daunt your willing minds,
good fortune may befall:
Me thinks I see great numbers flock,
and bring in fast their Coin:
And Tradesmen how in loving sort,
their Mouyes all do join:
Here Pryzes are of great account,
not simple, plain, and poor;
But unto Thousands do surmount,
whereof there be some store:
And happily some men there be,
in gayning of the some,
May spend their days like Gentlemen,
in credit and good name.
As lately here in London was,
some unto Riches brought;
Where many mended their estates,
when they full little thought*
Yet here are greater Pryzes far,
as easly to be gaind,
And valued to more thousand pounds,
thou has the first containd.
You London Merchants sending forth
your fortunes to the Sea,
Here may you purchase Golden worth,
and Countries love this way.
It pleases God, contents the King,
in venturing thus your store:
To plant that Land in government,
which never was before.
Full many a man that lives full bare,
and knows no joys of Gold,
For one small Crown may get a share,
of twice two Thousand told:
Then what is he that leares to try
his fortune in this kind,
When lu^ke and chance may make a man,
and thus great Riches find.
You Maids that have but portions small
to gain your Marriage friend,
Cast in your Lottes with willing hand,
God may good fortune send.
You Widows, and you wedded Wives,
one little substance try:
You may advance both you and yours,
with wealth that ^^mes thereby.
The Second part of Londons Lotterie.
To the tune of, Lusty Gallant.


YOu Farmers and you Country men,
whom God has blessed with store,
To this good work set helping hand,
and God will send you more:
What comes in love, will prosper well,
and be redoubled back:
And they that thus for Country does,
can never live in lack.
The King, the Queen, and noble Prince,
gives courage to persuade:
The Peers and Barrons of the Land,
has not their loves denayde:
Court and City does the like,
where willingly each man,
To build up fast Viginias state,
performs the best he can.
The Merchants of the Eastern parts,
here shows both love and care;
And ventures Gold with joyful hearts,
and thereof makes no spare.
Our gallant London Companies,
and Halles of high renown,
Into Virginias Lottery,
sendes freely many a Crown.
For good intent all this is done,
and no man wronged therein:
Then happy fortune be his dole,
the greatest Prize can win:
And happy fortune be their guides,
that nobly thus maintains
The planting of this Newfound Land,
with cares, with cost, and pains.
Let no man think that he shall loose,
though he no Prize poscesse:
His substance to Virginia goes,
which God, no doubt will bless:
And in short time send from that land,
much ^^h commodity;
So shall we think all well bestowd,
upon this Latterie.
Here profit does with pleasure join,
and bids each cheerful heart,
To this high praised enterprise,
perform a Christian part:
Good Countrymen be forward then,
and with your Tallents small,
Adventure here for good luckes sake,
and grant your loves withal.
We ought not live here, for our selves,
but for our Countries good:
And Countries good, it is well known,
long has this purpose stood:
For first, when Queen Elizabeth
here liud, so much renownd,
This Land now called Virginia,
by Englishmen was found.
Sir Gilbert, Drake, and others more,
gave us thereof first sight;
But followed now by noble minds,
with careful course aright;
Desiring nothing for their pains,
but Countries love and favor:
Then reason calls our liberal aids,
to this renowned labor.
Who knows not England once was like
a Wilderness and savage place,
Till government and use of men,
that wildness did deface:
And so Virginia may in time,
be made like England now;
Where long-loud peace and plenty both,
sits smiling on her brow.
Our King, the Lord full long preserve,
the cause of all this pleasure:
The Queen, the Prince, and all his seed,
with days of longest measure:
And that Virginia well may prove
a Land of rich increase:
And Englands government thereof,
good God let never cease.
FINIS.
