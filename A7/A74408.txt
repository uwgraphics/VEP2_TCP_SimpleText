AN ACT Enabling the Lords Commissioners for Custody of the Great-Seal, to
issue Commissions of Delegates In Cases of Pretended MARRIAGES.
WHereas the Parliament has been informed, That Jane Puckering, (Daughter and
Heir of Sir Thomas Puckering Knight and Baronet, deceased) was against her will
seized upon in Greenwich-Park, and carried over Sea to Dunkirk and Newport, and
other parts in Flanders, by Joseph Welsh and his Agents and Accomplices; and
words wrested from her by the said Welsh and his Agents, by Threats and Menaces
by him and them wickedly used to her while she was in their power; Upon
pretense and color whereof, the said Welsh did publish in Flanders and
elsewhere, That he was married to the said Jane, and that she was his Wife; to
her extreme Damage and Hindrance: The Parliament being willing that the whole
matter be duly Examined, and Right done according to the Truth and Merit of the
Case, Do Enact, and be it Enacted by this present Parliament, That the Lords
Commissioners for the Great-Seal of England for the time being, shall and may,
and are hereby Enabled to Grant one or more Commissions under the Great-Seal,
to such discreet and able persons as they shall think fit; which said
Commissioners or any three or more of them, shall have full Power and Authority
to send out Summons to convene the said Joseph Welsh, and such others as they
shall find meet, before them, at the Suit of the said Jane Puckering; and to
proceed against him as well in case he or they shall make default being duly
summoned, as where he or they shall appear; and admit the Libels, Allegations
and Proofs upon Oath upon the Merits of the said Cause on behalf of the said
Jane Puckering: And upon consideration thereof, and of the Allegations,
Defenses, Pleadings and Proofs upon Oath of the said Joseph Welsh, if he shall
appear, and think fit to allege or plead, or make any Proofs on his behalf; or
otherwise upon his not appearing, withdrawing, or not pleading, Then in his
default to assign the Cause to Sentence and Judgment; And upon full and
deliberate weighing of the whole Matter, and what Proofs shall be made in the
said Cause, to Hear, and definitively to Adjudge, Sentence and Determine the
same, for the Annulling and making void the said pretended Marriage, as the
Right in that case shall require, and to give their final Sentence and
Judgment upon the premises.

And be it further Enacted, That if any Woman has been or shall be by force
seized on or carried away against her will; or has or shall have words wrested
from her, either in this Nation or beyond the Seas, whereupon a Marriage with
any person is or shall be pretended; In all such cases, upon complaint made to
the Lords Commissioners for the Great-Seal of England for the time being on
behalf of such Woman, the said Lords Commissioners shall and may, and are
hereby authorized and required to Grant like Commissions to such discreet and
able persons as they shall think fit to appoint, to send out Summons, and
convene the persons before them: And whether the said Defendants appear, or
withdraw themselves and stand in contempt, To proceed and admit the Libels,
Allegations and Proofs upon Oath upon the Merits of the Cause on behalf of such
Woman; and to Hear, and definitively Determine the said matter, either for the
Affirming, or Annulling and making void the said pretended Marriage, as the
Right in that case shall require; and to give their final Sentence and
Judgment thereupon: Provided, That this Act shall not extend to the
diminishing or alteration of the Statutes of 3 Hen. 7. Entitled, The Penalty
of carrying a Woman away against her will that has Lands or Goods; or of the
Statute of 39 Eliz. Entitled, He that takes away a Woman against her will
that has Lands or Goods, or is Heir Apparent to her Ancestors, shall lose his
Clergy; or to any other Act or Law now in being for the punishment of such
Offender or Offenders; But they and every of them be and remain in full force
and effect, to all intents and purposes against him or them, as if this Act had
never been made.
