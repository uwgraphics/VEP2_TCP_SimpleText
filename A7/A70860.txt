PROLOGUE TO Physic Reformed.
Three Colleges of late,
Were in a hot Debate,
About a Brainsick Ass,
That ought to have a Pass
To go from whence he came.
Moorfields was in a Rage,
And swore that never a Page
In all the Ape had writ,
Had either Art of Wit:
'Twas done to get a Name.
Therefore the Quack shall be
In Straw, Confined with me,
Until his Sense return,
For Wit he will never have none,
All must subscribe to this.
Then Warwick Lane began
To speak of this Young Man,
And owned they must allow
All that was said was true,
Yet did not do amiss
In letting of him be
Of their Society:
For though he has no sense,
Yet he has Impudence
Enough to Say, and Write.
He understands much more
Than e're was known before,
And every Man's a Fool
That is not of our School;
For us he will Write, Lie, Fight,
Inform, Suborn, nay Swear;
But of his Bite beware:
Thus whilst he will be our Tool,
He shall be of our School.
Bridenwell at this with his Whip a Circle drew,
Then Conjured up old Harry's Ghost to view
The ills, he would done in forming of such Schools,
Composed of nothing else but Knaves and Fools.
The Ghost replied, I never Consented to
That Law, they say they have, for what they do:
Unto this Town they are a greater Cheat,
Than to the World is the damned Romish Seat.
Have to their Synagogue; say, Industry
And Wit are Cramped by their Monopoly.
Plague, Famine, Sword, produce not half the Ill
That these Rogues do, in Licensing to Kill.
Lash out the Drones, and then you will scarcely see
In that great Hive so much as one poor Be,
For Sourbatch that Wretch belongs to thee.
