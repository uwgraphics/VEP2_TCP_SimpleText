ON THE Prince's going to England, WITH AN ARMY, Tsuccurrere Soeclo Ne
prohibete.o Restore the Government.
Hunc saltem everso Juvenem succurrere Saeclo
Ne prohibete --
Virg. Georg. Lib. I.
ONce more a FATHER and a SON falls out,
The World involving in their high Dispute:
Remotest India's Fate on theirs depends,
And Europe, trembling, the Event attends.
Their Motions ruling every other State,
As on the Sun's the lesser Planets wait.
Power warms the Father, Liberty the Son,
A Prize, well worth the uncommon Venture run:
Him a false Pride to Govern unrestrained,
And by bad Means, bad Ends to be attained;
All Bars of Property drives headlong through,
Millions oppressing to Enrich a few.
Him Justice urges, and a Noble Aim
To equal his Progenitors in Fame,
And make his Life as Glorious as his Name.
For Law and Reason's Power he does engage,
Against the Reign of Appetite and Rage.
There all the License of unbounded Might:
Here conscious Honor, and deep sense of Right,
Immortal Enmity to Arms incite.
Greatness the one, Glory the other Fires,
This only can deserve what that desires.
This strives for all that e're to men was dear,
And he for what they most abhor and fear.
Caesar and Pompey's Cause by Cato thought
So ill adjudg'd, to a new Tryal's brought,
Again at last Pharsalia must be fought.
Ye fatal Sisters! now to Right be Friends,
And make Mankind for Pompey's Fate amends.
In Orange's Great Line, it is no new thing,
To Free a Nation, and Uncrown a King.
London, Printed for J. Tonson, 1689.
