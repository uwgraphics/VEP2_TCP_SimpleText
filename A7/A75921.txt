ADVICE TO GENESIS MONCK:
By a Friend that wishes his Happiness.
NOW George for England, that brave Warrior bold,
That would not be by Lambert's force controlled;
But did endeavor for the good of the Nation,
We hope to work a blessed Reformation,
And settle Kingly Power in this Dominion,
And then thou shall be great in the Opinion
Of all good people that do fear the Lord,
And then no doubt they will with thee accord,
And say, Long live brave George in Wealth and Peace,
Bless thee with Honors, Plenty and Increase.
And may thy Name for ever be Enrolled
In Characters of pure refined Gold,
Which has stood up still for thy Countries good,
Preserved the Laws, and saved the peoples blood
From being spilt, O happy sure art thee,
And wilt be made a man of high degree:
For by experience see what is become
Of Oliver the great, Richard his son,
Who held unjustly their True Princes right,
They Are now Obscure, their day is turned to Night.
Whereas a Conscience good, void of offense,
At last is sure to have good recompense,
To live in gloty in the life to come,
When other have a Sad and Fatal Doom.
From which God bless George Monck, and his Namesake.
Who in his praise these Lines did undertake.
FINIS.
