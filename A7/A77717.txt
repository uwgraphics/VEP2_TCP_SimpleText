A FUNERAL ELEGY UPON THE MVCH LAMENTED DEATH OF THAT MOST REVEREND, PIOUS,
AND JUDICIOVS DIVINE JOHN POLYANDER OF KERCKHOVEN, DOCTOR AND CHIEF PROFESSOR
OF DIVNITIE IN THE FAMOUS UNIVERSITY OF LEYDEN, And there the 8th time
MAGNIFICUS RECTOR.
What Is seldom seen makes wonder: Then admired
His life must be, whose Lease so late expired.
But Death is Common. True; yet so to die
Or live, transcends the common destiny
Of mortals: None so free from blame or sin,
That most admire he would not immortal been.
And so he is; while neuer-dyinge Fame
Fat he wind, or wing, or trumpe to sound his name.
But (since we find a change in things below
Which some call Death, and few desire to know,
When two dear consorts part, and must remove
Though closely knit in ever constant love)
Tell me Great soul, what made (...) quit the seat
Of thy so long abode? Did burning heat
Consume it? No. Wa'st cold? That drives all in,
Andwilt thou out? would it had warmer been!
The pillars firm, the Fabric stood upright,
Noe prop supportinge it; the windows light,
Noe senseles sense: Those organs all in tune,
And thou their Harmonye, but breathles, soon
That music stopped expires, confused noise
Succeeds, and mixed with greif's lamenting voice,
Sighs, sobs and cries, fret the tormented air
Chok't with complaints of sadness and despair;
While friends bewail a freinde whom none did spite
But that unletterd foul-mouthed Carmelite.
Children a tender Father, and a wife
Her self in him that was her soul and life:
His flock a watchful Pastor, wandering youth
A certain guide; and thou nere-conquerd Truth
A valiant Champion to defend thy right
'Ganist hell-scortcht Atheists which would dim the light
Of that God-Sonne of Heaven. Scholars greive
His death by whom their privilege did live:
And now their sun's Eclip'st. Fly cheerful light,
Or wrapped in clouds of an infernal night
Hang all the world in black! Some wanton eye
Might Else perhaps their nakedness epsy.
Thus all lament, but He triumphant sings
Sweet Hallelujahs to the King of Kings.
Much have we lost, but he much more has won,
We saw the candle, he beholds the Sun.
He Is glad, we sad; and'tis a common cross,
That none do gain but by another loss.
SAMUEL BRUNSELL.
