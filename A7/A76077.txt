January,
1 The first day of this Month Christ was circumcised, Luke 2.21. The Tops of
the mountains appeared unto Noah, Ge. 8.5. The Israelits put their away wives,
Ezra, 10.16. 2 3 4 5 The fifth of this Month word was brought unto Ezechiel the
Prophet, that the City of Jerusalem was smitten. Eze. 33. 6 The sixth of this
month Christ was worshipped of the wise me Mat. 2.1. etc. baptized, Mat. 3.15.
as testifies Epiphanius. 7 8 9 10 The tenth of this month Nabuchadnezar, King
of Babel, moved thereunto by the rebelion of Zedechiah, besieged Jerusalem most
sierely, as may appear, 2. Kings, 25. etc. Ier. 52.4. Also Ezechiel was willed
to utter his parable, Ezec. 2^ etc. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
25 Paul called, and converted, the 25. of this month. Acts 9.3. 26 27 28 29 30
31

Observations.

As the rebellion of Zedechiah moved Nabuchadnezar to rise up in Arms and to
besiedge Jerusalem, so our rebelling against God and his Laws has been the
cause of these present wars, let the example of Paul serve as a motive to
induce us to ^av^ our rebell^ous courses, and then doubtless the King will
return in peace, and crown u^ with a wreath of glory.

February.
1 The 1. of this month Moses repeated the Law unto the children of Jsrael.
Deuteronomy. 1.3. 2 The 2. of this month, our Savior was presented to the Lord, and
Mary purified, Luke. 2.22. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The 9. of this month Noah 40. days
after he had seen the tops of the mountains, sent out of the Arc a Raven and
afterward a Dove, which returned, Genesis 8.6. etc. 10 11 12 13 14 15 The 15. of
this month, the Jews spend merrily together, for that the spring of the year
does enter then as they think. 16 The 16. of this month Noah the second time
sent out a Dove which returned with an Olive branch in her Bill. Gen, 8.10. 17
18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

Observations.

This present time does nearly resemble that time, the world being involved,
(though not with a deluge of water) yet with an inundation of Blood, for War
is the only Theme that is discourst of, upon the face of Europe, especially
here in England, this land like Noah's Arc has long soated on the troubled
waters of division, a Dove is sent forth and (if heresy and hipochrisie hinder
not) doubtless this Dove will return with an Olive Branch, and the King shall
speak Peace to his People.

March.
1 2 3 The Temple of Jerusalem was finished the third day of this month. Ezra.
6.15. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The 10. of this month Christ was advertised that Lazarus
was sick, Ioh. 11.3. 11 12 13 The thirteenth of this month the Jews under
Ashueroth were commanded to be put to death, Ester. 3.13.

On the same day the next year the Jews solemnized for their deliverance,
Ester. 8.17.

14 15 16 The sixtenth of this month Lazarus was raised from the dead. Ioh.
eleventh forty three. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

Observations

It is aparent that the hearts of Kings are ordered and directed by God, as may
appear by Ashueroth from whence J infer, that though the Hamans of this
world do cause the Potentates to threatten destruction to our religious
Mordecaies, at last they shall be caught in their own sna^es, for God will
protect all his servants in the time of trouble.

April.
1 The fist of this month Neha uncovered the. Arc and saw earth, Genesis 8.13. 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The tenth of this mon^th the children of Israel pass^d tho
row the River Jordan on dry foot, Iosu. 4.19. 11 12 13 14 The fourtenth of this
month the Isaralrtes departed out of Egypt, Number. 23.3. 15 16 17 18 The
eighteenth of this month the children of Israel walked on dry land through the
red Sea. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

Observations

The Religious Israelites of this land are at this day in the same strait an
Army of destroyers daily endeavor to destroy them, and on the other side they
are invaded with the red Sea of division, superstition, and oppsition, yet let
them not murmr against God, for in his good time he will deliver them.

May.
1 The first of this Month Moses was commanded to number the children of
Israel. Numb. 1.1. etc. 2 3 4 5 The 5. of this Month Christ is thought to have
ascended up into heaven, Mar. 16.19. Luk 24.51. Act. 19. 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
They which could not keep the Passover at the day appointed by the Lord, were
willed to celebrate the same the 14 of this Month, Nu. 9. ver. 10.11. So did
the Israelites at the commandment of King Hezekiah, 2. Chro. 30.15. 15 16 The
16. day, Manna rayned from Heaven, Exodus 16.14 17 18 19 20 21 22 The 22. fire
from Heaven consumed such as murmured against the Lord. Number. 11.1. 23 The 23.
the Israelites with great joy triumphingly entered into the Castle of
Jerusalem, 1. Mac. 13.51. 24 25 26 27 Noah, the 27. The waters being dried up,
came forth of the Ark, Genesis 8.14. etc. 28 29 30 31

Observation.

Let the murmurers of this City make this their president, and take heed that
they murmr no more against the Judgments of God, nor the means which God has
ordained to preserve his people from the present judgments, least the Lord
cause the clouds to reign fire from heaven, and suffer the the sword of enemy
to prevail over them, for the Lord has promised to deliver his children, and
though he deffer his coming yet in the end he will come, and take Vengeance
against those that murmr against him; and revile his Saints, and such as
proffesse his name, here on the face of the earth, therefore wait patienly,
and the Lord will surely defend you from the power of those that seek to
destroy you.

June.
1 The first coming of the children of Israel unto mount Sinia was the first of
this month, where they abode eleven months and 20 days, in which time, all
thos^ things were done recorded in Exodus Chap 19 1. 2 3 4 5 6 The 6. of this
month Allexander that mighty Monarch of the world was borne, of whom Daniel
does prophecy Dan. 11.3. Also on this day that famous Temple of Diana in
Ephesus numbered among the seven wonders of the world was set on fire by
Herostratus. The Jews likewise kept their feast of Pentecost on this day. 7 8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 The 23. of this month the first
Edict came out for the safety of Gods people, the J^wes against Ha^an^, and the
rest of their enemies. Est. 89. 25 26 27 28 29 30

July.
1 The first of this month Ezekiell saw his vision Ezech 11. 2 3 4 5 6 The 6
of this month the Capitol of Rome counted one of the 7. wonders of the world
was burned, and the mirror of Christian Princes, king Edward the six died 1653.
7 8 9 The 9. of this month Jerusalem after it had been a long time besieged by
N^buchadnezer was taken Jer. 39.2. 10 11 12 The 12 of this month, Julius
Caesar, the first Roman Emperor was borne, of him is this month called July.
13 14 15 16 17 18 The 18 of this mouth, the Egyptians begin their year, Plin.
lib. 8. cap. 47. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Upon the 25. of this monteh King James
was crowned king of England 1603. 26 27 28 29 30 31

August.
1 The first of this month, Aaron, 40. years after the children of Israel were
come out of Egypt, died on mount Hor, Number. 33.38. Also on this day, Ezra, with
his company, came out of Babel unto Jerusalem, Ezra. 7.9. 2 3 4 5 6 7 The 7.
of this month, Nebuchadnezzar burnt the House of the Lord, and all Jerusalem, 2
Kings 25.8, 9. 8 9 10 The 10. of this month, some think Jerusalem to have been
burnt by the Babylonians, Jere. 52.12. Josephas) lib. 5. cap. 26) and said it
was burned afterward by the Romans the same day. Therefore do the Jews on this
day observe a most strait Fast, and go barefooted; and sitting on the ground,
read twice over the Lamentations of Jeremy. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

September.
1 The first of this month Haggal the Prophet began to prophecy, Hag. 1.1. 2 3
4 5 6 The 6. of this month Ezechiel saw another vision. Eze. 8.1. 7 The 7. of
this month our noble Queen Elizabeth was born, at Greenwich, Anno 1533. 8 The
8. of this month Anno 7. Jerusalem was destroyed with fire and Sword, by Titus
the Emperor, Josephus, lib. 7. cap. 29. 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
22 23 24 25 The 25. of this month Nehemiah finished the walls of Jerusalem,
Nehem. 6.15. 26 27 28 29 30

October.
1 The first of this month Jerusalem, after it had been possed of Christian
Princes 88. years, through mortal dissension, came into the hands of the
Sarazens, Anno, 1187. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The tenth of this month the the feast
of reconciliation was kept. 11 12 13 14 15 The fifteenth day of this month the
Jews observed the feast of Tabernacles 7. days together, in memory of the
Lords protecting them in the Desert. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
30 31

Observations

If mortal dissension was the cause of Jerusalems destruction, (as is apparent
by the testimony of the most ancient writers) then let England and in
particular the City of London, beware of division, for if you do not in time
g^ve a period to these destructive dissentions, and join in unity with thie
Servants of God, and assist them against the common Enemy, I dare boldy
pronounce that this ensuing year will produce the Sword, Plague, Pestilence,
and Famine, with the destruction of this glorious City.

November.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The tenth of this month An. 1483. D. Martin Luther was
born in Istebia. 11 12 13 14 15 The fifteenth of this month was made a new
holiday by Jeroboam, without the commandment of God, whereupon he committed
most wicked Jdolatry in Dan and Bethell, but he remained not long unpunished,
nor his People unplagued for the same, as may appear, 1. Kings 12. ver. 32.33.
1. King 13.1.2. etc. 16 17 Queen Elizabeth began happily to reign for the
advancement of the Gospel of our Savior Christ, the 17. of this month. 18
The 18. of this month Titus the Emperor most cruelly executed to death a
great number of the Jews, Iose ph lib. 7. cap. 10. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
28 29 30

December.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The 15. of this month Antiochus placed an
abominable Idol upon the Altar of the Lord, 1. Mac^. 1.57. 16 17 18 19 20 The
twentieth of this month Esdras exhorted the Jsaralites to put away their
strange wives 1. Esdras 9. ver. 5.6. 21 22 23 24 25 The 25. of this month our
Savior Christ was borne of the Virgin, the year after the worlds Creation
4018.

On which day also Antiochus Epiphanes entered into Jerusalem with a mighty
Army, and spoiled the same, Joseph, lib. 12.

26 27 28 The 28. of this month He rod caused the poor Innocent to be
murdered, thinking there by to have slain Christ. 29 30 31

Observations.

The world may be divided into three times every time consisting of about two
thousand years, two of which times were ended at the comeing of Christ in the
flesh, so that by all computations it is apparent that the third time is almost
accomplished since the coming of the Messiah at the end of which is expected
Christ's second coming in glory, nor is it without good ground that such
conjectures are raised, for if you go according to the words of David, where he
says that a thousand yeears are but as a day in the sight of the Lord, which
words are conceived to be (...) Prophetical description of the near
resemblance between those six days wherein God made the world, and those six
thousand years since the the Creation, wherein man was ordained to labor, and
run out a careful pilgimage, which being expired, our eternal Saboth is at
hand, where we shall rest from our labor, but to confirm it more, look upon
the words of Christ Luke 21. ver. 8. and so forward, where he tells his
Appostles that they should know the time of his coming again in glory by this
sign, that there should be false Prophets, Wars and Seditions, Earthquakes,
and Signs from heaven, all which are acomplished, false Prophets we have round
about us, Wars and seditions we are too sencible of, Signs from Heaven very
many, especially some very lately in Germany nere upon the time of the great
conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, for it is is certified by several Letters
to Persons of Great Eminency, that at Lipswicke, on the 14, of February last,
it rained Fire from Heaven and there was such thundering and flashes of
Lightning, that the inhabitants thought the day of Judgment had been come,
after which was heard pleasant music in the Air, to the wonder and amazement
of all the Country, though this relation may seem contrary to reason, yet
conclude not rashly, for Christ has foretold that such things must come to
pass, and the Scriptures must be fulfilled, these things I recommend unto thy
consideration o man, to the end that thou may prepare thy self to meet the
Bridegroom, for assure thy self that the days to come are few and evil,
therefore let the Regenerate man rejoice, for the time of tribulation is almost
accomplished and the days of peace are at hand.
