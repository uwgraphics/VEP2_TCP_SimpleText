His Majesty's Message sent by the Lord Chamberlain to the House of Peers, the
28. of December. 1641.
HIs Majesty being very sensible of the great Miseries and Distresses of His
Subjects in the kingdom of Ireland, which go daily increasing so fast, and the
Blood which has been already spilt by the cruelty and barbarousnesse of those
Rebels, crying out so loud; and perceiving how slowly the Succors designed
thither go on: His Majesty has thought fit to let your Lordships know, and
desires you to acquaint the House of Commons therewith, That His Majesty will
take care, that by Commissions which He shall grant, ten thousand English
Volunteers shall be speedily raised for that Service, if so the House of
Commons shall declare that they will pay them.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1641.
