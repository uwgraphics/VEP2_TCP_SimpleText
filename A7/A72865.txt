^he Deadmans Song, whose dwelling was near unto Basing Hall in London.
To the tune of Flying Fame.
(...)cke, dear friends, long time I was,
(...)nd weakly laid in bed:
(...)ue hours in all men's sight
(...)gth I lay as dead:
(...)t rung out, my friends came in,
(...)nd I key-cold was found:
(...)en was my carcass brought from bed,
(...)nd cast upon the ground.
(...) loving wife did wape full sore,
(...)d children loud did cry:
(...)iends did mourn, yet thus they said,
(...) flesh is borne to die:
(...) winding sheet prepared was,
(...)y grave was also made:
(...) long hours by just report,
this same case I laid.
(...)ng which time, any soul did see
(...)h stra^^^e and fearful sights,
(...) for to hear the same disclos^d,
(...)uld banish all delighte.
(...)th the Lord restored my life,
(...)ich from my body fled:
(...)ll declare what sights I saw,
(...)e time that I was dead.
(...) thought along a gallant green,
where pleasant Flowers sprung,
took my way whereas me thought,
the Muses sweetly sung.
The grass was sweet, the trees full fair,
and lovely to behold,
and full of fruits was every twig,
which shinde like glistering gold.
^y cheerful heart desired much
to taste the fruit so fair:
^ut as I reached, a fair young man
to me did fast repair.
^ouch not (quoth. he) that is none of thine,
but wend and walk with me:
and mark full well each several thing,
which I shall show to thee.
(...) wondered greatly at his words,
(...)et went with him away:
(...)ill on a goodly pleasant bancke,
with him he hade me stay.
(...)ith branches then of Lillies white,
(...) mine eyes there wiped he:
(...)hen this was done, he made me look,
what I far off could see.
(...)ooked up and lo, at last,
I did a City see:
(...) fair a thing did never man
behold with mortal eye:
(...)f Diamonds, Pearls and Precious stones
it seemed the walls were made:
(...)he houses all with beaten gold,
(...) tilde and ouer-laid.
(...)e brighter then the morning Sun,
(...)e light thereof did show:
(...) every creature in the same
(...) crowned Kings did go.
^l^s about the City fair,
all with Roses set:
Gilliflowers and Carnations fair,
which canker could not fret:
And from these fields there did proceed
the swee^st and pleasant it smell,
That ever living creature felt,
the sent did so excel:
Besides such sweet triumphant mirth
did from the City sound,
That I therewith was ravished,
my joy did so abound.
With music, mirth, and melody,
Princes did there embrace:
And in my heart I long to be
within that joyful place.
The more I gazed, the more I might,
the sight pleased me so well:
For what I saw in every thing,
my tongue can no way tell:
Then of the man I did demand,
what place the same might be:
Whereas so many Kings do dwell,
in joy and melody?
Quoth he, that blessed place is heaven,
where yet thou must not rest,
And those that do like Princes walk,
are men whom God has blessed.
Then did I turn me round about,
and on the other side,
He bade me view and mark as much,
what things are to be spide.
With that I saw a coal black den,
all tand with soot and smoke
Where stinking brimstone burning was,
which made me like to choke.
An v^ly creature there I saw,
whose face with knives was flasht,
And in a Caldron of poisoned filth,
his ugly corpse was washed
About his neck were fiery ruffes,
that flamed on every side.
I asked, and lo, the young man said,
that he was damned for pride.
Another sort then did I see,
whose bowel^ Vipers tore:
And grievously with gaping mouth,
they did both yell and roar.
A spotted person by each one
stood gnawing on their hearts:
And this was conscience I was told,
that plagued their envious parts.
These were no sooner out of sight,
but straight came in their place,
A sort still throwing burning fire,
which fell against their face.
And ladies full of melted gold,
were powered down their throats:
And these were set (as seemed to me)
in midst of burning boats:
The foremost of the company,
was Judas I was told,
Who had for filthy lucre sake,
his Lord and Master sold.
For covetousness those were condemned
so it was told to me,
And then, me thought another ^ont
of Hell Hounds I did see:
Their faces they seemed fat in sight,
yet all their bones were bare,
And dishes full of crawling toads,
was made their finest fare.
From arms, from hands, from thighs and feet,
with red hot pincers then,
The flesh was plucked even from the bone
of these vile gluttonous men.
On coal black beds, another sort,
in grievous sort did lie,
And underneath them burning brands;
their flesh did burn and fry.
With brimstone fierce their Pillows,
whereon their heads were laid,
And fiends with whips of glowing fire eke,
their lecherous skins off flaid.
Then did I see another come,
stebb'd in with daggers thick:
And filthy fien^s with fiery darts,
their hearts did wound and prick:
And mighty bowls of corrupt blood,
were brought them for to drink,
and these men were for murder plagued,
from which they could not shrink.
I saw when these were gone away,
the Swearer and the Liar,
and these were hung up by the tongues,
right over a flaming fire.
From eyes, from ears, from nauill, and nose;
and from the lower parts,
The blood, me thought, did gushing run
and clodded like men's hearts,
I asked why that punishment,
was upon Swearers laid:
Because quoth. one, wounds, blood and heart
was still the oath they made.
And therewithal from ugly Hell,
such shriekes and cries I heard,
As though some greater grief and plague
had vexed them afterward.
So that my soul was sore afraid,
such terror on me fell:
Away then went the yong-man quite,
and bade me not farewell.
Wherefore unto my body straight,
my fpirit returned again,
And lively blood did afterward
stretch forth in every vein.
My closed eyes I opened,
and raised from my sound:
And wondered much to see my self
laid so upon the ground.
Which when my neighbors did behold,
great fear upon them fell.
To whom soon after I did show,
the news from Heaven and Hell.
FINIS.
