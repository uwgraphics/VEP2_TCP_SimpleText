CHARLES R.

WHereas We find, to Our exceeding great joy and comfort, that the
Proclamation lately published by Us against Vicious, Debauchd and Profane
persons, has been well received and resented, and in some measure has had,
and will We hope yet more have Our wished effect amongst Our People: And We
continuing Our ardent desire to prosecute all means which tend to the
Suppressing of Vice, and the Advancement of Virtue, And also to acknowledge the
transcendent goodness of Almighty God for the great progress in this short time
made toward Our full Establishment, no less then His Wonderful Providence in
Our Miraculous Restoration to Our People, and them to Us, with the Advice of
the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled, do by this Our Proclamation,
straightly Charge and Command, That each Minister in his respective Parish or
Chapel, within this Our Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, and the Town of
Berwick upon Tweed, shall once in every Month, for the space of Six Months
together, next ensuing, read in their respective Congregations, the aforesaid
Proclamation, and incite and stir up their respective Auditories to observe the
Duties therein enjoined, and avoid the Vices therein forbidden.

And We do hereby also strictly Charge and Command, That every of the
respective Ministers aforesaid, do carefully and effectually observe Our Will
and Pleasure herein, as they tender Our Favor, and would avoid Our Displeasure.

And lastly, We do hereby renew Our Command, and again require all Mayors,
Sheriffs, and Justices of the Peace, to be very vigilant and strict in
Discovering and Punishing of such persons according to Law, as shall offend
contrary to the said Proclamation.
