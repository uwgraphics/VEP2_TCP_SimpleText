A New SONG: OR, The Old Woman's Wish.
To the Tune of the Old Man's Wish.
.I
SInce Beauty now fails
And I find I decay,
Let this be my Wish;
In a Chimney not gay,
May I have a warm corner
And a Bench that is complete
And a cleanly young Wench
To sweep the Hearth neat.
May I govern the Young
By my wholesome advice;
And as older, grow nearer
To be Styled prophetess;
Without pride, yet my name
Than the Sibills not less
II.
In a Garden that is furnished
With herbs for the Still,
And a bed of choice Sallets,
Which I weed at my will;
With a spacious Meade,
And a delicate Cow
And an Arbor to set
And hear Colly to low.
May I govern the Young etc.
III.
With a boild Chick on Sunday,
And a Dumpling that is soft,
And a full teeming Jug,
With a motto that Often
May have puzzled the learnd,
By the Old Sages writ;
Which in Letters of blew,
Is stained round about it.
May I govern the Young etc.
IV.
With a Book of Feat tales,
And pleasant Old Story's
And riddles by Saxons made
Long lived before us:
With a dish of Minced Meat,
Or Pigs Pettitoes;
No gristles nor Brawn,
To give dangerous blows.
May I govern the Young etc.
V.
With a Conscience untainted,
May I pass my last day,
And when I am gone,
May the good Women say
In the Morning at mattens,
In the Even at her Ale,
She Is gone, and he is happy
Can tell out her tale:
For she governed the Young
By her wholesome advice;
And as older grew nearer,
To be styled prophetess;
Without pride, yet her name
Then the Sibils not less.
