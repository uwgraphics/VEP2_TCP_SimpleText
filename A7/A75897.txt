An Admonition of the greatest Concernment in the present Juncture;
particularly to the Citizens of London, touching their Election of
Common-Councill men; and to them, all sober-minded Persons of every other City,
Town, and County in this Nation, touching their Election of Members to serve in
the Parliament, pretended to be shortly convened.
Gentlemen,
THe necessity on You and Us in this day of our greatest Distraction and Fears,
to be most careful in the choice of Common Council men to be made on Wednesday
the 21. of Dec. instant, is so great and obvious, that only such as are
pronounced to be incurably infatuated can be ignorant thereof. We therefore,
who are (as well-meaning publick-spirited Englishmen only) concerned for our
Selves, Wives, Children, and Families, in the weal or misery of this bleeding,
dying, Nation, are bold to become your Remembrancers, how all Members of
Parliament, Members of Common Council, and all other Officers, ought to be
qualified: And that too, in the Sense of the late famous Parliament, such time
as they were neither awed, garbled, menaced, disturbed, or interrupted.

The Protestation, then universally taken, and the Parliament's Order thereon,
wherein is manifest what is aforesaid, follows.

IA. B. do, in the preseace Almighty God, promise, vow, and protest, to defend,
as far as lawfully I may, with my life, power, and estate, the true Protestant
Religion, expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of England, against Popery
and Popish Innovations within this Realm, contrary to the same Doctrine, and
according to the Duty of my Allegiance to his Majesty's Royal Person, Honor,
and Estate, as also the Power and Privilege of Parliament, the lawful Rights
and Liberties of the Subjects, and every person that makes this Protestation,
in whatsoever he shall do in pursuance of the same, and to my power, and as far
as lawfully I may, I will oppose, and by all good ways and means endeavor, to
bring to condign punishment, all such as shall either by Force, practice,
Counsels, Plots, Conspiracies, or otherwise do any thing in this present
Protestation contained; and further, that I shall in all just and honorable
ways, endeavor to preserve the Union and peace between the three Kingdoms of
England, Scotland, and Ireland; neither for hope, fear, nor other respect,
shall relinquish this promise, Vow, and protestation.

Friday, July the 30th 1641. Resolved upon the Question.

THat this House does conceive, that the Protestation made by them, is fit to
be taken by every Person that is well-affected in Religion, and to the good of
the Commonwealth; And therefore does declare, That what Person soever shall
not take the Protestation, is unfit to bear Office in the Church or
Commonwealth.

BE remembered also of the solemn League and Covenant, not out of Date, like an
old Almanac, (as some have pleased with impudence enough to Say and Print,)
but in force, and the Deliberate and Allowed Breach whereof God is now too
palpably Visiting upon Us.

WE Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses, Ministers of
the Gospel, and Commons of all sorts, in the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, by the Providence of God, living under one King, and being of one
Reformed Religion, having before our eyes the glory of God, and the advancement
of the Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the honor and happiness
of the King's Majesty, and His Posterity, and the true public Liberty, Safety,
and Peace of the Kingdoms, wherein every ones private condition is includ^d;
and calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plots, conspiracies, attempts,
and practices of the enemies of God, against a true Religion, and professors
thereof, in all places, especially in these three Kingdoms ever since the
Reformation of Religion, and how much their rage, power, and presumption are of
late, and at this time, excreased and exercised; whereof the deplorable estate
of the Church and Kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the Church and
Kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the Church and Kingdom of
Scotland, are present and public Testimonies; we have now at last, (after
other means of Supplication, Remonstrance, Protestations and Sufferings) for
the preservation of our selves and our Religion from atter ruin and
desiruction, according to the commendable practice of these Kingdoms in former
times and the example of Gods people in other Nations, after mature
deliberation, resolved and determined to enter into a mutual and solemn League
and Covenant, wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for himself, with
our hands lifted up to the most high God, do swear:

1. That we shall sincerely, really, and constantly, through the Grace of God,
endeavor in our several places and callings, the preservation of the Reformed
Religion in the Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and
Government, against our Common Enemies, the Reformation of Religion in the
Kingdoms of England and Ireland, according to the Word of God.

2. We shall with the same sincerity, reality, and constancy, in our several
Vocations, endeavor with our estates and Lives, mutually to preserve the
Rights and Privileges of the Parliament, and defend the King's Majesty's
Person and Authority, that the World may bear witness of our loyalty, and that
we intend not to diminish his Majessie's just Power and Greatness.

3. We shall also with all faithfulness endeavor the discovery of all such as
have been, or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evil Instruments, by
hindering the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his People, or one
of the Kingdoms from another, or making any faction, or parties amongst the
People contrary to this League and Covenant, That they may be brought to
public trial, and receive condign punishment, as the degree of their offenses
shall require or deserve, or the supreme Judicatories of both Kingdoms
respectively, or others having power from them for effect, shall judge
convenient.

4. And whereas the happiness of a blessed Peace between these Kingdoms, denied
in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good Providence of GOD granted
unto us, and has been lately concluded, and settled by both Parliaments; We
shall each one of us, according to our place and interest, endeavor that they
may remain conjoined in a firm Peace and Union to all Posterity, And that
Justice may be done upon the willful Oppressors thereof, in a manner expressed
in the precedent Article.

5. We shall also according to our places and callings in this common Cause of
Religion, Liberty, and Peace of the Kingdom, assist and defend all those that
enter in this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof; And
shall not suffer our selves directly or indirectly, by whatsoever combination,
persuasion or terror, to be divided and withdrawn from this blessed Union and
Conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary part, or to give our
Selves to a detestable indifferency, or neutrality in this Cause, which so much
concerns the Glory of GOD, the Good of the Kingdoms, and Honor of the King;
But shall Constantly continue therein, against all opposition whatsoever; And
that We are not able to suppress, we shall make known, that it may be timely
prevented.

And because these Kingdoms are guilty of so many sins, and approvocations
against GOD, and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present
distresses and danger, the fruits thereof; We profess and declare before GOD
and the World our unfeigned desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the
sins of these Kingdoms, especially that we have not, as we ought, valued the
inestimable benefit of the Gospel, that we have not labored for the purity and
power thereof, and that we have not endeavored to receive Christ in our
hearts, nor to walk worthy of Him in our Lives, which are the Causes of other
sins and transgressions so much abounding amongst Us; And our true and
unfeigned purpose, desire, and endeavor for our Selves, and all others under
our Power and Charge, both in Public and Private, in all Duties We owe to GOD
and Man, to amend our Lives, and each one to go before another in the Example
of a real Reformation, That the Lord may turn away his Wrath, and heavy
Indignation, and Establish these Churches and Kingdoms in Truth and Peace. And
this Covenant We make in the presence of Almighty GOD, the searcher of all
hearts, with a true intention to perform the same, as We shall answer at that
great Day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed; Most humbly
beseeching the Lord to strengthen Us by His Spirit, and encourage other
Christian Churches groaning under, or in danger of the yoke of Antichristian
Tyranny, to join in the same, or like Association and Covenant, To the glory of
GOD, and the enlargement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ.

We could wish this, or either of them might be Revived, and by Authority be
made the Touchstone or Shiboleth of every Person to be Elect. But justly
despairing thereof we pray you, to agree with us, (who are many thousands) as
one man, in the Rule following; Namely, That you give not your suffrage for the
Election of any into the aforesaid great Trusts, Who have been of any Illegal
High Courts of Justice, or who are, or have been of Committees for
Sequestration, Farmers, or other Officers of Excise or Customs, Purchasers of
of any the Late Kings, Bishops, Deans, or Chapter Lands, or Delinquents
Estates: Nor of their Receivors General, or any of the Officers of the present
Army. Since, that from these, and many such others, whose business has been,
and will be, to secure themselves (from that Danger of the Law and such Estate)
from a proper reverting the due settlement of the Nation, or just Foundation
cannot by Us (not by any, who are not afrighted from their Reasons) be
expected, but much rather for the gratifying of the aforesaid Corrupt ends, to
see our present Bondage, transmitted to our Posterity, or at least to find our
Selves in little time overwhelmed with them, on their approaching Ruin. Revel.
2.5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the
first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy
Candlestick out of his place, except thou Repent.
