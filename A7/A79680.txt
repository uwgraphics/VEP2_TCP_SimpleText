to bring Him unto the rightful Possession of them. And to that end, that Thou
would vouchsafe to put the Spirit of Counsel, of Courage, and of Unity upon
them that are loyal to Him. And for those that either openly oppose Him, or
those Strange Children that dissemble with Him, that Thou would infatuate
their Counsels, and blast their Endeavors, turning their hearts both to Thee
their God, and to the King. Which we beseech Thee to grant for Jesus Christ
his sake, our Lord and only Savior. Amen.

THE EPISTLE 1. TIMOTH. 11.1.
I EXHORT therefore, that first of all Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions,
and Giving of Thanks be made for all Men: for KINGS, and for All that are in
Authority; that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all Godliness and
Honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior; Who
will have all Men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the Truth. For
there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man CHRIST JESUS.
Who gave Himself a Ransom for All, to be testified in due time. Whereunto I am
ordained a Preacher and an Apostle, (I speak the Truth in CHRIST, and lie not)
a Teacher of the Gentiles in Faith and Verity. I will therefore that Men pray
every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

The Gospel. S. MARK. X.. XXVIII.
THEN PETER began to say unto Him, Lo, we have left all, and followed Thee.
And JESUS answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no Man that has
left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands for my sake and the Gospels, but he shall receive an hundred
fold now in his time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and
children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come Eternal Life.
But Many that are first, shall be Last; and the Last first.

After the Creed, and the Prayer for Christ's Church.
This is also to be said at Evening, immediately before S. Chrysostom's Prayer.
GRANT, Merciful Lord, thy Protection, and thy Blessing to our Gracious KING:
that in all his ways He may be defended from all Kinds of Perils, and may so
prosper in his Endeavors, that all his people may, by the might of Thy Hand,
be brought to obedience under Him, to serve and honor Thee, through JESUS
CHRIST our Lord. Amen.

The Blessing; THE PEACE or GOD, etc.
FINIS.
