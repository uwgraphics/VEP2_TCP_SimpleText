A MEASURE OF THE TIMES: And a Full and Clear DESCRIPTION OF The Signs of the
Times, and of the Changing of the Times; And of the Reign of Antichrist, who
has long reigned, and of his Downfall, which is at hand; And of the Kingdom
of Christ which is now setting up in the Earth. SHOWING Unto all People in all
Nations, What the state of things has been in Ages past, and what the state of
things are at this present day. (And also) what shall be the state of things
hereafter, which suddenly comes to pass, the time is at hand, for times are
changing, and renewing, and the Kingdoms of this world shall be Translated
into the Kingdom of the Son of God.

And also, Here it is manifest, concerning the Teachers of this age, and the
root from whence they sprang, who are manifest to be of that stock of false
Prophets, which Christ prophesied of should come, and which the Apostles saw
was coming in their days, and how that the night of darkness has been upon
all, for many generations: and how that the Beast has Reigned over Nations and
Kingdoms, and his false Prophet has deceived the whole world, who have all
worshipped the Beast and wondered after him, who have warred against the Saints
and overcome them, and the whole earth has been made drunk with the
abominations.

And also, The Restoration is described, which shortly comes, wherein Christ
shall Reign, whose right it is, and shall change Laws and Decrees, and the Lamb
shall be the Light of all Nations, and there shall be no need of any other
light, when the Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdom of Christ, and he
alone shall bear the Government, and no other King, for he shall rule all
Nations with his Iron Rod, and the Kingdoms of the Beast shall be overthrown,
and his power subdued, and they that have given their power unto Him shall be
ashamed, and all the Kings of the earth shall lay their Crowns down at the feet
of the Lamb, and the numberless number of the Saints is gathering, and the
Dominion shall be in their hands, and their King shall posesse the uttermost
parts of the earth.

By one who has measured the times, who is come to the day that has made all
things manifest. EDW: BOROUGH.

A MEASURE OF THE TIMES.
THE Lord has opened my heart to declare; and the words of my mouth shall be
the words of truth, and of a good understanding, to every one who has an ear
to hear: whose ear the Lord has opened to hear, and understand things of old,
and the state of things as they have been in ages, and generations, past; and
as now the state of things are at this day. Hearken, and consider, and let your
ears be open to instruction; For the word of the Lord is toward you, that
your hearts may understand the things that belongs to your peace, now in your
day, before the time come that they be hid from your eye, and your eye be
darkened, never more to perceive, but you left to perish, and to die with the
uncircumcised.

Behold! and give ear, ye Inhabitants of the world; see, and consider, in what
time you are fallen, even in a time of darkness and Apostasy, wherein thick
darkness covered all the world, and a veil of ignorance the faces of all
people; Death has reigned King over all, and the Cloud of thick blindness
has laid on the hearts of all men. O how has darkness, blindness, and
ignorance, covered all men, even as a cloak and a garment? How has the eye
been blinded, the ear stopped, and the heart hardened? So that the Lord God,
and his way, his truth, and salvation, has not been manifestly known, heard,
nor felt, nor witnessed; for ages and generations: the words thereof have been
professed, but the power and life thereof has not been enjoyed. But men have
been deceived with the form of Godliness without the power, and cheated with
a likeness of things without life; and have sought the living among the dead,
and worshipped Idols which have been without sense and understanding; and with
lying imaginations, and feigned likenesses, has the carnal part (which ruled
in people above the seed of God) been fed, and with shadows, and outward
appearances, and the soul has been starved.

Alas, alas! woe is me because of these things; my heart within me is broken,
and I am perplexed. The shadow of death has been the lodging place of all
people, and the veil of ignorance has been a covering, and the darkness of
heart has been followed for a Law, and a blind understanding have been the
guide, for ordinances and statutes: and Death in the beastly power has ruled
as King, in all the dominions of the earth, and in all men's hearts; and men
has been without the wisdom of God, even every eye blind, and every ear
deaf, and every tongue dumb, and every heart corrupt, and void of
understanding, and every foot lame, and all men have been altogether imperfect;
for the living God has been as a stranger unto the children of men, less
known by men then the owner to the Ox, and less perceived then the crib by the
ass, and all flesh has corrupted its way before the Lord.

Woe is me! when I consider, how man who was planted with the choicest vine,
even Gods image, and was a noble plant, is degenerated into the plant of a
strange vine, unto God, and brings forth wild grapes, and sour grapes, which
the Lords soul loathes; and thus have the vineyard, and the plants thereof,
rewarded the husbandman, with fruit of a bitter taste, and with the reward of
corruption; And man is condemned in his transgression, for want of the
knowledge of God, more then the Ox, and the Ass.

Pride, covetousness, lust, and envy, backbiting, lying, drunkenness,
whoredom, theft, murder, and all manner of evil, and sin against God, more
then can be expressed, is abounding, and supera bounding among men in this
Generation. Iniquity is grown to the full, the measure is up, and the number of
transgression is sealed, that the Lord may arise, who has been pressed as a
cart with sheaves; and now is the Lord arifing, and he has said, Ah, I will
ease me of my adversaries, and be avenged on my oppressors. And vengeance
belongs to him, and he will repay, and will destroy the vineyard with the
plants and fruits thereof, and the briars and thorns shall be consumed, and he
will lay wast, and devour, and confound all his enemies in a day, when his
indignation goes forth, and his sword is made bare, and his purpose comes to
pass, in rooting out the oppressive seed of evil doers, which has filled his
habitation, wherein he should dwell, with cursed children, and a brood of evil
births.

In the days of Christ, and his Apostles, was the hand and power of the Lord
felt, and the Lord gat himself a name and a glory; and he caused his marvelous
light to spring forth, and his day to dawn, and the day was manifest, that many
Prophets and wise men had desired to see, but was not in their time seen by
them, and his power was made known, and his arm was made bare in the sight of
many Nations; and in that day his glory was spread abroad, and his truth and
way was exalted, and his glorious Gospel was declared through the earth, and
the sound of his marvelous works went forth into all the world; judgment and
mercy was known, and righteousness and peace was witnessed among men, and life
and immortallity was brought to light through the Gospel, and the word of life
by which all things was created, and by which they stand, was handled, seen,
felt, and tasted, and the Lord God in that age was known to dwell with his
people, and to walk in them, and his Covenant was established with many, and
his promises was fulfilled; redemption, deliverance and salvation, was
revealed, even Christ Jesus the Son of God, the Prince of peace; And
righteousness was made manifest in the sons of men, and revealed in many who
saw Gods glory, and was witnesses of his majesty and dominion, and were
gathered unto him in the bond of peace, and were his sons and daughters, and
were led by his Spirit in all his ways of truth and righteousness. And many
went forth into the world and declared through Nations the things of Gods
kingdom, which was come to them, and was discovered within them; and the Lord
God spoke from Heaven by his Son unto them, and they were filled with the holy
Ghost, and with power. And the Lord was with them whom he called, and made them
wise, and their word powerful, and their message effectual, and their weapons
were mighty through God, and strong holds were subdued, and the powers of death
and darkness were subjected, and the hearts of thousands were turned to God,
and the Gospel was preached in power through the world, and many were brought
to God, out of darkness into light, and from Satan's power unto God. And the
earth was filled with Light, and the mighty and the wise were confounded, and
the bonds of cruel oppressions were broken, and they that set themselves
against the Lord and his way were confounded, and scattered, and brought to
naught, though they were many in that generation.

How did all the chief Priests, and Scribes, and Pharisees, Elders of the
People, and Rulers, and Governors, lift up themselves in the Pride of their
hearts, and took Counsel together, and persecuted the innocent, and put to
death and imprisoned the children of the most high? How did they in the days
of Christ persecute and seek for his life, till they had taken it from the
earth by their subtilty and wickedness? The Apostles and Ministers of Christ
were persecuted, some was put to death, and others suffered grievous things for
the Name of Christ, and were made a prey and a spoil unto destroyers, whose
wickedness increased against the way of God, till it was fulfilled in its
measure, and the wicked with their works were dashed to pieces; and the Lord
gave his way, and truth, and servants, dominion and power over all his enemies,
and whole Nations were brought to the knowledge of God and his ways, and his
name was glorious, and his kingdom was exalted in the earth, and many were his
people, who were gathered by him, and his powerful word, through the mouth of
his ministers; whom he ordained, and called, who were fishermen, and such like,
who were chosen to fulfill his will, and to do his work, and not many wise
men of the world were called, but God chose the foolish things to confound the
wise, then as he does now; and such were honored by the Lord, and bearers of
his name, and of his message, and glad tideings, though they were contemned of
men; yet unto such he gave the authority to overturne the wise, and to outreach
the wisdom of this world, for they were learned of the father, and had the
knowledge of his ways though they were unlearned in the arts, and crafts of
men, which stands more in policy, and subtilty, then in the fear, and wisdom
of God; and in that day the Lord was with his people, while his people was with
him, and he loved them while they stood in his counsel, and he gave them
dominion over all their enemies; and they were a terror to the whole world,
while the churches stood in the dread, and terror of the Lord of hoasts, yea
all bowed under them, and their feet trod upon the high places of the earth,
and they were blessed of the Lord, above all people; even till they waxed fat,
and were increased in treasures, and thought they had need of nothing, and then
they forgot God, and rebelled against him, and became perverse in their ways,
and grew into strange Idolatries, and errors, and left the way of truth, and
cast Gods Law behind them; and the power of godliness ceased, and the form
grew, and it was exalted more then power, and love waxed cold, when iniquity
abounded; and men became lovers of themselves, more then of the Lord; and the
Lord, and his mavelous works which had been brought to pass were forgotten,
and hardness of heart, and unbelief entered, and then the false prophets, and
antichrists came in, which Christ had prophesied of, and established the form
of godliness, without the power, and subverted many (even whole houses, and
Countries) from the simplicity of Christ Jesus; so that many became insensible,
and grew past feeling of the power, and operation of God, and their minds
became blinded, and their ears stopped; and God was grieved, who had brought
up children, and they forgot him, and rebelled against him; for the Churches
became corrupted, and lost the life, and power of God, and the holy ghost; and
became Idolaters, and worshipers of Idols, and as you may read Paul prophesied
that many should depart from the faith, and give heed to seducing spirits, and
to the doctrine of Devils; and grievous wolves should enter, not sparing the
flock, but seeking to devour it, and would make havoc, and merchandise of
souls, through coveteousnesse, and filthy lucre, and perilous times would
come, wherein their should be a form of godliness, and not the power; and in
that generation before, and soon after his decease, this came to pass, and
was fullfilled; and as you may read in the revelations the churches grew into
superstitions, and Idolatries, the church of Ephesus had lost her first love,
and her candlestick was to be removed, and so it came to pass; and some in the
church of Smyrna were in the blasphemy, saying they were Jews, and were not,
but were the sinagogues of Satan; and the church of Pergamos, some among them
held the doctrine of Balaam, and to eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to
commit fornication, and some held the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which God
hated, and against them would the Lord fight with the sword of his mouth; and
the church of Thyatira suffered that woman Jezabell to prophecy, and to teach,
and seduced the servants of the Lord to commit fornication, and to eat things
sacrificed unto Idols; and she, and her lovers was to be cast into a bed of
torment, and her children should be killed with death; and all the churches
should know, that God searched the reins, and the hearts, and every one should
receive according to their deeds; and the church of Sardis had only a name to
live, but was dead, and her work was not perfect before God, and upon them
would the Lord come as a thief, and they should be in darkness, and not know
what hour he would come. And the church of the Laodiceans were luke warm, and
neither hot, nor cold, and the Lord would spew her out of his mouth, for she
was wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked, and the shame of
her nakedness did appear; and if any had an ear to hear, they might hear;
these things were spoken by him that lives for ever, the first, and the last,
the beginning, and the Amen; so that hereby the Lords soul was vexed, and his
spirit grieved, and his wrath was suddenly kindled against them, who were
revolters, and backsliders from his way of salvation, which he had made
manifest to them, through the mouth of his servants; so that his fury went out
against them to overthrow them, and to break them to pieces; and they being
turned from his Law, and from his statutes, he gave them up unto their own
hearts desire, and brought in the heathen upon them, to confound them, who
broke them asunder, and trod down many of their Cities, and gained great Ports
of their dominions, and made them slaves by multitudes, and overthrew their
worship, and subjected their power; even the Turks, and base uncircumcised
people made a prey upon them, and possessed their habitations, and set up
abominable Idolatries in the place where Gods honor had dwelt; and their
dominions, and treasures without, became spoil to the teeth of devourers; for
they having lost the terror, of the Lord, he brought up the heathen to be a
terror unto them, whose power was mightier then they, and overcame them, they
being without the power of God; and this justly came upon them, according to
the purpose of the Lord, because of their backslidings; And others of them, who
was not so given up to the will of an outward enemy, yet were they given up to
strange Idolatries and subversion, and setting up images, and worshipped that
which is not God, but abomination to him, to this day; so that the holy City,
which had been full of glory, was given to the Gentiles to be trodden down; and
under their poluted feet has it been stamped, and to their mouth has it been
a prey, for such a time, even since these things came to pass, unto this day;
as you may read, and the Beast and false Prophet, has ruled in oppression, and
the great whore has made all Nations drunk with the wine of her fornication;
All the great men, and Princes, and nobles, and all the people upon earth have
been made drunk by her, and touched her uncleanness, and ever since the day
wherein the backsliding entered, she has fit upon nations, and kindreds, and
tongues, and people, and has been decked in diverse colors, to deceive the
hearts of all people, and all Nations have been deceived by her, and the beast
and his power, whose dominion has been great, has upheld wickedness by a
Law, and established Idolatry by decrees, and all have been out of the way, and
wandering in blindness, and darkness, even the whole world have worshipped the
Beast, and gone after the false Prophet, which sits upon the Beast, and his
power protects him, till they be both overthrown into perdition, and cast
alive into the Lake, which now the Lord is comeing to do in power, and
dominion: and great Babylon is coming into remembrance before the Lord, and as
she has done, so shall it be done to her, her children is dashing against the
stones, and her offspring is withering away, and the darkness is vanishing,
and the Sun is appearing, and the beastly power shall be subdued, and the false
Prophet confounded, even the old Dragon shall be bound, and chained, never more
to deceive; for the Beast has had a long reign with his false Prophet, who
have prophesied lies, and false divinations, and led away the minds of all
people.

For mark; and consider, Christ Jesus who came into the world, with glad
tidings of good things, even with peace, and salvation: he said the glorious
day was come, and even that day which many Prophets and wise men had desired to
see, but had not seen; the earth was filled with light, as I have said, yet he
farther prophesied, and said, that the night would come when no man could work,
and that in the last days false Prophets should arise, and deceive many, and
should come into the world, and should cry lo here, and lo there is Christ,
and and if it were possible should deceive the very elect; and the Apostle John
in his time, who had been an eyewitness of Jesus, and had handled, and
tasted, and felt the word of life, and had been with Jesus, and bore a true
testimony unto him; in that very age, and generation, he saw the false
Prophets, and antichrists come, and coming in, and aluded to the very sayings
of Christ, by this we know said he, that it is now the last time, for there are
now many false Prophets, and antichrists gone out into the world, they were not
of the true Apostles, but went out from among them, (being gone out from the
light in their own particulars) and beguiled the hearts of the simple, by good
words, and fair speeches, and went in Balaams way for gifts and rewards, and
in Caines way to envy, and murder, as you may read in the Scripture; so that in
John's time, the false Prophets which Christ foretold off, were come, and they
did deceive many according as Christ had said, and they drew many from the
ways of God, and subverted many from the truth, and made havocke of the flock,
and were grievous wolves, according as Paul had said, and truth began to
perrish from among men, and the power thereof ceased, and the apostasy came in,
and the form was set up for a season; so that John farther saw, and said the
whole world went after the Beast and false Prophet, whom he saw before was
come, and worshipped the Beast, and his image. But a few whose names were
written in the book of life; and as I have said the holy City with the outward
Court, was trodden down by the Gentiles foot, and darkness surprised all, and
wickedness abounded more, and more; and the night came upon all, as Christ had
prophesied, and the Beast grew in his dominion: till there was hardly any man
left to bear witness in the truth, and in the power of God, unto the name of
Jesus; but all was subverted into dead forms, and shadows, and likenesses
without life, and the Lord left the earth, as it were, and covered himself in
the darkness; and became a stranger in the world, and did scarce openly speak
by vision, nor dream, nor Prophet, but all were left in the dark, and
ignorance abounded, and superstition was exalted; the Saints spirit, and ^se
which they were in, and guided by was lost, and then they began to worship the
Saints names, and days, and words, without the life, and power; and that
nature, and that same seed which had persecuted the Saints to death, and
gainsayed the pover; and lost the holy ghost, turned it self into the
professi^n of the Saints words, which were left upon record; and confirmed it
self into the Saints practices, without the life, power and holy ghost. And
having lost the power, from which the Sripture was given forth, and not being
guided in the life which they were in, which spoke it forth; then from the
Scripture (...) men's own conceptions, and thoughts, and by their reason,
w^^hout Gods Spirit, they set up likenesses, and images, and sects, and forms,
and many heads, and many horns grew upon the beast which all the world
worshipped, and went after; for they had lost Christ the one head, wherein the
union stood, and grew into Idollitry, under the many heads which was upon the
Beast, who had many horns, which pushed one against another, as it is
witnessed unto this day; do not the Papists, and Protestants (so called) and
other sects risen out of them, push one at another, to break, and tear one
another; and these have many heads. The Pope he is a head, and the others they
have a head, which every one bows down under his own head; the Pope will not
bow to the Protestants head, nor will the Protestants bow to the Papists head,
the Presbiterians, and Independants, and Anibaptists, and the rest, every one
of them bows to their own head, and will not bow to another head. and all
these with their horns pushes one against another, to rend one another; and
all these are from Christ, and knows not him the one head of the whole body,
and the one horn of Gods salvation, unto all people: for Christ which is but
one is the head, and the horn, which all the Saints, who are now gathered out
of this apostacy, and dark night, unto whom the Light again is risen,
worships Christ the one head, and knows him the one horn, which pushes against
the Devils Kingdom, which has long been set up, and ruled in the earth among
all these, who have many heads, and many horns, who are all of them (the very
chiefest) but in the night fallen, in the apostacy, and darkness, since the
beginning of the reign of the Beast, and the comi^g in of the false Prophet,
which came in as I have said when the churches backslided, with the whore also,
who have mad^ all Nations, and people drunk with the wine of her fornic^tion;
and the Beast has reigned over all Nations in his dominion, and authority, and
the false Prophet has prophesied through all nations.

And all these came in since the days of Christ; or he prophesied that it
should be so, as it is come to pass; and they were coming in, in the days of
the Apostles, as you may read Paul saw them coming, and largely describes their
character in several epistles. And Peter he saw them coming in, and described
them, what such they were, and should be; and Jude he saw them also, and John
more fully then any, both in his epistles, and revelations; as I have hinted
at. And when the Apostles were taken of the earth, some by cruel death, and
others was banished, then they sprung in more fully, and grew through all
Nations; and to this day has the Beast, with his many heads, and horns, ruled
in Nations, and been worshipped, and his false prophet has ever since been
defended, and riden on the Beast, through Nations, and has deceived the
Nations with vanity, and error; and at this very day the Nations, and people
are deceived, and lies under darkness, in the slavery and bondage, under the
authority of the Beast, and subject to the doctrine of his false Prophets.

And as I have said darkness has been over all, and fancies, and liknesses
without life have been bowed under, and the power being lost, the form has
been set up, one after this sort, and another after that, according to men's
vain conceits, and apprehensions upon the Scriptures, and not according to the
manifestation of the Spirit of God, which fulfills the Scriptures, and brings
to live the life of them.

So in diverse colors, and in diverse appearances, and Robes, in several
forms, and shapes of garments has the great whore been decked, who has sit
upon the Beast, having the false Prophet serving as a boy, or servant, to do
whatsoever the whore lists. And the false Prophet, this servant to the whore,
under the power of the Beast, has moved, and turned as the Beast would. And
according as the whore has changed her self into other garments, and colors;
even so has the false Prophet changed his doctrine, and prayers to please the
whore, and to keep people under the government of the Beast. It Is known in
this our day, that some who preached, and prayed for the King, and Bishops, do
now preach, and pray for others, even for them who destroyed King, and Bishops;
so the false Prophet with all his children, is but the whores servant, who has
made drunk Kings, and Princes, and great men, and people, and Nations, with the
cup of fornication, and abomination, in the several sects, and forms of
worships, which has been set up, without the power of godliness; for the
Babtisme of the Spirit being lost, and not known, then from the letter by
imaginations, were several sorts of Baptism brought forth, as sprinkling of
infants, that dark folly, and vain vanity, which all these Nations have been
deceived withal, by the exercise of the false Prophet. And when the gift of
the ministry, through the holy ghost, which the ministers of Christ had, was
lost, and not any more received.

Then began men to make Ministers, by natural learning, and arts, and
languages, and humane policy, and when the gift of preaching by the eternal
Spirit was lost, through the coming in of the Apostacy, then began men to
study from Books, and writings, what to preach, and say, not having the holy
ghost received in them, which none is a minister of Christ without, (mark
that) and when men had, lost through ignorance, the knowledge of God dwelling
in them, and that their bodies was his temple, and that he dwelled and walked
in his people, then began they again to build Temples without, and to set up
their false worships in them; for having lost the sense of Gods true worship,
which the Saints worshipped in, in the Spirit, and in the truth. Then they began
to worship in set days, and set times, and set places, and outward
observances, which is not the worship of God in the Spirit, and in the truth,
but superstitious, and Idolatrous; and when the word of God was not received
immediately from his mouth, nor the Gospel by the revelation of Jesus Christ,
as it was in the days of the Apostles, then (darkness being come in) they
used their tongues when the Lord had not spoken to them, as the false Prophets
did before Christ's time; and long have they said the letter is the word, and
that the letter is the Gospel, and that it must be received by the Scriptures,
and by natural learning, and arts, and that none can be ministers of Christ,
but such who are learned in the languages, and knows the original of
Scriptures, Latin, and Greek, and Hebrew, not any of these have received the
Gospel, by revelation, or the word of God from his mouth. And when singing in
the Spirit, and with understanding was ceased, and not known then began people
to get the form of singing of David's experiences in rhyme, and meeter; and when
the pure power of godliness was lost, which was in the days of the Apostles
manifested, and known, then in the Apostacy, the deceit grew into the form of
every thing, which the Saints had enjoyed in the power; and so was shadows
set up instead of substance, and death instead of life, and the form without
the power, which in many branches sprang forth, some into one appearance, and
some into another; but all under the power of the Beast, with his many heads,
and horns defended; and until this day, since the days of the Apostles, thus
it has been, and those very teachers, and supposed ministers, which now are in
this, and other Nations, are of that very root which sprang forth in the days
of the Apostles; and they are under the dominion of the Beast, and moveable
like unto the great whore; and this may easily be proved that they are of that
generation of teachers, and false Prophets, which Christ prophesied of should
come, and which the Apostles saw was coming in their days, and of those which
John saw the world to run after; for Christ said by their fruits they should
be known, and the Apostles they described their fruits, and them by their
fruits; And so we seeing their fruit to be the very same now, which the
Apostles described was the fruit of them, that then was come, and coming; from
whence we do conclude according to sound judgment, that these very teachers
are of the same generation, and branches of the same root, which sprang forth
then. And in Paul's writeings you may read, such they were, whom he saw, of whom
he bad people to beware, and said perilous times would come, and men should be
lovers of themselves, covetons, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, false accusers, fierce
dispisers of those that are good, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures, more
then lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power, and
such of whom people were ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge
of the truth; for people were laden with sins, and led away with diverse lusts;
and these did resist the truth, as Jannes, and Jambres who withstood Moses, by
making likenesses without life, and they were men of corrupt minds, and
reprobate concerning the faith. Now it is plain that these teachers in this
generation are of that very stock which Paul describes, such he saw would come,
and such we see are come, and by their fruits we know them, as Christ said; and
Paul's words are fullfilled, for these teachers are lovers of themselves, and
covetous, and proud, this is plain to all people; and blasphemers, who denies
Christ to have lighted every man that comes into the world, and therefore they
deny Scripture, and so are disobedient, and unholy men, and without natural
affection, who many of them have caused the innocent to be imprisoned, and some
have dyed in Prison, and they the chief cause of this, and this is without
natural affection to the creatures; and they are false accusers, and liers,
and fierce in their books and preaching, as is manifest through all this
Nation; and they greatly despise those that are good, and prepares war against
such, as does not put into their mouths; and they are heady, and high minded,
and lovers of vanities, and pleasures, this is evident without proof, and they
have a form of godliness; they say all should be taught of God, but when any
comes to witness it, and denies their teaching, they cry against such as
Heriticks, and thus they have the words, and the form, but denies the power;
and they are ever teaching twenty and forty years, and more, but none able
ever to come to the knowledge of the truth by them, but ^^il in blindness, and
darkness still, and people cries out, who have been learning many years from
them, that they do not know the truth; and its plain that these teachers are
of that sort, that Paul spoke of, who brings none to the knowledge of the
truth; for people that follows them are laden with sins, and led away with
diverse lusts; and these have, and do resist the truth every where; they deny
that Christ has lighted every man that comes into the world, and so resists
truth, and denies Scripture, and the truth, as you may read, John 1. 9. And
they are corrupt minded, even wicked persecutors, and suers at Law, and earthly
minded, and covetous, and oppressors, and are wholly reprobate concerning the
faith; and thus it is plain that the root of these teachers was springing in
the Apostles days, and has grown ever since in this dark night of
Apostacy, and has filled the Nations.

Again, the Apostle saw that many should depart from the faith, giving heed to
seducing spirits, and doctrines of Devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having
their consciences seared as with a hot Iron. Now these teachers are of that
stock which is departed from the true faith; for they are without true faith,
and reprobate concerning it, who are in iniquity, and sin, and the works of
the world which are evil; now faith purifies the heart from all this; but
their hearts are not purified, but poluted with covetousness, and preaching
for hire, and persecuting, and envy; and therefore they have not faith, and so
are of that generation which departed from the faith, after the Apostles times,
which they saw would come; and these does seduce, and their doctrines are of
the Devil, who denies the truth which the Scripture bears witness of; and
says sprinkling infants with water, when they are two or three days old is
Baptism into the faith of Christ; this is the doctrine of the Devil, and lies
they speak in great numbers, and in hypocrisy, and writes them forth to the
world in great hypocrisy, with feignednesse, and pretense of holiness; and
its plain many of their consciences are seared; how do many of them cause the
poor people to suffer grievous imprisonment, and spoiling of their goods, to
the ruin of families almost, for their maintenance, as tithes, and such like,
which if their consciences were not seared they could not do; also some of
them cried to the rude wicked people, in their Idol Temples, fight lads for
the Gospel; and many who have borne witness to the truth, and against their
deceits, have been beat, and abused, and knocked down as for dead in their
presence; and their consciences are absolute seared, else they would tremble at
these things.

Also the Apostle Peter, he saw false Prophets would come in, 2 Pet. 2. And
false teachers, who would bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord
that bought them; and many should follow their pernicious ways, and through
covetousness with feigned words, they would make merchandise of people; and
they would walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanesse, and despise
government, and be presumptuous, and self willed, and not afraid to speak
evil of dignities, and they would speak evil of things they understand not,
and their hearts are exercised with covetous practices, and were cursed
children, and they sport themselves with their own deceivings, and these had
forsaken the right way, and are gone astray following the way of Balaam, who
loved the ways of unrighteousness, and these are clouds that are carried with
a Tempest, and they speak great swelling words of vanity, and while they
promise to others liberty, themselves are the servants of corruption. And such
were scoffers, and mockers which would come after the Apostles days, and they
would walk after their own lusts.

And now according to this prophecy of Peter, who saw false teachers coming
in, he gave these characters of them, whereby it does plainly appear that this
generation of teachers are they, and of that stock which then came in; for
these brings forth the very same fruits, which they did, which he spoke of, and
we know them by their fruits, as Christ has said; for these have filled the
world with damnable heresies, as holding forth that sprinkling infants with
water is baptism into the faith of Christ, and that a sleeple-house is the
church, and that singing David's experiences in the world among wicked people in
rhyme, and meeter, is singing to the praise of God, and these are damnable
heresies, even to the denying the Lord that bought them; for they deny the
light of the Lord Jesus Christ given to every man to be the only teacher, and
the only guide of man, and they that do deny the light of Christ with which
every man that comes into the world is lighted to be sufficient to lead to
Christ, and to the Kingdom of God (as these teachers in this age do) they
deny the Lord that bought them; and many, even whole Nations, all the world as
John saw in the revelations have followed their pernicious ways, and run after
their Idolatry, and pernicious ways of superstitions, and they do make
merchandise of souls, through covetousness with their feigned words; for
where they can make their bargain to have the most money, there they will
preach, and no where else, and if any will give them more the next year, they
will sell that people, and go to another, for very covetousness, by feigned
words, and they do walk after the flesh, in the lust of pride, and
covetousness, which is uncleanesse of the flesh; and they despise the Saints
government and order; for they will not suffer the Saints to prophecy one by
one in their assemblies, according to the Saints government, but does despise
that, and persecute it by the government of the Beast, unto whose government
they are subject, and not to the government of Christ, and the Saints; and thus
they are presumptuous, and selfe-willed, presuming to afflict, and cause the
children of God to be cast into prison, and suffering them to be beat, and
abused by their flock, out of their wicked self wills, and they are not afraid
to speak evil of dignities, and does speak evil of the ways of God, and of
his truth which they understand not; and their hearts are exercised with
covetous practices, and are cursed children; for they make poor people that
has but ten eggs give them one, and that hardly can get any fuel for the
fire, pay them a penny for the smoke; with such many other exceeding covetous
practices, as suing men two hundred mile to answer for three shillings claimed
by them for tithes.

And these sport themselves in their vanities, in their own deceiving, and when
they have oppressed people for their wages, and makes people pay them for whom
they do no work, and forces wages from them that never hired them, which is
unheard of, covetous practices; they sport themselves in their pride, and
lustfullnesse, and they are out of the right way, and gone astray from the
ways of God which are holy, and are in the way of Balaam, who went after
unrighteous wages, who sought for enchantment against Jsrael, as these do; and
these loves unrighteous wages, by taking maintenance from people by force, unto
whom is nothing oweing by them, and these are carried with a Tempest of every
wind, according as the powers of the earth blows, these are carried sometime
under such a government, and sometime against it, and so are clouds carried
about, and are unsettled on the foundation, and they speak great words of
Christ, and God, and the Scriptures, which are but words stolen by them,
because they are not spoken by the Spirit of God, but by a lying Spirit, and
they promise to others liberty, that they shall receive the Kingdom of God
after death, and that Christ has taken away their sins, with such like
promises of liberty, but themselves are the servants of corruption, living in
pride, and hatred, and covetousness, and these serve sin, and are servants of
corruption; and they are scoffers, and mockers, and walkers after their own
lusts, as it is evident in all men's sight. So that according to the judgment of
truth, we judge these teachers of this generation, to be of the same root which
then sprang forth; for these brings forth the same fruits, as they in that
time did; and in the apostasy they have overspread the whole world; and also
the Apostle Jude gave a description of them, according as Peter had done; he
saw certain men creeping in, who turned the grace of God into wantonness, and
they were filthy dreamers, and knows nothing, but what they know naturally, as
bruit Beasts, and in that they corrupt themselves; and they have gone in the
way of Caine, and run greedrly after the error of Balaam, and they are trees
whose fruit withers, rageing waves of the Sea, foaming out their own shame,
wandering Stars, they are murmurers, and complainers, walking after their own
lusts, having men's persons in admiration, because of advantage, and these
separate themselves sensual, having not the Spirit; and of this sort which
Jude describes are these teachers in this generation, whose fore fathers crept
in, in the Apostles days, and these are their cursed children, which now
abounds in these Nations at this day; and they are filthy dreamers, studying
for what they speak, and dreaming without the Spirit of God an hour in a
Pulpit, and what they know it is naturally, by natural learning, and natural
arts, and in that knowledge they are also corrupted, in pride, and vain glory,
and vanities, like bruit Beasts in their apparel, and practices, and not like
ministers of the Gospel nor Saints; and they are in Caines way, in envy, and
murder, and wrath, abounding; no people like them, and they do run greedily
after Balaams error, for gifts, and rewards, and unrighteous wages, which they
run after greedily; and they are trees who brings forth these cursed fruits,
which will wither, and fade away; and they are like raging proud waves of the
Sea, foaming out their shame in lies, and slanders, and cursed speaking, in
public, and private, and they have no habitation in the firmament of God, but
are wandering Stars, and sometime in one opinion, and sometime in another,
but the blackness of darkness is reserved for them, and the judgment of the
great day; and they are murmurers, and complainers, and they can never have
enough, but seeks for their gain from their quarter, as the false Prophets
did in Isaiahs time, and they have men's persons in admiration, because of
advantage to themselves, bowing, and worshipping men's persons, who will
advantage them in their wages, or hire, and maintenance, begging favor of the
Magistrates, and having their persons in admiration, that they may have their
advantage in oppressing poor people in tithes, in this, their wickedness is
hard to be expressed; and these have separated themselves, into self
separation, some into one form gathered, and some into another, but all
sensual, and in the wisdom which is from below, and without the Spirit of God,

And thus it is proved that these teachers of this age are of the same
ge^eration, in their practices, which Jude describes to be creeping in in his
time. And farther the Apostle John 1. epistle 4. He saw that the false
Prophets, and Antichrists, which Christ prophesied of to come, was come in his
days, and said many false Prophets are gone out into the world, which is the
Spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have heard, said John, and even now already
is it in the world, and they were of the world, and the world heard them; and
so are this generation of teachers, who succeeds them that went forth into the
world then; these are of the world, in its ways pride, and wickedness,
covetousness, and envy, and all evil, and they that are in the evil of the
world, in wickedness hears them, and maintains them; so that according to
John's description, these teachers of this age are of that same flock which came
in then; and John further saw that all the world was gone after them, and
worshipped the Beast which was then risen, and run after the false Prophet,
which then came in, and fat upon the Beast, and its plain that the world is
all run after them, until this day, which is a day of bringing back again
from the false Prophet, and from under the power of the Beast, and the Beast,
and his image; and the false Prophet, and his divinations must down to the
ground; and according as John further prophesied, the holy Citywhich had been
trodden down under the Gentiles feet, for such a time should again be gained,
and the Saints should have the dominion, and the old Dragon should be chained,
and Christ should reign, and his Kingdom should be set up in the earth, and
the Tabernacle of God should be with men; and this is the day that the Lord is
restoring again the way of peace, which long has been lost, and the power of
God is again witnessed, which has not been known for generations.

So that of things spoken this is the sum of truth, and the word of the Lord
God to all people on the earth; that in the days of Christ, and the Apostles,
it was a glorious day of light, and life, and power, and the Lord gathered a
people which honored his name, while they stood with him, and in his counsel
walked; but since the days of the Apostles, has been an Apostasy* and
darkness over all, and a subversion upon all, and night have been over all,
wherein no man could work as Christ said, and forms without power have been
established, the pure way of God has not been known in its purity; so that
this time wherein all are fallen, is a time of ignorance, of the reign of the
Beast, which all the world has wandered after, and a time wherein the Gentiles
feet has trodden down the holy City, and a time wherein all the world runs
after the false Prophet, and are deceived, and made drunk with the wine of the
whores fornications. I say this is the time wherein all the men of this
generation are fallen, and the Scripture is fulfilled, the night wherein no man
can work is upon the world, and further this is the time of Antichrists
dominion, which has exalted himself in the seat of God, showing himself to
be God; and long has he reigned with the Beast and the false Prophet, ever
since the days of the Apostles; and these same teachers of this generation
which now are in the world are manifest by their fruit, to be of that
generation of that seed, and flock of false Prophets, which Christ prophesied
of should come in the last time after his days, and which most of the Apostles
saw coming in, in their days, by their fruits I say they are known, for these
brings forth the same fruits, and bears the same marks which they described
those did, in their time; so we see Christ's prophecy is fulfilled, who said
they should come; for they are come, and the Apostles descriptions are
fullfilled on these; for these teachers are such as bears the same characters
as is proved, as they said they should bear that would come; and long has the
Nations been deceived, and kept under the worship of the Beast, running after
the false Prophet; and we see John's prophecy is fulfilled, who said that the
holy City was given to be trodden under the feet of the Gentiles; for so we see
it has been for many generations, and also we know the time is now
approaching, that the dominion of the Beast is near an end, and the holy City
shall the Saints possess, and the Gentiles shall be driven out of it,
according as John said, who wrote the last of any of the Apostles, and gave
full testimony of these things which I have declared of, (viz.) of an Apostasy,
and reigning of the Beast, and false Prophet, and a subversion from the ways
of God; and this has been, and come to pass; also he prophesied of the
gaining of the holy City, in again to the Saints, and of a restoration, wherein
new Jerusalem should be made manifest from heaven, and should again be
adorned, as a bride for her husband, and the Saints should inhabit it, and the
Tabernacle of God should be with men upon earth, and the Lord would dwell for
ever with his people; and this day is approaching nigh at the doors, for the
fig tree has blossomed, and we know it is near at hand, the summer wherein the
glory of the Lord shall be revealed unto all Nations, and they shall know that
he is the Lord God Almighty that will take vengeance upon the great whore, who
has made all drunk with the wine of her fornication.

And now after the long night of Apostasy, and darkness which has been upon
the face of the earth, is the Lord appearing, and his day dawning, and his
light breaking forth as the glory of the morning, and the Kingdom of God is
revealed, and his dominion is setting up, after the long reign of the Beast,
who has had his power, and his seat, and his great authority from the dragon,
after whom the whole world has wandered, and him has worshipped, who have been
saying who is like unto the Beast, who is able to make war with him? his mouth
for many generations has been opened in blasphemy against God, and his name;
and he has made war with the Saints, and his power has overcome them (mark)
overcome them, and then himself has reigned, and the reign of Christ for many
years has not been known, but over kindreds, and tongues, and Nations has
the Beast had power, and over them has reigned for many ages, and all that
dwell upon the earth has worshipped him, whose names are not written in the
book of life; the earth has been caused, and them that dwell therein to
worship the Beast, and by his wonders he deceives them that dwell on the
earth, and as many as would not worship the Beast and his image, the Beast has
had power that they should be killed, and many has he killed, who would not
worship him, and are persecuted; and both small, and great, rich, and poor,
free, and bond, has received the mark of the Beast, and the number of his
name, which is the number of a man; he that reads let him understand; these
things has come to pass, and been fulfilled since the Apostles days, in this
night wherein no man could work, which Christ said would come; but now the
forty, and two months, which time the Beast, and his image was to continue,
and so long was his power to remain to make war, and to overcome the Saints.

I say the time is well nigh expired, and finished, and the Lord God Almighty,
and the Lamb is arisen to make war against the Beast, and his image, who has
reigned over the Kingdoms of the world, and the judgment of the great whore
comes, who has sit upon the Beast, and drunken the blood of the Saints, and
with whom the Kings of the earth (since the Apostles days) have committed
fornication, and all the inhabiters of the earth have been made drunk with the
wine of her fornication; and all the merchants of the earth has been made rich
through the abundance of her delicacies; and she has sit upon the scarlet
colored Beast, and her cup in her hand has been full of abominations, and
filthiness of her fornication, and her name is mystery Babylon, the mother of
harlots; and all the Kings of the earth has given their power unto the Beast,
and committed fornication with the great whore; and she has sit over people,
and multitudes, and Nations, and tongues (since the Apostles days) and even
some who have hated the whore, and fulfilled the will of God, and made the
whore naked, yet they give their power also to the Beast, until the word of
God be fulfilled.

Consider these things you that has an ear to hear; but now the mighty day of
the Lord, and the judgment of the whore is approaching, wherein she shall be
rewarded according to her works, and double shall be given her into her cup,
and as she has loved blood, so shall blood be given her to drink, and the
merchants of the earth shall lament her, whom they have waxen rich by, who has
glorified her self, and lived deliciously, and has said in her heart, I sit
as a Queen, and am no widow, and shall not see sorrow; but now the one day is
dawning, wherein her plagues shall come, death, and mourning, and famine, and
she shall utterly be burned with fire; for strong is the Lord that is risen to
judge her, and the Kings, and merchants, and all the inhabiters of the earth
shall lament her, and shall cry, Alas, alas! and now are they beginning, for
the hour is come that her judgment comes, and all her merchants, who have
trafiqued with the souls of men shall partake of her plagues, who have partaked
of her sins, and lived deliciously with her, and the fruits that her soul
lusted after shall depart from her, and all things that are dainty, and goodly,
shall depart from her, and she shall find them no more at all, when her
judgment comes and in an hour all her riches is come to naught, and her
merchants at land and Sea shall lament her; even her that has ruled over
Nations, and sit as a Queen for many generations, ever since the days of the
Apostles, until this day; yea all that have wandered after her, even the whole
world shall lament, and bemoan her; and such as have served her, and made
slaves of the souls of men, by merchandise, and trafique shall bewail her, and
their gain shall cease for ever, for in one hour shall she be made desolate,
and her glory shall fade, and her beauty shall wither, and the Beast that has
carried her shall utterly faint, and the false prophet that has wrought
miracles in their sight, and deceived the Nations shall be cast into a bed of
torment with her, and the Beast, and the false Prophet shall be taken, and cast
alive into the Lake of fire to be tormented for ever day, and night, world
without end; and the whore in whom has been found the blood of the Prophets,
and of the Saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth, and the Beast
who has caused all that dwell on the earth to worship him, and his image, for
many ages, and the false Prophet who has deceived the whole world, and all
Nations, and made them subject unto the power of the Beast, by his miracles
which he has wrought in the sight of men; these shall be plagued together, and
tormented together; for the false Prophet, and the Beast has sent forth their
unclean spirits, like frogs unto all the Kings of the earth, and unto the
whole world to gather them to battle with their Armies to make war against him
that sits on the white horse, even the Son of God; and this is the false
Prophet which Christ prohesied of to come, which long since came, and has
served the Beast, and the great whore; for many generations, and many even all
Nations have been deceived as Christ said, and led aside* and blinded, and
bewitched by him; And as I have said these teachers of this generation are of
them, of their Root, and offspring which long has flourished on the face of
the earth.

But the day is at hand, that the heaven, and the holy Apostles, and Prophets
shall rejoice over the whore, and over the false Prophet; for the Lord comes to
avenge us on her, and as she has done, so shall it be done unto her; now in
this day wherein Jerusalem shall be builded again, and the holy City which the
Gentiles have trod under foot, for forty and two months, which time is
expired, and near a full end, accounting from the days of the coming in of the
Apostasy, until this day, if any have an ear to hear let him hear; this I
have received from God; I say the holy City shall be measured, and the Gentiles
cast out, and she shall be adorned, and as a bride for her husband shall she be
prepared, and Gods Tabernacle shall be with men, and he will dwell with them,
and they shall be his people, and God himself will be their God, and all
tears shall be wiped away, and there shall be no more death, nor sorrow; for
the former things are passed away and all things shall be made new.

And what I have said are the faithful sayings of God; every one that is a
thirst shall drink of the water of life freely, and he that overcomes shall
inherit all things, and shall be called the Son of God, and shall dwell in the
holy City, which long the Gentiles foot has trodden under, which shall again
be adorned, and prepared as a Bride for her husband; if any has an ear to
hear let them hear. And the glory of the Lord is risen, and his day is
breaking forth more abundantly, and the Lamb is given for a light, and all
Nations that are saved shall walk in the Light of the Lamb, and the King of
righteousness, (who has been long fled into Egypt, while Herod the Beast,
which has sought his life, and driven the woman into the wilderness, has
reigned) shall again be set upon the holy hill of Sion, and rule all Nations
with a rod of Iron, and trample upon the necks of all his enemies, the Nations
has not for many ages been ruled by him. But the Beast, who has ruled over
kindreds, and people, and said who has been able to make war against the
Beast, and to the power of the Beast has all Nations been subject, and the
dominion of Christ has been trodden down, and despised, and his holy City has
been laid wast, and his Princely power has not been felt, nor witnessed in the
Kingdoms of men, for ages, and times, nor him the one head, and the one horn
has not been known, but many heads, and horns has been exalted, and all
Nations, and all the Princes, and Kingdoms of the earth, has been subject
unto the Rule, and Law of the Beast, and to ^he divinations of the false
Prophet, and darkness has been over all, and God has been as a stranger in
the earth, as one not known, he has been worshipped ignorantly, and the
inscription every where has been to the unknown God, but now after all this
the glorious God of truth has appeared, and great, and mighty has been his
hand, and power in this our day, in raising up a righteous branch out of the
Root of righteousness, and in gathering his scattered people up to himself,
who have been scattered by the Idol teachers, and deceived by the false
Prophets, and made a prey upon by the wild Beasts of the Forest; O how has
the people been made a prey upon by their teachers, and greedily devoured by
dumb shepherds, who have sought themselves, and sought for their gain, every
one from his quarter; for many ages, how has people been led blind, by their
blind shepherds, and none to this day come to the knowledge of the truth by
them? for these have run, and was not sent, and therefore the people have not
been profited at all, as it was in Jeremiahs days, so is it now, no profit
among people in the knowledge of the ways of God, but leanesse, and
barrenness, and as the teacher, so his people, all out of the way, in
profaneness, and wickedness, and profaneness is gone forth from them into many
Nations, yet is the Lord bringing back his inheritance, which has been driven
away into the desolate wilderness; yea, and the Lord has caused his light to
shine out of darkness, and unto them that have sit in darkness, and in the
shadow of death is the mavelous light risen, that the glory of the Lord may
be revealed, and Gods Tabernacle may be with men, and the holy City is a
preparing as a bride for her husband, and darkness shall fly away, and sorrow,
and sighing shall no more be known, but life, and immortality shall again be
brought to light, as it was in the days of the Apostles.

This I have received from God; and the Lord shall be known to be the God of
his people; and for this cause has he called, and chosen faithful witnesses,
and given his powerful ministry, by the gift of the holy Ghost, as it was in
the Apostles days, and now many are called to declare abroad the things which
we have heard, and seen, and handled, and the Gospel of Christ is received by
the Revelation of Gods eternal Spirit, and Son in our hearts, and the power is
made manifest, and the form of godliness is denied and judged, and Christ the
one head is exalting, and the one horn of Gods salvation is revealing, and the
many heads, and many horns must be broken to pieces, and be confounded in this
the day of the Lord; for his purpose is powerful in carrying on his own work
against all his enemies; so that none is able to hinder, But they that set
themselves (even the Beast, and his power. which is now struck at) and his
Kingdom is invaded, has raised the force of his power, and the policy of his
arm; yet shall they be confounded, and no formed weapon shall prosper against
the Lord, and his way; who is now arisen to avenge himself of the Beast, and
his power, and the whore, and her fornications, and the false Prophet, and his
divinations, which all must into the wine press of Gods dreadful wrath to be
trodden; and all that worship the Beast, and repents not, shall partake of the
plagues of the Beast, and of the whore, and though the false Prophet gather
Gog, and Magog together, to fight against the Lamb, and to compass the
beloved. City about, yet he shall, and them that he gathers be broken to
pieces, and driven as dust before the wind, and as stubble before the fire; for
the purpose of the Lord shall stand. Great Babylon is come into remembrance
before the Lord, to reward her according to her deeds; and the Lord will cause
his truth, and his salvation to be known in the earth, and his name and power
is declared in the hearts of his people to the overturning of all
unrighteousness, and though every horn of the Beast push against this, and
every head with his members set it self against it; yet the council of the
Lord shall not be disanulled, nor made void, for the Scepter, and dominion of
his Son shall be exalted over all the earth, and the Princes of the world, and
the Kings of the earth shall lay down their Crowns, and become subject; for the
Kingdoms of this world shall be changed, and shall become the Kingdoms of the
Lord, and of his Christ; the Kingdom of the Beast must down, and the Princely
power of darkness must be overthrown, and Laws, and times, and things, and
powers of men shall be overturned, and overturned, till he come to reign in
the earth, whose right it is to reign over Nations, and people; And because of
this the rage of the Heathen has been great, and the counsels of the wicked
many, and strong, from the profane drunkards to the chiefest professed
teachers of this age, even all the whole body of the Beast, has joined it
self against the purpose of the Lord, men of all conditions from the highest
to the lowest, have armed themselves with mischief to offend the way of truth.

This is written as moved of the Lord to go abroad through the Nations, that
all may understand concerning the times, and the changing of times, how that
the Beast has reigned in dominion, over Nations, tongues, and people; and all
have worshipped the Beast, and gone after the false Prophet; here all may come
to a good understanding, what has been, and what is, and what shall be; how
that when the power, and government of Christ was lost, through departing from
the faith, which ruled in the Apostles days, then the whole world was as
unstable in ways, and judgments as a Sea, then out of the Sea one beast arose,
and another after him arose out of the earth, and all has been caused both
small, and great, bond, and free to worship the beast, and the image of the
Beast; yea all the dominions of the world has for many ages been subject to
the power of the Beast in all things, and not known the worship, and power of
God, and the pure subjection to him, but the Kings of the earth, and all her
Princes have given their power to the Beast, and has received their authority
from him, and acted thereby many of them in great unrighteousness, in
injustice, and oppression, and cruelty; in pride, and rebellion, and vain
glory, in quarilling one with another, to the murdering of thousands of
thousands; and this has all been brought forth under the power of the Beast,
and by it; and his heads, and horns has exalted themselves one against
another, and smitten one another, and the great whore has made them all
drunk, and all people upon earth, with envy, pride, wantonness, and all
unrighteousness; this has been since the Apostles days in this night of
Apostacy, wherein the whole world has been subverted by false Prophets, and
deceivers, and the Kingdom of Christ has not been known upon earth for many
generations, but the Beast has been established in his Throne of rebellion
against Christ Jesus, his decrees has been Laws, and statutes, and he has
made war against all the Saints, and overcome them, and reigned over them
until this time, and trodden down their City, and defaced their glory, but the
blood of the just has cried day, and night under the Altar, the souls of such
as has been slain for the Testimony of the word of God have cried day, and
night, how long Lord, how long, when will thou avenge our blood upon the heads
of our enemies, even the Beast, the whore, and the false Prophet, and this has
been for many ages, even while the Kingdom of Antichrist has been set up, and
advanced through the world, and his power, and authority has reached over
Nations, bond, and free, from the Prince on his Throne, to the beggar on the
dunghill, even all has been subjected under the power of the Beast; that
nature having ruled within every particular, has given him the authority
without over all, and admired him, and said who is able to make war with him.
Antichrist has ruled over all, by injustice, oppression, and tyranny in
unrighteous Laws, and through wicked decrees, old Pharoah-like, he has laid
heavy yoakes, and oppressive bonds upon the just; for who would not be subject
to him, he has had power to kill them, and none was able to gainsay; such has
been the greatness of his power, and the strength of his dominion over all,
that none has been able to make war against him, he has been admired in all
the world, not any Nation excepted where the government of Antichrist has not
borne rule, and there has been none left to bear witness against him, or to
stand up against him; for the faithful witnesses has been killed, and slain
in the streets of the great City, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,
and all them that have dwelt upon the earth have made merry over their dead
bodies, and rejoiced in their iniquities over the slain, and been without a
reprover, and not tormented, nor troubled, but have sent gifts one to another,
because they have slain them, who have tormented them that dwell upon the
earth; and the government of the Beast has been enlarged, and the whole world
has wandered after him, and been in subjection under him, for many
generations; even for forty and two months, he that can read let him
understand; so long has it been given him to make war against the Saints, and
to overcome them, and it has been given him to reign over all people in the
wrath of God, and in his anger, because of the rebellion of all the earth and
all people in it, but he shall be taken away in Gods displeasure, who reigns
in his anger over the Nations, who has forsaken the Lord, and was given up to
the power of the Beast, to be subjected in slavery, and bondage, in pain,
sorrow, and misery; and through deceit, craft, and pollieic, and oppression,
and by the wisdom of this world, and natural arts, and knowledge his
government has long been established, and his dominion has been upon earth;
times, and Laws, and things, and powers of men have been in his hand, to
change, and subvert, and overturne into his own image, and to transform them
like to the Beast, none upon earth, has bought, or sold, or judged, or given
evidence, or been respected in all the world, that have not had the mark of
the Beast, and the number of the names of Antichrist, rich, and poor, and
small, and great has received his mark, as a seal of their subjection to the
Beast, whose many heads, and many horns, has subjected all by the force of
his arm, and he has blinded the eye least men should see him, and cast
darkness over all faces, and the salse Prophet has deceived many, as Christ
has said, and all the earth has been wandering in the wilderness of
wickedness, and the long-suffering of the Lord has been wearied, and he
continually provoked to destroy the Nations, who have followed Antichrist, who
has showed himself in the seat of God, to be God, and has sat in the seat of
God, in the seat of justices righteousness, and of mercy, and the abomination
of desolation has long stood in the place where it ought not, for many ages,
and length of times, and his many heads, and many horns has swayed the world,
through the terror of the Beast, who has made all worship him, and they that
would not he has killed, who has carried the great whore, who has made all
men without exception, and all Nations without respect to any, wholly drunk
with abomination, and all has staggered, and fallen* into grievous iniquities,
and the Dragon has stood ready continually, to devour the child of
righteousness as soon as it wa^ borne, and the woman has been forced to fly
into the wilderness that has brought it forth, and has fed there for so many
days, and for a long season has the Lord been blasphemed, even the name of
God, and his Tabernacle; and them that dwell in heaven.

But now has the Lord considered, and looked down from his habitation, and of
a truth he is risen, and has taken to him his great power, that he may reign,
and put all things under his feet, and subdue the power of the Beast, and
Antichrist; and all their government, and rule, and Laws, and decrees shall be
overthrown, and confounded, and all their worship shall be broken; for great
Babylon is come into remembrance before the Lord to render to her according to
her works; the Lamb is now risen, and advanced with his bow, and his sword,
and he is going forth conquering, and to conquer the Beast, and all that has
worshipped him; and they that are with the Lamb are called and chosen, and
faithful, and they loved not their lives unto death, and they shall overcome
him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of his Testimony; the dominion
of the Lamb is setting up, and his power is made manifest, and the stone cut
out of the Mountain without hand is a dashing at the feet of the image, and
against the Beast, and his power, and against all his Laws, and decrees is he
risen, and he will change times, and Laws, and powers, and the Kingdoms of
this world, shall become the Kingdom of the Lord, and of his Christ, and he
shall reign for ever and ever; for now the Spirit of life from God is entered
into the witnesses which has been slain, and they begin to stand upon their
feet, and great fear falls upon the great men of the world, and the Devil is
cast out into the earth, who has sit in heaven, in the Temple of God, and
deceived the whole world, and his wrath is great against the Saints, and
against the Lamb, because he knows that his time is but short; and the
man-child shall grow, and shall rule the Nations with a rod of iron; if any
man has an ear to hear let him hear; he that leads into captivity, shall
go into captivity, he that kills with the sword, must be killed with the
sword; the purpose of the Lord shall stand, who is now gathering, and bringing
back such as has been driven away, and deceived by the generation of false
Prophets, who has deceived the whole world and all that dwell therein, and the
Lord will take vengeance upon them, upon the Beast, and upon the false Prophet,
and great Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall be no more at all, but shall
be made desolate, and the voice of harpers, and musicians shall be heard no
more at all in her, But her glory shall wither, and fade away in a moment, for
he that bath a true weight, and measure is appeared to divide, and to give due
weight, and measure unto every one, and all the wicked who will not come from
under the worship of the Beast shall have their part in the Lake that burns
with fire, and he that is unjust, let him be unjust still, and he that is
righteous, let him be righteous still, here is the dividing of all things as
they were in the beginning; the glory of the Lord is risen, whose name is
called the word of God, and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, and with it
he smites the Nations and he shall rule them with an iron rod; for his name is
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and he is gathering his Saints together to
the supper of the great God, to eat the flesh of Kings, the flesh of captains,
and the flesh of horses, and them that sit thereon; the purpose of the Lord
shall not be disanulled, though the Beast, and the Kings of the earth gather
together their Armies to make war against him that sits upon the horse, who is
already gone out to conquer, and the numberles number of the Saints are
gathering together before the Throne of the Lamb, and they have no guile found
in their mouths.

And the day is now dawned, and the night is far spent, woe unto the world, and
to all the inhabiters of the earth, who have worshipped the Beast, the Lord is
coming to plead with you, and ye that have partaked of the sins of the great
whore shall partake of her plagues, and she shall be rewarded double according
to her works, for her sins has reached unto heaven; the day of great
tribulation is at hand, of anguish, and destruction, men shall seek death and
shall not find it, but it shall fly from them, when the Lord arises, and the
Lamb stands upon mount Sion, and his Saints with him, who shall tread down
the Heathen, and cast them out, even as they have trodden down the holy City,
and the worship thereof; and the Kingdom of the Beast, and his seat, and his
great authority, which he has received from the Dragon, shall all be thrown
down; and the Kingdom of the Son of God with his government, scepter, and
rule shall be established in all the earth, and the uttermost parts thereof
shall be given him to possess; this is the promise, and this shall come to
pass, and through the whole world; Laws, and decrees, ministry, and orders
shall be changed, and renewed; the Law, and the decree of the most high shall
rule over all, and the holy City shall be beautified, and is adorning, and
preparing, for the Saints, and their King to inherit, the Lamb is the light of
the City, and the Temple therein, and all Nations, and people that are saved
shall walk in the light of the Lamb, for he has lighted every man that comes
into the world with the light of salvation in all that do receive him, and
darkness shall fly away; the Sun is risen, and praises, and honor, and glory,
and dominion shall be given to the Lamb, who shall reign over Nations, and
his Saints shall see him, and his name shall be in their foreheads, and there
shall be no night, but light, and glory, and the Kings of the earth shall bring
in their glory, and honor into it, and the gates stand open, and is not shut,
every one that thirsts let him come, the cry is unto all, and yet nothing
that defiles shall enter; these are the faithful sayings of the Lord who is
true, and must not long be sealed, for the time is at hand, and all men shall
read, and all that keeps the commandments of God shall have right to the
tree of life, and blessed are they, they shall be healed, though now they
suffer all manner of evil for the name of Jesus, by the Beast, and under his
power, by them that worship him, who must fulfill wickedness by persecuting
the innocent, till the Lord be raised out of his habitation; and the dominion
shall be given to them, and they shall have power to bind Kings in chains,
and nobles in fetters of iron; this is their honor, and this is their dignity,
and they shall rejoice for ever, and ever, and shall glory in the Lord, and not
in this world, and this shall come to pass as the Lord has said. Wherefore
all Nations, and people arise, arise, and be awakened, prepare, prepare, and
make way for the Lord, be removed ye Mountains, and thrown down ye hills, and
hewn down ye sturdy oaks, and cut up ye tall Cedars, make way, and prepare
the path for the holy one, who is coming to rule with his iron rod, and will
dash you all to pieces; be afraid, and tremble thou Beast that has long
reigned over the earth, and all thy false Prophets, and worshipers be
confounded at this, and bow, and tremble at the remembrance hereof, he whom you
have hated, and crucified, and his Saints whom you have persecuted shall come
to reign over you all, and to him whom you have set at naught must you be
subject to, and ruled by, to all your sorrow, for behold the Lord comes with
his numberless number of Saints,

And this is a warning to all Nations, and people upon earth, times, and Laws
must be changed among you, governments, and orders must be changed; unjustice,
and oppression shall be removed, and every yoke, and burden shall be taken of
from the neck of the poor, true judgment, and justice, mercy, and truth, peace,
and righteousness shall be exalted, and all the Nations shall have Judges as
at the first, and counselors as at the beginning, and the poor shall rejoice
when true judgment, and justice reigns, and the false Prophet subdued.

And this is a warning to you all, that you may hear, and consider the Lamb who
has been slain, who is risen to reign, who is the Prince of peace, of whose
government there shall be no end, even he has lightened all man kind on the
face of the earth; the fight is the eye which will let you see all this, and
will bring you to the fulfilling of it, and to the good understanding, and it
shall evidence the truth of this, even the light of Christ in all men which is
given to guide in the way of peace.

THe Kingdom of Christ, is setting up, and it is not of this world, neither
shall be exalted, nor advanced, by worldly policy, and worldly wisdom, nor by
carnal weapons, nor by the multitude of an host of men, (it is true) the Son
of God is gone forth, conquering and to conquer, and the Spirit of his mouth,
and the word of his power, shall get himself the victory his own arm, alone
without the help of another, shall work the conquest, and his Kingdom shall
be set up within every particular of his subjects, for none can know him reign
without them unto their salvation, till they know him, to reign first within,
for that which opposes the Kingdom of Christ, and the setting of it up, is
within every man, and must be subdued within, where it has ruled, and the
enemy of Christ's Kingdom, which has lodged within, must first be subdued
before there be dominion over his enemies without. This is the word of the Lord
to all people, for he that pursues his enemy without, and leaves him in his own
house, is foolish, and out of the way, and shall be overcome of his enemy, and
shall not overcome him, therefore ye that are waiting for the Kingdom of
Christ, be awakened, and seek for it, where it is to be found, not without you
first, but first within, strive not to obtain it with your carnal weapons,
but take the weapons which is spiritual, which only will overcome, be not
deceived for through suffering must the Kingdom of Christ be set up, and not
by rebellion through crafts, and plots, and secret policy, and turbulent
arisings, nor strife, in the nature of enmity, (by this means shall the
Kingdom of Christ never be advanced) And this is the word of the Lord, and our
Testimony which we give of the Kingdom of Christ, who is indeed arisen to make
war against all his enemies, and they that follow him are called and faithful,
and chosen, whose weapons are spiritual, and mighty through God, and reaches,
to the killing and subduing of all flesh, (and he must war) till all his
enemies be subdued, and must reign over all his enemies, till the Kingdom be
delivered to the Father, where he shall be all in all.

The 3d month 1657.
All ye Inhabitants of the Earth in all Nations through the World; Hearken and
give ear, the Word of the Lord God that made Heaven and earth is toward you,
He is coming to set up his Kingdom and his Dominion which never shall have
end, and the Kingdoms of this world shall be changed and shall become the
Kingdoms of the Son of God.
ALl ye Kings, and Princes, and Rulers through the whole world, the Lord is
coming up with his mighty Host against you all, he who will fan you, and sift
you, and try you, and search you out, for his fan is in his hand, and he will
thoroughly purge you, and you shall all know that the Kingdom of the most high
God, rules in the Kingdoms of men; all your glory shall fade away, all your
Majesty, and Honor, and Dignities, and Dominions shall come to an end, all
your strength is but as a straw, all your treasure as a thing of naught, all
your glory as a fading leaf in the presence of the Lord God that made heaven,
and earth; all Nations upon the earth, are but as the drop of a bucket before
him, and the hearts of all men are in his hand, and by him Kings rule, and the
Princes of the earth are at his disposure and you are all weighed in the
Balance of equity, and found too light before the Lord, for all flesh has
corrupted its way before him; Be awakened ye that have long slept in darkness,
and been at ease in the flesh ye that have had peace in this world, and
pleasure in the vanities thereof, the Lord is coming to make war against you,
his trumpet has sounded, and his Sons and Daughters is gone forth to bear
witness of his Majesty, and Power, and Dominion, and the Lord has spoken, who
can but prophecy, he has given the word, and many are they that publish it;
Let your ears be open to instruction, and kick not against the Lord, neither
harden your hearts against him, but make way for him, and prepare his path, for
he comes to judge the world in righteousness, and the people with equity, and
the testimony of the light of Jesus in you all shall witness for him; your
Princely powers must become subject to the power of the Kingdom of the most
high, and your glory must be veiled, and darkened before the glory which the
Lord is causeing to shine forth, and we the servants of the most high do give
you warning of the day of your visitation, which is upon you, and all the
world; for the Lord is now risen who has long winked at the time of great
ignorance, but now he warnes you all to repent; therefore bow down ye
stiff-necked, and tremble ye stout-hearted, and be abased ye lofty-looks, our
King is above you all, our dominion is over you all, and the line of true
judgment are you all measured with, and your ways are not found perfect in
the sight of the Lord, nor your hearts right before him, his Kingdom has not
been known in your dominions, neither has his Law and his Judgments borne
rule, but you have every one bin doing that which is right in the sight of your
own eyes; and the counsels of your heart has been naught but vanity before
the Lord; vain glory has abounded among you which the Lords soul has been
burdened by; the honors, and pleasures of the flesh has been your delight,
and strife, and enmity has been among you, and wars, and quarrelling, and
fighting one against another, and you have rejoiced in the overthrow one of
another, and in destroying one another, and you have taken pleasure in gaining
one another dominions, you have striven who should have been the greatest, and
greatly opressed the poor, you have exalted your selves one against another,
and drawn up your Armies one in defiance of another, and the Blood of thousands
has been shed to satisfy the humors of your proud hearts all this has been
evil in the sight of the Lord, and his Spirit has been grieved, and his soul
vexed by all this, and he has forborne till he has been weary; for he has
been dishonored by all this; and his Law has not borne rule, and his
judgments has had no place, you have been cruel hearted one toward another,
and merciless, and without pity, and you have not done to others as you would
be done unto, but you have rendered evil for evil, and sought occasions of
evil one against another, and vexed one another through the pride of your
hearts; Therefore now is the Lord risen to make war against you all, and to
dash you to pieces; the feller comes up amongst you, he that will not spare to
ssay, and to devour, who will not be afraid of your lofty looks, he will
spoil you of your treasures, and lay waste your strength; all ye kingdoms of
the earth, and your gathering together against him is but as briers, and
thorns, for he will exalt his own Kingdom over you all, and all ye Kings of
the earth shall know that that the Kingdom of the most high must rule in your
Kingdoms, and your laws shall be changed, and the poor shall no more be
opressed; for he is come that proclaims liberty unto the Captives, who will
remove opression far away, who will change times, and worships and ordinances,
and there shall be no Law but the Law of God, nor no light, but of the Lamb,
nor no worship but the worship in the spirit, and in the truth; for all your
worships which the nations are full of, is naught but vanity, and a lie,
immitations, and superstitions, brought forth in hypocrisy, and not in an
upright heart; vanity of vanities has abounded both in civil, and spiritual
affairs; The root in which you stand is wholly corrupted, and no good fruit
springs from it, but cursed fruits which must be hewn down, and cast into
the fire; ye have been evil, and could not bring forth any good, you are
corrupted, and your fruit is of a bitter taste, a day of sorrow, of
lamentation, and misery is coming upon you all; ye that have been high, and
lofty and stout hearted, fearfulness shall surprise you, and the terror of the
Lord of Hosts shall compass you about; I am moved to salute you all with this
as a warning and when it comes to pass remember you have been told; ye that
know not the kingdom of the most high ruling men, but are saying in your
hearts this has my hand done, in a moment shall you be smitten, and know there
is one above you which must rule, for it his right to rule over all nations,
and there shall be no King, but Jesus the anointed of God, nor no government,
but the government of the Lamb, there shall be no more wars, but war against
the Dragon, who has stood to devour the man-child, which is now bringing
forth, and he must rule with his iron rod, and shall subdue all under his feet;
We whom God has warned cannot but warn you of these things, whith are to come
to pass; he is coming to separate betwixt the just, and the unjust, he will
gather from among you, that the wicked may be consumed from off the face of the
earth.

All you Rulers in the world, I warn you all, take heed how you persecute such
as comes to warn you, who brings this message to you, least you add sin to
sin, till there be no place found for repentance; for ye shall all know our God
is the true God that made heaven and earth, before whose presence all flesh
must come to judgment.

By a Friend unto the Creation. E. B.

FINIS.
