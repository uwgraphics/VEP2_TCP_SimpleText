For spite and ill fortune the Husband did send:
Then let the Town, etc.
Who knocking in have,

They used no delay,
for he quickly creept in,
Where close down he lay,
and she then shut him in:
Then the Baker being entered, cried boy come away,
And thus to his wife he began for to say:
Then let the Town, etc.
Od's me I Am afraid
I have over slipped my hour,
My Customers staid,
and my Yeast will be sour:
Put fire in the Oven, i will quickly despatch,
E're that be well heat, i will have made up my batch:
Then let the Town, etc.
He threw in a Baven,
well lighted and dry,
E're another he had in,
the Bully did cry:
Well singed, and thus frighted, the Lover did crawl,
From out of the Oven, and down he did fall:
Then let the Town, etc.
The Baker enraged
at what he had spied,
With passion engaged,
and threw fear aside:
He took up a Cudgel and laid on such blows,
He made him run out without money or clothes:
Then let the Town Bulleys henceforth have a care,
Of a Bakers Revenge, or to deal with his Ware.
