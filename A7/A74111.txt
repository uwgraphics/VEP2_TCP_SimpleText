blazon of the City of London
By the Major.
WHereas by a Precept of the 29. of August last, which was awarded in pursuance
of an Order of Common Council that day made, it was required that the
Collectors for the Arrears of the Assessments for the Army under the command of
the Lord Fairfax, with the assistance of the Deputy and Common-councell-men of
every Ward should use their uttermost endeavors for the Collecting of the said
Arrears, and upon Saturday last should pay all moneys in their hands to the
Treasurers for that purpose; And that on this day return should be made to the
Grand Committee for the said Arrears of the Names of all persons that should
then owe any money upon the said Assessments, and the sums so by them owing,
in such manner, and to such purpose as in the said Precept and Order is
expressed: Now forasmuch as the said Deputies and Common-councell-men (as I am
informed) did make relation to the said Grand Committee of some proceedings
upon the said Precept toward the getting in of the said Arrears; and that more
would be done therein, if some further time were given, whereupon it was
thought fit by the said Grand Committee, That the said Collectors, Deputies,
and Common-councell-men should have time until Wednesday the 13. of this
present September, for the Collecting of the moneys so owing, and paying in of
the moneys then remaining in the Collectors hands, and making the return of
such as shall not pay their Assessments: And for the doing of the other things
thereby required to be done, with this intimation, that all persons concerned
therein, do perform their duties accordingly, without expectation of any
further time of forbearance. These are therefore once more to will and require
the said Collectors, with the assistance of the Deputy and Common-councell-men
within their several Divisions, to be very active and diligent in the
Collecting of the said several Assessments. And that the said Collectors, on,
or before Saturday next, do make up their Accounts concerning the same, with
the said Deputy and Common councellmen, or some of them, and pay in the money
then remaining in their hands to the Treasurers as aforesaid: And that the said
Deputy, Common-councell-men and Collectors do make return to the said Grand
Committee on Wednesday following of the Names of such persons within their Ward
as have not paid their said Assessments, and the sums by them owing, and the
reasons by them given why they do not pay the same. And if any of the said
Collectors shall be remiss and negligent in any of the said particulars
beforementioned, or shall not do their duties according to the several
Ordinances of Parliament in that behalf; that then the said Deputy and
Common-councell-men shall return their Names to the said Grand Committee, who
according to an Order of the honorable House of Commons, and special
directions of the Committee of that House are to make return to the said
Committee of Parliament, not only of the names of such persons as shall not
pay their said Arrears, but also of such Collectors, Common-councell-men and
others as shall fail in performance of their duties in this behalf to be
further proceeded against as their neglect therein shall demerit. And therefore
I require you to be careful therein, not only in regard of the present
pressing necessity for the money, but also for the preventing of further danger.
