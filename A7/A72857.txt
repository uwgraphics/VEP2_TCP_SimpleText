A Loue-sick maids song, lately beguild, By a runaway Lover that left her with
Child.
To the tune of, In Melton on a day.
ALas and well away,
that ere I trod on ground
To see this hapiesse day,
wherein such griefs abound.
Alas I cannot sleep,
my joys are clean exilde:
I cannot choose but weep,
because I was beguild.
When I oshuld take the meat,
that should my life sustain:
There is nothing that I eat,
but aggrauates my pain,
Oh, fie on him whose deed
does cause me thus complain
My heart within does bleed,
with sorrow grief and pain.
Ah, evil might he thrive,
that spoiled me of my health:
The cruelst wretch alive,
has me undone by stealth.
For where I lived a maid,
a maiden in good fame,
He has me now betrayde,
and brought me unto shame.
My maidenhead is lost,
oh, cursed be the hour:
When he that loved me most:
should seek me to deflower.
Now am I great with child,
as great as I may go:
He that has me beguild,
a way is gone me fro.
And left me here alone,
within this desert place:
To wail and make my moan,
O most distressed case.
What shall of me betide,
none but the Lord does know:
He that should be my guide,
has left me here in woe.
Ye winds resound my cries,
within the Misers ears:
That he with watery eyes,
may shed his brinish tears.
To wail the late done deed.
that he committed have:
Or else to come with speed,
my babe and me to save.
The trees can witness well,
my privy grief and pain:
These Rocks and stones can tell
the sorrows I substaine
My meat is hawes and hips,
my drink is water clear:
Naught else my tender lips,
have tasted this half year.
O whelpe of Tigers brood,
could thou find in thy heart,
With her that did thee good,
to play so lewd a part.
Woe worth me poor woman,
that did thee always help,
And cursed be the Dam,
brought forth so bad a whelp.
Thou had me at thy call,
as hawks are at the lure:
My self, my goods and all,
and what I might procure.
Thou had it at thy need,
I never said thee nay,
To stand thee ought in steed,
or help thee any way.
And now thou do requite,
this love I bear to thee:
With deadly deep dispite,
as now I plainly see.
To leave me comfortless,
my luklesse state to rue:
Thou can not say no less,
but thou have beu vatrue.
Woe worth the time that I
gave credit to thy words:
For now I platnely try,
thou bushes give for birds.
Woe worth those fained tears,
which thou have often spent:
They brought me in the dryers
which make me now lament.
O would to God I had
not known thy perjured face:
I might have then been glad,
where now I reap alas.
For I did never offend,
before that time with thee:
Nor never did intend,
to spot my chastity.
But since no words will serve,
to counteruaile thine act:
And that thou do deserve,
hell torments for thy fact.
I will hold me contont,
till that I breathe my last:
I cannot now briuent,
the thing is done and past.
Ye maids be warnd by me,
let no such cogging mates,
Spot your virginity,
by any subtle feats.
Least in the end you say,
and sing as now I do:
Alas and well away,
we are beguiled too.
Consider words are wind,
or of small force at least:
And men are most unkind,
I speak probatum est.
There is no truoch in men,
the best is all to had:
Who trusts their dealings then
I hold them worse than mad.
Who trusts to rotten boughs
shall fall ere they bewares:
Who credites feigned vows:
are sonest brought to care.
My self may justly say.
I proved it to my pain:
I never saw the day,
but words and deeds were twain
And thus to end my song,
I wish you all beware,
And of the flattering tongue,
to have a special care.
Keep well your honest name,
as the apple of your eye,
So shall your lasting fame.
remain eternally.
