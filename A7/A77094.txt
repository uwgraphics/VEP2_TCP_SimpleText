BO-PEEP, OR THE JERKING PARSON Catechizing his MAID;
A pleasant BALLAD to the Tune of Notcrof's Delight.
When Oliver that Imp of Mars
did rule the English land,
And London trembled at his force
from Algate to the strand;
Disorders did there
Most frequent appear,
As by this one you will understand.
There was a Parson (so it is said)
a Crafty one I wot,
Who in his house a pretty maid
for exercise had got:
Upon every fault
She did, she was brought
Coram nobis, and went to the pot.
He catechized early and late,
and to her duty firkt her,
Well could he preach, well could he prate,
for he is an able jerker:
Before and behind
'twixt water and wind
He fetched her up stiffly, and yerkt her.
The man was a man of conscience,
and guided by the spirit
To handle the flesh of the wench,
according to her merit:
The flesh being proud,
Though sh'e were but a dowd,
He knew the way well how to curry't.
Reproof with a cudgel breaks bones,
and other weapons gash;
A rod is a tool for the nonce,
that gives the gentle slash:
The girl was but young,
And shame ties her tongue,
Whilst he brings her under the lash.
For breaking of commandments,
of which there was no lack,
She Is punished to all intents
by the little man in black.
Though n'ere so demure,
Her coats fly up sure
As she has a coat to her back.
When table was not rubbed bright
(which handkercheif did try)
Or any thing not set to right,
belongs to huswifery;
He took up her smock,
And he lash't her nock,
And corrected her zealously.
Sabbath-neglects he is sure to pay,
though to a Sabbath breach;
For prating once whilst he did pray,
he fetched up the poor wretch:
And he set the fool
on the penitent stool,
Whilst he a private Lecture preached.
One time above all was very sad,
(upon some small omission.)
The custom of women then she had,
(a pitiful condition)
Yet he administers
The usual glisters;
For he is her ghostly physician.
Although she cry out, and lament,
though down she falls, and kneels,
Yet he knows not how to releat,
and no compassion feels:
For it was his use
To take no excuse,
Till he saw blood run down her heels.
SOme question the man's discretion
to meddle thus with his maid,
And think it a forward passion,
that put him on this trade:
It being's wif'es place;
Since Mol, Peg, and Grace
By Mistresses hand should be paid.
True, had his wife bin very young,
a brave and lusty pudge,
In hand as able as in tongue,
he need not played the drudge.
But sh^'s very old,
As I have been told,
Which made the man to the work trudge.
Wherefore to spare his consorts arm,
and her two pair of eyes,
Which could have done the wench no harm;
He t'execution hies.
With vigorous might
And a nimble sight
To look babies in the maids thighs.
But the wicked do fleer and mock,
and tauntingly give out,
The Parson sure is a smell-smock:
now fie, ungodly rout,
Did he but hear,
He Would teach you to jeer,
And indite you all the other bout.
Indeed, I confess, were his tail
as hot as his head the while;
With a wench he would play truss a fail,
soon as any within a mile:
But he of all sure
Cannot the smock endure,
'Bout surplice he keeps such a coile.
If Babylon's whore her self
should come a cross his way,
Be she n'ere so gallant. the elf
would trounce her fine array.
For when he is vexed
And a breech is his text,
He Will be sure to claw it away.
Every stroke he aimed aright
the wench he never mist her.
He laid on blows with all his might,
nor used her like a sister:
His arm had a spring,
And so freely did fling,
That every jerk raised a blister.
As the devil in his wild fits
hugged the witch, so he did hug her
He stung her with unlucky hits:
I shall not speak to in mugger,
He has got the odds
Of westminster rods,
Though managed by black Jack Bugger.
He Is a friend of the Kings he brags,
as back-friend to all rumps;
He Would taw'd Bum politic to jags.
and put um to their trumps:
Hewsons strap, Prides sling,
Could not give the ding
As his rod, which he wore to the stumps.
Let none doubt the truth of this story,
although it seem absurd:
Much truer it is then John Dory,
for it is upon record:
When were it not for Pack,
The Presbyter Jack
Had paid for his peeping, I heard.
A trial there was in guild hall,
I shall not, readers, jobe ye;
Court set, the maid swore point-blanck; all
the people shouted, Ho boy!
he was in a shrape,
he could hardly escape,
For tickling the Apocryphal Toby.
Her dying mothers oath came in,
which witnessed the same;
His wives oath though, if not from sin,
yet saved him from the shame:
For the parish Pope
Can give himself scope
To cog a die in an ill game.
One word to the vestry let me speak,
one word, I say, or twain,
Ere my discourse I off do break.
for parson whipsters gain,
That you him prefer
To be Lecturer
To London-maids in Birchen-lane.
