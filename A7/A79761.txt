A Solemn Acknowledgement of public Sins and Breaches of the Covenant; And a
solemn Engagement to all the Duties contained therein, namely those which do
in a more special way relate unto the dangers of these times.
WE Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses, Ministers of the Gospel, and
Commons of all sorts within this Kingdom, by the good hand of GOD upon us,
taking into serious consideration the many sad afflictions and deep distresses
wherewith we have been exercised for a long time past, and that the Land after
it has been sore wasted with the Sword and the Pestilence, and threatened with
Famine, and that shame and contempt has been poured out from the Lord against
many thousands of our Nation who did in a sinful way make War upon the
Kingdom of England, contrary to the Testimony of his Servants and desires of
his People, and that the remnants of that Army returning to this Land have
spoiled and oppressed many of our Brethren, and that the Malignant party is
still numerous, and retaining their former principles wait for an opportunity
to raise a new and dangerous War, not only unto the rending of the bowels of
this kingdom, but unto the dividing us from England, and overturning of the
work of God in all the three Kingdoms: And considering also that a cloud of
calamities does still hang over our heads and threaten us with sad things to
come, We cannot but look upon these things as from the Lord who is righteous in
all his ways feeding us with the bread of tears, and making us to drink the
waters of affliction until we be taught to know how evil and bitter a thing
it is to depart away from him, by breaking the Oath and Covenant which we have
made with him, and that we may be humbled before him by confessing our sin,
and forsaking the evil of our way.

Therefore being pressed with so great necessities and straits, and warranted
by the word of God, and having the example of Gods people of old, who in the
time of their troubles, and when they were to seek delivery and aright way for
themselves, that the Lord might be with them to prosper them, did humble
themselves before him, and make a free and particular confession of the sins
of their Princes their Rulers, their Captains, their Priests and their people,
and did engage themselves to do no more so, but to reform their ways and be
steadfast in his Covenant; And remembering the practice of our predecessors in
the year 1596. Wherein the General Assembly, and all the Kirk Judicatories,
with the concurrence of many of the Nobility, Gentry and Burgesses, did with
many tears acknowledge before God the breach of the National Covenant, and
engaged themselves to a Reformation, even as our predecessors and theirs had
before done in the General Assembly and convention of Estates in the year
1567. And perceiving that this duty, when gone about out of conscience and in
sincerity, has always been attended with a reviving out of troubles, and with
a blessiing and success from Heaven; We do humbly and sincerely as in his
sight, who is the searcher of hearts, acknowledge the many sins and great
transgressions of the Land; We have done wickedly, our Kings, our Princes, our
Nobles, our Judges, our Officers, our Teachers, and our People: Albeit the lord
has long and clearly spoken unto us we have not hearkened to his voice,
Albeit he has followed us with tender mercies we have not been allured to wait
upon him and walk in his way; And though he has stricken us, yet we have not
grieved: Nay though he has consumed us, we have refused to receive correction;
We have not remembered to render unto the Lord according to his goodness and
according to our own vows and promises, but have gone away backward by a
continued course of backsliding, and have broken all the Articles of that
solemn League and Covenant which we swore before God, Angels and men.

Albeit there be in the land many of all ranks, who be for a Testimony unto the
Truth, and for a name of joy and praise unto the Lord by living godly, studying
to keep their garments pure, and being steadfast in the Covenant and cause of
God; Yet we have reason to acknowledge that most of us have not endeavored
with that reality sincerety and constancy, that did become us, to preserve the
work of Reformation in the Kirk of Scotland; Many have satisfied themselves
with the purity of the Ordinances neglecting the power thereof; yea, some have
turned aside to crooked ways destructive to both. The profane, loose and
insolent carriage of many in our Armies, who went to the Assistance of our
BRETHREN in ENGLAND, And the tamperings and unstraight dealing of some of our
Commissioners and others of our Nation in London, the Isle of Wight and other
places of the Kingdom have proved great lets to the work of Reformation, and
settling of Kirk-Government there, whereby Error and Schism in that Land have
been increased, and Sectaries hardened in their way. We have been so far from
endeavoring the extirpation of Profaneness, and what is contrary to the power
of godliness, that prophanity has been much winked at and Profane persons
much countenanced and many times employed until iniquity and ungodliness has
gone over the face of the land as a flood; Nay, sufficient care has not been
had to separate betwixt the precious and the vile, by debarring from the
Sacrament all ignorant and scandalous persons according to the Ordinances of
this Kirk.

Neither have the Privileges of the Parliaments and Liberties of the Subject
been duly tendered, But some amongst our selves have labored to put into the
hands of our King an arbitrary and unlimited power destructive to both, And
many of us have bin accessory of late to those means and ways whereby the
freedom and privileges of Parliaments have been incroacht upon and the
Subjects oppressed in their Consciences, persons and Estates: Neither has it
been our care to avoid these things which might harden the King in his evil
way; But upon the contrary he has not only been permitted, but many of us
have been isntrumental to make him exercise his power in many things tendering
to the prejudice of Religion and of the Covenant, and of the Peace and saftie
of these Kingdoms; Which is so far from the right way of preserving his
Majesty's Person and Authority, that if cannot but provoke the Lord against him
unto the hazard of both, nay under a pretense of relieving and doing for the
King whilst he refuses to do what was necessary for the house of God, some have
ranversed and violated most of all the Articles of the Covenant.

Our own consciences within, and Gods judgments upon us without do convince
us of the manifold wilful renewed breaches of that Article which concerns
the discovery and punishment of Malignants, whose crimes have not only been
connived at but dispensed with and pardoned, and themselves received into
intimate fellowship with our selves, and entrusted with our Counsels, admitted
unto our Parliaments, and put in places of power and Authority for managing the
public affairs of the Kingdom, Whereby in Gods justice they got at last
into their hands the whole power and strength of the Kingdom, both in
judicatories and Armies, And did employ the same unto the enacting and
prosecuting an unlawful engagement in war against the Kingdom of England,
Notwithstanding of the dissent of many considerate members of Parliament, who
have given constant proof of their integrity in the cause from the beginning,
of many faithful testimonies and free warnings of the servants of God, of the
Supplycations of many Synods, Presbyteries and Shyres, and of the Declarations
of the General Assembly and their Commissioners to the contrary: Which
engagement as it has been the cause of much sin, so also of much misery and
calamity unto this Land, and holds forth to us the griveousnesse of our sin
of complying with Malignants in the greatness of our judgment, that we may be
taught never to split again upon the same rock, upon which the Lord has set
so remarkable a Beacon. And after all that is come to pass unto us because of
this our trespass, and after that grace has been showed unto us from the Lord
our God by breaking these men's yoke from of our necks and putting us again
into a capacity to act for the good of Religion, our own safety and the Peace
and safety of this Kingdom, should we again break his Commandment and
Covenant by joining once more with the people of these abominations, and taking
into our bosom those Serpents which had formerly stung us almost unto death:
This as it should argue great madness and folly upon our part, So no doubt, if
it be not avoided, will provoke the Lord against us to consume us until there
be no remnant nor escaping in the Land.

And albeit the Peace and Union betwixt the Kingdoms be a great blessing of
God unto both and a Bond which we are obliged to preserve unviolated, and to
endeavor that justice may be done upon the opposers thereof; Yet some in this
Land who have come under the bond of this Covenant have made it their great
studdy how to dissolve this union, and few or no endeavors have been used by
any of us for punishing of such.

We have suffered many of our Brethren in several parts of the Land to be
oppressed of the common enemy without compassion or relief; There has been
great murmuring and repining, because of expense of means and pains in doing of
our duty; Many by persuasion or terror, have suffered themselves to be divided
and withdrawn to make defection to the contrary part, Many have turned off to a
detestable indifferency and neutrality in this cause, which so much concerns
the glory of God and the good of these Kingdoms, Nay many have made it their
study to walk so, as they might comply with all times and all the revolutions
thereof. It has not been our care to countenance, encourage, entrust and
employ such only, as from their hearts did affect and mind Gods work; But the
hearts of such many times have been discouraged, and their hands weakened,
their sufferings neglected, and themselves slighted, and many who were once
open enemies and always secret underminers countenanced and employed, Nay even
those who had been looked upon as Incendiaries, and upon whom the Lord had set
marks of desperare Malignancy, falsehood, and deceit, were brought in, as fit to
manage public affairs; Many have been the lets and Impediments that have been
cast in the way to retard and obstruct the Lords work, and some have kept
secret, what of themselves they were not able to suppress and overcome.

Besides these and many other breaches of the Articles of the Covenant in the
matter thereof, which it concerns every one of us to search out and
acknowledge before the Lord, as we would wish his wrath to be turned away from
us; So have many of us failed exceedingly in the manner of our following and
pursuing the duties contained therein, not only seeking great things for our
selves, and mixing of private interests and ends concerning our selves and
friends and followers, with those things which concern the public good, but
many times preferring such to the Honor of God and good of his cause, and
retarding Gods work until we might carry along with us our own interests and
designs. It has been our way to trust in the means and to rely upon the arm
of flesh for success, Albeit the Lord has many times made us meet with
disapointment therein, and stained the pride of all our Glory, by blasting
every carnal confidence unto us: We have followed for the most part the
counsels of flesh and blood, and walked more by the rules of policy then
Piety, and have hearkened more unto men then unto God.

Albeit we made solemn public profession before the World of our unfeigned
desires to be humbled before the Lord for our own sins, and the sins of these
Kingdoms, especially for our undervaluing of the inestimable benefit of the
Gospel, and that we have not labored for the power thereof, and received
Christ into our hearts, and walked worthy of him in our lives, and of our true
and unfeigned purpose, desire and endeavor for our selves, and all others under
our power and charge both in public and private, in all duties which we owe to
God and man, to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the
example of a real Reformation, that the Lord might turn away his wrath and
heavy indignation, and establish these Kirks and Kingdoms in truth and peace;
Yet we have refused to be reformed, and have walked proudly and obstinately
against the Lord, not valuing his Gospel, nor submitting our selves unto the
obedience thereof, not seeking after Christ, nor studying to honor him in the
excellency of his person, nor employ him in the virtue of his offices, not
making conscience of public Ordinances nor private nor secret duties, nor
studying to edify one another in love. The ignorance of God and of his Son
prevails exceedingly in the Land; The greatest part of Masters of families
amongst Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgesses and Commons, neglect to seek God
in their families, and to endeavor the Reformation thereof; And albeit it has
been much pressed, yet few of our Nobles and great ones ever to this day could
be persuaded to perform family duties themselves and in their own persons;
which makes so necessary and useful a duty to be misregarded by others of
inferior rank; Nay many of the Nobility, Gentry, and Burrows who should have
been examples of godliness and sober walking unto others, have been
ringleaders of excess and rioting. Albeit we be the Lords people engaged to
him in a solemn way, yet to this day we have not made it our study that
judicatories and Armies should consist of, and places of power and trust be
filled with men of a blameless and Christian conversation, and of known
integrity and approven fidelity, affection and zeal unto the cause of God, but
not only those who have been neutrall and indifferent, but disaffected and
Malignant, and others who have been profane and scandalous have been
entrusted; By which it has come to pass that judicatories have been the seats
of injustice and iniquity, and many in our Armies by their miscarriages have
become our plague unto the great prejudice of the cause of God, the great
scandal of the Gospel, and the great increase of looseness and prophanity
throughout all the Land. It were impossible to reckon up all the abominations
that are in the Land, but the Blaspheming of the name of God, swearing by the
Creatures, profanation of the Lords Day, uncleanness, drunkenness, excess
and rioting, vanity of apparel, lying and deceit, railing and cursing,
arbitrary and uncontrolled oppression, and grinding of the faces of the poor by
Landlords and others in place and power are become ordinary and common sins;
And besides all these things there be many other transgressions, whereof the
Land wherein we live are guilty: All which we desire to acknowledge and to be
humbled for, that the world may bear witness with us, that Righteousness
belongs unto God, and shame and confusion of face unto us as appears this day.

And because it is needful for these who find mercy, not only to confess
but also to forsake their sin, Therefore that the reality and sincerity of our
repentance may appear, We do resolve and solemnly engage our selves before the
Lord carefully to avoid for the time to come all these offenses, whereof we
have now made solemn public acknowledgement, and all the snares and tentations
which tend thereunto: And to testify the integrity of our resolution herein,
and that we may be the better enabled in the power of the Lords strength to
perform the same, We do again renew our Solemn League and Covenant, Promising
hereafter to make conscience of all the duties whereunto we are obliged in all
the heads and Articles there of, particularly of these which follow.

1. Because Religion is of all things the most excellent and precious, The
advancing and promoving the power thereof against all ungodliness and
profanity, The securing and preserving the purity thereof against all error,
heresy, and schism, and namely, Independency, Anabaptism, Antinomianism,
Arminianism, Socinianism, Familism, Libertinism, Skepticism, and Erastianism,
and the carrying on the work of uniformity shall be studied and endeavored by
us before all worldly interests, whether concerning the King or our selves, or
any other whatsoever.

2. Because many have of late labored to supplant the liberties of the Kirk,
we shall maintain and defend the Kirk of Scotland, in all her liberties and
privileges, against all who shall oppose or undermine the same, or encroach
thereupon under any pretext whatsoever.

3. We shall vindicate and maintain the liberties of the Subjects in all these
things which concern their consciences, persons and Estates.

4. We shall carefully maintain and defend the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and
avoid every thing that may weaken the same, or involve us in any measure of
accession unto the guilt of those who have invaded the Kingdom of England.

5. As we have been always Loyal to our King, so we shall still endeavor to
give unto God that which is Gods, and to Caesar the things which are Cesars,

6. We shall be so far from conniving at, complying with, or countenancing of
Malignancy, injustice, iniquity, prophanity and impiety, that we shall not
only avoid, and discountenance those things, and cherish and encourage these
persons who are zealous for the Cause of God, and walk according to the Gospel;
But also shall take a more effectual course then heretofore in our respective
Places and Callings, for punishing and suppressing these evils, and faithfully
endeavor that the best and fittest remedies may be applied for taking away the
causes thereof, and advancing the knowledge of God, and Holiness and
Righteousness in the Land. And therefore in the last place, as we shall
earnestly pray unto God that he would give us able men fearing God, men of
truth and hating covetousness to judge and bear charge among his people, so we
shall according to our Places and Callings Endeavor that Judicatories and all
places of power and trust both in Kirk and State may consist of, and be filled
with such men as are of known good affection to the cause of God, and of a
blameless and Christian conversation.

And because there be many, who heretofore have not made conscience of the oath
of God, but some through fear, others by persuasion and upon base ends and
humane interests have entered thereunto, who have afterward discovered
themselves to have dealt deceitfully with the Lord in swearing falsely by his
name, Therefore we who do now renew our Covenant in reference to these duties
and all other duties contained therein, Do in the sight of him who is the
searcher of hearts solemnly Profess that it is not upon any politic
advantage or private interest or by-end, or because of any terror or
persuasion from men, or hypocritically and deceitfully, that we do again take
upon us the oath of God, But honestly and sincerely and from the sense of our
duty, And that therefore denying our selves and our own things, and laying
aside all self interest and ends, We shall above all things seek the honor of
God, the good of his Cause, and the wealth of his people, and that forsaking
the counsels of flesh and blood, and not leaning upon carnal confidences, we
shall depend upon the Lord, walk by the rule of his word, and hearken to the
voice of his servants: In all which professing our own weakness We do
earnestly pray to God who is the father of mercies, through his Son Jesus
Christ, to be merciful unto us, and to enable as by the power of his might,
that we may do our duty unto the praise of his Grace in the Churches. Amen.

Edinburgh, 6. October. 1648. post meridiem. Act for renewing of the Solemn
League and Covenant.
THe Commission of the General Assembly considering that a great part of this
Land have involved themselves in many and gross breaches of the Solemn League
and Covenant, And that the hands of many are grown slack in following and
pursuing the duties contained therein, And that many who not being come to
sufficient age, when it was first sworn and subscribed, have not hithertills
been received into the same, Do upon these and other grave and important
considerations, Appoint and Ordain the Solemn League and Covenant to be renewed
throughout all the Congregations of this Kingdom; And because it is a duty of
great weight and consequence, Ministers after the sight hereof would be
careful to take pains in their Doctrine, and otherwise, that their people may
be made sensible of these things wherein they have broken the Covenant, and be
prepared for the renewing thereof with suitable affections and dispositions: And
that these things may be the better performed, we have thought it necessary
to condescend upon a solemn acknowledgement of public sins and breaches of
the Covenant, and a solemn Engagement to all the duties contained therein,
Namely, those which do in a more special way relate unto the dangers of these
times: And this solemn acknowledgement and Engagement sent herewith shall be
made use of, And the League and Covenant shall be renewed in such manner as
follows. First, There shall be intimation of a solemn public humiliation and
Fast the second Sabbath of December, To be kept upon the next Thursday and
Lords day thereafter, At which intimation the League and Covenant, and the
public acknowledgement of sins and Engagement unto duties are to be
publicly read by the Minister in the audience of all the people, And they are
to be exhorted to get copies thereof, that they may be made acquainted
therewith; And the Humiliation and Fast is to be kept the next Thursday
thereafter, in reference to the breaches of the Covenant contained in the
solemn public acknowledgement, as the causes thereof, And the next Lords day
thereafter, which is also to be spent in public Humiliation and fasting,
immediately after the Sermon, which is to be applied to the business of that
day, The public acknowledgement and Engagement is again to be publicly read,
And thereafter prayer is to be made, containing the confession of the breaches
mentioned therein, and begging mercy for these sins, and strength of God for
renewing the Covenant in sincerity and Truth; After which Prayer, the solemn
League and Covenant is to be read by the Minister, And then to be sworn by him
and all the people, who are to engage themselves for performance of all the
duties contained therein, Namely, these which are mentioned in the public
acknowledgement and Engagement, and are opposite unto the sins therein
confessed: And the action is to be closed with Prayer to God, that his people
may be enabled in the power of his strength to do their duty, according to
their Oath now renewed in so solemn a way. It is also hereby provided, that all
those who renew the League and Covenant, shall again subscribe the same, And
that none be admitted to the renewing or subscribing thereof, who are excluded
by the other act and direction sent herewith.

Edinb. 6 October, Post meridiem. Act concerning the debarring of Persons
accessorie to the late unlawful Engagement in War, from renewing the Covenant,
receiving the Communion, and from exercise of Ecclesiasticke Office, with an
advice to Presbyteries for celebration of the Communion.
THE Commissioners of the General Assembly having found it necessary that the
solemn League and Covenant be renewed after so great and evident breaches
thereof by many in this Kingdom: And considering how manifestly the Cause of
God has been endangered heretofore by too sudden receiving unto the Covenant
those who have been in actual opposition thereunto, before sufficient trial
and evidence had of their repentance: Do therefore appoint and Ordain, That
all Presbyteries and Ministers within this Church in their several bounds and
respective charges take special care at the time of renewing the League and
Covenant, That none who have had charge in the Army, which under the conduct of
Duke Hamilton engaged in War against the Kingdom of England, or with the
Forces that were in and about Stirling under the command of the Earl of Lanerk
and George Monro, or have taken and subcribed any Oaths, Bands or Declarations
for carrying on these sinful courses, or any other Oath or Band condemned by
the General Assembly as destructive to the Covenant, Or have been forcers,
urgers or seducers of others to join in the said Engagements and services so
destructive to Religion, or have been active promoters thereof, be admitted to
subcribe, or renew the Oath of the League and Covenant, or to exercise any
office or power in any of the Judicatories of this Kirk.

And further, considering that it is referred to us from the late General
Assembly to give advertisement to the Presbyteries of a fit opportunity of
celebrating the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and to send such advice as we
should find necessary for the time; We have thought fit to advertise
Presbyteries, That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper may be celebrated after
the renewing of the Covenant as Ministers have convenience in their several
Congregations; And that we have found it necessary that all who are involved in
the aforementioned guiltiness, be suspended from the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper until the General Assembly shall take such course as they think fit,
concerning the receiving of them unto the Covenant and Communion.

A. Ker.

Edinburgh, 14 October 1648.
THE Committee of Estates being very sensible of the grievous backslidings of
this Land in the manifold breaches of the Solemn League and Covenant, made and
sworn to the most high GOD: Do therefore unanimously and heartily approve the
seasonable and pious resolution of the Commission of the General Assembly; for
a Solemn Acknowledgement of public Sins and Provocations, especially the
breaches of the Covenant, and a Solemn Engagement to a more conscionable
performance of the Duties therein contained, and for renewing the Solemn
League and Covenant: And do require and Ordain, that the directions of the
said Commission of Assembly in their Act of the sixth of this Month for a
public Acknowledgment of Sins and Engagement to Duties be carefully
followed, that the Fast and Humiliation appointed by them be Religiously
observed, and that the Solemn League and Covenant be sincerely and cordially
renewed and subscribed in the manner they have prescribed in their said Act.
