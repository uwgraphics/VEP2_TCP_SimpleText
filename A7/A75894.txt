An Admiration by way of Answer to the Petition of the Rebels in Ireland.

To all true hearted Protestants, why the Rebels in Ireland should petition to
his Majesty to transport themselves into England to aid and assist him, and by
strength to carry on his designs until they arrive at a prosperous end, and
that they joining with the Papists here in England, which are a great and
considerable number, do not doubt but to curb the insolences of the
Protestants.

Whereunto is adjoined the exact Copy of the Petition to the Kings Majesty by
the Rebels in Ireland, subscribed by 11. Lords, and others of quality;
Examined by the Original by a person of honor there, being intercepted, was
sen over to two Members of the House of Commons

Dated the 17. of August, 1642.

An Admiration (by way of answer) to the Petition of the Rebels in Ireland to
all true hearted Protestants, etc.
IT is the nature of Truth that though it be long suppressed and obscured with
humane policy, yet being gotten out of the clouds, it shines with clear beams,
and does appear more evedently to every common understanding, so that the guard
which his Majesty is pleased to raise in the the North, does now seem to be an
army against Parliament, and shows what was in the thoughts of His evil
Counselors, before Hull or the Militia or any thing of that nature was in
question. And besides there are many reasons to fortify opinions, that the
Rebellion in Ireland was a plot deeply laid, they grounding their confidence
on a true supposition that their design was favored by some chief persons of
England, and by their bold carriage therein have drawn the King into the
suspicion of a newtrality or at least a coldness in the Protestant Religion,
confirmed since by his adheering to the Counsel of the Malignant party, being
most of them Papists, for is it not a miracle that a King who might be so
strong in the affections of his Subjects, should endeavor to persecute his
subjects with the destroying sword, and to make them suffer in his undeserved
displeasure, by laying close siege unto diverse Towns and Cities, and
battering them with Cannons. How clear and free from aspersion might he be if
he would embrace the love of his Subjects? how safe from transporting errors,
if he would confide in the knowledge and uprightness of his loyal
Parliament? while on the contrary, being violently led on by pernicious
Counselors, his actions do not redound to the improvement of his Royal
dignity, but only to the increasing of the fears, jealousies, and amazements of
this Kingdom, who though loath to offend through remerity of judgment, yet,
when the appearance in what a strange way of violence matters have been
carried, though the Parliament has with all humility besought a reconcilement,
and how the ill-affected party has embe^^^^ed His Majesty in the cruelty of a
civil war, the ^enesse whereof kill and disanimate the hearts of all true
loving Subjects, these considerable reasons have plunged many into distracted
opinions, as that the Parliaments destruction under a colorable and close
pretense, has bin the intended aim of many precedent actions, that Hull and
the Militia were not the chief grounds of distance between the King and
Parliament, but that something else of more high consequence did foment and
cherish this separation, and made the disaffected party withdraw the K. to
remote parts, there to ripen designs, which being formerly premeditated do now
break out with apparent violence, it being very difficult to hide affection
though shadowed under the fairest pretenses. But that which does beget the
greatest and newest admiration, is, that the rebels in Ireland should proceed
to such a miraculous boldness, that being not contented to have perpetrated
such unheard of cruelties against the English, to have made mothers spectators
of their own childrens murder, to have showed their inveterate tyranny in the
bloody masacre massacre of the Protestants, making the whole Land to overflow
with innocent blood, what blinded presumption should make them dare to become
petitioners unto the King in such an audacious manner as they have lately done,
for it is most certain that being led on with a hope that thereafter will be
seasonable according to the distractions of the present estate of England, they
have adventured with a world of impudence to present unto the K. a disgraceful
tender of their service, that seeing his Majesty is engaged in a civil war,
and by diverse reasons necessitated thereunto, they would beseech his gracious
favor to accept of their good wills in assisting him against his Parliament and
Subjects, and knowing that their miseries hitherto endured were not by his
Majesty procured nor altogether allowed, they in all willing obedience to
vindicate the Kings honor, and advance ^ll his ^roceedings and intents, will
be ready, if his Majesty would give them leave, to transport themselves over
into England, so to aid and assist his Majesty, and by strength to carry on all
his designs til they arrive at a prosperous end, and that they joining with the
Papists here in England (which are a great and considerable number) do not
doubt but to curb the insolence of the Protestants, to plant again the
despised popish Religion, to reunite to all the errors of the Church unto the
Catholic unity, to vindicate the Kings supremacy, and stare him in an
unlimited arbitr^ry government. Thus much in effect the Rebels of Ireland do
intimate to the King by way of petition, and whence this boldness should
proceed is doubtful to imagine, unless some secret familiarity with the Kings
inclination gave them this confidence, how can they that are rebels condemned
to the Kings mercy, presume to offer him the help of their hands in a warlike
assistance, who have already by their Rebellion forfeited their heads, this
seems most strange, neither can the wonder be taken off, unless it be
admitted that they have some ground to hope that their offer should be
accepted, but how they should proceed to present this petition to the Kings
Majesty is full of mystery, and does discover many close affections and
conceal contrivances of policy, and does imply that they have some reason
unto them formerly known, which makes the popish cruel Rebels to prostrate
their service to the King, in a bold and unexpected manner in the form of the
aforesaid petition.

A true Copy of the Petition of the Rebels in Ireland, subscribed by 11.
Lords. and others of quality among them; Attested to be an exact Copy, being
examined with the Original by a person of Honor there, when it was
intercepted; and sent over unto two Members of the House in Letters, dated the
17 of August 1642.
To the Kings most Excellent Majesty, The humble Petition of the Catholics of
IRELAND.
Most Sacred and Dread Sovereign,
We your most loyal and Obedient Subjects, whom it nearest concerns to
preserve the Rights and Prerogatives of Your Crown firm and entire, as
yielding us a just and merciful protection against the security of our penal
Laws. In maintenanne of that power the birthright of Kings, kept unblemisht
for You by Your famous Ancestors, we have had recourse to Arms, to that end
only, that You our Gracious Sovereign, with all the preeminences due and
derived unto You, by a long succession of Monarchs, might alone Reign over us:
And we in the just freedom of Subjects (Independent of Jurisdiction not
derived from Your Majesty) live happily under any the Crown of England. Yet
lest these our intendments by the practice of our Adversaries might be
misrepresented unto You, and we enforced undeservedly to suffer in Your
Majesty's opinion, (which would be a burden more heavy unto us, than the sword
of our Adversaries, although daily imbrued in the blood of our wives and
children) we have often endeavored to have access to that Royal Throne,
which with the hazard of our Lives and Fortunes, we labor to maintain
glorious and unspoited.

Yet such is the unwearied watchfulness of our Adversaries, that all our
attempts are made frustrate; And now of late when by Lieutenant Colonel Read,
whom therefore we employed, because a stranges to our cause and Country, and so
likeliest to pass undiscovered, we sent our Petition. He poor Gentleman was
intercepted, and put to the torture of the Wrack, so as now it is beyond our
reach, and only in Your Power to provide that we may be heard by Your Majesty,
since we are so unhappy as that Your Majesty's resolution of coming into this
Your Kingdoms, met with greater diversions than the threats and menaces of the
Puritan party of the Parliament of England, who seek all things to limit You
our King, and to govern us Your Subjects.

That it would therefore please Your Majesty, to appoint some such way by which
with safety we may approach Your Royal presence, that so You may be informed
truly of the whole scope of our Resolutions, and we receive faithfully Your
Command.

And we, as our duty binds us, will ever pray f^^ Your Majesty's happy reign
over us.

FINIS.
