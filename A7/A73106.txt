A most excellent and famous Ditty of Sampson Judge of Israel, how he wedded ^
Philistines Daughter, who at length forsook him: also how he slew a Lion, and
propounded a Riddle, and after how he was falsely betrayed by Dalila, and of
his death.
To the tune of the Spanish Pauin.
When Sampson was a tell young man
His power and strength increased than,
And in the host and Tribe of Dan,
the Lord did bless him still.
It chancrd so upon a day,
As he was walking on his way,
He saw Maiden fresh and gay,
in Timnah.
With whom he fell so sore in love.
That he his fancy could not move:
His Parents therefore he did prove,
and craved their good wills.
I have found out a wise quoth he,
I pray you Father give her me,
Though she a strangers daughter be,
I pass not.
Then did bespeake his Parents dear,
Have we not many Maidens here,
Of Country, and acquaintance near,
for thee to love and like?
O no, (quoth Sampson presently)
Not one so pleasant in mine eye,
Whom I could find so faithfully
to fancy,
At length they granted their consent:
And so with Sampson forth they went,
To see the Maid was their intent.
which was so fair and bright:
But as they were a going there,
A Lion put them in great fear,
Whom Sampson presently did tear,
in pieces.
When they were come unto the place,
They were agreed the case:
The wedding day appointed was:
and when the time was come.
As Sampson went for beauties fees,
The Lions carcass there he sees,
Wherein a sort of hunny Bees
had swearmed.
Then closely Sampson went his way,
And not a word thereof did say,
Until the merry feasting day,
unto the company.
A Riddle I will show, quoth he,
The meaning if you tell to me
Within seven days, I will give ye
great riches.
But if the meaning you do miss,
And cannot show me what it is,
Then shall you give to me (I wisse)
so much as I have said.
Put forth thy Riddle (then quoth they)
And we will tell it by our day,
Or we will lose (as thou do say)
the wager.
Then mark (quoth he) the total sum,
Out of the eater meat did come,
And from the strong did sweetness run,
declare it if you can.
And when they heard the Riddle told,
Their hearts within them waxed cold:
For none of them could then unfold
the meaning.
Then unto Sampsons wife went they
And threatened her without delay,
If she would not the thing bewray,
to burn her Fathers house.
Then Sampsons wife with grief and woe,
Desired him the same to show:
And when she knew she straight did go
to tell them.
Then were they all full glad of this,
To tell the thing they did not miss,
What stronger beast then Lion is?
What sweeter meat then Hunny:
Then Sampson answered them full round:
If my Hayfar had not ploughed the ground,
So easily you had not found
my Riddle.
Then Sampson did his losses pay,
And to his father went his way*
But whilst with them he there did stay,
his wife forsook him quite.
And took another to her Love,
Which Samsons anger much did move,
To plague them therefore he did prove
his cunning.
A subtle sight he then had found,
To burn their corn upon the ground,
Their Vineyardes he destroyed round
which made them fret and fume.
But when they knew that Sampson he
Had done them all this injury,
Because his wife did him deny,
they killed her:
And afterward they had decreed,
To murder Sampson for that deed,
Three thousand men they sent with speed,
to bring him bound to them:
But he did break his cords apace,
And with the Iaw-bone of an Ass,
A thousand men ere he did pass,
he killed.
When all his foes were laid in dust,
Then Sampson was full sore athirst.
In God therefore was all his trust,
to help his fanting heart:
For liquor thereabout was none?
The Lord therefore from the Iaw-bone,
Did make fresh water spring alone,
to help him.
Then Sampson had a joyful spright,
And in a City lay that night,
Whereas his foes with deadly spite,
did seek his life to spill:
But he at midnight then awakes,
And tearing down the City gates,
With him away the same he takes,
most stoutly.
Then on Dalila fair and bright.
Did Sampson set his whole delight,
Whom he did love both day and night,
which wrought his overthrow:
For she with sweet words did entreat,
That for her sake he would repeat,
Wherein his strength, that was to great,
consisted.
At length unto his utter fall,
And through her suit, which was not small(...)
He did not let to show her all,
the secrets of his heart:
If that my hair be cut, (quoth he)
Which now so fair and long you see,
Liks other men then shall I be,
in weakness.
Then through deceit which was so deep,
She lulled Sampson fast asleep,
A man she called which she did keep,
to cut off all his hair.
Then did she call his hateful foes,
Ere Sampson from her lap arose,
Who could not the^ withstand their blow(...)
for weakness,
To bind him fast they did devise,
Then did they put out both his eyes.
In Prison woefully he lies,
and there he grinds the Mill.
But God remembered all his pain,
And did restore his strenght again,
Although that bound he did remain,
in Prison
The Philistines now were glad of this,
For joy they made a feast (I wisse)
And al their Princes did not miss
to come unto the same:
And being merry bent that day,
For Sampson they did send straightway
That they might laugh to see him play
among them
Then to the house was Sampson led
And when he had their fancies fed,
He plucked the house upon their head,
and down they tumbled all:
So that with grief and deadly pain,
Three thousand persons there were slain
Thus Sampson then with all his train,
was brained.
