An HYMN to the PARLIAMENT.
HOw great a crown of glory
Has God set on your Head!
And brought you into Story
Of all men to be read!
A thousand thousand Pages
Your Chronicle shall write,
And all ensuing ages
Shall read it with delight.
The work of Reformation,
And wonders of the wars
Shall ring, in acclamation,
Church-bels, above the stars.
And as you have ensured
A day to God in seven,
To you there is procured
An house of rest in Heaven.
Which for your faith and labor
Shall He, which glorious shone
With Moses on Mount Tabor,
Vouchsafe to Saints alone.
To the Reader.
REader, these Hymns or Songs of Praise, thou will find expressed in Scripture
phrase, in which those who are acquainted with that dialect (and can speak the
language of Canaan) do find more vigor and quickening then in any other words
or phrases of our own Composing: And they are published for the use of those
who use to praise the Lord with the words of David the sweet Singer of Israel,
and in the words of Asaph, Heman, Moses, and other holy men of God, who spoke
as they were directed by the Spirit of God. And they properly serve for the use
of those who can now sing the Songs of Sion in their own Land, and in their own
language, together with the Song of Moses and of the Lamb, And who can indeed
Rejoice now in this great Salvation, and serve the present Providence of their
God in their generation; who can sing with the Spirit, and who can sing with
understanding also; who can sing forth the high praises of God with their
mouth, and say, Awake my Glory: who can also sing with grace in their hearts,
to the Lord making melody: who can speak to themselves and also teach one
another in Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs: Who can sing unto the Lord
with the voice of a Psalm, who can come before his presence with a Song, and
show themselves glad in him with Psalms; who can make a joyful noise unto him
with Psalms: To such I say, Sing unto him, sing Psalms unto him, and talk of
all his wondrous works; for he has so done all his Wonderful Works that they
ought to be had in everlasting remembrance. O Let his Saints bless him, let
them now speak of the glory of his Kingdom and talk of his power, and make
known to the Sons of men his mighty Acts. And according to this Time, let it be
said of Jacob, and of Israel, (of Scotland and of England) What has God
Wrought? Lo, what has the Lord done, even in the valley of Decision? Behold
Multitudes, Multitudes of Enemies taken, and Multitudes slain in the valley of
Decision! There is none like unto the God of Jesurun, who rid upon the heaven
for our Help, and in his Excellency on the sky: The Eternal God was our
Refuge, and underneath us were his everlasting Arms: He did thrust out the
Enemy from before us, and did say, Destroy them: And are they not all scattered
and destroyed? and has not the Lord shut them up? Lo their Rock is not as our
Rock, even our Enemies themselves being Judges: O God, by terrible things in
righteousness did thou answer Us; Thy right hand is full of righteousness:
Let Mount Sion Rejoice, let the Daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy
Judgments: Let the Parliament of the Common Wealth of England, lift up their
Voices and say Hallelujah, let the Armies in Heaven that follow the Lamb, say
Hallelujah; let all that are a willing people in this day of Gods Power, say,
Amen, Hallelujah: and again let them say Hallelujah; for the Lord God
Omnipotent Reigns.

And sweetly raise my voice in praise,
to Isreal's Englands
God and King.
Verse. 9, 10.
My heart is towered the Governors,

His Titles are.
4.
Proud Pharaohs charets, lo, he down'd,
And all his host in Seas profound
His Captains famed,
Behold, even they were drowned ith sea,
The red Sea named.
5.
The depths devoured them every one,
They sank toth'bottom as a stone:
Lord, thy right hand
Has gained the tower and utmost power
Of high command.
6.
Lord, thy right hand exalted so,
Has dashed in pieces our proud foe,
In greatness great,
Thy hand o'rthrows thy rebel foes,
O rare defeat!
7.
Thou sentest forth thy fervent fume,
Which them, as stubble, did consume,
And all together,
Thy nostrils blast did gather fast
The waters thither.

The floods on heaps stood bolt upright,
The depths together did unite;
And all of these,
Together were congealed there,
Amid the Seas.

I will divide
The spoil, said he, my lust shall be

Most wondrous rare thy workings are
In all thy ways.

He is thy sword so much renowned,
And all these enemies of ours
To thee as liars shall be found,
And thou shall tred on their high towrs.
VI. Hymn, Celebrates the same. Ye children which.
Isai. 26.1 2, 4 5.
WE have a City very strong,
God sets salvation all along,
For walls and bulwarks every where;
Now open ye the gates for them
Of righteous Jerusalem,
Which keep the truth to enter there.
And since the Lord Jehovah is
The eternal Rock of strength to his,
In his great Name for ever trust:
He gives the proud the overthrow,
He lays the lofty City low,
Even to the ground, even to the dust.
2.
Yea Lord, Verse. 8, 10 11.
in thine own judgments way
We waited for thee every day:
Our Souls desire is to thy Name;
But let thy favor be declared
To wicked men, they will not regard,
Nor learn Religion by the same;
But most unjustly will transgress,
Even in the Land of uprightness;
And will not see Gods Majesty:
But they shall see, and see with shame,
And feel, as foes, thy fiery flame,
For envying our felicity.
3.
Lord, we have been with child in vain, Verse 18. and 12.

And we have been in grievous pain,
And (as it were) brought forth the wind
For by our power we have not wrought
The least deliverance can be thought,
In all the Earth, in any kind;
Nor have the inhabitants of the Earth
Fallen by the power that we put forth;
But by thy strength are undertrod;
For Lord thou will ordain (at last)
True peace for us, because thou have
Wrought all our works in us, O God.
Ver. 20, 21
4
O come my people, enter thou
Into thy secret chambers now,
And shut the doors about thee fast,
And hide thy self now, as it were,
But for a little moment there,
Until the wrath be over-past:
For lo the Lord comes from his place,
To punish this malignant race,
For wickedness that they maintain;
The Earth shall also now disclose
The bloodshed of our barbarous foes,
And shall no more conceal her slain.
VII. Hymn, Celebrates the same.
To any General Tune.
Psalm 105 Coll. from verse. 1. to 11. and Iam. 2.23.
GIve praises unto God the Lord,
and call upon his Name:

and spread his praise and fame.

and sing unto his praise,
And talk of all his wondrous works,
that he has wrought always.
2.
In honor of his holy Name,

his servant, and his friend,
Ye children that do lineally
from Jacobs loins descend.
4.
For lo he is the Lord our God,
even he, and he alone;
And every where throughout the Earth
his Judgments are made known.
His Promise and his Covenant,
which he has made to his,
Has been remembered evermore,
and still remembered is.
VIII. Hymn, Celebrates our Redemption by Jesus Christ: (Which, if you leave
out the parenthesis, will be sung in any general Tune; if you put them in,
then, to All people.)
THe Lord the God of Israel,
Luke 1. from v. 68 to 76.
(Now do) we praise with one accord,
For visiting and redeeming us,
The (chosen) people of the Lord:
For he has raised up for us
Salvations (strong and) surest horn,
Which in his servant David's house,
Is for his people (Israel) born.
2.
As by his holy Prophets all,
(Speaking) since first the world began,
And by their mouth he has foretold,
(That it) should come to pass for man,
That from our foes we should be freed,
And (saved from) all our haters hands,
To show that he remembers how
(How) his (most) holy Covenant stands.
3.
To pay the gracious promises,
Which to our (ancient) fathers came:
The oath which he had sworn unto,
Our father Abraham (by Name)
That he would give and grant to us,
That we (his folk) whom he has chose
Now being thus delivered
From (cruel) hand of all our foes,
Might serve him free from slavish fear,
Walking in (all the) perfect ways
Of Holiness and Righteousness,
Before him (even) all our days.
IX. Hymn, Celebrates the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. An^e.
LO Christ is sacrificed for us, 1 Cor. 5.7 8 and 11.26

our Passover (from Heaven,)
Now therefore let us keep the feast,
not with old lumps of leaven:
Who eat and drink unworthily
their own damnation earn;
Because they want a spiritual eye
his body to discern.
2.
Our hearts with care examined, Verse 28.29.

let us be stirred up,
To eat of this celestial bread,
and drink this sacred cup:
As often as we eat this bread,
and also drink this wine,
We show our Saviors death until
his second coming shine, he come the second time.

Or,
We show our blessed Saviors death
until he come again.
X. Hymn, Celebrates the same. Post.
Mat. 21.9 and Rev. 5.9
HOsanna to King David's son,
Hosanna to the Christ,
That in the Fathers Name does come,
Hosanna in the highest:
For thou wast slain, and art alive,
redeeming us to God,
From every Nation, kindred, tongue,
by thy most precious blood.
2.
1 Pet. 1.18 Rev. 5.19
Corruptive things, as silver is,
and gold redeemed us not;
But Christ our Saviors precious blood,
a Lamb without a spot.
To him that sits upon the Throne,
and Christ the Lamb therefore,
Be glory, blessing, strength, renown,
and honor evermore.
XI. Hymn, Celebrates the Lords Supper.
The Tune, Ye children which, etc.
John 6 32 33, 34, 35 and 7.38.
THe Bread of God (so truly called)
That gives life unto the world,
Is he that down from Heaven came,
And with this sweet celestial bread,
Lord let us be replenished,
And give us ever of the same.
For he that (as the Scripture says)
Lays hold on Christ by lively faith,
Shall never thirst nor hunger more:
For by that faith, and feeding so,
Out of his belly there shall flow,
Of living waters plentious store.
2.
The Spirit and the Bride do say, Rev. 22.17 20. Iam. 5 9.

Come, come away without delay:
And since that they have said it first,
Let all that hear it, as we do,
Reply the same, and say so too,
Come every one that is athirst,
The water of eternal life
Take without price, take without strife,
Take freely, whosoever pleases:
Behold, the Judge at door does stand,
His coming is so near at hand:
Amen, Amen, so come Lord Jesus.
Psalm. XXII. 2. Meter.
LOrd give thy judgme^ts to the King
That justice may be done,
And give the rule of governing
Unto his princely Son.
2. Then shall he govern uprightly,
And do thy people right:
Then shall he judge with equity,
The poor that have no might.
3. And then, by means of righteousness,
There shall be great increase;
In every corner fruitfulness,
Prosperity, and peace.
4. Then shall he help the poor and weak,
And them that suffer wrong;
And, by his power, in pieces break
Oppressors great and strong.
5. And then, from age to age, shall they
Regard and fear his might,
So long as Sun does shine by day,
Or else the Moon by night.
6. He shall descend as showers of rain
On mowen grass do drop,
Which make the ground to spring again
And bear a second crop.
7. The just shall flourish in his days,
And all shall be at peace,
Until the very Moon decays,
And all its motions cease.
8. He shall be Lord of Sea and Land,
From shore to shore, throughout;
From Sea to Sea, on either hand,
And all the Earth about.
9 The dwellers in the deserts must
Before him bow full low:
His Enemies shall lick the dust
Whether they will or no.
10. The Kings of Tharshish, and the Isles
Their gifts to him shall bring:
And Kingdoms distant many miles
Do homage to this King.
The second Part.
11. All Kings shall sue to Christ the Lord
In his good grace to stand;
And all the people of the world
Shall be at his command.
12. For he the needy sort shall save,
When unto him they call:
The poor, I say, and them that have
No help of man at all.
13. He takes pity on the poor,
Whom Tyrants seek to slay;
And does preserve them evermore,
Those needy Souls, I say.
14. And by his power they shall be freed
From fraud, from force, and spite,
Because the blood that they do bleed
Is precious in his sight.
15. And he shall live, and they shall bring
To him of Sheba's gold;
He shall be prayed for as a King,
And daily be extolled.
16. The barren'st hills shall yield increase
Like Leb'nons fruitful boughs:
In every corner, Truth and Peace
His Government allows.
The Citizens of Sion hill
Shall flourish as the grass,
And in great peace and plenty, still,
Their happy days shall pass.
17. His Name (THE SON) when Sun shall rest,
Shall shine, and not be dim,
And Nations all shall call him blessed,
As being blessed in him.
10
18. Praise ye the Lord of Hosts, and sing
To Isreal's God each one;
For he does every wondrous thing,
Yea, he himself alone.
19. And blessed be his holy Name,
All times eternally:
Let the Earth be filled with his fame,
Amen, Amen, say I.
XII. Hymn, Celebrates the Passion.
1 Pet. 2.18 and 2, 24.
LO, Christ has suffered once for all,
The Just for wicked men,
That he might bring us unto God,
Now reconciled again:
Who bare our sins in his own flesh,
Upon that cursed tree,
That we should live to righteousness,
And dead to sin should be.
2.
Isai. 53.6, 4.
All we like sheep have gone astray,
To several sins we fall;
And God has laid the load on him,
To answer suffer
for us all.
A man of sorrows sure he was,
And he has born our grief:
Mean while we hid our face from him,
And gave him no relief.
3.
Lo, this is that good Shepherd then, Ioh. 10.11 and 15.13.

That good Shepherd indeed,
That laid his life down for the sheep,
Which he does watch and feed.
A greater love then this has none,
Nor none can comprehend,
Then that a man should stake his life,
And lose it for his friend.
4.
For scarce will any dye for him, Romans 5, 7, 8.

That lives most righteously;
Yet happ'ly for a special friend
Some one might dare to dye.
But God commends his love to us,
And he commends it thus,
In that, when we were enemies,
Christ freely died for us.
5.
By him therefore let us give to God
The sacrifice of praise; Heb. 13.15

Fruit of our lips, in giving thanks,
Unto his Name always.
The 76 Psam. W. B. as 100. Of Victory over Enemies.
IN Judah God is known to his,
At Or Dunbar, Dundee, Naz^by, Edghil, etc.
Worster God was
his Name is great in Israel:
2. His Sanctu'ry at Salem is,
he does in Sion mountain dwell:
3. The Bows and Arrows horse and footme^
brake he there
the battle, shield, and sword, and spear.
4. Thou art more glorious every way,
and excellent, then mounts of prey.
2.
5. The stout of heart are overthrown,
and they have stepped their sleeps last night;
And of the mighty men, not one
has found his hands wherewith to fight.
6. O God of Jacob, thy reproof
spoild rattling wheel, and thundering hoof:
Charet and horse at thy fierce blast
into a sleep of death are cast.
3.
7. Thou, thou alone are worthy fear;
for who may stand before thine eyes?
Who dares approach, who dares appear
when once thy burning wrath does rise?
8. From heaven thou make judgment heard
the silent earth was sore afraid,
9. When God arose to judgment then
to save on earth all humble men.
4.
10. Man's wrath shall surely praise thy Name,
henceforth held in by thy restraints:
11. O make your vows, and pay the same
unto the Lord your God, ye Saints.
12. Let all about him presents bring
to him that daunts the proudest King;
To him, I say, whose fear compels
and Princes spirits curbs and quells.
The XIII. Hymn. W. B. as 113. Of the Churches Triumph over Antichrist.
NOw is Salvation come abroad, Rev 12 10; 11; 12: 11; 17: 7; 10

The strength and Kingdom of our God,
Now has his Christ extolled his might;
For the Accuser's made to fall,
He that accused our brethren all
Before our God, both day and night.
And him they quelled and overcame
By the pure blood of Christ the Lamb,
And by their Testimony true:
For by that double-edged sword,
The witness of their faithful word,
This Enemy they overthrew.
2.
Nor did they spare their utmost breath,
Nor love their lives unto the death,
But boldly laid down all at stake:
Therefore ye Heavens, lift up your voice
And ye that dwell in them, rejoice
In this Salvation to partake.
But woe to you, to you, O SIRS,
The Earths and Seas Inhabiters,
Guilty of this Accuser's Crime!
For Satan is come down to you,
Having great wrath, because he knew
He now must have but little time.
3.
We give thee thanks with one consent,
O Lord our God OMNIPOTENT,
Which art, and wast, and art to come,
For thou have taken unto thee
Thy great power and Authority,
And reigned in despite of ROME.
Blessing and Glory be therefore
Unto our God for evermore,
(To him that on the Throne does sit)
Thanksgiving also is his right,
Wisdom and honor, strength and might,
Amen, say we; and so be it.
The 126 Psalm. W. B. as 113. Of Wonderful Deliverance.
WHen God had our Deliverance wrought,
And Sion out of bondage brought,
It seemed to us a very Dream;
So much our Souls distracted were,
Between the thoughts of hope and fear,
To escape a danger so extreme.
Then sacred Joy filled every breast,
And was in Songs of mirth expressed,
And every tongue most sweetly sings,
The wondering Heathen often would say,
How good! how great a God have they!
That wroght for the^ such mighty things!
2.
Great things for us the Lord has wrought
Above the reach of humane thought,
Which makes our joy so much abound:
And now Lord bring the Remnant out
From bondage, as the showrs in drought,
Or Rivers to a parched Ground.
He that goes forth in times of need,
Sorrowing to spare his precious seed,
And sows in tears, and time of dearth,
When the fat Harvest comes about,
Shall make a glad return, no doubt,
With laden sheaves, and shouts of mirth.
The 129 Psalm. W. B. as 113. Of Deliverance from Enemies.
MAny a time and often have they
Afflicted me, may Israel say,
Even from my youth unto this day;
Often from my youth they did assail
And set me hard, yet did they fail,
And could not possibly prevail.
The Tyrants plowed me like the ground,
My back with furrows they did wou^d,
Such extreme cruelty I found:
But the just LORD, and most upright,
Has cut their cords asunder quite,
Theirs that in wickedness delight.
2.
And let them be confounded still,
And turned back, that bear ill will,
And hatred unto SION Hill:
Like to the grass let them be made
Which on the houses tops does fade,
And withers even in the blade;
Whereof the mower never receives
A handful, nor a lapful leaves
For him that binds up the sheaves:
Neither do they, which there go by,
Say, Sirs, God speed you heartily,
We bless you from the Lord most high.
Another Meter of 129 Psalm. W. B. as 148.
FUll often, of a truth,
And many times have they
Distressed me from my youth,
May Israel now say,
Even from the first,
Yet could they not prevail a jot,
And do their worst.
2.
They plowed upon my back,
As plow-shares teer the ground;
Long furrows did they make,
And many a grievous wound,
With wicked hands.
But the just Lord has cut their cords,
And broke their bands.
3.
And, Lord, confound them all,
And bring it so to pass,
That Sions foes may fall,
And all be made as grass
On houses top;
Which withers there, before it ear,
Or come to crop.
4.
Which never has the hap
To fill the mowers hand,
Nor lies in binders lap
So much as makes a band,
Nor (in the Rode)
Need Passengers say, Speed you Sirs
in the Name of God.
The XIIII. Hymn Celebrates the great Victory in Scotland, at Dunbar-Field, and
the several Successes there since. Sept. 3. 1650.

Psa. 98, 1
SIng to the Lord a new-made Song,
for he has marvels done;
His holy hand and arm most strong
the victory has won.
and 124.1, 2.
Had not the Lord been on our side,
now Israel England sure
may say,
When Enemies Scotland
rose in so much pride,
they had us spoiled that day.
2.
Had not the Lord his power revealed
our part and cause to own,
To whom both they and we appealed,
we had been overthrown.
Ps. 18.46
But blessed be our Rock of power

The third Part.
v. 37, 38.
I have pursued our foes that fled,
and also overta'ne,
And till they were extinguished
I did not turn again.

Psalm. 98.1. and 124 1, 2.
SIng to the Lord a new-made Song,
for he has marvels done;
His holy hand and arm most strong
the victory has won.
Had not the Lord been on our side,
now Israel England sure
may say,
When Foes Scots
came on in so much pride,
they had us spoiled this day.
2.
Had not the Lord his power revealed
our part and cause to own,
(To whom both they and we appealed)
we had been overthrown:
Ps. 18.46
But blessed be our Rock of Power
that ever does abide,
Joel 3.14
And plea^^d was this day and hour
the difference to decide.
3.
He has our Right and Cause maintained
Psalm 9.4.

And has disquieted our Foes,

His memorable praise record
his gathered Saints among.
Let joyful Israel shout and sing.
in their Creators Name,
Let Sions children in their King
triumphant joys proclaim.
2.
Heb. 11.33, 34.
Who have through Faith Kingdoms subdued,
obtained promises;
Escaped the sword, and those withstood
that wrought unrighteousness:
Of weak were made strong Champions
waxt valient in fight,
The Armies of the Aliens
they also turned to flight.
3.
Kings of Armies did flee apace, Ps. 68.12

having received the foil:
And they that stayed upon the place
did there divide the spoil:
He for their sakes has Kings controlled
with his outstretched Arm; Ps. 105.14

Who for to touch his Saints were bold,
or did his Prophets harm.
4.
The spirit of Princes he cuts off, Ps. 76.12

he is terrible to Kings:
He Will recompense their bold offense, Ps. 94.23

and take them in their sins.
No King is saved by multitude, Ps. 33.16

or by a numerous Host:
The great and mighty are subdued,
that did insult and boast.
5.
The proud are scattered and destroyed, Lu. 1.15

and in the very thing,
Wherein they proudly were employed, Exo. 18 11.

above them was our King.
Psalm. 20.8
They are brought down and fallen, but we
are risen, and stand upright;

with us the Lord of might.
6.
Psa. 144.1
Who helped us, and our battles fought,
covering our heads that day:
Our hands and fingers eke he taught
to war and fight, the way:
We through our God did valiantly;
Psa. 60.12
and he it is alone
That has trod down the Enemy,
the Glory is his own.
PART III.
Psalm. 98.1
With thy right hand O Lord most high
and with thy out-stretch'd arm:
Thou get'st thy self the victory,
and savest us from harm.
and 118.15
The right hand of the Lord our God
has done most valiantly:
The right hand of the Lord our God
it is exalted high.
2.
Verse 16
The right hand of the Lord our God,
pre-eminence it has:
The right hand of the Lord our God
brings mighty things to pass:
Psa. 126.3
The Lord does mighty things for us,
whereof we (sure) are glad:
Even great and terrible things he does, Deuteronomy. 10, 21.

we have Experience had.
3.
Thy right hand glorious is in Power, Exo. 15.6

and has victoriously,
In pieces dashed this day and hour,
the lofty Enemy.
When thou came down in thy great strength,
the Mountains fled away; Is. 64.1, 3

And at thy presence they at length
consumed were that day. Hab. 3.6, 10.

4.
As smoke is driven away, Ps. al 78.2 and 35.5
so they
are driven away we see:
And as the chaff before the wind
so scattered all they be.
All those that hated us and thee, Isa 17.13 14. and 44 11.

are fled, and are surrounded,
And all incensed at us, we see
ashamed and confounded.
5.
Thus thou have thresht the Mountains small,
and made the Hills as chaff; Isa. 41.15

In their own counsels lo they fall, Psalm. 10.5

and thou thereat do laugh:
The counsel which these men did take, and 33.10

the Lord does bring to naught,
And their devices fruitless make,
what ere the people thought.
6.
Ps. 118.23
Thus God has quelled our enemies,
this is the LORDS DOING;
And marvelous it is in our eyes,
when we behold the Thing.
Ps. 58.10
The Righteous (Lord) rejoice to see
the Vengeance thus made good,
And they have washed their feet with thee
in the ungodly's Blood.
PART IV.
Ex. 15.3
The Lord he is a man of war,
and so in these our coasts
He has appeared, both near and far;
his Name's the Lord of Hoasts.

The strong and mighty Lord he is termed,
the Lord in battle strong:
Rev. 3.15
Faithful and true, and has confirmed
his Word even all along.
2.
Isa. 25.9
Lo this God is our God, and we
did on his Promise stay;
We waited for him, and we see
he has us saved this day.
Ex. 15.2
Jehovah is our Strength and Song,
and our SALVATION;
He is Our God, we will him Prepare
an HABITATION.
3.
Our fathers God, we will him exalt, Neh. 9.5.

blessed be his glorious Name,
Which is exalted far above
all Blessing, Praise and Fame:
Who has triumphed gloriously; Ex. 15.1

and He is every way,
More Glorious and Excellent
then all the Mounts of prey. Ps. 76.4.

4.
Amongst the gods, who is like to thee? Ex. 15.11

glorious in Holiness!
Fearful in praise, wonders we see!
none's like thee questionless: 1 Samuel 7.22. Jer. 10.7

Amongst all Nations is not One
that may compared be!
In all the Kingdoms there is none
(O Lord) that is like to thee!
5.
Thou art most high over all the Earth, Ps. 83.18 Ps. 46.9. Ps. 118.15. Is.
59.19 Jer. 10.6 and 7.

thou make wars to cease:
Thou causest voice of Joy and Mirth,
and thou createst Peace.
None's like to thee, for thou art great,
thy Name is great in might:
Who would not fear thee? for to thee
it does pertain of right.
6.
Thou, King of Nations do appear,
and have a glorious Fame:
Rev. 15.4
And who, O Lord, would not thee fear,
and glorify thy Name?
For thou only art Holy Lord,
all Nations shall thee fear,
And by them thou shall be adored,
for thy Judgments appear.
7.
Rev. 15, 3
Thy works are great and marvelous,
which thou do in our view;
Lord God Almighty, King of Saints,
thy Ways are Just and True.
PART V.
Cor. 1.27 28.
Lord, thou the foolish things do choose
for to confound the Wise,
The weak things also to confound
the Mighty, in our eyes:
The lowest and the basest Things,
and things despised far,
Yea, things which are not, for to bring
to naught the things that are.
2.
The Mighty thou casts from the seat,
Luke 1.52
and do exalt the Meek:
2 Cor. 12 9
Thy strength in weakness is complete,
when unto thee we seek:
Mat. 12.16
Out of the mouth of very babes,
Lord, thou will perfect praise:
Thou bringst down high and mighty ones
and mean ones thou do raise. Isai. 46.5

3.
The poor despised Sectaries,
thy Saints, so termed O Lord,
Exalt thou do before the Eyes
of those that them abhorred.
That Way which they call Heresy, Act. 24.14

so do we worship thee,
In Truth and in Sincerity,
as thy Appointments be.
4.
Thou upon Princes pour'st contempt, Psalm 107 40, 41.

and causest them to stray,
And wander in the Wilderness,
where is no (beaten) way:
But sav'st the poor from misery,
set'st him on Safety's Rock,
And make him up a Family,
like to a numerous Flock,
5.
These things the righteous shall behold, ver. 42, 43

rejoicing in the same,
And all Iniquity controlled,
shall stop her mouth with shame.
Who so has wisdom from above,
these things for to record,
Even they shall understand the Love
and Kindness of the Lord.
6.
Ps. 85.9.
Surely Salvation is at hand,
For those that do him fear,
That Glory may dwell in our Land,
the Lord does now appear:
verse. 13.
Before Him Righteousness shall go,
and (where the way was dim,)
Shall now direct our footsteps so,
that we may follow him.
PART VI.
Ps. 149.5
The Saints joyful in Glory be,
and sing loud on their beds,
Is. 35.10
To Sion come, with Songs we see,
and Joy upon their Heads:
And in their mouth is Gods high praise,
Psa. 149.5, 6.
and in their hands a sword,
T'inflict on heathenish peoples ways
the vengeance on Record.
2.
verse. 9.
This Honor Saints have, all of them,
to execute their Doom,
That fight against Jerusalem,
for Antichrist and ROME;
verse. 8.
To punish Tyrant-Kings that gave
their power unto the Beast,
And Nobles that Ignobly have
assisted him at least.
3.
The Lord against that House arose, Isai. 31.2.

that evil Doers be,
And eke against the Help of those
that work Iniquity.
The young Pretender to the Crown,
is turned back with Disgrace; Ier. 46.5

Their mighty Ones are beaten down,
and fled away apace.
4.
They looked not back for fear and dread
in this their setting forth; Verse 6.

But sore dismayed, hasted, stumbled,
and Fell toward the NORTH.
Their Lords and Lairds no man relieves,
they now are all confined:
Their Prince Companion is of Thieves Viz. of Thieves at sea, in his piratical
Commissions; Also of Thieves at land, with Hind and others in his person if
reports of his own party be credited. Isai. 1.23
,
of a Rebellious kind;
Or (if reports be true)
and with Rebellious Hind.
5.
Lo (Royalists) this is the man Psa. 52 7 Dan. 5 22

that made not God his strength;
Open your eyes, see if you can
his Errors now at length:
The wicked ways his father went,
he also walked has,
Hard'ning his heart, would not repent,
and now on him there is Wrath. 2 Chronicles. 19.2.

6.
Genesis 4.14
He wanders up and down like Cain,
a Fugitive Vagabond
this day If he be ^mo^^t, read wandered, hot day, and feared. Ps. 107.40 41.
,
And fears always to be slain,
when met upon the way.
But Saints are set on Safety's Rock,
and Triumph in their King:
With Joy together now they flock,
and HALLELVJAHS sing.
Gospel Mercies.
Psalm 117. Celebrates Gods Mercy and Truth to us Gentiles in those days of the
Gospel.


ALl Nations and all people sing
Jehovah's noble praise;
For great's the kindness of our King his merciful kindness

Toward us in these days:
His Love to us is marvelous,
The Truth of Jeho-vah,
For ever sure it does endure:
Halle, Halle lu-jah.
Amen, Hallelujah.
Or thus, as the 100 Psalm.
ALl Nations raise your voice these days,
To sing Jehovah's noble praise:
All people thus praise him with Us,
For great's his Love, and marvelous.
His Truth is sure, and does endure,
Not any age shall it obscure:
Great Jehovah praise ye, Ps. 68.32.
Selah,
And sing with us Hallelujah.
FINIS.
Postscript.
REader, These Hymns and Psalms thou have
here published, are but a Taste
Of those the Author will produce,
yet more complete, for public use.
These first were needful for thy view,
the other shortly will ensue.
The Old Psalms some not Relishing,
in Public, have left off to sing;
So many faults they have espied,
but these by Him are Rectified:
And sure when His they shall peruse,
they will sing again that now refuse.
If singing be the work of Heaven,
then scarcely one in six or seven,
That are so backward to it on Earth,
are fit for that same place of mirth;
But those who well them thus employ,
shall enter to their Masters Joy.
Pro. 26.31 ^sa. 51.11 and 35.10
Then say not, in the way's a Lion,
but come with singing unto Zion:
And now no more make an excuse,
for to neglect the precious use
Of this sweet Gospel-Ordinance,
that does so much Gods praise advance.
To the Author, on these Hymns, and his sweet Translation of the Psalms.
What J out of thy treasury Show the times require for public vieW
I should Ungrateful be if I should hide such heavenlI poes I
Let now alL judge who does Excel who may we calL thy paralleL
Long may thou Live sing forth and telL gods praise a Loud in jsraeL
Isr'els sweet psalmist, I will saI thou worthilI art styled this daI
Amongst those that sing Alle-lujA in All jsraell, or judA
May thou fitly have a naM with david, moses, miriaM

A spirit of praise, As deborA barak, Asaph, eliathA
Refreshing psalms, Rich jewels aR with which, no Rubies may compaR
