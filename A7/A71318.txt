The preface of Johan Bourchier knight lord Berners / translatour of this
present cronycle.
WHat condygne graces and thanks ought men to give to the writers of
historyes? Who with their great labors / have done so much profit to the
humayne life. They show / open / manifest and declare to the reder / by
example of old antyquite: what we should enquere / desire / and follow: And
also / what we should eschew / avoid / and utterly fly. For when we (being
inexpert of chau^ces) se / behold / and read the ancient acts / gestes / and
deeds: Home / and with what labors / dangers / and paryls they were gested
and done: They right greatly admonest / ensign / and teache us: how we may
led forth our lives. And farther / he that has the perfyte knowledge of
others joy / welthe / and higher prosperity: and also trouble / sorrow and
great aduersyte: has the xpert doctrine of all parylles. And albeit / that
mortal folk are marvelously separated / both by land and water / and right
wo^derously sytuate: yet are they and their acts (done peradventure by the
space of a thousand year) co^pact together / by thistographier: as it were the
deeds of one self cite / and in one man's life. Wherefore I say that history
may well be called a divine prouydence: For as the celestyall bodies above /
complecte all and at every time the universal world / the creatures therein
contained / and all their deeds: semblably so does history. Is it not a right
noble thing for us / by the fautes and errors of other / to amede and erect
our life in to better? We should not seek and acquyre that other did / but what
thing was most best / most laudable / and worthily done / we should put
before our eyes to follow. Be not the sage counsayles of two or three old
fathers in a cite / town / or country: whom long age has made wise / dyscrete
/ and prudent: far more praised / lauded / and derely loved: than of the
yongemenne? How much more than ought stories to be commended / praised / and
loved? In whom is encluded so many sage counsayls / great reasons / and high
wisedoms: of so innumerable persons / of sundry nacyons and of every age: and
that in so long space / as four or five hundred year. The most profitable thing
in this world / for the instytucion of the humayne life / is history. Dues
the contynuall redyng thereof / makes young men equal in prudence to old men:
and to old fathers stryken in age / it mynystreth experyence of things. More
/ it yeldeth private persons worthy of dignyte / rule and governance. It
compels themperours / high rulers and governors / to do noble deeds: to
the end they may obtain immortal glory. It exciteth / moves / and stereth the
strong hardy warriors / for the great laud that they have after they ben deed
/ promptly to go in hand with great and hard parels / in defense of their
country. And it prohibyteth reprouable persons to do mischeuous deeds / for
fear of infamy and shame. So thus / through the monumentes of writynge /
which is the testymony unto virtue / many men have been moved: Some to
byldecytes / some to deuyse and establisshe laws tight profitable / necessary
/ and behouefull for the humayne life: Some other to find new arts / crafts
/ and sciences / very requisyte to the use of mankind. But above all things /
whereby man's welthe ryseth / special laud and cause ought to be given to
history. It is the keeper of such things as have been virtuously done / and
the witness of yuell deeds. And by the benefit of history: all noble / high
/ and virtuous acts be immortal. What moved the strong and ferse Hercules to
enterprise in his life / so many great inco^perable labors and pyls? Certainly
noughtels / but y^ for his merytes immortalyte might be given to him of all
folk. In se^blable wise did his imytator noble duke These us / and many other
innumerable worthy prices and famous men / whose virtues ben redeemed sro
oblyuion and shine by history. And where as other monumentes in process of
time / by varyable chances / are confused and lost. The virtue of history /
dyffused and spredde through the vuyuersall world / has to her custos and
kepat it (that is to say time) which co^sumeth the other writings. And albeit
that those men are right worthy of great laud and praise / who by their
writings show and led us the way to virtue: yet nevertheless / the poems /
laws / and other arts that they found / devised and writ / ben mixed with
some damage. And sometime for the truth / they ensign a man to lie. But only
history / truly with words / representyng the acts / gestes / and deeds
done: complecteth all profit. It moves / stereth / and compels to
honesty: detesteth / erketh / and aborteth vices. It extolleth / enhaunceth /
and lyfteth up / such as ben noble and virtuous: depresseth / poystereth / and
thrusts down / such as ben wicked / yuell / and reprouable. What knowledge
should we have of ancient things past / and history were not? Which is the
testymony thereof / the light of truth / the maystres of the life humayne /
the presydent of remembrance / and the messanger of antiquyte. Why moved and
stered Phaleryus / the king Ptholome / often and dilygently to read books?
Forsothe for none other cause / but that those things are found written in
books / that the fre^des dare not show to the price. Much more I would feign
write of the incomparable profit of history / but I fear me / that I should
to sore tourment the reder of this my preface. And also I doubt not / but that
the great vtilyte thereof is better known / than I could declare: wherefore I
shall breuely come to apoynt. Thus / when I aduertysed and remembered the many
fold comodyties of history / how benefyciall it is to mortal folk / and
eke how laudable and merytoryous a deed it is / to write hystories / fixed my
mind to do some thing therein. And ever wha^ this ymaginacyon came to me / I
volued / turned / and read many volumes and books / containing famous
histories. And among all other / I read dilygently the four volumes or books
of sir Johan Froyssart of the country of Heynaulte / written in the French
tongue: which I judged comodyous / necessary / and profitable to be had in
English / sith they treat of the fomous acts done in our parties. That is
to say: in England / France / Spaygne / Portyngale / Scotla^de / Bretayne /
Flanders / and other places adjoining: and specially / they redounde to the
honor of Englysshemen. What pleasure shall it be to the noble ge^tylmen of
England / to se / behold / and read: the high enterprises / famous acts /
and glorious deeds / done and atchyued by their valyant au^ceytours? Forsothe
and god: this has moved me at the high commandment of my most redouted
sovereign lord king Henry the.viii. king of England and of France / and
high defender of the christen faith. etc. Under his gracyous supportacyon /
to do my deuoyre to translate out of french in to our maternall english
tongue / the said volumes of sir Johan Froyssart. Which cronycle begins at
the raygne of the most noble and valyant king Edward the third. The year of
our lord / a thousand three hundred and sixtene: And contynucth to the
beginning of the reign of king Henry the fourth. The year of our lord god a
thousand and four hundred: The space by / twene / is threscore and fourtene
years. Requyrynge all the reders and herers thereof / to take this my rude
translacion in gre. And in that I have not followed mine author word by word:
yet I trust I have ensewed the true report of the sentence of the matter. And
as for the true namyng of all manner of personages / Countries / cities / towns
/ ryuers / or teldes: Where as I could not name them properly nor aptely in
English / I have written them acordynge as I found them in french. And
though I have not given every lord / knight / or squire his true addycion:
yet I trust I have natswarued fro the true sentence of the matter. And there as
I have named the dystaunce between places by miles and leages / they must be
understand acordyng to the custom of the countries where as they be named /
for in some place they be lengar than in some other. In England a leage or
mile is well known / in France a leage is two miles / and in some place three.
And in other countries more or less / every nation has sondrie customs. And
if any fault be in this my rude translacyon / I remyt the correctyon thereof to
the^ that discretely shall find any reasonable deraute. And in their so doing
/ I shall pray god to send the^ the bliss of heaven.

Amen.

here begymeth the prologe of sir John^ Froissart of the cronicles of france /
Inglande / and other places abioynynge. he first chaptre.
TO thentent that the honorable and noble au^tures offeatis of arms / done and
achyued by y^ wars of France and Ingland. should notably be inregisterd and
put in perpetual memory. whereby the prewe and hardy / may have ensample to in
courage them in their well doing. I sir John^ Froissart / will treat and
record an hystory of great louage and preyse. But or I begin / I require the
savior of all the world / who of nothing / created al things. that he will
give me such grace and understanding / that I may continue and per ever in
such wise / that who so this process redeth or hereth / may take pastau^ce
pleasure and ensample. It is said of troth / that al buyldynges are masoned
and wroughte of diverse stones and all great tyuers / are gurged and assembled
of diverse surges and sprynges of water. In like wise all sciences are extraught
and co^piled of diverse clerks / of that one writes / another parauenture is
ignorant. But by the famous writing of ancient auctours / all thyngis ben
known in one place or other. Than to attaygne to the matter that I have
entreprised / I will begin. First by the grace of god and of the blessed virgyn
ourlady saint Mary: from whom all comfort and consolation proceeds. and will
take my foundation out of ye true cronicles sometime co^pyled by the right
reverend discrete and sage master John^ la Bele sometime Chanon in saint
La^bartis of Liege / who with good heart / and due diligence did his true
devour / in writing this noble cronicle / and did continue it all his life
days. in following the troth as nere as he might / to his great charge and
cost in sekyng to have the perfight knowledge thereof. He was also in his life
days Well-beloved / and of the secret counsel with the lord sir John^ of
Haynaulte / who is often remembered (as reason requires) here after in this
book. For of many fair and noble auentures / he was chief / causer. And by
whose means / ye said ser John^ la Bele might well know and here of many
diverse noble deeds. The which here after shall be declared. Troth it is that I
/ who have entreprised this book. to ordeyne for pleasure and pastaunce / to
the which always I have been inclyned / and for that intent / I have followed
and frequented the company of diverse noble / and great lords. as well in
France Juglande and Scotland / as in diverse other countries / and have had
knowledge by them. And always to my power justly have inquired for the troth
of the dedis of war / and auentures that have fallen / and specially / sith
the great batell of Poyters: where as the noble king John^ of France was takyn
prisoner as before that time I was but of a young age or understanding. Ho we
be it I took on me / as soon as I came from scole to write and recite the said
book and bare ye same compyled into Ingland / and presented the volume thereof
to my lady Philypp of Heynaulte / noble queen of Ingland. who right amyably
received it to my great profit and auau^ceme^t. And it may be so / that the
same book is not as yet eramyned nor corrected / so justly as such a case
requires. For featis of arms derely bought and achyued / the honor thereof
ought to be given and truly divided to them that by promise and hard travail
have deserved it. Therefore to acquyte me in that bihalf. and in following the
troth as nere as I can. I / John^ Froissart have entreprysed this hystory / on
ye forsaid ordinance and true fundacion / at the instau^ce and request of a
dear lord of mine ser Robert of Namure knight lord of Bewfort. To whom entierly
I owe love and obeysyunce / and god grant me to do that thing that may be to
his pleasure.

Amen.
here spekethe the auctour of such as were most valiant knyghtis to be made
mention of in this book. ap.ii.
ALl noble hertis to encorage and to show them ensample and matter of honor. I
ser John^ Froissart begin to speak after the true report and relation of my
master John^ la Bele sometime Chanon of saint Lambertis of Liege af^ermyng thus
/ how that many noble persons have often times spoke of the wars of France and
of Ingland. and perauenture knew not iuslely the troth thereof: nor the true
occasions of the first mouyngis of such wars: nor how the war at length
continued. But now I trust ye shall here reported the true foundation of the
cause and to thentent that I will not forget myuysshe or abrydge ye hystory
^any thing for defaute of la^gage / but rather I will multiply and increase it
/ as ner as I can following the troth. from point to point. in spekyng and the
wyng all the aue^tures since the natiuite of the noble king Edward ye.iii. Who
reigned king of England / and achyued many perilous auentures and diverse great
batelles addressed / and other featis of arms of great proWes / sith the year
of our Lord god.M. CCC.xxvi. that this noble king was crowned in Ingland /
for generally such as were with him in his batels and happy fortunate
auentures / or with his people in his absence. ought right well to be takyn and
reputed for valiant and worthy of renown and though there were great plenty of
sondrye parsonages that ought to be praised and reputed as sovereigns / yet
among other and pryncipally ought to be renowned the noble propre person of ye
forsaid gentle king. Also the prince of Walys his son / the duke of Lancastre
/ ser Reignold lord Cobham / sir Gualtier of Manny of Heynaulte knight / sir
John^ Chandos / sir Fulque of Harle / and diverse other of whom is made mention
hereafter in this present book because of their valyant prowes / for in all
batels that they were in most commonly they had ever the renown. both by land
and by se / according to the troth. They in all their dedis were so valyant /
that they ought to be reputed as sovereigns in all chyualry. yet for all that
such other as were in their company ought not to be of ye less value / or
less set by. Also in France in y^ time / there were found many good knyghtis
strong and well expert in featis of arms. For the realm of France was not
so discomfited / but that always there were people sufficient to fight withal
/ and the king Philyppe of Uaioyes was a right hardy and a valiant knight And
also king John^ his son / Charles ye king of Behaigne / the earl of Ala^son /
the earl of Foyz sir Sa^^tre / sir Arnold Dangle / the lords of Beamon / the
father and the son / and diverse other / ye which I ca^ not their names. of
whom hereafter right well shall be made mention / in time and place convenient
to say the troth / and to maynteigne the same. all such as in cruel batels
have been seen abydyng to the discomfeture sufficiently doing their devour / may
well be reputed for valyant and hardy what soever was their adventure.

Here the matter speaks of some of the predecessors of king Edward of
Ingland. Cap. iii.
FIrst / the better to enter into the matter of this honorable and pleasant
hystory of the noble Edward king of Ingland. who was crowued at London the year
of our lord god.M. CCC.xxvi. on Christmas day / lyuy^g the king his father /
and the queen his mother. It is certain / that the opinyon of inglisshmen most
commonly was as than / and often times it was seen in Ingland after the time of
king At thure / how that between two valyant kings of Ingland there was most
como^ly one bitwene them / of less sufficiauncy / both of wit and of prowes.
and this was right well aparant by ye same king Edward the third. for his
graundfather called the good king Edward the first was right valyant / sage /
wise / and hardy auenturous / and fortunate in all featis of war. and had
much a do against the scottis and conquered them.iii. or.iiii. times. For the
scotts could never have victory nor idure against him / and after his dissease
his son of his first wife who was father to the said good king Edward the
third was crowned king and called Edward the.ii. Who resembled nothing to his
father in wit nor in prowes. but governed and kept his realm right wyldly. and
ruled him self by synyster counsel of certain parsons / whereby at length he
had no profytte norlaude as ye shall here after. For anon after he was crowned
Robert Bruise king of Scotland / who had often before given much a do to the
said good king Edward the first / conquered again all Scotland / and brent and
wasted a great part of the realm of England / a.iiii. or.v. days journey
Within the realm at two times / and discomfyted the king and all the Barons of
Ingland at a place in Scotland called Estaruelyn by batel arengyd / the day of
saint John^ Baptyst in the.vii. year of ye reign of the same king Edward In
the year of our lord.M. CCC.xiiii. The chase of this disco^feture endured.ii.
days and two nyghtys. And the king of Ingland went with a small company to
London. and on Mydlentsonday in the year of our lord.M. CCC.xvi. The scottis
wan again the cite of Berwyk by treason. but because this is no part of our
matter I will leave spekyng thereof.

Here mine auctour makes mention of the parents of this good king Edward
the.iii. Cap. iiii.
THis king Edward the.ii. father to the noble king Edward the.iii. had.ii.
brethern^ / the one called Marshall / who was right wyld and diverse of
conditions. the other called sir Aymon earl of Cane right wise / a miable /
gentle and well-beloved with alpeople. This king Edward the.ii. was married to
Isabell y^ daughter of Philyp la Beaw king of France / who Was one of the
feyrest ladies of ye world. The king had by her.ii. sons and.ii. daughters.
The first son was the noble and hardy king Edward y^.iii. of whom this hystory
is begone. The.ii. was named John^ / and dyed young. The first of ye daughters
was called Isabel married to the yo^g king David of scotland / son to king
Robert de Bruise married in her tender yongth by thaccord of both realms of
Ingland and Scotland for to make (...) fight pear. The other daughter was
married to the earl Reynold / who after was called duke of Guerles / and he had
by her.ii. sons / Reynold and Edward. who after reigned i^ great puissau^ce.

Herafter begins the occasion where by the war moved bitwene the kyngis of
France and Ingland. Cap. v.
NOw shows the hystory / that this Philyp la Beaw king of France had.iii.
sons and a feyre daughter named Isabel married into Ingland to king Edward
the.ii. and these.iii. sons / theldest named Jews who was king of Nauerr in
his fathers days and was called king Lewys Hotin. The.ii. had to name Philyp
the great or the long. and ye.iii. was called Charles. and all.iii. were kyngis
of France after their fathers discease by right succession each aff other
without having any issue male of their bodies laufully begoten. So that after
the death of Charlis last king of the.iii. the xii. piers and all the barons of
France / would not give the realm to Isabell the suster / who was queen of
England by cause they said and maynteyned and yet do / that the realm of
France is so noble that it ought not to go to a woman / and so co^seque^tly to
Isabel nor to the king of Inglande her eldest son / for they determined the
son of the woman to have no right nor succession by his mother / syn they
declared ye mother to have no right / so that by these reasons / the.xii. piers
and barons of France by their common acord did give the realm of France to
the lord Philyp of Ualois Nephew sometime to Philyp la beawe king of France /
and so put out the queen of Ingland and her son / who was as the next heir
male as son to the suster of Charles last king of France. Thus went the
realm of France out of ye right lynage as it seemed to many folks Whereby
great Wars has moved and fallen. and great distructio^s of people / and
cou^tres in the realm of France / and other places: as ye may here after.
This is the very right foundation of this hystory / to recount the great
entreprises and great featis of arms / y^ have fortuned and fallen sith the
time of the good Charlemaigne king of France there never fell so great
adventures.

Of the earl Thomas of Lancastre / and.xxii. other of the great lordis and
knyghtis of Inglande / that were beheeddyd. Cap. vi.
THe forsaid king Edward the.ii. father to ye noble king Edward ye.iii. on whom
our matter is founded. This said king governed right diversely his realm by ye
exortacio^ of ser Hew Spe^cer. who had been norisshed with him sith the
beginning of his yongth. The which ser Hew had so enticed the king / that his
father and he were ye greattest masters in all the realm. and by envy thought
to surmou^t all other barons of Ingland. whereby after the great disco^feture
that the scotts had made at Estermelyn. great murmoryng there arose in Ingland
bitwene^the noble barons and ye kings counsel / and namely against ser Hew
Spe^cer. They put on him / that by his counsel they were discomfeted / and
that he was favorable to the king of scotts. And on this point the haro^s had
diverse times comunicatio^ to gether / to be advised what they might do. whereof
Thomas earl of La^(...)re / who was uncle to ye king was chief. And anon when
ser Hew Spencer had espied this he purueyd for remedy. for he was so great
with the king / and so nere him / y^ he was more beloved with the king than all
the world after. So on a day he came to ye king and said sir certain lords of
your realm have made aliaunce to gether against you. and without ye take heed
thereto by times / they purpose to put you out of your realm. And so by his
malicious means he caused that the king made all the said lords to be takyn /
and their heedis to be strike^ of without delay / and without knowledge or
answer to any cause. First of all ser Thomas earl of Lancastre / who was a
noble and a wise holy knight. and has done sith many fair miracles in Pomfret
/ where he was beheedded / for ye which deed / the said sir Hew Spencer
achyued great hate in all the realm: and specially of the queen. and of the
earl of Cane brother to ye king And when he parceyued the dyspleasure of the
queen / by his subtle wit / he set great discord bitwene the king and the
queen / so that ye king would not se the queen / nor come in her company the
which discord endured a long space. Than was it showed to the queen secretly /
and to the earl of Cane / that without they took good head to them self they
were lykely to be distroyed / for sir Hew Spe^cer was about to purchase much
trouble to them. Than the queen secretly did puruey to go in to France / and
took her way as on pilgrimage / to saint Thomas of Canturbury and so to
Wynchelsey. And in the night went into a ship that was ready for her and her
young son Edward with her and the earl of Cane and sir Roger Mortymer. And in
a another ship they had put all their purueyau^ce and had wind at will / and
the next morning they arrived in the hauyn of Bolayn.

How the queen of Ingland went and complained her to the king of France her
brother of sir Hew Spencer. Cap. vii.
When queen Isabell was arrived at Bolayn and her son with her and the earl
of Cane. The capytayns and abbot of ye town came against her / and ioyously
receued her and her company into the abbey. And there she aboode.ii. days. Than
she departed / and to de so long by her iourneys that she arrived at Paris.
Tha^ king Charles her brother / who was enfourmed of her coming sent to mete
her diverse of the greattest lords of his realm / as the lord sir Robert de
Artoys / the lord of Crucy / the lord of Sully / the lord of Roy / and
diverse other / who honorably did receue her / and brought her in to the Cite of
Paris to the king her brother. And when the king saw his suster whom he had
not seen long before. As she should have entered into his chamber / he met her
/ and took her in his arms / and kyst her and said ye be welcome feyre suster
with my feyre nephewe your son / and took them by the handis / and led them
forth. The queen who had no great joy at her heart. But that she was so nere to
the king her brother / she would have kneled down.ii. or.iii. times at the feet
of the king. But the king would not suffer her but held her still by the right
hand / demanding right swetely of her astate and business. And she answered
him right sagely / and lamentably recounted to him all the felonyes and
injuries done to her by sir Hew Spencer / And required him of his aid and
comfort. When the noble king Charles of France had hard his susters
lamentation. Who wepyngly had showed him all her need and business / he said
to her. Fair suster appease your self / for by the faith I owe to god and to
saint Denyce / I shall right well puruey for you some remedy. The queen than
kneled downed whether the king would or not and said. My right dear lord and
fair brother. I pray god reward you. The king than took her in his arms and
led her into an other chamber / the which was apparayled for her / and for the
young Edward her son / and so departed fro her / and caused at his costis and
chargis all thing is to be delivered that was behouefull for her and for her
son After it was not long / but that for this occasion Charles king of
France assembled together many great lords and barons of the realm of
France to have their counsel and good advise how they should ordeyne for the
need and besynes of his suster queen of Ingland. Than it was cou^sailed to the
king that he should let the queen his suster to purchase for her self frendis
where as she would in the realm of France / or in any other place / and him
self to feign and be not known thereof. For they said to move war with the
king of Ingland and to bring his own realm into hatred / it were nothing
apertenaunt nor profitable to him / nor to his realm. But they concluded /
that conveniently he mgiht aid her with gold and silver / for that is the
metal whereby love is attaygned both of ge^tylemen and of pore soldiers. And
to this counsel and aduyce accorded the king. And caused this to be showed to
the queen privily by sir Robert Dartoys. who as than was one of the greatteste
lordis of all France.

How that sir Hew Spencer purchased / that the queen Isabell was banysshed
out of France. Cap..viii.
Now let us speak somewhat of sir Hew Spencer. when he saw that he had
drawn the king of England so much to his will / that he coud desire nothing
of him but it was granted / he caused many noble men and other to be put to
death without justice or law / because he held them suspect to be against him.
and by his pride he did so many marueylles / that the barous that were left
alive in the land could not bear nor su(...)e it any longer / but they
besought and required each other among them self to be of a peasable accord.
And caused it secretly to be known to the queen their lady. Who had been as
then at Paris the space of.iii. year / Certifiyng her by wryttyng / that if she
could find the means to have any company of men of arms / if it were but to
the nombre of a.M. and to bring her son and heir with her into Inglande. That
than they would all draw to her and abeye her and her son Edward / as they
were bound to do of duty. These letters thus sent secretly to her out of
Ingland she showed them to king Charles her brother / Who answered her / and
said Fair suster god be your aid / your besyuesse shall avail much the
better. Take of my men and subiectis to the nombre / that your friends have
written you for / and I consent well to this voyage. I shall cause to be
delivered unto you gold and silver as much as shall susfyce you. And in this
matter the queen had done so much What with her prayer / gifts / and promysses
/ that many great lordis and young knight / were of her accord / as to bring
her With great strength again into Inglande. Than the queen as secretly as she
could / she ordained for her voyage / and made her puruey aunce. But she could
not do it so secretly / but sir Hew Spencer had knowledge thereof. Than he
thought to win and withdraw the king of France fro her by great gifts. and
so sent secret messangers into France with great plentye of gold and silver
and rich Jewelles / and specially to the king. and his prive counsel / and
did so much that in short space / the king of France and all his pryue
counselle were as cold to help the queen in her voyage / as they had before
great desire / to dohit. And the king brake all that voyage / and defended
every parsone in his Realm / on pain of banysshyng the same / that none should
be so hardy to go with the queen to bring her again into Ingland. And yet the
said ser Hew Spencer aduysed him of more malice and bethought him how he might
get again the queen into Inglande / to be under the kyngis danger and his.
Than he caused the king to write to the holy father the pope effectuously /
desyryng him / that he would send and writ to the king of France / that he
should send the queen his wife again into Inglande / For he Will acquyte
himself to god and the World / and that it was not his fault / that she
departed fro him / for he Would nothing to her but all love and good faith
such as he ought to hold in marriage. Also there Were like letters written to
the cardynals dyuysed by many subtle ways / the which all may not be
written here.

Also he sent gold and silver great plenty to diverse cardynalles and prelates
/ such as Were most nereste and secrettest with the pope / and right sage and
able ambassadors were sent on this message / and they ladde the pope in such
wise by their gifts / and subtyle Ways / that he wrote to the king of
France / that on pain of cursyng / he should send his suster Isabell into
Ingland to the king her housbande. These letters were brought to the king of
France by the busshopp of ^ainctes / whom the pope sent in that legation. And
when the king had read the letters / he caused them to be showed to the queen
his suster / Whom he had not seen of long space before commaundyng her hastily
to avoid his realm / orels he would cause her to avoid with shame.

How that queen Isabell departed fro France / and entered in to the Empire.
Cap. ix.
When the queen hard this tidyngis / she knew not What to say / nor What
aduyce to take. for as than the barons of the realm of France were withdrawn
from her by the commandment of the king of France and so she had no comfort
nor succoure / but all only of her dear cosyn / ser Robert de Artoys for he
secretly did counsel and comfort her as much as he might / for other Wise he
durst not for the king had defended him. But he knew well that the queen was
chased out of Ingland and also out of France for evil Will / and by envy
which grieved him greatly. Thus was sir Robert de Artoyes at the queen's commaun
dement / but he durst not speak nor be known thereof. For he had hard the king
say and swear That Who so ever spoke to him / for the queen his suster should
leese his landis and be banysshed the realm. And he knew secretly how ye
king was in mind and will to make his suster to be taken and Edward her son
and the earl of Cane / and sir Roger Mortymer / and to put them all in the
handis of the king / and of sir New Spencer. Wherefore he came on a night and
declared all this to the queen and aduysed her of the parell that she was in.
Than ye queen was greatly abashed / and required him all we pyng of his good
counsel. Than he said madame / I counsel you that ye depart and go in to
the empire / where as there be many great lords / who may right well aid you /
and specially the earl Guillyam of Heynault / and sir John of Heynaulte his
brother. These two are great lords and wise men / true / drad / and redoubted
of their ennemies. Than the queen caused to be made ready all her purueyaunce.
and paid for every thing as secretly as she might / and so she and her son /
the earl of Cane / and all her company departed from Paris / and rode to ward
Heynaulte / and so long she rode that she came to Cambresys. And when she knew
she was in the Empire. She was better assured than she was before. and so
passed through Cambresys and entered into Ostrenaunt in Heynaulte and lodged at
Ambreticourt in a knights house who was called sir Dambrycourte / Who received
her right ioyously in the best manner to his power / In so much that afterward
the queen of Inglande and her son had with them into Ingland for ever / the
knight and his wife and all his children / and auaunced them in diverse manners.

THe coming thus of y^ queen of Ingla^de and of her son and heir into the
country of Heynaulte was anon well known in the house of ye good earl of
Heynault / who as than was at Ualenciennes. And sir John^ of Heynault was
certified of the time when the queen arrived at the place of sir Dambrecourte.
The which sir John^ was brother to the said Earl Guillam. And as he that was
young and lusty desiryng all honor / mounted on his horse / and departed with
a small company fro Uale^ciennes and came the same night to Ambreticourt / and
did to the queen all honor and reverence that he could deuyse. The queen /
who was right sorrowful / began to declare (complaynyng to him right
pyteously) her dolours / Whereof the said sir John^ had great pity / so that
the water dashte in his yen / and said certainly fair lady behold me here
your own knight / who shall not fail you to dye in the quarrel / I shall do
ye best of my power to conducte you and my lord your son. and help to
bring you into your astatis in Inglande by the grace of god / and With the
help of your frendis in that parties / and I and such other as I can desire
shall put our lives and goods in adventure for your sake and shall get men
of war sufficient if god be pleased without the danger of the king of France
your brother. Than the queen would have kneled down for great joy that she had
/ and for ye good will he offered her. But this noble knight took her up
quyckly in his arms and said / By the grace of god the noble queen of England
shall not knele to me. But ma dame recomforte yourselfe and all your company /
for I shall keep you faithful promise / and ye shall go se the earl my brother
and the countess his wife / and all their fair children / Who shall receive
you with great joy. For so I hard them report they would do. Than the
quenesayd. sir I find in you more love and comfort / than in all the world.
And for this that ye say and affirm me I thank you a thousand times. and if
ye will do this ye have promised / in all courtesy and honor / I and my son
shall be to you for ever bound / and will put all the realm of England in
your abandon. For it is right that it so should be. And after these words. when
they were this accorded. Sir John^ of Heynaulte took leave of the queen for that
uyght / and went to Douaing / and lay in the abbeye. And in the morning after
mass / he lepte on his horse and came again to the queen / Who received him
with great Joye by that time she had dynedde / and was ready to mount on her
horse to depart with him / and so the queen departed from the castle of
Dambrety court / and took leave of the knight / and of the lady / and thanked
them for their good there that they had made her / and said that she trusted
oones to se the time / that she or her son should well remember their
courtesye.

Thus departed the queen in the company of ye said sir John^ lord Beamont. who
right ioyously did conducte her to Ualencyenues / and against her came many of
the Burgesses of the town / and received her right humbly. Thus was she
brought before the Earl Guyllaume of Heynaulte / Who received her with great
joy / and in like wise so did the countess his wife / and feasted her right
nobly. And as than this Earl had four layre daughters / Margaret Philypp /
Jane / and Isabell. Among whom the young Edward set mo(...) hi^ love and
company on Phylypp. And also the young lady in all honor was more conuers^^nt
with him than any of her susters. Thus the queen Isabell abode at Ualencyennes
by ye space of.viii. days with the good Earl / and with the countess Jane be
Ualoys. In the mean time the queen aparailed for her needis and business /
and the said sir John^ wrote letters right effectuously unto knyghtis and such
companyans as he trusted best in all Heynaulte / in Brabant / and in Behaigne /
and prayed them for all amyties / that was bitwene them / that they would god
(...) him in this entreprise in to Inglande / and so there were great plentye
what of one country and other that were content to go with him. for his love.
But this said sir John^ of Heynaulte was greatly reproved and counseled the
contrary / both of the Earl his brother / and of the chief of the counsel
of the country / because it seemed to them / that the entreprise was right
high and parillouse / seeing the great discordis and great hates that as than
was between the barons of Inglande among them self. And also consyderyng /
that these (...)hemen most commonly have ever great envy at strangers.
Therefore they doubted / that the said sir John^ of Heynaulte / and his company
should not return again with honor. But howeso ever they blamed or
cou^sailed him / the gentle knight would never change his purpose / but laid
he had but one death to dye / the which was in the will of god. And also
said / that all knights ought to aid to their powers all ladies and da mozels
chased out of their own countries being without counsel or comfort.

How that the queen Isabell arrived in Inglande with sir John^ of Heynaulte in
her company. Cap. x.
This was sir John^ of Heynaulte moved in his courage and made his assembly /
and prayed ye (...) to he ready at hale^ and y^ (...) at Bredas / and the
Hollanders to be at ^uchryghte / at a day lymytted. Than the queen of Juglande
took leave of the earl of Heynault / and of the countess, and thanked them
greatly of their honor / sea^t / and good chere: that they had made her /
kissing them at her departing. Thus this lady departed and hersonne and all
her company with sir John^ of Heynaulte / Who With great pain gatte leave of
his brother. Sayng to him My lord and brother I am young / and think that god
has pourueyed for me this entrepryse for mine aduanceme^t. I believe and think
verily / that wrongfully and synfully this lady has been chased out of
Inglande / and also her son. hit is alms and glory to god and to the world
to comfort and help them / that be comfort(...) and specially so high / and
so noble a lady as this is. Who is daughter to a king and desceudyd of a royal
king. We be of her bloodde and she of ours. I had rather renounce and
forsake all that I have / and go serve god over the sea. and never to return
into this country rather than this good lady should have departed from us
Withowte comfort and help. Therefore dear brother / suffer me to go with yor
good Will. wherein ye shall do nobly / and I shall humbly thank you thereof. and
the better thereby I shall accomplysshe all the voyage. And When the good Earl
of Heynaulte / had (...) hard his brother / and parceued the great desire
that he had to his entrepryse / and saw (...) hy^ might turn him and his
heirs to great honor here after. Said to him. My fair brother / god forbid
that your good purpose should be broken or lerte. Therefore in the name of god I
give you leave and kyste him / (...)ynge him by the hand / insygne of great
love.

Thus he departed / and roode the same night to Mounce in Heynnaulte With the
Queen of Inglande. What should I make long process / They did so much by
their Journeys / that they came to Durdryght in Holande / Where as their
special assembly was made. And there they purueyed for shyppys great and small
such as they could get / and shypped their horses and harneys and purueyaunce
/ and so com(...) ded them self into the keeping of god and took their passage
by see. In that company there were of knyghtis and lordis. First sir John^ of
Heynaulte lord Beamond / sir Henry Da^to^g / sir Michell de Ligne / the lord
of Go^meg(...) / sir Parceualde Semeries / ser Robert de (...) sir Saures de
Boussoit / the lord of (...) ye lord of Pocelles / ye lord Uillers ye lord of
heyn The lord of Sars / the lord of Boy(...) / the lord of Da^bretycourte /
the lord of (...) and sir Oulpharte of Gustelle and diverse other knyghtis and
squyers / all in great desire to serve their master / and when they were all
departed fro the hauyn of Durdryght it was a fair flete as for the quantite
and well ordered / the season was fair and clear and right temperate and at
their departing With the fyrsteflodde they came before the Dignes of Holande
and the next day they drew up their sails / and took their way in costynge
zelande / and their ententis were to have taken land at Dongport but they
could not / for a tempeste took them in the sea / that put them so far out
of their course that they wist not of two days where they were of the which god
did them great grace For if they had takyn land at the port where as they had
thought they had been all lost / for they had fallen in the hand is of their
enemies. Who knew well of their coming. and aboode them there to have put
them all to death. So hit was that about the end of two days / the tempest
seized and the maryners parceyued land in Inglande and drew to that part
right ioyously / and there took land on the sands Without any right hauyn
orporte at Harwiche as the Inglysshe cronicle says / the.xxiiii. day of
Septembre / the year of our lord.M. CCC..xxvi. And so aboode on the sands
three days with little puruey aunce of vitaylle and vnshypped their horses and
harneys nor they wist not in what part of Inglande they were in: other in the
power of their frendis / or in the power of their ennemies. On the.iiii. day
they took forth their way in the adventure of god / and of saint George / as
such people as had suffered great disease of cold by night and hunger and
great fear / Whereof they were not as than clean ryd. And so they rode forth
by hills and dales on ye done side and on the other / till at the last they
found vyllages / and a great abbeye of black monks the which is called
saint Hamo^ / where as they.iii. days refresshed themself.

How the queen of Inglande beseged the king her husband in the town of
Bristo we Cap. xi.
ANd than this tidyng spread about ye realm so much that at ye last it came to
the knowledge of ye lords. by whom the queen was called again into Ingland.
and they apparailed them in all have to come to Edward herson / whom they would
have to their sovereign lord. And the first that came and gave them most
comfort was Henry Earl of Lancastre With the wrye neck / called Torte colle /
who was brother to Thomas earl of Lancastre beheeddyd / as ye have hard here
before. who was a good knight / and greatly reco^mended / as ye shall here
after in this hystorye. This Earl Henry came to the queen with great company
of men of War. and after him came from one part and other / earls / barons
/ knyghtys / and squiers with so much people that they thought them clean out
of parelles. and always increased their power as they went forewarde. Than
they took counsel among them that they should ride straight to the town of
Brystowe / Where as the king was and with him the Spencers. The which was a
good town and a strong / and Well closed / standing on a good port of the sea
and a strong castle / the sea bettyng round about it. And therein was the
king and ser Hew Spencer the elder who was about.xC. of age and sir Hew
Spencer his son / who was chieffe governor of the king / and counsayled him
in all his evil dedis. Also there was the Earl of Arundell / who had wedded
the daughter of sir Hew Spe^cer / and diverse other knyghtis and squiers
repayryng about the king is court. Than the queen and all her company /
lords of Heynaulte / earls and barons / and all other inglisshemen took the
right way to ye said town of Bristowe / and in every town where as they
entered / they were received with great feast and honor / and always their
people increased / and so long they rodeby their iourneys that they arrived at
Brystowe. and besygedde the town round about as nere as they might and the
king and sir Hew Spencer the younger held them in the castelle / and the old
sire Hew Spencer and the earl of Arundell / held them in the town. And when
the people of the town saw the great power that the Queen was of. For all
most all Inglande was of her accord / and parceued what parell and danger
euydentely they were in. They took counsel among theymselfe / and determined
/ that they would yield up the town to the queen / So that their lives and
gooddys might be sauyd. And so they send / to treat with the queen and her
counsel in this mattyer. But the queen nor her counselle Would not agree
thereto without she might do with sir Hew Spencer and with the earl of Arundell
what it pleased her.

When the people of the town saw they could have no peace otherwise / nor
save the town nor their gooddes nor their lives / in that distress they
accorded to the queen / and opened the gates / so that the queen and ser John^
of Heynaulte and all her barous / knyghtis / and squyers entered into the town
/ and took their lodgyngys within as many as might and the reside we without.
Than sir Hew Spencer and the Earl of ^rundel were taken and brought before the
queen to do her pleasure with them. Than there was brought to the queen her
own children / John^ hersonne / and her two daughters / the which were found
there in ye keeping of ye said sir Hew Spencer / Whereof the queen had great joy
/ for she had not seue them long before. Than the king might have great
sorrow / and sir Hew Spencer the younger / who were fast enclosed in the
strong castle / and the most part of all the realm turned to the queen's
part / and to Edward her eldest son.

How yt sir Hew Spe^cer and the earl of Arundell were judged to death Cap.
xii.
When the queen and her barons and all her company were lodged at their ease.
Than they beseged the castle as nere as they might. The queen caused sir Hew
Spe^cer the elder and therle of Aru^dell to be brought forth before Edward her
son / and all the barons that were there present. And said how that she and
her son shulbe take right and law on them according to their desertis. Than
sir Hew Spencer said. Ma dame god be to you a good judge and give you good
judgment / and if we can not have it in this world / I pray god we may have
hit in another. Than stepte forth sir Thomas Wage a good knight / and marshall
of the host. and there openly he recou^ted they dedis in writing. And than
turned him to another ancient knight / to the intent that he should bring him
on that case fanty. and to declare what should be done with such parsones / and
what Judgment they should have for such causes. Than the said knight
counseled with other barons and knyghtis / and so reported their opynions /
the Which was / how they had well deserved death / for diverse horrible dedis /
the which they have commysed. for all the trespass rehearsed before to justify
to be of troth / Wherefore they have deserved for the dyuersyties of their
trespaces to have judgment in.iii. diverse manners. First to be drawn / and
after to be heedded / and than to be hanged on the Jebet. This in like wise as
they were iubged so it was done and executed before the castle of Brystowe /
in the sight of the king and of sir Hew Spencer the younger. This judgment was
done in the year of our lord.M. CCC..xxvi. on saint Denis day in October. And
after this execution / the king and the young Spe^cer seeing them self thus
beseged in this myschief / and knew no comfort that might come to them / in a
morning betymes they two with a small company entered into a little vessel
behind the castle / thynkyng to have fled to the country of Walys. But
they were.xi. days in the ship and enforced it to sail as much as they
might. But what so ever they did the wind was every day so contrary to
them by the will of god / that every day oones or twyse they were ever brought
again within a quartter of a mile to the same castle.

At the last it fortuned sir Henry Beamond son to the vicount Beamond in
Ingland entered in to a Barge and certain company with him / and spyed this
vessel / and rowed after him so long that the ship wherein the king was could
not flee fast before them / but finally they were over takyn / and so brought
again to the town of Bristow / and delivered to the queen and her son as
prisoners. Thus it befell of this high and hardy entrepryse of sir John^ of
Heynault / and his company. For when they departed and entered into their
ships at Durdright they were but.iii. C. me^ of arms. And thus by their help
and the lords in Inglande / the queen Isabell conquered again all her astate
and dignyte / And put unto execucion all her enemies where of all the most
part of the realm were right Joyouse / without it were a few parsones such
as were favorable to sir Hew Spencer / and of his part. And when the king
and sir Hew Spencer mere brought to Bristowe by the said sir Henry Beamond The
king was than sent by the counsel of all the barons and knyghtis to the strong
castle of Barkeley / and put under good keeping and honest / and there were
ordained people of astate about him / such as knew right Well what they
ought to do / but they were straytly commanded that they should in no wise
suffer him to pass out of ye castle. And ser Hew Spe^cer was deliuerd to ser
Thomas wage marshall of (...) host. And after yt the queen departed and al her
host to ward London which was the chief cite of Ingland. and so ryd forth on
their iourneis and ser Thomas Wage caused ser Hew Spe^cer to be fast bound on
ye best and leuiest horse of al ye host and caused him to were on a tabarte /
such as traitors and thieves Were wont to were. And thus he was led in scorue
/ after the queen's rout through out all the towns as they passed with trumpes
and canayres / to do him the greatter dispyte / till at the last they came to
the Cite of Herford / where as the queen was honorably received with great
solempnyte / and all her company and there she kept the feast of all sayntis with
great royalte / for the love of her son and strangers yt were there.

How sir Hew Spencer was put to his judgment. Cap. xiii.
When this feast was done: than sir Hew Spencer who was nothing beloved was
brought forth before the queen and all the lords and knights / and there
before him in writing was rehearsed all his dedis / against the which he would
give no manner of answer. And so he was than judged by plain sentence. First to
be drawn on an hyrdell with trumpes and trumpettis through all the cite of
Herford and after / to be brought into the market place / where as all the
people were assembled / and there to be tied on high upon a ladder that every
man might se him / and in the same place there to be made a great fire / and
there his pryuy members cut from him / because they reputed him as an
herety(...) / and so demed / and so to be brent in the fire before his face.
And than his heart to be drawn out of his body and cast into the fire / because
he was a false traitor of heart / and yt by his traitors counsel and
extorcio^ yt king had shamed his realm / and brought it to great myschief. for
he had caused to be behedded the greattest lords of his realm. by whom y^
realm ought to have been sustained and defended. And he had so enduced the king
/ that he would not se the queen his wife nor Edward his eldest son and caused
him to chare them out of the realm for fere of their lives. And than his heed
to be stryken of and sent to London. And according to his judgment / he was
executed. Than the queen and all her lords took their way toward London / and
did so much by their iourneys / that they arrived at the Cite of London / and
they of the cite with great company met them / and did to the queen and to
her son great reverence / and to al their company as they thought it best
bestowed. And when they had been thus received and feasted the space of.xv.
days / the knyghtis strangers / and namely sir John^ of Heynaulte had great
desire to return again into their own countres / for they thought they had
well done their devour / and achyued greathonour / and so took their leave of
the queen / and of the lords of the realm and the queen and the lords
required them to tarry longer a little space to se what should be done with the
king / who was in prison / but the strangers had so great desire to return
into their own countries / that to pray them the contrary auayled not. And
when the queen and her counsel saw that. They yet desired sir John^ of
Heynaulte to tarry till it was past Christmas / and to retaygne with him such
of his company as pleased him best. The gentle knight would not leave to
parfourme his service / but courtesly granted the queen to tarry as long as it
pleased her. and caused to tarry such of his company as he coud get that was
but a few for the remnaunt would in no wise tarry / Whereof he was displeased.
When the queen and her counsel saw that they would not abide for no prayers /
than they made them great chere and feastis. And the queen made to be given to
them plenty of gold and silver for their costis and seruicis / and did give
great Jewelles to each of them according to their degrees / so as they all
held them self right well content. And over that they had silver for their
horses such as they would leave behind them at their own estymation without
any grudgyng. And thus sir John^ of Heynaulte aboode still with a small
company among the englisshemen / who always did him as much honor as they
could ymagyn and to all his company. And in like wise so did the ladies and
damozelles of the country. For there were great plentye of countesses / and
great ladies gentle pucels who were come thither to acompany the queen. For it
seemed well to them that y^ knight ser John^ of Heynaulte had well deserved y^
chere and feast that they made him.

The coronacion of king Edwarth the third. Cap. xiiii.
AFter that the most part of the company of Heynault were departed / and ser
John^ Heynaulte lord of Beamond tarried. The queen gave leave to her people to
be part / saving a certain noble knyghtis the which she kept still about her
and her son. To counsel them / and commanded all them that departed to be
at London the next Christmas / For as than she was determined to keep open
court / and all they promised her so to do. And when Christmas was come / she
held a great court. And thither came dukes / earls / harous / knyghtis and all
the nobles of the realm with prelates and burgesses of good towns / and at
this assemble it was abuysed ye the realm coud not long endure without a
h(...) and a chief lord Than they put in writing all the dediss of the king
who was in prison / and all that he had done by evil counsel / and all his
vsagess / and evil behauyngis / and how evil he had governed his realm / the
which wass ^edd openly in plain audience to thentent that the noble sagis of
the realm might take thereof good aduyce / (...) to fall at acorde how the
realm should be governed from thensforth. and when all the casess and dedis
that the king had done and consented to and all his behauyng and vsagis were
red / and well vndest and. The harone and knyghtis and al y^ counsels of the
realm / drew them aparte to counsel / and the most part of them accorded /
and namely the great lords and nobles with the burgesses of y^ good towns
according as they had hard say / and knew them self the most part of his
dedis. Wherefore they concluded that such a man was not worthy to be a king nor
to bear a crown roy all / nor to have the name of a king. But they all
accorded that Edward his eldeste son who was there present / and was ryghful
heir should be crowned king instead of his father / so that he would take good
counsel sage and true about him / so that the realm from thensforth might be
better governed than it was before / and that the old king his father should be
well and honestly kept as long as he lived according to his astate. and thus as
it was agreed by all the nobles / so it was accomplysshed / and than was
crowned with a crown roy all at the palaice of Westminster beside London the young
king Edward the.iii. who in his bays after was rightfortunate and happy in
arms. This coronacion wass in the year of our lord.M. CCC.xxvi. on christymas
day / and as than the young king was about the age of xvi. and they held the
fest till the co^uercion of sayut Paul folo wyng / and in the mean time greatly
was fested sir John^ of Heynaulte and all the princis and nobles of his
country. and was given to him and to his company many rich Jewels. And so he
and his company in great feast and solas both with lordis and ladies tarried
till the.xii. day. And than ser John^ of Heynault hard tydyngis / how (...) the
king of Bayghan / and the earl of Heynault his brother and other great plenty
of lordis of France / had ordained to be at Conde at a great feast and turney
that was there cried. Than would sir John^ of Heynaulte no longer abide for no
prayer / so great desire he had to be at the said tourney and to se the earl
his brother and other lordis of his country / and specially the right noble
king in larges the gentle Charles king of Bayghan / wha^ ye young king Edward
and the queen his mother and the barons saw yt he would no longer tarry / and
that their request could not avail / they gave him leave sore against their
wyls / and the king by the counsel of the queen his mother did give him.CCCC.
markis ste^lyng is of (...) heritable to hold of him in fee to be paid every
year in the town of Bruges. And also did give to Philyp of Chastaulre his
chief esquyer and his sovereign counselor.C. mark of rent yearly to be
paid at the said place / and also delivered him much money to pay therewith
the costis of him and of his company till he come (...) to his own country. and
caused him to be conducted with many noble knyghtis to Dover / and there
delivered him all his passage free. And to the ladies that were come into
Ingland with the queen and namely to the countess of Garre^nes / who was
suster to the earl of hare / and to diverse other ladies and damozels / there
were given many feyre and rich jewels at their departing. And when ser John^
of Heynaulte was departed fro ye young king Edward and all his company / and were
come to Dover. they entered encontyne^t into their ships to pass the sea to
the intent to come be times to the said tourney and there went with him.xv. young
lusty knights of Ingland to go to this tourney with him and to acqueynt them
with the strange lordis and knights that should be there / and they had great
honor of all the company that turneyd at that time at Conde.

How that king Robert de Breux of Scotland defied king Edward. Cap. xv.
AFter that sir John of Heynault was departed fro king Edward / he and y^ queen
his mother governed the realm by the counselle of the Earl of Kent uncle to
the king / And by the counsel of sir Roger Mortymer who had great lands in
Ingland / to the su^me of. vu. C.li. of rent yearly: And they both were
^anisshed and chased out of England with (...) queen as ye have hard before.
Also they used much after ye counsel of ser Thomas wage and by the advise of
other / who were reputed for the most sagest of the realm. How be it there were
some hadd envy thereat / the which never dyed in Ingland / and also it reigns
and will reign in diverse other countres. Thus passed ^orth the winter and the
lent season till Easter / and than the king and the queen and all the realm
was in good peace all this season. Than ^o it fortuned / that king Robert of
Scotland / who had been rygh hardy and had suffered much travail against
Inglisshmen / and often times he had been chased and discom^eted / in the time
of king Edward the first / grau^dfather to this young king Edward the.iii. he
was as than become very old and ancient and sick (as it was said) of the
great evil and malady. When he knew thadu^tures that was fallen in Ingland
how that the old king Edward the.ii. Was taken and deposed down fro his
regalley and his crown and certain of his cou^sellours behedded and put to
destruction / as ye have hard here before. Than he bethought hy yt he would
defye the young king Edward the.iii. because he was young / and that the barons
of the realm were not all of one accord as it was said. therefore he the
better to speed in his purpose to conquer part of Ingland. And so about Easter
in the year of our lord.M. CCC.xxvii. he sent his defyau^ce to the young king
Edward the.iii. and to all the realm. sendyng them Word / how that he would
enter into the realm of Ingland and brenne before him / as he had done before
time / at such seson as the discomfeture was at the castle of Estermelin:
where as the Inglisshmen received great damage. When the king of Ingland and
his counsel perceived that they were defied / they caused it to be known over
all the realm: and commanded that all the nobles and all other should be ready
appareled every man after his estate: and that they should be by Ascen ^^on day
next after at the town of york / standing northward. The king sent much
people before to keep the fronters against Scotland / And sent a great
ambassade to sir John^ of Heynault praying him right effectuously y^ he would
help to socour and to keep company with him in his voyage against the Scottis
/ and that he would he with him at the Asce^cion day next after / at york /
with such company as he might get of men of war / in those parties. When
ser John^ of Heynaulte lord of Beamonde hard y^ kyngis desire / he sent
straight his letters and his messengers in every place / where as he thought to
recover / or attaigne to have any company of men of war. Inflaunders / in
Heynaulte / in Brabant / and in other places desyryng them yt in their best
apparel for the war: they would mete him at Wysant for to go over the sea
with him into Ingland. And all such as he sent unto / came to him with a glad
chere: and diverse other that hard thereof in trust to attaigne to as much
honor as they had that were with him in Ingland before at the other voyage. So
that by that time y^ said lord Beamond was come to Wysant / there was ready
ships / for him and his company brought out of Ingland. And so they took
shyppyng and passed over the sea / and arrived at Dover / and so than seized
not to ride till they came within.iii. days of Penthecoste to the town of
york / where as the king and the queen his mother / and all his lordis were
with great host taryeng the coming ofsir John^ of Heynaulte / and had sent
many before of their men of arms / archers and comen people of the good towns
and villages / and as people resorted / they were caused to be loged.ii.
or.iii. leges of alabout in the country. And on a day thither came sir John^ of
Heynaulte and his company / who were right welcome and well received / both of
the king / of the queen his mother / and of all other barons / and to them was
delivered the sub barbes of the cite / to lodge in. And to sir John^ of
Heynaulte was delivered an abbey of white monks for him and his howsold. There
came with him out of Heynaulte / ye lord of Angiew who was called sir Gualtier
/ and sir Henry lord Dantoing / and the lord of Saignoles / and sit Fastres de
Rae / sir Robert de Batlleul / and sir Guilliam de Bailleul his brother / and
the lord of Hauereth chasteleyne of Mons / ser Allard de Brysnell / ser
Mychell de Ligne / ser John^ de Me^ tigni the younger and his brother / sir
Sawse de Boussat / the lord of Go^megines / sir Percyual de Seuernes / the
lord of Byaurien / and the lord of Floien. Also of the country of Flanders
There was ser Hector of Uilais / sir de Rodes / ser Umslart de Guistell / the
lord of Traces sir Guyssuyn de la Muele / and diverse came thither of the
country of Brahant / as the lord of Dufle sir Tyrry of Uaucourt / sir Rasse

and Artoys / there were come certain knights of their own good wylles to
auau^ce their bodies / so that sir John^ of Heynaulte had well in his
company.v. C. men of arms well apparailed / and richely mounted. And after the
feast of Penthecost came thither / sir Guyllaume de Juliers / who was after
duke of Juliers after y^ dissease of his father / and sir Henry Tyrry of
Branberque / who was after earl of Los / and with them a ryghtfayre row^^ / and
all to keep company with the gentle knight sir John^ of Heynaulte lord
Beamont.

The discencion that was bitwene the archers of Inglande and themof Heynaulte.
Cap. xvi.
THe gentle king of England the better to fest these strange lords and all
their company held a great court on Trynite sunday in ye friars / where as he
and the queue his mother were lodged / keeping their house each of them apart.
All this feast the king had well.v. C. knyghtis / and.xv. were new made. And
the queen had well in her court.lx. ladies and damozelles / who were there
ready to make feast and chere to sir John^ of Heynaulte and to his company.
There might have been seen great nobles / plenty of all manner of strange
vitaile. There were ladies and damozelless fre shly apparayled ready to have
daunced / if they might have leave. But incontinent after dyuer there began a
great fraye bitwene some of the gromes and pages of the strangers / and of the
archers of Inglande / who were lodged among them in the said subbarbis / and
anon all the archers assembled them to gether with their bows and drove the
strangers home to their lodgings and the most part of the knyghtis and
masters of them were as then in the king is court / but as soon as they
hard tidings of the fray each of them drew to their own lodgyng in great
have such as might enter / and such as could not get in / were in great
parell. For the archers who were to the nombre of.iii. M. shot fast their
arowes / not sparyng masters nor varlettis. And it was thought and supposed
that this sraye was begone / by some of the frendis of y^ Spencers / and of
the earl of Arundels / who were put to death before / by the a^de and counsel
of sir John^ of Heynaulte as ye have hard before / as than parauenture thought
to be some what reueged / and to set discord in the host. And so the
Inglysshemen / that were hosts to these strangers shoot fast their doors /
and wyndowes / and would not suffer them to enter in to their lodgyngis.
howbeit some gate in on the back side and quickly armed them / but they durst
not issue out into the street for fear of the arowes. Than the strangers
brake out on the back side and brake down pales and hedges of gardens and
drew them into a certain plain place / and aboode their company / till at
the last they were a.C. and above of men of arms / and as many vnharnest /
such as could not get to their lodgyuges. And when they were assembled to
gether they hasted them to go and succoure their compaignyons / who defended
their lodgyngis in y^ great street. And as they went forth they passed by ye
lodgyng of the lord Denghyen / where as there were great gatis both before and
behynd openyng into the great street / and the archers of Ingland shot fersly
at the house / and there were many of the Henaus hurt / and the good knight of
Austre de Rue / and sir John^ Parceuall de Meries / and sir Sanse de Boussac /
these.iii. could not enter in to their lodgyngis to arm them. but they did as
valiantly as though they had been armed. They had great leuers in their handis /
the which they found in a carpenters yard. With the which they gave such
strokis that men burst not aproche to them. They.iii. bette down that day /
with such few company as they had mo than.lx. For they were great and mighty
knights. Finally the archers that were at the fraye were discomfetted and put
to chase and there was deed in the place well to the nombre of.CCC. And it was
said they were all of y^ busshopprike of Lyncoln^. Itrowe god did never give
more grace and fortune to any people. than he did as than / to this gentle
knight / sir John^ of Heynaulte and to his company. For these Inghsshe archers
intended to none other thing / but to murder and to rob them / for all that
they were come to serve the king in his business. These strangers were never
in so great parell / all the season that they lay / northey were (...) every
man had takyn his place to lodge there al night. Than the lords drew them
aparte / to take counsel how they might fight with the scottis. considering
the country that they were in / for as far as they could understand. the
scottis went ever foreward all about burning / and wastyng the country and
parceyued well how they could not in any wise / feyght with them among these
mountaignes without great parell or danger / and they saw well also they
could not overtake them. But it was thought that the scottis must n^dis pass
again y^ river of Tyne home ward. Therefore it was determined by great aduyce
and counsel / that all the oste should remove at mydnyght / and to make haste
in the morning to the intent to stop the passage of the river from the
Scottis / whereby they should be aduysed by force / either to fight with them /
orels to abide still in Inglande to their great danger and loss. And to this
conclusion / all the oste was accorded and so supped and lodged as well as they
might that night / and every man was warned to be ready at the first soundyng of
the trumpette. And at the secunde blaste every man to arm him without delay /
and at the.iii. every man quyckely to mou^te on their horses / and to draw
under their own sta^dard and baner / and every man to take with him but one
lost of breed / and to trust it behind him on his horse. It was also
determined / that they should leave behind them all their loose harneys and
all manner of cariagis and purueyaunces / for they thought surely to feyght with
the scottis the next day / what so ever danger they were in thynkyng to
ieo^de either to win or to leese all. And thus it was ordained and so it was
acco^plysshed / for about mydnyght every man was ready apparailed / few had
slepte but little / and yet they had sore traualed the day before. Is great
haste as they made or they were well raunged in batell / the day began to
appear Than they auau^ced forward in all have through mou^taignes valeys / and
rokkes / and through many evil passages / without any plain country. And on
the highest of these hills / and on the plain of these valeys / there were
meruaylouse great marshes and dangerous passages / that it was great marvel
that much people had not ben lost / for they roode ever still forward / and
never tarried one for another / for who so ever fell (...) any of these marshes
with much pain could get any aid to help them out again. So that in
diverse places there were many lost and specially horse and cariages and often
times in the day there was cried alarm / for it was said ever that the foremost
company of their oste were fyghtyng with their ennemies. so that the hinder most
went it had been true / wherefore they hasted them over rokkis and stones and
mountaygnes with helm and sheld ready apparailed to fight / with spear and
sword ready in hand with out tariyng for father / brother / or companyon. And
when they had thus ron forth often times in the day the space of half a mile
to gyther toward the cry wenyng it had been their enemies. They were
deceived / for the cry ever arose by the reysyng of hartis hyndis / and other
savage beastis that were seen by them in y^ forewarde / after the which
beastis they made such showtyng and criyng / that they that came after went
they had been a fyghtyng with their ennemies. Thus rode forth all that day /
the young king of Inglande by mou^taignes and destis / without fyndyng any high
way / town / or village. And wha^ it was against night they came to the river
of Tyne / to the same place / Where as the scottis had passed over in to
Inglande Wenyng to them / that they must nedis repasse again the same way.
Than the king of Inglande / and his oste passed over the same river with such
gydis as he had* with much pain and travail / for y^ passage was full of
great stones And when they Were over / they lodged them that night by the
river side / and by that time the Son was goon to rest / and there was but
few among them that had other axe or hoke / or any instrument to cut down
any woodde to make their lodgyng is withal / and there Were many that had
lost there own company / and wist not where they were. Some of the footeme^
were far behind / and wist not well what way to take / but such as knew
best the country said plainly they had rydden the same day.xxiiii.
english miles / for they roode as fast as they might without any rest / but
at such passages / as they could not chese / all this night they lay by this
river side / still in their harneys / holding their horses by their raynes in
their handts / for they wist not whereunto to tie them. Thus their horses did
eat no meat of all that night nor day before. They had another ootes nor
forage for them. Nor the people of the oste had no sustenau^ce of all that day
nor night but every man his loffe that he had carried be hynde him / the
which was sore wette with the swette of the horses / nor they drank none
other drink but the water of the river / Withowte it were some of the lordis /
that had carried botels with them / nor they had no fire nor light / for they had
nothing to make light withal without it were some of y^ lords that had
torches brought with them. In this great trouble and danger they passed all
that night / their armor still on their backis / their horses ready sadled. And
when the day began to appear* the which was greatly de sired of all y^ hole
oste / they trusted than to synd some redress for them self / and for their
horses orels to fight with their ennemies / the which they greatly desired /
to thentene to be delivered out of y^ great travail and pain that they had
endured / and all that day it rayned so fast that the river and passage was
waxen great / and risen so high y^ or it were noone there might none pass the
passages again. Wherefore they could not se^de to know where as they were / nor
where to have any forage or lytter for their horses / nor bread nor drink for
their own sustinau^cis but so all y^ night they were feign to fast / nor their
horses had nothing but leaves of trees and herbes^ they cut down bows of trees
with their swerdes to tie withal their horses / and to make themself lodges.
And about noone some poor folks of y^ country were found / and they said
how they were as than.xiiii. mile from Newcastell upon Tyne / and.xi. mile
from Carlyle. and that there was no town nerer to them / wheri they might
find any thing to do them ease withal. And when this was showed to y^ king /
and to the lords of his counsel / incontinent were sent thither horses and
sompters to fetch thens some p^ueya^ce and there was a cry in the kyngis name
made in y^ town of Newcastell / y^ who so ever would bring bread or wine or
any other vitaile should be paid therefore incontinent at a good price / and
that they should be conducted to the oste in save guard / for it was publisshed
openly that y^ king nor his oste would not depart from the place y^ they were
in / till they had some tydyng^ where their ennemies were become. And the next
day by noone such as had bensent for vitaile returned again to the oste with
such purueyau^cis as they could get / and that was not over much and with
them came other folkis of the country with little nagges charged with bread
evil bakyn in panyers / and small pere wine in barels and other vitaile to
sell in the oste / whereby great part of the oste were well refresshed and eased.
and thus they continued day by day the space of.viii. days abidyng eueryday y^
retournyng again of y^ scott^ / who knew no more where y^ englissh ostelay.
tha^ they knew where they were / so each of them were ignorant of other.
Thus.iii. days and.iii. nyghtis / they were in manner withowte bread / wine /
candel or light / ^oder / or forage / or any manner of purueyau^ce / other for
horse or m^ and after the space of.iiii. days a lotte of bread was sold
for.vi. d. the which was worth but ^i. d. And a gallon of wine for.vi.
grootis that was worth but.vi. d. And yet for all that / there was such rage
of famine / that each took vitailes out of others handis. whereby there rose
diverse batels and stryffes bitwene sundry companyo^s and yet beside all these
mischieffis it never seized to rain all the hoole week. Whereby their saddels
/ pannels / and countresyngles were all rottyn and broken / and most part at
their horses hurt on their backs / nor they had not wherewith to shoo them /
that were vnshodde / nor they had nothing to cover them self withal fro y^
rain and cold / but grene busshes / and their armor Nor they had no thing to
make fire withal but grene bows / y^ which would not burn bicauof the rain.
In this great mischief / they were all the week / without heryng of any word
of the scottis. upon trust they should repasse again into their own countries
the same way or uere there about / Whereby great noise and murmour began to rise
in the oste / for some said and laid it to others charge / that by their
counsel the king and all they were brought in to that danger / and that they
had done it to betraye y^ king and all his ooste. Wherefore it was ordained by
the king and by his counsel / that the next morning they should remove the
ooste / and repasse again the river / about.vii. mile thens / where as they
might pass more at their ease. Than was it cried through out the oste / that
every man should be ready apparailed to remove / the next day by times. Also
there was a cry made / that who so ever could bring to the king certain
knowledge where the scotts were / he y^ brought first tydyng is thereof should
have for his labor a.C.li. land to him / and to his heirs for ever / and to
be made a knight of the kyngis hand. When this cry was made in the oste
diverse englisshe knyghtis and squiers to the nombre of ^xv. or.xvi. for
couetyse of wynnyng of this promise. they passed the river in great parell /
and rode forth through the mountaignes / and departed each one from other
taking their adventure. The next morning the oste dislodged and rode fair and
easily all the day for they were but evil apparailed / and did so much yt
they repassed again the river with much pain and travail / for the water was
deep / because of the rayn that had fallen / wherefore many did swym and some
were drowned. And when they were alouer / than they lodged the oste / and there
they found some forage / meadows and feldis about a little village / the which
the scott^ had bre^t wh^ they past that way / and the nerte day they departed
frothens and paste over hyls and dales all day till it was noone / and than
they found some villages brent by the scottis / and there about was some
champyon country with corn and meadows / and so that night the ost lodged
there. Again the.iii. day they rode forth so that the most part of the oste
wist not which way / for they knew not the country / nor they could here no
tydyng is of the scottis. And again the (...). day they rode forth ilyke manner
/ till it was about the hour of. iii and there came a squire fast tydyng toward
the king / and said. And it like your grace I have brought you parfit tidings
of the scotts your ennemies. surely they be within.iii. mile of you / lodged
on a great mountain abidyng there for you / and there they have been all
this.viii. days / nor they knew no more tidyngis of you / than ye did of them
ser this y^ I show you is of troth for I aproched so nere to them that I was
takyn prisoner and brought before y^ lords of their oste / and there I showed
them tydyngis of you / and how that ye seek for them to then^ent to have
batell. and the lordis did quyt me my rau^som and prison / when I had showed
them how your grace had promised a.C.li. sterlyng of rent to him y^ brought
first tydyng is of them to you and they made me to promise yt I should not rest
/ till I had showed you this tydyngys for they said they had as great desire
to fight with you as ye had with them / and there shall ye find them without
fault / and as soon as the king had hard this tidings he assembled all his
ooste in. fair medowe to pasture their horses / and besidis there was little
abbey y^ which was all brent called in y^ days of king Arthur le Blanch
land. There the king confessed him and every man made him ready. The king caused
many masses to be song / to howsell all such as had devotion thereto. And
incontyuent he assigned a.C.li. sterlyng of rent to the squier that had brought
him tidyng is of the scottis / according to his pmyse / and made him knight his
own handis before all the oste. And when they had well rested them / and takyn
repaste. Than the ^compet sounded to horse / and every man mounted / and the
baners and standers followed this new made knight / every batell by itself i^
good order through mou^taignes and dales raynged as well as they might ever
ready apparailed to fight / and they roode / and made such have that about
noone they were so nere the scottys / that each of them might clearly se
other. And as soon as the Scottis saw them / they Issued owte of their
lodges a foot / and ordained.iii. great batelles / in the auaylynge of the
hill. and at the foot of this mountaygne / there ran a great river full of
great rocks and stones / so that none might pass over / withowte great
danger or ieopardye / and though the englisshmen had passed over the river.
yet was there no place nor rowme / between the hylle and the river / to set
the battle in good order. The Scottis had, stablysshed their two first
batelles / at the two corners of the mountaigne ioynyng to the rocks / So that
none might well mount upon the hill to assail them / But the scottis were
ever ready to beat with stones the assaylantis if they passed the river. And
when the lords of Inglande saw the behauyng and the manner of the scottis.
they made all their people to a light a foot. and to put of their spurris and
araynged.iii. great batelles / as they had done before / and there were made
many new knyghtis. And when their batelles were set in good order. Than some
of the lords of Inglande brought their young king a horse back before all the
batelles of the oste to the intent to give thereby the more courage to all his
people The which king in full goodly manner prayed and required them right
graciously that every man would pain them to do their best to save his
honor and common weal of his realm. And it was commanded upon pain of death
/ that none should go before the marsha's baners nor break their arraye /
without they were commanded. And than the king commanded / that they should
advance toward their enemies fair and easily / and so they did / and every
batell went forth in good array and order a great space of ground to the
discendyng of the mountaygne / where as the scottis were. And this the
englisshe oste did to thentent to se if their ennemies would break their field
or not. and to se what they would do / but they could not parceyue that they
were about to remove i^ any wise / they were so nere to guyther that they might
know each others arms. Than the oste stood still to take other counsel. And
some of the oste mounted on good horses and rode forth to skrymysshe with them
/ and to behold the passage of the river / and to se the countynaunce of
their enemies more nerer. And there were harauldis of arms sent to the
Scottis. gyuyng them knowledge if that they would come and pass y^ river to
fight with them in the plain field / they would draw back fro the river / and
give them sufficient place to araynge their batelles / either the same day
orels the next / as they would chose them self orels to let them do like wise
/ and they would come over to them. And when the scottis is hard this they
took counsel among theymselfe. and anon they answered the harauldes how they
mold do another the ouenor the other / and said syrs / yor king and his lordisse
well how we be here in this realm / and have br^nt and wasted y^ country as
we have passed through / and if they he displeased there with let them amend
it when they will / for here we will abide / as long as it shall please us. And
as soon as the king of Ingland hard that answer / hit was incontinent cried /
that all the oste should lodge there y^ night without reculyug back / And so
the oste lodged there that night with much pain on the hard ground and stones
/ always still armed. They had no stakes nor roddis to tie withal their
horses / nor forage / nor husshe to make withal any tire / And when they were
thus lodged. Than the scottis caused some of their people to keep still the
field / where as they had ordained their batelles / and y^ remnant went to
their lodgings and they made such fyers that it was merueile to behold. And
bitwene the day and the night they made amerueilus great brute / with blowyng of
horns all at ones / that it seemed proprely that all the deuelles of hell had been there. Thus these two ostis were lodged that night. The which was saint
Peter's night / in the beginning of Auguste. The year of our lord.M.
CCC.xxvii. And the next morning / the lords of Inglande hard Mass / and
rayngen again their batelles / as they had done the day before. And the
Scottis in like myse ordered ther^ batelles. Thus both the ottis stood still in
batell / till it was noone. The Scottis made never semblaunt to come to the
English oste to fight with them / nor in like wise the englisshe men to them
/ For they could not aproche to g^ther withowte great damage. There were
diverse compaignyons a horse back / that passed the River / and some a foot /
to skrymyss^e with the Scottis. And in like wise some of the Scotts brake out
/ and skrymysshed with them So that there were diverse on both parties slain
/ wounded / and takyn prisoners. And after that noone was paste / The lords of
Juglande commanded every man / to draw to their lodgyng. For they saw well
the Scottis would not fight with them / and in like manner thus they did.iii.
days to gyther / and the scottis in like case kept still their mountaygnes /
How be it there was skrymysshynge on both parties / and diverse slain / and
prisoners takyn. And every night the Scottis made great fyres and great brute
with showttyng and blowyng of horns. The entencion of the englylshe men was /
to hold the scottis there / in mauer as beseged. For they could not fight
with them / there as they were / Thynkyng to have famysshed them. And the
english men knew well by such prisoners as they had takyn / that y^
Scottis had another bredde / wine / norsalte / nor other purueyaunce / save of
beastis they had great plentye / the which they had takyn in the country /
and might eat at their pleasure without bredde / which was an evil dyette /
for they lacked oten meal to make cakes withal / as is said before / the
which diet some of the englisshe men used when they haddenede / specially
borderers / when they make rodes into Scotland. And in y^ morning the.iiii.
day the englyssh men looked on the mou^taigne where as the Scottis were and they
could se no creature / for the scottis were depted at mydnyght. Than was there
sent men a horse back and afoote over the river to know where they were
become. And about noone they found them lodged on another mountaigne more
stronger than the other was / by the same river side / and where there was a
great wodde on the one side to goo and come secretly when they list. Than
incontinent the english oste dislodged / and brewe to that part in batelled
in good order and lo^^ed them on another hill against the scottis / and
raynged their batelles / and made semblant to have come to them. Than the
Scottis issued out of their lodges and set their batels along y^ ryuersyde
against them / but they would never come toward the englisshe oste / and y^
englisshmen could not go to them wout they would have been slain or take at
auau^tage. Thus they lodged each ^^cust other y^ space of.xviii. days and
often times y^ king of England sent to them his harauldis of arms offering
them / that yt they would some and fight with him he would give them place
sufficient on the plain ground to pytche their field / Or else let them
give him rowme and place / and he assured them / that he would come over the
river and fight with them but the scottis would never agree them to. Thus both
the oostis suffered much pain and travail / the space that they lay so nere
to gyther / and the first night that the englisshe o^^ was thus lodged on the
secund mou^taigne / the lord willyam Duglas took with him about CC. men of
arms / and past the river far of fro the oste / so that he was not parceyued
/ and suddenly he brake into the english ooste about mydnyght criyng Duglas
Duglas ye shall all dpe thieves of Juglande / And he slew or he seass^^ CCC.
men / some in their beddis / and some skant ready / and he struck his horse with
the spurs / and came to the kyngis own tent / always criyng Duglas / and
struck a sundre.ii. or.iii. cordis of the kings tent and so departed / and in
y^ retret he lost some of his men. Than he returned again to y^ scotts / so
that they was no more done / but every night the englisshe oste made good and
sure watch / for they doubted making of skryes / and ever the most part of the
oste lay in their harneys. and every day there were skrymysshes made / and men
slain on both parties / and in conclusion y^ last day of.xxiiii. there was a
scottisshe knight taky^ / who against his will showed to the lords of Ingland
/ what state and condition the scotts were in / he was so sore examyned / that
for fear of his life he showed how y^ lords of Scotland were accorded among
them self / that the same night every man should be ready armed. and to follow
the baners of the lord Wyllyam Duglas and every man to keep him secret / but
y^ knight could not show them what they intended to do Than the lordis of
Ingland drew them to counsel and there it was thought among them / that the
scottis might in the night time come and assail their oste on both sides to
adventure themself other to live or dye / for they could endure no longer the
famyne that was among them. Than the english lords ordained.iii. (...)at
batels / and so stood in.iii. parties without their lodgyngis / and made great
fyers / thereby to se the better / and caused all their pages to keep their
lodgyngis and horses. Thus they stood still all yt night armed every man under
his own sta^dard and baner and in the brekyng of the day ^ii. trompettis of
Scotland met with the englisshe scout watch / who took the trompettis and
brought them before the king of Ingland and his consaile / and than they said
openly. Sirs what do ye watch here / ye lose but your time / for on the
ieopardye of our heedis. the scottis are gone and departed before mydnyght /
and they are at y^ lest by this time.iii. or.iiii. mile on their way and they
left us.ii. behynd to thentent that We should show this to you. Than the
englisshe lords said / that it were but a folly to follow the scottis. For they
saw Well they could not over take them / yet for doubt of disceyuyng / they
kept still the two trompettis pryuely / and caused their batailes to stand
still araynged / till it Was nere prime. And when they saw for troth that the
scottis were departed. Than every man had leave to retraye to their lodgyng and
the lords took counsel to determyn what should be best to do. And in the
mean time diverse of the inglisshe oste mounted on their horses / and passed
over the river / and came to the mountaigne / where as the scottis had been /
and there they found mo than.v. C. great bestis ready slain / because the
scottis could not drive them before their ooste / and because that the
englisshe men should have but small profit of them Also there they found. CCC.
caudrons made of bestes skynnes / with the hear still on them strayned on
stakes over the fire full of water and full offlesshe to be sodden and mo than
a.M. spyttes full of flesh to be roasted. And mo than.x. M. old shoos made of
raw lether / with the hear still on them / the which the scottis had left
behynd them. Also there they found.v. poor englysshemen prisoners bound
fast to certain trees / and some of their legs broken / tha^ they were
losed and let go. and than they returned again and by that time all the oste was
dislodged / and it was ordained by the king and by the aduyce of his counsel
that the hole oste should follow the marshals baners / and draw homeward in to
Ingland / and so they did / and at y^ last came into a fair meadow / where as
they found forage sufficient for their horses and cariagis. whereof they had
great need / for they were nigh so feeble that it should have been great pain
for them / to have goon any forther. The englisshe cronicle says / that the
scottis had been fought with all / and sir Roger Mortymer a lord of Inglande
had not betrayed the king / for he took mede and money of the scottis / to
thentent they might depart pryuely by night vnfoughte with all / as hit may
be seen more plainly in the englisshe Cronycle / and diverse other matters / the
which I pass over at this time / and follow mine auctour. And so than the
next day the oste dislodged again and went forth / and abowte noone they came
to a great abbey / two mile fro the cite of Durham / and there the king lodged
/ and the oste there about in the feldis / Where as they found forage
sufficient / for them self and for their horses / and the next day the oste
lay there still / and the king went to the cite of Durham to se the church /
and there he offered. And i^ this cite every man found their own cariagis the
Which they had left.xxxii. days before in a wodde at mydnyght / when they
followed the scottis syrst / as it has benshewed before / for the burgesses and
people of Durham / had found and brought them into their town at their
own costis and chargis. And all these cariages were set in void granges and
barnes in save guard / and on every man's carriage his own cognisau^ce or
arms. Whereby every man might know his own. And the lords and genty lme^
were glad / When they had thus found their cariages. Thus they abonde two
days in the cite of Durham and the oste round about. for they could not all
lodge within the cite. and there their horses Were new shoode. And than they
took their Way to the cite of york / and so with in.iii. days they came
thither / and there y^ king found the queen his mother. who received him with
great joy. And so did all other ladies damozelles / burgesses / and c^^mons of
the City. The king gave license to all manner of people / every man to draw
home ^arde to their own countries. And the king thanked greatly the Earls /
barons and knights of their good counsel and and that they had done to him
in his io^ney. And he retained still with him ser John^ of Heynaulte and all
his company / Who Were greatly feasted by y^ queen and all other ladies Than
the knyghtis and other strangers of his company made a byll of their horses /
and such other stuff as they had lost in that journey / and delivered it to
the kyngis counsel every man by itself / and in trust of the kyngis
promise. ser John^ of Heynaulte lord Beamont bound himself to all his
company / that they should be content for every thing comprised in their own
bills within a shortspace. For the king nor his counsel could nar so soon
recover gold or silver to content their desires / but he delivered them
sufficient by reason to pay all their small charges / and to bring them home
withal into their own countries. And anon after within y^ same year they were
paid for every thing they could desire. Than they of Heynnaulte bought little
^agges to ride at their case / their lackettes and pagis / and all their
harneys and baggages by water in.ii. ships that was delivered to them the
which ships with their (...) arrived at Sluice in Flaundders / and sir John^
of Heynnaulte and his company took their leave of the king / of the old queen
/ of the earl of Kent / of y^ earl of Lancastre / and of all the other barons
/ who greatly did honor them. And the king caused.xii. knightis / and. C*C.
men of arms to company them for doubt of the archers of England of Whom they
were not well assured / for they must needis pass through the busshopryke of
Lincoln^. Thus departed si^ John^ of heynaulte and his rowte / in the conduct
of these knyghtis and rode so long i^ their journey. that they came to Dover /
and there entered into the sea ishippis and vessels that they found ready there
apparayled for them. Than the ^adlist he knyghtis veparted fro thens / and
returned to their own houses / and the henous arrived at Wysant and there they
soiourned.ii. bays / in making ready their horses and harneys. And in y^ mean
time ser John^ of Heynault / and some of his company rode a pylgrimage to our
lady of Bollayn / and after they returned into Heynaulte and depted each fro
other to their own howses / and countres ser John^ of Heynaulte rode to therle
his brother who was at Ualenciennes / who received him ioyously / for greatly
he loved him. To Whom he recounted all his tydyng is that ye have hard here
before.

How king Edward was married to my lady Philyp of Heynaulte. Cap. xix.
HIt was not long after / but that the king / and y^ queen his mother / therle
of Kent his uncle / therle of Lancastre / sir Roger Mortymer / and all the
barons of Inglande / and by the aduyce of the kyngis counsel / they sent a
busshop / and.ii. knyghtis banerettis / with.ii. notable clerks / to ser John^
of Heynault pray enghym to be a mean that their lord y^ young king of Ingland
might have in marriage one of the eric^* boughts of Heynault his brother named
Phylyp. For the king and all the nobles of the realm had rather have her than
any other lady for the love of him. ser John^ of heynault lord Beamont feasted
and honored greatly these ambassadors / and brough them to Ualencie^nes to
therle his brother. who honorably receued them. and made them such chere / yt
it were over long here to rehearse. And when they had showed the content of
their message. Therle said. Sirs I thank greatly y^ king your prince / and the
queen his mother / and all other lords of Ingland / sith they have sent such
sufficient personages as ye be / to do me such honor as to treat for the
marriage. to the which request / I am well agreed. if our holy father the pope
will consent thereto. With y^ which answer these ambassadors were right well
co^te^t. Tha^ they sent.ii. knights and.ii. clerks incontinent to the pope to
Auygnon / to purchase a dispe^sation for this marriage to be had / for without
y^ popes licere they might not marie / for ye lineage of France they were so
nere of kyn / as at y^.iii. degree: for the.ii. mothers were cosyn Jermayns
issued of ii. brethern^. and when these ambasadors were come to the pope / and
their requests and consideratio^s well hard / our holy father the pope / with
all the hole college consentyd to this marriage / and so feasted them. And than
they departed and came again to Ualenciennes with their bulls. Than this
marriage was concluded and affirmed on both parties. Than was there devised /
and purueied for their apparaile / and for all things honorable / that
belonged to such a lady / who should be queen of Inglande / and there this
princess was married / by a sufficient procuration brought fro the king of
Inglande / and after al feast is and triumphs done. Than this young queen
entered into the sea at Wysant and arrived with all her company at Dover. And
and John^ of Heynaulte lord Beamont her uncle did conduct her to the cite of
London / where there was made great feast and many nobles of Ingland and the
queen was crowned. And there was also great iustes / tourneys daunsyng /
carolyng / and great feastis every day. The which enduced the space of.iii.
weekis. The englisshe cronicle says / this marriage / and coronation of the
queen was done at York / with much honor. the sunday in the even of the
conversion of saint Paul / in ye year of our lord.M. CCC.xxvii. In the which
cronicle is showed / many other things of the rulynge of the realm / and of
the death of king Edward of Carnaruan / and diverse other debates that were
within y^ realm as in the same Cronicle more plainly hit appears / the which
the auctor of this book speaks no word of / because ^auenture he knew it not.
for it was hard for a stranger to know all thyngis / but according to his
writing / This young queen Philyp aboode still in Inglande with a ^^^all company
of any ^sones of her own cou^tre^ / saving one who was named wandelet of Manny
/ who aboode still with the queen and was her karuer / and after did so many
great prowesses in diverse places / that it were hard to make mention of them
all.

How king Robert of Scotland dyed. Cap. xx.
ANd when that the scottis were departed by night from the mountaigne where as
the king of Ingland had beseged them / as ye have hard here before.

They went.xxii. Mile through that savage country without restyng / and
passed the river of ^yne / right nere to Carlyle. And ye next day they went
into their own land / and so departed every man to his own mansion* and
within a space af^ there was a peace purchased bitwene the kyngis of Ingland
and Scotland / and as the english cronicle says / it was done by the
special counsel of the old queen / and ser Roger Mortymer for by their
means / there was a plyament holden at North hampton at ye which the king
being within age / granted to the scottis to release all the feaulties and
homages that they ought to have done to the Crown of Inglande by his Charter
ens^aled. And also there was delivered to the scottis an endenture / the which
was called the Ragmon / wherein was contained all the homages and feaulties that
y^ king of scottis / and all the prelatis earls and barons of Scotland ought
to have done to the crown of Inglande / sealed with all their sealis with all
other rightis / that sundry barons and knyghtis ought to have had in the
realm of Scotlan^. And also they delivered to them again the black cross of
Scotland* the which the good king Edward conquered / and brought it out of
the abbey of Scoue / the which was a precious relic / and all rightis and
enteresses that every baron had in Scotland / was than clean forgyuen / and
many other thyngis were done at that parlyament / to the great hurt / and
prejudice of the realm of Ingland / and in manner against the wyls of all the
nobles of the realm save only of Isabell the old queen and the busshop of
Ely / and the lord mortymer. They ruled the realm in such wise / that every
man was myscontent. So yt the earl Henry of Lancastre / and sir Thomas
Brotherton earl marshall / and sir Edmund of Wodstocke the kings uncles / and
diverse other lords and commons / were agreed to gether to amend these
faults / if they might. And in that mean time y^ queen Isabell and sir Roger
Mortym^ / caused a another parliament to be holden at Salysbury / at the which
parliament / and Roger Mortymer was made earl of March / against all ye barons
wyls of England / in prejudice of ye king and his realm and sir John^ of
Eltham ye kyngis brother was made earl of Cornewal. To the which ^liame^t
there Henry of Lancaster would ^at come. wherefore the king was brought in
believe / that he would have distroyed his parson / for the which they assembled
a great host / and went to ward Bedforde / Where as the Earl Henry was with
his company. Than the Earl Marshall / and therle of Kent the kyngis brother
made a peace bitwene the king and ye earl of Lancaster on whose part was and
Henry lord Beamont / sir Fowke Fitzwayn / and Thomas Rocellin. ser William
Trussell / Sir Thomas Wyther / and abowte a.C. knyghtis who were all exyled out
of Inglande by the counsel of queen Isabell / and the Earl Mortym^ / for he
was so covetous yt he thought to have the most part of all their landis into
his own handis / as it is more plainly shown in ye inglisshe cronicle* the
which I pass over and follow mine auctour. The forsaid peace which was
purchased bitwene Ingland and Scotland was to endure.iii. year. And in the
mean time it fortuned that king Robert of Scotland was right sore aged / and
feeble* for he was greatly charged with the great sickness / so that there was no
way with him but death. And when he felt that his end drew nere / he sent for
such barons and lordis of his realm as he trusted best. and showed them /
how there was no remedy with him / but he must nedis leave this transetory life.
Co^mau^dyng them on the faith and troth yt they owed him / truly to keep the
realm / and aid ye young prince David his son / and that when he were of age
/ they should obey him and crown him king / and to mary him i^ such a place
as was convenient for his astate. Than he called to him the gentle knight sir
William Duglas / and said before all the lords. Sir William my dear fre^d ye
know well that I have had much a do my days to uphold and sustain the right
of this realm and wha^ I had most a do / I made a solemn vow / the which as
yet I have not accomplysshed / whereof I am right sorry. The which was / if I
might acheue and make an end of al my wars / so that I might ones have
brought this realm in rest and peace / than I promised in my mind to have gone
/ and warred on Christis ennemies / adversaries to our holy christen faith. To
this purpose mine heart has ever eaten ded / but our lord would not consent
thereto / for I have had so much a do in my days / and now in my last
entreprise I have takyn such a malady that I can not escape. And sith it is so
yt my body can not go nor acheue / yt my heart desires I Will send the heart
instede of the body to accomplyhssmyn auowe / and because I know not in all my
realm no knight more valiant than ye be / nor of body so Well furnysshed to
acco^plysshemyn avowe instead of my self. Therefore I require you mine own
dear aspeciall friend that ye will take on you this voyage for the love of me /
and to acquit my soul against my lord god. For I trust so much in your
noblenes and troth / that and ye will take on you / I doubt not / but that ye
shall achyue it / and than shall I dye in more ease and quiet. so that it be
done in such manner as I shall declare unto you. I woll yt as soon as I am
trepassed out of this world that ye take my heart owte of my body / and
enbawme it / and take of my treasoure / as ye shall think sufficient for that
entreprise / both for yor self / and such company as ye will take With you /
and present my heart to the holy S^pulchre Where as our lord lay. Seeing my
body can not come there / And take with you such company and purueyaunce. as
shall be aparteyuyng to your astate. And where so ever ye come let it be known /
how ye carry with you the heart of king Robert of Scotland / at his instau^ce
and desire / to be p^sented to the holy sepulcher. Tha^ all the lords that
hard these words / wept for pity. And when this knight sir William Duglas
might speak for weeping / he said. I gentle and noble king / a.C. times I thank
your grace of the great honor that ye do to me. Since of so noble and great
treasure / ye give me in charge And sir I shall do with a glad heart / all that
ye have commanded me / to the best of my true power how be it I am not worthy
nor sufficient to achyue such a noble entreprise. Than the king said a gentle
knight / I thank you so that ye will promise to do it. Sir said the knight / I
shall do it undoubtedly / by the faith that I owe to god and to the order of
knyghthodde. Than I thank you said the king / for now shall I dy^ in more
ease of my mind / since that I know / yt the most worthy and sufficient knight
of my realm shall achyue for me / the which I could never atteyne unto. And
thus soon after this noble Robert de Bruise king of Scotland / t^^passed out of
this uncertain world / and his heart taken out of his body / and enbaumed /
and honorably he was entered in the abbey of Donfremlyn / in the year of our
lord god.M. CCC.xxvii. the.vii. day of the month of Nouembre And when the
spryngyng time began. Than ser William Duglas purueied him of that which
aparteyned for his entreprise / and took his ship at the port of Morais in
Scotland / and sailed into Flanders to Shluce / to here tidings / and to
know if there were any noble man / in that country / that would go to
Jerusalem to the^tent to have more company / and he lay still at Sluice / ye
space of.xii. days or he departed / but he would never come alande / but kept
still his ship / and kept always his port and behauour with great Tryumphe /
with trumpettis and clarions / as though he had been king of scotts him self /
and in his company there was a knight baneret / and.vii. other knyghtis of the
realm of Scotland and.xxvi. young squiers and gentylme^ to serve him* and all
his vessel was of gold and silver / pottes basins / ewers / Dysshes / flagons
/ barels cups / and all other thyngis. And all such as would come and se him
/ they were Well served* with two manner of wynes / and diverse manner of spices
/ all manner of people according to their degres. And when he had thus tarried
there the space of.xii. days. he hard reported yt Alphons king of Spaigne made
war against a sarazyn king of Granade. Tha^ he thought to draw to that party
/ thynkyng suerely he could not bestow his time more nobly / tha^ to war
against goddis ennemies / and that entreprise done. tha^ he thought to go forth
to Jerusale^ / and to acheue that he was charged with. And so he departed. and
took the se to ward Spaigne / and arrived at ye port of Ualen^ the great. Than
he (...) straight to the king of Spaigne / who held his host against the king
of Granade sarazyn / and they were nere to gether on the fronters of his land
and within a while after that this knight sir William Duglas was come to ye
king of Spaigne On a day the king issued out into the field to aproche nere to
his ennemies. And ye king of Granade issued out in like wise on his part / so
that each king might se other with al their baners displayed. Than they arenged
their batels each against other. Than (...) William Duglas drew out on the one
side with all his company / to the intent to show his prowes the better.

And when he saw these batels thus ranged on both parties / and saw that ye
bataile of ye king of Spaigne began somewhat to advance toward their ennemies
/ he thought than verelye that they should soon assemble to gether to fight at
hand strokes / and than he thought rather to be with the formest / than with
the hyndemoost / and struck his horse with the spurs / and al his company
also / and dashte into the batelle of the king of Granade / criynge Duglas
Duglas. Wenyng to him / the king of Spaigne and his host had followed but they
did not / Wherefore he was disceyued / for the Spaignyss he host stood still.
And so this gentle knight was enclosed / and all his company with the sarazyns
/ where as he did meruelles in arms / but finally he could not endure / so
that he and all his company were slain. The which was great damage that ye
spaynyardis would not rescue them.

Also in this season there were certain lords that treated for peace bitwene
England and Scotland. So that at the last there was a marriage made / and
solempnised bitwene the young king of Scotland / and dame Johan of the tower
suster to king Edward of Ingland / at Berwyke as the inglisshe cronicle says
on Mary Maud ly^day. The year of our lord.M.iii. C.xxviii. against the assente
of many of the nobles of the realm. But queen Isabell the king is mother and
the earl Mortymer made that marriage. at ye which (as mine auctor says) there
was great feast made on both parties.

How Phylypp^ of Ualoys was crowned king of France. Cap. xxi.
King Charles of France son to the fair king Phylyp was.iii. times married /
and yet dyed without issue male. The first of his wives was one of the most
fairest ladies in all the world / and she was daughter to the earl of Artoys.
How be it she kept but evil the sacrament of matrimony / but brake her
wedloke Wherefore she was kept a long space in prison / in the castle Gaylarde
/ before that her husband was made king. And when the realm of France was
fallen to him / he was crowned by the assent of the.xii. dowsepiers of France
/ and tha^ because they would not that the realm of France should belong
without an heir male / they aduysed by their counsel / that the king should
be remaryed again and so he was to the daughter of the Emperor Henry of
Lucenbourg suster to the gentle king of Bayhaigne / Whereby the first marriage of
the king was fordoone between him and his wife that was in prison by the
license and declaracyon of ye pope / that was than / and by his.ii. wife / who
was right humble / and a noble wise lady. the king had a son / who dyed in
his young age / and the queen also / at Issodnii in Berrey. And they both dyed
suspeciously. Wherefore diverse parsones were put to blame after privily. And
after this the same king Charles was married again the.iii. time to the daughter
of his uncle / ye lord Loyes earl of Dewreux / and she was suster to the king
of Nauerre / and was named queen Johan. And so in time and space this lady was
with child / and in the mean time / the king Charles her husband fell sick /
and lay down on his death bed. And when he saw there Was no way with him
but death / he devised that if it fortuned the queen to be delivered of a son.
Than he would that the lord Phylyp of Ualoys should be his governor / and
regent of all his realm till his son come to such age as he might be
crowned king. and if it fortune ye queen to have a daughter / than he would that
all the.xii. piers of France should take advise and counsel for the forther
ordering of the realm / and that they should give the realm / and regally to
him that had most right thereto. And so within a while after ye king Charles
dyed about Ester / in the year of our lord.M. CCC.xxviii. And within a short
space after the queen was delyuerd of a daughter. Than all the peers of France
assembled a counsel together at Paris as shortly as they might conveniently /
and there they gave ye realm by common acorde to sir Phylippe of Ualoys: and
put clean out the queen Isabell of England / and king Edward her son / for
she was suster germayne to king Charles last deed but the opynion of the nobles
of France was / and said and maynteyned: that the realm of France was of so
great nobles / that it ought not by succession to fall into a woman's hand. And
so thus they crowned king of France Philypp^ Ualoys at Raygnes / on Trinyte
sunday next after. And anon after he somoned all his barownes and men of war^.
And went withal his power to the town of Cassell and laid ^^eg thereto / in
making war^ against the ^^emmynges / who rebelledde against their own lord.
And namely they of Bruges / of Ippre / and of Frank: for they would not obey
therle of Flanders. But they had chased him out of his own country / so that
he might not abide in no party thereof / but only in Gaunt / and scantly there.
These fle^mynges were a.xvi. thousand / and had a capytayne called Colen
^a^nequyn a hardy man and a courageous. And they had made their grayson at
Cassell / at y^ wages of diverse towns in Flaunders. To thentent to keep the
fronters there about / but ye shall here how the flemmynges were dysconfeted /
and all by their own outrage.

Of the batell of Cassell in Flanders. Cap. xxii.
ANd on a day / they of the garyson of Cassell departed out. To thentent to
have dysconfyted ye king and all his host. And they came privily without any
noise in three batels well ordered. Whereof the first battle took the way to the
kings tents / and it was a fair grace that the king had natben taken / for
he was at souper and all his company / and thought nothing of them. And the
other battle took the straight way to the tents of the king of Behaygne /
and in manner they found him in like case. And the third battle went to the
tents of therle of Heynault / and in likrwyse had nere take him. These hoostes
ca^e so peasably to the tents / that with much pain they of thoost could arm
them. Whereby all the lords and their people had been slain / and the more
grace of god had not ben / but in manner by miracle of god / these lords
dysconfyted all.iii. batayls / each battle by it self all in one hour. In
such wise that of. ^vi. thousand flemmynges there ascaped never a person /
captayns and all were slain. And the king and lords of France knew not one
of an other / nor what they had done till all was finyss / edd and atchyued.
For they lay in three sondrie parties one fro an other but as for the fle^mynges
there was not one left a live / but all lay deed on hepes one upon an other in
the said three sondrie places. And this was done on saint Bartylmewes day / the
year of our lord.M. CCC.xxviii. Than the french men entered into the town of
Cassell and set up the baners of France / and the town yielded the^ to the
king. And also the town Pyepigne / and of Ipre / and all they of the Castlayne
of Bergues / and than the received therle Loys their lord / and swear to him
faith and loyalty forever. Than after the king and his people departed and
went to Paris / and he was much honored and praised for this enterprise and
aid that he had done to his cosyn Lois earl of Flanders. And thus the king was
in great prosperity and every day encresed his ryall estat / for as it was said
there was never king in France that held like estat / as did this king Philyp
of Ualoys.

How the earl of kent and the earl Mortymer in England were put to death. Cap.
xxiii.
THis young king Edward of England was governed a great space as ye have hard
before / by the counsel of the queen his mother / and of Edmonde of Wodstoke
earl of Ke^t his uncle / and by sir Roger Mortymer earl of March. And at ye
last envy began to grow between therle of Kent and therle Mortym^. In so much
yt this earl Mortim^ informed so the young king / by the co^sentyng of tholde
queen Isabell his mother / beryng ye king in hand that therle of Kent would
have enpoysoned him. To thentent to be king himself / as he that was next
heir apparaunt to the crown / for the kings younger brother who was called
John^ a Gaunt was newly deed. And than the king who gave light credence to
them / causedde his uncle the earl of Kent to be taken and openly to be
beheeded without any manner of excuse to be hard, Wherewith many of y^ nobles of
the realm were sore troubled / and bare a gruge in their hertes toward the
earl Mortymer / and according to thenglysshe cronycle. Therle suffered death
at Wynchester / the tenth day of Octobre: y^ third year of the kings raygne
/ and lies buried at the friars in Winchestre. But as mine auctour says:
within a while after as it was reported queen Isabell the kyng^ mother was with
child / and that by therle Mortymer. Whereof ye king was enfourmed: and how the
said Mortym^ had caused him to put to death therle of Kent his uncle / without
good reason or cause: for all the realm reputed him for a noble man. Thanne by
the kings commandment / this earl Mortymer was taken^e and brought to
London. And there before the great lords and nobles of the realm was recyted
by open declaratyon: all ye deeds of the said Mortymer. Than the king
demanded of his counsel what should be done with him / and all the lords by
commen assent gave judgment. And said sir: he has deserved to dye the
sa(...)ethe that sir Hew Spenser dyed. And after this judgment: there was no
delacyon of sufferaunce nor mercy. But inco^tynent he was drawn throughout
London / and than set on a scaffolde and his members cut from him / and cast
into a fire and his heart also: because he had ymagined treason. And thanne
quartered: and his quarters sent to four of the best cities of the realm /
and his heed remained still in London. And within a little space after the king
commanded by thaduyce of his counsel / yt the queen his mother should be kept
close in a castle. And so it was do^e: and she had with her ladies and
damsels / knights and squiers / to serve her acordyng to her estat. And
certain lands assigned to her / to me^tayne there with her noble estat all
days of her life. But in no wise she should not depert out of the castle
without it were tose such sportes as was sometime showed before the castle gate
/ for her recreatyon. Thus this lady led forth her life there mekely / and
ones or twyse a year the king her son / would come and se her. Thenglysshe
cronycle shows diverse other consyderations / why therle Mortym^ suffered death
the which was on saint Andrews even. In the year of our lord a thousand three
hundred.xxix. The which I pass over and follow mine authoure.

Of thomage that king Edward of England / did to the king of France for
the duchye of Guyen. Cap. xxiiii.
ANd after that the king had do^e these two execucyo^s: he took new
counselours of the most noblest and sagest persons of his realm. And so it
was about a year after: yt Phylip of Ualoys was crowned king of France / and
that all the barons and nobles of the realm had made their homage and fealty
to him / except the young king of England / who had not done his homage for the
duchy of Guyen: nor also he was not somoned thereto. Than ye king of France by
thaduise of all his counsel: sent over into England / the lord Auycenis the
lord Beausalt / and two no table clerks masters of the parlyament of Paris:
named master Peter of Orlyaunce / and master Peter of Masieres. These.iiii.
deperted fro Paris / and did somoch by their iourneis yt they ca^e to Wysant /
and there they took see and aryued at Dover. And there tarried a day to abide the
vnshypping of their horses and bagages: and tha^ they rode forth so long that
they ca^e to Wynsore. Where as the king and the young queen of England lay. And
than these four caused to be known to the king the occasyon of their
coming. The king of England for the honor of the french king his cosyn:
caused them to come to his presence / and received them houourably and than
they publysshed their message. And ye king answered them how that the nobles of
his realm / nor his counsel was not as than about him: but desired them to
draw to London / and there they should be answered: in such wise that of reason
they should be content. And so they dyned in the kings chamber and after
departed / and lay the same night at Colbroke / and yt next day at London. It
was not long after: but that the king came to his palace of Westmynster. And
all his counsel was commanded to be there at a certain day lymited / and when
they were all assembled. Than the french ambassadors were sent for: and there
they declared thoccasyon of their coming / and delivered letters fro their
master. Thanne the king went a part with his counsel to take advise what
was best for him to do. Thanne was it aduysed by his counsel / that they
should be answered by thordynaunce and style of his predecessors / by the
bysshopp^ of London. And so the frenchmen were called into the counsel chamber:
than the bishop of London said. Lords that be here assembled for the king of
France / the king is grace my soueraygne lord has hard your words / and
read the tenor of your letters. Syrs we say unto you that we woll counsel
the king our soueraygne lord here present: that he go into France / to se the
king your master his dear cosyn. Who right amyably has sent for him / and as
touching his faith anohomage / he shall do his devour in every thing that he
ought to do of right. And syrs ye may show ye king yor master / that within
short space the king of England our master shall arryue in France: and do all
that reason shall require. Tha^ these messangers were feasted / and the king
rewarded them with many great gifts and iuelles / and they took their leave
and did somoche / that at last they came to Paris / where they found king
Phylyppe / to whom they recounted all their news. Whereof the king was right
ioyouse and specially to se the king of England his cosyn / for he had never
seen him before. And when these tidings were spredde abroad in y^ realm of
France. Than dukes / earls / and other lords aparelled them in their best
manner: and the king of France wrote his letters to king Charles of Behaygne his
cosyn: and to the king of Navarre. Certifyeng them the day and time when the
king of England should be with him / desyringe them to be with him at the same
day / and so they came thither with great array. Than was it counseled the king
of France / that he should receive the king of England at the cite of Amyas /
and there to make prouysion for his coming. There was chambers halles host
ries / and lodgings made ready and apparelled to receive them all and their
company. And also for the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbon / the duke of
Lurren: and sir John^ of Artoyes. There was purueyaunce for a thousand horse /
and for six hundred horse that should come with the king of England. The
young king of England forgate not the voyage that he had to do into France.
And so he aparelled for him and his company well and sufficiently / and there
departed out of England / in his company two bysshoppes / beside the bishop
of London / and four earls. The lord Henry earl of Derby his cosyngermayne /
son to ser Thomas earl of Lancastre with the wrie neck / the earl of Salis
bury therle of Warwyke / and the earl of Hereforde / and. vt. barownes. The
lord Raynolde Cobham / the lord Thomas Wage marshall of England / the lord
Persy / y^ lord Ma^ny / and the lord Mowbray. And mo than.xl. other knights
/ so that the king and his company were about a thousand horse / and y^ king
was two days in passing between Dover and Wysant. Than the king and his
company rod to Bullayne / and there tarried one day. This was about the mids
of August / the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred.xxix. And a none
the tidings came to king Phylip of France / how the king of England was at
Bullayne. Than the king of France sent his constable with great plenty of
knights to the king of England / who as thanne was at Monsternell by the
seesyde / and there was great tokens of love and good chere / made on both
parties. Than^e the king of England rod forth withal his rowt / and in his
company the constable of France. And he rod so long that they came to the
city of Amyas / where as king Phylippe / and the king of Behaygne. The king
of Mayllorgues / and the king of Navarre were ready aparelled to receive the
king of England / with many other dukes / earls / and great barownes. For
there was all the.xii. peers of France / ready to feast and make chere to the
king of England, and to be there peasably to bear witness of the king of
Englandes homage. There was the king of England nobly received. and thus these
kings and other princes tarried at Amyas the space of.xv. days / and in the
mean time there were many words and ordynaunces devised / but as far as I
could know / king Edward of England made his homage to the king of France
all only by word / and not puttyng his hands between the king of France
hands / nor none other prince nor prelate lymitted for him. Nor the king of
England would not proceed any farther in doing any more / concerning his
homage. But rather he was detmyned to return again into England / and there
was read openly the priuyleges of ancient time granted / the which was
declared in what manner the king should do his homage and how and in what wise
he should do service to the king of France. Than the king of France said
cosyn / we woll not disceyue you / this that ye have done pleases us rightwell
/ as for this present time. Till such time as ye be returned again into your
realm / and that ye have seen under the seals of your predecessoures / how
and in what wise ye should do. And so thus the king of England took his
leave and departed fro the king of France right amyably. And of all other
princes that was there / and returned again into England / and labored so
long that he came to Wyndesor. Where his queen received d him right ioyously.
And demanded tidings of king Phylippe her uncle / and of her lineage of
France. The king showed her all that he knew and of the great chere and honor
that he had there / and said in his mind there was no realm could be compared
to ye realm of France. And than within a space after the king of France sent
into England of his special counsel: the bishop of Chartres / and the
bishop of Beannays / the lord Loys of Cleremont / the duke of Burbon /
therle of Harcourt / and therle of Tankermylle: with diverse other knights and
clerks to ye counsel of England / the which was than holden at London for
the parfourmaunce of the king of Englandes homage: as ye have hard before. And
also the king of England and his counsel had well ouersene the manner and
form / how his ancient predecessors had done their homage for the duchy of
Acquitayne. There were many as than in England y^ murmured and said: how the
king their lord was nerer by true succession of heritage to the crown of
France / than Phylippe of Ualoys: who was as than king of France. Now be it
the king and his counsel would not know it / nor speak thereof as at that
time: thus was there great assemble and much a do how this homage should be
parfourmed. These ambassadors tarried still in England all that winter / till
it was the month of May following / or they had answer dyffinatyue: how be it
finally the king of England by the aduyce of his counsel / and on the sight
of his priuyleges where unto they gave great faith: was determined to write
letters in the manner of patentes sealed with his great seal / knowle gyng
therein the homage that he ought to do to the king of France. The tenor and
report of the which letters patentes follows.

We would it be known that as we made homage at Amyas / to ye right excellent

we were not enfourmed of the troth. We made him homage by general words: in

of Guyen in times past had entered into thomage of the king of France for that
time being. And sith that time we have been well enfourmed of the troth.
Therefore we knowledge by these presents: that such homage as we have made in y^

Guyen. etc. These letters the lords of France brought to the king their lord
/ and the king caused them to be kept in his chauncery.

How the lord sir ^ubert of Artoyse was chased out of the realm of France.
Cap. xxv.
THe man in the world that most aided king Philyppe to attain to the Crown of
France. was sir Robert earl of Artoyse. Who was done of the most sagelt / and
great test lords in France / and of high lynage extraughte / fro the blodde
royal and had to his wife suller iermayn to the said king Phylyp / and
always was his chief / and special compaignyon / and lover in all his
astatis. And the space of.iii. year / all that was done in the realm of
France / was done by his aduyce / and without him nothing was done. And after
it fortuned / that this king Philyppe took a meruailouse great his pleasure
and hatred against this noble man sir Robert of Artoyse / for a plee / that was
m^^ed before him / Whereof the Earl of Artoyse was cause / For he would have
won his intent by the virtue of a letter that he laid forth / the which was
not true as it was said. Wherefore the king was in such displeasure / that if
had takyn him in his ire surely it had cost him his life Without remedy.
So this sir Robert was feign to boyde the realm of France / and went to
Namure to the Earl John^ his Nephewe. Than the king took the Earls wife / and
her two sons / who were his own nephews John^e and Charles / and did put
them in prison and were kept straytly / and ye king swear that they should never
come out of prison / as long as they lived The king is mind would not be
turned by no manner of means. Than the king in his furye sent hastily to the
busshopp Laoul of Liege(...) desired him at his instau^ce that he would befye
and make war / against the earl of Namure. without he would put out of his
country (...) Roberte earl of Artoyse. And this busshoppe / Who greatly loved
the king of France / and but little loved his neighbors dyda(...) y^ king
desired him. Than the earl of Namure sore against his will / caused the earl of
Artoyse to avoid his land. Than this earl (...) Robert went to the duke of
Brabant his cosyn / who right ioyously received him and did him great comfort
And as soon as the king of France knew that he sent word to ye duke / that
if he would susteyue maynteyn or sus^re the earl of Artoyse in his country / he
should have no greatter ennemy than he would be to him / and that he would make
war against him / and al his to the best of his power with all the realm of
France. Than the duke sent the earl of Artoyse pryuely to Arge^tuel to then
tent to se what the king would do forther in the case. And anon the king knew it
/ for he had spies / in every corner. The king had great dispyte / that the
duke should so dele with him / and within a brief space after / the king
pourchased so by reason of his gold and silver / that the king of Behaigne /
who was cousin iermayn to y^ duke of Brabant / and the busshop of Liege / the
arche bishop of Coleyn / the duke of Guerles / ye matques of Julyers / the
earl of Bare / ye lord of Los the lord Fawkmount / and diverse other lords
were alied to guyther al against the duke of Brabant / and defied him / and
entered with a great oste in to his country by Esbayng and so (...) to Hanut /
and brent twyse over the country where as it pleased them. And the king of
France sent with them therle of Ewe his Constable / with a great oste of men
of arms. Than the (...) (...)lia^ of Heynaulte sent his wy(...) (...) king and
his brother (...) John^ (...) (...)de Beamont / into France / to t(...) peace
/ and sufferau^ce of war bitwene the king and the duke of Brabant. And at last
the king of France wis^y much warke consented thereto / upon condition that the
duke should put him self utterly to abide the ordinance of the king of
France and of his counsel / in every matter that the king (...) all such as
had befyed him had against him / And also with in a certain day lymitted to
avoid out of his country the earl of Artoyse / and to make short / all this
the duke did sore against his will.

How king Edward of Ingland took the town of Berwyke against the Scottis.
Cap. xxvi.
YE have hard here before recited of the truce bitwene Inglande and Scotland /
for the space of.iii. year / and so the space of ^^ue year / they kept well the
peace / so that in CCC. year before there was not so good peace kept. Now beit
king Edward of Ingland was informed / that the young king David of Scotland /
who had wedded his suster was sea^ed of the town of Berwyke / the whtche ought
to apperteyn to the realm of Ingland. for king Edward the first his
graunfather had it in his possession peasably. Also ye king was e(...) / (...)
the realm of Scotland should hold in chief of the Crown of Inglande / and
how the young king of scottis had not done as tha^ his homage Wherefore the king
of Ingland sent his ambassad to the king of scottis / desyryng him to leave his
handis of the town of Berwyke / for it parteyned to his heritage / for kyngis
of Inglande his predecessors have been in possession thereof And also they
somoned the king of Scottis to come to the king of Ingland to do his homage for
the realm of Scotland. Than the king of Scottis took counsel / how to
answer this matter. And finally the king answerde the Engli^^ he ambassadors /
and said. Syrs both I and all the nobles of my realm marvel greatly of that
ye have required us to do / for we find not auncientely / that the realm of
Scotland should any thing be bound or be subgiet to the realm of Ingland /
another by homage / or any other ways. Nor the king of noble memory our father
would never do homage to the kings of Ingland / for any war that was made
unto him / by any of (...). No more in like wise I am in will to do. And also
king Robert our father conquered the town of Berwyke / by force of arms /
against king Edward father to the king your master that now is. And so my
father held it all the days of his life as his good heritage. And so in like
manner we think to do to the best of our power. How be it lords We require
you to be means to the king your master whose suster we have married / that he
will suffer us peaseably to enjoy our frau^ches and ryghtis / as his
auncetours have done here before. And to let us enjoy that our father has
woune / and kept it peaseably all his life days and desire the king your
master / that he would not believe any evil counsel / given him to y^
contrary. For if there were any other prince that would do us wrong / he should
aid / succor / and defend us / for the love of his suster Whom We have
married. Than these ambassadors answered and said. Sir we have well understand
your answer / we shall show it to the king our lord / in like manner as ye
have said. and so took their leave / and returned into Inglande to the king.
With the which answer the king of Ingland was nothing content. Than he
somoned a parliament to be holden at Westminster. where as all the nobles and wise
men of the realm were assembled to determine what should be best to be done in
this matter. And in this mean time ser Robert earl of of Artoys came into
Inglande / dysguysed like a merchant / and the king rereyued him right
ioyously / and retained him / as one of his counsel. and to him assigned the
Erledom of Rychemount. And when the day of the parliament aproched / and that
all the nobles of the land were assembled about London. Tha^ the king caused
to be showed the message and how he had written to the king of scottis. and of
the answer of the same king. Wherefore the king desired all the nobles of his
realm / yt they would give him such counsel as should aperteyne to the
saving of his honor and right. And when they were all assembled in counsel
they thought yt the king might no longer bear by his honor the iniuryes and
wrongs / that the king of Scotts did him daily / and so they reported their
advise to the king exortyng him to provide for his force and strength of men of
war / to atteyne thereby the town of Berwike And to enter into the realm of
Scotland in such wise / that he should constrayne the king of Scottis to be
joyful / to come and do his homage to him. And so all the nobles and commons
of the realm of Ingland said they would gladly and willyngly go with him in
that journey. And of their good wyls the king thanked them greatly and desired
them to be ready aperailed at a day assigned and to assemble to gyther at New
castle upon Tyne. And than every man went home and p^pared for that journey.
Than the king sent again other ambassadors to the king of scotts his brother
in law / sufficiently to so^mon him / and if he would not be other wise
aduysed / than the king gave them full auctorite to defy him. And so the day
of the assembly of the kings oste aproched / at y^ which day the king of
Ingla^de and all his ost aryued at New castle upon Tyne and there tarried.iii.
days for the residue of his oste that was coming after. And on the fourth day
/ he departed with all his oste toward Scotland / and passed through the lands
of the lord Persy / and of the lord Neuell / Who were two great lords in
Northumberland. and marched on the scottis. And in like wise so did the lord
Rosse / and the lord Ligy / and the lord Mombray. Than the king and all his
oste drew toward the cite of Berwyke. For y^ king of Scotland made no other
answer to these.ii. messengers / but as he did to the first. wherefore he was
openly defied / and somoned. And so the king of Ingland and his oste entered
into Scotland / for he was cou^sailed / that he should not tarry at siege at
Berwike / but to ride forth / and to burn the Country as his graund father
did / and so he did. In which journey he wasted and distroyed all the plain
country of Scotland / and exiled diverse towns that were closed with dykes
and with pales / and took the strong cattle of Enyagburth and set therein a
g(...) passed the secund (...) in Scotland (...) lyn / and ran over all the
country there abowte to Scone / and distroyed the good town of Douf fremlyn
but they did no evil to the abbey / for the king of Ingland commanded that no
hurt should be done thereto / and so the king conquered all the country to
Dondieu and to ^oubreten a strong castle sta^dyng on the marches against the
wild scottis / where as the king of Scotts and the queen his wife were
withdrawn unto for surety. For there were no scottis y^ would appear before
the englisshe men for they were all drawn into the forelf of Ged worth / the
which were inhabitable / and specially for them y^ knew not the country /
wherein all the scottis were and all their gooddis. And so they set but a little
by all the re^uant. And it was no marvel though they were thus driven / for
the king their lord was but.xv. year of age / and the earl of Morrey was but
young / and the nephew of Willyam Duglas that was slain in Spayn was also of
the same age. So as at y^ time / the realm of Scotland was dispurueyed of good
capiteyns. And when the king of Ingland had ronouer all the plain country of
Scotland / and tarried there the space of.vi. months / and saw that none would
come against him. Than he garnysshed diverse castles that he had won / and
thought by them to make war to all the other. Than he withdrew fair and
easily toward Berwike And in his returnyng he wan the castle of Aluest
parteynyng to the heritage of the earl Duglas / it was a.v. leagis fro
Ede^burge / and there in the king set good capitayus / and than rode small
iourneis till he came to Berwike the which is at the enter of Scotland / and
there the king laid round about his siege / and said he would never depart
thens / till he had won it orels the king of Scottis to come / and to reyse
his siege parforee. And within the town there were good men of war set there
by the king of Scottis. Before this cite there were many assaultis and sore
skrymysshes ^ygh every day / for they of the cite would not yield them up
symply / for always they thought to be reseued / how be it there was no
succor appeared. The scotts on morning is and nyghtis made many s^ryes to
trouble the oste / but little hurt they did / for the english oste was so
well kept / that the scottis could not enter / but to their damage / and
often times lost of their men. And when they of Berwike saw that no comfort
nor aid came to them fro any part / and that their vitayles began to fail /
and how they were enclosed both by water and by land. Than they began to fall
in a treat with the king of Ingland / and desired a truee to endure a month.
and if within the month / king David their lord / or some other for him come
not by force to reyse the siege / tha^ they to render up the cite / their lives
and gooddis saved / and that the soudiers within might safly go into their
country without any damage. This treaty was not lightly granted for the king
of Ingland would have had them yielded symply / to have had his pleasure of some
of them / because they had hold so long against him. But finally he was content
by the counsel of his lords. And also ser Robert of Artoys did put thereto
his pain who had been all that iourneye with y^ king / and had showed him
always / home he was uert enheriter to the crown of Fraun^^ he would gladly
that the king should have made war into France / and a left the wars of
Scotland. So his words and others inclined greatly the king to co^discend to
the treaty of Berwike. So this truee and treaty(...)s granted. Than they
within the cite sent word to their king / in what case they stood / but for
all that they could find no remedy to reyse the siege. So the cite was
delivered up at the end of the month / and also the castle / and the Marshals
of the os^ took possession for the king of Ingland / and the burgesses of the
cite came and did their feaute and homage to the king / and swear to hold of
him. Than after the king entered with great solempuite / and tarried there.xii.
days / and made a capitayn there / called sir Edward Bailleul / and when the
king departed he left with the said knight certain young knyghtis and squiers
to help to keep the landis / that he had conquered of the scottis / and the
fronters thereof. Than the king and his people returned to London / and every
man in to their own countres / and the king went to Wyndesore / and ser
Robert of Artoys with him / who never ceased day nor night in showing the king
what right he had to the crown of France / and the king harkened gladly to
his wordis. Thus in this season the king of Ingland wanne the most part of the
realm of Scotland / who had many expert knights about him / among other was
sir Wylliam Mo^tague / and sir walter of Manny. They were hardy knyghtis / and
did many dedis of arms against the scottis. And the better to have their enter
into Scotland / they fortified the basfyde of Rosebourge / and made it a strong
castle / and ser Wylliam Montague did so well in all his entreprises / that the
king made hymerle earl of Sa (...) Surely said therle I cannat deuyse a more
puissant prince to aid him / than the duke of Brabant who is his cosyn
germayne. And also the byss hoppe of Liege / the duke of Guerles / who has his
suster to his wife. The archbysshop of Colayne / the marquis of Jullers / sir
Arnolde de Baquehen / and the lord of Faulquemount. These lords be they that
may make most men of war inshort space of any that I know / they arre good
men of war / they may well make ^X. thousand men of war^ so they have wages
thereafter. They arre people that would gladly win advantage / if it were so
that the king my son your master might get these lords to be on his part.
And so to come into these parties / he might well go over the water of Dysse /
and seek out king Phylippe to fight with him with this answer these
ambassadors returned into England to the king / and reported all that they
had done. Whereof the king had great joy and was well comforted. These tidings
came into France and multiplied little and little / so that king Phylippes
enterprise of ye said croysey began to assuage and ware cold / and he
cou^termau^ded his officers to sease of / making of any farther puision till he
knew more what king Edward would do. Than king Edward ordained.x. banerettes /
and.xl. other knights and sent them over the sea to Ualence^nes. And the
bishop of Lyncolne with them / to thentent to treat with the lords of
thempyre / such as therle of Heynalt had named. When they were come to
Ualencennes each of them kept a great estate and port / and spared nothing /
no more than if the king of England had been there in proper person / whereby
they did get great reuo wine and praise. They had with the^ young bachelars /
who had each of them one of their eyes closed^ with a peace of sylke / it was
said how they had made a vow among the ladies of their country that they would
natse but with one eye till they had done some deeds of arms in France. How
beit they woldnat be known thereof. And when they had been well feested at
Ualence^nes / than the bishop of Lyncolne and part of his company went to
the duke of Brabant who feasted them greatly / and agreed and promised to
susayne ye king of England and all his company in his country. So that he
might go and come armed and unarmed at his pleasure / and to give him the best
counsel he could. And also if the king of England would defy the french
king that he would do the same / and enter into the country of France with
men of war / so that their wages might be borne / to the nombre of a
thousand me^ of arms. Thus than the lords returned again to Ualencennes /
and did somoch by messangers and by promise of gold and silver: that the duke
of Guerles who was the kings brother in law / and ye marquis of Jullers / the
archebysshoppe of Colayne / and Waleran his brother. And the lord of
Faulquemount came to Ualence^nes to speak with these lords of England before
the earl of Haynalt / and the lord John his brother. And by the means of a
great sum of Flore^s that each of them should have for themself and for
their men. They made pmyse to defy yt french king / and to go with the king of
England wha^ it pleased him / with a certain men of war. Promysing also: to
get other lords to take their part for wages / such as be beyond the river
of Ryne: and be able to bring good nombres of men of war. Than the lords of
Almayne took their leave and returned into there own contreis: and
thenglysshmen tarried still with therle of Heynalt / and sent certain
messangers to the bishop of Lyege / and would gladly have had him on their
party. But he would never be against the french king / for he was become his
man and entered into his feaultie. King Charles of Behaygne was not desired: for
they knew well he was so fermely joined with the french king / by reason of
the marriage of John^ duke of Normandy / who had to wife the kings daughter.
Whereby they knew well he would do nothing against y^ french king.

How that Jaques Dartuell governed all Flaunders. Cap. xxix.
IN this season there was great dyscorde between the earl of Flanders and the
fle^mynges: for they would not obey him / nor he durst not a bide in Flaunders:
but in great parell. And in y^ town of Gaunt there was a man a maker of honey /
called Jaques Dartuell. He was entered into such fortune and grace of the people
/ that all thing was done that he did: he might command what he would
through all Flaunders / for there was non though he were never so great yt durst
disobey his commandment. He had always going with him up and down in
Gaunt.lx. or ^ours kore varlettes armed / and among them there were three or
four that knew ye secretues of his mind. So that if he met a person that
he hated or had him in suspectyon incontinent he was slain. For he had
commanded his secret varlettes that when soever he met any person and
made such asygae to them / that inco^tynent they should slay him whatsoever
he were: without any words or resouynge. And by yt means he made many to be
slain / whereby he was so doughted that none durst speak against any thing
that he would have done: so that every man was glad to make him good chere.
And these varletes when they had brought him home to his house / than they
should go to dinner where they list: and after dinner return again into the
street before his lodgyng / and there abide till he come out / (...) wayt on
him till souper time. These souldyours had each of them four grotes flemmysshe
by the day / and were truly paid wekely. Thus he had in every town souldyers
and seruauntess at his wages ready to do his commandment / and to espy if there
were any person that would rebel against his mind / and to enfourme him
thereof. And as soon as he knew any such: he would never cease till they were
banysshed or slain / without respyte. All such great men: as knights /
squires / or burgeses of good towns: as he thought favorable to therle in any
manner / he banysshed them out of Flaunders. And would leuey the moyte of their
lands to his own use / and the other half to their wyuess and children / such
as were banysshed: of whom there were a great no^bre abode atsaynt Diners. To
speak properly: there was never in Flaunders nor in none other country prince /
duke / nor other: that ruled a country so pesably / so long as this Jaques
Dartuell did rule Flaunderss. He leuyed the rentes / wynages / and rightes:
that pertayned to therle through out all Flanderss / and spe^ded all at his
pleasure without any acompt making. And wha^he would say ye he lacked money they
byleued him / and so it behooved them to do for none durst say against him. When
he would borowe any thing of any burgess: there was none durst say him nay.
These englyssh ambassadors kept an honorable estate at the town of
Ualencennes. They thought it should be agreat comfort to the king their lord
if they might get the flymmynges to take their part. Than they took counsel
of therle in that matter and he answered / that truly it should be one of the
grettest aids that they could have. But he said he thought their labor in yt
behalf could not prevail: without they get first the goodwyll of Jaques
Dartuell. Than they said they would assay what they could do: and so thereupon
they departed fro Ualenceunes and went into Flaunders / and departed into three
or four companies. Some went to Bruges / some to Ipre and some to Gau^t. And
they all kept such port and made so large dyspe^ce: that it seemed that silver
and gold fell out of their hands and made many great promyses and offers to
them that they spoke to for that matter. And the bysshopp^ with a certain with
him went to Gaunt / and he did so much / what with fair words and otherwise
that he gate thacorde of Jaques Dartuell. And did get great grace in the
town and specially of an old knight that dwelt in Gauut / who was there right
well beloved: called the lord of Courcisyen a knight baneret / and was reputed
for a hardy knight / and had always served truly his lords. This knight did
much honor to thenglysshemen: as a valyant knight ought to do to all
strangers. Of this he was accused to the french king: who incontinent sent a
strayt commandment to therle of Flaunders / that he should send for this said
knight: and as soon as he had him to strike of his head. Therle who durst not
break the kings co^manndeme^t did somoch that this knight came to him at his
sendyng as he that thought non yuell: and incontyne^t he was taken and his heed
stryken of. Whereof many folks were sorry and were sore dysplesed with therle:
for he was well-beloved with the lords of the country. These english lords
did somoche that Jaques Dartuell diverse times had together the counselles of
the good towns to speak of the besynes that these lords of England desired:
and of the frau^chyses and amyties that they offered them in the king of
Engla^des byhalfe. So often they spoke of this matter that finally they agreed /
that the king of England might come and go into Flaunders at his pleasure.
How beit they said they were so sore bouude to the french king that they might
not enter into the realm of France to make any war / without they should
forfayt a great sum of florens: and so they desired that they would be content
with this answer as at yt time. Thenglysshe lords returned again to
Ualencennes with great joy: often times they sent word to ye king of England
how they spedde and ever he sent them gold and silver to ber^ their charges /
and to give to the lords of Almaygne who desired nothing else. In this season
the noble earl of Heynalt dyed the.vi. day of June / the year of our lord.M.
CCC.xxxvii. and was buried at the friars in Ualencennes. The bishop of
Ca^braysang the mass / there were many dukes / earls / and barownes / for he
was well-beloved / and honored of all people in his life days. After his
dyscease: ye lord Wyllyam his son entered into the counteis of Heynalt /
Hollande / and zelande. Who had to wife the dougther of duke John^ of Braba^t /
and had to name Jahane. She was endowed with the land of Bynche / the which
was a right fair heritage and a profitable. And the lady Jahan her mother went
to Fontnels on Lescault / and there used the resydue of her life in great
devotion in thabbey there / and did many good deeds.

How certain nobles of Flanders kept the isle of Cagaunt against
thenglysshemen. Cap. xxx.
OF all these ordynaunces and confortes that the king of England had get on
that side the sea King Phylipp^ of France was well informed of all the matter /
and would gladly have had the flemmynges on his part. But Jaques Dartuell had
so surmounted all manner of people in Flanders that none durst say against his
opynion / nor ye earl him self durst not well abide in the country. For he
had sent the countess his wife and Loys his son into France for dout of the
fle^mynges. In this season / there were in the isle of Cagant / certain knights
and squyers of Fla^ders in garyson. As sir Dutres de Haluyn / sir John^ de
Radays / and the sons of Lestriefe. They kept that passage against
the^glysshmen and made covert war / whereof thenglysshe lords being in
Heynalt were well informed / and how that if they went that way homewarde into
England / they should be met withal to their dyspleasure. Wherefore they were
not well assured / howbeit they rode and went about ye country at their
pleasure. All was by the confort of Jaques Dartuell / for he supported and
honored them as much as he might. And after these lords went to Doudrech in
Holande / and there they took shypping to eschew the passage of Cagaunt. Where as
the garrison was laid for them by the commandment of the french king / so
these englisshe lords ca^e again into England as privily as they could. And
came to the king who was right ioyouse of their coming / and when he hard of
the garyson of Cagaunt. He said he would provide for them shortly / and anon
after he ordained therie of Derby / ser Water Manny / and diverse other
knights and squiers with five hundred men of arms / and two thousand archers
/ and they took shippyng at London in the river of Tames. The first tide they
went to Grauesende: the next day to Margate / and at the third tide they took
the sea / and sailed into Flanders. So they aparelled them self / and came
nere to Cagaunt.

Of the batell of Cagau^t between thenglysshmen and the frenchmen. Cap. xxxi.
When thenglysshmen saw the town of Cagaunt before the^ / they made the^ ready
and had wynd and tide to serve them. And so in the name of god and saint George
they approached and blewe up their trumpettes and set their archers before them
/ and sailed to ward the town. They of Cagaunt saw well this great shypp^
aproche / they knew well they were englysshmen. And araynged them on the dykes
and on the sands / with their baners before them / and they made.xvi. new
knights. They were a five thousand me^ of war good knights and squiers /
there was sir Guy of Fla^ders a good and a sure knight / but he was a bastard
and he desired all his company to do well their deuoyre. And also there was sir
Dutres de Hauyn / sir John^ de Roodes / sir Gyles de Lestriefe / sir Simon and
sir John^ of Bonquede^t who were there made knights / and Peter of
Anglemonster with many other knights and squiers expert men of arms.
Thenglysshmen were desirous to assail / and the fle^mynges to defend.
Thenglysshe atchers began to shout / and cried their cries / so that such as
kept the passage were feign perforce to recule back. At this first assaute
there were diverse sore hurt / and the englysshmen took land and came and
fought hand to hand. The fle^mynges fought valyantly to defend the passage /
and the^glysshmen assauted chyualrously. The earl of Derby was that day a good
knight: and at the first assaut he was so forward that he was stryken to the
earth / and than the lord of Manny did him great confort / for by pur feat of
arms he releued him up again and brought him out of pyll / and cried
Lancastre for the earl of Derby. Than they approached on every part and many
were hurt: but mo of ye flemmynges than of the englysshmen / for the archers
shot so holly together that they did to the flemmynges much damage. Thus in the
hauyn of Cagant there was a sore batell / for the fle^mynges were good men of
war chosen out by the earl of Flaunders / to defend that passage against
thenglysshemen. And of England there was the earl of Derby son to the earl
Henry of Lancastre with ye wry neck / therle of Suffolk: sir Robert Cobham
sir Jews Byauchampe / sir Wyllyam son to therle of Warwyke: the lord
Bourcher / sir Water Ma^ny / and diverse other. There was a sore battle and
well foughten hand to hand: but finally the fle^mynges were put to the chase
and were slain mo than three thousand / what in y^ hauyn / streets / and
houses. Sir Guy the bastard of Flanders was taken / and sir Dutres de Haluyn
and sir John^ de Rodes were slain / and the two brethren of Bonquedent / and
sir Gyles de Lestrief: and mo than.xxvi. knights and squyers and the town
taken and pylled and all the goods and prisoners put into the ships and the
town brent. And so thus the englysshemen returned into England without any
damage: the king caused sir Guy bastard of Fla^ders to swear and to bind
himself prisoner. And in the same year he became english and did faith and
homage to the king of England.

How king Edward of England made great alyaunces in the empire. Cap. xxxii.
AFter this dysconfeture at Cagaunt: tidings thereof spredde abroad in the
country. And they of Flaunders said: yt without reason and against their
wylles therle of fla^ders had laid there yt garyson. And Jaques Dartuell would
not at had been otherwise and in contynent he sent messangers to king Edward:
recommendyng him to his grace withal his heart. Counsellyng him to come thither
and to pass the sea / certyfyenge him how the flemmynges greatly desired to se
him. Thus the king of England made great purueyances: and when the winter was
passed / he took the sea well acompanyed with dukes / earls / and barownes and
diverse other knights: and aryued at the town of Andewarpe / as tha^
pertayninge to the duke of Brabant. Thither came people from all parts to se
him / and the great estate that he kept. Than he sent to his cosyn the duke of
Brabant / and to the duke of Guerles: to y^ marquis of Jullers / to the lord
John^ of Heynalt and to all such as he trusted to have any conforte of. Saying
how he would gladly speak with them: they came all to Andewarpe between
Whytsontyde / and the feast of saint John^ And when the king had well feasted
the he desired to know their minds whau^e they would b^gynne that they had
promised: requirynge them to dyspatche the matter breuely / for that intent he
said he was come thither / and had all his men ready: and how it should be a
great damage to him to defarre ye matter long. These lords had long counsel
among them / and finally they said. Sir our coming hither as now: was more
to se you than for any thing else: we be not as now purueyed to give you a
full answer. By your license we shall return to our people / and come again
to you at your pleasure: and thau^e give you so plain an answer that the
matter shall not rest in us. Than they took day to come again a three wekes after
the feast of saint John^. The king showed the^ what charges he was at with so
long abiding thynkinge when he came thither that they had been full purueyd to
have made him a plain answer: sayng how that he would not return in to
England till he had a full answer. So thus these lords departed / and the
king tarried in the abbay of saint Bernarde / and some of the english lords
tarried still at Andewarpe: to keep the king company / and some of the other
rode about the country in great dyspence. The duke of Brabant went to Louane
and there tarried a long time / and often times he sent to the french king /
desyring him to have no suspecyous to him and not to believe any yuell
informacion made of him: for by his will he said he would make none alyance nor
covenant against him. Sayrng also that the king of England was his cosyn
germayne / wherefore he might not deny him to come into his country. The day
ca^e that the king of England looked to have an answer of these lords / and
they excused them and said how they were ready and their men. So that the duke
of Brabant would be ready for his part / saying yt he was nere than they. And
that as soon as they might know that he were ready / they would not be behind
but be at the beginning of the matter as soon as he. Than the king did so much
that he spoke again with ye duke and showed him the answer of the other
lords desyring him by amyte and lynage that no faut were found in him /
saying how he parceyued well that he was but cold in the matter / and that
without he were quicker and did otherwise / he douted he should lose thereby the
aid of all the other lords of Amayne / through his defaulte. Than the duke
said he would take counsel in the matter / and when he had long debated the
matter he said how he should be as ready as any other / but first he said he
would speak again with the other lords: and he did send for the^ desyring
them to come to him where as they pleased best. Than yt day was appointed about
the mids of August / and this counsel to be at Hale because of the young earl
of Heynalt who should also be there / and with him sir John^ of Heynalt his
uncle. Whan^e these lords were all come to this parlyament at Hale / they had
long counsel together / finally they said to the king of England. Sir wese
no cause why we should make defyance to the french king all things consydred
/ without ye can get thagrement of the emperor: and that he would command us
to do so in his name. The emperor may well thus do / for of long time past
there was a covenant sworn and sealed that no king of France ought to take
any thing parteyning to the^pyre and this king Philyppe has taken the castle
of Creuecure in Cambreysis / and the castle of Alues in Pailleull: and the
city of Cambray. wherefore the emperor has good cause to defye him by us.
Therefore sir: if ye can get his acord our honor shall be the more / and the king
said he would folo we their counsel. Than it was ordained / that the Marquis
of Jullers should go to the emperor: and certain knights and clerks of the
kings / and some of the counsel of the duke of Gwerles. But the duke of
Brabant would send none fro him / but he lend the castle of Louayne to the
king of England to lie in. And the Marquis and his company found the
emperor at Florebetche / and showed him the cause of their coming. And the
lady Margarete of Heynault did all her pain to further forth the matter /
whom sir Jews of Banyer than emperor had wedded. And there the Marquis of
Jullers was made an earl / and ye duke of Guelders who before was an earl was
than made a duke. And the emperor gave commyssion to four knights and to two
doctors of his counsel / to make king Edward of England his bycarre
general throughout all the empire. And thereof these said lords had
instruments publyke: confyrmed and sealed suffyciently by the emperor.

How king Dauyd of Scotland made alyaunce with king Phylypp^ of France. Ca.
xxxiii.
IN this season the young king Dauyd of Scotland who had lost the best part of
his land / and could natte recover it out of the hold of the^glysshmend /
eparted privily with a small company / and the queen his wife with him and took
shippyng and arrived at Bolayne / and so rod to Pares to king Philyppe who
greatly did feast him. And offered him of his castles to abide in / and of his
goods to dyspende: on the condycion that he should make no peace with the
king of England without his counsel and agreement for king Philyppe knew
well how the king of England apparelled greatly to make him war. So thus
the king / there retained king Dauyd and the queen a long season / and they had
all that they neded at his cost and charge: for out of Scotland came but
little substance to maintain withal their estates. And the french king sent
certain messangers into Scotla^de to the lords there such as kept war against
the^glissh men / offryng them great aid and confort: so y^ they would take no
peace nor tru^e with ye king of England / without it were by his agreement or
by thaccorde of their own king: who had in likewise promised and sworn. Than
the lords of Scotland cou^selled together / and ioyously they accorded to his
request / and so sealed and swear with the king their lord. Thus this alyance
was made between Scotland and France / the which endured a long season after /
and ye french king sent men of war into Scotland to keep war against
thenglysshmen. As ser Arnolde Dandregien who was alter marschall of France /
and the lord of Garencieres: and diverse other knights and squyers. The
french king thought yt the scotts shulue give somoch a do to the realm of
England / yt the^glysshmen should not come over the sea to anoy him.

How king Edward of England was made bycare general of the^pyre of Almaygne.
Cap. xxxiiii.
When the king of England and the other lords to him alyed were departed fro
the parlyament of Hale. The king went to Louan and made ready the castle for
his a byding / and sent for the queen to come thither if it pleased her: for he
sent her word he would not come thens of an hole year. And sent home certain
of his knights to keep his land fro the scotts. And the other lords and
knights that were there still with the king / rode about the realm of
Flanders and Henalt / making great dyspence gyueng great rewards and iuels to
the lords / ladies / and damoselles of the country to get their good wylles.
They did somoche that they were greatly praised and specially of the common
people / because of the port and state that they kept. And than about the feast
of all saints / the marquis of Jullers and his company sent word to the king
how they had sped: And the king sent to him that he should be with him about
the feast of saint Martyne / and also hesent to the duke of Braba^t to know
his mind / where he would the plyament should behold and he answered at Arques
in y^ county of Loz nere to his country. And than the king sent to all other
of his alyes / that they should be there: and so the hall of the town was
apparelled and hanged / as though it had been the kings chamber. And there the
king satte crowned with gold / (...). foot higher than any other: and there
op^nly was read the letters of the emperor / by the which the king was made
bycare general and liefrenaunt for the emperor / and had power given him to
make laws and to mynistre Justyce to every person in thempours name: and to
make money of gold and silver. The emperor also there commanded by his
letters / that all persons of his empire: and all other his subgiettes should
obey to the king of England his vycare as to himself / and to do him homage.
And in contynent there was claim and answer made between parties as before the
emperor / and right and judgment given. Also there was renewed a judgment and
a statute affermed / that had been made before in the emperors court / and
that was this. That who soever would any hurt to other / should make his
defyance thredayes before his deed: and he that did otherwise should be
reputed as an evil doet / and for a by lans deed. And when all this was done
the lords departed / and took day that they should all appear before Cambray
three wekes after ye feast of saint John^ / the which town was become
french: thus they all departed / and every man went to his own. And king
Edward as bycare of thempyre / went than to Louayne to the queen: who was
newely come thither out of England with great nobleness / and well acco^panyed
with ladies and damsels of England. So there the king and the queen kept
their house right honorably all that winter: and caused money / gold / and
silver: to be made at Andewarpe great plenty. yet for all this the duke of
Brabant left not / but with great dyligence sent often messangers to king
Philyppe / as the lord Loys of ^rauehen his chief counselor / with diverse
other ever to excuse him: for ye which cause this knight was often times sent
/ and at the last abode still in the french court with the king: to thentent
always to excuse him against all informacions that might be made of him. The
which knight did all his detroyre in that behalf.

How king Edward and all his alyes did defye the french king. Cap. xxxv.
THus the winter passed and somer came / and ye feast of saint John^ of Baptyst
aproched. And the lords of england and of Almayne apa relled themself to
aco^plyssh their enterprise: and the french king wrought asmoch as he could to
the contrary / for he knew much of their intentes. King Edward made all his
prouisyon in England and all his men of war to be ready to pass ye see
inco^tynent after the feast of saint John^ / and so they did. Than the king
went to Uyllenort / and there made his company to be lodged as many as might in
the town / and the other without a long on the ryuersyde / in tents and
pauylyons. And there he tarried fro Maudelyn tide / till our lady day in
Septembre / abiding wekely for the lords of thempyre. And specially for the
duke of Brabant / on whose coming all the other abode. And when the king of
England saw how they came not / he sent great messangers to each of them:
sommonyng them to come as they had promised / and to mete with him at Machlyn
on saint Gyles day / and than to show him why they had tarried so long. Thus
king Edward lay at Uyllenort / and kept daily at his cost and charge well to
the nombre of.xvi. hundred men of arms / all ^^e fro the other side of the sea:
and.x. M. archers beside all other pro uysious. The which was a matueylous
great charge / beside the great rewards that he had given to the lords / and
beside the great armies that he had on the sea. The french king on his part /
had set Genowayes / normayns / Bretons / Pycardes / and spanyardes to be ready
on the sea: to enter into England as soon as ye war were opened. These lords
of Almayne / at the king of England somons came to Machlyn / and with much
business: finally they acorded that the king of England might well set
forward within.xv. days after: and to thentent that their war should be ye
more laudable. They agreed to send their defyances to the french king first the
king of England / the duke of Guerles the marquis of Jullers / sir Robert
Dartoyse / sir John^ of Heynalt / the marquis of Musse / ye marquis of
Blanquebourc: the lord of Faulquemont / sir Arnold of Baquchen / the archbys
shop of Colayne / sir Galeas his brother: and al other lords of thempyre.
These defyances were written and sealed by all the lords / except the duke of
Braba^t / who said he would do his deed by himself / at time conuenyent. To
bear these defyances into France: was charged the bishop of Lyncolne / who
bare the^ to Paris. And did his message in such manner yt he could not be
reproched nor blamed: and so he had a safe conduct to return again to his
king / who was as than at Machlyne.

How sir water of Manny after the defyances declared / made the first journey
into France. Ca. xxxvi.
IN the first weke that the french king was thus defied: sir water Manny
as soon as he knew it / he gate to him a.xl. speres and rode through Brabant
night and day till he came into Heynalt / and entered into the wode of Blaton.
As than not knowig what he should do: but he had showed to some of them that
were most priuyest about him. How he had promised before ladies and
damoselles or he came out of England / that he would be the first that should
enter into France / and to get other town or castle / and to do some deeds
of arms. And than his intent was to ride to Mortaigne and to get it if he
might: the which partayned than^e to the realm of France. And so rode and
passed the wode of Blaton / and came in a morning before the son risyng to
Mortaygne and by adventure he found the wycket of the gate opynne. Than he
alyghtedde with his company and entered in / and did set certain of his
company to keep the gate. And so went into the high street with his penon
before him / and came to the great tower: but the gate and wycket was fast
closed. And when ye watch of the castle hard the brunt / and saw them he
blewe his horn and cried treason treason. Than every man a woke and made them
ready / and kept them self still within the castle: than sir water of Manny
went back again and did set fire in the street ioyninge to the castle / so
that there were a threscore houses brent / and ye people sore a frayed: for
they wend all to have been taken. Than sir water and his company rode back /
straight to Conde: and there passed the river of Hayne. Than they rode the way
to Ualencennes / and coosted on the right hand and came to Deuayne and so went
to the abbay: and so passed forth toward Bouhaigne. And did somoche that the
captain did let them pass thorough by the river. Than they came to astrong
castle parteyning to the bysshopp^ of Cambray called the castle of Thine / ye
which suddenly they took / and the captain and his wife win. And the lord
Manny made a good garyson: and set therm a brother of his called sir Gyles
Ma^ny / who afterward did much trouble to the city of Ca^bray: for the
castle was within a leage of the town. Than sir Water Manny returned into
Brabant / to the king his soueraygne lord: whom he found at Machlyne / and
there showed him all that he had done.

How that after the say^ defyances made / the frenchmen entered in to England.
Cap. xxxvii.
AS soon as king Phylyppe knew that he was vefyed of the king of England and
of his alyes: he retained men of war on every side. And sent the lord Galoys
de ^a Bausyne a good knight of Sauoy into the cite of Cambray / and made him
captain there: and with him sir Thybalt de Marneyle / and the lord of Roy. So
that they were / what of Sauoy and of France a.ii. hundred speres. And king
Philyppe sent and seized into his hands the county of Pontyeu / the which the
king of England had before by reason of his mother. And also he sent to diverse
lords of thempyre: as to therle of Heynalt his neue we / to the duke of
Lorrayne / therle of Bar the bishop of Metz / the bishop of Liege: desy ryng
them that they would make no yuell purchase against him or his realm. The
most part of these lords answered / how they would do nothing that should be
against him / and the earl of Heynalt wrote unto him right courtessy how that
he would be ready always to aid him and his realm against all men. But seeing
the king of England makes his war / as bycare and lyeutenaunt of thempyre.
Wherefore he said he might not refuse to him his country nor his confort:
because he held part of his country of thempour and as soon as sir Her^e
Nuyriell / sir Peter Bahuchet / and Barbe Noyre: who lay and kept the
streightes between England and France with a great navy / knew ye the war
was opyn. They came on a sunday in the fore noone to the hauyu of Hampton /
while the people were at mass: and the Normayns / Pycardes / and spanyerdes
entered into the town / and robbed and pylled the town / and slew diverse and
defowled maidens / and enforced wives: and charged their vessels with ye
pyllage. And so entered again into their ships / and when the tide came they
dysancred and sailed to Normandy and came to Deep. And there departed and
divided their boty and pyllages.

How king Edward besieged the cite of Cambray. Cap. xxxviii.
THe king of England departed fro Machelyne and went to Brussels / and all his
people past on by ye town. Than came to the king a.xx. M. Almaynes / and the
king sent and demanded of the duke of Braba^t what was his entensy on to go
to Cambray / or else to leave it. The duke answered and said: that as soon as
he knew that he had besieged Ca^bray / he would come thither with.xii. hundred
speres of good men of war. Than the king went to Nyuell and there lay one
night / and the next day to Mons in Heynalt. And there he found the young earl
of Heynalt / who received him ioyously / and ever sir Robert of Dartoyse was
about the king as one of his prive counsel / and a.xvi. or.xx. other great
lords and knights of England the which were ever about the king for his
honor and estate / and to counsel him in all his deeds. Also with him was ye
bishop of Lyncolne / who was greatly renomed in this journey / both in wisdom
and i^ prowes. Thus thenglysshmen passed forth and lodged abroad in the
country / and found prouysion enough before them for their money / howbeit
some ^ayed truly and some not. And when the king had tarried two days at Mons
in Heynalt: than^e he went to Ualencennes and he and.xii. with him entered into
the town / and no mo persons. And thither was come therle of Heynalt and ser
John^ his uncle / and the lord of Faguyuelles / ye lord of Uerchyn / the
lord of Haureth: and diverse other / who were about therle their lord. And ye
king and therle went hand in hand to ye great hall which was ready aparelled to
receive them. And as they went up the steares of the hall / the bishop of
Lyncolne / who was there present spoke out a loud and said: Wyllyam bysshopp^
of Cambray / I admonysshe you as procurer to the king of England vycare of
the^pyre of Ro^e / that ye opyn the gates of the cite of Cambray / and if ye do
not ye shall forfayt your lands: and we woll enter byforce. There was none that
answered to that matter: for the bishop was not there present. Than the bishop
of Lyncolne said again: earl of Heynault we admonysshe you in the name of
thempour / that ye come and serve ye king of England his vycare: before the
cite of Cambray with such nombre as ye ought to do. Therle who was there
present: said with a right good will I am ready. So thus they entered into the
hall / and therle led ye king into his chamber and anon the supper was ready.
And ye next day the king deperted and went to Aspre and there tarried.ii. days /
and suffered all his men to pass forth And so than went to Ca^bray and loged at
Wys and besieged the cite of Cambray round about and daily his power
increased. Thither came the young earl of Heynalt in great atray / and sir John
his uncle / and they lodged nere to ye king and the duke of Guerles and his
company / the marquis of Musse / therle of Mons / the earl of Sauynes: the
lord of Falquemo^t / sir Arnolde of Bouquehen: withal the other lords of
thempyre / such as were alyed with the king of England. And the sixth day
after the siege laid / thither ca^e the duke of Brabant with a.ix. hundred
speres beside other / and he lodged toward Ostrenan on the river of Lescaut /
and made a bridge over the water / to thentent to go fro ye one host to the
other. And as soon as he was come / he sent to defye the french king: who was
at Compyengne. Whereof Loys of Traneheu who had always before excused / the
duke was so confused that he would no more return again into Brabant / but
dyed for sorrow in France. This sege during / there were many skirmysshes: and
sir John of Heynalt and the lord of Falquemont rod ever lightly together / and
brent and wasted sore the country of Cambresys. And on a day these lords with
the nombre of.v. C. speres / and a M. of other men of war / came to the
castle of Doisy in Cambresys / pertaining to the lord of Coucy / and made there
a great assaut. But they within did defend them so valyantly / that they had
no damage / and so the said lords returned to their lodgings. Therle of
Heynalt and his company on a saturday came to the gate toward saint Quyntines
/ and made there a great assaut there was John^ Chandos: who was tha^ but a squier
/ of whose prowes this book speaks much / he cast himself between the barrers
and the gate and fought valyantly with a squire of Uermandoys called Johanne of
saint Dager / there was goodly feats of arms done between them. And so the
heynows conquered by force the baylles: and there was entered therle of Heynalt
and his marshals / sir Gararde of Uerchyne / ser Henry Dantoyng and other: who
adventured them valyantly to advance their honor and at an other gate called
ye gate Robert / was y^ lord Beamonde / and the lord of Falquemont / the lord
Danghyen / sir Wyllyam of Manny / and their companys / made there asore and a
hard assaut. But they of Cambray / and y^ soudyers set there by the french
king / defended themself and the cite so valyantly / that thassauters wan
nothing: but so returned right weary and well beaten to their logynges. The
young earl of Namure ca^e thither to serve ye young earl of Heynalt by desire /
and he said he would be on their part as long as they were in the^pyre. But
as soon as they entered into the realm of France / he said he would forsake
them and go and serve the french king / who had retained him. And in likewise
so was thentent of therle of Heynalt / for he had commanded all his men on
pain of death / that none of them should do any thing within the realm of
France. In this season while ye king of England lay at siege before Cambray
with.xl. M. men of arms / and greatly constrained the^ by assautes. King
Philyp made his somons at Peron in Uarma^doys / and the king of England
counseled with sir Robert Dartoys in whom he had great affyance / demau^dyng
of him whyther it were better for him to enter into ye realm of France / and
to encounter his adversary: or else to abide still before Ca^bray till he had
won it biforce. The lords of England and such other of his counsel / saw
well how the cite was strong and well furnysshed of men a war and vytels and
artylary / and that it should be long to abide there till they had won the
city. Whereof they were in no certe^tie / and also they saw well how that
winter aproched nere and as yet had done no manner of entprise / but lay at great
erpe^ce. Than they counseled the king to set forward into y^ realm / where
as they might find more plenty of forage. This counsel was taken and all the
lords ordained to dyslodge / and trussed tents and pauylions and all manner of
harnes / and so departed and rode toward mnu^t saint Martyn the which was at
thentre of France. Thus they rode in good oroce / every lord among his own
men: marshals of thenglysshe host were therle of Northa^pton and Glocetter and
therle of Suffolk: and constable of England was therle of Warwyke / and so
they passed there the river of Lescault / at their ease. And when therle of
Heynalt had aco^panyed the king unto the deptyng out of the^pyre / and that he
should pass the river and enter into the realm of France. Than he took leave
of the king / and said how he would ride no farther with him at that time /
for king Philypp^ his uncle had sent for him / and he would not have his yuell
will but that he would go and serve him in France / as he had served y^ king of
England in thempyre. So thus therle of Henalt and therle of Namure and their
co^panyes rode back to Quesnoy. And therle of Heynalt gave the most part of
his company leave to be part / desyringe them to be ready when he send for them
/ for he said that shortly after he would go to king Philyppe his uncle.

How king Edward made sir Henry of Flaunders knight. Cap. xxxix.
As Soon as king Edward had passed the river of Lescaute / and was entered into
ye realm of France / he called to him sir Henry of Fla^ders who was as tha^ a
young squier / and there he made him knight. And gave him yearly. CC. (...).
sterlyng sufficiently assigned him in England. Than ye king went and lodged in
thabbey of mount saint Martyn / and there tarried two days and his people abroad
in the country / and the duke of Braba^t was lodged in thabbey of Uancellez.
When the french king being at Co^piengne hard these tidings / than he
informed his somones and sent ye earl of Ewe and of Gynes his constable / to
saint Quyntines to keep the town and fro^ters there against his ennemies / and
sent ye lord of Coucy into his own country / and the lord of Hen i to his:
and sent many men of arms to Guyse and to Rybemont to Behayne / and the
fortresses ioynyng to thentre of the realm. And so went himself to wards
Peron / in ye mean season yt king Edward lay at thabbey of mount saint Martyn
his men ran abroad in the country to Bapau^me and nere to Peron and to saint
Quyntines / they found the country pie^tyfull / for there had been no war of a
long season / and so it fortuned that ser Henry of Flauders to auance his body
/ and to eucrease his honor on a day with other knyghts. Whereof sir John^ of
Heynalt was chief: and with him the lord of Faulquemo^t / the lord of Bergues
the lord of Uaudresen / the lord of Lens and diverse other to the no^bre of.v.
C. And they auysed a town thereby called Ho^necourt / where in much people were
gadered on trust of ye fortresses. And therein they had conveyed all their
goods and there had been ser Arnolde of Baquehen and sir Wyllm^ of Dunor and
their company: but they at tayned nothing there. There was at this Ho^nycourt /
an abbot of great wisdom and hardynes / and he caused to be made without the
town a barrers overthwart the street like a grate / not past half a foot wide
every grate. And he made great puisyons of stones and quick lyme / and men
ready to defend the place. And these lords when they came thither they lighted
a foot / and entered to the barrers with their gleuys in their hands / and there
began a sore assaut: and they within valya^tly defended themself. There was
thabbot himself who received and gave many great strokes / there was a ferse
assaut: they win cast down stones / pieces of tymbre / potts full of chalk /
and did much hurt to thassaylers. and ser Henry of Fla^ders who held his
glayue in his hands and gave there with great strokes / at the last thabbot
took the gleue in his hands and drew it so to him / y^ at last he set hands
on ser Henres arm: and drew it so sore that he pulled out his arm at the
barrers to the shulder / and heldehym at a great advantage: for and y^ barrers
had been wyd enough he had drawn him through: but ser Henry would not let his
wepen go for saving of his honor. Than the other knyghts struck at thabbot to
rescue their fellow so this wrastlyng endured a long space: but finally the
knight was rescued / but his gleaue abode with thabbot. And on a day when I
wrote this book as I past by / I was showed the gleue by the monks there / yt
kept it for a treasur. So this said day: Ho^nycourt was sore assaylled ye which
endured till it was night / and diverse were slain and sore hurt. Sir Joha^n of
Heynault lost there a kynght of Hollande / called sir Herment. When the
flemynges / heynowes / englyssh men / and almaygnes: same the fierce wylles of
them within / and saw how they could get nothing there: withdrewe them
self against night. And ye next day on the morning y^ king depted fro mount
saint Martyn / co^mau^dynge that no person should do any hurt to the abbey /
the which commandment was kept. And so than they entered into Hermandoys and
took y^ day their lodgyng be times on y^ mount saint ^ui tyne in good order of
battle. And they of saint ^uyntines might well se them / how be it they had no
desire to issue out of their town. The fore ryders came rynnynge to the
barrers skyrmysshyng / and the host tarried still on y^ mount iyll the next
day. Than the lords took counsel what way they should draw / and by thaduyce
of the duke of Brabant they took y^ way to Thyerasse / for that way their
prouisyon came daily to the^. And were determined that if king ^hy lyppe did
follow the^ as they supposed he would do / that than they would abide him in y^
plain field / and give him battle. Thus they went forth in three great
batayls: the marshalles and the Almaygnes had the first / the king of England
in the myddle ward / and the duke of Brabant in the rerewarde. Thus they rod
forth brennynge and pyllynge the country a three or four leages a day / and
ever took their logynge be times. And a company of englysshmen and Almaygnes
passed the river of Sum by the abbey of ^ermans / and wasted the country al
about. An other company whereof sit Joha^n of Heynalt / the lord Faulquemo^t
and sir Arnold of Barquehen were chief / rode to Drigny saint Benoyste a good
town. But it was but easily closed / incontinent it was taken by assaut and
robbed / and an abbey of ladies vyolated / and the town brent. Than they
departed and rode toward Guys and Rybemont / and the king of England lodged
at ^ehories / and there tarried a day / and his men ran abroad and dystroyed
the country. Than the king took the way to the Flammengerie to come to Lesche
in Thyerasse / and the marshals and the bysshopp^ of Lpncolne with a five
hunderd speres passed the river of Trysague and entered into Laonnoys / toward
the land of the lord of Cou^y / and bret saint Gouuen and the town of Matle.
And on a night lodgedde in the valey beside Laon / and the nerte day they drew
again to their host: for they knew by some of their prisoners / that the
french king was come to saint ^uyntines with a. C. thousand men / and there to
pass the river of Sum. So these lords in their retournynge brent a good
town called Crecy: and diverse other towns and hamelettes there about. Now let
us speak of ser John^ of Heynalt and his company / who were a five hundred
speres he came to Guys and brent all the town and beat down the mylles. And
with in the fortresses was the lady Jane his own daughter wife to therle of
Bloys called Jews / she desired her father to spare therytage of the earl his
son in law. But for all that sit John^ of Henalt would not spare his
enterprise: and so than he returned again to the king / who was lodged in
thabbey of Sarnaques / and ever his people r(...) over the country. And the
lord of Falquemont with a. C. speres came to Lonnion in Thyerasse a great
town / and the men of the town were fled into a great wood / and had all
their goods with them. And had fortifyed the wood with fellyng of tymbre about
the^ / the Almayns rode thither and there met with them. Sir arnolde of
Baquehen and his company / and so there they assailed them in the wood / who
defe^dyd the^ as well as they might: but finally they were conquered and put to
flight. And there were slain and sore hurt mo than.xl. and lost all that they
had: thus the country was over ryden / for they did what they list.

How the king of England / and the french king took day of journey to fight
together. Cap. x^.
THe king of England depted fro Sarnaques and went to Muttrell. And there loged
a night / and the next day he went to the Flame^gery / and made all his me^ to
loge nere about him. Whereof he had mo than.xl. thousand / and there he was
cou^selled to avyde king (...)lyp / and to fight with him The french king depted
fro saint Duyntines / and daily men came to him fro all parts / and so ca^e to
Uyro^fosse. There the king tarried and said how he would not go thens till he
had fought with the king of England and with his alyes / seeing they were within
two leages toguyther. And wha^ therle of Heynalt who was at Du^lnoy ready
purueyed of men a war / knew that y^ french king was at Uyronfosse /
thynkyng there to give battle to thenglysshmen. He rode forth till he ca^e to
the french host with.v. C. speres. and presented himself to the king his uncle
/ who made him but small cher / vycause he had ven with his adversary before
Cambray. How ve it the earl excused himself so sagely / that the king and
his counsel were well content. And it was ordained by the marshals / that is
to say by the marshall Bertrame / and by y^ marshall of Try that the earl
should be lodged next the english host. Thus these two kings were lodged
between ^yro^fosse and Flame^gery / in the plain feldes without any
advantage. I think there was never seen before so goodly an assemble of noble
men together / as was there. When the king of England being in the chapel of
Thyerasse / knew how that king Ph^^ypp^ was with in two leages / than he called
the lords of his host together / and demanded of them what he should ^o: his
honor saved / for he said that his enten cyon was to give battle. Than the
lords beheld each other / and they desyr^dde the duke of Braba^t to show
first his intent. The duke said that he was of the accord that they should
give battle / for otherwise he said they could not depart / saving their
honors. Wherefore he counsayled y^ they should send harauloes to the french
king / to demand a day of battle. Than an haraulde of the duke of Guerles /
who could well the langage offrenche was informed what he should say: and so
herod till he came into y^ french host. And than he drew him to king
Philyppe and to his counsel: and said ser the king of England is in the
field / and desires to have batell / power against power. The which thing
king Philyppe granted / and took the day / the friday nextafter: and as tha^
it was weduisday. And so the haraude re^ourned well rewarded with good ^urred
gowns given him by the french king and other lords / because of the tidings
that he brought. So thus the journey was agreed / and knowledge was made
thereof: to all the lords of both the hoostes / and so every man made him ready
to the matter. The thursday in the morning there were two knights of ther^e of
Heynaultes / the lord Sanguinelles / and the lord of Tupeney. They mounted on
their horses / and they two all only depted fro the french host / and rode
to a view y^ englyssh host. So they ro^e co^^yng the host and it fortuned
that the lord of Sanguynelles horse took the bridell in the tethe in such
wise: that his ma^^ter coud not rule him. And so why there he would or not / the
horse brought him into thenglysshe host: and there he fell in the hands of
the (...)maynes / who perceived well that he was none of their company: and set
on him and took him and his horse. And so he was prisoner to a five orsixe
gentylmen of (...)main: and a none they set him to his ransom. And when they
understood that he was a ^aynome / the^ demanded of him if he knew ser Joh^
of Hepnalt / and he answered yes: and desired them for the love of god to bring
him to his presens / for he knew well that he would quyte him his rau^some.
Thereof were the Almaygns joyous / and so brought him to the lord Beaumounde /
who incontinent did pledge him out fro his masters hands. And the lord of
Sanguynelles returned again to therle of Heyualt / and he had his horse
again delivered him at the request of the lord Beamond. Thus passed that day
/ and ^one other thing done that ought to be remembered.

how these kings ordained their batayls at ^yronfosse. Cap. x^^.
When the friday came in the morning / both hoostes aparelled the^ self ready /
and every lord hard mass among their own co^pa^yes / and diverse were
shr^uen. First we woll speak of thorder of thenglysshmen who drew the^
forward into the feld^ and made. iii* batels a foot / and did put all their
horses and bagages into a little wood behind them / and for tefyed it. The
first batell led the duke of Guerles / the marquis of Nusse / the marquis of
Blaquebour^: sir John^ of Heynalt / therle of ^o^s / therle of Sauynes / the
lord of Faulquemont / sit Guyllam du Fort / sir Arnolde of Baquche^ and the
almayns: and among them* was* xxii* banners / and.lx. penons in the hale /
and.viii. M^men. The second battle had the duke of Brabant / and the lords
and knights of his country. First the lord of ^u^se / the lord Bergues /
the lord of Bredangh / the lord of (...) the lord of ^aucelare / the lord
of Borguynall the lord of Sto^neuort / the lord of wyten / the lord of Elka
/ the lord of Cassebegne / y^ lord of Duffle: ser Thyrre of ^alcourt / ser
Rasse of the Grez / ser John^ of Cassebegne / ser John^ Filyfe / ser Gyles of
Coterebe / ser water of ^otebergue / the three brethren of Harlebecque / ser
Henry of Flaiu^ders: and diverse other barownes and knights of flanders who
were all under y^ duke of (...) baner: as y^ lord of Hallayne / y^ lord of
(...) sir Hector ^yllains / sit John^ of Rodes / ser (...) start of Gupstell /
ser wyllin^ of Strat^ / ser (...) de la mule: and many other. The duke of
Braba^t had a.xxiiii. baners / and.lxxx. penons / and in all a vii. M. men.
The.iii. bataile and the grettest ha^ the king of England / and with him his
cosyn therle of Derby: the bysshopp^ of Lyncolne / the bysshopp^ of Durame /
therle of Salysbury / the earl of Northamton and of Glocetter: therle of
Suffolk / sir Robert Dartoyse as than called earl of Rychmont: the lord
Raynolde Cobhm^ / the lord Persy / the lord Roose / the lord Montbray: sir
Jews and sir John^ Beauchampe / ye lord Dalawarr / the lord of Laucome / ye
lord Basset the lord fitz water / sir Water Manny sir New Hastyngs / sir
John^ Lyle: and diverse other that I can not name / among other was ser John^
Chandos / of whom much honor is spoken in this book. The king had with
him.xxviii. baners / and.lxxxx. penons / and in his battle a vi. M. men of
arms and.vi. M. archers. And he had set an other batell as in a wyng: whereof
therle of Warwyke / therle of Penbroke / ye lord Barkley / the lord Multon:
and diverse other were as cheyfe / and they were on horsbacke. Thus whan^e every
lord was under his banner / as it was commanded by the marshals: the king of
England mounted on a palfray / aco^panyed all only with sir Robert Dartoyse /
sir Raynolde Cobham / and ser Water of Manny: and rode a long before all his
batels / and right swetely desired all his lords and other. That they would
that day aid to defend his honor / and they all promised him so to do. Than
he returned to his own batell and set every thing in good order / and
commanded that non should go before ye marshals baneres. Now let us speak of
the lords of France what they did. They were.xi. score baners.iiii.
kings.vi. dukes.xxvi. earls / and mo than.iiii. M. knights: and of the
commons of France mo than.lx. M. The kings that were there with king Philyppe
of Ualoys / was the king of Behayne / the king of Nauerr / and king Dauyd of
Scotland: the duke of Normandy / the duke of Bretayne / the duke of Burbon /
the duke of Lorrayne / and the duke of Athenes. Of earls: therle of Alanson
brother to the king / the earl of Flaunders / therle of Heynalt / the earl of
Bloys / therle of Bare / therle of Forestes / therle of Foyz / therle of
Armynacke / the earl Dophyn of Auuergne / therle of Lo^guyle / therle of
Sta^pes / therle of Uandosme / therle of Harrecourt / therle of saint Pol /
therle of Guynes / therle of Bowlougne / therle of Roussy / therle of
Dampmartyn / therle of Ualentynois / therle of Aucer therle of Sancerre /
therle of Genue / the earl of Dreux and of Gascongne / and of Languedoc. So
many earls and vycuntes that it were long to rehearse: it was a great beauty to
behold the baners and standerdes wauyng in the wind / and horses barded: and
knights and squyers richely armed. The frechemen ordained three great batayls /
in each of them fyftene thousand men of arms. and.xx. M. men a foot.

How these two kings departed fro Uironfosse / without battle. Cap. xlii.
IT might well be marueyledde: how so goodly a sight of men of war so nere
together should depart without battle. But the french men were not all of one
acorde / they were of diverse opynyons. Some said it were a great shame and
they fought not seeing their ennemys so nere the^ in their own country /
raynged in the field. and also had promised to fight with the^: and some other
said it should be a great folly to fight / for it was hard to know every
man's mind / and ieoperdy of treason. For they said if fortune were contrary
to their king as to lose the selde / he than should put all his hole realm in a
ieopardy to be lost. And though he did dysconfet his ennemes yet for all that
he should be never the nerer of the realm of England: nor of such lands
parteynyng to any of those lords that be with him alyed. Thus in striuyng of
diverse opynions / ye day past till it was past noone: and than suddenly there
started an Hare among the frenchmen / and such as saw her cried and made great
bru^t whereby such as were behind thought they before had been fighting. And
so put on their helmes / and took their speres in their hands / and so there
were made diverse new knights / and specially therle of Heynalt made.xiiii.
who were ever after called knyghts of the hare. Thus that batell stood still all
that friday / and beside this strife between the counselors of France / there
was brought in letters to the host of reco^mendacion to the french king and
to his counsel. Fro king Robert of Cicyle / the which king as it was said was
a great astronomyer: and full of great science. He had often times sought his
books on thestate of the kings of England and of france: and he found by his
astrology / and by the^fluens of ye heue^s / yt if the french king ever fought
with king Edward of england / he should be disco^fited. wherefore he like a king
of great wysdo^e and as he that douted the peril of the french king his cosyn
sent often times letters to king Philyppe and to his counsel: that in no wise
he should make any battle against thenglyss men / where as king Edward was
personally present. So that what for dout and for such writing fro the king of
Cecyle diverse of the great lords of France were sore a basshed: and also
king Philyppe was enfourmed thereof. He we beit yet he had great will to give
battle: but he was so counseled to the contrary / that the day passed without
batell and every man withdrue to their lodgings. And when the earl of Heynalt
same that they should not fight he departed withal his hole company / and went
back the same night to Quesnoy. And the king of England / the duke of
Brabant: and all the other lords returned and trussed all their bagagis / and
went the same night to Dauesnes in Heynalt. And the next day they took leave
each of other: and the Almayns / and brabances departed / and the king went
into Brabant with the duke his cosyn. The same friday that the batell should
have been the french king when he came to his lodgyng he was sore dyspleased /
because he departed without battle. But they of his counsel: said how right
nobly he had borne himself / for he had halyantly pursued his ennemies / and
had done somoche that he had put the^ out of his realm: and how that the king
of England should make many such vyages or he conquered the realm of France.
The next day king Philypp^ gave lyce^ce to all manner of men to dept / and he
thanked right courtesly the great lords of their aid and socour. Thus ended
this great journey and every man went to their own The french king went to
saint Omers / and sent men of war to his garysons: and specially to Tourney /
to Lysse / and to Doway: and to the other towns marchyng on the^pyre. He sent
to Tourney: sir Godmart Dufay / and made him captain there / and regent of
that country there about. And he sent sir Edward of Beaugewe to Mortayne: and
when he had ordered pert of his besynes / than he drew toward Paris.

How king Edward took on him to bear the arms of France / and the name to be
called king thereof. Ca. xliii.
When that king Edwards was departed fro the flamengery and came into Braba^t
/ and went straight to Brussels. The duke of Guerles / the duke of Jullers /
the marquis of Blanqueboure / the earl of Mons / sir John^ of Haynalt / the
lord of Faulquemo^t / and all the lords of thempyre such as had been at that
iournay: brought him thither to take aduyce and counsel what should be done
more in the matter that they had be gone. And to have expedycion in the cause:
they ordained a parlyame^t to beholden at ye town of Brussels / and thither to
come was desired Jaques Dartuell of Gau^t who came thither with a great company
/ and all the counsels of the good towns of Flaunders. There the king of England
was sore desired of all his alyes of thempyre / that he should require the^ of
Flanders to aid and to mentayne his war and to defy the french king: and to
go with him where as he would have them. And in their so doing: he to promise
the^ to recover the Isle Doway / and Bethayne. This request was well hard of
the slemynges / and thereupon they desired to take counsel among themself: and
so they took counsel at good leaser / and than they said to the king. Sir or
this time ye have made to us request in this behalf: sir if we might well do
this saving your honor / and to save ourselfe / we would gladly do this. But
sir we be bound by faith and oath: and on the sum of two my: lions of
floreyns in the Popes chaumbre / that we may make nor move no war against the
king of France. Who soever it be: on pain to lose the said sum / and
beside that to ryn in the sentence of cursyng. But sir if ye will take on you
the arms of France / and quarter them with the arms of England and call
yourselfe king of France / as ye ought to be of right. Than we woll take you
for rightful king of France / and de mau^de of you quyta^ce of out bonds:
and so ye to give us perdon thereof as king of France. By this means we shall be
assured and dyspe^sed with all / and so tha^ we will go with you whyder soever ye
will have us. Than the king took counsel for he thought it was a sore mat to
take on him ye arms of France and the name / and as tha^ had conquered nothing
thereof / nor coud not tell what should fall thereof / nor whyder he should
co^quere it or not: and on the other side loath he was to refuse the confort and
aid of the stemynges / who might do him more aid tha^ any other. So ye king
took counsel of the lords of the^pyre / and of the lord Robert Dartoyse / and
with other of his special friends / so that finally the good and the yuell
wayed. He answered to the flemmynges / that if they would swear and seal to
this accord / and to promise to mentayne his war: how he would do all this
with a good will / and promised to get them again Lyle / Do way / and
Bethayn: and all they answered how they were content. Than there was a day
assigned to mete at Gaunt / at which day the king was there / and the most
part of the said lords and all the counsayls generally in Flanders. And so
than: all this said matters were rehearsed / sworn / and sealed: and the king
quartred the arms of France with England / And from thens forth took on him
the name of the king of France / and so continued till he left it again by
composicyo^ / as ye shall here after in this book. And so at this counsel
they determined that the next somer after / they would make great war into
France: promysing to besiege the city of Tourney. Whereof the flemmynges were
joyful / for they thought to be strong enough to get it / and that ones gotten
/ they be leued shortly after to win again Lysse / Do way / and Bethayne:
with thappurtenau^ces (...)tayning or holden of therle of Flanders. Thus every
man departed and went home: the king of England went to And warpe / and the
queen abode still at Gaunt / and was often times vysited by Jaques Dartuell:
and by other lords ladies / and damsels of Gaunt. The king left in Flaunders
/ therle of Salysbury / and therle of Suffolk. They went to Ipre and there kept
a great garyson / and made sore war against them of Lysse / and there about.
And when the kings ships were ready he took the sea / and so sailed into
England / and came to London about the feast of saint Andrewe / where he was
honorably received. And there he had co^playn tes made him of the dystruction
of Hampton / and he said that he trusted / or a year longer that it should be
well revenged.

How the frenchmen brent in the lands of sir John^ of Heynault. Cap. xliiii.
Now let us speak of king Philyppe / who greatly fortifyed his navy that he
had on the sea. Whereof sir Kiry Bahuchet and Barbe Noyre were captayns. And
they had under them a great retynu^ of Genowayes / normayns / bretons / and
pycardes: they did that winter great damage to the realm of England: sometime
they came to Dover / sandwyche / Wynchelse / Hastynges / and Rye: and did much
sorrow to thenglysshe men / for they were a great nombre as a.xl. M. men. There
was none that could issue out of en glande: but they were robbed / taken / or
slain / so they wan great pyllage / and specially they wan a great ship
called the Christofer / laden with wolles as she was going into Flaunders. The
which ship had coost the king of England much money / and all they that
were taken with in the ship were slain and drowned. Of the which conquest
the frenchmen were right ioyeouse. The french king than sent and wrote to the
lord of Beamont / y^ lord of Breme / to the Uidame of Chalon / the lord
John^ de la Boue the lord John^ and Gararde of Loyre / that they should make
an army and to ride into the land of sir John^ of Heynalt / and to burn and
dystroy there asmoche as they might. They obeyed and gathered together to the
nombre of.v. C. speres and so in a morning they came before the town of Simay
/ and gathered to gyder there a great pray / for they of the country thought
that the frenchmen would not a come so far / nor to have passed the wode of
Thyrach. So the frenchmen burnt the subarbes of Simay / and diverse other
vyllages there about nygh all the land of Simay except the fortresses / than
they went to Aube^ton in Thyerach / and there divided their boty. In the same
season the soudyours of Ca^bray came to a little strong house without Ca^bray
called Relenques / pertaining to sir John^ of Haynalt. And a bastard son of
his kept y^ house with a.xv. soudyours with him / so they were assailed a hole
day together / and ye dykes were so frosen that a man might well come to the
walls. And so they within trussed all that they had / and about mydnight
departed and set fire themself on the house: the next day when they of Cambray
came thither again / and sawehowe it was brent they did beat down all that
stood / And the captain of the house and his company went to Ualencennes. ye
have well hard by fore / how sir Gualter of Manny took y^ castle of Thine:
and set therm a brother of his called Gyles of Manny / he made many skirmysshes
with them of Ca^bray / and did them much trouble. And so it hapened on a day
that he went fro his garyson with a sixscore men of arms / and came to the
barrers of Cambray / and the brunt was so great that many armed them within the
cite / and came to ye gate where as the skirmyssh was. Where as sir Gyles had put
back them of Cambray / than they issued out: and among the cambreses there was
a young squire a gascoyne / called Wyllyam Merchant: who went out into the field
well horsed / his shield about his neck and his spear in his hand. And when
ser Gyles of Ma^ny saw him he rode f^er^ly to him: and there ser Gyles was
stryke^ through all his harnes to ye heart / so that y^ spear went clean through
his body and so he fell to the earth. Than there was a ^yers skirmysshe and many
stryken down on both parts / but finally they of Cambray obtained the place
and drew a way their ennemies / and took with them sir Gyles of Manny hurt as
he was / and so brought him to Cambray with great toye. Than incontinent they
dysarmed him / (...) did get surgions to dress his wound: for they would
gladly that he might escaped: but he dyed the next day after. Than they
d^^myned to send his body to his two brethren John^ and Tyrrey / who were in
the garyson at Bouhayne in Ostrenant: for though that the country of Heinalt
at that time was in no war / yet all the from ters to ward France were ever
in good awayt So than they ordained a horse lytter right honorably and put his
body therein / and caused.ii. freres to convey it to his brethren / who
received him with great sorrow. And they bare him to the freres at Ualencennes
/ and there he was buried: and after that the two brethren of Ma^ny came to
the castle of Thynel and made sore war against them of Cambray
incounteruengyng the death of their brother.

In this season: captain of Turney and Turneyses / was sir Godmarde Fay and of
the fortresses there about / and the lord of Beauye^ was within Mortayn on the
river of Lescaute / and the stuarde of Carcassonne was in the town of saint
Amande: ser Amery of Poyters in ^ouay the lord Galoisde la Baulme / and the
lord of Uyllars / the marshall of My(...)s / and the lord of Marneyl in the
cite of Cambray. And these knights / squyers / and soudyers of France desired
none other thing: but ye they might enter into Heynault / and to rob and ^yll
the country. Also the bishop of Cambray who was at Paris with the king /
co^playned how the heynowes had done him damage / bre^t and over ron his
country more than any other men. And than the king gave license to the soudiers
of Ca^bresys to make a rode into Heynalt: th^^ they of the garysous made a
journey / and were to the nombre of.vi. C. men of arms. And on a saturday in
the morning they departed fro Ca^bray: and also they of la Male Mayson / rode
forth the same day and met together and went to the town of Aspre / ye which
was a good town and a great without the walls. The peo(...) there were in no
dout for they knew of no war toward the^: so the frenchmen entered and
found men and women in their houses / and took them and robbed the town at
there pleasur. And tha set fire in the town: and brent it so clean that
nothing remained but the walls: within the town there was a priory of black
monks with great byldinges beside the church / which held of saint Wast of
Arras. The frenchmen also robbed the place / and brent it to the yerth / and
with all their pyllage they returned to Ca^bray These tidings anon came to
the knowledge of therle of Heynault / who was a bed and a ^^epe in his
lodgyng: called the sale / and suddenly he rose and armed him and called up all
such knights as were about him / but they were loged so abroad / that they
were not so son ready as therle was / who without taryeng for any person came
into the market place of Ualence^nes / and caused the belles to be souned
alaram / than every man a rose and armed them and followed therle their lord /
who was ryden out of ye town in great have and took the way toward Aspre: and
by that time he had ryden aleage / tidyng^ came to him how the frenchmen were
depted. Than he rode to thabbey of Fountnels / where as the lady his mother
was: and she had much a do to repayse him of his dyspleasure: for he said
plainly that the dystruction of Aspre should derely be revenged in the realm of
France. The good lady his mother: did asmoche as she could to swage his ire /
and to excuse the king of that deed. So wha^ therle had been there a certain
space / he took leave of her and returned to Ualence^nes: and inco^tynent
wrote letters to the prelates and knights of his country to have their aduyce
and counsel in that behalf. And when sir John^ of Heynalt knew her of / he
took his horse and came to therle his nephue: and as soon as the earl saw him
/ he said a fair uncle your absence has set the frenchmen in a pride A sir
quod he with your trouble and anoyance / I am sore dyspleased: how beit in a
manner I am glad thereof. Now ye be well rewarded for the service and love that
ye have borne to y^ frenchmen Now it behooves you to make a journey into
France against the frenchmen a uncle quod therle / look into what quart ye
think best and it shall be shortly done. So thus the day of parlyame^t assigned
at Mons came and thither resoried all the counsel of the country: and also of
Nolande and zelande / there were di^iers opynyons. Some would that certain
sufficyent per sons should be sent to the french king / to know if he were
co^sentyng to the hurt done in Henalt / or by what title he should make war
into the earls land without any defiaunce. And some other would that therle
should be revenged in like manner as the frenchmen had begone / how beit finally
all reasons debated: it was thought that therle could do no otherwise but to
make war into France. And it was ordained that therle should make his
defyaunce to the french king / and than to enter byforce into the realm of
France: and to bear these defya^ces was ordained / thabbot Thybalt of saint
Crispyne. So tha^ the letters of defyance were written and sealed by therle /
and by all ye nobles of the country. Than therle thanked all his lords / and
other of their good confort / and of their promise to aid to revenge him
against the frenchmen. Thabbot of saint Crispyne came into France / and
brought these de fyances to king Philypp^ / who made light thereof: and said how
his nephue was but an outraous folc / and how that he was a marcha^t to have
his country bre^t. Thabbot returned to therle and to his counsel / and showed
how he had sped. And than therle prepared for men of war in his country /
and in Brabant / and in Flanders: so that he had (...) great nombre together.
And so set forward / toward the land of Symay: for therlles intent was to go
and brenne the lands of y^ lord of Bremus / and also Aubenton / and Thyerache.

THey of Aubenton douted greatly therle of Heynalt and sir John^ his uncle. And
so they sent for some aid to the great bailey of Uerma^doys / and he sent to
the^ the vydam of Chalons / the lord Beaumont / the lord de la Bone / the
lord of Lore: and diverse other to the nombre of. CCC. men of arms. And so
they repaired ye town in certain places / and determined to abide the
heynowes and to defend the town: the which was a great town and full of
drapery. The heynowes came on a friday and lodged nere to Aubenton / and aduysed
the town / to se on what quarter it were most best to be taken: and in the
morning they aproched in three wards their baners before the^ right ordynatly:
and also their crosbowes. The earl of Heynalt led the first battle and with
him great nombre of the knights and squiers of his country. His uncle sir
John of Heynalt had the second battle / where as he had plenty of men a war.
The third had the lord Faulquemont with a good no^bre of almaynes. And so
thus every lord was under his own baner / and there began^e a sore assaut:
and the bows began to shote both within and without / whereby diverse were sore
hurt. Therle and his company came to the gate / there was a great assaut and a
sore skirmysshe: there the Uydame of Calons did marueyles / and he made at the
gate three of his sons knights. But finally therle and his company conquered
the baylies / and byforce made their ennemies to withdraw into yt gate And
also at the gate toward Symay was sir John^ de la Bone / and sir John^ Beamo^t
/ there was also a cruel assaut: they within were feign to withdraw in at their
gates and to leave the barrers / and the heynowes wan it / and y^ brige also.
There was a sore assaut: for such as were fled and entered within / went up on
the gate and cast down bars of iron / stones / pottes full of quycke lyme:
whereby many were sore hurt / a squire of Henalt received such a stroke with a
stone on his targe that it was clouyn clean a sonder with the stroke / and his
arm broken so that it was long after or he was hole. The saturday in the
morning there was a great assaut / and they within did their deuer to defend
themself: but finally the town was won byforce / and their pales and
defenses broken. And first entered into the town: sir John^ of Heynalt with his
baner / with great cryeng and showtyng. Than you Uydame of Chalons withdrewe him
and his company into the place before the mynster / and there made semblant to
defend himself as long as he might endure. But the lord of Bremus departed
without order for he knew well that sir John^ of Heynalt was lore dyspleased
with him so that he thought if he had been taken / yt no rau^some should have
saved his life. And when sir John^ of Heynalt knew that he was departed: that
had done somoche dyspleasure in his land of Symay / he pursued after him. But
the lord of Bremus sledde falt / and found the gate of his town opyn / and
so entered in: and ser Johanne of Heynault pursued him just to the gate with
his sword in his hand. But whan^e he saw that he was escaped / he returned
again to Aubenton: and his men met certain of y^ lord Bremus men as they
followed their master / and there they were stayne without mercy. The earl and
his company sought sore with the^ that were by the mynster / and there the Uydam
of Chalons did marueyls in arms / and so did two of his sons: but finally
they were all stayn there escaped none / but such as fled with the lord of
Bremus / but all were slain or taken: and a.ii. M. men of the town and all
the town robbed / and pylled: and all the goods sent to Symay / and the town
brent. And after y^ butnyng of Aubenton / the heynowes went to Mauber
Fountaynes: and incontinent they wan it / and robbed and brent the town. And
also the town of Daube^ueyll / and Segny the great and Segny the little / and
all the hamelettes there about the which were mo than.xl. Than the earl went to
Mouns / and gave leave to his men of war to depart / and thanked them in such
wise that they were all well content. Than anon after therle went to make
asure alyance with the king of England / to be the more stronger in his war
against the frenchmen. But first he made his uncle sir John^ of Heynalt chief
master and governor of Holande and zelande: and sir John^ lay still at Mons
and provided for the country and sent to Ualence^nes to confort and aid the^:
the lord Autoyng / the lord of Uerguy / y^ lord of Gomegynes / and sir Henry
of Huspharyce: and the steward of Heynault / with a hundred spears / to the
town of Landrechyes. And to Bouhayne three brethern almayns / called Courtars:
and to ^scaudyme^ / sir Gararde Sasses gynes / and into the town of Dauesnes /
ye lord of Faulquemount. And thus he did into every fortress on the fronters
of France.

How they of Tourney made a Courney into Flaunders. Cap. xlvi.
When the french king knew how the heynowes had brent the country of
Thyerache / taken and stayne his knights / and distroyed the good town of
Aubenton. Than he commanded the duke of Normandy his son / yt he should make
a journey into Heynalt / and bring the country into that case that it should
never bear couerd again. Also ye king ordained therle of Layll Gastone / who
was as than with the king at Paris / yt he should make a voyage into Gascoyne
as his lyeutenant / and to make war to Burdeux / and to Bordeloys: and to all
the fortresses that held of the king of England. And also the french king
enforced his great navy that he had on the sea / and commanded them to keep
the bonds of Flanders and not to suffer the king of England to pass over the sea into Flanders on pain of their lives. And when ye french king understood
that the flemynges had made homage to the king of England / he sent unto them
a prelate under the color of the pope. Showing them that is they would
return and knowledge themself to hold of him / and of the crown of
France: and to forsake the king of England / who had enchaunted them. Than he
said he would perdon them of all their trespaces / and would quyte the^ of the
great so^me of money / that they were bound unto him by oblygacion of old time:
and also to give the^ many fair franchyses. And ye slemmynges answered / how
they thought themself right well assoyled and quyted in any thing yt they
were bound to the king of France. Than the french king complained to pope
Clement the.vi. whereupon the pope did cast such a sentence of cursyng / that
no priest durst sing or say there any divine service. Whereof the slemmynges sent
a great co^playnt unto the king of England: who to apease them / sent them
word yt when he came over the sea / he would bring priests out of his country
to sing masses / whyther the pope would or not: for he said he had priuylege so
to do. And so by that means the fle^mynges were somewhat apeased. And when the
french king saw that he could not turn the sle^mynges fro their opynion /
than he commanded them of the garysons of Tourney / Lysle / and (...)* and
other to make war on the flem(...) and to over run the country. And so
(...) ^ohn^ du Roy / and ser Mathue de Try marshall of France: and sir Godmar
du Fay / and diverse other lords made an army of. M. men of arms and. CCC.
crosbowes: what of Turney / Lylle / and Doway. And so in an euenyng there
departed fro Turney / and by y^ it was day in the morning * they were before
Courtray / by (...) ^^yme the son was up they had gathered together all the
catall there about: and some of the^ ran to the gates / and slew and hurt
diverse that they found without. And than^e they returned without any damage
and drove before them al their prays so that wha^ they came to Turney / they
had mo tha^.x. M. sheep / and as many swyne beats / and kyen: whereof the
flemynges were sore troubled. Than Jaques Dartuell swear y^ it should be derely
revenged / and inco^tynent he commanded the good towns of Flanders that their
men a war should be with him before Turney at a day assigned / and he wrote to
therle of Salysbury and to therle of Suffolk who were at Ipre / that they
should be there at y^ same. And so against the day lymitted / he went out of
Gau^t and came to a place between And warpe and Turney called le Pount de Sere:
and there he lodged and tarried for therles of England and for them of Frank
and of Bruges. The said two earls thought for their honor that the enterprise
should not be delayed by them: and so sent to Jaques Dartuell / promysing him
not to fail / to be at the day appointed. And so on a day they departed from
Ipre with a.l. spears / and a forty crosbowes* and went toward the place
where as Jaques Dartuell abode for the^ and as they passed by the town of Lyle
they were perceived. And they of the town issued out with a.xv. C. men a foot
and a horsbacke / and went in.iii. parts / to thentent that therles should not
escape the^. So these two earls rode forth by the gyding of sir U(...)art de la
Crox * who had kept long warr^ against them of Lyle / and he knew all y^ ways
of the country: and as than was at Ipre. And so he came forth with these earls
to be their gyde / and he had well gyded them: and they of Lyle had nuely made
a great dyke where as there was never none before / and when sir Uauflart had
brought them thither and saw how the way was nuely stopped: he said to therles
of England / sirs I se well we can not pass without the danger of them of
Lysle: wherefore I counsel let us turn again and take some other way. Than
the lords said nay sir Uauflart: it shall never be said that we woll go out
of our way for fear of them of Lysle. Therefore ride on before / we have
promised Jaques Dartuell to be with him this day: and so thenglysshmen rode forth
with out fear. Than sir Uauflart said sirs ye have taken me in this vyage to
be your gyde / and I have been with you all this winter i^ Ipre / whereof I am
much bound to you. But if they of Lyle issue out upon us / have no trust that
I will abide them / for I will save my self as soon as I can / for if I were
taken it should cost me my life the which I love better tha^ your company. Than
the lords did laugh at him and said well / and if it be so we hold you well
excused: and as he ymagined so it be fell * for or they were ware they were in
danger of the french busshement / who cried stop sirs / for ye shall not
pass this way without our license: and so began to shote and to run on the
englysshmen. And as soon as sir Uauflart saw the manner he had no list to ride
any farther: but returned as soon as he might and gate himself out of the
preace. And the. i^. earls fell in the hands of their ennemies / like fysshes
in a net for they were closed round about in a narowe strayet passage among
hedges busshes / and dykes: so that they could escape no manner of way / forward
nor backewarde. So when they saw that they were so hardly bestad they a lyghted
a foot and defended themself as well as they might / and did hurt diverse of
the^ of Lysle. But finally their defense could not avail them / for ever new
fresshe men of war came on them. So there they were taken byforce and with them
a young squire of Lymosyne / nephue to pope Clement called Remon / who after
that he was yielded prisoner / was slain for couetyse of his fair harnes: and
fresshe apareyle. These two earls were set in prison in the hall of Lysle / and
after sent to the french king: who promised to them of Lysle a great reward
for the good service that they had done him. And whan^e Jaques Dartuell / who
was at Pont de Far knew those tidings he was sore dyspleased / and so
seized his enterprise for that time / and returned again to Gaunt.

Of the journey that duke John^ of Normandy made into Heynault. Cap..xlvii.
DUke John^ of Normandy eldyst son to the french king / made his assemble to
be at saint Quyntines. And with him was the duke of Athenes therle of Flaunders
/ the earl of Aucerr / the earl of Ewe / and constable of France therle of
Porcyen / therle of Roussy / therle of Bresne / therle of de grant Pre / the
lord Couey / the lord Craon and diverse other nobles of Normandy / and of the
low marches. And when they were all assembled anon after Easter / the year of
our lord. M. CCC.xl. The constables and the two marshals: nombred their
company to be a.vi. thousand men of arms / and.viii. M. of other following the
host. And so they went forth in to the feldes / and went toward y^ castle
of Ca^bre ser and passed by Bohayn / and rode till they passed the said castle
in Cambre s. And lodged in the town of Montays on the river of Sels and sir
Richard of Uerchyne steward of Henalt / knew by his spies: how the duke of
Normandy was at Moutays. Than he desired certain knights and squyers / such
as were nere about him: to go with him thither as he would bring them / and they
granted him so to do. And so departed fro his house at Uerchyn / and with him
a. l^. spears / and rode forth fro the son setting / till he came to a
forest in the yssuyng out of Heynalt a little leage fro Montays / and by y^
time it was night: than he rested him in a field / and said to his company.
How he would go and a wake the duke at Montays / whereof they were right
ioyouse. And said how they would adventure with him to live and dye: he
thanked them and with him there was ser Jaques de Sart sir Henry of Phalyse /
sir Olpharte du Guystelles / sir John^ du Chastellet / and sir Bertrande. And
of squyers there (...)s: Gyles and Thyerty of Sommayne / Baudwyn of Beaufort /
Colebrier of Brule Moreau of Lescuyer / Sawdart de Stramen / Joha^n of Robersat
/ Bridoull de Thyaulx and diverse other: they rode privily and came to Mo^tays
/ and entered into y^ town. The frenchmen had made no watch / and so the
steward and all his company alyghted before a fair great lodgyng / wenyng to
them that the duke had lodged there / but he was in an other house. But they
were loged.ii. great lords of Normandy: the lord of Baylleull / and the lord
of Beaulte / and they were quickly assailed and the gate broken ^pynne. When
they hard the cry of Heynalt they were a basshed / and defended themself as
well as they might and there the lord of Baylleull was slain / and the lord
of Beauty taken: and was feign to promise the seneshall on his faith and
troth to yield himself prisoner / with in three days after at Uale^cens. Than
the frenchmen began to stir in the town / and came out of their logynges and
(...) fires and lighted up torches and candels / and each of the^ raised up
other: and a woke the duke who rose and armed him in have / and displayed his
baner before his logyng / and every man drue thither Than the heynoues withdrue
a back sagely to their horses / and mounted: and when they were all to gyder
they had a x. or.xii. good prisoners / and so returned without any damage / for
they were not pursued it was so dark. And so they came by that it was day to
Quesnoy / and there they rested them / and than rode to Ualencens. In the
morning the duke commanded to dysloge / and to enter into Heynalt and to bren
the country with out mercy. So the fore ryders went forth a.ii. C. spears / and
captayns of the^ were: sir Thybalt of Marncyle / the Galoys of y^ Baume / the
lord of Myrpois / the lord of Rayuenall / the lord of Sempy / y^ lord John^
of Landas / the lord of Hangest / and the lord of Tramels: and after them
rode the two marshals with five. C. speres. And than the duke with other lords
and knights / and so the fore ryders burnt Forest bertran / Bertynguinell /
Escarmayne / Ue^degres (...) y^ wod / Ue^degres on y^ sands / upon y^ river of
Cynell. And the next day they went forward / and brent Osmelnall / Uyllers /
Go^megynes / Marchepoys Pestell^ Aufroy / Pyepreux / Fresnoy Obeys the good
town of Ba^noy: and all the country to the river of Ho^mell. And y^ same
second day / the marshals company made a great assaut and skirmysshe at the
castle of Uerchy^e* but they wan nothing there it was so well defended Than
they went and lodged by the river of Selz between Ausey and Sansoy / and sir
Ualeron lord of Falquemont was captain of y^ town of Maubenge / and with him
a. C. spears of almayns and heynowes. And whan^e he knew that the frenchmen
rode and brent the country / and saw how the poor people wept: he armed him
and his company / and left the town in the keeping of the lord of Beau Reuoyr
/ and the lord Montigny: and he said he would gladly find the frenchmen. And
so he rode all that day coostyng y^ forest of Moriuall / and against night he
hard how the duke of Normandy was loged by y^ river of Sels / than he said he
would go and a wake them. And so he rode forth / and about mydnight he passed
the river by a gyde / and when he was over he made him and his company ready /
and so rode fair and easily till he came to the dukes logyng: and when they
were nere they spurred their horses and dasshed into thoost / and cried
Falquemont: and cut down tents and pauilyons / and slew diverse men and did
great hurt. Than the host began to sterre and armed them / and drew to that
part where as the noise was: and the lord of Falquemont when he saw it was
time he drue a back / and of the frenchmen there were slain / the lord of
Pyquegny / and taken prisoners: the vycont of Quesnes and the Borgne of Rouuory
/ and sore hurt sir Antony of Condune. And when ye lord Falquemont thought
best / he departed and all his company / and passed the river of Sels without
damage for they were not followed: and so by the son risyng they came to
Quesnoy / where as sir Thyerrie of Uallecourt opyned to them the gate. The next
day after this deed the duke of Normandy caused his trumpettes to be blown and
so passed the tyuer of Sels / and entered into Heynalt. And such as rode before
/ as ye marshall of Mitpoys / the lord of Noysiers / the Galoys of the Baulme /
and sir Thybalt of Marneyle / and iiii. C. spears beside the brigantes came
before Quesnoy to the bariers / and made semblant to give assaut. But they
within were so well provided with good men of war and artyllery / that they
should have lost their pain how beit they made a little skirmyssh before the
bayles. But at last they were feign to wtdrawe for they of Quesnoy dyscharged
certain pieces of artyllery and shot out great quarrels / whereof the frenchmen
were a frayd for sleyng of their horses. And so withdrue back / and in their
going they brent Uergyn the great / and Uergyn the little / Frelanes / Sa^^uers
/ Arts / Semeries / Artuell / Saryten / Turgies / Estynen / Aulnoy: and diverse
other / so yt the smoke came to Ualence^nes. And than the frenchmen ordained
their batels on the mount of Casters nere to Ualence^nes: and certain of them
/ as the lord of Craon the lord of Mauluryer / the lord of Mathelon / the
lord of Dauoyr / and a two. C. spears with them rode toward Mayng / and came
and assailed a great to wre / parteyninge to John Uernyer of Uale^cens / and
afterward it was perteyning to John^ Neuell. There was a great and a fierce
assaut / endurynge nygh all day: so that of the frenchmen or they departed were
slain a.v. or.vi. but they within defended themself so well yt they took no
damage. Than some of the frenchmen went to Try / wenyng at their first coming
to have past the water: but they of the to wne had broken the bridge / and
defended the passage: so that the frenchmen could never have won it that way.
Than^e there were some among them that knew the passages and the country / and
so they brought a two. C. men a foot and passed the plankes at Ponny: and as soon as they were over they came on the^ of Try who were but a small nombre /
and could not endure against them: and so they fled and diverse were slain
and hurt. The same day the se neshall of Heynalt was departed out of Ualencens
/ with a. C. men of arms to socour them of Try: and a little fro saint wast
they met with a.rrv. currours of the frenchmen / and the lord Boucyqualt / who
was after marshall of France and the lord of Surgeres / and sir Wyllyam
Bla^deau was their captayns / and they had passed the bridge by Ualence^nes /
called the bridge de la Tourell. And when the seneshall of Heynalt saw them /
he ran out at them and bare down with his spear the lord Boucyquault / and
took him prisoner and sent him to Ualencens: the lord of Surgeres escaped / but
ser Wyllyam Blandeau was taken by sir Henry Dusphalyse: and all the other were
taken and slain but a few that escaped. And so than the seneshal went toward
Try: but he came to late / for the frenchemen had won it or he came / and
were beatyng down of the mylles / and of a little castle that was there / but
when the seneshall came they had no leaser for they were put a back / slay ne
and put to flight / and chased so nere that many lept into the river of
Lescalt: and some drowned. So thus the town of Try was delyuerd and than the
seneshall went and passed ye river of Lescalt at Deuayng: and than he and all
his company rode to his castle of Uerchyn and entered into it / to keep and
defend it if need were. All this season the duke of Normandy was on the mount
of Casters nygh all day / thinking ever yt they of Ualencennes would have
issued out to have fought with him / and so they would feign have done / and
sir Henry Dantoynge who had rule of the town had not ben: for he would suffer
no man to issue out. And he was at the gate Cambresen / and had much a do to
keep the people with in and ye provost of the town with him / who with fair
words and great reasons a peased the people. And when ye duke saw that they
would not issue out to give him battle: than he sent to ye duke of Athenes:
and the marshals of Faunce / therle of Aucerre / and the lord of Chastelon
with a three hundred spears: to rynne to Ualencens. And so they rode in good
order / and came to the bayls on ye side of Tourell / but they tarried not there
long they feared so the shot / for sleynge of their horses: howbeit ye lord of
Chastelon rode so forward / that his horse fell under him: so yt he was feign
to leap on another / than they returned by the marches / and brent and beat
down the mylles on ye tyuer of Uyncell: and so ca^e by Chartreux / and than to
their host again. There were some of the frenchmen that tarried behind at
Marlyto get forage more at their case: and such as kept a tow^^ thereby
perteyning to the heirs of Heynault / and sometime it was belongyng to sir
Robert de Namur: by yt right of the lady Isabell his wife. When they parceyued
these fre^chemen yt were behind their host and how that thoost was far of
fro the^ / they issued out and set on them / and slew many and took all their
pyllage / and entered again to their toure. All this season: yet the great
battle was still on the mount of Castres and when the currers came in on every
side / than they took counsel what they should do. The lords said how they
were no nombre suffycient to assaut such a town as Ualencennes / and finally
they determined to go to Cambray: and so that night they went and lodged at
Monyg / and at Fountnelles: and made good watch / the next morning they
departed / and ar they went brent Monyg and Fountnelles / and the abbay
parteyning to the lady of Ualoys / suster germayne to the french king. Whereof
the duke was sore dyspleased and caused them to be hanged that began the
fire: and than at their departing they brent the town of Try and the castle /
and beat down the mylles / and brent Prony / Romminy / Thyaur / Mouceaulr:
and all the plain country by twene Cambray and Ualencennes. And than^e the
duke came to Escandure / to a castle parteynynge to the earl of Heynault:
standing strongly on the river of Lescault / the which garyson had greuyd
sore the town of Cambray / and capytayne thereof was sir Gararde of Sassegynes.
And when the duke had been before that castle a six days it was given up /
whereof all the country had great marueyle / and had great suspect of treason
to the captain sir Gararde / and to a squire of his called Robert Marmeaulr:
and after they both dyed shamefully at Mons in Heynalt. And they of Cambray
beat down the castle / and bare all the stones into their town to make
reparacyons withal.

How they of Doway made a iournay into Ostrenan / and how therle of Heynalt
was in England. Ca. xlviii.
AFter the dystruction of Escandure: the duke of Normandy went to Cambray and
gave leave to some of his company to depart / and some he sent to the garysons
of Doway and other. And the first weke that they came to Doway they issued out
and they of List with them: so that they were a three hundred spears / and
their capytaynes were: sir Loyes of Sauoy / therle of Geneue / therle of
Uyllars / the Galoys of the Baulme / the lord of waurayne / the lord of
Uasyers: and so they went and brent the fair country of Ostrenan in Heynault:
and lest nothing with out the forteresses / wherewith they of Bouhay^ were sore
dysplesed: for they saw the fyers and smokes / and could not remedy it. And
so they sent to them to Ualencennes / that if they would issue out a six
hundred speres in the night they should do much damage to the frenchmen / who
were spredde abroad in the plain country / how be it they of Ualencennes
would natte go out of the town. So the frenchmen had great pray / and brent
the town of Nyche / Descoux / Escaudan / Here / Monteny / Senayne Uerlayne /
Uargny / Ambretycourt / Lourg / Salr / Ruette / Newfuylle / Lyeu saint Amande:
and all the vyllages in that country / and wan great pyllage. And when they of
Doway were gone home than the soudyers of Bohayne issued out and brent the
half of Descon which was french / and all the vyllages parteyning to France
just to the gates of Doway: and the town of Desquerchyne. Thus as I have
devised / the garysons in those countries were provided for and diverse
skirmysshes and feats of war used among them: the same time there was
certain soudyours of Almaygne set by the bishop of Cambray in the
fortress of Male Mayson / a two leages fro the castle Cambresien: and
marchynge on the other part nere to La^dreches / whereof the lord of Poytrell
was captain / for therle of Bloys though he were lord thereof / yet he had
rendered it to therle of Heynalt because he was as than french. So on a day y^
Almayns of Male Mayson / ca^e to ye bayles of Landreches / and drove away a
great pray. And when they of Landreches knew thereof / y^ lord of Poytrels armed
him and all his company / and issued out to rescue the pray: the lord of
Poytrels was formast himself / and laid his spear in the rest and cried to the
frenchmen / and said sirs it is shame to fly away. And there was a squire
called Albert of Colayne / he turned and couched the spear in the rest / and
came rennyng against the lord of Poytrell / and gave him such a stroke on the
targe that the spear flewe all to peaces: yet the said squire struck him again
such a stroke that the spear entered through his harnes / and into his body
just to y^ heart: so that he fell f^o his horse deed. Than his co^panyons
h(...)ous / as the lord of Bansiers / Garard de Mastyne and John^ of Mastyn /
and other pursued the frenchmen / in such wise that they were taken and s^ayne
the most part / but few y^ escaped / and their pray rescued and such
prisoners as they had of Landreches. And so returned again with the lord of
Poytrels deed: after whose death the lord of Floron was long time captain of
Landreches / and of the castle there. Thus some day rode forth the frenchmen /
and some day the heinous / and diverse encountrynges was between them. Thus the
country of Heynault was in great trybulacion / for part thereof was brent: and
the duke of Normandy was still on the fronters and no man knew what he would
do / and they could here no tidings of therle of Heynalt. True it was he was
in England / where as the king and the lords made him great there / and made
great alyance with the king there. And so departed out of England / and went
to the emperor Loys of Banyer: and so these were the causes why ye he tarried so
long out of his own country. And also sir Johanne of Heynalt was gone into
Brabant / and into Flaunders: and showed to the earl of Brabant / and to Jaques
Dartuell the desolacyon of the country of Heynalt: prayeng them in the name of
all the heynowes / that they would give th^^ some counsel and aid. And they
answered / that they were sure that therle would shortly return: at which time
they said / they would be ready to go with him whyther as he would.

How the duke of Normandy laid siege to Thine Leuesque. Cap. xlix.
IN the mean season that the duke of Normandy was at Cambray: the bishop and
the burgesses of the town / showed the duke how the heynowes had get by stelth
/ the strong castle of Thine: desyring him for the common profet of the
country that he would find some remedy for ye garyson there did much hurt to
their country / than the duke called again toguyder men of war out of
Artoyse / and Uermandoys. And so deperted from Cambray / and came before Thine
on the river of Lescalt / in the fair plain meadows toward Ostrenan. The
duke carried with him out of Cambray / and Doway: diverse great engyns and
specially.vi. and made them to be reared again the fortres: so these engyns
did cast night and day great stones / the which beat down the roffes of the
chambers / halles / and towers: so that they within / were feign to keep vautes
/ and sellars. Thus they within suffered great pain / and captayns within were
sir Richard Lymosyn english / and two squyers of Heynault brethren to
therle of Namur / Joha^ne and Thyerry. These three that had the charge / said
often time to their company: sirs surely one of these days / therle of Heynalt
will come against these frenchmen and deliver us with honor / and ryd us out of
this paryll / and shall can us great thank that we have kept this fortres so
long. The ingens without did cast in deed horses and beestes stynki^g: whereby
they within had great dystres thau^e with any other thing / for the air was
hot as in the mids of somer: the stynke and air was so abomynable / that
they consydred how that finally they could not long endure. Than they took
advise to desire a truse for.xv. days / and in that space to send and
aduertyse ser John^ of Heynalt / who was ruler of the country in therles
absence / and without that he did socour them in that space / to yield up the
fortres to the duke. This treaty was put forth and agreed unto / than they with
in sent a squire called Estrelart de Sommayne / to sir John^ of Heynalt: and at
Mons in Heynalt the squire found him / who had nuely hard fro his nephue
therle: how that he was coming home ward into his country / and had been
with the emperor and made great alyance with him and with the king of England:
and with the other lords of thempyre. All this sir John^ of Henault showed to
this squire / sendyng word to them of Thine that shortly they should be
conforted at the return of his nephue therle. This ^^use during / the^le of
Heynalt returned home whereof all his people were greatly reioysed. Than the lord
Beamonde his uncle / showed him all matters that was done sith his departing /
and how that y^ duke of Normandy had feign on the fronters / and brent and
dystroyed a great part of his country. Therle answered how it should be well
amended: sayng how the realm of France was great enough to make satisfaction
of all forfeturs by them done / and determined brefelye to go and aid his men
at Thine / who had so honorably defended their fortresses. Than ye earl sent
for men into Almayne / into Flanders / and in his own country: and so came to
Ualen cennes / and daily his nombre increased. And departed thens in great
array: with caryag^ / tents and pauilyons: and went and lodged at Na^s on ye
plain a long by ye river of Lescalt. There were lords of Heynalt: sir John^ of
Heynalt / y^ lord of D^ghyn / the lord of Uerchyn / the seneshall of Heynalt /
the lord Dantoyng / the lord of Barb^son / the lord of Lens / sir Wyllyam of
Baylleull / the lord of Hauereth / chatelayne of Mons / the lord of Montegny
/ the lord of Barbays / sir Thyrrie of Ualecourt marshall of Henalt / the lord
of Dalmed and of Gomegynes / the lord of Brisuell / the lord of Roysine / the
lord of Trasegmes / the lord de Lalayne / the lord of Mastyne / the lord of
Sars / the lord Uargny / the lord of Beaury^u: and diverse other who were all
there to serve therle their lord. Also thither came therle of Namur with.ii.
hundred spears: and after ca^e the duke of Brabant with.vi. hundred speres /
the duke of Guerles / therle of Mons / the lord of Falquemont / sir Arnolde
Baquechen: and diverse other lords and men a war of Almaygne / and
Whytphall. And so all these loged along by the river of Lescault / against the
french host / and plenty of vytails came to them out of Heynalt. And whafie
these lords were thus lodged between Nauns / and Illoys. The duke of Normandy
who was on the other part with a goodly nombre of men a war / he send word
to his father how that therls host daily increased. Than the french king
bevnge at Peron / raised up mo men of war / and send to his son a.xii.
hundred spears. And so himself came to his sons host like a soudyour / for
he might (...) come with an army upon the emperor / without heshulde break his
oath as he did. So y^ duke of Normandy was named to be chief of that army:
but he did nothing but by the counsel of the king his father. When they wtin
Thine saw therle of Heynalt of such puyssance / they were right ioyeous: and
the fourth day after yt the earl was come thither / they of Ualence(...) came
thither in great a^ay: and John^ ^e Boy^sey provost of the town was their
capytayne. Than there was a skirmyssh made against the frenchemen / and diverse
hurt on both (...) and in the mean season / they within the fortres had
bottes and barges ready / and so pas^e (...) the river of Les^ault / and were
brought to the earl of Heyualt: who ioyously and honorably received them. In
this time that these two hosts were lodged on the river of Lescault / the
(...)chmen toward France: and the heynowes toward their own contreis. Their
forages rode forth but they met not / because the river was ever between them:
but the frenchmen went and brent the country of Ostrenan / that was not brent
before: and the heynowes in likewise the country of Cambreses. Also to the aid
of therle of Heynault / at the desire of Jaques (...) came thither a. l^.
thousand (...)mmynges wel^ armed. Than therle of Heynalt sent to the duke of
Normandy by his haraltes* that there might be batell between them: and how that
it should be a great shame so many men of war assembled together / and no
battle. The duke answered how he would take advise and counsel in that matter
/ the which counsel was so long / that the haraldes departed without answer.
Than the third day after: therle sent again to know the dukes intencyon / and
the duke answered how he was not yet fully counseled to fight nor to assign a
day of battle. Sayng moreover how that therle was very hasty: when the earl
hard that he thought that it was but a delay / than he sent for all the great
lords of his host / showing them what he had done / and what answer the duke
had made him: desyring the to have their counsel. Than every man looked on
other / and no man would speak first: at last the duke of Braba^t spoke for all
(and said) as to make a bridge and go over to sight with the frenchmen is not
mine opynion: for I know certainly that shortly the king of England will come
over thesee / and lay sege to Turney / and we all have sworn to aid and
confort him in all that we can. Wherefore if we should now fight with the
frenchmen / and fortune to be again us / that we hap to lose y^ field / he
should lose his vyage / and all the help that he should have of us. And if we
had the vyctorie he should can us no thank / wherefore my intencyon is that
without him: who is chief of this war / that we fight not with the power of
France. But when we shall be before Turney with him and the french king
against us / I think it will be hard to depart without batell wherefore I
would counsel let us depart / for here we lie at great coost and charge / for
I am sure within these.x. days we shall here fro the king of England. To this
aduyce the most part of the lords agreed / but therle of Heynalt desired them
all in general not to depart so sone: and so they agreed to tarry so^ what
lengar they of Brussels would feign have been gone / and they of Louane. On a
day therle called to him sir John^ of Heynalt his uncle / and said fair uncle
I pray you ride down a long by the river side / and call ou^r the river to
speak with some person of the trenche host / and desire him to show the
french king fro me / that I will make a bridge over the water: so that I may
have three days respyte / and than I woll come over and give him batell. Than
the lord Beamond rode down a long by the river of Lescalt and a.xiii.
knights with him / and his penon before him: and at last he parceyued on the
other side a knight of Normandy / he knew him by his arms. Than he called to
him and said / sir Maubousson I pray you speak with me. Than the knight said
sir what would you with me / I desire you quod the lord Beamonde that ye will
go to the french king and to his counsel / and say how the earl of Heynault
has send me hither to take a truse all only whiles yt he might make a brige
over this river: whereby he and his / might pass over. I pray you bring me
again an answer and I shall tarry here till ye return. Than the lord of
Maubusso^ struck his horse with ye spurs and rode to the kings tent / where
as ye duke of Normandy and many other lords were / there he showed his message
and he had a short answer for he was commanded to tell him that sent him
thither / that in ye same case as they had held the earl / in likewise so they
would co^tynue. Sayng how they would make him to sell his land / and that he
should have war on every side / and when we list we woll enter into Heynalt /
so far yt we woll bren all his eo^trey. This answer the lord of Maubusson /
reported to the lord Beamo^d: who thanked him of his labor and so returned
to therle / whom he found playng at chesse with therle of Namur. and as soon as
therle saw his uncle / he a rose and hard the answer that the french king
had sent him / wherewith the earl was dysplesed and said well / I trust it shall
not be as he purposes.

Of the batell on the sea before Sluse in Flanders / between the king of
England and the frenchmen. Ca. l.
NO we let us leave somewhat to speak of therle of Henalt and of the duke of
Normandy: and speak of ye king of England. Who was on ye see to the intent to
arryue in Flaunders / and so into Heynalt to make war against the frenchmen.
This was on mydsomer even / in the yer of our lord M. C C C.xl. all thenglyssh
flete was departed out of the river of Tames / and took the way to Sluse. And
the same time between Blanqueberque and Sluse on the sea: was sir New Kyryell
sir Peter Bahuchet / and Barbnoyr: and mo than sirscore great vessels beside
other / and they were of normayns / bydaulr / genowes / and pycardes: about the
no^bre of.xl. M. There they were laid by the french king / to defend ye king of
Englandes passage. The king of England and his / came saylyng till he ca^e
before Sluse: and when he saw so great a nombre of ships yt their mastes
seemed to be like a great wood / he demanded of the master of his ship what
people he thought they were: he answered and said / sir I think they be
normayns laid here by ye french king / and has done great dyspleasur in
England / brent your town of Hampton / and taken your great ship the
Christofer: a quod the king I have long desired to fight with the frenchmen:
and now shall I fight with some of the^ by the grace of god and saint George /
for truly they have done me so many dysplesurs yt I shall be revenged and I
may. Than the king set all his ships in order / the grettest before well
furnysshed with archers / and ever between two ships of archers he had one
shypp^ with men of arms / and than he made an other batell to ly a lofe with
archers to confort ever the^ that were most weary / if need were. And there were
a great nombre of countesses / ladies / knights wives: and other damsels yt
were going to se the queen at Gaunt: these ladies ye king caused to be well
kept with three hundred men of arms / and.v. C. archers. When the king and his
marshals had ordered his batayls / he brewe up the seals and can^ with a
quarter wind / to have the vauntage of the son. And so at last they turned
a little to get the wind at will: and when the normayns saw them recule back
/ they had marvel why they did so. And some said / they think them self not
mete to medyll with us: wherefore they woll go back / they saw well how the
king of England was there personally / by reason of his baners. Than they did
appareyle their flete in order / for they were sage and good men of war on the sea: and did set the Christofer / the which they had won the yer before / to be
formast with many trumpettes and instruments: and so set on their ennemies.
There began a sore batell on both parts: archers and crosbowes began to shore
/ and men of arms aproched and fought band to hand / and the better to come
together / they had great hokes / and graperss of prou to cast out of one ship
into an other. And so tied the^ fast together / there were many dedess of arms
done taking and rescuyng again. And at last the great Christofer was first won
by the^glysshmen / and all that were within it taken or slain Than there was
great noise and cry / and thenglysshmen aproched and fortifyed the Christofer
with archers / and made him to pass on before to fight with the genoweyss.
This battle was right fierce and terryble: for the batayls on the sea at more
dangerous and fierser / than the batayls by land. For on the sea there iss no
reculyng nor sseyng / there is no remedy but to fight / and to abide fortune:
and every man to show his prowes. Of a truth sir New Kyriell / and sir
Bahuchet / and Bathe Noyer / were right good and expert men of war. This
battle endured fro the morning till it was noone / and the^glysshmen endured
much pain / for their ennemies were four against one / and all good men o^
the sea. there the king of England was a noble knight of his ownehandes he was
in the stouer of his yongh. In like wise so was the earl of Derby / Pe^broke /
Herforde / Hu^tyngdon / Northampton / and Glocetter: sir Raynolde Cobham / sir
Richard Stafforde / the lord Percy sir water of Manny / sir Henry of
Flaunders / sir John^ Beauchamp: the lord Felton / ye lord Brasseton / sir
Chandos / the lord Dalawarre / the lord of Multon / sir Robert Dartoys /
called earl of Rychmont: and diverse other lords and knyghtess / who bare
themself so valy antly with some socours that they had of Bruges / and of the
country there about / that they obtained the vyctorie. So that the frenchmen /
normaynss / and other were dysconsetted / slain / and drowned / there was not
one that escaped: but all were slain. Whan^e this vyctorie was atchyued / the
king all that night abode in his ship before Sluse / with great noise of
tru^pettes and other instruments. Thither came to se the king diverse of
Flaunders / such as had herd of ye kings coming: and than the king
demanded of the burgesses of Bruges / how Jaques Dartuell did. They answered
/ that he was gone to y^ earl of Heynalt / against the duke of Normandy
with.lx. M. ssemynges. And on the next day / y^ which was mydsomer day / the
king and all his took land / and the king on foot went a pylgrimage to our
lady of Arde^bourge and there herd mass and dyned and than^e took his horse and
rode to Gaunt / where the queen received him with great joy: and all his
caryage ca^e after little and little. Than the king wrote to therle of Heynault
/ and to them within the castle of Thine / certyfieng them of his arryuall.
And when therle knew thereof / and that he had dysconfyted the army on the sea:
he dylloged and gave leave to all the souldyours to depart. And took with him
to Ualencennes / all the great lords and there feasted them honorably: and
specially the duke of Brabant / and Jaques Dartuell. And there Jaques Dartuell:
openly in the market place in the presence of all the lords / and of all such
as would here him: declared what right the king of England had to the crown of
France: and also what puyssaunce the three countries were of / Flaunders /
Heynault / and Brabant: surely joined in one alyance. And he did so by his
great wisdom / and plesaunt words that all people that hard him praised him
much: and said how he had nobly spoken / and by great experye^ee. And thus he
was greatly praised / and it was said yt he was well worthy to govern y^
county of Flaunders. Than the lords departed / and promised to mete again
within.viii. days at Gaunt to se the king of England / and so they did. And
the king feasted them honorably / and so did the queen / who was as than nuly
purifyed of a son called John^ / who was after duke of Lancastre by his wife
/ daughter to duke Henry of Lancaster. Than there was a counsel set to be at
Uyllenort / and a day lymitted.

How king Robert of Cicyll did all that he might to pacyfie the kings of
France / and England. Cap. ^i.
When the french king hard how his army on the sea was dyscoufyted: he
dylloged and drew to Arras / and gave leave to his men to depart till he hard
other tidings. And sent sir Godmar du Fay to Tourney to se that there lacked
nothing: he feared more the itemynges than any other. And sent the lord of
Beautewe / to Mortayn to keep the fronters against Heynalt and he sent many me^
of war to saint Omers / to Air / and to saint ^enaunt and purueyed
suffyciently for all the forteresses frontyng on Flanders. In this season there
raygned a king in Cicyll called Robert / who was reputed to be a great
astronomyer and always he warned the french king and his counsel that in no
wise he should fight against the king of England: for he said it was given the
king of England to be right fortunate in all his deeds. This king Robert would
gladly have seen these two kings at a good acorde: for he loved somoch the
crown of France / y^ he was right sort to se the desolacyon cherof. This
king of Cicyll was at Auygnone with pope Clement / and with the college there
and declared to them the peryls y^ were likely to fall in the realm of France:
by the war byt wene the said two kings / de syring them that they would help
to find some means to apease them. Where unto y^ pope and the cardynals
answered: how they would gladly intend thereto / so that the two kings would
he^e them.

Of the counsel that the king of England / and his alyes held at
Uyllenort. Cap. lii.
AT this counsel holden at Uyllenort / were these lords as follows. The
king of England / y^ duke of Brabant / therle of Henalt ser John his uncle / y^
duke of Guerles / therle of Jullers / the marquis of Faulquehoure / the marquis
of Musse / therle of Mons / sir Robert Dartoys / the lord of Falquemont / sir
Wyllyam of Dunort / therle of Namur / Jaques Dartuell and many other great
lords and of every good town of Flanders a three or.iiii. personages in manner
of a counsel. There was a grement made between the three contreis: Fla^ders /
Braba^t / and Heynalt: that fro thens forth each of them should aid and
confort other in all cases. And there they made assurance each to other that if
any of them had to do with any country the other two should give aid. And her
after if any of them should be at dyscorde one with an other / the third
should set agreement between the^. And if he were not able so to do / than the
matter should be put unto the king of England / in whose hands this matter was
sworn and promised / and he to agree them. And inconfyrmacion of love and
amyte: they ordained a law to ryn throughout those.iii. contres / ye which was
called the law of the companyons or alyes: and there it was determined yt the
king of England should remove about Maudelentyde after / and ley siege to
Turney: and there to mete all y^ said lords and there is / with the powers of all
y^ good to wnes. And than every man departed to their own houses / to aparell
them in that behalf.

How the king of England hesieged the cite of Tourney with great puysance.
Cap. liii.
THe french king after the departure of these lords fro the counsel of
Uyllenort he knew y^ most part of their determynacion. Than he sent to Tourney
the chief men of war of all France / as therle of Ewe / the young earl of
Guynes his son constable of France / therle of Foytz / and his brethren /
therle Amery of Narbon / sir Aymer of Poyters / sir Geffray of Charney / sir
Gararde of Mountfaucon the two marshals / sir Robert Bertrand / and sir Mathue
de Troy / the lord of Caieur / the senesshall of Poyctou / the lord of
Chastelayn / and sir John^ of Landas: and these had with them valyant knights
and squyers. They came to Tourney: and found there sir Godmar du Fay / who was
there before. Than they took regard to the prouisyon of the town as well to
the vytels / as to thartyllerie: and forti ficatyon / and they causen to be
brought out of the country there about: where / otes / and other prouysion.
Now let us return to y^ king of England: when the time aproched that he and
his alyes should mete before Tourney and that the corn began to ripe: he
departed fro Gaunt with.vii. earls of his country.viii. prelates xxviii.
baronettes ii. C. knyghteses four thousand men of arms / and. (...). M.
archers beside fotemen. All his host passed through y^ town of Andwarpe / and
so passed the ^^uer of ^escalt and lodged before Tourney / at the gate called
saint Martyne / the way to ^arde Lysle and Doway. Than anon after came the
duke of Brabant with mo than. x^. M. men / knights / squyers / and commons:
and he lodged at the brige of Aryes by the river of Lescalt: between thabbey of
saint Nycholas / and the gate Uale^ tenoys. Next to him came therle of
Heynaultes with a gooly company of his country / with many of Holande / and
zelande: and he was loged between the kyuge and the duke of Brabaunt. Than came
Jaques Dartuell with mo tha^. l^. thousand slemmynges / beside them of ^pre /
Dropingne / Cassell / Bergues: and they were sent on the other side / as ye
shall here after. Jaques Dartuell lodged at the gate saint Fountain / y^ duke
of Guerles / therse of Jullers / the marquis of Bla^queboure / y^ marquis of
musse therle of Mons / therle of Sauynes / the lord of Falquemount / sir
Arnolde of Baquechew and all the Almayns were lodged on the other side toward
Heynalt. Thus the city of Tourney was cnuyroned rounbe about / and every host
might resort each to other: so that none could issue out without spyeug.

How therle of Heynalt (...)yed the towns of S(...)ne / and Dorchyes. Cap.
liiii.
THe sige enduring they without were well provided of vytels and at a metely pri
ce for it came to them fro all parts. On a morning the earl of Heynalt
with.v. hundred speres / departed fro the host and passed by Lysle / and brent
the good town of Seclyne and many vyllages there about: and their currours
ran to the subarbes of Lens in Artoyse. And after that the earl took an other
way / and rode to the town of Durchies: the which was taken and brent / for
it was nar closed: and also they burnt Landas / Ly(...) and diverse other good
towns there about / and over ran the country and gate great ^yllage. And
than returned again to the host (...) Turney: also the flemynges often times
assay led them of Tourney / and had made ships / belsroys / and instruments
of assaut: so that every day lightly there was skirmysshyng and diverse hurt /
of one and other. The stemmynges took much pain to trouble them of Tourney*
among other assautes there was one endured at a day there was many feats of
arms done for all the lords and knights that were in Tournay were thereat:
for thassaut was made in ships and vessels wrought for the same intent / to
have broken the baryers and the posterne of the arche. But it was so well
defended / that the sle^mynges wanne nothing: there they lost a shypp^ with a
sixscore men the which were drowned / and at night they withdrue right sore
traueyled. (...) so this siege enduryng / the soudyours of sayut Amandeyssued
out and came to Hanon in Heynalt / and burnt the town and vyolated the abbey /
and dystroyed the mynster / and carried away all that they might to saint Amande
/ and an other time y^ same french soudyours passed the wood of saint Amande /
and came to the abbey of Uycongue and made a great fire at the gate to have
burnt it. When thabbot saw what parell his house was in / hastily he took his
horse and rode out privily through the wood and came to Ualencennes / desyring
the provost there to lend him a certain crosbowes. And whan^e he had his desire
/ he brought the^ behind Rames and set them in the wood toward the high way
to procelet. And there they shot against the genowayes and frenchmen / being
before the gate of Uycongne: and when they saw and felt y^ quarrels light among
them coming fro the wood they were a frayed / and returned as fast as they
might: and so the abbey was saved.

How the scotts wan again great part of Scotland / while the siege was before
Tourney. Cap. lv.
How it is to be remembered how sir Wyllyam Duglas son of Wyllm^ Duglas
brother: who dyed in Spain. And therle of Patris / therle of Surlant / sir
Robert of Herssey / sir Symonde Fresyell / and Alysander Ramsey: they were
captayns in such part of Scotland as was left vnwonne by thenglysshmen. And
they had co^tynued in the forest of Good0urs ye space of.vii. year winter and
somer / and as they might they made war against thenglysshmen being there in
garyson. Sometime they had good adventure / and sometime yuell: and while the
king of England was at siege before Tourney. The french king sent men of war
into Scotland and they arrived at saint Joha^ns town / and they desired the
scotts in the french kings name / that they would set on and make such war
in the realm of England: that the king might be feign to return home to
rescue his own realm / and to leave up the sige at Tourney / and the french
king promised the^ men and money to aid them so to do. And so the scotts
departed out of the forest of Gedeours and passed thorough Scotland / and
wanne again diverse fortresses: and so past the town of Berwyke and the river
of Tyne / and entered into the country of Northumberlande / the which sometime
was a realm. There they found great plenty of beestes / and wasted and brent
all the country to Durame: than they returned by an other way dystroyeng the
country. In this voyage they distroyed more than three days journey into the
realm of England / and than^e returned into Scotland: and conquered again
all the fortresses that were holden by the englysshmen except the cite of
Berwyke and three other castles / the which did them great trouble. They were so
strong that it would have been hard to have found any such in any country:
the one was Strumelyn / an other Rosbourg / and the third the chyefe of all
Scotland Edenborowe. The which castle stands on a high rock / that a man
must rest ones or twyse or he so^e to the highest of the hill: and captain there
was sir Water Lymosen / who before had so valiantly kept the castle of Thine
against the frenchmen. So it was that sir Wyllyam Duglas devised a feate and
dyscouerd his intencyon to his co^panyons to therle Patris / to sir Robert
Fresyell / and to Alysander Ramsay: and all they agreed together. Tha^ they took
a.ii. C. of the wild scotts and entered into the sea: and made prouisyon of
otes mele / coals / and wood: and so pesably they arrived at a port / nere to
the castelll of Edenbo row. And in the night they armed them / and took a.x.
or.xii. of their company such as they did trust best: and did disgyse them
in poor torn cotes / and hattes like poor men of the country. And charged
a.xii. small horses with sackes some with otes / some with where mele / and
some with coals: and they did set all their company in a busshment / in an
old distroyed abbey there by / nere to the foot of the hill. And when ye day
began to apere / covertly armed as they were: they went up the hill with their
marchandyse. And when they were in the mydde way: ser Wyllyam Duglas and sir
Symode Fresyll disgysed as they were / went a little before and came to the
porter (and said) sir in great fere we have brought hither otes / and whetemele:
and if ye have any need thereof / we woll sell it to you good chepe. Mary said
the porter and we have need thereof: but it is so erly that I darre not a wake
the captain / nor his stuarde: but let them so^e in and I shall opyn the utter
gate. And so they all entered into the gate of the bayles: sir Wyllm^ Duglas
saw well how the porter had the keys in his hands of the great gate of the
castle.

Than when the first gate was opynned / as ye have hard: their horses with
caryages entered in: and the two that came last laden with coals / they made
them to fall down on the grounsyll of the gate / to thentent that the gate
should not be closed again. And than they took the porter and slew him so
pesably: that he neuerr spoke word / than they took the great keys and opynned
the castle gate / than sir Wyllyam Duglas blewe a horn and did cast away
their torn cotes / and laid all the other sackes ouerthwarte the gate / to
thyntent that it should not be shytte again. And when they of the busshment
hard the horn: in all have they might they mounted the hill. Than the
watchmen of the castle with noise of the horn a woke / and saw how the people
were coming all armed to the castle ward. Than he blewe his horn and cried
treason treson: sirs a rise and arm you shortly for yonder be men of arms
aprochynge to your fortress: than every man arose and armed them and ca^e to
the gate: but sir Wyllyam Duglas and his.xii. companyons defended so the gate
that they could not close it. And so by great valyantnesse they kept thentre
opyn / till their busshment ca^e they within defended the castle / as well as
they might and hurt diverse of them without: but ser Wyllyam and the scotts did
somoch that they conquered the fortress / and all the englyssmen within
slain: except the captain and sire other squyers. So the scotts tarried there
all that day / and made a knight of the country captayn there called Symo^de
Uessey / and with him diverse other of the country: these tidings came to the
king of England before Tourney.

Of the great host that the french king assembled to raise the siege before
Tourney. Cap. lvi.
VE have hard before how the king of England had besieged the cite of
Tourney / with mo than sixscore thousand men of arms with the flemmynge. And
because the vytayles within the city began to mynisshe: the french lords
within caused to a uoyde out of the town / all manner of poor people such as
were not furnysshed to abyue the adventure of the siege. They were put out in
the opynne day: and they passed through the duke of Braba^tes host / who
showed their grefe / for he caused them to besafely brought to the french
host at Aras / where as the king lay. And there he made a great assemble of men
of his own country / and part out of the empire. Thither came to him the king
of Behaygne / the duke of Loraygne / therle of Bare / the bishop of Mets and
of Coerdune / therle of Mountbelieu / sir John^ of Chalon / the earl of Geuyne
/ the earl of Sauoy / and the lord Jews of Sauoy his brother. All these
lords came to serve the french king with all their powers. Also thither came
the duke of Bretaygne / the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Borbone / therle of
Alanson / therle of Flanders / therle Forestes / therle Arminacke therle of
Bloyes / sir Charles of Bloyes / therle of Harcourt / therle Da^martyn / the
lord Coucy: and diverse other lords and knights. And after came the king of
Nauarr / with a goodly no^bre of men a war out of the country in France /
that he held of the french king / and thereby he ca^e to serve him. Also there
was the king of scotts / with a certain no^bre appointed to him.

How the soudyers of the garyson of Bohayne / dystrussed certain soudyers of
Mortayne before the town of Conde. Ca. lvii.
When all these said lords were come to Aras to the french king / than he
remeuyd and came to a little ryuerr a three leages fro Turney the water was deep
/ and round about full of marysshes / so that no man could pass but by a
little way / so narowe that two horses could not pass a front. There the king
lay and passed not the river: for he durst not. The next day the hoostes lay
still / some of the lords counsayled to make bridges to pass over the water
at their ease: than there wey men sent to advise the passage. And when they had
well aduysed every thing / they thought it was but a lost labor and so they
showed the king / how that there was no passage but at the brige of Cressyn.
Thus the matter abode in the same case: the tidings anon spread abroad how the
french king was lodged between the bridge of Cressyn and the bridge of Bonnes /
to thentent to fight with his ennemies. So that all manner of people such as
desired honor / d^ue to the one part and to the other / as they owed their
service or favor There were three Almayns brethren in Bouhaygne: when they
hard how these two kings aproched nere together be like lyhode to fight /
than two of the^ desired the. (...). to abide still and keep ye fortres / and
they said they would go and se what chere there was before Tourney. So these
two knyght^^ de^te^ one of the^ was called sir Courrat Dastra / and the other
sir Courrat Lancenuch / and they rode till they came to Escampons beside
Ualenc^s thinkyng to pass the river of Lescalt at Conde And between Fresnes /
and Escampons / they hard a great brunt of men and saw how some came fleyng
to themwarde. The two brethren had with the^ to the nombre of.xxv. spears and
they encountered the first / and demanded what they ayled / so to fle away. In
the name of god sir (...) they / the soudyers of Mortayne aryssued out and they
have get a great pray / and are going therewith toward their fortress / and
also have taken diverse prisoners of this country. Tha^ the two brethren said
/ sirs can ye led us there as they be: and they said yes. And so they went
after the frenchmen by the gyding of those poor men / and the frenchmen were
as than nere to our lady in the wood / and were a sixscore soudyers / and drove
before them. C. great beestes / and certain prisoners of the men of the
country. And their captain was a knight of Burgone called John^ de Frelays /
perteyninge to the lord of Beauieuu: as soon as the almayns saw them they
ascryed them and ran in fiersly among the^ there was a sore fight: the Burgonyon
knight did put himself to defense / and some of his company but not all / for
there were diverse that sted But they were so nere chased / what with the almayns
* and with the men of the country / that there escaped but a few other slain
or taken: sir John^ de Frelays was taken / and all y^ pray rescued and rendered
again to the men of the country. And after that adventure / the almayns ca^e
before Tourney where they were welcome.

Of the journey that sir wyllm^ Baylleull and sir Ualflart de la Croyse made at
the bridge of Cressyn. Cap. lviii.
A None after the french king was lodged thus at the bridge of Bouues / a
company of heinous by the setting on of sir Wyllm^ Bayllule and y^ lord
Uauflart de la croyse who said how they knew all the country / and that they
would bring them into such a place on the french host / y^ they should have
some winning. And so on a morning they departed fro thoost about sirscore
co^panyons knights and squyers: and they rode toward Don't de Cressyn / and
made the lord Bayllule to be as chief / and that to his baner every man should
draw. Now the same morning rode forth certain no^bre of y^ legoys of the
french party / whereof ser Robert de Baylleull brother to the foresaid sir
Wyllm^ Baylleull was chief captayn. So there were two brethren on diverse
parties: the lyegois had passed the bride of Cressyn / and were a foragyng for
their horses / and to se if they could find any adventure profitable for them.
The heynowes rode all that morning without fyndyng of any adventure / and they
also passed the bridge: there was such a mist that a man could not se y^ length
of a spear before him. And when the heinous were all over: than they ordained
that sir Wyllm^ Baylluell with his baner should abide on the bridge / and sir
Uauflart / sir Raflet de Monceaur / and sir John^ de Uerchyne should adventure
on farther. And so they went so far that they dasshed in to thoost of y^ king
of Behayne and the bysshopp^ of Liege / for they were lodged nere to the bridge
/ and the lord of Rademache had made watch the same night / and it was at the
point of his depertyng. So between them there was a sore conflict / how beit
finally the heinous drue back toward y^ brige: and the liegoys / and
luce^bourzins followed the^ and sir Wyllm^ Baylluell was counseled to repasse
again the bridge with his baner / for they had diverse of their company to
repasse. So the heinous repassed again as well as they might and in their
passing there were many deeds of arms done / in taking and rescuyng again.
So it fortuned* that sir Uauflart could not repasse the brige / and so was
feign to save himself as well as he might: he issued out of the preace and took
away that he knew well / and so entered in to the marshes among busshes and
rocks / and there tarried. The other fought still at the brige and there the
liegoys overcame ser Wyllm^ Baylleuls company. And therewith / sir Robert
Baylleull when he hard that noise in that part / he ca^e rynning thither with
his baner before him / and when the heynowes saw the baner of moraynes / they
byleued it had been the baner of sir Wyllm^ Bayllule and drue thither / for there
was but a small dyffere^ce between their baners / for the arms of morians be
bars counterbarres two cheurons gowles: and in the cheuron of ser Robert
Baylleull there was a little cross gold which y^ heinous took no head of.
Whereby they were disconfyted: and slain John^ de Uergny sir water du Pont de
large sir Wyllm^ of Pype^ poix / and diverse other: and taken sir John^ de Soyre
/ sir Danyell de Bleze: sir Race de Mo^ceaur / sir Loys Dampelen / and diverse
other: and sir Wyllm^ de Baylleul escaped as well as he might / but he lost much
of his company * ser Uauflart de la Croyse / who was in the marysshe trustyng
to have been there till it had been night / and so to have escaped / was spyed by
some that rode a long by the marese. And they made such an out cry on him /
that he ca^e out and yielded him self prisoner / they took and brought him to
the host and delivered him to their master / who would gladly have saved hi^:
for he knew well he was in ieopardy of his life. Anon tidings of him was
brought to the french king / who in co^tynent did send for him: and the king
immediately sent him to Lyle / because he had done to the^ much damage. And so
win the town they did put him to death / they would in no wise have pity of him
nor put him to any ransom.

How therle of Heynault assailed the fortress of Mortayne in Picardy by
diverse manners. Cap. lix.
OF this deed that sir Robert Bayllieull had done: y^ french king was right
ioyouse. And within a season after / the earl of Heynault / sir John^ his uncle
/ and the seen shall of Heynalt: with a.vi. hundred spears / heynowes / and
almayns / departed fro the siege of Turney. And therle sent to them of
Ualence^s * that they should come and mete with him before Mortayne: and to
come between Lescharpe / and Lescault to assail Mortayne: and they came thither
in great array and brought with them great engyus. The lord of Beauieu who was
captain within Mortayn greatly douted assautyng / because the fortress stood
nere to the river / and nere to Heynault as on all parties: therefore he
caused.xii. C. pyles to be driven in the river / to thyntent that no passage
should be that way. Howbeit for all that y^ earl of Heynault / and the heinous
came thither on the one side / and they of Ualencens on the other part And
inco^tynent they made an assaut and aproched the barrers / but there were such
deep trenches that they could not come nere / than some aduysed to pass the
river of Lescharpe / and so to come on the side toward saint Amand and to make
an assaut at the gate toward maulde And as they devised: a four hundred passed
y^ river / so than Mortayne was closed in three pertes / the wekyst side was
toward Mauld / howbeit there was strength enough. To that part came the lord
Beauieu himself to defend it / for he feared none of the other sides / he had
in his hand a great glaue / sharp and well ^^elyd and above the blade there
was a sharp hoke of stele / y^ when he gave his stroke the hoke should take
hold. And look on whom that it fastened he came to him / or else fell in the
water: by that means the same day he cast into the water mo than.xii. At that
gate the assant was feresyst / y^ earl of Heynalt who was on y^ othersyde knew
nothing of that assaut / he was araynged alo^ge the river side of Lescault /
and devised how they might get out of the river the pyles byforce or by
subtyltie / for than they might come just to the walls. They ordained to make
a shypp / and a great engyn to draw out the pyles each one after other / their
carpenters were set a warke and the engyn made in a ship / and the same day
they of Ualencens raised on their side a great engyn and did cast in stones so
that it fore troubled them within. Thus y^ first day passed and the night in
assayling and deuysing how they might grieve them in the fortress / the next
day they went to assaut on all parts / and the third day the shypp^ was ready
/ and thengyn to draw out y^ pyles. And than did set awarke to draw them out
/ but there were so many and such labor in the doing or they could draw out
one / that they were weary of that craft: and the lords would they had never
begone it / and so commanded to cease their warke. On y^ other part within
Mortayne / there was a connyng master in making of engyns / who saw well how
thengyn of Ualencens did greatly grieve them / he raised an engyn in y^ castle
/ the which was not very great but he trymmed it to a point. And he cast
therewith but three times / the first stone fell a.xii. foot fro thengyn without
/ the second fell nerer / and the third stone hit so even that it brake clean
a sonder the shaft of thengyn without. Than the so^dyers of Mortaygne made a
great shout: so thus the heinous could get nothing there / than therle said how
he would wtdrawe and go again to the siege of Tourney. And so they did / and
they of Ualencens returned to their town.

How therle of Heynault took the town of saint Amande / during the siege
before Tourney. Cap. lx.
A Three days after that therle of Heynault was returned fro Mortaygne / he
desired certain companyons to go to saint Amande / for he had diverse
complayntes how y^ soudyers of saint Amand had burnt thabbey of Hanon * and had
nere brent Uycoigne / and had done many dispytes to the fronters of Heynalt. So
therle departed fro the sige with a.iii. M. men and came before saint Amand /
on the side toward Mortayne. The town was not closed but with pales / and
captain there was a knight of La^guedoke the seneshall of Cracassone / who had
said to y^ monks of thabbey there and to them of the town / y^ it was not able
to hold against an host: how be it he said rather than he would depert he
would keep it to the best of his power / but that he said was in the manner of
counsel howbeit his words was not byleued. But long before the iuels of the
abbey were carried to Mortaygne for the more surety / and thither went the abbot
and all his monks / for they were no men of war. And they of Ualence^nes came
at therles commandment with a.xii. thousand men / and all y^ crosbo was kept
the gate to ward the bridge of Lesharpe / they began a ferse assaut and many
sore hurt on both parties. This assaut endured all the day: they of Ualencens
could get nothing there / they within scorned and mocked the^: and said sirs go
your way and drink your good ale And against night they of Ualencennes withbre
we right weary / and had great marueyle that they could here no tidings of
therle their lord and therefore they dysloged and drew toward their town: the
next morning be times / therle departed fro Turney / and came to saint Amand on
the side toward Mortayne: and inco^tyne^t they made assaute feers and cruel /
and wan at the first the bayles / and came to the gate to war de Mortaygne. And
there therle and his uncle made a great assaut and each of them had such a
stroke on the heed with stones / that their basenettes were cloven / and their
heedes sore astonyed. At last one said to therle: sir this way we shall never
enter / the way is strayet and strongly kept. But sir make great ra^mes of wood
like pyles / and let us run with them against the abbey walls / and we shall
peerse it through in diverse places / and if we get thabbey the town is ours.
Than therle commanded so to be done: and anon great peaces of timber were got
and made sharp before: and to every piece twenty or.xxx. persons / ronnyng
there with against the wall: so that they brake the wall in diverse places / and
valyantly entered there and passed a little river that ran within. And there was
ready the seneshall of Carcassone his baner before him: the which was goules a
sheffe syluerthre cheuorns in the sheffe bordred silver indented. And he and
his company defended valyantly the heynowes as long as they might: but their
defense could not avail for the heynowes were somany. And in their entryng into
thabbey: there was a monk called danne Frossart who did maruels / for he
killed and hurt at the hole there as he stood an. x^iii. so that none durst
enter in at that place: but finally he was feign to depart for he saw how the
henous entered into the abbey in diverse places. And so the monk saved himself
as well as he might / and went to Mortayne. When therle and his company were
entered into thabbey / he commanded yt all should be put to the sword they had
so sore dyspleased him / and done such hurt in his country. The town anon
was full of men of arms / and they with in chased and sought for / fro street
to street and in every house: so yt few escaped but all were slain The
seneshall was slain under his standarde and a.ii. C. men round about him /
and against night therle returned to Turney / the next day they of Ualencens
ca^e a gain to saint Amand and brent clean the town / and thabbey minster and
all / and brake all the belles the which were goodly. Another day therle again
deperted fro the siege with vi. C. men of arms / and went and brent Orchies /
La^das / and the Chell: and than passed by Hanon the river of Lesharpe / and
went into France to a great abbey and aryche called Marchienes / whereof sir
Amye of Uernaulx was captain / and with him certain crosbowes of Doway: there
therle made assaut for y^ captain had well fortifyed the first gate with
great deep dykes / and the frenchmen and monks there defended themself right
nobly / the heinous at last gate them botes and barges / and thereby entered into
thabbey: but there was a knight of Almayne drowned a co^panyon of the lord
Falquemont called sir Bacho de la Wire. Therle and his uncle and the seneshall
did at the gate so valyantly / that the gate was wone: and sir Amye and his
company slain or taken. And there were taken diverse monks and thabbey robbed
and brent and the town also: than therle returned to the siege before Tourney.

Of the taking of Charles Mo^morency / and diverse other frenchemen at the
bridge of Cressyn. Cap. lxi.
THis siege before Tourney was long and great: and the king of England supposed
ever to win it / for he knew well there were much people within and but scant
of vytayle. Wherefore he thought to famyssh them and some said they found
fomme courtesy in them of Brabaunt / in sufferynge vytayles to pass through
their host into the cite: and they of Brussels and Louane were sore weary with
taryeng there so long / and they desired the marshall of thost that they might
have leave to return into Braba^t. The marshall said he was well content: but
than they must leave all their harnes be hynde them / with the which answer
they were so a shamed that they never spoke thereof more. Now I shall show you
of a journey that ye almayns made at the same bridge of Cressyne: where as sir
Robert Bayllule dysconfited ye heynowes / as the lord of Raudero^de^ce and sir
John^ his son / John^ Raudebourg esquyer ser Arnold of Baquehen / sir Raynolde
Descouuenort / sir Rorrant / Dasto / sir Bastyen de Bastes / and Can drelyer
his brother / sir Strauren de Leurne: and diverse other of the duchy of Jullers
and of guerles. All these rode forth on a day / and also they had with them
certain bachellers of Heynalt: as sir Floren of Beauryon / sir Latas de la Hey
marshall of thoost / sir John^ of Heynalt / ser Oulphart of Guystels / sir
Robert Gleuues of therldome of Loz / and diverse other: they were a three C. they
came to the bridge of Cressyn / and passed without danger. Than they took
counsel what they should do / and it was thought most for their honor to go
and a wake the french host. There it was ordained that the lord Rauderondence
and his son / sir Henry of Keukren / sir Tylman of Sausey ser Olphart of
Guystels ser Lalema^t bastard of Heynalt Robert of Gleuues / and Jaquelat of
Tyaulx / should ride and suddenly dasshe into the french host. And the other
knights and squyers / to the nombre of three. C. should abide still at the
brige to keep ye passage. Thus these currours rode forth to the no^bre of
a.xl. speres till they came to thoost: and so dassht in and ouerthrue tents
and pauilyons / and skirmysshed with the frenchmen. The same night two great
barons of France had kept the wache that is to say the lord of Mo^morency /
and the lord of Salieu: and when they hard the noise / they came with their
baners to yt part. Than the almaynz returned toward the brige / and the
frenchmen after them feersly: and in the chase sir Olphart of Guystels was
taken / for he was purblynde: and also two brethren Mondrope and Jaquelet
Tyaulx they were so nere together that each of them understood others language.
And the frenmen said to the almayns: sirs ye shall not escape thus / than one
said to the lord of Raudero^de^ce sir take good head for me think the
frenchmen will be at the bridge or we / well said he though they know one way
/ I know an other. Tha^ he turned on the right hand: and took a way not
much used / the which brought him and his company to ye foresaid river / the
which was so deep and enuyroned with maresshes / that they coud not pass there
/ so that they were feign to repasse by the bridge / and the frenchemen ever
rode a great galoppe toward the bridge / and whau^e they came nere to the
brige / and saw that great busshment there / they said among themself / I
trow we chase folysshly / we might lightly lose rather than wyn. Than diverse
of them returned: and specially the lord of saint Saulie^^ with his baner and
his company / and the lord Charles of Mo^morency with his baner rode ever
forward and would not recule. And so with great courage set on the almayns /
at the first brunt there was a feerse encounter / and diverse over thrown on
both parties. Than ca^e in on the other side / the other almayns / and so enclosed
in the frenchmen: the lord Renolde of Dyscouuenort knew well the baner of the
lord Mommorency / who was under his banner with his sword in his hand
fightyng on every side / and so came suddenly on his right hand / and with his
lyfthande he took the bridell of the lord Mommorencies horse / and spurred
forth his own horse / and so drew him out of the battle. And ever the lord
Mommorency struck and gave him many great strokes / which some he received /
and some he defended. But finally there he was taken prisoner: so the almayns
did somoche that they obtained the place / and took a fourscore prisoners of
gentylmen: than they re passed the bridge without any danger. And so came
again to the siege before Tourney.

How the fle^mynges were before saint Omers during the siege. Cap. lxii.
NOw let us she we of au adventure that tell to the fle^mynges: of the which
company there were captayns sir Robert Dartoyse / and sir Henry of Fla^ders /
they were in nombre a xl. M. what of the towns of Ippre / Propyngne / Messynes
/ Cassell and of the Catelayne of Bergus. All these fle^mynges lay in the vale
of Cassell in tents and pauylions to cou^tergaryson the french garysons / that
the french king had laid at saint Omers at (...) / at saint Uenaunt / and in
other towns and forteresses there about. And in saint Omers there was therle
dolphyne of Auuergne / the lord of kalengen / the lord of (...) Rocheforte /
the (...)nerse other knights of (...)syn. And (...) also many (...) out (...)
and brake down diverse houses / and robbed the^. The fray anon was known in
the town / and the lords within armed them and their company and issued out
at a another gate / they were a vi. baners and a.ii. C. men of arms and
a.vi..C. fotemen / and they came by a secret way on the flemmynges / who were
besy to rob and pyll the town of Arkes nere to saint Omers / there they were
spredde abroad without captain or good order. Than the frenchmen came on them
in good order of batell their bauers displayed cryeng Cleremont / the dolphyne
of Auuergne / wherewith the flemmynges were a basshed and beatyn down by hepes.
And the chase of them endured.ii. leages / and there were slain a.iiii. M.
and.viii. C. and a.iiii. C. taken prisoners and led to saint Omers / and
such as fled and escaped returned to the host / and showed their companyons
their adventure. And at last tidings thereof came to their captayns sir Robert
Dartoyse / and sir Henry of Fla^ders / who said it was well enployed / for they
went forth without commandment or captain: and the same night or it was
mydnight the flemynges lyeng in their tents a sleep suddenly generally among
the^ all there fell such a fear in their her tes that they rose in great haste
and with such pain yt they thought not to be dysloged time enough. They beat
down their own tents and pauilyons and trussed all their caryages / and so
fled away not abiding one for an other Without keeping of any right way. Wha^
these tidings came to their two captayns / they rose hastily and made great
fires / and took torches and mounted on their horses and so came to these
fle^mynges / and said sirs what ayleth you / do you want any thing / why do you
thus fly away / be you not well assured / return in the name of god / ye be
to blame thus to fly and no man chase you But for all their words / every man
fled the ne^t way to their own houses / and when these lords saw none
other remedy / they trussed all their harnes in waganes / and returned to the
host before Tourney / and the^ showed the adventure of the flemmynges: whereof
every man had marueyle / some said they were overcome with fantyses.

How the siege before Tourney was broken up by reason of a truse. Cap. lxiii.
THis siege endured a long season: the space of a.xi. wekes three days less /
and all that season the lady Jane of Ualoys suster to the french king / and
mother to therle of Heynalt traueyled greatly what on the one pert and on
the other to have a respyte and a peace by twene the parties / so that they might
depart without battle. And diverse times she kneled at ye ^ete of the french
king in that behalf: and also made great labor to the lords of thempyre /
and specially to the duke of Brabant and to ye duke of Jullers / who had her
dought in marriage / and also to sir John^ of Heynalt. Somoch the good lady
procured with the aid and counsel of Loys Daugymont / who was well-beloved with
both perties: that it was granted yt each party should send four sufficyent
persons to treat on some good way to acorde the parties / and a truse for three
days. These apoynters should mete in a ly tell chapel standing in the feldes
called Esplotyn / at the day appointed these persons met: and the good lady
with them. Of the french party there was Charles king of Behayne^ Charles earl
Dalanson brother to the french king / and the bysshopp^ of Liege / therle of
Flanders / and therle of Armynack. Of the^glysshe party there was the duke of
Braba^t / the bishop of Licolne the duke of Guerles / the duke of Jullers /
and ser John^ of Heynalt. And when they were all met: they made each to other
great salutacyons and good there / and than entered into their treaty and all that
day they comuned on diverse ways of acorde / and always ye good lady of Ualoys
was among the^ desyringe effectuously all the parties / that they would do
their labor to make a peace / howbeit the first day passed without any thing
doing. and so they returned and promised to mete again ye next day: the
which day they came together again in the same place / and so fell again
into their treaty. And so fell unto certain points agreeable: but it was as
thanne so late that they could not put it in writynge as that day / and to make
an end: and to make perfyght the matter if they might. The third day they met
again and so finally acorded on a truse to endure for a year between all
parties / and all there men. And also between the^ that were in Scotland / and
all such as made war in Gascoyne / Poycton / and in Sa^ton. And this treuse
to begin the.xl. day next ensuyng / and within that space every party to give
knowledge to his men without mall engyn / and if such co^panyes woll not keep the
peace let the^ be at their chose. But as for France / Pycardy / Burgoyne /
Bretayne / and Normandy to be bound to this peace without any excepcyon: and
this peace to begin incontinent by twene the hosts of the two kings. Also it
was determined / that both parties in each of their names should send four
or five personages / as their embassodours and to mete at Arras / and the pope
in likwyse to send thither four: and there to make a full confirmacyon without
any mean. Also by this truse every party to enjoy and possede all and every
thing / that they were as than in possessyon of. This truse inco^tynent was
cried in both hoostes / whereof the brabances were right glad / for they were
sore weary with so long lyeng at the siege. So that ye next day as soon as it
was day light: ye should have seen tents taken down / charyotes charged / and
people remove so thycke / that a man would have thought to have seen a new
world. Thus the good town of Tourney was safe without any great damage: how
beit they within endured great pain / their vytaylsbegan to fail (for as it
was said) they had as than scant to serve the^ a three or four days at the
most. The brabances departed quickly / for they had great desire thereto: the
king of England departed sore against his mind / if he might have done other
wise / but in manerhe was feign to follow the wylles of the other lords / and
to believe their counsayls. And the french king could abide no lengar there as
he lay for the yuell air / and the wether hot. So the frenchmen had the
honor of that journey / because they had rescued Tourney / and caused their
ennemies to deperte. The king of England and the lords on his pertie said how
they had ye honor / by reason that they had tarried so long within the realm /
and besieged one of the good towns thereof / and also had wasted and burnt in
the french country / and that the french king had not rescued it in time and
hour as he ought to have done by gyuyng of battle / and finally agreed to a
truse / their ennemies being still at the siege and brennyng his country. Thus
these lords departed fro the siege of Tourney / and every man drew to his
own. The king of England came to Gaunt to the queen his wife / and shortly
after passed the sea and all his / except such as should be at the parlyament
at Arras. Cherle of Heynalt returned to his country / and held a noble feast
at Mons in Heynault / and a great iustes. In the which Gararde of Uerchyn
seneshall of Heynault did just and was so sore hurt / that he dyed of the
stroke / he had a son called Joha^n who was after a good knight and a hardy /
but he was but a while in good health. The french king gave leave to every man
to depart / and went himself to Lyle / and thither came they of Tourney. And
the king received them ioyously and did show them great grace / he gave the^
freely their franches ye which they had lost long before / wherwt they were
ioyouse / forsir Godmer du Fay and diverse other knights had been long
governors there: than they made new pro uost / and iurates acordynge to their
ancient vsages / than the king departed fro Lysle to go to Paris. Now than
came the season that the counsel should be at Arras / and for pope Clement
thither came in legacyon / the cardynall of Napuls / and the cardynall of
Cleremont: who came to Paris where as the king made them mochehonour / and so
came to Arras: for the french king there was therle of Alanson / the duke of
Burbon / therle of Flaunders / therle of Bloys / the archebysshoppe of Senes /
the bishop of Beawayes / and the bishop of Aucerre / and for the king of
England / there was the bishop of Lyncolne / the bishop of Durame / therle
of Warwyke / sir Robert Dartoyse / sir John^ of Heynalt / and sir Henry of
Flanders / at the which treaty there were many matters put forth / and so
continued a.xv. days and agreed of no point of effect / for thenglysshmen
demanded / and ye frenchmen would nothing give: but all only to render the
cou^tie of Poycton / the which was given with queen Isabell in marriage with the
king of England. So this parlyament brake up and nothing done / but the truse
to be relonged two years lengar / that was all that the cardynals could get.
Than every man departed / and the two cardynals went through Heynault at the
desire of therle / who feested the^ nobly.

Now speaks the history of the wars of Bretayne / and how the duke dyed
without heir / whereby the dyscencion fell. Cap. lxiiii.
When that this said trewse was agreed and sailed before the cite of Turney /
every lord and all manner of people dysloged and every man drue into his own
country. The duke of Bretayne / who had been there with y^ french king / as well
furnysshed as any other prince that was there / deperted hom ward: and in his
way a sickness took him / so that he dyed. At which time he had no child nor
had never noue by the duchies / nor had no trust to have / he had a brother by
the father side called earl of Mou^tfort / who was as than lyueyng: and he had
to his wife suster to therle Loyes of Flanders. This said duke had an other
brother both by father and mother who was as than deed: and he had a daughter
a live / and ye duke her uncle had married her to the lord Charles of Bloyes /
eldyst son of therle Guy of Bloyes: that the same earl had by the suster of
king Philypp^ of France. Who as than raygned and had promised with her in
marriage ye duchy of Bretayne after his dyscease / for he douted that the earl
Mountfort would claim the inherytance as next of blood / and yet he was not
his proper brother germayne. And the duke thought that the daughter of his
brother germayne ought by reason to be more nere to the Inherytaunce after his
dycease / than therle Mou^tfort his brother. And because he fered that after
his dycease therle of Mountfort would take away ye right fro his yongnese:
therefore he married her with the said sir Charles of Bloys / to thyntent that
king Philyp uncle to her housbande should aid to keep her right against therle
Mountfort / if he medyll any thing in ye matter. As Soon as the earl Mou^tfort
knew that the duke his brother was deed / he went inco^tynent to Nauntes: the
sovereign city of all Bretayne. And he did somoche to the burgesses / and to
the people of the country there about / yt he was received as their chief lord:
as most next of blood to his brother dysceased / and so did to him homage and
fealty. Than he and his wife / who had both the hertes of a lion: determined
with their counsel to call a court / and to keep a solemn feast at Nauntes
at a day lymitted / against ye which day they sent for all the nobles and
counsails of the good to wnes of Bretayne / to be there to do their homage and
fealte to him / as to their soueraygne lord. In the mean season or this feast
began: therle Mounfort with a great nombre of men a war deperted fro Nauntes /
and went to Lymogines: for he was informed that the tresur that his father had
gadered many a day before was there kept secret. When he came there he entered
into the cite with great tryumphe / and did him much honor: and was nobly
received of the burgesses / of the clergy / and of the commons: and they all
did him fealty / as to their soueraygne lord. And by such means as he
found: y^ great treasur was delyuerd to him / and when he had tarried there at
his pleasure / he deperted with all his treasur and came to Nauntes to the
cou^tes his wife. And so their they tarried in great joy till the day came of
the feast / and made great prouysio^s against the same. And when the day ca^e
and no man apered for no commandment / except one knight called sir Henry du
Leon / a noble and a puysaunt man. So they kept the feast a three days as well
as they might / with such as were there. Than it was determined to retain
soudyers a horsbacke and a foot / and so to dyspende his great tresure to
attain to his purpose of the duchy / and to constrayne all rebels to come to
mercy. So soudyers were retained on all sides and largely paid / so that they
had a great no^bre a foot and a horsbacke: nobles and other of diverse
countries.

How therle of Mountfort took the town and castle of Breast. Cap. lxv.
When therle of Mountfort / saw how he had people enough: than he was
cou^sayled to go and conquer all the co^tre outher by love or by force / and
to subdue all his rebels. Than he issued out of the city of Nau^tes with a
great host / and went to a strong castle standing on the sea side called
Breast: and captain therein was sir Garnyer of Clysson / a noble knight and one
of the grettest barownes in Bretayne. Therle Mountfort or he came to Breast / he
constrained so all the country except the fortresses / yt every man followed
him a horsbacke or a foot / none durst do none otherwise, when therle ca^e to
the castle of Breast he caused ser Henry de Leon to send to the captayn to
speak with him / mouyng him to obey to therle / as to the duke of Bretayne. The
knight answered he would do nothing after that mocyon till he had otherwise in
commandment / fro him yt ought to be lord there by right: and the next day
therle did assaut the castle. Within the castle were a.iii. C. men of arms.
and every man was set to his part of defense: and than the captayn took a xl.
good men of arms and came to the barryers: and so there was a sore assaut / and
diverse sore hurt. But finally there came so many assayla^tes / that the bayles
were won before / and the defe^dantes feign to return into the castle / at
a hard adventure for there were diverse slain / but the captain did so
valyantly that he brought his company into the chyefe gate. They that kept the
ward of the gate / when they saw that myschyefe / feared lesyng of the
castle: and suddenly they let down the portcolyse / and closed their own
capteyne and certain with him without who right nobly defended themself. They
were sore hurt and in great danger of death / and the captain would never yield
himself: they with in cast out stones / timber / iron / and pottes with quycke
lyme: so that the assaylantes were feign to draw back / than they drue up a
little of the portcolyse: and the captain entered and his company such as were
left a live with him sore wounded. The next day therle caused certain inge^s
to be raised: and said how that he would not depart thens / till he had the
castle at his pleasure. The third day he understood: how the captain within
was deed of such hurtes as he received before at entering into the castle /
and true it was. Than the duke Mountfort caused a great assaut to be made: and
had certain instruments made of timber / to cast over the dykes to come to
the hard walls / they within defended themself as well as they might till it
was noone. Than the duke desired the^ to yield and to take him for their duke /
and he would freely pardon them. Whereupon they took counsel: and the duke caused
the assaut to cease / and finally they yielded them / their lives and goods
saved: than therle of Mountfort entered into the castle with certain nombre /
and received the feaultie of all the men of that Chatelayne. And there he set
to be captain: a knight whom he trusted much / and than he returned to his
field right ioyouse.

How therle of Mountfort took the city of Renes. Cap. lxvi.
When the earl of Mountfort was returned to his field / and had stably s^hed
his captayns in the castle of Breast. Than^e he drew toward the cite of Renes
the which was not far thens: and every where as he went he made every man to
do him homage and feaulte as to their right lord / and daily increased his
host. So he came before Renes and pyght up his tents / and lodged his people
round about the cite / and in the subbarbes. They wtin made great semblant of
defense: capytaine there was sir Henry Pennefort / who was well beloved for his
treweth and valyantnesse / on a morning he yssned out with a two hundred men /
and dasshed into the host / and beat down tents and slew diverse such of
the host as had kept watch the same night drue to the noise. Than they of the
fortress withdrewe and fled again to their castle: but they tarried so
long / that diverse of them were taken and slain. And sir H(...)y of Pe^fort
was taken and brought to the earl / than the earl caused him to be brought
before the city / and to be showed to the burgesses / yt if they would save
his life to yield up the town / or else he should be hanged before the gates.
Than they of Renes took counsel the which enduredde long / for the commons
had great pity of their captain / and he was welbelored among them Also they
consydred how they had but small store of vytayle / long to defend the
siege: wherefore they said they would have peace. But the great burgesses^ who
had enough for theymselfe / would not agree to yield up the town. So that
their dyscorde multiplied so far / that the great burgesses / who were all of
one lynnage drew a part and said: sirs all that woll take our part draw to
us. So that there drew together of one affinyte and lynnage to the nombre of a
two thousand. And when the other commons saw that / they began to sterre and
said to the burgesses many evil and vylanous words / and finally ran together
and slew diverse of them. Than when the burgesses saw what myschefe they were
in they agreed to them / and said they would do as they desired. Tha^ ceased
the fray: and all the commons ran and opyned the gates / and yielded the city
to therle Mounfort and did homage and feaultie to him / and took him as their
lord: and so did sir Henry Pe^fort who was made of therles counsel.

How the earl Mountfort took the town and castle of Hanybout. Cap. lxvii.
THus therle of Mou^tfort entered ito Renes with great feast: and lodged his
host still in the feldes / and made the peace again by twene the burgesses and
the commons. Than he made there baylyffes / pronost / aldermen / sergyantes /
and other officers: and tarried there three days. Than he dyslodged: and drue
toward y^ stron gest castle in all Bretayn called Hanybout sta^dynge on a
port of the sea / and the sea rennynge round about in great dykes. When sir
Henry of ^e^fort saw how therle would go thither: he feared his brother who was
captayn there / than he ca^e to therle in counsel and said: sir it has pleased
you to admyt me as one of your counsaylours / and sir I have given you my faith
and allegiance. I understand ye purpose to go to Hanybout: sir know for
troth the town and the castle a^ of such strength / that they be not easy
to win: I think surely ye may well lose your time there a hole year / or ye
win it perforce. But sir if it will please you to believe me / I shall show
you the ways how to win it / whau^e force can not help subtylte and craft
must avail If ye will deliver me. (...). hundred men of arms to be rueled as
I woll have the^: I shall go with them half a leage before your host with ye
baner of Bretayn before me. And my brother who is governor of the castle and
of the town / as soon as he shall se the banner of Bretayne / and know that
it is I / he woll opyn the gates and let me enter and all my company. And
as soon as I am within I shall take him as prisoner / and take possessyon of the
town and gates: and I shall render my brother into your hands to do pour
pleasure with him / without he woll obey as I woll have him. So that ye promise
me by the faith of your body that ye shall do his person no bodily hurt: the
which request therle promised and said. If ye bring this about / I shall love
you the better ever after. Than sir Henry Penfort departed with his company
appointed / and against evening he came to Hanybout / and when his brother
Olyuer Pe^fort knew of his coming / he opyned the gates and let him enter
wenynge he had been come to have aided him: and so came and met his brother in
the street. As Soon as sir Henry saw him / he aproched to him and took him by
the arm / and said Olyuer ye army prisoner / how so quod he. I have put my
trust in you / thynkyng that ye were come hitherto aid me to keep this town
and castle. Brother quod sir Henry the matter gothe not so / I take possession
of this town for therle Mountfort / who is now duke of Bretayne: to whom I
have made fealty and homage / and the most part of the country has obeyed
unto him. And so shall you do in likewise / and it were better ye did it by love
than byforce: ye shall deserve the more thank. Somoche Olyuer was styred by
his brother that he agreed to him: and so therle entered and took possession of
the town and castle / and set there a great garrison. Than he went withal his
host to ^ennes and made such treaty with them / that they yielded up and did
fealty and homage to him / as to their soueraygne lord. And there he
stablysshed all manner of officers / and tarried there three days: and frothens he
went and laid siege to a strong castle called Roche Peron: captain therein was
ser Olyuer of Clysson cosyn germayne to y^ lord Clysson / and therle lay there
at siege.x. days / and could find no ways how to get the castle it was
so strong / and the captain would in no wise agree to obey / another for fair
words nor foul. So the earl left that siege and departed for that time / and
went and laid siege to an other castle a.x. leages thens called Aultoy: and
therein was captain sir Geffray Malestroyt / and in his company sir Juon of
Triguyde: therle assailed the castle two times / but he saw well he might
rather lose there / than win. Than he agreed to a truse for a day / at the
instance of sir Henry de Leon / who was ever still about him. So the treaty
took such effect that they were all friends: and the two knights did homage to
therle / and so departed and left still the same two knights to be captayns
there / and of the country there about. Thanne he went to an other castle
called Goy la Forest: and he that was captain there saw how therle had a
great host / and how the country was sore yielded to him / and so by y^
counsel of sir Henry de L^on with whom the captain had been in company in
Pruce / in Granade: and in diverse other strange contreis / he acorded with
therle and did him homage: and therle left him still captain there. Than therle
went to Caraches / a good town and a strong castle: and therein there was a
bishop / who was lord thereof. This prelate was uncle to sir Henry de Leon /
so that by sir Henris means / the bishop agreed with therle and took him as
his lord: unto such season as sum other should come and show more right to
the duchy of Bretaygne

How the eele Mountfort did homage to the king of England for the duchy of
Bretayne. Cap. lxviii.
THus therle Mou^tfort conquered the country and made himself to be called
duke of Bretayne. Than he went to a port on the sea side called G^e^o: thasie
he sent his people abroad to keep y^ towns and fortresses that he had won.
Than he took the sea with a certain with him: and so arrived in Cornwall in
England at a port called Chepse: than he enquered where the king was / and it
was showed him how ye he was at wyndsore. Than he rode thyderwarde and came to
Wyndsore / where he was received with great joy and feast / both of the king
and of the queen and of all the lords: than he showed the king and his
counsel how he was in possession of the duchy of Bretayne / fallen to him by
succession by y^ death of his brother last duke of Breten. But he feared lest
that sir Charles of Bloyes and the french king would put him out thereof by
puyssance / wherefore he said he was come thither to relyue and to hold the
duchy of the king of England by fealty and homage for ever: so that he would
defend him against the french king and all other that shul^e put him to any
trouble for the matter. The king of England ymagined that his war against
the french king should be well fortifyed by that means / and how that he
could not have no more profitable way for him to enter into France than by
Bretayne: remembering how the almayns and brabances had done little or nothing
for him / but caused him to spend much money. Wherefore ^^yously he
condyscending to therle Mountfortes desire: and there took homage by the hands
of therle calling him self duke of Bretaygne. And there the king of England in
the presence of such lords as were there / both of Bretayne and of England:
promised that he would aid / defend / and keep him as his liege man: against
every man / french king and other. This homage and promyses were written and
sealed / and every ^tie had his part belyuerd: beside y^ the king and y^ queen
gave to therle and to his company many great gifts: in such wise that they
reputed him for a noble king / and worthy to raygne in great prosperyte. Than
therle took his leave and departed and took again thesee and arrived at y^
foresaid port of Gredo in base Bretayne / and so came to Nauntes to his wife who
said how he had wrought by good and byscrete counsel.

How therle Mou^tfort was somoned to be at the plyament of Paris at the
request of the lord Charles of Bloyes. Cap. lxix.
When sir Charles of Bloys who held himself rightful inherytour to Bretaygne
by reason of his wife: hard how the earl of Mountfort conquered beforce the
country / the which by reason ought to be his. Than he came to Paris to
complain to king Philyppe his uncle: whereupon the king counseled with the
nobles of the realm what he might do in that matter / and it was counsaylled
him y^ therle Mou^tfort should be by sufficyent messa^gers somoned to apere at
Paris / and there to here what answer he would make. So these messa^gers were
sent forth: and they found therle at Nauntes making good chere / and he made
to them great feast / and finally he answered how he would obey the kings
commandment. And than made him ready and departed fro Nantes and so came to
Paris with a.iiii. C. horse with him: and the next day he and all his / mounted
on their horses and rode to the kings palayse. There the king and his.xii.
peers with other great lords of France tarried his coming / and the lord
Charles of Blois with the. Than therle entered into the kings chamber: he was
well regarded and saluted of every person / tha^ he enclyned himself to the
king (and said) sir I am come hither at your commandment and pleasure. Than
the king said / earl of Mountfort for your so doing I can you good thank /
howbeit I have marueyle: how that ye durst undertake on you the duchy of
Bretayne wherein ye have no right / for there is another ne^e^ than ye be / and
ye would dysinheryt him: and to mentayne your quarrel / ye have been with mine
adversary the king of England / and as it is showed me ye have done him
homage for the saine. Than ther^e said sir believe it not: for surely ye at but
yuell informed in that behalf / but ser as for the right that ye speak of
saving your dyspleasur ye do me there(...) wrong / for ser I know none so nere
to my brother / that is departed as I* if it were iuged or plainly declared by
right that the^ were a another nerer than I / I would ^at be rebel nor a shamed
to leave it. Well sir quod the king ye say well: but I command you in all that
ye hold of me / that ye depert not out of this city of Paris this.xv. days /
by the which time the.xii. peers and lords of my realm shall judge this matter
/ and tha^ye shall know what right ye have: and if ye do otherwise ye shall
displease me. Than therle said: ser all shall be at yo^ pleasure / than^e he went
fro the court to his lodgyng to dinner / when he came to his lodging he entered
into his chamber / and the^ satte and ymagined many doutes: and finally with a
small company he mounted on his horse and returned again into Bretayne / or
the king or any other wist where he was beco^e. Some thought he had been but a
little sick in his lodgyng: and when he came to Nauntes he showed the
countess what he had done / and than by her counsel herod to all the towns
and forteresses that he had won: and stablysshed in them good captayns and
soudyers a horsbacke and a foot / and did give them good wages.

How the duchy of Bretayne was iuged to sir Charles of Bloyes. Can. lxx.
IT is to be thought that the french king was sore dyspleased: when he knew
that the earl of Mountforte was so departed. How beit he tarried till ye.xv. day
that the lords should give their judgment on the duchy of Bretayne / when the
day came they judged it clearly to ser Charles of Bloys wife: who was daughter
to the brother germayne of the duke last deed by y^ father side whom they
judged to have more right than the earl Mountforte who came by another father /
who was never duke of Bretayne. In other reason the^ was: they said though
that therle of Mou^tfort had any right / he had forfeted it two ways. The one
because he had relyued the duchy of a another lord than of the french king /
of whom he ought to hold it. The other reason was because he had broken the
kings commandment: and disobeyed his a rest and prison / as in going away
without leave. When this judgment was given in plain audyence by all y^
lords: thanne the king called to him the lord Charles of Bloys his nephue /
and said fair nephue ye have judged to you a fair heritage and a great.
Therefore have you and go and conquer it against him that kepyth it wrongfully
/ and desire all your friends to aid you: and I shall not fail you for my
part / I shall lend you gold and silver enough: and shall command my son
the duke of Normandy to go with you. Than ser Charles of Bloys inclyned him to
his uncle / thankyng him right humbly: than he desired y^ duke of Normandy his
cosyn / the earl of Alanson his uncle / the duke of Burgoyne / therle of Bloys
his brother / the duke of Butbone / the lord Loys of Spain / y^ lord Jaques
of Burbon / therle of Ewe constable of France / and therle of Guynes his
son: the vycont of Rohayne / and all the other lords that were there. And all
they said how they would gladly go with him / and with their lord the duke
of Normandy. Than these lords departed to make them ready / and to make
prouysion against that journey.

The lords of France that entered into Bretayne with sir Charles of Bloys.
Cap. lxxi.
When all these lords of Normandy: the duke of Alanson / the duke of Burgoyne
/ and all other such as should go with sir Chardu Bloys / to aid him to
co^quere the duchy of Bretayne were ready. They departed some fro Pares and some
fro other places / and they assembled together at the city of Angers: and fro
thens they went to Ancennys / the which is the end of the realm on that side /
and there tarried a three days: than they went forth into the country of
Bretayne / and when they were in the feldes / they nombred their company to a
fine thousand men of arms beside the ge no ways / the which were a three
thousand / and three knights of Gennes oyd led the^. The one called sir Oaths
de Rue / and the other sir Charles Germaulx: and beside that they had many
erosbowes / of whom sir Galoys be la Baulme was captain. Than all these went
to a strong castle standing on a high mountain called Chasto^ceaulx there
was thentre of Bretayne / it was furnysshed with men of war: and captayns there
were two knights of Lorayne called sir Gyles / and sir Ualeryan. The lords of
France took counsel to besiege this castle: for they thought if they should
leave such a fortres behind them / it should do them great damage. So they
beseged it round about / and made many assautes / specially the genowayes
did what they might to attain praise at the beginning: but they lost often
times of their company / for they within defended themself so sagely that it
was long or they took any damage. But finally the assaylantes brought thither
somoch tymbre / wod and fagottes / that they filled therewith the dykes: so that
they might go ^ust to y^ walls / they within cast out stones / chalk / and
brennynge fire: howbeit they without came to y^ foot of the walls / and had
instrumetes whereby they might under covert mine the walls. Than they with in
yielded up the castle / their lives and goods saved: thafie the duke of
Normanvy who was chief there / delivered the castle to sir Charles of Bloys as
his own / who inco^tynent set there a good garyson to keep thentre: and to
conduct such as came after them. Than they went toward Nantes: where as they
hard how therle of Mountfort their ennemy was / the marshals and currours of
their host / found by the way as they went a good town closed with ^ykes /
the which they feersly assailed: and in the town there were but few people / and
yuell armed. So that anon the town was wo^ / robbed / and the one half brent:
and all the people put to y^ sword / this town was called Carquesy: within
a.iiii. or five leages to Nantes. The lords lay there about all that night / y^
next morning they drue toward Nantes and laid siege round about it / and
pygh^^p their tents and pauilyons. Than the men of war within the town and
the burgesses armed the^ / and went to their defenses as they were appointed:
some of the host went to y^ barrers to skirmyssh / and some of the soudyers
within and young buegesses y^^ue^ out against them / so that there were byuees
slain and hurt on both parties / there were ^yuerse such skirmysshes. On a
morning some of the soudyers within the city issued out at adventure / and
they found a.xv. carts with vytell coming to thoost ward / and a.lx.
persons to co^uey it: and they of the city were a.ii. C. They set on them and
anon dysconfyted them and slew diverse and some fled away and escaped / and
showed in thoost how it was. Than some went to rescue the pray: and over took
them nere to the barryers / there began a great skirmysshe / there came so many
fro thoost that they within had much a do: howbeit they took the horses out of
the carts and did drive them in at the gate / to thentent (...) they without
should not drive lightly away the caryages. Than other soudyers of the city
issued out to help their companyons: and also of the burgesses to aid their
pare^tes / so the fray multiplied and diverse were slain and sore hurt on both
parties: for always people increased fro thoost / and some new ever issued
out of the city. Than at last sir Henry the captain saw that it was time to
retreyt: for by his abydinge he saw he might rather lose than wyn / than he
caused them of the city to draw a back as well as he might / yet they were
pursued so ^ere that many were slain and taken / mo than.ii. C. of the
burgesses of y^ town. whereof therle of Mo^tfort blamed sore sir Henry de Leon
/ that he caused the retrayt so sone: wherewith sir Henry was sore dyspleased in
his mind. And after that he ^old no more come to therls counsel so aften as
he did before: many had marvel why he did so.

How the earl Mountfort was taken at Nauntes and how he dyed. Cap. lxxii.
AS I hard reported there were certain burgesses of y^ cite saw how their
goods went to wast both without and ^in / and had of their children and
friends in prison and douted that wors should come to them after: than they
aduysed and spoke together secretly / so that finally they concluded to treat
with the lords of France. So y^ they might come to have peace and to have
their children and fre^des clearly delyuerd out of prison. They made this
treaty so secretly: that at last it was agreed that they should have all the
prosouers delyuerd / and they to set opyn one of ye gates that the french
lords might enter / to take the earl Mou^tfort in the castle / without doing
of any manner of hurt to the cite / or to thynhaby tantes or goods therein. Some
said this was purchased by the means and agreement of sir Henry de Leon / who
had been before one of the earls chief counsaylours. Thus as it was devised /
so it was done in a morning: the french lords entered and went straight to y^
castle and brake opyn the gates / and there took therle Mou^tfort prisoner and
led him clean out of the city into their field / without doing of any more
hurt in the cite. This was the year of our lord god M. C C C.xli. about the
feast of all saynt^. Tha^ the lords of France entered into the city with
great joy: and all the burgesses and other did fealty and homage to the lord
Charles of Bloys as to their right sovereign lord / and there they tarried a
three days in great feast. Than sir Charles of Bloys was cou^selled to abide
there about the city of Nauntes till the next somer / and so he did: and set
captayns in such garysons as he had won / than the other lords went to Paris
to the king / and delyuerd him therle of Mountfort as prisoner. The king set
him in the castle of Loure where as he was long / I at last as I hard
reported there he dyed.

Now let us speak of the countess his wife / who had the courage of a man /
and the heart of a lion. She was in the city of Renes when her lord was
taken: and how beit that she had great sorrow at her heart / yet she valyantly
reco^forted her friends and soudyers / and showed them a little son that she
had called John^ / and said a sirs be not to sore a basshed of the earl my
lord whom we have lost (he was but a man) se here my little child who shall be
by the grace of god his restorer / and he shall do for you all and I have
riches enough ye shall not lack: and I trust I shall purchase for such a
captain / that ye shall be all reconforted. When she had thus conforted her
friends and soudyers in Renes / than she went to all her other fortresses and
good towns / and led ever with her John^ her young son: and did to the^ as
she did at Renes and fortifyed all her garrisons of every thing y^ they wanted:
and paid largely and gave freely where as she thought it well enployed. Than
she went to Hanybout / and there she and her son tarried all that winter /
often times she sent to byset her garysons / and paid every man full well and
truly their wages.

How the king of England / the third time made war on the scotes. Cap.
lxxiii.
YE have hard here before yt the siege being before Tourney / how the lords
of Scotland had taken again diverse towns and fortresses fro thenglysshmen /
such as they held in Scotland. There were no mo remaining in the^glysshmens
hands but only the castle of Esturmelyne / the city of Berwyke / and
Rousburge. And the scotts lay still at siege with certain frenchmen with them
such as king Philyppe had sent thither to help the^ before Esturmelyne: and
they within were so sore constrained y^ they saw well they could not long
endure. And when the king of England was returned fro the siege of Tourney
and came into his own realm / he was cou^selled to ride toward scotland and
so he did / he rode thyderwarde between mighelmas and al saints / co^maundyng
every man to follow him to Berwyke / than every man began to stir: and to
draw thither as they were commanded. The king at last came to york / and there
tarried for his people: the lords of Scotland were enfourmed of the coming of
the king of England / wherefore they made sorer assautes to the castle of
Esturmelyne / and constrained so them within / with engyns and canons that they
were feign to yield up the castle / saving their lives and members: but nothing
they should carry away. These tidings came to the king of England where as he
was / than^e he departed and drew toward Esturmelyne and came to Newcastell
upon Tyne: and there lodged and tarried more than a month abydinge prouysion for
his host / the which was put on the sea between saint Andrews tide and All
saints: but diverse of their ships were perysshed / for they had such
tempest on the sea / that small prouysion came thither. Some were driven into
Hollande and into Fryse / whereby the^glysshe host had great defaute of vytayls
and every thing was dear / and winter at hand. So that they wist not where to
have forage: and in scotland the scotts had put all their goods into
fortresses / and the king of England had there mo tha^ vi. M. horsemen / and.xl.
M. fotemen. The lords of Scotland after their wynning of Estur melyne they
^rue into the forestes of Gedeours and they understood well how the king of
England lay at Newecastell with a great nombre / to brenne and to exyle the
realm of Scotland. Than they took counsel what they should do: they thought
themself to small a company to mentayne the war / seeing how they had
co^tynued the wars more than.vii. year / without heed or captain. And yet as
tha^ they could parceyue no socoure fro their own king: than they determined
to send to the king of England a bishop and an abbot to desire a truse / the
which messangers departed fro Scotland / and came to Newecastell where they
found the king. These messangers showed to the king and to his counsel the
cause of their coming: so than it was agreed a trewse to endure four months
/ on the condycion that they of Scotland should send sufficyent ambassadors
into France to king Dauyd: yt without he would come within the month of May
next following so puyssantly as to resyst and defend his realm else they
clearly to yield themself english and never to take him more for their king.
So thus these two prelates returned again into Scotland / and incontinent
they ordained to send into France / sir Robert ^ersay / and sir Simon Fresyll
/ and two other knights to show to their king their apoyntment. The king of
England agreed the sone^ to this truse / because his host lacked vytayll: so
he came back again and sent every man home. The scottysshe messangers went
toward France / and took shypping at Dover.

Now king Dauyd who had been a seuyne year in France / and knew well that his
realm was sore distroyed. Thau^e he took leave of the french king: to go home
into his own contre to confort his people / so he took shypping with his wife
and such company as he had at a port / and did put himself under the guyding
of a maryner Rychard Flamont: and so he aryued at a port of Moroyse / or ever
that any in Scotland knew thereof. Nor he knew nothing of the messangers that
were gone into France to speak with him / nor they knew not of his retournyng
home.

How king Dauyd of Scotland came with a great host to Newcastell upon Tyne.
Ca. lxxiiii.
When that young king Dauyd of Scotland / was come into his country: his men
came about him with great joy and solemn puyte / and brought him to the town
of saint John^s: thither ca^e people fro all proties to sehym. And than every man
showed him the damages / and the dystrueti on that king Edward and
thenglysshmen had done in Scotland: than he said well I shall be well revenged /
orels lose all my realm and my life in the pain. Than^e he sent messangers to
all parts ferr and nere / desyring every man to help him in his business: at
his sendyng thither came therle of Orkeney a great prince and a puyssaunt / he
had married the kings suster: he brought a great nombre of men a war with him
/ and diverse other lords and knights of Souegne / of Melbegne / and of
Denmarche: some for love and some for wages / so that when they were all
together / they were a.lx. M. men a foot / and on hackenayes a.iii. M. armed
after their manner. Whan^e they were all ready they removed to go into England /
to do there asmoche hurt as they might: for y^ truse was as than expyred / or
else to fight with the king of England / who had caused them to suffer much
disease. The scotts departed fro saint Johannes town and went to Donfremelyn:
and the next day there they passed a little arm of y^ see / than they went with
great dyligence and passed by Edenborowe / and after by Rousburge the which
was as than english: but they made none assaut there / because they would have
none of their company hurt / nor to wast none of their artillary. They thought
to do a greatter deed or they returned into Scotland: and so after they
passed not far of fro Berwyke / and went by without any assaut gyueng. And so
entered into the country of Northumberlande: and came to the river of Tyne
brennyng all the country round about them / and at last came to Newecastell
upon Tyne: and there he lay and all his people about the town that night. And
in the mornig a certain nombre of ge^tylmen that were in the town issued out
/ to the nombre of. C C. speres to make a skry in the scottysshe host: they
dasshed into y^ scottyssh host right on therle of Morets tents / who bare in
his armor silver three oreylles goules / there they took him in his bed: and
slew many or thoost was moved and wan great pyllage. Than they returned into
y^ town boldly with great joy / and delyuerd therle Moret as prisoner to the
captain of the castle the lord John^ Neuell. When the scotts were up / they
armed them and ranlyke mad men to the barryers of the town and made a great
assaut / the which endured long but little it awayled them / and they lost
there many men: for there were many good men of war within / who defended
the^self so wisely / that the scotts were feign at last to withdraw a back
to their loss.

How king Dauyd of Scotland distroyed the city of Dyrrame. Cap. lxxv.
When that king Dauyd and his counsel: saw that his taryeng about Newcastell
was dangerous / and that he could win thereby another profet nor honor: than
he departed and entered into the country of the bysshoprike of Dyrram / and there
brent and wasted all before them. And so came to the cite of Dyrram / and laid
siege round about it / and made many great assautes like mad men / by cause
they had lost therle of Morette: and they knew well that there was much
richesse in the city / for all the country there about was fled thither. The
scotts made ingens and instruments to come to the walls to make the feercer
assant: and when the scotts were gone fro New castle / than^e sir John^
Neuyll captain there / mounted on a good horse and took away far of fro the
scotts: and did somoche that within five days he came to Chyrtsay / where as
king Edward lay as than: there he showed the king tidings of the scotts. Than
the king send forth messangers into every part: co^mau^dyng every man between
the age of.lx. and.xv. all excuses laid a part to draw Northwarde and to mete
him in that country / to aid and defend his country / that the scotts
distroyed: than lords / knights / squyers: and all other drew toward the
north. The king deperted himself hastily and tarried for no man / and every man
followed as well as they might: in the mean season the scotts assauted the
city of Dyrrame / with ingens and other instruments: so feersly yt they
within could not defend themself / but that the city was won byforce / and
robbed and clean brent: and all manner of people put to death without mercy / men
women / and children / monks / priests / and chanons: so that there abode a
live no manner a person house nor church / but it was distroyed / the which was
great pytie so to dystroy christen blood. And the churches of godde wherein that
god was honored and served.

How the scotts besieged a castle of therle of Salysburies. Cap. lxxvi.
THan king Dauyd was cou^selled to draw a back a long by ye river of Tyne and
to draw toward Carlyle and as he went thyderward he loged that night beside a
castle of therle of Salysburies / the which was well kept with men a war:
captain thereof was sir Wyllm^ Montagu / son to therle of Salysburis suster.
The next day the scotts dysloged to go toward Carlyle: they had much carry age
with them of such pyllage as they had won at Dyra^. When ser Wyllm^ Montagu
saw how the scotts passed by without restyng / tha^ he with.xl. with him
issued out a horsbacke / and followed covertly the hinder train of the scotts
/ who had horses so charged with baggage / yt they might sca^t go any great
pace. And he ouertoke them at thetryng into a wood and set on them / and there
slew and hurt of the scottz mo than. CC. and took mo than sixscore horses
charged with pyllage / and soled the^ toward the castle. The cry and brunt of
the flight came to the heryng of sir Wyllyam Duglas / who had the charge of the
reregarde / and as than he was past ye wood: when he saw the scotts came
fleyng over the dales and mou^tayns he had great marvel / and than he and all
his company ran forth and rested not till they ca^e to the foot of the castle
/ and mounted the hill in have. But or he came to the bayls the^gly sshmen were
entered / and had closed the barryers and put their pray in saftie: than the
scotts began to assail feersly / and they within defended the^: there these
two Wyllm^s did what they might each to grieve other. This assaut endured so
long / that all thoost came thither king and all: when ye king and his counsel
saw how his men were slain lyeng in the field / and the assaylantes sore hurt
without wynning of any thing / than he commanded to cease thassaut and to
lodge. Than every man began to seek for his logyng and to gader together the
deed men / and to dress them that were hurt. The next day the king of scotts
commanded that every man should be ready to assail / and they within were ready
to defend: there was a sore assautand a perylous / there might a ben seen many
noble deeds on both pertes. There was within present / the noble countess of
Salysbury / who was as than reputed for the most sagest and fayrestlady of all
England / y^ castle parteyned to her husband therle of Salisbury who was
taken prisoner with the earl of Suttolke before Lyle in Flanders / as ye have
hard before / and was in prison as than (...) the chatelot of Paris. The king
of England gave ye same castle to the said earl when he married first the said
lady / for the prowes and good service that he had done before when he was
called but sir Wyllm^ Montagu. This noble lady conforted them greatly within /
for by the regard of such a lady and by her swear co^forting / a man ought to
be worth two men at need. This assaut dured long and the scotts lost many of
their men / for they adventured themself hardely / and carried wood and tymbre
to have sylled the dykes to thyntent to bring their engyns to ye walls / but
they within defended themself so valyantly that the assaylantes were feign to
draw a back. Than the king commanded y^ ingens to be well kept that night /
and the next day to enforce the assaut / than every man drue to their lodging
except those that kept thyngens. Some wept the death of their friends / other
conforted them that were hurt they of the castellsa we well if king Dauyd
co^tynued his sege / how they should have much a do to defend them and their
castle where fore they took counsel among them to send to king Edward / who
lay at york as it was showed them / by such prisoners as they had taken of
the scotts. Than they looked among the^ who should do y^ message: but they
could find none that would leave the castle / and the presence of the fair
lady to do yt deed / so there was among them great strife. Than when the
captain sir Wyllm^ Montague saw that / he said sirs I se well the truth and
good will that ye bear to my lady of this house / so that for the love of her
and for you all / I shall put my body in aduentur to do this message / for I
have such trust in you yt ye shall right well defend this castle till I
return again. And on the other side I have such trust in the king our
sovereign lord / that I shall shortly bring you such socours / that shall
cause you to be joyful / and than I trust ye king shall so reward you / that
ye shall be content. Of these words the countess and all other were right
ioyefull / and when the night came / the said sir Wyllm^ made him ready as
privily as he might / and it happed so well for him / that it rayned all night
/ so that the scotts kept still within these lodginges. Thus at mydnight sir
Wyllm^ Montagu passed through thoost and was not seen / and so rode forth till
it was day / than he met.ii. scotts half a leage fro thost / briuyng before
them two oxen and a cow toward thoost ser Wyllm^ knew well they were scotts
and set on the^ / and wounded them both and slew the catell / to thy^^ tent
yt they of thost should have none ease by the^ / than he said to the two hurt
scotts: go yor ways and say to your king that Wyllm^ of Montague has thus
passed through his host / and is going to fetch aid of the king of England
/ and so departed. Than the same morning the king of scotts made a fecrse
assaut but nothing could he wyn / and every day lightly they made assaut. Than
his counsel same how he did but lose his men / and yt the king of England
might well come thither or the castle were woe(...) they by one acorde
counseled their king to depart / saying how the abiding there was nor for his
profet / nor yet for his honor. And said sir ye have honorably achyued your
enterprise / and have done great dispyre to the englyssshmen: (...) that ye
have been in this contre a.xii. days / and taken and distroyed the city of
Dyrrame. Wherefore sir all things co^sydred it were good name that ye returned
/ and take with you your pyllage that ye have won: and an other time ye may
return again when it pleases you. The king who would not do against the
opynyons of all his counsel / agreed to them sore against his mind: howbeit
the next morning h^ byss^ged and all his host / and took the way straight to
the great forest of Gedeours / there to tarry at their case / and to know what
the king of England would do farther / other to god back again: or else to
enter into Scotland.

How the king of England was in amors with the countess of Salisbury. Ca.
lxxvii.
THe same day yt the scotts departed fro the said castle king Edward came
thither with all his host about noon and came to the same place where as the
scotts had saged and was sore displeased that he found not the scotts there /
for he ca^e thither in such have yt his horse and men were sore traueled. Than he
commanded to lodge there that night / and said how he would go se y^ castle
and the noble lady therein / for he had not seue her sithe she was married
before: than every man took his logyng as he list. And as soon as the king was
unarmed / he took a.x. or.xii. knights with him / and went to the castle to
salute the countess of Salisbury: and to se the manner of the assautes of the
scotts / and the defense that was made against them. As Soon as the lady knew
of y^ kings coming she set opyn the gates and ca^e out so richely be seen /
that every man marueyled of her beauty: and could not cease to regard her
noblenes with her great beauty / and the gracyous words and countenance that
she made. When she came to the king: she knelyd down to the yerth thankyng him
of his socours: and so led him into the castle to make him chere and honor
/ as she that could right well do it / every man regarded her maruelusly. The
king him self could not witholde his regardyng of her: for he thought that he
never saw before so noble nor so fair a lady / he was stryken therewith to
the heart with a sparcle of fine love / that endured long after: he thought no
lady in the world so worthy to be / beloved as she. Thus they entered into the
castle hand in hand: the lady led him first into the hall / and after into
the chamber nobly aparelled / the king regarded so the lady that he was a
basshed. At last he went to a wyndo to rest him / and so sell in a great study:
the lady went about to make chere to the lords and knights that were there /
and co^maun ded to dress the hall for dinner. When she had al devised and
commanded: than^e she cameto the king with a merry chere / who was in a great
stu die (and she said) dear and why do ye study so sor yo^ grace not dyspleased
/ it aparteyneth not to you so to do / rather ye should make good chere and be
joyful: seeing ye have chased away your enmies who durst not abide you / let
other men study for the remynant. Than the king said: a dear lady know for
truth / that sith I entered into the castle: there is a study come to my mind
so y^ I can not choose but to muse / nor I cannat tell what shall fall thereof:
put it out of my heart I cannat. A sir quod the lady ye ought always to make
good chere to confort there with yo^ people / god has aided you so in yo^
besynes and has given you so great graces / that ye be the most douted and
honored priuce in all christendom and if the king of scotts have done you
any die spyre or damage / ye may well amend it when it shall please you: as ye
have done diverse times or this. Sir leave your musyng and come into y^ hall if
it please you yo^ dinner is all ready / a fair lady quod the king: other things
lies at my heart that ye know not of / but surely y^ sweet be having / the
perfyt wysedom / the good grace noblenes / and exelle^nt beauty that I se in
you: has so sore surprised my heart / y^ I can not but love you: and without
your love I am but deed Than the lady said: a right noble prince / for
goddessake mock nor tempt me not / I can not believe that it is true that ye
say / nor that so noble a prince as ye be would think to dishonor me / and my
lord my husband: who is so valyant a knight / and has done your grace so
good service / and as yet lyethe in prison for your quarrel. Certe^ly sir ye
should in this case have but a small praise: and nothing the better thereby I
had never as yet such a thought in my heart nor I trust in god never shall have /
for no man lyueng. If I had any such intencyon / your grace ought not all
only to blame me: but also to punysshe my body / ye and by true justice to be
disme^bred Therewith the lady deperted fro the king and went into the hall to
have the dinner: than she returned again to the king and brought some of his
knights with her / and said sir: if it please you to come into the hall your
knights abides for you to wasshe ye have been to long fasting. Than y^ king
went into the hall and wassht / and sat down among his lords and the lady
also: the king ete but little he sat still musyng / and as he durst he cast his
eyes upon the lady. Of his sadness his knights had marvel for he was not
acustomed so to be: some thought it was because the scotts were escaped fro him
/ all y^ day the king tarried there and wist not what to do. Sometime he ymagined
yt honor and troth defended him to set his heart in such a case to dishonor
such a lady: and so true a knight as her husband was / who had always well and
truly served him. On the other per^ love so constrained him / that the power
thereof surmounted honor and troth. Thus y^ king debated in himself all that
day and all that night: In the morning he a rose and dysloged all his host /
and drew after the scotts to chase them out of his realm. Than he took leave
of the lady / saying my dear lady to god I commend you till I return again:
requiryng you to advise you otherwise than ye have said to me. Noble prince
quod the lady: god y^ father glorious be yo^ conduct / and put you out of all
bylayne thoughts sir I am and ever shall be ready to do your grace ser uyce to
your honor and to mine / therewith the king deperted all abashed. And so
followed the scotts till he came to the cite of Berwyke / and went and lodged
within. iiii leages of the forelt of Gedeors / where askyng Dauyd and all his
company were entered: in trust of the great wilderness. The king of England
tarried there a.iii. days to se if the scotts would issue out to fight with him
/ in these three days there were diverse skirmysshes on both perties: and diverse
slain taken / and sore hurt among the scotts. Sir Wyllyam Duglas was he
that did most trouble to thenglysshemen / he bare azure / a comble silver /
three stars goules.

How therle of Salysbury and therle Moret / were delyuerd out of prison by
exchange. Cap. lxxviii.
IN these said three days there were noble men on both parties / that treatid
for a peace to be had between these two kings: and their treaty took such
essect / that a trewse was agreed to endure two year / so that the french
king would thereto agree. For the king of scotts was so sore alyed to the
french king / y^ he might take no peace without his consent: and it so be the
french king would not agree to the peace / than the truse to endure to the
first day of May following. And it was agreed that therle of Morette should be
quyte for his prisonment if the king of scotts could do somoche to purchase
with the french king / that therle of Salisbury might in like manner be quyte
out of prison / the which thing should be done before the feast of saint John^
of Baptyst next after. The king of England agreed y^ sooner to this truse /
because he had war in France / in Gascoyne / in Poycton / in Xaynton / in
Bretaygne / and in every place he had men of war at his wages: than the king
of scotts sent great messangers to the french king to agree to this truse. The
french king was content: seeing it was the desire of the king of scotts / tha^
therle of Salisbuey was sent into England / and the king of England sent
inco^tynent therle Moret into Scotland.

How sir Charles du Bloys with diverse lords of France took the city of
Kenes in Bretayne. Cap. lxxix.
IT is to be known that when the duke of Normandy the duke of Burgoyne / y^
duke of Ala^son / the duke of Burbon / therle of Bloys / the constable of
France / therle of Guynes his son / sir James de Burbone sir Loyes of
Spaygne / with other lords and knights of France. When they were departed
out of Bretayne: and had conquered the strong castle of Chastoneaux / and the
cite of Nantes: and taken therle of Mou^tfort and delyuerd him to y^ french
king / who had put him in prison in the castle of Loure in Paris: and ser
Charles of Bloys being in Nantes and the country obeyed to him round about /
abydinge the somer season to make better war than in winter. When the sweet
season of somer approached: the lords of France and diverse other drue toward
Bretayne with a great host to aid sir Charles de Blois / to recover y^
resydue of the duchy of Bretayne. They found and Charles of Bloys in Na^tes
than they determined to lay sege to Kenes The countess of Mountfort had well
prevented the matter: and had set there for captain ser Wyllyam of Cadudall
breton / the lords of France came thither and did much trouble with assautes /
howbeit they within defended themself so valiantly / that their enemies lost
more than they wanne. When the countess of Mountfort knew that the lords of
France were come in to Bretaygne with such a puyssance / she send sir Amery
of Clysson into England / desyring socourse of the king: on the co^dycion that
therle of Mountfortes son and heir / should take to wife one of the kings
daughters / and should be called duches of Bretayne. The king of England was as
than at London making chere to therle of Salisbury / who was new come out of
prison: when this sir Amery of Clysson was come to the king / and had made
relacyon of his message. The king granted his request: and commanded sir
Water of Manny to take with him as many men of war as sir Amery desired / and
shortly to make them ready to go into Bretayne to aid the countess of
Mountfort / and to take with him a.iii. M. archers of the best. Thus ser Water
/ and sir Amery took the sea: and with the^ went the two brethren of Lyned all
/ sir Loys and sir John^ the Haz of Brabant / ser Hubert of Fresnoy / ser Aleyn
Syrefound and diverse other: and a.vi. M. archers. But a great tempest took the^
on the sea and a contrary wind / wherefore they abode on the sea.xl. days: all
this season the lords of France with sir Charles de Bloys kept still the sege
before Renes / and sore constrained them within: so that the burgesses of the
town would gladly have taken apoyntme^t / but their captain sir Wyllm^ of
Cadudall would in no wise agree thereto. When the burgesses and the commons of
the town had endured much pain and saw no socours coming fro no pertie /
they would have yielded up the town but ye captain would not: when they saw
that finally they took him and put him in prison. And made covenant with sir
Charles du Bloys to yield up the town the next day on the condycion that all
such as were of the countes part might go their ways whyther they list without
danger or trouble / ye lord Charles de Bloys did grant their desire. Thus the
city of Renes was given up: ye year of our lord. M.iii. C.xlii. in the
beginning of May. Sir Wyllm^ of Nuadudall would not tarry there but went straight
to Hanybout to the countess of Mou^tfort / who as than had hard no tidyngs of
sir Amery of Clysson nor of his company.

How sir Charles du Bloys besieged the countess of Mountfort in Hanybout.
Cap. lxxx.
When the city of Renes was given up: ye burgesses made their homage and
fealty to the lord Charles of Bloys. Than he was counseled to go and lay
siege to Hany boute where as the countess was: saying that therle being in
prison / if they might get the countess and her son / it should make an
end of all their war. Than they went all to Hany bout: and laid siege
thereto and to the castle also / as ferr as they might by land: with ye
countess in Hanybout / there was the bishop of Leon in Bretayne / also there
was sir yues of Tribiquedy / the lord of Landreman / sir Wyllm^ of Nuadudall /
and ye Chatelayne of Guyngnape the two brethren of Nuyreth / sir Henry and
(...) Olyuer of Pe^nefort: and diverse other. When the countess and her company
understood that the frenchmen were coming to lay siege to ye town of
Hanybout: than it was commanded to sound the watch bell a la^ / and every
man to be armed and draw to their defense. When sir Charles and the frenchmen
came nere to the town: they commanded to lodge there that night / some of the
young lusty companyons ca^e skirmysshyng to the barrers / and some of them
within issued out to them: so that there was a great affray / but the genowayes
and frenchmen lost more than they wanne. When night came on / every man drew
to their lodging: y^ next day the lords took counsel to assail the batrers
to se the manner of them within: and so the third day they made a great assaute
to the batrers / fro morning till it was noone. Than the assaylantes drew a
back sore beaten / and diverse slain: when the lords of France saw their
men draw a back they were sore dyspleased / and caused the assaut to begin
again more ferser than it was before / and they within defended themself
valyantly. The countess her self ware harness on her body: and rode on a
great courser fro street to street / desyringe her people to make good defense:
and she caused damoselles and other women to cut short their kyrtels / and
to carry stones and pottes full of chalk to the walls / to be cast down to
their enemies. This lady did there an hardy enterprise / she mounted up to ye
heyght of a tower / to se how the frenchmen were ordered Without. She saw how
that all the lords and all other people of thoost were all gone out of there
field to thassaut: than she took again her courser armed as she was / and
caused three hundred men a horsbacke to be ready / and she went with them to
another gate where as there was non assaut. She issued out and her company / and
dasshed into the french lodgings / and cut down tents and set fire in
their lodgings / she found no defense there but a certain of varlettes and
boys / who ran away. When ye lords of France looked behind them and saw
their lodgings a fire / and hard the cry and noise there: they returned to ye
field cryeng treason treason / so that all thassaut was left. When the
countess saw that / she drew to gyder her company: and when she saw she
coud not enter again into the town without great damage / she took an other
way and went to the castle of Breast / the which was not ferr thens. When sir
Loys of Spain / who was marshal of the host was come to the field / and saw
their lodgings brennyng: and saw the countess and her company going away /
he followed after her with a great nombre: he chased her so nere / that he slew
and hurt diverse of them that were behind yuell horsed. But the countess
and the most part of her company rode so well / that they came to Breast /
and there they were received with great joy. The next day the lords of
France / who had lost their tents and their prouisyons: thanne took
counsel to lodge in bowers of trees more nerer to the town / and they had
great marueyle when they knew that the countess herself had done that
enterprise. They of the town wist not where the countess was become / whereof
they were in great trouble for it was five days or they hard any tidings.
The countess did somoche at Breast: that she gate together a.v. hundred speres /
and than about mydnight she departed fro Breast / and by the son rising she
came along by the one side of the host / and came to one of the gates of
Hanybout the which was opyned for her: and there in she entered and allher
company with great noise of trumpettes and canayrs / whereof the french host
had great marueyle: and armed the^ and ran to the town to assaut it / and they
within ready to defend: there began a feerse assaut and endured till noone / but
the frenchmen lost more than they within. At noone thassaut ceased: than they
took counsel that sir Charles du Bloys should go fro that sege and give assaut
to the castle of Alroy the which king Arthure made / and with him should go
the duke of Burbone / therle of Bloys / the marshall of France / sir Robert
Bertrande: and that sir Henry de Leon and part of the geneuoys and the lord
Loys of Spain / and the vycont of Rohayne withal the spanyer des / should
abide still before Hanybout: for they saw well they could have no profet to
assail Hanybout any more. But they sent for. xii great engyns to Renes / to
thyntent to cast into the town and castle day and night. So they divided
their host: the one still before Hanybout the other with sir Charles of Bloys
before Aulroy: they within Alroy were well fortifyed and were a two. C.
companyons / able for to maintain the war. And sir Henry of Penfort and sir
Olyuer his brother were chyefe capitaynes there / a four leages fro that
castle was ye good town of Uannes parteyning to the countess / and captain
there was sir Gelfray of Malatrayt / not far thens also was the good town of
Guyngnape / the cathelayne of Dyuant was captain there: he was at Hanybout with
ye countess / and had left in the town of Dynant his wife and his children /
and had left there capytayne in his stead Raynolde his son. Between these two
towns stood a strong castle parteynyng to sir Charles du Bloys (...) was
well kept with soudyours burgonyons. Captain there was sir Gerarde of Maulayne
/ and with him an other knight called Pyer Portbeufe: they wasted all the
country about them / and constrained sore the said two towns / for there could
no there marchandyse nor prouisyon enter into any of the^ but in great danger.
On a day they would ride toward Ua^nes / and an other day toward Guyngnape:
and on a day sir Raynolde of Dynant laid a busshment / and the same day (...)
Gerarde of Maulayne rode forth and had taken a.xv. marchantes and all their
goods / and was driuyng of them toward their castle called Rochprion and so
fell in the busshment: and there sir Raynolde of Dynant took sir Gerarde
prisoner and a.xxv. of his company / and rescued the marchantes and led
forth their prisoners to Dynant / whereof sir Raynolde was much praised and
well worthy.

Now let us speak of the countess of Mount fort / who was besieged in
Hanybout by sir Loys of Spain / who kept the siege there: and he had so broken
and bruised the walls of ye town with his engines. So that they within began to
be a basshed / and on a day the bishop of Leon spoke with sir Henry of Leon his
nephue / by who^ as it was said that therle Mou^tfort was taken So long they
spoke together that they agreed y^ the bishop should do what he could to cause
the company within to agree to yield up the town and castle to sir Charles de
Bloys: and (...) Henry de Leon on the other side should purchase piece forthe^ all
/ of sir Charles de Bloyes: and to lose nothing of their goods. Thus the
bishop entered again into the town: the countes inco^tynent douted of some
yuell purchase / than she desired the lords and knights yt were there / that
for the love of god they should be in no dout / for she said she was in surety
that they should have socours within three days: howbeit ye bysshope spoke
somoch and showed so many reasons to ye lords / that they were in a great
trouble all that night. The next morning they brewe to counsel again: so that
they were nere of acorde to have given up the town / and sir Henry was come
nere to the town to have taken possession thereof: than the countess looked
down along the sea out at a wyndo in the castle / and began to smyle for
great joy that she had to se the socours coming / (...) which she had so long
desired. Than she (...) out a loud and said twyse: I se the socurs of England
coming / than they of the town ^an to the walls and saw a great nom^^ of
(...)pes great and small fresshly decked coming toward Hanybout / they
thought well it was the socours of England / who had been on the sea.lx. days
by reason of contrary wyndes.

How sir Water of Manny brought thenglysshmen into Bretayne. Cap. lxxxi.
When the seneshall of Guyngnape / and Perse of Tribyquedy sir Galeran of
Landreman and the other knights saw these socours coming: tha^ they said to
the bishop / sir ye may well leave your treaty for they said they were not
co^ tent as than to follow his counsel. Than the bishop said sirs: than
our company shall de part for I will go to him that has most right as me
seems. Than he departed fro Hanibout and defied the countess and all her
ayders and so went to sir Henry de Leon and showed him how the matter went:
than sir Henry was sore dyspleased / and caused incontinent to rere up the
grettest ingens that they had nere to the cattle and commanded that they
should not sease to last day and night. Than he deperted thens and brought the
bishop to sir Loys of Spain / who received him with great joy / and so did
sir Charles of Bloys: than the countess dressed up halles and chambers to
lodge the lords of England that were coming / and did send against them
right nobly. And when they were a land: she came to them with great reverence
and feested them the beast she might / and thanked the^ right humbly: and
caused all the knights and other to lodge at their ease in the castle and in
the town. And the next day she made them a great feast at dinner: all night
and the next day also the ingens never ceased to cast / and after dinner sir
Gaultier of Ma^ny who was chief of that company / demanded of the state of the
town and of the host without. And said I have a great desire to issue out and
to break down this great ingen that stands so nere us / if any ^oll follow
me. Than and Perse of Tribyquidy said how he would not fail him / at this
his first beginning: and so said the lord of La^dre man / than they armed them
and so they issued out privily at a certain gate / and with the^ a.iii.
hundred archers / who shot so holly together y^ they that kept the ingen
fled away / and the men of arms came after the archers and slew diverse of
them that fled and beat down the great engyn / and brake it all to peaces.
Than^e they ran in among the tents and logynges and set fire in diverse
places / and slew and hurt diverse till the host began to stir: than they
withdrue fair and easily / and they of the host ran after the^ like mad
men. Than and Gaultier said: let me never be beloved with my lady without I
have a course with one of these folowers / and therewith turned his spear in
the rest: and in likewise so did the two brethren of L*dall and the haz of
Brabant / sir yues of Tribyquedy / sir Galeran of Landreman and diverse other
companyons: they ran at the first comers there might well a ben legs seen
turned upward: there began a sore medlynge / for they of the host always
increased. Wherefore in behooved thenglysshmen to withdraw toward there
fortress: there might well a ben seen on both perties many noble deeds taking
and rescuyng / y^ englysshmen drew sagely to y^ dykes / and there made a stall
till all their men were in sauegard: and all the resydue of the town issued out
to rescue their company / and caused them of the host to recule back. So when
they of the host saw how they could do no good they drew to their lodgings:
and they of the fortress in likewise to their lodgings: than the countess
disce^dyd down fro the castle with a glad chere / and came and kyst sir
Gaultier of Manny / and his companyons one after an other two or three times
like a valyant lady.

How the castle of Conquest was won two times. Cap. lxxxii.
THe next day sir Loys of Spain called to counsel the vycont of Rohayne the
bishop of Leon / the lord Henry of Leon / and the master of the geneuoys to
know there advise what was best to do / they saw well the town of Hanybout was
marvelously strong / and greatly socoured by means of tharchers of England:
they thought their time but lost to abide there / for they could not se how to win any thing there. Than they all agreed to dyslodge y^ next day and to go
to the castle of Alroy: where sir Charles of Bloys lay at siege / the next day
betymes they pulled down their lodgings and drew thither as they were
purposed. And they of the town made great cryeng and showtyng after the^: and
some issued out to adventure the^ self / but they were sone put a back again
and lost some of their company or they could enter a gain into y^ town. When
sir Loys of Spain ca^e to sir Charles of Bloys / he showed him the reason why
he left thesege before Hanybout than it was ordained that sir Loys of Spain
and his company should go and ley siege to Dynant / the which was not closed
but with pales / water / and maresse: and as sir Loyes went toward Dynant he
came by a castle called Conquest. And captain there for the countess was a
knight of Normandy called sir Mencon / and with him diverse soudyers: sir Loys
came thither and gave a great assaut / and they within defended them so well /
that thassaut endured till mydaight and in the morning it began again:
thassaylantes persed so nere that they came to y^ wall and made a great hole
through / for the dykes were of no depnesse. And so byforce they entered and
slew all them within the castle / except the knight whom they took prisoner:
and stablysshed there a new Chatelayne and a.lx. soudyers with him / tha^ sir
Loys departed and went and laid seige to Dynaunt. The countess of Mountfort
had knowledge how sir Loyes of Spain was assautyng of the castle of Conquest
/ than she said to sir Water of Manny and his company that if they might rescue
that castle / they should achyue great honor. They all agreed thereto / and
deperted the next morning fro Hanybout so y^ there abode but few behind in the
town / they rode so falt y^ about noone they came to the castle of Conquest
wherein was as than y^ french garyson: for they had won it the day before. When
sir Water of Manny saw y^ / and how that sir Loyes of Spain was gone he was
sorry because he might not fight with him: and said to his company / sirs I will
not deperte hens till Ise what company is yander within the castle / and to
know how it was won. Than he and all his made them ready to the assaut / and
the frenchmen and spanyardes same that / they defended them self as well as
they might: the archers held them so short that then glysshmen aproched to the
walls and they found the hole in the wall / whereby the cattle was won before:
and by the same place they entered and slew all within / except.x. that were
taken to mercy, than thenglysshmen and bret^ns drue again to Hanybout / they
would set no garyson in Conquest for they saw well it was not to he holden.

How sir Loyes of Spain took the town of Dynant and of Gerande. Cap. lxxxiii.
Now let us return to and Loys of Spain / who belieged the town of Dynant
in Bretayne / and than he caused to be made little vessels to make assautes
both by water and by land. And when y^ burgesses of the town saw how they
were in danger to lose their lives and goods / they yielded the^self again the
will of their capten sir Raynalt Guyngnap / who^ they slew in the mids of
the market place: by cause he would not consent to them. And when sir Loyes of
Spain had been there two days and taken fealty of the burgesses / and set there
a new capyten a squire called Gerard of Maulyne whom they found there as
prisoner / and the lord Pyers Portbeufe with him. Than they went to a great
town on the sea side called Gerand / they laid siege thereto: and found thereby
many vessels and ships laded with wine that marcha^tes had brought thither fro
Poycton and ^ochell to sell the marchantes anon had sold their my nes but they
were but yuell paid. Than and Loys caused some of the spanyardes and geneunys
to enter into these ships: and the next day they assailed the town both by
land and by water / so that they within could not defend the^ self but that
they were lightly won byforce / and the town robbed and all the people put
to the sword without mercy: men / women / and children: and five churches
brent and vyolated Whereof sir Loys was sore dyspleased and caused.xxiiii. of
them that did y^ d^de to be hanged for their labors. There was much treasoure
won / so that every man had more than he could bear away: for it was a rich
town of marchan dyse. When this town was won they wist not whyder to go
farther / than sir Loys of Spayn and with him sir Oaths ^orne / and certain
genowayes and spanyardes entered into y^ ships / to adventure along by the sea
side to se^ they might win any thing there: and the vycont of Rohayne / the
hysshoppe of (...) ^en ry of Leon his nephue: and all the other returned to
choost to sir Charles of ^loys / who lay slyll before the castle of A^lroy.
And there they found many knights and lords of France who were newely come
thither: as sir Loyes of Poycters / therle of Ualence / therle of Aucerre therle
of Porcyen / therle of Joigny / the earl of Bolayne: and diverse other that
king (...) had sent thither / and some y^ canme of there own good wylles to
serve sir Charles of Bloys. (...) than the strong castle of Alroy was not
won but there was such famyn within / that.vii. days before they had eten
all their horses: and the lord Charles de Bloys would not take them to mercy /
without he might have them simpley to do his pleasur. And when they within saw
no other remedy: secretly in the night they issued but and by the will of god
went through thoost on the one side / yet some were perceived and slain but
sir Henry of Pennefort and sir Olyuer his brother escaped by a little wood that
was thereby and went straight to Hanybout to the countess. So thus wansir
Charles of Bloyes the castle of Alroy / when he had layne at siege.x. wekes:
than he newly fortifyed the place and set therein new captayns and men of war.
Than he departed and went and laid siege to Ua^nes / wherein sir Geffray of
Maletrayt was captain / the next day certain soudyers of the countesses of
Mountfort being in the town of Ployremell / issued out on the hope somewhat to win: and came suddenly in the morning into the host of sir Charles de Bloys /
but they adventured themself so far that they were closed in and lost many of
their folks / and the other fled away and were chased to the gates of
Ployremell / the which was not ferr of fro Ua^nes. And when they of the host
were returned fro the chase / incontinent they made assaut to Ua^nes / and
byforce wanne they bayles / hard to the gate of the cite there was a sore
skirmysshe and many hurt and slain on both parties / the assaut endured till
it was night: than there was a truse taken to endure all the next day. The
burgesses y^ next day yielded up the town whyther y^ captain would ornat who
when he saw it would be none other wise / departed out of the town as secretly
as he could and went to Hanybout. Sosir Charles of Bloys and the frenchmen
entered into Ua^nes and tarried there five days / than they went and laid siege
to an other city called Traiz.

How sir water of Manny dysconfited sir Loyes of Spain in the field of
Camperle. Cap. lxxxiiii.
NOw let us return to sir Loyes of Spain who when he was at the port of
Guerand by the seesyde / he and his company sailed forth till they came into
Bretayn bretonaunt / to a port called Camperle right nene to Quypercorentyn and
to saint Mathue of Fine Portern. Than they issued out of the ships and landed
/ and brent all the country about and gate much richesse: the which they
conveyed into their shyyppes / When sir Gaultyer of Manny / and sir Arnold of
Clysson understood those tidings / they determined to go thither: and showed
their minds to sir Gyles of Tribyquedy / and to the Cathelayne of Guyngnape.
The lord of Landreman / sir Wyllm^ of Caducall / the two brethern of
Penneforde / and to the other knights that were there in Hanybout / and all
they agreed to go with good wylles: than they took their ships / and took
with them a three thousand archers / and so sailed forth till they came to
the port where as the ships of sir Loys of Spaynes lay. Inco^tynent they took
them and slew all that were within them / and they found in them such
richesse that they had marvel thereof: than they took land and went forth and
brent diverse towns and houses before them / and departed themself into three
batayls / to the intent the sooner to find their ennemys / and left a three
hundred archers to keep their ships and that they had won. Than they set
on their way in three parts: these tidings anon came to sir Loyes of Spain /
than he drew together all his company and withdrue back toward his ships in
great have / and encountered one of y^ three batayls / than^e he saw well he
must needs fight: he set his men in order and made new knights / as his
nephue called Alphons. Than sir Loys set on fiersly / and at the first
rencou^ter many were overthrown / and likely to have been dysconfyted / and the
other two batels had not come on: for by the cry and noise of the people of the
country they drew thither. Than the battle was more seerser / thenglysshe
archers shot so holly together that the geneuoyes and spanyardes were
dysconfited / and all slain: for they of the country fell in with staves and
stones / so that ser Loys had much a do to escape and did flee to the ships /
and of.vi. M. there escaped with him but three hundred / and his nephue was
slain. And when he ca^e to the ships he roud not enter for the archers of
England kept him of: so he was feign with great ieopardy to take a little shypp^
called Lyque / and such of his company as he cou^de get to him / and sailed
away as fast as he might. When sir Gaulter and his company ca^e to the ships
/ they entered into the best ship they had / and followed in the chase of sir
Loyes of Spain: who ever fled so fast before them that they could not
overtake him. Sir ^oyes at last took port at Redon / and he and all his entered
into the town but he tarried not there: for incontinent* thengly sshmen landed
at the same place / so that sir Loyes and his company were feign to get such
horses as they might and rode thens to Renes / the which was not far thens:
and such as were yuell horsed were feign to fall in the hands of their
enemies / so that sir Loys entered into Renes: and thenglysshmen and bretons
returned to Redone / and there lay all night. The next day they took again
the sea: to sail to Hanybout to the countess of Mou^tfort but they had a
contrary wind / so that they were feign to take land a three leages fro
Dynant. Than they took their way by land / and wasted the country about
Dynant / and took horses such as they could get some without sadyls and so
ca^e to Rochprion. Than sir Gaultier of Manny saydsirs: if our company were not
so soretraueled I would give assaut to this castle / the other knights
answered him and said / sir set on at your pleasure for we shall not for sake
you to dye in the quarrel / and so they al went to the assaut. Than Gerarde of
Maulyn who was captain there made good defense / so that there was a perylouse
assaut. Sir Johan Butler / and sir Mathewe of Fresnoy were sore burte with many
other.

How sir Gaultier of Manny took the castle of Gonyin the forest. Cap. lxxxv.
THis Gerarv of Maulyn had a brother called Rengne of Maulyn who was captain
of a little for tresse thereby called Fauet. And whasie he knew that
the^glysshmen and bretons were assayling of his brother at Rochprion: to
thentent to aid his brother he issued out and took with him a.xl. co^panyons.
And as he came thyderwarde through afayre medowe by a wood side / he found
certain englysshmen and other lyeng there hurt / he set on them and took
them prisoners and led them to Fauet hurt as they were: and some sledde to
sir Water of Manny and showed him the case / than he ceased the assaut. And he
and all his company in great hasse followed them that led the prisoners to
Fauet but he could not overtake them: so that Regny and his prisoners were
entered into the castle. Than thenglysshmen as sore trayueled as they were made
there a great assaut but nothing could they win / they were so well defended:
and also it was late. They lay there all night / to the intent to assyle y^
castle again in the mornig Gerarde of Maulyn knew all this he took his horse
in the night and rode all alone to Dynant and was there a little before day.
Than he showed all the case to the lord Pyers Portbeuse captain of Dynaunt /
and as soon as it was day he assembled all the burgesses of the town in y^
common hall: and there Gerarde of Maulyne she wed them the matter in such wise
that they were all content to go forth / and so armed them and went toward
Fauet with a six thousand men of one and other. Sir Gaultier of Manny knew
thereof by a spy / than^e they couusayled together and co^sydred that it were
great danger for them if they of Dynant should come on the^ on the onesyde /
and sir Charles of Blois and his company on the other side: so they might be
enclosed. Tha^ they agreed to leave their co^panyons in prisone till another
time that they might amend it / and as they returned toward Hanybout / they
came to a castle called Gony lafo rest: the which was yielded up to sir Charles
of Bloyes a fyftene days before. Than sir Gaultier said how he would go no
farther as sore trayueled as he was / till he had made assaute to that castle
/ to se the demeanynge of the^ with in. There they made a fierce assaut and they
within quickly defended them self / sir Gaultier encouraged his company and
was ever one of theformast in somoche that the archersshotte so quyckely and so
close together / that there was none durst appear at their defense. Sir Gaultier
did somoche that part of the dyke was filled with busshes and wood / so that
they came to the walls with pyckaxes and other instruments / and anon made a
great hole through the wall. And there they entered perforce / and slew all they
found within and lodged there y^ night and they next day they went to Hanybout.

How sir Charles of Bloyes took the town of Carahes. Cap. lxxxvi.
When the countess knew of their coming she came and met them / and
kyssed and made them great chere: and caused all the noble men to dyne with her
in the castle. Now in this season sir Charles of Bloys had won Uannes / and
lay at sege at Carahes: the cou^tes of Mo^tfort and sir Gaultier of Manny /
sent certain messangers to the king of England / signyfieng him how sir
Charles of Bloys and the lords of France had conquered Uannes / Renes / and
diverse other good towns and castelles in Bretaygne / and was lickely to win
all with out he were shortly resysted. These messangers arrived in Cornwall
and rode to Wyndesore to the king.

Now let us speak of sir Charles of Bloys / who had so sore constrained with
assautes and ingens the town of Carahes / that they yielded them self up to
sir Charles / and he received them to mercy: and they swear to him homage and
fealty and took him for their lord. And there he made new officers / and
tarried there a fyftene days: tha^ they determined to go and lry siege to
Hanybout / yet they knew well the town was well fortifyed with sufficyent
prouisyon. And so thither they went and laid there siege / and the fourth day
after thither came sir Loys of Spain / who had layen in the town of Renes a
six wekes / in helyng of such hurtes as he had. He was well received there /
for he was a knight much honored and well-beloved among them. The french
company daily increased / for there were diverse lords and knights of France
were going into Spain ward for such wars as was between the king of
Spain / and the king of Granado sarasyne. And as these knyghts passed through
Poyctou and hard of these wars in Bretayne / drew that way: sir Charles of
Bloyes had rayred up against Hanybout a fyftene or sixtene great engyns / the
which cast into the town many a great stone. But they within set not much
thereby / for they were well defended there against them: and sometime they
would come to the walls and wype them in derysion / saying go and seek up your
company which rests in the feldes of Camperle: whereof sir Loys of Spain and
the genowayes had great dyspite.

How sir John^ Butler and sir Hubert of Fresnoy were rescued fro death before
Hanybout. Cap. lxxxvii.
ON a day sir Loyes of Spain came to the tent of sir Charles du Bloyes / and
desired of him a gift for all the service that ever he had done / in the
presence of diverse lords of France. And sir Charles granted him: because he
knew himself somoche bound to him / sir quod he I require you cause the two
knights that be in prison in Fauet to be brought hither / that is to say sir
John^ Butler and sir Hubert Fresnoy / and to give them to me to do with them at
my pleasure. Sir this is the gift that I desire of you: they have chased /
dysconfetted / and hurt me: and slain my nephue Alphons / I can not tell how
otherwise to be revenged of them / but I shall stryke of their heedes before
the town / in the sight of their companyons. Of these words ser Charles was a
basshed: and said certainly with right a goodwyll I woll give you ye prisoners /
sith ye have desired them. But surely it should be a shameful deed to put so
to death such two valyant knyghts as they be: and it shall be an occasyon to our
enemies to deal in likewise with any of ours if they fall in like case / and we
know not what shall daily fall: the chances of war be diverse. Wherefore dear
cosyn I require you to be better aduysed: than sir Loyes said / sir if ye keep
not promise with me / know ye for troth that I shall depart out of your company
/ and shall never serve nor love you again while I live. When sir Charles saw
none other bote: he sent to Fauet for the two knyghts / and in a morning they
were brought to sir Charles of Bloys tent but for all yt he could desire / he
could not turn sir Loyes of Spain fro his purpose: but said plainly that they
should be beheeded anon after dinner / he was so sore dyspleased with them. All
these words that was between sir Charles and sir Loyes for thoccasion of these
two knights / anon was come to the knowledge of sir Water of Manny by certain
spies that showed ye myschefe that these two knights were in / than he called
his company and took counsel what was best to do / some thought one thing /
some thought an other: but they wist not what remedy to synde. Than sir
Gaultier of Ma^ny said / sirs it should be great honor for us if we might
deliver out of danger yonther two knights and if we put it in adventure
though we fail thereof / yet king Edward our master woll can us much
thank therefore / and so woll all other noble men: that herafter shall here of
the case. At leest it shall be said how we did our deuoyre sirs this is mine
advise if ye woll follow it / for me thinks a man should well adventure his
body to save the lives of two such valyant knights. Mine advise is that we
deuyde our self into two parts / the one part incontinent to issue out at
this gate and to a range themself on the dykes to stir thoost and to
skirmysshe / I think that all the hole host woll come rennyng thither. And sir
Aymery ye shall be capytayne of that company / and take with you a.vi. thousand
good archers / and shre hundred men of arms: and I shall take with me a
hundred men of arms / and five hundred archers. And I will issue out at the
posterne covertly / and shall dasshe into the host a monge the lodgings be
hynde / the which I think we shall synde as good as void. I shall have such
with me as shall well bring me to the tent of sir Charles du Bloyes / where as
I think we shall find the two knights prisoners: and I ensure you / we shall
do our deuoyreto deliver them. This deuyse pleased them all / and incontinent
they armed them and about the hour of dinner sir Aymery of Clysson issued out
with his company and set opyn the chief gate toward the host and some of
them dasshed suddenly into thoost and cut down tents / and slew and hurt
diverse: thoost was in a sudden fray and in have armed them / and drew
toward thenglyssh men and bretons. Who fair and easily reculed back / there
was a sore skirmysshe and many a man overthrown on both parties / than sir
Aymery drew his people a long on the bykes within the barryers / and the
archers ready on both sides the way to receive their ennemys. The noise and
cry was so great that all ye hole host drew thither / and left their tents
void saving a certain varlettes. In the mean season sir Gaultier of Manny
and his company issued out at a posterne privily / and ca^e behind the host
and entered into the lodgings of the french lords / for there were none to
resyst the^ all were at the skirmysshe. Than^e sir Gaultier went straight to
sir Charles of Bloys tent / and found there the two knights prisoners / (...)
Hubert of Fresnoy / and sir John^ Butteler: and made them inco^tynent to leap
upon two good horses that they brought thither for the same intent / and
returned incontinent and entered again into Hanybout the same way they issued
out / the countess received them with great joy. All this season they fought
still at ye gate / than tidings came to the lords of France how the two
knyghts prisoners were rescued: when sir Loyes of Spain knew thereof he
thought him self dysceyued / and he demanded which way they were gone that
made that rescue / and it was showed him how they were entered into Hanybout.
Than^e sir Loyes departed fro the assaut and went to his lodging right sore
dyspleased / than all other left the assant: in there trayet there were two
knights that adventured them self so forward that they were taken by the
frenchmen the lord Landreman and the Chathelayne of Guyngnape / whereof sir
Charles of Bloyes had great joy / and they were brought to his tent and
there they were so preched to that they turned to sir Charles part / and did
homage and feaultie to him. The.iii. day after all the lords assembledde in
the lord Charles tent to take counsel / for they saw well that Hanybout was
so strong and so well fortifyed with men of warre^ that they thought they
should win but little there. And also the country was so wasted that they
wist not why there to go to forage and also winter was at hand wherefore they
all agreed to depart. Than they counsayled sir Charles of Bloyes that he should
send new prouisyons to all cities / towns / and fortresses / such as he had
won: and noble capitayns with good soudyours to defend their places fro
their enemies. And also if any man would treat for a trewse to Whytsontyde /
that it should not be refused.

TO this counsel every man agreed / for it was thau^e between saint Reymy and
All saints / the year of ourelorde god. M. CCC.xlii. Than every man departed /
(...) Charles of Bloys went to Carahes withal the lords of his party: and he
retained certain of the lords still with him / to counsel him in all his
business. And while he lay there on a day / a burges and a rich merchant of
Jugon was taken by the marshall sir Robert of Beannoys / and he was brought to
the lord Charles This burgess had all the rule in the town of Jugon under
the countess / and also he was well-beloved in the town. This burges was put in
fear of his life / he desired to be let pass for his ransom: how be it he
was so handled one ways and other / that he fell in a bargayn to betray the
town of Jugone and to leave opyn a certain gate / for he was so well be
trusted in the tawne that he kept the kayes when he was there This to
acomplysshe / he laid his son in hostage: and sir Charles promised to give
him five hundred pound of yearly rent / the day of poyntment came and the gate
was left opyn at n^ght and sir Charles and his company entered into the town
with great puyssaunce / the watch of the castle did perceive them: and he
began to cry a larum treason treason. They of the town began to styre and when
they saw that the town was lost / they fled to the castle by heaps / and
the burgess that had done the treason fled with the^ for a countenance. And
when it was day sir Charles and his company entered into the houses to lodge and
took what they would / and whan^e he saw the castle so strong and so full of
men / he said he would not go thens till he had it at his pleasure. Sir Gerard
of Rochfort captain of the castle perceived the burgess y^ had betrayed them
/ he took and hanged him over the walls: and when they consydred how sir
Charles had made a vow not to depert thens till he had the castle / and that
their prouysion would not serve them.x. days / they agreed to yield them:
their goods that was left and their lives saved / the which was granted them.
And so they made fealty and homage to sir Charles of Bloyes / and he
stablysshed captain there ye said sir Gerard of Rochfort and newely refresshed
the town and castle with me^ of war and ^uisyon. In this mean season
certain noble men of Bretayne spoke for a truse for a certain space / between
sir Charles of Bloyes and the countess of Mountfort / the which was agreed by
all their ayders and assisters: also the king of England sent for the
countess to come into England / and as soon as this trewse was confirmed the
countess took see and passed into England.

Of the feast and iustynge made at London by the king of England for the love
of the countess of Salisbury. Cap. lxxxix.
LE have well hard here before: how the king of England had great wars in
diverse countries / and had men of war in garysons to his great cost and
charge: as in Picardy / Normandy / Gascoyne / Xaynton Poycton / Bretayne / and
Scotland. ye have hard also before / how the king was stryken in love with
the countess of Salisbury / love quickened him day and night: her fresshe
beauty and godely demeanor was ever in his remembrance though therle of
Salisbury was one of the priuyest of his counsel / and one of them that had
done him best service. So it fell that for ye love of this lady / and for the
great desire that ye king had to se her: he caused a great feast to be cried
and a iustyng to be holden in the cyti of London in the mids of August / the
which cry was also made in Flaunders / in Heynault / in Braba^t and in France:
gyueng all co^mers out of every country safe conduct to come and go / and had
given in commandment through his own realm that all lords / knights /
squyers / ladies and domosels should be there without any excuse and commanded
expressly the earl of Salisbury that the lady his wife should be there / and to
bring with her all ladies and damsels of that country. Therle granted the
king as he that thought none yuell the good lady durst not say nay howbeit she
came sore against her will / for she thought well enough wherefore it was: but
she durst not dyscouer the matter to her husband she thought she would deal so
to bring the king fro his opynion. This was a noble feast: there was the earl
Wyllyam of Heynalt and (...) John^ of Heynalt his uncle / and a great nombre of
lords and knights of high lynage / there was great daunsynge and iustynge
the space of.xv. days / the lord John^ eldyst son to the vycount Beaumonde in
England was slain in the iustes. All ladies and damoselles were fresshely
besene according to their degrees / except Alys countess of Salisbury / for
she went as simply as she might: to the intent that the king should not set
his regard on her for she was fully determined to do no manner of thing that
should turn to her dishonor nor to her husbands. At this feast was sir
Henry with the wrye neck earl of Lancaltre / and sir Henry his son earl of
Derby / sir Robert Dartoyes earl of Rychmount / the earl of Northampton and of
Glocetter / the earl of Warwyke / the earl of Salisbury the earl of Penneforde
/ the earl of Hereford / the earl of Arundell / the earl of Cornwall / the
earl of ^uenforde / the earl of Suffolk / the baron of Stafforde: and diverse
other lords and knights of England. And at all these nobles departed / the
king received letters fro diverse lords of sundry contreis: as out of Goscoyne
/ Bayon / Flaunders fro Jaques Dartuell / and out of Scotland fro the lord
Rose and the lord Persy / and fro sir Edward Baylleull captain of Berwyke /
who sygnifyed the king that the scotts held but simply the trewse concludedd
the year before / for they newely assembled together much people for what intent
they could nattell. Also the captain in Poycton / Xanton / Rochell / and
Burdeloyes: wrote to the king how the frenchmen made great preparacions for
the war for the peace made at Arras was nere expyred wherefore it was time for
the king to take counsel and advise: and so he answered the messangers fro
point to point.

How the king of England sent sir Robert Dartoys into Bretayne. Cap. lxxxx.
AMong all other things the king of England would socoure the countess of
Mou^tfort / who was with the queen. Thanne the king desired his cosyn sir
Robert Dartoyes to take a certain nombre of men of war and archers and to go
with the countess into Bretayne. And so he did and they departed and took
shypping at Hampton / and were on the sea a great season because of contrary
wyndes. They departed about Ester at this great counsel at London the king was
aduysed to send to Scotland for the parfour maunce of a trewse to endure for
two or three years. Consydring that the king had somoche business in other
places / the king of England was loathe thereto / for he would have made such
war into Scotland that they should have been feign to have desired peace /
howbeit his counsel showed him such reasons that he agreed thereto. Among
other things his counsel said that it was great wisdom when a prince has
war in diverse plac^ / at one time to agree with one by truse / another to
pacify with fair words / and on the third to make war. Thanne was there a
bishop send on that legacyon / and so he went forth and in process
returned again and brought relacyon / how ye the king of scotts would agree
to no trewese without the agreement of the french king. Than the king of
England said openly / that he would never rest till he had so arrayed the
realm of Scotland that it should never be recovered: than he (...)maunded
that every man should be with him at Berwyke by Eester / except such as were
appointed to go into Bretayn. The feast of Ester came / and the king held a
great court at Berwyke / for the chief of the lords and knyghts of England
were there / and there tarried the space of three wyckes. In the mean season
certain good men labored between ye parties to have a trewse: and so there a
truse was agreed to endure for two year / and confyrmed by the french king.
Than every man departed and the king went to Wyndsore: than he send the lord
Thomas Hollande / and the lord John^ (...) Bayon with two hundred men of arms
/ andfour hundred archers to keep the fronters there.

Now let us speak of sir Robert Dartoyes / that year fell so hye that it was
nere to then(...)g of May / in the mids of the which month the trewse
between the lord Charles of Bloys and the countess of Mountfort should
expyre. Sir Charles of Bloyes was well (...)fyed of the purchase that the
countess of Mou(...) had made in England / and of the confort that the king
had promised her / for the which intent the lord Loyes of Spain / sir
Charles Germaux / and sir Oaths Dornes were laid on the sea about Gernzay with
a three thousand genowayes / and a thousand men of armmes / and.xxxii. great
ships.

Of the batell of Gernzay between sir Robert Dartoys and sir Loys of Spain on
the sea. Cap. lxxxxi.
SIr Robert Dartoyes earl of Rychmont / and with him therle of Pennefort / ye
earl of Salisbury / therle of Suffolk / therle of Quenfort / the baron of
Stafford the lord Spenser / the lord Bourchier: and diverse other knights of
England and their co^panyes / were with the countess of Mountfort on the sea.
And at last came before the isle of Gernzay: than they per^eyued ye great flete
of the genowayes / whereof sir Loys of Spaygne was chief captain. Than their
marynars said sirs arm you quickly / for yonder be genowayes and spaniardes
that woll set on you: than thenglysshmen sowned their trumpettes and reared up
their baners and standerdes with their arms and deuyses / with the baner of
saint George. And set their ships in order with their archers before / and
as ye wynd served them they sailed forth / they were a xlvi vessels great and
small: but sir Loys of Spaygne had.ix. greatter than any of the other / and
three galyes. And in the three galyes were ye three chief captains: as sir Loyes
of Spain sir Charles / and sir Oaths / and when they aproched nere together /
the genowayes began to shote with their crosbowes / and the archers of
England against them: there was sore shotynge between them and many hurt on
both parties. And whan^e the lords / knights / and squyers came nere together
there was a sore battle: the countess that day was worth a man / she had the
heart of a lion and had in her hand a sharp glayue / wherewith she fought
feersly. The spanyardes and genowayes that were in the great vessels / they
cast down great bars of iron and peaces of tymbre yt which troubled sore
thenglysshe archers: this battle began about the time of euynsonge and the
night departed them for it was very dark / so that one could scant know an
other. Than they withdrewe each fro other and cast ankers and abode still in
their harnes for they thought to fight again in the morning / but about
mydnight there rose such a tempest so horrible as though all the world should
have endedd. There was none so hardy but would gladly have been a land the
ships dasshed so together / that they went all would have ryuen in peaces. The
lords of England demanded counsel of their maryners what was best to do /
they answered to take land as soon as they might / for the tempest was so
great that if they took the sea / they were in danger of drownyng. Than they
drew up their ankers / and bare but a quarter sail / and drew fro that
place: the genowayes on the other side drew vpp^ their ankers and took the
deep of the sea for their vessels were greatter than thenglysshe ships /
they might better abide the brunt of the sea / for if the great vessels had
come nere the land they were lickely to have been broken. And as they deperted
they took four english ships laded with vytell and tayled them to their
ships / the storm was so hedeouse that in less than a day they were driven
a hundred leages fro the place where they were be fore / and the english
ships took a little haven not far fro the city of Uannes / whereof they
were right glad.

How sir Robert Dartoys took the city of Uannes in Bretayne. Cap. lxxxxii.
THus by this tourment of ye see brake and departed the batell on the sea /
bytwne sir Robert Dartoyes / and sir Loyes of Spain. No man could tell to
whom to give the honor / for they departed against both their wylles:
thenglysshmen took land not far of fro Uannes / and brought all their horse
and harnes a land / tha^ they devised to send their nany to Hanybout / and to
go theymselfe and ley siege to Uannes / therein were captayns sir Henry of Leon
and Olyuer of Clysson / and with them the lord of Turmyne / and the lord of
Loheac. When they saw thenglysshmen come to besiege them / they took good head
to their defenses both to the castle / and to the walls and gates: and at
every gate they set a knight with.x. men of arms and.xx. crosbowes.

Now let us speak of sir Loyes of Spayns and his company: they were sore
tourmented on thesee and in great danger all that night / and the next day
till noone: and lost two of their ships men and all. Than^e the third day
about prime the sea apeased: than they demanded of the maryners what part of
land was next / they answered the realm of Navarre: and that the wind
had driven them out of Bretayne more than sirscore leages / tha^ there they
cast anchor and above the fludde: and when the tide came they had good wind to
return to Rochell. So they costed Bayon / but they would not come nere it /
and they met four ships of Bayon coming fro Flaunders / they set on them
and took them shortly / and flewe all that were in them: than they sailed
toward Rochell / and in a few days they arrived at Gue^rande. There they
took land / and hard there how sir Robert Dartoyes lay at siege be fore
Uannes. Than they sent to the lord Charles of Bloyes to know his pleasure
what they should do / sir Robert Dartoys lay at siege with a thousand men of
arms / and three thousand archers and wasted all the country about / and
brent to Dynant and to Gony la Forest / so that none durst abide in the plain
country: there were many assautes and skirmysshes at the barryers of Uannes.
The countess of Mountfort was still with sir Robert Dartoys at the siege also
sir Gaultier of Manny who was in Hanybout delivered the keeping of the town to
sir Wyllyam Caducall and to sir Gerard of Rochfort: and took with him sir yues
of Tribyquedy / and a. C. men of arms / and. CC. archers: and deperted fro
Hanybout and went to the siege before Uannes. Than incon^ynent there was made a
great assaut in three places all at ones: ye archers shot so thycke that they
within scante durst apere at there defense / this assaut endured a hole day and
many hurt on both parties / against night thenglysshmen withdrue to their
lodgings. And they within in likewise sore weary of trayuell: and they unarmed
the^ / but they of the host without did not so for they kept on still their
harnes except their heed pieces / and so drank and refresshed them. And than by
the advise of sir Robert Dartoyes / they ordained again three batayls: and two
of them to assaute at the gates / and thethirde battle to keep themself prive
till the other two batayls had assailed long. So that all the strength of the
town should be there by all lickelyho^e to defend / tha^ it was ordained that
this third battle should set on the most feblest place of all the town
with ladders / ropes / and hokes of iron to cast on the walls. And as they
de^ysedde so it was done / sir Robert Dartoys with the first batell came and
made assaut in the night at one of the gates / and therle of Salisbury with ye
second batell at an other gate / and because it was dark to thyntent to make
them within the more abashed / they made great fires: so that the brightness
thereof gave light into the city. Whereby they within had wend yt their houses
had been a fire and cried treason / many were a bed to rest them of their
trayuell the day before and so rose suddenly and ran toward the light without
order or good array / and without counsel of their captayns: every man within
armed them Thus while they were in this trouble therle of Quenefort / and sir
Water of Manny with the third batell came to the walls where as there was no
defense made / and with their ladders mounted up and entered into ye town / the
frenchmen took no head of them they were so ocupyed in other places / till they
saw their ennemis in the streets. Than every man fled away to save
themself: the captayns had no leaser to go into the castle but were feign to
take their horses and issued out at a postern / happy was he yt might get out
to save himself: all that ever were seen by thenglysshmen were taken or slain
/ and the town over ron and robbed: and the countess and sir Robert Dartoyes
entered into yt town with great joy.

How sir Robert Dartoys dyed / and where he was buried. Cap. lxxxxiii.
THus as I have showed you the cite of Uannes was taken / and a five days
after the countess of Mountfort sir Gualtier of Manny sir yues of Tribiquedy:
and diverse other knights of england and of Bretayne returned to Hanybout and
therle of Salysbury / therle of Pennefort / therle of Suffolk / therle of
Cornwall / departed fro Uannes: fro sir Robert Dartoyes with three thousandemen
of arms / and three. M. archers / and went and laid siege to the city of
Renes. And sir Charles de Bloyes was departed thens but four days before /
and was gone to Nantes: but he had left in the city many lords / knights /
and squyers. And still sir Loys of Spain was on the sea / and kept so the
fronters against England / that none could go between England and Bretayne /
without great danger. They had done that year to England great damage / for
the taking thus of Uannes by thenglysshmen the country was sore abasshedde /
for they thought that there had been such capitaynes that had been able to
have detended de it against all the world / they knew well the town was
strong and well provided or men of war and artyllary / for this mysadnenture
sir Henry of Leon / and the lord Clysson were sore a basshedde / for their
enemies spoke shame against them. These two knights were so sore dyspleased
with the matter / that they get together a company of knights and soudyours:
so that at a day appointed they met before the city of Uannes / mothan.xii.
thousand of one and other: thither came the lord Robert of Beaumanoyre
marshall of Bretayn they laid sege to ye cite on all sides / and than assailed
it fersly. When (...) Robert Dartoys saw how he was besieged in the city /
he was not neglygent to keep his defense / and they without were fierce by
cause they would not that they that lay at siege at Renes / should not trouble
them. They made so feerse assaute and gave them within so much a do / that
they wan the barryers and after the gates / and so cutted into the city by
force. The englysshmen were put to the chase / and diverse hurt and slain:
and specially sir Robert Dartoyes was sore hurt / and scapedde hardely untaken
/ he departed at a posterne / and the lord Stafforde with him / the lord
Spencer was taken by sir Henry of Leon / but he was so sore hurt that he dyed
the third day after. Thus the frenchemen wanne again the city of Uannes /
and sir Robert Darteyes tarried a season in Hanybout sore hurt / and at last
he was counsayled to go into England to seek help for his hurtes: but he was
so (...) handled on the sea that his soores rankeled and at last landed and
was brought to London and within a short space after he dyed of the same
hurtes / and was buried in London in the church of saint Poule: the king did
as nobly his obsequy as though it had been for his own proper cosyne germayne
therle of Derby his death was greatly be moned in England / and the king of
England swear that he would never rest till he had revenged his death. And
said how he would go him self into Bretayne / and bring the country in
such case that it should not be recovered again in forty year after.
Incontinent he sent out letters throughout his realm: that every noble man and
other should come to him within a month after. And prepared a great navy of
ships / and at the end of the month he took the sea / and took landyng in
Bretayne not far fro Uannes / there as sir Robert Dartoyes ariyued / he was
three days a landyng of all his prouisyon: the.iiii. day he went toward
Uannes. And all this season therle of Salisbury and therle of Pe^broke were
lyeng at siege before Renes.

How the king of England came into Bretayne to make war there. Cap.
lxxxxiiii.
AFter the king of England had been a land a certain space / he went and
laid siege to Ua^nes. And with in the town there was sir O liver of Clysson /
and sir Henry of Leon / the lord of Turmyne / sir Geffray of Malestrayet and
sir Guy of Lohearc: they supposed well before that the king of England would
come into Bretayne wherefore they had provided the town and castle with all
things necessary. The king made a great assaut that endured half a day but
little good they did the cite was so well defended. Whan^e the countess of
Mountfort knew that the king of England was come / she departed fro Hanybout
accompanied with sir Gaultier of Manny: and diverse other knights and squyers /
and came before Ua^nes to se the king and the lords of thoost / and a four
days after she returned again to Hanyboute with all her own company.

Now let us speak of sir Charles of Bloyes who was in Nauntes / and as soon as
he knew that the king of England was aryued in Bretayne / he sent word thereof
to the french king his uncle desyring him of socour. When ye king of England
saw this cite so strong: and hard reported how the country there about was so
poor and so sore wasted / y^ they wist not where to get any forage / another for
man nor be. Tha^ he ordained to deuyde his nombre: first therle of Arundell
/ the lord Stafforde / sir water of Manny / sir yues of Tribyquedy: and sir
Rychard of Rochfort with.vi. C. men of arms / and vi. M. archers to keep still
the siege before Ua^nes / and to ride and distroy the country all about And the
king went to Renes / where he was joy fully received with them that lay at siege
there before / and had done a long season. And when the king had been there a
five days / he understood that sir Charles du Bloyes was at Nantes / and made
there a great assemble of men of war. Than^e the king departed fro Renes /
and left them ^^yll there that were there before to continue their siege. Than
the king ca^e before Nauntes and besieged it as far as he might / but he
could not lay round about / the cite was so great: the marshall of the host
rode abroad and distroyed great part of the country. The king ordained his
batellon a little mountain without the town / and there^^ryed fro ye morning
till is was noone / wenyng that sir Charles of Bloys would have issued out to
have given him battle: and when they saw it would not be they brewe to their
lodgyngs / the fore ryders ran to the baryers and skirmysshed and brent the
subbarbes. Thus the king lay before Nauntes / and sir Charles within: who wrote
to the french king the state of thenglysshmen. The french king had commanded
his son the duke of Normandy / to give aid to ser Charles of Bloyes: the
which duke was as than come to Angyers / and there made his assemble of men of
war. The king of England made diverse assautes to Nantes / but ever he lost of
his men and wanne nothing: and when he saw that by assautes he could do
nothing / and that (...) Charles would not issue out into the field to fight with
him: than he ordained therle of ^uenforte / sir Henry vycont of Beaumo^t / the
lord ^er^y / ye lord Rose / the lord Mombray / the lord Dalawarre / the
lord Raynolde Cobham: and the lord sir John^ Lysse / with six hundred men of
arms / and two hundred archers to keep still ye siege there: and to ride and
distroy the country all about. And than the king went and laid sege to the
town of Dynant / whereof sir Peter Portbeu^e was captain: the king made there
fierce assautes / and they within defended themself valyantly. Thus the king
of England all at one season had sieges lyeng to three cites / and a good town
in Bretaygne.

How sir Henry of Leon the lord Clysson / were taken prisoners before Uannes.
Cap. lxxxxv.
While the king of England was thus in Bretayne / wasting and distroyeng the
country: such as he hadlyeng at sege before Ua^nes gave diverse (...) / and
specially at one of the gats. And on a day there was a great assaut: and many
feats of arms done on both parties / they within set opyn the gate and came
to the baryers / because they saw the earl of Warwykes baner / and therle of
Arn^dels the lord Staffordes / and sir Water of Man's / aduenturyng themself
teopdously as they thought. Wherefore the lord Clysson / sir Henry of Leon: and
other adventured themself couragyously there was a sore skirmysshe / finally
the englysshmen were put back / than the knyghts of Bretayne opened the
barryes and adventured themself / and left sir knights with a good nombre to
keep the town / and they issued out after thenglysshmen: and thenglysshmen
reculed wisely and ever fought as they saw their auantage. Thenglysshmen
multiplied in such wise / that at last the frenchmen and bretons were feign to
recule back again to their town / not in so good order as they came forth:
than thenglysshmen followed the^ again and many were slain and hurt. They of
the town saw their men recule again and chased / than they closed their
barryers in so yuell a time / that the lord Clysson and sir Henry of Leon were
closed with out: and there they were both taken prisoners. And on the other
side the lord Stafforde was gone in so far / that he was closed in between
the gate and the baryes / and there he was taken prisoner / and diverse that
were with him taken and slain. Thus thenglysshmen drew to their lodgings /
and the bretons into the city of Uannes.

How the king of England took the town of Dynant. Cap. lxxxxvi.
THus as ye have hard these knights were taken on both parties / there was
no mo such assautes after. Now let us speak of ye king of England: who lay
at sege before Dynant / when he had layne there a four days: he gate a great
no^bre of bottes and barges / and made his archers to enter into them / and to
row to the pales: wherewith the town was closedde it had none other walls.
The archers shot so feersly yt non durst show at their defense / than was there
certain other with ares so that while the archers did shote they hewed down
the pales: and so entered byforce. Tha^ they of the town fled to the market
place but they kept but a small order for they that entered by the pales came to
yt gate and did opyn it: than every man entered and ye captain sir Pyers
Portbeufe taken / and the town over ron and robbed: the^glysshmen wan much
richesse in that town / for it was a great town of marchandyse. When the king
had taken his pleasure there / as long as it had pleased him: he left the town
void and went to Uannes and lodged there.

Now let us return to sir Loys of Spain / and to sir Charles Germaur and
ser Oaths Dornes / who was as than admyrall on the sea: with.viii. galeys /
xiii. barks / and.xxx. other ships with genowayes and spanyardes. They kept
the coost between England and Bretayne and did much damage to them that came
to refresshe the host before Uannes: and at a time they set on the king of
Englandes navy lyeng at Aucerre / in a little hauyn beside Uannes: so that they
slew a great part of them that kept the ships / and had done much more
damage if thenglysshmen lyeng at the siege had not ron thither in all have: and
yet asmoche have as they made / sir Loys of Spain took away iiii. ships
laded with prouisyon / and drowned three and all that was in them. Than the king
was counseled to draw part of his navy to Breast haven and the other part to
Hanybout the which was done / and still endured the siege before Uannes / and
Renes.

what lords of France the duke of Normandy brought into Bretayne / against the
king of England. Cap..lxxxxvii.
How let us return to the journey that the duke of Normandy made the same
season in Bretayne / to aid and confort his cosyn sit Charles de Bloyes. The
duke knew well: how the king of England had sore damaged the country of
Bretayn / and had besieged three cytes / and taken the town of Dynant. Than the
duke departed fro the city of Angyers: with mo than.iiii. M. men of arms /
and. rxx M. of other: he took they heygh way to Nauntes by the gyding of the
two marshals of France / the lord of Momorency and the lord of saint Uenant.
And after them rode the duke and therle of Alanson his uncle / therle of Bloys
his cosyn / the duke of Burbone was there therle of Ponthyeu / therle of Bolayne
/ ye earl of Uandome / therle of Da^martyne / ye lord of Craon / the lord of
Coucy / the lord of Suly the lord of Frenes / the lord of Roy: and so many
lords knights and squyers of Normandy / Dauuergne / Berry / Lymosen / Dumayn
/ Poicton / and Xaynton / that it were to long to rehearse the^ all: and daily
they increased. Tidings came to the lords that lay at siege before Nantes: yt
the duke of Normandy was coming thither with.xl. M. men of war. Inco^tynent
they sent word thereof to the king of England / than the king studied a little
and thought to break up his siege before Uannes / and also his siege before
Renes: and all together to draw to Nauntes. But than his counsel said to him
sir ye be here in a good sure ground and nere to your navy: and send for them
that lies at siege before Nantes to come to you and let the siege ly still
before Renes: for they be not so ferr of but they shall be ever ready to come to
you if need be: the king agreed to this counsel and so sent for the^ before
Nauntes and they came to him to Ua^nes. The duke of Normandy came to Nantes
where sir Charles de Bloys was / the lords loged in the city / and their men
abroad in the country: for they could not all lodge in the city nor in the
subbarbes.

How the king of England and the duke of Normandy were host against host
lodged before Uannes. Cap. lxxxxviii.
While y^ duke of Normandy was at Nauntes / the lords of England that lay at
siege before Renes. On a day made a great and a feerse assaut / for they had
made many instruments to as saut with all: this assaut enduredde a hole day /
but they wan nothing but lost byuers of their men: within the city was the
lord Dancenysi the lord of Pont ser John^ of Malatrayt yuan Charnell / and
Bertram Grasquyne squire: they defended the^ self so well with the bishop
of the city that they took no damage / how be it thenglysshmen lay there still
/ and over ran and wasted the country all about. Than the duke of Normandy
departed with all his host and drue toward Uannes the sooner to find his
ennemies / for he was informed how they of Uannes were in most ieopardy and
in peril of lesyng: than the two marshals went forth and sir Geffray of
Charney / and therle of Guynes constable of France made the areregarde. So
thus the frenchmen came to Uannes on the other side against there as the king of
England say / they lay a long by a fair medowe side and made a great dyke
about their host. The marshals and fore ryders often times skirmysshed toguyder
on both parties / than the king of England send for therle of Salisbury /
and therle of Pe^ broke / and the other that lay ar siege at Renes to come to
him / and so they did. Thenglysshemen and the bretous of that party were well
to the nombre of.ii. M. and.v. C. men of arms / and vi. M. archers / and.iiii.
M. of other me^ a foot: the frenchmen were four times as many well a perelled.
The king of England had so fortifyed his host / that the frenchmen could take
no advantage of him / and he made no mo assautes to the town / because of
sparyng of his me^ and artyllary: thus these two hoostes lay one against an
other a long season / till it was well on ward in winter. Than pope Clement
the sixth send the cardynall of Penester / and the cardynall of Cleremount to
entreat for a peace: and they rode often times between the parties but they
could bring them to no peace. In the mean season there were many skirmysshes:
and men taken / slain / and overthrown on both pties thenglysshmen durst not
go a foragyng / but in great co^panyes / for they were ever in great danger by
reason of busshmentes that were laid for them. Also sir Loyes of Spain kept so
the sea coost / that with much danger any thing came to thenglysshe host /
the frenchmen thought to keep the king there inmaner as be sieged. Also the
frenchmen endured much pain with wete and cold for day and night it rayned
on them / whereby they lost many of their horses and were feign to dyslodge and
lie in the plain feldes they had somoche water in their lodgings. At last
these cardynals did somoch that there was a truse agreed for three year / the
king of England / and the duke of Normandy swear to uphold the same without
brekyng / as the custom is in such like cases.

How the french king caused the heedes to be stryken of / of the lord
Clysson / and diverse other lords of Bretayne and of Normandy. Cap. lxxxxix.
THus this great assembly brake vpp^ / and the siege raised at Uannes: the duke
of Normandy went to Nantes and had with him ye two cardynals. And the king of
England went to Hanybout to the countess of Mountfort: there was an exchange
made between the baron of Stafford and the lord Clysson. When the king had
tarry ed at Hanybout as long as it pleased him / than he left there therle of
Penbroke / sir Wyllyam of Caducall and other: and than^e returned into
England about Christmas. And the duke of Normandy returned into France and
gave leave to every man to depart / and anon after y^ lord Clysson was taken
upon suspecyous of treason and was put into the chatelet of Paris / whereof
many had great marueyle: lords and knights spoke each to other thereof / and
said what matter is yt is laid against the lord Clysson / there was none could
tell: but some ymagined that it was false envy / because the king of England
bare more favor to deliver him (...) exchang rather than sir Henry of Leon who
was still in prison / because the king showed him y^ auantage his enemies
suspected in him perauen ture that was not true: upon the which suspect he was
be heeded at Paris without mercy or excuse / he was greatly be moned. Anon
after there were diverse knights were accused in semblable case: as the lord of
Maletrayt and his son / the lord of Uangor / sir Thybault of Morilon and
diverse other lords of Bretayne to the no^bre of.x. knights and squyers / and
they lost all their heedes at Paris. And anon after as it was said there was
put to death by famyne.iiii. knights of Normandy / sir Wyllyam Baron / sir
Henry of Maletrayt / ye lord of Rochtesson and sir Richard of Persy / whereby
after there fell much trouble in Bretayne / and in Normandy. The lord of
Clysson had a son called as his father was Olyuer he went to the countess of
Mountfort and to her son who was of his age: and also without father / for he
dyed as ye have hard before in ye castle of Lour in Paris.

Of the order of saint George that king Edward stablysshed in the castle of
wyndsore. Cap. C.
IN this season the king of England took pleasure to new reedefy the Castle
of wyndsore / the which was begone by king Arthure. And there first began
the table round / whereby sprange the fame of so many noble knights through
out all the world. Than king Edward deter mined to make an order and a
brotherhode of a certain nombre of knights / and to be called knights of the
blewe garter: and a feast to be kept yearly at wynsore on saint Georges day.
And to begin this order the king assembled together earls / lords / and

sailed to mentayne the ordr naunces such as were devised: and ye king made a

How the king of England delyuerd out of prison sir Henry of Leon. Cap. C.
(...).
While the king made this preparacion at wyndsore for this said feast /
tidings came to him how ye lord Clysson and diverse other lords had lost
their heedes in France / where with the king was sore dyspleased. In so much
that he was in purpose to have served sir Henry of Leon in like case whom he
had in prisonne but his cosyn the earl of Derby showed to him before his
counsel such reasons to assuage his ire and to refrain his cou rage. Saying
sir though that king Philyppe in his have has done so foul a deed as to put
to death such valyant knights* yet sir for all that blemysshe not your
nobleness / and sir to say the troth your prisoner ought to bear no blame for
his deed / but sir put him to a resouable raunso^e Than the king sent for the
knight prisoner to come to his presence / and than said to him a sir Henry: sir
Henry / mine adversary Philyppe of Ualoyes has showed his feleny right cruel
/ to put to death such knights / wherewith I am sore dyspleased / and it is
thought to us that he has done it in dyspite of us. And if I would regard his
malice I should serve you in like manner / for ye have done me more dyspleasure
/ and to mine in Bretayne than any other person: but I woll suffer it and let
him do his worst / for to my power I woll keep mine honor / and I am content
ye shall come to a light ransom for the love of my cosyn of Derby / who has
desired me for you / so that ye woll do that I shall show you. The knight
answered and said / sir I shall do all that ye shall command me: than said the
king I know well ye be one of the richest knights in Bretaygne / and if I
would sore cease you ye should pay me.xxx. or.xl. M. ^^utes / but ye shall go
to mine adversary Philypp^ of Ualoyes: and show him on my behalf / that sith
he has so shamefully put to death so valyant knights in the dispyte of me /
I say and woll make it good he has broken the truse / taken by twene me and
him: wherefore also I renownce it on my part and defye him fro this day
forewarde. And so that ye woll do this message yo^ ransom shall be but.x. M.
scutes / the which ye shall pay and send to Bruges within.xv. days after ye
he past the sea / and moreover ye shall say to all knights and squyers of
those parts that for all this they leave not to come to our feast at wyndsore
/ for we would gladly se them and they shall have sure and save conduct to
return ^v. days after the feast. Sir said the knight to the best of my
power I shall accomplysshe your message / and god reward your grace for the
courtessy ye show me / and also I humbly thank my lord of Derby of his
goodwyll. And so sir Henry of Leon departed fro ye king and went to Hampton /
and there took the sea / to thyntent to arryue at Har^^ewe: but a storm took
him on the sea which endured systene days / and lost his horse which were
cast into the sea: and sir Henry of Leon was so sore troubled that he had
never health after / how be it at last he took land at Crotoy. And so he and
all his company went a foot to Abuyle and there they get horses / but sir Henry
was so sick that he was feign to go in a lytter: and so came to Paris to king
Philypp^ and did his message fro point to point / and he lived not long after /
but dyed as he went into his country: in the city of Angyers god assoyle his
soul.

How the king of England sent therle of Derby to make war into Gascoyne.
Cap. C.ii.
THe day of saint George approached that this great feast should be at Wynsore /
there was a noble company of earls / barownes / ladies / and damoselles /
knights / and squyers: and great tryumphe / iustynge / and tournayes / the
which endured fyftene days: and thither came many knights of diverse contreis
/ as of Flanders / Heynalt / and Brabant / but out of France there came none.
This feast during / diverse newse came to the king out of diverse contreis
thither came knights of Gascoyne: as ye lord of Les^are / the lord of
Chaumount / the lord of Musydent* send fro the other lords of the country
such as were english: as the lord de / Labreth / the lord of Punye^s / the
lord of Mountferant / the lord of Du^as / the lord of Carton / the lord of
Grayly and diverse other: and also there were sent messangers fro the cytte of
Bayon / and fro Bourdeaux. These messangers were well feested with the king
and with his counsel / and they showed him how that his country of Gascoyne
/ and his good city of Bourdeaux were but febly conforted / wherefore they
desired him to send thither such a captain and such men of war / that they
might resyste against the frenchemen / who were in a great army and kept the
feldes. Than the king ordained his cosyn the earl of Derby to go thither and he
to be as chief captain / and with him to go therle of Penbroke / therle of
Quenforde / the baron of Stafforde / sir Gaultier of Manny / the lord Franque
de la Hall / the lyeure de Brabant / sir Hew Hastynges / sir Stephyn de Tombey
/ the lord of Manny / sir Rychard Haydon / the lord Normant of Fynefroyde /
(...) Robert of Lerny / sir John^ Norwyche / sir Richard Rocklefe / sir Robert
of Quenton / and diverse other / they were a five hundred knights and squyers /
and two thousand archers: the king said to his cosyn therle of Derby / take
with you gold and silver enough / ye shall ^at lack: and depart largely
thereof with your men of war / whereby ye shall get their love and favor.
Than the king ordained sir Thomas Daugorne into Bretaygne / to the countess
of Mountfort to help to keep her country for all the peace that was taken /
for he douted that the french king would make war because of the message
that he sent him by sir Henry of Leon. And with him he sent a hundred men of
arms / and two hundred archers: also the king ordained therle of Salisbury /
and therle Dulnestre into the north ^ties with a hundred men of arms / and
six hundred archers for the scotts had rebelled again to him / and had brent
in Corn wall / and run to Bristowe / and besieged the town of Dulnestre.
Thus the king sent his men of war into diverse places / and delyuerd the
captayns gold and silver sufficyent to pay their wages and to retain soudyers
/ and so every company departed as they were ordained.

Now first let us speak of therle of Derby for he had the grettest charge /
he took shypping at Hampton / and sailed till he aryued at Bayon a good town
and a strong city / the which had long been english. They landed there the
sixth day of June / in ye year of our lord. M.iii. C.xliiii. there they were
well received and tarried there a seuyn days / and the eight day departed and
went to Bordeaux / where they were received with solemn processyon. And the
earl of Derby was lodged in thabbay of saint Andrewe and when the earl of
Laylle the french kings lyeutenant in those parties understood of the coming
of thenglysshmen: he send for therle of Comyges / the earl of Pyergourt / the
earl of Carman / the vycount of Uyllemure / the earl of Ualentenoyes / therle
of Myrande / the earl of Duras / the lord of Maryde / the lord Delabard / the
lord of Pycornet / the vycont of Chastellone / the lord of Newcastell / the
lord of Lestyne / the abbot of saint Silver: and all other lords such as
held of the french party. And when they were all together / than^e he
demanded counsel on the coming of therle of Derby / they answered how they
thought themself strong enough to keep the passage at Bergerate over the river
of Garon: the which saying pleased well therle of Layll who as than was in
Gascoyne as king under ye french king and had kept that country as long as the
war had endured / and had taken diverse towns and castles fro thenglysshmen /
than these lords sent for men of war fro all parties and went and kept the
subbarbes of Bergerate / the which were great and enclosed with the river of
Garon.

How the earl of Derby conquered Bergerathe. Cap. C.iii.
When therle of Derby had been at Burdeuxa.xv. days / he understood how these
lords and knights of Gascoyne were at Bergerath. In a morning he drew
thyderward / and he caused sir Gaultier of Manny and sir Franque de Hall to go
before / who were marshalles of his host: that morning they rode three leages
to a castle that was english called Mounterolyer but a little leage fro
Bergerath / there they tarried all that day and that night. The next morning
their currours ran to the varryers of Bergerath / and at their return they
reported to sir Gaultier of Manny how they had seen part of the demeanor of
the frenchemen / the which they thought to be but simple. That morning
thenglysshmen dyned be times: and as they satte at dinner sir Gaultier of Manny
beheld therle of Derby and said / sir if we were good men of arms we should
drink this evening with the french lords being in Bergerath quod therle and
for me it shall not be let: wha^ every man hard that they said let us go arm
us / for we shall ride incontinent to Bergerath there was no more to do / but
shortly every man was armed and a horseback. When the earl of Derby saw his
company so well wylled he was right ioyeouse / and said let us ride to our
ennemies in the name of god and saint George so they rode forth with their
baners displayed in all the heat of they day / till they came to the vaylles
of Bergerath / the which were not easy to win: for part of the river of
Garon went about it. When the frenchmen saw thenglysshmen come to assail them
/ they said among themself how they should sone be driven back / they
issued out in good order. They had many of the villayns of the country ill
armed / the englysshmen approached and the archers began to shote fiers^y: and
when those fotemen felt the arowes light among them / and saw the baners
and standerdes wave with the wind the which they had not been acustomed to se
before. Than they reculed back among their own me^ of arms / than
thenglysshmen of arms aproched and dasshed in among their enmys and ^lewe and
beat down on every part for the frenchmen of arms could another aproche
forward nor backewarde for their own fotemen / who reculed without order and
did stop the^ their way there were many slain and sore hurt the^glysshe
archers were on both sides the way and shot so holly together / that none
durst approach nor issue through them. So the frenchmen were put a back into
the subarbes of Bergerath / but it was to such a myschefe for them that the
first bridge and baylles were won by clean force: for thenglysshmen entered
with them / and there on the pauement many knights were slain and sore hurt
/ and diverse prisoners taken of them that aduentuted theymselfe to defend the
passage: and the lord of Mirpoyse was slain under sir Gaultier of Man's
baner who was the first that entered. When therle of Layll saw that the
englysshmen had won the subbarbes and slain his men without mercy / he than
reculed back into the town and passed the brige with great trouble and danger
/ before yt bridge there was a soreskirmysshe / the lords and knights fought
hand to hand: the lord of Manny auaunced himself so far among his
enemies / that he was in great danger. Thenglysshmen took there the vycount of
Bousquetyne / the lord of Newcastell / the lord of Chastellon / the lord de
Lescu / all other of the frenchmen entered into the town / and closed
theirgates and let down their portcolyse. And than went to the walls to
their defenses / this assaut and skirmyssh endured till the euenyng: than
thenglysshmen withdrue right sore weary and entered into ye subbarbes / the which
they had won: where they found wine and v^tayle sufficye^t for their hole
host for two months. The next morning the earl of Derby caused his
trumpettes to be sowned / and set his people in order of battle and aproched
the town and made a sore assaut / the which endured till noone: little did
thenglyssh men at that assaut for they within defended themself valyantly / at
noone the englysshmen with drew / for they saw well they did but lose their
pain. Than the lords went to counsel and determined to assaut the town by
water / for it was closed but with pales / than therle of Derby send to the
navy at Bordeaux for ships / and there was brought fro Bordeaux to
Bergerath.lx. ships and barks. The next day in ye evening they ordered their
batayls and in the next morning by the son rysinge the navy was ready to assaut
by water / the baron of Stafford was captain: thenglysshmen and archers
adventured them self valyantly / and came to a great barryer before the pales
/ the which anon was cast down to the yerth: thanne they of the town came to
therle de Laylle / and to the other lords and knights that were there / and
said sirs take heed what ye woll do: we be in a great iedpardy to be all lost.
If this town be lost ^oe lose all that we have and our lives also: yet hit
were better that we yielded ourselfe to the earl of Derby than to have more
damage. The earl of Laylle said / go we to the place where as needs most
defense / for we will not as yet yield vpp^ the town: so they went to defend
the pales. The archers that were in the barks shot so holly together / that
none burst apere at their defense without they were slain or sore hurt: there
were within a two hundred genowayes crosbowes / and nere were pauysshed
against the shot / they held the english archers well awarke all the day
/ and many hurt on both parties: finally the englysshmen did somoche that they
brake down a great pane of ye pales / than they within reculed back / and
desired a treaty and a t^ew^e the which was granted to endur all that day and
the nextnyght / so that they should not fortify in the mean season. So either
party drew to their lodgings: this night the lords within the town were in
great counsel / and finally about mydnight they trussed bag and baggage /
and departed out of the town of Bergerath / and took the way to the town of
Ryoll / the which was not far fro thens. The next morning the englysshmen
again entered into their barks and came to the same place where they had
broken the pales / and there they found certain of the town who desired the^
that they would pray the earl of Derby to take them to mercy / saving their
lives and goods and fro thensforthe they would be obeysaunt to the king of
England. The earl of Quenefort and therle of Penbroke said they would speak
gladly for them: and so they came to the earl of Derby and showed him thyntent
of them of the town. The earl of Derby said / he that mercy desires mercy
ought to have / bydde them opyn their gates / and she we them they shall be
assured of me and all mine. These two lords went again to them of the town /
and showed them the earl of Derbyes intent: than they assembled all the people
toguyder and sowned their belles and opyned their gates / and issued out men
and women in processyon: and humbly met the earl of Derby / and so brought
him into the chief church / and there swear faith and homage to the earl /
in the name of the king of England / by virtue of a procutacyon that the earl
had.

How the earl of Derby conquered diverse towns and fortresses in high
Gascoyne. Cap. C.iiii.
THe same day that therle of Laylle was come to Ryoll fro Bergerate / he and
his company devised to depart themself / some into one fortress and so^e into
an other: and to keep fronter war. And the seneshall of Tholouz / the earl of
Uyllemure were sent to Auberoche / sir Bertrame de Press to Pellagrewe / the
lord Phylippe of Dyone to Mount agret / the lord of Mountbrandone / to
Mauldurane / Arnolde of Dyone to Mountgyse / Robert of Malmore to Beaumount in
Laylloes sir Charles of Poyters to P^nnes in Agynoes. Thus these knights were
divided fro garyson to garyson / and the earl of Laylletaryed in the Ryoll /
and new repaired the fortress. And whau^e the earl of Derby had ta^yed in
Bergerath two days / he demanded of the seneshal of Burdeaur what way was
best for him to take / for he said he would natte lie still: the seneshall
answered how he thought it best to draw to Pyergourt / and into high
Almaygne. Than the earl of Derby prepayred to depart / and left captain in
Bergerathe sir John^ dela Sante. And as the^glysshmen went forward they came
to a castle called Lango: whereof the veigneur of Tholouz was captayn there
thenglysshmen tarried and gave assaut to the castle / because they said they
would narte leave such a castle behind them / but at that assaut the
englysshmen wanne but little. The next day the assauters brought fagottes /
timber / and other things: and filled so the d^kes that they might go to the
walls. Than sir Fra^que de Hall counsayled them within to yield: for he said
they might abide so long yt it should be to late. They within desired respyte
to give an answer / the which was agreed: and when they had counsayled the
parties greed / so they deperted with their lives / but they bare a way no
thing and went to Mousacke. Therle of Derby made captain at Lango a squire
called Aymone Lyone / and with him.xxx. archers: than therle rode to a town
called le Lack / and they of the town met him on the way and brought him the
kayes / and did homage to the king of England. Than therle went forth / and
came to Mandurant / the which he wanne with assaut: when he had set rulers
there / he went to the castle of Mountgyse and took it also by assaut / and
the captain he send as prisonere to Bordeaux / than he rode to Punache the
which also he wanne / and also the castle de la Lewe: and there he tarried three
days / the fourth day he went to Forsathe and wanne it lightly / and also the
tower of Pondayre: than^e he came to a great to wne called Beaumount in
Laylloyes / parceyninge to the inherytaunce of the earl of Laylle: three days
the earl of Derby lay there and made great assautes / the place was well for
tifyed with men of war and artillery: how be it finally it was won / and
many of them with in slain. Than therle of Derby set there new captayns and
men of war / and fro thense he went to the chief to wne parteyninge to the
earl of Laylle: whereof the lord Philyppe of Dyone / and Arnolde of Dyone were
capitayns. The englysshmen approached to the barryers / and the archers shot
so quickly: so that they of the town durst not appear at their defense. So
the first day they baylles hard to the gate of the town was won / and in
the evening the assaut seaced and every man drew to their lodgings. The next
morning the assaut began again in diverse places / so that they with in wist
not well what to do: than^e they desired to have a peace / than an haraulde was
send to them and a day respyte to treat in the mean season: than^e the earl
of Derby him self went to the barryers to speak with them of the town / and
with him was the baron of Stafforde and the lord of Manny. Therle would they
should have yielded themself simply / but they so agreed that the town should
be under the obeisance of the king of England: and that they should send
twelfe of their burgesses into the city of Burdeaur for hostage. And the
lords and knights of France departed under save conduct and went to the
Ryoll.

How therle of Quenfort was taken in Gascoyne / and delyuerd again by
exchaung. Cap. C.v.
AFter this conquest the earl of Derby went to Bonu all / and there made a
great assaute and many hurt on both parties: finally it was taken^e and new
refresshed with captains and men of war. Than therle passed farther into the
cou^tie of Pyergourt / and passed by Bordall without any assaute: and labored
so long that at last he came before Pyergourt. Therle of that country was in
the town / and the lord Roger of Quenfort his uncle / and the lord of Duras
with a sixscore knights and squyers of the country. The earl of Derby aduysed
how he might best assail the town to his advantage / for he same well it
was strong: so that all things consydred it was thought not best to enploy
his people there in that ieopardy. And so went and lodged a two leages thense
by a little river / to the intent to assail the castelle of Pelagrue / about
mydnight issued out of Pyergourt a two hundred spears / and are it was day
they came into the lodgings of thenglyssh men and slew and hurt many: and
came into the earl of Quenfortes tent and found him armynge / and he was so
sharply assailed that he was taken prisoner and three other of his house. Than
the gascoyns went back or the host were more styred / and drew again to
their town as it was needful for them: they found their gates opyn / for
they were hotely pursued and driven home into their barryers. Than the gascons
a lyghted / and defended their barryers and fought hand to hand: so that they
lost nothing. Than thenglysshmen returned to their host: and the earl of
Derby went to Pelagrue and there was six days and made many great assautes /
there was the delyuerance made of the earl of Quenfort and his company by
exchang / for the vycount of Bonquentyne / the vycount of Chastellone / the
lord of Lescue / and of the lord of Newcastell: on the condycion that the
lands of Pyergourt should abide three years in rest and peace / but the lords
and knights of the country might well arm themself with out any forfette /
but nothing to be robbed and brent within the country during that space. Thus
thenglysshmen departed fro before Pelagrue / for that pertayned to the county
of Pyergourt / than the earl of Derby went to Auberoche a fair castle and a
strong / pertayninge to the bishop of Tholouz. Thenglysshmen lodged
theymselfe there about / as though they were minded to abide there a long
space: and did send them word within to yield themself for if they were
taken byforce / they were all but deed without mercy: they within had great
dout of their lives and they saw no socour coming fro no party: than they
yielded themself and became subgettes to the king of England. Than the earl of
Derby drew toward Bordeaux / and left in garyson in Aube coche sir Fra^que de
la Halle / and sir Alayne of Fynefroyde and sir John^ of Lynedall. Than^e in
his way he came to a good town called Lyburne / twelfe leages fro Bordeaux and
laid siege about it / and said how he would not depart thense till he had
it. They within took counsel / so that all things consydred: the good and
yuell they yielded them to therle of Derby and did homage / and there therle
tarried a three days: and left the earl of Penbroke / the lord Stafforde / sir
Stephyn of Courey / and sir Alysander Hausayle still in Lyborne: than therle of
Derby*the earl of Quenfort / sir Gaultier of Manny / and other rode straight to
Bourdeaux.

How therle of Layle laid siege before Auberoche. Cap. C.vi.
AT the retournynge of therle of Derby to Bourdeaux: he was ioyefully received
and met with processyon / and offeredde him every thing in the town at his
pleasure: there he tarried and sported him with the burgesses / ladies / and
damsels of the town. Now let us speak of the earl of Laylle who was at the
Ryoll: whan^e he understood that the earl of Derby was at Bordeaux and lay
still / and no lickelyhode that he would stir any farther that season. Than
he wrote to the earl of Pyergourt / of Carmaynye / of Couynes / and of
Breuniquele: and to all the other lords of Gascoyne of the french party /
that they should assemble their men / and come and mete him before Auberoche /
for his mind was to ley siege thereto: they all obeyed him for he was as king
in those parties of Gascoyne. The lords and knights within Auberoche was not
ware of any siege till it was laid round about them / so that none could issue
out nor enter without parceyuinge. The frenchemen brought with them four great
engyns fro Tholouz / the which did cast day and night / they made no other
assaut: so within six days they had broken the roffes of the towers and
chambers / that they within durst not abide but in low vautes: the intent of
them of the host was to slay them all within / or else to have them yield
simply. Therle of Derby had knowledge how the siege lay before Auberoch / but
he knew not that his company were so sore oppressed as they were. When sir
Franque de Hall / sir Aleyne de Fyneforde / and sir John^ of Lyndall / who were
thus besieged within Auberoche / saw themself thus hardly bestadde: they
demanded among their varlets if their were any for a good rewar de would bear
a letter to therle of Derby to Bur deux / one varlet stepped forth and said he
would gladly bear it not for the advantage of his reward / but rather to help
to deliver them out of danger. In the night the varlette took the letter
sealed with their seals / and thanne went down the dykes and so past through
the host / there was none other remedy: he was met with the first watch and
past by them for he spoke good gascoyne and named a lord of the host and said
he parteyned to him / but than again he was taken among the tents / and so
brought into the heart of the host / he was sherched and the letter found on
him: and so he was kept save till the morning that the lords were assembled
together. Than the letter was brought to therle of Layle: they had great joy
when they perceived that they within were so sore constrained that they could
not long endure than they took the varlet and hanged the letter about his neck
and did put him into an engyn / and did cast him into the town. The varlette
fell down deed / wherewith they within were sore troubled / the same season
therle of Pyergourt / and his uncle sir Charles of Poyters and the vycount of
Carmany / and the lord of Duras were a horsbacke / and passed by the walls of
the town as nere as they might: and cried to them within and said in mockery:
sirs demand of your messanger where he found therle of Derby sith he went
out but this night / and is returned again so shortly. Than sir Fra^que de
Hall said sirs though we be here in closed / we shall issue out when it shall
please god and the earl of Derby: as would to god he knew in what case we be
in / for and he knew it there is none of you that durst keep the field / and
if ye would send him word thereof / one of us shall yield himself prisoner to
you to be raunsomed as a gentylman ought to be / the frenchmen answered nay nay
sirs / the matter shall not go so. The earl of Derby shall know it well enough
/ when with our engyns we have beaten down the castle to the yerthe / and
that ye have yielded up simply for saving of your lives. Certainly quod sir
Franque we shall not yield our felfe so we woll rather dye here within: so the
frenchmen returned again to their host and the three english knights were
sore abashed / for y^ stones y^ fell in the town gave so sore strokes that it
seemed like thondre falled fro heuyn.

How therle of Derby took before Auberoch therle of Layle and diverse other
earls and vycountes / to the no^bre of.ix. Cap. C.vii.
ALl the matter of taking of this messa^ger with the letter and necessytie of
the^ with in Auberoch was showed to the earl of Derby / by a spy that had been
in the french host. Than therle of Derby sent to the earl of Penbroke being
at Bergerath to mete with him at a certain place / also he send for the lord
Stafforde and to sir Stephyn Tombey being at Lyborne / and the earl himself
with sir Gaultier of Manny / and his company rode toward Auberoche: and rode
so secretly with such guydes as knew the country / that therle came to
Lyborne and there tarried a day abydinge the earl of Penbroke: and when he saw
that he came not he went forth for the great desire that he had to aid them in
Auberoch. Thus therle of Derby / therle of Quenforde* sir Gaultier of Manny /
sir Rychard Hastynges / sir Stephyn Tombey / the lord Feryers and the other
issued out of Lyborne: and rode all the night and in the morning they were
within two little leages of Auberoche. They entered into a wood / and lyghted
fro their horses and tied their horses to pasture / abydinge for the earl of
Penbroke: and there tarried till it was noone. They wyste not well than what to
do / because they were but three hundred speres / and six hundred archers: and
the frenchmen before Auberoch were a.x. or.xii. thousand men: yet they thought
it a great shame to lose their co^panyons in Auberoche / finally sir Gaultier
of Manny said: sirs let us leap on our horses and let us coost under the
covert of this wood till we be on the same side that joins to their host /
and when we be nere put y^ spurs to the horses and cry our cries / we shall
enter while they be at supper: and unware of us ye shallse them be so
dysconfited that they shall keep none array. All the lords and knights agreed
to his saying: than every man took his horse and ordained all their pages and
baggage to abide still there as they were: so they rode still a long by the wode
/ and came to a little river in a vale nere to y^ french host. Than they
displayed their baners and prnons / and dasshed their spurs to their horses
and ca^e in a front into the french host among the gascoyns / who were
nothing ware of that busshment. They were going to supper and some ready set
at their meat: thenglysshmen cried a Derby a Derby / and ouerthrewe tents and
pauylions and slew and hurt many: the frenchmen wist not what to do they were
so hasted / when they ca^e into the field and assembled together. They found
the english archers there ready to receive them / who shot so feersly that
they slew man and horse / and hurt many: therle of Layll was taken prisoner in
his own tent and sore hurt / and the earl of Pyergourt and sir Roger his
uncle in their tents / and there was slain the lord of Duras / sir Aymer of
Poyeters / and therle of Ualentenoys his brother was taken / every man sledde
that might best: but therle of Conynes / the vycount of Car main and of
Uillemny / and of Bru^quell / and y^ lord de la Board and of Taryde^ and other
that were loged on the othersyde of the castle dreme back / and went into
the feldes with their baners. Thenglysshmen who had overcome all y^ other
basshed in feersly among them there was many a proper feat of arms done / many
taken and rescued again: when they within the castle hard that noise without
/ and saw thenglysse baners and penons. In contynent they armed them and
issued out / and russhed into y^ thyckest of the preace / they greatly
refresshed the englysshmen that had fought there before: where to should I make
long process / and tho of therle of Laylles party were nygh all taken or
slain if the night had not come on / there had but few scapedde: there were
taken that day what earls and vycountes to the nombre of.ix. and of lords /
knights / and squyers taken / so that there was no englysshman of arms / but
that had.ii. or.iii. prisoners. Thisbatell was on saint Larans night / the year
of our lord. M. CCC.xl. and four: thenglysshmen dealt like good co^panyons
with their prisoners / and suffered many to depart on their oath and promise to
return again at a certain day to Bergerath / or to Bordeaux. Than the
englysshmen entered into Auberoche / and there the earl of Derby gave a supper to
the most part of the earls and vycou^tes prisoners / and to many of the
knights and squyers: the^glysshmen gave land to god / in y^ that a thousand
of them had overcome.x. M. of their enemies / and had rescued the town of
Auberoche / and saved their co^panyons that were within: who by all lickely hod
should have been taken within.ii. days after. The next day anon upon son
rising / thither came therle of Penbroke with his company a three hundren spe res
/ and a four thousand archers. Thatie he said to therle of Derby certainly
cosyn ye have done me great vncourtesy to fight with our enemies without me:
seeing that ye sent for me / ye might have been sure I would not fail to come
fair cosyn quod therle of Derby / we desired greatly to have had you with us /
we tarried all day till it was ferr past no one. And when we saw that ye came
not we durst not abide no longer / for if our enemies had known of our
coming they had been in a great advantage over us / and now we have the
advantage of them I pray you be content and help to gyde us to Bordeaux. So
they tarried all that day and the next night in Auberoche: and the next day be
times they departed and left captain in Auberoche a knight of Gascoyne called
Alysander of Chamont / this they rode to Bordeaux and led* with them the
most part of their prisoners.

Of the towns that therle of Derby wanne in Gascoyne going toward the Ryoll.
Cap. Cviii.
THey of Burdeux wist not what joy to make: nor how to receive therle of Derby
and sir Gaultier of Man ny / for the taking of the earl of Laylle and mo than
two hundred knights with him. So thus passed that winter without any more
doing in Gascoyne that ought to be remembered and when it was past Eester / in
the year of our lord. M. CCC.xlv. In the mids of May* therle of Derby who
had layne all that winter at Bordeaux / made a great assemble of men of arms
and archers / to the intent to go and lay siege to the Ryoll / the first day
fro Burdeux he rode to Bergerath where he found therle of Pe^broke / who had in
like wise made his assembly: there they tarried three days / and than departed
and nombred their company and found how they were. M. men of arms / and two.
M. archers: than they rode so long till they came to saint Basyll and laid
siege thereto. They within consydred how the greattest men and most part of
Gascoyne were prisoners / and saw how they should have no socoure fro no
part: so all things consydred they yielded themself / and did homage to the
king of England. Than therle passed forth and took they way to Aguyllone: and
in his way he found the castle of Rochemyllone / the which was well
furnysshed with soudyers and artyllary / howbeit therle of Derby commanded to
give assaut and so the^ was a ferse assaut. They within cast out great bars
of iron and pottes with lyme / wherewith they hurt diverse englysshmen such as
adventured themself to far: when therle saw his m^hurt and could do nothyng^
he withdrue the assaut. The next day he made the vyllayns of the country to
bring thither fagottes / busshes / donge / s^rawe / and earth / and filled part
of the dykes: so that they might go to the walls: and so they made. CCC.
archers ready / and. CC. men of the country to go before them with pauysshes /
and having great pycares of iron: and while they did undermine the wall the
archers should shote / and so they did that none within durst apere at their
defense. This assaut endured the most part of the day / so that finally the
myners made a great hole through the wall: so that ten men might enter a front.
Thanne they within were sore a basshed / some fled into the church and sum
stale away by a prive gate: so this town and castle was taken / robbed / and
the most part slain / except such as were fled into the church * the
which therle of Derby caused to be saved / for they yielded themself simply.
Thau therle set there new captayns two en(...) squyers / Richard Will and
Robert (...): than therle went to Mountsegure and lay^ siege thereto / and
tarried there a fyftene day ^s / captain within was sir Hew Bastefoll / and
every day there was assaut and great engyns were brought thither ^ro Bordeaux /
and fro Bergerath: so that the stones (...) they cast brake down walls /
roffes / and houses. Therle of Derby send to them of the town / showing them
that if they were taken byforce they should all dye: and if they would come
under they obeisance of the king of England he would pardon them all / and
take them for his friends. They of the town would gladly have yielded them /
and went and spoke with their captain in manner of cou^^^yle to se what he
would say: and he answered them and said sirs keep your defense / we are able
to keep this town this half year if need be. They departed fro him in semyng
well content but at night they took and put him in prison saying how he
should never go out thereof without so be he would agree to make their peace with
therle of Derby / and when that he had sworn that he would do his deuoyre:
they let him out of prison / and so he went to the barryers of the town and
made token to speak with the earl of Derby / sir Gaultier of Manny was there
present and he went and spoke with him. The knight said sir Gaultier of Manny /
ye ought natte to have marueyle though we close our gates against you * for we
have sworn feaultie to the french king: and I se well that there is no person
in his behalf that will stop you of your way / but me think ye are like to
go farther. But sir for my self and for the men of the town I desire you
that we may abide in co^posicyon / that ye make us no war nor we to you the
space of a month: and during that term if the french king or the duke of
Normandy come into this country so strong as to fight with you / than we to be
quyte of our covenant: and if they come not or one of them / than we shall put
us under (...) obe^ sance of the king of England. Sir Gaultier of Manny went to
therle of Derby to know his pleasure in that behalf / therle was content so
that they within should make no fortifycation in that season: and also y^ if any
of the^glysshmen there lacked any vitayls / that they might have it of them for
their money. To this they were content / and sent* xii. burgesses of the town
to Bordeaux in hostage: than thenglysshmen were refresshed with prouisyon of
the town / but none of them entered. Than they passed forth and wasted and
exyled the country / the which was pleasant and fruitful / and came to a
castle called and guyllon / and the captain thereof came to therle and yielded
up the castle / their lives and good^ saved. Whereof they of the country had
great marueyle / for it was named one of the strongest castles of the world /
and wha^ the captain that had yielded up the castle so soon came to Tholoum /
the which was.xvii. leages thense / they of that town took him and laid
treason to his charge and hanged him up. The said castle stood between two
great ryuers able to bear ships / y^ earl of Derby new repeyred y^ castle
and made captain there sir Joh^ of Gombray: tha^e the earl went to an other
castle called Segart / the which he took by assaut / and all the soudyours
within slain / and fro thense he went to the town of le Ryoll.

How therle of Derby laid siege to the Ryoll / and how that the town was
yielded to him. Cap. C.ix.
THus the earl of Derby (...) before the Ryoll and laid siege thereto on all
sides / and made bas^y^es in the feldes and on the waye^^ / so that no
prouisyon could enter into the town / a(...)he every day there was assaut: the
siege ^^^ured a long space. And when the month was e^^yred that they of Segur
should give up their town / the earl sent thither and they of the ^owne gave up
and became under the obeysaunce of the king of England / the captain sir
Hew Bastefoll became servant to the earl / with other that were within / upon
certain wages that they had. Thenglysshmen that had lye^ long before the
Ryoll more than nine wekes / had made in the mean space two belf^oys of great
tymbre with.iii. stages / every belfroy o^ fou^ great whelys and the sides
toward the town were covered with cure boly to defend them fro fire and fro
shot. And into every stage there were ^oynted. C. archers / by strength of men
these two belfroyes were brought to the walls of the town / for they had so
filled the dykes that they might well be brought just to the walls. The
archers in these stages shot so holly tog^der that none durst apere at their
defense without they were well pauysshed / and between these two belfroys there
were a. CC. men with pycaxes to mine the walls / and so they brake through the
walls. Thau^e the burgesses of the town came to one of the gates to speak
with some lord of the host / when the earl of Derby knew thereof he sent to
them sir Gaultier of Manny and the baron of Stafforde: and when they ca^e there
they found that they of the town would yel^e them their lives and goods
saved. Sir Ago^s de Bans who was captain within knew that ye people of the
town would yield up / he went into the castle with his company of soudyers /
and while they of the town were entrety^g / he conveyed out of the ^owne great
quantyte of wine and other prouisyon / and than closed the castle gates: and
said how he would not yield up so so^e. The foresaid two lords returned to
therle of Derby / showing him how they of the town would yield themself and
the town their lives and goods saved: thau^e therle send to know how the
captain would do with ye castle / a^^ it was brought word again to him how
he would not yield. Than therle ^^udye^ a little* said well go take them of
the town to mercy / for by the town we shall have the castle / thau^e these
lords went again to them of the town and received them to mercy / so that
they should go out into the field and deliver therle of Derby the kayes of the
town / saying sir fro heusforth we knowledge our self subgettes and obey
saunt to the king of England. And so they did and swear that they should give
no comfort to them of the castle / but to grieve them to the best of their
powers: than therle commanded that no man should do any hurt to the town of
Ryoll / nor to none of them within. Than therle entered into the town and
laydsiege round about the castle as nere as he might / and rered up all his
engyns the which cast night and day against the walls / but they did little
hurt the walls were so strong of hard stone: it was said that of old time
it had been wrought by the hands of the sarasyns who made there warkes so
strongely that there is none such now a bays. Wha^ the earl saw that he
could do no good with his engyns he caused them to cease / than he called to
him his myners: to thyntent that they should make a mine under all the walls /
the which was not sone made.

How sir water of Manny found in the town of the Ryoll the sepulcre of his
father. Ca. C.x.
While this siege endured / and that ye myners were a work: the lord Gaultier
of Manny remembered how (...) his fader was stayne going a pylgrimage to sait
James. And how he hard in his youth / how he should be buried in the Ryoll
or there about: thau^e he made it to be enquered in the town is there were any
manne could show him his fathers tomb / he should have a hundred crowns for
his labor. And there was an aged man came to sir Gaultier and said / sir I
think I ca^^e bring you nere to the place where your father was buried: thanne
the lord of Manny said if your words be true I shall keep covenant and
more. Now ye shall here the manner how the lord Gaultiers father was slain:
it was true that sometime there was a bishop in Cambresis / a Goscoyne borne
/ of the house of Myrpoyse. And so it fortuned that in his days / there was at
a time a great tournayeng before Cambrey: where as there were.v. C. knights on
both parties: and there was a knight gascoyne ^ourneyed with the lord of Manny
father to sir Gaultier / and this knight of Gascoyne was so sore hurt and
beaten that he had never health after but dyed: this knight was of kynne to the
said by stho^^e. Wherefore the lord of Manny was in his (...) and of all his
lynage / a two or three year after certain good men labored to make peace
between the^ / and so they did. And for a mendes the lord of Manny was bound
to go a pylgrimage to saint James and so he went thither ward: and as he came
foreby the town of Ryoll / the same season therle Charles of Ualoyes brother
to king Philyppe / lay at siege before the Ryoll / the which as than was
english: and diverse other towns and cities than pertaining to the king of
England father to the king that laid siege to Tourney. So that the lord of
Manny after the retournyng of his pylgrimage: he came to se therle of Ua^oys
who was there as king and as ye lord of Many went at night to his lodgyng / he
was watched by the way by certain of the^ of the lynage of him yt the lord of
Ma^ny had made his pylgrimage for. And so without therles lodgyng he was slain
and murdered and no man knew who did it / how be it they of that lynage were
held suspect in ye matter but they were so strong and made such excuses that
the matter past / for there was none that would pursue the lord of Man's
quarrel. Than therle of Ualoyes caused him to be buried in a little chapel in
the field / the which as than was without the town of Ryoll: and when therle
of Ualoyes had won the town / than the walls were made more larger / so
that the chapel was within the town. Thus was sir Gaulter of Man's fader
slain and this old man remembered all this matter / for he was present when he
was buried. Than^e sir Gaultier of Manny went with this good aged man to the
place where as his father was buried and there they found a little tomb of
marble over him / the which his servants laid on him after he was buried.
Than^e the old man said: sir surely under this tomb lies your father than
the lord of Manny read the scripture on the tomb the which was in latin /
and there he found yt the old man had said troth: and gave him his reward.
And wtin two days after he made the tomb to be raised and the bones of his
father to be taken up and put in a ^ofer: and after did send them to
Ualence^nes in the county of Heynalt. And in the freres there made them to be
buried again honorably / and did there his obsequy ^yght goodly / the which
is yet kept yearly.

How the earl of Derby wanne the castle of the Ryoll. Cap. C.xi.
Now let us return to the siege about the castle of the Ryoll / the which
had endured.xi. wekes / so long wrought the mynours that at last they came
under the base court / but under the do^geon they could not get for it stood
on a hard rock. Than sir Ag^us des Bans their capten / said to his company:
sirs we be vndermy^^d so that we are in great danger / than they were all sore
a srayed / and said sir ye ar in a great danger and we also / without ye find
some remedy year our chief and we will obey you trucly / we have kept this
house right honorably alonge season. And though we now make a composycion we
can not be blamed / assay if ye can get grant of therle of Derby to let us
depart / our lives and goods saved: and we to deliver to him this castle.
Than sir Agous dyscendedde down fro the high to wre / and did put out his heed
at a little wyndo * and made a token to speak with some of the host: than he
was demanded what he would have / he said he would feign speak with therle of
Derby or with ye lord of Ma^ny. When therle knew thereof he said to ye lord
of Manny and the lord Stafforde / let us go to the fortress and know what
the capten woll say. Than they rode together / and when sir Agous saw them he
took of his cappe and saluted them each after other / and said lords it is of
troth that the french king send me to this town / to defend and to keep it
and the castle to my power. And ye know right well how I have aquyt my self
in that behalf / and yet would if I might: but always a man may not abide in
one place / sir if it woll please you I and all my company would depart our
lives and goods saved / and we shall yield unto you the fortress. Than therle
of Derby said / sir Agous ye shall not go so away: we know right well we have
so sore oppressed you that we may have you when we list / for your fortress
stands but upon stays: yield you simply and we will receive you / sir Agons
said: sir if we did so I think in you somoch honor and gentylnes (...) ye
would deal but courtelly with us / as ye would the french king should deal
with any of your knights / for goddessake sir blemyssh not your nobleness for
a poor sort of soudyours that be here within / who has won with much pain
and paryll their poor lyueng: whom I have brought hither out of the prouynce
of Sauoy / and out of Daulphyne / sir know for truth yt if the lest of us
should not come to mercy as well as the best / we woll rather sell our lives in
such wise that all the world should speak of us / sir we desire you to bear
us some company of arms and we shall pray for you. Than therle and the other
two lords went a part and spoke together / they spoke long together of diverse
things finally they regarded the truth of sir Agons / and consydred how he
was a stranger: and also they saw that they could not undermine the dongeon /
they agreed to receive them to mercy Than the earl said to sir Agons: sir we
would gladly to all strangers bear good company of arms: I am content that ye
and all your company depart with your lives saved / so that you bear away
nothing but your armoure. So be it quod sir Agons / than he went to his
company and showed them how he had spedde. Than they did on their harness and
took their horses whereof they had no mo but six / some bought horses of
thenglysshmen / the which they paid for truly. Thus sir Agons de Bans
departed fro the Ryoll and yielded up the castle to the englysshemen / and sir
Agons and his company went to Tholous.

How therle of Derby took the town of Mauleon / and after the town of Franch
in Gascoyne. Cap. C.xii.
When the earl of Derby had taken his pleasure at Ryoll: than he went forth and
lest an englyssh knight at Ryoll to repair and a mende that was broken / and
he rode to Mountpesance and made assaut there / and within there were but men
of the country that were gone thither with their goods / in trust of the
strength of the place: and so they defended theymselfe as long as they might /
but finally the castle was wone with assaut and by scalynge / but there were
many of thenglysshe archers slain / and au english gentylman slain called
Richard of Pennenort / he bare the lord Staffordes baner. Therle of Derby
gave the same castle to a squire of his called Thomas of Lancastre: and left
with him in garyson.xx. archers / than therle went to the town of Mauleon and
made assaut / but he wanne it not so / at night there about they lodged: the
next day a knight of Gascone called sir Alysander of Chamont said to therle /
sir make as though ye would dyslodge and go to some other part / and leave a
small sort of your people still before the town and they within woll issue out
I know them so well and let them chase your men that be behind: and let us
lie under the olyues in a busshement / and when they be past us let part of
us follow them and some return toward the town. Therle of Derby was
content with that counsel / and he caused to abide behind the earl of
Quenforde with a hundred with him all only / well informed what they should
do: than all the other trussed bag and baggage / and departed and went half
a leage / and there laid sir Gaultier of Manny with a great busshme^t in a vale
among olyues and vynes: and therle rode on forth / when they of Mauleon saw
the earl depart and some still abydinge behind / they said among themself
let us go issue out and go and fight with our enemies that are abydinge behind
their master / we shall soon dysconfet them / the which shall be a great
honor and profette to us / they all agreed to that opynion and armed them
quickly and issued out who might first / they were a four hundred: When therle
of Quenfort and his company saw them issue they reculed back / and the
frenchemen followed after in great have / and so ferr they pursued them that they
past the busshme^t / than sir Gaultier of Mannyes company issued out of their
busshme^t and cried Manny / and part of them dasshed in after the frenchmen /
and another part took the way straight to ye town / they found the baylles
and gates opyn / and it was night: wherefore they within wend it had been their
own company that issued out before. Tha^ thenglysshmen took the gate and the
brige and incontinent were lords of the town: for such of the town as were
issued out / were enclosed both before and behind / so that they were all
taken and slain: and such as were in ye town did yield them to therle of
Derby / who received them to mercy / and of his gentylnes respyted the town
fro brennyng and robbynge. And did give that hole seignorie to sir Alysaunder
of Chamount / by whose aduyce the town was wont and sir Alysaunder made a
brother of his captain there called Antony of Chamont / and therle left with
him certain archers and other with pauysshes: than therle departed and came to
Wyelfra^che in Agenoys / the which was won by assaut and the castle also: and
he left there for captain a squire of his called Thom^s Coq^ Thus therle rode
all about the country and no man resysted him / and conquered towns and
ca(...) / and his men wanne riches marvel to esteem.

How therle of Derby wanne the city of Angolesme. Cap. C.xiii.
When the earl of Derby had this town at his pleasure / thasie herod to
Myremo^t drawyng toward Burdeux: for all this journey his currours never
aproched to port saint Mary. Therle was three days before Myremont and on the
fourth day they yielded / therle gave it to a squier of his called John^
Bristowe / and after his men wan a little town closed / standing on the river
of Gerone called Thomynes / and after the strong castle of Damassene / the
which they well garnysshed with men of arms and archers. Than they came
before the city of Angolesme and laid siege thereto / and therle said he would
not depart thense till he had it at his pleasure: than^e they within made
apoyntment with the earl to send.xxiiii. of their chief burgesses to Burdeur
in hostage for the respyte of a peace for a month / and if with in that space
the french king do send a suffycie^nt person to keep the field against
therle of Derby: than they to have again their hostages and to be quyte of
their bond / and if not than they to put them under the obeysaunce of the
king of England. This done: thasie the earl rode to Blames and laid siege
thereto / within were two captayns of Poycton / sir Guysshart Dangle and sir
Wyllyam^ de Rochchouart: and they said they would yield to no man. And while
this siege endured some of the englysshemen rode to Mortayne in Poycton / where
as sir Boucyquant was captain / and made there a great assaut but it auayled
not: but diverse of them were hurt and slain / and so departed thens and went
to Myrebell and to Alney. And after came again to the siege of Blames: every
day there was some feate of arms done / the term of the month erpyred that
they of Angolesme should yield. The earl of Derby sent thither his two marshals
/ to whom they of the cite swear homage and fealty in the behalf of the king
of England: and so they were in peace and had a gain restored their hostages.
And the earl sent thither at their desyers John^ of Norwyche to be their
captain / still the siege endured before Blasmes / so that thenglysshmen were
half weary / for winter approached and there they could win nothing: than
they determined to go to Bourdeaux till another season / and so they dyllodged
and went over Gerande and so to Bordeaux / and than deperted his people into
diverse garysons to keep fronter war.

How sir Godfray Harecourt was banysshed out of France. Cap. C.xiiii.
IN this season sir Godfray of Harecourt fell in the indygnation of the french
king / who was a great baron in Normandy and brother to therle of Harecourt /
lord of saint Savior the vycount / and diverse other towns in Normandy. And
it was said all was but for envy: for a little before he was as great with the
king and with the duke of Normandy as he would desire but he was as than openly
banysshed the realm of France / and if the king could have get him in his
ire / he would have served him as he did sir Olyuer of Clyssone / who was
beheeded the year before at Paris. This ser Godfray had some friends who gave
him warnyng secretly how the king was dyspleased with him: than he avoided the
realm as soon as he might and went into Brabant to the duke there who was his
cosyn / who received him joyfully. And there he tarried alonge space and lived of
such revenues as he had in Brabant for ^ut of France he could get
nothing. The king had seaced all his lands there of Constantyne / and took
the profet thereof himself: the duke of Brabant could in no wise get again
this knight into the kings favor / for nothing that he could do. This
dyspleasure cost greatly the realm of France after: and specially the country
of Normandy / for the tokens thereof remained a hyndred year after / as ye shall
here in this history.

Of the death of Jaques Dartuell of Gaunt. Cap. C.xv.
IN this season raygned in Flaunders in great prosperyte and puysaunce Jaques
Dartuell of gau^t / who was as great with the king of England as he would
desire: and he had promised ye king to make him lord and herytour of Flanders
/ and to endewe his son the prince of Wales therewith. And to make the count^e
of Flanders a duke dome: for the which cause (...) feast saint John^ Babtyst /
they year of our lord god. M. CCC.xlvi. the king of England was come to
Sluse with many lords and knights / and had brought thither with him ye young
prince his son / on the trust of the promise of Jaques Dartuell. The king
withal his navy lay in the hauyn of Sluse and there he kept his house / and
thither came to vysette him his friends of Flaunders: there were great
counsaylles between the king and Jaques Dartuell on the one pertie / and the
counsayls of the good towns of Flaunders on the other party. So that they of
the country were not of the agreement with the king / nor with Jaques Dartuell:
who preched to them that they should disheryte the earl Loyes their own
natural lord / and also his young son Loyes / and to enheryte the son of
the king of England / the which thing they said suerly they would never agree
unto. And so the last day of their counsayll / the which was kept in the
hauyn of Sluse in the kings great ship called the Katheryne / there they
gave a fynall answer by common acorde: and said sir / ye have desired us to a
thing that is great and weyghtie / the which herafter may sore touch the
country of Flaunders and our heirs: trewely we know not at this day no
person in the world that we love the preferment of so much as we do yours:
but sir this thing we cannat do alone / without that all the co^mynaltie of
Flaunders acorde to the same sir we shall goo home and every man speak with his
company generally in every town / and as the most part agree we shall be
content: and within a month we shall be here with you again / and than^e give
you a full answer / so that ye shall be content. The king nor Jaques Dartuell
could as than have none other answer / they would feign have had a short day
but it would not be. So thus deperted that counsel and every man went home to
their own towns / Jaques Dartuell tarried a little season with the king / and
still he promised the king to bring them to his intent: but he was disceyued /
for as soon as he came to Gau^t he went no more out again: for such of Gaunt
as had been at Sluse at the counsel there / when they were returned to Gaunt
or Jaques Dartuell was come into the town / great and small they assembled in
the market place: and there it was openly showed what request the king of
England had made to them by the setting on of Jaques Dartuell: than every man
began to murmr against Jaques / for that request pleased them nothing / and
said that by the grace of god there should no such untruth be found in
them / as willingly to disheryte their natural lord and his issue / to
enheryte a stranger. And so they all departed fro the market place not content
with Jaques Dartuell. Now behold and se what fortune fell / if he had been as
welco^e to Gaunt as he was to Bruges and Ipre / they would agreed to his
opinyon as they did: but he trusted somoche in his prosperyte and greatness /
that he thought soon to reduce the^ to his pleasure. When he returned he ca^e
into Gaunt about noone: they of the town knew of his coming / and many were
assembled toguyder in the street where as he should pass / and whasie they
saw him they began to murmr and began to ron together three heedes in one hood
and said / behold yonder great master who woll order all Flaunders after his
pleasure / the which is not to be suffered. Also their were words sown
through all ye town how Jaques Dartuell had.ix. year assembled all the
revenues of Flaunders without any count given: and thereby has kept his
estate. And also send great richesse out of the country into England
secretly: these words set them of Gaunt on fire / and as he rode through the
street he parceyued that there was some new matter against him / for he saw
such as were wont to make reverence to him: as he came by he saw them
turn their backs toward him / and enter into their houses. Than he began to
doubt: and as soon as he was a lyghted in his lodgyng he closed fast his gates /
doors / and wyndose. This was skante done* but all the street was full of men
/ and specially of them of the small crafts: there they assailed his house
both behind and before / and the house broken up: he and his within y^ house
defended themself a long space and slew and hurt many without / but finally
he could not endure* for three parts of the men of the town were at that
assaut. When Jaques saw that he was so sore oppressed: he came to a wyndowe
with great humylite barcheeded / and said with fair langage: good people what
ayleth you / why be you so sore troubled against me. In what manner have I
dyspleased you / show me and I shall make you amends at your pleasures: than
such as hard him answered all with one voice / we woll have acompt made of
the great tresure of Flaunders / that ye have send out of the way without any
tytell of reason: than Jaques answered mekely and said / certaynely sirs of
the tresoure of Flaunders I never took nothing / withdraw your selfys
pacie^tly into your houses / and come again to morrow in the morning / and I
shall make you so good acompt that of reason ye shall be content. Than^e all they
answered and said: nay we woll have acompt made incontinent / ye shall not
escape us so: we know for truth that ye have send great richesse into
England without our knowledge. Wherefore ye shall dye: whan^e he hard that
word he joined his hands together and sore weeping said / sirs such as I am ye
have made me: and ye have sworn to me or this / to defend me against all
persons / and now ye would slay me without reason^ ye may do it and ye woll /
for I am but one man among you all / for goddessake take better aduyce. And
remember the time past: and consider the great graces and curtesyes that I have
done to you ye would now render to me a small reward for the great goodness
y^ I have done to you / and to yo^ town in time past: ye know right well
marchanutdyse was nighe lost in all this country / and by my means it is
recovered: also I have governed you in great peace and rest for in y^ time of
my gouernyng ye have had all things as ye would wysshe / corn / richesse and
all other marchaundyse. Than they all cried with one voice: come down to us
and prech not so high / and give us acompt of the great treasoure of Flaunders
/ that ye have governed so long without any acompt making / the which
parteyneth not to an offycerto do: as to receive the goods of his lord or of
a country with out acompt. When Jaques saw that he could not apease them: he
drew in his heed and closed his wyndowe / and so thought to steal out on the
backesyde / into a church that joined to his house: but his house was so
broken that.iiii. hundred persons were entered into his house: and finally there
he was taken and slain without mercy / and one Thom^s Denyce gave him his
death stroke. Thus Jaques Dartuell endedde his days: who had been a great
master in Fla^ders / poor men first mounteth up / and unhappy men sleeth them
at the end. These tidings anon spredde abroad the country: some were sorry
thereof / and some were glad.

IN this season therle Loyes of Flaunders was at Teremounde: and he was right
ioyouse when he hard of the death of Jaques Dartuell his old ennemy* howbeit
yet he durst not trust them of Flaunders / nor go to Gaunt. When the king of
England who lay all this season at Sluse: abiding the answer of the
fle^mynges / hard how they of Gaunt had slaynr Jaques Dartuell his great
friend he was sore dyspleased. Inco^tynent he departed fro Sluse and entered
into the sea: sore thretnyng the flemmynges and the country of Flaunders / and
said how his death should be well revenged. Than the counsayls of the good
towns of Flaunders ymagined well how the king of England would be soore
dyspleased with this deed: thau they determined to go and excuse themself
specially they of Bruges / Ipre / Courtra / Andewarpe / and of Francke: they
sent into England to y^ king for a salve conduct / that they might come to
their excuse: the king who was as than somewhat aswaged of his dyspleasure
granted their desire than there ca^e into England men of estate out of the
good towns of Flanders except of Gau^t this was about the feast of saint
Mychaell / and the king being at Westmynster beside London. There they so
mekely excused them of the death of Jaques Dartuell / and swear solemly y^ they
knew nothing thereof till it was done: if they had he was the man that they
would have defended to the best of their powers / and said how they were
right sorry of his death / for he had governed the country right wisely. And
also they said: that though they of Gaunt had done that deed / they should
make a sufficyent amends / also saying to the king and his counsel / that
though he be deed: yet the king was never the farther of fro the love and
favor of the^ of Flaunders / in all things except the inherytaunce of
Flaunders / the which in no wise they of Flaunders woll put a way fro the right
heirs. Saying also to the king: sir ye have fair issue both sons and
daughters / as for the prince of Wales your eldest son / he can not fail
but to be a great prince without the inherytaunce of Flaunders. Sir ye have a
young daughter: and we have a young lord / who is herytoure of Flaunders / we
have him in our keeping: may it please you to make a marriage between them two.
So ever after the county of Flaunders shall be in the issue of your child:
these words and such other apeased the king / and finally was content with
the ^^emmynges / and they with him: and so little and little the death of
Jaques Dartuell was forgoten.

Of the death of wyllm^ earl of Heynault / who dyed in Freese and many with
him. Cap. C.xvi.
IN the same season the earl Wyllyam of Heynalt being at siege before the
town of Dautryche / and there had lain a long season: he constrained them
so soore / what by assautes and otherwise / that finally he had his pleasure
of the^: and anon after in the same season about y^ feast of saint Remy. The
same earl made a great assemble of men of arms / knights and squyers of
Heynault / Flaunders / Brabant / Hollande / Guerles / and Jullyers: the earl
and his company departed fro Dordreche in Hollande / with a great navy of
ships. And so sailed to wards Freese: for the earl of Heynault claymed to be
lord there / and if the fresons had been men to have brought to reason: therle
in deed had there great right / but there he was slain and a great nombre of
knights and squyers with him. Sir John^ of Heynault aryued not there with his
nephue / for he aryued at another place: and when he hard of the death of his
nephue like a man out of his mind he would have tought with the fresons: but
his servants and specially sir Robert of Gluues / who as thanne was his squire
/ did put him into his ship again / against his will. And so he returned
again with a small company / and came to ^^ou^t say^it Gertrude in Hollande /
where the lady his nece was / wife to the said earl named Iahane eldest daughter
to the duke of Brabant: and than she went to the land of Buyche / the which
wass her endowrie. Thus y^ county of Heynall was void a certain space: and
sir John^ of Heynalt did govern it unto the time that Margaret of Heynault
daughter to therle Aubertcame thither and took possessyon of that heritage: and
all lords and other did to her feaultie and homage. This lady Margaret was
married to y^ lord Loyes of Bauyer emperor of Almayne and king of Romans.

How sir John^ Heynalt became french. Cap. C.xvii.
Anon after the french king entreated and caused the earl of Bloys to entreat
this lord John^ of Heynalt to become french / promysing to give him more
revenues in France than he had in England / to he assigned where he would
himself deuyce. To this request he did not lightly agree for he had spent all
the flower of his youth in the scruyce of the king of England: and was ever
well-beloved with the king. When therle Loyes of Bloyes / who had married his
daughter and had by her three sons: Loyes / John^ / and Guy / saw that he
could not win him by that means / he thought he would assay an other way / as
to win the lord of Saguynels / who was chief company on and grettest of
counsel with the lord John^ of Heynault. And so they between the^ devised to
make him believe that they of England would not pay him his pencyon / wherewith
sir John^ of Heynault was sore dyspleased / so y^ he renounced his service /
and good will that he bare to the king of England. And when the french king
know thereof incontinent he sent sufficyent messangers to him / and so retained
him of his counsel with certain wages / and recompensed him in France /
with asmoche or more than he had in England.

Of the great host that the duke of Normandy brought into Gascone against
therle of Derby. Cap. C.xviii.
THe french king was well infourmed of the co^questes that the earl of Derby
had made in the country of Gascone / thanne he made a great sommons: that all
noble and not noble able for the fear of war should be at Orlyaunce / and at
Bourges and there about / at a certain day lymytted by reason of this
commandment came to Paris duke Odes of Burgoyne his son: and therle of
Arthoys and of Colayne: they ca^e to the king with a thousand spears. Than^e
came the duke of Burbone / and therle of Ponthyeu his brother / with a great
nombre of men of arms / thither also came the earl of Ewe and of Guynes
constable of France with a great company: also therle of Tankernyll / the
dolphyne of Auuerne / therle of Forestes / therle of Dampmartyne / therle of
Uandone / the lord of Coucy / the lord of Craon / the lord of Sully / the
bishop of Bewuayes / the lord of Frennes / the lord of Beauiewe* the lord
John^ of Chaalon / the lord of Roy and diverse other: they all assembled in
the city of Orlyaunce / they of that part of Loyre: and they of Poycton / of
Xaynton / of Rochell of Caoursyn / and Lymosyn they met in y^ marches of
Tholouz. So all these passed forth toward Roueryng: and they found much more
company assembled in the city of Rodes / and in the marches of Auuerne / and
Prouence. So at last they all came to the cite of Tholouz / and there about:
for they could not be all lodged in the city / for they were in nombre mo than
a hundred thousand. This was in the year of our lord god. M. CCC.xlv. anon
after the feast of Christmas the duke of Normandy / who was chief of that host
/ rode forth with his two marshals before him / the lord of Momore^cy / and
the lord saint Uenant. First they went to the castle of Myremont / the which
the englysshmen had won before: and captain wtin was one John^ Bristowe /
there they made assaut within were a hundred englysshme^. And with the
frenchmen was sir Loyes of Spain with genowayes crosbowes / who sparedde no
shot: so that they within the castle could not defend them self / but
that the castle was won and they all take and slain with the captain: than
the marshals set there new men / than they passed forth and came to vile
Franche in Agenoyes. There all the host laid siege and assay led the town /
at y^ season the captain sir Thomas Corque was not there / he was at Bordeaux
with therle of Derby who had sent for him Howbeit they within defended
themself valyantly: but finally they were taken perforce / and the town
robbed and brent / and slain y^ most part of the soudyers: than the host
drew to the city of Angolesme and laid siege there / capytayne within was a
squire called John^ Normell. When therle of Derby hard of this great host /
and how they had won again Myr mount / and Uyle Franche: and brent y^ town
and left the castle void / than he sent four knights with threscore men of
arms / and three hundred archers to Uyle Franche to enter into the castle /
and to close the gates again of the town / and promised them that if the
frenchmen came thither again to assail them / he would socoure the^ what
soever fell thereof. And so these four knights: that is to say sir Stephyn
Co^bey / sir Richard Heldone / sir Raffe Hastynges / and sir Normant of
Fynfroyde / went thither and newely fortifyed the town and castle: Than therle
of Derby desired the earl of Penbroke / sir Gaultier of Manny / sir Franque de
Hall / sir Thomas Coque / sir John^ de la Touch / sir Richard of Beauayes /
sir Philyp Reckeleue / sir Robert Neuyll / sir Thomas Briset / and diverse
other knights and squyers to go all to Aguyllon / and to keep that fortres /
for he would besore dyspleased if that should be lost they departed and were
a.xl. knights and squyers / and three hundred men of arms with archers. And so
they entered into the strong castle of Aguyllon: and there they found a
sixscore soudy ours all ready / that therle of Derby had left there before: than
they made prouisyon for all things necessary. And as these foresaid four
knights came toward Uyle Fra^che: they found in their way great plenty of
beafes / mottons / and corn: the which they took with them into their town /
and they repaired again the castle and mended the walls and gates of the
town: so that they were at last a fyftene hundred men able to make defense /
and had vytayle sufficyent for six months. The duke of Normandy who had long
lain at sieg before Angolesme: saw how he could not win the town by assaut
/ for every day he lost of his men: than he commanded to make no more assautes
/ but to remeue nerer to the town. On a day the seneshall of Beaucayre came to
the duke and said: sir I know well all the marchesse of this country / if it
will please yout to let me have a six hundred men of arms / and I shall go
abroad into the contre and get vytayle for your host / for within a while we
shall lack. The duke was content: the next day the seneshall took with him
certain knights / squyers / and lords / that were content to go under him.
First the duke of Burbou / therle of Ponthieu his brother / the earl of
Tankernyll / therle of Forestes / the dolphyn of Auuerne / the lord of Pons /
the lord of Partuey / the lord of Coucy / the lord Daubigny / the lord
Dausemont / the lord of Beauiewe / sir Guyssharde Dangle / sir Sayntre / and
diverse other to a.ix. C. spears. They took their horse in the euenyng and
rode all nyghttyll the brekyng of the day in the morning: and so came to a great
town that was but newly won by the^glysshmen called Athenys / and there aspy
came to the seen shall and said: sir there is in the town a sixscore men of
arms / gascons / and english / and.iii. hundred archers: who woll defend
the town if ye give assaut / but I saw this morning a ii. C. great beestes
put out of the town into the meadows / ioyninge to the town. Than the
seneshall said: sirs I think it best let all our company abide still here in
this valey / and I woll go with.lx. with me and fecthe y^ catayle hythee and I
think thenglysshmen woll issue incontyne^t to rescue the pray / than shall ye
mete with them. So this was done: y^ seneshall with threscore well horsed rode
by ways covert about y^ town by gidyng of the spy / till at last they ca^e
into the fair meadows / where the catayle pastured. Tha^ they drove all the
beestes together a long by the town by another way / than they ca^e thither.
They of the castle and on the walls saw them: and began to blow and to
stir in the town / and a waked some out of their beds / for it was erely
in the morning: and than they drew together and mounted on their horses / and
issued out he that might first / so that there abode in the town none but a
certain vylayns / thenglysshmen hasted them sore after the frenchmen / and
cried sirs ye shall not go thus away. Than the frenchmen came on them: so that
with in a little space they were overcome / and the captain sir Stephyn Lesey
was taken prisoner and some other with him / and all the other slain. And than
the frenchemen rode hastily to the town / the which they wanne with assaut /
for it was without keeping: the first battle that entered was the duke of
Burbons / than they set there new captayns. And so depted with their pray
and prisoners: and so came the next day to the host before Angolesme / the
seneshall of Be aucayre achyued great honor by that deed / howbeit there were
gretter lords with him tha^ himself / but he was captain as at that time.

How John^ Nor wyche escaped fro Angolesme wha^ the town was yielded to the
frenchmen. Cap. C.xix.
THus these lords of France held a great season sege before Angoleme / and
they ran over all the country that thenglysshmen had won before / and
did much trouble / and took many prisoners and great prays / the which they
brought to their host / the two brethren of Burbon achyued great laud and
praise / for always they went forth with y^ formast. When John^ Norwiche saw
that the duke would not depart thens till he had the town at his pleasure: and
parceyued how their vitayls began to wast / and that the earl of Derby made no
manner to rescue them. And also he saw well how they of the town enelyued
greatly to the french party for they would have turned french or that time
if they had durst: therefore he doubted of treason. ^herfore he thought to save
himself and his company: on the even of the Purifycation of our lady / all
alone he went to the walls of the cite Without she wyng to any man what he would
do / he made a token with his hatte to them of the host. they that saw the
sign came thither and demanded what he would * he said he would gladly speak
with the duke of Normandy / or with one of his marshals. Inco^tynent this was
showed to the duke: who went thither and certain knights with him: as soon as
the captain saw the duke / he took of his cap and saluted the duke / and the
duke saluted him and said / John^ how is it with you: woll you yield your
self / sir (...) he I am not so yet determined / but sir I would desire you in
the honor of our lady / whose day shall be to morrow / that ye would grant a
truse to endure all only but to morrow: so that you nor we none to grieve other
/ but to be in peace y^ day. The duke said I am content and so they departed /
the nere day which was Candelmas day* John^ Norwiche and his company armed them
and trussed all that they had to bear away Than they opyned their gate and
issued out: than they of the host began to stir / than the captain rode on
before to them and said: sirs / beware do no hurt to none of us* for we woll do
none: we have trus^ for this day all only agreed by the duke your caiptayne.
If ye know it not go and demand of him: for by reason of this trewse we may
ride this day whyther we woll. The duke was demanded what was his pleasure in
that matter: the duke answered and said let them depart whyder they woll a
goddesname / for we can not let them for I woll keep that I have promised. Thus
John^ Norwych departed and all his company / and passed the french host
without any damage and went to Aguyllon. And when the knights there knew how
he had saved himself and his company / they said he had begyled his enemies*
by a good subtyltie. The next day after they of the city of Angolesme went to
counsel / and determined to yield up the town to the duke / they sent to him
into the host certain messangers who at last spedde so well that the duke
took the^ to mercy / and pardoned them all his yuell will and so entered into
the city and into the castle / and took homage of the cytizens: and made
captain there Antony Uyllers and set a hundred soudyers with him / than the
duke went to the castle of Damass^ne where he held siege.xv. days and every
day assaut: finally it was won and all that were within slain. The duke gave
that castle and the lands thereto* to a squire of Beausse called the Bourge of
Mulle / than the duke came to Thomyus on the river of Garon and there lay at
siege a certain space / at last they within yielded up / their goods and
lives saved: and to be sauely conducted to Burdeaur So the strangers departed /
but they of y^ town came under the obeysaunce of the duke: the duke tarried
about the river of Garon / till it was past Ester. And than he went to port
saint Mary on the same river / and there were a two hundred englysshmen / that
kept the town and the passage and was well fortisyed: but it was taken with
assaut and all they within / than there were set new captayns and men of war /
and new repaired the town / and thanne the duke went to Aguyllone.

How the duke of Normandy laid siege to Aguyllon with a hundred thousand men.
Cap. C.xx.
THe duke of Normandy and these lords of France / did somoche that they came
to the castle of Aguyllone: there they laid their siege about the fair
meadows / along by y^ river able to bear ships every lord among his own
company* and every constable by him self as it was ordained by the marshals.
This sege endured till the feast of saint Remy: there were well. C. thousand
men of war a horse back and a foot / they made lightly every day two or three
assautes / and most commonly fro the morning till it was nere night without
ceasynge: for ever there ca^e new assauters that would not suffer them with in
to rest / the lords of France saw well they could not well come to the
fro^ters without they passed the river / the which was large and deep Than the
duke commanded that a bridge should be made whatsoever it cost: to pass the
river there were set a warke / mo than three hundred workmen / who did work
day and night. When the knights within saw this brige more than half made
over the river they decked three ships and entered into them a certain. And
so ca^e on the workmen / and chased them away with their defenders: and there
they brake all to peaces that had been long a making. Whan^e the french
lords saw that: than they apayrelled other ships to resyst against their
ships: and than the workmen began again to work on the bridge / on trust
of their defenders. And when they had worked half a day and more: sir Gaultier
of Manny and his company entered into a ship and came on the workmen / and
made them to leave warke and to recule back: and brake again all that they had
made. This business was nygh every day / but at last the frenchmen kept so
well their workmen that the bridge was made perforce. And thanne the lords
and all their army passed over in manner of bataylle: and they assawtedde the
castle a hole day together without ceasyng / but nothing they wanne. And at
night they returned to their lodgings: and they within amended all that was
broken / for they had with them work men enough. The next day the frenchmen
divided their assauters into four parts: y^ first to begin in the morning
and to continue till nine / the second till noon / they third to even song
time: and the fourth till night. After that manner they assailed the castle
sire days together / how be it they within were not so sore traueyled / but
always they defended themself so valyantly that they without wanne nothing /
but only the bridge without the castle. Than^e the frenchmen took other
counsel / they send to Tholouz for eight great engyns / and they made there
four gretter: and they made all. xii to cast day and night against y^ castle
/ but they within were so well perauysshed that never a ston of their engyns
did they many hurt. It brake somewhat the coueryng of some houses / they wtin
had also great engyns / the which brake down all the engyns without / for in a
short space they brake all to pecys six of the greattest of the^ without.
During this siege often times ser Water of Manny issued out with a hundred or
sire score co^panyons: and went on that side the river a foragynge / and
returned again with great prays / in the sight of them without. On a day the
lord Charles of Momore^cy marshall of the host rode forth with a five hundred
with him / and whan^e he returned he drove before him a great nombre of
beestes / that he had get together in the country to refresshe thoost with
vytayle. And by adventure he encountered with sir Gaultier of Manny: there was
between the^ a great fight / and many overthrown / hurt / and slain: the
frenchemen were five against one / tidings thereof came unto Aguyllon / than
every man that might issued out. Therle of Penbroke first of all and his
company: and when he came he found sir Gaultier of Ma^ny a foot enclosed with
his enemies / and did meruayls in arms. In contynent he was rescued and
remounted again / and in the mean season some of the frenchemen chased their
beestes quyckely into the host / or else they had lost them / for they that
issued out of Aguyllon set so feersly on the frenchmen / that they put them
to the slyght: and delyuerd their company that were takenne and took many
frenchemen prisoners. And sir Charles of Momore^cy had much warke to escape:
than thenglysshmen returned into Aguyllon. Thus every day almoost there were
such rencounters beside y^ assautes: on a day all the hole host armed them /
and the duke commanded that they of Tholouz / of Carcassone / of Beaucayre /
should make assaut fro the morning till noone: and they of Remergue / Caours /
and Agenoys / fro noone till night. And y^ duke promised who soever could win the brige of the gate / should have in reward a hundred crowns also the duke
the better to mentayne this assaut he caused to come on the river diverse
ships and ba^ges / some entered into them to pass the river: and some went by
the bridge. At the last some of them took a little vessel and went under the
brige: and did cast great hokes of iron to the draw bridge / and than drew
it to them so sore that they brake the chenes of iron y^ held the bridge / and
so pulled down the bridge parforce. Than the frenchmen lept on the bridge so
hastily that one ouerthrewe an other: for every man desired to win the hundred
crowns: they within cast down bars of iron / pieces of tymbre / pottes of
lyme / and hot water: so that many were overthrown fro the bridge into the
water / and into the dykes / and many slain and sore hurt. Howbeit the bridge
was won perforce: but it cost more than it was worth / for they could not
for all that win the gate: than they drew a back to their lodgings for it
was late / than^e they within issued out * and new made again their draw
bridge: stronger than^e ever it was before. The next day there came to the duke
two connyng men masters in carpentre / and said sir if ye woll let us have
tymbre and workmen / we shall make four scaffoldes as high or hyer than^e the
walls. The duke commanded that it should be done: and to get carpenters in
the country and to give them good wages / so these four scafoldes were made in
four ships but it was long first / and cost much or they were finysshed than
such a should assail the castle in the^ were appointed and entered. And when
they were passed half the river / they within the castle let go four
martynetes that they had newely made to resyst against these scafoldes: these
four martynettes did cast out so great stones / and so often fell on the
scafoldes / y^ in a short space they were all to broken so that they that were
within them could not be pauysshed by them: so that they were feign to draw
back again / and or they were again at land / one of the scafoldes drowned
in y^ water / and the most part of the^ that were Win it / the which was great
damage: for therein were good knights / desyringe their bodies to auau^ce. When
the duke saw that he could not come to his intent by that means he caused the
other three scafoldes to rest. Than he coudese no way how he might get the
castle / and he had promised not to depart thense till he had it at his will
without the king his father did send for him. Than he send the constable of
France and the earl of Tankernyll to Paris to ye king and there they showed him
the state of the siege of Aguyllone the kings mind was that the duke should
lie there still till he had won them by famyn: sith he could not have the^ by
assaut.

How the king of England came over the sea again to rescue them in
Aguyllone. Cap. C.xxi.
THe king of England who had hard how his me^ (...) constrained in the
castle of Aguyllon: than he thought to go over the sea (...) to Gascoyne with
a great(...) my / there he made his (...) syon and sent for men all about his
real(...) in other places where he thought to spe(...) money. In the same season
the lord (...) of Harecourt came into England / who was banysshed out of
France: he was well received with the king and retained to be about him / and
had fair lands assigned him in England to mentayne his degree. Than the
king caused a great navy of ships to be ready in the hauyn of Hampton / and
caused all manner of men of war to draw thither / about ye feast of saint John
Baptyst / the year of our lord god. M. C C C.xiv. the king deperted fro the
queen / and left her in the gydinge of therle of Cane his cosyn. And he
stablysshed the lord Persy and the lord Neuyll to be wardyns of his realm
with the archebysshoppe of york / the bishop of Lyncolne / and the
bysshopp^ of Durham: for he never voyded his realm / but that he left ever
enough at home to keep and defend the realm if need were. Than the king rode
to Hampton and there tarried for wind: than he entered into his ship and the
prince of wales with him / and the lord Godfray of Harecourt: and all other
lords earls barownes / and knights with all their co^panyes: they were in
nombre a four thousand men of arms / and ten thousand archers / beside
Irysshmen and walsshmen that followed the host a foot. Now I shall name you
certain of the lords that went over with king Edward in that journey. First
Edward his eldest son prince of wales / who as than^e was of the age of.xiii.
years or there about: the earls of Herforde / Northamptone / Arundell /
Cornwall / warwyke / Hu^tyngdon / Suffolk and Oxenforth. And of barons: the
lord Mortymer / who was after earl of March: the lords: John^ / Loyes / and
Roger of Beaucha^pe / and the lord Reynold Cobham. Of lords: the lord of
Mombray / Rose / Lucy / Felton / Brastone / Myllon / Labey / Maule / Basset /
Barlett / and wylloughby: with diverse other lords. And of bachelars: there was
John^ Chandoys Fytzwaren / Peter and James Audelay / Roger of Uertuall /
Bartylmewe of Bries / and Richard of Penbruges / with diverse other that I can
not name: few there were of sta^gers / there was the earl Hauyou / sir Olphas of
Guystels / and.v. or.vi. other knights of Almayne: and many other that I can
not name. Thus they say(...) ^^rth that day in the name of god: they were (...)
(...)ward on their way toward Gascone / (...) on the third day there rose a
contrary wind (...) them on the marches of Cornwall / and (...) lay at
ancre.vi. days. In that space (...) had other counsel by the means of (...)
Godfray Harcourt / he counseled the king not to go into Gascoyne / but rather
to set a land in Normandy: and said to the king / sir the country of Normandy
is one of the plentyous countries of the world. Sir on ieoperdy (...) my heed
if ye woll land there / there is none tha^ shall resyst you / the people of
Normandy have not ben used to the war / and all the knights and squyers of
the country ar now at the siege before Aguyllon with the duke. And sir there ye
shall find great towns that be not walled / whereby yo^ men shall have such
wynning that they shall be the better thereby.xx. year after: and sir ye may
follow with your army till ye come to Cane in Normandy. Sir I require you
believe me in this voyage: the king who was as than but^in the flower of his
youth / desyring nothing somoche as to haut deeds of arms / inclyned greatly
to the saying of the lord Harecourt / whom he called cosyn: than he commanded
the maryners to set their course to Normandy. And he took into his ship ye
token of thadmyrall therle of warwyke: and said how he would be admyrall for
that vyage / and so sailed on before as governor of y^ navy / and they had
wind at will: than y^ king in the ysse of Co^stantyne at a port called Hogue
saint wast. Tydinges anon spredde ^^rode how thenglysshmen were a land: the
to (...) of Constantyne sent word thereof to Maryst^ king Philypp^ / he had
well hard before how the king of England was on the sea with a great army
but he wist not what way he would draw other into Normandy / Bretayne / or
Gascoyne. As Soon as he knew that the king of England was a land in Normandy
/ he send his constable therle of Guyues and the earl of Tankernell / who were
but newely come to him (...) his son / fro the siege at Aguyllon to y^ town
of Cane, co^maundyng them to keep that town against the englysshmen / they
said they would do their best: they departed fro Paris with a good nombre of
men of war / and daily there came mo to them by the way. And so came to the
town of Cane / where they were received with great joy of men of the town
and of the country there about / that were drawn thither for surety: these
lords took head for the prouisyon of the town the which as than was not
walled The king thus was aryued at the port Hogue saint wast / nere to saint
Savior the vycou^t the right heritage to the lord Godfray of Harcourt / who
as than was there with the king of England.

How the king of England rode in three batayls through Normandy. Cap. C.xxii.
WHan^e the king of England arrived in the ^ogu^saynt wast / the king issued
out of his ship and the (...) fo^^ that he set on the ground / he fell so
rudely that ye blood brast but of his nose: the knights that were about him
took him up and said / sir for goddessake enter again into your ship and
come not a land this day: for this is but an y^ell sign for us / than the
king answered quickly and said wherefore / this is a good token for me for y^
land desires to have me. Of the which auswere all his men were right joyful:
so that day and night the king lodged on the sands / and in y^ mean time
dyscharged y^ ships of their horsess and other bagages / there the king made
two marshals of his host / the one the lord Godfray of Harecourt: and the
other therle of warwyke / and the earl of Arundell constable. And he ordained
that therle of Huntyngdon should keep the ^^e^e of ships with. C. men of
arms / and.iiii. C. archers. And also he ordained three batayls, one to go on
his right hand closyng to the sea side / and the other on his lift hand: and
the king himself in the mids / and every night to lodge all in one field.
Thus they set forth as they were ordained and they yt went by the sea took
all the ships that they found in their ways and so long they went forth
what by see and what by land / that they came to a good port / and to a good
town called Har^^ewe / the which incontinent was won / for they within gave
by for fear of ^ethe: howebeit for all that the town was robbed / and much
gold and silver there found and rich jewels / there was found somoche
richesse that the boys and vyllayns of the host set nothing by good furred
gowns they made all the men of the town to issue out and to go into the
ships / because they would not sustre them to be behind them / for fear of
rebellyng again. After the town of Har^^ewe was thus taken and robbed without
brennyng / than they spredde a broad in the country / and did what they list:
for there was not to resyst them / at last they came to a great and a rich
town called Cherbourgue / the town they wan and robbed it and brent part
thereof: but into the castle they could not come it was so strong and well
furnysshed with men of war: than^e they passed forth and came to
Mountbourgue and took it and robbed and brent it clean. In this manner they
brent many other towns in that country and ^an so much richesse that it was
marvel to rekyn it: thanne they came to a great town well closed called
Quar^tyne / where there was also a strong castle and many soudyours within to
keep it / than^e the lords came out of their ships and feersly made assaut:
the burgesses of the town were in great fear of their lives / wives and
children: they suffered thenglysshemen to enter into the town against the will
of all the soud yours that were there: they put all their goods to
thenglysshmens pleasures they thought that most advantage. When the son
dyours within saw that they went into the castle / the englysshmen went into
the town and two days to guyder they made sore assautes: so that when they
within se no socoure / they yielded up their lives and goods sauyed: and so
departed / thenglysshmen had their pleasure of that good town and castle. And
when they saw they might not mentayne to keep it / they set fire therein and
brent it: and made the burgesses of y^ town to enter into their ships as
they had done with the^ of Harflewe Chyerburgue / and Mountbourge / and of
other to wnes that they had won on the sea side: all this was done by the
battle that went by the sea side / and by the^ on the sea together. Now let us
speak of the kings battle: when he had sent his first battle a long by the sea side as ye have hard, whereof one of his marshals therle of Warwyke was
captain and the lord Cobham with him: than he made his other marshall to lead
his host on his lift hand / for he knew the yssues and entrees of Normandy
better than any other did there the lord Godfray as marshall rode forth with
five hundred men of arms / and rode of fro the kings battle as sire or
seuyne leages: in brennynge and exilyng the country / the which was plentyfull
of every thing: the granges full of corn / the houses full of all riches /
rich burgesses / carts and charyottes / horse / swyne / mottous / and other
beestes: they took what the^ list and brought into the kings host / but the
soudyours made no count to the king nor to none of his officers / of the gold
and silver that they did get / they kept that to themself. Thussir Godfray
of Harecourt rode every day of fro y^ kings host / and for most part every
night resorted to the kings field. The king took his way to saint Low in
Constantyne / but or he came there he lodged by a river abiding for his men that
rode a long by the sea side / and when they were come they set for the their
caryage / and therle of Warwyke / therle of Suffolk / sir Thomas Hollande /
and sir Raynolde Cobhm^ and their company rode out on the one side / and wasted
and eriled the country as the lord Hare court had done: and the king ever
rode between these bataylles / and every night they logedde together.

Of the great assemble that the french king made to resyst the king of
England. Cap. C.xxiii.
THus by the^glysshmen was brent / exyled / robbed / wasted and pylled / the
good plentyfull country of Normandy. Thanne the french king sent for the
lord John^ of Heynalt / who ca^e to him with a great nombre: also the king
send for other men of arms / dukes / earls / barownes / knights / and
squyers: and assembled together the grettest nombre of people that had bensene
in France a hundred year before he sent for men into so ferr countries that it
was long or they came together: whereof the king of England did what him
list in the mean season. The french king hard well what he did: and swear
and said how they should neuerretourne again unfought withal: and that such
hurtes and damages as they had done should be derely revenged / wherefore he had
sent letters to his friends in thempyre to such as were farthest of: and also
to the gentle king of Behayne / and to the lord Charles his son / who fro
thens for the was called king of Almaygne he was made king by the aid of his
father / and the french king: and had taken on him the arms of thempyre. The
french king desired them to come to him withal their powers / to thyntent to
fight with the king of England / who brent and wasted his country. These
princes and lords made them ready with great nombre of men of arms / of
almaynes / behaynoes / and luxambroses / and so came to the french king: also
king Philypp^ send to the duke of Lorayne / who came to serve him with. CCC.
spears: also there came therle samynes in Samynoes / therle of Salebrug^ / the
earl of Flaunders / the earl Wyllyam of Namure / every man with a fair
company* ye have hard here before of the order of thenglysshmen how they went
in three batayls: the marshalles on the right hand and on the lift / the king
and the prince of Wales his son in the mids. They rode but small iourneys:
and every day took their lodgings between noone and three of the clock / and
found the country so fruitful that they neded not to make no prouisy on for
their host but all only for wine: and yet they found reasonably sufficyent
thereof. It was no marueyle though they of the country were afraid: for before
that time they had never seen men of war / nor they wist not what war or
battle meant: they fled away as ferr as they might here spekyng of
thenglysshmen / and left their houses well stuffed / and graunges full of corn
/ they wist not how to save and keep it: y^ king of England and the prince
had in their battle a three thousand men of arms / and six thousand archers
/ and a ten thousand men (...) foot / beside them that rode with the marshals.
Thus as ye have hard the king rodeforth wasting and brennyng the country
without brekyng of his order: he left the city of Constance and went to a
great town called saint Low / a rych town of drapery / and many rich
burgesses in that town / there were dwelling an.viii. or nynescore burgesses
crafty men* When the king came there he took his lodgyng without: for he
would never lodge in the town for fear of fire / but he send his men before
and anon y^ town was taken and clean robbed. It was hard to think ye great
riches that there was won in clothes specially: clothe would there have been
sold good chepe if there had been any buyers / tha^ the king went toward Cane /
the which was a greatter town and fall of drapery / and other marchauntdyse:
and rich burgesses / noble ladies and damsels / and fair churches / and
specially two great and rich abbeys / one of the Crynyte / another of saint
Stephyn. And on ye one side of the town one of the fairest castles of all
Normandy / and captain therein was Robert of Blargny with three hundred
genowayes / and in the town was therle of Ewe and of Guynes constable of
France / and therle of Tankernyll with a good nombre of men of war. The king
of England rode that day in good order and logedde all his batayls together that
night / a two leages fro Cane / in a town with a little hauyn called
Naustreham: and thither ca^e also all his navy of ships / with therle of
Huntyngdone / who was governor of them. The constable and other lords of
France that night watched well the town of Cane / and in the morning armed
them with all them of the town. Than the constable ordained that none should
issue out / but keep their defenses on the walls / gate / bridge / and river /
and left the subbarbes void: because they were not closedde / for they thought
they should have enough to do to defend the town because it was not closedde
but with the river / they of the town saybe how they would issue out / for
they were strong enough to fight with the king of England. When the co^llable
saw their good wyls: he said in the name of god he it / ye shall not fight
without me. Than they issued out in good order: and made good face to fight and
to defend them / and to put their lives in adventure.

Of the battle of Cane / and how thenglysshmen took to town Cap. C.xxiiii.
THe same day thenglyssh men rose erly and apayrelled them ready to go to Cane:
the king hard noise before the son rising. And than took his horse / and the
prince his son / with sir Godfray of Harcourt marshall and leader of the host
/ whose counsel the king much followed. Than they drew toward Cane with
their batels in good array / and so aproched the good town of Cane. Whau^e they
of the town / who were ready in the field saw these three batayls coming in
good order / with their baners and sta^de^des wauynge in the wind: and the
archers the which they had not ben accustomed to se / they were sore afraid /
and fled away toward the town without any order or good array / for all that
the constable could do: than the englysshmen pursued them egerly. When the
constable and the earl of of Ta^kernyll saw that / they took a gate at the
entry and saved themself and certain with the^: for the englysshmen were
entered into the town some of the knights and squyers of France / such as
knew the way to the castle went thither / and the captain there received them
all for the castle was large. The^glysshmen in y^ chaselle we many for they
took non to mercy: than the constable and the earl of Tankernyll being in the
little tower at the bridge foot / looked a long the street and saw their men
^^ayne without mercy / they douted to fall in their hand. At last they saw an
english knight with one eye called (...) Thom^s Holand and afyue or six
other knights with him / they knew the^ / for they had seen them before in
Pruce / in Grenade / and in other vyages: than they called to sir Thomas and
said how they would yield themself prisoners. Than sir Thomas came thither with
his company and mounted up into the gate / and there found the said lords
with.xxv. knyghts with them / who yielded them to sir Thomas and he took
the^for his prisoners and left company to keep them / and than mounted again
on his horse and rode into the streates / and saved many lives / of lavyes /
damsels / and cloysterers fro defoylyng / for the soudyers were without mercy.
It fell so well the same season for thenglysshmen: that the ^^^er which was
able to bear ships at that (...)e was so low that men went in and out beside
the bridge they of the town were entered into their houses: and cast down into
the street stones tymbre and ^ron: and slew and hurt mo than five hundred
englysshmen / wherewith the king was sore dyspleased. At night when he hard
thereof / he commanded that the next day all should be put to the sword and
the town brent but than sir Godfray of Harecourt said: dear sir for goddessake
ass wage somewhat your courage / and let it su^fice you that ye have done ye
have yet a great voyage to do orye come before Calys / whyderye purpose to go:
and sir in this town there is much people who will defend their houses / and
it woll cost many of yor men their lives or ye have all at yor will whereby
paraue^ture ye shall not keep your purpose to Calys / the which should redowne
to your rech. Sir save your people for ye shall have need of them or this
month pass: for I think verily your adversary king Philypp^ woll mete with
you to fight / and ye shall find many strayt passages and rencou^ters.
Wherefore your men and ye had mo shall stand you in good stead: and sir without
any further sleynge ye shall be lord of this town / men and women woll put
all that they have to your pleasur. Than the king said sir Godfray you ar our
marshall* ordain every thing as ye woll: than sir Godfray with his baner rode
fro street to street and commanded in the kings name / non to be so hardy to
put fire in any house / to slay any person / nor to vyolate any woman. When
they of the town hard that cry / they received the englysshmen into their
houses and made them good chere: and some opyned their coffers and badde them
take what them list / so they might be assured of there lives how be it there
were done in the town many yuell deeds murdrers and roberyes. Thus the
englysshmen were lords of the town three days ano wanne great richesse / the
which they sent by ba^kesse and barges to saint Sauyoure / by the river of
Austr^hen a two leages theus: where as all their navy lay / than the king send
therle of ^unty^gdon with two hundred men of arms / and four hundred archers
with his navy and prisoners: and richesse that they had got / back again
into England. And the king bought of sir Thomas Hallande* the constable of
France / and therle of Tankernyll: and paid for them twenty thousand nobles.

How sir Godfray of Harecourte fought with the^ of Amyens before Paris. Cap.
C.xxv.
THus the king of England ordered his business being in the town of Cane /
and send into England his navy of ships charged (...) clothes / iewelles /
vessels of gold and silver / and of other richesse: and of prisoners mo
than.lx. knights and three hundred burgesses. Than he departed fro the town of
Cane / and rode in the same order as he did before: brennynge and exilynge the
country / and took the way to Ewreus and so past by it. And fro thens they
rode to a great town called Louyets / it was the chief town of all Normandy
of drapery / riches and full of marchandyse: the^glysshmen soon entered therein
for as than it was not closed / it was over ron spoiled / and robbed without
mercy / there was won great richesse. Thau^e they entered into the country of
Ewreus / and brent and pylled all ye country / except the good towns closed
and castles* to the which the king made none assaut / because of the sparyng
of his people and his artillery. On the river of Sane nere to Rone: there was
the exle of Harecourt / brother to sir Godfray of Harecourt / but he was on the
french party / and therle of Dr^ux with him: with a good nombre of men of
war: but thenglysshmen left Roon and went to Gysors / where was a strong
castle / they brent the town / and than they brent Uernon / and all the
country about Roon / and Pont de Lache / and came to Nau^tes / and to Meulence
/ and wasted all the country about: and passed by the strong castle of
Robeboyes / and in every place a long the river of Sane / they found the
briges broken. At last they came to Poyssey and found the brige broken but the
arches and ^oystes lay in the river / the king lay there a.v. days. In the
mean season the brige was made to pass the host Without paryll: thenglysshe
marshals ran a broad just to Paris / and brent saint Germayne in Lay / and
Mountioy / and saint Cloud / and pety Bolayne by Paris / and the queen's
Bourge: they of Paris were not well assured of them self / for it was not as
than closed. Than king Philyppe removed to saint Denyse / and or he went caused
all y^ pentessys in Paris to be pulled down / and at saint Deuyse were ready
c^^ / the king of Behayne / the lord John^ of Heynalt* the duke of Lorayne /
therle of Flaunder^^ / therle of Bloyes / and many other great lords and
knights: ready to serve the french king. When the people of Paris saw their
king ^epart / they came to him and kn^lyd down and said: a sir and noble king
what woll ye do leave thus this noble city of Paris / the king say^ my good
people doubt ye not / the englysshmen woll aproche you no nerer than they be /
why so sir quod they / they be within these two leages: and as soon as they
know of your departing / they woll come and assail us / and we b^^at able to
defend them: sir tarry here still and help to defend your good cite of Paris.
Speak no more quod the king: for I woll go to saint Denyse to my men of war
/ for I woll encountre the englysshmen / and fight against them what soever
fall thereof / they king of England was at ^uissoy / and lay in the no^ery
there / and kept there the feast of our lady in August / and satte in h^^ robes
of scarlet furred with army^s: and after that feast he went forth in order as
they were he fore. The lord Godfray of Harecourt rode out on the one side with
five hundred men of arme^ and.xiii. hundred archers: and by adventure he
encou^tred a great nombre of burgesses of Amyense a horseback / who were
ryding by the kyuges commandment to Paris / they were quyckely assailed / and
they defended themself valyantly: for they were a great nombre and well armed
/ there were four knights of Amyense their captayns. This skirmysshe dur^^
long: at the first metyng many were overthrown on both parts / but finally
the burge^^es were taken and nigh all slain / and thenglysshmen to (...) all
their caryages and harnes. They were well stuffed: for they were going to the
french king well appointed / because they had not s^ne him a great season
before: there were slain in y^ field a. ^ii. hundred / than the king of
England entered into the country of Beauuosy^ / ^rennynge and ^^yling the
plain country: and lodged at a fair abbey and a rich called sayu^ Messene
nere to Beaways / there the king tarried a night and in the morning depted. And
when he was on his way he looked behind him: and sa^e the abbey a fire / he
caused incontinent.xx. of them to be hanged that set the fire there / for he had
commanded before on pain of death / none to v^late any church / nor to bren
any abbey: than the king past by the cite of Beaways / without any assaut
gyueng: for because he would not trouble his people / nor walt his artillery.
And so t^^^ day he took his logyng bety(...) a little (...) called Nully: the
two mars(...) came so nere to Beaways / that they made assaut and skirmysh at
the barryers in three places* the which assaut e^^ured a long space: but y^
town within was so well defended by the means of the bysshopp^ / who was there
within / that finally thenglysshemen departed and brent clean hard to the
gates / all the subbarbes. And than at night they came into the kings field /
the next day the king depted brennyng and wastyng all before him and at night
lodged in a good vyllage called Gran^uiller the next day the king past by
Argies / there was none to defend the castle / wherefore it was sone taken and
brent. Than they went forth dystroyeng the country all about and so came to
the castle of Poys where there was a good town and two castles: there was no
body in them but two fair damsels daughters to ye lord of Poys they were
soue taken / and had been vyolated and two english knights had not ben / sir
Johan ha^dos and sir Basset: they defended the^ and brought them to the king /
who for his honor made them good chere and demanded (...) them whyther they
would faynest go / (...) to Corbe: and the king caused them (...) ught thither
without paryll / that night y^ king lodged in the town of Poys: they of the
town and of the castles spoke that night with y^ marshals of thoost / to save
them and their town (...) brennyng / and they to pay a certain sum of
^^orey^s / the next day assoue as the host was departed. This was granted
them* and in the morning the king departed with all his host / except a
certain that were left there to receive the money that they of the town had
promised to pay. When they of the town saw thoost ^epart and but a few left
behynd / than they say^ they would pay never a penny / and so ^a^^e out and set
on thenglysshmen / who defended themself as well as they might: and send after
thost for socoure. When sir Reynolde Coh^am / and sir Thomas Hollande / who had
the rule of the reregarde hard thereof / they returned and cried treason
treason: and so came again to Poys ward / and found their companyons still
fightyng with them of the town. Than anoue they of the town were nigh^ all
slain and the town brent / and the two castles beaten down. Than they
returned to the kings host / who was as than at Araynes and there ^odged /
and had commanded all manner of men on pain of death / to do no hurt to no
town of Arsyn / ^o^ there the king was minded to lie a day or two to take
aduy^e how he might pass the river of Some for it was necessary for him to
pass the ry^er / as yeshall here after.

How the french king followed the king of England in Beauuoys^oys. Cap. C.xxvi.
Now let us speak of king Philyppe who was at saint Denyse / and his people
about him / and day^y increased. ^hasie on a day he departed and rode so long
that he came to Copp^gny du ^uyse / a three leages fro Amyense* and there he
tarried. The king of England being at Araynes wist not where for to pass the
river of Some / the which was large and deep / and all briges were broken and
the passages well kept: than at the kings commandment his two marshals with.
M. men of arms / and two. M. arthers went a long y^ river to find some passag
/ and passed by Long pre / and came to the bridge of Atheny / the which was
well kept with a great no^ bre of knights and squyers / and men of the
country: the englysshmen a lyghted a foot / and assailed the frenchmen from
the morning till it was noone: but the bridge was so well fortifyed and
defended / that the englysshmen departed without wynning of any thing: than
they went to a great to wne called Fountayns on the ^^uer of Sum / the which
was clean robbe^ and brent for it was not closed. Tha^ they went to another
town called Long in Ponthieu / they could not win the bridge it was so
well kept and defended / than they deperted and went to ^yqueny / and found
the town / the bridge / and the castle so well fortifyed* that it was na^
lykely to pass there / the french king had so well defended the passages:
to thentent that the king of England should not pass the river of Sum to
fight with him at his advantage or else to famysshe him there. Whan^e these two
marshals had assayed in all places to find passage / and could find none:
they returned again to the king and showed how they could find no passage
in no place / the same night the french king came to Amyense / with mo than a
hundred. M. men. The king of England was right pensyfe / and the next morning
hard mass before the son rysinge / and than dy^^oged: and every man followed
the marshals baners / and so rode in the country of Uimewe / aprochynge to the
good town of Abuyle / and found a town thereby whereunto was come much people
of the country / in trust of a little defense that was there / but
thenglysshmen anon wanne it / and all they that were within slain and many
taken / of the town and of the country. The king took his lodging in a
great hospytall that was there / the same day the french king departed fro
Amyense / and came to Araynes about noone / and the^glysshmen were departed
thense in the morning / the frenchmen found there great prouisyon that the
englysshmen had left behind them / because they departed in have: there they
found flesh ready on the broches / bread and pastyes in the ouyns / wine in
tonnes and barelles / and the tabuls ready laid. There the french king lodged
and tarried for his lords / that night the king of England was lodged at
Oysement: at night whan^e the two marshalles were returned / who had that day
over run the country to the gates of Abuyle / and to saint Ualery / and made
a greatskirmysshe there. Than the king assembled together his counsel / and
made to be brought before him certain prisoners / of the country of Ponthieu
/ and of Uymen: the king right curtesly demanded of them / if there were any
among them that knew any passage byneth Abuyle / that he and his host might
pass over the river of Sum: if he woldeshewe him thereof he should be quyte
of his ransom / and.xx. ^^his company for his love: there was a varle^ (...)ed
Gobyn a Grace / who stepped forth and said to the king: sir I promise you on
the ieopardy of my heed I shall bring you to such a place / where as ye and
all your host shall pass the river of Some without paryll / there be certain
places in the passage that ye shall pass.xii. men a front two times between
day and night / ye shall not go in the water to the knees / but when the fludde
comes the river than waxes so great (...) no man can pass / but when the
^^udde is gone the which is two times between day and night / than the river is
so low that it may be passed without danger / both a horseback and a foot.
The passage is hard in the botom with white stones / so that all your caryage
may go surely: therefore ye passage is called Blanch taque / and ye make ready to
deperte be times / ye may be there by the son rysinge / the king say^^ if
this be true that ye say I quytethe thy ransom and all thy company / and
moreover shall g^ue the a hundred nobles / than the king commanded every man
to be re^y at the sound of the trumpette to depart.

Of the battle of Blanch ^^que by twene the king of England and si^ Godmar du
Fay. Cap. C.xxvii.
THe king of England slepte not much that night / for at mydnight he a rose
and so wne^ his trumpette: tha^ incontinent they made ready caryages and all
things. And at the brekynge of the day they departed fro the town of
Oysement / and rode after the guydinge of Go^yn a Grace so that they came by
the son rising to Blanch Taque / but as than the flu^de was vpp^ so that they
might not pass: so the king tarried there till it was prime / than the ebb
came. The french king had his currours in the country who brought him word
of the ^emeanoure of the englysshmen / than he thought to close the king of
England between Abuyle and the river of Some / and so to fight with him at his
pleasure. And when he was at Amye^se: he had ordained a great barowne of
Normandy / called sir God mardu Fay to go and keep the passage of Bla^che Taque
/ where the englysshmen must pa(...) or else in none other place: he had with
him. M. men of arms / and six thousand a ^ote with the genowayes / so they
went by saint Rey^g^yer in Ponthieu / and fro thens to Crotay / where as the
passage lay. And also he had with him a great nombre of men of the country /
and also a great nombre of them of Mutterell / so that they were a twelfe
thousand men / one and other when the english host was come thither / sir
Godmardu Fay araunged all his company to defend the passage / the king of
England let not for all that / but whan^e the ^ludde was gone he commanded
his marshals to enter into ye water in the name of god and saint George: than
they that were hardy and coragyous entre^ on both parties / and many a man
reuersed / there were some of the frenchmen of Arthoyes and Pycardy / that were
as glad to just in the water / as on the dry land. The frenchemen defended
so well the passage at the yssuing out of the water / that they had much to
do: the genowayes did them great trouble with their c^os^owes / on the other
side the archers of England shot so holly together / that he frenchmen were
feign to give place to the englysshmen. There was a sore battle and many a
noble feate of arms done on both sides / finally thenglysshmen passed over /
and assembled together in the field: the king and the prince passed and all the
lords / than the frenchmen kept none array but departed he that might best.
When sir Godmar saw that dyscon^itu^e: he fled and saved himself some
^^edde to Abuyle / and some to saint Raygnyer / they that were there a foot
could not ^^ce so that there were slain a great nombre of them of Abuyle /
Muttrell / Arras / and of saint Raygnier / the chase endured more than a great
leag And as yet all the englysshmen were not passed the river / and certain
currours of the king of Behayne / and of sir John^ of Heynaultes / came on the^
that were behynd / and took certain horses and caryages / and slew diverse or
they could take the passage. The french king the same morning was departed fro
Araynes / trustyng to have found thenglysshmen between him and the river of
Some / but when he hard how that sir Godmar du Fay and his company were
^ysco^fyted / he tarried in the field and demanded of his marshals what was
best to do / they said sir ye can not pass the river but at the brige of
Abuyll / for the sludde is come in at Blanch taque than he returned and
lodged at Abuyle. The king of England when he was past the river he thanked
god: and so rode forth in like manner as he did before: than he called Gobyn a
Grace and did quyte him his ransom and all his company and gave him a hundred
nobles and a good horse. And so the king rode forth fair and easily / and
thought to have lodged in a great town called Norell / but when he knew that
the town ^ertayned to the countess of Da^merle / suster to ye lord Robert of
Arthoys: the king assured the town and country asmoche as pertayned to her
and so went forth: and his marshalles rode to Crotay on the seesyde / and
brent the town and found in the hauyn many ships and barks charged with
wynes of Po^thieu pertaining to the merchants of ^aynton / and of Rochell:
they brought the best thereof to ye kings host. Than one of the marshals ^o^e
to the gates of Abuyle / and fro thens to saint Reygnier / and after to the
town of Ruesaynt Esperyte. This was on a friday: and both batayls of the
marshals returned to the kings host about noone / and so lodged all toguyder
nere to Cressy in Pouthieu: the king of England was well enfourmed / how the
french king followed after him to fight. Than he said to his company: let us
take here some plotte of ground for we will go no farther tylle we have seen
our enemies / I have good cause here to abide them / for I am on the right
heritage of the queen my mother / the which land was given a^her marriage. I
woll challenge it of mine adversary Philyppe of Ualoys: and because that he had
not the eight part in nombre of men as the french king had / therefore he
commanded his marshals to chose a plotte of ground some what for his
advantage: and so they did and thither the king and his host went / than he
send his currours to Abuyle to se if the french king drew that day into the
field or natte. They went forth and returned again: and said how they
could se none aparence of his coming / than every man took their lodgyng for
that day / and to be ready in the morning at the sound of the trumpet in the
same place. Thus friday the french king tarried still in Abuyle abiding for
his company / and send his two marshals to ride out to se the dealyng of
thenglysshmen / and at night they returned and said how the englysshmen were
lodged in the feldes * that night the french king made a supper to all the
chief lords that were there with him / and after supper / the king desired them
to be friends ^^h to other: the king looked for the earl of Sauoy / who should
come to him with a thousand spears / for he had received wages for a three
months of them at Troy in Campaigne.

Of the order of the englysshmen at Cressy / and how they made three batayls a
foot. Cap. C.xxviii.
ON the friday as I said before: the king of England lay in ye feldes / for
the country was ple^tyfull of wynes and other vytayle / and if need had been
they had prouisyon following in carts and other caryages. That night the king
made a supper to all his chief lords of his host / and made them good chere /
and when they were all departed to take their rest. Than the king entered into
his oratorie: and kneled down before ye auter prayeng god devoutly / that if
he fought the next day that he might achyue the journey to his honor than
about mydnight he laid him down to rest / and in the morning he rose be
times and hard mass * and the prince his son with him and the most part of
his compa^^ were confessed and houseled. And after the (...)ass said: he
commanded every man to be armed and to draw to the field / to the same place
before appointed: than the king caused a park to be made by the wodesyde /
behind his host: and there was set all carts and caryages / and within the
park were all their horses for every man was a foot: And into this park there
was but one enter / than he ordained three batayls. In the first was the young
prince of Wales / with him the earl of Warwyke and Canforde / the lord Godfray
of Harecourt / sir Reynolde Cobham / sir Thom^s Holande / ye lord Stafforde /
the lord of Ma^uy / the lord Dalaware / sir John^ Chandos / sir Bartylmewe de
Bomes / sir Robert Neuyll / ye lord Thomas Clyfforde / the lord Bourchier /
the lord de la Tumyer / and diverse other knights and squyers that I can not
name: they were an.viii. hundred men of arms / and two thousand archers / and
a thousand of other with ye walsshmen: every lord drue to the field appointed
/ under his own baner and penone. In the second battle was therle of
Northampton / the earl of A^^dell / the lord Rosse / the lord Lygo / the
lord Wylough by / the lord Basset / the lord of saint Aubyne / sir Loyes
Tueton / the lord of Myleton / the lord de la Sell / and diverse other about
an eight hundred men of arms / and twelfhundred archers. The third battle
had the king: he had seuyn hundred men of arms / and two thousand archers:
than the king lept on a hobby with a white rod in his hand / one of his
marshals on the one hand / and the other on the other hand: he rode fro reuke
to reuke desyringe every man to take heed that day to his right and honor. He
spoke it so swetely and with so good countenance and merry chere / that all
such as were dysconfited took courage in the saying and heryng of him. And
when he had thus visyted all his batayls / it was than nine of the day: than he
caused every man to eat and drink a little / and so they did at their
leaser. And afterward they ordered again their bataylles / than every man lay
down on the yerth and by him his salet and bow / to be the more (...) he^
when their enemies should come.

Thorder of the frenchmen at Cressy / and how they beheld the demeanor of
thenglysshmen. Cap. C.xxix.
THis saturday the french king rose ^^tymes and hard mass in Abuyle / in his
lodgyng in the abbey of saint Peter: and he departed after the some rising.
when he was out of the town two leages aproc^yng toward his ennemys / some of
his lords said to him: Sir it were good yt ye ordered yor batayls / and let all
your footmen pass some what on before / that they be not troubled with the
horsemen. Than ye king sent.iiii. knights / the Moyne Bastell the lord of
Noyers / the lord of Beauie we / and the lord ^am begny to ride to a view
thenglysshe host: and so they rode so nere that they might well se part of
their dealyng. Thenglysshmen saw the well and knew well how they were come
thither to a vieu them / they let them alone: and made no countena(...)ward
the^ and let them return as they came. And when the french king saw
(...)our knights return again / he tary^^^^ll they came to him: and said
sirs what tidings / these four knights each of them looked on other / for there
was none would speak before his co^panyon: finally the king said to Moyne who
pertayned to the king of Behaygne / and had done in his days somoch that he
was reputed for one of the valyantest knights of the world / sir speak you.
Than he said: sir I shall spekesyth it pleases you under ye correction of my
felawes / sir we have ryden and seen the behauyng of your enemies / know ye
for troth they are rested in three batayls / abidyng for you: Sir I woll
counsel you as for my part saving your dyspleasure / that you and all your
company rest here and lodge for this night / for or they that be behind of your
^o^pany become hither / and or your batayls beset in good order it will be very
late / and your people be weary and out of array: and ye shall find your
ennemis fresshe and ready to receive you / erly in the morning ye may order
your bataylles at more leaser and advise your ennemis at more delyberacyon /
and to regard well what way ye woll assail them: for sir surely they woll
abide you. Than the king commanded that it should be so done / than his.ii.
marshals one rode before another behind / saying to every baner / tarry and
abide here in the name of god and saint Denis / they that were formast tarried /
but they that were behind would not tarry but rode forth / and said how they
would in no wise abide till they were as ferr forward as y^ formast. And when
they before saw them come on behind / than they rode forward again so that
the king nor his marshals could not rule the^ / so they rode without order or
good array till they came in sight of their enemies. And as soon as the formast
saw them / they reculed than abacke ^out good array: whereof they behind had
marvel and were a basshed / and thought that the formast company had been
fighting / than they might have had leaser and rome to have gone forward if
they had list. Some went forth and some abode still: the commons of whom all
the ways between Abuyle and Cressy were full. Wha^ they saw that they were
^ere to their ennemies / they took their swerdes and cried down with them let
us ^^e them all / there was no man though he were present at the journey that
could ymagen or show ye troth of the yuell order that was among the french
party / and yet they were a marvelous great nombre. That I write in this book
I learned it specially of the engysshmen / who well beheld their dealyng: and
also certain knights of sir Johan of Heynaultes / who was always about king
Philyppe showed me as they knew.

Of the battle of Cressy between the king of England and the french king.
Cap. C.xxx.
THe^glysshmen who were in three batayls lyeng on the ground to rest them /
as soon as they saw the frenchmen aproche: they rose upon their fete fair and
easily without and have / and aranged their batayls. The first which was the
princes batell: the archers there stood in manner of a hearse / and the men of
arms in the botome of the battle. Therle of Northa^pton and therle of
Arundell with the second batell were on a wyng in good order / ready to confort
the princes battle if need were. The lords and knights of France ca^enat to
the assemble together in good order / for some ca^e before and some came after
in such have and yuell order / yt one of the^ did trouble another. When the
french king saw the englysshmen his blood changed and said to his marshals
make the genowayes go on before and begin the battle in the name of god and
saint Denyse: there were of the genowayes trosbowes about a fiftene thousand but
they were so weary of going a foot that day a six leages armed with their
crosbowes / that they said to their constables we be not well ordered to fight
this day for we be not in the case to do any great deed of arms / we have more
need of rest. These words came to the earl of Alanson who said a man is well
at ease to be charged with such a sort of rascalles / to be faint and fail
now at most need. Also the same season there fell a great rain and a clyps
with a terryble thonder / and before the rain there came fleyng over both
batayls a great nombre of crows / for fear of the tempest coming. Than
anon the air began to wax clear / and the son to shine fair and bright:
the which was right in the frenchmens eyes / and on the englysshmens backs.
When the genowayes were assembled toguyder and began to aproche / they made a
great leap and cry to abasshe thenglysshmen / but they stood still and
styredde not for all that / than^e the genowayes again the second time made a
another leap and a fell cry / and stepped forward a little / and
thenglysshmen remeued not one fote^ thirdly again they leapt and cried and
went forth till they came within shot: than^e they shot feersly with their
crosbowes. Than thenglysshe archers stepped forth one pase and let fly their
arowes so holly and so thycke that (...)seemed snow / when the genowayes felt
the arowes persynge through heedes / arms / and breasts: many of them cast
down their cros^ow^s and did cut their strings / and returned
dysconfited. When the french king saw them fly away: he said slay these
rascals for they shall let and trouble us without reason than ye should have
seen the men of arms dasshe in among them / and killed a great nombre of them.
And ever still the englysshmen shot where as they saw thyckest preace: the
sharp arowes ran into the men of arms / and into their horses: and many
fell horse and men among the genowayes: and when they were down they could
not relyue again the preace was so thycke / that one ouerthrewe a another. And
also among the englysshemen there were certain ^ascalles that went a foot /
with great knyues: and they went in among the men of arms / and slew and
murdredde many as they lay on the ground: both earls / barownes / knights /
and squyers: whereof the king of England was after dyspleased / for he had
rather they had been taken prisoners. The valyant king of Behaygne called
Charles of Luzenbourge / son to the noble emperor Henry of Luzenbourge / for
all that he was nyghe blind. When he understood the order of the battle / he
said to them about him / where is the lord Charles my son: his men said sir
we can not tell / we think he be fighting / than he said sirs ye are my men
/ my companyons / and friends in this journey. I require you bring me so far
forward / that I may stryke one stroke with my sword / they said they would
do his commandment: and to the intent that they should not lose him in the
prease / they tied all their raynes of their bridelles each to other and set
the king before to acomplysshe his desire / and so they went on their
enemies: the lord Charles of Behaygne his son / who wrote himself king of
Behaygne and bare the arms. He came in good order to the battle: but whasie
he saw that the matter went a wrie on their party / he departed I can not
tell you which way: the king his father was so far forewarde / that he
struck a stroke with his sword / ye and mo than four: and fought valyantly.
And so did his company / and they adue^tured themself so forward / that they
were there all slain / and the next day they were found in the place about the
king / and all their horses tied each to other. The earl of Alansone came to
the battle right ordynatly and fought with thenglysshmen / and the earl of
Flaunders also on his part / these two lords with their co^panyes coosted the
english archers and came to the princes battle and there fought valyantly
long. The french king would feign have come thither when he saw their
baners / but there was a great hedge of archers before him. The same day the
french king had given a great black courser to sir Johan of Heynault and
he made the lord Johan of Fussels to ride on him and to bear his banerre / the
same horse took the bridell in the tethe / and brought him through all the
currours of the^glysshmen / and as he would have returned again he fell in a
great dyke and was sore hurt / and had been there deed and his page had not ben /
who followed him through all the batayls / and saw where his master lay in the
dyke / and had none other let but for his horse / for thenglysshmen would not
issue out of their battle for taking of any prisoner / than^e the page a
lyghted and relyued his master / than he went not back again ye same way that
they came: there was to many in his way. This battle between Broy / and Crelly
this saturday was right cruel and fell / and many a feat of arms done that
came not to my knowledge: in the night diverse knights and squyers lost their
masters / and sometime came on thenglysshmen / who received them in such wise
/ that they were ever nighe slain / for there was none taken to mercy nor to
ransom* for so the englysshmen were determined in the morning the day of the
battle certain frenchemen and almaygnes / perforce opyned the archers of the
princes battle / and came and fought with the men of armeshande to hand. Than
the second battle of thenglysshmen came to socour the princes battle the
which was time / for they had as than much a do / and they with ye prince
sent a messanger to the king who was on a little wyndmyll hill: than the
knight said to the king / sir therle of Warwyke / and therle of Ca^fort / sir
Reynolde Cobham / and other such as be about the prince your son ar feerlly
fought with all and aresore handled: wherefore they de sire you that you and
your battle wolle come and aid them / for if the frenchmen increase as they
dout they woll / your son and they shall have much a do. Than the king
said is my son deed or hurt / or on the yerthe felled: no sir (...) the
knight but he is hardely matched / wherefore he has need of your aid. Well
said the king return to him and to them that sent you hither / and say to
them that they send no more to me for any adventure that falls / as long as
my son is a live: and also say to the^ that they suffer him this day to win
his spurs / for if god be pleased I woll this journey be his / and the
honor thereof: and to them that be about him. Than the knight returned again
to the^ and showed the kings words / the which greatly encouraged them: and
repoyned in that they had send to the king as they did. Sir Godfray of
Harecourt would gladly that the earl of Harecourt his brother might have been
saved / for he hard say by the^ that saw his baner how that he was there in
the field on the french party / but sir Godfray could not come to him betymes
/ for he was slain or he could come at him and so was also the earl of Almare
his nephue. In another place the earl of Alenson and therle of Flaunders fought
valyantly / every lord under his own baner / but finally they could not
resyst against the puyssaunce of the englysshemen: and so there they were also
slain and diverse other knights and squyers. Also therle Jews of Bloyes
nephue to the french king / and the duke of Lorayne fought under their baners
/ but at last they were closed in among a company of englysshmen and walsshemen
/ and there were slain for all their prowes. Also there was slain the earl of
Ausser / therle of saint Poule and many other / in the evening the french
king who had left about him no mo than a threscore persons one and other /
whereof sir John^ of Heynalt was one / who had remounted ones the King for his
horse was slain with an arowe / tha^ he said to the king sir depart hense
for it is time / lose not your self wylfully: if ye have loss at this time ye
shall recover it again a another season. And so he took the kings horse by
the bridell and led him away in a manner persorce / than the king rode till he
came to the castle of Broy / the gate was closed because it was by that time
dark. Than the king called the captain / who came to the walls and said:
who is that calls there this time of night / than the king said opyn your
gate quickly / for this is the fortune of France. The captain knew than it
was the king / and opyned the gate and let down the bridge: than the king
entered and he had with him but five barownes / sir Johan of Heynault / sir
Charles of Momorency / the lord of Beauiewe / the lord Dabegny / and the
lord of Mountfort: the king would not tarry there but dra^ke and departed
thense about myd night / and so rode by such guydes as knew the country till
he came in the morning to Amyense and there he rested. This saturday the
englysshemen never departed fro their batayls for chasynge of any man / but
kept still their field and ever defended themself against all such as came to
assail them: this battle ended about euynsonge time.

How the next day after the batell the englysshmen disconfyted diverse
frenchemen. Cap. C.xxxi.
ON this saturday when the night was come: and that the^glysshmen hard no more
noise of the fre^chemen / than they reputed themself to have the vyctorie /
and the frenchmen to be dysconfited / slain / and fled away. Than they made
great fyers and lyghted up torchesse and candelles / because it was very dark
/ than the king auayled down fro the little hill where as he stood / and of
all that day till than his helm came never of on his heed. Than he went
withal his battle to his son the prince: and enbrased him in his arms and
kyst him and said fair son god give you good perseverance / year my good
son thus ye have aquyted you nobly: ye ar worthy to keep a realm / the prince
inclyned himself to the yerthe honoring the king his father / this night they
thanked god for their good adventure / and made no boost thereof / for the king
would that no man should be proud or make boost / but every man humbly to
thank god. On the sunday in the morning there was such a mist / that a man
might not se the bredethe of an acre of land fro him / than there departed fro
the host by the commandment of the king and marshalles five hundred spears
/ and two thousand archers: to se if they might se any frenchemen gathered
again together in any place / the same morning out of Abuyle and saint
Reyngnyer in Ponthieu / the commons of Rone and of Beauioys issued out of their
towns natte knowing of the dysco^fiture the day before they met with
the^glysshmen / wenyng they had been frenchmen. And when the^glysshmen saw
them they set on them fresshly / and there was a sore battle / but at last
the frenchemen fled and kept none array / their were slain in the ways and
in hedges and busshes: mo than^e seuyn thousand. And if the day had been clear:
there had never a onescaped / anon after a another company of frenchmen were
met by the englysshmen. The archebysshopp^ of Rone / and ye great priour of
France: who also knew nothing of the dysconfiture the day before for they
hard that the french king should a fought the same sunday: and they were
going thyderwarde. Whan^e they met with the englysshmen there was a great
battle / for they were a great nombre / but they could not endure against the
englysshmen / for they were nyghe all slain / few escaped / the two lords
were slain. This morning thenglysshmen met with diverse french men / that
had lost their way on the saturday / and had layen all night in the feldes /
and wist not where the king was nor the captayns / they were all slain as many
as were met with / and it was showed me: that of the commons and men a foot /
of the cities and good towns of France there was slain four times as many as
were slain the saturday in the great battle.

How the next day after the battle of Cressey / they that were deed were
no^bred by the^glysshmen. Ca. Cxxxii.
THe same sunday as the king of England came fro mass such as had been sent
forth returned and showed the king what they had seen and done: and said sir
we think surely there is now no more aparence of any of our enemies / than ye
king send to search how many were slain / and what they were. Sir Reynolde
Cobham / and sir Richard Stafforde with three haraldes went to search the field
and country: they visyted all the^ that were slain and rode all day in the
feldes / and returned again to the host as the king was going to supper.
They made just report of that they had seen / and said how there were xi.
great princes deed / fourscore baners.xii. C. knights / and mo than.xxx.
thousand other. The^glysshmen kept still their field all yt night on the
monday in the morning the king prepared to depart / the king caused the deed
bodies of the great lords to be taken up and conveyed to Mutterell / and there
buried in holy ground and made a cry in the country to grant truse for three
days / to thyntent that they of the country might search the field of Cressy
/ to bury the deed bodies. Than the king went forth and came before the town
of Muttrell by the sea / and his marshals ran to ward Hedyn: and brent
Ua^bam and Seram / but they did nothing to the castle it was so strong and so
well kept / they lodged that night on the river of Hedyn toward Blangy. The
next day they rode toward Bolayne / and came to the town of Unysame: there
the king and the prince lodged / and tarried there a day to refresshe his men /
and on the Wednysday the king came before the strong town of Calys.

L How the king of England laid siege to Calys and how all the poor people
were put out of the town. Cap. C.xxxiii.
IN the town of Calys there was captain a knight of Burgone called sir John^
de Uieu / and with him was sir Andrewe Dandrehen / sir John^ de Sury / sir
Barbon de Belborne / sir Godfray de lament / sir Pepyn de Urmue and diverse
other knights and squyers. When the king of England was come before Calys / he
laid his siege and ordained bastides between the town and the river / he made
carpenters to make houses and lodgings of great tymbre / and set the houses
like streets / and couerd them with read and brom. So that it was like a
little town: and there was every thing tosell / and a markette place to be
kept every tuesday and saturday * for flesh and fyssh / mercery ware / houses
for cloth for bredde / wine and all other things necessary such as ca^e out
of England * or out of Flanders / there they might bye what they list.
The^glysshmen ran often times into the country of Guynes / and into Triuynois
/ and to the gates of saint Omers / and sometime to Boleyn: they brought into
their host great prays. The king would not assail the town of Calys: for he
thought it but a lost labor / he spared his people and his artillery / and said
how he would famyssh the^ in the town with long siege / without the french
king come and reyse his siege perforce. When the capten of Calys saw the manner
and thorder of the^glysshmen: than he constrained all poor and mean people to
issue out of the town. And on a wednysday there issued out of men women / and
children / mo than.xvii. C. and as they passed through y^ host they were
demanded why they deperted / and they answered and said because they had
nothing to live on. Than the king did them that grace that he suffered them to
pass through his host without danger / and gave them mete and drink to dinner
and every pson.ii. (...) slerlyng in alms / for the which dyners many of them
prayed for the kings prosperyte.

How the duke of Normandy brake up his siege before Aguyllou. Cap. C.xxxiiii.
THe duke of Normandy being at sege before the strong castle of Aguyllou: so
it was that about ye mids of Auguste he made a great assaut to the castle so
that ye most part of his host were at the assaut / thither was come newely the
lord Philyp of Burgone earl of Arthoys / and of Bolone / and cosyn germayn to
the duke of Normandy / he was as than a yo^g lusty knight. And as soon as the
skirmyssh was begone / he took his horse with the spurs and came on the
skirmysshe ward / and the horse took the bytte in his teth / and bare away his
master and stumbled in a dyke / and fell horse and man: the knight was so
brosed with the fall that he had never health after / but dyed of the same
hurt. Than anon after ye french king sent for his son the duke of Normandy
co^maundynge him in any wise to break up his siege before Aguyllou / and to
return into France / to defend his heritage fro the^glysshmen. And thereupon
the duke took counsel of the lords that were there with him / what was best
to do: for he had promised not to depart thens till he had wone the castle /
but the lords counsayled him sithe the king his father had send for him / to
depart. Than the next day be times: the frenchemen trussed bag and baggage in
great have and departed toward France: than they that were within the
fortress issued out with the penon of the lord Gaultiers of Manny before
them: they dasshed in among the hinder company of the frenchemen / and flewe
and took diverse of them to the nombre of threscore and brought them into
their fortres and by those prisoners they knew of the journey that the king
of England had made that season into France / and how that he lay at siege
before Calys. Or the french king departed fro Amyense to Paris ward / after
the battle of Cressy / he was so sore dyspleasedde with sir Godmar du fay /
because the king said he did not his deuer truly in keeping of the passage of
Bla^ch taque / where as the^glysshme^ passed over the river of Some. so yt if
the french king coud a get him in ye hete / it would have cost him his heed /
and diverse of the kings counsel would yt he should a dyed and said he was a
treto^ and causer of ye great loss that the king had at Cressy / but sir
John^ of Heynault excused him / and refrayned the kings yuell will: for he
said / how could it lie in his power to resyst the hole puysance of thengly
sshmen / when all y^ flower of the realm of France together could not resyst
them. Tha^ anon after came to the king and to the queen the duke of Normandy
who was well received with them.

How sir Gaultier of Manny rode through all France by save conduct to Calys.
Cap. C.xxxv.
IT was natlong after but that sir Gaultier of Ma^ny fell in co^munycation with
a knight of Normandy who was his prisoner / and demanded of him what money he
would pay for his ransom / the knight answered and said he would gladly pay
three. M. crowns / well quod the lord Gaultyer: I know well ye be kynne to
the duke of Normandy and well-beloved with him that I am sure. And if I would
sore oppress you I am sure ye would gladly pay.x. thousand crowns / but I
shall deal otherwise with you / I woll trust you on your faith and promise.
ye shall go to the duke your lord / and by your means get a save conduct
for me and.xx. other of my company to ride through France to Calys / payeng
curtesly for all your expenses. And if ye can get this of the duke or of the
king / I shall clearly quyte you your ransom with much thank: for I greatly
desire to se the king my master / nor I will lie but one night in a place
till I come there. And if ye can not do this / return again hyder within a
month / and yield your self still as my prisoner: the knight was content and
so went to Paris to the duke his lord / and he obtained this pasport for sir
Gaultier of Manny and. ^r. horse with him all only this knight returned to
Aguyllon and brought it to (...) Gaultier / and there he quyted the knight
Norman of his ransom. Than anon after sir Gaultier took his way and.xx.
horse with him: and so rode through Auuergne / and when he tarried in any place
he showed his letter and so was let pass but when he came to Orleaunce for
all his letter he was a rested and brought to Paris / and there put in prison
in the Chatelet. When the duke of Normandy knew thereof / he went to the king
his father and showed him how sir Gaultier of Manny had his save conduct /
wherefore he required the king asmoche as he might to deliver him / or else it
should be said how he had be trayed him: the king answered and said how he
should be put to death / for he reputed him for his great ennemy. Than said the
duke: sir if ye do so surely I shall never bear armor against the king of
England / nor all such as I may let: and at his departing he said that he
would never enter again into the kings host. Thus the matter stood a certain
time: there was a knight of Heynalt called sir Mansart de Sue / he purchased
all that he might to help sir Water of Manny / and went often in and out to
the duke of Normandy / finally the king was so cou^selled that he was delyuerd
out of prison and all his costs paid. And the king send for him to his
lodgyng of Nesle in Paris and there he dyned with the king / and the king
presented him great gifts and jewels / to the value of a thousand floreyns:
sir Gaultier of Manny received them on a condycion / that when he came to Cales
that if the king of England his master were pleased that he should take them
/ than he was content to keep them / or else to send the^ again to the french
king / who said he spoke like a noble man. Than^e he took his leave and
departed and rode so long by his iourneys that he came into Heynalt / and
tarried at Ualencennes three days: and so fro thens he went to Cales and was
welcome to the king / but when ye king hard that sir Gaultier of Manny had
received gifts of the french king: he said to him sir Gaultier / ye have
hitherto truly served us and shall do as we trust. Send again to king
Philyppe the gifts that he gave you / ye have no cause to keep them / we
thank god we have enough for us and for you: we be in good purpose to do much
good for you acordyng to the good service that ye have done. Thanne sir
Gaultier took all those jewels and delyuerd the^ to a cosyn of his called
Mansac / and said ride into France to the king there / and reco^mend me unto
him / and say how I thank him. M. times for the gift that he gave me / but
show him how it is not the pleasure of the king my master that I should keep
the^ / therefore I send them again to him. This knight rode to Paris and
showed all this to the king who would not receive again the iewelles / but
did give them to the same knight sir Mansac / who thaked the king and was not
in will to say nay.

/ and also the cite of Poycters. Cap. C.xxxvi.
LE have hard here before / how the earl of Derby was in the city of Burduex
/ during the season of the siege before Aguyllone. And as soon as he knew that
ye duke of Normandy had broken up his siege / than he send into Gascoyne for
all his knights and squyers that held of the english party: than came to
Bordeaux the lord Dalbret / the lord de Lanspere / ye lord of Rosam / the

Bouq^ton / sir Amery of Trast / and diverse other: so that therle had a.xii.
hundred men of arms / two thousand archers / and three thousand fotemen. They
passed theryuer of Garon between Bordeaux and Blay: than they took the way to
zaynton and came to Myrabell / and wan the town with assaut and the castle
also: and set therein new captain and soudyours. Than they rode to Alnoy and
wan the castle and the town / and after they wanne Surgeres / and Benon: but
the castle of Marant a three leages fro Rochell they could not get / than
they went to Mortayn on ye see side in Poyctou and took it perforce / and made
there a garyson for the^. Than they rode to Lusignen / they brent the town but
the castle would not be won / than they went to Taylbourge / and wan the
brige / town / and castle: and stewe all that were within / because a knight
of theyrs was slain in thassautyng. The country was so afraid that every man
fled into strong holds and towns and forsook their own houses they made
none other aparance of defense: but all knights and squyers kept them still in
their fortresses / and made no semblant to fight with thenglysshmen. Than at
last the earl of Derby came and laid siege to saint John^ Dangle and made there
a great assaut / within the town there were no men of war till against night
when thassaut seized. Sir Wyllyam Ryonmayre of the town / and the most part
of the burgesses send to therle of Derby to have a save conduct for six of
their burgesses to come into the host to treat with therle the same night / or
else ye next day / the which was granted: and the next morning these burgesses
came to therles tent / and there concluded to become good englysshmen / as long
as the king of England or some other for him would keep and defend them fro
ye frenchmen. There therle refresshed him in that town three days and took
homage of the burgesses there: than the earl went to the strong town of Nyort
/ wherein was captain the lord Guyssharde Dangle / there therle made three
assautes but nothing could he win / than he departed thens and went to to
Burge saint Maxymen / the which was won perforce and all that were within
slain. After they went to Mo^strell boy (...) / wherein there were a two hundred
money makers that forged there money for the fre^chkyng they said they would
not yield up but defend the town / but there was made such a feerse assaut
that it was won / and all they within slain Therle new fortifyed ye castle
and made there a garyson / than the earl came before the city of Poycters /
the which was great and large: the earl besieged it on the one side for he had
not no^bre sufficyent to lay round about. Incontyne^t they made assaut and
they of they city / who were a great nombre of mean people not very mete for
the war / they defended themself so well at that time that they took but
little damage / the assaut ceased and every man went to his logynge. The next
day certain knights of the host took their horses and rode about the town /
and returned and made report to therle of that they had seen / than they
determined the next day to assaut the city in three places: and the greattest
nombre to assaut where as was the wekest place of the city / and thus it was
done. And as than in the town there was no knight yt knew what meant any feate
of war / nor the people were not erpert in deeds of arms to know how to
defend assautes / so in the wekyst place thenglysshmen entered. When they
within saw the town won they fled away out at other gates but there were
slain a.vii. hundred for all were put to ye sword men / women / and children
/ and the city ouerron and robbed: the which was full of great richesse /
as well of thynhabytauntes as of them of the country that were come thither for
surety / diverse churches were there distroyed and many yuelldedes done and mo
had been dove and therle had not ben / for he commanded on pain of death no
man to breune no church / nor house / for he said he would tarry there a ten
or (...)days / so that thereby part of the yuell deeds wereseased / but for all
that there was roberyes enough. Therle lay there a.xii. days and lengar might
have done if it had pleased him / for there was none to resyst him: all the
country trymbled for fear of him. Than therle departed fro Poycters and left
it void / for it was to great to be kept / at their departing they had so
much richesse that they wist natte what to do therewith / they set by
nothing but gold and silver / and feathers for men of war. Thanne they
returned by small iourneys to saint Johan Dangle / there therle rested him a
certain space / and thenglysshmen gave many good iuels to the ladies and
damsels of ye town / and so did therle himself and made every day great dyners
/ suppers / and bankettes / and made great revel and sport among them: he
achyued such grace among them there / that they said he was the most noble
prince that ever rode on horseback. Than he took his leave of the^ / and made
the mayre and ye burgesses to renew their oath and to keep the town as the
right heritage of the king of England / than the earl returned by such
fortresses as he had won / till he ca^e to therytie of Bourdeaux: than he
gave leave every man to depart / and thanked them of their good service.

How the king of Scotts during the siege before Calys came into England with a
great host. Ca. C.xxxvii.
IT is long now sith we spoke of king Dauyd of Scotland / how be it till
now there was none occasion why / for the trewse that was takenue was well and
trewly kept. So that when the king of England had be sieged Calays and lay
there / than the Scotts determined to make war into England / and to be
revenged of such hurtes as they had taken before / for they said than / how
that the realm of England was void of men of war / for they were as they
said with the king of England before Calys / and some in Bretaygne / Poyctou /
and Gascoyne: the french king did what he could to stir the scotts to that
war / to the intent that the king of England should break up his siege /
and return to defend his own realm The king of Scotts made his sommons
to be at saint John^s town / on the river of Tay in Scotland: thither came
earls / barownes / and prelates of Scotland: and there agreed that in all
haste possible / they should enter into England / to come in that journey was
desired Johan of the out Isles / who governed the wild scotts: for to him they
obeyed and to no man else. He came with a three thousand of the most
outragyoust people in all that country. When all the scotts were assembled /
they were of one and other / a fyftie thousand fighting men: they could not
make their assemble so secret / but that the queen of England / who was as
thanne in the marchesse of the North about york / knew all their dealing.
Than^e she sent all about for men / and lay herself at york: than all men
of war and archers came to Newcastell with the queen. In the mean season the
king of scotts departed fro saint Johannes town / and went to Done Fremelyne

and distroyenge the country of Northumberlande / and their currours ran to
york and brent as much as was without the walls and returned again to
their host / within a days journey of Newcastell upon Tyne.

Of the battle of New castle upon Tyne / between the queen of England and the
king of scotts. Cap. C.xxxviii.
THe queen of England who desired to defend her country came to Newcastell
upon Tyne / and there tarried for her me^ who came daily fro all ^tes. When the
scotts knew that the english men assembled at Newcastell they drue
thyderwarde / and their currours came rennynge before the town: and at their
retournynge they brent certain small hamelettes there about / so that the
smoke thereof ca^e into the town of Newcastell: some of the englysshmen would a
issued out to have fought with them that made the fyers / but the captayns
would not sulfre them to issue out. The next day y^ king of scotts with a.xl.
thousand men one and other / came and lodged within three little english mile
of Newcastell in the land of the lord Neuyll / and the king sent to them
within the town that if they would issue out into the field / he would fight
with them gladly. The lords and prelates of England / said they were content
to adventure their lives with the ryghtand heritage of the king of England
their master: than they all issued out of the town / and were in nombre a
twelfe hundred men of arms / three thousand archers / and seuyne thousand of
other with the walsshmen. Than the scotts came and lodged against them / nere
together: than every man was set in order of battle / than the queen ca^e
among her men: and there was ordained four batayls / one to aid another. The
first had in governance the bishop of Dyrham / and the lord Percy: the
second the archbysshoppe of york / and the lord Neuyll: the third the
bishop of Lyncolne / and the lord Mo^bray The fourth the lord Edward de
Baylleule captain of Berwyke / the archbysshopp of Canterbury / and the lord
Rose / every battle had like no^bre after their quantyte: the queen went fro
battle to battle desyring them to do their deuoyre to defend the honor of
her lord the king of England / and in the name of god every man to be of good
heart and courage promysyng them that to her power she would remember them
as well or better / as though her lord the king were there personally. Than the
queen departed fro them reco^mendyng them to god and to saint George / than
anon after the bataylles of the scotts began to set forward / and in like
wise so did the^glysshmen / than the archers began to shote on both parties:
but the shot of the scotts endured but a shortspace: but ye archers of
England shot so feersly / so that when the batayls aproched there was a hard
batell. They began at nine and endured till noone / the scotts had great ares
sharp and hard / and gave with them many great strokes / howbeit finally
thenglysshmen obtained the place and vyctorie but they lost many of their me.
There were slain of the scotts / therle of Sys / therle of Ostre / the earl
Patrys / therle of Surlant / therle Dastredare / therle of Mare / therle John^
Duglas and the lord Alysaunder Ramsey who bare the kings baner: and diverse
other knights and squyers. And there the king was taken / who fought
valiantly and was sore hurt: a squire of Northumberland took him called John^
Coplande / and as soon as he had taken the king he went with him out of the
field with.viii. of his seruaunces with him and so rode all that day till he
was a fyftene leages fro the place of ye battle / and at night he ca^e to a
castle called Oryulus. And than he said he would not deliver the king of
scotts to no man nor woman lyueyng / but all only to the king of England
his lord: the same day there was also taken in the field the earl Morette /
the earl of March / the lord Wyllyam Duglas / ye lord Robert Uesy / the
bishop of Dadudame / the bishop of saint Andrews / and diverse other

How John^ Copland had the king of Scotts prisoner / and what profet he gatte
thereby. Cap. C.xxxix.
When the queen of England being at Newcastell / understood how the journey
was for her and her men: she than rode to the place where the battle hade ben
/ than^e it was showed her how the king of scotts was taken by a squire
called John^ Coplande / and he had carried away the king no man knew whyder.
Than the queen wrote to the squire co^maundyng him to bring his prisoner the
king of scotts / and how he had not well done to depart with him without
leave: all that day thenglysshmen tarried still in ye same place / and the queen
with them: and the next day they returned to New castle. When the queen's
letter was brought to Johan Coplande: he answered and said that as for the king
of scotts his prisoner he would not deliver him to no man nor woman lyueng but
all only to the king of England his souer ayne lord. As for the king of
scotts he said he should be sauely kept / so that he would give acompte for him
/ thanne the queen send letters to the king to Calays whereby the king was
enfourmed of the state of his realm / than the king send inco^tynent to Johan
Coplande / that he should come over the sea to him to the siege before Calays.
Than the same Johan did put his prisoner in save keeping in a strong castle
/ and so rode through England till he ca^e to Dover / and there took the sea
and arrived before Calays. When the king of England saw the squire he took
him by the hand and said / a welcome my squire / that by your valyantnesse
has taken mine adversary the king of Scotts / the squire kneled down and
said: sir if god by his grace have suffered me to take ye king of scotts by
true conquest of arms / sir I think no man ought to have any envy there at /
for as well god may send by his grace such a fortune to fall to a poor squire
/ as to a great lord and (...) I require your grace be not myscontent with me
/ though I did not deliver the king of Scotts at the commandment of the
queen / Sir I hold of you as mine oath is to you / and not to her but in all
good manner: the king said Johan the good service that ye have done and your
valyantnesse is somoche worth / that hit must counteruayle your trespass /
and be taken for your excuse / and shame have they that bear you any yuell will
therefore. ye shall return again home to your house / and tha^^e my pleasure
is that ye deliver your prisoner to ye queen my wife: and in a reward I
assign you nere to your house where as ye think best yourselfe tyue hundred
pound sterlyng of yearly rent / to you and to your heirs for ever: and here I
make you squire for my body. Than^e the third day he departed and returned
again into England and when he came home to his own house he assembled to
guyder his friends and kynne / and so they took the king of Scotts and rode
with him to the city of york / and there fro the king his lord / he
presented the king of Scotts to ye queen and excused him so largely / that the
queen and her counsel were content. Than the queen made good prouisyon for the
city of york the castle of Rosbourg / the cite of Dyrham / the town of
Newcastell upon Tyne / and in all other garysons on the marchesse of Scotland
/ and left in those marchesse the lord Percy / and the lord Neuyll / as
gouernoure there: thanne the queen departed fro york toward London. Than she
set the king of Scotts in the strong tower of London / and therle Morette /
and all other prisoners: and set good keeping over them. Than she went to
Dover and there took the sea / and had so good wind that in a short space
she arrived before Calays three days before the feast of Alsayntes / for whose
coming the king made a great feast and dinner to all the lords and ladies that
were there / the queen brought many ladies and damoselles with her as well to
acompany her / as to se their husbands / fathers / brethren / and other
friends that lay at siege there before Calays / and had done a long space.

How the young earl of Flaunders ensured the kings daughter of England. Cap.
C.xl.
THe siege before Calais enduredde long / and many things fell in the mean
season / the which I can not write the fourth part. The french king had
set men of war in every fortress in those marchesse in the county of
Guynes / of At thoyes / of Boloyne / and about Calays / and had a great nombre
of genowayes / normayns / and other on the sea: so that when any of th(...)
glysshmen would goo a forragynge other a (...) or horseback / they found many
times hard adventures / and often there was skirmysshing about the gates and
dykes of the town / and often times some slain and hurt on both parties /
some day y^ one part lost and some day the other. The king of England caused
engyns to be made to oppress them within the town / but they within made
other again to resist the so that they took little hurt by them / but nothing
could come into the town but by stelth / and that was by the means of two
maryners / one called Maraunt / and the other Mestryell / and they dwelt in
Abuyle / by them two they of Calays were often times reconforted and fresshed
by stelth and often times they were in great ^yll / chased and nere taken: but
always they escaped and made many englysshemen to be drowned. All that winter
the king lay ^^yll at the siege / and thought and ymagined ever to keep y^
commentie of Flaunders in frendshyppe / for he thought by their means the
sooner to c^e to his intent / he send often times to them with fair promyses:
saying that if he might get Calys he would help them to recover (...) / and
Doway with all their appurtenaunces. So by occasyon of sache promyses / while
the king was in Normandy toward Cressey and Calays / they went and laid siege
to Bethwyn / and there captain was sir Dedeart de ^onty who was banysshed out
of France. They held a great siege before that town / and ^ore constrained
them by assaut / but within were ^our knights captayns set there by ye french
king to keep the town / that is to say sir G^ssray of Charney sir Ewstace of
Rybamount / sir Ba^dwy^ of Nekyn / and sir John^ of Landas: they defended y^
town in such wise / that the flemmynges wa^ nothing there / but so departed
and returned again into Flaunders / but while the king of England lay at
siege before Calys he sent still messa^gers to them of Flanders and made them
great promyses to keep their amyte with him / and to oppress the drift of the
french king who did all that he could to draw them to his opinion. The king
of England would gladly y^ the earl Loyes of Flaunders / who was as than ^^t
f^fte^e year of age / should have in mar^age his daughter Isabell: somoche did
the king y^ the fle^mynges agreed thereto whereof the king was glad / for he
thought by that marriage the fle^mynges would the gladlyer help him / and the
fle^mynges thought by having of the king of England on their party they
might well r^^yst the frenchmen: they thought it more necessary and profitable
for them / the love of the king of England rather than the french king / but
the young earl who had been ever norysshed among the noble men of France would
not agree and said plainly he would not have to his wife the daughter of him
that sle^e his father. Also duke Johan of Brabant purchased greatly that y^
earl of Flaunders should have his daughter in marriage / promysing him that if
he would take her to his wife / that he would cause him to enjoy the hole
erldome of Flanders / other by ^ayre means or otherwise. Also the duke said
to the french king / sir if the earl of Flanders woll take my daughter I shall
find the means that all the flemmynges shall take your part and for sake the
king of England / by the which promise the french king agreed to that
marriage. When the duke of Brabant had the kings good will: than he sent
certain messa^gers into Fla^ders to the burgesses of the good towns / and
showed them so fair reasons / that the counsayles of the good towns sent to
the earl their natural lord / certifyeng him that if he would come into
Flanders and use their counsel they would be to him true and good friends /
and deliver to him all the rightes and iurysdictyons of Fla^ders / asmoche as
ever any earl had. The earl took counsel and went into Flaunders: where he
was received with great ^oye / and given to him many great presents. Ass one
as the king of England hard of this he send into Flaunders the earl of
Northampton / therle of Arundell / and the lord Cob^am / they did somoche
with the officers and commons of Flaunders / that they had rather that their
lord therle should take to his wife the king of Englandes daughter / than the
daughter of the duke of Brab^t / And so to do they affectuously desired their
lord and showed him many fair reasons / to draw him to that way: so that the
burgesses that were on the duke of Brabantes party durst not say the contrary
/ but than the earl in nowyse would concent thereto / but ever he said he would
natte wedde her whose father had slain his / though he might have half of the
hole realm of England. Whan^e the flemmynges saw that: they said how their
lord was to much french and yuell counsayled / and also said how they would
do no good to him / sith he would not belyue their counsayls: than they took
and put him in Cortoyse prison and said how he should never depart without
he would follow and believe their counsayls. Also they said that the earl his
father belyued and loved to much the frenchemen / for if he would a byleued
the^ he should have been the greattest lord in all christendom / and recovered
again Lysle / Doway / and Bethwyn / and yet alive. Thus the matter abode a
certain space: the king of England lay still at the siege before Calays /
and kept a great court that Christmas. And about the beginning of lent after:
came thither out of Gascoyne the earl of Derby / the earl of Penbroke / the earl
of Can forte / and diverse other knights and squyers / that had passed the sea
with the earl. Thus the earl of Flaunders was long in danger among the
stemynges in Cortoyse prison / and it greatly anoyed him. Than at last he said
he would believe their counsel: for he knew well he said that he should have
more profet there / than in any other country. These words reioysed greatly
the flemynges: than they took him out of prison / and suffered him to go a
haukyng to the river the which sport the earl loved well * but ever there was
good watch laid on him / that he should not steal away fro them: and they
were charged on their lives to take good head to him. And also they were such
as were favorable to the king of England: they watched him so nere that he
could not pysse without their knowledge This endured so long that at last the
earl said that he would gladly have to his wife the king of Englandes daughter
than the flemmynges send word thereof to the king and to y^ queen and poynted
a day that they should come to Bergus in the abbey / and to bring their
daughter with them / and they would bring thither their lord the earl of
Flanders: and there to conclude up the marriage. The king and the queen were
glad thereof: and said that the flemmynges were good men / so to Bergus
between Newport and Grauelynge / came the most saddest men of the good towns
in Flaunders / and brought with the^ the earl their lord in great estate. The
king of England and y^ queen were there ready: the earl curtesly inclyned to the
king and to the queen / the king took the earl by the right hand right swetely
and led him forth: saying as for the death of the earl your father / as god
help me: the day of the battle of Cressey nor the next day after I never
herd word of him that heshulde be there / the young earl by se^blant made as
though he had been content with the kings excuse / than they fill in
communycacyon of the marriage / there were certain artycles agreed unto by the
king of England / and the earl Loyes of Flaunders: and great amyties there was
swor^e between them to be holden. And there the earl fyaunced Isabell the king
of Englandes daughter: and promised to wedde her * so that journey brake of and
a new day to be appointed at more leaser / the flemmynges returned into
Flaunders with their lord / and the king of England with the queen went
again to the siege of Calays. Thus the matter stood a certain time: and the
king and the queen prepayred greatly again the marriage for iewelles and other
things to give away / acordyng to their behauyours. The earl of Flanders daily
past the time at the river and made semblant that this marriage pleased him
greatly: so the flemmynges thought that they were than sure enough of him / so
that there was not so great watch made on him as was before / but they knew
not well the co^dycion of their lord / for what soever countenance he made out
ward / his inward courage was all french. So on a day he went forth with
his hawks / the same weke y^ the marriage should have been finysshed / his
fauconer cast of a faukon to an hearon / and therle cast of a another: so these
two faukons chased the hearon / and the earl rode after as to follow his
faucon. And when he was a good way of and had the advantage of the feldes: he
dasshed his spurs to his horse / and galoped forth in such wise that his
kepars lost him / still he galoped forthright / till he came into Arthoyes and
there he was in surety. And so than he rode into France to king Philyp and
showed him all his adventure: the king and the frenchmen said how he had dalt
wisely / the englysshmen on the othersyde said how he had betrayed and
disceyued them * but for all that the king left not to keep the flemmynges in
amyte: for he knew well the earl had done this deed not by their counsel /
for they were sore dyspleased therewith. And the excuse that they made: the king
soon byleued it in that behalf.

How sir Robert of Namure did ho^age to the king of England before Calays.
Cap. C.xli.
While the king lay at siege before Calays / there came to se the king and the
queen diverse lords and knights of Flanders * of Brabant / of Heynault / and
of Almaygne: and there departed none again / but that had great gifts given
them. The same season there was newely come into the county of Namure and of
Liege dut of the holy land sir Robert of Namure: and the lord of Lespentyne
had made him knight at the holy sepulcre. This sir Robert was as than a young
lusty knight: and was not desired of any of both kings / than he came of his
own good mind well aco^panyed and richely / to the siege before Calayes: and
there presented himself to the king of England / who joyfully received him /
and so did the queen and all the other lords: he entered greatly into the
kings favor * because he bare the name of sir Robert de Arthoys his vucle.
Thus sir Robert became the kings liege man / the king gave him three hundred
pound sterlynge by year out of his cofers / to be paid at Bruges: there he
tarried with the king before Calays till the town was won / as ye shall here
after.

How thenglysshmen wanne the Rochdaren / and how sir Charles de Bloyes laid
siege thereto. Ca. C.xlii.
IT is long now sith we spoke of sir Charles de Bloyes / as than the duke of
Bretaygne / and of the countess of Mountforde: but it was because of the truse
that was takenne at Uannes / the which was well kept. For during the trewse
either party kept peasably that they had in possessyon: and as soon as the
trewse was expyred / they made again feerse war. There was come into
Bretaygne fro the king of England sir Thomas Dangorne / and sir Johan
Harewell / they came thither fro the siege of Calays with a hundred men of arms
/ and four hundred archers. They tarried with the countes of Mount forde at
Hanybout / and with them sir (...) of the castle bretone bretonant:
thenglysshmen and bretons of y^ part made often times iourneys against sir
Charles de Bloyes men sometime they wanne and sometime they lost the cu^tre was
expled and distroyed by reason of these men of war. On a day these
englysshmen went and laid siege to a good town called Rochedaren and often
times they made a^^autes / but the town was so well defended that
thenglysshmen wanne nothing / captain within the town was Tassartde Guynes /
they within y^ town were three parts / ratherenglysshe than french. And so
they took the capytayne and said they would stee him: without he would yelos
himself english to them / thanne hesayde he would do as they would have him
/ and so thereupon they let him go: and than he t^ryed with the englysshmen and
turned to the countes of Mountfordes part. And so he was still capytayne of
the town: and left certain soudyers to keep the town and castle / when sir
Charles du Bloyes herd thereof / he swear that the matter should natte long
beso. Thatic he send for men all about Bretaygne / and Normandy* and
assembled in the city of Nauntes sixtene hundred men of arms / and twelfe
thousand a foot: there were with him a four hundred knights and.xxiiii.
baners. So he ca^e and laid siege to Rochdaren: lately before won by the
englysshmen / and had great engyns that cast day and night / the which sore
constrained them within. Than they of the town send messangers to the
countess of Mountforde / that acordynge to her promise to send them some
aid and conforte / than the countess send all about to assemble men toguyder
* and shortly she had a thousand men of arms / and eight thousand a foot
* and she made capytayns of them the foresaid three knights / who said they
would never return till they had raised the seige before Rochdaren / or else
to dye in y^ quarrel. And so they set forth and came nere to the host of
sir Charles of Bloyes / and lodged by a river side that night / to thyntent to
fight the next day and when every man was at rest: sir Thomas Dangorne / and
sir Johan Artwell caused half their company to be armed / and depted fro them
host about mydnight / and suddenly entered into the lord Charles host on y^
one side * and beat down and slew much people / and they tarried so long
that all the host was moved and every man ready / so that they could not
return again without battle. There they were enclosed and fought withal
sharply / so that they might not bear the frenchmens deeds / but there they
were taken / and sir Thomas Dangorne sore hurt / but sir Johan Artwell saved
himself as well as he might by the river / and returned to his company and
showed them his adventure thanne they were determined to have returned again
to Hanybout.

Of the battle of Rochedaren and how sir Charles de Bloys was there taken by
thenglysshmen. Cap. C.xliii.
THe same seson that the englysshemen were thus in counsel / and had
determined to have departed: there came to them a knight from the countess of
Mountforte called Garnyer lord of Cadudall with a hundred men of arms. And
as soon as he was come and knew all their demenour: h^ said nay sirs let us
not thus turn again / leap on your horses and such as have non let them
come a foot. Let us now go look on our enemies: for now they think them
self sure I warant we shall dysconfet the^. Than the horsemen rode forth and
the fotemen followed / and about the son rysinge they dasshed into the lord
Charles ho^st / and every manne there was a sleep and a^ rest / for they thought
to have no more a do at that time. Thenglysshmen and bretous beat down tents
and pauilyons / and slew people down right / for they were suddenly taken /
there was much people slain: and sir Charles of Bloyes / and all the lords of
Bretayne and Normandy that were there with him were taken prisoners. Thus the
siege of Rochdaren was raised / and the lord Charles was brought to Hanyboute
* but such fortresses as were of his party held still / for his wife who
called her self duchess of Bretaygne / took the war in hand.

How the french king assembled a great host to raise the king of England fro
the siege be fore Calys. Ca. C.xliiii.
King Philyppe who knew well how his men were sore constrained in Calays *
commanded every manne to be with him at the feast of Pentecost / in the cite
of Amyense or there about: there was non durst say nay. The king kept there a
great feast thither came duke Odes of Burgoyne / and the duke of Normandy his
eldyst son / and the duke of Orlya^se his youngest son: the duke of Burbon /
therle of Fo^tz / the lord Loyes of Sau^y sir John^ of Heynalt / the earl of
Armynake / the earl of Forestes / therle of Ualentenoys / and diverse other
earls / barons / and knights. When they were all at Amyense they took
counsel / y^ french king would gladly that the passages of Flaunders might
have been opyned to him: for than he thought he might send part of his men to
Grauelyng / and by that way to refresshe the town of Calys / and on that side
to fight easily with thenglysshmen. He send great messangers into Flanders to
treat for that matter / but the king of England had there such friends that
they would never acorde to yt curtesy / than the french king said how he
would go thither on the side toward Burgoyne. The king of England saw well
how he could not g^t Calays b^t by famyne / than he made a strong castle and
a high to close up the passage by the sea and this castle was set between the
town and the sea / and was well fortyfied with springalles bombardes / bows /
and other artillary. And in this castle were threscore men of arms / and two
hundred archers they kept the hauyn in such wise that nothing could come in
nor out / it was thought that thereby they within should the sooner be famysshed.
In that season the king of England so exhorted them of Flaunders that there
issued out of Flaunders a hundred thousand / and went and laid ^iege to the
town of Air * and brent the con^rey all about / as M^nyuell la gorge /
Estelles le Uentre / and a march called la Lo: and to the gates of saint Omer
/ and Turwyne. Than the king went to the town of Arras / and set many men of
war to the garysons of Arthoys / and specially he sent his constable sir
Charles of S^aygne to saint Omers / for the earl of Ewe and of Guynes / who was
constable of France was prisoner in England as it has been showed before. The
flemmynges did the frenchmen great trouble or they departed: and when the
fle^mynges were returned than the french king and his company deperted fro
Arras and went to Hedyn / his host with ye caryage held well in length a three
l^ages of that country and there he tarried a day / and the next day to Blangy.
There he rested to take advise what way to go forth: than he was counsayled to
go through the country called la Belme / and yt way he took and with him a. CC.
M. one and other and so passed by the county of Franqueberg / and so came
straight to the hill of Sangattes / between Calys and Wyssant. They came thither
in goodly order with baners displayed / that ^it was great beauty to behold
their puyssaut array / they of Calys when they saw them lodge it seemed to them
a new siege.

How the king of England ma^e the passages about Calay^ to be well kept / that
the french king should not aproche to ^eyse his siege. Cap. C. xl^.
VE shall here what the king of England did and caused to be done whan^e he
saw and knew that the french king came with so great an host to raise the
siege / the which had cost him somoche good and pain of his body / and lost
many of his me^: and knew well how he had so constrained the town / that hit
could not long endure for defaute of vitayls / it grieved him sore than to
depart. Than he aduysed well how the frenchmen coud^ not aproche another to his
host nor to the town / but in two places / other by the downs by the sea
side / or else above by the hygheway / and there was many dykes / rocks / and
maresshes / and but one way to pass over a bridge called Newlande bridge.
Than^e the king made all his na^y to draw a long by the cost of the downs
every ship well garnysshed with ^o^bardes / cross ^owes / archers / springalles
/ and other artyllary: whereby the french host might ^at pass that way. And
the king caused the earl of D^^^y to go and keep Newlande bridge with a great
no^bre of men of arms and archers / so that the fre^chemen could natte pass
no way without they would have gone through the marshes / the which was
impossible. On the othersyde toward Calys / there was a high tower kept with.
(...). archers / and they kept the passage of y^ downs fro the frenchmen / the
which was well fortifyed with great and double ^ykes. When the french men were
thus lodged on the mount of Sangate: the commons of Turney who were a fyftene
hundred came to that tower / and they within shot at them / but they passed
the dykes and came to the foot of the wall with pykes and hokes / there was a
fore assaute and many of them of Tourney sore hurt / but at last they wanne
the tower / and all tha^ were within slain / and the tower beaten down. The
french king sent his marshals to advise what way he might aproche to fight with
the englysshem^^ / so they went forth and when they had aduysed the passages
and straytes / they returned to the king and said / how in nowyse he could
come to the englysshmen / without he would lose his people. So the matter rested
all that day and night after / the next day after mass the french king
send to the king of England / the lord Goffray of Charney / the lord
Ewstace of Rybamount / Guy of Nele / and the lord of Bea^ewe and as they rod
that strong way / they saw well it was hard to pass that way. They praised
much the order that the earl of Derby kept there at the bridge of Newlande /
by the which they passed / than they rode till they came to the king / who
was well acompanyed with nobl^ men about him than^e they fou^e lyghted and
came to the king / and did their reverence to him / than the lord Ewstace of
Rybamont (...) sir the king my master sends you word by us that he is come
to the mount of Sangate to us battle with you but he can find no way to
come to you. Therefore sir he wol^e that y^ should apoynt certain of your
counsel / and in likewise of his / and they between them to advise a place
for the battle. The king of England was ready aduysed to answer and said sirs
I have well understand that ye des^re m^ on the behalf of mine adversary /
who kepe^^ wrongfully fro me mine heritage: wher^ore I am sor^e. Say unto him
fro me if ye list (...) I am here and so have been nyghe an ho(...) and all
this he knew right well / he might (...) come hither sooner if he had would /
but he has suffered me to abide ^ere so long the which (...) ben greatly to my
cost and charge / I ^^we co^de do somoche if I would to be sone lord of
^alays / wherefore I am natte determynedd^ to follow his deuyse and ^ase / nor
to depart (...) which I am at the point to win / and that I have so ^ore
desired and derely bought * wherefore if he nor his men can pass this way /
lett^ them seek some other passage if they thynk^ to come hither. Than^e these
lords departe^ (...) were conveyed till they were paste Newlande bridge * than
they showed the french king the king of Englan^es answer. In the (...)
season while the french king studied ho^^ to ^ight with the king of England
/ the^ ca(...) into his host two cardynalles from pope Cl^ment in legacion /
who took great pay^e to (...) between these hoostes / and they procuredde so
much that the^ was granted a certain tre^tie of acorde / and a respyte
between the two kings / and their men being there at siege and in the field
all only. And so the^ were four lord^^ appointed on either party to counsel
together / and to treat for a peace for the french king there was the duke of
Burgoyne / and the duke of Burbone / sir Loyes of Sauoy / and sir John^
Heynalt. And for thenglysshe party: therle of Derby the earl of Northamton the
lord Reynolde Cobham / and the lord Gaultyer of Manny. and the two
cardynalles were means between the parties. These lords met three days and
many deuyses put forth / but none took effect: and in the mean season the
king of England always fortifyed his host and field and made dykes on the
downs / that the frenchmen should not suddenly come on the^. These three days
passed without any agreement than the two cardynalles returned to saint Dmers /
and when the french king saw that he could do nothing / the next day he
dysloged be times and took his way to Amyens / and gave every man leave to
depart. Whan^e they within Calays saw their king depart they made great
sorrow: some of the englysshmen followed the tail of the french men: and wanne
summers carts / and caryages / horse / wine and other things: and took
prisoners / whom they brought into the host before Calays.

How the town of Calys was given up to the king of England. Cap. C.xlvi.
AFter that the french king was thus departed fro Sangate they within Calays
saw well how their so coure failed the^ / for the which they were in great
sorrow Than they desired somoche their captayn sir John^ of Uyen / that he went
to the walls of the town / and made a sign to speak with some person of the
host. When the king hard thereof / he send thither sir Gaultier of Many / and
sir Basset: than sir John^ of Uyen said to them: sirs ye be right valy ant
knights in deeds of arms / and ye know well how the king my master has
send me and other to this town / and commanded us to keep it to his behofe:
in such wise that we take no blame nor to him no damage / and we have done
all that lies in our power. Now our socours has failed us / and we be so
sore strayned that we have not to live withal / but that we must all dye / or
else e^rage for famyn: without the noble and gentle king of yours woll take
mercy on us / the which to do we require you to desire him to have pity on us /
and to let us go and depart as we be / and let him take the town and castle
and all the goods that be therein / y^ which is great habundaunce. Than sir
Gaultyer of Manny said / (...) we know somewhat of the entencyon of the king
our master for he has showed it unto us / surely know for troth it is not
his mind that ye nor they within the town should depart so / for it is his
will that ye all should put your selfs into his pure will to ransom all such
as pleases him / and to put to death such as he list / for they of Calays
has done him such co^traryes and dispyghtes / and has caused him to
dyspende so much good / and lost many of his men: that he is sore grieved
against them / than the captaynesayde / sir this is to hard a matter to us / we
arhere within a small sort of knights and squyers / who has trewely served
the king our master / as well as ye serve yors. In lyk^ case and we have
endured much pain and unease / but we shall yet endure asmoche pain as ever
knyght^ did rather thaune to consent that the worst ladde in the town should
have any more yuell / than the grettest of us all. Therefore sir we pray you
that of your humylite / yet that ye woll go and speak to the king of England:
and desire him to have pytie of us / for we trust in him somoche gentylnesse /
that by the gace of god his purpose shall chaung. Sir Gaultier of Manny and sir
Basset returned to the king / and declared to him all that had been said:
the king said he would none otherwise / but that they should yield them up
symply to his pleasure / than sir Gaultyersayde sir saving your dyspleasure in
this: ye may be in the wrong / for ye shall give by this an yuell ensample /
if ye send any of us your servants into any fortress we woll not be very
glad to go / if ye put any of them in the town to death after they be
yielded / for in like wise they woll deal with us / if the case fell like: the
which words diverse other lords that were there present sustained and
maynteyned. Than the king said / sirs I woll not be alone against you all /
therefore sir Gaultyer of Manny ye shall goo and say to the capytayne / that all
the grace that he shall find now in me is / that they let six of the
chief burgesses of the town come out bare he^^ed / bare foted and bare legged
/ and in their shertess with haulters about their neckess / with the (...) of
the town and castle in their hands / an^ let they in si^e yield themself
purely to my will / and the resydewe I will take to mercy. Than sir Gaultyer
returned and found sir John^ of Uyen ^^yll on the wall / abydinge for an
answer: ^hanne sir Gaultier showed him all the grace that he could get of
the king / well (...) sir Johan: sir I require you tarry here a certain
spacetyll I go in to the town and show this to the commons of the town / who
sent me hyder. Than sir John^ went unto the market place and so wned the common
bell / than incontinent men and women assembled there / than the captain mane
report of all that he had done / and said sirs it will be none otherwise
therefore now take advise and make a short answer. Thanne all the people
began to weep and to make such sorrow that there was not so hard a heart if
they had seen the^ / but that would have had great pytie of them: the captain
him self wept pyt^on^^y. At last the most rich burgess of all the town
called Ewstace of saint Peter's / rose up and said openly. Sirs great and small
/ great myschiefe it should be to suffer to dye such people as be in this
town / other by famyn or otherwise: when there is a mean to save them / I
think he or they should have great merytte of our lord god that might keep
them fro such myschie^e: as for my part I have so good trust in our lord
god that if I dye in the quarrel to save the restdewe that god would pardone
me. Wherefore to save them I will be the first to put my life in teopardy:
When he had thus said every man worshypped him / and diverse kneled down at
his fete with sore weeping and sore sighs. Tha^ another honest burgess rose
and say^e I will keep company with my gossyppe Ewsface / he was called John^
Dayre / than rose up Jaques of Wyssant / who was rich in goods and heritage:
he said also that he would hold company with his two cosyns in likwyse / so
^yd Peter of Wyssant his brother / and than^e rose two other they said they
would do the same: thanne they went and aparelled them as the kyng^ besyred.
Than the captain went with them to the gate / there was great lameutacyon made
of men / women / and children at their departing: than the gate was opyned and
he issued out with the. vt burgesses and closed the gate again / so (...) they
were between the gate and the barriers. Than he said to sir Gaultier of Ma^ny:
sir I (...) here to you as captain of Calays / by the hole consent of all the
people of the town these six bu^ gesses / and I swear to you truly that they
be and were to day most honorable / rich / and most notable burgesses of all
y^ town of Calys wherefore ge^tyll knight I require you / pray the king to have
mercy on them that they dye not / quod sir Gaultier I can not say what the
king will do / but I shall do for them the best I can: than^e the barryers were
opyned the six burgesses went toward the king and the captain entered again
into the town. When sir Gaultier presented these burgesses to the king they
kneled down and held up their hands and said: gentle king behold here we
six who were burgesses of Calays and great marchantes / we have brought to you
the kayes of the town and of the castle / and we submyt our self clearly
into your will and pleasure / to save the resydue of the people of Calays / who
have suffered great pain. Sir we bescche your grace to have mercy and pytie on
us through your high nobles: than all the earls and barownes / and other that
were ther^ wept for pytie. The king looked felly on them / for greatly he hated
the people of Calys: for the gre^ damages and dyspleasures they had done him on
the sea before. Than he commanded their heedes to be stryken of / than every
man required the king for mercy / but he would here no ma^in that behalf: than
sir Gaultier of Ma^ny said a noble king for goddessake refrain your courage /
ye have the name of souerayn nobles therefore now do not a thing that should
blemysshe your renome / nor to give cause to some to speak of you villainy /
every man woll say it is a great cruelty to put to death such honest persons /
who by their own wylles put themself into your grace to save their company.
Than the king wryed away fro him and commanded to send for y^ hangman / and
said they of Calys has caused many of my me^ to be slain / wherefore these
shall dye in likewise. Than the queen being great with child / kneled down
and sore weeping said: a ge^tyll sir sith I passed the sea in great parell I
have despred nothing of you / therefore now I humbly require you in y^ honor
of the son of the virgyn Mary and for the love of me / yt ye woll take mercy of
these six burgesses. The king be held y^ queen and stood still in a study a
space and tha^ said / a dame I would ye had been as now in so^e other place / ye
make such request to me y^ I can not ^eny you: wherefore I give them to you to
do your pleasure with them / than the queen caused the^ to be brought into her
chamber / and made ye halters to be taken fro their necks and caused them to
be new clothed and gave them their dinner at their leser. And than she gave each
of them sire nobles and made the^ to be brought out of thoost in sauegard / and
set at their lyberte.

How the king of England repeopled the town of Calys with englysshmen. Cap.
C.xlvii.
THus the strong town of Calays was given up to king Edward of England the
year of our lord god. M CCC.xlvi. in the month of august / the king of
England called to him sir Gaultier of Manny and his two marshals / therle of
Warwyke and therle of Stafforde and said to the^. Sirs take here the kayes of
the town and castle of Calys / go and take possessyon there and put in
prison all the knights that be there / and all other soudyours that came
thither symply to win their lyueng / cause them to avoid the town. And also
all other men / women and children / for I would repeople again the town with
pure englysshmen. So these three lords with a hundred with them went and took
possessyon of Calys / and did put in prison sir John^ de Uien sir John^ of
Surrey / sir John^ of Belborne and other: than they made all the soudyers to
bring all their harness into a place appointed / and laid it all on a hepe in
the hall of Calys / thanne they made all manner of people to void and kept
there no mo persons but a priest / and two other ancient personages / such as
knew the customs laws / and ordynaunces of the town / and to sign out the
herytages how they were divided than they prepared the castle to lodge the
king and queen / and prepared other houses for ye kings company. Than the king
mounted on his horse and entered into the town with trumpets tabours /
nakquayres / and hormyes / and there the king lay till the queen was brought a
bed of a fair lady named Margarete. The king gave to sir Gaultier of Ma^ny
diverse fair houses within the town / and to therle Stafforde / to the lord
of Bethene / to sit Bartylmewe of Bomes / and to other lords to repeople again
the town / the kings mind was when he ca^e into England to send out of
London a.xxxvi. good burgesses to Calys to dwell there / and to do somoche that
the town might be peopled with pure englysshmen / the which intent the king
fulfilled. Than ye new town and bastyd that was made without the town was
pulled down / and the castle that stood on the hauyn rasshed down / and the
great tymbre and stones brought into the town / than the king ordained men to
keep ye gates / walls / and barryers / and amended all things within the
town / and sir John^ de Uien and his company were sent into England / and
were half a year at London than they were put to ransom: me think it was
great pity of the burgesses and other men of the town of Calys / and women /
and children / whasie they were feign to forsake their houses / herytages / and
goods / and to bear away nothing: and they had no restorement of the french
king for whose sake they lost all: the most part of them went to saint Omers.
The cardynall Guy de Boloyne / who was come into France in legacyon and was
with the french king his cosyn in the city of Amyense / he purchased somoche
that a truse was taken between ye kings of England and of France / their
contres and herytages to endure two years. To this truse all perties were
agreed / but Bretayne was clearly except / for the two ladies made still war
one against the other. Than the king of England and the queen returned into
England / and the king made captain of Calys sir Amery of Pauy a lumbarde
borne / whom the king had greatly auaunced / than the king send fro
London.xxxvi. burgesses to Calays / who were rich and sage / and their wives
and children. and daily increased the nombre / for the king granted there
such lyberties and franchysses that men were glad to go and dwell there /
the same time was brought to London sir Charles de Bloyes who called himself
duke of Breten / he was put in Cortoyse prison in the tower of London with
the king of Scotts and the earl Morette / but he had not ben there long but
at the request of the queen of England / sir Charles her cosyn germayne was
receyuedde on his faith and troth / and rode all about London at his pleasure
/ but he might natly past one night out of London without it were with the
king or with the queen. Also the same time there was prisoner in England
therle of Ewe and Guynes / a right gentle knight: and his dealing was such
that he was welcome where soever he came / and with the king and queen / lords
ladies / and damsels.

Of the dealing of a br^gant of Languedocke / called Bacon. Cap. C.xlviii.
ALl this year these two kings held well the trewse taken between them: but
sir Wyllm^ Duglas and the scotts being in the forest of Gedeours / made war
daily on the englysshmen. Also such as were in Gascoyne / Poyctou / and
Xayntone: as well french as english kept nothing the trewse taken between the
two kings / but conquered often times towns and castles one upon the other
byforce / by purchase / or by stelth night and day: and often times there fell
between the^ many fair aue^tures / sometime to the frenchmen / and sometime to
thenglysshmen / and always the poor brigantes wanne in robyng of towns and
castles. And some thereby came rich: so that they were made capitayns of other
brigantes / there were some well worth.xl. thousand crowns / often times
they would spy where was a good town a days journey or two fro them / than they
would assemble.xx. or.xxx. of them together: and go by covert ways day and
night / and so enter into the town unknown in ye morning / and set fire on
some house. Than they of the town would think that it was done by some men of
war / and so fly away out of the town: and thanne these brigantes would
break up cofers and houses / and rob and take what they list: and slye away
when they had done. Among other there was a brigant in Languedocke: he spyed
the strong castle of Couborne in Lymosyn / he rode in the night with.xxx.
co^panyons and took the castle by stell he / and the lord of the same castle
prisoner: who was called Coubourne / and put him in prison in his own
castle. And there kept him so long: that at last they raunsomed him
at.xxiiii. thousand crowns / and they kept still ye castle and made sore
war in the country. And after by fair promyses the french king bought him
and his castle: and gave him. x^. thousand crowns / and made him vssher of
arms about him: and this Brigant Bacon was ever well horsed / ap(...)led / and
armed like an earl. And so he continued as long as he lived.

Of another page called Croquart. Cap. C.xlix.
IN like case there were brigantes in Bretayne / who made war and wanne
towns and castelles / and lived by robery and held of no man: for that they
wanne they kept to themself / and sold to them of the country towns and
castles derely. And among other there was one as a master called Croquart /
who was before but a poor page attendyng on the lord Dercle in Holland. When
this Croquart began to wax a man: his lord gave him leave to depart and go to
the wars into Bretayne / and there he fill in service with a man of arms and
bare himself well / and at askirmysshe his master was taken and slain /
thanne because of his prowes his fellows did choose him captain instead of
their master. And than he did get somoche by wynnyng of towns and castelles
/ that he was esteemed to be worth.xl. thousand crowns beside his horse:
whereof he had a.xx. or.xxx. good coursers / and double horse: and he had the
brute to be one of the most expert men of arms in all that country. And he
was chosen in a battle to be one of the.xxx. of the english party: and he
wan there the price of all other / the french king made him offers and promise
that if he would beco^e french to make him a knight / and to mary him rychely
/ and to give him two thousand pound of revenues yearly: but he would in
nowyse co^se^t thereto. And it fortuned him on a day to ride a young horse / the
which he had bought for three hundred crowns: and he spu^red him so sore that
the horse ran away with him / and in romnyng fell in a dyke and brake his
masters neck / thus ended Croquart.

How sir Amery of Pauy lumbar^ sold the town of Calys / whereof he was
captain / to the lord Geffray Charney of France. Cap. C.l.
ALl this season in the town of saint Omers / was the lord Geffray of
Charney: and kept the fronters there / using every thing touching the war /
as king. Than he be thought him how that lumbardes naturally be couetonse:
wherefore he thought to assay to get the town of Calys / where of Amery of
Pauy lumbarde was captain / and by reasone of the trewse they of saint Omers
might go to Calys / and they of Calys to saint Omers: so that daily that
resorted toguyder to do their marcha^dyses. Than sir Geffray secretly fill in
treaty with sir Amery of Pauy: so that he promised to deliver into the
fre^chmens hands the town and castle of Calys for.xx. thousand crowns.
This was not done so secretly but that the king of England had knowledge
thereof: than the king send for Amery de Pauy to come into England to
Westmynster to speak with him / and so he came over: for he thought that the
king had not had knowledge of that matter / he thought he had done it so
secretly. When the king saw him he took him apart (and said) thou know well
I have given the in keeping the thing in this world yt I love best next my
wife and children / that is to say the town and castle of Calys / and thou
have sold it to the frenchmen / wherefore thou haste well deserved to dye. Than
the lumbard kneled down (and said) a noble king I cry you mercy / it is true
that ye say / but sir the bargayne may well be broken for as yet I have
received never a penny: the kyrge had loved well the lumbard (and said) Amery /
I woll that thou go forward on thy bargayne and the day that thou apoyntest to
deliver the town let me have knowledge thereof before / and on this condycion I
forgive the thy trespass / so thereupon the lumbard returned again to Calays
and kept this matter secret. Than sir Geffray of Charney thought well to have
Calays: and assembled a certain nombre secretly / a.v. hundred spears: there
were but a few y^ knew what he purposed. I think he never made the french
king of knowledge thereof: for if he had I trow the king would not a consented
thereto / because of the truse. This lumbard had appointed to deliver ye castle
the first night of ye new year: the lumbarde send word thereof by a brother
of his to the king of England.

Of the battle at Calays between the king of England / under the baner of sir
Gaultyer of Manny / and sir Geffray of Charney and the frenchemen. Cap. C.li.
When the king of England knew the certain day appointed he departed out of
England with three. C. men of arms / and.vi. C. archers: and took shyppyng at
Dover / and in the evening arrived at Calays / so secretly that no man knew
thereof / and went and laid his men in busshmentes in the chambers and towers
within the castle. Than^e the king said to sir Gaultyer of Manny: I woll that
ye be chief of this enterprice / for I and my son the prince woll fight
under your baner. The lord Geffray of Charney: the last day of Decembre at
night departed fro Arras and all his company / and came nere to Calis about the
hour of mydnight / and than tarried there abiding for his company / and send
two squyers to the posterne gate of the castle of Calys. And there they found
sir Amery ready: than they demanded of him if it were time that the lord
Geffray should come: and the lumbarde said yes. Than they returned to their
master and showed him as the lumbard said / than he made his men pass
Newlande bridge in good order of battle: than he send.xii. knights with a
hundred men of arms / to go and take possession of the castle of Calays / for
he thought well if he might have the castle / he should soon get the town:
seeing he had so good a no^bre of men with him / and daily might have mo whan^e
he list. And he delivered to the lord Edward of Ren^y.xx. thousand crowns
to pay the lumbarde / and sir Geffray houed still in the feldes privily with
his baner before him. His intent was to enter into the town by ye gate orels
not / the lumbarde had let down the bridge of the posterne and suffered the
hundred men of arms to enter peasably: and sir Edward delivered at the
postern.xx. thousand crowns in a bag to the lumbarde / who said I trust
here be all: for I have no leaser now to tell them / for it will be anon day.
Than he cast ye bag with crowns into a coter: and said to the frenchemen /
come on sirs ye shall enter into the dongyon / than shall you be sure to be
lords of the castle / they went thither and he drew apart the bar: and the
gate opyned. Within this tower was ye king of England with two hundred spears:
who issued out with their swerdes and ares in their hands / cryeng Manny Ma^ny
to the rescue / what weneth the frenchmen with so few men to win the castle
of Calays: than the frenchmen saw well that defense could not avail them /
than they yielded themself prisoners / so that there were but a few hurt: than
they were put into y^ same tower in prison. And thengly sshmen issued out of
the castle into the town and mounted on their horses / for they had all the
french prisoners horses / than tharchers rode to Bolayne gate where sir Geffray
was with his banner before him / of goules / three skuchens of silver / he had
great desire to be the first should enter into the town / he said to the
knights that were about him / with out this lumbarde opyn the gate shortly we are like to dye here for cold. In the name of god ser said Pepy de Werre:
lumbardes ar malycious people and subtle / he is now lokynge on your crowns
to se if they be all good or not / and to reken if he have his hole sum or
no. There / with the king of England and the prince his son was ready at the
gate under the bauer of ser Gaultier of Manny: with diverse other baners as the
earl Stafforde / the earl of Suffolk / the lord John^ Montagu brother to
therle of Salysbury / the lord Beachame / the lord Be^^le / and the lord
Dalawarre: all these were lords and had baners / there were no mo in that
journey. Than the great gate was set open and they all issued out: whan^e the
frenchmen saw them issue and herd them cry Manny to the rescue / they knew
well they were betrayed / than ser Geffray said to his company (sirs if we
slye) we are clean lost / yet were we better to fight with a good heart in trust
the journey shall be ours. The englysshmen herd these words (and said) by
saint George ye say trewely: shame have he that slyeth / the frenchmen a
lighted a foot and put their horses fro them / and ordered themself in battle.
When the king saw that he stood still (and said) let us order our self to
fight: for our enemies woll abide us / the king send part of his company to
Newland bridge / for he herd say there were a great nombre of frenchmen. Than
thither went a six baners / and three hundred archers: and there they found the
lord Monau of Frenes / and the lord of Creques keeping ye bridge and between
the bridge and Calays there were many crosbowes of saint Omers and Air: so
there was a sore fray / and slain and drowned mo than six hundred frenchmen /
for they were soon discomfytted and chased into the water. This was erly in
the morning but in co^tynent it was day: the frenchmen kept their ground a
while and many feats of arms there done on both parts / but the englysshmen
ever increased by coming out of Calays / and the frenchmen abated. Than the
frenchmen saw well they could not long keep the bridge: than such as had
their horses by them mounted and showed their horses heles / and thenglysshmen
after the^ in chase: there was many a man overthrown / they that were well
horsed saved themself / as ye lord Frenes / ye lord Creques / the lord of
Se^py / the lord of Louchinleych / and the lord of Namure / many were taken
by their own outrage that might have bensaued if they had list / Whan^e it was
fair day that every man might know other: than some of the french knights
and squyers assembled together again / and turned and fought feersly with the
englysshmen / so that there were some of the frenchmen that took good prisoners
/ whereby they had both honor and profet. Now let us speak of the king / who
was there unknown of his enemies / under the banner of sir Gaultyer of Manny /
and was a foot among his men to seek his enemies / who stood close together with
their spears a.v. fore long. At the first meatyng there was a sore rencountre:
and the king light on the lord Eustace of Rybemount / who was a strong and a
hardy knight: there was a long fight between him and the king that it was joy
to behold the^ at last they were put a sondre / for a great company of both
parties came the same way and fought there feersly together. The frenchmen did
there right valyantly / but specially the lord Eustace of Ribamont who struck
the king the same day two times on his knees / but finally the king himself
took him prisoner / and so he yielded his sword to ye king (and said) sir
knight I yield me as your prisoner: he knew not as than that it was the king.
And so the journey was for the king of England: and all that were there with ser
Geffray slain or taken / there was slain ser Henry of Boys / and sir Pepyn de
la war / and sir Geffray taken. Thus this journey was achyued by Calis / ye
year of our lord. M. CCC.lviii. ye last day of Dece^bre toward the next
morning.

Of a chapelet of perles that the king of England gave to sir Eustace of
Rybemont. Cap. C.lii.
When this battle was done the king returned again to the castle of Calays
and caused all the prisoners to be brought thither. Than ye frenchmen knew well
yt the king had been there personally hy(...) under the baner of sir Gaultier
of Ma^ny: the king said he would give them all that ^^ght a supper in the
castle of Calys / the hour of supper ca^e and tables couerd. And the king and
his knights were there ready every man in new a^arell / and the frenchmen also
were there and made good chere though they were prisoners. The king satte down
and the lords and knygh^^s about him right honorably / y^ prince lords and
knights / of England served the king at the first mess: and at the second
they satte down at an other table they were all well served and at great
leaser. Than^e when supper was done and the tables take away: the king tarried
still in the hall with his knights and with the frenchmen and he was bare
heeded saving a chapelet of fine perles y^ he ware on his ^eed. Than the king
went fro one to another of the frenchmen: and when he came to sir Geffray of
Charney / a little he changed his countenance and looked on him (and said) sir
Geffray by reason I should love you butte a little / wha^ ye would steal by
night fro me that thing which I have so der^ly bought and has cost me somoch
good I am right ^oyouse and glad that I have taken you with the proffe. ye
would have a better markette than I have had: when ye thought to have Calys
for.xx. thousand crowns but god has helped me / and ye have failed of your
purpose: and therewith the king went fro him and he gave never a word to
answer. Than y^ king ca^e to sir Eustace of Rybamont and ioyously to him he
said: sir Eustace ye are the knight in the world that I have seen most
valyant assail his enemies and defend himself / nor I never found knight y^
ever gave me somoche a do body to body as ye have done this day wherefore I give
you the price above all the knights of my court by right sentence: than the
king took the chapelet yt was upon his heed / being both fair goodly / and
tyche (and said) sir Eustace I give you this chapelet for the best doar in
at^es in this journey past of either party: and I desire you to bear it this
year for the love of me. I know well ye be fresshe and amorouse: and often
times be among ladies and damoselles / say where soever ye come that I did give
it you and I quyte you your prison and ransom / and ye shall depart tomorowe
if it please you. The same year a thousand three hundred.xlix. king Philyppe

pope he was n^ med Innocent / his own proper name was Stephyn ^ubert / y^ year
of our lord. M.iii. C.liii. the.viii. day of January / anon after y^ brekynge
of the day in the morning / the king Charles of Nauer earl of Eureur caused to
be slain in the town of the Egle in Normandy in an hostre / the lord Charles
of Spain constable of France in his bed / by certain men of arms that he
sent to do that deed and himself abode with out the town till they had done
and returned again to him. And as it was said with him was the lord
Philypp^ of Nauer his brother / and the lord Lovs of Harcourt / the lord
Godfray of Hat court his uncle and diverse other knights and squyers as well of
Normandy as of Nauer. Than the king of Nauer and his company went to the cite
of Deureur whereof he was earl and fortifyed the town / and with him also there
was the lord of Maule / John^ Maler lord of Grauyll / the lord of ^^morie /
of Mulent / and diverse other nobles of Normandy. And than^e the king of Nauer
went to the town of Mant and he had sent diverse letters into diverse good
towns of France: how that he had put to death the constable for diverse great
trespaces by him committed / and he sent the earl of Namure to the french king
to Paris to excuse him. Than the king send to Mant the cardynall of Bolayne
the bishop of Laon / the duke of Burbon / the earl of Uaudone and other / to
treat with the king of Nauerr / for though he had caused to dye the constable
of France / yet he thought he should not clean lose the favor of the french
king / whose daughter he had married: therefore he made request of pardon to the
king. It was thought in the realm of France that great war should ense we
between these two kings / for the king of Nauer had made great assembles of
men of war in diverse regions / and fortifyed his towns and castles: finally
there was agreement made between these two kings upon certain co^dycions
whereof part solo weth herafter. That is to say: the french king shall deliver
to the king of Nauer.xxxviii. M. ^i. tornois of land / as well for certain rent
that the king of Nauer had out yearly of the tresur in Pares as upon other
lands that the french king ought to assign him by certain treat^ granted
long before between their predecesso's / because of the county of Cha^payne.
And also for the marriage of the king of Nauer: for maryeng of the kyng^
daughter / at which marriage he was promised great lands / that is to say.xii.
M. ^i. of land: also the king of Nauer would have the cou^tie of Beamo^t le
Roger / the land of Bretuell in Normandy / Conches and Dorbec / the vycou^t of
Po^theu by the sea / and the bayllage of Co^stantyne: the which things were
agreed unto by the french king. Howbeit the cou^tie of Beamont / and the lands
of Conches Bertuell / and Dorbec: parteyned to the lord Philyp duke of
Orlea^ce brother to the french king / who gave him other lands in recompense
thereof. Also it was agreed that the lords of Harcourt and all his other alyes
should hold of him for all their lands whersoeuer they were in France if they
list orels not: also it was agreed y^ he should hold still all the said lands
beside the^ that he held before in parie / and if he list to keep his es
cheker two times in the year / as nobly as ever did any duke of Normandy: also
the french king to perdon the death of the constable / and all such as were
co^sentyng thereto: and to promise by his oath never to do any hurt or damage to
any person for that occasion. And also the king of Nauerr to have a great som^e
of money of y^ french king and ar the king of Nauer would come to Paris: he
would have in hostage the earl of Aniowe / second son to the king. Than he
came to Pares with a great no^bre of men of arms: and the. iiii day of march /
he came into the perlyament chamber where the king satte and diverse of the peers
of the realm with him and his counsel: there was the cardynall of Bolayne /
there the king of Nauer desired the french king to perdon him the death of the
constable of France / saying how he had good cause so to do / the which he
offered there to prove or else to be at the kings pleasure. And also he said and
swear that he did it not for no grudge to the king / nor in dispyte of his
office: saying also how there was nothing so grievous to him as to be in the
dyspleasur with the king. Than the lord Jaques of Burbone as than constable by
the kings commandment / set his hands on the king of Nauer / and caused
him to go a back out of the kyng^ pres^ns: tha^ queen Jane and queen Blanch /
suster to the king of Nauer / the which Jane had been wife to king Philyppe
last deed: came to the french king and kneled down / and the lord Reynold
Detrey with them (and he said) my right redouted soueraygne lord: behold here
these two ladies and queen's Jane and Blanch. Sir they understand how the
king of Nauer is in your dyspleasur / whereof they be sorry: and require you to
forgive him your yuell will / and by the grace of god he shall so bear himself
frohens forward / that you and all the people of France shall be pleased with
him / than the constable and the marshalles went again for the king of Nauer /
and so brought him into the kings presence / and there he stood between the two
queen's. Than ye cardynall said sir king of Nauer: the king my master is not
well content with you for the deed that ye have done / it need not to be
rehearsed / for ye have publysshed it yourselfe by your own writing / so that
every man does know it ye ar so bound to the king that ye ought not thus to
have done. ye be of his blood so nere as every man knows that ye ought to
hold of him / and also ye have wedded his daughter / where fore your trespass
is the greatter: How beit at the instaunce and love of these ladies the queen's
/ who has effectuously required for you: and also the king thinks that ye
did it without great aduysement / and by small counsel / therefore ye king
pardons you with good heart and will. Than the two queen's and the king of
Nauer kneled down and thanked the king / than the cardynall said again: let
every man fro hensforthe beware though he be of the kings lynage to do any
such like deed / for surely though he be the kings son / if he do any such
to the leest offycer parteyning to the king / he shall abide the justice of the
realm in that case: than the court brake up / and so every man departed.
The.xxi. day of March / a knight baneret of the low marchesse called sir
Reynolde of Presigny lord of Maraunt beside Rochell / was drawn and hanged on
the gybette / by judgment of the parlyament / and by the kings counsel /
the year of our lord god. M. CCC.liiii. in the month of August. The earl of
Harcourt and sir Loyes his brother / counsayled with the french king* and as
it was said / they showed the king all the matter of the death of the constable
/ and in Septe^bre the cardynall of Bolayne went to Auygnon / some said the
king was dyspleased with him. How be it the space of a year that he had been in
France he was as preuy with the king as any other. The same season there went
out of the realm of France / the lord Robert de Lorris cha^berlayne with the
king / and if the king had takyn him in his ire / some thought it should have
cost him his life: because it was noysed that he had showed to the king of
Nauerre certain secrets of the french king: in like wise as the lords of
Harecourt had showed the king of Nauers secrets to the french king. In the
month of Nouembre the king of Nauer went out of Normandy without knowledge of
the french king / and sported him in diverse places till he came to Auygnon *
and in the same month the archebysshop of Rowan chanceler of France / the
duke of Burbone / and diverse other english lords went to Auygnon to the
pope to treat for a peace between the kings of England and of France. And also
ye same month the french king went into Normandy to Cane / and took in his
hands all the lands of the king of Nauers / and set in his officers in every
town and castle / except six: that is to say Eareur / Pontheu / Chirburge /
Gaurey / Auranges / and Mortaygne / these would not yield up / for there were
naueroys within them (that answered and said) they would not deliver up their
towns and castles: but all only to the king of Nauer their lord: who had
set them there. In the month of January by save conduct ca^e the lord
Robert de Lorris to the french king: and was a.xv. days at Paris or he could
speak with the king / and when he had spoken with him yet he was not reconsyled
at the full / but returned again into Auygnon by the ordynance of the kings
counsel / to be as one of them that were there for the treaty between England
and France. In the end of February tidings ca^e how trewse was taken between
the said two kings to endure to the feast* of saint John^ Baptyst: and in the
mean time the pope to do what he might to make a further peace. And therefore he
send messangers to both kings / that they should send further authorite by
their ambassadors / to conclude on an other manner of peace. The same month
the french king made new money of fine gold: called florence of ye lamb /
for in the pyell there was grauyn a lamb.lii. of them went to a mark weight
/ and after they were made the king made.xlviii. to goo for a mark weight and
the course of all other flore^s was prohibyted. The same month sir Gra^chet be
Lore came to Paris to speak with the king as messanger fro the king of Nauer:
and he returned again in February / and bare with him a letter of save
conduct to the king of Nauer / the same year about lent came diverse englysshmen
nere to ye town of Nauntes in Bretayne / and entered into the castle by
scalyng a.lii. but sir Guy of Rochfort who was captayn and was as than in the
town / he did somoche with assaut that the same night he wanne the castle
again / and all thenglysshmen taken and slain. At Easter the year of our
lord. M. CCC.lv. king Johan of France sent into Normandy his eldest son
Charles dolphyn of Uienoys to be his lieutena^t there and there he tarried all
that somer / and the men of the contre granted him.iii. M. me^ of arms tor
three mouethes. Also in the month of august the king of Nauer / came out of
Nauer to the castle of Chierburge in Constantyne / and with him a.x. M. men of
war one and other. There were diverse treates co^muned of / between the king of
Nauer and the french king / but such as were in the castle of Eurur and
Pontheau / robbed and pylled the country all about. And some of them came to
the castle of Couches / the which was as than in the french hands / and wan
it and new fortifyed it / many things did the nauereys against the frenchmen
/ finally the.ii. kings were agreed. Than the king of Nauer went to the
castle of Uernell to the dolphyne / and he brought the king of Nauer to Paris
/ and y^ xxiiii. day of Septe^bre the king of Nauer and the dolphyn came to the
french king to the castle of Lour. Than the king of Nauerr made his reverence
and excused himself honorably / in that he departed out of the realm of
France / and also he said it was showed him how y^ king should not be well
content with him. Than y^ french king desired him to show what they were
that had made that report / than he answered that sith the death of the
constable / he had don nothing against the french king / but as a true man
ought to have done. How beit he desired the french king to pardon every thing
/ promising to be true as he ought to be to his father and chief lord /
than^e the duke of Athenes said in kings behalf the king does pardon him
all things with a good heart.

Of an inposycion and gabell ordained in France by the three estates for the
feats of the wars. Cap. C.lv.
ALso in the year of our lord. M. CCC.lv. in y^ month of Octobre: the prince
of Wales eldest son to the king of England went into Gascoyne and went nere to
Tholouz and so paste the river of Garon and went into Cracassone and brent the
borowe but the city was well defended. And fro thens he went to Narbon
bre^nyng and exilynge the country / and in the month of Nouembre he returned
to Burdeur with great pyllage and many prisoners / for no man resysted him. And
yet in the country was therle of Armynake lieutenant to the french king in
Langnedocke / and also the lord of Foitz / the lord Janques of Burbon / the
lord of Pontheu / the constable of France / and the lord John^ of Cleremont

within and about the perke / but he entered not into the town nor castle. And
the french king who had made his assemble at the city of Amyens / heryng of
the king of England rode toward him / but the king of England was returnyng
to Calys / and the french king followed him till he came to saint Omers And than
he send his marshall Dauthayne and diverse other to the king of England /
offering to fight body to body or power to pouer / what day soever he would
apoynt: but y^ king of England refused that battle / and so returned again
into England / and the french king to Paris. The same year about the feast of
saint Andrue: there was assembled at Pares by the kings co^mau^ment / the
prelates of France / the barownes and the counsayls of the good towns. And
there the chanceler of France in the perlyament chamber resyted the state of the
wars of France / desyring them thereupon to take aduyce what aid might be
given to the king to mentayne and defend the said wars: and also he said it
is come to the kings knowledge / how that his subgettes ar sore grieved by
reason of the mutacyon of y^ moneys. Therefore the king offers to make good
money and durable: so y^ they would grant him sufficient aid to me^tayne his
wars / they answered that is to say: the clergy by the mouth of the
archbysshop of Reyns / the nobles by y^ duke of Athenes / and the good towns
by the mouth of Stephyn Martell provost of the marchantes of Paris. All they
said they were ready to live and dye with the king: and put their bodies and
goods into his service / requyring to have deliberacyon to speak together / the
which was granted the^. The same year the vigyll of the co^cepcion of our
lady: the king gave the duchy of Normandy to Charles dolphyn of Uienoys his
eldest son / and the next day he made his homage. After the delyberacyon taken
by the three estates they answered to the king in the perlyament chamber by the
mouths of the said three persons how they would find him for one yer. xxx.
M. men at their costs and charge / the fina^ce to pay the wages of so many men
of war was esteemed to.l. M. (...). parisien^ / and the three estates ordenid

serve or no (the first day of March) at the which day thither again they came
all: except certain of y^ great towns of Picardy and Normandy / and some
nobles of the same such as were at the inposicion making came thither / and they
found that the first grant would not suffyce to reys^ the said some.

How the french king took the king of Nauer / and beheeded the earl of
Harcourt and other at Roan. Ca. C.lvi.
ALso the iuesday the.v. day of April / about the mids of lent / the french
king deperted before day fro Meneuell in harnes acco^panyed with a. CC. spears:
among the which was therle of Aniowe his son / and the duke of Orleance his
brother the lord John de Arthoyserle of Ewe / y^ lord Charles his brother /
cosyn germayn to y^ king the earl of Tankernyll / sir Arnolde Da^drehen than
marshall of France: and diverse other to the nombre abouesayd. The king and
they ca^e straight to the castle of Rowan by the posterne and came not in the
town. And there he found in the hall at dinner with his son the dolphyne
Charles the king of Nauerr / and John^ earl of Harcourt / and the lords of
Preaux / Grauyll / Clear / and diverse other. There the french king caused the
king of Nauer to be taken / therle of Harcourt the lords of Preaux / of Clear
/ sir Loys and sir Wylliam of Harcourt / brethren to y^ earl: the lord
Frequent of Fryquant / the lord of Tournbeu / the lord Maubeu of Mamesners
and two squyers Olyuer Doubles / and Johan Uaubatou / and diverse other. The
king put them in prison in diverse chambers within the same castle: because
that sith the new reco^sy^^acion made for the death of the lord Charles late
constable of France / the king of Nauerre had ymagined and treated diverse
things / to the damage and dishonor of the french king and of his realm.
And therle of Harcourt had spoken iniuryous words against the king in the
castle of Ruell / where the assemble was to conclude for the aid to be given
to the king: in lettyng to his power the same aid to be granted. Than the
french king dyned there: and after took his horse and rod out into a telde
behind the castle called the field of pardon / and thither in two carts was
brought therle of Harcourt / the lord Grauylle / the lord Maubeu / and Olyuer
Doubles: and there all their heedes were stryken of / and after all four
drawn to ye gybette of Rowan and there hanged / and their heedes set on the
gybette. The same day and the next day the french king delivered all the
other out of prison: except three / yt is to say Charles king of Nauer / who was
carried to Paris and put in prison in the castle of Loure / and after into the
chatelette. And certain of the french kings counsel were appointed to keep
him also Fryquet and Uaubatou were put into the same prison / and therefore the
lord Philypp^ of Nauer held in his hands diverse castles pertaining to his
brother the king of Nauerre in Normandy. And for all that the french king
send to him to deliver the same castles / yet the refused so to do: and he and
the lord Godfray of Harcourt assembled together diverse enemies of the french
kings / and brought them into ye country of Constantyne / the which country
they held and kept fro the french king. The wednysday after Ester: theyere of
our lord god a. M. CCC.lvi. sir Arnold Da^drehen than marshall of France went
to the town of Arras / and there wisely without any business of men of war he
took mo than a hundred prisoners of them of the town such as had made the
rebellyon there and slain diverse of the chief burgesses of the town. And the
next day he made.xx. of them to be beheeded: and ye other he kept still in
prison to know the kings pleasure in that behalf / and so by that means the
town was brought into true obeisance to the king. In the month of June the
duke of Lancastre came into Co^stantyne and fill in company with the lord
Philyp of Nauerr / and the lord Godfray of Harcourt they were in all about a
four thousand fyghtyng me^: they rode to Lyseur / to Orbec / to Po^theau and
refresshed the castle there / the which had been besieged more than two
months: but the lord Robert of Hotetot master of the crosbowes in France /
who had layne there at sieg with diverse nobles and other / departed fro the
siege when the knew of the coming of the duke of Lancastre / and left
behind them for have their engyns and artillary: and they of the castle took
all. Than the duke of Lancaster and his company rode for the robbyng and
pyllyng the towns and country: as they passed toward Bretuell the which they
newely refresshed / and because that they knew and found ye cite and castle
of Eureux to be newely yielded to ye french king / who had long kept a siege
there at. And also they saw how the city was bre^t and the cathedral
church robbed: as well by the naueroyse / who yielded up the castle by
composycyon / as by the frenchemen that lay there at the siege. They left it:
and than the duke of Lancastre and the lord Philyppe of Nauerr went to
Uernueyll in Perch / and took the town and castle / and robbed the town and
brent a great part thereof. The french king who had made ready his assemble
as soon as he herd tidings of the duke of Lancastre / he went after him with
a great nombre of men of arms and fotemenne / and followed them to Conde in
going straight to the town of Uernueyll: thanne the duke and his company went
toward the town of the Egle / and the king followed them till he came to
Tuebufe / a two leages fro the town of the Egle. And tha^ there it was showed
to the king how he could follow no farther / for there were such forestes
that his enemies might take him when they list / so that the should do but
lose his labor to go any farther after them / than the king returned with all
his host / and went to the castle of Thilyers / the which was in the hands
of nauaroes. The king took it and set men of war therein: than the king went
to the castle of Bretuell / wherein were men of the king of Nauers. There ye
king lay at siege the space of two months: and than ye castle was given up /
and they within went where they list with their goods and lives saved.

Of the assemble that the french king made to fight with the prince of wales /
who rode in Berry. Cap. C.lvii.
When the french king had made his journey: and reconquered towns (...)
castelles in base Normandy / pertaynyug as than to the king of Nauerre whom he
held in prisonne / and was gone back to the city of Paris. It was not long
after but that he herd how the prince of Wales with a good nombre of men of
war / was far entered into the country aprochyng the good ^otrey of Berry.
Than the king said and swear that he would ride and fight with him wheresoever
he found him: than the king made again a special assemble of all nobles and
such as held of him his commandment was that all manner of excuses laid a
part his letters ones seen that every man on pain of his dyspleasur should
draw and mete with him in y^ marches of Bloyes and Torayne / for the intent to
sight with thenglysshmen. And the king to make the more have: deperted fro
Paris and rode to Chartres to here the better of surety what thenglyssh men
did. There he re^ted and daily men of war resorted thither fro all parts: as
of Aunergne / Berrey / Burgoyne / Lorayne Heynault / Uermandoyse Picardy /
Bretayne / and Normandy: and ever as they came they were set forward and made
their musters. And lodged in the country by the ass^gnement of the marshalles
/ the lord Johan of Cleremont and the lord Arnolde Da^drehen: the king send
also great prouisyon to all his fortresses and garyson^^ in Antowe / Poyctou /
Dumayne / and Torayne: and in to all the fortresses where he thought thenglyssh
men should pass / to the intent to close the passages from them / and to keep
the^ fro vitayl^^ that they should find no foragefor the^ nor their horses.
How beit for all that the prince and his company / who were to the nombre of
two. M. men of arms and sir. M. archers rode at their ease and had bitayls
enough / for they found the co^tre of Auuerne right plentyfull / but they
would not tarry there but went for the to make war (...) their enemies: they
brent and exyled the country asmoch as they might. For when they were entered
into a town and found it well replenysshed of all things: they tarried there a
two or three days to refresshe them / when they depted they would distroy all
the resydue strike out the heedes of the vessels of wine / and bren where /
barley and otes / and all other things: to thyntent (...) their enemies should
have no aid thereof. (...) than they rode forth and ever found good co^tres
and ple^tyfull: for in Berry / Torayne A^^owe / Poyctou / and Main is a very
plentyfull contre for men of war: thenglysshmen rode for the in this manner
till they came to the good city (...) Burges. And there they made a great
skirmyssh at one of the gates: capitayns within were / the lord of Consant /
and the lord Hutyn of (...) who kept the cite: there was many feats of
(...)mes done / thenglysshmen deperted without any more doing / and went to
Issoldon a strong castle the which was feersly assailed and thither ca^^ all
the hole host howbeit they coud not wy^it. The ge^tylmen defended it
valiantly: than they passed farther and took their way to U(...)on / (...)
great town and a good castle but it was yuell closed and the people there not
sufficyent to make defense / therefore it was won perforce. And there they found
wine and other vitayls great plenty and tarried there three days co refresshe all
there host / and thither ca^e tidings to the prince how the french king was at
Charters with a great assemble of men of war and how y^ all the tor^nes and
passages above the river of Loyre were closed and kept / that none could pass
the ryue^ Than the prince was counseled to return and to pass by Torayne and
Poycton / and so (...) way to Bourdeaux. Than the prince took that way and
returned: when they had done with the town that they were in their pleasure /
and (...)ken the castle and slain the mo^st part that were within / than they
rode toward Remoren tyne. The french king had send into y^ country three great
barownes to keep the fronters there^ the lord of Craon / the lord Boucequant
/ and the hermyte of Chamont / who with three. C. speres rode into that country
in costyng the^glysshmen / and had followed the^ a six days togyder^ and could
never find auantage to set on them: for the^glysshmen rode euerso wisely /
that they could not enter on them on any side / to their advantage. On a day
the frenchmen put themself in a busshement nere to Remorentyne / at a
marvelous strayte passage / by the which the englysshmen must needs pass: ye

paseler the lord Richard of Pontchardon / the lord Nowell Lorynch the young
lord Spencer Edward / and the lord Dambretycourte: with two hundred men of
arms to run before Remorentyne. They passed foreby the frenchmens busshment
and was not ware of them: as soon as they were passed / the frenchmen brake out
and came after them feersly / thenglysshmen who were well forward herd the
noise of the horses coming after them / and parceyued how they were their
enemies: they turned and stood still and abode the frenchmen: who came on
the^ with great randon their spears in their restes. And so ca^e ronnyng to
thenglysshmen: who stood still and suffer them to pass / and there was not of
them past a five or sir overthrown at y^ first metyng than thenglysshmen
dasshed forth their horses after the frenchemen. There was a feerse skyrmysshe
and en(...)red long: and many knights and squyers beaten down on both parts
/ and diverse taken and rescued again / so that a long season no man could tell
who had the better / so long they fought that the battle of thenglysshe
marthalles aproched. And when the frenchmen saw them coming a long by a
wood side: they ^ledde he that might best / and took their ways to

There was a hard battle and many a man overthrown: how beit the one half
of the frenchmen entered into the castle / the three lords saved theymselfe and
diverse other knights and squyers that were well horsed. How beit the town
was taken at their first coming: for the frenchmen all entered into the
castle.

How the prince of wales took the castle of Remorentyne. Cap. C.lviii.
THe prince of wales herd how his fore ryders were a fightyng: than he took
that way and came into the town of Remorentyne / wherein was much of his
people (...) dyeng how they might get the castle. Than the prince commanded
the lord sir John^ Chandos to go and speak with them of the castle / than sir
Johan went to the castle gate / and made sign to speak with some person
within. They that kept the watch there demanded what was his name / and who
did send him thither / he showed them: than sir Boucyquant / and the hermyte of
Chamount came to the barryers. When sir Johan saw them: he saluted them
curtelly and said / sirs I am send hyder to you fro my lord ye prince / who
will be right courtesse unto his enemies as me thinks / he says that if ye
will yield vpp^ this fortress to him and yield your self prisoners / he will
receive you to mercy / and keep you good company of arms. The lord Boucyquant
said: we arnat in purpose to put ourselfe in that case / it were great folly
sith we have no need so to do we think to defend our self. So they departed
and the prince lodged there: and his men in the town without at their ease /
the next day every man was armed and under his baner / and began to assail
the castle right feersly / the archers were on the dykes and shot so holly
together / that none durst scant apere at their defenses. Some swame over ye
dykes on bordes / and other things with hokes and pikes in their hands / and
mined at ye walls: and they within cast down great stones and pottes with
lyme / there was slain on ye english party a squire called Remond Derge du
Lache / he was of the company of the Captall of Beoffes. This assaut dured all
the day without rest: at night the englysshmen drew to their logynges and so
past the night / in the morning when the son was risen / the marshals of the
host sowned the tru^pettes. Than all such as were ordained to give the assaut
were ready appayrelled: at the which assaut the prince was personally / and by
reason of his presence greatly encouraged the englysshmen / and not far fro
him there was a squire called Bernarde slain with a stonne / than the prince
swear that he would not depart then still he had the castle and all them
within at his pleasure. Than the assaut enforced on every part: finally they
saw that by assautes they could not win the castle / wherefore they ordained
engines to cast in wild fire into the base court / and so they did yt all the
base court was a fire / so that the fire multiplied in such wise that it took
into the covering of a great tower covered with read. And wha^ they within
saw that they must other yield to ye will of the prince / orels peryshe by
fire. Than all three lords ca^e down and yielded them to the prince: and so the
prince took the^ with him as his prisoners / and the castle was left void.

Of the great host that the french king brought to the battle of Poycters.
Cap. C.lix.
AFter the taking of the castle of Remorentyne / and of them that were therein:
the prince than and his company rode as they did before / distroyeng the
country aprochyng to Antowe / and to Tourayne. The french king who was at
Charterz departed and came to Bloyes / and there tarried two days: and than to
Amboyse / and the ne^t day to Loches: and than he herd how that the prince
was at Towrayne / and how that he was retournyng by Poyctou / ever the
englysshmen were costed by certain expert knights of France / who always made
report to ye king what the englysshmen did. Than the king came to the hay in
Towrayne: and his men had passed the river of Loyre / some at the bridge of
Orleance / and some at Mchun / at Saulmure Bloyes and at Towrs / and where as
they might. They were in nombre a.xx. thousand men of arms beside other /
there were a.xxvi. dukes and earls and mo than sixscore baners / and the four
sons of the king who were but young: the duke Charles of Normandy / the lord
Loyes ye was fro thens forth duke of Aniewe / and the lord Johan duke of
Berry / and the lord Philyppe who / was after duke of Burgoyne. The same
season pope Innocent the sixth send the lord Bertrand cardynall of Pyergourt /
and the lord Nycholas cardynall of the Egle into France / to treat for a peace
between the french king / and all his enemies. First between him and the king
of Nauerr who was in prison: and these cardynalles often times spoke to the
king for his delyuerance during the sege at Bretuell / but they could do
nothing in that behalf. Than the cardynall of Pyergourt went to Tours / and
there he herd how the french king hasted sore to find the englysshmen:
th(...) rod to Poycters for he herd how both (...) hoostes drew
thyderward. The french king herd how the prince hasted greatly to return /
and the king feared that he should escape him / and so deperted fro Hay in
Tourayn and all his company / and rode to Chauuygny / where he tarried that
thursday in the town / and without along by the river of Creuse: and the next
day the king passed the river at the bridge there weuyng that the englysshemen
had been before him / but they were not. How beit they pursued after and passed
ye bridge that day mo th(...)hrescore thousand horses / and diverse other passed
at Chasteleraunt / and ever as they passed they took they way to Poieters. On
the othersyde the prince wist not truly where the frenchmen were / but they
supposed that they were not far of / for they could not find no more forage
whereby they had great faut in their host of vitayle: and some of them repented
that they had distroyed somoch as they had done before when they were in Berry
/ Aniowe / and Torayne: and in that they had made no better provision. The same
friday three great lords of France / the lord of Craon / the lord Raoull of
Coucy / and therle of Joigny tarried all day in the town of Chamygny / and part
of their companyes: the saturday they passed the bridge and followed the king /
who was than a three leages before / and took the way among busshes without a
wode side to go to Poicters The same saturdaye the prince and his company
dysloged fro a little vyllage thereby / and sent before him certain currours to
se if they might find any adventure / and to here where the frenchmen were:
they were in nombre a threscore men of arms well horsed and with them was the
lord Eustace Dambreticourt / and the lord John^ of Guystelles: and by
adventure the englysshmen and frenchemen met together / by the forsayde wode
side. The frenchmen knew anon how they were their enemies / than in have
they did on their helmyttes / and displayed their baners / and came a great
pase toward the^glysshmen: they were in nombre a two hundred men of arms.
When the englysshmen saw them / and that they were so great a nombre: than
they determined to slye and let the frenchmen chase them / for they knew well
the prince with his host was not far behind / than they turned their
hor^es and took y^ corner of the wood: and the frenchmen after them cryenge
their cries and made great noise. And as they chased they came on ye princes
battle or they were ware thereof themself * the prince tarried there to have
word again (...) them that he send forth the lord Raoll of Coucy with his
baner went so far forward that he was under the princes baner / there was a
(...) battle and the knight fought valiantly. How beit he was there takenne:
and the earl of Wyng^y the vycou^t of Bruce / the lord of Cha(...) * and all
the other taken^e or slain / but a few that escaped. And by y^ prisoners the
prince knew how the french king followed him in such wise that he could not
eschew the battle: than he assembled together all his men and commanded that
no man should go before the marshals baners. Thus the prince rode that saturday
fro the morning till it was against night: so that he came within two little
leages of Poicters than the Captall de Buz / sir Aymenon of Punyers / the lord
Bartylmewe of Brunes / and the lord Eustace Dambretycourt: all these the
prince send forth to seyf they might know what the frenchmen did. These
knights deperted with two hundred men of arms well horsed / they rod so
far that they saw the great battle of the kings they saw all the feldes
covered with men of arms / these englysshmen coud not forbers / but set on
the tail of the french host and cast down many to the yerth: and took
diverse prisoners / so that the host began to stir and ^idynges thereof came
to the french king as he was entryng into the city of Poycters. Than he
returned again and made all his he ost do the same: so that saturday it was
very late or he was lodged in the field * the^glissh currours returned again
to the prince and showed him all that they saw and knew and said how the
french host was a great nombre of people: well said the prince in the name
of god let us now study how we shall fight with the^ at our advantage /
that night the englysshmen lodged in a strong place among hedges / vynes and
busshes: and their host well watched / and so was the french host.

Of the order of the frenchemen before the battle of Poycters. Cap. C.lx.
ON the sunday in y^ morning the french king / who had great desire to
fight with the englysshmen herd his mass in his pauilyon / and was houseled
and his four sons with him after mass there came to him the duke of
Orleaunce / the duke of Burbon / therle of Pontheu / the lord Jaques of
Burbone / the duke of Athenes constable of France the earl of Tankernyll the
earl of Salebruce / the earl of Da^martyne / the earl of Uantador / and diverse
other great barownes of France / and of other neighbors holding of France:
as the lord Cleremont / the lord Arnolde Dandrehen marshall of France / the
lord of saint Uenont / the lord John^ of Landas / the lord Eustace Ribamont
/ the lord Fyennes / the lord Geffray of Chargny / y^ lord Chatellon / the
lord of Suly / the lord of Neell sir Robert Duras / and diverse other: all
these with the king went to counsel. Than finally hit was ordained that all
manner of men should draw into the field / and every lord to display his baner
and to set forth in the name of god and saint Denice / than trumpets blewe up
through the host / and every man mounted on horseback and went into the field
/ where they saw the kings baner wave with the wind. There might a been seen
great nobles of fair harness and rich armory of baners and peno^s for there
was all the flower of France / there was none durst abide at home without he
would be shamed for ever / than it was ordained by y^ aduyce of the constable
and marshals to be made three batayls: and in each ward.xvi. M. men of arms /
all mustred and past for men of arms. The first battle the duke of Orleaunce
to govern with.xxxvi. baners / and twyse as many penons. The second the duke
of Normandy and his two brethren / the lord Loys and the lord John^. The
third y^ king himself: and while that these batayls were setting in array / y^
king called to him the lord Eustace Rybamont / the lord John^ of Landas / and
the lord Richard of Beawyeu and said to them: sirs ride on before to se the
dealyng of thenglysshmen / and advise well what nombre they be / and by what
means we may fight with them / other a foot or a horseback. These three
knights rode forth and the king was on a wight courser / and said a high to
his men: sirs among you when ye be at Paris / at Chartres / at Roan / or at
Orleaunce: than ye do thret thenglysshmen * and desire to be in arms out
against them. Now ye become thereto / I shall now show you the^: now show
forth your yuell will that ye bear them / and reueng your dyspleasurs and
damages that they have done you / for without dout we shall fight with them.
Such as herd him: said sir a god desname so be it / that would we se gladly.
There with the three knights returned again to the king / who demanded of
them tidings / than sir Eustace of Rybamont answered for all (and said) sir
we have seen the englysshmen by estymacion they be two thousand men of arms /
and four thousand archers / and a fyftene hundred of other / howebeit they be
in a strong place. And as far as we can Imagyne they are in one battle:
howbeit they be wisely ordered and a long the way they have fortifyed strongly
the hedges and busshes: one part of their archers are a long by the hedge / so
that none can go nor ride that way / but must past by them. And that way must
ye go and ye purpose to fight with them / in this hedge there is but one enter
and one issue by likelyhode that four horsemen may ride a front / at the end of
this hedge where as no man can go nor ride / there be men of arms a foot and
archers before them in manner of a hearse / so that they woll not be lightely
disconfyted. Well said the king what woll ye than counsel us to do: sir
Eustace said / sir let us all be a lote except three hundred men of arms
well horsed of y^ best in your host and most hardyest / to the intent they
somewhat to break and to opyn the archers. and thane your batayls to follow on
quickly a foot / and so to fight with their men of arms hand to hand. This
is the best aduyce that I can give you: if any other think any other way
better let him speak. The king said thus shall it be done: than the two
marshalles rode fro battle to battle and chose out a three. C. knights and
squyers of the most expert men of arms of all the host / every man well
armed and horsed. Also it was ordained that the bataylles of alwayns should
abide still on horseback to confort the marshalles if need were: whereof the
earl of Salesbruce / the earl of Neydo and the earl of Nosco were capitayns:
king Johan of France was there armed and.xx. other in his apayrell / and he
did put the gyding of his eldest son to the lord of saint Uenant / the lord
of Landas / and the lord Thybault of Bodenay: and the lord Reynolde of
Quenoll called the archepreest was armed in the armoure of the yongerle of
Alanson.

How the cardynall of Dyergourt treated to make agreement between the french
king and the prince / before the batell of Poycters. Cap. C.lxi.
When the french kings batayls was ordered and every lord under his banner
among their own men: than it was commanded that every man should cut their
speres to a five foot long / and every man to put of their spurs. Thus as
they were ready to aproche: the cardinal of Piergort came in great have to the
king / he came the same morning from Poycters: he kneled down to the king and
held up his hands / and desired him for goddessake a little to absteyne
setting forward till he had spoken with him (than he said) sir ye have here
all the flower of your realm against a handful of englysshmen / as to regard
your company: and sir if ye may have them acorded to you without battle / it
shall be more profitable and honorable to have them by that manner / rather than
to adventure so noble chiualry as ye have here present: sir I require you in
the name of god and humylyte / y^ I may ride to the prince and show him what
danger ye have him in. The king said it pleases me well: but return again
shortly / the cardynall deperted and dilygently he rode to the prince who was
among his men a foot: than the cardynall a lyghted and came to the prince who
received him curtessy. Than the cardynall after his salutacyon made (he said)
certainly fair son if you and your counsel advise justly the puyssaunce of
the french king / ye woll suffer me to treat to make a peace between you and
I may: the prince who was young and lusty said / sir the honor of me and of my
people saved / I would gladly fall to any reasonable way: than the cardynall
said (sir ye say well) and I shall acorde you and I can: for it should be great
pytie if so many noble men and other as be here on both parties should come
together by battle. Than the cardynall rode again to the king (and said) sir
ye need not to make any great haste to fight with your enemies: for they can
not slye fro you though they would they be in such a ground wherefore sir I
require you forbere for this day till to morrow the son rysinge. The king was
loathe to agree thereto forsome of his counsel would not consent to it / but
finally the cardynall the wed such reasons that the king acorded that respyt:
and in the same place there was pyght up a (...)yon of reed sylke fresshe and
rych and gave leave for that day every man to draw to their lodgings / except
the constables and marshalle^ batayls. That sunday all the day the car(...)
(...)yled in ridynge fro the one host to the other gladly to agree them: but
the french king would not agree without he might have four of the princy
^^llest of the englysshmen at his pleasure / and the prince and all the other
to yield themself simply how beit there were many great offers made. The
prince offered to render into the kings hands all that ever he had won in
that voyage towns and castles: and to quyte all prisoners that he or any of
his men had taken in that season. And also to swear not to be armed against the
french king in seuyn year after / but the king and his counsel would none
thereof / the vttermast that he would do was that the prince and a. C. of his
knights should yield them self into the kings prison / otherwise he would
not: the which the prince would (...) wise agree unto. In the mean season that
the cardynall rode thus between the hoostes: in trust to do some good certain
knights of France and of England both / rode forth the same sunday because
it was truse for that day / to cost the hoostes and to behold the dealyng of
their enemies: so it fortuned that the lord John^ Ca^dos rode the same day
coostyng the french host / and in like manner the lord of Cleremont one of the
trenche marshalles had ryden for the and auiewed the state of the english
host / and as these two knights returned toward their hoostes they met
together, each of them bare ou^ manner of deuyee: a blewe lady enbraudred (...)
a (...) beam above on their apayrell. Than the lord Cleremont said: Chandos
how long have ye taken on you to bear my deuyce / nay ye bear my^^ said
Chandos / for it is as well mine as pours: I deny that said Cleremont but and
(...) were not for the truse this day between us / I should make it good on you
incontinent that ye have no right to bear my deuyce. I sir said Ca^dos ye shall
find me to morrow ready to defend you: and to prove by feate of arms that it
is as well mine as yours / than Cleremont said Ca^dos these be well the words
of you englysshmen / forye can deuyce nothing of new / but all that yese is
good and fair. So they departed with out any more doing and each of them
returned to their host: the cardynall of Pyergort could in no wise that sunday
make any agreement between the parties / and when it was nere night he returned
to Poicters. That night the frenchmen took their ease they had provision enough
/ and the englysshmen had great defaut: they could get no forage nor they could
not depart these without danger of their enemies. That sunday thenglysshmen
made great dykes and hedges about their archers to be the more stronger / and
on the monday in the morning the prince and his company were ready apayrelled
as they were before: and about the son rising in like manner were the
frenchmen. The same morning be times the cardynall came again to the french
host / and thought by his preaching to pacify the parties / but than the
frenchmen said to him return whyderye woll / bring hyder no mo words of
treaty nor peace (and ye love yor self depart shortly) When the cardynall
saw that he traueyled in vain: he took leave of the king and than he went to
the prince (and said) sir do what ye can their is no remedy but to a bide the
battle / for I can find none acorde in the french king. Than the prince
said: ye same is our intent and all our people (god help the right) so the
cardynall returned to Poycters. In his company there were certain knights
and squyers men of arms: who were more favorable to the french king than to
the prince / and when they saw that ye parties should fight they stale fro
their masters and went to the french host and they made their captain the
Catelayne of Impastre / who was as tha^ there with the cardynall who knew
nothing thereof till he was come to Poycters. The certentie of the order of the
englysshmen was showed to the french king / except they had ordained
threhu^dred men a horseback and as many archers a horseback: to coost under
covert of the mountain / and to strike into the battle of the duke of
Normandy / who was under the mountain a foot. This ordinance they had made of
new that the frenchmen knew not of: the prince was with his battle down
among the vynes / and had closed in the wekyst part with their caryages. No
we will I name some of the princypall lords and knights that were there with
the prince: the earl of Warwyke / therle of Suffolk / the earl of Salisbury /
therle of Stafford / the lord John^ Chandos the lord Richard Stafford / the
lord Reynold Cobham / the lord Spencer the lord James Audeley / ye lord
Peter his brother / the lord Bercley / the lord Basser / the lord waren / the
lord Dalawar / the lord Maulyne the lord Wylly / the lord Bartylme we be
Brunes / the lord of Felton / the lord Rychard of Pe^bruge / the lord
Stephyne of Constracyon / the lord Brasfeton and other englysshmen. And of
gascon there was ye lord of Prunes / the lord of Buger / the Captall of Buz /
the lord Johan of Chamont / the lord Delaspare / the lord of Rosen / the
lord of Conseu the lord of Montfera^t the lord of Landuras / the lord
Soulech of Lestrade / and other that I can not name. And of Heynowers: the
lord Eustace Da^bretycourt / the lord John^ of Guystels / and two other
strangers / the lord Dauyell Phasell / and the lord Denyce of Moerbertre. All
the princes company past not an.viii. M. men one and other / and ye frenchmen
were a.lx. M. fightyng men / whereof there were mo than three thousand knights.

Of the batell of Poycters between the prince of wales and the french king.
Cap. C.lxii.
WHan^e the prince same that he should have batell and that the cardynall was
gone without any peace or trewse making / and saw that the french king did
set but little store by him: he said than to his men. Now sirs though we be
but a small company / as in regard to the puyssance of our enemies: let us
not be a basshed therefore, for ye vyctorie lies not in the multitude of people
but where as god will send it / if it fortune that the journey be ours / we
shall be the most honored people of all the world: and if we dye in our right
quarrel / I have the king my father and brethren / and also ye have good
friends and kynsmen / these shall revenge us. Therefore sirs for goddessake I
require you do your deuoyers thin day: for if god be pleased and saint George /
this day ye shall se me a good knight. These words and such other that the
prince spoke conforted all his people / the lord sir John^ Chandos that day
never went fro ye prince / nor also the lord James Audeley of a great season /
(...) whan^e he saw that they should needs fight (he said to the prince) ser I
have served always truly my lord your father and you also / and shall do as
long as I live / I say this because I made ones a vow that the first battle
that other the king your father or any of his children should be at: how that
I would be one of the first setters on / or else to dye in the pain. Therefore I
require yor grace as in reward for any service that ever I did to the king
yor father or to you that you woll give me sycence to depart fro you / and to
set my self there as I may acomplysshe my vow. The prince acorded to his
desire (and said) sir James god give you this day that grace to be the best
knight of all other / and so took him by the hand. Than the knight departed
fro the prince and went to the formast front of all the batayles all only
acompanyed with four squyers / who promised not to fail him: this lord James
was a right sage and a valya^t knight / and by him was much of the host
ordained and governed the day before. Thus sir James was in the front of the
battle / ready to fight with the battle of the marshalles of France: In
likewise the lord Eustace Dambreticourt did his pain to be one of the formast
to set on. When sir James Audeley began t(...)tte forward to his enemies:
it fortuned to sir Eustace Dambretycourt as ye shall here after. ye have herd
before how the almayns in the french host were appointed to be still a
horseback: sir Eustace being a horseback laid his spear in the rest and ran
into the french battle / and than a knight of almaygne called the lord Loyes
of Coucoabras / who bare a shield silver / five rosses goules: and sir Eustace
bare ermyns two hamedes of goules. When this almaygne saw the lord Eustace
come fro his company he rode against him: and they met so rudely that both
knights fell to the yerth / the almayne was hurt in the shulder / therefore he
rose not so quickly as did sir Eustace / who wha^ he was up and had taken his
breath / he came to the other knight as he lay on the ground / but than^e five
other knights of almayne came on him all at ones and bare him to the yerth.
And so perforce there he was taken prisoner and brought to the earl of Nosco /
who as than took no head of him / and I can not say whyther they swear him
prisoner or no but they tied him to a chare and there let him stand. Than
the battle began on all parts and ye batayls of the marshals of France
aproched / and they set forth that were appointed to break ye ray of the
archers: they entered a horseback into the way / where the great hedges were on
both sides set full of archers / as soon as the men of arms entered the
archers began to shote on both sides and did slay and hurt horses and
knights. So that the horses when they felt ye sharp arowes they would in no
wise go forward but brewe a back and stang and took on so feersly / that many
of them fell on their masters: so that for p^^ace they could not rise again.
In so much that the marshals battle could never come at the prince: certain
knights and squyers that were well horsed passed through tharchers / and
thought to a ^^he to ye prince but they could not The lord James Judeley with
his four squyers was in the front of that batell and there did maruels marmes /
and by great prowes he ca^e and fought with sir Arnolde Dandrehen under his
own baner / and there they fought long together / and sir Arnolde was there
sore handled. The battle of the marshals began to dysorder by reason of the
shot of the archers / with the aid of the men of arms: who came in among them
and slew of them / and did what they list. And there was the lord Arnold
Da^drchen taken prisoner by other men than by sir James Audeley / or by his
four squters for that day he never took prisoner / but always fought and went
on his enemies. Also on the french party the lord Johan Cleremo^t fought
under his own baner as long as he could endure / but there he was beten ^owne
and could not be relyued nor ransomed / but was slain without mercy: some said
it was because of the words that he had the day before to sit John^ Chandos.
So within a short space the marshals batayls were disconfyted / for they fell
our upon another and could not go forth: and the frenchmen that were behind
and could not get forward reculed back / and came on the battle of the duke
of Normandy / the which was great and thick and were a foot / but anon they
began to opyn behind. For when they knew that the marshals battle was
dysconfited they took their horses and deperted he that might best / also they
saw a rowt of englysshmen coming down a little mountain a horseback and
many archers with them / who brake in on the side of the dukes battle. True
to say the archers did their company that day great advantage / for they
shot so thick that the frenchmen wist not on what side to take heed / and
little and little the englysshmen wanne ground on them: and when the men of
arms of England saw that the marshals battle was dysconfited / and that the
dukes battle began^e to dysorder and opyn / they lept than on their horses the
which they had ready by them. Than they assembled to gyder and cried saint
George gyen: and the lord Chandos said to the prince / sir take your horse and
ride forth this journey is yors: god is this day in your hands / get us to
the french kings battle / for there lies all the sore of the matter. I think
verily by his valyantnesse he woll not fly: I trust we shall have him by the
grace of god and saint George / so he be well fought withal and sir I herd
you say that this day I should se you a good knight. The prince said let us
go forth / ye shall not se me this day return back / and said auau^ce baner
in the name of god and of saint George: the knight y^ bare it did his
commandment / there was than a sore battle and a perylous and many a man
overthrown / and he that was ones down coud not be relyued again without great
socoure and aid. As the prince rode and entered in among his enemies: he saw
on his right hand in a lylell busshe lyeng deed / the lord Robert of Duras
and his baner by him / and a ten or twelfe of his men about him: than the
prince said to two of his squyers and to three archers / sirs take the body of
this knight on a targe and bear him to Poycters / and present him fro me to the
cardynall of Pyergourt / and say how I salute him by ye token / and this was
done. The prince was informed that the cardynalles men were on the field
against him / the which was not pertaining to the right order of arms: for men
of the church that comes and goes for treaty of peace / ought not by reason
to ber harnes nor to fight for neither of the parties. They ought to be
indyfferent / and because these men had done so / the price was dyspleased with
the cardynall / and therefore he send unto him his nephue the lord Robert of
Duras deed. And the Cathelayn of Ampostre was takenne: and the printe would
have had his heed stryken of / because he was pertaining to the cardynall /
but than the lord Candos said / sir susfre for a season entende to a gretter
matter / and paraduenture the cardynall will make such excuse that ye shall be
content. Than the prince and his company dressed them on the battle of the
duke of Athenes constable of France: there was many a man slain and cast to
the yerth / as the frenchmen fought in companyes they cried (mountioy saint
Denyce) and ye englysshmen saint George gyen. Anoue the price with his company
met with the battle of almaygnes / whereof the earl of Salesbruce / the earl
Nosco / and therle Neydo were capitayns: but in a short space they were put to
^lyght. The archers shot so holly together that none durst come in their
dangers: they slew many a man that could not come to no ransom / these three
earls was there slain / and diverse other knights and squyers of their company.
And there was the lord Dambretycourt rescued by his own men and set on
horseback: and after he did that day many feats of arms and took good
prisoners. When the duke of No(...) (...)isle saw the prince aproche they
thought to (...) the^ self: and so the duke and the kings chrldren / the earl
of Poycters / and the earl of Tourayne who were right young by leued their
governors and so departed fro the field: and with them mo than eight hundred
spears / y^ stake no stroke that day. How beit the lord Guysshard Dangle /
and the lord John^ of Sayntre / who were with the earl of Poicters would not
slye: but entered into the thyckest prease of the battle. The kings three
sons took the way to Chamigny and the lord John^ of Landas / and the lord
Thy bault of Woodney / who were set to a wayt on the duke of Normandy: when
they had brought the duke a long leage fro the battle / than they took leave
of the duke and desired the lord of saint Uenant / that he should not leave
the duke but to bring him in sauegarde / whereby he should wyn more thank of
the king than to abide still in the field. Than they met also the duke of
Orleaunce and a great company with him / who were also departed fro the field
with clear hands / there were many good knights and squyers though that their
masters departed fro the field / yet they had rather a dyed than to have had
any reproach. Than the kings battle ca^^ on the englysshmen / there was a
sore fight and many a great stroke given and received: the king and his youngest
son met with the battle of thenglysshe marshalles / therle of Warwyke /
and therle of Suffolk: and with them of gascons the Captall of Buz / the
lord of Pomyers / the lord Amery of Charre / the lord of Mucydent / the
lord of La^guran / and the lord de la Strade. To the french party there
came time enough the lord Johan of Landas / and the lord of Woodney / they a
lyghted a foot and went into the kings battle. And a little beside fought
the duke of Athenes constable of france / and a little above him the duke of
Burbone and many good knights of Burbonoyse and of Picardy with him. And a
little on the one side there were the poyteuyns / the lord de (...) the lord
of Partney / the lord of (...) / the lord of Montahoton / the lord of
Suggeres / the lord Johan Sayntre / the lord Guysshar / de Dangle / the lord
Argenton / the lord of Lymyers / the lord of Mountandre / and diverse other.
Also the Uycount of Rocheuatt / and the earl of Daunoy. And of Burgone the
lord James of Beauye^ / the lord de la Castle Uilayn and other. In another
part there was the earl of Uantadowre: and of Mounpenser / the lord James of
Burbone / the lord Johan Darthoyes / and also the lord James his brother /
the lord Arnolde of Cernolle called the Archepreest armed for the young earl
of Alansonne. And of Auuergne there was / the lord of Mar^^ell / the lord de
la Tower / the lord of Chalenton / the lord of Montague / the lord of
Rochfort / the lord de la Chair / the lord Dachone / And of Lymosyn: there
was the lord Delmall the lord of Norwell / the lord of Pers Buff^er And of
Pycardie: there was the lord Wyllyam of Nerle / the lord Arnolde of Renewall
/ the lord Geffray of saint Dygier / the lord of Chamy / the lord of Heley /
the lord of Mounsaunt / the lord of Hangyes / and diverse other. And also in
the kings battle there was therle Duglas of Scotland / who fought a season
right valyantly: but when he saw the dysconfyture / he departed and saved
himself / for in no wise he would be takenne of the englysshmen / he had
rather ben there slain. On the english part the lord James Awdeley / with
the aid of his four squyers / fought always in the chyefe of the battle: he
was soore hurt in the body and in the vysage / as long as his breath served
him he fought. At last at the end of the battle his four squyers took and
brought him out of the field and laid him under a hedge side for to refresshe
him. And they unarmed him and bound up his wounds as well as they could. On
the french party king Johan was that day a full right good knight: if the
fourth part of his men had done their deuoyers as well as he did / the
journey had been his / by all lykelyhode. How be it they were all slain and
takenne that were there: except a few that saved themself that were with the
king. There was slain: the duke Peter of Burbon / the lord Guyssharde of
Beauieu the lord of La^das / and the duke of Athenes constable of France /
the bishop of Chalons in Champayne / the lord Wyllm^ of Neell / the lord
Gustace of Rybamont / the lord de la Tower / the lord Wyllyam of Montagu /
sir Guyuenton of Cha^bley / ser Ba(...) de la house / and many other as they
fought by companyes: and there were taken prisoners: the lord of Wodney / the
lord of Pompador: and the archpreest sore hurt / the earl of Uandos the earl
of Mons / the earl of Genuyll the earl of Uandone / sir Loyes of Melwall / the
lord Pyers Buffyer / and the lord of Senerachet there were at that brunt
slain and taken mo than two hundred knights.

Of two frenchmen that fled fro the battle of Poicters / and two englysshmen
that followed them. Cap. C.lxiii.
AMong the batayls / recounterynges / chases / and pursuetes y^ were made that
day in the field: It fortuned so to sir Edward of Roucy / that when he
departed fro y^ field: because he saw y^ feld was lost without recovery / he
thought not to abide the danger of the englysshmen. Wherefore he fledd all alone
and was gone out of the field a leage / and an english knight pursued him and
ever cried to him (and said) return again sir knight: it is a sha^e to fly
away thus. Than the knight turned and thenglysshe knight thought to have
stricken him with his spear in the targe but he failed / for sir Edward
swarued a side fro the stroke / but he failed not the english knight / for he
struck him such a stroke on the helm with his sword that he was astonyed /
and fell fro his horse to the yerth and lay still. Than sir Edward a lighted
and came to him or he could rise (and said) yield you rescue or no reseue: or
else I shall slay you / the englysshman yielded and went with him and afterward
was rau^somed. Also it fortuned that an other squire of Picardy called Johan de
Helenes was fled fro the battle and met with his page / who delyuerd him a
new fresshe horse whereon he rode away alone: The same season there was in the
field the lord Bercle of England a young lusty knight / who the same day had
reryd his baner: and he all aloue pursued the said Johan of Helenes / and
whan^e he had followed the space of a leage / the said John^ turned again and
laid his sword in the rest instead of aspeare / and so came ro^nyng to ward
the lord Bercle / who lift us his sword to have stryken y^ squire / but when
he same the stroke come he turned fro it / so that the englysshman lost his
stroke: and Johan struck him as he past on the arm / that the lord Berclees
sword fell into the field. When he saw his sword down / he lyghted so
daynly of his horse / and came to the place where his swerd lay: and as he
stouped down to take up his swerd the french squire did pycke his sword at
him and by hap struck him through both the thy* es / so that the knight fell
to the yerth and could not help himself / and Johan a lyghted of his horse
and took the knights sword that lay on the ground / and came to him and
demanded if he would yield him or not. The knight than demanded his name: sir
said he I hight Johan of Helenes / but what is your name: certainly said the
knight my name is Thomas and am lord of Bercle / a fair castle on the river
of Seuern in the marches of Wales. Well sir quod the squire than ye shall be my
prisonere: and I shall bring you in sauegarde / and I shall se that you shall
be healed of your hurt. Well said the knight I am content to be your prisoner
/ for ye have by law of arms won me: there he swar to be his prisoner /
rescue or no rescue. Than the squire drew forth the sword out of the
knights thyes: and the wound was opyn / thafie he wrapped and bound the
wound and set him on his horse / and so brought him fair and easily to
Chaterlerant and there tarried more than fyftene days for his sake / and did
get him remedy for his hurt. And wha^ he was somewhat amended: than he gate
him a lytter and so brought him at his ease to his house in Picardy: there he
was more than a year till he was perfetly hole: and when he departed he paid
for his ransom sire thousand nobuls / and so this squire was made a knight
by reason of the profette that he had of the lord Bercley.

How king John^ was taken prisoner at the battle of Poycters. Cap. C.lxiiii.
OFten times the adventures of amors and of ear are more fortunate and man
uelous / than any man can think or wysshe: truly this battle the which was
nere to Poycters / in the feldes of Beaumont and Malpertnes: was right great
and peryllous / and many deeds of arms there was done / the which all came not
to knowledge. The fyghters on both parties endured much pain: king John^ with
his own hands hyd that day maruels in arms / he had an axe in his hands
wherewith he defended himself and fought in the brekynge of the prease / nere
to the king there was taken the earl of Tankernyll / sir Jaques of Burbon earl
of Ponthieu / and the lord Johan of Arthoyes earl of Ewe. And a little above
that under the baner of the Captall of bu^ was taken sir Charles of Arthoys /
and diverse other knights and squyers: the chase endured to the gates of
Poiters / there were many slain and beaten down horse and man / for they of
Poyters closed their gates and would sussre noue to enter. wherefore in the
stretebefore the gate was horrible murdre / men hurt and beaten down / the
frenchemen yielded themself as far of as they might know an englysshma^: there
were byuers ^glysshe archers y^ had.iiii. v. or. vi prisoners / y^ lord of
Pous a great baron of Poiton was there slain / and many other knights and
squyers. And there was taken therle of Rochuart / y^ lord of Da^naueme^t / the
lord of Pertney: and of Xaynton the lord of Montendre and the lord John^ of
Sayntre / but he was so sore hurt that he had never health after: he was repured
for one of y^ best knights in France. And there was left for deed among other
deed men: the lord Rychard Dangle / who fought yt day by the king right
valya^t ly / and so did the lord of Charny on whom was great prease because he
bare y^ sovereign baner of the kings / his own bauer was also in y^ field the
which was of goules / three scochyns silver. So many englysshmen and gascons
came to that part y^ perforce they opyned the kings batell: so that the
frenchmen were so mengled among their enemies / that sometime there was five
men upon one ge^tylman: there was taken y^ lord of Po^padour / and the lord
Bartylmewe de Brunes: and there was slain sir Gestray of Charny with the kings
baner in his hands. Also y^ lord Reynold Cobhm^ slew therle of Da^martyn:
than there was a great prease to take y^ king and such as knew him cried ser
yield you or else ye ar but deed. There was a knight of saint Omers retained in
wages with the king of England called ser Denyce Morbecke / who had served the
englysshmen.v. year before / because in his youth he had forfayted the realm
of France for a murdre yt he did at saint Omers. It happened so well for him:
y^ he was next to the king when they were about to take him / he stepte forth
into the prease / and by strength of his body and arms / he came to the
french king and said in good french (sir yield you) the king be held the
knight and said to whom shall I yield me. Where is my cosyn the prince of
Wales: if I might se him I would speak with him / Denyce auswered (and said)
sir he is not here / but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him: who be
you quod the king: sir quodhe I am Denyce of Morbecke a knight of Arthops /
but I serve the king of England because I am banysshed the realm of France /
and I have forfaytedde all that I had there. Than the king gave him his right
gauntlet (saying I yield me to you) there was a great prease about the king:
foreuery man entorsed him to say I have taken him so that the king could not go
forward with his young son the lord Philyppe with him / because of y^
prease. The price of Wales who was coragious and cruel as a lion took that day
great pleasure to fight and to chase his enemies / the lord John^ Chandos who
was with him / of all that day never left him nor never took head of taking of
any prisoner. Than at the end of the battle (he said to the prince) sir it
were good that you rested her and set your baner a high in this busshe that
your people may draw hyder / for they be sore spredde a broad / nor I canse no
mo baners nor penons of the french party: wherefore sir rest and refresshe you
/ for ye be sore chafed. Than the princes baner was set vpp^ a high ou a
busshe: and trumpettes and clarions began to sown / than the prince did of his
basenet: and the knights for his body / and they of his chamber were ready
about him and a reed pauilyou pyght vpp^: and than drink was brought forth
to the prince / and for such lords as were about him / the which still
increased as they came fro the chase there they tarried / and their prisoners
with them. And when the two marshalles were come to the prince: he demanded
of them if they knew any tidings of the french king (they answered and
said) sir we here none of certenty / but we thike verily he is other deed or
taken / for he is not gone out of y^ batels. Than the prince said to therle of
warwyke / and to sir Reynolde Cobham: sirs I require you god forth and se what
ye can know / that at your return ye may show me the trauth. These two
lords took their horses and departed fro y^ prince: and rode up a little hill
to look about them / than they parceyued a flock of men of arms coming
together right werely. There was the french king a foot in great parell for
englysshmen and gascoyns were his masters / they had taken him fro ser Denyce
Morbecke perfore / and such as were most of force said I have taken him: nay
quod another I have taken him / so they straue which should have him. Than the
french king to eschew that peril said: sirs strive not led me courtesly / and
my son to my cosyn the prince and strive not for my taking / for I am so
great a lord to make you all rich: the kings words somewhat a peased them /
how beit ever as they went they made riot and brauled for the taking of the
king. When the two foresaid lords saw and herd that noise and strife among
them: they came to them and said / sirs what is the matter that ye strive for /
sirs said one of the^ it is for the french king who is here taken prisoner:
and there be mo than.x. knights and squyers that chalengeth the taking of him
and of his son: than^e the two lords entered into the prease and caused every
man to draw a back / and commanded them in the princes name on pain of
their heedes to make no more noise nor to aproche the king no nerer without
they were commanded. Than^e every man gave rowme to the lords: and they a
lyghted and did their reuere^te to the king / and so brought him and his son in
peace and rest to the prince of Wales.

Of the gift that the prince gave to the lord Audeley after the batell of
Poycters. Ca. C.lxv.
As Soon as therle of War wyke / and the lord Cogham were departed fro the
prince / as ye have herd before: than the prince demanded of the knights
that were about him for the lord Audeley if any knew any thing of him. Some
knights that were there answer (and said) sir he is sore hurt and lies in a
lytter her beside: by my faith said the prince of his hurtes I am rightsorie /
go and know if he may be brought hyder / or else I woll go and se him there as
he is. Than^e two knights came to the lord Awdeley (and said) sir the prince
desires greatly to se you: outher ye must go to him or else he woll come to you
/ a sir said the knight. I thank the prince / when he thinks on so poor a
knight as I am than he called eight of his servants / and caused them to bear
him in his lytter to the place were as the prince was. Than the prince took
him in his arms and kyst him and made him great chere (and said) sir James I
ought greatly to honor you: for by your valyaunce ye have this day achyued ye
grace and renome of us all / and ye ar reputed for the most valyant of all
other. A sir said the knight ye say as it pleases yeu: I would it were so /
and if I have this day any thing auaunced my self to serve you / and to
acomplysshe the vow that I made / it ought not to be reputed to me any prowes:
sir James said the prince I and all ours take you in this journey for the best
doar in arms / and to thyntent to furnysshe you the better to pursue y^ wars
I retain you for ever to be my knight with five hundred marks of yearly
revenues / the which I shall assign you on mine heritage in England. Sir
said the knynght god grant me to deserve the great goodness that ye show
me: and so he took his leave of the prince for he was right feeble / and so his
servants brought him to his lodging / and as soon as he was gone the earl of
Warwyke / and the lord Combham returned to ye prince and presented to him the
french king. The prince made lowly reverence to the king: and caused wine and
spyces to be brought forth / and himself served the king in sign of great
love.

How the englysshmen wan greatly at the battle of Poycters. Cap. C.lxvi.
THus this battle was dysconfyted as ye have herd the which was in the feldes
of Malpertnesse a two leages fro Poyters / the.xxii. day of septe^bre the year
of our lord * M. CCC.lvii. it began in the morning and endyd at noon / but as
than all the englysshmen were not returned fro y^ chase therefore the princes
banner stood on a busshe to draw all his men together / but it was by night or
all came fro the chase. And as it was reported there was slain all the flower
of France / and there was taken with the king and the lord Philyppe his son
a seuyntene earls / beside baroner / knights / and squyers: and slain a five
or six thousand of one and other. When every man was come fro the chase /
they had twyse as many prisoners as they were in nombre in all: than it was
counsayled among them because of the great charge and dout to keep so many that
they should put many of them to ransom inco^tynent in the field / and so they
did. And the prisoners found the englysshemen and gascoyns right courtesse:
there were many that day put to ransom and let go / all only on their
promise of faith and trauth / to return again between that and Christmas to
Burbeux with their raunsomes. Than that night they lay in the field beside
where as the battle had been: some unarmed them but not all and unarmed all
their prisoners / and every man made good there to his prisoner / for yt day
who soever took any prisoner he was clear his / and might quyte or ransom him
at his pleasure. All such as were there with the prince were all made rich
with honor and goods / as well by ransomyng of prisoners as by winning of
gold / silver / plate / tewelles / that was there found. There was no man
that did set any thing by rich harness whereof there was great plenty / for
the frenchmen came thither richely besene / wenynge to have had the journey for
them.

How the lord James Audley gave to his four squyers the.v. C. marks of
revenues that the prince had given him. Cap. C.lxvii.
When sir James Awdeley was brought to his logynge / than he send for sir Peter
Audeley his brother / and for the lord Bartylmewe of brunes / the lord
Stephane of Gousenton / the lord of Wylly / and the lord Ralfe Ferres. All
these were of his lynage: and than he called before them his four squiers that
had served him that day well and trewly: than he said to the said lords / sirs
it has pleased my lord the prince to give me five hundred marks of revenues
by year in heritage / for the which gift I have done him but small service
with my body. Sirs behold here these four squyers / who has always served
me truly (and specially this day) that honor that I have is by their
valyantnesse / wherefore I woll reward them: I give and resign into their
hands the gift that my lord ye prince has given me of five hundred marks of
yerly revenues to them and to their heirs forever / in like manner as it was
given me: I clearly disheryte me thereof and inheryte them without any rebel or
condycion. The lords and other that were there every man beheld other and said
among them self / it comes of a great noblenes to give this gift. they
answered him with one voice sir be it as godde will / we shall bear witness in
this behalf where soever we become. Than^e they departed fro him and some of
them went to the prince who the same night would make a supper to the french
king / and to the other prisoners: for they had than enough to do it withal
of that the frenchemen brought with them for the englysshmen wanted vitayle
before: for some in three days had no bredde before.

How the prince made a supper to the french king the same day of the battle.
Cap. C.lxviii.
THe same day of the battle at night the prince made a supper in his lodging
to the french king and to ye most part of the great lords that were
prisoners: the prince made the king and his son / the lord James of Burbone /
the lord John^ Darthoys / the earl of Tankernyll / therle of Stampes / therle
Dampmartyne / the earl of Grauyll / and the lord of Pertenay to sit all at one
board: and other lords / knights / and squiers at other tables. And always
the prince served before the king as humbly as he could / and would not sit at
the kings board / for any desire that the king could make: but he said he
was not suffycient to sit at the table with so great a prince as the king was /
but than he said to the king: sir for goddessake make non yuell nor heavy there,
though god this day did not consent to follow your will / for sir surely the
king my father shall bear you asmoche honor and amyte as he may do / and
shall acorde with you so reasonably that ye shall ever be friends to guyder
after. And sir me think ye ought to rejoice though the journey be not as ye
would have had it / for this day ye have won the high renome of prowes / and
have past this day in valyantnesse all other of your party. Sir I say natte
this to mock you: for all that be on our partte ye saw every man's deeds ar
plainly acorded by true se(...) to give you the price and chapelette.

Therewith the frenchemen began to murmr and said among themself: how the
prince had (...) nobly / and that by all estimacion he should prove a noble man
if god send him life / and to perceyuer in such good fortune.

how the prince returned to Burdeux after the battle of Poycters. Cap.
C.lxix.
When supper was done every man went to his lodgyng with their prisoners: ye
same night they put many to ransom and belyued the^ on their faythes and
trauthes and raunsomed them but easily / for they said there would set no
knights ransom so high / but that he might pay at his ease and maynteyne
still his degree. The nerte day when they had herd mass and taken some repast
/ and that every thing was trussed and ready: than they took their horses and
rode to wards Poycters. The same night there was come to Poycters the lord of
Roy with a hundred speres he was not at the battle / but he met the duke of
Normandy nere to Chauuigny / and the duke send him to Poycters to keep the
town / till they herd other tidings. When the lord of Roy knew that
thenglysshmen were so nere coming to the city: he caused every man to be
armed and every man to go to his defense / to the walls / towers / and gates:
and the^glysshmen pass by without any aprochynge / for they were so laded with
gold / silver / and prisoners, that in their retournynge they assauted no
fortres. They thought it a great deed if they might bring the french king
with their other prisoners and riches that they had won in sauegard to
Bordeaux: they rode but small iourneys because of their prisoners and great
caryages that they had they rode in a day no more but four or five leages / and
loged ever betymes: and rode close together in good array saving the marshalles
batayls / who rode ever before with fine. C. men of arms to opyn the passages
as ye prince should pass / but they found no encounterers / for all the
country was so frayed that every man drue to the fortresses. As the prince rode
it was showed him how the lord Audeley had given to his four squyers the gift
of the five hundred marks / that he had given unto him. Than the prince send
for him: and he was brought in his lytter to the prince / who received him
curtesly (and said) sir James we have knoledge that the revenues that we gave
you / as soon as ye came to your lodgyng / you gave the same to four squyers:
we would know why ye did so / and whyder ye gift was agreeable to you or not.
Sir said the knight it is of trauth I have given it to the^: and I shall she we
you why I did so / these four squyers that be here present have alonge season
served me well and truly in many great besynesses / and sir at this last
battle they served me in such wise / that and they had never done nothing
else / I was bound to reward them: and before the same day they had never
nothing of me in reward. Sir I am but a man alone: but by the aid and confort
of the^ I took on me to acomplysshe my vow long be / fore made: I had been deed
in the battle and they had not ben. wherefore sir when I consydred the love
that they bare unto me / I had not ben curtesse if I would not a rewarded them:
I thank god I have had and shall have enough as long as I live / I will never
be a basshed for lack of good. Sir if I have done this without yor pleasure I
require you to pardon me: for sir both I and my squyers shall serve you as well
as ever we did. Than the prince said: sir James for a nything that ye have done
I can not blame you but can you good thank therefore / and for the valyantnes
of these squyers whom ye preyse so much / I acorde to them your gift: and I
woll render again to you.vi. C. marks in like manner as ye had the other. Thus
the prince and hsi company: did somoche that they past through Poyctou / and
Xaynton without damage / and came to Blay / and there passed the river of Geron
/ and aryued in the good city of Burdeux. It can not be recorded the great
feast and cherr that they of the city / with the clergy made to the prince /
and how honorably they were there received. The prince brought the french king
into the abbey of saint Andrews / and there they lodged both / the king in
one part / and the princeliu ye other. The prince bought of the lords / knygh
/ tes / and squyers of Gascone / the most part of the earls of the realm of
France such as were prisoners and paid ready money for the. There was diverse
questyons and chalenges made by twene the knights and squyers of Gascoyne /
for taking of the french king / How beit Denyce Morbecke by right of arms
and by true tokens that he showed / challenged him for his prisoner. Another
squper of Gascon called Bernarde of Troutes / said how he had right to him:
there was much a do and many words before the prince / and other lords that
were there and by cause these two challenged each other to fight in that
quarrel. The prince caused the matter to rest till they came in England / and
that no declaracyon should be made but before y^ king of England his father:
but because the french king himself aided to sustain the chale^g of Denyce
Morbecke / for he enclyned more to him than to any other. The prince therefore
privily caused to be delyuerd to the said ser Denyce.ii. M. nobuls / to
mayntene withal his estate. Anon after the prince came to Burdeux / ye
cardynall of Piergort came thither / who was send fro the pope in legacyon as it
was said / he was there more than^e.xv. days or the prince would speak with
him / because of the Chatclayne of Campost and his men / who were against him
in the battle of Poicters. The prince belyued that the cardynall send them
thither: but the cardynall did somoch by the means of the lord of Chamont /
the lord of Monferant / and the Captall of Buz / who were his cosyus. They
showed so good reasons to the prince / that he was content to here him speak.
And when he was before the prince he excused himself so sagely / that the
prince and his counsel held him excused / and so he fell again into the
princes love / and redeemed out his men by reasonable raunsoms. and ye Cathelayne
was set to his ransom of.x. M. frankes / the which he paid after. Than the
cardynall began to treat on the delyuerance of the french king / but I pass
it brefely because nothing was done. Thus the prince / the gascons and
englysshmen tarried styllat Burdeux ^yll it was lent in great mirth and revel /
and spend folysshely the gold and silver y^ they had won. In England also
there was great joy whan^e they hard tidings of the battle of Poycters of
the dysconfityng of the frenchmen / and taking of the king: great solemnytes
were made in a^ churches / and great fyers / and wakes throughout all England.
The knights and squyers such as were come home fro that journey were much
made of and praised more than other.

How the three estates of France assembled together at Paris / after the battle
of Poycters. Cap. C.lxx.
THe same seson that the battle of Poicters was / the duke of Lancastre was in
ye cou^tie of Eureux / and on the marches of Co^stantyne and with him the lord
Philyp^ of Nauer / and the lord God* sray of Harcort. They made war in
Normandy: and had done all that season in the tytell of the king of Nauer /
whom the french king held in prison. These lords did all that they might to
have been at the journey of Poyters with ye prince but they could not: for all
the passages on the river of Loyre were so well kept / y^ they might not pass.
But when they herd how the prince had taken the french king at the battle of
Po^ters they were glad / and brake up their journey: because the duke of
Lancastre / and sir Phylyppe of Nauer would go into England / and so they did
and they send sir Godfray of Harcort to saint Sauyoursle vycont / to keep there
fronter war. Now let us speak of the french kings thresonnes: Charles /
Loys / and John^ who were returned fro the besynes at Poyters they were right
young of age and of counsel. In the^ was but small recovery: nor there was none
of the^ that would take on him the gouerna^ce of the realm of France. Also the
lords knights and squyers such as fled fro the battle / were so hated and
blamed of the commons of ye realm (...) scant they durst abide in any good
town. The all the prelates of holy church being in France / bysshoppes /
abbottes / and all other noble lords and knights: and the provost of the
marcha^tes ye burgesses of Paris / and the counsels of other good towns. They
all assembled at Paris: and there they would ordain how the realm should be
governed till the king were delivered out of prison. Also they would know
fardet more what was become of the great treasure / that had been leuyed in the
realm: by deames / maltotes / subsidyes forgyng of moneys / and in all other
extorcyons / whereby the people has been ouerlayd and troubled: and the
soudyours yuell paid / and the realm yuell kept and defendedde. But of all
this there were none that could give account: than they agreed that the
prelates should chose out twelfe persons among them / who should have power
by them and by all the clergy: to ordain and to advise all things couenable
to be done. And the lords and knights to choose other twelfe among them / of
their most sagest and dyscrete persons / to determyne all causes: And the
burgesses to chose other twelfe for the commons. The which sire and thyrtie
persons should often times mete at Paris / and they to common and to ordain
for all causes of the realm: and every matter to be brought to them: and to
these three estates all other prelates / lords / and commons should obey. So
these persons were chosen out: but in the beginning there were diverse in
this clectyon / that the duke of Normandy was not content withal / nor his
counsel. First these three estates defended evermore forgynge of money / also
they required the duke of Normandy / that he would a rest the chaunceler of the
king his father / the lord Robert of Lorreys / and the lord Robert of Bucy /
and diverse other masters of the cou^tes / and other counsaylours of the
kings: to the intent that they might make a true acount of that they had
taken and leuyed in the realm and by their counsaylles. When these masters
and counsaylours herd of this matter / they departed out of the realm into
other countries / to abide there till they herd other tidings.

How the three estates send men of war against the lord Godfray of
Harecourt. Cap. C.lxxi.
THese three estates ordained and stablysshed in their names receyuers of all
male totes / deames / subsidyes / and other rightes pertaining to the king /
and to the realm. And they made new money to be forged of fine gold called
moutons: also they would gladly that the king of Nauer had been delyuerd out of
prison / where as he was at the castle of Creuecure in Cambresis. It was
thought by diverse of the three estates: that the realm of France should be the
more stronger and the better defended / if he would be true to the realm for
they saw well there were than^e but few nobles to maynteyne the realm: for
they were nyghe all taken^e and slain at the battle of Poycters. Than^e they
required the duke of Normandy to deliver him out of prisonne / for they said
how they thought he had great wrong to be kept in prisone / for they wist
not why. The duke answered (and said) how he durst not take on him his
delyueraunce: for the king his father put him in prisone he could not tell
for what cause. The same season there came tidings to the duke / and to the
three estates / that the lord Godfray of Harecout made fore war in Normandy /
and over ran the country two or three times in a weke / sometime to the
subbarbes of Cane / of saint Low / Eureux / and Constances. Than the duke and
the three estates: ordained a company of men of arms of three hundred spears /
and five hundredde of other: and made four capitayns / the lord of Rauenall /
the lord of Kenny / the lord of Ryuell / and y^ lord of Friamyll. These men
of war departed fro Paris and went to Rowan: and there they assembled on all
parts / there were diverse knights of Arthoys and of Uermandoys / as y^ lord
of Kenckey / the lord Loyes of Hanefkell / the lord Edward of Rousy / the
lord John^ Fenes the lord Ingram of Hedyn: and diverse other. And also of
Normandy there were many expert men of arms: and these lords rode to
Co^stances / and there made their garyson.

none should go forward without he commanded. The archers began to aproch and
those feersly the frenchmen who were well armed and pauysshed suffered their
shot / it did them no great hurt. So the frenchemen stood still / till the
archers had spent all their arowes: than they (...) away their bows / and
resorted back to their men of arms / who were a ranged a long by a hedg^:
and sir Godfray with his ba^er before them. Than the french archers began to

their men of arms began feersly to aproche / there was a fo^e fight. When they

How the prince conucyed the french king fro Burdeux into England. Cap.
C.lxxiii.
AFter the beth of this knight sir Godfray of Harcourt: the frenchmen returned
to Co^stances with their prisoners and pyliage. And anon after they went into
France to the duke of Normandy / who as than was called regent of France / and
to the three estates wh^ received them right honorably. So fro thens forth
saint Savior le vycont was englysth(...) and all the lords pertaining to sir
Godfray of Harcourt / for he had sold it to the king of England after his
dyscease / and dishery^ed y^ lord Loys of Harcort his nephue: by cause he
would not take his part. Issone as the king of England herd tidings of the
death of the lord Godfray of Harcort he was sorry thereof. Tha^ he sent
inco^tynent men of arms knights / s^uyers / and archers mo than. CCC. by see:
to go and take possessyon for him of saint Savior le Uyco^t the which was
worth.xxc. M. frankes by year: and made captain of those lands the lord
Johan Lyle. The three estates all that season studied ou the ordinance of the
realm of France and it was all governed by them: the same winter y^ prince of
Wales and such of England as were with him at Burdeux / ordained for ships
to convey the french king and his son: and all other prisoners into
England. And when the time of his departed aproched: than he commanded the
lord ^albert the lord of Musydent / the lord de (...) aspare the lord of
Punyers / and the lord of Rosen to keep y^ contre there till his return
again. Than he took the sea and certain lords of Gascoyne with him: the
french king was in a vessel by him self to be the more at his ease /
acompanyed with two hundred men of arms and two thousand archers for it was
showed the prince that the three estates by whom the realm of France was
governed / had laid in Normandy and Crotoy two great armies: to the intent to
mete with him / and to get the french king out of his hands if they might:
but there were no such that apered. And yet they were on the sea.xi. days and
on the.xii. day they aryued at Sandwych: than they issued out of their ship
and lay there all that night and tarried there two days to refresshe them: and
on the third day they rode to Canterbury. When the king of England knew of
their coming / he commanded the^ of London to prepare them and their cite to
receive such a man as the fre^ / che king was. Than they of London arrayed
themself by co^panyes: and the chief masters clothyng dyfferent fro the
other at saint Thomas of Caunterbury the french king and the prince made their
offerynges / and there tarried a day and than rode to Rochester / and tarried
there that day and the next day to Dartforde: and the fourth day to London /
where they were honorably received and so they were in every good town as they
passed. The french king rode through London on a white courser well
aparelled: and the prince on a little black hobbey by him. Thus he was
conveyed a long the cite till he came to the Sauoy the which house pertayned to
the heritage of the duke of Lancastre: there the french king kept his house a
long season / and thither came to se him the king and the queen often times /
and made him great feast and chere. Anon after by the commandment of pope
Innocent the sirt there came into England the lord Taylleran cardynall of
Pyergort / and the lord Nycholas cardynall of Dargell. They treated for a
peace between the two kings but they could bring nothing to effect: but at
last by good means they procured a truse between the two kings and all their
assysters to endure till the feast of saint Johan the Baptyst / in the year of
our lord god. M. CCC.lix. And out of this truse was excepted ye lord Philyppe
of Nauerr and his alyes the countess of Mountfort / and the duchy of Bretayne.
Anon after the french king was removed fro the Sauoy to the castle of
wyndsore and all his house hold: and went a huntyng and a haukyng there about
it his pleasur and the lord Philypp his son with him: and all the other
prisoners abode still at London / and went to se the king at their pleasure /
and were received all only on their faythes.

How the king of Scotts was delivered out of prison. Cap. C.lxxiiii.
YE have herd here before how king Dauyd of Scotland was taken and was
prisoner in England more than.ix. year. And anon after the truse was
concluded between England and France: the two foresaid cardynals with the
bishop of saint Andrews in Scotland / fell in treaty for the delyuerance
of the king of Scotts. The treaty was in such manner / that the king of Scotes
should never after arm himself against the king of England in his realm /
nor counsel nor consent to any of his subgetes to arm them / nor to grieve
nor make war against England. And also the king of Scotts after his return
into his realm / should put to all his pain and dilygence that his men should
agree / that ye realm of Scotland should hold in fee / and do homage to the
king of England. And if the realm would not agree thereto: yet the king of
Scotts to swear solemply to keep good peace with the king of England: and to
bind himself and his realm to pay within.x. year after five hundred
thousand nobuls: and at the somonyng of the king of England / to send good
pleges and hostages: as the earl of Duglas / therle of Morette / the earl of
Mare / the earl of Surlant / the earl of Fie the baron of Uersey / and sir
Wyllyam of Caumoyse. And all these to abide in England as prisoners and
hostagers for the king their lord: unto the time that the said payment of
money be full content and paid. Of this ordinance and bonds / there were
made instruments / publykes / and letters patentes sailed by both kings. And
than the king of Scotts deperted and went into his realm / and his wife queen
Isabell suster to the king of England with him: and he was honorably
received in his realm and he went and lay at saint Johsis town on the river
of Try / till his castle of Edenborough was new prepared.

How the duke of Lancaster laid siege to Reins. Cap. C.lxxv.
About the mids of May / in the year of our lord god. M. CCC.lvii. the duke
of Lacastre made in Breten a great army of englysshmen and of bretons / in the
aid of the countess of Moutfort and or ner young son: they were in nombre a
thousand men of arms well aparelled / and.v. hundred of other with archers.
And they departed on a day fro Hanybout: and went forth bre^nyng and exilyng
the country of Bretayne / and so came before the good cite of Reins / and
laid siege thereto and made many assautes and little good did: for within was
the Uycount of Rowan / the lord dela wall / sir Charles of Dignen and diverse
other. And also there was a young bachelar called Bertraude of ^lesquyne / who
during the siege fought with an englyssh / man / called sir Nycholas Dagorne:
and that battle was taken^e three courses with a spear / three strokes with an
are / and three with a dagger. And each of these knights bare themself so
valyantly / that they departed fro the field without any damage / and they were
well regarded both of them within / and they without. The same season the
lord Charles de Bloyes was in the country and pursewed sore the regent of
France desyring him to send men of war to reyse the siege at Reins / but
the regent had such busynes with the matters of the realm / that he did
nothing in that cause. So the siege lay still before Reins.

How a knight of the county of Eureuse called sir wyllyam of Granuyll wan the
city and castle of Eureux / the which as than was french: for the french
king had won it fro the Naaeroys / as ye have herd before. Capitulo. C. lxxvi
A knight named the lord of Granuyll / pertaining to the king of Nauer both
by faith and oath: greatly it displeased him the prese^tme^t of the king of
Nauerre / and also it was right dysplesant to some of the burgesses of Eureur /
but they could not amend it: because the castle was their enemy. This lord
dwelt a two leages fro the cite: and osten times he resorted to the cite to a
burges house / that in time before ever loved well the king of Nauer. Wha^ this
lord came to this burgess house he would eat and drink with him: and speak
and common of many matters / and specially of the king of Nauer and of his
taking / wherewith they were nothing content. And on a time this lord said to
the burges if ye woll agree with me Ishal on a day wyn again this cite / bourge
/ and castle / to the behofe of the king of Nauer / how may that be said y^
burges / for the captayn of the castle is so good a fre^chman that he woll
never agree thereto / and with out the castle ye can do nothing / for the
castle over maistreth the city. Well quod the lord Wyllyam Ishall she we
you: first it behooves that ye get of your acorde three or four other
burgesses / and provide ready in your houses certain men well armed / and
Ishall warrant you on my peril that ye shall enter into the castle without
^anger by asubtyltie that I will co^pase. This burgess did somoche in a
brief time: that he did get a hundred burgesses of his opinyon: This lord
of Granuyll came in and out into y^ cite at his pleasure without any suspectyon
/ for he was never in harnes with sir Philyp of Nauerre in no journey that he
made: because his land lay nere to the city of Eureur. And also the french
king when he wan the city he caused all the lands there about to be bound
to him / else he would have taken them to his own use. So the freuche king had
the country / but the hertes of the people were still naueroyse: also if king
John^ had been in France as he was in England he durst not have done as he did
/ but he thought y^ matters of France were insore trouble: and also perceived
how the three estates were well minded to the delyuera^ce of the king of Nauer.
And when he saw all his matter ready (...) well forward / and that the burgesses
of his opinion were well aduysed what they should do / he armed himself with
secret armor and did on a ^^opp above and a cloak above that and under his
arm he bare a short batell axe and with him went a varlet who was ^riuy to his
mind. And so he came walkyng before the castle gate as he had often times done
before: he walked up and down so often / that at last the captain came down
and opyned the wycket as he was wont to do and stood and looked about him. And
when sir Wyllyamsame him: he went by little and little to him and saluted him
courtesly / the captain stood still and saluted him again. And when they came
nere together / they began to speak of diverse matters: and sir Wyllyam demanded
of him if he had herd any new tidings out of France. The captain who was
desirous to here news said: sir I here none I pray you if ye have herd any
let me here some part of them / with a right good will quod the lord
Wyllyam. Sir it is said in France that the king of Denmark / and the king of
Irelande ar alyed together: and has sworn to go forth together / and not to
return again into their countries till they have distroyed all England / and
have brought again the french king to Paris / for they are on the sea mo than
a. C. M. men And the englysshmen be in such dout of them / that they wot not
what to do / for there is an old saying among them that the danes should
dystroy them. The captain demanded how he knew those tidings: sir said
he / a knight of Flaunders did write this to me for certain / and he sent me
with ye letter the goodlyest chessemen that ever I saw. He found out that
mock because he knew well that the captain loved well the game of the
chesse: than the captain said / sir I pray you let me se them / I shall
send for them said sir Wyllyam / on the condycion that you woll play a game
with me for the wine. And than he said to his varlette: go thy way and fetch
me the chessemen / and bring the^ hither to the gate: the varlet departed / and
the captain and sir Wyllyam entered into the first gate / than the captain
closed the wycket after them with a bolt and locked it not. Thanne sir Wyllyam
said opyn the second gate / ye may well enough without any danger / the
captain opyned the wycket and did suffer sir Wyllyam to enter to se the
castle and he entered with him. The varlet than went straight to the burgesses
who had men ready in harnes i^ their houses: and he caused them to come hard to
the castle gate and than he sowned a little horn as it was devised before
that he should do. Whan^e the lord Wyllyam herd the horn he said to the
capytayne let us go out of the second gate for my varlet is coming: than
sir Wyllyam passed the wycket and stood still without / and the captain that
would a passed out after him / set out his fore and stouped down and put out
his heed. Than the lord Wylliam took the are that he had under his arm: and
struck the captain sin he a stroke that he claue his heed / and so fill down
deed on the groundsyll: than^e the lord Wyllyam went to the first gate and
opyned hit. Whan^e the watch man of the castle herd the horn he had great
marueyle: for there was a commandment given in the town / that on pain of
death none should sown any horn / than he looked and saw men in harnes come
ronnynge toward the castle gate / than he cried treason treason. Than they
within ye castle came to the gate and were sore a basshed when they saw it
opyn / and the captain deed ouerth wart the gate and the lord Willyam with
his axe in his hands to defend the enter: Than inco^tynent there came such as
were appointed to aid the lord Wyllyam and entered in at the first gate / and
so after to the second gate and drove back ye soudyers / and diverse were
taken and slain: and so entered into the castle. Thus by this manner was the
strong castle of Eureux won again: and than incontinent the city yielded up
/ and put out all the frenchmen / and than they send for the lord Philyp of
Nauer / who was as than newely come out of England / and thither he came and
made there his sauerayne garyson to make war against the good country of
Normandy / and with him was sir Robert Canoll / sir James Physen / sir Fryquet
of Friquant / the Bascle of Marnell / the lord Jouell / sir Fondrigas and
other / who did after much myschiefe in France as ye shall here herafter.

Of the companions whereof the archpreest was chief / and how he was honored
in Auygnon. Ca. C.lxxvii.
IN the same season there was a knight called sir Arnolde Canoll / and most
como^ly named archpreest / he assembled together a great company of men of war
of diverse contrees / such as lacked wages in other places. After the taking of
the french king they wyste not where than to win any thing in France: so
first they went toward Prouence / and took byforce many strong towns and
castelles / and robbed all the country to Auygnone. And they had none other
captain but this knight the archpreest: the pope Innocent the sixth / and the
cardynalles being at Auygnon had of that company great dout / and kept there
men day and night in harness: and made good watch. When this archepreest and
his company had robbed all the country: the pope and the clergy fell in treaty
with the^ / and so on a sure apoyntment they came to Auygnone / and they were
as honorably received / as though there had been a kings son. And often
times this knight dyned with the pope and with the cardynals / and they had
pardon of all their sins / and at their departing they had in reward.xl.
thousand crowns for him and his company. So some of his company departed: but
still the archpreest kept his company together.

Of an other sort of co^panyons whereof Russyn a walsshman was captain. Cap.
C.lxxviii.
ALso in the same season there rose an other company of men of war of all
contreys gathered together: and they kept between ye river of Loyr and the river
of Said. Wherefore none durst go nor ride between Paris and Orleaunce / nor
between Paris and Moutarges every man sledde to Paris: and the poor men of the
country fled to Orleance. These companyons made among them a captain called
Ruffyn / they made him knight: and by means of robbery and pyssage he was
marvelous rich / some day they would ride nere to Paris / another day to
Orlyaunce: another time to Chartres. There was no town nor fortress: saving
such as were strong and well kept / but was by the^ robbed and ouerron: as
saint Arnolde / Gallardon / Broumalx / Aloes / Estampes / Chastres / Montleher
/ Plounyers / Ingastynoes / Mylly / Larchant / Chastellon / Montarges / Isy^^es
and diverse other great towns / that it were marueyll to rehearse them. They
rode in and out about in the contre by.xx. by.xxx. and by.xl. and they found
no let: Also in Normandy by the sea side there was a gretter company of robbers
english and Naueroys: and sir Robert Canoll was chief of the^ and by such
means he wanne towns castles and fortresses: without any resystence. This ser
Robert Canoll had long used like manner / he was well worth a hundred thousand
cr^wnes / and kept ever with him many soudyers at his wages: they pylled and
robbed so well / that many were glad to follow him.

How the provost of the marchantes of Paris slew three knights in the
regentes chamber. Cap. C.lxxix.
IN this season that the three estates thus ruled: there rose in diverse
countrees certain manner of people calling themself companyons and they made
war to every man. The noble men of y^ realm of France and the prelates of
holy church began to wax weary of the rule and ordyna^ce of the three estates:
and so gave up their rule / and suffered the provost of the marchantes to me
dyll with some of the burgesses of Paris / because they meddled farther than^e
they were pleased withal. So on a day the regent of France was in the palace
of Paris / with many noblemen and prelates with him. The provost than assembled
a great nombre of commons of Paris / such as were of his opynion / and all
they ware hattes of one color: to thnetent to be known. The provost came to
the palace with his men about him / and entered into the dukes chamber: and there
egerly he desired him that he would take on him the medlyng of the business of
the realm of France: that the realm the which pertayned to him by enherytance
might be better kept / and that such companyons as goes about the realm
wastyng / robbyng / and pyllinge the same: might be subdued. The duke answered
how he would gladly entende thereto if he had wherewith: and said they that
receive the profet and the rightes pertaining to the realm ought to do it if
it be done or not I report me. So they multiplied such words between the^
that three of the greattest of the dukes counsel were there slain so nere him
/ that his clothes were all blody with their blood / and he himself in great
peril: but there was set one of their hattes on his heed / and he was feign
there to perdon the death of his three knights two of arms and the third of the
law: the one called y^ lord Robert of Cleremont a right noble man / another
the lord of Co^flans / and the knight of the law / the lord Symonde of Bucy.

How the king of Nauer came out of prison. Cap. C.lxxx.
AFter this foresaid auen ture certain knights as y^ lord John^ of Pequigny /
and other under the comfort of y^ provost of Paris / and of other counsaylours
of y^ good towns ca^e to the strong castle of Alleres in Paylleull in
Picardy / where the king of Nauer was in prison / under the keeping of the
lord Trystram du Boyse. They brought to them that kept the castle such
tokens / that they had the king of Nauer delyuerd into their hands: for the
captayn was not as tha^ there. And they brought him with great joy into the
city of Amyense where he was well received / and lyghted at a chanons house
who loved him entierly / called Guy Kyrrecke. And y^ king tarried there a
fyftene days: till he had so provided for himself / y^ he was assured of the
duke of Normandy than regent of France / for the provost of the marchantes of
Paris had get him his peace of the duke / and of them of Paris. And than
the king of Nauer was brought to Paris by the lord John^ of Pequigny and by
other burgesses of Amyense / where as every man was glad to se him: and the
duke made him great feast and chere / for it behaved him so to do. For the
provost and his sect exhorted him thereto: therefore the duke dissembled for the
pleasur of the provost / and other of Paris /

How the king of Nauerre preched solemply in Paris. Cap. C.lxxxi.
When the king of Nauer had been a certain time in Paris: on a day he
assembled together prelates / knights / and clerks of the vnyuersite. And there
he showed openly among them in latin / in y^ presence of the duke of Normandy:
his co^playnt and greffes / and vyolence done to him wrongfully / without right
or reason. And said how there was none that ought to dout in him: but that he
would live and dye in the defense of the realm of France and the crown
thereof / as he was bound to do: for he was extraught of father and mother of
the right lygne of France. And said if he would challenge the realm and
crown of France: he could show by right / how he was more nerer thereto
than the king of England. His sermon and langage was so pleasant that he was
greatly praised: and so little and little he entered into the favor of them of
Paris so yt he was better beloved there than the regent / the duke of Normandy:
and also with diverse other cites in the realm of France. But what soever
semblant the provost and they of Paris made to the king of Nauer / for all that
the lord Philyppe of Nauer would never trust the^ nor would not come to Paris:
for he always said that in a comynalte there was never no certentie / but
finally shame / rebuke / and dishonor.

Of the beginning of the rising of the commons / called Jaquere in Beauuosyn.
Cap. C.lxxxii.
Anon after the delyueraunce of the king of Nauer there began a meruelouse
trybulacion in the realm of France / as in Beauuosyn / in Bry / on the river
of Marne / in Leamoys / and about Seossons: for certain people of the common
vyllages without any heed or ruler / assembled together in Beauuosyn. In the
beginning they past not a hundred in nombre: they said how the noble men of
the realm of France / knights and squyers shamed the realm / and that it
should be a great wealth to dystroy them all / and each of them said it was true
and said all with one voice / shame have he that does not his power to distroy
all the ge^tylmen of the realm. Thus they gathered together without any other
counsel and without any armure^ saving with staves and knyues / and so went
to the house of a knight dwelling thereby / and brake up his house and slew the
knight and the lady and all his children great and small / and brent his house.
And than they went to another castle and took the knight thereof and bound him
fall to a stake: and than vyolated his wife and his daughter before his face /
and than slew the (...)die and his daughter / and all his other children And
than slew the knight by great tourment / and brent and beat down the
castle: and so they did to diverse other castelles and good houses: and they
multiplied so that they were a six thousand / and ever as they went forward
they increased / for such like as they were / fell ever to the^. So that every
gentylman fled fro them and took their wives and children with them / and
fled.x. or.xx. leages of to be in surety / and left their houses void and
their goods therein. These myscheuous people thus assembled without captain or
armoure: robbed / brent / and slew all gentylmen that they could lay hands
on: and forced and rauysshed ladies and damsels / and did such shameful
deeds that no humayne creature ought to think on any such. And he that did
most myschiefe was most preased with them and greattest master: I dare not
write the horrible deeds that they did to ladies and damoselles. Among other
they slew a knight and after did put him on a broche and roasted him at the
fire: in y^ sight of the lady his wife and his children / and after yt the lady
had been enforced and rauisshed with a.x. or.xii. they made her perforce to eat
of her husband / and after made her to die an yuell death and all her children.
They made among them a king / one of Cleremont in Beauuosyn: they chose him
that was most vngracyoust of all other / and they called him king Jaques
Goodman: and so thereby they were called companyons of the Jaquery. They
distroyed and brent in the country of Beauuosyn / about Corby / Amyense / and
Most dydier / mo than threscore good houses and strong castelles. In like manner
these unhappy people were in Bry and Arthoyes: so that all the ladies /
knights / and squyers of that country were feign to fly away: to Meaulx in
Bry / as well the duches of Normandy and the duches of Orlyaunce: as diverse
other ladies and damsels / orels they had been vyolated and after murdered. Also
there were a certain of the same ungracious people between Paris and Noyon / and
between Paris and Soyssons: and all about in the land of Coucy / in the
county of Ualoys / between Brieche and Loan: Noyon and Soyssons. There were
brent and distroyed mo than a hundred castelles and good houses / of knights
and squyers in that country.

How the provost of the marchantes of Paris / caused walls to be made about
the city of Paris. Cap. C.lxxxiii.
When the gentylmen of Beauuosyn / of Corboys / of Uerma^doys / and of other
lands where as these / myscheuous people were conversant: saw the woodnesse
among them / they sent for socours to their tre^des into Flanders / to Brabant
/ to Heynault / and to Behayne: so there came fro all parties. And so all these
gentylmen strangers with them of the country assembled together: and did set
on these people where they might find the^ and slew and hanged them upon trees
by heaps. The king of Nauer on a day slew of the^ mo than three thousand:
beside Cleremount in Beauuosyn. It was time to take them up: for and they had been all together assembled / they were mo than a hundred thousand: and when
they were demanded why they did so yuell deeds / they would answer and say
they could not tell: but y^ they did as they saw other do / thynkyng thereby to
have distroyed all y^ nobles and ge^tylmen of the world. In the same season
the duke of Normandy departed fro Paris / and was in dout of the king of
Nauer: and of the provost of the merchants and of his sect: for they were all
of one acorde. He rode to the brige of Charenton on the river of Marne / and
there he made a great sommons of gentylmen and than defied the provost of the
marcha^tes and all his ayders. Than the provost was in dout of him that he
would in the night time come and ouerron the city of Paris / the which as than
was not closed. Than he set workmen a work as many as he could get: and
made great dykes all about Paris / and began walls and gates: he had the space
of one hole year / a three hundred workmen contynually workyng. It was a great
deed to furnvsshe an arm / and to close with defense such a city as Paris:
surely it was the best deed that ever any provost did there / for else it had been
after diverse times over ron and rob had by by dyners occasyons.

Of the battle at Meaulx in Bry / where the companyons of the Jaquery were
disconfyted by therle of Fo^^ and the captall of B^z. Ca. Clxxxiiii.
IN the season while these ungracious people raygned there came out of Pruce /
the earl of Foyz and the Captall of B^z his cosyn. And i^ there way they herd
as they should have entered into France of the great myschefe that fell among
the noble men by these unhappy people. And in the city of Meaulx was the
duches of Normandy / and the duches of Orleaunce / and a three hundred other
ladies and damsels: and the duke of Orleance also. Than the two said knights
agreed to go and se these ladies and to confort them to their powers: how be
it the Captall was english but as than it was truse between ye two kings:
they had in their company a threscore spears. And when they were come to
Meaulx in Bry they were welcome to the ladies and damsels there: and when those
of the Jaquery understood that there was at Meaulx such a nombre of ladies /
young damoselles and noble children. Than they assembled together: and with them
they of Ualoys and so came to Meaulx: and also certain of Paris yt herd thereof
went to them / so that they were in all a nine thousand and daily mo resorted
to them. So they came to the gates of the town of Meaulx / and the people of
the town opyned the gates / and suffered them to enter / so that all the
streates were full of them to the market place / where as these noble ladies
were lodged in a strong place / closed about with the river of Marne: there
came such a nombre against them that ye ladies were sore afraid. Than these
two knights and their company came to the gate of the markette place and
issued out and set on those bilayns: who were but yuell armed. Therle of Foyz
baner and the duke of Orleance / and the Captals penon: and when these bilayns
saw these men of war well aparelled issued out to defend the place the for
mast of them began to recule back / and the gentylmen pursued them with their
spears and swerdes. And when they field the great strokes they reculed all a
tones / and fell for have each on other than all the noble men issued out of the
baryers and anon wan the place / and entered in among their enemies and beat
them down by heaps / and slew them like beestes / and chased the^ all out of
the town / and slew so many that they were weary / and made many of them by
heaps to fly into the river. Briefly: yt day they slew of them mo than
seuyn thousand and none had escaped if they would a followed the chase any
farther. And when these men of arms returned a gain to the town: they set
fire there on / and brende it clean / and all the bilayns of the town that
they could close therein: because they took part with the Jaquery. After this
disconsyture thus done at Meaulx: they never assembled a / gain together after
/ for the young Ingram lord of Coucy had about him certain men of warr^ and
they ever slew them as they might mete with them without any mercy.

How Paris was besieged by the duke of Normandy regent of France. Cap.
C.lxxxv.
A None after this adventure / the duke of Normandy assembled all the noble men
together that he could get / as well of the realm as of the empire for his
wages. So that he had a three thousand spears / and so went and laid siege to
Paris / toward saint Antoyne / a long by the river of Said / and was lodged
himself at saint More and his men there about / and every day they ran
skirmysshing to the walls of Paris. And some time the duke lay at Chare^ton /
and another season at saint More / so that nothing ca^e to Paris: on that side
another by land nor by water / for the duke caused both the ryuers of Said /
and Marne to be surely kept: and brende all the villages about Paris such as
were not closed the better thereby to chastyce them of Paris. And if Paris had
not than ben fortifyed with walls and dykes: it had been distroyed / none
durst go into Paris nor go out for fear of the dukes men / who rode on both
sybe^^ the river of Said at his pleasure / there were none to resyst them. The
provost kept still in love ye king of Nauerr and took of him counsel: and the
commons day and night did work on the defense of the city / and kept a great
no^bre of men of war / naueroyse and english archers: and other companyons.
There was in the city certain well dysposed persons: as John^ Mayllart / and
Symonde his brother / and diverse of their lynage that were sore dyspleased of
the duke of Norma^dyes yuell will: but the provost had so drawn to his opynion
all manner of men that none durst say contrary to him / without he were slain
without mercy. The king of Nauer seeing the varyaunce between them of Paris /
and the duke of Normandy: thought and supposed that the manner could not long
endure in that state. And he had no great trust to the co^montie of Paris: and
so he departed thense as curtesly as he might and went to saint Denyce and
there he kept with him a good nombre of soudyers / at the wages of them of
Paris. The duke thus lay a six wekes at Charenton / and ye king of Nauerre at
saint Denyce / they pylled and eat up the country on every side: between these
parties entreated for a peace / the archbysshoppe of Senus / the bishop of
Ausser / the bishop of Beaumoys / the lord of Momorency / the lord of
Fyenes / and the lord of saint Uenant. And so often they went between the
perties / and so sagely demeaned their business: yt the king of Nauerre with
his own good will without constreynt / went to Charenton to the duke of
Normandy and excused himself of that he was had in suspecte. First of the
death of the two knights / and of master Symonde Bucy and of the dispyte that
the provost had ^one to him in the paleys of Paris. And they he swear that it
was unknown to him: and there promised the duke to stycke with him in good and
yuell / and there peace was made between them. And the king of Nauersayde how
he would cause them of Paris / to make amends for that they had done. The duke
was content that the commons of Paris should have peace / so that he might
have the provost and.xii. other burgesses / such as he would chose within
Paris / to correct them at his pleasure. All these things agreed: the king
of Nauer returned to saint Denyce / and the duke went to Meaulx in Bry / and
gave leave to all his men of war to dept. Certain burgesses of Paris: such
as had helped to make the said treaty / desired ye duke to come to Paris /
saying how they should do him all the honor they might. The duke answered
(and said) he would keep ye peace made and that he had sworn unto / without
any brekyng of his part: but to enter into Paris surely (he said) he would
never / till he had satysfacryon of them that had dyspleased him. The provost
of the marchantes and his sect: often times visyted the king of Nauerre at
saint Denyce / and showed him how they were in the in dygnacion of ye duke of
Normandy for his sake because they delivered him out of prison / and brought
him to Paris. Therefore they said to him: ^ir for goddessake have no great
trust in the duke nor in his counsel. The king said certainly friends ye
shall have none yuell: but my part shall be therein / and seeing ye have as now
the governance of Paris / I would counsel you to provide your self of gold
and silver / so that if ye have need / by that ye may ever help your self.
And hardely send it hyder to saint Denyce on the trust of me / and I shall
keep hit well / and shall always entertayne men of warr^ secretly / that if ye
have need shall make war a gaynst your enemies. So thus after this the
provost two times a weke send ever to saint Denyce two summers charged with
floreyns to the king of Nauerr / who receyned the money with glad chere.

Of the parisyens that were slain at saint Clude by the^glysshmen that had
besodyers in Paris. Ca. Clxxxvi.
ALl this season there were in Paris a great nombre of men of war english
and naueroyse retained in wages by the provost / and by the commons of the
city to aid the^ against the duke of Normandy / who bare themself right well
the war du^yng but when y^ peace was made between the parisyens and the duke.
Certain of these soudyours departed fro Paris: and some abode there still /
such as departed went to the king of Nauer / who received them into wages /
there abode still in Paris a three hundred / they sported them and spend merely
their money. On a day a strife fell between them and they of Paris: and there
were slain of them a threscore / whereof the provost blamed greatly them of
the city. How beit to apease the commons: he took mo than a hundred and
fyftie / and put them in prison in three gates: and said to the commons / how
they should all be slain / and corrected acordyng to their trespaces: whereby
the commons were apeased. But when night came / the provost caused them to be
delivered out of prison: and put them out of the town at their liberty. And
so they went to saint Denyce to the king of Nauer: and he received and
retained them all. In the next morning when they of Paris knew the
delyueraunce of the englysshmen out of prison / they were greatly dyspleased
with the provost: but he like a wise man dyssembled the matter* till it was
forgoten. These english and naueroyse soudyers: when they were toguyder at
saint Denyce / they were mo than three hundred they determined to be revenged of
them of Paris / for the dispyte done to them. Than they defied them of Paris:
and made eger war against them / and to slay all manner of people of Paris
that issued out / so that they durst not go out of their gates. Than they of
the city desired the provost that he would cause part of the commons to be
armed / and to issue out into the feldes to fight with the englysshmen. The
provost agreed thereto (and said) how he would go with them himself: so on a
day he caused to be armed a.xii. hundred / and so issued out / and than they
herd how the englysshmen that made the^ war were about saint Clude. Than
they departed them into two companyes: to the intent that their enemies should
not escape them / and poynted to mete together at a certain place / beside saint
Clude. So they went by two ways the one party went all day about Mount Marter
/ and could not find their enemies / and the provost who had the less part /
about noone returned and entered into Paris at the gate saint Martyne / and had
done nothing. The other company who knew not of the prouostes returnyng
tarried still in the feldes till it was to wards night. Than^e they returned
homewarde without array or good order: for they thought than to have no trouble
/ and so they went weryly by heaps / some bare his salette in his hand / some
on his back / some drew their swerdes after them naked / and some in the
shethes. They took their way to enter into Paris by the gate saint Honor /
and suddenly as they went / they found thenglysshmen in a low way / they were
a four hundred well appointed. When they saw the frenchmen they set on them /
and at the first metyng they beat down mo than two hundred than the frenchmen
fled and were beat down like beestes. There were slain in that chase mo
than six hundred / and they were pursued to the barryers of Paris: of this
adventure the provost was greatly blamed of the commons / they said how he had
betrayed them. The next day in the morning: the friends of them that were
slain issued out of Paris to seek the deed bodies to bury them / and the
englysshmen had made abusshment / and there again they slew and hurt mo
than sixscore. Thus in this myschiefe and trouble were they of Paris / they
wist not of whom to beware / they were night and day in great fear: also the
king of Nauerre began to wax cold in aydinge of the^ / because of y^ peace
that he had sworn to the duke of Normandy. And also for the outrage that they
of Paris had done to thenglysshe soudyers / wherefore he well consented that
they should be chastysed: also the duke of Normandy did suffer it / because the
pro uost of the marchantes had y^ gouernyng of the city. The provost and his
sect were natte all in surety: for the commons spoke shamefully of the^ as
they were enfourmed.

Of the death of the provost of the merchants of Paris. Cap. C.lxxxvii.
THe provost and his sect had among themself diverse counsaylles secretly to
know how they should mayntene themself / for they could find by no means
any mercy in the duke of Normandy / for he send word generally to all the
commens of Paris / that he would keep with them no longer peace / without he
had delyuerd into his hands twelfe of Paris / such as he would chose / to do
with them his pleasure. The which thing greatly abashed the provost and his
company: finally they saw well that it were better for them to save their
lives / goods / and friends: ratherr than to be distroyed. And that it were
better for them to slay / than^e to be slain: than secreatly they treated
with thenglysshmen / such as made war against Paris. And they agreed between
them: that the provost and his sect should be at the gate saint Honor / and
at the gate saint Anthoyne at the hour of mydnight: and to let in the
englysshmen and naueroyse / provided ready to ouerr run the city: and to
dystroy and rob it clean. Ercept such houses as had certain signs
lymyted among them / and in all other houses without such tokens to slay
men / womenne / and children. The same night that this should have been done:
god enspyred certain burgesses of the city / such as always were of the
dukes party: as Johanne Mayllart / and Symonde his brother / and diverse other.
Who by dyuyne inspyracion: as hit ought to be supposedde / were enfourmed that
Paris should be that night distroyed. They incontinent armed them and showed
the matter in other places / to have more aid: and a little before mydnight
they came to the gate saint Anthoyne / and there they found the provost of the
merchants with the kayes of the gates in his hands. Thanne John^ Mayllart
said to the prouoste / calling him by his name Stephyne what do you here at
this hour: the provost answered (and said) Joha^ne what would ye / I am here
to take heed to the town: whereof I have the gouernynge / by god said John^ ye
shall natte go so. ye are not here at this hour for any good: and that may be
seen by the kayes of the gates that ye have in your hands / I think it be to
betray the town. Quod the provost Johanne ye lie falsely. Nay said Joha^n /
Stephyn thou lie falsely like a treatour / and therewith struck at him / and
said to his company slay the treatours. Than^e every man struck at them: the
provost would a fled / but John^ Mayllart gave him with an are on y^ heed
that he fill down to the yerthe / and yet he was his gossyppe / and left not
till he was slain / and six of them that were there with him: and the other
taken and put in prison. Than^e people began to styre in the streets: and
John^ Mayllart and they of his acorde went to y^ gate saint Honor / and there
they found certain of the prouostes sect / and there they laid treason to
the^: but their excuses auayled nothing. There were diverse taken and send into
diverse places to prison / and such as would not be taken were slain without
mercy. The same night they went and took diverse in their beds / such as were
culpable of the treason: by the confession of such as were taken. The next day
John^ Mayllart assembled the most part of the commons in the markette hall
and there he mounted on a stage: and shewedd generally the cause why he had
slain the prouoste of the merchants. And there: by the counsel of all the
wysmen / all such as were of the sect of the provost were ^^ged to the death /
and so they were executed by diverse tourmentes of death. Thus done John^
Mayllart / who was than^e greatly in the grace of the commons of Paris and
other of his adherentes / send Symonde Mayllart / and two masters of the
parlyament sir Joha^n Alphons and master John^ Pastorell to the duke of
Normandy / being at Charenton. They showed the duke all the matter: and desired
him to come to Paris to aid and to counsel them of the city / fro thens
forth: saying that all his adversaries were deed. The duke said with right
(...) good will: and so he came to Paris / and with him sir Arnolde Dandrehen /
the lord of Roy / and other knights / and he lodged at Lour.

How the king of Nauer defied the realm of France / the king being prisoner in
England. Cap. C.lxxxviii.
When the king of Nauerr knew the trauth of the death of the provost his
great friend / and of other of his sect he was sore displeased: because the
provost had been ever to him right favorable. And by cause the brunt went y^ he
was chief heed of the prouostes treason: so all things consydred / and by the
counsel of the lord Philyp of Nauer his brother / who was there With him at
saint Denice / they detmyned to make war to the realm of France. Than
incontinent he send his defyance to the duke of Normandy / to the parisyence /
and to the hole body of the realm of France. And than he deperted fro saint
Denyce / and his men ouerranne the town at his departing and robbed it / and
also Melynne on the river of Said / where as queen Blanch his sustre was /
sometime wife to king Philyppe. The which lady received him joyfully: and did
put all that the had to his pleasure / and the king of Nauer made of that
town and castle his principal garyson / and retained men of war: almaygnes
/ brabanses / Heynowers / behaignenoyes / and fro every place where he might
get the^. Men were glad to serve him / for he paid largely: he had
enough wherewith of such money as he had get by the aid of the provost of ye
marchantes of them of Paris / and of other towns there about. The lord
Philyyppe of Nauerre went to Maunt / and to Meule^ce on the river of Said /
and there he made his garysons / every day the king of Nauers company
increased. Thus the king of Nauerre and his men began to make war to the
realm of France / and specially to the noble city of Paris. They were
masters of the ryuers of Said / Marne and Doysse: these naueroyse multiplied
in such wise / that they took perforce the strong town of Craell / whereby
they were masters of the river of Doysse: and also they wanne the strong
castle of Hereell / a three leages fro Amyense / and after the wanne
Maucounsell. These three fortresses did after great dysturbaunce to the realm
of France: there were a fyftene hundred that over ran all the country without
any resystence. And anon after they wanne the castle of saint Ualery / where
they made a strong garyson: and there they made sir Wyllyam of Bo^nemare and
John^ of Segures capitayns with five hundred men / and they over ran the
country to Deep to Abbeuyle / and to the ports of Crotoy of Roy / and of
Mutterell. Whan^e the naueroyse hard of a castle or town / though it were
right strong / they made no doutes to get it. Often times they would ride in a
night thyrtie leages / and come into a country where they had no doubt. Thus
they stale and wan castles and fortresses in the realm of France: and sometime
took knights and ladies in their beds and some raunsomed / and fro some took
all that they had: and than put them out of their own houses. They made
captain of the town of Craell the lord Fondregas of Nauer / he gave and
granted saueco^ductes to them that would pass to Paris / to Noyon / or fro
Noyon to Co^paygne / or fro thens to Soyssons: or to Laon / and to other
places. These saueconductes were well worth to him while he lay at Craell / a
hundred thousand frankes / and at the castle of Hereell lay the lord John^
of Piquegny pycarde / who was a good naueroyse: his men constrained sore them
of Mou^tdedyer / of Arras / of Peronne / and of Amyense: and all the country
of Picardy a long the river of Some. In the castle of Mauconsell there were
three hundred men of war / and rabenoyes of Durychars / Franquelyn and
Hannekyn were chief capitayns. They over ran the country about Noyon: all
the great towns of the country that were not closed about Noyon / were
rau^somed to pay every weke a certain sum of floreyns: and also the abbeyes
were feign to do ye same / or else they had been brende and distroyed: they were
so cruel on their ennemys. So by these manner of people the lands were void
and not labored / whereby a great darthe rose in the realm of France.

Of the naueroyse that the Pycardes besieged in the castle of Maucounsell.
Cap. C.lxxxix.
When the duke of Normandy being at Paris knew how these men of war exyled
the country in the tytell of the king of Nauerr / and yt daily they increased.
He sent than^e to all the good towns in Picardy and of Uerma^doyse: desyring
every man acordyng as they might bear / to send certain nombre of men a war
a foot and a horse back to resyst the naueroise / who wasted the realm of
France: whereof he had the chief governance. The cytes and good towns were
glad so to do: and taxed themself as they might bear the wages of certain men
of arms / a foot and a horseback / with archers and crosbowes. And first they
went toward the cite of Noyon / and went straight before the garyson of
Mauco^sell / for they took it for the weakest garyson nauerose / and that most
did hurt to them of Noyon / and of the good country of Uerma^doyse. Of all
these frenchmen was captain the bysshopp^ of Noyon / and with him the lord
Raoll of Cousy / and the lord of Rauenall / the lord of Chaney / ye lord of
Roy / ser Mathue of Roy his brother / and diverse other knights and squyers of
Picar^y and of Uermandoyse / and so they besieged Mauco^sell and made diverse
assautes / and sore constrained them within. Who saw well how they could not
long defend their fortres without some aid: wherefore they send word of their
danger to the lord John^ of Piquegny / who was at Hereell: to whom all other
of their fortresses obeyed. Who when he knew thereof: made great have to go and
conforte his friends at Mauconsell / hesend secretly to them of Craell / that
they should be ready in the seldes at an hour and place appointed for the same:
every man drew to that place. And when they were together: they were in nombre
a thousand spears / and than^e they rode by night as they were gyded / and
came in a morning to Maucounsell. The same morning there was such a mist:
that a man could not se the bredyth of an acre fro him / and than^e suddenly
they dasshed into the french host who was natte war of them / but slept
and had but a small watch: for they thought they mselfe well assured. The
naueroyse began to make their cries: and began^e to slay and beat down
tents and pauylious / and made a great skirmysshe: so that the frenchmen had
no leisure to arm them / but so fled toward Noyon / the which was next
to them: and the naueroyse followed in the chase. There were many slain and
overthrown / between Noyon and Orcans abbey / and between Noyon and the
bysshoppes bridge and there about. The deed men lay on the ground by heaps /
and in the ways / and among hedges and bussbes: the chase endured to the
gates af Noyon. And the city was in great danger to have been lost: for such
as were there of both parties / said that if the naueroyse had list / they
might have entered into the town: for they within were so a frayed / that they
forgate to close their gates toward Comptegne. And the bishop of Noyon was
takenne at the barryers: and there swear to be true prisoner / or else he had been slain. And the same day there was takenne the lord Raoull of Cousey / the
lord Raoll of Rauenall / the lord of Chaunny and his two sons / the Bourge
of Rowmorey / the lord of Turte / the lord of Uendyenll / the lord Anthony
of Coudune / and a hundred knights and squyers: and slain mo thanne fyftene
hundred. And specially of them of the city of Tourney: for there was of them a
great nombre there / some said of seuyn hundred that came thense / there
returned but a few: but outher they were ^^ayne or taken. For they within
Maucounsell also issued out / who ayeded well to that disconfyture / the which
was the year of our lord god a thousand three hundred fyftie and eight: the
wednysday next after the feast of our lady in the mids of the month of
August. The naueroise led the most part of their prisoners to Craell /
because it was a good town and a strong: they wan at that journey great
richesse and good prisoners / whom they rau^somed. And also they raunsomed the
burgesses of Tourney / and of other good towns: some for money / some for
stuff such as they neded: as spear heedes / glaynes / axes / swerdes / cotes
/ doublettes / hoses / and all such other things. And the knights and
squyers were raunsomed for gold and silver / or for good horses: and of a
poor ge^tylman that had nothing to pay / they took their service for a
quarter of a year or a half / or three quarters / as they could agree: as for
wynes and vitaylles they had enough. The plain country delivered theyn
sufficyent: there came nothing to the good towns but by stelth / or else by
sauee co^ducte / the which they sold dear. And in all there save conductes
they ever excepted three things / hattes of Bieuer / eustrydge feathers / and
spear heedes. They of Mauconsell vyolated ye most part of the good abbey of
Orcans / wherewith the captain of Maucounsell was sore displeasedde: the
naueroyse spredde abroad in diverse places / on both sides of the ryuers of
O^s / and Some. There were two men of arms: Raby goyse of Dury / and Robyn le
Scote: they took by scalynge the good town of Barley / where they made a
garyson well fortifyed: they had in wages under them four hundred soudyers
and were paid monthly. Thus they of Berley / of Maucounsell / of Craell / and
of Heree(...) ran over the country where they list: for there were none that
withstode them. The knights of the country had enough to do / to k^^e
their fortresses and houses. So these nauer^^se and englysshmen went and did
what they list: sometime they rode in harneys / and sometime unarmed and sported
them fro fortress to fortress / as though all the country had been in good
rest and peace. The young lord of Coucy / caused his castles to be well kept /
he was as sovereign of all that country. The Chanoyne of Robersart did more
trouble to the naueroyse than any any other / for often times he dystrussed
sum of them.

How certain burgesses of Amyens would a delyuerd the city to the naueroyse
/ and of the great famyne that was than in France. Cap. C.lxxxx.
SO it was that the lord Johanne of Piquegny / who was on the king of Nauers
part / and chief of his counsel: and by whose aid he was delivered out of
prisone. This knight lay and kept the garyson of Hereell three leages fro
Amyense / he did somoche by his subtyltie / wit / and fair language: with
certain burgesses of Amyens of the greattest of the cite / that they should
have sufferedde the naueroyse to enter into the city. And these burgesses
traitors to the city: had secretly in their chambers and loftes / certain
naueroyse that should have ayeded to have dystroyed the city. And in an
evening the lord Johanne of Piquegny / the lord Wyllyam of Granuyll / the
lord Fryquette of Fryquaunt / the lord Lynne of Belastoy / and the lord
Fondegray: and with them a seuyn hundred fighting men came to the gate of
Amyense to wards Hereell / on trust of their friends within the city / and
they found the gate opynne as hit was promised. Thanne such as were hid
within the cite / in chambers and cellers issued out and cried Nauerr: than^e
they of the city awooke and rose and cried treason / and drew to the gate
where the business was / between the boro we and the city. And such as ca^e
first kept the gate: so that there were diverse slain and sore hurt on both
parties / and if the naueroyse had made great haste to have entered as soon as
they came / they had won the city: but they tarried at the borowe and did
there feat cowardely. The same night god enspyredd the lord Morell Fyennes
constable of France / and the earl of saint Poule / who were at Corby with a
great nombre of men of war: they issued out and rode in so great haste /
that they came to the cite by that time the naueroyse had won the borowe and
did their pain to win the city: which they had done / and the coming of
these two said lords had not been. Who as soon as they were entered into the
city by another gate: drue straight to the gate where as the medlyng was / and
displayed their baners: and ordered theymselfe in the street / and issued natte
out of the gate / for they saw well the borowe was but lost without recovery.
These socoures encouraged greatly them of the city / and lyghted up many
torchesse and other fyers. When the lord of Piquegny and his company
understood that these other lords were come to the socour of the city: thanne
they thought they might lose more thanne win: therefore he recreated all his
men as soberly as he might. And so all the naueroyse reculed back and so
wnedde the retreat / but they over ran all the borowe and brende it: wherein
their were well three thousand houses and good lodgings / and parysshe
churches and other: and all were brende nothing sauyd. Thus the naueroyse
returned with great richesse / that they gatte in the borowe of Amyense and
many good prisoners / and so went to their garyso^s. When they were all gone:
the constable of France and the earl of saint Poule / send their companyes to
all the gates of the city / commaundynge the kepars on pain of death / to
suffer no man to issue out of the town: and so they did. In the morning be
times these said to lords with certain of the burgesses / who knew well all
the manner of the city / went to certain burgesses houses / such as they
had in suspect of treasonne. And so took a seuyntene: who were incontinent
beheeded openly in the market place / and specially the abbotte of Gars / who
had consented to this treason: and had lodgedde the most part of the
naueroyse within his house. In like case anon after there was put to death in
the good city of Laone / six of the greattest burgesses of that city: and if
the bysshopp^ there had been taken he had dyed / for he was accused of
treasonne. And he could never after excuse himself: and so secretly departed
/ for he had friends that had shewedd him all the matter. And straight he
went to the king of Nauerre to Melyne on they river of Said / who received
him joyfully. Such fortunesse fill in those days within the realm of France
/ wherefore every lord / and knight / and kepars of towns and castelles kept
ever good watch. And in deed the king of Nauerre had many friends abroad in
the realm: and if that he had not been parceyued be times / he had done
many yuell and myscheuous deeds in the realm: and yet he did enough. All this
season the ou^e of Normandy and his brethren lay at Paris. There were no
marchantes that durst issue out to ride on their business / if there did /
anon they were ouerthorwen which way soever they took / for the realm was so
full of naueroyse / that they were masters of the plain country and of the
ryuers: and of diverse cities and good towns / whereby their fill so dear a
season in France / that a barell of heryng was sold for.xxx. crowns of
gold: and all other things after the rate. The poor people dyed for hunger:
and this season dured more than four year * and specially in y^ good towns of
France: there was no salt to get but at the hands of the duke of Normandyes
officers: and they sold it at their pleasure / to gather thereby money to pay
y^ soudyours wages.

Of the naueroyse that were besieged in saint Ualery by pycardes / and how the
realm was full of naueroyse. Cap. C.lxxxxi.
THe constable of France and the young earl of saint Poule did get them
much thank and praise in the country of Picardy / for socoring of the good
city of Amyense / and all the knights and squyers of Picardy fill into their
company: and there they all toguyder agreed to goo and ley siege to saint
Ualery. The constable send for men to all the good towns and cities of
Picardy: as Tourney / Arras / Lysle / Doway / Bethyne / saint Omers / saint
Quyntyne / Peron / Amyens / Corby / and Abuyle: each of them send a certain
nombre of men to the constable. And many other knights and squyers drew
thither / and specially out of Heynalt: because of such herytages as they held
in France / the lord Dandrehen send thither the young seneshall of Heynault /
the lord John of Uerthyne / and sir Hew Da^toygne his cosynne / and diverse
other. And so they came and laid siege before saint Ualery / they were a two
thousand knights and squyers / and there were a twelfe thousand of commons
send thither from the good towns / at their cost and charge: specially they of
Abuyle were sore charged / for they had the most part of their prouysion fro
thense. This siege endured a long season / and there were many great assautes
and skirmysshes: daily there was ever so^what done of new. The young knights
and squyers of the host often went forth to adventure theymselfe / and often
times they found wherewith / for sir Wyllyam Bonnemare and Johan Segure and
their company / who were within the town / would come to the barryers of their
forteresse and skirmysshe with them without. So that they were hurt and slain
of both parties / they within were a three hundred companyons * beside them of
the town: whom they caused to aid them whyder they would oriat / for fear
of their lives. They of the host caused to be brought thither diverse engyns for
Abbeuyll and Amyense / and caused them to cast great stones / the which
greatly troubled them within. And they within had great plenty of artyllary:
as Canons / Springalles / and other / wherewith they troubled greatly them
without. In the same season while the siege lay thus at saint Uallery / and
that the king of Nauerre warred on all parties of the realm of France. There
arrived at Cherbourge the Captall of Bu^ cosyn to the king of Nauerre / who
had retained him with two hundred spears in wages. As Soon as he was come
into Normandy / he rode to Maunt: and there he found the lord Philyppe of
Nauer / and there tarried certain days. Than secretly he departed withal his
company and rode in a night by the country of Uulgesyne and Beauuoysyne / and
so came to Cleremount / a great town not closed / and a strong castle / and
in the morning the Captall scaledde the forteresse. Howebeit to regard hit the
fortress was inpregnable / yet he wanne hit by scalynge with help of the
archers. And first there entered raumpynge vpp^ like a catte Bernarde de la
Salle / who in his time had scaled diverse forteresses. Than the Capytall and
his company kept that for their garyson a long time after: who traueyled
greatly after the country of Uulgesyn and Beauuosyn / by the aid of the
naueroyse in other fortresses there about as Craell / Hereell / and Mauconsell:
all the country abroad was theirs / none durst mete with them. Thus in every
part was the realm of France warredde in the tytell of the king of Nauer
and there were taken many strong castelles in Bry / in Behaygne / in Ualoyes /
in the bysshopriche of Noyon / of saint Lyz / of Soyssons of Laon / whereof
diverse knights and squyers of diverse countries were capitayns / about Pouns
on the river of Said. And about Prouyns / Troy / Ausser / and Tonnerre: there
was such war / yt none durst issue out of any good town or fortress
between Chalous and Troy in the castle of Beaufort: the which was of the
enherytance of the duke of Lancastre. Capteyn there was sir Peter Audeley / who
over ran all the country there about: also at Pons on the river of Said / and
sometime at Noge^t was the lord Eustace Dambretycourt hanuer * with.v. hundred
with him / who pylled all the country there about: and in Campaygne was
Albrest a squire of Almaygne. These three captayns kept in Champayne and on the
river of Marne / mo than.lx. castelles and strong houses: and whan^ they list
to issue into y^ field they were mo than two thousand fightyng men. They had
all the contre under their subiectyon / and robbed and raunsomed all they
contre: they had robbed and brende the good town of Amery / of Sparney / the
good town of Uertuz / and all the good towns a long the river of Marne / to
the castle of Thyerie / and all about the cite of Reins / and had takenne the
good town of Ronay / and the strong castle of Hans in Champaigne: and all
about to saint Antonys in Partoys. And farthermore in the country of Burgoyne
and of Partoys / there lay Thebault of Cha^fore / and John^ Chanfore / who also
in the tytell of the king of Nauer had taken in the bysshopriche of Laungers a
strong castle called Mountsangon / and therein lay in garyson four hundred
soudyers. And they over ran the country / to the bishop rich of Uerdone:
and toward the country of Soyssons / and between Laon and Raynes there were
another sort / and their sovereign garyson was at Uelly: where there were a six
hundred. And captain of them was Rabygoys of Dury english* who retained
with him all manner of people such as would serve him / he paid the^ so truly
fro term to term / that they were glad to serve him. He had with him another
companyon at his wages called Robynle Stotte: he went and wan in the feast of
christmas the strong castle of Roucy / and all the prouisyon therein and
robbed the town: and made of the town and castle a garyson / the which
afterward did much hurt to the country there about. And he rau^somed the earl
/ his wife / and his children there: at.xii. thousand floreyns of gold / of
the print of the mutton / and he kept the town and castle all the winter. And
the somer after: which was the year of our lord. M. CCC.lix. And whatie therle
of Roucy had paid his ransom he went to Laone / and where him list. In this
season there was no labourynge of the yerth / whereby great darth was after in
the realm.

Of the naueroyse that the chanoyn of Robersart disconfyted in Lannoys nere to
the town of Craull. Cap. C.lxxxxii.
IN the same season as I was enfourmed: there fill to the lord Chanoyn of
Robersart a fair adventure. It so fortuned on a day: y^ lord of Pynon a
baneret of Uermandoyes rode with a threscore with him / fro one french
fortress to a another. And the same day it hapenyd: that certain of the garyson
of Uylly / and of the garyson of Roucy rode forth at adventure somewhat to win /
but their capitayns were not with them. They were a three hundred companyons
together / and nere to the town of Craull / they saw where y^ lord of Pynon
rode under his sta^derd in good order / and was in the way toward Craull.
Anon they perceived that they were frenchmen: and y^ lord of Pynon saw well
how they were naueroyse / and saw how he could nattescape without battle.
Than they coosted toward Craull: but the naueroyse had cut their way / and
when they saw that they fled to save themself as well as they might. The
naueroyse followed fast after cryeng saint George Nauer: they were better horsed
than the frenchemen / so that they ouertoke them within half a leage ridynge.
Than the lord of Pynon perceived a great pytte large and deep / closed about
with a strong hedge: and but one little streyt place to enter into it. When he
saw the advantage thereof: and that he could fly no farther / he said to his
company / sirs a foot quickly: it is better for us to abide here the adventure
that god w^ll send us and to defend ourselfe / rather than to be slain or
taken fleyng: than he alyghted and all his. when the naueroyse saw that: they
in likewise a lyghted a foot / there was a squire with the lord of Pynon that
said to his varlet / leap upon my courser and spare him not: and ride to the
garrison of Pyer pount / and desire the Chanon of Robersart to come in all have
to rescue us (the varlet said) though I find him there: how is it possible
that he should come hyder in time for he is hense five leages / well said the
squyet yet do thy deuoyre. Than the verlet rode forth and left his master
feersly assailed with these pyllers of Uelly / and Roucy: the lord of Pynon
and his company defended themself by great virtue / and kept them in the
advantage of the pytte / fro the morning till it was non / without any
dysconfeture. Now let us speak of the varlet / who rode in greathast to Pyer
pount in La^noyes: and there did his message to the Canoyne of Robersart / who
answered y^ he would do his deuoyre to ride to the same place / where the lord
of Pynon was fightyng: for he said he knew the place well. Than^e he sowned
his trumpet: and he and his company mounted on their horses to the nombre of
sixscore / and also he send a varlet of his to Laon / the which was not far
thense to the captain there / to inform him of the matter. Howebeithe would not
tarry for them of Laon / but rode forth a great galopp till he found the lord
of Pynon and his company sore traueyled with the naueroyse: so that he could
not long have endured without rescewe. Incontinent the Chanoyne of Robarsert
laid his spear in the rest and dasshed in among the naueroyse / and he
ouerthrewe three at the first coming: and his men who were fresshe and lusty /
anon put abacke the naueroyse / who were weary fightyng all the day. The
Chanoyne of Robersart gave such strokes with his axe / y^ none durst abide
him: So there were (...)ayne in that place of these pyllers mothan a hundred
and.l. and such as escaped fro thense were met withal by them of Laon / who
were coming thither to the same rescue. And there a great part of the
naueroyse were s^ayne: so that of three hundred / there escaped but fyftene
persons: for they were other slain or taken.

Of the naueroyse that yielded up saint Uallery to the frenchmen / after they
had been long besieged. Cap. C.lxxxxiii.
THis as I have showed here before: the lords of Pycardy / Arthoyes / Ponthieu
/ and Bolonoyes: lay a great season at siege before saint Ualery / and made
many assautes with engyns and other instruments of war. And among other
adventures it fell so / that the lord of Bauceen pycarde went upon these
aprochyng the castle the better to advise it / and there he was stricken with a
spring all and slain. They within had great plenty of artyllary: so that they
without could make none assaut without great damage. The siege endured fro the
beginning of August / till it was lent: the lords without thought to famyssh
them within / seeing they could not get them by assaut. All the straytes and
passages were well watched / so that nothing could come to them within: another
by water nor by land. The prouysion within began sore to mynisshe / and they
durst not issue out to go a foragynge: and also they could another se nor here
of any socour / than they counsayled together and detmyned to treat with the
constable / and the earl of saint Poule: that they might depart and yield up
the fortres / their lives and good saved / and to go whyder they list. This
treaty was agreed: saving they should depart without any harneys / the which
the earl of saint Powle was loathe unto / for he would have had them symply. The
same season was coming to saint Ualerys ward the lord Philyppe of Nauer to
have raised the siege: at the leest he would have done his power thereto. And
they of saint Uallery had not given up their fortress so soon / wherewith
the lord Philyppe was sore dyspleased / but he coudenatte a mende it as than.

How the lord Philypp^ of Nauer raised up a three thousand naueroyse to have
raised the siege before saint Uallery. Cap. C.lxxxxiiii.
THe french lords were still in the field araynged on the point of their
departing / trussyng up te^tes and pauylions / and dystoging And than suddenly
they herd tidings how the lord Philypp^ of Nauer / who go uerned all the
lands under the king of Nauer his brother: and specially the lands of the
cou^tie of Eureur / and to him obeyed all manner of men of war / such as made
war into the realm of France. The lord John^ of Piquegny had enfourmed him
how they of saint Ualely were lykely to give up their fortress. Than the
lord Philypp^ took courage to go and reyse the liege there: and secretly he
gathered together about Maunt and Meulence / a three thousand men one and other
and with him was the young earl of Harecourt / the lord of Granuyll / sir
Robert Canoll sir John^ Piquegny / and diverse other knights and squiers. And
all these were come within three leages of saint Uallery / the same time that it
was given up: they knew ye trauth thereof by sir Wylliam Bo^nemare and Johan
Segure: whom they met in the way. And when the frenchmen that had taken the
possession of saint Ualery understood the coming of the lord Philyppe of
Nauer: than they drue into the field and took counsel to gyder / the
constable of France / the earl of saint Poule / the lord of Chastellon / the
lord of Poyx / the lord of Beausault / the lord of Helley / the lord of
Crestkes / the lord Edward of Rency / the lord Baudwyn Denekyn / and diverse
other lords and knights that were there. There they agreed to go and to fight
with their enemies / than was it commanded by the constable that every man in
array / should march toward their enemies: than every man rode in good order
thiderwarde / but when the naueroyse understood that the frenchmen were coming
on the^ / with mo than.xxx. thousand. They were not than in purpose to abide
them: but so passed the river of Some as soon as they might / and entered in / to
the castle of Long in Ponthieu / horse and harneys / and all that they had.
They were scant entered / but that the frenchmen came thither / who followed them:
this was about the hour of even song / and still their nombre increased. The
commons came after of the good to wnes of Picardy: they could not come thither
so soon as the men of arms did: than the french lords determined to lodge
there all that night / and to a bide for their me^ that came after / and the
next day to make assaute: and so lodged there. The naueroyse who were within
with a small prouysion / about the hour of mydnight they issued out at a
back posterne without any noise / and took the way to Uermandoyse / and were
gone a two leages or the frenchmen knew thereof / than they armed them and
followed the naueroyse by the trake of their horses. Thus the naueroyse rode
before and the frenchmen after / at last the naueroyse ca^e to Thorigny
alytell vyllage sta^dyng on a hill / where they might se all the country
about: and it stood a side / half between saint ^uyntyns / and Peron in
Uermandoyse there the naueroise rested to refresshe them and their horses. And
if they should needs fight / there they had a great advantage to abide their
enemies: they had not long rested there / but all the country by neth was
covered with the frenchmen they were mo than.xxx. thousand. When the naueroyse
sa we them / they made the^ ready to fight with them: and issued out of their
lodgings and made three batayls. The lord Robert Canoll had the first / the
second the lord Philypp^ of Nauer / the third therle of Harecort. And in
every battle a seuyn hundred: and every man did cut their spears to a five
foot long / and in the hangyng of the hill they caused their varlettes to
set all their spurs in the earth ye rowels up ward: to the intent that
their enemies should not easily aproche nere them / and there the lord
Philyppe of Nauerr made the young earl of Harcourt knight / and the young lord
of Granuyll. The frenchmen rested before the naueroyse and lyghted a foot /
some would incontinent have gone and fought with the^ / and some said our men
besore traueyled and many be behind. It were good that we tarried for them /
and let us lodge here this night / anon it woll be late: to morrow we may
fight with the^ more ordinately. Thus the frenchemen lodged there that night
and set their caryage round about them: and when the naueroyse sa we that
they should natte be fought withal that night / in the euenyng they went into
the vyllage of Thoringny / and made great fyers and smokes / to make their
enemies believe yt they would lodge there all that night: but as soon as it was
dark night they had their horses ready / and were detmyned what they would do /
and when it was dark privily they departed and went to ye river of Some: and
passed by a gyde at a little vyllage nere to Bethencourt. And than they rode
toward the wood of Bohaygne and coosted the same / and rode that night more
than^e seuyn leages: some that were yuell horsed were far behind / and they
of the garyson of Bouhayne took them prisoners. Also the vyllayns of the
country slew some of the^ / such as could not follow their masters and had
lost their way: the frenchmen knew not of their departing till it was nere day
light and so in have they passed the river of Some at the bridge of saint
^uintyne / and went toward Lyceuce to aproche to the naueroyse. Soeche of
them made haste to ward saint ^uyntyus / and came thither by that it was day
light: for it was thense but two leages. Formast was the constable / and the
earl of saint Poule: the watchmen on the gates of saint ^uityne / wha^ they
herd that noise without / and knew that their enemies were natre far
lodged thense. Than they were not well assured of themself: but their bridge
was up / than they demanded sirs what be ye that aproch so nere us this time
of night. The constable answered (and said) we be such and such: that would
pass by this town to get before the naueroyse / who arstollen out of
Thorigny and arre fled before us / wherefore opyn your gates we command you
in the name of the king. The watchmen said sirs: the kayes be within the town
with the iurates / and so than two of the watchmen went into the town to them
that kept the kayes and showed them the matter. And they answered that there
should no gate be opyned without the consent of the hole town / and or the
minds of them were known the son was up. Than there came to the gate such
as should give answer for all the hole town: they went up to the walls of
the gate and put out their heedes and said to the constable / and to the earl
of saint Poule. Sirs we desire you have us excused for this time: it is the
mind of all the commons of this town / that five or six of you shall enter
if it please you / to do you honor and pleasure: but the resydue to go where
they list. Than these lords were dyspleased: and gave great and dispytfull
words / but for all that they of saint Nuyatyns would not opyn their gates.
Than these french lords thought it auayled not to pursue the naueroyse any
farther: than they all departed by license of the constable. And the earl of
saint Poule went to his castle of Bohaygne: soosore dyspleased that none durst
speak to him.

Of the naueroyse that sir Peter Audeley brought on a night to have taken the
city of Chalons. Cap. C.lxxxxv.
THus departed this iurney between the frenchemen and the naueroyse: the lord
Philyppe of Nauer and his company / rode the same day to Wylly and passed by a
guy / de the river of Oyse: than^e they refresshed them. When they saw they
were out of all perels / and at their pleasure: they rode into Normandy and rode
fro fortress to fortreg for they were masters of the ryuers / and plain
country. And so entered again into Constantyne / and made war as they did
before in Normandy: also the king of Nauer was at Melyn on the river of Said
with a great nombre of men of war. So it fill that sir Peter Audeley captain
of Beaufort / between Troy and Calons cast his aduyce / that if he might pass
the river of Marue a little above ye town of Chalons / and so come to thabbey
of saint Peter / he should lightly enter into the town. So he tarried on that
purpose till the river of Marne was Iowe: than he assembled toguyder secretly
certain companyons / for their were of his part a five or sire fortress
about him. So he was a four hundred sightyng men: and departed fro Beaufort
at mydnight and brought them to the passage over the river of Marne / he had
men of the country that brought him thither / there they lighted a foot and
delyuerd their horses to their varlettes and so went over the water: which was
as than but Iowe. And when they were all over / they went fair and easily
toward the abbey of saint Pet: ye watchmen there were abroad in the town such
as were next to the abbey / the which was without the town: herd clearly the
redoundyng of the naueroyse / for as they went their harneys clateredd and made
some noise. So that such as herd that noise had marvel what it meant: for
sometime ye noise seaced / that was when the naueroyse stood still and rested.
And when they went forth again the noise began / the wind was on that side:
than some of the watchmensayd / by likelyhode there besome theuys english and
nauerose ar coming to steal this town. Let us ascry them and wake the men of
the city be times / and some went toward the abbey to se what it was / they
could not so sone do it / but that sir Peter Audeley and his company were in
the abbey court: for the walls thereof past not four foot of hight.
Incontinent they went out at the abbey gate and entered into a great street:
they of the city were sore a frayed / for they cried in every part treason
trea son alarm. Than the men of the city armed them and assembled together and
came toward then enemies and diverse of them were slain at the first coming.
It fell so yuell for the town of Chalons / that Peter of Chalons who had been
captain there the space of a hole year and a hundred spears with him was
newly departed thense because he was not paid of his wages at his pleasure.
They of the city, who were a great nombre of commons rose on every side and
feersly put themself in defense / the which was needful for them to do.
Nowbeit they lost many men / for the naueroyse wan the first to w^e to the
bridge over Marne: and beyond the bridge they of the city assembled together /
and defended the first bridge / there was a sore fray. Certain english
archers passed over the gy^^es of the bridge / and shot so feersly that none
durst come within their shot: this skirmysshe endured till it was noone / and
some said that the city had been woune / and sir Does of Graucy had not been /
who had knoledge the day before of the ryding for the of the naueroyse of
Beaufort: And so he fearedd the city of Chalous / wherefore he desired diverse
knights and squiers to go with him for he knew well in the city of Chalons /
there was no ge^tylman of name So he rode day and night / and with him sir
Philypp^ of Jancourt / the lord Au^eau of Beaupre / the lord John Guermyllon
/ and diverse other / to the nombre of threscore speres. As Soon as they came to
Chalons / they drue straight to the bridge / which they of the town defended a
/ gayust the naueroyse: who did all their pain to win the town. Than the
lord of Grancy displayed his banner and with great desire aproched to the
naueroyse.

How the earl of Roucy was taken again the second time. Cap. C.lxxxxvi.
OF the coming of the lord of Grancy they of Chalons were greatly reioysed /
and good cause why: for and his confort and aid had not ben they had been hard
bestade. Wha^ sir Peter Audeley and his men saw these burgonyons they withdrue
them the same way they came / and they found at the river side their barlettes
with their horses. Than^e they mounted and passed the river of Marne without
any let / and so retoured with a small conquest to Beaufort: of their deptyng
they of Chalons were right glad / and than / ked god thereof / and the lord
of Grancy of the courtesly that he had showed them / and gave to him and his
company five hundred frankes / and desired sir John^ Sars who was there present
and their neighbor to abide there with them / to counsel and defend them. He
agreed thereto with certain wages that he should have for himself and his
company / and so he newly for tifyed the cytic where it neded / at the charges
of them of the town. In the same season they of the garysons of Uelly and
Roucy met by apoyntment together / and went and took by assaut the town of
Syssome / and there they made a garyson of all manner of people / and made
captain there Hanekyn Francoys / alewdefelowe of Colayne on the river of
Ryne. He was cruel in all his deeds / for he had no mercy of the^ that he he
over came. He brent the country there about: and slew men / women / and
children / if they were not raunsomed at his pleasure. So it fill that therle
of Roucy / who bare sore at his heart the loss of his town and castle of
Roucy / the which the naueroise had taken fro him. On a season he so desired
the knights and squiers about him / that he had a hundred spears with forty
men a horseback out of the cite of Laon: with him was the earl of Porcien /
the lord Robert of Canency / the lord of Montegny in Ostrenant and other.
They rode toward Syssome: and in their way they found the naueroise of the
same garyson / brennyng of a byllage. Incontinent they set on them: when
Hanekyn and his company saw that / they lighted a foot / and set their
archers before them / there was a sore and a hard battle: but they of Laon
returned to their city and did no good / and the other frenchmen abode and
fought long. How beit the journey was not for them: there the earl of Roucy
was sore hurt and takyn prisoner / also there was taken the lord Gerarde of
Canency / and the lord of Mo^tegny / and diverse other men of arms. Thus the
earl of Roucy was twyse takefie in less space than a year: the lord Eustace
Dambretycourt in the same season held in Champayne a seuyn hundred fightyng
men: he wanne great richesse there in rau^somyng of men in Uendages / in to
w(...) / (...) les / and saucco^^cles. He held under him (...) twelfe
fortresses: he was as than a lully lover ^abper;amors / and after he married
the lady Isabell of Jullyers / sometime boughter to therle of Jullyers. This
lady also loved the lord (...)ace / for the great noblenes of arms y^ she had
herd reported of him: and she send often times to him coursers and hackeneys
with letters of love / whereby the said sir Eustace was the more har^y in all
his deeds of arms / so that every man ^an greatly that was under him.

Of the three queen's / and the naueroise that were besiged by the duke of
Normandy in Melune. Cap. C.lxxxxvii.
AFter the yeldyng up of saint ^alery as ye have herd before: the duke of
Normandy assembled together a three thousand spears / and departed fro Paris
and went and laid siege before Melune on the river of Said / y^ which was
kept by the naueroyse. Within the same town there were three queen's: the first
queen Jane aunt to the king of Nauer / sometime wife to king Charles of France.
The second queen Blanch / sometime wife to king Philyppe of France / and
suster to the king of Nauerr. The th^r^e the queen of Nauer / suster to the
duke of Norman / die: the which duke was not at the siege himself but he send
thither the lord Morell of Fye^nes constable of France / the earl of saint
Poule / the lord Arnold Da^drehen marshall of France the lord Arnold of Coucy
/ the bysthop of Troy the lord Broquart of Fenastrages / Peter du Bare /
Philyppe of Armoyes and other / to the nombre of three thousand spears: who
bes(...) Melune round about. And they brought fro Paris many engyns and
springalles / the which night and day did cast into the sortres: and also they
made diverse sore assautes. The naueroyse within were sore abashed / and
specially the three queen's: who would glably that y^ siege had been raised /
they cared not ho^^e. But the captayns: the lord John^ Pypes / and y^ lord
Joha^n Carbenauxe said to them / sayre ladies bismay you not / for one of these
dayesye^hall se the siegereysed. For the king of Nauerre has send us word
who is at Uernon / and also sir Philyp of Nauer his brother: how they have
raised a certain company of men of war at Maunt and at Meleux to reyse this
siege. And also all the men of war of all the garysons naueroyse woll come
with them / ou the other part the duke of Normandy who knew that the naueroyse
were about to reyse the siege: rerayned soudyours on all parties / and ever did
send the^ to the siege of Melune. Than there were certain good people y^ besyed
them self to have a peace between the king of Nauerr / and the duke of
Normandy: and as than was still in France the cardynall of Piergourt and the
cardynall of Angel / and they with other did somoche that a day was taken of
trewse / to be holden at Uernon. And thither came the duke of Normandy and his
counsel: and the king of Nauer and the lord Philyppe his brother and their
counsaylles / and there a peace was made / and the king of Nauer swear to be
good french / and in the same peace were comprised a three hundred knights and
squyers / to whom the duke per doned his yuell will: yet the duke excepted
certain other to whom he would give no per don. To this peace the lord
Philyppe of Nauer would in nowyse agree: but said to the king his brother ho we
he was enchau^ted / and did sore against the king of England / to whom he was
a lied. The which king had always aided and conforted him / and so the lord
Philyppe departed fro his brother / all only with four persons / and rode in
have to saint Savior le Uycont / the which was a garyson english. And
captain there under the king of England was sir Thomas Agorne of England /
who received the lord Philyp joyfully / and said how he had aquyted himself
trewely to the king of England.

How the broquart of Fenestrages and other frenchmen ordained their bataylles
/ against the lord Eustace Dambretycourt english in Champaigne. Cap.
C.lxxxxviii.
BY the treaty of this peace the king of Nauer had certain towns and castles
in Normandy in peace / the which before were in debate and specially Mant and
Meulencke. Also there was a peace made between the duke of Normandy and the young
earl of Harcourt / a great part by the means of the lord Loyes of Harecourt /
who was of the dukes counsel and of his house. And the duke gave to the same
earl in mary age y^ daughter of the duke of Burbone / suster to the duches of
Normandy. Thus the siege brake up before Melune and the town abode french:
yet for all this peace / the realm of France was invaded / a great war made
therein / asmoche as was before or more: for as than the truse between England
and France was expyred. So such men of war / as before had made war in
the iytell of the king of Nauer in France in Normandy / in Burgone / in
Picardy / in Champaigne / in Brey / and in Beaufe. Than they made again as
great war in the tytell of the king of England: for all the peace / there was
no fortress that would turn french / for the companyons and men of war
had learned so well to rob and pyll the country / and to ransom the
people that they could not leave: for of two thousand that had a ten or twelfe
horses of their own / if they would have made no more war / in a short time
should have been feign to have gone a foot. After the breaking up of the siege
at Melune: the duke of Normandy desired the lord Broquart of Fenestrages who
was of the nacyon of Lorayne / and had with him in wages a five hundred
co^panyons / that he would help to drive out of Champaygne the englysshmen /
such as made daily war in that country. He agreed thereto with a certain
sum of florens that he should* have for him and his men. Than there assembled
together men of war: of Cha^paigne / of Burgoyne / the bishop of Troy /
therle of Uadumont / the earl of Jouy / the lord Joha^n Chalon / and the lord
Broquart of Fenestrages / they were a two thousand spears / and.xv. C. of
other. And so they ca^e to the strong castle of Hans in Champaigne / the
which the englysshmen had kept a year and a half / they took it at the third
assaut / and there were slain a.lxxx. englysshemen / none were take to mercy.
Than the frenchmen went to the city of Troy and when they were well refresshed
/ there issued out a twelfe hundred spears / and nine hundred of other / and
tode toward Nogent on the river of Said. The lord Dambrety court / who
understood of their ryding abroad / assembled of the garysons under his rule a
four hundred spears / and a two hundred archers: and with them departed fro
Pons. He rode clean armed except his heed peace / and rode on a hackeney / and
a great courser was led by him: he had not ryden far / but that he herd
tidings of the frenchmen / and in likewise the frenchmen herd of them. But if
the lord Eustace had known / that the frenchmen had been so great a nombre: he
would a desired the lord Peter Audeley and Albreth to have aided him / they
might well a made a four hundred men. Than the lord Eustace gathered together
his men without y^ town of Nogent / and took the hight of a little hill among
the vynes: and set his archers before him. And when the frenchemen came nere
and saw them: they ordained three bataylles. The first governed the bishop
of Troy / and the lord Broquart of Fenestrages: and the second the lord John^
of Chalon / and the earl of Jouy: and the third the earl of Januyll. Than sir
Eustace among his men said: sits let us fight with a good courage / this
journey shall be ours than shall we be lords of all Champaigne / the which
sometime was an erldome. I may do the king of England such service whom I
repute to be king of France / that he woll give me this erldome. Than he called
to him certain young squyers: as the couragyous Manny his cosyn / Joha^n of
Paris / Martyne of Spaygne / and other / and there he made them knights / and
made all his men to light a foot and to cut their spears a five foot long: and
set his penon before him / the which was of ermyns / two hameddes goules.

Of the battle of Nogent bytwen the lord Broquart of Fenestrages of the
nacyon of Lorayne / of the french party. And sir Eustace Dambreti* court of
the nacyon of Heynalt / of the english party. Cap. C. lxxx xix.
When ser Broquart of Fenestrages (who was hardy and couragiouse) saw yt sir
Eustace would not remove his batel he said let us set on them what soever
fall / and so advanced his bataile / and sir Eustace received so the first
bataile / that he overthrew of his ennemies mo than.lx. and had nere hand
clean discomfitted the same bataile / but than the.ii. fresshe bataile aproched
which greatly aided and comforted the first. Tha^ ye third bataile came on a
wynge / and comforted the other.ii. batailes. The french men were.iii. against
one. Sir Eustace with his glayue over threw a.iiii. of the herdiest of his
enemies. When ser Broquart saw his prowes / he struck at him over other
men's heedes / and struck / him in the viser / and struck out with the stroke
three of his tethe / but for all that he let not to fight. The englisshemen
had the vauntage of the hill / and held them self so cloose together that
none could enter into them / the frencheme^ were a horsbacke / and the
englisshemen a foot / and a littel beside were the english archers a part by
themself / and shot quyckely at ye fre^chemen. The frenchemen turned about the
englissheme^ / and as they turned / they did ye same Than the french fortemen
came into the field a ix. C. of them / who had pauesses / a thereby they brake
ye array of the archers / for their shot coud not hurt them / they were so sure
pa^essed. Tha^ the archers were sore beten / and the second bataile of ye
frencheme^ came on them a horse back and slew many of them / and than they
went on them that kept the english horses / and slew and wanne them all /
but few that escaped. In the mean season the other two batailes fought with
the englisshemen on the one side / and the fotemen on the other side / So that
finally they brake their array / and sir Eustace standderde was beaten down /
and all to torn / and many men slain and taken. Sir Eustace fell in the
hands of a knight / called sir Henry Quenelart and he had great pain to save
his lyse / for the commons of Troy would have slain him / for the great deeds
of arms / that he had done in the country of Champaygne. There was also taken
sir Johan of Paris / the lord Martine of Spaygne / and diverse other knights
and squyers. And such as saved them self / entered into the fortress of
Nogent / The which were but a few / for they were nere all slain or taken /
and the coragious Manny was left for deed in the field among the deed men. But
after this discomfytture / and that all the frenchemen were departed / he
being sore hurt and nere deed lift up a litel his heed and saw nothing
about him / but deed men lyeng on the ground round about him: than he rose
as well as he might and satte down / and saw well how he was not far from
the fortress of Nogent / the which was englisshe / than he did so much
sometime crepyng / and sometime resting / that he came to the foot of the
tower of Nogent. Than he made token to them within showing how he was one of
their companyons / than certain came down ye tower to him and bare him into
the Forteresse / and dressed his wounds. And therehe governed him self so
well / that he was heeled. This bataile was in the year of our lord a. M.
CCC.lix. In the vigill of saint John^ Baptist.

How these robbors and pyllers that kept these fortresses in France began to
declyne by miracle. Cap. CC.
AFter this dyscomfetture of Nogent on ye river of Seyn the lords and men of
arms of France went to Troy with their boty and conquest / but they brought
theder non^ of their prisoners. They sent them to other french garysons: for
the como^s of Troy would have slain them. When such as Were still in the
garyson of Pouns understood how that their captain the lord Eustace was
taken / and all his company slain and taken / they trussed all that they had
as shortly as they might and departed / because they were but a few. In like
wise so did they of Torey of Esponay / of Arcy / of Mary / of Pleusy / and of
all other fortresses that were under the obeysaunce of the lord Eustace
Dambreticourt. And they left them void / for doubt they had of the bishop of
Troy / And of the lord Broquarte of Fenestrages. but sir Peter Aubeley left
not his garyson of Beauforte. Nor John^ of Segure Nogente. Nor Albret the
garyson of Gey / on the river of Seyne. In the same season dyed strangely in
the castle of Herreell a.iii. leages from Amiense the lord Johan of Piquygny
(as it was said) he was stra^gled by his chamberlayn. And in like manner dyed
sir Lucz of Bekusey / who was of his counsel.

In the same season on a day / certain of the company of sir Peter Audeleys
rode forth / and entered into a town called Ronay / and robbed it clean: and as
the curate was at mass there entered into the church an englisshe squier and
took the Chalays fro the altar / wherein the pressed should have consecrated /
and did cast out the wine / and because the priest spoke to him / he struck
him with his gauntlet / that the bludde fell upon the altar. Than they
departed and went into the feldes: and this squier had with him the patent and
corporal / and suddenly his horse began to turn and so to take on that none
durst approach nere him / and horse and man fell to the earth / and each of
them strangled other / and suddenly were turned into powder Than the other
companions made a vow never after to violate any church. In the same season
they of the garrison of Mauconsell wanted prouysion / and so sold their
fortress to them of Noyon / and to them of the country there about / for.xii.
M. motons of gold / and so to depart with all their goods. And so they went
into other fortresses / as to Craell / Cleremount Hereell / Uelly / Pierpount /
Roussey / and to Sissome. The which fortresses had been long in the hands of
Naueroys / and after the peace bitwene the duke of Normandy / and the king of
Nauer / they were englysse. And when they of Noyon had Mauco^sel / they rasshed
it to the earth. Also John^ Segure sold the fortress of Nogent to the bishop
of Troyes for a certain some of florens / whereof he had writing under the
bishops seal / and so he came into ye cite of Troy / and alyghted at the
bishop lodging who said to him / ser John^ ye shall abide here with me a three
or four days / and than ye shall have your money. and he / who was come
thither under the assurance of the bishop / agreed thereto. Than the commons of
the cite began to say / How does our bishop tryfle and mock us / sithe
he keeps about him the greattest brybour and robber in all France / and
would that we should give him our money. Than there rose a great no^bre of the
same opinion / and sent to keep their gates / that he should not skape them /
and there came in harneys a six thousand of one sort to slay him in the
bishops lodging. When the bishop saw that / he said to them / Fair
friends he is come hither under my save conducte and ye know the treatye and
bargayne between him and me by your accord / hit were great shame and untruth
(under this assurance) to do him any villanye. But what so ever he said they
entered into his halle by force / and so into his chamber / and sought so naro
welye that at last they found him / and there slew him / and hewed him all
to pieces.

How the frenchemen refused the peace that their king made in England, Cap.
CC.i.
IT is long sithe I spoke of the king of England / but I had non^ occasion
to speak of him till now. for as long as the treuce endured / there was no
war^ made bitwene them / but as soon as y^ truce was exspired / the first day
of May / the year of our lord. M. CCC.lix. after that day all the garysons
englisshe and naueroyse made war in the title of the king of England. Anon
after the peace made between the king of Nauer and the duke of Normandy. The
lord Arnolde Dandrehen returned into England / for he was not quytte
prisoner of his taking at the battle of Poieters. In the same season the king
of England and the prince his son The French ^ynge / and the lord Jaques
of Bourbon / met at London / and so they four allonely to guether in
counsel agreed upon a peace upon certain articles written in a lettre to be
sent into France to the duke of Normandy. The Earl and sir Arnolde passed the sea and arrived at Boloyn / and so went to Paris / And there they found the
Duke / and the king of Nauer / and there showed them the letters. Than the duke
demanded counsel of the king of Nauer / who did counsel him that the
prelattes and nobles of France / and counsayles of the good towns should be
assembled / the which thing was done. And than it seemed to the king of Nauer
/ and to the Duke / and to his brethren / and to all the counsel of the
Realm / that the said treatye was to grievous to be borne. Wherefore they
answered all with one voice to the said two fordes / that the letter that they
had brought and the^^ect therein / was so preiudyciall to them am* to the realm
/ that they yet would endure greatter myschiefe than they had done: rather than
to mynisshe in such wise the realm of France. They would also rather suffer
their king to lie still in England. And when the french king understood how
the realm of France would not agree to his apoyntme^t (he said) a son
Charles: ye be cou^sayled by the king of Nauerre / who deceyueth you / and woll
deceive such.xl. as ye be. And wha^ the king of England knew their report he
said well: or winter be past I shall enter into the realm of France so
puysantly (...) shall abide there so long till I have an end of this war /
or else peace at my pleasure / and to mine honor: and than he made the grettest
aparayle that ever he made. The same season about the mids of August the
lord Joha^n of Craon archbysshop of Reins: and they of the city of Paris /
and of the country there about: with a certain knights and squiers of the
county of ^ethell and Laon / went and laid siege to the castle of ^oucy and
there lay a five wekes. And than they with in yielded up their lives and goods
saved: and to go whyder they list. And of this they had letters patentes sealed
by the archebysshop / by the earl Porcyen / and the earl of Brain: but for all
that when they departed the commons that were there rose against them and slew
the most part for all the lords / who had much pain to save the captain
Hanekyn Francoyse. Thus therle of Roucy had again his town and castle.

How sir Eustace Danbretycour^ was delyuerd out of prison by great ransom.
Cap. CC.ii.
THus after the wynninge of the castle of Roucy / sir Peter Awdeley dyed in
his bed within y^ castle of Beauforde: whereof such companyons as were under
him were right sorrowful. Than the englysshmen and almaygnes there / thought
they could do no better sith they made war for the king of England / as to
make to their captain sir Eustace Dambreticourt / who was as than^e hole of
his hurtes: but still as prisonere. Than they send Faucon the haraulde to
therle of Uandumant / and to sir Henry ^ue^ellart / for to put to ransom
the lord sir Eustace / so than he was put to his fynanse to pay.xxii.
thousand frankes of France. And the companyons of the english garysons in
Champaigne paid the said ransom: and so he was delivered and had again his
courser and his hackeney / that he lost at the battle of Nogent / the which
horses the lady Isabell of Jullyers countess of Kent in England had send
him. When these co^panyons had the lord Eustace among them / they made him
their sovereign / and every man drew to him. And than they entered into the
cou^tie of Rethell where they had never been before / and there by stelth they
wanne the good town of Athyen on the river of Esue: and there they found mo
than a hundred pieces of wine. There they made their soueraygne garyson / and
over ran all the country about Reins / and spoiled Espernoy / Damp^ary /
Trayone / and the good town of Uertus: where the englysshmen had great
profette. And there they made another garyson / the which over ran all the
country about the river of Marne to the Fertyll Myllon. And they of Athyen
ran daily to Meserees on the river of Meuse / to Douchery / and to Chenpoulux.

How sir Broquart of Fenestrages made himself to be paid by force of his
wages / of the duke of Normandy regent of France. Ca. C C iii.
IN the same season the lord Broquart of Fenestrages / who had been in the
dukes aid against the^glyssheme^ and naueroyse: and had helped to put them out
of y^ fortresses in Champaygne / but he was but yuell paid of his wages. There
was owing to him and to his a thyrtie thousand frankes. He send certain
messangers to Paris to the duke / who gave none answer to his pleasure / for
they retourned^ without any money or promise. Than this knight send his
defyance to the duke and to all the realm of France: and entered into a good
town called Bare on the river of Said / wherein there were a nine hundred houses
/ his men robbed y^ town: but they could not get the castle it was so well
kept. They took with thyem their pyllage and prisoners / and brende so the
town that all was distroyed: than they went to Co^stans and there made their
chief garyson / and they did after to the country of Champaigne / more yuell
and vylayne deeds / than ever did the englysshemen or naueroyse. And when he
and his men had thus over run the country / the duke agreed with him and he
had all that he desired and more. And than he departed and went into Lorayne
fro whens as he came: and so left the realm of France and the country of
Champaine in peace when he had done yuels ynowe. In the same season the year of
our lord god a. M. CCC. li^. Sir Robert Canoll made a journey with three
thousand one and other: and went out of the marchesse of Bretaygne / and rode
along the river of Loyre and entered into Berry brennyng and exylyng the
country. And it was said he had taken on him to pass through Auuergne / to go
se the pope and cardynalles at Auygnone / and to have some of their floring
as well as the archpreest had done.

Of the journey that sir Robert Canoll made in Berry and Auuergne / and of the
lords and gentylmen of the country that pursued him. Cap. CC.iiii.
Such lords and knights of Auuergne with their co^panyes / as were in
purpose to encountre sir Robert Canoell came within a days journey of him with
a three thousand spears. Sir Robert had ryden in Berry brenning and exilyng
the country and as than he was entered into Auuergne / and to resyst him / the
lords and knights were assembled. They of Auuerne and Lymosen: and with them
therle of Forestes / who had with him a.iiii. C. spears. Thus they rode after
sir Robert Canoll and his men / such as he had brought with him out of
Loritaygne / calling themself englysshmen. When these lord were thus within a
days journey of their enemies / and there lodged that night. And the next day
they came and lodged on a mountain nere to thenglysshmen / and they were
lodged on a another little hill / so that each of them might se others fyers
that they made. Than the next morning the french / men auaunced farther / and
about noone they ca^e to a mountain right against the englysshmen so that
there was no more between them / but a little medowe of a.xii. acres of land.
Incontinent the englysshemen made ready their battle to fight: and set their
archers in the hangyng of the hill before them / than the frenchmen ordained
two batayles / in every battle a.v. M. men. The first led the dolphyne of
Auuergne earl of Cleremont / called Berault and there he was made knight / and
rearyd his baner quartered with Auuergne and Merquell. And with him was the
lord Robert Daulphyn his uncle / the lord Montagu / the lord of Talencon /
y^ lord of Cochfort / the lord of Serygnacke / the lord Godfray of Boloyne
and diverse other knights and squyers: of Lymosyn / of Quercy / of Auuergne /
and of Rouergue. In the second battle was the earl of Forestes / the lord
John^ of Boloyn earl of Auuergne / the lord Darchyer and his sons / the
lord Dachon / the lord Du^es / sir Renalt of Forest^ brother to therle / and
many other knights and squyers: having great desire to fight with their
enemies / by semyng. On the other side sir Robert Canoll and his company showed
how he hadd also great desire to have battle. Thus both hosts stood still
till it was nere night each before other / without going out of their
straytes: save certain young knights and squyers to get prise in arms /
descended down on both parties by the license of their marshals / and came
down into the medowe and there iusted one with another: and he that wanne his
fellow had him prisonerr. Thus at night each party drew to their lodgings
and made good watch: than the french lords went to counsel / and they
ordained that at the hour of mydnight they should dyscend down fro their
mountain / on the side fro their enemies ward. And to go a two leages / and so
to come to the othersyde of the mountain / where there enemies were: on the
which side y^ hill was easy enough to mount / and thought to come so erly
thither that the^glishmen should not be ready armed. this was not so secretly
spoken / but y^ thenglysshmen had knoledge thereof by an englisshe prisoner y^
stale away fro the french host / and came to sir Robert Canoll and showed him
all the matter. Tha^ sir Robert went to counsel with such as he trusted
best: so that they thought all things co^sydred that it was not best to abide
the puysance of the frenchmen / than they trussed and deperted by guydes of men
of the country / such as they had there for prisoners. At the hour of
mydnight the frenchmen put themin array of battle and rode for the as they
before had ordained: and by that time it was day they came to the mountain
where they thought to have found the englysshmen. And when they knew y^ they
were departed / they caused certain of their me^ to mount up to the mountain
to se if they could know any thing of them / they returned again and
reported how they had seen them pass by such away as they named / and how
that they were going to Lymoges in Lymosyn. When the lords of France herd
that / they brake vpp^ their journey and deperted every man to his own. And
anon after was the marriage made of the lord Berault Daulphyne of Auuergne /
and the daughter of the earl of Forestes that he had by the duke of Burbons
suster.

Of the almaygnes that abode the king of England at Calays to ride with him
into the realm of France / king Joha^n being still prisoner in England.
Cap. CC.v.
ALl this season the king of England made great prouisyon to come into
France: such as had not been seen the like before. Certain lords and
knights of the empire / such as had served the king before / provided the
same yer greatly for horse and harneys / and other things necessary for their
degrees. And as soon as they might they came by Flaunders to Calays / and there
a bode for the kings coming: so it was that the king of England came not so
soon to Calays as it was said he should have done / wherefore much people
resorted thither / so that they wist not where to lodge nor to have stablyng for
their horses. Also bredde / wine / hay / and otes: and other prouisyons were
very dear and scant / so that there was none to get for gold nor silver: and
ever it was said the king comes the next weke. Thus tarried there the lords
of Almaygne / of Behayne / of Brabant / of Flanders / and of Heynault: fro the
beginning of August / to the feast of saint Luke / so that there were many that
were feign to sell the best part of their iewelles. And if the king had been
there than / lodgyng would have been strayter: the town was so full. And also
it was dout of these lords / who had spend all that they had / that they
would not depart fro Calays / till they were contented again of all their
expe^ses. The king send not for the fourth part of them / many of them were
come of their own good wylles / trusting to have some advantage: and some
thought to rob and pyll in the realm of France. Than the king of England
send over before the duke of Lancastre with four hundred spears / and two
thousand archers. And whan^e the duke came to Calays: these lords strangers
made great joy of him and demanded tidings of the king and of his coming.
The duke excused the king of his taryeng so long (and said) how that all
his prouisyon was natte fully ready: and said fair lord / the taryeng here is
no profit. I woll go ride for the into France / and to se what I can find
there: wherefore sirs I require you to ride for the with me / and Ishall deliver
you a certain sum of money to pay withal your costs in your lodgings /
that ye have spent here in this town of Calays / and ye shall have provision
of vitayle to carry on your summers. These lords thought great shame to refuse
the dukes offer / and so granted him: than every man new shodde their horses
and trussed and deperted nobly fro Calays with the duke and went to saint Omers
/ they were a two thousand spears he / side the archers / and other fotemen.
They passed for by saint Omers without any assaut and so rode to Bethwyne and
passed by / and came to Mount saint Eloy a good abbey and a rich a two leages
fro Arras: and there tarried a four days to refresshe them and their horses /
for they found in that abbey well wherewith. And when they had robbed and
wasted the country there about / they rode to Cambrey and there made a great
assaut. And there was slain a baneret of England and diverse other / for they
within defended themself valyantly / by the aid and conforte of the earl of
saint Poule / and the lord of Lamenall and other / who with a two hundred
spears / came into the town at a back gate. And when thenglysshmen saw that
they could get nothing there: they departed and followed the river of So^e
with great scarsnes of bred and wine. And so came to a town called Cheresy
where they found plenty of bredde and wine: and there they passed the river
for that bridge was not broken and there they tarried Alhalowen day and all
night. The same day tidings came to the duke how the king was aryued at
Calays: commaundynge him incontinent to draw toward him and all his company.
Than he returned toward Calays / with him was also sir Henry of Flaunders with
two hundred spears: and of Brabant there was sir Henry of Beautresen lord of
Bergues / and the lord Gerarde de la Herd / the lord Fra^que de Halle. O^
Heynault / the lord Gaultyer of Ma^ny / and the lord John^ of Gomegynes. And
of Behayne / sir Gaultyer de la Haultpon / sir Reynolde de Boulaunt / the lord
Godfray of Hardnamont / and the lord John^ his son / the lord of Duras /
Thyrey of Ferram / the lord Ruse of Junepe / the lord Gyles Sorles / the
lord John^ of Bermont / the lord Reynolde of Berg^hes and diverse other. The
Almaygnes and mercenaryes of strange countries / I can not name at this
present time.

Of the great host that the king of England brought into France to make war
there / king John^ being prisoner in England: and of the order of the english
host. Cap. CC.vi.
AS the duke of Lancaster and these lords returned toward Calys / they
met in their way a four leages fro Calays so great multitude of people / that
all the country was covered therewith / so rychely armed and besene / that it
was great joy to behold the fresshe shinyng armours: baners w^^ynge in the
wind / their co^panyes in good order ridyng a soft pase. When the duke and
these lords met the king: he feested them and thanked them of their service
/ than these almayns / mercenaryes / brabances / behannoyes / all together
showed unto the king: how they had spent all their goods / horses / and
harnes sold. So that little or nothing was left them to do him service: for
the which intent they were come / nor how they had not wherewith to go home
again unto their countries if they should depart: wherefore they desired his
noblenes to take some regard to them. The king answered (and said) how he was
not as than ready to give them a plain answer: but said sirs I think ye
before traueyled / wherefore go your ways and refresshe you a two or three days
in Calays / and this night and to morrow I shall take counsel and send unto
you such an answer: that of reason ye shall be content. Than these strangers
departed fro the king and fro the duke and rode toward Calays: and they had
not ryden half a leage farther / but they met a great multitude of caryages.
And after that the prince of Wales nobly and richely besene and all his company
/ whereof there was such a nombre that all the country was covered with them /
and he rode a soft pase ready raynged in battle / as though they should
incontinent have fought. Thus he rode ever a leage or two after the kings
host: and all the caryages between both hoostes / the which order these
strangers lyked maruelusly well.

When these strangers had well regarded this company: and had reverently
saluted the prince and such lords as were with him / and the prince louyngly
received the^ as he that could right well do it. Than they took leave of him
and showed him their need / desyringe that he would regard their necessytie:
and he gladly promised the^ so to do. So they rode on till they came to Calays
/ and the second day after the king sent them their answer by three sufficient
knights / and they showed them plainly that the king had not brought with
him treasur sufficient to pay all that they desired / and to perform the
enterprice that he has taken in hand: but if they would go forth with him /
and to take such fortune as falls other good or yuell. If good fortune and
wynnyng fall: they to have their part / so that they demand no wages: nor for
loss of horse nor spence / nor damage that they may happ^ to have / for they
said the king had brought men enough out of his relame to furnysshe his
enterprice. This answer pleasedd not greatly these lords nor their company /
who had sore traueyled and spended their goods / and had laid their horses
and harnes to pledge / and solbe for necessytie. Howbeit they could have
nothing else / but that the king delyuerd the^ a certain sum of money to
bring them home into their country. How beit some of those lords went again
to the king to serve him at adventure: they thought it shame to return again
without any thing doing. I shall deuyse to you so^what the order that the king
of England took or he departed out of England / the which is not a thing
shortly to pass over: for there never departed out of England before such an
army / nor so well ordered.

Or the king departed out of his realm: he made all the lords of France such
as were prisoners to be put into diverse pla^es and strong castelles in the
realm to be the more surer of the^ and the french king was set in the tower
of London and his young son with him / and much of his pleasure and sport
restrained: for he was than straytlyer kept than he was before. Than every man
was commanded to go to Dover / where as ships were ready to pass over / so
every man drew thither none abode at home / between the age of twenty and
threscore. So that nere hand all lords / knights / and squyers went to
Dover: except such as the king had appointed to keep the realm / castles /
marches / and hauyns of the same: when all were assembled at Dover. Than the
king took his musters: and there said plainly that his entencyon was to pass
over into the realm of France / and not to return again till he had made an
end of his war / or else a sufficyent peace to his great honor and profet /
or else to dye in the pain. And therefore he said if there were any that were
not well wylling to go over to return again back every man said they were
glad to serve him. And so they all entered into their ships in the name of
god and saint George: and they arrived at Calays two days before the feast of
Alsayntes / the year of our lord. M. CCC.lix.

How the king of England departed fro Calais / and of the order of his host /
in ridyng through Picardy / and so to the city of Reins. Cap. CC.vii.
When the king and the prince his son were arrived at Calys / and also three
other of his sons / that is to say lord Lyonell earl of Ulster / the lord
John^ earl of Rychmont and ye lord Edmonde youngest of the four and all their
people / and that they had dyscharged out of their ships all their horses
and other prouysion / and had tarried there four days. Than every man was
commanded to make ready to depart: saying how he would ride after his cosyn
the duke of Lancastre. Than the king in a morning departed fro Calays with all
his company and caryages / in the best order that ever any army issued out of
any town. It was said he had a six thousand charyettes and carts brought out
of England well furnysshed: than he ordered his bataylles so richely besene that
it was joy to behold them / and than his constable the earl de la March had
five hundred knights armed / and a thousand archers before his battle. Than
the kings battle with three thousand men of arms / and.v. thousand archers
in good order: ridyng after the constables battle / and next after the kings
battle came all the caryage / the which contained two leages in length / mo
than five thousand charyettes and carts / caryeng prouisyon for y^ host
withal things of householde / which had not besene before carried with men of
war / as handmylles / ouyns to bake in / and such other things necessary.
Than next after them came the princes battle / and of his brethren / wherein
were a two thousand spears nobly horsed and richely besene in order ready to
fight: they rode not past a four leages a day. And in this manner they were
encountered with the duke of Lancastre and the strange lords / between Calys
and the abbey of Lykes in a fair plain. In the kings host there were a five
hundred varlettes with matockes and axes to make even the ways for the caryage
to pass. Now shall I name unto you certain of the lords and knights of
England that passed the sea with their king: and before in the company of the
duke of Lancastre / the kings cosyn germayn. First his. iiii sons: the
prince Edward / sir Lyonell / sir Joha^ne / and sir Edmonde. Than sir Henry
duke of Lancastre / sir John^ earl de la March constable of England / the
earl of warwyke / the earl of Suffolk marshall of England / the earl of
Herforde and Northampton / the earl of Salysbury / therle of Stafforde / the
earl of Oxenford / the bishop of Lyncolne / the bishop of Dyrham the lord
Percy / the lord Neuell / the lord Spenser / the lord Rose / the lord Manny
/ the lord Renolde Cobham ye lord Monbray / the lord Dalawar^ the lord
John^ Chandos / sir Richard Penbruge / the lord of Man / the lord
Wylloughby / the lord Feltone / the lord Basset the lord Crabalton / the
lord Sylua^^yer / sir James Awdeley / sir Bartylmewe de Brunes (...) lord of
Salyche sir Stephyn Gonsanton / sir Hew Hastynges / sir Joha^n Lysle / sir
Nowell Lormych and diverse other / whom I can not name. They rode through
Arthoyes and passed by the city of Arras / and took the same way that the duke
of Lancastre had paste before / they could find nothing to live by in the
plain country: for all that there was left was put into the fortresses. And
also the country had been long poor and sore wasted: and it was a dear season
in the realm of France / and great famyne ran generally through all the
contre / for the yerth had not ben labored of three yer before: for if otes and
whete had not come to them out of Heynault and Cambresis: the people in
Arthoyes / Uerma^doys / and in the bysshoprike of Laone and Reins had dyed for
hunger. And the king of England or he departed out of his own realm / herd
of the great famyne in that country. He and all his lords brought prouysion
with them: except otes and straw / wherefore they made as good shyft for their
horses as they might. Also the season was sore reyning and weyt the which did
them great trouble and their horses also: for most part day and night it
reyned without cease / so that wine that year was little worth.

THe king of England rode by small iourneys till he aproched Balpausmes / and I
shall show you of an adventure that fill to sir Galahault of Rybamont / a
right hardy and an expert knight of Picardy. ye shall know that all the towns
/ cities / castelles / and passages / which way the king went were surely kept:
for every town in Picardy took in soudyours at their wages for their surety.
The earl of saint Poule with two hundred spears was in the city of Arras /
the constable of France was at Amyense the lord of Monsalt at Corby / sir
Edward of Rancy / and sir Ingram of Hedyn at Balpausmes / sir Baudwyn
Dannekyns master of the crosbowes at saint Nuyntines. And thus in every town
and city: for they knew plainly that the king of England would come and ley
siege to Reins / so it was that they of Peron in Uermandoys / the which was
in the king of Englandes way / had no captain nor ruler of their town: and
the englysshmen aproched daily / wherefore they were not well at their ease.
This town stands on the river of So^e and thenglysshmen lightly ever followed
the ryuers: at last they of Peron remembered them of sir Galahaut of Rybamont /
who was not received as captain into any town / and as they were enfourmed
he was as than at Tourney. Than they send courtesse letters to him: desyryng
that he would help to keep their town of Perone with such company as he
could get / and promised to give him for his own person every day twenty
fra^kes / and for every knight under him ten / and for every spear with three
horses one frank a day. Sir Galahaut who desired to exercise the feat of arms
/ and saw how he was desired of the^ of Peron his neyghburs / he lightly
agreed to them. And send the^ word how he would be with them the second day
after: he prepared him and get such company as he could / and so departed
fro Tourney with a thyrtie with him / and always his nombre increased. And he
send to sir Roger of Coloyne to mete with him at a certain place appointed:
and this sir Roger came thither with a twenty with him. So that at last this
ser Galahaut had a fyftie spears / and lodged one night a prochynge to Peron
ward within two leages of thenglysshe host / in a little vyllage in the
feldes the which was all boyde: for all the people of the country were fled
into the forteresses. The next morning they defmyned to enter into Peron / for
they were not far thens: and when it was after supper about the hour of
mydnight / and that they had set their watch and iangeled one to another of
diverse matters / than ser Galahault said we shall be to morrow betymes at Peron /
but yet or we enter I shall counsel that we ride to the fro^ter of our enemies
/ for I think there be some among them that to auaunce themself / or to seek
for some forage woll come abroad in the morning / we may fortune to mete with
such that shall pay for our scotte. To this agreed all his company and kept it
secret: and at the brekyng of the day they were ready and their horses sadled /
and so rode forth in good order / and went out of the way to Peron / and
coosted the wodes to se if they could find any adue^tur And so came to a
vyllage where the people had fortyfied the church: there sir Galahaut a lighted
for he knew well there was bredde / wine / and other vitaylles / and they
within offered him to take what he would. And while they were there sir Galahalt
called to him two squyers / whereof Bridoll of Tallone was one: and he said to
the^ sirs go and ride forth into the foldes and dyscouer the country every way
/ and look if ye se any thing / and come hyder again we woll abide you here.
These two squyers well horsed rode forth into the feldes / and went to a wood
half a leage thense: the same morning was ryden forth sir Renault of Boulant
an almaygne / of the company of the duke of La^casters and was returnyng
again. And so he came to the same place where the two squyers were / they
wend they had been some men of arms of the country that had been there in a
busshement: at last they spyed well how they were almaygnes. Than^e the two
squyers spoke toguyder (and said) we must feign us to be of their party: than
sir Renault of Boulant spoke to them / and demanded what they were in the
language of Almaygne / Bridoll answered who could well speak that la^gage (and
said) sir we be pertaining to sir Bartylmewe de Bonnes. Why where is sir
Bartylmewe said sir Renolde / sir said they he is in ya^der vyllage: and why
does he tarry there said the knight / sir said they for us. Hesende us abroad
to se if we could find any forage abroad in the country / by my faith said the
knight her is none: for I have ryden all this morning and can find nothing /
wherefore go ride to him and bydde him come away / and let us ride together
toward saint Quyntines / to se if we can find there any better market or any
good adventure. Sir said the squire who be you that would have him in your
company: they call me quod the knight Renolde of Boulande say so to sir
Bartylmewe. Than the two squiers returned to the vyllage: as soon as sir
Galahault saw them / he demanded what tidings (have ye any thing sone) yes
sir quod they we have seen enough. Sir in yander wood is sir Renold of Boulant
with xxx. with him: and he has ryden all this morning he desires sore to have
you in his company to ride together towardesaynt Quyntines / what quod sir
Galahaut what say you. Sir Renolde of Boulant is a knight of Almayne / and
retained with the king of England: all y^ sir we know well said the squyers
/ and how departed you than fro him said sir Galahaut / I shall show you
said sir Bridoll: than he showed him all ye words that had been between them.
And when sir Galahaut herd that he studied a little: and than demanded
counsel of sir Ronger of Colayne and of such other knights as were there
what was best than to do. They answered and said: sir ye desire ever to find
aduentur / and sith they fall in your hands take them / for always by right
of arms a man ought to grieve his ennemy. To this counsel lightly agreed sir
Galahault / who was desirous to find his enemies: he lept on his courser and
did on his basenet with a vyser / because he would natte be known / and so did
all his company. Than they issued out of the vyllage and took the feldes /
determined what they would do / and so rode on ye right hand to ward the wode
/ where sir Reynold tarried for them: and they were a. lx^. men of arms / and
sir Renolde had not past a. x^^. and when sir Renolde saw them he displayed
his bauer before him / and came softely ridynge toward them wenyng to him that
they had been englysshmen. Whan^e he aproched he lift up his vyser and saluted
sir Galahaut in the name of ser Bartylmewe de Bonnes. Sir Galahaut held
himself still secret and answered but fayntly / and said let us ride forth:
and so rode on and his men on the one side / and the almaygnes on the other.
When sir Reynolde of Boulant saw their manner / and how sir Galahaut rode
sometime by him and spoke no word: tha^ he began to suspecte. And he had not
ryden so the space of a quart of an hour / but he stood still under his baner
among his men (and said) sir I have dout what knight ye be / I think ye be not
sir Bartylmewe de Bonnes for I know him well and I se well that it is not you.
I woll ye tell me yo^ name or I ride any farther in your company. Therewith sir
Galahaut lift up his vyser and rode toward the knight to have taken him by
the raygne of his bridell / and cried our lady of Rybamont: than sir Roger of
Coloyne said Coloyne to the rescue. When sir Renold of Boula^t saw what case
he was in / he was not greatly afraid: but drew out his sword: and as ser
Galahaut would have taken him by the bridell / sir Reynolde put his sword
clean throught him / and drue again his swerd out of him and took his horse
with ye spurs / and left sir Galahaut sore hurt. And when sir Galahaltes men
saw their master in that case they were sore dyspleased / and set on sir
Renaldes men: there were many cast to the yerth / but as soon as sir Renolde had
given sir Galahaut that stroke / he struck his horse with the spurs and took
the feldes. Than certain of Galahaultes squyers chased him / and when he saw
that they followed him so ner that he must other turn again or else beshamed.
Like a hardy knight he turned and abode the tormast: and gave him such a
stroke / y^ he had no more list to follow him. And thus as he rode on he served
three of them that followed him / and wounded them sore: if a good are had been in
his hands at every stroke he had stayne a man. He did so much that he was out
of the danger of the frenchmen and saved himself without any hurt: the which
his enemies reputed for a great prowes / and so did all other y^ herd thereof /
but his men were ner slain or taken / but few that were saved. And sir
Galahault was carried fro thense sore hurt to Perone: of that hurt he was never
after perfetly hole / for he was a knight of such courage that for all his
hurt he would not spare himself / wherefore he lived not long after. Now
let us return to the king of England and she we how he laid his siege to
the (...) of Reins.

How the king of England besieged the cite of Reins / and of the castle of
Chargny taken by thenglysshmen. And of the war that began again between the
duke of Normandy and the king of Nauer. Cap. C C.viii.
THe englysshmen did somoche that they passed Atthoyes / where they found a
poor country: and so entered into Cambresis where they found a better market /
for there was nothing put into the fortresses because they thought themself
well assured of the king of England and his company / because they held of
thempyre: but y^ king of England thought not so. The king went and lodged at
Beauuoyes in Cambresis: and there he abode a four days to refresshe them and
their horses and over ran the most part of Ca^bresis the bysshopp^ Pyer of
Cambray and the cou^saylles of the lords of the country and good towns by
save conduct: send certain messangers so the king of England to know by what
tytell he made war to them. They were answered it was because in time paste
they had made alyance and conforted the frenchmen / and mayntened them in their
towns and forteresses: and in manner made war as their enemies. Wherefore the
englysshmen said they might well by y^ reason make war again to them. Other
answer could they have non: wherefore they of Ca^bresys were feign to bear
their damages as well as they might. Thus the king of England passed through
Cambresis and so went into Thierache / his men ran over the country on both
sides / and took forage where they might get it On a day sir Bartylme we de
Bonnes ran before saint Quintyne / and by adventure he met with the
captain thereof called sir Baudewyn Danekyn. There was a great fray between
the^ and many overthrown on both parts: finally the englysshmen obtained the
vyctorie / and sir Baudwyn taken prisoner by y^ Bartylmew of Bonnes. Than
thenglysshmen returned to the king / who was lodged at the abbey of Fenney /
where they had vitaylles ynought for them and for their horses. And than rode
forth without any let till they came into the marches of Reins: the king
took his lodging at saint Wall beyond Reins / and the prince of Wales at
saint Thierry. Than the duke of Lancastre and other earls / barownes / and
knights / were lodged in other vyllages about Reins: they had not all their
case / for they were there in the heart of winter: about saint Andrews tide
with great wyndes and rain / and their horses yuell lodged and entreated / for
all the country a two or three year before the yerth had not benla boured.
Wherefore there was no forage to get abroad / under.x. or.xii. leages of /
whereby there were many frayes / sometime the^glisshmen wan and sometime lost. In
the good city of Reins at that time was captain sir John^ of Craon
archbysshoppe of the same place / and the earl of Porcyen / and sir He we of
Porcyen his brother / the lord de la Bonne / the lord of Canency / the lord
of Annore / the lord of Lore / and diverse other lords / knights / and
squyers of the marches of Reyns. They defended the city so well that it took
no damage the siege during: they city was strong and well kept. The king of
England also would not suffer any assaut to be made: because he would not
traueyle nor hurt his people. The king abode there at this siege fro the
feast of saint Andre we to the beginning of lent: they of the host rode often
times abroad to find some adventure / some into the cou^tie of Rethell / to
Warke / to Maysey / to Douchery / and Moyson: and would lodge out of the host a
three or four days and robhe and pylle the cousrey without any resistance /
and than again repair to the oost. In the same season ^yr ^ustace (...)
breticourt took the good town of Acherey / on the river of Esne / and therein
found great ple^tye of victailles / and specially of wine he found there a.
in. M. vessels / whereof he send great part to the king and to the prince / who
gave him great thauke therefore. And during this siege as the knights sought
for adventures / it fortuned that sir John^ Chanoos sir James Audeley / and the
lord of Mucident / sir Richard of Pountchardon / and their companyes / rode
so nere to Chalons in Champaigne / that they came to Chargny en Dormoy^^ / a
right fair castle / they well auewed it / they made there assaute / for they
couetted greatly to have it. In the castle were two good knights one named
sir John^ Chapel / who bare in his arms gold an ancre Sable. There was a sore
assaute. At this assaute the lord of Mucident adventured him self so forewarde
/ that he was stryken on the heed with a stone in such wise / that there he
dyed among his men / of whose death the other knights were so sore vispleased
/ that they swear not to depart thense / till they had that Castle at their
pleasure / Whereby the assawte encreassed. There were many seases of arms done
/ for the gascoyns were sore displeased for the death of their Master and
Captain the lord of Mucident. They entered into the dykes Without fear and
came to the walls / and mounted up with their targes over their hedes and in
the mean time the archars shot so holy to guyther / that none appeared without
he was in great parell. The Castle was so sore assailed / that at last it was
taken and (...) With loss and hurt of many (...). Than the two Capytaynes
Were taken / and certain other squyers / and all the reside (...) slain with
out mercy / and rased down and brent as much as they might of the castle /
because they would not keep it. And than returned to their (...) / and showed
the king what they had be done. During the siege before Reinnes / there began
again a great grudge and evil will between the king of Nauer / and the duke
of Normandye: the reason or cause why I can not tell / but so it was that the
king of Nauer departed suddenly from Paris / and went to Maunte on the River
of Seyne / and than de^ied the duke of Normandy and his brethren. And they had
great marvel by what title he than renewed again his War. And so (...) or
shadow of that war / a squire of Bruceis called (...) Ostraste took the
strong callell of Robeboyls on the river of Seyne / a leage from Maunte / and
made there a garyso^ / the which after dy^ much hurt to them of Paris and
therabout. Also in the same season the lord of Gommegines / who was gone into
England to the queen / When the king sent the strangers to Calayes / repassed
the sea again / and came into Heynalt and in his company certain knights and
squyers of Gascoyn and of England / their ententes were to go to the King of
England so the siege before Reins. Than the young lord of Gommegines
desiring to have auauncement assembled certain men of War to guether a.iii.
C. oone and other. And so departed from Maubuge and so came to Uesnes in
haynaulte / and passed forth to Atrelon.

The same time the lord of Ray lay in grayson at Ray in Thierase with a good
nombre of knights and squiers with him / and he knew by such spyeng as he
had made / that the lord of Gommegines had assembled certain me^ of war to
guether to go to y^ siege at Reinnes to the aid of the king of England / And
he knew well that he must pass through Thierrasse. And as soon as he knew
the certaynte of his setting forewarde he sent word thereof to certain
companyons thereaboute of the French party / and specially to the lord
Robert Chanoyne of Robersart / who as than governed the young earl of Coucis
lands and lay at the castle of Merle. When the Chanoyne knew thereof he was
not cold to set forward but incontinent went to the lord of Roy With a
sourty spears. So there the lord of Roy was made chie^ Capytayne of that
journey / as hit was good reason / for he Was a great lord of Pycardye / and a
Well renowned man of arms / and Well known in many places. So they went
forth to the nombre of three hundred men of arms / and lay in a busshement
where as they knew the lord of Gommegines should pass / who entered into
Thierasse / and took the way to Reinnes not doubtyng of any encountryng. And so
in a morning he came to a vyllage called Haberguy / there he thought to rest a
littell to refress he him and his company / and so alyghted and entered into y^
village and were about to stable their horses. And in the mean season the
lord of Gommegynes / Who Was young and lusty / and right desirous of deeds of
arms / said how he would tide out of the village to se if he could fine any
better forage* Than he took with him a certain / and Cristo (...) More a
^quyer bare his penon / and so departed from ^abergey. The frenchemen that say
in the busshement were but a little out of this village / thynkyng to have
entered into the town in the night / to have set on their enemies / for they
knew well where they were / but y^ lord of G^meg^es fell in their ha^^s. When
the frenchemen saw him coming with so pre^y a company / they had marvel at
the first what he was / and they sent out before them two currers / and they
brought word again / they were their ^nnemyes. When they hard that they
brake out of their busshement / and cried Roy in the name of the lord of Roy.
The lord of Roy came on before / with his bane^ before him displa^ed / and with
him the lord Flamo^t of Roy his cosyn / and sir Loys of Robersart / and the
^hanoyn of Robersart his brother / sir ^^^stram of Bo^ne roy / and other. When
the lord of Gomegines saw what case he was in like an hardy knight abode his
ennemies and would not flee. At the first brount the lord of Gomegines was
overthrown / and could not ce^ouer up again / and so there finally he was
taken / and two squyers of Gascoyne with him who had fought right val^auntly.
Also Cristoferde Mur was taken / who bare his penon.

So all that were there were slain or taken / except their varlettes / that
escaped by ronnynge away / they were well horsed / and also they were not
chased.

How the lord of Roy dyscomfetted the lord of Go^megines: and how the castle
of Commercy was taken by the englisshemen. Cap. CC.ix.
WWhan the knights and squyers that had taken the lord of Go^megines / and
such as had issued out of the village with him. Than they took their horses
with y^ spo^^s / and ^anne into the village c^yenge Roy in the name of the
lord of Roy / whereof they with (...) the town were sore abashed / when they
saw their enemies so nere them. The most part (...) them were unarmed and
spread abroad in the village / so that they ^oude not draw together But there
the frenchemen took them in their (...). The cha^o^ne Robersart had ma(...)
prisonners because he was known by his baner. Some there were that fled into
a littell strong house enuyroned with water standing at the towns end. And
some of them said / how it was best for them to keep it / affirmynge how the
house was strenge enough to keep till they might send word what case they were
in to the king of England / being at the siege of Reinnes / not doubting /
but that he woll than incontinent send them some aid.

Than some other said / that so doing was no suerte for them / seeing how
their enemies were round about them. Thus they were in strife among them
self what they might do.

In the mean space theder came the lord of roy and said to them / s^rs yield
up your self / for and we assail you / ye are all but deed / for inco^^ynent
we shall take you per force. So that by those works and other / the most
hardyest of them were abashed: and so they yielded theymselfe prisoners / their
lives saved allouly / they were all sent as prisoners to the castle of Coucy
and to other french garysons. This adventure fell in the year of our lord. M.
CCC: lix. Whereof the king of England (when he knew it) was sore displeased /
but he could not amend it as at that time. Now let us return to the siege of
Re^nnes / and speak of an adventure y^ fell to sir Bertilmewe of Brennes / who
had besieged the town and castle of Comercy and within was Captain a knight
of Champaygne called sir Henry Denoyr.

THe siege during before Reyns the lords of the ost were lodged abroad in the
country to lie the more at their ease / and to keep the ways that no
prouysion should enter into the city. And among other sir Bertilmewe de
Bonnes with his Company of spears and archers were lodged nere to Comercy a
strong castle / parteynynge to the ar^hebysshoppe of Reins. The which
bishop had made there a strong garyson / so that this castle doubted none
assaute / for ther^ was a square tou^e thick walled / and fensably fournisshed
for the war Sir Bartilmewe de Bonnes laid siege thereto / and saw well how
he could not win it by assaute / he set a warke a certain number of miners
and gave them good wages / they began to werk night and day / and did so much
that they mined far under the great tower / and as they went they set up
proppes / so that they within knew nothing thereof. And when the myners had
made an end / so that the tower was (...) to fall wha^ they ^yst * they came
to ser Bar(...) and said. Sir we have so (...) that the great towte shall fall
/ when it pleases you. Well quo^ the knight ye have well done / ^o no more
till I commaun^e you. Than he took Johsi de Guyltell with him / and went to
castle / and madesigne that he would speak with some of them within. Than sir
Henry Denoyr captain there cameto the bat^^mentes of the y^ walls / and
demanded what he would have. I woll (said sir Bartilmewe) that ye ye^^ york
and all yours / orels ye are all deed without remedy. How so quod sir Henry /
and began to smyle / we are provided of all things / and ye would have us to
yield symply / the which We woll not do. Well quod for Bartilmewe / and ye
knew what case ye stand in / ye would ^^continent yield up without any (...)
words. Why quod sir Henry / what case be we in? (...) out quod the english
knight / and I shall show you / and ye shall have assurance to enter again if
ye list. Than sir Henry and.iiii. with hy^^ issued out and came to sir
Bar(...) / and to Johsi ^e Guyltelles / and they brought him to the mine / and
there showed him how the great toure stood but on stages of tymbre. When the
knight saw the parell that he was in and his company / he said. Sir it is
(...) / and this that ye have done to me is of your great (...) We yield us to
your pleasure. There sir Bartilme we took them as his prisoners / and made
every man to come out of the castle / and al their goods / and than he set
^yer into the mine and brent the stages / and than the toure claue a souder and
fell to the earth. Lo^ (...) sir (...)mewe to ser Henry / behold now if I

pleasure / and thank you of your courtesye / for (...) other than us in this
case we should not have been so delte with all. Thus they of the garrison of

THe king of England la^e at the siege of Reinnes more than.vii. weeks / but
he made none assaute. for he knew well he should but have lost his pain. And
when he ha^ (...) there so long that he was were / and that his men could
find no more forage abroad / and lost their horses / and began to la^ke
(...) They on a bay departed in good (...) / and t^^e the way to Chalo^s in
Champaygne / and (...) by Chalons (...) so went to (...) ^^nged at Merry on the
(...) of (...) all his (...) the which is called.viii. leages. And while the
king lay at Merry his Counstable / with the ^awarde went to saint Florentyne /
Where sy^ Edward of Rency was captain. There was a great assaute / but no
good they did. Than the king came thither / and lodged there about the ^yuer of
Mouson. And than they departed and came to Tonnerre / and took the town by
assaute / but not y^ castle. In the which town the englysshemen found
beyond. in. M. (...) of mine / the which was necessary for the (...). And
within the Castle was the lord Fyennes Constable of France / with a great
nombre of men of war.

How the king of England as he went wasted and distroyed the country: and
how he came to Aguillo^: and there tarried. And of the great prouysyon that
came after his ^ost. The CC. (...). Chapitre.
THe king of England and his oost ^ested at (...) the space of.v. days (...)
of yt good wynes they found there / and often times assailed ye castle / but
therein were good men of arms / as sir Baudwyn ^^neken maiste^ of the
crosbowes when the king had well refresshed his oost in Tonuer / he departed /
and passed the river of Armencon / and left the way to Aussetre on the right
hand / and took the way to Noyers / to the intent to enter into Borgoyn / and
to be the^ all the lent time. So they passed by Noyers without any assaute /
for he had the lord thereof prisone^ ever sith the bata^le of Poicters. And so
the king went to a town called Most royal / and so from thense to Aguillon
on the river of Selettes / for a squier of his called / John A^enson / who bare
in his arms azute / asko^hy^ silver: had won the town of Flauigny not far
theuse / and had found therein great prouysion of all manner of victaylles to
serve y^ oo^^ the space of a month the which came Well to pass / for the
king lay at Aguillon fro All he Wednysday till after mydle^t: and always his
ma^^hals and currou^s ouer^anne the country wasting and e^ilynge it / and
often times refresshed the oost with new provision.

The king of England and the great men of his (...) had ever with them in
their cariages ^emes / pa^^lions / mylles / ouyns / and forges / to syeth and
to bake and to forge shoos for horses and for other things necessary / they
had with them a. (...). (...). carts / every carte at lest with. (...). good
horses brought out of England. Also they brought in these Carts certain
botes made of lether subtly wrought and sufficiently ^uery one of them to
receive.iii. men to row in water or rivers: and to fysshe in them at their
pleasure in the which did the great lord much pleasure in the lent season.
Also the king had (...)* ^a^koners a horsbacke with hawks / and (...)ple of
hounds / and as many greyhou^(...). So that ^ere every day either he hunted
or hauked at the river / as it pleased him. And (...)rs other of the great
lords had hundes and (...) as well as the king: and ever as the ost (...) /
they went in three datailes / and every ^^^ayle had his vawarde / and every oost
lodged by themself / each a leage from other. And the king kept the third
bataile / which Was most greattest. That manner they kept fro the time they
removed from Calais till they came before the good town of Charters.

THe king of England who lay at Aguillon / had great ^uision for his oost /
by the means of John^ Alenson who he found at F^auig^y. While the king lay at
Aguillon / the young duke of Burgoyne (by the counsel and request of all the
country) sent to the king of England certain messangers / lords / and
knights / to treat for a respite: not to burn ^he country / nor over run
it. These were the lords that went to treat for this matter / First the lord
ser A^ceaulme of Sallins great chau^(...) of Burgoyn / ser Jaques of Uie^ne /
ser John^ ^e ^ye ser Hugh of Uie^ne / ser William of Tho^^^se / and ser John^
of Mo^tmartin. These lords found the king of England so treatable / y^ there
was a composicion made between ye king of England / and the country of
Bourgoyn / the king made them assurance for him and all his / not to over ren
that country / the space o^* iii. years / and he ^o have ready the sum of ii.
M. frankes. When this treaty was agreed and sealed the king dislodged and al
his oost / and t^ke the right way to Paris / and lodged on ye ^^^er of Dyonne
at Leon / beside Uoselay / and his people lay alonge the river side welnere to
(...) at thentre of the cou^tie of Neuers / and the englisshemen entered into
Gastenoys. The king sped him so by his iourneis y^ he came be (...) Paris and
lay.ii. leages the^s at Burg^le royne.

THus the king rode about the country distroyeng all before him: and also the
garysons made war for him in Beauuoisy^ in Pycardy / in France / in Brye / in
Cha^paigne and destroyed nere all the country. Also the king of Nauer / who
was in the marches of Normandy made also sore war. Thus ye noble realm of
France was sore grieved on all sides. And specially sir Eustace Dambreticourt /
who lay at Chemy on y^ river of Esne who had a great garrison of soudiers /
wasted raunsommed and pilled the country / and over ran the county of
Rethel to Douchery / to Mesieres / to Chene Pou^lleux to S^tenay in the county
of Bay / they rode and lay in the country where they list.ii. or.iii. nyghtes
together without any let or trouble / and when they list returned again to
their fortress of Chemy. True it was that the lords and knights of the
country thereabout were sore displeased with that fortress / and assigned
many days among them self to mete / and to go and lay siege to Chemy: how
be it they never did nothing. These companyons whoymagined night and day how
they might geat and steal towns and fortresses * on a night they ^ame to a
strong town and a good castle in Laonnoyse nere to Montague / this fortress
was called Pierpont standing in a maresse / ye same season there were within
the town great no^bre of men of the country / that had brought thither their
goods on trust of the strength of the place When they of Chemy came thither /
the watch within was a (...) / they spared not the dangerous maresses / but
went through them and came to the walls / and so entered into the town and
wa^ne it without defense / and ^obded it at their pleasure. They found there
more riches than ever they found before in any town. And wh^ it was day they
brent y^ town / and returned to Che^^y / well furnysshed with great pyllage.

How the king of England put the realm of France into great tribulacio^: and
the prophicies of the friar of Auygnon: and of thenglisshe busshement laid for
them of Paris. Cap. C C.xi.
IN this season a friar minor full of great clergy was in the cite of Auigno^
/ called friar John^ of Roche tayllade / the which friar pope Innocent the.vi.
held in prison in the castle of Baignoux for showing of many meruailes after
to come / principally he shown many things to fall on the prelates of the
church for the great super^^uitie and pride / that Was as than used among
them. And also he spoke many things to fall of the realm of France and of
the great lords of Chri(...)ome for the oppressions that they did to the pore
common people. This friar said he would prove all his sayynges by the auctorite
of the Ap^^^lippis / and by other books of holy saints / and prophettes y^
which were opened to him by the grace of y^ holy gooste he showed many things
hard to believe: and many things fell after as he say^. He said them not as a
prophette / but he showed them by auctorite of ancient scriptures / and by the
grace of the holy ghost / who gave him v^dersta^dynge to declare the ancient
proph^cie^ and to show to all christian people the years and time When such
things should ^all / he made diverse books founded on great ^ciences and
clergy / whereof one was made the year of our lord. M. CCC.xlvi. Wherein were
written such meruailes / that it were hard ^o believe them how be it many
things according thereto ^ell after. And when he was demanded of the wars of
France / he said that all that had been seen was not like that should be seen
after. For he said that the wars in France should not be ended till the
realm were utterly wasted and exyled in every part. The which saying was
well seen after / for the noble realm of France was sore wasted and exyled:
and specially in y^ term that the said friar ha^ set: The which was in the
years of our lord. M. CCC. (...).lvii. lviii. and.lix. He said in those years
the pryncis and gentylmen of the realm (...) for fear show them self
against the people (...) low estate / assembled of all cou(...) without heed
or Captain / and they should (...) as they list in the realm of France /
the which (...) after as ye have herd / how the companyons assembled them
to guether / and (...) (...)son of their robbery and pyllage wa^^d rich and
became great capitaynes.

Now let us return to the king of England / Who lay at Bourge the Royne
a two little leages ^ro Paris / and all his ooste toward Mou(...)hery / the
king sent his herauldes to Paris to the duke of Normandy / who lay there
with great company of men of war / to demand battle / but the duke would
not agree thereto. The messangers returned without any thing (...). And when
the king saw / that he should hau^ no battle / he was sore ^isplease^. Than
(...) Gaulter of Manny desired the king that he might make a s^rymyshe at the
Bayles of Paris: the king agreed thereto / and named such as should go with
him / and the king made certain new knights: as the lord Fitz Wa^er / the
lord of Siluacier / sir Balastre / y^ William Torceaux / sir Thomas Spencer /
sir Johan Neuell / sir Richard Dostenay / and other. Also the king would have
made knight Colla^^ Dambreticourte son to sir Nicholas / Who was squier for
the kings body: but the squ^e^ excused him self / he said he could not
find his Bassenette. The lord of Manny did his enterprise * and brought these
new knights to skrymyshe at the Barriers of Paris. There was a sore skrymyshe:
for within the cite there were mane good knights and squiers / Who would
gladly have issued out / if ye duke of Normandy would agreed thereto / how be it
they defended their gate and barryers in such Wyse^ that they took litell
^ammage. This skrymy^^ endured from the morning till noone / diverse were hurt
on both parties. Than the lord of Manny withdrewe to his lodging / and there
tarried all that day and the next night following. And the next day after the
king (...)ged and took the way toward Moutlehe^y* Certain knights of
England and of Ga^coyne at their dislodgyng determined to ly^ in a busshment:
for they thought there were so many gentylme^ in Paris / that some of them would
adventure to issue out. And so a two hundred of chosen men of arms gascoyns
and englisshe laid them self in a bussheme^t in a void house a.iii. leages
fro Paris. There was the captall of Buz * ser Edmonde of Pomiers / and y^ lord
of Courton gascoyns. And there were englisshe the lord Neuell / the lord
Mombray / and sir Richard of Pounchardon: these.vi. knights were chie^
capitaynes of this imbu^shement. When the frenchemen in Paris saw the
dyslodgynge of the english oost / certain young knights drew to guether
and said: It Were good that we issued out of this cite secretly and follow the
englisshe oost / perauenture we may hap somewhat to win. Anon there agreed
to y^ purpose / sir Ra^^ of Coucy / sir Rau^ of Remenall / the lord of
Montsault / the lord of Helay / the chatelayne of Beauuoys the Begue of
Uillaines / the lord of Beausiers / the lord of Ulbari^ * sir Gauwen of
Ualouell / sir Fla^ant of Roy / sir ^elles of Cauilly / sir Peter of ^armoises
/ and Peter of Sauoise / and about (...) ^peares in their company. They issued
out well horsed / and well wylled to do some deed of arms / they rode the way
to Bourge le Royne and passed by and rode so forward / that they passed by y^
englisse bussheme^t. And when they were passed / the english men and
gascoynes brake out and set on them / cryeng their cries The trenchemen
returned / and had great marvel what it was and incontinent they knew how
it was their ennemies. Than they stood still / and set them self in order of
battle / and couched their spears against the englisshmen and gascoyns / at
the first metynge there was a sore iustes / and diverse cast to the earth on
both parties / for they were all well horsed. Tha^ they drew out their swerdes
/ and entered each among other / gyuyng great strokes. There was done many a
propre feat of arms. This fight endured a great space / so that none could
tell Who should have the victory. There y^ captall of Buz proved him self a
good knight / and did with his hands noble deeds of arms. Finally the
englisshemen and gascoyns bare them self so well that the victory abode on
their part they were as many and half as many again as the french men were.
On the french pertie the lord of Ca^premy was a good knight / for he fought
valiauntly under his baner / and he that bare it was slain / and the lord
taken prisoner. The other french knights and squiers (seeing their evil
adventure) returned toward Paris / and fought ever as they fled / for they
were sore poursewed. The chase endured till they paste Bourg le Royne / and
there were taken a.ix. knights and squiers. And if the englyssheme^ and
gascoyns (who pursewed them / had not doubted the issuynge out of them of Paris
/ all the other had been taken or slain: but when they had done their feat they
returned to Mou^tlehery where the king of England was and brought thither with
them their prisoners / and raunsomed them courtesly the same night / and
suffered them to go whither they list / and trusted them on their faithes.

THe entencion of the king of England was to enter into the good country of
B^au^se and so to draw alonge the Ryuere of Loyre / and so all yt somer to
abide in Britayne till after August. And than at the vyntage to return again
into France / and to lay siege to Paris for he would not return again into
England because he said or he departed out of England that he would not
return again / till he had France at his pleasure / and he left his men in
garrisons to make war in France. in Champayn / in poicton / in Ponthieu / in
Uimeu / in Uulgesyn and in Normandy / and in all the realm of France / and in
the good towns and cites such as took his part with their own good wylles.
All this season the duke of Normandye was at Paris and his two brethren / and
the duke of orle aunse their uncle / and their counsels. They ymagined well
the courage of the king of England / and how that he and his me^brought the
realm of France into great pouerte: and saw well how the realm could not
long endure in that case / for the rentes of y^ lords and of the churches
were nygh lost in every part. As than there was a sage and a discrete person
Chancellor of France / called sir William of Montague bishop of Tyrwin by
whose counsel much of France was ruled / and good cause why: For^euer his
counsel was good and true / and with him there were.ii. other clerks of
great prudence / the Abbotte of Clugny / and the master of the friars prechers
/ called sir Simon of Langres a master in divinity. These two clerks at the
desire of the duke of Normandy / and of the hole counsel of France departed
from Paris with certain articles of peace / and sir Hew of Geneue lord of
Autun in their company. And they went to the king of England / Who rode in
Beausse toward Galardon. These two clerks and.ii. knights spoke with y^ king
/ and began to fall in treatye for a peace to be had of him and his alies. To
the which treatye the prince of Wales / the duke of Lancaster / and the earl
of March were called. This treaty was not as than concluded / for it was
long a dryuynge / and always the king went forward. These ambassadors would
not so leave the king: but stylsued and followed on their purpose: For they
saw how the french king was in so pour estate / that the realm was lykely
to be in a great ieopardye if the war continued a somer longer And on the
other side the king of England required so great things and so prejudicial
to the realm of France / that the lords would not agree thereto for their
honors / So that al their treaty (the which endured a.xvii. days still
following the king) they sent ever their process daily to the duke of Normandy
to the city of Paris / ever desiring to have again answer what they should
do farther / the which process were secretly and sufficiently examyned in the
regentes chamber at Paris / and answer was sent again by wryttynge to them /
what they should do / and what they should offer. And so these ambassadors
were often times with the king / as he went forewarde toward the cite of
Charters / as in other placess. and great offers they made to come to a
conclusion of the war / and to have a peace / To the which offers the king
of England was hard hearted to agree unto: for his entension was to be king of
France / and to dye in that estate. For if the duke of Lancastre his cosyn had
not counsayled him to have peace / he would not agreed thereunto: but he said to
the king: Sir this War that ye make in the realm of France is right
maruaylous / and right favorable for you / your men win great riches / and
ye lose your time / all thyngess consyderedde / or ye come to your entente / ye
may hap to make War all the days of your life. Sir I would counsel you
(sith ye may leave the War to your honor and profytte) accept the offers
that been made unto you: for sir you might lose more in a day / than we have
won in twenty year. Such fair and subtyle words that the duke of Lancastre
said in good entencion and for welthe of the king and all his subjects
converted the king by the grace of the holy ghost / Who was chief warker in
that case: For on a day as the king Was before Charterss there fell a case
that greatly hu^^led the kyngess courage / for while these ambassadors were
treating for this peace / and had none agreeable answer / there fell suddenly
such a tempest of tho^der / lyghtnyng / rain / and hayle / in the kyngess
oost / that i^ seemed / that the world should have ended / there fell from
heuyn such great stoness that it slew men and horses: so that the most
hardyest were abashed. Than the king of England beheld the church of our
lady of Charters / and auowed devoutly to our lady to agree to the peace / and
as it was said / he was as than confessed / and lodged in avillage nere to
Charters called Bretigny: and there were made certain composicions of peace
upon certain articles after ordeyned^ and the more syrmely to be concluded by
these ambassadors / and by the king of England and his counsel / there was
ordained by good delyberacion and aduyce a letter called the charter of the
peace / Whereof the effect foweth.

The form and tenor of the letter on the peace made before Charters bitwene
the kings of England and France. Cap. CC.xii.

ANd when this letter chartre called the letter of renunciacion / as well of
the one king as of the other was engrosed / written / and sealed: than it was
red openly in the counsel chamber / being present both kings and their
counsayles / the which seemed to each of them to be right good and well
ordained. and there again both kings swear and their eldest sons on the
evangelist is corporally by them touched / and on the body of Jesu Christ
consecrated / to keep and to acco^plisshe / and not to broke any of the foresaid
things. And yet farther by the advice and regard of the french king and of
his counsa^^e / and at the end of their parliament / the king of England was
required that he would give and send a general commiss^^ to all them that for
the time held vndershadow of the war / towns / castles / and fortresses in
the realm of France / werby they might have such commandment to avoid and
depart And the king of England (woe as than would nothing but wealth and good
peace to be norysshed bitwene him and the french king his brother / as he had
sworn and promised) lightly agreed to this* request / for it seemed but
reason* And than the king of England commanded his counsel / that such a
commission should be made after the best manner that might be according to the
intent of the french king and of his counsel. And than they of the special
co^sayle of both kings dr^we them to guether / and there was written and
engrosed by the advise of both counsayles a certain commission whereof the
tenor * follows.

Edward by the grace of god king of England / lord of Ireland and of
Aquitayne / To all our Capytaynes / kepers of towns / and of castelles
adherauntes / and alies * being in the parties of France as well in ^^cardy /

them to do or to take on them any thing contrary to the said peace / in taking
or withholdynge / fortresses / towns / cites / or castelles / or taking of
pyllage or prisoners or resting of any person / their goods / or
marchandyses / or any other thing doing against the peace / the which to us
should be right displeasaunt / and we may not / nor will suffer it to pass
under the shadow of dissimulacion / in any manner of wise / we woll with all our
power (in all these said things) find remedy. Therefore we woll desire and
ordeyne / by the deliberacion of* our counsel that none of our subjects

deed allonlye without any other process or condempnacion / that they be all
reputed for banysshed me^ out of our realm and our power: and also out of the

How after the peace made the king of England and the french king called each
other brethren. And of the wars of Britayne. And of the hostages that were
delivered to the englysshemen or the french king was delivered out of their
hands. Ca. CC.xiii.
AFter all these letters and co^myssyons were made / devised / delivered / and
well ordained / by the aduyce of the counsel of both parties / so that both
kings were content. Than they fell in communycacion of the lord Charles of
Bloys / and of the lord John^ of Mountford / for the claymes that they made for
the duchy of Britayn / for each of them clamed great right to have in yt
heritage. but for all their coi^cacio^ how they might bring them to peace and
co^corde / yet finally there was nothing done i^ yt matter / for as I was
infurmed aff the king of England nor his (...) had no great affectyon to make
that peace: For they supposed ye in time to come the men of war ye were on
their part / and should avoid out of such fortressess and garrisons as they
hew at ye time and had held in the realm of France must depart into some
other place: therefore the king of England and his counsel thaught it more
erpedient and profitable / that these men of war that thus had lived by
pillage / should draw into ye duchy of Britayn the which was a good
plentiful country / rather than they should return again into England /
and rob and pille there. So this imaginacion made shortly the englysshemen to
break of fro the co^municacion of the article of Britayne / the which was
evil done and a great sin / that they did no more in that matter than they
did. For if both kings had been well wyllyng thereto by the advice of both their
counsailles peace might have been made bitwene the parties / and each of them to
have been content with that had been given them by reason of that treatye / and
thereby the lord Charles of Bloys might have had again his children / who lay as
prisoners in England And also (perauenture) had lived longer than he did. And
because ye nothing was done than in that matter / the wars were never so great
in the duchy of Normandy before ye peace made bitwene both kings / as it was
after: as ye shall here recorded in this historye / by such barous and
knights of the country of Britayne / who vphelde and sustained / some the our
part / and some the other. And than duke Henry of Lancastre / who was a right
valiant and a sage ymagined knight / and greatly loved ye earl of Mou^^ford and
his aduau^cement / said to king John^ of France / in the presens of the king of
England and before the most part of both their counsels: Sir as yet the
truce that was taken before Raines / bitwene ye lord Charles of Bloys and the
Earl Mountforde is not expired / But has day to endure unto the first day of
May next coming / by the which season the king of England here present (by
the advice of his counsel / and consent of the prince his son) shall send
the young duke the lord John^ of Mou^tforde / with other certain of his
counsel into France to you: and they shall have full aurtorite and power to
common / and to determyne all such right / as the said lord John^ ought to
have by the succession of his father / in the duchy of Britayne. So thus by
you and your counsel and by ours to guether some good way shall be taken
between them: and for the more (...) I think it were good / that the trew^e
were relonged unto the fest of saint John^ Baptist nere following. And as the
duke of Lancastre had devised / so was it done and concludedde. And than the
lords spoke of other matters.

Ring John^ of France (who had great desire to return into France / as it
was reason) showed to the king of England with good courage all the signs of
love that he might do. and also to his nephewe the prince of wales And in like
wise so did the king of England to him / for the confirmacion of more love.

These two kings / who by the ordinance of the peace called each other
brother / gave to.iiii. knights of each of their parts the sum of.viii. M.
frankes of yearly revenues: that is to say each of them to have.ii. M. frankes.
And also because that the land of saint Savior ye Uicou^t in Constantyne /
the profit of the which came yearly into England by the gift and sale of the
lord Godfrey of Harcourt made to the king of England: as it has been showed
here before. The which land was not comprised in the ordinance of the said
treatye and peace: Therefore who so ever should hold that land / should become
subject and do homage therefore to the french king. Therefore the king of
England gave that land to sir John^ Cha^dos: who had done often times
acceptable service to him and to his children: and at the request of the king
of England / the french king by good delyberacion with good courage and love
co^fyrmed and sealed to the gift of ser John^ Chandos / he to possede and to
have the same lands / as his true heritage for ever / the which was a fair
land and a profitable / for ones a year it was well worth.xvi. hundred
frankes. And beside all this yet were there diverse other letters of alyaunces
made / of the which I cannat make mention of all: for the space of fyftene
days orthere about / while these two kings their sons / and counsailours
were at Calais there was daily commonynge / and new ordinances devised and
confermed to ratifye the peace not hyndrynge nor brekynge the first letters /
for they were ever made berynge one date to be of ye more surete / of the
which I have sen the copy of the regestres in the Chaunceryes of both kings.

And when these things were so well made devised and ordained / that they
could not be amended nor corrected / so that it was thought by reason of the
great alyaunces and bounds wherein the said kings and their children were bode
/ and had so sworn to keep the peace / that it was not likely to have been
broken: how be it the peace held not long / as ye shall here after in this
book. So that when the hostages for ye redemption of the french king / were
comen to Calys / and that the king of England had ^worn^ to keep them
peasably in his realm and that the.vi. M. frankes were paid to the king of
Englandes deputies. Than the king of England made a supper to the french
king in the castle of Calais right well ordered and the kings children and
the duke of Lancastre in the most greattest lords and barons of England
served the kings bare heeded / and after supper finally these two kings took
leave each of other right gracyously and amyably / and ^o the french king
returned to his lodgyng And y^ next morning / ye which was in the vigill of
saint Symonde and Jude the French king departed out of Calais and all such
as thulde depart with him. And the king went (...) foot a pilgrimage to our
lady of Boloyn / and the prince of Walys / and his two brethren in his company
/ the lord Lyonelle and the lord Aymo^. And so they went a foot to dinner to
Boloyn / where they were resceyued with great joy And there was the duke of
Normandy ready taryenge for them / and so all these lords went on foot into the
church of our lady / and did their offerynges right devoutly / and than
returned into the abbay there / the which was apparelled for the king / and
to receive the lords of England. And so there they were all that day and the
next night after returned again to Calats to the king their father / and so
finally they all to guether passed thesee / and the hostages of France with
them / the which was in the vigill of all Saints. In the year of our lord.

the Earl of Alanson / the lord John^ of Stampes Guy of Bloys for that county
/ Loys of Bloys his brother / the earl of saint Poule / the earl of Harecourt /
the earl Daulphyn of Auuergne / ser Ingram lord of Coucy / ser John^ of Ligny
earl of Porccen the earl of Bresme / the lord of Mo^morency / the lord of Roy
/ the lord of Preault the lord of Stouteuill / the lord of Clerettes / the
lord of saint Wenant / the lord of the toure of Aunergne and diverse other /
ye which I cannat name. Also of the good cite of Paris / of Roen / of Reinnes
/ of Burges in Berry / and of Towrs in Tourayn / of Lions on the river of Roan
/ of Seins in Bourgoyn / of Orleance / of Troy in Champaigne / of Amiens / of
Beauuoys of Arras / of Tournay / of Caen in Normandy / of saint Omers / of
Lysle / of Dowaye / and of every cite.ii. or the burgesses / and so thus
finally they passed all the sea / and came to the good cite of London. And the
king of England commanded and enjoined all his officers on great pains /
that they should be to these lords and to their company curtoyse and favorable
/ and to keep and defend them and their company from all evil rule: the
which commandment was well kept and uphold in all points. And so these
lords and other hostagers sported them without peril or danger all about in
the cite at their pleasure / and the great lords went a hunting and haukyng
at their pleasure / and rode about the country / and dysited the ladies and
damusels without any co^trollynge / they found the king of England so curtoyse
and amiable. Now let us somewhat speak of the French king / Who was come to
to Boloyn and departed fro Calais / as ye have hard here before.

Of the commyssyoners that were ordained on both parties to avoid the
gariso^s in the realm of France: and of the companions that assembled together
in the realm: and of the great evils that they did. Cap. C C.xiiii.
THe french king tarried not long at Boloyn / but departed after the feast of
all saints and went to Montrell / and to Hedyn / and so to the good cite of
Amiens / and there tarried till it was nere Christmas: than he departed and went
to Paris and there he was solemnly and reverently received of all the clergy
of Paris / and so conveyed to his palys / and there he alyghted and his so(...)
Philip / and al other lords that were there with him / and there was for them a
noble dinner apparelled. I can never show or devise how (...) the french
king wass received at his return into his realm of all manner of people For
his presence was greatly desired among them: and they gave him many fair and
rich gifts / and to visit him thither came prelates and baroness of all his
realm / and they felted / and made great chere to him / asshit wass their
duite to do / and the king received them right swetely.

Anon ofter that king John^ wass returned into France / there passed the sea
such persons as were committed by the king of England to take possessyon of
the lands countries / counties / ba^^wykes / cites to (...) ca^telles and
forteressess / that should be delivered by reason of the teeatie and peace
before made how be it ye was not so soon done / for diverse lords in
Languedor would not at the ^yr^^e obey to yield them self to hold of the
king of England / for all that the french king had quyted them of their
faith and homage that they should have done to him / for it seemed right co^n
trarte to them to obey to the engl^^hemen / and specially they of far macches
/ as ^he (...) of March / the earl of Piergourt / the earl of Gomegines the
vicount of Chaltellon / the (...)ount of Carmaing / the lord of Pyncorne^ /
and diverse other / and they maruailed greatly of the resort and alligeance
that the french king had quyted them of / and would have them to do it to the
englisshemen: And so^^e of them said that the king ought not so to acquit them
/ nor by right might so do: for they said there were i^ Gascoy^ old ancient
charters and privileges granted by great Charlemayne / who was king of
France / that he might not put their resort and aliegeaunce into any other
court / but allonely in his. And therefore these lords at the first ^^lde not
obey to that pointme^t / but the french king who would hold and accomply ^^he
that he had sworn and sealed unto / sent thither to them the lord James of
Bourbon his dear ^osyn / Who apeased the most part of the said lords and so
they became liege men to the king of England / as the earl of Arminacke the
lord Dalbret / and many other / Who at the desire of the french king / and
of the lord of Bourbon hiss cosyn obeyed to the Englysshemen full sore
against their Wylless. And also on the sea side in Poictou and Rochelss / and
in ^aynton / thyss composicion was right displea(...) to the lords and
knights / and good towness of that con^trey / When they saw that it (...)
them to become englisshe / and specially they of y^ town of Rochell / would
not agree thereto / and so excused them self often times / and so continued a
hole year / that they would not suffer the englisshemen to enter into the
town. And it is marvel to rehearse the amiable and sweet word^^ that they
wrote to the french king / In desiring him for goddess sake / that he would
not acquyte them of the faith that they owe to him / nor to put them out of his
demayne into the hades of strangers / saying how they had rather to be taxed
yearly to the half of their substanc^ than to be under the hands of the
englisshmen The french king / Who saw well their good wyls and troth that
they bare to him by their often excusacionss / had of them great p^e / ^ow^ be
it he sent and wrote affectuously to them to the intent that they should
fulfill his desire showing them / that else the peace should be broken i^
their defaute: the which should be a great prejudice to the realm of France.
so that wha^ they of Rochell saw no other remedy / and (...) sydered the
distress that they were in and (...) their (...)usacionss nor desire could not
be accepted. Than they obeyed full sore agains^^ their wylles. And the honest
men of the town said We shall obey the Englysshemen from hense forth but our
hearts shall not remove from the french part. Thus the king of England had
the possession and ses^nynge of the duchy of Aquitayne / and of the county of
Ponthieu / of Guynes / and of all the lands that he ought to hau^ on that side
of the sea / that is to say in the realm of France / given him by the
ordinance of the said treatye. And so the same year ser John^ Chandos passed
the sea as reget and lieutena^t to the king of England / and took possession
of all the said lades with ye faithess and homagess of all the Earls /
vicountess / baroness / knyghtess / and squyers towness and forteresses / and
^et (...) every place constabless / capitayness / (...) and officers by hiss
ordinance / and lay him self at Nyort / and there he held a great estate
and noble for he had well wherewith / for ye king of England / Who entierly
loved him Would that he should so do for he was well worthy for he was a good
knight curtesse and benynge amyable / liberal / preu^ / sage / and true in
all causes / and valiauntly had mayntayned him self among all lords / ladies
/ and dammuselless / Nor there was never knight in his time better beloved nor
praised of every creature.

ANd in the mean season that the (...) (...) of the king of England were
taking of the possessions of the forsaid lands according to the treatye and
peace. There were certain other deputies stablysshed by the king of England
in the bonds and limitations of France With certain persons committed by the
french king to cause all manner of men of war to avoid and depart out of
the holds and (...)so^s that they held by the commandment o^ the king of
England / and they were straightly (...) on pain of their lives and gooddes and
to be reputed as ennemies to the king of England that they should leave and
deliver up all such forteresses as they held / that should perteyue to the
french king. So there were some knights and squ^ers / such as owed
a(...)geaunce to the king of England / ob^^ed the kings commandment / and
rend^ed ^rcaused to be rendered) the fortresses that they held. But there were
some that would not obey / saying how they made war in the title of the
king of Navarre. Also there were many strangers / that were great capitaynes /
and great pyllers / that Would not depart / as Almayns / Brabances /
Flemmynges / ^aynows / (...) / manso^s / fra^co^s / who were but pore by reason
of the wars / wherefore they thought to recover them self / with making of
War in the realm of France. The which people perseuered still in their
evil doing: and so they did after much evil in the Realm / against all
them that they were in displeasure with. And When the capitaynes were thus
departed in courtesse manner out of these fortresses that they held / and that
they were in the field / than they gave leave to their men of war to depart
/ Who had learned so to pylle and rob / that they thought to return into
their own countries was not to them profitable: and perauenture they durst
not / because of such vyllayne deeds / that they were accused of there. So
that they gathered them self to guyther / and made among them self new
capitaynes and took by election the worste and most unhappy person of them
all: and so rode forth one fro an other / and met to guether again first
in Champaygne / and in Bourgoyn / and there assembled by great companyes the
Which were called the late comers / because they had as than but little
pylled in the Realm of France. And suddenly they went and took by strength
the forteresse of Genuille / and great gooddes therein the which were brought
thither by them of the country / on trust of the strong place. And when
these companions had thus found in this place such great riches / the which
was estymed to be to the value of a hundred thousand frankes. They divided hit
among them as long as it would last: and so kept still the castle a
certain space of time / and over ran and wasted the country of Champaigne /
and the busshopryches of Uerdun / and of Langers. And when they had well pylled
that country than they passed further / but first they sold the castle of
Genuill to them of the country for.xx. M. frankes. And than they entered into
Bourgoyne / and there rested and refresshed them / and tarried for mo of their
company: and there did much evil / and many villayne deeds: for they had of
their accord certain knights and squyers of the same country / who ladde
and guyded them to their evil doings. And there they tarried a long space
about Besancon / Digon / and Beaulne / and robbed all that country / For
there were none that reencou^tred them. And they took the good town of Guiercy
in Beauuoys / and robbed and pylled it. And they tarried a season about Uuergi
/ because the country was plentyfull / and always their nombre increased /
for all such as departed out of the forteresses / and had license of their
capitaynes to go whither they (...) they drew all to that part: so they were
that lent to guether a.xvi. thousand fyghtyngmen. And when they saw them self
to be of so great a nombre: than they stablysshed among them certain
capitaynes / to whom they should obey in all things. I shall show you the
names of some of the greattest masters among them. First a knight of
Gascoyne called (...) Segu^n of Battefoill he had in his company two thousand
fyghtyng men: also there was Callebert Callabaton / Guy of Pinespiote / the
litel Mechin / Batailler / Ha^nequin francois / y^ Bourge of Espace / Nandon de
Baquerant / the Bourg of Bourc / the Bretuel / the Nucharge / y^ Scot /
Arbretoury / the almayne Bourdonnell / Bernarde of the Salle / Robert Briquet /
Carnelle Aymemon of Drtige / Garsiotte of the Castle / Gironnet of Paux /
Lortingo of the Salle and diverse other. And so about the mids of lent
these companyons aduysed them self to draw to ward Auignon / and to go se
the pope and the cardynals. and so they passed through the country of Mascon /
and addressed theymselfe to go into the county of Forestes that ple^tyfulle
country / and toward Lion on the river of Rosne.

ANd When the french king herd of these tidings / how these companions daily
multiplied / wasted and exyled his realm: he was therewith right sore
displeased: for it was showed him by advise of counsel / that these
companions might so sore increase and multiply that they might do more evil
and vilayn deeds in the realm of France / than ever was done (while the war
endured) by the englisshemen. Therefore the king was counsayled / that he should
send an army of men of war to fight with them. Than the king wrote specially
to his cosyn the lord James of Bourb^ who as than was in the town of
Montpellier and had put newely sir John^ Cha^dos in possession for the king of
England / of diverse lands cities / towns / castles / and
^^rtresseslyteynynge to the duchy of Acquita(...) is before said. So the
king by his said writing desired his cosyn of Bourbon to be chief^ capttayne
to encountre / and to fight with these companions / and to take men of war
with him / in such no^bre that he might be strong enough to fight with them.
And as soon as the lord of Bourbon herd these tidings / incontinent he went
to the city of Agenoise without any resting by the way / and sent out letrers
and messangers into every part / desirynge and commau^dyng in the french
kings name all knights and squiers to come to him / apparelled for the war
and every man obeyed his commandment. And when they were assembled they drew
toward Lyo^s on the river of Rosne willing to fight with these evil people.
This lord James of Bourbon / was well beloved through all the realm of
France / and every man gladly obeyed him so that knights and squiers of all
parties / as of Auuergne / of ^ymosyn / of Proue^ce / of Sauoy / and of the
Dolphynne of Uien / and of other parties followed him: and also diverse knights
and squiers of the duchy of Bourgoyn. The which the young duke of Bourgoyn
sent thither: and so al these men of arms drew on forward / and passed Lions
/ and the county of Mascon / and came into the cou^tie of Forestes / where the
lord James of Bourbons sister was lady by the right of her children: for the
earl of Forestes (her husband) was newely deed. Therefore she governed the
country / and so sir Reynalt of Forestes / brother to the said earl / received
the lord James of Bourbon and his company right ioyously / and fealted them as
well as he mighty* also there were his two nephews who presented them self to
ride with (...) in arms / to besende their country / for the companions were
drawyng to that part: they were as tha^ about Chaslon / and about Thourain.
And wha^ they understood that the french men gadered to gether to fight with
them: Than the capitaynes drew to guether to take counsel / how they should
maynteyne themself. Than they nombred their company / and found how they were
a.xvi. M. fyghtyng men of one and other / and said among them self / let us
go against these french men / who desire to find us / and let us fight with
them at our advantage if we may orels not / and if that fortune be with us we
shall be all rich for a great season / as well by the reason of good prisoners
as other goods, and also we shall be so redoubted whereso ever we go / that none
shall be so hardy to encountre us / and if we lose / we shall lose but our Wages.
And to this purpose they agreed all. Than they dislodged and went up the
mountains / to enter into the county of Forestes / and to come to the river
of Loyre / and so they found in their way a good town called Charlien / in
the (...) of Mascon: and they made a f^erse assa(...) (...) to / the wiche
endured a hole day / but they could win no thing there / it was so well
defended by gentylmen of the country such as were (...) in / orels it had been
taken. And than they departed thense and spread abroad in the country
perteynyng to the lord of Beauteu / and there (...) great damage: and than
they entered into the bysshopriche of Lions. And as they went ever they took
small holds by y^ way and lodged (...) them and ever they did much trouble
when they came and on a day they took a castle and the lo^^e and y^ lady
within it / the which castle was called Brunay a three leages from Lions / and
ther^ they lodged and rested them / and there had perfect knowledge how the
french men were drawn into the feldes / and apparelled them to fight with
them.

How the lord James of (...) and his company were discom(...) by the
companyo^s: and how the (...)pe made to be cried a cross after these
companyons had taken the Bridge saint Esperyte: and of the answer that they
made. Cap. CC.xv.
THe men of war thus assembled with the lord of Bourbon being at Ly^s /
understood that the route of the co^panyous aproched fast toward them / and
had wo^ne the town and castle of Brunay and diverse other holds: and how
they sore wasted and eriled the country. These tidings greatly displeased the
lord of Bour(...) because he had the gouernynge of the earl of (...)stes
lands and of his sons his nephews Than they went into the field / and saw
well how they were a great nombre of men of arms knights and squiers: and so
they sent out their courrours to know what their ennemies did / and where they
were / and where they should be found. Now shall I show you the great malice
of these companyons / who were lodged on a mountain / and there they had such
a pla(...) that they could not be diseryed nor auewed and specially the chief
of them / who were best harneysed: for the residewe (who were worste
harneysed) arenged alonge on the hylle side / (...)red the french currours to
aproche nere to them and to return again without / any ^^mage to the lord
James of Bourbon / the earl Duzes / (...) Raynalt of Forestes / and to the
other french company / to whom they reported as they had seen / and said: Syrs
we have seen yonder company your ennemies / and to our powers well aduysed them.
and all things sen and co^sydered to our estimacion they pass not a. (...) M.
persons / and meruailously evil harneysed. And when the lord of Bourbon herd
that report he said to the archeprest: Sir ye have told me or this / that they
were to the nombre of. (...). M. fyghtyng men / and now ye here (...) contrary.
Sir quod he I thought them never under ye said some and if they be not god be
thanked / it is the better for us / therefore now take heed what ye will do. In
the name of god quod the lord of Bourbon / we will go and fight with them /
and there he ordered his batayles / and set them in good array ready to fight
for he might se his ennemies before him / and there he made certain new
knights first his own ^^dest son Peter / and he raised his Baner / and also
his nephewe the young earl of Forestes the lord of Tournon / the lord of
Mo(...)er and the lord Groslee of Daulph^^e / and there were also the lord
Loys sir Robert of Beau(...) ^ewes of Chaalon / sir Hew of Uien / the earl
(...) / and diverse other good knights and squiers / all desiring to auaunce
their honors and to overthrow these companyo^s that thus pylled the country
without any title of reason / and there it was ordained that the archeprest /
and sir Reynolde of Carnoll should govern the first bataile / for he was a good
and an expert knight and he had in that bataile.xvi. hundred fighting men.
These routes of companyons that were on the mountain saw right well the
ordering of the french men / but they could not so well se them nor their
gydyng / nor aproche well to them / but to their great danger or damage / for
these companyons had in this mountain a thousand cart lode of great stones
/ which was greatly to their aduau^tage and profitte / these french men that
so sore desired to fight with their ennemies / how so ever they did they could
not come to them the next way / therefore they were dreuen of necessite to
cost about the mountain / where there ennemies were. And when they came on
that side / than they who had great provision of stones began to cast so sore
down the hill on them that did aproche that they bette down / hurt and
maimed a great no^bre in such wise that they might nor durst not pass nor
aproche any nerer to them. And so that first bataylle was so sore beaten and
defoyled / that of all day after they did but litell aid. Than to their
succor approached the other bataylles / with sir James of Bourbon his son /
and his nephews with their baners / and a great nombre of good men of war /
and all went to be lost / the which was great damage and pite / y^ they
hadnat wrought by better advice and counsel than they did. The archepreste
and diverse other knights / that were there had said before / that it had
been best to have suffered their enemies to have dislodged out of the hold
that they were in and than to have fought with them at more case / but they
could not be herd. Thus as the lord James of Bourbon / and the other lords
with their Baners and Penons before them approached and costedde the said
mountain. The worste armed of the companyous cast still contynewally stones
at them / In such wise that the hardyest of them was driven abacke. And thus
as they held them in that estate a great space / The great fresshe bataylle of
these companyons found away / and came about the mountain well raynged and
had cutre their spears of six foot of length and so came ^ryenge with one
voice / and brake in among the french men. So at the first metyng they
ouerthrewe many to the earth / there were sore strokes on both partess: and
these companyons fought so arde^tly that it was marueyle / and caused the
frenchemen to recule back. And there the archpreest like a good knight fought
valyantly / but he was taken prisoner by force of arms and sore hurt / and
diverse other knights and ^^uyers of his company. Whereto should I make lengar
rehersall of this matter: in effect the frenchmen had the worse. And the lord
James of Bourbone was soore hurt and sir Peter his son / and there was slain
the young earl of Forestes / and taken sir Reynolde of Forestes his uncle /
therle Duzes / sir Robert of Beauieu / ser Loys of Chalon / and mo than a
hundred knyghtess: and with much pain the lord of Bourbone and his son
Peter / were borne in to the city of Lions. This battle was about the year of
our lord god: a thousand / three hundred threscore and one / the friday after
Easter day.

Greatly were they of the country aba^^hed / when they herd that their people
were dysconfyted / and there was none so hardy nor so strong a castle but
trymbled for fear. For the wise and discrete men supposed and ymagined that
great myschefe should multiply thereby / without god put to some remedy. and they
of Lions were greatly abashed / wha^ they knew that the companyons had the
vyctorie / how beit they received swetely all them that returned and escaped
fro the battle / and were sore dysplesed for the hurtes of the lord of
Bourbon / and of sir Peter his son. And they of the town ladies and
damoselles right goodly did visyte him / but this lord James of Bourbon dyed
a three days after the field / and sir Peter his son lived not long after:
and they were sore be way led of every creature. And for the death of thiss
lord of Bourbon the french king was right sore displeased but he could not
amend it / so it behooved him to pass over his sorrow as well as he might.

NOw let us speak of these companyons who parseuered still in their yuell
deds / as people reioysed and comforted of their deeds as well for winning of
that journey / as for the raunsomyng of many good prisoners. So thus these
co^panyons led their time at the^^ pleasure in that country / for there were
none that came against them / for incontinent after the disco^fyture of Brunay
/ they entered and spredde abroad in the county of Forestes / and pylled and
wasted all the countre^ except ye foressess. and because they were so great a
company almoost nothing held against them. And so they divided the^ into two
parts / and sir Seguyn of Batefoyle had the less parte^ how beit he had in
his company a three thousa^de fightyng men / and he went and lay at (...) a mile
fro Lions / and fortefyed the place maruelously. and so his company were there
about in the marchesse / the which was one of ye plentyfull countrees of the
world the which they over ran / and raunsomed the people at their pleasure:
that is to say all the countres on this side / and beyond the river of Some /
the cou^tie of Mascon / the archebysshoprike of Lions and the land of the
lord of Beauieu / and all the country to Marcylly to Nonnes / and to the
county of Neuers. The other part of the same company: as Nandos of
Beaugeraunt / Espyot Carnell / Robert Briquet / Ortyngo / Bernarde of the Salle
/ Lamyt / the Bourge Camas / the Bourge of Bretuell / the Bourge of Lespare /
and diverse other of one sort and affinyte: drew them toward Auygnone and
said how they would se the pope and cardynalles and to have some of their
money / orels to hare and to pyll the country. And so they tarried here and
there abiding for the rau^some of such prisoners as they had taken / and also
to se if the truce held between France and England. And as they went toward
Auygnon / they took by the way towns and fortresses / so that none held
against them / for all the country was afraid. And also in that country they
had used no war: so y^ such as were in these small holds wist not how to
defend themself fro such men of war. and these companyons herd how there
was at the bridge saint Esperyte a seuyn leages fro Auygnon great treasure and
richesse of the country assembled there together / on trust of the strong
fortress: and so the companyons aduysed among them that if they might win
that hold it should be greatly to their advantage and profit / for thanne they
thought to be masters of Roane / and of them in Auygnon. And on this purpose
they stubyed till at last they had cast their aduyce as I have herd reported
in this manner. G^yot d^ Pyn / and ye little Methyn rode with their company in
one night a fyftene leages / and in the morning at the brekynge of the day /
they came to the town of the bridge saint Spyryt and suddenly took it and all
that were within / ye which was great pity: for there they slew many an honest
person / and defoyled many a da(...) and wan such tychesse that it could (...)
/ and great puruyaunces to live (...) And so by that means they might r^nne at
their ^ase without danger / one ^^^son in to the realm of France / and
another time into the empire. So there assembled together all the companyons and
every day ran to the ^a^es of Auygnon where of the pope and (...) were in great
affray and dread. and to these companyons made there a soueraygne (...) among
them who was ever most ^omonly enemy to god and to the world.

Beside these there were in France great nombre of pyliers and robbers / what
of englysshmen gascoyns and almaygnes / who said they must needs live. And they
held still certain garysons and fortresses / for all that the king of
Englandes deputies had commanded them to avoid and to depart. How be it they
would not all obey wherewith the french king was sore displeased and all his
counsel but when these companyons in diverse places herd how these other
companyons had over thrown the lord of Bourbon and a two thousand knights
and squyers and taken many a good prisoner. And also had taken in ye town
saint E^pyrite so great richesse that it was a thyuge mcomparable: and
thinking how they were lykely to win Auygnon / or else to put to mercy the
pope and cardynalles and all the coutre of Prouynce. Tha^ they thought all to
depart and to go thither / for couetyse to (...) more / and to do more yuell
deeds. So that was the cause that diverse of them left up their fortresses and
went to their co^panyous / in hope to get more ^yllage. And when that p^pe
(...) and the college of To(...) were ^ered by these cursed p^opl^ the^ were
greatly abashed. And than (...) against these (...) christen people who did
their pain to distroy chr^s^^ndom^ as other bands had done before without
tytell of any reason / for they was^ed all the country without any cause / and
robbed without spa^yng all that ever they could get and (...) and de^oyled
women old and young without pytie and slew men women and children without
mercy doing to them no trespace. And such as did most shamefullyst deeds
were reputed with them most valiant. So than the pope and the cardynalles
preached openly (...) and assoyled (a pena ^t cul (...) all those that would
take on them this croy (...). And that would abandon their bodies will lyngly to
distroy these yuell people and their co^panyons / and there was chosen among the
cardynals sir Peter of Monstier cardynall of Arras called Dste to be chief
captain of y^ croysey. And mcontynent he departed out of Auygnon and went
and tarried at Carpentrase a s^uyn mile fro Auygnon and there he retained all
manner of soudyers such as would save their souls matteynyng to these said
perdous / but they should have none other wages / wherefore that tourney brake
for every man deperted* some into Lombardy / some to their own countries / and
some went to the said yuell company: so y^ daily they increased. So thus they
haryed the pope / the cardynals / and the merchants about Auygnon and did
much yuell till it was ferr into the somer season. In the year of our lord
god a thousand three hundred threscore and one.

THan the pope and the cardynals aduysed them of a noble gentle knight and a
good warryoure the marquis of Mounferrant who kept war and had done a long
space against the lords of Myllayne / y^ pope sent forhym. And so he came to
Auygnon and was honorably received of the pope and cardynals and so atreaty was
made with him by reason of a sum of money that he should have / to the intent
that he should get out of that ceuntre the said yuell co^panyons / and to
retain the^ with him in his wars of Lombardy. So than the marquis treated
with the captayns of the companyons / and by reason of threscore thousand
florens that they should have among them / and great wages that ye marquis
should give the^ / they agreed to depart and go with him into Lobardy / so they
might be assoyled (a pena ct culpa) all this was agreed / acomblysshed / and
the flore^s paid. And than they rendered up ye town saint Espyrite and left
the march of Auygnon and passed forth with the marquis / whereof king John^ of
France and all the realm were right toyouse / when they saw how they were
delivered of these yuell people / howbeit there were many that returned to
Burgoyn. And sir Seguyne of Batefoyle departed not out of ye garyl on of Ence /
for he would not leave it for no manner of (...) nor promise, but the realm of
France was in ferr better rest and peace than it was before. So when the most
part of the companyous were thus passed forth with the marquis into the land
of Pyemo^t. There the marquis did well his deuoyre against ye lords of
Myllayne: and conquered diverse towns castes / fortresses and countrees against
them and had diverse encountrynges and skyrmisshes with them to his honor and
profit. So that (...) in a year by y^ help of these (...) he had the better
hand / and in part had all his intent against the two lords of Myllayne of sir
Galeas. and sir Bernabe / who after raygned in gre^ prosperity.

SO it fortuned that sir Seguyn of Batefoyle / who was all that season in the
garyson of Ence on they river of So^^ie / took by scalyng a good cite in
Auuergne called B^od and therein he tarried more than a year and fortifyed it in
such wise that he douted nothing / and over ran the country to Cler(...) to
Ty^lacke / to Puy / to Case dieu / to Mou^tferant (...) Ryon / to Nonnet / to
Ussoyre and to ^udalle / and the land of the county Dalphyn the lord whereof
was the same time in hostage in England: and in these countrees he and his
company did much yuell. And when he had sore enpouerysshed the country there
about than by treaty he deperted and took with him great pyllage and treasure /
and so went to Gascoyne fro whe^s he came first. Of this sir Seguyn I can write
no more / but that as Iherde recou^ted he dyed maruelusly / god forgive him all
his trespaces. AMEN.

Of the death of the duke of Lancastre / and of the occasyon of the war
between the french kyng^ and the king of Nauer: and how the prince of wales
came into Acquitayne / and of the order that was taken in England. Cap. CC.
xv^.
IN this season de^ted out of the world in Englade the gentle duke of
Lancastre called Henry wher^^ the king and all the (...)nes / knights / and
squyers were right sorrowful: but they could not remedy it. And behind him he
left two daughters / the lady Maha^lt and the lady Blanch: and therle of
Heynault (...) wylliam son to the lord Loyes of Banyer (...) to the lady
Margarete of Heynalt married the younger suster / and the lord John^ earl of
Richmont son to the king of England had married the other suster / and was
duke of Lancastre by right of his wife. The lord James of Burbone abode still
pursuynge the treaty between the lord John^ of Mountfor(...) lord Charles of
Bloys for the right (...) chy of Bretayne / acordyng to the treaty (...) at
Calais as ye have herd before. And for (...) of concludyng thereof: great wars
and (...) felt after in the country of Bretayne / as ye shall here in this
history.

THe same season the french kyng^ was in purpose to go to Auygnone to (...)
the pope and cardynals / and to go through the (...) ^hy of Burgoyn the which
was newly fallen to him. So the king made ready for that journey: and departed
fro Paris about the se(...) saint John^ the Baptyst in the year of our lord.
M. CCC.lxii. And left Charles his eldest son duke of Normandy regent and
governor of his realm: and the king had with him his well-beloved cosyn the
lord John^ of Artoyse / and the earl of Tankernyll. / therle Dampmartyn /
Boucequant marshall of France and diverse other. And so long rode by his small
iourneys and with great dyspence taryeng in every (...)ne and city as he rode
through Bourgoyn / so that about the feast of saint Michaell he came to the
new town ^out Auyguon. And there his lodgyng was prepared for him and for his
company and there he was greatly ^^^lled by the pope and by all the hole coledge
/ and visyted each other often times. So thus the king tarried there all the
season of winter and about christmas pope Innocent departed out of this life.
And than there was a great dyscorde between the cardynals for choosing of a
new pope / for (...) of them would have had the dignyte / spe(...)ly the
cardynall of Boulay^^ and the cardynall of (...)ourt who were two of y^
grettell of the college: and so by their discencyon they were long in
dyscorde. And all the other (...)nalles finally did put all the (...) of the
matter unto the two foresaid cardynalles / who when they saw that they could
not have theymselfe the papal(...). Thau^e they concluded between them that
none of the other should have it. And than they did cho^^ and elect the abbot
of saint Uyctor of Mar^ell to be pope / who was a good devout and a holy man
and of virtuous lyueng: and a great clerk / and had greatly traueyled for the
church of Lombardy and other places. And ano^ after his creacion / y^ french
king understood that the lord Pi^r of Luzenon king of Cypre and of Hyerusalem
/ should come to (...) tos^ the pope / and how y^ he was past the s(...) (...)
the french king said he would tarry there till his coming / for he had great
desire to se him for the great goodness that he had herd reported of him: and
of the war that he had made against the sarazyns. For the king of Cypre had
newly taken the strong cite of Salate against the enemies of god / and slain
all that ever were within none except.

IN the same season and winter there was a great counsel in England on the
orderyng of the realm and specially on the kings children / for it was
co^sydred how yt the prince of wales held a great and a noble estate as he
might well do: for he was* a valyant man puissant and rich / and had great
heritage in Acq^^tayne where was habundaunce of all wealth and prosperity. Than
the king was counseled that he should send the prince his son into those
pattes / for he had land sufficye^t in that duchy to maynteyne withal his
dignyte and estate. And also all the barons and knights of acquitayne would
gladly have him among them / of the which they had made request to the king
for all that sir John Cha^dos was to the^ right courtelse and amyable. yet they
had rather have had their own natural soueraygne lord. The prince lightly
agreed to that ordinance and prepared for him self and for the good lady his
wife acordyng to their estates / and when every thing was ready they took leave
of the king and of the queen and of their brethren / and departed out of
England and aryued at Rochell In the same season departed out of this world the
king of Englandes mother Isabell of frau^re / daughter to king Philyp le Beau
/ sometime french king. And she was buried at the fre^r mynors in London right
nobly and reuere^tly there being all the prelates and barons of England and
the lords of France / such as were their in hostage: and this was or ye
prince and princes deperted out of England. And after this obsequy done they
departed and aryued at Rochell where they were received with great joy / and
there tayed the space of four days.

How the kings of France and of Cypre: took on them the croysey against the
mfydeles: and of the great purchase for that intent that the king of Cypre made
with many kings and princes in diverse places of christendom. Cap. CC.xvii.
AS soon as sir Johan Chandos / who had alonge season governed the duchye of
Acquitayne: herd how the prince was coming thither. Than he departed fro Nyort
and came with a goodly company of knights and squyers to y^ town of Rochell /
where he was well received with the prince and princes. And so the prince with
great honor and joy was brought into the city of Poycters: and thither came
to se him with great joy / the barownes and knights of Poy^tou and of
Xaynton. and there they did to him feaultie and homage / as they ought to do.
And than he went to Bordeaux and there tarried a long season and the princes
with him / and thither came to se him the earls / vycou^tes / barownes / and
knights of Gascoyne: and there they were received right ioyously. And ye
prince acquyted him self so nobly among them / that every man was well
content. And the earl of Foyz came thither to se the prince / who had great
chere and feast: And there was a peace made between him and the earl of
Armynake / the which a long space before made werr each on other. And than
anon after sir John^ Chandos was made constable of all the country of Guyene
/ and sir Guychart Dangle was made marshall. So thus the prince made such
knights of his house as he loved best great officers throughout the duchy of
Acquitayne* and tylled all constableshyppes and bayl^wykes with english
knights / who kept after great and puyssaunt astates: parauenture greatter
than they of the country would they had done / but the matters went not at
their ordynaunces.

Now let us leave to speak of the prince of wales and Acquitayne and of the
princes / and speak of king Johan of France / who was as than at the new
town without Auygnon.

ABout the time of candelmasse the year of our lord / a thousand three hundred
(...). King Peter of Cypre came to Auygnon / of whose coming the hole court
was greatly reioysed and diverse cardynalles went to mete him / and brought him
to the paleys to ye pope Urbayne / who right ioyously received him. And also so
did the french king / who was there present. And when they ha^^e (...) ^o
g^ther a certain time / and taken wine and spices / the two kings departed
fro the pope / and each of them went to their own lodgyng. And ye same season
there was a wage of ^atell before the french king / bitwene two noble and
expert knights / sir Aymon of Pommters / and sir Fouques of Archiac. and wha^
they had fought sufficiently / than the french king treated for a peace / and
accorded them to gether. And so all the lent season / these two kings ^aryed
there about Auignon / and often times they visited the pope / who received them
right ^^y^usly.

ANd often times when the king of Ciper was with the pope (the freche king
being present and the cardinals) he declared to them / how that for all
Christedome it should be a noble and a worthy thing to open the passage over the sea / and to go against y^ enemies of the Christen faith. The which words the
french king gladly herd / and pourposed in him self (if he might live.iii.
year) to go thither for two causes that moved him thereto / the first because
his father king Philyp had auowed so to do: and secondly to the intent thereby
to draw out of his realm all manner of men of war / called companyous / who
^ylled and robbed his country without any title / and to save their souls.
This purpose and entente the french king reserved to him self without any
word spekyng thereof / until good friday that pope Urban him self preched in
his chapel at Auignon / being present both kings / and the hole College of
cardinals. After that holy predicacion / the which was right humble and
much devout. The french king by great devotion took on him the Croysey and
swet^h^ required of the pope to accord and to consyrme his voyage: and the pope
lygh^ly agreed thereto: and so the king took it / and ^oith him sir Calleran
cardinal of Pierregourt / the earl of Artoise / the earl of Ewe / the earl
Dampmartyn the earl of Tankeruille / sir Arnolde Dandrehen / the great priour
of France / sir Boucequa^t and diverse other knights there present. And of
this enterprise the king o^ Cyper was right ioyouse: and thanked right heartily
our lord thereof / and reputed hit for a great syngular merit.

THus as ye may se and here the french king and the said / lords took on
them ^o wear above all their garments the (...) ^rosse: and our holy father
the pope (...) this voyage / and caused it to be preched in diverse places. I
shall she we you how the king of Cyper / who was come thither to (...) and
move this voyage / had great (...) to go and se the Emperor and all the high
baroues of the Empire / and so into England to se the king there / and so to
all the other great lords of ^^^^^en^ome. And thus as he purposed so he did /
as ye shall here after in this history. Our holifather the pope / and the
french king offered and promised him their bodies goods / and substances /
to furnysshe this voyage and gave him full power to publysshe the grace and
pardon of this holy voyage / thereby to cause all lords and princes the rather
to enclyne to this holy voyage. And so this king was so well beloved for the
reasons that he showed / and for the fair language that he uttered to the
lords of this voyage / that they had rather have herd him than any other
predicacion. and so on this point they re^^ed. Anon after easter / the year of
our lord. M. CCC.lxiii. the king of Cyper departed fro Auignon / and said he
would go and se the emperor / and lords of the Empire / and promised to
return again by Brabant / Flaunders / and Haynault / and so he took leave of
the pope / and of the french king who in all cases acquyted them right well
to ward him / and gave him many fair gy^tes and ^^^ wels / and pardons that ye
pope gave to him / and to all his men. And anon after the departyn^ of the
king of Cyper / the french king took leave of the pope / and went to the
town of Mo^^ pell^^er / to visit Languedor / where he had (...) been of a
long space before.

NO we let us speak of the king of Cy^ and of the voyage (...) he made He rode
so long by his ^ourne^^ / that he came into almayn into the cite of Pragne /
and there he found the / emperor of Almayne sir Charles of Behaigne / who
received him graciously and all the lords of the Empire that were there
present. And the king of Cyper tarried there a three wykes / and exhorted
greatly them of the Empire to this holy voyage: and in every place where he
passed through Almayne the Emperor paid for his Costs. Than the king of
Cyper went into the duchye of Jullyers / where the Duke made him right great
feast and ^here: and tha^ from thense he went in to (...)ante: where also the
Duke and duchess^ received him with great honor in the town of Bruzels with
diverse suppers / Justis / tournays / and other pastymes of honor / as they
could right well do hit: and at his departing they gave him great gifts and
ieowels. And than he went into Flanders to se the earl Loys. who in like wise
did greatly feast and honor him and specially at Bruges: and did so much that
the king Was Well content with him: And there he tarried that somer / always
exhortyng every man to this holy voyage: Whereof diverse lords had great joy
and desire to do it.

Of the french hostages that were in England: and of the purchase that the
king of Ciper made for this croisey. Cap. CC.xviii.
IN this season the king of England did grace to the iiii. french dukes that
were there ihostage: that is to say the Duke of Orleaunce / the duke of Aniou /
the duke of Berrey / and the duke of Bourbon. These lords were at Calais / and
yt king was content that they should ride about Calais by the space of.iiii.
days where they list So that ever at y^.iiii. days end they to come again
to Calais by son setting. And this the king of England did for a good
entente because they should the rather (in France) purchase for their
delyueraunce. These.iiii. lords thus being in Calais / sent messangers diverse
times to the french king / and to the duke of Normandy his eldest son /
desiring them to entende to their delyueraunce / according as they had
promised and sworn / when they entered into England / saying / else they would
take heed thereto them self / for they thought theymself as no prisoners: and
though that these lords were right nere of lignage to the king / yet for all
that their messangers were not herd / nor delivered to their pleasure /
Wherewith these lords were right sore displeased / and specially the duke of
Aniou who said he would right well provide for a remedy. The french king and
his counsel / and the duke of Normandy were sore besied / what for the voyage
of the Croysey that he had taken upon him: and for the wars that the king of
Navarre made in the realm / who had sent into Lombardy for certain of the
companyons to help him in his war. These were y^ causes / that they took no
regard to the lords that lay in hostage / that is to say to the
foresaid.iiii. dukes / nor to deliver their messangers / When they came into
France. And when the king of Ciper had visited these lords / and these said
countries / he rode so by his iourneys / that he came to Calais / where he
found.iii. of these said dukes / the duke of Orleaunce / the duke of Berrey /
and the duke of Bourbon: the duke of Aniou was gone into France / I can not
tell in what estate. These.iii. dukes as prisoners received the king of Ciper
into Calais right ioyously / and the king acquyted him to them right swetely:
and so they were there to guether.ii. days. Than the king of Cyper passed the sea / and arrived at Dover / and there tarried two days / and refresshed him
till all his carriage was vnshypped. Than he rode by small iourneys at his ease
/ till he came to London / and there he was honorably received and feasted / of
the lords of France that were there / and also by them of England / who were
sent to mete with him by the king of England as the earl of Herforde / sir
Gaulter of Manny / the lord Spenser / sir Rawoll Feryes / ser Guyshart of
Pe^nebruges / and ser Richard of Stury who accompanied and brought him to his
lodgyng in the cite of London. I can not recou^t to you in a hole day the noble
diners and suppers chere and feasts that was made to him by the king of
England / and the presents / gifts / and ieowels that was given him / and to
say^ truth / he was well worthy to hauehit / for he was come thither fro
far with great expense to exhort the king to take on him the red cross /
and to help to open the passage against gods ennemies / but the king of
England excused him self graciously / and right sagely.

SO than again the king of Cyper repassed the sea / and arrived at Boloyn and
herd in his way how that the french king and the duke of Normandy / the
lord Philyp his youngest son / and great part of his counsel should be at
the good town of Amyense / thither rode the king of Cyper / and there he
found the king / who was newly come thider and part of his counsel / and
there he was nobly received / and there recounted to them how he had spedde in
all his voyage / the which they were glad to here. And when the king of Cyper
had been there a certain space of time: than he said / he tought he had not
yet no thing done till he had seen the Prince of Wales / say enge that by
the grace of god he Would go and sehym / and the lords of Poictom and of
Acquitayne. The french king accorded well that he should so do / but he
desired him at his return / that he would come through France. And the king
of Ciper promised so ^o to. And thus he departed from Amience / and went
toward Beaunoyse / and passed the river of Seyn and at last came to Poicters.
At that time the prince was at Angolesme / where as he should keep a great
feast / Justis / and tournay / of.xl. knights / and as many squiers for the
love of the princess / Who was brought to bed of a fair son called
Edward. And as soon as the prince knew of the coming of the king of Ciper
/ he sent to mete with him / ser John^ Chaudos / and a great nombre of other
knights and squiers of his house / Who brought him With great joy and
reverence to the prince / who received him right honorably in all (...).

Now let us leave a while to (...) of the king of Ciper / and return to the
french king / and recount to what entencion he and his counsatle were come to
amience. I was as than enfourmed / and true hit was that king Johst of France
was inpourpos^ to go into England / to se king Edward his brother / and ye
queen his sister. And for that cause he had assembled there his counsel / as
at that time. and all they of his counsel could not make him to vary fro that
purpose: and yet they counsa^^ed him sore to the contrary. Diverse prelates
and barons of France said how he took on him a great folly / as to put him
self in the danger of the King of England: the king answered them and said:
Syrs I have found in the king of England my brother / and in y^ queen / and
their children / so much troth and honor / that I can not praise them to
much. Wherefore I doubt me nothing of them / but that they will be to me
right courtesse and true friend in all cases. Also I will excuse my son the
duke of Aniou of his returnyng into France To his words there were none that
durst say the contrary / sith he was so determined ihym self. Than the king
ordained again his son the duke of Norman dye to be regent and governor of
the realm of France until his return again. And there he promised to the
lord Philyp his young son / that at his return again / he would make him duke
of Borgoyn and heriter of that duchy. And wha^ all his purueyaunce was ready /
according to his intent and provision at Bolloyn before him / than he departed
from Amience / and rode till he came to Hedyn / and there kept his Christmas
day / and thither came to se him Loys earl of Flaunders / and there the king
tarried a.ii. or.iii. days And on Innoce^tis day he departed fro Hedin.

How king John^ of France returned into England where he dyed And how the
duke of Normandy defended him against the naueroyse: and how Mante and Meulent
were taken. And how sir Bremont de la ^all was discomfetted. Ca. CC.xix.
KIng John^ did so much by his iourneis / that he came to Boloyn / and lodged
in the abbay / and tarried there till he had wind at will / and with him was
sir John^ Artoyse Earl of Ewe / the Earl Dampmartyn / the great priour of
France (...) Boucequant Marshall of France / sir Tristram of Maguelles / sir
Peter and sir John^ Uillers / ser John^ of Anuil / ser Nicholas Braque and
diverse other knights and squiers. And when their ships were all charged and yt
ye mar^ners saw they had good wind they gave knowledge thereof to the king / and
so tha^ ye king entered into his ship about mydnyght and his people into other
ships: and so long they sailed / y^ they arrived in England at Dover / and
that was the day before the vigill of the Epiphany Anoue tidings came to the
king of England and to the queen / who were as than at Eltham a.vii. leages fro
London / that the french king was come a land at Dover. Than he sent thither
diverse knights of his house / as ser Bartilmewe of Brunes / sir Alayne of
Bouquesels / sir Richard of Pennebruge and diverse other They departed fro the
king and rode toward Dover / and found there the french king / and there
they made great honor and chere to him: and among other things they said
how the king theyrlorde was right joyous of his coming / and the french
king lightly believed them. And the next day the king and all his company
lepte on their horses and rode to Caunturburye and came thither to dinner / and
in entering in to the church of saint Thomas / the king did right great
reverence (...) offered to the Sh^y^^ a rich (...)* And (...)e the king tar^ed
t(...) And on the (...)de dare he departed and ^ood^ toward (...)dou and at
last^ came to (...)ame Where (...)king o^ England^ was with a great nom(...)
him / Who recey(...). His coming thy(...) after dinner and bitwene (...) there
was great dau^syng (...). There was the young lord of (...)ed him self to
dance and (...)t both french and english (...)old him* ^t became him so
(...) all that (...) he did. I can not she we all (...) honorably the king
of En^^ande and the queen received the french king (...) day they departed
from Elthame / (...) to London. So all manner of people (...) of the ^itie met
and received him (...) great re^er^ce / and he was brought with ^reat (...)
through London to his lodgyng to Sa^^y the which was ordained for (...). And
in the same castle were lodged such (...) his blodde as lay there in
hostage. First the (...) of Orleaunce his brother / and his son (...) duke of
Berrey / his ^osy^ the duke of Bout (...) the (...) of Alenson / Guy of Bloys /
the earl (...) Powle and diverse other. So thus y^ (...) king tarried there
part of that winter among the lords of his own blodde right joy (...) / and
often times the king of England (...) his children visited him / and the duke
of ^larence / the duke of Lancastre / and the lord ^^mon one of the kings
sons / and so diverse ^^mes they made great feasts to guether in dy^ers
^uppers / and in diverse other pastymes at his lodging of Sauoy. And when it
pleased ^he french king he went to the kings palaice of Westminster secret^y by
the river of Temes / and often times these two k^nges (when they met) ^^wayled
the lord James of Bourbon saying that it was great damage of him / and a great
mysse of him out of their company for it became him right well to be among
great lords.

Now let us leave to speak of the french king / and return to the king of
Ciper Who came to Aguillon to the prince of Wales his co^syn / who received him
right ioyously / and in like wise so did all y^ barons / knights and (...)ers
of Poictou / and of ^ainton / such (...) were about the prince / as the
vicou^t of Tho^^^ the young lord of Pouns / the lord of Per^^^ey / sir Loys of
^arcourt / (...) Guyssharde ^^^ngle: and of England s^r John^ ^handos (...)
Thomas Felton / sir Nowell Lorwiche / sir Richard of Pountchardon / sir Simon
Bassell / sir Ba^d wyn of Franuill / sir Daugorises and diverse other / as well
of the same cou^t^ey as of England. The king of Ciper was well honored and
feasted of the prince / and of the prin^esse / and of the said barons and
knights. And there he tarried more than a monethe / and than ser John^ Chandos
led him a sporting about in xainton and Poictow / and went and saw the
good town of Rochell / where he had ^east and there. And when he had visited
the country / than he returned again to Angolesme / and was at the great
feast that the prince held at that time / where there were great plen tie of
knights and squiets: and anon after y^ feast / the king of Ciper took leave
of the prince and of the knights of the country: but first he showed all
them principally wherefore he was come thither / and why he had taken on him
the ^edde cross that he ba^e / and how the pope had confermed it / and what
dignite and privilege perteyned to that voyage. and how the french king by
devotion / and diverse other great lords had enterprised / and sworn the same.
Tha^ the prince and his knights answered curtesly and said that truly it was a
voyage for all manner of men of honor to take heed of. And by y^ pleasure of
god (if the passage be ones open) he should not be alone / but he should find
them y^ would be glad to desire to auaunce their honors. Of these words the
king of Ciper was well content / and than departed: but sir John^ Chandos
held him company / till he was out of the principalite / and as I understood
he returned again into France to Paris / Wenynge to have found there the
king / but he did not / for the king was not returned out of England / for
he lay sore sick at his lodgyng at the Sauoy in London / and every day he
enpayred worse and worse / the which greatly displeased the king of England
/ and y^ queen for all his phisi^iens said he was in great pa^ell. And all
this knew right well the duke of Normandy / Who was at Paris / and had the
gouernynge of all the Realm of France / for sir Boucequant Was come out of
England and had enfourmed the Duke how it stood with the king his father.
The king of Navarre also knew the certaynte thereof / and was no thing sorye:
For he hoped (that if the french ^yng dyed) that the War / the Which he
made should be the better for him. And he wrote to the Captall of Beusm / Who
Was as than with the earl of Foyes / desyringe him to come into Normandy to him
/ saying how he would make him sovereign capt^ayne of all his retynewe. And
the captall departed fro the earl of Foyes and took his way to the king of
Nauer and as he went he desired certain knights and squyers to go with him /
howbeir that was but a few. So thus in the mean season while the captall was
thus coming to war^e the king of Nauerre / king John^ of France dyed in his
bed in England at the Sauoy in the city of London. Whereof the king of
England the queen and all their children / and many ^^o in England were right
sorry and heavy for y^ great honor and love that the king had to him / ever
sithe the peace was made bytwe^e them. Tha^ the duke of Orleau^ce his brother /
and the duke of Berry his son / who were right sorrowful for his death. sent
inco^tynent in great have word thereof over the sea to the duke of Normandy
whereof the duke was right sorry a^^ good reason why. Howbeit he knowing him
self successor of the heritage of France / and seeing how the king of
Nauerr daily fortifyed garysons against him / he thought it was time to provide
for good counsel and for remody (...) that behalf. All the same seasonne
there was a knight in Bretayne that took ever the french party / called sir
Bertram ^e Guescly^ the renown of him was not greatly known as (...) that
time saving among the knights of Bretayne that were about him / he was
abydinge still in Brerayne always making war for the lord Charles of
Bloys. And so in that con^tre this sir Bertram was reputed for a valya^t knight
/ and well-beloved with all men of war and was as than greatly in y^ duke of
Norma^des grace / for the great virtues y^ h^ herd reported of him. So that
whanthe duke had herd of the death of his father and dout^d greatly of the
king of Nauerre: than he said to sir Boucequant. Sir with such men as ye have
I will that ye ride in to Normandy and there ye shall find sir Bertram of
Guesc^yue. and look that you and he together make an army against the king of
Nauerr and keep surely the river of Seyne / sir Boucequant said it should be
done And so he departed and took with him a good nombre of knights and squyers
and took his way to Normandy by saint Germayns / and showed them that were with
him that he would go to the castle of Rolebosse / wherein were certain of the
companyons that did so m^che ^^yll throughout the world.

ROlebosse was a strong castle on the ^yuer of S^yne a leage fro Ma(...) /
and as at that time it was full of the companyons who made war as well on the
king of Nauer as on the french king / and they had a capy^^^ whom they obeyed
/ and he retained them by certain wages that he gave them / he was called
Ua^tayre Austarde an expert man of arm^s and a bold / and borne in the town
of Brusels And he and his company had robbed all the country about him / there
was none that durst go fr^ Paris and Maunt to Roane or to Ponthois^ and as well
they beat down y^ naueroyse as the frenchmen and specially they constrained
^ore them of Mau^t. When sir Bo^^equant parted fro Paris / he feigned to take
the way to Role^osse. howbeit he tarried at a certain place for sir Bertram of
Gu^scly^e and his company / who was ryden before to the castle of Deur^u^ an^
had spoken with them within / but they wold^ (...) no wise open their gates to
let him in / but fiersly did cast stones at him. When he saw that he
departed and went to the marshall sir Boucequant / where he tarried for him a
lytel^ fro Rolebosse. And when they were met together they were a five hundred
men of arms and so these two capitayns had great counsel together to s^ how
they should mayntene themself / and specially to get if they might the town
of Mau^t. Than they determined that s; Boucequaunt and a hundred with him
should ride to Maunt in have / as though they were sore afraid. and say how
that they of the garysone of Rolebosse did chase them / desyringe them to open
their gate and let them in for save guard of their lives. And if they were
let in than to take season of the gates / and than sir Bertram with all his
hole company should come and enter in to the town and do what they list / and
so they thought without they could get it by this manner they wist not how
else to get it. S^ this counsel was determined to be good and the lords
kept it secret among them self* and so thus sir Boucequant d^^^ed with this
said company and rode toward Maunte * and sir Bertram rode thyderwarde by
another way and put themself in a busshment nere to Mau^t / And when sir
Bouceq^uant aproched nere to Maunt * than they spar^led a broad like men (...)
were disco^fyted and chased. And so the knight sir Boucequant came to Maunt and
but. (...). with him the resydue came one after another. Than he called at y^
^arryers and said / a ye good people of Maunt open your gate and let us enter /
(...)r fold weth the yuell murdr^rs and the(...) Ro^eboyse who chaseth us and
has utterly disc^t^ted us. They within said sir what be you / (...) he I am
ser Boucequa^t marshall to the duke of Normady sent by him to have fought with
the^ of Rol^boyse / but the thieves wtin have (...) me so that it behooved me to
(...) whyder I would or not: and here they will ^ake me and all mine without ye
will open your gate and let us come in forsocour. And they with in answered
wenynge to them that his words ^ad ben true and said sir we know well yt they
(...) Roleboyse be our enemies and yours also / for they care not with whem
they have war: but also on the other part the duke of Normandy ha(...) of the
king of Nauer our lor(...) therefore we be in great dout lest we should (...)d
by you who is marshall of France. S^s (...) he by my saytheye shall have no
hurt ^y me / (...) am not come into this country but to (...) them of Roleboys.
And so by these wor^^^ they opened the gate and suffered sir Boucequant to (...)
and always little and little his (...)wed: so that between the hyndermast
(...)quantes men and the formast of sir (...)mes men they of Maunt had no
leaser (...)ne their gates. for sir Boucequant (...)n to a logyng and unarmed
him / there (...) to apease the^ of the town / and that they should na^
mystrust: but than sir Bertram and his company came galoppyng and entered in to
ye tow(...)d saint Jues Clesquy / to the death (...)eroyse. And so enterd into
the logyn^^^ and pylled and robbed all that ever they foun (...) and coke
prisoners and slew whom they list. ^^d the same season that they thus entered
into (...) / another company of bretons came to (...)ke but a leage thens and
entered therm (...)lly: for they said they were men of (...)nt thither by sir
Wyllyam of Gra^uyll (...) was at Maunt with as many mo as they (...). They of
Meul^^ thought their words (...) because they came the way fro Maunt and
(...)we well they could come none other way / (...)se the river of Seyn but at
the brige of (...) therefore they believed them and opened (...)ryers. And than
these bretons entered (...) the gate and cried saint yues Eles(...) people down
right who fled (...) themself as well as they might / (...) saw them self
so disceyued and be (...) hus was Maunt and Meulecke ta(...)t the duke of
Normandy was right (...) and the king of Nauer right sore displeased when he
knew thereof. Tha^ the king of Nauerr set good capitayns in all his towns and
castles / and took it for a great damage the loss of Mau^t and Meulec for by
them he had a fair enter into France. and ye same weke the captall of Beusz
arrived at Chyerbourge with a four hundred men of arms / and the king of
Nauerr made him great fest and there / and showed him in manner of a co^playnt
how the duke of Normandy had caused the towns of Maunt and Meuleck to be
stolen fro him. Than the Captall answered and said / sir and it please god we
shall go forward / and I trust shall speed so well that we shall have them
again and many mo. It is said how the duke of Normandy is going to Reins to
be crowned / we shall go and do him some noyaunce and damage. Thus of y^
coming of the Captall of Beusz was yt king of Nauer right ioyouse and said yt
inco^tynent he would make a journey in to France / than he send for men of
war in to all parts where he coudymagen to have any. The same season there
was in Normandy the Marne a knight of England who or that time had been with
the king of Nauerr in his wars. He was a right well expertman of arms and
was called sir John^ Jonell / he had in his company a three hundred men of
arms. The king of Nauer sent to him / desyringe that he would come and serve
him with such nombre as he had. This knight condyscended to the kings desire
and came to him and put him into his service. The duke of Normandy knew right
well how the king of Nauerr assembled an army / and how the Captall should be
chief captain. Than he wrote to sir Bertram of Clesquy desyring him and his
breto^s to keep fronter war with the king of Nauer / promysyng to send him
people ynowe to fight against the power of the king of Nauer. And he ordained
that sir Boucequa^t should tarry and keep Mau^t and Meulec. And so sir Bertran:
and his company of bretons went toward Uernon. In a short space after the
duke of Normandy send to him a great nombre of men of war: as therle of Aucer
/ the vycount Beaumount the lord Beauiewe / and diverse other knights and
squyers. In the same season there was come in to France to serve y^ duke of
Normandy out of Gascone the lord Dalbret and sir Aymon of Punyers / sir
Peteton of Corton / y^ Soldyche of Lestrad and diverse other. whereof the duke of
Normandy could the^ great thank^ desyring the^ to ride into Normandy against
his enemies. These lords obeyed the duke and rode all into Normandy / except
the lord Dalbret / who tarried still with the duke: but his men rode forth in
that journey. Also in the same season on the fronters of Bretayne there was a
breton knight of the french party called Beamont of the Uale / and had in his
company a.xl. speres all bretons / and they came before Eureur / and within the
town there was a knight called sir Guy of Granuyll. Alsone as he herd the fray
he armed him and all his soudyers and mounted ontheir horses and rode out into
the field / and by that time sir Beamont had done his enterprice and was
departing: than sir Guy of Grauyll asctyed him and said Beaumount ye shall not
thus depart. First ye must speak with them of Eureux / they shall teache you
to know them. When sir Beamont herd that / he turned his horse and laid his
spear in the rest and came against sir Guye. the two knights met rudely
toguyder / son that their spears sheuered all to peaces / but they satte so
surely that none of them fell. And so they passed forth in their course / and
at their retournynge they drew out their swerdes and therewith their co^panyes
met / at which time there were many borne to the yerthe on both parties.
There the br^tons acquyted them self valiantly / howbe it finally they could
not obtain the place: but were feign there to abide for people came still out
of the town on the^ so that they were all slain and taken none escaped. And
there was taken sir Beaumont dela Uale / by sir Guy of Granuyll who led him
as his prisoner into the castle of Eureur / (...) so were all the resydewe
such as were taken. Thus it happed of this adventure whereof sir Guy was
greatly praised and beloved of the king of Nauer and of them of Eureux.

Here begins the feats of war done (...) the time of king Charles the
(...) whereof the beginning speaks of the obsequy of king John^. and how the
young king Charles was honorably crowned at Reins / and of the great expe^ses
that was done there. and of the beginyng of the batell of Cocherell.
THus asye have herd before / the king of Cypre returned into France and came
to Paris to the duke of Normandy / and there was the dukes brethren / the duke
of Ani^ou / and the lord Philyp who was after duke of Burgone. And all they
tarried for the body of ye (...) ge their father the which was coming out of
England and the king of Cypreholpe them to compain the death of the king /
and was maruey lously displeased therewith / because of the hyndringe of his
vyage of the croyse. and so he cl^thed him self with the vesture of doloure.
So the day came thar the body of the french king aproched to Paris / the which
body was brought thither by therle of Artoyse / therle Da^marten / and the great
priour of France / the duke of Normandy and his brethren. The king of Cypre
and the most part of all the clergy of Paris went a foot and met with the body
beyond saint Denyce in France / and there he was solemply buried / and
tharchbysshop of Sencesang the mass. And after the service done and the dinner
the which was right noble: the lords and prelates returned to Paris / and
there they held a parlyament and general counsel to determyne how the realm
should be ordered / for ye realm might not long be without a king. And than it
was counseled by thaduyce of the prelatis and nobles of the realm that they
should draw to the cite of Reyns and there to crown the duke of Normandy / who
as yet was called none other wise. also he wrote to his uncle Uyncelant duke of
Brabant and of Luze^burge / and also to therle of Fla^ders desyring them to be
at his coronacyon on Trinyte sunday next coming. In the same sca son while the
lords made their puruey aunce for the kings coronacyon. The frenchemen and
naueroyse aproched nere together in Normandy / for into the cite of Eureux was
come the Captall of Beuz who made there his assemble of men of war / and of
companyons such as he could get. Now let us speak of him and of sir Bertram
of Clesquy / and of a journey of battle between them. The tuesday before
T^^nyte sunday that the duke of Norma^ndy should be crowned king / as he was
in the cathedral church of Reyns. When the captall of Beusz had made his
assemble in the cite of Eureux of archers and brigans. and left in the city a
capyten called sir Mychell Dorgery / and sent to Couches the lord Guy of
Grauyll to keep fronter war. Than he departed fro Eureur with all his men of
arms and archers / for he herd say ^ow the frenchmen were abroad / but he wist
not where they were* than he took the feldes and had great desire to ^ynd the
and (...)red his company / and ^^^de yt he was to the some of. v^^. C. spetes.
iii C. archers (...). (...). C. of other men of war. And with h^^ were diverse
good knights and squiers and specially a baneret of the realm of Nauer called
y^ lord of Sal^ / an expert man of arms. but he y^ held y^ gr^^t^st some of
men of arms (...)ers in all the company was a knight of England called sir
John^ Jo^ell / there was also ye lord Peter of Sauyle / (...) Will^ of Grauyll
/ ye lord Bertra^ of Fra^ke / y^ Blassoll of marenell / (...) ^^uers other all
in will to encounter ser Bertra^ of Clesquy and to fight with h^^. Tha^ they
drue to Passy and to ye b^^ge of tharch / for they thought (...) the frenchmen
should pass ye river of Seyne there if they ware not passed all ready. So it
happed y^ the friday in the whytson w^ke y^ captall and his company rode out of
a wode / and by aue^ture they met a haraude of arms called king Faucon: and
the same morning he was deperted fro y^ french host. as soon as the captall
se him he knew him well and made him great ^her / for he was ^^e^^yng to y^
king of England. Tha^ he ^^mau^ded of him fro whens he ^ame and if he k^^we any
tidings of the frenchmen* sir quod he in the name of god I know well where
they be. I depted fro them to day / they seek you as well as ye do them where be
they quod the captall beyond the b^^ge of tharche or a this side. Sir quod
Fau^on they be passed y^ bridge at Uernon / and as I believe they a^ now about
Passy. What no^bre ^e they quod the captall and what cap^tens have the^ I pray
you show me: ser quod Fau^on they are well a. (...). C. fightyng men. and there
is sir Bertra^ of Clesquy who has y^ grettest company of breto^s / also there
is therle of Aucer / y^ vycount of Beamont y^ lord Loys of Chalon / y^ lord
of Bea(...) / y^ master of the cross bows / tharchpreest the lord Edward of
Remy. and of Gas^one there is the company of the lord Dalbret and the lord
A^mon of Punyers / y^ lord of Suldyche and of L^strad: and when y^ captall
herd those gascons named / he marueyled greatly and blussed for dyspleasure and
said / Faucon is this true ye say / yt these lords of Gascone ar there / and
the lord dal br^t^s c^pany. sir quod the harald ye ^out fail / and where is y^
lord Dalbret hiselfe quod the captall / ser quod Faucon he is at Paris with y^
rege^t duke of N^rm^dy who aparelleth hiselfe to go to Reins for it is said y^
on sunday next coming he should be crowned king. Than y^ captall laid his hand
on his own^ heed and said in great displeasur by saint Antones cap / gascon
against gascone. sir quod Faucon here by taryeth for me a harald of tha^chprest
sent to speak with you fro him / and as I understand by y^ harald tharch priest
would speak with you. Than the captall said a Faucon say to y^ french haralde
he need not to go any farther / let him show to tharchprest y^ I will not
speak with him. Than ser Johan Jonell stepped forth and said / sir why wyllye
not speak with him perauentur it is for our pro^yte / than y^ captall said nay
I warrant you it is not for our profit / for tharchprest is so great a brauler
y^ if he come to us he will but ^angle. and in ye mean time ymagen our
strength and auewe our no^bre / the which paraue^ture shall torn more to our
pre^^dyce than advantage / therefore I have no have to speak with him: tha^
Faucon y^ harau^ went to the other haraud where as he tarried under a hedge / and
excused y^ captall so wisely that he was well content / and than he went to
tharchprest and showed him all as Faucon had said. Thus the frenchmen and naue
royse had knolege each of other by y^ report of the two haraldes and aparelled
the^self echeto mete other. and when (...) captall had herd by Faucon what
no^bre the frenchmen were than inco^tyne^t he sent certain messa^gers to y^
cite of Eu^eu^ to ye capten there / desyringe him to send out of the cite all
manner of co^panyons and other yt were able for the war / and yt they should
mete with him about Cocherell / for there he thought to find the frenchmen:
for surely he said wherso ever they met he would fight with the^. And when
these tidings came to y^ capten of Eu^eu^ named (...) Ledger Dorgery / than he
commanded every man y^ was able to ride a horse / should go out of the cite
and draw to y^ Captall: and so there deperted out of the town ^^o than
sixscore / all young men of the na^yon of y^ town. So y^ wednysday the Captall
lodged by noone on a mountain and his company about him: and the frenchmen
(...)de forward to find the^ till they ca^e to a river called in yt country
Iton / the which ran toward Eureux: and it springs nere to Couches and there
they lodged y^ wedn^sday in a fair medowe a long by yt ryuersyde. and so the
next mor^yug both parties sent out their c^^ rous to se if they could here any
tidings each of other / and so each of the^ made report that they were within
two leages together. Than y^ naueroyse rode as Faucon led the^ the same way he
came fro the^ / and so about noone they came into the way to Cocherell: and
there they saw y^ frenchmen before the^ in orde^yng of their ^a^els / and there
was great no^bre of baner^ (...) ^eno^s so y^ they seemed to be double the
^ombre y^ they were in deed. Than the naueroyse rested them without a little
wode that was there: than the capitayns drue together and ordered their batayls
First they made three batayls well and proply all a foot and sent all their
caryages and pages in to y^ little wode: and they set sir John^ Jonell inthe
first battle withal the men of arms and archers of England. The second
battle led the captall of Beusm / and in his battle were (...) iiii. C.
fighting men one and other. and (...) him was the lord of Saulx of Nauer a
young lusty knight / the lord Wyll^^ of Grauyll and ser Peter of Sankeuyll. The
third batell was led by three knights / yt is to say the lord of Bascles of
Ma^nell / the lord Bertram of Frank and the lord Sans^lo^yns / they were
a.iiii. hundred. And when they had ordained their batayls / than they took the
vau^tage of a little hill there beside on their right hand between them and the
wode. And so on the front of that hill they aranged them self before their
enemies / and they set the captals baner on a busshe of thorns and set a.lx.
men of arms about it to defend it fro their enemies. And y^ they did to
thentent that if they were sparkeled abroad they should draw to the standarde:
and so determined not to dyscende down fro the mountain for no manner of cause
/ but to let their enemies come to the^ / if they would fight with the^.

How by the polesy and counsel of sir Bertram of Clesquy the nau^^oise
dysce^ded down fro the mountain to fight with the frenchmen and how the
captall was taken. Cap. CC.xxi.
THus as ye have herb the naueroyse and englysshmen were arenged on y^
mountain while the frenchmen ordered their batayls / where of they made three and
a rere guard. The first had sir Bertram of Clesquy with all his bretons / and
he was ordained to re^co^ the captals battle. The second had therle of Aucerr
/ and with him there was the vycount Beamond / and the lord Baudwy^ ^enekyn
master of the cross bows / and with the^ were frenchmen / pycardes / and
normayns. as sir Edward of Rency / sir Ingram of He^yn / sir Loys of
^enekerques / and diverse other good kynght^ and squyers. The third battle had
the archpreest and the burgonyons / and with him the lord of Chalons / the
lord Beau^e^ the lord John^ of Uyen and diverse other: and this battle was
assigned to assemble against the b^scle of Marnell and his rout. And the
batayl^ which was the reregarde were all gascoyns / whereof sir Aymon of
Pomyers / the lord Sul dyche of^e strade / the lord perducas Dalbreth and the
lord Peteton of Curton were soueray g^e capitayns. Than these gascoyne
knights aduysed well the behauynge of the captall and how his standarde was
set on a busshe and kept with a certain nombre: than they said yt it behooved
them wha^ their batayls were assembled together / that they should endeavor
themself to co^quere the captals standerde. saying how it they might get it
their enemies should be sone disco^fyted. also these gascons auysed the^ on
another ordinance / the which was to the^ that day right profitable. The
lords of France were along space together in counsel how they should
mayn^tene themself / for they saw well that their enemies had a great
advantage. Than the gascons spoke a word the which was well herd: they said
sirs we know well that the captall is as worthy a knight as can be found in
any land / for as long as he is able to fight / he shall do us great damage.
let us ordain.xxx. a horsbacke of the best men of arms that be in our company
/ and let the.xxx. take heed to nothing but to address themself to the
captall / while we e^tend to co^quere his standerd: and by y^ might of their
horses let them break y^ prea^ so that they may come to the captall / and than
take him and carry him out of the field / for with / out that be done we shall
have no end of our battle / for if he may be taken by this means the journey
shall be ours / his people will be so sore abashed of his taking. Than the
knights of France and of Bretayne acorded lightly to y^ ^euyce and said it
was good counsel and so they would do. Than among the^ they chose out. xxx of
the best men of arms among them / and mounted on.xxx. of the best horses in
all the company / and they drew them a side in the field well determined of
that they should do: and all the resydue tarried in the field a foot in good
array. When they of France had well ordered their batayls and that every man
knew what he should do: than there was a comonyng among the^ what should be
their cry y^ day / and to what ban^^ they should draw to. And so they were
determined to cry our lady of Aucerr / and to mak^ their captain yt day
cherle of Aucerr / but the earl would in no wise agree thereto to take that
charge on him: but excused himself right graciously saying lords I thank you
of ye honor that ye would put me to. but surely as for me I will not thereof
for I am over young to have such a charge or honor: for this is ye first journey
yt ever I was at therefore ye shall take another. here be many good knights /
as sir Bertram of Clesquy tharchprest / the master of ye crosbose the lord
Loys of Chalon / the lord Aymon of pomyers and sir Edward of Re^cy. These
have been in many great journeys and they know how to order such a matter
better than I can / therefore I pray you hold me excused. Than ye knights
regarded each other and said to him / a noble earl of Aucer ye ar ye gretest
among us both of land and lynage / therefore of right ye ought to be our heed.
Certainly sirs quod he ye say as it pleseth you / but this day I shall be as one
of your copanyons and shall live and dye and bide mine aue^ture with you / but
as for ye soueraynte surely I will none thereof. than they beheld each other and
aduysed whom they might make chief capiten Than they were auysed yt the best
knight in all their company and he that had been best proved was sit Bertra^ of
Clesquy: tha^ it was ordained by their common acorde yt their cry should be yt
day our lady Clesquy / and that they should all obey y^ day to sir Bertra^: all
things ordained and stablysshed and every lord and knight under his own
sta^derd or penon. Than they regarded their enemies / who were a hye on ye hill
and would not depart fro there strength / for they thought it not / the which
greatly anoyed the frenchmen because it was yuell mou^tyng of yt hill / and also
the son^e was very hot / the biggest of the^ were faint for they were fasting
/ and they had another wine nor vitayle with the^ that did the^ any good /
without it were certain lords yt had little flagons of wine the which were anon
empty / nor they made ye morning no provision for vitayle / for they had
thought to have fought with their enemies the same morning but they did not /
but they escryed as nere as they might the naueroyse and englysshmen: and so ye
day was ferr gone or they could be assembled together. And when the lords of
France saw the behauyng of the naueroyse than they drue the^ toguyder in
manner of counsel to de^myne whyder they should go and fight with their enemies
or not / so they were of diverse opinyons. some would go fight with them sayng it
should be great blame to the^ to do otherwise. Some yt were sad and well
a^ysed argued ye contrary / and said if we go and fight with the^ where as they
be in the auau^tage it shall be to our great perell / for of.v. of us they will
have.iii. so finally they would not agree to go to them for dangers yt might
fall. And ye naueroyse aduysed well their manner and said among themself /
behold yonder our enemies they will come anon to fight with us / besemyng they
make the^ ready thereto. There were certain knights and squyers normayns
prisoners with ye naueroyse / and they were let go on their faythes: and they
went privily into the french host and said to the lords there. sirs auyse you
well for and ye let this day pass with out batell yor enemies will be to morrow
greatly reco^forted / for it is said among the^ yt the lord Loys of Nauer
should come to the^ with a.iiii. C. speres. so these words enclyned the^
greatly to fight with their enemies how soever they did / and so made the^ ready
to have set forward and at that point they were a three or four times / but
ever ye wysemen held the^ back and said / sirs let us abide a little space
and se what they will do / for their hertes arso great and presu^ptuous yt they
would as gladly fight with us as we with the^. there were many overcome with
hete of ye son^e / for it was tha^ about noon and they had fasted all the day
and were armed and sore chafed / and said among the^ if we go up this hill to
fight with the^ we are all lykely to be lost / therefore let us draw as for this
day to our logyng / and to morrow let us take other counsel: thus they were in
diverse opinyons. when the lords and knight of france saw ye gouernyng of
the^glysshmen and of the naueroyse / and how yt they would not deperte out of
the hold yt they were in and that it was hye noon of the day / and also had
herd ye words yt the prisoners y^ came fro the^ had said. and also saw ye
most perte of their people sore traueyled with the hete of ye son the which
was to the^ right displesant. Than by thaduyce of sir Bertram of Clesquy they
took other counsel / for he said sirs we se well yt our enemies desires sore
to fight with us / howbeit they will not discende out of their hold without it
be by the means yt I shall show you. Let us make semblant to wtorawe back
and not to fight as this day / and also our people ar sore traueyled with hete
/ and let us send our varlettes / our caryage / and our spare horses over the
bridge and water: and let us withdraw back to our lodgyng. and in our going
back let us be ready to turn again if need be / and let us se what they
will do if they be wyllyng to fight with us they will dyscend down the hill to
chase us: and if we se that they do so / than let us be ready to turn again
on them / and than we shall deal with them the more easily. This counsel was
accepted of all the company / than every lord drew him under his own
standerd / and than they caused their tru^pettes to sown the retrayt. and
commanded all knights / squyers / and varlets to pass the bridge and to carry
over all their caryages. So thus they passed over / and some men of arms
passed after fayntly. when ser John^ Jonell who was an expert knight / and had
great desire to fight with the frenchmen saw the manner of the^ how they drue
back: than he said to the captall sir let us go quickly after them / se you
not how they do fly away / a said the captall trust not thereto / they do it
but for an yuell intent and to begyle us. Than sir John^ Jonell auau^ced
himself for he had great desire to fight with his enemies sayng to his company
saint George / who soever loves me let the^ follow for I will go and fight
with our enemies. And so took his spear in his hand and went forth before
all the batayls and dyscended down the hill and some of his company / or the
captall knew thereof. But when he saw yt sir John^ Jonell was gone to fight
without him he took it of great presu^pcyon and said to the^ about him / sirs
let us go down the hill quickly for sir John^ Jonell shall not fight without
me. Than the Captall and his company auaunced them down the hill / and when
the frenchmen saw the^ descend fro ye hill and came into the plain feldes /
they were right ioyouse and said: lo now we may se that we have desired all
this day. And so suddenly turned and cried our lady Clesquy and dressed their
baners against ye naueroyse / and so assembled together all a foot. and ser
John^ Jonell who coragiously assembled his baners against ye battle of the
bretons of whom ser Bertram was chief captain did many a feat of arms /
for he was a hardy knight. Thus the knights and squiers sparcled abroad in the
plain and fought together with such wepyns as they had / and each of them
entered into others battle and so fought with great courage and will: the
englysshmen and naueroyse cried saint George / and the fre^chemen our lady
Clesquy. There were many good knights on the french part / as sir Bertram of
Clesquy / ye young earl of Aucer / the vycou^t Beamont / ser Baudwen Denekyn /
ser Loys of Chalon / ye young lord of Beauieu / and sir Antony who yt day rered
his baner / sir Antony of Daneskerly / ser Edward of Re^cy / ser Ingram of
Hedyn. and also of gascoyns / first ser Aymon of pomyers / ser Perducas
dalbreth / ser Suldych de le strade / ser Peteton of Corton and diverse other of
that sort. And the gascoyns dressed them against the captall and his company
and they (...) against the^ / they had great desire to mete each with other /
there was a sore battle and many a noble feate of arms done and acheued / a
man ought not to ly willyngly. It might be deman^ded where was tharchpreest all
this season who was a great captain / and had a great company under his rule
/ because I make no mencyon of him. I shall show you the truth / as soon as
the archpreest saw the battle begin he get him self out of the prease /
but he said to his company / and to him that bare his standerd. I charge you
all as ye love me or fere my displeasur / that ye abide the end of the battle
and do your deuours as well as ye can^e. but as for me I will depart and not
return again / for I may not as this day fight nor be armed against some
knight that is in the field against us: and if any demand for me answer them
as I have showed you before. So thus he departed and but one squyre all only
with him / and so he repassed the river and let the remnant deal. and so the
resydue of the field mist him not / for they saw his baner and company to
the end of the battle / wherefore they believed surely yt he had been there
personally. Now shall I show you of ye bataile and how it was ended

AT the beginning of the battle when sir Johan Jonell was come down the hill
and his company with him / and the Captall also and his company trusting to
have had the vyctorie. How beit the case turned otherwise / and saw that the
frenchmen turned them in good array and order / than they perceived well how
they had been to hasty to come fro their advantage. Howbeit like valyant
knights they basshed nothing / but thought to win the victory with their
hands in plain field. And so a little they reculed back and assembled
together all their people / and than they made way for their archers to come
forth on before who as than were behind them. And when the archers were
forward than they shot fiersly together / but the frenchmen were so well
armed and so strongely pauyssed / that they took but little hurt / nor let
not for all that to fight. And so entered in among thenglysshmen and naueroyse /
and they in likewise among them: so that there was between them a cruel battle
/ they took by strentgh of arms and wrestlyng: speres / ares and other wepyns
each fro other / and took prisoners on both parts. Thus they fought hand to
hand so valia^tly y^ it was marueyle to be hold ^o ye may well believe y^ in
this great preas and parell there were many overthrown and stay^e for there
were none y^ spared other I say to you plainly y^ frenchmen had no need as tha^
to sleep for they had in hand people hardy and full of courage. Wherefore it
behooved every man to aquyte themself valyantly / and to defend their bodies
and keep their country and to take their advantage when it came at the point /
or else they had been all disconfyted. Surely the bretons and gascons did acquyte
themself right well y^ day and did many a noble feate of arms. Now shall I
show you of y^.xxx. y^ were appointed to set on the captall who were right well
horsed, they took head to nothing else but to the executyng of the^^ enterprice
y^ they had in charge: so all together ca^e on the captall where as he was
fyghtyng with a great axe in his hand and gave therewith so great strokes y^
none durst aproch nere him / but these.xxx. by force of their horses brake the
pease and came on the captall and by clean for^e they took him. Than began the
batayls sore in every place for the captals men cried to y^ rescue / how be it
all their pain au^yled them nothing / for y^ captal was carried out of y^ field
at which time it was herd to tell who had y^ bett.

How thenglysshmen and naueroyse were disco^fyted at the battle of Cocherell
/ and how y^ young king of France made his brother duke of Burgoyne / and of
the castles and fortresses that were after won. Cap. CC.xxii.
IN this great battle where that thenglysshmen and naueroyse intended to
follow to rescue the captall whom they saw carried away before them: and of the
french perte sir Aymon of Pomyers / ser Petyton of Corton / sir Souldyche de
la strade / and the lord Dalbretes company: they intended with a coragyous
will to dress the^ toward the captals standerd that stood on a busshe. There
was than a sore battle / for the standerd was well defended with good men of
war / and specially with sir Bascle of marnell / and sir Geffray of Rouselone*
there was many rescues and many one hurt and cast to the earth. Now beit the
naueroyse y^ were about the standerd were overthrown and the Bascle of Marnell
slain / and sir Geffray of Rouselone taken prisoner: and sir Aymon of Pomyers
no man could tell what became of him whider he were slain or taken. And when
the captals sta^derd was taken and torn all to peaces / in the mean season
the bretons / frenchmen / pycardes / normayns / and the burgonyons fought
valia^tly the which stood the^ well in hand to do / for y^ naueroyse had caused
the^ somewhat to recule* and there was deed of the french pertie / y^ vy count
Beamont y^ which was great damage / for he was a lusty young knight / and was
lykely to have pued a noble man: and his company with great pain carried him
out of the field / as I herd recounted of the^ of both perties. It had not
bensene aforei such a batell with such a nombre to be so well fought as this
battle was / for they were all a foot hand to hand: and were meddled together
each pertie with other / and fought with such wepyns as they had and there was
many a great stroke given with ares of steell. and there was sore hurt ser
Petyton of corton and sir Suldich de la strade / in such wise y^ they could do
no more good y^ day. Sir John^ Jonell by whom the batell began / did y^ day
many a feate of arms and was hurt in diverse places of his body: and finally he
was taken prisoner by a squire of Briten of the company of ser Bertra^ of
Clesquy and was carried out of y^ prease. but there was slain of y^ french
pertie y^ master of y^ crosbowes and sir Loys of Hennebreq^ and diverse other.
and of y^ naueroyse y^ lord of saul^ and many of his men: and the same day
dyed prisoner ser John^ Jonell / and there was taken ser Wyllm^ of grauyll / ser
Peter of Sankuyll / ser Geffray of rouselon / ser Bertram of Fra^ke and diverse
other but a few of y^ naueroyse saved / they were nere all taken or slain in
y^ place. This battle was in normandy nere to Cocherell on a tuesday / the
xxiiii. day of May / y^ year of our lord. M.iii. C.lxiiii. After this
disco^fytur and y^ all the deed were dispoyled and every man taking head to his
prisoners / and dressyng of the^ y^ were hurt / and y^ the most part of the
frenchmen were repassed y^ bridge and drawyng to their lodgyng right sore
traueyled and weary. The same season ser Guy of Grauyll son to sir Wyllm^ of
grauyll was departed y^ same morning fro y^ garyson of Couches with a.l. speres
/ to thentent to have come to the captall or y^ battle began / wherefore they
made great haste and came to the place where as the battle had been. Than the
frenchmen that were behynd cried to their company sayng to to^ne again sirs /
behold here comes mo of our enemies. And sir Aymon and his company were there
ready / and when he saw the naueroyse he set his sta^derd a high on a busshe /
to cause the frenchmen to draw thither. and when ser Guy herd them cry our lady
Clesquy / and sa^e not the captall nor none of his company but saw much people
lie deed on the ground / than he parceyued well that the naueroyse had been
disconfyted / and than he returned the same way he came. And y^ euenyng the
frenchmen took head to their prisoners. Than there was much spekyng and
enquiring for the archpreest / when it was known y^ he was not at the battle*
and his men excused him as well as they could: and the.xxx. y^ took the captall
never seassed till they had brought him to the castle of Uernon. And the next
day the frenchmen dysloged and went to (...)one / and there left part of
their prisoners.

Df the coronacyon of king Charles the fyfte. Cap CC.xxiii.
ON trinyte sunday the year of our lord a. M. CCC.lxiiii. king Charles so^e
and heir to king John was crowned and sacted king in the great church of our
lady in Reyns / and also the queen his wife / dought to duke Peter of Burbone
by tharchebysshop of the same place. And there was present king Peter of Cypre /
the duke of Anion / the duke of Burgone / sir Uyncela^t of Behayne duke of
Luzenburge and of Brabant / the earls of Ewe and of Da^pmactyn / of Takernyll /
and of Ua^demont: with many prelates and other lords / and in the cite was
great feeltes and solemnytees.v. days. Than the king departed and went to
Paris. It can not be recounted in a hole day the sole^nyties and great f^stes
that they of Paris made them. The lords returned into their own countrees
such as had been there at the kings coronacyon.

AT the kings coming to Paris / his youngest brother was put in possessyon of
the duchy of Burgone / and so departed fro Paris with a great no^bre of men:
(...) went and took lyuery / season / and homage / of the barons knights /
cytes / castles / and good towns of the duchy of Burgone. And when he had
visited his coutre he returned to Paris: and the same season tharchpreest
apesed the kings displeasur by such excusacions as he laid for himself / in
y^ he was not at the journey of Cocherell / showing how he might not be armed
against y^ captall / the which captall at y^ request of the lord Dalbret was
let out of prison on his faith and troth the which captal aided greatly to
excuse arch priest to the king and to other knights of France such as spoke
yuell of him. Also he had as the newly overthrown in Burgone beside Dyuyn
a.iiii. C. co^panyons and pyllers of the coutre where of Gyllot du Pyn / Talbert
/ tacylbordon / and John^ the Chafour were capitayns. The same season the king
caused to be beheded ser Peter Sanguyll in the city of Rone / because he was
become naueroyse / and sit Grauyll had been in y^ same case and sir Guy his son
had not be who sent word to y^ king y^ if he put to death his father he would
in like wise serve sir Beamon de la Uale a great lord of Bretayne / who he had
as prisoner. wherefore his lynage and kynred did somoch by their suit to y^ king
/ y^ there was an exchange made between sir Beamon and sir grauyll / and each
delyuerd for other. In this season ser Bertra^ of Clesquy gate again y^
castle of Roleboyse for.vi. M. fra^kes y^ he paid to y^ capten thereof named
Uaster / who returned again to Braba^t fro whens he came. yet there were
diverse co^panyons y^ held still sudry for tresses in Calr normandy / perch
because / and in other placs y^ which did much hurt and trouble in y^ realm of
France: some in the title of y^ king of Nauer / and some in their own quarrel
to rob the country without reason or true title. The french king sent his
brother y^ duke of Burgone against these pyllers / and so the duke made his
somons in y^ cite or Charters. Tha^ he drue into the field and with him ser
Bertram of Clesquy sir Boucequa^t / therle of Aucer / sir Loys of Chalon / y^
lord of Beauieu / ser Aymon of Punyers sir Rauenall / y^ begue of vyllayns /
ser Nicholl of Line master of the crosbowes / ser Edmarde of Ra^cy / ser
Ingra^ of Hedyn: and to the no^bre of.v. M. fighting men. And when they saw
they were so great a no^bre they divided in three ptes whereof sir Bertram of
Clesquy with. M. wet toward Co^sta^tyne throw y^ marches of Cherburge to keep
the fro^ters there y^ the naueroyse should do no hurt nor damage to y^ country
of nor mandy: and with him was y^ lord of Auter / the earl of Joney / sir
Arnold Dandrehen / and many knights and squiers of Briten and of Normandy. The
second bataile had the lord de la River and in his company diverse knights
and squyers of France and of Pycardy. And they were sent (...) to the erldome
of Eureux: and the duke himself with the grettest company went and laid sege
to Marchranuyll / a strong castle naueroyse. and brought thither many engyns
fro the cite of Charters / the which did cast day and night and did them
within much trouble.

(...) Of the journey that the duke of Burgone made against the garysons
naueroyse / and of the socour that the french king sent to sir Charles of
Bloys. Ca. CC.xxiiii.
IN the mean season that these me^ of war were thus in Beause and in Normandy
making war against the naueroyse enemies to the realm. There was sir Loyes of
Nauer who had the charge of the war under his brother y^ king: and he had
defied the french king because the war touched the challenge of his
enherytance. And after the batell of Cocherell he had assembled together men of
war where as he could get them and he did so much that by his means he gat
certain capitayns of the co^panyons / so that he was to y^ nombre of.xii.
hundred speres. And with him was sir Robert Canoll / sir Robert Ceney / sir
Robert Briquet of Carsnell and daily he increased / and was loged between the
river of Loyre and the river of Dallet. and so ouerran a great perte of the
country of Burbonoyse about Mo^lyns in Auuergne / saint Peter the mynster / and
saint Pursayn. and of sir Loyes company on a day a CCC. of whom sir Bertram de
la Sale / and Ortyngo were capitaynes: departed and passed Loyre beside
Marcilly the nonnes. And they rode so long what night and day that they aryued
at Charytie on the river of Loyre a great town and well closed / and
inco^tynent they sealed and entered in to it / and tarried still in a place where
as they entered: for they feared lest they of they town had set a busshmen for
the^. Therefore they durst enter no farther till it was fair day. And in the
mean season they of y^ town carried all their goods into botes the which
were on the river of Loyre / and themself their wives and their children. And
sorowed away toward the city of Neuers the which was a five leages thens.
And wha^ it was day the naueroyse / englysshmen and gascoyns: such as had
scaled the town went forward into the town and found all the houses void
Tha^ they determined to keep the town and to fortify it / for they thought it
stood metely to over ron the country on both sides of the river of Loyre. Tha^
they sent word thereof to si^ Lois of Nauer / who was than in the march of
Auuergne and he inco^tynent sent to them sir Robert Briquet with a three hundred
spears / and he passed through the country without any resystence: and so they
entered by the bridge over Loyre into Charity. And when they were met together
they thought them self strong ynowe Than they began to make sore war into
the realm of France.

Now let us speak of the duke of Burgoyn who lay at siege before
Marchera^uyll / and he oppressed them within so sore y^ they yielded up the
town saving their lives and goods / and so departed. Than the duke sent sir
Boucequant and sir Johan of Uyen marshall of Burgoyn to take possessyon of y^
town: and made captain thereof a squire of his called Guyllyam of Charters /
and with him a forty soudyers. Than the duke went with his company before
Canerolles and laid sege there to / for it stood in a plain country.

Now let us speak of sir John^ de la River / who lay at syege before Acqueney
nere to Passy in the cou^tie of Eureux and he had in his company a.ii. M. for
he was so great with the king y^ he might spend what him list. wtin the castle
of Aqueney were englysshmen / normans / frenchmen / and naueroyse: who had been
there ever sithe the battle of Cocherell and defended it right valyantly / for
they were well fortifyed with artyllary and vytels. Howbeit finally they were
feign to yield up the castle their lives and goods saved. And so they
departed and carried their goods to Cherbourge and there they tarried. Tha^ sir
John^ de la River garnisshed the castle with frenchmen / and than he went
toward the city of Deureux / and with him was sir Hew of the castle / the
lord of Sa^ny sir Mathewe of Roy / sir Monfange / the lord of Ely the lord
of Cresques / the lord of Ca^py sir Edward of Roucy / sir Ingram of Hedyn and
diverse other knights and squyers of France. And in y^ mean season the duke
of Burgon did so much to them of Canerolles / that they were feign to yield
the^ to his pleasure. And so all the soudyers strangers were taken to mercy /
but certain pyllers of the nacyon of France that were there taken were put to
death. than there came to the Duke certain burgesses of Charters / and desired
of the duke that he would give them for their wages and reward for their
engens the castle of Canerolles / the which had done the^ great hurt in time
past / and the duke gave it them to do what they would therewith. Than they of
Charters set men a warke and beat it clean down to the earth. Than the duke
went unto a castle called Drew / in the plain country of Beaus: and therein
were certain pyllers and the duke (...) by (...) / and all that were within
slain. Than the duke went to a castle named Pru^^ besiged it all about / and
made many assaut or he wanne (...) but finally they yielded them up their lives
only saved / but as for goods they bare away nothing: and all the frenchmen
that were within were kept still as prisoners. Than y^ duke took possession of
the castle and gave it to a knight of Beausse called sir Peter du Boys / to
thentent that he should fortify it and keep it sufficyently. Than the duke went
and refresshed him in the city of Charters and a part of his host / and when
he had been there a five days / than he went and beseged the castle of Convey
the which had done much trouble to the country there about: and the duke
caused six great engens to be raised against it. In the mean season while y^
duke made these assantes in Normandy / sir Loys of Nauer ouerran y^ low
country of Auuerne and kept still the feldes and sore enpouerysshed the country
and none duel encountre with him. And also they of the garyson of Char^te did
about them what they list also therle of Mounthelyert with his alyes of Almayne
were entered into the duchy of Burgoyn by Besancon and wasted all the country
whrefore y^ french king sent to the duke of but gone y^ he should break up his
sege before Co^uay and draw to Paris and so to go into Burgone. And when the
duke herd that he was (...)ry / for he had promised not to depart fro Convey
till he had won it: but they of his counsel said / that sithe the king had
sent for him he might well depart and break no promise but they made thereof no
semblaunt to the^ of Convey. but the marshall enquired of them if they would
yield them up simply to the dukes pleasure / and they answered nay. Howebeit
they said they were content to yield up the castle their lives and goods
saved / the which of / fre was accepted and they departed: and y^ duke
delivered the castle to a knight of Beaus named Philyppe ^arciers / and he
newly fortifyed it. Than the duke went to Charters and gave charge of the most
part of his company to the earl of Auserre / to sir Boucequant (...) to ser
Loys of ^ancer. and the duke went to Paris / and with him sir Loys of Alenson /
y^ forde Beauiewe the lord of Uyen (...) all the burgonyons / and so came to
the king his brother to Uaur in the county of Bry and there ^^taryed but one
day. And than rode so long that (...) to Champaig^ / and than he took the way
to Langers / and as he went he gadered men of war together. Thus y^
burgonyons made fro^ter war against their enemies / and there was the
archpreest / the lord of the castle Uylayne / the lord of Uergy / y^ lord
of Grancy / the lord of Sobournon / the lord of Rougemont / and a rich man
named John^ of Boloyn / the lord of Prises / sir He^ (...) Uyen / the lord of
the castle / the bishop of Langers and other who were right joyous of the
coming of the duke their lord. Than they rode toward their enemies / who
were a xv. hundred spears / and they were drawn beyond the ryne: and the
burgonyons were entered beyond the county of Mou^tbelyart / and brent as they
went.

IN the mean time the french king sent sir Morean of Fennes his constable and
his two marshals sir Boucequant and sir Mo^to^ of Bra^uyll and a great nombre
of knights and squiers to go and ley siege before Charity on the river of
Loyre and so they did / and nigh every day they skirmysshed with the^ within.
After y^ the duke of Burgon and the most part of his company y^ had been with
him in y^ county of mou^tbelyart were come to Paris. The king se(...) the duke
with mo than. M. speres to the siege before Charity. and than there were at the
sege a three. M. knights and squyers who skirmysshed often times with the^ of
the garyson / so yt there were hurt on both perties. and there were made new
knights and raised baners at an yssu^ that they of Charity made. First sir
Robert of Alenson / son to the earl of Ale^son who dyed at Cressy / and sir
Loys of Aucer son to therle of au^^r deed and brother to therle there present.
Thus they of Charytie were sore oppressed and gladly would have re^dred up the
fortresses by co^posicion / but the duke of Burgon would have had the^ at his
pleasure. he had taken fro the^ the river / so that no purueyau^ce could come
at the^.

IN the same season sir Loys of Nauer exyled all before him in the marches of
auuergne for he assembled people on every side / to the intent to reyse the
siege before Charytie and he had a two thousand fighting men / and had sent
in to Bretayne to sir Robert Canoll and to sir Gaultier Hewet / sir Mathewe
Gornay: and other knights and squyers there that they should come to serve him
in that journey (...) whereunto they were sore desirous: but they were all ready
at y^ sege before Alroy with therl^ Mountfort. and when sir Loys saw y^ he
coud^ ^at get them / than he drew to Chorbourge by the ordinance of y^ king
his brother. And the same season to thentent y^ sir Charles of Blo^s should
have mo men of war with him / y^ french king sent to the duke of But goyn yt
he shul^e re^eyue the^ of Charytie their lives saved / co^dy^^onally that they
should swear yt in three years after they should not be armed on the king of
Nauers part. So thus they of Charytie yielded themself up their lives saved /
but they ^aryed away no goodesse. And so they departed all a foot * and passed
through the realm of France on the dukes save conducte. And so they y^ were
wont of old time to dwell in Chary^e came thither again to abide there / and
the duke returned to Paris.

THe french king acorded to his cosyn sir Charles of Bloys that he should
have out of his realm to the nombre of a thousand spears / and wrote to sir
Bertram of Clesquy / who was in Normandy that he should go into Bretayne to aid
his cosyn ser Charles of Blois against sir John^ Mountfort. And of that
tidings sir Bertram was right ^oyouse / for always he took the lord Charles
for his natural lord. and so he departed out of Normandy with such people as
he could get to go in to Bretayne / and sir Boucequant kept still y^ siege in
Normandy in his stead. and so long rode sir Bertram and his company that he
came to Nau^tes in Bretayne and there he found the lord Charles of Bloys and
the good lady his wife who received him right swetely and conde him great
thank in that he was come thither to socour and aid him. And than they
counseled together how they should maynteyn forth the war / for also there
was the most part of all Bretayne / in entensyon to aid sir Charles of
Bloyes whom they all reputed for the duke of Bretayne / thinking to reyse the
syege before Alroy / and to fight with the lord Mountfort. Thither came great
baroney and knights of France and of Normandy: as the earl of Au^erre / the
earl of Joye the lord of Fra^uyll / the lord of Pry / y^ begue of Uyllers /
and diverse good knights squyers / and good men of arms. T^dynges came to the
lord Mountforte who lay at siege before Aulroy / how the lord Charles of
Bloys made a great ass^ble of men of war and how that diverse lords of
France were come to him and daily came new beside the conforte that he had of
the lords knights and squyers of Bretayne. As Soon as the lord Mountfort
knew these tidings he sent word thereof in to the duchy of Acquitayne / to
the knights and squyers that were there of England and specially to sir John^
Chandos / desyring them hertely that in his great need they would confort him.
In trust that in Bretayne they should do many a deed of arms / to y^ which
all knights and squyers to auaunce their honors should entende. And when sir
Johan Chandos saw that the earl Mountforte desired him so effectuously: than
he asked license of the prince of Wales his lord and master / who answered
and said he was content that he should go. Saying it was no breche of ye peace
between England and France / for the frenchemen in likewise took part with
sir Charles of Bloys against the earl of Mountforte / and so to do they had
good leave of the french king. Than sir Johan Chandos was right ioyouse and
made his prouisyon / and desired diverse knights and squyers of Acquitayne to
have gone with him / howbeit there were but a few that would go with him saving
such englysshemen as were there. yet he had with him a. CC. spears and as
many archers / and rode so long through Poyctou and Xaynton that he entered in
to Bretayne / and came to the syege before Alroy / and there he found the earl
of Mou^forte / who received him right ioyously and was glad of his coming /
and so was sir Olyuer of Clysson / sir Robert Canoll and other. And tha^ it
seemed generally to them that none yuell could than come to them sithe they had
sir Johan Chandos in their company / and also diverse knights and squyers of
England passed the sea / desyringe to auaunce their bodies and to fight with
the frenchmen / and came to the siege before Alroy in the aid of the earl of
Mountforte who received them with great joy. And so they were what english
and bretons to the nombre of sixtene hundred fightyng men / and about eight or
nine hundred archers.

Now let us return to sir Charles of Bloys who was in the ^ytie of Na^tes
and made there his somons / and gadered together me^ of war in every part where
he thought to get any / for he was well informed how the earl Mountfort was
greatly reconforted with the englysshmen. Than he desired the barownes /
knights / and squyers of Bretayne of sache as had done homage to him / that
they (...) o^de help or aid him to defend his heritage against his enemies:
there came of the barons of Bretayne to serve (...)* the vy(...) of (...) the
lord of ^yon / sir Charles of (...) / the lord of ^eur the lord of Tor^myne
/ the lord Dancennes / the lord of Males^^yt / the lor^^ of (...) / the lord
of Dangore / the lord of Lohea^ * the lord of Pont and diverse other y^ I
cannat name. These lords and their men were loged in the cite of Nauntes and
(...) y^ ^ylages there about / and when they were assembled all together they
were to the nombre of. (...). hundred spears with them of France. So these
lords counsciled the lord Charles not to ^ary long there / but to ride
toward his enemies. And at his departing the good lady his wife said to him
in the presens of sir Be(...) of Cle^quy / and other lords and knights of
Bretey^. Sir ye are going to defend mine heritage and yours / for y^ is mine
is yours* the which the lord Mountfort takes fro us wrongfully and without
cause / as god knowe^^. And all y^ lords of Bretayne here present / know
right well y^ I am right enheryter. Therefore sir I require you heartily that ye
make ^o ^^ner of ordinance nor composycion of agreement or peace with therle
Mountfort / but that the hole body of the duchy may remain with (...) he^
hasband granted her so to do. And than he departed with all his company and
took (...) their lady / whom they reputed as ^uchesse. And so they ro^e
toward ^^ynes and (...) thither and there lodged / and there ta(...)d and
refresshed them to here what their enemies (...) / and to advise some
su^fi^yent place to ^yght (...) them / in case that they might fyade / (...)
advantage. And there was great (...)cacion among the knights and squyers of
(...)aunce and of Bretayn / such as were (...) thither to aid sir Charles of
Bloys / who was full swear and courtesse / and parauentur^ w^lde gladly have
co^dyscended to a peace / and have ^en (...)tent with a part of the duchy of
Bretayne / but in the name of god he was (...) on by his wife and by the
knights about him / that he might not fall to no treaty of peace.

specially they would be all ruled / and sir (...) ^ambreticourt / sir Robert
Can^lle / sir (...) ^e Caurell / sir Mathewe Gourney and other. Than these
knights counsayled therle Mo^^sorde that the next day they should take the
(...)de / and thanne to take further advise. ^it was showed to all the host
that they should the next day be ready apparelled and set in order of battle
/ as thought they should fight (...)tynent. The night passed and the day came
the which was on a saturday / than the englysshemen and bretons issued out of
their holds / and came properly in good ordinance behyude the castle of
Aulroy / and there took a place of ground / and said how they would there
abide for their enemies. And so about the hour of prime sir Charles of Bloyes
and all his host came thither / who were deperted the friday before fro Uannes.
and than the same night lodged within three little leages of Alroy. And sir
Charles of Bloys and his company were ordered in the best manner that could be
devised / and rode so close toguyder that if one had cast any thing among them
/ it would have rested on their spear points / to se them the^glysshmen took
great pleasure. Thus the frenchemen rested in good array before their enemies /
and took their fel^e among the ^usshes / and it was commanded by their
marshalles that none should go forward without commandment. So they stood
still in good array ever ready to battle / the which was all their desire and
will.

THan the lord Charles of Bloys by the counsel of sir Bertram of Clesquy /
who was a great captain and greatly beloved with ye barons of Breteyn: by his
advise there was ordained three batels and a reregard. And as I understand sir
Bertra^ had the leadyng of ye first with a great no^bre of knights and squiers
of bretayne. The second led therle of Aucer and therle Jony with plenty of
knights and squiers of france. The. (...). had the lord Charles of Bloyes and
in his company great barons of Breteyn * as the vycont of Rohan / the lord of
Leon the lord of Nagor / sir Charles of Dynan / the lord Da^cenes / ye lord
of Malestroyt and diverse other. and in the a^eregard was the lord of Raix /
the lord of Rieux / the lord Tornemyne / the lord of Pont. and diverse other
barons knights and squ^ers. and in every battle was. M. of good fightyng men
/ and ye lord Charles of Bloys was ^esy in desyringe every batell to do yt day
their true deuoyre / and took it on his soul and on his part of paradyse yt
they should fight in a rightful quarrel / promysing every man acordynge to
their deserts to be well rewarded.

Now let us speak of the englysshmen and bretons how they ordered their
batayls. sir Johan C handos who was princypall capitayue over them though
therle of Mountfort were chief / for the king of England had written so to him
that he should specially entend to the business o^ his son therle of
Mountfort who should have his daughter in marriage. And so above all other
knights he was most nerest to therle of Mountfort / and he had well ymagined
and co^sydred the demeanor of the frenchmen / and in his mind praised greatly
their good order and said / (...)pereth surely that the flour of honor and
cheual^y is among yonder company beside great wit and good order. And than said
openly sirs it is time yt we order out batayls / for our enemies has given us
ensample. and such as herd him said sir ye say truth: and ye be our master
and chief counselor therefore order it acordyng to your pleasure / for there
is none yt shall coutrole you. And also ye know better how to order such a
matter than all we do / and than he made three batayls and a reregarde. The
first had sir Robert Canoll / sir Gaultier Huet / and sir Richard Burlke. The
second had sir Olyuer of Clysson / sir Eustace Da^breticourt / and si^ Mathue
Gorney. The third therle Mou^tfort and he him self to wayt on him / and in
every battle.v. C. men of arms / and.iiii. C. archers. And when it ca^e to
the ordring of the reregard than he called to him sir Hew Caurell and said /
sir Hew ye shall keep y^ areregard with.v. C. with you / and ye shall keep you
on a wyng and styre not fro your place for no manner of cause / without yese n^de.
So that if any of our batayls break ordisaray by any adventure: than if ye se
any such need draw thither and confort them / and when ye have done keep
again your stall and ye can / for this day ye can not do better service And
when sir Hew Caurell had well herd sir John^ Chandes he was greatly a shamed
and displeased and said / sir deliver this areregard to some other than to me
for I purpose not to medell there with / and sir I have marueyle what ye se in
me that I should not be one of ye first to fight with our enemies. Than sir
John^ Chandos right well auysed said: sir Hew I set you not in this areregarde
because ye be not so good a knight as other of our company that was never in my
mind / for I know truly that ye would gladly be one of y^ formast and right
able ye are so to be / but I ordeyn you thereto because ye be a sage knight and
well aduysed / and ser it must behoue that one of us two must do it / wherefore
I hertely require you to do it. and sir I promise you faithfully that and ye
will do it / it shall be a great aduau^tage for us all / and ye thereby shall at
tayne great honor. And moreover I promise you the first request after that
ever ye desyreme of I shall grant it you / howbeit for all the words y^ sir
John^ Chandos could speak sir Hew Caurell would not agree thereto / for he
reputed it a great shame to him so to do / and desired for goddessake holdyng
up his hands to put some other thereto / for i^ effect his mind was to fight
with the formast. And with those words sir Johan Chandos almost wept / and
said right swetely. Sir Hew it must behoue other you to do it or else my self
/ therefore consider which were better. Than sir Hew aduysed him self / and
was with tho words half confounded and said. Certesse ser I know well ye
will not desire me to any thing that should be to my dishonor / and sy the it
will be none otherwise I am content to do it. And so sir Hew Caurell took on
him the charge of the reregard and drue out a part on a wyng and set him in
good order.

Thus ye saturday the.viii. day of Octobre the yer of our lord. M.iii.
C.lxiiii. were these batayls ordered each before other in a fair plain nere to
A^lroy in Bretayne / the which was a goodly sight to behold. For there might
have been seen baners and penons wauyng with the wind and harness richely
aparelled / and specially the frenchmen were so properly dressed that it was
joy to behold the^. and thus as th(...) ^red their batayls on both ^ties.
The lord of Beamanoyre a great baron and a rich of bretayne went between the
parties entretyng for a peace for he was glad to besy him self therein / in
exchewyng of the parels that was lykely to fall. He was suffered to go and come
bytwen the parties / because he was sworn prisoner to thenglysshmen / and
might not be armed. And that saturday he went in and out often times till it
was noone / and so by his means he gat between the parties a certain respyte
for that day and night / until the next day son risynge. And than every man
brewe to his logynge and took their ease and refresshing of such as they had:
and the same euenyng the captain of Alroy issued out of his garyson / because
ye truse also stretched to them. and went peasably into the host of the lord
Charles of Bloyes / who received him right ioyously. The captain was called
Henry of Hanternell a squire and a good man of arms / and he had in his
company a forty speres of good companyons well armed and horsed / such as had
help him to keep the fortress. And when the lord Charles saw the captain
/ all smy lyng he inquired of him the state of the castle: and the squire
answered and said. Sir thanked be god we have yet prouisyon sufficyent to keep
it two or three months if need were. Well Henry (...) the lord Charles to
morowenexte ye shall be well delyuerd other by agreement of peace / or else by
plain battle: sir (...) the squire god give grace. By my faith (...) the
lord Charles I have here in my company a.xxv. C. men of arms well aparelled /
and as likely to acquyte them nobly as ever did any company that came out of
france. Sir (...) the squire and that is a great aua^ tage / ye ought greatly
to thank god therefore / and sir Bertram of Clesquy and these other barons
knights and squyers of France and of Bretayne / that thus courtesly are come
to serve you. Thus the lord Charles passed forth yt night with comunynge with
one and other / and y^ same night sir John^ Chandos was sore ^esyred by
certain englisshmen / that he should not consent to any peace to be had
between therle Mountfort and the lord of Bloyes / for they said they had
spend all that they had / and were poor. Therefore they would other recover
somewhat a gain by battle or else to lose all together / and sir John^ Chandos
promised them to agree to no peace. And whan^e the sunday came / in the morning
every man in the host apar^le^ himself. And in the host of sir Charle^ of
Bloys there were many ma^^es said / and houseled such as would / and in
likewise so they did in therl^ Mou^tfortes host. And a little before the son
rising / every man drew under their own batayls in good order as they did the
day before. and than anon after the lord of Beamanoyre came to entreat for
the peace / for gladly he would have had the parties agreed: and so he came
first to ward sir Johan Chandos / who issued out of the battle as soon as he
saw him coming and met with him. And when the lord of Beamanoyr saw him he
saluted him right humbly and said. Sir Johan Chandos I require you for gods
sake set in acorde these. (...) parties / for it should be great pity yt so many
noble men as be here should fight to guyder in susteyning of their quarrels.
Than sir John^ Cha^^os said: sir of Beamanoyre it will not be / therefore I
advise you yt ye ride no farther for our people are determined that if they
can enclose you among them / they will slay you. Therefore ye may say to the
lord Charles of Bloys / that how soever it be sir John^ of Mountfort will
have battle and forsakes all treaty of peace^ for he says he will this day
other be duke of bretayne or else dye in the place. And when the lord of
Beamanoyre understood sir John^ Chandos he was angry in his mind and said / a
Cha^dos Chandos that is not thentent of my lord sir Charles of Bloys / and yet
has he as great will to fight as your lord has: and so has all his people.
And there with he departed without any mo words / and returned to the lord
Charles of Bloys and to the other lords of Bretayne who tarried for him. Than
sir John^ cha^dos returned to the earl of Mountforte / who inquired of him
how the matter went and what his adversary said. Sir he sends you word by
the lord of Beaumanoyre fro whom I no we departed / that how soever it be he
will fight with you: and other this day be duke of Breteyn or else dye in the
pain. This answer sir Johan Chandos made / to thentent to give his lord the
better courage: and thus finally he said. sir take heed now what ye will do
whyder will ye fight or not. sir (...) the earl in ye name of god and saint
George let us than go to it / and god help the right: cause our baners to
auau^ce and so they did. Than the lord of Beaumanoyre when he was returned to
the lord Charles he said / sir sir / by my lord saint yues I have herd the
proudest word of sir John^ Chandos yt ever I herd. for he said therle
mou^tfort should this day be duke of bretayne / and shows plainly how ye have
no right thereto / with the which word sir Charles changed color and said:
as for the right god knows it is mine / and so affermed the other barons of
Bretayne Than he caused his baners to be auaunced in the name of god.

ANd so a little before the hour of prime / the batayls aproched nere together /
the which was a goodly sight to behold / as I have herd recorded of them
that were there: and had seen it. the frenchmen were so close together that a
man could not cast an appell among the^ but it should a fallen on a bassenet or
on a helm every man of arms bare his spear right before him cut of five foot
of length / and a short axe hangyng by his side. And so they ca^e on fair and
easily every man in good array his baner before him and right well aduysed of
that they had to do: and also the englisshmen were right properly appointed /
and so assembled and met together. First the bretons and sir Bertram of Clesquy
encountered with the battle of sir Robert Canolle and sir Gaultier Hewet and so
the lords of Bretayne on both sides set the baners of their lords that
claymed to be duke each against other. And so at the first encountre there was
a sore battle: and truly the archers shot at the beginning right fiersly.
howbeit their shot did little hurt to the frenchemen / they were so well
armed and pauysshed. Than tharchers who were bygge men and light cast away
their bows and entered in among the frenchmen that bare the axes / and at y^
first metyng they pulled out of some of the frenchemennes hands their axes /
wherwt they fought after right hardely. There was done many a ^eat of arms /
many a one taken and rescued a gain: and he that was ones down it was herd
for him to releue again without great help. The battle wherein the lord
Charles was / dressed them self straight against the lord Mountfortes
battle: and with him was the earl of Rohane* the lord of Lion / sir Charles
of Dynan / y^ lord of Quyntyne / the lord Da^cenes / and the lord of
Rochforde / every lords baner before him. So there was a sore foughten battle
/ and the Mountfordes part at the beginnynge was sore oppressed. but than^e
sir Hugh Caurell who was in the wynge and had a great battle of good men of
war / saw his company out of order / than he drew thither and set them
again in order / the which dealing greatly aueyled them that day.

How sir John^ Chandos disconfyted the bataile of therle of Aucer / and how
sir Bertra^ of Clesquy was disconfyted and taken. and the lord Charles of
Bloys slain in the batell: and of the pytefull complaynt that therle Mountfort
made for his death. Cap. C C.xxvi.
ALso sir Olyuer Clysson / sir Eustace Danbreticourt / sir Richard Brulle / sir
Johan Bourchier / sir Mathewe Gourney / and diverse other knights and squyers
fought with the battle of the earl of Aucerr / and the earl of Joignye: the
which was a great battle and well furnysshed with good men of war. There
was many a noble deed done / many taken and rescued again: the frenchmen and
bretons on the one part fought right valyantly with the axes that they held
in their hands and the lord Charles of Bloyes proved himself a merueylous
good knight. And also his adversary therle of Mountfort was a valyant knight.
and sir John^ Cha^dos did y^ day many a noble feat / for he was in his days a
right valyant knight hardy and redouted of his enemies sage in battle / well
aduysed / and full of experyens. He counseled ever therle of Mountfort / and
always took head to comfort him and his men / and said sir do thus and thus:
draw to y^ side or to y^ side / and therle ruled himself always by his
counsel. And on the other part sir Bertram of Clesquy / the lord of Tornmyne
/ the lord Daua^gour / the lord of Raix / y^ lord of Loheat / y^ lord of
Bornay / y^ lord of Malestroyt / y^ lord of Pont / the lord of Prier: and many
other good knights and squyers of Bretayne and of Normandy y^ were there with
the lord Charles of Blois fought valiantly. And so long they fought that all
the batels assembled each with other / except y^ reregard of the^glyssmen.
whereof ser Hew Caurell was chief and soueraygne. He kept always his batell in
a wyng / and took head to nothig but to redress again his perte if any thing
were a mysse among any of the^. Among other knights sir Olyuer of Clisson was
well advised / he did maruels with his body and had a great axe in his hands
wherwt he brake and opened the prese / so y^ none durst aproche nere to him. He
adue^tured himself often times so ferr y^ he was in great danger / he had
much to do in y^ batell of therle of Iucerr / and of the earl of Joigny. Where
he was sore encou^tred / so that with a stroke of an are he was stryken on the
vyser of his bassenet so that the point of the axe entered into his eyes whereby
h^ lost ever after y^ sight with that eye / but for all that stroke yet he dealt
still like a noble knight. There was recouerynge of batayles and baners that
sometime were down: by well fighting were releued again on both parts.
Among all other knights sir Johan Chandos was a good knight / and valyantly
fought with an are that he held in his hands so that he gave such strokes
that none durst aproche to him: for he was a great and a mighty knight / and
well formed of all his members. So he came and fought against the battle of y^
earl of Aucers and of the frenchmen / and there was done many a noble deed /
and by force of well fightyng y^ battle was broken and brought to such
myschefe that brefely after it was disco^fyted: and all the baners and penons
of that battle overthrown to the earth / and the lords put to flight in
great danger and mischefe / for they were not aided nor comforted fro no part:
for every man had enough to do to defend himself. To say the truth when a
disco^syture falls / they that are overcome be disco^fyted for a little / for
if one fall there falls three / and on.iii. x. and on.x. xxx. and if.x. slye
there follows. C. Thus it fortuned in this battle of Alroy: the lords cried
their cries whereby some y^ herd it were reco^forted by their men that drue to
them / and some were not herd / they were so in the prease and so ferr fro
their men. Ho wheit finally the earl of Aucer by force of arms was sore
wounded / and taken under the standerd of sir John^ Chandos and yelden prisoner
/ and the earl of Joigny also / and the lord of Prier a great baneret of
Normandy.

yet all this season y^ other batels fought still valyantly / and the bretons
held a long space in good order. howbeit to speak truly in arms they kept
not their order so well as thenglysshemen and bretons that were with therle
Mou^tfort did / and greatly aueyled to them y^ day the battle on the wyng that
sir Hew Caurell led And so when the^glysshmen saw y^ frenchmen begin to
break and opyn their batell they were greatly reconforted: and than some of the
frenchmen such as had their horses ready aperelled mounted on them and stedd
away as fast as they might. Than sir John^ Chandos and a company with him /
dressed themself against the batell of sir Bertram of Clesquy / the which
battle had done marueyls in arms: but than it was opyned and many good
knights and squters brought to great myschefe. There was given many a great
stroke with their heavy ares / and many a bassenet cloven a so^dre / and many a
man wounded to death: and to say the troth ser Bertram of Clesquy nor his
company could no le^ger endure their enemies. So there was taken sir Bertam of
Clesquy by a squire of England / under the standerd of sir John^ Chandos: and
the same season sir Johan Chandos took prisoner a lord of Bretayne called the
lord of Raix a right hardy knight. And when this battle of bretons began thus
to break / all the other batayls were clean disco^fyted and lost their array:
and every man fled away as fast as they might to save them self. Except a
certain good knights and squyers of Bretayne / who would not leave their lord
Charles of Bloys / but had rather dye than to depart with reproach. And so
they drue about him and fought right valtan^ly / and there was done many a noble
deed of arms. And so the lord Charles of Blois and s^che as were about him
held themself together a certain space / defe^dyng themself right valyantly
/ how beit finally they could not defend them self so / but that they were
disconfyted and brought out of order by force of arms / for the most part of
the englysshmen drew to y^ part. There was the baner of the lord Charles of
Bloyes disconfyted and cast to the earth and he slain that bare it: and the
lord Charles was there slain his face toward his enemies / and a bastard
son of his called sir Johan of Bloys / and diverse other knights and squyers
of Bretayne. And as I understood / it was so ordained in the english host /
that if they had the better in the bataile / and that if sir Charles of Bloyes
were found in the place y^ none should take him to ransom / but to slay him.
And in semblable wise the frenchmen had ordained for sir John^ Mountfort / if
they had atteyned the vyctorie: for as that day they were determined to have an
end of the war. So when it ca^e to the flight there was great slaughter / and
many a good knight taken and brought to myschefe. There was the flower of
cheualry at y^ time other taken^e or slain / but a few of men of honor that
escaped / and specially of the banerettes of bretayne. There were slain ser
Charles of Dynan / the lord of Lion y^ lord of Da^cenes / y^ lord Daua^gour
/ the lord of Loheat / the lord of Gargoll / the lord of Malestroyt / the
lord of Pout: and diverse other knights and squyers / the which I can not
all name. And there were taken the earl of Rohan / ser Guy of Lion* y^ lord of
Rochfort / the lord of Raix the lord of Ry^^x / therle of To^noyre / sir
Henry of Malestroyt / sir Olyuer of Manny / the lord of Ruyll / the lord of
Franuyll / the lord of Raneuall and diverse other of Normandy: and diverse other
good knights and squyers of France / with therle of Aucer and Joigny. Br^uely
to speak this disconfyture was great and mighty / and much good people therein
slain as well in the f^ldes as in the chase / the which endured eight great
leages cuyn to Raynes. There were many adventures the which came ^acall to
knowledge / and many a one slain and taken as it fortuned them to fall in the
hands of them that were cruel or courtesse. This ba(...)e was nere to Alroy
in Bretayne / the year of our lord a thousand. CCC.lx. and four.

AFter this great disconfytur as ye have herd: the lords of England and
Bretayne returned and left the chase to their people. Than there drew to the
earl of Mountfort sir John Chandos / sir Robert Canoll / sir Eustace
Dambretycourt / sir Mathewe Gourney sir Johan Bourchier / sir Gaultier Hewet /
sir Hughe Caurelle / sir Richard Brulle / sir Richard Tancon and diverse other
/ and so came to a hedge side. And there they unarmed them for they saw well
the journey was theyrs: and certain of them set their baners and standerdes on
the hedge / and the baner with y^ arms of Bretayne on a busshe to draw their
people thither. Than sir Johan Chandos / sir Robert Canoll / sir Hugh Caurell /
and other knights drew them to therle Mountfort / and smylyng said to him.
Sir laud god and make good chere / for ye have this day conquered the heritage
of Bretayne. Than the earl enclyned himself right courtesly and said openly
that every man might here: a sir John^ Chandos this good adventure that is thus
fallen to me / is by the great wit and prowes that is in you / the which I
know well: and so do all those that be here. Sir I pray you drink with me:
and took him a flagon with wine / whereof he had drunk and refresshed him
before: and moreover said / sir beside god I ought to can you the most
thank of any creature living: and therewith there came to them sir Olyuer of
Clysson forchased and enstamed / for he had long pursued his enemies: so he had
much pain to return again with his people / and brought with him many a
prisonere. Than he came to therle of Mountfort and a lyghted fro his horse and
refresshed him: and in the same mean season there came to the^ two knights
and two haraldes / who had serched among the deed bodies / to se if ser Charles
of Bloys were deed or not. Than they said all openly* sir make good chere for
we have seen your adversary ser Charles deed: therewith the earl of Mountfort
arose and said that he would go and se him / for he had as good will to se him
deed as a live: and thither he went and the knights that were about him. And
when he was come to the place where as he lay a side covered under a shield /
he caused him to be uncovered and than regarded him right piteously / and
studied a certain space and said: a sir Charles fair cosyn how that by your
opinyon / many a great myschiefe has fallen in Bretayn / as god help me it
sore dyspleaseth me to find you thus / how beit it can be none otherwise /
and therewith he began to weep. Than sir John^ Chandos drew him a back and
said: sir depart hens and thank god of the fair aduentur that is fallen to
you / for without the death of this man ye could not come to the heritage of
Bretayne. Tha^ therle ordained that sir Charles of Bloys should be borne to
Guyngant / and so he was inco^tynent with great reverence: and there buried
honorably as it apertayned / for he was a good true and a valyant knight: and
his body after sanctified by the grace of god and called saint Charles / and
canonised by pope Urban the.v. for he did and yet does many fair miracles
daily.

Of the truce that was given to bury the deed after the hatayle of Alroy and
how diverse castles yielded up to therle Mou^tfort: and how he be seged
Ca^pantore^tyne. Cap. CC.xxvii.
AFter that all the deed bodies were dispoyled / and that thenglysshmen were
returned fro the chase. Tha^ they drew them to their lodgings / and unarmed
the^ and took their ease and took head to their prisoners / and caused them
that were wounded to be well served and serched. And on the Monday in the
morning the earl Mou^tfort made it to be known to them of the city of Reins
and to the towns there about that he would give truce for three days / to the
cute^t that they might gather together the deed bodies and bury them in holy
places / the which ordinance was well taken and accepted. And so the earl
Mountfort lay still at siege before Alroy / and said he would not depart thens
till he had won it. So the tidings spredde abroad into diverse countrees /
how sir John^ Mountfort by the counsel and aid of the englysshmen had won
the field against sir Charles of Bloys / and disconfyted and put to death and
taken all the cheualry of Bretayne / such as were against him. Sir Johan
Chandos had great renome / for all manner of people: lords / knights / and
squyers such as had been in the field said: that by his wit and high prowes
thenglysshmen and bretons had won the field. and of these tidings were all the
friends and ayders of sir Charles of Bloyes right sorrowful and sore dyspleased
/ the which was good reason. And specially the french king for this
disconfyture touched him greatly / because that diverse knights of his realm
were there slain and taken / as sir Bertram of Clesquy whom he greatly loved /
and the earl of Aucer / the earl of Joigny / and all the barons of Bretayne
none except. Than the french king sent Loyes the duke of Aniou to the marches
of Bretayne for to reco^fort the country / y^ which was desolate and
disconforted for the love of their lord Charles of Bloyes / whom they had
lost. And also to reconforte the countess of Bretayne wife to the said lord
Charles / who was so sore disconforted for y^ death of her husband / that it
was pity to behold her / the which the duke of Aniou was bound to do: for he
had married her daughter. So he promised with faithful intent / to give unto
all the good cities and castles in Bretayne / and to all the remnant of the
country of Bretayne: his good counsel / confort / and aid in all cases.
Whereby the good lady whom he called mother / and all the country had a
certain space great trust / unto such season as the french king to ereche we
all parels / put other prouisyon as ye shall herafter. Also these tidings came
to the king of England / for the earl of Mou^tfort had written to him thereof /
the. v* day after the battle was ended before Alroy* The letters were brought
to the king of Enlande to Dover by a parseuant of arms / who had been in the
battle. And the king inconsynent made him an haralde and called him Wynd sore*
as I was informed by the same haraulde and diverse other. And the cause why the
king of England was as than at Dover / I shall show you here after.

IT was of truth that there was a treaty three year before / between the lord
Edmo^de earl of Cambrige one of the kings sons / and the daughter of therle
Loys of Flanders: to the which marriage therle of Flanders was as than newly
agreed unto / so that pope Urban the fyft would dispense with them / for they
were nere of lynage. And the duke of Lancaster and the lord Edmonde his
brother / with many knights and squyers had been in Flanders with the earl:
and were received right honorably in sign of great peace and love. And so the
earl of Flaunders was come to Calais and passed the sea and came to Dover /
where the king and part of his counsel were ready to receive him / and so they
were there. When the foresaid purseuant came to the king and brought him tidings
of the battle of Alroy / of the which the king and all that were there were
right ioyouse: and in likewise so was the earl of Flaunders / for the love and
honor and auaunceme^t of his cosyn germayne / the earl of Mountfort. Thus the
king of England and therle of flanders were at Dover the space of three days
in feestes and great sportes / and when they had well sported the^ and done
that they assembled for. Than the earl of Flaunders took leave of the king and
departed / and as I understand the duke of Lancastre and the lord Edmonde
passed the sea again with him and held him company till he came to Bruges.

Now let us speak of therle Mou^tfort how he did in Bretayne. Cap. CC.xxviii.
THe earl of Mountfort as ye have herd before / lay still at y^ sege before
Alroy: and said how he would not depart thens till he had it at his pleasure.
And they with in y^ castle were not at their case / for they had lost their
captain Henry of Fe^tenycle / for he was abydden in the field and the chief
of their company / wherefore they were but a few within and socour came none to
the^ fro no part: therefore they took counsel among them and determined to
yield up the castle their lives and good saved. Than they entreted with therle
and with his counsel: and the earl who had many things to take heed of /
because he knew not how all the country would de demeaned. Therefore he took
them to mercy and suffered them peasably to depart / and took the possessyon of
the forteresse / and set men (...) of his. And than rode farther and all his
(...) the which daily increased / for men of war and archers resorted daily
to him: and also diverse knights and squyers of bretayne turned to his part.
and specially the breton bre(...)tes. Than he tarried three days before the
town of Jougowe / and made two great assautes wherein diverse were sore hurt /
both of them within and without. And when they of Jougowe saw how they were
assailed / and that no socoure was coming to them ward. (...)han they
detmyned not to be haryed nor undone but took therle Mountfort for their lord
and opened the gates and swear to become his men forever. Than the earl removed
all the offuers in the town and set in new / and than rode before the town
of Dynan / and there he laid siege the which endured long into winter for the
town was well garnysshed with vitayls / and with good men of war. And also
the duke of Amou erhorted them to keep it like good men of war / and promised
to conforte them the which caused them to abide and suffer many a great assaut
/ but when they saw y^ there purueyaunces began to mynisshe / and that no
socoure apered to them. Than they entreated for a pease with the earl
Mountforte / who gladly intended thereto / for he desired nothingels / but that
they should knolege him for their lord / and so they did. And so he entered in
to the town of Dynan with great solempnyte / and they all did to him homage
and fealty. Tha^ he rode forth with all his army till he came before the
city of Campecorentyne and besieged it round about and brought thither great
engens fro Ua^nes and fro Dynan: and said he would not deperte thens till he
had it at his pleasur Thenglysshmen and bretons as sir John^ Chandos and other
who had taken at the battle of Alroy diverse prisoners / would put none to
ransom / because they should not assemble to gyder a gain to make a new
field against the^. Therefore they sent the^ into Po^to^ / Xaynton / Burdeaur /
and Rochell to be kept there as prisoners. And so ^^the the mean season the
bretons and englysshmen in one part and other conquered all the country of
Bretayne.

How the peace was made that the earl of Mountfort should abide duke of
Bretayne / and how the french king rendered to Clysson his land / and of the
marriage of the duke of Normandy. and how the captall of Beu^ became liege man
to the french king / and afterward renounced him again. Cap. CC.xxix.
IN the mean seasone that the earl of Mountforte lay at siege before
Campecorentyne / and that it was sore beten and oppressed by his engyns and
assautes. His men ran over the country and left nothing untaken: without it
were to hot / to cold / or to heavy. Of these adventures the french king was
well informed / and had thereon diverse counsayls / purposes / and ymagynacions:
how he might do with the business of Bretayne / for they were in a hard
perte and could not well remedy it without styrringe of all his realm / and to
make war again with thenglysshmen for Bretayne. Wherein he had counsel in no
wise so to do / for by great delyberacion of counsel it was said to him. Sir
ye have held the opinyon of the lord Charles of Bloyes your cosyn / and in
likewise so did the king your father / and king Philyp your graundfather: who
gave him in marriage the duchy of Bretayne / whereby many great yuels and
inconuenyentes has fallen sithe in Bretayne / and in the countries about. And
sir so it is that the lord Charles of Bloys your cosyn / in keeping and
defending his right in Bretayne is now deed and slain. and there is non on his
side that the right of the war / or of his challenge can releue: for his two
sons John^ and Guy who be next heirs / ar in England in prisone. And sirye
here daily how the earl Mountfort co^quereth and takes towns and castles /
and reputeth them as his own true heritage. Sir thus ye may lose your right
and homage that ye ought to have of Bretayne / the which is a right noble
thing to your realm. Wherefore ye ought greatly to doubt the loss of the same
/ for if therle Mountfort become liege man and hold the duchy of Bretayne of
your brother the king of England as his father did of old time / ye can
not have it again without great war and great hatred / between you and the
king of England where as good peace is no we / the which we will not counsel
you to break. Therefore sir we think all things co^sydred and ymagined / that
it were good for you to send certain messangers to have a treaty between you
and therle Mountforte to know how he will maynteyne and agree to any peace
between him and the country / and the lady who calls herself duchess. And
sir as your messangers feleth him dysposed in this matter / than acordyng thereto
ye may take further advise: at ye uttermost it were better that he abode still
duke of Bretayne so that he will hold of you / and do to you all rightes that
a subget ought to do to his lord / rather than the matter should be in great
parell of lesyng of all: to the which words the king gladly enclyned unto.
Than it was ordained that the lord Johan of Craon archbysshop / the lord of
Craon his cosyn / and sir Boucequant should go on yt voyage to Campacorentyne /
to treat with the earl Mountfort and with his counsel / on ye state of peace
as ye have herd. So thus these three lords deperted well instructed of that
they should do / and so long they rode till they came to the sege of the
englysshmen and bretons before Campacorentyne / and so they named them to be
messangers fro the french king. Therle of Mountfort / sir Johan Chandos / and
they of his counsel received them right ioyously. than these lords of France
showed right sagely the occasyon of their coming thider / and why they
weresent. And at the first entreaty therle mou^tfort answered how he would
take counsel and aduyce in the matter / and gave them day of answer. And in
the mean season these three lords went and lay at the city of Reyns. Than the
earl Mountforte sent into England the lord Latymer to show to the king of
England the treaty of the frenchmen / desyringe him to have his counsel in
that behalf. And the king of England when he was enfourmed of the matter /
said how that he would counsel therle Mou^tfort to have peace / so that
always he might be duke of Bretayne: and somewhat to recompense the lady
calling her self duchess / with some honest thing. assignynge her some
certain rent yearly to be paid out of some place where she might be sure to
have it without danger. Than the lord Latimer brought word again to therle
of the kings answer / and so after his letters reed and his answer herd /
the earl of Mountfort and his counsel sent for the french messangers to come
to his host / and their answer was made them right courtesly. And it was said
to them how the earl Mountfort would in no wise depart nor forsake his
challenge of the duchy of Bretayne / but that he would abide duke of Bretayne:
and so to be called. But where as the french king would have him to opyn
peasably his cities / towns / and castles / and to make faith and homage to
him and all other ryghtes: as the dukes of Bretayne have done in time paste. He
is content so to do / and gladly to knowledge the french king for his natural
lord / and to do to him homage and service in the presens of the peers of
France. And also to give aid and help / and to reconforte his cosyn the wife
of therle Charles trepassed / and to help to deliver his cosyns her sons out
of prison in England. This answer pleased right well these lords of France
/ than they took day and time this matter to conclude or not Than incontinent
they sent to the duke of Aniou / who was as than at Angiers: to whom ye
french king had given full power and auctoryte to conclude this treaty / or
else to leave it at his pleasur. And when the duke of Aniousaw the effect of
this matter he took counsel a long space / but finally he was counsayled to
accept the treaty. and the two knights that were sent to him retorued again
with his answer written and sealed. And than these lords of France departed
fro Reyns and went to the siege before Campacorentyne: and there finally ye
peace was made / agreed / and sealed by therle Mou^tfort / and he abode as duke
of Bretayne condycionally that if he had no children of his body laufully
begoten / than the duchy to return to the children of the lord Charles of
Blois. and the lady wife to the lord Charles of Bloys disceassed / should be
countess of Poynteure / the which land was of yearly rent about.xx. M.
frankes. And also the lord Mountfort should come in to France when soever the
king sent for him to do his homage / and to hold the duchy of Bretayne of him.
And for the confyrmacion hereof: there were charters and instruments publyke
made and sealed on both parties. Thus therle of Mountfort entered into the
duchy of Bretayne / and abode as duke thereof a certain space of time / till
other tidings of war came: as ye shall herafter in this history.

ANd also by the ordinance of the same peace / the french king restored again
(...) the lord of Chsson his land / y^ which was taken fro him by king
Philyp sometime king So thus the lord of Clysson aquaynted him so with the
french king that he did what he would / and without him nothing was done. So
thus the cou^tte of Bretayne was right joyous when they saw that they were in
rest and peace: and the duke took faith and homage of the cy*ties / good to
wnes / and castles / and of all prelates and other gentylmen. And within a
space after the duke married the daughter of the princes of Wales* the which
she had before by the lord Thomas Hollande and this marriage was made in the
good rytie of Nauntes right nobly. Also it fortuned y^ same winter y^ queue
Jane aunt to the king of Nauer / and queen Bla^che her sustre, did somoch y^ a
peace was made between y^ french king and the king of Nauer by y^ aid and
wysoome of the lord captall of Beufz who did all that he might to conclude y^
peace and thereby he was aquyted out of prison. And the french king showed him
in deed great sign of love / and gave him y^ fair castle of De nemoux with
all the appurtenaunces / the which was well worth of yearly revenues three
thousand frankes / and so the Captall became liegeman to the french king / of
whose homage y^ king was right toyouse. for he loved well the service of such
a knight as y^ captall was in his time. But y^ service endured no long season
/ for when he came into the principalyte to the prince / who was informed of
the case as it stood. Greatly he blamed him and said how that he could not
acquyte him self trewely to serve two lords / and that he was to covetous to
take land in France / where he was another be loved nor honored. And when the
Captall saw himself in that case / and home he was taken and reputed by the
prince his natural lord he was sore a shamed and excused himself / saying
sir I am not so sore bound to the french king / but that I may soon for do
again all that I have done or promised. And so he sent a servant of his to
the king and renounced all that the king had given him and he tarried still him
self with the prince / for he was aquyted of his prison by the composycion of
y^ peace taken between the french king and the king of Nauer. And the french
king had by co^posicyon the towns of Maunt / and Meulecke: and the king
rendered him therefore other castles in Normandy. In this season deperted out of
france the lord Loys of Nauer and went into Lo^bar die to mary the queen of
Naples / but at his departing he had of the french king for certain castles
that he delivered up in Normandy / the sum of threscore thousand frankes.
And the same lord Loys after he had wedded the queen of Naples lived no long
time / god forgive him all his fautes / for he was a right good knight and a
courtesse.

IN this season yet was there still in France great nombre of the companyons /
the which as than wist not what to do / seeing the wars of Bretayne were
ended. These co^panyons pursued ever after deeds of arms and taking of
pyllages at their aduauntages / fro the which they could not nor would
absteyne / and all their chief recours was in France / for they called the
realm of France their chamber. They durst do no hurt in Acquitayne for the
land would not suffer them: and also to say truth most part of the
capitayns were gascons and englysshmen / under the obeysaunce of the king of
England and of y^ prince. some there were of Bretayne but not many / wherefore
diverse of the realm of France murmured against the king of England and the
prince / and said covertly / how that they aquyted not themself well against
the french king. seeing they do not their good wylles to put out of the realm
those yuell disposed people. So y^ wise and sage men of France consydred /
that without they did put some remedy to drive them out of the realm /
either by battle or by means of some money. Else at length they were lykely to
distroy the noble realm of France and holy christendom. The same season
there was in Hongry a king that would gladly have had them with him / for he
had great war against the turk / who did him great damage. Than he wrote to
pope Urbane the.v. who was as than at Auignon / certifyeng him how he would
gladly y^ the realm of France were delivered of the nombre of companyons and
y^ they were all with him in his wars against the turk. And in like wise he
wrote letters to y^ french king and to the prince of Wales. and so they
entreated the said companyons and offered them gold / and silver / and passage:
but they answered that they would not that way / saying they would not go so
ferr to make war for it was showed among themself by some of their own
company that had been before in Ho^gry / how that there were such straytes that
if they were fought with there they could never escape but to dye shamefully /
the which so affrayed them that they had no lust to go thither. And when the
pope and the french king saw that they would not agree acordyng to their
desyers / and also that they would not avoid out of the realm of France /
but daily multiplied. Than they be thought them of another way and means to
cause them to avoid.

THe same season there was a king in Castle called Dame Peter / who was full of
marvelous opinyo^s / and he was rude and rebel against the commandments of
holy church. And in mind to subdue all his christian neighbors kings and
princes / and specially the king of Aragon called Peter / who was a good true
christian prince / and had as than taken fro him part of his realm / thynking
to have all the remenant. Also this king Dampeter of Castle had three basterd
brethren / the which king Allphons his fader had by a lady called the Rich
Drue. Theldest was called Henry / the second Dancylle / and the third Sauses.
This king Dampeter hated them so that he would not suffer them to come in his
sight / and often times if he might have gotten the^ he would have stryken of
their heedes. Ho wbeit they were well-beloved with the king their father / and
in his life he gave to Henry theldest the county Desconges. But this king
Dampeter his brother had taken it fro him / and therefore they kept daily war
toguyder. This bastard Henry was a right hardy and a valyant knight / and had been long in France and pursued the war there / and served the french king
who loved him right entierly. King Dampeter as the common brute ran / had put
to death the mother of the children: wherewith they were right sore displesed
and good cause why. Also beside y^ he had put to death and exyled diverse great
lords of the realm of Castle / he was so cruel and so without shame / that
all his menfeared / douted / and hated him as ferr as they durst* also he
caused to dye a right good and a holy lady / the which he had to wife called
the lady Blanch / daughter to duke Peter of Burbone / suster germayn to the
french queen and to the countess of Sauoy / whose death was right displesaunt
to all her lynage / the which was one of the noblest lynages of the world.
And beside all this there ran a brute of him among his own men how that he was
amyably alyed with the king of Granade / and with the king of Tresbell Maryne
/ and the king of Tresmesaries / who were all gods enemies and infydeles.
Wherefore some of his own men feared that he would do some hurt to his own
country as in violatyng of gods churches / for he began all ready to take fro
them their rentes and revenues / and held some of the prelates in prison and
co^streyned them by tyranny whereof great complayntes came daily to our holy
father the pope / requyring him to find some remedy. To whose complayntes the
pope condyscended and send incontinent messangers into Castle to y^ king
Dampeter / co^maundyng him that incontinent without any delay personally to
come to the court of Rome: to wass he / clens / and purge him of such vyllayne
deeds as he was gyltye in. Ho wbeit this king Da^peter full of pride and
presumtuousnesse would not obey nor come there but dealt shamefully with the
popes messa^gers / whereby he ran greatly in the indignacyon of y^ church / and
specially of the heed of the church as of our holy father the pope. Thus this
yuell king Dampeter perseuered still in his obstynatesynne. Than advise and
counsel was taken by the pope and by the coledge what way they might correct
him: and there it was determined that he was not worthy to bear y^ name of a
king / nor to hold any realm. And therein plain consistory in Auygnon / in
the chamber of exco^munycacion he was openly declared to be reputed as in
infidel. Tha^ it was thought that he should be constrained and corrected by
help of the companyons / that were as than in the realm of France. Than the
king of Aragon who hated the king of Castle was sent for and also Henry the
bastard of Spain / to come to Auygnon to the pope. And when they were come /
the pope made Henry the bastard legytyue and laufull to obtain the realm of
Castle / and Dampeter cursed and condemned by sentence of the pope. And there
the king of Aragon said how he would open the passage thorough his country /
and provide vitayls and purueyaunces for all manner of people and men of war /
that would pursue to go into Castle to co^founde king Dampeter / and to put
him out of his realm. Of this ordinance was y^ french king right joyous /
and did his pain to help to get out of prison sir Bettram of Clesquy / who
was prisoner with sir Johan Chandos / and paid for his rau^some a hundred. M.
frankes: part thereof paid the french king and the pope / and Henry the
bastard paid the resydu. And after his delyueraunce they fell in treaty with
the co^panyons / and promised the^ great profit if they would go into the
realm o^ Castle. Whereto they lightly agreed for a certain sum of money
that they had to depart among them. And so this journey was showed to the
prince of Wales and to the knights and squyers about him: and specially to sir
Johan Chandos / who was desyredde to be one of the these capitayns with sir
Bertram of Clesquy. Howbeit he excused him / and said he might not go thither:
yet the journey was not let for all that. And diverse knights of the princis
went thither: as sir Eustace Da^breticourt / sir Hew Caurell / sir Gaultier
Hewet sir Mathue Gorney / sir (...) Dalbret / and diverse other. And the chief
captain of this enterprice was made the lord John^ of Burbon earl of March
to counter wine the death of his cosyne the queen of Spain / and was in all
things ruled and counsayled by the advise of sir Bertra^ of Clesquy: for
therle of March was as than a ^oly young lusty knight. And also the lord
Antony of Beauieu went for the in that vyage and diverse other good knights: as
sir Arnolde Dandrehen marshall of France / the Begue of Uyllayns / the lord
Dantoyng in Heynalt / the lord of Brusnell / sir Johan Neuyll / sir Guynyars
of Baylheull / sir Johan of Berguetes / the almayne of saint Uenant / and
diverse other the which I can not name. And so all these lords and other
auau^ced for the in the vyage and made their assemble in Languedocke / and at
Mountpellyer / and therabout. And so passed all to Narbone to go toward
Parpygnen / and so to enter on that side in to the realm of Aragone. These men
of war were to the nombre of.xxx. thousand and there were the chief capitayns
of the companyons: as sir Robert Briquet / sir Johan Caruell / Nandon of
Bergerace / Lanny / the little Meclyne / the Bourge Camus / the Bourge de
Lespare Batyller Espyot / Aymemon Dortyng / Perote of Sauoy / and diverse other
all of accord and of one alyaunce / having great desire to put king Da^peter
out of the realm of Castle: and to make king they therle of Desco^ges his
brother Henry the bastard. And when these men of arms should enter into the
realm of Aragon / to do their enterprice ye more privily: they sent to king
Da^ / Peter to blind him by their message / but he was all ready well enfourmed
of their ententes / and how they were coming on him into ye realm of Castle
but he set nothing thereby: but assembled his people to resyst against the^ /
and to light with the^ at thentre of his realm. Their message was desyring him
to open the straytes of his country / and to give free passage to the pylgrimes
of god / who had enterprised by great devotion to go into the realm of Grenade
/ to reueng the death and passion of our lord Jesu Christ / and to distroy the
infydeles / and to exalte the christen faith. The king Dampeter at these
tidings did nothing but laugh and said he would do nothing at their desire /
nor obey in any point to such a rascal company. And when these knights and
other men of arms knew the will and answer of king Da^peter / whereby they
reputed him right orgulus and presumptuous / and made all the have they might
to auaunce to do him all the hurt they could. So they all passed through the
realm of Aragon where they found the passages ready open for them and vitayle
/ and every thing ready apparelled and at a metely price. For the king of Aragon
had great joy of their coming / trustyng than by their means to conquers
again fro the king of Castle all his lands / that king Dampeter had before
taken fro him byforce. And than these men of war passed the great river that
departs Castle and Aragon and so they entered into the realm of Spain. And
when they had conquered towns / cities / and castles / streytes / ports / and
passages / the which the king Dampeter had taken fro the king of Aragon.
Than sir Bertram and his company delivered the^ to the king of Aragon on the
co^dycion that always fro thens forth he should aid and conforte Henry the
bastard against Dampeter. Tidings came to ye king of Castle: how that the
frenchmen / bretons / englysshmen / normayns / pycardes / and burgonyons were
entered in to his realm: and were as than passed the great river / departing
Castle and Aragon. And how they had won again all on that side the river
the which cost (...) much pain and trouble or he wan it first Than he was
right sore dysplesed and said / well all shall not go so as they wene it shall:
than he made a special commandment throughout all his realm / in gyueng
knowledge to the^ that his letters and messa^gers were sent unto / that they
should without delay come to him / to the intent to fight with the men of war
that were entered into his realm of Castle / there were but a few that obeyed
his commandment. And when he had thought to have had a great assemble of men
of war he was disceyued / for few or none came to him: for his lords and
knights of Spain forsook and refused him / and turned to his brother y^
bastard. Wherefore he was feign to s^ye / or else he had been taken he was so sore
behated with his enemies: and also / with his own men / so that none abode
about him / except one true knight called Ferrant of Castres, he would never
forsake him for none adventure. And so than Dampeter went to Syuyle the best
city of Spaygne / and whan^e he was come thither he was in no great sewerty /
wherefore he trussed and put into cofers his treasure / and took a ship with
his wife and children. And so departed fro Cyuyle / and Ferra^t of Casters his
knight with him: and he arrived like a knight disconfyted in Galyce called the
Colo^gne where there was a strong castle / and therein he his wife and his
children entered that is to say two young daughters: Constance and Isabell. And
of all his men and counsel he had none but Ferrant of Castres.

Now let us show of Henry the bastard / how he he perceyuered in his
enterprice. Cap. C C.xxx.
THus as I have showed before / this king Da^peter was soore behated with his
own men / throughout all the realm of Castle: because of the marvelous
cruel justice that he had done / and by the occasyon of the distruccyon of the
noblemen of his realm / y^ which he had put to death and slain with his
hands. Wherefore as soon as they saw his bastard brother enter into the realm
with so great puyssau^ce / than they drue all to him and received him to their
lord: and so rode forth with him. and they caused cyte^s towns / borowes /
and castles to be opyned to him / and every man to do him homage. And so the
spanyardes all with one voice cried / live Henry / and dye Dampeter: who has
been to us so cruel and so yuell. This the lords led forth Henry
throughout all the realm of Castle / as the lord Gommegaulx / the great
master of Gallestrane / and the master of saint James. So thus all manner of
people obeyed to him and crowned him king in the city of Estyrages / and all
prelates / earls / barownes / and knights made him reverence / as to their
king. and swear always to maynteyne him as their king / or else if need
required to dye in the quarrel. So thus this king rode fro city to city / and
fro to wne to to wne: and always and in every place he had reverence done to
him like a king. And than^e he gave to the knights strangers / such as came
with him into the realm of Castle great gifts and rich jewels / so largely
that every man reputed him for a lyberall and an honorable lord. And commonly
the normayns / frenchmen / and bretons said that in him was all lyberalite /
and how he was well worthy to live / and to reygne over a great realm: and so
he did a season right puyssantly and in great prosperyte. Thus the bastard of
Spain came to the seignory of the realm of Castle / and he made his two
brethren Dancyle / and Sances / each of them an earl with great revenues and
profit. Thus this Henry was king of Castle / of Galyce / of Civil / of
Tollette / and of Lyssebone / unto such season as y^ puyssaunce of Wales and
Acquitayne put him out thereof. and set again king Dampeter into the
possessyon and signory of the foresaid realms / as ye shall here after in this
history.

When that this king Henry saw himself in this estate / and that every man
obeyed him and reputed him for their king and lord / and saw nothing lykely
to the contrary of his desire. Than he ymagined and cast his aduyce to exalte
his name / and to enploy the nombre of such companyo^s / as were come to serve
him out of the realm of France / to make a voyage on the king of Granade.
whereof he spoke to diverse knights / who were well agreed thereto. And always
this king Henry held still about him the princes knights: as sir Eustace
Da^bretycourt / sir Hugh Caurell and other. And showed them great token and
sign of love / in trust that they should aid and serve him in his voyage to
Grenade / whyder he hoped to go. And anon after his coronacyon / there
departed fro him the most part of the knights of France / and he gave them
great gifts at their departing. And so than returned the earl of March /
sir Arnolde Da^drehen / the lord Beauieou and diverse other / but sir Bertram
of Clysquy tarried still in Castle with the king / and sir Olyuer of Manny /
and the Bretons with certain nombre of the companyons. And so than sir Bertram
of Clesquy was made constable of all the realm of castle by the acorde of
king Henry and all the lords of the country. Now let us speak of king
Dampeter how he maynteyned himself.

How king Dampeter required the prince of wales to aid him against his
brother. Cap. CC.xxxi.
VE have Well herd how king Dampeter was driven into the casteil of Colo^gne
on the sea / and with him his wife / his two daughters / and Domferrant of
Castres with him all only. So that in ye mean season that his brother the
bastard by puyssance of the me of war that he had got out of France
conquered Castle: and that all the country yielded the^ to him as ye have herd
before. He was right ^ore afraid / and not well assured in the castle of
Colongne / for he douted greatly his brother the bastard / for he knew well
that if he had knowledge of his being there / he would come with puyssaunce and
besege him: wherefore he thought he would not abide that parell. Therefore he
departed in a night and took a ship / and his wife / his two daughters / and
Domferra^t of Castres: and all the gold / silver / and sowelles that they had.
but the wind was to him so contrary that he could not draw fro the cost: and
so was feign to enter again into the fortress of Colongne. Than the king
Dampeter demanded of Do^ferrant his knight how he should maynteyne him self
/ complayninge of fortune that was to him so contrary. Sir quod the knight or
ye deperte fro hens / it were good ye ye did send to your cosyn the prince of
Wales / to know if he would receive you or not / and for pytic: somewhat to
tender your need and necessyte / for diverse ways he is bound thereto. by
reason of the great alyaunces that the king his father / and yours had
toguyder. The prince of Wales is so noble / and so gentle of blood and of
courage / that when he knows your trybulacion / I think verily he will take
thereof great compassyon. And if he will aid to set you again in your realm /
there is none that can do it so well in all the world: he is so fered /
redouted * and beloned with all men of war. And sir ye are here in a good
strong forteresse to keep a season till ye here other tidings out of
Acquitayne. To this counsel acorded lightly ye king Da^peter. Tha^ he wrote
letters right pyteous and amyable / and a knight with two squyers were desired
to do this message: and so they took on them that journey and entered into the sea / and sailed so long that they arrived at Bayon / the which city held of
the king of England. Than they demanded tidings of the prince / and it was
showed them how he was at Burdeaur. Than they took their horses and rode so
long that they came to Burde aux / and there took their lodging: and anon
after they went to the abbey of saint Andrews where the prince was. And there
these messangers showed how they were come out of Castle / and were
spanyardes and messangers fro king Da^peter of Castle. And when the prince
knew thereof / he said he would se them: and know what they would have. And
so they came and kneled down and saluted him acordynge to their usage / and
recommaunded the king their master to him / and delivered their letters. The
prince took up the messa^gers and received their letters / and opyned and reed
them at good leyser: wherein he found how pyteously king Dampeter wrote /
signifyeng to him all his poverty and myschiefe. and how that his brother the
bastard by puissaunce / and by the great amyties that he had purchased. First
of the pope / of the french king / and of ye king of Aragon: and by the help
of the co^panyons / had put him out fro the heritage of the realm of Castle.
Wherefore he desired the prince for goddessake / and by the way of pytie: that
he would entend to provide for him some counsel and remedy / wherein he should
achyue grace of god and of all the world. For it is not ye right way of a true
christian king to di^^herpt a right full heir / and to enheryte by puyssaunce of
tyranny a bastard. And the prince who was a valyant knight and a sage closed
the letters in his hands / and said to the messangers. Sirs ye be right
welcome to me / fro my cosyn the king of Castle: ye shall tarry a space here
with us / and are ye depart ye shall have an answer. Than the princes
knights who knew ryghtwell what they had to do / led to their logynges the
spaynisshe knight and the two squyers and the prince who tarried still in his
chamber mused greatly on those tidings. And thanne sent for sir John^ Chandos
/ and for sir Thom^s Phelton / two of the chief of his counsel: for the one
was the seneshall of Aquitayne / and the other constable. And when they were
come to him / than he said to them all smiling, sirs ye shall here new
tidings out of Spaygne. The king Dampeter our cosyn complayneth him greatly of
the bastard Henry his brother / who has taken fro him his enheritau^ce / and
has put him out of his realm: as ye have herd reported by them that has
come fro thens / and he requires us instantly of our confort and aid as it
apereth here by his letters. And so than ye prince reed the letters word by
word a two times / and these two knights herd well all the matter. and when
he had reed ye letters / than he said to them: sirs ye two / sir John^ and ser
Thomas ye are the most special of my counsel / and in whom I have most trust
and assyaunce. wherefore I desire you counsel me what ye think were best to
do. Than these two knights beheld each other without any word spekyng / tha^
the prince again said. sirs speak hardely what ye think in this matter / and
there the price was cou^selled by those two knights as I was informed / that he
should send to the king Da^peter men of war to Colo^gne where he was /
acordinge to the tenor of the letters: and also by the report of the
messangers. and ye the men of war should bring him to the cite of Burdeur /
and there more plainly to know what he would say / and than acordyng as they
should here his words / to take aduyce: and to give him such counsel as of
reason should suffyce him. This answer pleased right well the prince: tha^ he
desired to go to Colo^gne in that viage to bring in sauegard to him the king
Da^peter. First sir Thom^s Felton as sovereign and chief of that army / sir
Richard of Po^tchardon / sir Neez Lornyche / sir Symonde Burle / sir Wyllm^
^rousealx / and in that army there should be.xii. ships furnisshed with
archers and men of war. So these knights made their prouisyon to go into
Galice / and than the messangers depted fro Burdeux and rode with them to Bayon
/ and there tarried a three or four days abiding for wind and weder. and the.v.
day as they were de^tynge / the king Da^peter of castle aryued at Bayon
himself / for he was deperted fro Colongue in great have and dout / for he
durst not abide there any le^ger / and brought but a few of his men With him /
and such treasur as he had. So the tidings of his coming was great joy to
theglysshmen than sir Thomas Phelton and his company ca^e to him and received
him right swetely / and showed him how they were there ready by ye commandment
of ye prince their lord to have come to him to Colo^gne and to any other place
to have brought him to ye prince. Of the which tidings ye king Da^peter was
right ioyouse / and thanked greatly the prince and the knights that were there.

The coming of the king Dampeter thus to Bayon / sir Thom^s Phelton and the
other knights certifyed the price thereof / of the which he was right ioyouse.
and within a short space after / these knights brought the king Da^peter to ye
cite of Burdeux. And the prince who greatly desired to se his cosyn the king
Da^peter / and to do him the more honor and feast / issued out of Burdeux
aco^panyed with diverse knights and squiers / and went and met the king and
did to him great reverence both in word and deed / the which he could do
right well / for there was no prince in his time ye could show more honor
than he. And when the prince had well feasted him / than they rode to Burdeux /
and the prince took the king above him / in no wise he would do otherwise. And
as they rode together the king Da^peter showed to the prince how his bastard
brother had chased him out of his realm of castle / and also he pituously
co^playned him of ye untruth of his men / showing how they had all forsaken
him / except one knight the which was there with him called Damferrant of
Castres. The price right curtesly and sagely reco^forted him / desyring him not
to be abashed nor disconforted / for though he had as than lost all / he
trusted it should be in the puyssance of god to restore him again all his
loss / and moreover to take vengeance of all his eneymes. Thus as they talked
together / they rode so long ye they came to Burdeux / and a lyghted at they
abbey of saint Andrues / where as the prince and princes kept their house / and
than the king was brought to a fair chamber ready aparelled for him. and when
he was changed he went to the princess and to the ladies / who received him
right curtesly as they could right well do. I might over long make report to
you of this matter / what of their chere / feestes / and sportes: wherefore I
pass it over brefely. And shall show you how king Da^petersped with the
prince his cosyn / whom he found right amyable and curtesse and well
co^dyscended to his desyers: howbeit there were some of his counsel said unto
him / as ye shall here after. Or that Dampeter came to Bordeaux / some wise and
sage y maginatyue lords / as well of Gascoyn as of England / who were of t^^
princes counsel / and had ever truly served him and given him good counsel /
and so thought ever to do. They said to the prince: Sir ye have herd say
diverse times / he that to much enbraseth / holds the wekelyer. Hit is for a
truth that ye are one of the princess of the world: most praised /
honored / and redouted / and holds on this side the sea great lands and
seignories thanked be god in good rest and peace. There is no king nere nor far
of / as at this present time yt dare displease you ye are so renomed of good
chiualry / grace / and good fortune. ye ought therefore by reason to be content
with that ye have / and seek not to get you any enemies. Sir we say not this for
non yuell we knowell the king Da^peter of Castle who is now driven out of his
realm / is a man of hye mind / right cruel and full of yuell condycions: for
by him has been done many yuell deeds in the realm of Castle / and has
caused many a valyant man to lose his heed: and brought cruelly to an end
without any manner of reason. and so by his vilayne deeds and consent he is now
disceyued and put out of his realm / and also beside all this he is enemy to
the church / and cursed by our holy father ye pope: he is reputed and has been
a great season like a tyrant / and without tytell of reason has always grieved
and made war with his neybours / the king of Aragon and the king of Nauer /
and would have dishetyted the^ by puissance. And also as the brute ro^neth
throughout his realm / and by his own me^ how he caused to dye his wife your
cosyn daughter to the duke of Burbone. Wherefore sir ye ought to think and
consydre that all this yt he now suffers / ar rods and strokes of god sent
to chastyce him: and to give ensample to all other christen kings and princes
to beware that they do not as he has done. With such words or se^blable the
prince was cou^selled or king da^peter arrived at Bayon: but to these words
the prince answered thus. Saying lords I think and believe certe^ly that ye
counsel me truly to the best of your powers I know well and am well
enfourmed of the life and state of this king Da^peter / and know well yt
without no^bre he has done many yuell deeds: whereby now he is disceyued. But
the cause present yt moves and gives us courage to be willing to aid him is
as I shall show you. It is not couenable that a bastard should hold a realm
in heritage and put out of his own realm his brother ryghtfull enheryter to
the land / the which thing all kings and kings sons should in no wise
suffer nor consent to / for it is a great prejudice against the state royal.
and also beside that the king my father and this king Da^peter has a great
season ben alyed together by great co^federacions / wherefore we are bound to
aid him / in cause yt he require and desire us so to do. Thus ye prince was
moved in his courage to aid and comfort this king Da^peter in his trouble and
besynes. Thus he answered to his counsel and they could not remove him cut of
that purpose / for his mind was ever more and more fermely set on yt matter.
And when king Da^peter of Castle was come to ye prince to the cite of Burdeux
/ he humyled him self right swetely to the prince and offered to him great
gifts and profit / in saying that he would make Edward his eldest son^e
king of Galyce / and yt he would deperte to him and to his men great good and
richesse / the which he had left behind him in the realm of Castle / because
he durst not bring it with him: but this riches was in so sure keeping yt none
knew where it was but himself to the which words ye knights gave good
intent / for englysshmen and gasco^s naturally are couetouse. Than the prince
was counseled to assemble all the barons of the duchy of acquitayne and his
special counsel / and so there was at Burdeux a great counsel. And there the
king Da^peter showed openly how he would meyntayne him self / and how he would
satisfy every man / if the prince would take on him to bring him again into
his country. Tha^ there were letters written and messangers sent forth / and
lords and knights sent for all about / as therle of Armynake / therle of
Comygines / the lord Dalbret / the earl of Carmayne / the Captall of Beufz /
the lord of Cande / the vycount of Chastyllon / the lord of Lescute / the
lord of Rosem the lord of Lespare / the lord of Chamont / the lord of
Musydent / the lord of Turtoni ye lord of Pyncornet / and all the other
barons and knights of Gascoyne / and of Uerne. And also therle of Foix was
desired to come thither / but he would not: but excused him self by cause he
had a disease in his leg and might not ride / but he sent thither his
counsel.

TO this parlyament thus holden in ye cite of Burdeux came all the earls /
vycou^tes / barons / and wise men of Aquitayne / of Xaynton / Poictou / Duercy
/ Lymosyn / and of Gascoyn. And when they were all come / they went to counsel
three days / on the state and ordinance for this king Da^peter of Spain who
was always there present in the counsel with the prince his cosyn / reasonyng
always to fortify his quarrel and business. Finally the prince was cou^selled
yt he should send suffycie^t messangers to the king his father into England to
know his counsel what he should do in yt case. And his pleasure and answer
ones known / than all ye lords said they would take counsel together / and so
make the price such an answer that of reason he should be well content. Than
there were chosen and named four knights of y^ princes that should go into
England to the king / that is to say: sir Dalawar / sir Noell Lornisshe / sir
Johan and sir Hely of Pomyers. Thus than deperted and brake up this counsel /
and every man went home to their own houses: and king Dam peter tarried still
at Burdeux with the prince and princess who did him much honor / and made
him great feast and chere. And than the forsaid four knights depted who were
appointed to go into England / and they took shippyng and sped so well in their
journey by the help of god and the wind that they arrived at Hampton / and
there rested one day to refresshe the / and to vnship their horses and caryages.
and the second day took their horses and rode so long y^ they came to the cite
of London. and there they demanded where the king was / and it was showed the^
how he was at Wynsore. And thither they me^t and were right welcome and well
received both with the king and with y^ queen / as well because they were
pteyning to the prince their son / as also because they were lords and
knights of great reco^mendacion. Than they delivered their letters to the king
/ and the king opened and reed them / and when he had a little studied than he
said. Sirs ye shall go to your logynges / and I shall send to you certain
lords and wise m^ of my counselle / and they shall answer you with short
expedicyon. This answer pleased well these knights / and the next day they
returned to London. and within a short space after the king came to Westminster and
with him the most grettest of his counsel: as his son^e the duke of Lancaster
/ therle of Aru^dell / therle of Salysbury / therle of Ma^ny / sit Reynold
Cobham / the earl Percy / the lord Neuyll and diverse other and prelates there
were the bishop of Wynche stre / of Lyncolne / and of London. And so they kept
a great counsel and a long upon the Princes letters / and on his request that
he had made to y^ king his father: finally it seemed to the king and his
counsel athyng due and reasonable for the prince to take on him to bring again
the king of Spaygne into his own heritage: and to this they all openly agreed.
And thereupon they wrote notable letters / dyrected fro the king and fro y^
counsel of England to the prince / and to all the barons of aqtayn. and so
with these letters y^ said messangers depted again to the cite of Burdeux /
where as they found the prince and the king Da^peter / to whom they delivered
letts fro the king of England. Than was there a new day of counsel set to be
had in the cite of Burdeux / and thither ca^e all such as were sent for. Than
there was reed openly in the counsel the king of Englandes letters / the which
devised plainly: how he would that the prince his son in the name of god and
saint George / should take on him to set again king Da^peter into his heritage /
the which his bastard brother wrongfully had taken fro him without reason /
and falsely as it apereth / has put him out thereof. Also y^ kings letters
made me^cyon how he was much bound thereto / because of certain alyaunces of
old time made / between him and the king of Castle his cosyn / as to aid him
if case reqred / if he were thereto desired. Wherefore he desired by his letters
all his friends and subgettes that the prince his son might be aided and
counseled by them / as well as though he were there present him self. And when
the barons of Acquitayne herd reed these letters and commandments of the
king / and pceyued the kings pleasure and the princes their lord. Tha^ they
toyously answered and said: sir weshall gladly obey the king our sovereign
lords commandment / it is reason that we obey you and him and so we will do
/ and serve you in this vyage and king Da^peter in likewise / but sir we would
know who should pay us our wages: for it will be hard to get out men of war
into a strange country. Than the prince beheld king Da^peter and said: sir
king ye here what our people say answer you the^ / for it behooves you to
answer / seeing the matters be yours. Than y^ king Da^peter answered y^ prince
and said / right dear cosyn as ferr as the gold silver and treasur that I have
brought hyder which is not y^.xxx. part somoch as I have left behynd me / as
long as that will endure I shall give and part there with to your people. Than
the prince said: sir ye say well / and as for the remnant I shall beco^e dettour
to the^ / and pay the^ as the case requires the which I shall lend you / and
all that we need till we come in to castle. Sir quod the king Da^peter ye do
me great curtesy and grace / and in this counsel there were diverse sage men:
as therle of Armynake / the lord of Pomyers / sir John^ Chandos / the Captall
of Beufz and diverse other / who co^sydred that the prince coudenat well make
this vyage without the acorde and consent of the king of Nauer / for they could
not enter into spain but through his country / and through the straytes of
Rayncenalt / the which passage they were not in surety to have / because y^
king of Nauer and Henry the bastard had newly made alyau^ce together. So thus
there was much comunynge how they might do to achyue their purpose: than was
it determined yt there should be another day assigned of a counsel to be kept
at the city of Bayon / and that ye prince should send suffycient ambassadors
to ye king of Nauer / desyring him to be at that counsel in Bayon. And so on
this determynacion every man deperted fully concluded to be at Bayon the day
lymyted and prefixed. In ye mean season the prince sent sir Johan Chandos and
sir Thomas Phelton to the king of Nauerre / who was as than^e in the city of
Panpylone. These two sage and well languaged knights did so much that they
came to the king of Nauer / who made faithful covenant by word and by
writing sealed to be at the said parlyament at Bayon / and thereon the
messangers returned again to the prince and showed him these tidings.

THe day assigned of this perlyament there came to the cite of Bayon: the king
of Spain Dampeter / the prince / the earl of Armynacke / the lord Dalbreth /
and all the barons of Gascoyne / Poictou / Guercy / Rouerne / Xayntonge / and
Lymosyne. And thither came personally the king of Nauer: and the prince and king
Dampeter did him great honor / because they thought the better to speed with
him. So thus in the city of Bayon there was a great counsel / the which
endured.v. days and the prince and his counsel had much to do / or they
could bring the king of Nauerr to their desire / for he was a man not easy to
be woune if he saw that me^ had any need of him How be it the great (...) ower
of ye prince brought him into that case: that finally he swear / promised / and
sealed to king Dampeter: peace / love and ferme alyaunce and confederacion. And
in like manner king Da^peter did to him / upon certain co^posicyons that were
there ordained Of the which the prince of Wales was a mean between them / and
chief deuysour thereof. The which was that the king Dampeter as king of all
Castle: gave / sealed / and acorded to the king of Nauer / and to his heirs
for ever: all the land of Groyng / as it lies on both sides the river. And
also all the land and country of Sauanter: with the town / castle / and all
the appurtenau^ces. Also the town of saint John^ de Prede port / and the
marchesse there about / the which lands / towns / castles and seignories he
had taken fro him byforce. And also that the king of Nauer should have.xx.
thousand fra^kes for the opening of his country / and to suffer pass peasably
all manner of men of war / and to mynistre to them vitayls and purueyau^ces
for their money. Of the which som^e of florens the king Dampeter became
dettour to ye king of Nauer. And when the barownes of Acquytayne knew that
this treaty was made and co^fermed / than they desired to know who should pay
them their wages. And the price who had great affection to ward this vyage /
beca^e dettour to them for their wages. and the king Da^peter beca^e dettour to
the prince. And when all these things were ordained and fully confermed / and
that every man knew what he ought to do and what he should have: and y^ they
had soiourned there the space of.xii. days. Than ye king of Nauer departed
home into his own country / and all other lords departed every man to his
own / and the prince went to Bordeaux and the king Da^peter tarried still at
Bayone. Than the prince sent his haraldes into Spain / to certain knights
and capitayns englysshemen and gascoyns / favorable and obeysaunt to him /
signifyenge them how that it was his pleasure y^ they should take their leaves
of Henry the bastard and come to him / saying how he had need of them / and
was of thentent to employ and ocupy the^ otherwise. And when these haraldes had
brought these letters into Castle to these knights fro the prince / and that
they per ceyued the princes pleasure: tha^ they took their leave of king Henry
as soon as they could in curtesse manner / without discoueryng of the prices
entencyon. Than this bastard king Henry who was right lyberall / curtesse /
and honorable gave them license with many great gifts / and thanked them
greatly of their service. So than deperted fro Spain sir Eustace Da^bretycourt
/ sir Hew Caurell / sir Water Huet / sir Mathue Gorney / sir Johan Deureux and
their company / and diverse other knights and squiers the which I can not all
name of ye princes house: and they departed as shortly as they might. The same
season the companyons were spedde abroad in the country and knew nothing what
these said knights did / howbeit wha^ they knew it they gadered to gyder /
as sir Robert Briquet / Johan Treuyll / sir Rebours / ser Perducas Dalbreth /
sir Garses du chaste / Na^don of Bergerant / the Bourge of Lespare / the bourg
Camus / and the bourg Bartuell. and this bastard king Henry knew not yt the
prince was in mind to bring again his brother da^peter into Castle so soon
as these knights did for if he had known it / they should not have departed
so soon as they did: for he might well have let them if he had known it.
So these knights departed / and as soon as king Henry knew thereof he made no
great semblant of it / but said to sir Bertra^ of Clesquy who was still about
him. Sir Bertram behold ye prince of Wales / it is she wed us that he will
make us war and bring again that jew who calls him self king of Spaygne
byforce into this our realm / sir what say you thereto. Sir Bertram answered
and said: sir he is so valyant a knight that if he take on him y^ enterprice he
will do his power to acheue it if he may. Therefore sir I say to you / cause
your passages and straytes on all sides to be well kept: so that none may pass
nor enter into your realm but by your lyce^ce. And sir keep yor people in love
/ I know certainly ye shall have in France many knights and great aid / the
which gladly will serve you. Sirby your license I will return thither / and in
the mean time keep yor people in love / and I know well I shall find in
France many friends. And sir I shall get you as many as I can. By my faith
quod king Henry ye say well / and I shall order all the remenant acordyng to
your will. and so within a little space after sir Bertram departed and went
into Aragon where the king received him ioyously / and there he tarried a.xv.
days / and tha^ departed and went to Mountpellyer and there found the duke of
An^^ou / who also received him ioyously / as he whom he loved right entierly.
And wha^ he had been there a season he departed and went into France to the king
/ who received him with great joy.

How that king Henry alyed him to the king of Aragon / and of the me^ that the
prince sent for / and how the prince was counsayled to pursue his war / and
of the lord Dalbreth who disco^fyted the seneshall of Tholous. Cap. CC.xxxii.
WHa^ the tidings was spread abroad in Spain / in Aragon / and in France that
the prince of Wales would bring again king da^ peter in to the realm of
Castle. There were many had thereof great marueyle / and much comunyng was
thereof. Some said that ye prince took on him ye enterprice for pride and
presu^pcyon / and was in a manner angry of the honor ye sir Bertra^ of Clesquy
had gotten him / in conqueryng of the realm of Castle / in the name of king
Henry who was by him made king. Some other said ye pity and reason moved the
prince to be in will to aid the king Dampeter. and to bring him again into
his heritage: for it is not a thing due nor reasonable for a bastard to keep a
realm / nor to have the name of a king. Thus in diverse places there were diverse
knights and squyers of sondrie opynions / howbeit incontinent king Henry
wrote letters to the king of Aragon and send to him great messangers /
desyringe him that he should in no wise acorde nor make no co^posicion with the
price / nor with none of his alyes: promysing him ever to be his good neighbor
and friend. Than the king of Aragon who loved him entierly / and also often
times he had found king Dampeter right fell and cruel / said and made a full
assurance that for to lose a great part of his realm / he would make no
manner of agreement with the prince / nor accord with king Da^peter. Promysinge
also to open his country / and to suffer to pass through all manner of men of
war such as would go in to Spain / or into any other place to his confort
and aid / and to let them to his power that would grieve or trouble him.
This king of Aragon kept well and truly his promise yt he made to this king
Henry / for as soon as he knew the truth that king Dampeter was aided by ye
prince / and that the co^panyons were drawyng to that party. Inco^tynent he
closed all the passages in Aragon and straightly kept them / he set men of war
on the mountayns to watch the passages and straytes of Catholon / so y^ none
could pass but in great parell. Howbeit the co^panyons found another way /
but they suffered much yuell and great traueyle or they could pass and escape
the dangers of Aragon / howbeit they came to the marchesse of the county of
Foyz / and found the country closed against them: for therle would in no wise
that such people should enter into his country. These tidings came to the
prince to Burdeux who thought and ymagined night and day how with his honor he
might furnysshe that vyage / and to find the means how the said companyons
might come into Acquitayne / for he herd how the passages of Aragon were
closed / and how they were at the enter of the county of Foyz / in great
pain and disease. So the prince dowted that this king Henry and the king of
Aragon would so deal with these co^panyons / who were in nombre a.xii.
thousand / that other for fear or for gifts cause the^ to take their part a
gaynst him. Thasie the prince determined to send to them sir John^ Chandos to
treat with them and to retain them and do him service / and also to the earl
of Foyz / desyringe him for love and amyte to do no displeasure to these
co^panyons / promysing him y^ what soever yuell or damage they do to him or to
any part of his country / that he would make amends thereof to the double.
This message to do for his lord sir Johan Chandos took on him / and so
departed fro the cite of Burdeux and rode to the cite of Aste in Gascoyne. and
rode so long that he came to therle of Foyz / and did somoche with him that he
was of his acorde and suffered him to pass throughout his country peasably. and
he found the companyons in a country called Basell and there he treated with
them and sped so well that they made all covenant with him to serve and aid
the prince in his viage / upon a certain som^e of money that they should have
in pressed / the which sir John^ Chandos swear and promised them that they should
have. And than he came again to therle of Foyz / desyringe him right swetely
y^ these people who were retained with the prince might be suffered to pass by
one of the sides of his country. and the earl of Foyz who was right agreeable to
the prince / and in a manner was his subgette to please him was agreed / so that
they should do no hurt to him nor to his country. Sir Johan Chandos made
covenant with him that they should do no manner of damage / and than sent a
squire and a haralde to these companyons with the treaty that was made bit wene
him and therle of Foiz and than he returned to the prince and recounted to him
how he had spedde. The price who byleued and loved him right well was well
content with y^ he had done in his voyage. In this season the prince was in the
lusty flower of his youth / and he was never wety nor full satysfyed of war /
sithe the first beginning that he bare arms: but ever intended to achyue high
deeds of arms. And as to this enterprice and ^^age into Spain / and to set
again y^ king that was chased out thereof byforce of arms into his own realm
/ honor and pytie moved him thereto. and often times he spoke to sir Johan
Chandos and to sir Thomas Phelton / who were most special of his counsel /
demaundyng of the^ what they thought. These knights answered that they thought
nothing but well / and said. Sir certainly this, is a gretter enter price
without comparyson / than it was to put out of his realm this king Dampeter /
for he was hated of all his men. and every man for / soke him when he had
thought they would have aided him. Now is possessed at this present time of
all the realm the bastard king / and entierly he has the love of all the
nobles / prelates * and all other in the realm / and they have made him king /
and have promised to maynteyne him in y^ estate what soever befall. Therefore sir
it will be behouable for you / to have in your company great foysson of men of
arms and archers: for ye shall find well with who^e to fight if ye come into
Spain. Sir I counsel you to break the greattest part of plate and treasure
whereof ye have great plenty / and make thereof money to deperte thereof largely
to the co^panyons / such as will serve you this voyage for the love of you
they are content to go / but as for the love of king Dampeter they would not
serve him. and also sirsend into England to the king your father / desyring
him to aid you with a hundred thousand frankes / y^ which the french king
ought to send into England in short space. Sir gather asmoche money as ye can
/ for it shall greatly stand you in hand so to do / without taxyng or
talagyng any of your subgettes or country: ye shall y^ better be served and be
loved. To this counsel and to diverse other good and true counsayles given to
the prince by these knights he was content there with / and caused two pertes
of his plate to be broken^e and to make money thereof / to give thereof largely
to the said companyons. and also he sent into England to the king his father
/ for the foresaid hundred thousand frankes. The king of England who
parceyued well the business and need of y^ prince his son acorded lightly to
his request. And sent letters to the french king to pay the said som^e to the
bringer thereof. and send him aquytau^ce for the same sum. So these hundred
thousand fra^kes were delivered and brought to the prince / who departed it
among all his men of war.

ON a day the prince was in his chamber a sporting in the cite of Angolesme /
and with him diverse other knights of Gascoyne / Poyctou / and of England. And
there he bourded with them and they with him: and talked of this vyage into
Spain / in the mean season that sir Johan Chandos was for the co^panyons. The
prince turned his heed to ward the lord Dalbreth and said to him: sir
Dalbreth with what nombre of men of war may ye well serve me in this viage /
sir (...) he if I desire my fre^des I may well make you a thousand spears and
my land kept. A (...) the prince that is a fair thing / and turned him to
sir Thomas Phelton and toward other knights of England / and said to them
in english: by my faith one ought well to love y^ land where there is such a
baron that can serve his lord with a thousand spears. Than he turned him
again to the lord Dalbreth and said / sir I retain them all to do me service
this vyage / sir (...) he in the name of god I am content. Of this retayning
fell after great myschiefe / as ye shall here in this history.

Now let us return to the companyons that were alyed and retained with the
prince. They suffered much yuell and trouble or they entered into y^
principalyte of Catholon and Aragon / and were feign to depart into three
companyes. The grettest part went costyng Foiz and Borne: the second Cathelone
and Armynake: and the third went by Aragon / by the acorde of therle Dalbreth
/ therle of Armynake / and therle of Foyz / and in that company were most
part gascoyns. And that company who were about a three thousand went divided
into diverse companyes / a three hundred or four hundred together / and drew
toward the bysshopriche of Toulouse and Mountanbon. Than there was a knight of
France seneshall of Tholous called Guy Dazay / who when he knew that the
companyo^s aproched and rode a sondre in companyes / and that all they together
passed not the no^bre of three thousand / and herd how they were sore weary
with traueyle / and but yuell armed and horsed / and worse arrayed. Than he
said that he would not suffer that any such people should aproche Tholous nor
the realm of France / wherefore he said by the pleasure of god he would go and
fight with them. Than he sent his mind and purpose to the lord Amorry earl of
Narbon / the seneshall of Carcasson / and to him of Beaucayre / and to all
knights / squyers / and officers therabout: sendyng and requiryng them of aid
/ to keep and defend the fronters against these yuell co^panyons. And all
such as he sent unto obeyed and hasted to come to him as soon as they might
into the cite of Tholous. And when they were come together they were in nombre a
five hundred spears / knights and squyers / and a four thousand of other men
of the country. And they all took the feldes toward Montaubon a.vii. leages
fro Tholous / they that came first passed forth abiding for their company.

When the earl of Narbone and sir Guy Dazay / who were sovereign leaders of the
french army / were departed fro the cite of Tholous / they went and lodged
nere to Montanbon / the which as than was under the obeysaunce of y^ prince /
and therein was a captain a knight named sir Johan Comes. Than these lords of
France sent their currours before Montaubon to thentent to draw out of the
fortress the companyons that were there within. And wha^ the captain knew
that the frenchemen were come thither with an army he had great marueyle *
because the land parteyned to the price. Than he spoke with his company / and
did so much that by assurance he spoke with y^ french currours / and
demanded who had sent the^ thither / and why they auaunced them to ouerron the
princes land / the which was their neybour / and seeing that the prince was
friend to y^ king and realm of France. Sir (...) they we are not commanded
of our lords to make you any answer. But to content your mind if ye will go
or send to them they will make you an answer. Well sir said the captain /
and than I desire you to go to them / and desire them to send me a save
conduct / whereby I may go and come to them / or else to send me word plainly
by what tytell they will make war against me / for if I knew the certayntie
I would send word thereof to my lord the prince / who will shortly provide for
remedy. Sirsayd they we shall go and show ^our desire. And so they returned
and showed their lords all those words / and than there was a save conduct
get in the name of sir Johan Comes and brought to Montabon. Than he departed
and five with him / and went to the french lodgings / and there found the
french lords who were ready to receive him / and were ready aduysed how to
answer him. He saluted them / and they him again. Than he demanded for what
cause they had sent their currours with an army of men a war before the
fortress of Mountaubon / the which parteyned to y^ prince. They answered him
and said: sir we will invade no person nor make war / but we will chase our
enemies where soever we know that they be. Sir said the knight who be they
that be your enemies / and where be they. In the name of god said the earl of
Narbon: they are within Montaubon / and are robbers and pyllers of the country
/ and such as has sore ouerron the realm of France. And to you sir Johan if
you were curtesse to your neighbors / ye would not suffer them to pyll and
rob the poor people without cause as they do for by such tytell and means
there moves often times great hatred and discord between lords and princes.
Therefore put the^ out of your forteresse / or else ye be no friend to the
french king / nor to his realm. Lords (...) the captain: it is of a
truth there be men of war within my garyson sent thither fro my lord ye
prince / and retained to serve him / therefore I am not in mind to cause them
to depart so suddenly. If they have done you any displeasure / yet I can not se
that ye do them right / for they are men of war / they must live as they have been acustomed on the realm of France and on the princes land. Than therle of
Narbone and sir Guy Dazay said: yea they be men of war such as can not live /
but by pyllage and robbery: and have vncurtesly over ryden our countrees / the
which they shall derely abye / if we may get them in the field / for they
have taken / brent / pylled and done many an yuell deed ^n the bands of
Tholous. Where of ye grievous complayntes ar come to our heryng / and if we
should suffer them thus to continue / we should he false traitors to the king
our soueraygne lord / who has set us here to keep and defend this his
country. Also show them fro us / sithe we know where they be we shall find
the^: for they shall make us amends / or else it shall cost us more. Other
answer the captain of Mo^taubon could not have of them / but so departed
right yuell content with them in his mind: and said for all their threttes he
would not break his entencyon. And so returned to his forteresse / and showed
all these words to his company.

When these companyons herd these tidings / they were than not well assured:
for they were not able to make party against the fre^chemen. So they held
themself ever ready and took good wache: and so it fortuned that a.v. days
after these words / sir Perducas Dalbreth with a great route of companyons
should pass by Moutaubon / forther was their passage to enter into the
principalyte. Than he gave knowledge thereof to them of the town: and when sir
Robert Cem / and the other companyons who were there in the town closed and be
sieged by the frenchmen / knew of y^ tidings they were right glad. Than
they sent word secretly to sir Perducas and to his company how ye frenchemen
had be sieged them / and thretned them greatly: and also sent them word what
capytayns they were and what nombre. And when sir Perducas herd that / he was
nothing abashed: but drew together his company and ca^e and entered into
Montaubon / where they were received with great joy. Than they all together
devised how they should maynteyn themself / and agreed: that the next
morning they should be armed and issue out of the town / and draw them
toward the frenchmen, and to desire them that they might pass by them
peasably / and if they would not suffer them to pass: than to fight with them
/ and adventure theymselfe to the best of their power. And as they had
determined so they did / for in the morning they armed them and sowned their
trumpettes and mounted on their horses: and than issued out of Montaubon. The
frenchmen were ready raunged in the field when they hard the brute and noise
before Montaubon / so that these co^panyons could not pass but through the^.
Tha^ sir Perducas Dalbreth / and sir Robert Cem rode out before / and by
assurau^ce went and spoke with the french lords / desyring them to suffer
that they might pass by them peasably / but y^ frenchmen said how they had no
lust to comen with the^. Saying how they should not pass that way / without
it were with the points of their spears and swerdes. and than the frenchmen
cried their cries / and said auaunce baners toward yonder pyllers and robbers
/ who robs all the world / and lives on every man without cause or reason.
And when the companyons saw surely how it behooved them to fight / or else to
dye there with shame. Than they alyghted of their horses and rau^ged them self
a fore to abide for their enemies / who were fyersly coming toward them: and
in likewise they a lyghted and came a foot. There they began to shote and to
chase each other / and to give great strokes / so that there were many beaten
down on both parties. There was a sore and fierce battle / well fought and
many a feate of arms done and achyued / many a knight and squyers laid a long
on the earth / how beit the frenchemen were two against one. Wherefore at the
beginnynge they did drive the companyons back into the barrers of the town:
at which entryng there was many a man slain. And the companyons had been in a
hard case and the captain of the town had not ben: for he caused to be
armed all manner of people / and commanded straytly that every man to his power
should aid and help the companyons / who were retained with the prince. Than
they of y^ town armed them and put them in array / and entered into ye
skirmysshe: the women of ye town entered into the houses / and went up into the
batylmentes and solers / and cast down on the frenchmen stones and hot chalk
/ so thycke that they had nioche a do to cover them with their targes. And
diverse of them were so sore hurt that they were feign to recule back / whereby
y^ companyons took courage / who were a fore in great parell. Than they invaded
the frenchmen fresshly again / at wiche time there were such feats of arms
done / prisoners taken and rescued again / that like case had not bensene long
time before. The companyons were but a few in regard to the frenchmen /
howbeit every man did his pain to do the best he could: and so biforce of
arms they drove out of ye town the frenchmen. And it fortuned that in ye same
season while this battle was thus foughten / y^ another rout of the co^panyons
who were led by the bourge of Bertuell / and Nandon of Bergerant / to the
nombre of four. C. they entered on the backesyde into the town of Mo^taubon.
They had ryden all night in great have to come to that battle / for they had
knowledge how the frenchmen had besieged their companyons of Montaubon. Than
they entered into the fray / so that the frenchmen were sore assailed / by
reason of ye coming of those new fressh people. This battle endured fro.ix.
of ye bell till it was past hye none / but finally the frenchmen were
discoufyted and put to the chase / for he was happy that could get a horse and
deperte out of that journey. There was takenen therle of Narbon / and sir Guy
Dayzay / therle Duses / the lord of Montmorelon / the seneshall of Carcasson /
the Seneshall of Beaucayre / and mo than a hundred knights of France / and of
Prouynce / and of the marches there about. and many a squier and rich man of
Tholous and of Mountpellyer. And there had been mo taken if they had been chased /
howbeit the companyous were but a few and yuell horsed / therefore they durst
not adventure ouerfarr / and so held the^ content with that they had done. This
skyz mysshe was at Mo^taubon the vigyll of our lady in August. the year of our
lord god / a thousand three hundred threscore and six.

How these companyons let their prisoners depart on their faithes / but the
pope defended the^ to pay any rau^ some: and of the words that the king of
Mallorques had to the prince / and of the departing of the prince to go into
Spain. Cap. CC.xxxiii.
AFter the dysconfyture and taking of the said prisoners / the said Perducas
balbreth / sir Robert Cem / ser Rohan Comes / the Bourge of Bertuell / Nandon
of Bergerant and their company parted their boty and all their wynning / where
of they had great plenty. And all such as had any prisoners kept them still to
their own profit other to ransom or to quyt them at their pleasure. And
they raunsomed their prisoners right curtesly every man after his degree. The
more courtesly because this adventure came to themso fortunatly by valyantnesse
of deeds of arms. and sucheas were let go on their faith and promise had
days lymitted to the^ to bring their raunsoms to Burdeur / or to other places
where as they were appointed. So the prisoners deperted and went home in to
their own countrees / and these companyons went to the prince / who received
them right ioyously / and sent them to loge and to abide in the marchesse of
Basell among the mountayns.

I shall show you what befell of this matter / and of the earl of Narbon / the
seneshall of Tholous and other / who were put to rau^some / and had promised on
their faythes to pay it. In the same season there / was at Rome pope Urban ye
fyfte / who entierly hated these manner of people of companyous and had long
time before cursed them / because of ye vilayne deeds that they had done: so
that whan^e he was enfourmed of this said journey. And how yt therle of
Narbone and other were overthrown he was sore displeased therewith / and
suffered till he herd how they were put to their ransom / and come home into
their own countrees / and out of their enemies hands. Than he sent to each of
them and by express words defended them in any wise to pay any ransom /
and assoyled them of their promise. Thus these lords and knights were quyted
of their rau^some / such as had been taken at Mountaubon / for they durst not
trepase the popes commandment / the which happed well for these lords /
knights / and squyers: but it fortuned yuell for the companyons / who abode
and looked ever for their money / trusting to have had it to arrayed and
aparelled the^ like men of war. And so they made great prepara^yon on trust
thereof / whereof they were disceyued. So this ordinance of the pope was right
coutagyous to them and they complained often times thereof to sir Johan Chandos
/ who was constable of Acquitayne: and had the over sight by right of arms in
such matters. Howbeit he dissymuled with the^ as well as he might because he
knew well the pope had cursed the^ / and how yt all their deeds turned to
pyllyng and robbery. And as far as ever I could here they had never other
remedy in that matter.

Now let us speak of the prince of Wales and aproche to his viage / and show
how be perseuered. First as it has benshewed here before / he did so much
that he had all the companyons of his acorde / who were to ye nombre of. ^ii.
thousand fightyng men: and greatly it was to his cost to retain them. And
after he had them / he sustained and bare their charges or they deperted out of
the principalyte / fro the be (...)nyng of August to the beginyng of February
and beside y^ the prince received and retained all manner of men of war where
soever he could get them. And also the foresaid king Henry retained men of war
in every part out of the ^ealme of France and other places / and they came to
serve him / because of the alyaunces y^ were between the french king and him.
And also he had with him retained some of the companyons bretons / such as
were favorable to sir Bertram of Clesquy: as sir Bertramme of Budes / Alayne
of saint Poule / Wyllyam of Bruex / and Alayne of Connet: all these were
capitayns of those companyons. And the prince might have had also with him many
stra^gersmen of war / as flemynges / almayns / and brabances: of he had list.
But he sent home again many of the^ / for he had rather have had of his own
subgettes of the principalyte than strangers. Also there came to him a great
aid out of England / for when the king of England his father knew that this
viage went forward than he gave lycens to one of his sons / duke Johan of
Lancastre to go to the prince of Wales his brother / with a great nombre of men
of war: as four hundred men of arms / and four hundred archers. And when the
prince knew of his brothers coming / he was thereof right ioyouse. In the same
season came to the prince to Burdeaur James king of Mallorques / so he called
himself / but he had in possessyon nothing of the realm. For the king of
Aragon kept it fro him byforce / and had stayne in prisone the king of
Mallorques in a city called Barselone. Therefore this young king James to
revenge the death of his father / and to recover his heritage was fled out of
his own realm to the prince: and he had married y^ queen of Naples. The prince
made him great there and greatly conforted him / and when the king had showed
the prince all the reasons and occasyons of his coming / and parceyued y^
wrong that the king of Aragon had done to him / as in keeping fro him his
enherytaunce: and also slain his father. Than the prince said ser king I
promise you faithfully / that after my return out of Spaygne I shall entende to
set you again into your heritage / outher by treaty or by force. This
promise pleased greatly y^ king and so he tarried still with the prince in
Bordeaux / abydinge his departing as other did. And the prince to do him more
honor / caused to de delivered to him all that was for him necessary / because
he was a stranger and of a far country: and had not there of his own after his
appetyte. And daily there came great co^playntes to the prince of the companyons
/ how they did much hurt to men and women of the country where they lay / so
that the people of that marchesse would gladly that ye prince should auau^ce
forth in his viage / to ye which the prince was right desirous. How be it he
was counsayled that he should sustre the feast of Christmas first to pass / to
thentent that they might have winter at their backs. To the which counsel
y^ prince inclyned / and so^ what because ye princes his wife was great with
child / who took much thought for his departing. wherefore ye prince would
gladly seher delivered or he departed and she on her part was gladder to have
him a bide. All this mean season there was great prouysion made for this viage /
because they should enter into a realm where they should find but small
prouisyon. and while they thus so^orned at Burdeaur / and that all the country
was full of men of war: The prince kept often times great counsel / and
among other things as I was informed / the lord Dalbreth was cou^termaunded
with his thousand spears / and a letter was scut to him fro the prince /
conteynyng thus. Sir Dalbreth sithe it is so that we have taken on us by our
volu^tary will this vyage / the which we entend shortly to proceed.
Consydring our great business / charges and diseases that we have / as well by
strangers such as entered into our service as by great nombre of the
companyons / the which nombre is so great that we will not leave them behind
us for parels yt may ensue: and also to se how the land may be kept in mine
absence / for all may not go / nor yet all abide behind. Therefore it is
ordained by us and by our counsel / that in this viage ye shall serve us but
with. it. hundred spears / and discharge you of the resydue and let them do
what them list. And thus god keep you / fro Burdeux the.vii. day of Decembre.
These letters sealed with the princes gretseale were sent to the lord Dalbreth
/ who was in his own country right besy to prepare him toward this viage /
for it was said that y^ prince should depart shortly. When he saw the
princes letters he opened the^ and reed them two times over / the better to
understand the^ / for he had great marueyle of that he had found written in
the^: and was in his mind marueylusly displeased (and said) How is it that
mylorde the prince iapeth and mocketh thus with me / sithe he would that I
should give leave to depart.viii. hundred spears knights and squiers / whom
by his commandment I have retained / and have let them of their profit
diverse other ways. And incontinent in that displeasur he called for his clerk
/ and caused him to write a letter to y^ prince in this manner. Dear sir I am
greatly marueyled of the letters ye have sent me / and sir I can not well find
nor take counsel how I oughtor can answer you in that behalf / for it
tourneth to my great preiudyce and blame and to all my company / whom I have by
your own ordinance and commandment retained. And they are all ready
aparelled to do you service. And I have let them of taking their profit in
other places / where as they might have had it. For some of them were
determined to have gone over thesee into Spruce / to Co^stantyne / and to
Jerusalem / as all knights and squyers does to auaunce them self. Sir they
have great marueyle and are sore displeased that they should thus be put out.
and in likewise I have great marueyle thereof / and (...) what manner I have
deserved it. Dear sir please it you to know / I can not assure you of any of
them divided fro their company / I am the lest and worst of them all / if any
depart I am in surety they will alldepte. God keep you in his sauegarde.
Written. etc. When the prince herd this answer he took it of great
presumpcyon / and so did diverse knights of England that were there of his
counsel. Than the prince shoke his heed and said in english / as I was
enfourmed / for I was than in Burdeux. Asayd the prince / the lord Dalbreth is
a great master in my country: when he will break the ordyuaunce that is
devised by my counsel. By god it shall not go as he weneth let him a bide
and he will / for without his thousand speres I trust to god I shall furnysshe
my viage. Than certain knights of England yt were there said / sir ye know
full little the minds of these gascoyns / nor how proud they be / nor they
love us but little / nor never did. Sir remember ye not how highly and
greatly they bare themself against you in ye cite of Burdeux when that king
Johan of France was first brought thither. They said than / and maynteyned
plainly / that by them all only ye atteyned to achyue that viage in taking of
ye king. and that right well apered / for ye were in great treaty with them the
space of four months or they would consent that the french king should be
carried into England. First it behooved you to satisfy their minds to keep them
in love. And at those words the prince held his peace / howbeit his thought
was nevertheless. This was the first occasyon of the hatered that was after
between the prince and the lord Dalbreth. Thus the lord Dalbreth was in great
parell / for the prince was high and of great courage / and cruel in his
heart: for he would other by right or wrong / that every lord under his
commandment should hold of him. But therle of Armynake uncle to the said
lord Dalbreth / when he herd of this displeasure / between the prince and the
lord Dalbreth his nephue. Than he came to Burdeux to the prince / and sir
Johan Chandos and sir Thomas Phelton with him / by whose counsel the prince
was much ordered. And so by their good means / the princes displeasure was
apeased: so y^ the lord Dalbreth should bring no mo but two hundred spears /
with the which he was nothing ioyouse / nor yet his people / nor never after
he loved so entierly the prince as he did before. Howbeit there was no remedy
but to bear and pass over his trouble as well as he might.

UHus while the prince was making of his prouysion / and abiding the coming
of his brother the duke of Lancastre. The princess trancysed / and through the
grace of god she was delivered of a fair son on the day of the three kings
of Colayne / the which was as that year went on a wedinsday: at the hour of
three or there about. Where of y^ prince and all his people were right ioyouse /
and the friday after he was christened at noone / in the chur the of saint
Andrewe in the cite of Bordeaux / The archbysshoppe of the same place christened
him / and the bishop of Dagen in Dagenoys has the king of Mallorques were his
godfathers: and this child had to name Richard / who was afterward king of
England / as ye shall here in this history.

THe sunday after the hour of prime deperted fro Burdeux the prince / with
great ^^yumphe and all other men of war. Howbeit the most part of his host
were passed on be (...) / and lay about the cite of Ast in Gascoyn. And the
prince the same sunday at night / came ^o the same city and there tarried a three
days: for than it was showed him that the duke of La^(...) his brother was
coming / and had passed the sea a five days before / and was arrived in
Bretayne at saint Mathewes of Fine (...): and so was come to Nauntes where the
duke of Bretayne greatly feested him. Than the duke of Lancastre passed through
Poiccou and ^aynton and came to Blay / and there passed the river of Gyronde and
so came to Burdeux / and went to the abbey of saint Andrewe where the princess
lay / who ioyously received him: and so did all other ladies and damozeks that
were there. Than the duke thought to ^ary there no longer / but took his leave
of his sustre the princess and departed withal his company / and rode so long
that he came to the cite of Dast where he found the prince his brother. They
made great joy each of other for they loved together entierly: there was great
tokens of love showed between them and their company. And anon after the duke
of La^castres coming thither came the earl of Foyz and made great re^erence and
chere to the prince and to his brother and offered him self in all points to
be at their commandment. The prince who could well honor all lords
acordyng to their estates / honored him greatly and thanked him of his coming
thither: and after the prince gave him y^ charge of his country in his absence /
desyringe him to keep it well till his return. Therle joyfully acorded to his
desire: and than took leave and deperted home into his country / and the prince
and the duke of Lancastre his brother sported them in the cite of Ast / and all
their people spredde abroad in the country about the enter of the passages of
Nauerr / for as than they were not in certain if they should pass that way
or not. yet the king of Nauerr had promised to open his passages / for words
ran through the host that newly he was agreed with the king Henry / whereof the
prince and his counsel had great marueyle / and the king Dampeter was right
sore displeased. And in this mean season while these words thus ran / sir
Hugh Caurell and his people aproched to Nauer and took the cite of Myrande and
the town of y^ queen's bridge: whereof all the country was sore a frayed / the
which tidings came to the king of Nauerr. And when he parceyued that these
companyons would enter into his land byforce he was sore displeased and wrote
word thereof to the prince / and the prince let the matter pass brefely:
because y^ king of Nauer as he thought kept not true promise with king
Dampeter. Than the prince wrote to him that he should excuse him self of the
words that was laid on him / for it was there openly said that he was clean
turned to king Henry. And when y^ king of Nauer understood (y^ trayson was
laid on him) than he was more angry than he was before. Than he sent a knight
to the prince called ser Marten Kar / he came to the cite of Ast to excuse the
king of Nauer: and he demeaned him self so wisely that the prince was apeased
of his displeasure: so that y^ same knight should return into Nauer to the
king his master / causyng him to come to saint John^s de pie du port / and the
prince to take counsel if he should go and speak with him / or else to
sendsuffyci cut messangers to him. Thus this sir Marten Karr departed fro the
prince and returned into Nauar to the king / and showed him how he had
spedde / and in what condicyon he had found the prince and his counsel: and
also on what co^dycion he was departed fro the^. This knight did somoche that
he brought the king of Nauar to saint John^s / and than he went to the cite of
Ast to the prince. And when y^ prince knew that the king of Nauar was at
saint Johans de pie du port: than he determined to send to him the duke of
Lancastre his brother and sir Johan Chandos / and so these two lords with a
small company rode to the town of saint John^s with this said knight. And
there the king of Nauar received the^ right ioyoully and there had long
counsel together / finally it was acorded that the king of Nauer should
aproche nerer to the prince / to a certain place called Pyerferade / and
thither the prince and king Dampeter should come to speak with him and there to
renew all their couenauntes. And there each of them to know what they should
have. all that the king of Nauer did before was to thentent to be the better
assured of their promyses than he thought him self he was / for he douted that
if the co^panyons were entered into his country: and this treaty and acorde
between them not sealed. Than he feared he should not have that he desired when
he would.

ON this treaty returned the duke of Lancaster and sir John^ Chandos and
recou^ted to the prince / and to king Dampeter how they had spedde / the
which pleased them right well and so kept their day / and came to the place
assigned: and also the king of Nauar and y^ most special of his counsel.
And there were these three lords / the king Dampeter / the prince of Wales / and
the duke of Lancastre on the one party / and the king of Nauer on the other
party long comunyng toguyder. And there it was devised and acorded what every
man should have / and there was renewed the treaty among them. And there the king
of Nauer knew the certayntie what he should have of the realm of Castle: and
king Da^peter and he swear good love / peace / and confederacyon between them:
and deperted amyably a sondre. And than their host might pass whanit pleased
them / for the passages and straytes were opened / and vitels aparelled through
all the realm of Nauer for their money. Than the king of Nauer went to the
city of Panpylone: and the prince and his brother / and king Dampeter went to
the city of Ast. And as than there were diverse knights and lords of Poictou /
of Bretayne / and of Gascoyne not come to the princes host but tarried behind.
For as it has been said before / it was not fully known whyder the prince
should have passage or not / till the end of this treaty was concluded. And
specially in France it was supposed that he should not pass that way / but
rather that y^ king of Nauer should have broken his viage / the which fell
contrary. And when these knights and squiers knew the certayntie thereof / and
parceyued that the passages were opened. Than they auaunced them self as fast
as they might / for they knew well y^ the prince would pass shortly and not
return again without battle. Thither came the lord Clysson with a fair
company of men of arms: and at last ca^e with an yuell will the lord Dalbreth
with two hundred spears / and all that vyage he kept company with the Captall
of Beufz / and all this matter and confederacions / knowledge thereof was had in
France / for always there were messangers coming and going / reportyng always
that they knew or herd. And wha^ sir Bertram of Clesquy who was with y^ duke
of Aniou knew how yt the prince was passed and how the passages of Nauer
were opened to the^. Than he enforsed his somons / and thought surely the matter
should not be ended without battle. Than he took his way toward Aragon to come
to king Henry as fast as he might / and all manner of people followed him such
as were commanded: and diverse other of the realm of France and other places
/ such as thought to auaunce them self to get honor.

Of the passage of the price / and how he passed and all his compauy. Cap.
CC.xxxiiii.
BItwene saint John^s de Pie du port and the city of Panpylone under y^
mou^tayns / there are straytes and perylous passages: for there is a hundred
places on the same passages / that a hundred men may keep a passage against all
y^ world. Also it was at the same season very cold / for it was about the
month of February when they passed / but or they passed they took wise
counsel how and by what means they should pass for it was showed them
plainly that they coudenat pass all atones. and therefore they ordained that
they should pass in three batayls three so^dry days: as y^ monday / tuesday /
and wednisday / the mo^day the vowarde. whereof was captain the duke of
Lancastre / and in his company the constable of Acquitayne sir Johan Chandos /
who had.xii. hundred penons of his arms / the field silver a sharp pyll
goules / and with him was the two marshals of Acquitayne: as ser Richard
Dangle and sir Stephyne Consenton / and with the^ was the penone of saint
George. There was also sir Wyllyam Beachaump son^e to the earl of Warwyke / sir
Hew Hastynges / and the lord Neuyll who served sir John^ Cha^dos with.xxx.
spears in that vyage at his own charge / because of the taking of the battle
of Aulroy. And also there was the lord Dalbreth sir Garses of the Castle / sir
Richard of Canton / sir Robert Cem / sir Robert Briques / Johan Treuelle /
Aymery of the Roche Chouart / Gayllart of the Moytre / Wylliam of Cleceton
Uylleboyes the Butteler and panter. All these were there with their penons /
under sir Johan Chandos rule. They were to the nombre of.x. thousand horses /
and all these passed the monday as is before said.

THe tuesday passed the prince of Wales and king Dampeter and also the king of
Nauer / who was come again to ye prince to bear him company / and to ensygne
him ye ready passage. And with the prince there was sir Loys of Harcourt / the
vycont of Chatelerat ye vycont of Roche choart / the lord of Parteney / the
lord of Pynau / the lord of Ta^neyboton and all the poictenyns. Sir Thom^s
Phelton great leneshall of Acquitayne / sir Wyllyam his brother / sir Eustace
Dambretycourt / the seneshall of Xaynton / the seneshall of Rochell / the
seneshall of Quercy / the seneshall of Lymosyn / the seneshall of Agenoyse /
the seneshall of Bygor / sir Richard of Pontchardon / sir Nowell Lornyche /
sir Dangoses / sir Thomas Balyster / sir Lowes of Mernall / sir Edmonde of
Marnell / the lord Peter of Suffyer: and to the no^bre of four thousand men
of arms / and they were a ten thousand horses. The same tuesday they had yuell
passage because of wind and snow / howbeit they passed forth and lodged in
the county of Panpylone. And the king of Nauer brought the prince and the
king Da^peter into the city of Pa^pylone to supper / and made them great
chere.

THe wednisday passed the king James of Mallorques / and the earl of Armynake /
therle Dalbreth his nephue / sir Bernard Dalbreth lord of Gyronde / therle of
Pyergort the Uycont of Carman / therle of Gomygues / the Captall of Beufz / the
lord of Clysson / the three brethren of Pomyars / sir Johan / sir Hely / and
sir Edmonde / the lord of Chamont / the lord of Musedent / sir Robert Canoll
/ the lord Lespare / the lord of Condon / the lord of Rosen / sir Petyte of
Courbon / sir Aymery of Tarse / the lord de la Barde / sir Bertram of Caude /
the lord of Pyncornet / sir Thomas of Wystusuble / sir Perducas Dalbreth / ye
bourge of Beriuell / Nandon of Bergerant / Bernarde de la Salle / Hortygo Launt
/ and all the other of the companyons: and they were a ten thousand horse /
they had more easy passage than^e those that passed the day before. And so all
the hole host lodged in the county of Panpylone abiding each other /
refresshynge them and their horses. They lay still thus about Panpylone the
space of three days / because they found the country plentyfull: both in
flesh / breed / wine / and all other purueyau^ces / for them and for their
horses. Howbeit these companyons paid not for every thing as was demanded of
the^ nor they could not absteyne fro robbynge and pyllyng that they could get.
So that about Panpylone and in the way they did much trouble and hurt /
wherewith the king of Nauerr was right sore displeased / but he could not as
than amend it: but he repented him often times that he had opened his passages
to ye prince and to his company. For he parceyued well how he had thereby
more hurt than profit / howbeit the season was not than for him to say all
that he thought / for he saw well and considered that he was not as than^e
master of his own country. So he had daily great co^playn tes made to him of
one and other of his country / wherewith his heart was sore constrained for
displeasure: but he could not remedy it. Howbeit he caused some of his
counsel / such as knew well these companyons: and had been in their company
in France / in Normandy / and in diverse other places / to desire the^ to
absteyn them self fro robbyng and pillynge the country as they did / to whom
they promised so to do.

Of the great somons that king Henry made / and how he sent to the price to
somon him to fight and how sir Olyuer of Manny took the king of Nauer
prisoner. Cap. CC.xxxv.
KIng Henry of Spayn was well informed of ye princes passage / for he had his
messangers and spies daily coming and going / therefore he provided for men of
arms and commons of ye realm of Castle / to the intent to resyst the prince
and his brother Dampeter. And daily he tarried for the coming of sir Bertra^
of Clesquy with great socours out of France. And he had sent a special
commandment through out all his realm / to all his subgettes on pain of
their lives / goods / and lands: that every man acordynge to his estate
outher a foot or a horse back to come to him to aid and defend his realm And
this king Henry was well-beloved / and also all they of Castle had before much
pain and trouble to aid to make him king: therefore they obeyed to him ye
rather. And so daily they resorted to him to saint Domynyke / to the no^bre of
threscore thousand men a sote and a horse back all ready to do his
commandment and pleasure / and to live and dye with him if need require. And
when this king Henry herd certain word how the prince withal his host
was in the realm of Nauer / and had passed ye straytes of Rousenaulx. Than^e
he knew well there was no remedy but to fight with the prince / of the which
he made semblant to be right ioyouse: and said openly on high. A the prince of
Wales is a valyant knight / and because he shall know that this is my right /
and that Jabyde and look to fight with him / I will write to him part of mine
intent. Than he sent for a clerk and he wrote a letter thus.

TO the right puyssanut and honorable lord prince of Wales and Acquitayne. It
is given us to knowledge that you and your people are passed the ports and are
drawing hyderwarde. And how that ye have made accord and alyaunce with our
enemy / and that your intent is to make war against us. We have thereof great
marueyle for we never forfeyted to you / nor would not do. Wherefore than ar ye
come with such a great army thus on us / to take fro us so little an heritage
as god has given us. ye have the grace and fortune in arms more than any
prince now lyueng / wherefore we think ye glorify yourselfe in your
puyssaunce. And because we knew the certaynte that ye seek to give us battle
/ we will that ye know that where so ever ye enter into Castle / ye shall
find us before you to keep and defend this our seignery. Written. etc. And
when this letter was sealed he called to him an haraulde / and said. Go thy way
as fast as thou may to the prince of wales / and bear him this lettre fro me.
So the haraude departed and took ye way through Nauer till he found the prince
/ than he kneled down and delivered him the letter fro king Henry. The prince
reed the letter a two times the better to understand it. and than he sent for
certain of his counsel and made the haraud to depart a little a side. Than
the prince reed the letter to his counsel / demanding them abuyce in that
matter / and in the mean season the prince said to his counsel. A I se well
this bastard is a stout knight and full of great prowes / and shows great
hardynesse this to write to us. Thus the prince and his counsel were long
together / howbeit finally they agreed not to write again by the haraud Tha^ it
was showed to him how he must abide a season / for ye prince at his pleasure
would write again by him and by none other / therefore he was commanded to tarry
till he had his answer. Thus the haraude tarried there still at his ease and
pleasure.

THe same day that the haraude brought these letters / sir Robert Phelton
auau^ced himself forth / and demanded of ye prince a gift / than ye prince
inquired of him what it was that he would desire. Sir quod he I require you to
give me license to depart out of your host and to ride on before: there be
diverse knights and squyers of my company / desyring to auaunce themself. And
sir I promise you we shall ride so forward / that we shall know the behauyng
of our enemies / and what way they draw and where they lodge. The prince
granted him with right a good will his requeast / whereof he thanked the
prince. And so departed out of the host as chief captain of that enter price
/ and in his company was sir Wyllm^ Felton his brother / sir Thomas Duforte /
sir Robert Canoll / sir Gayllarde Uiguyer / sir Rafe Hastynges / sir Dangouses
/ and diverse other knights and squyers. And they were a seuyn score / and three
hundred archers all well horsed and good men of arms. And also there was ser
Hew Stafforde / sir Richard Cauton / and sir Symo^ Burle / who ought not to be
forgote^. These men of arms rode through Nauer by such gydes as they had /
and came to the river of Mark the which is rude and deep / and so they passed
and loged in a vyllage called Nauaret. There they held them self / the better
to know and here where king Henry was. In the mean season while these
knights thus lodged at Nauaret / and the prince in the marchesse of Panpylone.
The same time the king of Naner was taken prisoner as he rode fro one town to
a another / by the french party by sir Olyuer of Manny / whereof the prince and
all his part had great marueyle. And some in the princis host supposed it was
done by a (...)ll by his own means / because he would co^uey the prince no
further / nor go in his company because he knew not how ye matter should go
between king Henry and king Dampeter / how be it the queen his wife was
thereof sore dismayed and disconforted / and came and kneled on her knees before
the prince / and ^ayd. Dear sir for goddessake have mercy and ^n^^d on the
delyuerau^ce of the king my husba^^^ / who is taken fraudele^tly / and as yet
can not be ^^owen how. Therefore ^ir we desire you for ye love of god that we
may have him again. Tha^ the prince answered certainly ^ayre lady and co^^^ his
taking to us is right displesant: and we trust to provide remedy for him
shortly. wherefore we desire you to confort your self / for this our ^^age
ones achyued we shall entende to no ^^ther thing / but for his delyuerau^ce.
Than ye queen of Nauer returned: and there was a no^le knight sir Marten ^ar /
who undertook to guide the prince through the realm of Nauer and did get him
gydes for his people / for otherwise they could not have kept the right way /
through the straytes and perylous passage. so thus the prince deperted fro
thens there as he was loged / and he and his company passed through a place
named Sarris / the which was right perylous to pass for it was narowe and an
yu^li way. There were many sore troubled for lack of vitayle: for they found
but little in that passage till they came to Saueter.

SAueter is a good town / and is in a good country and a plentyfull / as to the
marches there about. This town is at the utter bands of Nauer / and on the
entering into Spain. This town held with king Henry. So than the princis
host spread abroad that country * and the companyons auaunced themselse to
assail the town of Saueter / and to take it byforce / and to rob and pyll
it. Where unto they had great o^syre* by cause of the great riches yt they knew
was within the town / the which they of y^ cou^^re had brought th(...)der /
on trust of the strength of the town / but they of the town thought not ^o
abide y^ parell / for they knew well they cou^e not long endure / nor resyst
against so great an host. Therefore they came out and rendered them self to
king Dampeter and cried him mercy / and presented to him the keys of ye town.
The king Dampeter by counsel of the (...)ce took the^ to mercy / or else he
would not have done i^ / for by his will he would have distroyed them all how
beit they were all received to (...). And the prince king Dampeter / and the
king of Mallorques / with the duke of Lancaster entered in to the town: and
therle of Armynake and all other lodged therabout in vyllages. Now let us
leave the prince there / and somewhat speak of his men that were at the town of
Nauaret.

THe foresaid knights yt were there greatly desired to auaunce their bodies /
for they were a five days ^ourney fro their own host / where as they departed
fro the^ first. And often times they issued out of Nauaret and rode to y^
marchesse of their enemies / to learn what their enemies entented. And this
king Henry was lodged in the field and all his host / desyryng greatly to here
^idynges of ye prince / marueylyng greatly that his haraud returned not. And
often times his men rodenere to Nauaret / to learn and to here some tidings of
thenglysshmen / and the earl ^ancell brother to the king Dame Henry was
certainly enfourmed that there were men of war in garryson in the town of
Nauaret / wherefore he thought to go and se them more nerer. But first on a day
the knights of England rode out of Nauaretet in an e^en^ynge / so farforthe
that they came to king He^ryes lodging and made there a great (...)mysshe and
marueylous^y awoke the host / and slew and took diverse: and specially the
knight that kept the wache was taken without recovery / and so returned again
to Nauar^et without any damage. And ye next day they sent to the prince a^
haraude who was as than at Saueter / signifyeng him what they had done and
seen / and what puyssaunce his enemies were of / and where they were lodged.
For they knew all this well by the informacyon of such prisoners as they had
taken. Of these tidings ye prince was right ioyouse / in that his knights had
so well borne them self on ye fronter of his enemies. ^yng H^ty who was right
sore displeased / that the^glysshmen yt lay at Nauaret had thus escryed his
host / said howehe would aproche nerer to his enemies: and so auau^ced
forward. And when sir Thomas Phelto^ and his company at Naueret knew that
king Henry was passed the water / and drew for ward to find the prince.
Than they determined to depart fro Nauaret and to take the feldes / to know
more certayntie of the spanyardes and so they did / and sent word to the
prince how that king Henry aproched fast / and be semyng desyring greatly to
find him and his men. And the prince who was as than at Saueter / where he
understood y^ king Henry was passed the water / and took his way to come to
fight with him he was right ioyouse / and said a high y^ every man herd him.
By my ^aythe this bastard Henry is a valyant knight and a ^ardy / for it is
sign of great prome^ that he ^eketh thus for us: and sithe he does so / and
we (...) likewise him by all reason we ought to mete and fight together.
Therefore it were good that we departed fro hens and go forward / and to get
Uyctoria or our enemies come there. (...) so the next morning they departed
^ro S^^^ter. First the prince and all his ^atayle / and he did so much that
he came before (...) / and there he found sir Thomas Phelton and y^ for said
knights to whom he made great chere / and demanded them of diverse things.
And as they were deuysing together / their currours came and reported yt they
had s^ue the currors of their enemies / wherefore they knew for certain that
king Henry and his ho^^^ was not far of by reason of the demeany age / that
they had seen among the spanyardes. When y^ prince understood these ti^ynges /
he causes his tru^pettes to sown / and cried alarm through out all the host.
And when every man herd that / than they drew to their order and array / and
ranged them in batayleredy to fight / for every man knew or he departed fro
Sauete^r what he should do and what order to take / the which they did
incontinent. There might have been seen great nobleness / and baners and penons
beaten with arms wa^y^g in y^ wind. What should I say more? it was great
nobleness to behold: the vawarde was so well ranged that it was marueyle to
behold. Whereof the duke of Lancastre was chief / and with him sir Johan
Chandos constable of Acquitayne with a great company / and in those batayls
there were made diverse new knights. The duke of Lacaltre in the vaward made
new knights / as sir Rafe Camoys / sir Water Lomyche / sir Thom^s Damery /
sir John^ Grandon and other to the nombre of.xii. And sir John^ Cha^dos made
diverse english squyers knights: as Corton Clysson prior* Wyllm^ of F^rmeton
/ Amery of Roch ch^art / Gyrad de la Motte / and Robert Briquet. The prince
made first knight Dampeter king of Spain / sir Thomas Holand son to his wife
the princess / sir Hugh / sir Philyppe / and sir Denyse Courtnay / sir John^
^onnet / ser Nicholas Bond / and diverse other. And in likewise so did diverse
other lords in their batels / there were made that day. CCC. new knight* or
(...). and all that day they were ^^yll ready (...)ged in the batell to abide
for their enemies / but they came no fa^^er forward that day / but there as the
currours had seen them. For king Henry tarried for socours that should come to
him out of Aragon / and specially for sir Bertram of Clesquy / who was comig to
hi with a.iiii. M. fightyng men / for without the^ he thought he would not
fight / whereof the prince was right ioyouse for his areregard wherein were. vi.
M. me^ was behynd him a.vii. leages of y^ country / whereof the prince was sore
displeased in his heart yt they tarried so long. How bent if his enemies had
come on forward the same day / he was sully ^e termyned to have received and
sought (...)*

ANd in the same ever(...)g (...) ^^o marsha^s sir Dangle and sir Steuyn
Gossenton commanded every man to dra^e to their logy^ge / and in the next
morning to be ready at so ^^yng of the tru^pettes every man in ye same order as
they had been all that day. and so every man obeyed saving sir Thomas Ph^l^on
and such company as he had before. The same even ^yng they d^^ted fro the
prince and rode ^orwar^ a two leages nerer to their enemies / to know what
they did. And that euenyng therle of (...) ^^ll / brother to king Henry was
with him in his logyng / and talked together of diverse (...) of arms and
adue^tures: and at ^a^^ he said to his brother. Sir ye know well our (...) ar
loged not far fro us / and yet there is no^^ (...) has auewed the^. Sir I
require you give m^ leave that in the morning I may ride toward them with a
certain no^bre such as has great ^esyre so to do. And sir I promise you I
shall ^yde so nere them / that we will bring you certain knowledge what they
do. And this king Henry when he saw the desire of his brother (...) greed
thereto lightly. The same proper hour (...) Bertram of Clesquy came to their
host with a iii. M. fightyng men of France and of Aragon. whereof the king and
all his company were right ^oyouse / and honorably received him and his c^pany.
Therse of Anxell forgot not his purpose but desired such to go as pleased him
/ and would ^^adly have desired sir Bertram of Clesquy / and sir Arnold
Da^dr^hen / the Begue of U^llayns / and the vycont of Roche breten of Aragon
(...) because they were so lately come to the host he let the^ alone. and also
the king Henry charged him in no wise to speak thereof. So therle A^sell let it
pass / and took with him other of France and of Aragon / so that he was to the
nombr^ of ^ire thousand horses well appayrelled / and with him his brother
Xanses in his co^pa^^

How certain of the company of the duke of La^castres were disconfyted / and
of the counsel that king Henry would not believe. And of the letters that the
prince wrote to king Henry / and of the counsel that sir Bertram of Clesquy
gave to the answer of the same letters. Cap. C C.xxxvi.
ANd when it was day in ye next morning they mounted on their horses / and
deperted fro the kings host in good array and rode to war de the^glysshe
logynges / and about the son rysynge in a valley they met with part of sir
Hugh Caurelles company with his harness / for he had lodged that night a leage
fro the english host. And as soon as the frenchmen and spanyardes saw them
they ran at them / and shortly disco^tyted them / so that the most part were
slain and the harness won. But sir Hugh him self who came so^ what behind /
when he saw that he took another way. Howbeit he was parceyned and chased / so
that he was feign to fly with his company in to the duke of Lancastres host And
the spanyardes who were a six thousand rode at the same brunt by one of the
corners of the vawarde of the duke of Lancastres host. and cried Castle / and
beat down logynges and ^^ewe and hurt much people. Tha^ the host began to
styre and to arm them / and drew to ye dukes lodgyng who was ready armed and
his baner before him. And the englysshmen and gascoyns drue them under their
baners and penons ready to fight. Than the duke went up to a little mountain /
and to him came sir John^ Chandos and the two marshals / and diverse other
knights and squiers / puttyng themself in order and array beside the duke.
And anon after came the prince and king Dampeter / and ever as they ca^e they
set the^ self in order of battle. Therle of Anxell and his brother had
thought to have had the same mountain first to auau^tage: but as I herd say
they failed of their purpose / but when they saw they could not have it / and
that thenglysshe host was ready apparelled. Than they departed and assembled
their company together / and so rode forth trustyng to find some other good
adventure / but or they departed they did diverse feats of arms / for certain
english knights and gascoyns departed fro their array / and struck in among
the spanyardes and bare diverse to the earth / but always ye great batell stood
still on the mountain lokyng ever when they should have be fought with all. So
thus in the returning of the spanyardes and aprochynge their own host they
encou^tred sir Thomas Phelton and his brother / sir Richard Tancon. sir
Da^goses / sir Hugh Hastynges / sir Gaylerd Uigor and other to the no^bre of. C
C. knighttes and squiers englyssh and gascons / and in a valey they met: and
the spanyardes cried Castle in ye name of king Henry. Than the^glysshe company
seeing that great company of spanyardes and how they could not escape fro the^:
they conforted them self as well as they might and kept the^ together in the
field / and took the aduau^tage of a little hill. Than the spanyardes came and
rested themself before the^ / ymaginynge by what means they might best fight
with the^. Than sir Wyllm^ Phelton did a great feat of arms and great outrage
/ for he disce^ded down the hill with his spear in the rest proving his
courser and ran in among the spanyardes: and struck a knight so rudely with his
spear that ye spear ran clean through his body / and the knight fell down
deed. Than this sir Wyllm^ was enclosed round about with his enemies / and
there he fought as valiantly as any knight might do and did his enemies great
damage or he was stricken to ye earth: his brother sir Thom^s Felton and the
other knights that were with him on the mountain saw how he fought and did
marueyls in arms / and saw well what parell he was in / but they could not
comfort him without lesyng of themself. So they stood still in their array on
the mountain. And the said knight fought still as long as he could endure /
but finally there was slain. Than the spanyardes and frenchmen ymagined how
they might invade the^glysshmen on the mountain. So that day there were diverse
feats of arms done and a chyued / for sometime part of the^ would discende
down ye mountain and fight with their enemies and recule wisely back again
to it. Thus in this estate they were till it was hye noon / the prince would
gladly have comforted the^ if he had known thereof and delivered them out of y^
parell but he was not ware thereof / therefore it behooved them to abide their
aduentur. When they had thus endured scrymiss hyng a great season: tha^ therle
of Anxell / who was sore displeased y^ they endured so long / said a hye to his
company. Lords for shame what do we here thus all day we ought or this time to
have devoured them. Auaunce forward and let us fight with them with a fierce
will / there is nothing will be got without it be derely bought: with tho
words the frenchmen and spanyardes auaunced them forth with a hardy courage /
and came to them so close together that they could not be broken. So than on
the mountain was done many a feat of arms. And the^glysshmen and gascons
defended themself to their powers right valyantly / but after the spanyardes
were entered in among the^ they could not endure / finally they were all taken
and conquered byforce of arms. So that non escaped but a certain varlettes
and pages that saved themself by their horses and at night they came to the
princes host / who that day was ready ranged on the hill to sight.

AFter the taking of these said knights and squyers / the earl of Auxell and
Sa^xes his brother and their company returned to the host right ioyouse: and
at night came to the king Henry their brother. And there they made a present
to the king of such prisoners as they had taken / and recounted to the king
sir Bertram of Clesquy / and sir Arnolde Dan drchen and other how they met /
and how they did. And also how they had overthrown perte of sir Hugh Caurels
company / and chased him into the duke of Lancastres host / and there did great
damage or the host were assembled / and how that in their retournyng they
met with these knights whom they had taken. King Henry who hard well these
words with great joy and glory answered therle his brother / and said. Fair
brother ye have marueylusly well spedde / whereof ye shall be greatly rewarded: and
I trust surely y^ all the other shall pass ye same way Than sir Arnolde
Da^drehen said: sir saving your grace I will not say against you / but rather
amend it: but one thing sir I say yt when soever ye shall assemble with ye
prince in batell / ye shall find the men of war such as to deeds of arms
requires / for there is the flower of all the chiualry of the world. There
shall ye find sage and hardy coragious fightyng men / for to dye in the place
they will not fly one foot Sir it is necessary that ye take good head and
counsel in this matter. But sir and ye will do by my counsel ye shall
disconfyte them without any stroke strikyng. As thus / if ye will keep ye
straites and passages / so that no prouisyon may come at them / ye shall
famysshe them and so disco^fite them. For than they shall be feign to return in
to their own country ward / without good order or array / and tha^ may you
have yor desire acomplysshed. Than this king Henry answered and said: marshall
by the soul of my dear father I desire so much to se the prince and to prove
his puyssau^ce and mine / that I will never depart hens without battle. For I
thank god we have men ynowe. First we have seuyn thousand men of arms well
horsed and barded / so that they fear no shote of archers. And also we
have.xx. thousand of other mounted on genettes cap a pee / and of other we
have threscore thousand men of commons / with spears / darts / and pauesses /
the which may do a great feate. And they all have sworn not to fail me to dye
in the pain / wherefore sir Arnolde Ise no cause to be abashed / but let us
greatly be re conforted in the puyssaunce of god and in our me^. And so with
this talkyng there were knights that brought to the king wine and spyces. So
the king took thereof and gave the lords part about him / and than every man
returned into their logynges. Than the^glysshmen and gascoyns prisoners made
their assurau^ce / and were divided one fro another. No we let us return to
the prince and speak some what of his ordinance.

The prince of Wales and the duke of Lancaster were all the said day on the
mou^tayn / and at night they were enfourmed of their men that were thus taken
and slain / wherewith they were sore displeased / but they could not amend
it. Than they drue to their logynge: and the next morning the prince took
counsel and determined to depert fro thens and so he did / and went and loged
before Uictoria / and there stood in battle ready to fight / for it was
informed ye prince how that king Henry and his brother and their company were
not far thens / but they ca^e not forward. The prince and his company had
great lack of vitayls and prouisyon for the^ self and for their horses / for
they were loged but in an yuell country and a hard. And king Henry and his
company lay in a good fruitful country / in the princes host a lofe of breed
was sold for a floreyn / every man glad so to give and more and they could
have got it. Also the time was foul and troublous: of wind / rain / and
snow. and in this danger and disease they were six days. And when the
prince saw that the spanyardes came not forward to fight / and that they were
there in great distress. Than they determined to go and seek for passage at
some other place / than^e they disloged and took the way to Nauaret and passed
through a country called ye country of ye Guard / and when they were passed than
they came to a town called Uienne. There the prince and the duke of Lancastre
refresshed them: and therle of Armynacke and the other lords / a two days.
Than they went and passed the river that departs Castle and Nauer at the
bridge of Groynge / among the gardeyns under the olyues / and there they found
a better country than they were in before: how beit they had great defaute of
vitayle. And when that king Henry knew that the prince and his people were
passed the river at Groynge. Than he departed fro saint Muchaulte where he had
long layen / and went and lodged before Nauerette on the same river. When the
prince hard that king Henry was aproched / he was right ioyouse and said
openly: by saint George this bastard seems to be a valiant knight / sithe he
desires so sore to find us I trust we shall find each other shortly. Than^e
the prince called to him the duke of Lancastre his brother / and diverse other
of his counsel: and than he wrote an answer to king Henry of the letter that
he had sent him before / ye tenor whereof follows.

EDward by the grace of god prince of wales and Acquitayne: to the right
honorable and renomed Henry earl of Christemar / who at this present time
calls him self king of Castle. Sith it is so that ye have sent to us your
letters by your haraud / wherein were contained diverse artycles / making me^cyon
how ye would gladly know why we take to our friend and lover your enemy our
cosyn / the king Da^peter: and by what tytell we make you war / and are
entered with an army royal into Castle. We answer thereto. Know ye for
truth it is to sustain the right / and to maynteyn reason / as it
aparteyneth to all kings and princes so to do. And also to entertayne the
great alyau^ces / that the king of England my dear father / and king Dampeter
have had long together / and because ye are renomed a right valya^t knight we
would gladly and we could acorde you and him roguyder / and we shall do somoche
to our cesyn Dampeter / that ye shall have a great perte of the realm of
Castle / but as for the crown and heritage ye must renounce. Sir take
counsel in this case: and as for our enteryng into Castle we will enter there
as we think best at dure own pleasure. Written at Groynge the.xxx. day of
March.

When this letter was written it was closed and sealed / and delivered to the
same haraude that brought ye other / and had tarried for an answer more than
three wekes. Tha^he departed fro the presence of the prince / and rode so long
that he came to Naueret among the busshes / where king Henry was lodged and
drue to the kings logyng. And the most part of ye great lords of the host
came thither to here what tidings their heraude had brought. Than the haraud
kneled down and delivered the king the lettre fro the prince. The king took
and opened it / and called to him sir Bertram of Clesquy / and diverse other
knights of his counsel. There the letter was reed and well consydred: than
sir Bettram said to ye king. Sir know for truth ye shall have batell shortly
I know so well the prince / therefore sir look well on the matter. It is
necessary that ye take good head to all your business and order your people
and your batayls. Sir Bertra^ quod the king be it in the name of god / the
puyssaunce of the prince I dout nothing: for I have three thousand barded
horses / the which shall be two wings to our battle / and I have also seuyn.
M. genetours / and well.xx. thousand men of arms of the best that can be
found in all Castle / Galyce Portyngale / Cordowen / and Cyuyle / and.x.
thousand good crosbowes / and threscore. M. of other men a foot: with darts /
spears / lances / and other abilymentes for the war. And all these has
sworn not to fail me to dye in ye pain: therefore sir Bertram I trust to have
vyctory by the grace of god on whom is my trust and my right that I have in
the quarrel. Therefore lords I desire you all to be of good courage.

How the prince commanded his people to be ready to fight. and how king Henry
ordained his batayls / and how they fought fiersly together: and of the confort
that king Henry did to his people. Cap. CC.xxxvii.
THus as ye have hard king Henry and sir Bertra^ of Clesquy devised together of
diverse matters / and left talkyng of the princes letter for it was king He^ries
ente^cion to have battle / and so intended to order his field and people.
Therle of Anxell and his brother sir Sanxes / were greatly renomed in their
host / for the journey that they had made before / as ye have herd. The
prince the friday / the second day of Aprell^dil loged fro Groyng / and
auaunced forward araynged in battle ready to fight / for he knew well that
king Henry was not far thens. And so that day he auau^ced two leages / and at
three of the day he ca^e before Nauaret and there took his logyng. Than the
prince sent forth his currours to auiewe his enemies / and to know where they
were lodged: and than they departed fro the host and rode so forward that they
saw all their enemies host / who were also loged before Nauaret. So they
brought report thereof to the prince / and in the euenyng the prince caused
secretly to be showed through all the host / that at the first so wnyng of
the trumpettes every man to aparell himself / and at the second to be armed /
and at the third to lepe a horse back and to follow ye marshals baners / with
the penon of saint George. And that none on pain of death auaunce before them
/ without he be commanded so to do.

IN like manner as the prince had done the same friday insendyng out his
currours So did king Henry on his part to know where the prince was lodged /
and when he had true report thereof / than the king called ser Bertram of
Clesquy / and took counsel and aduyce how to persevere. Than they caused
their people to suppe / and after to go to rest to be ye more fressher / and at
the hour of mydnight to be ready apparelled and to draw to the field / and to
ordain their bataylles: for he knew well the next day he should have battle.
So that night the spanyardes took their ease and rest / for they had well
wherewith so to do / as plenty of vytels and other things. And the englysshmen
had great defaut / therefore they had great desire to fight / outher to win or
to lose all. After mydnight the trumpettes sounded in king He^ryes host than
every man made him ready: at the second blast they drew out of their lodgings
/ and ordered three batayls. The first had sir Bertram of Clesquy / lord Robert
of Rosebertyne and therle Dune earl of Aragon / and there were all the strangers
as well of France as of other countries / and there were two barons of Heynalt
the lord Dautoyng / and sir Alars lord of Brisuell. There was also the Begue of
Uillayns / the begue of Uylliers / sir John^ of Bergutes / sir Gawen of
Baylleull / the almayne of saint Uenant / who was there made knight and diverse
other / of France / Aragron / and Prouens / and of the marchesse there about.
There was well in that battle four thousand knights and squiers well armed
and dressed after the usage of France. The second battle had therle of
Auxell / and his brother therle of Saures: and in that battle with the
genetours there were.xv. thousand a foot and a horse back / and they drue them a
little a back on the lift hand of ye first battle. The third battle and the
grettest of all / governed king Henry himself: and in his company there were a
seuyn thousand horsemen and threscore thousand a foot with the crosbowes. So in
all three batayls he was a fourscore and six. M. a horseback and a foot. Tha^
king Henry lepte on a strong mule after ye usage of the country / and rode
fro battle to battle right swetely / prayeng every man that day to employ
themself to defend and keep their honor / and so he showed himself so
cherefully y^ every man was joyful to behold him. Than he went again to his
own battle / and by yt time it was day light. And than about ye son^erisyng /
he auaunced forth toward Nauaret to find his enemies in good order of
battle ready to fight.

THe prince of Wales at the brekyng of ye day was ready in ye field a ranged in
battle / and auau^ced forward in good order / for he knew well he should
encountre his enemies So there were none y^ went before ye marshals batayls /
but such currours as were appointed so thus the lords of both hosts knew by
the report of their currours yt they should shortly mete. So they went forward
an hostyng pase each toward other / and when the son was risyng up / it was a
great beauty to behold ye batayls and the armurs shinynge against the son. So
thus they went forward till they aproched nere together / than the prince and
his company went over a little hill / and in the disce^dyng thereof they
perceived clearly their enemies coming toward the^. And when they were all
disce^ded down this mountain than every man drue to their batayls and kept
the^ still and so rested the^ / and every man dressed and aparelled himself
ready to fight. Than sir John^ Cha^dos brought his baner rolled up together to
the prince and said. Sir behold here is my baner / I require you dysplay it
abroad / and give me leave this day to raise it / for sir I thank god and you
/ I have land and heritage suffycient to maynteyne it withal. Than the prince
and king Dampeter took the baner between their hands and spread it abroad /
ye which was of silver a sharp pyle goules / and delivered it to him and said
sir Johan behold here your baner / god send you joy and honor thereof. Than
sir Johan Chandos bare his baner to his own company / and said. Sirs behold
here my baner and yours keep it as your own. And they took it and were right
toyfull thereof / and said that by the pleasure of god and saint George they
would keep and defend it to the best of their powers. And so the baner abode
in the hands of a good english squire / called Wyllm^ Alery: who bare it
that day and aquaynted himself right nobly. Than anon after thenglysshmen and
gascoins a lighted of their horses / and every man drew under their own baner
and standerd in array of barayle ready to fight / it was great joy to se and
consider the baners and penons: and ye noble armery that was there. Than the
bataylles began a little to auaunce / and than the prince of Wales opened his
eyes and regarded toward heaven / and joined his hands together and said. Uary
god Jesu Christ who has formed and created me / consent by your benygne grace
that I may have this day victory of mine enemies / as that I do is in a
ryghtfull quarrel / to sustain and to aid this king chased out of his own
heritage the which gives me courage to auaunce my self to restablysshe him a
gain into his realm. And than he laid his right hand on king Dampeter / who
was by him and said. Sir king ye shall know this day if ever ye shall have
any part of the realm of Castle or not. Therefore auaunce baners in the name
of god and saint George / with those words the duke of Lancastre and sir Johan
Chandos aproched / and the duke said to sir Wylliam Beauchamp. Sir Wylliam
behold yonder our enemies / this day ye shall se me a good knight: or else to
dye in the quarrel. And therewith they aproched their enemies / and first the
duke of Lancastre and sir Johan Chandos battle assembled with the battle of
sir Bertram of Clesquy / and of ye marshall sir Arnold Dandrehen / who were a
four thousand men of arms. So at the first brunt there was a sore encountre
with spears and sheldes / and they were a certain space or any of them could
get within other. there was many a deed of arms done / and many a man reuersed
and cast to the earth / that never after was relyued. And when these two first
barayls were thus assembled / ye other batayls would not long tarry behind /
but aproched and assembled together quickly. And so the prince and his battle
/ came on the earl of Anxes battle: and with the prince was king Dampeter of
Castle and sir Marten dela Care / who represented the king of Nauer. And at
the first metynge that the prince met with the earl of Anxes battle: therle
and his brother fled away without order or good array and wist not why / and
a two thousand speres with him. So this second battle was opened and anon
disconfyted / for the captall of Beufz and the lord Clysson and their company
came on them a foot / and slew and hurt many of the^. Than the princes battle
with king Dampeter came and joined with the battle of king Henry / where as
there were threscore thousand men a foot and a horseback. There the battle
began to be fierce and cruel on all parts / for the spanyardes and
castillyans had slings where with they cast stones in such wise that there with
they claue and brake many a bassenet and helm / and hurt many a man and
ouerthrue them to the earth: and the archers of England shot fiersly and
hurtespanyardes grievously / and brought them to great mischefe The one part
cried Castle for king Henry / and the other part saint George guyen. And the
first battle / as the duke of Lancastre and sir Johan Chandos / and the two
marshals sir Guyss hard Dangle and sir Stephyne Consenton / fought with sir
Bertram of Clesquy and with the other knights of France and of Aragon: there
was done many a deed of arms. so it was hard for any of them to open others
battle / diverse of the^ held their spears in both their hands foyning and
presing each at other and some fought with short swerdes and daggers. Thus at
the beginnynge the frenchmen and they of Aragon fought valiantly: so that the
good knights of England endured much pain. That day sir Johan Chandos was
a good knight / and did under his baner many a noble feate of arms: he
adventured himself so far that he was closed in among his enemies / and so
sore ouerpressed that he was felled down to the earth: and on him there fell a
great and a bygge man of Castle called Martyne Ferrant / who was greatly
renomed of hardynesse among the spanyardes / and hedyde his intent to have
slain sir Johan Chandos / who lay under him in great danger. Than sir Johan
Chandos remembered of a knyfe that he had in his bosom / and drew it out and
struck this Martyne so in the back and in the sides / that he wounded him to
death as he lay on him Than sir Johan Chandos turned him over and rose
quickly on his fete and his men were there about him / who had with much
pain broken the prease to come to him where as they saw him felled.

THe saturday in the morning between Nauer and Nauaret was the battle right
fell and cruel / and many a man brought to great myschefe. There was done many
a noble deed of arms by ye prince / and by the duke of Lancaster his brother /
and by sir John^ Cha^dos / sir Guysshard Da^gle / the captall of Befz / the
lord of Clisson / the lord of Raix / sir Hugh Caurell / sir Mathue Gourney /
sir Loys Harcourt / the lord of Pons / the lord of Partney. And of gascoyns
fought valyantly: the earl of Armynake / the lord Dalbret / the lord of
Pomyers and his brethern / the lord of Musede^t / the lord of Rosen / therle
of Pyergourt / therle of Gomegynes / therle of Carmayne / the lord of Condons
/ the lord Parr / the lord of Chamont / sir Bertylmewe of Cande / the lord
of Pyncornet / sir Bertram Dalbreth / the lord of Garonde / sir Aymery of Taste
/ the Souldiche of Strade / sir Peteton of Corton / and diverse other knights
and squyers aquyted themself right nobly in arms to their powers. And under
the penon of saint George and the baner of sir Johan Chandos were all the
companyons to the nombre of.xii. hundred pensels / and they were right hardy
and valyant knights: as sir Robert Ceney / sir Perducas Dalbreth / Robr^t
Briquet / sir Garses of the Castle / sir Gaillard Uiger / Johan Cresnell /
Nandon of Bergera^t Aymon Dortyng / Perrot of Sauoy / ye bourg Camus / the
bourge Lespyne / the bourge Bertuell / Esperry and diverse other. On the french
party sir Bertram of Clesquy / sir Arnold Da^drehen / Xances / sir Gomes
Garybz / and other knights of France and of Arragone fought right nobly to
their powers / howbeit they had none advantage: for these companyons were
hardy and strong knights / and well used and expert in arms. And also there
were great plenty of knights and squiers of England under the baner of the
duke of Lancaster and of sir Johan Chandos. There was the lord Wyllyam
Beauchamp son to the earl of Warwyke / sir Rafe Camoys / sir Water Ursewyke /
sir Thomas Emery sir John^ Grandon / sir John^ Dyper / sir Johan du Pre / sir
Amery of Rochechoart / sir Gayllarde de la Motte and mo than.ii. hundred
knights / the which I can not name. And to speak truly the said sir Bertram
Clesquy / and the marshall Dandrechen / the Begue of Uillaynes / the lord
Dantuell / the lord of Brisuell / sir Gawen of Baylleull / sir Johan of
bergeretes / the begue of Uillers / ye almayne of saint Uenant / and the good
knights and squiers of France that were there / acquyted themself nobly. For
of truth if the spanyardes had done their part as well as the frenchmen did
/ thenglysshmen and gascoyns should have had much more to do: and have suffered
more pain than they did. The fault was not in king Henry that they did no
better: for he had well admonysshed and desired the^ to have done their deuoyre
valiantly / and so they had promised him to have done. The king bare him self
right valiantly and did marueyls in arms: and with good courage comforted his
people / as when they were flyenge and openyng / he came in among them and
said. Lords I am your king: ye have made me king of Castle and have sworn
and promised / that to dye ye will not fail me. For goddessake keep your
promise yt ye have sworn and acquyte you against me / and I shall acquyte me
against you: for I shall not fly one foot as long as I may se you do your
deuoyre. By these words and such other full of confort: king Henry brought
his men together again three times the same day / and with his own hands he
fought valiantly: so that he ought greatly to be honored and renowned. This
was a marvelous dangerous battle / and many a man slain and sore hurt: the
commons of Spain acordyng to ye usage of their country with their slings they
did cast stones with great vyolence and did much hurt / the which at the
beginnynge troubled greatly the englysshmen. But when their cast was past: and
that they felt the sharp arrows light among the^ / they could no lengar keep
their array. with king Henry in his battle / were many noble me^ of arms: as
well of Spain as of Lysbone of Aragon / and of Portyngale: who acquyted them
right nobly. And gave it not up so lightly for valiantly they fought / with
spears / iauelyns / archegayes / and swerdes. And on the wyng of king Henry's
battle there were certain well mounted / who always kept the batell in good
order / for if the bataile opened or brake array in any side / than they were
ever ready to help to bring them again in to good order. So these englisshmen
and gascons or they had the advantage they bought it derely / and wan it by
noble chiualry / and great prowes of arms. And for to say truth the prince
him self was the chief flour of chiualry of all the world and had with him as
than right noble and valyant k^^ghtes and squyers. And a little beside the
princes battle was the king of Mallorques and his company / fighting and
acquitynge them self right valiantly. And also there was the lord Martyn de
la karr representyng the king of Nauer / who did right well his de^oyre / I
can not speak of all them that did that day right nobly. But about the prince
in his ^^tayle there were diverse good knights / as well of England as of
Gascoyne: as sir Richard Pount Chardon sir Thomas Spenser / sir Thomas
Hollande sir Nowell Lornyche / sir Hugh and sir Philyppe Courtnay / sir Johan
Comette / sir Nycholas Bond / sir Thomas Comette and diverse other: as the
se^^shall of ^ayntonge / sir Baudwyn of Fran^yil / the seneshall of Bordeaux /
of Rochell / of Poictou / of Angoleme / of Rouerne / of Lym^^y^ / and of
Pyergourt: and sir Loyes Marnell sir Raymon Danduell / and diverse other. There
was none that feigned to fight valiantly and also they had good cause why: for
there were of spaygniardes and of Castyle mo than a hundred thousand men in
harness / so that by reason of their great nombre / it was long or they could
be ouercom. King Da^peter was greatly chafed and much desired to mete with the
bastard his brother / and said: where is yt horeson that calls himself
king of Castle. And the same king Henry fought right valyantly where as he
was / and held his people together right marvelously / and said. Aye good
people ye have crowned me king / therefore help and aid me / to keep the
heritage that you have give me. So that by these words and such other as he
spoke that day / he caused many to be right hardy and valiant / whereby they
abode on the field: so that because of their honor they would not fly fro the
place.

How sir Bertra^ of Clesquy was disconfyted: he taken / and king Henry saved
him self / and of the spanyardes that fled / and of the nombre of the deed.
And of the cities that yielded them up to king Dampeter: and of the answer
that he made to the prince. Cap. CC.xxxviii.
THe battle that was best fought and lengest held together was the company of
sir Bertram of Clesquy / for there were many noble me^ of arms who fought and
held toguyder to their powers: and there was done many a noble feat of arms.
And on the english part specially there was sir Johan Chandos / who that day
did like a noble knight / and governed and cou^sayled that day the duke of
Lancastre / in like manner as he did before the prince at the batell of
Poycters / wherein he was greatly renomed and praised / the which was good
reason: for a valyant man and a good knight acquitynge him self nobly among
lords and princes ought greatly to be recommended / for that day he took no
head for taking of any prisoner with his own hands / but always fought and
went forward: but there was taken by his company under his baner diverse good
knights and squyers of Aragon and of France. And specially sir Bertram of
Clesquy / sir Arnolde Dandrehen / sir Begue of Uillaynes / and mo than
threscore prisoners. So thus finally the battle of sir Bertram of Clesquy was
disconfyted / and all that were therein taken and slayne^: as well they of
France as of Aragon. There was slain the Begue of Uillyers / and taken the
lord Antoy^ge of Heynault / the lord Bresuell / sir Gawen of Bayllieull / sir
Johan of Bergenettes / sir Alemant of saint Uena^t / and diverse other. Than
drew toguyder these baners: the baner of the duke of Lancastre / of sir Johan
Chandos / and of the two marshalles / and the penon of saint George. And went
all toguyder on the battle of king Henry / and cried with a high voice saint
George guyen. Than the spanyardes and their company were sore puta back / ye
Captall of Beufz and the lord Clysson fought valyantly: and also sir Eustace
Dambreticort / sir Hughe Caurell / sir Souldyche / sir Johan Dureux / and other
acquyted the^ self that day right nobly. The prince showed himself like a
noble knight / and fought valyantly with his enemies. On the othersyde king
Henry acquitted himself right valia^tly / and recovered and turned again his
people that day three times / for after that the earl of Anxell and a three
thousand horsemen with him were departed fro the field: the other began than
greatly to be disco^fyted / and were ever ready to fly after their company /
but than ever king Henry was before them / and said. Fair lords what do
you^ wherefore will ye thus forsake and betraye me / sithe ye have made me king
and set the crown on my heed: and put the heritage of Castle into my
hands. Return and help to keep and defend me / and abide with me: for by
the grace of god or it be night all shall be ours. So that these words or such
like / encoraged his people in such wise / that it made them to abide lengar
in the field / for they durst not fly for shame: when they saw their king
and their lord so valiantly fight / and speak so amyably. So that there dyed
mo than a thousand and five hundred persons / that might well have saved
themself / and have taken the time to their advantage: and the love that they
had to their lord and king had not been.

When the battle of the marshalles were passed through their enemies / and
had disconfyted ye grettest nombre of the^: so that the spanyardes could not
susteyn nor defend them any lengar / but began to fly away in great fear /
without any good array or order toward the cite of Nauaret / and so passe^ by
the great river. So that for any words y^ king Henry could say they would not
return / and when the king saw the myschefe and disconfyture of his people /
and that he saw no recovery. Than he called for his horse and mounted thereon /
and put himself among them that fled: but he took not the way to Nauaret for
fear of enclosynge / but than took another way ^schewyng all paryls: for he
knew well that if he were taken he should dye without mercy. Tha^ the
englysshmen and gascons lept a horsebake and began to chase the spanyardes /
who sledde away sore disconfyted to the great river. And at the enter of the
bridge of Nauaret / there was a hydeous shedynge of blood and many a man slain
and drowned: for diverse lepte into the water the which was deep and hydeous:
they thought they had as live to be drowned as slain. And in this chase among
other / there were two valyant knights of Spain / beryng on them the abyte of
relygion. The one called the great priour of saint James / and the other the
great master of Calatrane. They and their company to save themself entered in
to Nauaret / and they were so nere chased at their back / by englysshmen and
gascoyns / that they wan the bridge / so that there was a great slaughter. And
thenglysshmen entered into the city after their enemies / who were entered into
a strong house of stone. Howbeit incontinent it was won byforce: and the
knights taken and many of their men slain / and all the cite ouerron and
pylled the which was greatly to thenglysshmens profit. Also they wanne king
Henry's lodging wherein they found great richesse of vessel and iowelles of
gold and silver / for the king was come thither with great nobleness: so y^
when they were disconfyted / they had no layser for to return thither again /
to save that they had left there. So this was a hydeous and a terryble
disco^fyture / and specially on the river side there was many a man slain. And
it was said as I herd after reported of some of them that were there present /
that one might have seen the water that ran by Nauaret to be of the color of
reed / with the blood of men and horse yt were there slain. This battle was
between Nauer and Nauaret in Spain. The year of the incarnacyon of our lord
Jesu Christ / a thousand three hundred threscore and six / the third day of
April / the which was on a saturday.

AFter the disconfyture of the batell of Nauaret / which was done by noone.
The prince caused his baner to be raised up a high upon a busshe on a little
hill / to the intent to draw his people thither: and so thither drue all those
that came fro the chase. Thither came the duke of Lancaster / sir Johan Chandos
/ the lord Clysson / the Captall of Beufz / the earl of Armynacke / the lord
Dalbret / and diverse other barons. And had raised up on high their baners to
draw their people thither: and ever as they came they raynged them in the
field. Also there was Loyes king of Mallorques / his baner before him whereunto
his company drue and a little there beside was sir Marten de la Karr / with the
baner of his lord the king of Nauer. With diverse other earls and barons / the
which was a goodly thing to regard and behold. Than came thither king
Dampeter right sore chafed / coming from the chase on a great black courser /
his baner beten with the arms of Castle before him. And as soon as he saw
the princes baner / he alyghted and went thither. And when the prince saw him
coming / he went and met him and did him great honor. There the king
Dampeter would have kneled down to have thanked the prince / but the prince
made great haste to take him by the hand / and would not suffer him to knele.
Tha^ the king said. Dear and fair cosyn / I ought to give you many thanks
and praises / for this (...) journey that I have attained this day / by your
means. Than the prince said: Sir yield thanks to god and give him all ye
prays for the vyctorie has come by him all only and not by me. Than the
lords of the princes counsel drew toguyder and comuned of diverse (...)ters.
And so long the prince was still there / (...) all his people were returned fro
the chase ^han he ordained four knights and four harauldes to go search the
feldes / to know what people were taken / and the nombre of the^ that were
slain: And also to know the truth of king Henry / whom they called
bastard whether he were a live or deed. And than the prince and his lords
went to the lodging of king Henry and of the spanyardes / where they were well
and easily lodged: for it was great and large / and well replenysshed of all
things necessary. So than they souped that night in great joy: and after
souper the knights and haraudes that went to visyte the field returned / and
there they reported y^ there were slain of their enemies of men of arms / a
five hundred and threscore and of commons about a seuyn thousand and five
hundred / beside them y^ were drowned: whereof the nombre was unknown. And of
their own company there was no more slain but four knights / whereof two were
gascoyns / the third an almayne / and the fourth an englysshman: and of other
commons not past a.xl. but they showed how they could not synde king Henry /
whereof king Dampeter was right sorry. So this saturday at night they rested them
self and made good chere / for they had well wherewith / for there they found
plenty of wine and other vitayls: and so refresshed the^ there all ye sunday /
the which was palm so^day.

THe sunday in the monynge when the prince was up and ready apparelled. Than he
issued out of his pauyllion / and than came to him the duke of Lancastre his
brother the earl of Armynacke / the lord Dalbret / sir Johan Chandos / the
Captall of Beufz the lord of Pomyers / sir Gyrarde Dangle the king of
Mallorques / and a great nombre of other knights and squyers. And than^e anon
after came to the prince the king Da^peter / to who^e the prince made great
honor and reverence. Than the king Dampeter said. Dear and fair cosyn
(...) pray and require you y^ ye will deliver to me the false traitors of this
country as my bastard brother / Sanxes and such other: and I shall cause them
to lose their heedes for they have well deserved it.

THan the prince aduysed him well / and said. Sir king: I require you in the
name of love and lygnage / that ye will grant me a gift and a request /
said. Good cosyn all that I have is yours: therefore I am content what soever
ye desire to grant it. Than the prince said: Sir I require you to give perdon
to all your people in your realm / such as has rebelled against you / by the
which courtessy / ye shall abide in the better rest and peace in your realm.
Except Wyllyam Garilz / for of him I am content ye take your pleasure. The king
Dampeter acorded to his desire / though it were against his will: but he durst
not deny the prince / he was so much bounden to him / and said. Fair cosyn
I grant your request with a good heart. Tha^ the prisoners were sent for: and
the prince acorded them with the king their lord / and caused him to forgive
all his yuell will to his brother the earl of Sanxes / and to all other: so
that they should make covenant and swear fealty / homage / and service to hold
of him truly for ever / and to become his men: and to knowledge him for their
lord and king for ever. This courtesy with diverse other did the prince to
the king / the which after was but smally rewarded / as ye shall here after
in this history.

ANd also the prince showed great curtesy to the barons of Spain such as were
prisoners / for if king Dampeter had taken them in his displeasure / they had
all dyed without mercy. And than sir Wyllyam Garylz was delivered to the king /
whom he hated so sore / that he would take no taunsome for him: but made his
heed to be stricken of before his logynge. Than king Dampeter mounted on his
horse and the earl Sanxes his brother / and all those that were become his men
/ and his marshalles sir Guyssharde Dangle / and sir Stephyn Gosenton and a
five hundred men of arms: and they departed fro the princes host / and rode
to Burgus. And so came thither the monday in the morning: and they of Burgus who
were well infourmed how the journey of Nauaret was atchyued / and how that
king Henry was disco^fyted / they thought not to keep the town against
Dampeter / but diverse of the richest of the town / and of the most notablest
issued out of the town and presented ye kayes of the cite to him / and
received him to their lord. And so brought him and all his me^ into ye cite of
Burgus with great joy and solemnyte / and all the sunday the prince abode
still in the logynges that they had won. And on the monday after euynsong / he
disloged and went and lodged at Berguet / and there tarried till it was
wednisday: and than they went all to the city of Burgus. And there the prince
entered in to the town with great reverence and with him the duke of Lancastre
/ therle of Armynacke / and diverse other great lords and their people made
their logynges without the town: for they could not all have been lodged
within at their ease. And when the prince was a his lodgyng there he gave and
re^dred iugementes of arms / and of all things thereto aperteyninge and there
kept field and wage of battle / wherefore it might well be said that all Spain
was come y^ day in his hands / and under his obeysaunce.

THe prince of Wales and king Dampeter held their Ester in y^ town of Burgus
/ and there tarried a three wekes and more. And on Ester day they of Sturges / of
Tollet / of Lysbone / of Cordowane / of Galyce / of Cyuyle / and of all the
other marches and lymitacions of the realm of Castle came thither and made
homage to king Dampeter: and were glad to se the prince and Damferant of
Castres. and so there was great chere made between them / and when king
Dampeter had tarried there the term that I have showed you and more and saw
that there were no mo that rebelled against him / but every man to him
obeysaunt. Than the prince said to him: Sir king ye are now thanked be god
peasably king of this yor own realm without any rebellyon or let / and sir I
and my company tarry here at a great charge and expense. Therefore we require you
to peruyde for money / to pay the wages to them that has helped to bring you
again into your realm / and in fulfylling of your promise / where unto ye have
sworn and sealed. And sir the shortlyer yt ye do it / the gretter thank
weshall give you and the more shall be yor profit / for ye know well me^ of
war must be paid to live with all or else they will take it where as they may
get it Than the king answered and said: cosyn we will hold / keep / and
accomplysshe to our power / that we have sworn and sealed unto. But sir as for
this present time we have no money / wherefore we will draw us to the marchesse
of Ciuyle: and there we will so procure for money that we will satisfy every
party and sir ye shall abide still here in the vale of Olyfes / the which is a
plentyfull country: and sir we shall return again to you in as short time as
we co^uenye^tly can or may / and at ye farthest by whitsontyd. This answer was
right pleasant to ye prince and to his counsel / and shortly after the king
Dampeter departed fro the prince / and rode toward Ciuyle / to thentent to get
money to pay his men of war as he had promised. and the prince went and loged
in the vale of Olyfe / and all his lords and people spread abroad in ye country
/ to get vitayls more plentyfull / for the^ and for their horses. There thus
they soiourned to a small profit to the country / for the companyons could not
absteyne them self / fro robbyng and pillynge of the country.

Of the honor that was given to the prince for the vyctorie of Spain and how
king Henry came into france to make war on the princes land and of the
answer that king Da^peter sent to the prince / and how the prince departed
out of Spain and came into France. Cap. CC.xxxix.
TIdinges spread abroad through France / England Almayne / and other country is
how y^ prince of Wales and his puyssance had in batell disconfyted king Henry
/ and taken slain / and drowned of his men the day of the battle / mo than.
C. thousand men: whereby the prince was greatly renomed. And his chiualry and
high entprice much praised in all places that herd thereof / and specially in
thempyre of Almayne / and in the realm of England. For the almayns /
flemynges / and englysshmen said: that the prince of Wales was chief flower of
all chiualry. and how that such a prince was well worthy to govern all the
world / sithe by his prowes he had achyued such three high entprices as he
had done. First the battle of Cressy in Poictou: the setonde / ten year after
at Poycters: and the.iii. now in Spain before Nauaret. So in England in the
city of London / the bourgesses there made great solemnyte and tryumphe for
that vyctorie / as they aunciently were wont to do for kings / when they had
overcome their enemies. And in the realm of France there were made lamentable
sorrows / for the loss of the good knights of ye realm of France / the
which were slain at that journey. And specially there was made sorrow for sir
Bertram of Clesquy / and for sir Arnolde Dandrehenne / who were taken
prisoners: And diverse other who were kept right courtesly / and some of the^
put to fynance and ransom / but not sir Bertram of Clesquy so soon. For sir
Johan Cha^dos who had the rule of him / would not deliver him: And also sir
Bertra^ made no great suit therefore.

Now let us somewhat speak of king Henry / what he did when he departed fro
the battle. And than let us return again to the prince and to king Dampeter
of Castle.
King Henry as it is said here after / saved him self as well as he might /
and withdrewe fro his enemies. And led his wife and his children as soon as
he might in to the city of Ualence in Aragon / where as the king of Aragon was
/ who was his godfather and friend: and to him recounted all his adventure. And
anon after the said king Henry was counsayled to pass further / and to god to
ye duke of Aniou / who as than was at Mo^tpellyer / and to show unto him all
his adventure. This aduyce was pleasant to the king of Arragon / and
consented well that he should go thither / because he was ennemy to the prince /
who was his nere neighbor. So thus king Henry departed fro the king of
Arragon / and left in the city of Ualence his wife and his children / and
rode so long that he paste Narbone / the which was the first city of the
realm of France on that side / and after that Beseers and all that country.
And so came to Mountpellyer / and there found the duke of Aniowe who loved him
entierly / and greatly hated the englysshmen: though he made them as than no
war. And the duke when he was well enfourmed of king Henryes business
received him right ioyously / and recounforted him as well as he might: and so
the king tarried there with him a certain space. And than went to Auygnone to
se pope Urbayne / who was as than departing to go to Rome. And than^e king
Henry returned again to Mountpellyer to the duke of Aniou / and had long
treaty toguyder. And it was showed me by them that thought the^ self to know
many things / and after it was right well seen appare^t How that this king
Henry did get of the duke of Aniowe a castle nere to Tholous / on the
marchesse of the principalyte / called Rockemor. And there he assembled
toguyder companyons and men of war / as bretons: and such other as were not
passed over into Spaygne with the prince: so that in the beginning there was a
three hundred men of war. These tidings were anon brought to my lady
princess / who as than was at Burdeux. How that king Henry purchased him
aid and socoure on all sides / to thentent to make war to the principalyte
and to the duchy of Guyen / where with she was greatly abashed. And because
that he held himself in the realm of France. She wrote letters and sent
messangers to the french king / desyringe him not to consent that the
bastard of Spaygne should make her any manner of war: seeing that her resort
was to the court of France. Certifyeng him that much yuell might ensue / and
many inconuenyentes fall thereby. Than the king condyscended lightly to the
princess request / and hastily sent messangers to the bastard Henry / who was
in the castle of Rockemore on ye fronters of Mou^taubon / and was beginning
to make war to the country of Acquitayne / and to the princes land.
Commaundynge him incontinent to avoid out of his realm / and to make no
war in the land of his dear nephue the prince of Wales and of Acquitayne.
And because to give ensample to his subgettes / that they should not be so
hardy to take any part with the bastard Henry / he caused the young earl of
Auser to be put in prison / in the castle of Loure in Paris: because he was
so great and conuersaunt with this king Henry the bastard. And as it was
said / he had promised him to aid him with a great nombre of men of arms
but thus the french king caused him to break his voyage and purpose. So thus
at the commandment of the french king / king Henry obeyed / the which was
good reasone: but for all that yet he left not his enterprice / but so he
departed fro Rockemore / with a four hundred bretons / and to him was alyed
such breton knights and squyers as follows. First sir Arnolde of Lymosyn /
sir Gesfray Rycons / sir Pouns of Lakonette / Sylue^^re Buddes / Alyot de
Calays / Alayne de saint Poule: and thesemen of arms and bretons rode over the
mountains / and entered into Bygoure in the principalyte / and there took by
scalynge a town called Bannyers. And than^e they fortifyed and repaired it
well and strongly / and than over rode the princes land / and did great hurt
and damage therein. Than^e the princess did send for sir James Audeley / who
was abydinge behind the prince in Acquitayne: as chief soueraygne gouernoure
to keep the country. How be it this said king Henry the bastard and the
bretons did great hurt and damage in the country / for daily their power
entreased more and more.

Now let us return to the prince of Wales and to his company who was in
the vale of Olyfes and there about / abydnge the coming of king Dampeter of
Castle.
THus when the prince had soiourned in the vale of the Olyffes / until the
feast of saint Johan the Baptyst in somer / abydinge for the coming of king
Dampeter / who came not nor could not here no certain tidings of him / where
with the prince was right soore troubled: and called all his counsel together
/ to know what was best to do in that behalf. Than the prince was counsayled
to send two or three knights to the king / to demand of him why he kept
not his day as he had assigned. And on this message was send / sir Nowell
Lornyche / sir Richard of Pontchardon / and sir Thomas Balaster. And they rode
so long by their iourneis that they came to the city of Cyuyle / where as they
found king Dampeter / and by semblant he right ioyously received them. These
knights did their message as they had in charge by their lord the prince.
Than the king answered them in excusing of himself and said. Sirs: certainly
it greatly displeases us / that we cannat keep the promise that we have made
with our cosyne the prince / the which we have often times showed unto our
people here in these parties. But our people excuses themself / and say the
how they can make no som^e of money / as long as the companyons be in the
country / for they have three or four times robbed our treasourers / who were
coming to our cosyne the prince / with our money. Therefore we require you
to show our cosyne fro us / that we require him that he will withdraw and
put out of this our realm these yuell people of the companyons / and that
he do leave there some of his own knights / to who^e in the name of him we
will pay and deliver such somes of money as he desires of us / and as we are
bound to pay him. This was all the answer that these knights could have
of him at that time. And so they departed and went again to the price their
lord: and than recounted to him and to his counsel all that they had herd
and seen / with the which answer the prince was much more dyspleased / than
he was before. For he saw well how that king Dampeter failed of his promise /
and varyed fro reason. The same season y^ the prince thus abode in the vale of
Olyffes / where as he had been more than the space of four months / nighe
all the somer. The king of Mallorques fell sick sore diseased / and lay sick
in his bed. Than there was put to ransom sir Arnolde Dandrenhen / the
Begue of Uyllaynes / and diverse other knights and squyers of France and of
Bretaygne / who were taken at Nauaret. And exchanged for sir Thomas Pheltone /
and for sir Richard Centon / and for sir Hughe Hastynges / and diverse other.
But sir Bertram of Clesquy abode still as prisonere with the prince / for the
englysshemen counsayled the prince / and said: that if he delivered sir
Bertram of Clesquy / he would make him greatter war than ever he had done
before: with the helping of the bastard Henry / who as than was in Bygour /
and had taken^e the town of Ba^nyers / and made great war in that quarter.
Therefore sir Bertram of Clesquy was not delivered at that time.

When that the prince of Wales herd the excusacyons of king Da^peter / than
he was much more displeased than^e he was before / and demanded counsel in
that behalf of his people / who desyredde to return home / for they bare
with full great trouble the heat / and the infectyue air of the country of
Spaygne. And also the prince himself was not verry well at case / and therefore
his people counsayled him to return again. Saying how king Damepeter has
greatly faylled him to his blame and great dishonor. Than it was showed openly
that every man should return. And when the prince should remove / he sent to
ye king of Mallorques / sir Hugh Cortnay and sir Johan Chandos: showing him
how the prince would depart out of Spain. desiryng him to take aduyce if he
would deperte or not / for the prince would be loathe to leave him behind. Than
the king of Mallorques said / sirs I thank greatly the prince / but as at this
present time I can not ride nor remove till it please god. Than the knights
said: sir will you that my lord the prince shall leave with you a certain
nombre of men to wait and conduct you / when ye be able to ride. Nay surely
sir quod the king it shall not need / for I know not how long it will be or I
be able to ride. And so they departed and returned to the prince / she wyng
him what they had done. Well said the prince / as it please god and him so be
it. Than the price departed and all his company / and went to a city called
Madigray / and there he rested in y^ vale called Foyrie / between Aragon and
Spain. And there he tarried a month: for there were certain passages closed
against him in ye marchesse of Aragon. And it was said in the host that the
king of Nauarr / who was newly returned out of prison / was agreed with the
bastard of Spain / and with the king of Aragon to let the princes passage:
but yet he did nothing as it apered after. How be it the prince was in doubt
of him / because he was in his own country / and came not to him. In this
mean season there were sent to a certain place / between Aragon and Spain /
certain persons of both parties / and so had great comunyng together diverse
days. Finally they so agreed that the king of Aragon should opyn his country /
and suffer the princes people to return and pass peasably without any let
of any of the country / payeng courtesly for yt they took.

THan came to the prince ye king of Nauer and sir Martyn de la Kar when they
saw the matter go in such wise between the king of Aragon and the prince / and
they made to the prince all the honor that they could deuyse / and offered
passage for him and for his dear brother the duke of Lancastre / and for diverse
other knights of England and of Gascoyne / but in any wise he would that the
companyons should take their way by some other passage / and not through Naurr.
Than the prince and his lords / when they saw that the way through Nauarr was
more mete and necessary for the^ than through Aragon / thought not to refuse
the king of Nauars offer / but so thanked him greatly. Thus the prince passed
through the realm of Naurr / and the king and sir Martyn de la Karr conveyed
him / till they came to the passage of Rounseualx / and so from thens they
passed by their iourneyes till they came to the city of Bayone / where he was
received with great joy. And there the prince refresshed him four days / and
than departed and rode to Burdeaulx. Where he was also received with great
solemnyte: and my lady the princess met him with her young son Edward /
who as than was of the age of three years. Than deperted the lords and men of
war one from another / and the lords of Gascoyne went home to their own
houses / and the companyons came also into the pricipalyte: abiding for their
wages. The prince was much bound to them / and promised to pay them to his
power / as soon as he had money / though king Dampeter kept not his promise
with him. yet he said they should not bear the loss thereof / sithe they had
so well served him. And king Henry the bastard who was in the garyson of
Ba^nyers in Bygoure. Than he departed thens with such men of war as he had /
and went into Aragon to the king there who loved him entierly / and ioyously
received him. And there tarried all the winter / and there made a new alyaunce
between him and the king of Aragon / and promised to make war against king
Da^peter / and the bretons that were in their company. As sir Arnolde Lymosyne
/ sir Geffray Rycouns / and sir yons de Lankane^ / rode to the passages of
Spaygne / and made war for king Henry.

Now let us speak of the delyueraunce of sir Bertram of Clesquy.
AFter that the prince of wales was returned into Acquitayne / and his brother
ye duke of Lancastre into England / and every lord into his own. Sir Bertra^
of Clesquy was still prisoner with the prince / and with sir Johan Chandos /
and could not come to his raun some nor fynaunce / the which was sore
displesaunt to king Henry / if he might have mended it. And so it fortuned
after as I was informed / that on a day the prince called to him sir Bertram of
Clesquy and demanded of him how he did / he answered and said. Sir it was
never better with me. It is reason that it should so be / for I am in prison
with the most renowned knight of the world* With whom is that said the
prince / Sir quod he that is with sir Johan Chandos. And sir it is said in the
realm of France and in other places / that ye fear me so much / that ye
dare not let me out of prison / the which to me is full great honor. The
price who understood well the words of sir Bertram of Clesquy / and parceyued
well how his own counsel would in no wise that he should deliver him / unto
the time that king Dampeter had paid him all such so^mes / as he was bound
to do. Than he said to sir Bertram / sir than ye think that we keep you for
fear of yo^ chiualry. Nay think it not / for I swear by sait George it is not
so / therefore pay for your ransom / a hundred thousand fra^kes / and ye
shall be delivered. Sir Bertram who desired greatly to be delivered / and herd
on what point he might depart / took the prince with that word / and said. Sir
in ye name of god so be it I will pay no less. And wha^ the prince herd him
say so / he would than gladly have repented him self: and also some of his
counsel / came to him and said. Sir ye have not done well so lightly to put
him to his ransom. And so they would gladly have caused the prince to have
revoked that covenant / but the prince who was a true and a noble knight said.
Sithe that we have agreed thereto / we will not break our promise. It should be
to us a great rebuke / shame and reproach / if we should not put him to
ransom / seeing y^ he is content to pay such a great som^e as a hundred
thousand fra^kes. So after this acorde / sir Bertram of Clesquy was right besy
and studied daily how to get this som^e for his rau^some. And did so much
with the aid of the french king and of his friends / and of the duke of
Aniou / who loved him entierly / yt he paid in less than a month a hundred
thousand frankes. And so he departed and went to serve the duke of Aniou /
with two thousand fightyng men in Prouens / where as the duke lay at siege
before the town of Tarraston / the which held of the king of Naples.

IN the same season there was a marriage concluded by twene the lord Lion duke
of Clarence and earl of Ulseter / son^e to the king of England. And the
daughter to the lord Galyanche lord of Myllan / the which young lady was
nere to therle of Sauoy: and daughter to the lady Blanch his suster. And thus
the duke of Clare^ce aco^panyed with noble knights and squyers of England ca^e
into France: where as the king / the duke of Burgon / the duke of Burbone / and
the lord of Coucy / received him with great joy in Paris. And so he passed
through ye realm of France and came into Sauoy / where as the gentle earl
received him right honorably at Chambrey / and there he was three days greatly
feested with ladies and damsels / and than he deperted / and therle of Sauoy
brought him to Myllan. and there the duke wedded his nece / daughter to the
lord of Myllan / ye monday next after the feast of the holy Trinyte: the year
of our lord / a thousand. CCC.lxviii.

Now let us return to the business of France. Cap. CC.xl.
YE have well herd here before recounted / the manner of ye vyage that the
prince of Wales had made into Spain / and how he deperted thens not well
content with the king Dampeter / and how he returned into Acquitayne. So that
when he was thus returned all manner of men of war followed him because they
thought not to abide behind in Spain / because king Dampeter paid not the^
their wages as he had promised. And thus when they were all returned / the
price had not payment for them / so ready as he would have had for his vyage
into Spain had so sore mynisshed and wasted his richesse / that it was
marueyle to think thereon. And so soiourned these companyons upon the country
of Acquitayne who could not absteyn themself fro robbyng of the country / for
they were well.vi. M. fightyng men. And at the last the prince desired the^ to
depart his realm / for the country was not able to susteyn the^ no le^ger.
The capitayns of these co^panyons were all englysshmen and gasco^s. As sir
Robert Briquet / Johan Treuell / Robert Ceny / sir Gaylarde Uyger / the Bourge
of Bertuell / the Bourge Camus / the Bourge of Lespare / Nandon of Bergerant /
Bernard de la Sale: and many other which would not displease the prince. But
issued out of the principalyte as shortly as they might / and entered into the
realm of France / the which they called their chamber and passed ye river of
Loyre / and so came in to Champayne and in to the bysshopriche of Raynes: and
always their nombre increased. And to adventure them self / they serched all
about the realm of France / and did many yuell trybulacions and vilayne
deeds: whereof the complayntes came daily to the french king and to his
counsel. How beit they could find no remedy / for they durst not fight with
them: and the people all about marueyled greatly that the prince of Wales would
send them thither to make war. Than the french king sent for the lord
Clysson / and made him great captain against those yuell companyons / because
he was a good knight and a hardy: and the king had him in great love and
favor. And in the same season there was a marriage made between the lord
Dalbret / and the lady Isabell of Bourbone / of the which the prince was
nothing glad: for he had rather that the lord Dalbret had been married in
some other place. For the which cause the price spoke great words against him
/ but the greattest of his counsel / as well knights as squyers / excused him
all that they might. Saying to ye prince how that every man will be glad to
auau^ce himself as nere as he can. and that a good knight ought not to be
blamed though he purchase his own honor and profit / so that he leave not
thereby to serve his price or master / in that he is bound to do. So by these
words or such semblable / the price was somewhat apeased: how be it what so
ever semblant he made he was not very well content / for he thought verily that
the same marriage should be cause of with drawing of love fro him / and fro
them that took his part / the which was of truth / as ye shall here
afterward in this history.

How the barons of gascone complained to the french king of the price of
wales / and how king Henry returned into Spain / and of the alyaunces that
king Dampeter made: and of the counsel that sir Bertram of Clesquy gave to
king Henry / and how king Dampeter was disconfyted. Cap. CC.xli.
IN the same season that these companyons turmented thus the realm of France
/ the prince was counsayled by some of his couusayle to reyase a fowage through
out all Acquitayne and specially the bishop of Bades / for the state of the
price and princess was so great / that in all christendom was none like. So
to this counsel for reysinge of this fowage / were called all the noble
barownes of Gascoyne / of Poyctou / of Xaynto^ / and of diverse other cities and
good towns in Acquitayne. And at Nyorte where this parlyament was holden:
there it was showed specially and generally by the bishop of Bades
chancellor of Acquitayne / in the presens of the prince: how and in what
manner this fowage should be raised. Declarin ge how the prince was not in
mind yt it should endure any lengar than five years / to run throughout his
country. And that the reysing thereof / was for thyntent to pay such money as
he ought by reason of his journey into Spain. To the which ordinance were
well agreed the poyctous: and they of Xaynton / Lymosyn / Rouergne / and of
Rochell. On the condycion that the prince would keep the course of his coin
stable.vii. year / but diverse of other marchesse of Gascoyne refused this
purpose. As ye earl of Armynacke / the lord Dalbret his neuewe / the earl of
Gomynges / the Uycount of Carmayne / the lord de la Barde / the lord of Cande
/ the lord of Pyncornet / and diverse other great barownes. Saying how that
in time past when they obeyed to the french king / they were not than grieved
nor oppressed with any subsydes or inposicyons / and no more they said they
would as than / as long as they could defend it. Saying how their lands and
segnyories were fre and except fro all dettes / and that the prince
haddesworne so to keep and maynteyne them. How be it to depart peasably fro
this parlyament / they answered that they would take better advise / and so
return again both prelates / bysshoppes / abbottes / barownes / and
knights. And the prince nor his counsel could have as than none other
answer. Thus they departed from the town of Nyort / but it was commanded
them by the prince / that they should return again thither at a day assigned.

THus the barownes and lords of Gascoyne returned into their countrees / and
agreed fermely toguyder / that they would not return again to ye prince /
nor suffer the fowage to rynne in the lands: thau^e they made war against
the prince therefore. Thus the country began to rebel against the prince /
and the lord of Armynacke the lord Dalbret / the lord of Gomegynes / the
earl of Pyncornet and diverse other prelates / barownes / knights / and squyers
of Gascoyne went into France and made great complayntes in the french kings
chamber (The king and his peers being present) of the greffes that the prince
of Wales would do to them saying how their ^e sort ought to be to the french
king / and to draw to him / as to their sovereign lord. And the king who
would not break the peace / between him and the king of England began to
dyssemble and said. Sirs surely the inrysdictyon of our heritage / and of the
crown of France we will always keep and augment / but we have sworn to
diverse artycles in the peace / of the which I remember not all. Therefore we
shall visyte and behold the tenoure of the letters / and in as much as we may
do we shall aid you / and shall be glad to agree you with the prince our dear
nephue / for parauenture he is not well counsayled to put you or yo^ subgettes
fro their fredoms / and fraunchesses. So with the answer that the king made
the^ at that time they were content / and so abode still at Paris with the
king / in purpose not to return again into their own countrees / with the
which the prince was nothing well content: but always he still perseuered in
ye purpose of reysinge of this fowage. Sir Johan Chandos who was one of the
greattest of his counsel / was contrary to this opinyon / and would gladly
that the prince would have left it: but when he saw that ye prince would not
leave his purpose / to thyntent that he would bear no blame nor reproach in the
matter. He took his leave of the price and made his excuse to go in to Normandy
to visyte the land of saint Sauyoure the Uycount / whereof he was lord / for
he had not been there in three years before. The prince gave him leave: and so
he departed out of Poyctou and went to Constantyne / and tarried in the town of
saint Savior more tha^ half a year. And always the prince proceeded on the
reysynge of this fowage / the which if he had brought about / should have
been well worth every year a.xii. hundred thousand fra^kes. Every fire to have
paid yearly a frank / the rich to have borne out the poor.

Now let us return to king Henry / who was all this season in the realm of
Arragon / and let us show how he perseuered after.
THe most part of the state of the prince and of his business / was well
known with the kings there about. As with king Peter of Aragon / and with
king Henry: for they laid great / wait to know it. They understood well how
the barownes of Gascon were gone to Paris to the french king / and in a manner
began to rebel against the prince / with the which they were nothing
displeased. And specially king Henry: for than he thought to attain again to
conquer the realm of Castle / the which he had lost by the means of the
prince. And so than king Henry took leave of the king of Arragon / and
departed fro the town of Ualence the great: and out of Arragon with him there
went the Uycount of Roquebertyn / and the Uycount of Roodes / and they were
three thousand horsemen / and six thousand a foot / with a certain genowayes
that the had in wages. And so they rode toward Spaygne till they came to the
City of Burgus / the which incontinent was opyned and rendered up to king
Henry. And they received him as their lord / and fro thens he went to the Uale
Olyfe: for king Henry understood that the king of Mallorques was still there
And when they of the town of Uale Olyfe understood that they of Burgus had
yielded up their town to king Henry / than they thought natte to keep their
town against him / and so yielded them to him / and received him as their
lord. As Soon as the king was entered into the town / he demanded where the
king of Mallorques was / ye which was showed him. Tha^ the king entered into
the chamber where he lay not fully hole of his disease: than^e the king went to
him / and said. Sir king of Mallorques ye have been our enemy / and with a
great army ye have enuaded this our realm of Castle. Wherefore we set our
hands on you / therefore yield your self as our prisoner or else ye ar but
deed. And when the king of Mallorques saw him self in that case / and that
no defense would help him / he said. Sir king truly I am but deed if that
it please you / and sir gladly I yield me unto you but to none other. Therefore
sir if your mind be to put me into any other man's hands show it me / for I
had rather dye than to be put in to the hands of my v^ter enemy the king of
Aragon. Sir said the king fear you not I will do you but right: if I did
otherwise I were to blame. ye shall be my prisoner: outher to acquyte you / or
to raun some you at my pleasure. Thus was the king o^ Mallorques taken by king
Henry and caused him to be well kept there and than he rode further to ye cite
of Lion in Spain / the whi^he incontinent was opened against him.

When the town and cite of Lion in Spaygne was thus rendered to king Henry /
all the country and marchesse of Galyce / turned and yielded them to king
Henry / and to him came many great lords and barownes / who before had done
homage to king Da^peter / for what so ever semblant they had made to him
before the prince / yet they loved him not. Because of old time he had been to
them so cruel / and they were ever in fear / that he would turn to his
^^ueltie again. And king Henry was ever amyable and meke to them promisyng to
do mo the for them: therefore they all drue to him. Sir Bertram of Clesquy was
not as than in his company but he was coming with a two thousand fightyng men /
and was deperted fro the duke of Amou who had achyued his war in Proue^s / and
broken up his sege before Taraston by co^posicion I can not show how. and with
sir Bertra^ of Clesquy there were diverse knights and squye^s of France
desyring to exercise the feate of a^mes. And so they came toward king Hen^y /
who as than had laid si^ge before Tollet.

^^dynges came to king Da^peter how the country turned to his bastard
brother there as he lay in the marchesse of Civil and Portyngale / where he was
but smally beloved. And when he herd thereof he was sore displeased against his
brother / and against the^ of Castle * because they forsook him and swear a
great oath* that he would take on them so cruel a vengeance / that it should
be ensample to all other Than he sent out his commandment / to such as he
trusted would aid and serve him / but he sent to some such as ^a^e not to him
/ but turned to king Henry / and sent their homages to him. And when this king
Da^peter saw that his men began to fail him. Than he began to dout and took
counsel of Domferant of Ca^tces who never failed him / and he gave him
counsel that he should get asmoche people to gyder as he might / as well out
of Granade / as out of other places. And so in all have to ride against his
brother the bastard / or he did conquer any further in the country. Than
king Dampeter sent inco^tynent to the king of Portyngale / who was his cosyn
germayne: also he sent to the king of Granade and of Bell Maryn / and to the
king of Tramesames / and made alyaunces with the^ three: and they sent him mo
than.xx. thousand sarazy^s to help him in his war. So thus king Dampeter
did somoche that what of Christenmen and of sarazyus / he had to the nombre
of.xl. thousand men in the marchesse of Civil. And in the mean season while
that king Henry lay atsiege / sir Bertram of Clesquy came to him with.ii. M.
fighting men / and he was received with great joy / for all the host was
greatly reioysed of his coming.

BIng Dampeter who had made his assemble in the marchesse of Civil / and there
about: desiring greatly to fight with the bastard his brother. Departed fro
Ciuyll and took his tourney toward Tollet to reyse the siege there / the
which was fro him a.vii. days journey. Tidings came to king Henry how that
his brother Dampeter aproched / and in his company mo than.xl. thousand men of
one and other. And thereupon he took counsel / to the which counsel was
called the knights of France and of Aragone. And specially sir Bertram of
Clesquy / by whom the king was most ruled / and his counsel was that king
Henry should auaunce forth to encountre his brother Da^peter: and in what
co^dycion so ever that he found him in / inco^tynent to set on and fight with
him. Saying to the king. Sir I here say he comes with a great puyssaunce / and
sir if he have great layser in his coming it may turn you and us all to great
dyspleasure: and therefore sir if we go hastily on him or he beware /
parauenture we shall find him and his company in that case and so dispur^eyed
/ that we shall have him at advantage and so we shall disco^fyte him / I dout
not. The counsel of ser Bertram of Clesquy was well herd and taken / and so
king Henry in an euenyng departed fro the host with a certain of the best
knights and fightyng men that he could chose out in all his host. And left
the resydue of his company in ye keeping and gouernyng of his brother therle of
Anxell. And so rode forth and he had seuynspyes ever coming and going / who
ever brought him word what his brother Dampeter did / and all his host. And
king Dampeter knew nothing how his brother came so hastily toward him /
wherefore he and his company rode the more at large without any good order. And so
in a morning king Henry and his people met and encountered his brother king
Dampeter / who had lain that night in a castle thereby called Nantueyle / and
was there well received and had good ^here. And was departed thens the same
morning / wenyng full little to have been fought with all as that day: and so
suddenly on him with baners displayed there came his brother king Henry / and
his brother Sanxes and sir Bertram of Clesquy / by whom the king and all his
host was greatly ruled. And also with them there was the begue of Uillaynes / the
lord of Roquebertyn / the vycou^t of Rodaix / and their co^panyes: they were a
six thousand fightyng men / and they rode all close together / and so ran and
encountered their enemies: cryenge Castle for king Henry and our lady of
Clesquy / and so they disco^fyted and put a back the first brunt. There were
many slain and cast to the earth / there were none taken to ransom / y^
which was appointed so to be / by sir Bertram of Clesquy / because of the great
no^bre of sarazyns that was there. And when king Da^peter who was in the mids
of y^ prease among his own people / herd how his men were assailed and put
abacke by his brother the bastard Henry and by the frenchmen / he had great
marvel thereof / and saw well how he was betrayed and visceyued / and in
aduentur to lose all / for his men were soresparcled abroad Howbeit like a good
hardy knight and of good comfort rested on the field / and caused his banerr
to be vnrolled / to draw together his people. And sent word to them that were
behy^de to have them forward because he was fighting with his enemies /
whereby every man auau^ced forward to the baner. So there was a maueylous great
and a ferse battle / and many a man slain of king Da^peters part / for king
Henry and sir Bertram of Clesquy sought their enemies with so coragyous and
ferse will / that none could endure against them. How beit that was not
lightly done / for king Dampeterand his company were six against one / but they
were taken so suddenly that they were disco^fyted / in such wise that it was
marueyle to behold.

TThis battle of the spanyardes one against another / and of these two kings
and their alyes was nere to Nantueyle / the which was that day right ferse and
cruel. There were many good knights of king Henryes part: as sir Bertram of
Clesquy / sir Geffray Rycons / sir Arnolde Lymosyn / sir Gawen of Baylleule /
the begue of Uillaynes / Alayne of saint Poule / Alyot of Calays / and diverse
other. And also of ye realm of Aragon there was the vycount of Roquebertyn /
the vycou^t of Rodaix / and diverse other good knights and squiers whom I can
not all name. And there they did many noble deeds of arms / the which was
needful to them so to do: for they found ferse and strong people against
them. As sarazyus / jews / and portyngales: the jews fled and turned their
backs and fought no stroke / but they of Granade and of Belmaryn fought
fersely with their bows and archegayes / and did that day many a noble deed of
arms. And king Dampeter was a hardy knight and fought valyantly with a great
axe / and gave therewith many a great stroke / so that none durst aproch nere to
him. And the baner of king Henry his brother met and recou^tred against his /
each of them cryenge their cries. Than the battle of king Dampeter began to
opyn: than Domferant of Castres / who was chief counsay lour about king
Dampeter: saw and perceived well how his people began to lose and to be
disconfyted: said to the king. Sir / save yor self and withdraw you in to the
castle of Nauntueyle / sir if ye be there ye be in sauegarde * for if ye be
taken with your enemies ye are but deed without mercy. The king Dampeter
believed his counsel and deperted as soon as he might and went to ward
Nantueyle / and so came thider in such time that he found the gates opyn /
and so he entered all only with.xii. persons. And in the mean season the other
of his company fought still in the feldes / as they were sparcled abroad here
and there. The sarazyns defended them self as well as they might / for they
knew not the country: therefore to fly they thought was for them none avail.
Than tidings came to king Henry and to sir Bertram of Clesquy how that king
Dampeter was fled and withdrawn into the castle of Nantueyle / and how that
the begue of Uillaynes had pursued him thither / and in to his castle there was
but one passage / before the which passage the Begue of Uiyllaynes had pyght
his standerd. Of the which tidings king Henry and sir Bertram of Clesquy was
right ioyouse: and so drew to that part / in sleyng and beatyng down their
enemies like beestes / so that they were weary of kyllyng. This chase endured
more than.iii. hours: so that day there was moo than.xiiii. thousand slain and
sore hurt. There were but few that were saved / except such as knew y^
palsages of the country. This battle was beside Nantueyle in Spain /
the.xiii. day of y^ month of August. The year of our lord god / a thousand
three hundred / threscore and eight.

How king Dampeter was taken and put to death / and so king Henry was again
king of Castle / and of the tenor of certain letters touchi^ge the french
king and the king of England / and of the counsel that was given to king
Charles of France / to make war to the king of England. Cap. CC.xlii.
AFter this disconfyture / and yt king Henry had obtained the victory / than
they laid sege round about the castle of Na^tueyle / where in was king
Da^peter. Than king Henry sent for the resydue of his company to Tollet / where
as they lay at siege. Of the which tidings therle of Auxell and therle of
Sa^res were right joyful. This castle of Nantueyle was right strong and able
to have hold against them all a long space / if it had been purueyed of vitayle
/ and other things necessary: but there was not in the castle scant to serve
four days / whereof king Da^peter and his company were sore abashed / for they
were so straightly watched day and night / that a bird coud not come out of the
castle without spyeng. Than king Da^peter seeing himself thus be set round
about with his enemies / and knew no way of peace or concord / was in great
ymaginacyon. So all peryls consydred / and for defaut of vitayle: he was
counsayled to depart privily at ye hour of mydnight / and.xii. persons with
him: and so to aduentur on the grace of god / and gydes were appointed to bring
him in sauegard. And so about the time of mydnight next after / the king
Dampeter and Domferant of Casters / and.xii. other persons with them departed
out of the castle. The night was very dark / and the begue of Uillayns kept
watch without y^ same night / and a. CCC. with him. And as king Da^peter and
his company issued out of the castle / and went down a hye way as privily as
they could deuyce. the begue of Uillayns who was ever in dout lest they should
escape / the which caused him to make the surerr watch. He thought he herd men
pass down the hye way and said to them that were about him. Sirs: keep you
still all preuy / for me think I here folks come in the way / we will go
know what they be / and what they seek here at this time of night perauenture
there be some that are coming to reuitayle y^ castle. Than the Begue stepped
forth with his dagger in his hand / and came to a man that was nere to king
Da^peter / and said: What art thou? and he russhed forth with his horse fro him
/ and passed by them. The begue stepped to king Dampeter who was next / and
said: What art y^? show me thy name or thou art but deed / and took him by
the bridell / for he thought he should not pass fro him as y^ other did. And
when king Dampeter saw such a route of men of war before him / and that he
could not escape / said. Sir begue of Uillayns I am king Dampeter of Castle /
I yield me to you as a prisoner / and put me and my company the which ar
but.xii. persons into your hands and pleasure. And sir I require you by y^
way of gentylnesse to bring me into some sauegard / and I shall pay to you
such rau^some as ye will desire / for I thank god I have enough where / with /
so that I may escape fro the hands of the barstarde my brother. Than the Begue
as I was informed answered / and said. Sir I shall bring you and your company
in to sauegarde / and your brother shall know nothing of you by me. So thus
king Dampeter was brought to the Begues lodgyng / into the proper loging of sir
yone of Kaonet. And he had not ben there the space of an hour / when that king
Henry and therle of Roquebertyn and a certain with the^ came to the same
logyng. And as soon as king Henry was entered in to the chamber / he said. where
is that horeson and jew / that calls himself king of Castle. Than king
Dampeter who was alryght hardy and a cruel knight auaunced himself / and
said. Nay thou art a hores son / and I am son to king Alphons / and there
with he took king Henry his brother in his arms / and wrestled so with him /
that he over thrue him on a benche / and set his hand on his knyfe / and had
slain him without remedy / and the vycount of Roquebertyn had not been. He
took king Dampeter by the leg and turned him up sedowne / so that king Henry
was than above / who drue out a long knyfe / and struck king Dampeter into the
body. There with his men came in to help him. and there was slain also by him a
knight of England called ser Rafe Helm / who was sometime called ye grene
squier / and an other squire called James Roulant because they made defense.
But as for Domfe rant of Casters and the other had none yuell / but remained
prisoners to the Begue of Uyllayns / and to sir Lion of Kaonet.

THus ended king Dampeter of Castle who sometime reigned in great prosperyte.
And after he was slain he was left three days above y^ earth / the which me
think was great pity. Than the next day the lord of Na^tueyle yielded him to
king Henry / and he took him to mercy / and all tho that would turn to him.
Than tidings ran over all Castle how king Da^peter was slain / whereof his
fre^des were sorry / and his enemies joyful. But when the king of Portyngale
herd how his cosyn king Da^peter was deed / he was right sorrowful: and swear
and said that his death should be revenged. And so he sentinco^tynent his
defya^ce to king Henry and made him war / and kept the marchesse of Ciuyll
against him a certain season / but for all that king Henry left not his purpose
in pursuyng of his enterprise / but returned to Tollet / the which yielded up
straight to him / and all the country there about. And at last the king of
Porti^gale thought not to keep any lengar war against king Henry: so there was
a peace made between the^ / by the means of the prelates and lords of Spain.
Thus king Henry abode in peace king of Castle and with him sir Bertram of
Clesquy / sir Olyuer of Ma^ny / and other knights and squyers of france and of
Bretayne. And king Henry did much for the^ as he was bound to do for without
their help he had not obtained his purpose / and so he made sir Bertram
constable of Spain / and gave him the land of Soyrie / the which was yearly
worth.xx. M. trankes / and to sir Olyuer his nephue he gave the land of Crete
the which was yearly worth.x. M. fra^kes: and also he gave fair lands to
diverse other knights and squiers. Than the king went and lay at Burgus with
his wife and children. Of his prosperyte and good adventure / greatly reioysed
the french king / the duke of Aniou / and also the king of Aragon. About the
same time dyed / sir Lion of England duke of Clarence / who had past the sea
as ye have herd before / and had / married the daughter of Galays lord of
Myllayne / but because he dyed stra^gely / the lord Edward Spens his company
on kept war against him a certain space but finally he was informed of the
truth. Now let us return to the adventures of the duchy of Acquitayne.

YE have herd here before how the prince was determined to reyse a fowage in
his land / the which his people thought should be to their great charge / and
specially they of gascone / for they of the low marches / as of Poytou /
Xayton / and Rochell acorded lightly thereto / because they were nere to the
princes abidyng / and also they were ever / more obeysant / ferme and stable to
the prince / than tho of the further countries. And to bring this matter to
pass / ye prince and his counsel had diverse perlyamentes / at Nyort /
Angoleme / Poyters / at Burdeux / and at Bergerat: but always they of Angoleme
me^teyned still / and said they would pay nothing / and they said they would
not suffer this fowage to ryn in their country. Saying how their resort has been always in the chamber of the french king. Of the which resort the
prince was sore displeased and argued against it / and said: they ought to have
no resort there / affirmynge how the french king had quyted all resortes and
iurisdyctions / when he re^dred the lands of the king of England his as it is
well apare^t in the tenor of the charters of ye peace. Wherein it makes plain
mention / so that there is no article reserved for the french king in the peace.
To y^ answered again y^ gascons / saying how it was not in the power of the
french king to aquyte the^ fro their resort: for the prelates and barons of
cities and good towns of Gascone would never have suffered it / nor never will
if it were to do again: though the realm of France should ever abide in war.
Thus y^ princes and lords of gascoyne sustained still their opinyon and abode
at Paris with the french king: as therle of Armynake / the lord Dalbret /
therle of Pyergort the earl of Comygines / and diverse other. And they daily
informed the king / how the prince by his great pride and presumpcion / would
trede them under: and reyse up new things in their countries / the which
they said they would never suffer to be done / consydering that their resort
was to him. Therefore they desired y^ the prince should be apelled in to the
chamber of perlyament before the peers of France: to answer there to the grefes
and troubles that he would do to them. The french king who would entertayne
these lords of Gascone y^ this required him of aid and confort / as their
sovereign lord. And y^ they should draw to none other court / for lesynge of
that seignory co^discended to their request against his will / by cause he saw
well it should turn to have opyn war / the which without a good tytell of
reason he would be loathe to move Also he saw his realm sore troubled with
co^panyons and enemies / and also his brother ye duke of Berry was in hostage
in England / therefore he took great leyser in this case. In ye same season came
into France the lord Guy of Ligny earl of s. Poule without taking of any
leave of thenglysshmen by great subtylte: the manner how / were to long here
to rehearse / therefore I will pass it over brefely. This earl hated so the
englysshmen yt he could say no good of them / and he did asmoche as he might
that the french king should co^discend to the request of ye gascons / for he
knew well if the prince were apeled to ye court of perlyament / it should be a
great occasion of mouyng of war. And to the opynion of the earl of s. Poule
was agreed diverse prelates / earls barons / and knights of the realm of
France: and they said to the king / how that the king of England had not well
kept the peace / whereunto he was sworn and had sealed to / acordinge to the
tenor of the treaty made at Bertiguin beside de Charters / and after co^fermed
at Calays. For they said thenglysshmen has hated the realm of France more /
sith the peace was made than they did before. And sir this that we say ye
shall find of troth / if ye cause the charters of the peace to be reed / to
the which the king of England and his son are bound by their faith and oath.
Than the king to be better informed of the truth and to keep ye rightes of
his realm caused to be brought into the chamber of counsel all the charters
of the peace / and made them to be reed over often times / the better to
examyne ye points and artycles comprised in the^. And among other there was
one submission / whereon the king and his counsel arested most / because it
spoke clearly and plainly of that they looked for / the tenor whereof here after
follows.

EDward by the grace of god: king of england / lord of Irlande and of
Acquitayn. To all them that this present letters seyth: We send gretyng / know
you all that in the final and last acorde and peace made / between us and our
right dear brother the french king / are contained two artycles / co^prisyng ye
form following. The first is / where it is said that the foresaid kings are
bound to cause to be co^fermed all the said artycles comprised in the peace by
the ho la father the pope / and so to be delyuerd by sentence fro the court of
Rome / touching the perfection and acco^plysshment of this present treaty: and
so to be delyuerd to the perties / at lest within three wekes / after the french
king should be aryued at Calys. Also to thentent that these artycles and
treaties passed / should be the more ferme and stable / there should be made
certain bonds and delivered as follows. That is to say: letters sealed with
seals of both kings and their eldest sons / such as should be devised by
the counsayles of both kings. And also the said kings and their children
should swear and other of great lynage to the no^bre of.xx. that they should
keep and aid to be kept / asmoche as in the^ lies / all the said artycles
acorded and agreed: and to aco^plysshe the same / without fraud or male engine
And also that both kings should do the best of their powers / and all their
fre^des to bring all the rebels into obeisance / acordyng to the form of the
truce. and also that both kings should submyt themself and their realms /
to the correction of the pope / to the^tent that he should co^streyne by
censuries of the church / who so ever should rebel to fall to concord and
peace. And beside that both kings and their heirs / by oath and assurance:
should renounce all graces and prosses of any deed done by the^ / and though by
disobeysance / rebellyon / or puyssance of any of the subgettes of the french
king / whereby the king should be let to accomplysshe all the said artycles. yet
the king of England nor his heirs for all yt should make no war to the realm
of France / but both kings together should enforce themself to reduce the
rebels to peace and concord. and also though the subgettes of the king of
England would not render the towns / castles / or fortresses / which they
held in the realm of France / the which ought to be delyuerd by reason of
the peace / or by any other just cause / whereby the king of england should be
let to aco^plysshe that he ought to do by reason of this treaty. Than both
kings together should make war against such rebels / to bring the^ to good
obeisance / and to recover such towns / castles / and fortresses / and to
deliver the^ there as they ought to be. And of this should there be made as
perfyte and as sure bands as could be devised / as well by the holy father the
pope and the coledge of cardynalles / as by other. Also there was another
article in ye same treaty / saying thus: In token and perfyte knowledge that we
desire to have and to norisshe perpetual peace and love / between us and our
brother of France. We renounce and by these presents do renounce all graces
and other process of deed against our said brother / his heirs and
successors of the realm of France / and subgettes thereof. And promise and
swear / and have sworn by the body of Jesu christ / for us and our successors
ye we should not do nor suffer to be done by deed or word any thing against
this renu^ciacio^ / nor against any thing contained in the foresaid artycles.
And if we do or suffer to be done to the contrary by any manner of way / the
which god for beve. We will than yt we be reputed for false and forsworn and
to ryn into such blame and disfainy as a king sacred ought to do in such
case. And clearly we renounce all dispe^sacions and absolucions of ye pope /
and if any be obtained we will they stand for naught / and to be of no valor
/ and yt they aid us not in no manner of case. And the more fermlyer to uphold

The.xxiiii. day of Octobre.

Among other writings that had been granted / as well at Bertigny beside
Charters as at Calays: when king Johan was there. This said charter was one of
the^ / and was well reed and examyned by king Charles / in the presence of the
chief of his counsel. Than ye prelates and barons of France said to the king.
Sir ye king of England and the prince his son / have not fulfilled the said
peace / but have taken towns and castles and do keep the^: to the great damage
of this your realm / and rau^someth and pylleth the people so that the payment
of the rede^cion is yet in pertie unpaid. Therefore sir / you and your
subgettes have good right and just cause to brek the peace / and to make war
against the^glyshmen / and to take fro the^ Bretayn / the which they have on
this side the water. Also some of his counsel showed him secretly by great
delyberacion saying sir: hardely take on you this war / forye have cause so
to do. For sir as soon as ye ones begin the war / ye shall se and find yt they
of ye duchy of Acqquitayn shall turn to you: as well prelates / barons / earls
/ knights and squiers: as the burgesses of good towns. ye may se sir / how
the prince would proceed in reysing of this fowage / but he can not bring it to
his purpose: and so there by he is in hatred withal persons / for they of
Poictou / Xaynton / Querry / Lymosyn / Rouerne / and of Rochell / are of such
nature / yt they can in no wise love the^glyshmen / nor the^glyshmen the^ /
they are so proud and presu^tuous: nor never did. And also beside that / ye
officers of the price does such extorcio^s on the people of Xainto^ Poitou /
and Rochell: for they take all in aba^don / and reyseth somoch of the^ in the
tytell of ye price so that there is none yt is sure to have any thing of his
own. And also the ge^tylmen of the country can attain to no office nor
preferme^t / for ye englyshmen and servants to the prince has all. Thus the
french king was moved and cou^sayled to move war / and na^ely by the duke of
Aniou who lay at Tholous / desired greatly the war / as he that leued nothing
the^glishmen / because of such displeasures as they had done him in time past.
And also the gascons said often times to the king. Dear sir we are bound to
have our resort to your court / therefore we humbly require you / yt ye will do
right and law. And as ye are the most rightful price of the world / do us
right: on the great grefes and extorcions yt the price of Wales and his people
does / and would do to us. and sir if ye refuce to do us right / we shall tha^
purchase for our self some remedy / in some other place: and shall yield and
put our self under the iurisdyction of such a lord as shall cause us to have
reason: and so thereby than shall you lose your seignory over us. And the french
king who was ^othe to lose the^* thinkyng it might be a great hurt and
prejudice to him and to his realm / answered the^ right curtesly and said.
Sirs for fault of law nor of good counsel* ye shall not need to resort to
any court / but all only to mind. Howbeit in all such business / it
behooves to work and follow good counsel and aduyce. Thus the king drove them
of / nigh ye space of a year / and kept them still with him at Paris / and
paid for all their e^pences / and gave them great gifts and iowelles. And
always raused to besecretly enquered among them / if the peace were broken
between him and England / whyder they would maynteyne his quarrel or not / and
they answered that if the war were ones open / the french king should not
need to care for that part for they said they were strong enough to keep war
with the price and all his puyssance. Also the king sent to the^ of Abuyle /
to know if they would turn and take his part and become french. And they
answered that they desired nothing in all the world so much / as to be
french: they hated so deedly the ^^glysshmen. Thus the french king gate him
^r^des on all pertes / or else he durst not have done y^ he did. In the same
season was borne Charies the kings eldest son / in the year of our lord (...).
CCC. l^viii. whereof the realm of France was joyful / and a little before was
borne Charles Dalbret. Of the birth of these two / who were cosyn germayns /
was all the realm ioyefull and specially the french king.

How the french king sent to so^^n the prince of wales by apell to a year
personally in the chamber of the ^eres of France at Paris / to answer there
against the barons of Gascone Cap. CC.xliii.
SO much the french king was exhorted by them of his counsel / and so often
required by the^ of Gascoyne / that there was apell made and formed / to be sent
in to (...)quitayne to apele the prince of wales to the ^lyament of Paris. And
it was devised by the ^rle of Armynake the lord Dalbret / the earl of
^^ergo^rt therle of Comynges / the vycont of ^^rmayne* the lord de la Barde /
the lord of ^^ncornet and diverse other / who were chief causers of this
matter. And this apele contained how for the great grefes / that these gascons
co^pleyned that the prince of wales and Acquitayne would do to the^ and to
their people. Therefore they made their resort to the french king / reqryng
that the prince might be apelled / sith they had made the french king their
judge. And when this apell was made and duly corrected by all the wise counsel
of France / than it was concluded by the said counsel / that it should be
signified to the prince / and that he should be apelled to apere in proper
person at Paris / in the chamber of the peers of France / to answer to the
co^playntes made there against him. And to bear this apell was commanded a
clerk well langaged to do such a business / and a knight with him called
Ca^ponell of Ca^ponall. And so they and their company deperted fro Paris / and
took their way toward Poictou / and so passed through Berry / Tourayne /
Poyctou / and Xaynton / and came to Blay / and there passed the river. And so
came to Burdeux where as the prince and princess was / and always in every
place they said how they were messangers fro the french king wherefore they were
ye better welcome in to every place. Than they took up their logynge and tarried
there all that night / and in the next morning at a co^uenyent hour / they went
to the abbey of saint Andrews where the prince was loged / and there they were
well received. And when the prince knew of their coming / he caused the^ to
come before him / and when they came into his presens they kneled down / and
made their reverence / and delivered the prince letters of credence. The prince
took and reed the^ and said / sirs ye be welcome / declare your message yt ye
have in charge to show us. Tha^ y^ clerk said: right dear sir / here is a
let^ that was delivered to us at Paris / by our lord the french king / y^
which letter we promised by our faithes to publysh openly in your presens: for
sir they touch you. The prince than began to change color / and had great
marueyle what it might be / and so had other knights that were about him /
howbeit he refrayned himself / and said. Say on sirs what ye will / good
tidings we will be glad to here. Than the clerk took ye writing and reed it
word by word / y^ tenor of y^ which herafter follows.

CHarles by the grace of god french king / to our nephue the prince of wales
and Ac^tayne / send gretyng. So it is that diverse prelates / barons / knights
/ vnyuersites / comynaltes / and colleges / of the marches and lymitacyo^s of
the country of Gascone. And the dwellers and habitantes in the bonds of our
realm / beside diverse other of the duchy of Acquitayne / are drawn and are
come to our court / to have right of certain grefes and troubles unlawful /
y^ you by feeble counsel and simple informacion / have be^ in purpose to do to
them / of the which we have marueyle. Therefore to withstand and to remedy the
same matters / we are so co^ioyned to the^ that by our ryall magesty and
segnory. We command you to come into our cite of Paris in proper (...) son /
and there you to show and present before us in our chamber of our peers / and
there to do right on the foresaid complayntes and grefes moved by you to do on
your people / who claymeth to have their resort in to our court* and that this
be not failed / in as hasty wise as ye can / after the sight or herynge of
these letters. In wytnelse whereof to these presents we have set our seal /
given at Paris / the.xxv. day of January.

When the prince of Wales had reed this letter he had great marueyle / and
shoke his heed and beheld fersely ye frenchmen. And when he had a little
studied / he answered in this manner. ss we will gladly go to Paris to our uncle
/ sithe he has sent thus for us / but I assure you y^ shall be with bassenet
on our heed / and. l^. M. men in our company. Than the two frenchmen kneled
down / and said. Dear sir for goddessake take pacy^ce / and take not this
apell in so great dispyte / nor be not displeased with us. Sir we be messangers
sent by our lord the french king / to whom we must needs obey / as your
subgettes ought to obey you. Wherefore sir it behooves us to do his
commandment / and sir what soeuerye will give vs^ charge to say / we shall
she we it to the king our prince and lord. Nay (...) the price / sirs I am not
displeased with you / but with the^ that sent you hyder. And the kyngyomaister
is not well counseled / to co^poy^e him self with our subgettes / or to make
him self judge / where he has nothing to do / nor no manner of right. For it
shall be well showed / that at the rendering and puttyng in possessyon of ye king
my father into the duchy of Acquitayne / he quited all manner of resortes. For
all they that has caused this appele to be had agaynll me / has none other
resort of right / but into the court of England / before the king my dear
father. And or it shall be otherwise I ensure you / it shall cost a hundred
thousand men's lives. And therewith the prince departed and went to an other
chamber / and left the^ still there. Than knights of England came to them and
said. Sirs ^e may depart when yelyst to your logyng / ye have right well
aco^plysshed your message / but look for none other answer than ye have had.
Than the knight and the clerk departed / and went to their lodgyng and so
dyned. And after dy^er they trussed and mounted a horsbacke and departed fro
Burdeur / and took the way to Tholous ward / to thy^t^^ to show the duke of
An iou how they had spedde. The prince was sore dyspleased with this apele /
and so were all the knights about him: and they counsayled the prince yt the
two french messa^gers should have be s^ayne for their labor / but the prince
charged them the contrary: howbeit he had against them many a sore ymaginacyon.
And when it was showed him how they were deperted without any other license /
and yt they were rydden toward Tholous. Tha^ he called to him ser Thomas
Phelton / and the seneshall of Rouergne / sir Thomas of Pountchardone / sir
Thomas Percy / and his chancellor the bishop of Bale. Than the prince
demanded of them / if the french messangers had any save conducte of him or
not / and they answered they knew of none that they had. No has said the
prince and shoke his heed and said. It is not co^uenyent yt they should thus
lightly deperte out of our country and to make their ta^gelinges to ye duke of
an ^ou / who loves us but a lytell^ / he will be glad yt they have thus
somoned us i^ our own house. I trow all things co^sydred they be rather
messa^gers of mine own subgettes: as therle of Armynake / the lord Dalbret /
therle of Pyergort and therles of Comynges and Carmayne / than of y^ french
kings. Therefore because of the great dispite yt they have done to us / we would
they were over taken and put in prison. Of the which all the princes counsel
was right ioyouse and said / ser we fereye have tarried to long fro this
purpose. in co^tyne^t the seneshall of Dagenois was commanded to take with him
ser wyllm^ the monk a right good knight of England / and yt they should ride
after to stop ye messa^gers / and so they deperted and followed so long after
the^ yt at last they ouertok the^ in the land of Dagenois. and they arested
the^ and made an other occasyon than the prices commandment / for in their
arestyng they spoke no word of the prince: but said how their host / where as
they lay last compleyned on the^ / for a horse yt he said they had changed. The
knight and ye clerk had great marueyle of that tidings and excused themself
/ but their excuse could not avail. But so they were brought in to the city
of Dagen / and put in prison. And they let some of their pages depart / and
they went by the city of Tholous / and recorded to y^ duke of Aniou all the
hole matter / whereof he was nothing displeased / for he thought well y^ thereby
should begin war and hatred / and so he prepared covertly therefore. These
tidings came to y^ french king * for the pages went and recou^ted all the hole
matter to him / as they had herd and seen. Of the which the king was sore
displeased and took it in great dispyte* and took counsel and advise thereon.
And specially of the words y^ was showed him that the price should say * when
he said that he would come personally to his uncle to answer to the apell made
against him / with his bassenet on his heed / and.lx. M. men of war in his
company * against the which the french king made prouysion right subtelly and
wisely / for he thought well it was a weighty matter / to make war against the
king of England and his puyssance. Seeing how they had put his predecessors in
time past to somoche labor and travel Whefore he thought it a hard matter to
begin war / but he was so sore required of the great lords of Gascon and
Guyen: and also it was showed him what great extorcions and domages
thenglysshmen did daily / and were likely to do in time to come. He granted
to the war with an yuell will / co^sydring the destruction of y^ poor people
/ that he thought should ensue thereby.

How the duke of Berry and diverse other that were in hostage in England
returned into France. Ca. C Cxliiii.
SO against this ferse a^swere of the prince / the french king and his
counsel provided therefore privily. And in y^ same season returned into France
out of England duke John^ of Berry. The king of England gave him leave for a
hole year * but he bare himself so wisely that he never returned again / for
he made such excusacious and other means / that the war was opyn / as ye
shall herafter* also lord John^ Harcort was returned into his own country.
The king of England gave him leave to deperte / at the instance of sir Loys
Harcort his uncle / who was of Poyctou: and as than perteyning to the price /
who fell sick / the which was happy for him. For his sickness endured till
the war was newly begone: and so thereby he never returned again into England.
and Guy of Bloys / who was as than but a young squire and brother to therle of
Bloys / was fra^ke and fre delyuerd out of England / for when he perceived that
the french king / for who^e he lay in hostage did nothing for his delyuerance.
Than he fell in a treaty with the lord of Coucy / who had wedded the daughter
of the king of England / and he had yearly a great reuenewe out of the king of
Englandes cofers / because of his wife. And so there was such a treaty between
y^ king of England and his son^e in law / and sit Guy of Bloys: y^ by the
counsel of both brethren / lord John^ of Blois and sir Guy. and by the
agreement of the french king: they clearly resigned into the king of Englandes
hands / therldome of Soyssons / the which land the king of England gave to his
son in law the lord Coucy / for the which he did quyte him of.iiii. M. ^i. of
yearly revenues. Thus this covenant was made and engrosed / and sir Guy of
Bloys delivered. Also therle Peter of Alanson had leave of the king of Eng. to
return into France for a space / where he abod so long and found so many
excusacions yt he never returned after i hostage / howbeit I believe that
finally he paid.xxx. M. fra^kes for his aquytall. Also duke Loys of Burbone
was happy / who lay also in hostage in England / for by such grace as the
king of Engl. showed him / he was returned into France / and while he was at
Paris with the french king / the bishop of Wynchestre discessed / who was as
than chau^cellour of England. Than there was a priest about y^ king of England
called sir Wyllm^ Wycan / who was so great with the king * that all thing was
done by him / and without him nothing done, and so when the bysshoprike of
Wynchestre was void: Than the king of England by the desire of the said priest
/ wrote to y^ duke of Burbone / that he would for his sake make such suit to
the holy father pope Urbane / y^ his chapelayne might have y^ bysshoprike of
Wynchestre: promysing the duke in his so doing / to entreat him right curtesly
for his prisoume^t of hostage. When the duke of Burbone saw the king of
Englandes messa^gers and his letter * he was thereof right ioyouse: and showed
all the matter to the french king. Than the king cou^sayled him to go to the
pope for the same / and so he did. And departed and went to Auygnon to the
pope / who was not as than gone to Rome. and so the duke made his request to y^
pope / and he granted him / and gave him the bysshoprike of Wynchestre at his
pleasure / and was content: so that y^ king of England would be favorable to him
in y^ co^posycion for his delyuerance / that y^ foresaid Wy can should have the
said bysshoprike. And than the duke of Burbone returned into France and so into
England / and there treated with the king and his counsel for his delyuera^ce
/ or he would show his bulls fro the pope. The king loved so well this priest
that y^ duke of Burbone was delivered quyte / and paid.xx. M. frankes. And so
sir Wyllm^ Wy can was bishop of Wyn chester / and chancellor of England.
Thus the lords were delvuered that were hostages in England. Now let us
return to the wars of Gascoyne / the which began because of the appell that
ye have herd before.

How therle of Piergourt and vyco^t of Carmane / and the other barons of
Gascoyne disco^fyted the seneshall of Rouergne. Cap. C C.xlv.
VE have herd how the price of Wales took in great dispyte his somonyng that
was made to him to appear at Paris / and was in full inte^syon acordyng as he
had said to y^ messangers / to apere personally in France with a great army the
next somer. And sent incontinent to the^glysshe capitayns and gascons y^ were
of his acorde / such as were about the river of Loyre / desyring the^ not to
deperte far thens / for he said he trusted shortly to set the^ a warke. Of the
which tidings the most part of the co^panyons were right ioyouse: but so it
was the prince daily impered of a sickness y^ he had taken in Spain / whereof
his men were greatly dismayed / for he was in that case he might not ride Of the
which the french king was well informed / and had perfyte knowledge of all his
disease / so that the phicysions and surgions of France iuged his malady to be
a dropsy * and incurable. so after that sir Ca^ponell of Ca^ponall and the
clerk was taken and a rested by sir Wyllm^ the monk and put in prison in y^
castle of Dagen / as ye have herd before. The earl of Comynges / therle of
Piergort / the vycont of Carman sir Bertrm of Taude / the lord de la Barde /
and the lord of Pyncornet / who were in there own countries: took in great
dispyte the taking of the said messangers / for in the name of the^ and for
their cause / they went on this message / wherefore they thought to counterueng
it / and to opyn the war / and said so great dispyte is not to be suffered.
Than they understood that sir Thom^s Wake was ridyng to Rods to fortefy his
fortress / and should depart fro Dagenois with a.lx. spears. And when these
said lords knew thereof they were right ioyouse / and laid in a busshment a. C
C C. spears / to encou^tre sir Thom^s Wake and his company. Thus the said
seneshall rode with his lx. spears / and. C C. archers: and suddenly on the^
brake out this great enbusshment of gascoyns / whereof thenglysshmen were sore
abashed / for they thought little of this bushment. How be it they defended
themself as well as they might / but the frenchmen fersely assailed the^. And
so at the first metyng there were many cast to the earth / but finally
the^glyshmen could endure no ledger but were disco^fyted and stedde / and than
were many taken and slain / and sir Thom^s stedde or else he had been taken. And
so saved himself by the aid of his horse / and entered into the castle of
Mo^taubon: and the gascons and other returned into their countries and led
with the^ their prisoners and co^questes. Tidings anon was brought to the
prince / who was at y^ time in Angoleme how y^ his seneshall of Rouerne was
disconfyted by therle of Pyergort / and such other as had apeled him to y^
court of Paris / of y^ which he was right sore displeased / and said that it
should be derely reue^ged on the^ and on their lands / that had done him this
outrage. Than incontinent the prince wrote to sir John^ Cha^dos who was in
Co^stantyne at s. Savior le vycont / co^mau^dyng him inco^tynent after the
sight of his letters to come to him without any delay. And sir Johan Cha^dos who
would not disobey the prince hasted as much as he might to come to him / and so
came to Angoleme to the prince / who received him with great joy. Than the
prince sent him with certain men of arms and archers to y^ garyson of
Mo^tabon / to make war against the gascons and frenchmen / who daily increased
and over ran the princes land. Than sir Thomas Wake as soon as he might went to
Rods and refresshed and fortifyed newly the city. And also the town and
castle of Myllan / in the marchesse of * Mountpellyer / and in every place he
set archers and men of war. Sir John^ Cha^dos being at Mo^taubon to keep the
marches and fro^ters there against the frenchmen with such other barons and
knights as y^ price had sent thither with him: as the lord captall of Beutz the
two brethren of Pomyers / sir John^ and sir Hely / the Soldyche of Lestrade /
the lord of Partney / the lord of Pons / sir Loys of Harcourt * y^ lord of
Pyname / the lord of Tanyboton / sir Rich. of Pountchardon. These lords and
knights made often yssues on therle of Armynakes company / and on the lord
Dalbretes men / who kept the fronter there against them with the aid of therle
of Pyergourt / therle Comynges / the vycou^t of Carmane / the vycont of Tharyde
/ the lord de la Barde and diverse other / all of alyance and one affinyte.
Thus sometime the one perte wanne and sometime the other / as aduentur falls in
feats of arms. All this season the duke of Anioy lay still and styred not for
any thing that he herd / for his brother the french king commanded him in
no wise to make any war against the prince / till he were commanded otherwise
by him.

How in this season the french king drew to him certain capitayns of the
co^panyons / and how he sent his defyance to the kind of England. Cap.
CC.xlvi.
THe french king all this season secretly and subtelly had get to him diverse
capitayns of the companyons and other / and he sent the^ into the marches of
Berry and Auergne. The king consented that they should live there upon that
country / co^maundyng the^ to make no war till they were otherwise commanded
/ for the french king would not be known of the war / for thereby he thought
he should lose ye enterprice that he trusted to have in therldome of Poictou.
For if the king of England had perfetly known / that the french king would
have made him war / he would right well have wtstande the damage that he had
after in Poitou for he would so well a provided for ye good town of Abuyle
with englysshmen: and so well have furnysshed all other garysons in ye said
country / that he would have been still sovereign over the^. And the seneshall
of the same county was an englysshman / called sir Nycolas Louayng / who was
in good favor with the king of England / as he was worthy. For he was so
true: that to be drawn with wild horses / he would never consent to any shame
/ cowardnesse / or villainy. In the same season was sent into England / therle
of Salebruee / and sir Wyllm^ of Dorman fro the french king / to speak with ye
king of England and his counsel / she wyng to them how on their party ye
peace daily was but yuell kept / as well by reason of the war that the
co^panyons had made all this six year co^tynually in the realm of France / as
by diverse other accydentes / whereof the french king was informed: and not well
content therewith. The king of England caused these ambassadors to tarry still
in England the space of two months / and in the same space they declared
diverse artycles often times to the king / whereof ye king was sore displeased /
howbeit they set little there by / for they were charged by the french king and
his counsel to show it. And when the french king had secret and certain
knowledge how they within Abuyle would become french / and that the wars were
opyn in Gascone / and how all his people were ready aparelled / and in good
will to make war against the prince / and to enter in to the principalyte.
Howbeit he thought as than to have no reproach / nor in time to come to be said
of him / that he should send his people into the king of England or princes
land / or to take towns / cities / castles / or fortresses without defya^ce:
wherefore he was cou^selled to send to defy the king of England. And so he did
by his letters closed / and a breton varlet bare the^. And when he came to
Dover / there he found ye earl of Salebruce / and sir Wyllm^ of Dorman /
returnyng into France / and had aco^plysshed their message / to whom this
varlet declared perte of his message / and so he was commanded to do. And when
they herd yt / they deperted out of England as fast as they might and passed
the sea / and were right joyful when they were aryued at Bolen In the same
season the prince had sent to Rome to pope Urbane / sir Guysshard Da^gle for
diverse matters touching Aquitayne. And he found the pope right favorable in all
his suits / and so returned again: and by the way he herd how the gascoyns
and frenchmen made war against the prince / and how they ouerran the
pricipalyte whereof he was sore abashed and in fear how he might return
without danger. Howbeit he ca^e to the ge^tyll earl of Sauoy whom he found in
Pyemo^t in the town of Pyneroll / for he made war against the marquis of
Saluces. The earl of Sauoy received him ioyously and all his company / and kept
him two days and gave to them great gifts / and specially to sir Guysshard
Dangle / for therle greatly honored him because of his noble chinalry. And so
wha^ he was deperted and aproched nerer to the bonds of France and of Bolone
/ he herd ever tidings worse and worse to his purpose. So that he saw well in
yt case that he was in / he could not return into Guyen / he was to well
known. Therefore he gave the gouerna^ce of his company to a knight called ser
john^ I sore / who had wedded his dought / he was a good fre^chman: borne in ye
marches of breten. So he took on him the charge to conduct home his father in
laws company / and he went into the land of the lord of Beauieu / and there
he passed the river of Some. And there he acquyted him self so with the lord
of Beauieu / that he brought him and all his company to Ryon in Auuerne to the
duke of Berry / and there he offered to be good french as it was said / so that
he might be brought peasably to his own house into Bretayne. And his father in
law ser Guys shard Dangle / disgysed him self like a poor priest / yuell
horsed and arrayed: and so passed by France / the marchesse of Burgoyne and of
Auuerne. And did somoche with great pain that he entered into the pricipalyte
/ and came to Angoleme to the price / where he was right welcome: and another
knight that went with him to Rome / called sir Wyllm^ of Cens / for fear. As
he came homwarde he came to the abbey of Cluny in Burgone / and there tarried
more than five years after / and durst never go out of the house. And yet at
last he yielded hymsefe french. Now let us return to the breton y^ brought
the french kings defya^ce to ye king of England.

How the defyance was delivered to the king of England / and how the earl of
saint Poule and the lord of Chastellon / conquered therldome of Poictou. Cap.
CC.xlvii.
THis foresaid varlet did so much that he came to London / and understood how
ye king and his counsel was at Westminster / holding there a great counsel for
the princes wars / between him and the barons and knights of Gascone / to se
how it should be maynteyned: and what men should be sent out of England to aid
him. And than there came to them other new tidings / ye which made the^ to
have other business than they had before. For this french varlet did somoch
that he entered into the chamber where the king and his counsel was / and said
how he was a varlet sent by the french king / and had brought letters to the
king of England. And so kneled down to the king / and offered him the letters.
And the king who greatly desired to know what they meant: caused them to be
received opyned / and reed. Than the king and all his con^sayle had great
marvel thereof / when they understood the defyance / and beheld well the seal
and sigue: and saw clearly how it was of authorite. Than they caused the
varlet to depart / saying to him how he had right well done his message.
Wherefore he might depart when he would / he should have no let / and so he
returned as soon as he might. The same season there were still in England
hostagers / the earl Dolphyn of Auuergne / therle of Porseen / the lord of
Mallurer and diverse other who were in great heaviness of heart when they herd
those tidings / for they knew not what ye king would do with them. The king
and his counsel had great dispyte that a varlet should thus bring his
defya^ce / and said how it was nothing apertenant that the war between two
such great princes / as the king of England and the french king / should be
publysshed by a varlet. they thought it had been more metely y^ it should have been done by a prelat / or by some valya^t man baron or knight: how beit they
saw there was no remedy. Than they cou^sayled the king that incontinent he
should send a great army in to Poyctou / to keep the fronters there / and
specially to ye town of Abuyle / ye which was in great danger of lesyng. The
king was content so to do / and so there was appointed to go thither / the lord
Percy / the lord Neuyll / the lord of Carbeston / and sir Wyllm^ of Wynsore
with. CCC men / and. M. archers. And in the mean season while these lords made
them ready / and were come to Dover to pass the sea / there came other tidings
out of Poictou / ye which were nothing joyful. For as soon as therle Guy of s.
Poule / and sir Guy of Chastellon / who were as than masters of the crosbowes
of France / thought by all likelyhod / y^ the king of England was defied. Than
they drue toward Poictou / and had sent secretly their commandment to ye
knights and squiers of Artoyse / Heynalt / Cambresis / Uerma^dose / Uyen / and
Picardy yt they shuldes inco^tynent come to the^ / and so they did / to the
nombre of sixscore spears: and came to Abuyle. And they set upon the gates /
for it was so determined before / and so the men of war entered without doing
of any hurt / to any of the^ of the town. Tha^ sir Hew of Chastelon / who was
chief leder of these men of war / went straight where as he thought to find ye
seneshall of Poictou ser Nicolas Louayng / and did somoche y^ he found him /
and took him prisoner. Also they took a rich clerk and a valya^t man
tresourer of Poitou. So yt day the frenchmen took many a rich prisoner / and
thenglisshmen lost all that they had in the town of Abuyle. And ye same day
the fre^chemen ran to saint Ualery / and entered therein and took it and Crotay:
and also the town of Derne on the sea side. And anon after came ye earl of
saint Poule to the bridge of saint Remey / on the river of Sum / whereunto
there were certain englysshmen withdrawn. The earl assailed them / and there
was a great scrymysshe / and many noble deeds of arms done and atcheued. And
therle made knight there Galetan his eldest son / who did that day right
nobly / but thenglysshmen were there so sore assailed / that finally they were
disco^fyted / slain and takefie: and the bridge and forteresse also. And
brefely to speak / all the country and cou^tie of Poictou was clean delivered
fro thenglysshmen / so that none abode there to do any hurt to the country. The
tidings came to the king of England to London how they of Poyctou had
forsaken him / and were become french: Wherewith he was right sore displeased /
and had many a hard ymaginacyon against the hostagers of France / that were
still with him at London. How beit he thought it should be a great cruelty /
if he should bewreke his displeasur on them. yet he sent the burgesses of
cities and good towns of France / whom he had in hostage: into diverse towns
and fortresses in England / and kept the^ more strayter and harder than they
were kept before. And therle dolphyne of Auuergne / was raunsomed at.xxx.
thousand frankes / and therle Porseen at.x. thousand fra^kes / and the lord
of Roy was kept still in prison in great danger / for he was not well beloved
with the king of England / nor with none of his court. Wherefore it behooved
him to endure much sorrow and trouble / until such season as he was
delivered by great fortune and adventure: as ye shall here after in this
history.

How the king of England sent great nombre of men of arms in to the fronters
of Scotland / and how the duke of Berry and the duke of Aniou made their
somo^s / to go against the prince of wales. Cap. CC.xlviii.
When the king of England saw that he was thus defied by the french king /
and the cou^tie of Poictou lost / the which had cost him so much the repayring
of towns / castles / and houses / for he had spent thereon / a hundred
thousand frankes over and above the revenues thereof: and saw well how he
was lykely to have war on all parties. Also it was showed him / yt the scotts
were newly alyed with the french king / and were in purpose to make him war.
Whereof he was sore displeased / for he douted more the war of the scotts than
of the frenchmen / for he knew well the scotts loved him not / because of the
domages that he had done to the^ in time past. Than the king sentemen of war
to the fronters of Scotland: as to Berwyke / Rokesborowe / to Newcastell / and
into other places about ye fro^ters. Also he sent a great navy to the sea
about Hampton / Gernsey / and the isle of Wight / for it was showed him how
the french king had apparelled a great navy to go to the sea / and to come and
land in England: so yt he wist not on which part to take heed.. Thus
thenglysshmen were than sore abashed / because of this sudden war.

ANd as soon as the duke of Aniou / and the duke of Berry knew that the
defyance was made and the war opyn / they thought not than to sleep / but made
their special somo^s the one into Auuerne / and the other into Tholous / to
assemble and to make war into ye principalyte. The duke of Berry had ready at
his commandment all the barownes of Auuergne of the bysshoprike of Lion / and
of the bishop ryke of Mascon. Also he had the lord of Beauteu / the lord of
Uyllers / the lord of Tornon / sir Godfray of Boloyne / sir Johan of Armynacke
/ sir Johan of Uyllemure / the lord Mo^tague / the lord of Talenson / sir
Hugh Dolphyn / the lord of Rochfort / and diverse other. And inco^tynent all
these drew into Towrayn and into the marchesse of Berry: and began to make
sore war in the good country of Poyctou / but they found it well garnysshed
with men of war / both knights and squyers: so that they had there no great
advantage. And in the marchesse of Towrayne in the french garysons and
forteresses / there was sir Loyes of saint Julyan / sir Wyllyam of Bordes / and
Carnet breton. These three were companyons / and great capitayns of men of war
/ and they did feats of arms against thenglysshmen: as ye shall here after.

How the king of England sent the earl of Cambridge and the earl of Penbroke
to the prince his son / and how they passed by Bretayne. Capitulo. CC.xlix.
THe duke of Lancastre had by his enheritau^ce in Champayn a castle between
Troy and Chalons called Beauforte / Whereof an english squire (called
Purceuaunt Damors) was captain. And when this squier saw that the war was
open / bitwene the french king and the king of England: Than he turned
himself and became french / and swear from thens forth faith and alligeance
to the french king / who greatly rewarded him / and left him still captain
of the same castle / accompanied with another squier of Champayne called yuan.
So they.ii. were great companyons to gether and did after many feats to gether
against the englisshemen. And also the chanoyn of Robersart / who had always
ben before a good frencheman / all the renewyng of this war he became englissh
and did faith and homage to the king of England / who was right glad of his
service. Thus the knights and squiers turned their copies on both parts. And
the duke of Anion had so procured the companyo^s of Gascoyn / (...) ser
Perducas Dalbreth / the little Mechin / the Bourg of Bertueil / Aymon
Dortingue / Peter of Sauoy / Raff Bray / and Nandon of Pans that they became
all french / whereof the englisshmen were sore displeased / for their strength
daily lassed. And Na^don of Bagerant / the Bourg of Lespare / the Burg Camus /
ser Robert Briquet / Robert Thin / John^ Trenelle / Gailard dela mote / and
Aymery of Rochecho art abode still good English. And these companyons
englisshe and gascoyns / and other of their accord and affinite / abode in the
bysshopryke of Man's / and in base Normandy / and had taken a town called Uire
/ and distroyed all the country there about. Thus the companyons turned some
to the one part and some to the other so that they were all either englisshe
or french. Than the king of England was counsayled to send his son the
earl of Cambrydge / and the earl of Penbroke into the duchy of Acquitayne to
the prince / with a certain nombre of men of war / and so were named they
that should go with them in that voyage / as the lord of Tarbeston / ser Brian
Stapleton / sir Thomas Balestre / ser John^ Truues / and diverse other. They
entered as soon as they might into y^ see / and were in all.iiii. C. men of
arms / and.iiii. C. archers. And so they sailed toward Britayne and had wind
at will and arrived in the haven of saint Malo in the Isle. And when the duke
of Bretayne (ser John^ Mountford) knew that they were arrived in his country /
he was right joyous / and sent incontinent knights to receive them / as ser
John^ of Laigingay / and ser John^ Augustine. Of the coming of them / the earl
of Cambridge and the earl of Penbroke were right joyous: For they knew not
whether the lords / knights / and good towns of Bretayne would suffer them to
pass through the country or not. Than these said lords of England desired
the duke that they might pass. And the duke / who was favorable to
englisshemen and was loath to displease them / acorded to their request / that
they should pass through the country payeng for that they should take without
riot or grudge. Than the earl of Cambridge / and the earl of Penbroke / and
their company drew to the companyons / that were at the castle of Gontierland
at the town of Uire / and so took them forth with them / and passed the river
of ^oire at the Bridge of Na^tes without doing of any hurt to ye country. In
the same season sit Hugh Caurell with a great nombre of companyons in the
marches of Arragon / was newly come out of Spaigne / and as soon as he knew
that the frenchemen made war to the prince / he with his company passed
through Fo^^ and Arragon / and entered into Bigore / and so came to the prince
to the cite of Angolesme to whom the prince made great chere / and was glad
of him / and kept him still there till the companions were come out of Normandy
/ who had sold their fortresses to come to him. And as / soon as they were
come to Angolesme ye prince ordained ser Hugh Caurel to be their capitayn And
so he was than to the nombre of.ii. thousand fightyngemen. Than the prince
send them to the lands of the earl of Armynack and of the lord Dalbreth to
burn and exile the country. And so there they made great war / and did
much great damage to the country.

How the earl of Cambridge / and the earl of Penbroke arrived at Angolesine /
and how the prince sent the^ to ouerrenne the countye of Piergourt. Cap. CC.l.
THe earl of Cambridge and the earl of Penbroke / who were arrived at saint
Malo (as ye have hard before) and tarried there till all their company were
past by the agreement of the duke of Bretayne. And when they were well
refresshed there / they had leave to depart / and so went to Nantes: and there
the duke received them right honorably / and they tarried with him.iii. days /
and refresshed them and their people. The fourth day they passed over the great
river of Loyre at the bridge of Nantes / and rode so long by their iorneis yt
they came to Angolesme / where they found the prince and the princess. The
prince was right joyous of the coming of his brother the earl of Cambridge /
and of the earl of Penbroke / and demanded of them how the king his father /
and the queen his mother / and his other brethren did. And when they had
tarried there a.iii. days / than the prince sent them to make a journey into
the county of Piergourt And so these.ii. lords and their company made them
ready so to do and took leave of the prince and went forth in goodly array /
they were a.iii. M. fyghtyng men / by the help of diverse knights and squters
of Poictou Xainton Lymo syn Quercy and Rouergue. And so than these lords
entered into the cou^tie of Piergourt / and there they did many great domages.
And when they had burned and ouerran the most part of the country / they went
and laid siege to a fortress called Bourdeill / and there were.ii. squiers
brethren capitaynes within called Erualdon and Bernardyn of Batefoll / and
beside them in the county there were diverse good capitaynes the which the
earl of Piergourt had send thither to keep the garrisons and fortresses / the
which were right well provided fore both with artillarie / vitailes and other
things necessary to maynteyne and keep their places a long space. And also
they that were within were of good will so to do. Thus during the siege before
Bourdeill there were many feats of arms don and many a saute / many a
reculyng / and many a skrymysshe nere hand daily / for the.ii. squiers within
were right hardy and proud / and loved but little the englisshe men. and came
often times to the barriers and skrymysshedde with them without: and some day
wanne and some day lost / as the adventures of war often times falls /
now up now down. And on the other side in the marches of Aniou / and
Towrayne there were a. M. fighting men as well frenchemen as bretons /
bourgonyons / pycardes / normans / and angeuyns / and did aften times great
damage in the princis land / over whom were capitaynes sir John^ de Belle /
sir Wylliam of Bourdes / ser Loys of saint Julian^ and Carnet the Breton. And
against them there were men of war in the fronters of Poictou and Xainton /
as diverse knights of the princis / and specially sir Simon Burle and ser
Dangouse: how be it they had not the.iiii. part of the men that the frenchemen
had. for the frenchemen were a thousand fightyng men or mo / and the
englisshemen past not a two or three hundred at the most: for the prince had
sent a great nombre of his me^ into.iiii. armies / as to Mo^taban a.v. hundred
with ser John^ Cha^dos / and other companions in the lands of the earl of
Armynacke / and the lord Dalbreth: And also a great company with ser Hugh
Caurell: and the greattest company of all with his brother therle of Ca^bridge
to the siege of Bourdeil. Wherefore there were but few against the fre^chemen
in Poictou. How be it they acquitted themself right nobly / and did their
devour to keep the fronters and garrisons there / and never refused to fight and
to skrymysshe with the fre^chemen / though they were nothing like in nombre.
And so it was / on a day the frenchemen had certain knowledge / that the
englysshemen were a broad in the feldes / Whereof they were right joy full. and
so laid them self in a busshement as the englisshemen should return / who
were coming fro an enterprise that they had done between Mirebel and Lusignen.
And so at a broken way the frenchemen came out on them / and were to the no^bre
of.v. C. and ser John^ de Bueil and ser Wyllyam de Bourdes / ser Loys of saint
Julian / and Carnet the Breto^ were capitayns of that company: there was a sore
fight and many a man reuersed to the earth / for the englisshemen right hardely
fought / and valiantly defended them self as long as they might endure / ser
Simon Burle and ser Angouse proved y^ day noble knights: How be it finally it
auayled them nothing / for they were but a ha^dful of me^ as to regard the
french party. So they were discomfitted / and per force caused to flee / and
ser Angouse saved him self as well as he might / and entered into ye castle of
Lusignen. and ser Symo^ Burle was so sore pursewed / that he was taken prisoner
/ and all his company either taken or slain / but a few that skaped. And
than the fre^chemen returned into their garrisons right joyous of their
adventure / and in like wise was the french king when he herd thereof. and the
prince rightsore displeased / and sorowefull for the taking of ser Simon Burle
/ whom he loved entierly / and had good reason and cause so to do / for he had
ever ben a right noble and a coragious knight / and had always right valyantly
borne him self / in the susteynynge of the king of Englandes part: and so
had be^ all the other companyons / that were slain and taken at that skrymysshe
/ whereof ye prince and al they of his part were right sorrowful / The which
was no marvel / for it is commonly said that one is worth a. C. and a. C. is
not worth one / And truly sometime it fortuneth / that by one man a hole
country is saved by his wit and prowes / and by a another a hole country
lo^^. Thus the fortune and chances of the world often times falls.

How sir John^ Cha^dos took Tarriers / and how the earl of Piergourt and
diverse oath knights besieged Riamulle in Quercy. Ca. CC.li.
AFter this adventure that thus fell bitwene Mirebel and Lusigne^ (as ye have
herd before) the englissheme^ and their companyons rode more wiselier together.
And now letvs speak of ser John^ Chandos / and ser Guysshard Dangle / and
their companies / who were at Mo^taban a.vii. leages from Toulouse / and made
many horrible enterpryses / and when they saw they had layne there a long
space / and thought they had not enployed well their season / except in keeping
of the fro^ters. therefore they determined to go and lay siege to Tarriers in
Tholousayn / and so they prepared all thing ready and departed fro Mo^taban /
and went to Tarriers and besieged it round about. And they perceived well how
they could not geat it by noassaute / nor none other ways at their ease /
without it were by mynynge / than they set their mynours a warke / who
atcheued their warke so well / that on the (...) day after they took and entered
into ye town and all they within slain / and the town robbed and spoiled.
And in the same journey they had thought to have taken another town a. iii
leages from Toulouse called Lauall: and had laid a busshement there by in a
Wodde. And than a.xl. of them covertly armed under the ha bytes of villaynes of
the country were going to the town / but they were disceyued by a villayne
boy that was a foot in their company / he discovered their enterprise / and
so they failed of their intent / and returned again to Mo^taban. In the same
season there was abroad in the feldes the earl of Piergourt / therle of
Comynges / the earl of Lisle / the Uicount of Carmayn / the Uicount of Brunikel
/ the Uicount of Lautre / ser Bertram of Tharide / the lord de la Barde / the
lord of Pincornet / ser Perducas Dalbreth / the Bourge of Lespare the Bourge
of Bertueill / Ayemon Dortingue / Jaquet de Bray / Perrot of Sauoy / and
Arnolde of Pans / and they were to the nombre of.x. M. and they entered into
Quercy / by the commandment of the duke of Aniou / who was as than in the
cite of Toulouse / and they brought that land into great tribulacion / and
brent and exyled the country: and than they came to Riamulle in Quercy / and
besieged the town / but the seneschall of Quercy had well provided for the
town in all manner of things / and had therein many good englisshe men / the
which would not yield up ye town to dye therefore / how be it they of ye town
would gladly have given it up. Than the lords and knights of France sent
for.iiii. great engines to the cite of Toulouse / and when they were come they
were dressed and reised up / and they cast night and day stones and great
pieces of timber into ye fortress / and beside that they set mynours a warke /
who made their boste to win the town breuely. And always the englysshemen
within like noble and valiant men comforted each other and set but little by
their mynynge.

How the archebysshopp^ of Toulouse converted to the french king by his
prayer and request the city of Caoure and diverse other towns / and how the
duke of Guerles / and the duke of Julliers defied the french king. Cap. CC.lii.
IN the mean season while these french knights were thus in Quercy / in the
marches of Lymosyn / and Auuergne the duke of Betrey was in Auuergne with a
great nombre of men of war as sir John^ of Armynac his uncle / the lord
John^ of Uillemur / Roger of Beaufort / the lord of Beauiew / the lord of
Uillers / the lord of Sergnac / the lord of Cale^con / ser Griffith of
Mo^tague / and sir Hugh Dolphin / with a great nombre of other good knights
and squiers / and so they ouerran the marches of Rouergue / of Quercy / and of
Lymosyn / and did great damage and enpouerysshed greatly the country for
nothing held against them / and so by the means of the duke of Berrey the
archebysshop departed out of Toulouse / who Was a right good clerk and went to
Caours / where of his brother was bysshopp^. and there he preched and publysshed
in such wise the french kyngis quarrel / that by his means the city of
Caours turned french / and swear faith and homage from thence forth to the
french king. Than the said archebisshop rode forth further and preched and
declared the French kings right / title / and quarrel in / such wise that all the country became french / he caused to turn mo than.lx. towns / cities /
castelles / and fortresses / by the help and aid of the duke of Berreys
company of men of war / as sir John^ of Armi nake and other / who rode abroad
in the country they caused to turn french Sigac / Gaignac / capedonac / and
diverse other good towns and strong castelles. For he preched that the french
king had so great right and just cause in his quarrel / that the people that
hard him believed him. And also naturally ye people were in their minds rather
french than englisshe ye which helped much to the matter. In like manner as
this archebysshop went about prechynge and showing the right and quarrel of the
french king in the bonds and lymitacions of Languedoc / there were in Pycardy
diverse other prelates and clerks who well and sufficiently did their deuours
to show and to preche the said quarrel of the french king to the common people
of cities and good towns: and specially sir Wyllia^ of ^ormans preched the
said quarrel fro cite to city / and fro town to town / so wisely and so
notably that all that hard him lent them self to his opinion / so that the
business of the realm was by him and by his words so colored that it was
marnayle to speak thereof. And beside that the french king him self was so
moved with devotion / that he caused to be made contynual processions by the
clergy / and him self and the queen would go bare foot requyrynge and
besechynge god deuoutely to assist and mainteyne ye right of the realm of
France the which has been a season in great tribulacion. And also the king
caused all his subjects by the constreynte of the prelates to do the same. In
like manner did the king of England in his realm. There was a bishop that
time at London / who made many prechynges and declaracions / showing the people
that the french king by great wrong had renewed the war: And that he did
was agayngste right and good reason / and that he proved by diverse artycles and
points openely showed. to say troth it was of necessite / that both kings /
sith they were determined to make war / to show to their people the order
and cause of their quarelles / so that they might with the better wyls help
and aid their lords / of the which they were all awakened both in the one
realm and other. The king of England sent into Brabant and Haynault to know
if he might geat any aid there / and desired duke Aulbert / who had in rule
and governance the county of Heynault at that time / that he would open his
country to suffer him to go and come / and to abide there if need were / and
that way to pass into the realm of France with his army. The duke Aulbert at
the request of the king of England his uncle / and at the desire of ye queen
his au^te lightly condyscended to their desires / by the aid and good mocyon
of Edward Duke of Guerles / who was of the king of Englandes part. For he
wedded the dukes daughter / and by the duke of Julyers his cousyn germayne.
These two at that time were in faith and homage bound to the king of England
/ by whom they were desired that they should retaygne each of them the nombre
of a thousand spears at his cost and charge / Wherefore these.ii. lords
aduysed well that it should be good for the king of England / to geatte alied
to him the duke Aulbert: Who was sore tempted thereto by them / and by great
gifts that the king of England promised him by such knights as he had
sent unto him. But When the lord of Comynges (who was about the french
king) herd thereof / he returned into Heynaulte / and by the counsel of the
lord John^ Werthyn s^ neschall of Heynaulte / by whom all the country was
most governed / and was a wise and a valiant knight / and was good french in
heart he was so well beloved with ye duke and duchess that he brake the purpose
of the englisshe messa^gers / for by the help of therle of Bloys / and of ser
John^ of Bloys his brother / the lord Ligny / and of the lord Barba^son the
duke and all his country abode as neuter / and held with none of both parts.
And this answer made Jane duchess of Brabant. King Charles of France who was
sage / wise / and subtyle / had wrought about this treaty.iii. year before /
and knew well he had good friends in Heynault and Brabant / and specially the
most part of the cou^sailours of ye great lords / and to color / and to make
his war seem ye fayrer / he copied out diverse letters touching the peace
confirmed at Calays / and there in he closed the substan^ce of his deed / and
what thing the king of England and his children were sworn to keep. and in
what articles by their letters sealed they were submytted to make renu^ciacions
/ resityng such co^myssions as they ought to have delivered to their people /
and al other articles and points that made any thing for him and his quarrel
condempnynge the englisshemens deades. These letters the king caused to be
publysshed in the courts of great lords / to the intent they should be better
informed of his quarrel. Inlyke wise opposite to this deed the king of England
showed his quarrel in Almaygne / and in other places / where as he thought to
have any aid. The duke of Guerles nephewe to the king of England / son to
his suster / and the duke of Juliers cosyn germayne to his children / who were
at that time good and true english / had great dispight of the defiaunce that
the french king had made to ye king of England done by a varlet / in their
minds greatly blaming the french king and his counsel in his so doing.
for they said that war bitwene so great princis (as the french king and the
king of England) ought to be publysshed and defied by notable persons / as
prelates bishops or abbottes / saying how the french men did it by great
presumpcyon and pride. Wherefore they said they would send and defye the french
king notably / and so they did / and diverse other knights of Almayne with
them. and their ente^tes was shortly to enter into France / and there to do
such deeds of arms / that the remembrance thereof should be seen and
known.xx. year after. How be it they did nothing / for their purpose was
broken by another way than they thought of / as ye shall here after in this
history.

How the duke of Bourgoyn was married to the daughter of the earl of Flaunders.
Cap. CC.liii.
VE have hard before how ye space of.v. year to gether ye king of Eng^. made
much purchase to have the daughter of therle of Fla^ders to have been married to
his son Edmond earl of Cambridge. The devises and ordenances were to long to
rehearse. Wherefore I will pass it over breuely. The king of England could by
no manner geat pope Urban to consent to give them a dispensacion to mary / and
the earl of Fraunders was sued unto fro other parts / and specially by the
french king / for his brother the duke of Bourgoyn. Wha^ he saw that the
marriage Would not take in England / and how it was time for his daughter to be
married / and that he had no mo children / and thought that the yo^ge duke of
Bourgoyn was a mete marriage for her: Than he sent certain messangers into
England / to treat with the king for acquitaunce / and the messangers did so
well their devour / that the king of England (who thought none evil) quited
the earl of Flaunders of all his couenauntes / as touching ye marriage of his
daughter. and so these messangers returned to Bruges / and showed the earl
their lord how they had spedde / Where of he was right joyful. And it was not
long after but that the marriage of the duke of Bourgoyn and their earls
daughter was driven through and agreed. And it was showed me that for this
marriage the earl of Flaunders had more than fyfty thousand frankes / and the
town of Doway and Lisle delivered in gage for money / yt the french king
gave with this marriage to the earl of Flaunders / Who took possessyon of them /
and therein did put his people. And so these two towns were attributed to
Flanders by reason of gage / as it was showed me / I can say no further. And
anon after this composicion they proceeded to the marriage / the which was done
and confirmed in the town of Gau^t and there was great feast and solempnyte
the day of ye marriage and after. There were many lords / barons / and knights
/ and specially ye gentyl lord of Coucy / who was sent thither by the french
king / every man was greatly feasted with great iustes and tryumphes. And
after every man wense Whom to his own. And when the king of England saw
that the earl of Flaunders / because of this said marriage was alyed into
France / he wyste ^at What to suppose / Whether that the Earl of Flaunders
would take part against him with the duke of Bourgoyne his son in law / who
by succession should be his heir after his disceace ornat. Nor also he myste
not what rou^nauntes were (...) b^twene the french king and the earl of
Flaunders. Wherefore the king of England was more harder to the Flemmynges
than he was before / both by land and by see / as they came in merchandise.
Whereof the french king was nothing displeased. for he would gladly that the
War had been open bitwene the englisshemen and fle^mynges. How be it the
wise men of Flaunders and bourgesses of good tow ^es had no will to ye war:
for the comynalte of Flaunders / sustained rather the opinion and quarrel of
the king of England to be better / than the french kings. The king of
England / who sought for friends in all parties / as ^ede was for him so to do
/ seeing the great wars and rebellions that daily rose against him. than he
understood well that king Charles of Nauarr his cosyn / who was in base Nor
mandy / would soon agree to his accord / for he was behated with the french
king / because of certain lands that he kept / and claymed them as his
enheritance / the which the french king d^n^ed: for the which their
counsayles had been often times to guether: But they could never make agreement
bitwene them / and so the mat^er hanged still / each of them taking good head
of other. And the king of Navarre fortifyed greatly his towns and castles in
Constantine and in the county of Deureur / and in the good towns of Normandye
/ and held himself at Ch^erburge and had men of war in every garrison. And
with him there was ser Eustace Da^^^er^court who was governor of a town
be^oud the passage of saint Clement / in the close of Constantyne / the which
perteyned to the king of Navarre / for it was parcel of his he^^age / called
the town of Carentyn. And this sir ^ustace was chief of the kings counsel
and the king of England sent unto him (for he was also hisman and knight) to
the intent that he should know the king of Nauarres mv^de. And this knight
did so much that the king of Navarre with a pr^uy company entered into a
ship called Ly^ / and came to the king of England / who made him great there
and feast / and so they were long to gether / and finally concluded / that as
soon as the king of Navarre were returned to Chierbourge / he should send
and defye the french king / and to put in all his castelles and fortresses
englisshe men. And when all this was confyrmed / the king of Navarre departed
/ and returned again into Normandy / to the town of Chierbourge / and was
brought thither by certain knights of England / who had but euyllfortune at
their returning home ward / for on the sea they met normans and pirates /
Who fiercely assailed them / and were far stronger than the englisshmen. So
the normans conquered them and slew them all / they would not take one to
mercy / of the which adventure the king of England was right sore
displeased. how be it he could not remedy it. And anon after y^ the king of
Navarre was returned to Chierbourge / ser Eustace Dambreticourt (who was sent
for by the prince) took leave of ye king of Nauarr to go and serve the prince.
the which king gave him leave / sore against hysmyll. How be it ser Eustace
showed him so many reasonable causes / that at last he departed and took the sea / and arrived with all his company at saint Malo / and rode to Nauntes / to
pass there the river of Loyre by the agreement of the duke of Bretayne / Who as
than stered not on no party. And so sir Eustace trauayled so long / that he
came in to Poictou / and came to the town of Angolesme to the prince / who
received him with great joy / and tha^ anon sent him to sir John^ Chandos /
and to the Captal of Beu^ / who were at Montaban making there thyr fronter
against the french men / And thither sir Eustace was right well come to all
the company.

How the constable of France / and the constable of Heynaulte raised all army
of men of war to assail Arde and how the fortress of Reainuille was taken
and the englysshemenne slain. Cap. C C.liiii.
IN the same season the knights of Pycardye assembled together to go and
assaute Arde / and sir Mores Fyennes Constable of France / and sir John^ Uertyn
constable of Heynau^^ were capitaynes of that company by the commandment of
the French king / and they assembled to guether in the town of saint ^mer /
and they were a thousand spear^s of knights and squyers. And so they went and
mostred before the bastid of Arde / the which was well furnysshed with
english men / and so the french men said they Would lay s^ege thereto. And
the english men were no thing abashed / but made them ready to defend their
fortress / if need were. And on a day / all the frenchemen and heynowes
assembled together in y^ field / in good array and fresshe mauer. it was a
goodly sight to behold the baners and standards wauynge with the wind / and
so they gave assaute to the town / not greatly to their profyt / for there
were diverse of them sore hurt and wounded / and conquered nothing. And as it
was showed me / on the syft day they beparted fro Arde Without doing of any
great hurt / and so returned every man home to his own house. Thus brake up
that i^urney.

How let us speak of farther countries / as of the siege / that was before
^iamuille in Quercy / laid by the frenchemen / who were a.xii. thousand
fyghtyngemen / with the companyons that were in their felawes^^ppe / and within
two days journey of them lay the duke of Berreys company / as sir John^ of
Armynake sir John^ Uillemure / the lord of Beau^ew / and other of Auuergne and
Bourgoyne / and they were well a.iii. thousand which were ready to come to the
siege if need were to assy^te the frenchemen. And sir John^ Chandos / the
Captall of Beufz / sir Guysshard Dangle / and other englysshemen that kept the
fronter about Montaban / knew well how the frenchemen had laid siege
before Reainuille / and what nombre they Were of / So that they saw Well they
were not able to fight with themnor reyse the siege. For the earl of Cambridge
and the Earl of Penbroke / Who lay at siege before Bourd^^lf / would ^^no wise
break up their siege. And so the frenchemen before Reainuille set they^
myners awarke / and also they had engyns / that did cast day and night. The
myners caused a great pain of the Wall ^o salle / Whereby the town Was taken
/ and all the englysshemen Within slain without mercy / the Which Was great
pitye: Forthere in was many a good squire. They of the nation of the town were
taken tomercy / o^ the coudicio^ that fro thence forth they should ^e good
(...) frenchemen. Than they ma^^ there new capitaynes and officers to keep the
town if need were. Than these men of war departed and went abroad into the
con^trey of ^uercy and Rouergue / to refresshe them / and to lie more at their
case. And the companyons went to the city of Caours / and there about / and
capitaynes of them were Aymon of ^rtingo Pecotte of Sauoye / the little Mechin
/ Jaques Braye / Arnolde of Pans. And they ouerranne and distroyed all the
country. And the earl of Pierregourt / the earl of Lisle / the earl of
Comynges / the U^count of Carmayn / and the other lords returned into
theyrowne countries / For sir Hugh Caurell / sir Robert Brequet / Joh^i
Tresnelle / Lanut Nandon of Bergerat the Bourge Camus / the Bourge of Bretueil
/ the Bourge of Lespare / and the nombre of companyons made great War / and
burned and distroyed the lands of the earl of Armynacke / and of the lord
Dalbreth. In the same season there was a seneschall in Rouergue a right
valiant man and a good english knight / called sir Thomas Witeualle / Who
kept the town and Castelle of Millan a days iou^ney fro Montpellier / how
be it the country all about him was turned french / yet he kept his
fortress a year and a half after. And also an other fortress in Bretayne
called Wanclere / In the Which space he made many noble Issues / unto the time
that sir Bertram of Clesquy put him out / as ye shall here after in this
history / And all Ways still / the siege endured before Bourdeilf.

How the seneschal of Poictou bu^ned and exyled the land of the lord of
Chauuigny / and took with asaute the town of Breuse the which was newely
before turned french. Capitulo. C C.lv.
IN the marches of po^tou was sir John^ of Bue^syr Wyllyam of Bourdes ser Loys
of saint Julyan Carnet Breto^ / and ^o than. ^ii. hundred fightyng men / they
imagined and studied night and day how they might geat by assaute / skaynge /
or other wise towns and fortresses in Poictou. And on a day they gatte by
slelth and by skalynge the castle called the Roche of Posay at the enter of
Poictou on ye river of Creuse a two leages fro Hay in Tourayn / and nere to
Chatellerault on the same river / all the country of Poictou was in great
fear for the frenchemen laid there a great garrison and repaired the castle /
and fortyfyed and furnysshed it with artillarie and victayles. And when these
tidings came to the prince he was sore displeased but he could not amend it.
Than he sent to ser Guyssharde Dangle / ser Loys of Harecourte / the lord of
Parteney / the lord of Pinane / and for diverse other being at Montaban with
ser John^ Chandos / that they should come to him / for he was in purpose to
send them into other places. And according to the princis co^mau^dment they
departed fro Montaban / and came to Angolesme to the prince / and incontinent
he sent them into Poicters to keep the city / and to make fronter there
against the fre^chemen / and about the same time a great baron of Poictou the
lord of Chauuigny vicount of Breuse forsook the english part and became
french / and the town also / and furnysshed the town With bretons and men of
war / and went himself in to France to the king. Of this adventure the
prince and all the barons of Poictou Were sore displeased / and the vicount of
Rochecoart was had insuspecte: for it was enfourmed the prince how he would
turn french. Wherefore the prince sent for him and showed him his intent / and
the vicount excused him self as well as he might: How be it he was committed
to prison / and so abode a long space in that danger. The same season the
great seneschall of Poictou (under the prince) was ser James Audeley a right
sage and a valiant knight and he assembled to gether a great army of barons
and knights of Poictou / and with him was sir Guysshard Dangle / ser Loys of
Harecourt / the lord of Pons / the lord of Parteney / the lord of Pinane /
ser Geffey Dargenton / ser Maubrun of L(...)ers the lord of Tannaybouton / ser
William of Moutaudire and diverse other knights and squiers of Poictou / they
were a.xii. C. spears. And also there was with him ser Band wynsenesch all of
Xainton. These lords made their assembly at Poicters / and so departed in good
arraye / and rode till they came into Berrey / than they began to burn and
exile the country / and did many great domages. and than they went ito
Tourayn: but where soever they went the country was sore turme^ted and brought
into great tribulacion: they were so strong that they kept still the field.
and at last they entered into the lord of Chauuignys country / Who was as than
newly turned to the french part. and so they burned and distroyed all that
was before them / except the fortresses. And on a day they came before the
town of Breuse and gave thereto assaute / the which endured a hole day / but
that day they won but little. Than they withdrewe / and lodged them / and
said how they would not departso. for they thought well the town was
preignable. Than they rose at the spring of the day / and sowned their
trompettes to the assaute / and so approached the town every lord in good
arraye under his own baner / the which was on a saturday. This was a fires
assaute / for they within the town defended them self as well as they might /
they knew well it stood them in ieoperdy of their lives. So there was done that
day many a noble feat of arms the english archers shot so holly to gether
/ that none durst look out at any loope to defend the town / and so finally
by pure force ye town was wo^ne / and the gates cast down / and euer^ man
entered that would / and a.xvi. of the best yt were within / Were taken and
hanged in their harneis in dispight of the vicou^t their master / who was so
falsely become french / and ye town burned / and all the inhabitauntes within
lost all that ever they had / and many slain and drowned. Than the
englysshemen returned to Poicters to refresshe them self there.

How sir Robert Canol was made master governor of the princis company / and
how sir Perducas Dalbreth turned englisshe. Cap. CC.lvi.
SIr Robert Canol^ / who was as than in Bretayne / and had there a fair
heritage / and always he had been good englisshe and loved and served the king
of England and his sone / and had been with them in diverse iourneis. And when he
understood that the fre^chemen made the Prince so great war / and Would
dysheryte him of his enherytaunce of Acquytayne / At the conquerynge whereof he
had been before / was sore dyspleased therewith in his mind / and pourposed
to assemble to guether such people as he might / and to go and serve the
prince at his own cost and charge. As he ymagyned / so he did / he gatte to
gether of his friends and other the nombre of.lx. men of arms / and as many
archers / And than he prepared a four ships in an haven of Bretayne called
Kaouke. And when all his prouysion was ready / he departed from Deruall and drew
to the port and took the sea with his company / and sailed so long that they
arrived at the Kaye of Rochell / and the bourgesses of Rochel^ made him good
chere against their hearts: How be it they durstedo none otherwise. And there
he found sir John^ Deureux captain of Rochel^ under the prince / for the
Seneschall was with sir John^ Chandos and sir Thomas Percy. There sir Roberte
Canol^ was well received / and the captain kept him good company. And there
he tarried.ii. days and than rode forth till he came to Angolesme and the
prince and princess were right glad of his coming / and made him such chere
that the prince made him master and chyef soueraygne of all the knights and
squyers of his court / because of his valor and noble chyualrie /
commaundynge all his court to obbey him as their soueraygne / and they all
answered that they were well content so to do. And when he had been there the
space of five days and every man ready that should go with him. than he took
leave of the prince / and departed fro An golesme acompanyed with the princes
knights / as sir Richard of Pontchardon / ser Stephyn Gosenton / sir
Dagloiret / sir Noel Lorniche / sir Wyllyam Torciel sir Hugh Hastinges / sir
John^ Trivet / sir Thomas Spenser sir Tancon / sir Thomas Balaster / sir
Nicolas Bond / sir wyllyam the Monk / the seneschall of Agenoys / sir Baudwyn
of Franuille and mo than three score knights. So they were a.lx. men of arms /
and five hundred archers / and as many brigantes / all having good myudes to
find out the frenchemen / and to fight with them. Thus sir Robert Canol^ and
his company rode forth toward Again to come into Quercy / where the
companyo^s were / and they rode so long that they came to the city of Again:
and there they tarried a little space to refresshe them self and to abide their
eunemies. And in the same season sir Robert Canoll had knowledge how sir
Perducas Dalbreth who was captain of a certain nombre of companyons / as
a.iii. C. or there about / and that he was the same season in the country /
and that by the purchase of the duke of Aniou he was turned french. Than sir
Robert Canoll sent certain herauldes and messangers to him / and gave him
salve conducte to come and speak with him in the feldes / at a certain place
lymytted / and so he came to him / and sir Roberte made him great chere / and
so little and little fell together in talking / than sir Robert Canol showed
him / how it was greatly to his blame to turn him self french / and to
forsake to serve the prince / who so well has honored and loved him in time
paste. Whereto should I make long process / sir Robert Canol^ preched so much
to ser Perducas Dalbreth that he turned again and became englisshe / he and all
his company / and with him there turned of the companyons gascoynes mo than.v.
C. Whereof the duke of Aniou was sore displeased / and thought than the less
surete in the said sir Perducas. These tidings came to the city of Caours to
the co^panio^s there. as Aymon Ortigo / the little Mechin / Jaques Bray / Perot
of Sauoy / Arnolde of Pans / who were there to keep the garyson of the which
tidings they were sore troubled in their minds / and considered and thought
well that there garrison was to great and feeble to be kept against the
puyssaunce of the englisshe men. And so departed thence and gave up the town
to the bishop and bourgesses of ye same and they went to a priory there by
called Durmel / the which they had fortified before and determ^^ed to keep it
against their enemies. And as soon as the english men knew that they were
there: they came thither and besieged the place / and made many assaute but they
within were so well fortified with artillary and other ablementes of war /
that they took but litell hurt. And when ser John^ Chandos ser Thomas Phelton /
the captall of Beufz / ser John^ Po^mers / ser Thomas Percy / ser Eustace
Dambreticourt / and the other knights of the princis / who were at Montaban
understood how ser Robert Canol^ had besieged the fortress of Durmell / tha^
they determined to go thither / for there they thought to enploy well their
season: and so they departed fro Montaban mo than.iii. C. spears and left.ii.
C. behind to keep the garrison / of whom were capitayns ser Aymery of Charters
/ the Souldiche of Lestrade / ser Bernarde Dalbreth / and the lord of Geronde.
So the above said lords rode spedely to come to the siege of Durmell. and as
they rode they found by the way a strong french town called Monsac / ye
which was kept alonly by them of ye town / but y^ knew not they. and so to
advise ye town they sent forth their courrours / and they brought word
again y^ the town was very strong / so that without siege or saute it would
not be wo^ne Than they took counsel to gether to se what was best for them to
do and so determined that it was not best for them to let their enterprise. of
guyng to Durmell / wherefore they passed by yerly in the morning. and they were
not gone a leage thence but they met certain men with four summers laden with
vitayle / whom anon they took and rested / and demanded fro whens they came /
and whyther they would: they said they were departed from Toulouse to the
intent to go to Monsac / And to bring thither their victayle. Than they were
straytlyer examyned of the state of the town / and what people were within.
And they who were afraid to (...) for fear of their lives) showed how the
town lacked victayle / for they had not vitayle enough (...) the twone to
abide a siege the space ^^fo^^e days and how there was never a ge^cylman of
name nor man of War within the town save all only the dwellers within. Tha^
they drew to counsel again / and utterly determined that they would go no
farther till they had assayed to geat the said town of Monsac. And so
returned again / and took the ^ictayle for themself / and delivered the
horses again to the vitailers and badde them go and seek for new prouisyon.
And than went and laid siege about Monsac and harbored themself / as though
they would not go thence in a month / and made semblant to assaute ye town
the next day / and laid such artyllarie as they had against the Walls. And
when they with(...) town saw that / they were afraid / and knew well they
could not long endure / because of lack of victayle. Than they began to
treat with the english knights / and finally they knoweledged the prince of
Wales to be their lord / and to keep and hold the town of ^ym for ever fro
thence forth / without fraud or (...) ^^gyn / so that they might sytte still
in rest and nothing of theyrs taken from them. Than ser John^ Chandos and his
company at the request of them of the town ordained for them a captain a
knight called sir Roberte Mytton and twenty men of arms with him and forty
archers at the costs and wages of them of the town. Than they rode forth
till they came to Durmell where as ser Robert Ca(...) and his company lay at
siege / and there each made to other great chere and feast and tokens of love
/ and so than they lay all at the siege in good order.

How sir Robert Canol and sir John^ Chandos departed fro Durmell without
wynnyng of it / and went and laid siege to the garyson of Do^me Cap. CC.lvii.
WHile this siege thus endured before Durmelle / there were many skrymysshes
and deeds of arms done / for there Were many good knights and men of arms
without / and within were good men of war / well expierte and used therein /
orels they could not have endured half so long as they did. They that lay at
siege without had no great advantage / For they were in worse case than they
within / for.ii. causes. The one / it rayned day and night / the which was
evil both for men and horses. The other was defaute of vitayles / so that they
wist not what to eat / a loffe of bread was worth.iii. old grotes. and yet
worse than that / sometime they could geat none for money. How be it often
times they had plentye of Wynes the Which did them great comfort. So in
this case they Were a five wekes. and finally when they saw they could Win
nothing there / because the garyson Was so strong / and that they lay there
in so great Jeopardye and disease: they determined to depart thence / and so
they did / and drew them to the Castle and town of Do^me / the Which
stood in a more plentyfull country / and so besieged the garyson. And Within
was Captain / lord / and governor sir Robert of Do^me / and with him a
cosyn of his called sir Peter Sanglette / and they had geat in to the fortress
all the victayle that was abroad in the country about them. And When the
Englysshemen and Gascoynes Who Were to the noumbre of fyftene houndred men of
arms: and two thousand archers and brygauntes had thus laid siege to the
fortress / assauted the place courageously / and reised up diverse great
engyns / so that daily there Were sautes and skrymysshes / and many feats of
arms acheued. And When they had layen thus at siege the space of fyftene
days / and saw they gatte nor conquered nothing there. And that they lay
there in great pain and travail. Than they took advise and counsel and
concluded to send word to Angolesme to the prince certifieng him of their
estate / and Chandos the heraulde was commanded to go on that message / and so
he did so much that he come to the prince / who had tha^ about him but a small
company / for all his knights and squyers were out one way or other in war.
When the heraulde came before the prince / he kneled down / and reco^mended to
him all ye knights and squiers that he had left at siege before Do^me and there
sagely and discretly he declared to the prince the state and ordinance of them
at siege / and also delivered to the prince letters of credence. And when the
prince had well understand all the matter / he said he would take advise in the
matter / and caused ye herald to abide there v. days / and on ye.vi. day he
delivered to him letters sealed under his own seal / and said at his
departing / Chandos reco^maunde us to all the company there. And so departed and
took his way toward Quercy. Now let us speak of them of the ^oste / how they
did in the mean season / that this heraulde went and came on their message.

How sir Robert Canol and sir John^ Chandos departed fro Do^me without any
hurt doing there / and went and took Gauaches / Rochemandor / and diverse other
towns / the which wet newly turned french. Ca. CC.lviii.
Anon after that Cha^dos the heraulde was departed on his message fro ye oste
ser John^ Chandos and ser Roberte Canoll / sir Thomas Phelto^ / ye Captall of
Beufz ser James Audeley / and the other knights and squiers went to counsel
and concluded to break up their siege / for they perceived well how they could
geat nothing there / and determined to go further into ye country / and to win towns and garrisons such as were newly turned french / by the exhortyng
of the duke of Berrey. So thus these knights dislodged / and departed fro
Do^me / and went to Gauaches / the which incontinent yielded up to them / and
became englisshe / and there they rested them a.iii. days / and took counsel
/ what they should do further. And when they departed they went to a fortress /
the which the french companyons had newely taken / called Foins / but as
soon as they within the fortress saw the englissheme^ come to them with
such a puisaunce / and that Gauaches was given up to them / they also yielded
up their fortress / and became englisshe / and so swear always to continue:
but yet they were forsworn / as ye shall here after. Than the englisshemen
passed forth / and came before Rochmador. the garrison was but easily fortified
/ and yet they with i thought not to yield up the fortress. So when the
englisshemen came to the town / and well advised the manner of them within /
than they set forth their artyllarie / and gave assaute in good order / and
many were hurt with shot / both within and without / the which assaute
endured a hole day / and at night the englisshemen withdrewe to their lodgings
/ and were in mind to assail it again the next day: but the same night they
within took counsel together / and perceived well how they were sorely
assauted / and the most wysest of them said / how at length they could not
endure / and if they were taken by force they should all dye / and the town
brent and spoiled without mercy. So all things considered the good and the
evil: they fell in treaty to yield them up to the englisshemen. So they
agreed that fro that day forth they should become englisshe / and that to
fulfill they made solemn oaths / and beside that at their (...) charge to
send out of their town (...) ^oste.xv. days to gether. (...) somets (...)
with vitayles / and they to pay for the vitayle at a certain price set among
them. And thus Rochmador abode still in rest. And than the englisshemen passed
forth toward Uille Franche in Tholosain / wasting and distroyenge the
country / puttyng the pore people into great misery / conquerynge towns and
castles / that were newely turned french / some by force and some by treatye /
and at last they came to Uille Franche / the which was well purueyed of all
manner of vitayle and artyllarie / for all the plain country was drawn
thither. and there they besieged ye town So that within four days they gave
many a great assaute / werby diverse were hurt both within and without. All
things considered they within perceived well they could not long endure / nor
they knew of no manner apparent reskewe coming to them ward. So than by
co^posicion they became englisshe / so y^ they should have no damage. So thus
Uile fra^che became englisshe. whereof y^ duke of Aniou (who lay at Toulouse)
was sore displeased / wha^ he knew thereof / but he could not amend it as at
y^ time. Sir John^ Chandos left there to be captain an englisshe knight
called sir Robert Roux and so passed forther distroyeng the country.

Now let us return to the siege of Bourdeill / and how the earl of Cambridge
and the earl of Penbroke perceiuered in their war.

How the earl of Cambrydge and the earl of Pe^broke took by great advise the
garyson of Bourdeill. Cap. C C.lix.
IN the mean season while yt the barons and knights of England made their
iourneys as well in Rouergue and Quercy / as in Agenoyse. the siege all that
season endured still before the garyson of Bourdeill / the which was the space
of a.xi. wekes. In the which season there were many ^autes / skrymysshes / and
feats of arms done and acheued nygh every day. For most como^ly daily they
wtin would come with all their power to the barriers of their to wne without the
gate and valiauntly skrymysshe there with all comers. And bare them self so
proprely that they were praised of all the ooste without. Thus in this estate
they endured a great season / and by likelyhod longer had done if pride and
presumpcion had not been. For they were men ^^owe / and right hardy and well
fournysshed with vitailes and artillary: and they of the oste without began
to ware werie / and saw well how they lay there at their great cooste and
charge / and wanne but little. And so on a day they took their counsel how
to maynteyne their siege / and to aproche the town. And there they concluded /
that the next day in the morning they should be all armed / and so keep them
self in their lodgings secretly / and to send a certain nombre to
skrymysshe with them within for they thought well / that they within would
issue out on them as they Were accustomed to do. And so when they had fought a
while than to return again / and to make semblaunt as though they fled / to
the intent to draw their enemies out of the fortress. And than they ordained
to have a nombre of horsemen redye to come in bitwene them and the town to
stop them when they would return. And so on this appointment they concluded /
saying / that if they had it not by that means / they should not geat the
town easily none other ways. And so in the next morning yerly / they caused
all their people to be armed / and sent a. CC. to the town to skrymysshe. And
when the capitaynes within / as Erualdon and Bernardya / saw them come / they
were right joyous / and armed them and al their company. They were a.vii. score
young and lusty companyons / and so opened their gate and came to their
barriers and there encountered their ennemies right fyersly. And so at last the
englysshemen reculed back for the nones. And when they within saw that / they
issued out with their standards / and said. Let us auaunce after them / for
surely they are all ours. And so they followed after so fiersly / and the
fleers fled so fayntely / that some were overthrown and taken prisoners. and
because they would have all / they had but little. for it is an old saying /
He that all coueteth / al leseth. So these companyo^s followed so far fro
their fortress / that when they Would have returned / they could not. For than
ser John^ Mo^tague (who kept the busshment with a.v. hundred fyghtyng men / and
was made knight the same time by the earl of Cambridge) There he encou^tred his
enemies. And wha^ they of Bour deill saw that: than they knew well that they
had foolysshely adventured them self. How be it they drew to gether like
valiant men / and fought / and did there feats of arms marvel to record.
and so held them self vndiscomfitted the space of.ii. hours still fighting
with their enemies / doing such deeds of arms yt the englysshemen took great
pleasau^ce at their valiant deeds. And sir John^ Montague was that day a good
knight and a valiant. Finally they of Bourdeill were all discomfited slain or
taken / so that none skaped / and the englisshe prisoners reskewed again / and
Erualdon and Bernardyn of Batefoll Capitaynes were taken. And in the mean
season while this skrymysshe was / the earl of Cambridge and therle of Penbroke
were auau^ced to the barriers and conquered them / and the gate also. And so
the earl of Ca^bridge baner entered into the forttes. Thus ye englissemen had
the garrison of Bourdeill / and caused all the men of the town to swear faith
and troth to keep the town for ye prince. And there they made a new captain
the lord of Mucydent and his company / and.lx. archers within. And than they
brake up their army / and concluded to go to Angolesme to the prince / to
know his pleasure what he would command them. Thus the siege brake up at
Bourdeill and every man returned. Now let us return to the knights of
England and of Gascoyne / that rode in Quercy / and let us speak of Chandos the
herald / and of the news that he brought fro the prince of Wales.

How sir Robert Canoll / sir John^ Chandos / and sir Thomas Phelton ordered
their people and returned to the prince. Cap. CC.lx.
THus as these foresaid men of war and their companyes rode in the marches of
Rouergue and Quercy / and turned to their part towns and castles / and
brought the country into great tribulacion. Chandos the herald came to them
where as they were before a fortres in Quercy / and as soon as they saw ye
herald come to them / they made him great there / and demanded of him
tidings. And he answered and said how the prince saluted them al / and desired
much to se them / and so velyucred to them the princis letters / and they took
and red them / wherein they found how that the prince would that ser John^
Chandos / ser Thomas Phelton / and the captal of Beufz should return to him to
ye cite of Angolesme / and that ser Robert Canoll and his men / with all the
co^panyons should abide still and make war as they did. And wha^ these lords /
who were chief of all the company understood these tidings they behold each
other / and demanded each of other what was best to do. Than they said all with
one voice to sir Robert Canoll. ser ye se and understand how our lord the
prince has sent for us / and has ordained that ye should abide still here in
this country as chief governor of al his men of war. Sirs said he my lord the
prince puts me to more honor than I would: but ss know for troth with out you
I will not abide / for if you veyt I will depart. So they determined all to
return to the prince / to know his pleasure and intent more plainly. Thus
brake up this great vyage and journey. And at there departing they sent ser
Perducas Dalbret to the town of Rochemador to keep the fronter there against
the frenchemen. And than they said to all the other companio^s / sirs ye have
herd how the prince has sent for us / and as yet we know not ye cause why.
There / fore we shall show you what ye shall do / ye shall assemble you toguyder
with your companyes and enter into the marchesse of Lymosyn and Auuergne / and
make there war: for without war ye can not live. And sirs we promise you
faithfully: that if ye win town / forteresse / orcastell where soever it be:
and if it fortune that ye or any of you be there besieged / we will so confort
you / that we will reyse the siege. And wha^ they herd that promise / they
said. Sirs we shall do the best that we can / on the trust of yor promise /
for paraduenture we shall have need thereof. Thus they departed each fto other /
and so brake up that journey: and these lords went straight to Angolesme to
the prince / who made to the^ great chere. And a little before there was come to
the prince out of the county of Pyergourt: the earl of Cambridge / the earl
of Penbroke / sir Johan Mountagu and other.

Now let us speak of the english companyons / who were departed fro sir
John^ Cha^dos / and how they perceyuered.

How the english companyons took the castle of Bell perch / and therein the
duke of Burbons mother / and also they took the strong castle of saint Severe
in Berry. Cap. CC.lxi.
AMong these said companyo^s there were three squiers / who were great capitanes
/ hardy and well expert me^ of war / specially in sautyng and scalyng of
towns and forteresses. The one named Ortygo / the second Bernarde de Wyske /
and the third de la Sale. These three thought not to sit ydell / but to do some
deed whereby to be spoken of. Than they with their company went into Lymosyn /
and seneshall and gouernoure there under the prince was sir Johan Deureux These
three foresaid squyers / took their advise to assay to get some forteresse in
France / and than they knew well that Bell perch in Burbonoyse was a strong
castle / and that therein dwelled the duke of Burbons mother / and mother to
the french queen. And they understood by their spies that the good lady was in
the castle alone / without company or good watch: for they hard reported
how ye constable of the castle would often times ride out / and take ly tell
head to the save keeping of the place. So these co^panyons / a certain of the^
such as they did chose out slept not their purpose but rode in a day and a
night / and in the morning came to Bell perch / and scaled the castle and
took it / and the good lady within it. And than^e they saw well how the
forteresse was good and strong / and in a good plentyfull country: and said how
they trusted to keep it against all men. And also the same night they took
another / castle called saint Severe / on the marchesse of Lymosyn: and gave
it to sir Johan Deureux. These tidings was anon known in France / how Bell
perch was taken by thenglysshmen / and the queen's mother within it. Whereof the
french king was sore displeased / and so was ye queen and the duke of Burbone:
but they could not amend it as at that time. In the same season sir Loyes of
Sanxere / a right valyant knight and a hardy: was chosen and admytted to be one
of ye marshals of the war in France / howbeit as than lived sir Arnolde
Dandrehen but he was so aged and bruised in arms / and travail of time passed:
yt he could not well help him self / nor could no lengar attend on that
office. Howbeit he would ^ere harness at time of need. Now let us speak
somewhat of the business of Picardy / and of assembly that was made at Tornehen.

THe french king all the season of somer had made a great appayrell of ships
and vessels / in the port of Hareluce to the intent to have sent an army into
England / well furnysshed with good men of arms / knights and squiers.
Whereof sir Philyppe his brother duke of Burbon was admytted as chief governor
/ to thentent to have distroyed England. And the french king lay at the cyite
of Roane the better to bring about his purpose. And every weke a two or three
times / he would go and se his ships: he had so great mind and affection on
them. And beside that his commandment was so spredde over all the realm /
that about Rone / Ueulguessyn / and Beaumosyne / there came daily men of war:
in so great nombre / that it was marueyle to regard them. And daily great
pruisyon came to them / as if they had been in Castyle or Portyngale. Howebeit
the lord Clysson / who was one of the chiefest of the kings counsel /
acorded not to this by age / but discounsayled the king and all the nobles of
the realm / fro this journey into England. Saying / how they were not so
well accustomed to make war / as thenglysshmen were. And alleged thereto diverse
reasons / as he that knew more the co^dicyons and nature of the englysshmen /
and the state of England: than other did. Natwithsta^dyng he could not break
ye kings purpose / nor some of his counsel: but y^ this viage should go
forward. The king of England and his son the duke of Lancaster / and diverse of
his counsel were well informed of this army and viage / how the frenchmen
would come and make war on them in their own country / whereof they were right
ioyouse. And had furnisshed the ports and passages on the sea against Poictou
and Normandy / to receive them if they came. And all ye realm of England was
fully determined to fight with the^ / if they would come into the realm. Than
the king of England was counsayled to send his son the duke of Lancastre with a
certain nombre of men of war to Calais. And the king himself named them that
should go with his son thither: as the earl of Salisbury / therle of Warwyke /
sir Water of Manny / the lord Rose / sir Henry Percy the lord Basset / the
lord Wyllouby / the lord Dalawar / the lord de la Poule / sir Thom^s of
Grau^tsome / sir Aleyn Bourchier / sir Richard Story and diverse other: they
were.v. C. men of arms / and.v. C. archers. And so they ca^e to Dover / and
when their ships were ready / they passed the sea / and arrived at the strong
town of Calays: and there took landyng and were lodged in the town. In the
same season the king of england had written specially / desyring sir Robr^t of
Framur to serve him in his wars / with a certain no^bre of men of war. And
sir Robert who had been always good english / answered and said: that he
would be ready when soever it pleased the king of England to command him or
as soon as he knew ye the king or any of his children should aryue at Calys /
or in ye field to make war into France. So as soon as he herd that ye duke of
Lancaster was aryued at Calys / than he somoned all his company / and all such
as he thought would serve and aid him: and apparelled for his voyage as
hastily as he could. Now let us return to ye business of Poictou.

How the castle of Roche sur yone was rendered to thenglysshmen / and how the
capitayn thereof was put to death / by the commandment of the duke of Aniou.
Cap. CC.lxii.
LE shall know that after the deytyng of the barons and knights / of Guyen /
and that Chandos the heraud had brought them tidings fro the prince / they
went all by one accord to the town of Angoleme / where they found the prince
/ who received them ioyounlly And a little before that / was returned the earl
of Cambridge and therle of Penbroke / after ye conquest of Burdeyll: as ye have
herd before. Thus these lords made great feast and chere together / when they
met: and than took counsel and advise toguyder / what was best for them to
do / to enploy forth their season. Than they remembered / how in the parties
of Aniou there was a fair castle and a strong / parteynyng to ye duke of
Aniou / called Roche sur yon And so they all determined to go and ley siege
thereto / and to win it if they might. They prepared for that journey / and
there came to them all the barons and knights of Po^^tou: ser James Audeley /
the lord of Pouns / the lord of Partney / sir Loys of Harcourt sir Guysshard
Dangle / the lord of Pynan / the lord of Ta^^ boton / sir Mabrion of Lymyers
/ the seneshall of Rochell / sir Thom^s Percy: and when they were all assembled
together / they were mo than three thousand spears. And they departed / and rode
so long y^ they came to the castle of Roche sur yone / the which was strong
and well kept and well provided for defense / with men of war / purueyance / and
artyllary. And the captain there set by the duke of Aniou / was called sir
Johan Blo^deau: who had under him many good companions / at the cost and charge
of the duke of Aniou. Than the said lords / laid sege round about the castle
in good order / and they made to be brought thither fro the town of Thoars /
and fro the city of Poycters diverse great eugins / and caused them to be
reared up against the castle / beside other gonnes and springals / that they
had in their host. And they had vytayle enough / for there came plenty to them
fro Poyctou / and fro the marchesse adioynynge. And when sir Johan Bloudeau
saw how he was besiged / with so many good men of war for there were nighe
all the barons and knights of Acquitayne. And perceived well how there was no
conforte nor aid coming toward him fro no perte: he began than to be afraid
/ for he saw well the lords that were there would not depart / till they had
won the castle / other byforce or otherwise. And in the earl of Cambridge
company / and in sir Johan Chandos / there were byuers knights that were well
acquaynted with the captain / and had been in his company in time passed. And
they came to the barryers / and did so much on their promise and assurance /
that they spoke with him: and handeled him in such wise (for he was not
subtell / howbeit he was a good knight) that he re^dred up the castle: if he
were not rescued with in the space of a month / and tha^ he to have.vi.
thousand frankes / for the purueyaunces with in ye castle. And so by this
treaty they without to abide still in suertie / without making of any war of
both parties / during the term of the said co^posicyon: and if they were not
rescued within the same term as aforesaid / than they to render up the
castle. This treaty thus concluded / the captain within signified the matter
to the duke of Aniou / and to the french king / to the duke of Berry / and to
all other lords by whom he thought to be aided / to thentent that he might
the better be excused fro blame: if any reproach after were laid to his charge /
But for all his sendyng / and that the castle was fair and strong / and
right necessary to be french / for the country of Aniou / and Tourayne. yet
for all that: they had another rescue nor confort. So that as soon as the month
was passed and expyred / the english lords desired the capytayne to keep his
promise: and also he had delivered good pledges so to do. Than the said
captain said to his company. Sirssyth the french king and the duke of Aniou
/ woll wylfully lose this fortress / we can not keep it alone without we be
aided. And so there he yielded up the castle: and thenglysshmen took possessyon
thereof / and were right glad thereof / and they delivered to the captain.vi.
thousand frankes / for such prouisyons as were within the castle. And he and
all his company were surely co^neyed to the town of Angyers. And as soon as he
was come thither / he was arested by the governor of the town / and put in to
the castle in prison. And as I herd say / in a night he was put into a sack /
and cast into the river and drowned: by the strayte commandment of the duke
of Aniou / because he took gold and silver / for ye delyerance of the castle
/ the which was able of it self / to have be kept ye space of a year / if
need had so reqred. Thus the^glysshmen had in possessyon / the castle of Roche
sur yone in Aniou / and there they set a great garrison / and repeyred the
castle sufficiently. And than they returned again to Angoleme to the prince /
and some of the^ took leave and departed to their own houses / and sir James
Audeley that valyant knight / and seneshall as than of Poictou / went and lay
at Fo^t neythe county. And there he fell sick of a sore malady / so yt thereby
at length he dyed / whereof the prince and princess were right soroufull / and
in likewise all the barons and knights of Poictou. And his obsequy was
solemply done in the city of Poicters / the prince being there personally. And
anon after at the request of y^ barons and knights of Poicton sir John^
Chandos / who was as than constable of Aquitayne was made seneshall of Poictou.
And so he went and say in the cite of Poiters / and he made of / ten yssues and
iourneys against the frenchmen and held the^ so short that they durst not
ride but in great routes and companies. In the same season was delivered out of
prison / the vycont of Rochchoart / whom the prince had kept in prisone /
because he was had in suspect to have turned french. So that at the request
of his friends in Poictou / such as were than about the prince: the prince
delivered him / and gave him again all his lands. And as soon as the same
vycount was delivered out of prisone / he went privily to Paris to the french
king / and turned and became french / and than returned into his own land
/ without any knolege that he had been at Paris. Than he set Thybault du pont a
breton in his forteresse: and in contynent sent and defied the prince of Wales
/ and made him great war. Now let us somewhat speak of the duke of
Lancaster.

How the duke of Burgoyne deperted fro the cite of Roane / to thentent to
fight with the duke of Lancastre / and how they lodged each against other at
Tornehen. Cap. CC.lxiii.
When the duke of Lancastre was come to Calays / as ye have herd before: and
had well refresshed him and his people there. Than he thought not to lie there in
ydelnesse / but rather to do some deeds of arms in France. And for that intent
he departed fro Calays on a day with three hundred spears / and as many
archers: and so passed beside Guynes / and rode so long till he passed the
river of Ostre / and there spread abroad in the country / and took their way
toward the abbey of Lynques and there took a great pray and led it to Calys.
And another day they took another way and went toward Boloyne / and did
great damage to the plain country. and the same time therle Guy of saint Poule
and sir Galeran his sofie / with a certain no^bre of men of war lay in the
city of Turwyn / but they issued not out for all they herd that the^glisshmen
rode abroad in the country / for they thought them self not able to fight with
them / nor to keep the field against the^. A none tidings came to the french
king where as he lay at Roane / and had made a great assemble / as ye have
herd before. How the duke of Lancastre was come to Calais / and how daily /
he and his men made rodes and yssues in to France. When the french king herd
yt / both he and his counsel had new ymaginacions / and the same weke it
was determined that the duke of Burgoyne should have taken the sea to have gone
into England. Than the king and his counsel debated / what was best to do in
yt case: other to go and fight with thenglysshmen that were on yt side the sea
/ or else to keep forth their journey into England. And so there it was fermely
concluded: yt every man should dysloge and to make them ready to go toward
Calays with the duke of Burgoyne. And so their first purpose was broken / for
they were determined to go and fight with thenglysshemen on yt side the sea /
whereof every man was glad and aparelled themself. And the duke of Burgone
deperted and all his company / and took his way to pass y^ river of Some at
Abuyle: and did so much by his iourneys that he came to Muttrell / at Hedyn /
and at saint Poule / and there about the french men abode each other. Than it
was showed the duke of Lancastre / how the frenchmen aproched nere to him to
fight / whereof he was glad and was issued out of Calais for that intent / and
took his field in the valey of Tornehen. And he had not ben there long / but
that the gentle knight ser Robert of Namur came thither to serve him with a
hundred spears well furnysshed / of whose coming the duke of Lancastre was
right joyful and said to him. A my fair and dear uncle: ye be right heartily
welcome. Sir it is showed us how the duke of Burgoyne aprocheth sore to fight
with us. Sir quod he in gods name so be it we would gladly se him. Thus
the^glysshme^ were loged in the vale of Tornehen / and fortefyed their camp
with strong hedges / and daily there came prouisyon to the^ from Calais / and
their currors ran over the county of Guyens for forage and other vitayls / but
little they gat there: for all the plain country was distroyed and lost before
/ and every thing had in to fortresses. Than came the duke of Burgoyne and his
company / and lodged on the hill of Tornehen / against the englysshmen. The
frenchmen lodged them in good order and took a great space of ground / for as
I herd say: the duke of burgoyne had there with him / mo than four thousand
knights. Consydre than / if the resydue were not a great nombre. Thus they
were each against other a long space without any thing doing / for though the
duke of Burgoyne had that great no^bre / and saw that there was with him of
good men of war / seuyn against one of the englisshmen: yet for all that he
would not fight without leave of ye king his brother / who was not in mind
that he should fight. And yet of truth / if the frenchmen had set forward to
have fought / the englysshmen would not have refused them: for they were ready
every day to receive them in good order. Every man fully determined what they
should do / if they did issue out: but because they were so few in no^bre /
and that they were in so strong a place / they thought not to depart nysely
out of their advantage. And sundry times diverse on both parties would issue
and scrimysshe / and sometime wanne and sometime lost / as chance often falls
in such adventures. In the same time Loyes the earl of Flaunders / was greatly
inclyned to the honor and profit / of his son the duke of Burgoyne / who
lay the same season in a fair house / that he had newly builded beside Gaunt.
And often hard tidings from the duke and he from him / by messa^gers coming
and going: and always he counsayled the duke / that he should in no wise
break nor pass the ordinance of the king his brother / nor of his counsel.
Now let us leave them thus and return to the business of farther countries /
where as knights and squyers had enough to do / because the wars were more
habundant there / than in other places.

How sir Johan Cha^dos brought the country of Aniou in great trybulacion / and
how he wasted and dystroyed the lands of the bycount of Rochchoart / except
the forteresses. Cap. CC.lxiiii.
IN the mean seasone while this journey was thus made about Tornehe^ / there
fell diverse adue^tures in poictou / the which ought not to be forgotten. For
sir Johan Chandos who was seneshall there: like a hardy and a valya^t knight
ever desyringe to find the frenchmen to fight with them. He assembled together
at Poicters a certain nombre of men of arms: saying how he would ride in to
Aniou / and return again by Towrayne / and se the frenchemen in the
marchesse and fronters there. The which purpose he signified to therle of
Penbroke who lay at Mortaygne in garyson / with two hundred spears. Of the
which tidings the earl was joyful / and was well content to have rydden
forth / but some of the knights of his counsel brake his purpose / and
said. Sir: ye be as yet but young / your nobleness is yet to come: and sir /
if you put your self in to the company of sir John^ Chandos / whatsoever ye do
he shall have the brute and voice thereof / for ye shall be reputed but as his
companyon. Therefore sir / it is better for you sithe ye be so great a lord as
ye be / that ye do your enterprises by your self a part. And let sir Johan
Chandos do his by him self / sithe he is but a bacheler as to the regard of
your estate. So these words and other abated the earls desire / so that thereby
he had no more will to go forth with ser Johan Chandos / and so made an excuse
to him. Howebeit sir John^ Chandos would not break his purpose in going forth
to do his enterprice but made his assemble at Poicters / and so deperted with
three hundred spears of knights and squyers / and two hundred archers. With
him was sir Thomas Percy / sir Stephyn Gosenton / sir Richard Pountchardon /
sir Eustace Da^bretycourt / sir Richard Te^con / ser Thom^s Spens / sir Nowell
Lornysshe / sir Dangoses sir Thomas Balastre / sir Johan Tryuell / sir Wyllm^
Mountendre / sir Wyllm^ Manbrius of Lymers / sir Geffray Darge^ton and diverse
other. These men of arms and archers / rode forth in good ordinance / and
passed Poitou and entered into Aniou. Than they sent forth their currours
before them / to bren and exyle ye plain country. So they did many yuels in
that good plentyfull country of Aniowe / and none came to fight with them /
and tarried there the space of.xv. days / and specially in the plentyfull co^^re
called Londonoys. And than they cetourned again between Aniou and Tourayn a
long by the river of Creuse. And so entered in to the land of the vycont of
Roche choart / and brent and wasted the country all about / for they left
nothing abroad without the fortress. And so came to the town of Roch choart
and assay ^ed it right valyantly: howbeit they wanne nothing there / for the
town was well fortifyed (...) good men of war. Thybault of pont / and He
lions of Talay were capitayns within ye town so than the^nglysshmen passed
forth. Than sir Johan Chandos had knowledge how the marshall of France / sir
Loyes of Sanxere with a great nombre of men of war was at Hay in Tourayne.
Tha^ he had great desire to go thy (...) and sent word thereof to therle of
Pe^broke de syringe him to go with him to y^ Hay in Tourayne / and to mete with
him at Casteleraulte. And Chandos the heraude went on this message / and he
found therle at Mortayne / who had ready assembled a certain nombre / to then
tent to make a journey on his enemies. And y^ earl made his excuse by counsel
of his knights / saying he might not come to sir John^ Chandos as at that
time. Than the heraude returned and found his master at Casteleraut / and
there showed him his answer fro therle of Pe^broke. And when sir John^ Cha^dos
herd that he was not well content in his mind / for he perceived well how
therle left that enterprice / by presumpcion and pride. Than he said / well a
gods name so be it. And so than gave leave to the most part of his company
to depart / and he went again to the city of Poicters.

How sir Loyes of Sanxere ca^e on therle of Penbroke and slew diverse of his
people / and besieged the earl in a house. Cap. CC.lxv.
Now let us show so^ what of therle John^ of Pe^broke / what he did as soon
as he knew that sir Johan Chandos was gone back again to Poycters / and had
given leave to his men to depart. Than the earl prepared to ride forth / and
with him a three hundred spears english / and po^ctenyns / and so departed
fro Mortaygne. There were certain knights and squyers of Poictou / and of
Xaynton / and some of England / who had been with sir Johan Chandos. Than they
came to the earl of Penbroke and went forth in his company. So they rode forth
and passed through Poyctou / and took the same way that sir Johan Chandos had
taken before / and so entered into Aniou / and brent and exyled the country /
and took all that was left / and so they tarried a certain space in the
country of Lo^do noise. And than took their way into the land of the vycont
of Roche choart / where they did great damage and hurt. Than when y^ frenchmen
/ who were in the garysons in the marches of Tourayne / Aniou / and Poyctou /
herd of these two iourneys / thus made in the country of Aniou. And herd
how that for pride therle of Pe^broke / who was but a young man / disdayned to
go forth in the company of sir John^ chandos. Than they determined to
encountre him if they might / thinkyng more easily to disconfyte him than sir
Johan Chandos. Than they assembled together secretly a certain nombre out of
every garyson there about / and they made their captain / sir Loys of Sanxer
marshall of France. And so secretly in a night they went forth by Roche
Poizay in Poictou / the which was french / and in that company was sir Robert
of Sanxere / cosyn to the marshall: ser Johan of Uyen / sir Johan of Bulle /
sir Wyllyam of Bordes / sir Loys of saint Julyan / and Carnet the breton: they
were to the nombre of.vii. hundred. Than the earl of Penbroke had done his
journey / and was retournynge and entered again in to Poyctou / and had made an
end of the brennyng of the vycont of Roch^hoartes lands. And in his company
was sir Bauden of Fanuyll seneshall of Xaynton / sir Thomas Percy / sir Thomas
Spenser / sir Dangoses / sir Johan Ornych / sir John^ Herpedan / sir James
Surgeres / sir Johan Couson sir Thomas of saint Albyn / sir Robert Twyforde /
sir Simon Ausagre / sir John^ of Mortayne / sir John^ Couchet / and diverse
other. Thus these englysshmen and poyctenyns rode forth with out dismay / and
herd no manner of tidings of any men of war / and so with great pyllage and
pray entered again in to Poyctou. And on a day they came about hye noone to a
village called Puiernon / and took their lodging / wenyng to them to be in
surety: and there varlettes we^^ setting up of their horses and dressing of
their supper. Than suddenly the frenchmen who were well aduysed of that they
should do / came in to the town their spears in the reest / and cried their
cries / our lady of Sanxere for the marshall of France. And so they beat
down on every side the englysshmen in the st^etes / and in the houses / and so
the noise was so great that it raised men up in great affray / for they were
suddenly taken. The noise came to therle of Pe^broke / to sir Thom^s Percy / sir
Thomas Fra^uyll / and to the other knights: how y^ frenchmen were come and
assailed them. Than these lords went out of their lodgings and assembled
their companyes together / but they could not draw all together / for the
frenchmen were so strong / that the englysshmen could not endure them. So at
the first brunt / there were taken and slain mo than sixscore: so that the earl
had no remedy but to withdraw him as soon as he might / in to a place of the
templers closed with stone walls. And so there the earl and such as were with
him entered into the place / and the resydue were taken and slain / and most
part of their harness and horses were lost. And there the earl of Penbroke
lost all his baggage and richesse. And whan^e the frenchemen knew that they
were in that place / they were thereof right ioyouse. Saying among them self
* they can not escape us / they are all ours. They shall now derely abye the
domages / that they have done in Aniou and Towrayne. So the frenchmen drew to
the place in good order ready to assail it / for they saw well that y^ place
was p^ignable. Than they assailed the place right fiersly / and there was
showed many (...) noble feate of arms. The frenchmen were good men of war /
and assailed the place round about right valyantly. The earl and thenglysshmen
payned themself as much as they might to defend theymselfe / as it stood them
well in hand. The frenchmen had certain scalynge ladders / and some of
them adventured themself to mount upon the walls / with pauesses before
them / for fear of shot and castyng of stones / but when they were up they
were fierce lie received / with knights and squyers / with spears and swerdes
in their hands. And so fought with the frenchmen hand to hand / and caused
them to discende down faster than they came up: and such archers as were
within shot so fiersly / that the frenchmen drue abacke. So this assaut
endured till it was night / than the frenchmen right weary and sore traueyled
(...) retrayt and reculed back / saying that (...) that day / till y^ next
morning that they purposed to come again to thassaut. But all things co^sydred
/ the frenchmen said surely they be all ours / they can not long endure against
us / we shall rather famyshe them. And so they lodged them that night / and
kept good watch before ye place. ye may know for trouhe / therle of Penbroke
and his company were natte well at their ease / for they saw well they were in
great ieopardy. For they parceyned well how the (...) was not strong enough
to endure (...) so many good knights / as were there (...) the^. Also they
(...) and artyllary / (...) the place lon(...) they made no sembl(...) thought
to (...) and a night if need were. And when it wa(...) night / than they
de^^red a squire on who(...)ey had great trust / to depart out at a back
p^^terne and so to ride to Poicters / and to speak with sir John^ Cha^dos / and
to show him what case they were in. She wynge him also / how that if he list
/ he might come time enough to rescue them: for they trusted to defend the
place / till the next day past noone. The squire who saw the great danger
that they were in / said he would gladly do their message. And also he said /
he knew well (...) way thider. And so about mydnight (...) by a back posterne
and took the way to (...) which as he thought should have been the ^^xt way.
Howbeit for all his knowledge / he went all night out of the way / so yt it was
fair day or he could get in to the right way. And in the morning the
frenchmen armed the^ and sowned to thassaut / saying how they would assaut y^
place in y^ cole of the morning / rather than in y^ heat of the day. And the
earl of Penbroke / who had slept but little / for all the night he and his
company were fortifyenge of the walls with stones and other things / for they
saw well how the frenchemen ordained to assail them again. So within a
while the frenchemen drew to y^ place and in good order made assaute and had
skalyng ladders and some mounted up y^ walls with pauesses to defend their
heedes. they thought a great honor / who soever could mount first how be it
the^nglisshmen were not idle / but ready to defend themself / or else they had been taken / and so they defended the^ self merueylously and cast down stones
on the pauesses and bassenettes / and ouerthrue slew and hurt diverse / and
did such deeds of arms yt ye never herd of so feeble a place / so well
defended with so few people / against so many good knights and squyers as
were there* so this assaut endured fro morning till it was noone.

How sir Johan Chandos came to the socour of the earl of Penbroke. Ca. CC.lxvi.
BItwene the morning and ix. of ye day when thassaut was most feresest / and
that the frenchmen were sore dyspleased / that the^glysshmen endured so long.
Wherefore they sent to the vyllages there about / for pikes and matockes to break
down and undermine the wall / which thing the englysshmen douted most. Than
the earl of Pe^ broke called a squire to him and said. Friend take my courser
and issue out at the back posterne / and we shall make you way / and ride
straight to Poicters and show sir John^ Cha^Dos the state and dangere that we
be in / and recomaunde me to him by this token and took a Ryng fro his finger
and delivered to him: and said take sir Johan Chandos this ring / he knows
it right well. The squire who took that enterprice / thought it should be a
great honor to him / if he might acheue to escape and speak with him. Took the
ring and mounted inco^tynent on his courser / and departed by a preuy way
while the saute endured and took the way to Poycters. In the mean season the
assaute was terryble and feyrse by the frenchmen / and the englysshmen defended
them self right valyantly with good courage / as it stood them well in hand
so to do.

Now let us speak of the first squire that departed fro Puirenon at the hour
of mydnight / and all the night he rode out of his way. and when it was morning
and fair day / tha^ he knew his way and so rode toward Potters: and by that
time his horse was weary Howheit he came thither by nine of the clock / and there
alyghted / before sir Johan Chandos lodging / and entered and found him at
mass. and so came and kneled down before him and did his message / as he was
commanded. And sir Johan Chandos who was not content / for the other day
before / in that therle of Pe^broke would not ride with him as ye have herd
before. Wherefore he was not lightly enclyned to make any great have but said
it will be hard for us to com thither time enough and to here out this mass.
And anon after mass y^ tables were covered ready to dinner / and the servants
demanded of him if he would go to dyuer. And he said yes sithe it is ready.
Than he went in to his hall / and knights and squyers brought him water. And
as he was a washing / there came in to the hall the second squire / fro the
earl of Penbroke: and kneled down and took the ring out of his purse / and
said. Right dear sir: the earl of Penbroke recommaundeth him to you by this
token / and desires you her tely to come and conforte him / and bring him out
of the danger that he and his be in at Puyrenon. Than sir Johan Chandos took
the ring and knew it well / and said: to co^ethyder be times it were hard /
if they be in yt case as ye show me. Let us go to dinner / and so sat down
and all his company / and eat the first course. And as he was seruedde of the
second course and was eating thereof / suddenly sir Johan Chandos / who greatly
had ymagined of that matter. And at last cast up his heed / and said to his
company. Sirs / the earl of Penbroke is a noble man / and of great lynage. He
is son to my natural lord the king of England / for he has wedded his
daughter: and in every thing he is companyon to therle of Ca^bridge. He has
required me to come to him in his business / and Jought to consent to his
desire / and to socour and confort him / if we may come be times. There with he
put the table fro him / and said. Sirs / I will ride toward Puyrenon whereof
his people had great joy / and inco^tynent apparelled them / and the
trumpettes sowned. And every man mounted on their horses they that best might /
as soon as they herd that sir Johan Chandos would rydeto Puyre non / to
conforte the earl of Penbroke and his company / who were besiege there. Than
every knight / squire / and man of arms / went out in to the field. So they
were mo than two hundred spears and always they increased. Thus as they rode
forth toguyder / tidings came to the frenchemen / who had contynually
assawted the forteresse / from the morning till it was high noone (by their
spies) who said to them. Sirs / advise you well: for sir Johan Chandos is
deperted fro Poicters / with mo tha^ CC. spears / and is coming hyderwarde in
great have / and has great desire to find you here. And when sir Loyes of
Sa^xere / and sir John^ of Uyen / sir John^ of Bulle / and the other capitayns
herd those tidings / the wisest among the^ said. Sirs our people (...) sore
weary and traueyled with assautyng of thenglysshmen both y^ster day and this
day. Therefore I think it were better that fair and easily we returned in save
guard / with such wynninges and prisoners as we have got / rather than to
abide the adventure of the coming of sir Johan Chandos and his company / who
are all fresshe and lusty / for I fear we may lose more than we shall wyn / ye
which counsel was well believed / for it behooved not them long to tarry. Than
their tru^pettes so wned the retrayt / than all their company drew fro the
assaut / and assembled together and trussed up their harness and carriage / and
so returned and took the way to Poizay. The earl of Penbroke and his company /
knew anon thereby / how the frenchmen had knowledge of the coming of sir
Johan Chandos. Than the earl said. Sirs let us all issue out and ride toward
Poicters / to mete with my dear friend sir Johan Chandos. Than they lepte a
horseback such as had any horses / and some a foot and two and two on a horse
/ and so they issued out of the castle and rode toward Poycters. And they had
not rydden aleage / but that they encountered sir Johan Chandos and his company
/ and there was a joyful metynge: and sir John^ Chandos said that he was sore
displeased / that he came not or the frenchmen were departed. And so they rode
together talking the space of three leages / and than^e they took leave each of
other. Sir Johan Chandos returned to Poitters / and the earl of Penbroke to
mortaygne: fro whens he first departed. And the marshalles of France and
their company returned to Potzay / and there departed their ^otie. And than
every man went to their own garrison and led with them their prisonerss / and
raunsomed them courtesly / in like manner as was acustomed between the
englysshmen and frenchmen. Now let us return to the assemble before
Tornehen / and speak of ye death of the most gentle queen / moostly detail /
and most courtesse yt ever was queen in her vdayes the which was the fair
lady Philyp of Heynault / queen of England and Irelande.

How queen Philyp of England trepassed out of this mortal life / and of the
three gifts that she desired of the king her husband or she dyed. Cap.
CC.lxvii.
IN the mean seasone while the noble men of France were thus assembled before
Tornehen / of whom y^ duke of Burgon was chief and sovereign / and y^ duke of
Lancastre with the^glisshmen on the other part. There fell in England a heavy
case and a common / howbeit it was right pyteouse / for the king / his children
/ and all his realm. For the good queen of England / that so many good deeds
had done in her time / and so many knights socoured / and ladies and damsels
comforted: and had so largely depted of her goods to her people / and
naturally loved always the nacyon of Heynaulte / the country where as she was
borne. She fell sick in the castle of Wyndsore / the which sickness
contynewed on her so long / that there was no remedy but death. And the good
lady when she knew and parceyued that there was with her no remedy but death
/ she desired to speak with the king her husband. And when he was before her:
she put out of her bed her right han^e / and took the king by his right
hand / who was right sorrowful at his heart. Than she said Sir we have in peace
/ joy / and great prosperyte / used all our time toguyer. Sir now I pray you
at our departing / that ye will grant me three desires. The king tyght
sorowfully weeping / said. Madame: desire what ye will I grant it.

SIr said she / I require you first of all: that all manner of people / such
as I have dault with all in their marchaundyse / on this side thesee or beyond
/ that it may please you to pay every thing that I owe to them / or to any
other. And secondly sir / all such ordinance and promyses as I have made to
the churches / as well of this country as beyond the sea / where as I have
had my devotion: that it may please you to accomplysshe and to full fill the
same. Thirdely sir / I require you that it may please you to take none other
sepulture / when soever it shall please god to call you out of this transytorie
life / but beside me in Westmynster The king all weeping / said. Madame: I
grant all your desire. Than the good lady and queen made on her the sign of
the cross / and commanded the king her husband to god and her youngest sofie
Thomas / who was there beside her. And anon after she yielded up the spirit /
the which I believe surely the holy angels received with great joy up to heaven
/ for in all her life she did neither in thought nor deed thing / whereby to
lose her soul: as ferr as any creature could know. Thus the good queen of
England dyed: in the year of our lord. M. CCC.lxix. in the vigyll of our lady
in the mids of August / Of whose death tidings came to Tornehen / into the
english host: whereof every creature was sore displeased / and right so
roufull: and specially her son the duke of Lancaster. Howbeit there is no sorrow
/ but it behooves at length to be borne and forgoten. Therefore thenglysshmen
left not their order / but remained a long space before the frenchmen. So it
was / that certain knights and squyers of France that were there / and daily
saw their enemies before them. Concluded toguyder / the next morning to go
and serimysshe with the englysshmen. And of the same acorde were mo than three
hundred knights and squyers of Uer mandois / Artois / and Corbois: so each of
the^ gave warnyng to other / without knowledge of any of their marshals. And so
ye next morning by yt it was day light / they were on horsbacke ready armed /
and toguyder assembled. And so they rode forth without any noise making / and
rode about the hill of Tornchen to take their advantage / to come in at one of
the corners of thenglysshe host. It which corner was loged sir Robert of
Namure and his company / and the same night he had kept the watch / and in
the morning he was drawn to his tent / and was set at the table to eat some
meat / armed save his bassenet: and ye lord of Poicten with him. And therewith
came the frenchmen on the same side / but as hap was: such as had kept the
watch were not unarmed / the which fortuned well for them. For anon they were
ready to defend their enemies / and so encountered with them and brake their
way. Anon tidings ca^e to sir Robert of Namure / how his men were fightyng
with the frenchmen: therewith he put the table fro him / and said: let us go and
help our men. And incontinent he put his bassenet on his heed / and caused one
to take his baner / and displayed it. Than one said to him. Sir: me think it
were best that ye sent to the duke of Lancastre / and fight not without him. He
answered shortly and said. Send who so will I will go the next way that I can
to my men / and they that love me / let them follow after. Therewith he went
forth his glayue in his hand / aprochyng his enemies: and the lord of
Poicten and sir Henry of Sanxels with him / and diverse other knights. And so
found his men fightyng with the frenchmen / who were a great nombre: and
lykely to have done a great enterprice. But as soon as they saw sir Robr^t of
Namures baner come / they drew abacke to gyder: for they feared that all the
host had be styrred / and so in diverse places it was. Under sir Robertes baner
/ there was slain a knight of Uermandoise / called sir Robert of Coloyne / the
which was great damage: for he was right sweet and courtesse / and a right good
knight. The frenchmen returned again without any more doing / for they feared
rather to lose than wyn. And sir Robert thought not to follow after folisshely
/ but assembled his men together / and so went to his lodgyng / when he saw
that the frenchmen were gone.

How the duke of Burgoyne depted fro the duke of Lancaster without battle /
and how the duke of Lancaster went to Calays. Ca. CC.lxviii.
AFter this adventure: there was nothing done that ought to be remembered. It
displeased mochsom of both parties / yt they were so long so nere together and
fought not / for it was said every day among them / we shall fight to more we
/ y^ which day ca^e never. For as it is said before: the duke of Burgoyne
would not break the ordinance of the king his brother / who had straytely
commanded him / that he should give no battle to thenglysshmen: and every day
there was messangers between them / coming and going. The duke of Burgoyne /
as I was than^e enfourmed / ymagyned and considered / how that he lay there at
great cost and charge / and how he could lie no lengar there to his honor.
For he had there a four thousand knights or mo / and saw well that his
enemies were but a handful of men / as to the nombre of his / and had another
fought with the^ nor should not. Wherefore hesent of his knights to ye king his
brother / showing him his mind that other he would have leave to fight / or
else(...) depart. The king knew well the duke desired but reason / commaundyng
him that on the sight of his letters he should dillodge and give leave to all
his men of war to depart / and to come himself to Paris. Saying / how he
would go himself in his own propre person to fight with the englysshmen.
When the duke of Burgoyne herd those tidings / he gave knoledge thereof
secretly to the greattest of his host / saying to the^. Sirs we must disloge /
the king heth commanded it / and so by the hour of mydnight all thing was
trussed / and every man mounted on their horses / and set fire on their
logynges. At which time sir Henry of Sa^xels kept the watch / with ser Robert
of Namures company (who spyed a fire) and than two or three and so mo. Than he
said to himself: a / I fere me the frenchmen will a wake us this night / it
seems so by their dealyng and said to the^ that were there about him. Let us
go and awake the lord Robert Namure / to the intent that y^ frenchmen find us
not a sleep. Than this sir Henry came to the lodging of the lord Namur / and
called his cha^berlayns and said. Sirs / it is be houefull that ye a wake your
lord. And they went to his bed side and awoke him / and showed him all the
matter (who answered) Well: I se we shall shortly here other tidings. Call up
your folks / and let every man be quickly armed: And so they did / and also
he was shortly armed. And when his men were assembled together / he caused one
to take his baner and went straight to the duke of Lancastres tent / who as
than was nere armed / for he had warning before of the matter. And so he was
anon ready and his lords little and little drew anon about him / and ever as
they came they raynged in battle fair and softely / without any noise or
light And caused all the archers to be ready raynged before them / in such a
place: where as they thought the frenchmen should come / if they were in
purpose to come and fight with them. And when they had stand thus the space of
two houses / and saw that none came to them / they had great marueyle. Than
the duke demanded of the lords about him / what was best for him to do? Some
said one thing / some said another every man after his opinyon. Than the duke
said to sir Water of Manny: sir how say you? Sir said he / I can not tell what
I should say. But sir and ye should do after mine opinyon / ye should ordain
your men of arms and archers in manner of battle / and ever little and little
to auau^ce forward. For sir / anon it will be day light: than shall you se
perfitely before you. The duke agreed to this counsel / how be it some other
counsayled to the contrary: for in no wise they would have the duke to remove
fro his field. So in this strife they were together a certain space / at last
it was ordained / y^ certain of sir Robert of Namures company / and certain
of sir Ualeran de Bromes company should mount a horse back / because they were
mete and able for such an enterprice. And so a.xxx. of the best horsemen
deperted and rode toward the french host. Than again ser Galtyer of Manny
said to the duke: sir / never believe me without the frenchmen be fled.
Therefore mount on your horse and all your company / and follow them quickly:
and ye shall have this day on them a fair journey. Than the duke said: Sir /
I have hitherto always followed the advise of my counsel / and ever will ^o:
but I can never believe that so many valyant men of arms / and noble knights
that be here of the french party / would thus shamfully depart. For
parauenture / the fyers that they have made / is to draw us to ward them: and
so to begyle us. Anon our currours will come in / and they will bring us the
perfyte knowledge of every thing.

ANd as they were thus talking / their currours came in / and said to the
purpose of sir Gaultyer of Ma^ny: and showed all that they had seen and found.
They said how they found no body / but certain poor vitaylers / such as
followed the host. Than sir Gaultier of Manny had great honor of his opinyon
before. Than the duke of Lancastre drew to his lodgyng / and unarmed him: and
thought to have gone and dyned in the french men's lodgings (saving for the
fire and smoke that they had made / would not suffer him) but at night he went
thither to supper and lodged there all night / and took their ease with such as
they had. The next morning they dislodged and returned to Calays / and when
the duke of Burgoyne dysloged / he went the same day to saint Omers / and there
lay and all his host. And than deperted every man whyder they would / which
was a great pain after to bring together again. The same weke the earl of
Penbroke being in Poyctou / and had great displeasure that sir Loys of Sanxere
/ sir Johan of Uyen / sir John^ of Bulle and other had so dealt with him before
at Puyernon as it has b^ the wed before / than he thought to be revenged if he
might. And departed fro Mortayne with his company / with a two hundred spears
and so came to Angolesme to the prince / who made him great there. The earl
desired him / to let him have a certain no^bre of men / and to have leave to
make a journey. Saying how he had great desire to revenge him of the dispites
that the frenchmen had done to him of late. The price who loved him entierly
granted his desire. the same season there was newly come to the price fro the
county of Armynake sir Hugh Caurell / and had brought with him moo than five
hundred men of war of the companyons. The prince commanded him to go with the
earl of Penbroke in that journey: and also the earl desired sir Loys Harcourt /
sir Guyssharde Dangle sir Percyuale of Coloyne the lord of Po^s the lord of
Parteney / the lord of Pynan / sir Thomas Percy / sir Thomas Pontchardon / and
diverse other knights of the princes house. who gladly granted to go with him.
So wha^ they were all together / they were a five. C. speres / three hundred
archers / and fyftene hundred of other men in manner of brigantes / with lances
and pauesses / following the host a foot. Thus therle of Penbroke deperted
with his company / and rodeso long that he ra^e into Aniou: than he began to
brenne / wast / and distroy the country. And so passed through on the one side
brennynge and winnynge of towns and small holds / and raunsomed the plain
country to Savior on Loyre. And lodged in the subbarbes / and assailed the
town / but they could not get it / for within was sir Robert of Sanxere / who
kept and defended the town / but all the country about was brent and
distroyed. Than (...) Hughe Caurell and his company came to a bridge on the
river of Loyre / called the bridge of See / and anon they that kept it were
disco^fyted and the bridge won. And than they for ^^yed it in such wise /
that they kept it long after. And also in the same journey the englysshmen took
and wanne an abbey on the river of Loyre / called saint More. the whith they
newly fortifyed in such wise / that they made thereof a great garyson / the
which greatly domaged the country / all the winter and somer after.

THe same time there was in Poyctou an abbey / and is yet called saint Saluyn /
a(...)even leages fro Poycters / in the which abbey there was a monk that
greatly hated his super your the abbot / and that he showed well / for because
of the hatred yt he had to him / he betrayed the abbot and all his coue^t. For
by his means he delivered the abbey and the town to sir Loys of saint Julyan
/ and to Carnet the breton / who took it in the french kings name / and
repeyred it / and made there a good garysone. Of the taking of saint Saluyn /
sir Johan Chandos was sore displeased / because he was seen / shall of Poictou.
And he thought to himself / that if he lived long to get it again /
howesoeuer he did: and that they that had taken it should repent it. Now
let us a little season leave spekyng of the business of Poictou / and speak of
the duke of Lancastre.

How the country of Uerma^doise and the county of saint Poule were wasted /
and sir Hugh of Chastellone taken. Cap. CC.lxix.
When the duke of Lancaster was come again to Calays after the departing fro
Tornehen / and that he and his company had refresshed the^ there a three days /
thanne he thought again to ride forth and make some journey into France. Than
y^ two marshals / therle of Warwyke / and the lord Roger Beauchampt /
commanded every man to draw into the field / whereof every man was glad /
desyringe to ride in to France. Than they departed fro Calays in good order
for every man knew what he should do. So y^ first day they went five leages /
and the next day they came before saint Omers / and there had a great
scrimysshe at the gate / but the^glysshmen rested not there greatly / but passed
by and went and lodged on the morres of Hersault. And on the third day they
came to Turwyn / and within the town was therle Guy of saint Poule with a
great no^bre of men of war. And thenglisshmen passed by and took the way to
Hedyn / and yt day they loged on a little river. And when the earl of saint
Poule saw yt thenglysshmen went toward his country / he knew well they went
not thither for his profit / for they hated him much. Than he departed in the
night / and delivered the cite to the lord of saint Pie / and to sir Johan of
Ray / and so he rode till he came to the town of saint Poule. And in the next
morning the englisshe men came thither / and made there a great skrymysshe /
so that the coming thither of the earl of saint Poule was happy for them of
y^ town / for by him and his company the town was kept and saved / or else it
had been in a great adventure of lesyng. Thus the duke of Lancastre and his
company took their pleasure in the cou^tie of saint Poule / and burned and
exiled all the plain country / and did there great damage / and he was before
the castle of Perides / where as the lady of Dowaire was / and as the duke
aduysed the castle / he gauged ye depnesse of the dyche with a spear / how be
it he assyed it not / but made a good face so to do / and so passed by / and
came to a fair castle called Lucheu / the which perteyned to the earl of
saint Poule / and so they burned the town / and did nothing to the castle.
Than they passed further / and came to saint Require The englisshemen rode on a
day not past a.iii. or four leages / but ever they burned the country as they
went / and so they passed the river of Sum at the planchesse under Abbeuille.
And than they entered into the country of Uimeu / in purpose to go to Harfle we
on the river of Seyne to burn the french Navy. The earl of saint Poule / and
ser Moreau of Fiennes constable of France with a great nombre followed and
pursued in costynge the english hust / wherefore ye englisshemen durst not
ride far abroad out of the high way / but ever kept themself close to
gether ready to fight with their enemies if need were. And so thus they rode
through Uimeu and the county of Ewe / and entered into y^ archeby sshopryke of
Roan / and passed by Deep / and rode so long that they came to Harflewe / and
there lodged. The earl of saint Poule was gote^ before them / and was entered
into y^ town with.ii. C. spears. So thus the englisshmen lay before Harflewe
/ but they assailed it not. The.iiii. day after they dislodged / and made
their return through the land of the lord of Stouteuille / and so burned up
the most part of all his country. and than they came through Francquesin /
and drew toward. Oysemont to repasse the river of Sum at Blanchetache. The
same season there was in the town of Abuille (as captain there) Hugh of
Chastellon master of the crosbowes in France / and when he perceived that the
duke of Lancastre would repasse the river of sum / he armed him / and caused
a.x. or.xii. of his company in like wise to arm them / and no mo. And so
mounted on their horses / saying / how he would go and se the keeping of the
gate of Rowray / to thentent that if thenglisshmen passed by / they should not
se but that it were well kept. This was early in the morning / and it was a
great mist. And the same time / Sir Nicholas Louuaing / who in time paste
before had been seneschall of Poictou / and the same year before ser Hugh of
Chastellon had taken him prisoner / and raunsomed him at.x. M. fra^kes / the
which stacke sore in his mind / and had great desire in his intent to be
revenged / and to geat again that he had lost. The same morning he and.xx.
with him were departed fro the duke of La^castres host / he knew right well all
the passages and straytes there about / for he had well used them the space
of.ii. or.iii. years to gether. And so thought to put him self at adventure
in a busshement bitwene Abbeuille and the castle of Rouuray / and so passed by
a little straight way through a maryse / and rested him in certain old wast
and broken howses / a man would never have thought that any company of
englisshemen would have lain in a busshement so nere to the town. So thus
there / this ser Nicholas and his company kept them self preuy. And so at
last through ye same way came ser Hugh of Chastellon with x. with him / all
armed except his bassenet / the which his page bare after him on a great
courser / and so passed over the little river that was there / and thought to
have gone to have spoken with the crosbowes that kept the gate / to know if
they had hard any thing of the englisshemen. And when sir Nicholas of
Louuayng saw him / he knew him well / he could not have been more joyous if one
had given him.xx. thousand frankes. Than he came out of his busshement and said
to his company / come on syrs lustely / behold yonder is he that I desire to
have / it is the master of the crosbowes / I desire to have him above all
creatures living. Than he set the spores to his horse sides / and cowched his
spear in the rest and came toward sir Hugh of Chastellon and said yield the
Chastellon or thou art but deed. Sir Hugh had great marvel from whens those
men of war came so suddenly upon him: for he had no leaser to put on his
bassenet / nor to mount on his courser. and wha^ he saw he was in so hard a
case / he said / to whom should. I yield me / Sir Nicholas answered / to
Lauuainge. Than sir Hugh (to eschew ye perel of death / for he saw well he
could not flee) said / I yield me. Than he was taken and sir Nicholas said
come on and ride with us / behold yonder comes the duke of Lancaster and his
company / who will pass here foreby. at the same brunt there was slain a
valya^t burgresse of Abuyle called Laurence Dancons / the which was great
damage. Thus by great fortune was sir Hugh of Chastellon master at y^ time of
the crosbowes in france and capitayn of Abuyle / taken by sir Nicholas of
Louuayne of whose taking the duke of Lancastre was right joyful and so were
all the englysshmen. Sir Hugh of Chastellons friends / and y^ men in the town
of Abuyle were right sorry for his taking but they could not amend it as at
that time. Than the englysshmen passed the river of Some at blanchtache / and
than drue toward the town of Rue on the sea side / and so to Monstrell: and
did somoche by their journeys that they returned again and ca^e to the town
of Calays. And than the duke of Lancastre gave all the strangers leave to
deperte / and so deperted fro him sir Robert of Namure / sir Ualeran of Borme /
and the almayns. Than y^ duke of Lancastre returned again in to England
thynkyng to make no more war till the next somer / for it was as tha^ about
saint Martyns day in winter / but or he deperted he said to the strangers /
how that when he came again he would come much more stronger / than he did
at that time. Desyring his cosyns / the duke of Guerles and the duke of
Jullyers / to come and mere with him to go into France. Now let us leave to
speak of the business of Picardy / for there was nothing done in those perties
of a great season after. And let us now speak of the matter in Poitou / where as
most deeds of arms fell.

How sir John Cha^dos was slain in a battle / and how finally the frenchmen
were diso^fyted and taken in the same battle. Cap. CC.lxx.
GReatly it grieved sir John^ Chandos the taking of saint Saluyn / because it
was under his rule / for he was seneshall of Poyctou. He set all his mind how
he might recover it again / other byforce or by stelthe / he cared not so he
might have it. and for that ente^r diverse nights he made su^drie busshme^tes /
but it aueyled not. For sir Loyes who kept it / took ever so good head thereto /
that he defended it fro all dangers. For he knew well the taking thereof grieved
sore sir Johan Chandos at the heart. So it fell / that the night before the
first day of January / sir Johan Chandos being in Poycters / sent to assemble
together diverse barons / knights and squiers of Poitou. Desyring the^ to come
to him as privily as they could: for he certeyned the^ how he would ride forth
/ and they refused not his desire / for they loved him entyerly / but shortly
assembled together in the cite of Poicters. Thither came sir Guysshard Da^gle /
sir Loyes Harcourt / the lord of Pons / the lord of Partney / y^ lord of
Pynan / y^ lord tanyboton / sir Geffray Dargenton / sir Maubruny of Lyniers /
sir Thomas Percy / sir Baudwyn of Fesuyll / sir Richard of Pontchardon and
diverse other. And when they were all together assembled / they were three hundred
speates / and departed by night fro Poicters none knew whyder they should go:
except certain of the lords / and they had ready with them scalyng ladders /
and so came to saint Saluyn. And there a lighted / and delivered their horses to
their varlettes which was about mydnight / and so entered in to the dyke. yet
they had not their entente so shortly / for suddenly they herd the watch
horn blow. I shall tell you wherefore it blewe. The same night Carlonet was
departed fro the Roche of Poisay / with a.xl. spears with him. And was come
the same time to saint Saluyn / to speak with the captain sir Loys of saint
Julyan / to thentent to have ryden together to Poictou / to se if they could
get any pray. And so he called up the watchman / y^ which made him to sound
his horn. And so the englysshmen / who were on the othersyde of the fortress
/ herynge the watch blow / and great noise in the place. Feared lest they had been spyed by some spies / for they knew nothing that the said frenchemen were
on the other side / to have entered in to the place. Therefore they with drue
back again out of the dykes / and said: let us go hens for this night for we
have failed of our purpose. And so they remou^ted on their horses / and
returned hole together to Chauuigny on the tyuer of Cruse / a two leages thens.
Than the poictenyns demanded of sir John^ Chandos / if he would command them
any farther service / he answered and said. Sirs / return home again when it
please you / in the name of god: and as for this day / I will abide still here
in this town. So there departed the knights of Poictou and some of England to
the nombre of. CC. spears. Than sir Johan Cha^dos went into a house / and
caused to be made a good fire / and there was still with him: sir Thomas Percy
and his company scneshall of Rochell / who said to sir John^ Chandos. Sir is it
your intent to tarry here all this day. ye truly sir (...) he / why demand
you. Sir / y^ cause I desire you is / sith ye will not styre this day to give
me leave / and I will ride some way with my company / to se if I can find any
adventure. Go yoway sir in the name of god (...) sir Johan Chandos. And so
departed sir Thomas Percy with a.xxx. spears in his company / and so passed
the bridge at Chauuigny / and took the long way that led to Poicters. And
sir John^ Cha^dos abode still behind full of displeasure / in that he had
failed of his purpose / and so stood in a kechyn warmyng him by the fire. And
his servants tangeled with him / to the^tent to bring him out of his
melancoly. His servants had prepared for him a place to rest him / than he
demanded if it were nere day. And there with there ca^e a man in to the house /
and came before him and said. Sir / I have brought you tidings. What be they
tell me? Sir surely the frenchmen be ryding abroad. How know thou that? ser
said he / I deperted fro saint Saluyn with them what way be they ryden? Sir I
can not tell you the certentie: but surely they took the high way to Poiters.
What frenchmen be they? can thou tell me. Sir it is sir Loys of saint Julyan
/ and Carlonet the breton. Well (...) sir Johan Chandos I care not / I have no
list this night to ride for the: they may hap to be encou^tred though I be
not there. And so he tarried there still a certain space in a great study / and
at last when he had well aduysed himself / he said. Whatsoever I have said
here before / I trow it be good that I ride for the / I must return to
Poicters and anon it will be day. That is true ser / (...) the knights about
him. Than he said make ready for I will ride forth / and so they did and
mounted on their horses / and deperted and took the right way to Poicters
costyng the river / and the frenchmen y^ same time were not past a leag before
him in the same way / thinkyng to pass the river at the bridge of Lusar. There
the englysshmen had knowledge how they were in the trake of the frenchmen / for
the fre^chmens horses cried and brayed / because of the^glysshe horses / y^
were before the^ with sir Thomas Percy. And anon it was fair light day / for
in the beginning of January the mornings be soon light And when the frenchmen
and bretons were within a leage of the bridge / they perreyued on the othersyde
of the bridge sir Thom^s Percy and his company: and he likewise perreyued the
frenchmen and rode as fast as he might / to get the advantage of the bride. And
said / behold yonder frenchmen be a great nombre against us / therefore let us
take the aua^tage of the bridge. And wha^ sir Loys and Carlonet / saw
the^glysshmen make such have to get the bridge / they did in likewise.
Howbeit the^glysshmen gate it first / and lighted all a foot / and so raynged
themself in good order to defend the bridge. The frenchmen likewise lighted a
foot / and delivered their horses to their pages / co^maundynge them to draw a
back. And so did put the^ self in good order to go and assail the^glysshmen
/ who kept themself close togider / and were nothing afraid: though they were
but a handful of men / as to y^ regard of the frenchmen. and thus as the
frenchmen and bretous stuyed and ymagined / how and by what means to their
advantage / they might assail the englisshmen. Therewith there came behynd the^
sir Johan Chandos / his baner displayed / berynge therein silver a sharp pyle
goules. and Jakes of Lery / a valyant man of arms did bear it / and he had
with him a.xl. spears: he aproched fiersly the frenchmen. And when he was a
three forlonges fro the bridge / the french pages who saw them coming were
afraid / and so ran away with the horses / and left their maists there a foot.
And when sir John^ Chandos was come nere to them / he said: hark ye frenchmen
ye are but yuell men of war. ye ride at your pleasur and ease day and night /
ye take and wyn towns and foteresses in Poyctou / whereof I am seneshall. ye
ransom poor folk without my leave / ye ride all about clean armed: it
should seem the country is all yours. But I ensure you it is not so. ye sir
Loyes and Carlonet / year to great masters. It is more than a year and a half
that I have set all mine intent to find or encountre with you / and now I
thank god I se you and speak to you / no we shall it be seen who is stronger
other you or I. It has been showed me often times / that ye have greatly
desired to find me / now ye may se me here. I am John^ Chandos advise me
well. your great feats of arms wherewith ye be renowned / by gods leave no
we shall we prove it. While such langage was spoken / sir John^ Chandos
company drew toguyder / and sir Loyes and Carloner kept them self close
together / making sembla^t to be glad to be fought withal. And of all this
matter sir Thomas Percy / who was on the othersyde of the bridge knew nothing
/ for the bridge was high in the mids / so that none could se other. While
sir Johan Chandos reasoned thus with the frenchmen / there was a breton took his
glayue and could for bear no le^ger / but ca^e to an english squire / called
Sunekyn Dodall / and struck him so in the breast yt he cast him down fro his
horse. Sir John^ Cha^dos when he herd ye noise beside him / he turned that
way / and saw his squire lie on the earth and the frenchmen layeng on him. Tha^
he was more chafed tha^ he was before / and said to his company. Sirs / how
suffer you this squire thus to be slain: a foot / a foot. And so he lepte a
foot and all his company / and so Sunekyn was rescued and the battle begone.
Sir Johan Cha^dos / who was a right hardy and a coragyous knight / with his
baner before him / and his company about him with his cote of arms on him /
great and large beten with his arms of white sarcenet / with two pylies goules
/ one before and an other behind / so that he seemed to be a sufficyent knight
/ to do a great feate of arms / and as one of the formast with his glayue in
his hand / marched to his enemies. The same morning there had fallen a great
dew / so that the ground was some what moist / and so in his going forward he
stood and fell down at ye joining with his enemies. and as he was arysing /
there light a stroke on him / given by a squier called Jakes of saint Martyn
with his glayue / the which stroke entered in to ye flesh under his eye /
between ye nose and the forheed. Sir John^ Chandos saw not the stroke coming
on that side / for he was blind on ye one eye. He lost ye sight thereof a five
year before as he hunted after an heart / in the laundes of Burdeaur. And also
he had on no vyser / the stroke was rude and entered into his brain / the
which stroke grieved him so sore / that he ouerthrue to the earth / and turned
for pain two times up so down / as he that was wounded to death. for after
the stroke he never spoke word. And when his men saw that mysfortune / they
were right dolorouse. Tha^ his uncle Edward Clifforde stepte and bestrode him /
for the frenchmen would feign have had him: and defended him so valyantly / and
gave round about him such stokes that none durst aproche nere to him. Also
(...) John^ Chambo / and sir Bertram of Case seemed like men out of their minds
/ when they saw their master lie on ye earth. The bretons and frenchmen were
greatly comforted when they saw the captain of their enemies on ye earth /
thynking verily yt he had his dethes wound. Than they auaunced them self /
and said: ye englyshmen yield you / for ye are all ours. ye can not escape us.
There the englyshmen did marueyls in armers / as well to defend themself / as
to reueng their master sir John^ Chandos / whom they saw lie in a hard
case: and a squire of ser John^ Chandos spyed Jaques of saint Martyn / who
had given his master his mortal stroke / and ran to him fiersly and stroke
him with such voylence / that his glayue pearsed through both his thyes /
how be it for all that stroke he left not still to fight. If sir Thomas Percy
and his company had known of this adventure / who were on the othersyde of ye
brige / they should well have socoured hi: but because they knew nothing
thereof / nor herd no more of the frenchmen / wenyng to them they had been gone
back. Therefore he and his company departed and took the way to Poycters / as
they that knew nothing of that business. Thus the englysshmen fought still
before the bridge of Lusac / and there was done many a feat of arms: breuely
the englysshmen could endure no longer against the frenchmen / so that the
most part of them were disconfyted and taken / but always Edward Clyfforde
would not depte fro his nephue there as he lay. So thus if the frenchmen had been so happy / as to have had their horses there ready as they had not / for
their pages were run away fro them before / orels they might have departed
with much honor and profit with many a good prisoner / and for lack of them
they lost all / wherefore they were sore displeased / and said among them self.
A / this is an yuell order for the journey is ours / and yet through fault of
our pages we can not depart. Seeing we be heavy armed and sore traueyled / so
that we ca^nat go a foot through this country / the which is full of our
enemies / and contrary to us. And we are a six leages fro the next forteresse
that we have / and also diverse of our company be sore hurt / and we may not
leave them behind us. Thus as they were in this case and wist not what to do
/ and had sent two bretons unarmed in to the feldes / to se if they might find
any of their pages with their horses. There came on them sir Guyssharde Dangle /
sir Loyes Harcourt / the lord Parteney / the lord Tanyboton / ye lord
Dargenton / the lord of Pynan / sir Jaques of Surgyers and diverse other
englysshmen / to the no^bre of two hundred spears / who rode about to seek for
the frenchmen / for it was showed them how they were abroad. And so they fell
in the trake of the horses / and ca^e in great have with baners and penons
wauyng in the wind. And as soon as the bretons and frenchmen saw them coming
they knew well they were their enemies. Tha^ they said to the englysshmen /
whom they had taken as prisoners before. Sirs / behold yonder comes a band
of your company to socour you / and we perceive well that we can not endure
against the^ / and yebe out prisoners. We will quyte you / so that ye will keep
us and will become your prisoners / for we had rather yield us to you / tha^ to
them that comes yonder / and they answered as ye will / so are (...)e
content. Thus the englysshmen were losed out of their prisons. Than the
poictenyns / gascoyns / and englysshmen came on them their spears in their
restes / cryeng their cries. Than the frenchmen and bretons drew a side / and
said to the^. sirs leave do us no hurt / we be all prisoners a ready. The
englysshmen affirmed the same / and said: they be our prisoners. Carlonet was
prisoner with sir Bertram of Case / and sir Loyes of saint Julyan with sir
Johan Cambo / so that there was none but that he had a master.

UHe barowns and knights of Poicto^^ were sore disconforted / when they saw
their seneschall sir Johan Chandos lie on the earth / and could not speak: than
they lamentably complained / and said. A / sir Johan Chandos: the flower of all
chiualry / unhappily was that glayue forged that thus has wounded you and
brought you in parell of death. They wept piteously that were about him / and
he herd and understood them well / but he could speak no word. They wrong
their hands and tare their heeres / and made many a pytefull complaynt / and
specially such as were of his own house. Than his servants unarmed him and
laid him on pauesses / and so bare him softely to Mortymer the next forteresse
to them. And the other barons and knights returned to Poycters / and led
with them their prisoners. And as I understood / the same Jaques Martyn yt thus
hurt sir Johan Chandos / was so little taken head to of his hurtes / that he
dyed at Poiters. And this noble knight sir Johan Chandos / lived not after his
hurt / past a day and a night / but so dyed: god have mercy on his soul / for
in a hundred year after / there was not a more curtesse nor more fuller of noble
virtues / and good condycions among the englysshmen / than he was. And when
the prince and pricesse / the earl of Cambridge / the earl of Pe^broke / and
other barowns and knights of England / such as were in Guyen herd of his
death / they were all (...)orted / and said: they had lost all on that side of
the sea. For his death his friends / and also some of his enemies / were right
soroufull The englysshmen loved him / because all noble nesse was found in
him. The frenchmen hated him / because they douted him. yet I herd his death
greatly complained among right noble and valyant knights of France. Saying
that it was a great dommage of his death / for they said better it had been /
that he had been taken a live. For if he had been taken a live / they said he was
so sage and so ymaginatyue / that he would have found some manner of good
means / whereby the peace might have ensued / between the realms of England
and France / for he was so well-beloved with the king of England / that the
king would believe him / rather than any other in the world. Thus bothefrenche
and english spoke of his death / and specially the englysshmen: for by him
Guyen was kept and recovered.

How the lord of Coucy / and the lord of Pomyers would not enter in to the
war / another on the one part nor on the other. And how the lord of Maleuall
and the lord of Marneyle turned french. Cap. CC.lxxi.
AFter the death of sir Johan Chandos / sir Thomas Percy was made seneschall of
Poictou. and so it fell that the land of saint Savior the vycount / fell in
the king of Englandes ^andes to give where it should please him. Than he g^^e it
to a knight of his / called sir Alayne Bourchier / an expert man of arms. Of
all that sit Johan Chandos had / which was in yearly to uenewes / to the sum
of four hundred thousand frankes. The prince was his successessour and heir /
for he was never married nor had none heirs. And within a certain space after
such as had been taken at the bridge of Lusac were put to their fynance and
rau^some / and paid it: by the aid and help of the french king. And so
returned again into their garysons / sir Loyes of saint Julyan / Carlonet the
breton / and sir Wyllyam of Bourdes. The same season there were some knights of
France / that were fore troubled in their mind / because they saw thus nightly
and daily / the war multiply between these two kings / of France and
England. And specially the lord of Concy / for it touched him greatly: for he
had fair enherytance in England / as well by him self as by his wife / who
was daughter to the king of England. Which land he must renounce / if he
would serve the french king (of whose blood he was) and of the same nacyon.
So he determined him self to dissemble with both kings / and so to forget
the time / he thought to depart out of the realm of France for a season and
go and sport him in some otherplace. And so ordered his departure sagely / and
took leave of the french king / and with a small company departed and rode in
to Sauoy / where he was honorably received / of the earl / barons and knights
of the country. And when he had (...) there as long as it pleased him / than he
departed and passed forth in to Lombardy / and came to the lords of Myllayne:
the lord Galeas and the lord Barnabo / where he was at the beginning to them
right welcome. In like manner departed out of the duchy of Acatayne / sir Aymon
of Pomyers / a knight of the prices: saying how that as long as the war did
endure he would not bear arms / another on the one part nor on the other. And
so this knight went in to Cypre / and to the holy sepulcre and diverse other
pylgrimages. And also the same season / there was newly come to Paris sir Johan
of Burbone / who held part of his land of the prince. The french king
would gladly have had him to renounce his homage to the prince / and to become
french: but the earl in no wise would so do. In like manner no more would the
lord of Pyerbuffier / another baneret of Lymosyn / who also was at Paris. But
there were other two great barons of Lymosyn / sir Loyes of Maleuall / and sir
Raymon of Marneyle his nephue / who also ye same season were at Paris they
forsook the prince and became french. And after by their garysons made great
war to the prince / whereof the king of England and his counsel were sore
displeased And also in that diverse barons of Guyen became french without any
constraynt / but by their own wylles. Than the king of England was counsayled
/ that he should write covert letters sealed with his seal / and to be borne
by two or three of his knights in to Poictou / and in to Acquitayne: and there
to publysshe them In cities / castles / and good towns. The same season was
delivered out of prison in Dagen / sir Camponell of Camponall in excha^ge / for
another knight of the princes / who had been taken at a scrimysshe before
Pyergourt / called ser Thomas Balaster / but the clerk yt was with the said
knight / remained still in prison in Dagen: and sir Camponell returned in to
France. Now let us speak of the letters sent in to Acquitayne / by the king
of England: the tenor whereof herafter follows.

The copy of the letters / sent by the king of England into Acquitayne. And
how Chasteleraut was taken / and Bell perch besieged by the frenchemen. Cap.

THese letters were brought fro the king of England into the principalyte and
duchy of Acqtayne / and notifyed and publysshed all about. And the copyes sent
secretly into Paris / to the vycont of Rochchoart / the lord Ma leuall the
lord of Marneyle / and to other such as were turned french. Nowbeit for all
y^ these letters were thus sent and publysshed / in all the country of
Acqtayne / I herd not that any for all that left to do as they list. So that
not with standing / daily they turned to the french perte. And so it was /
that as soon as sir Loys of saint Julyan was returned in to the Roche of Poy
say and sir Wyllm^ of Bordes in to the garrison of the Hay in Tourayn / and
Carlon et to saint Saluyn. Than secretly they made forth a journey of me^ of
arms and hardy co^panyons well mounted / and in a morning they came to
Chasteleraut and scaled the town / and had nerehand taken sir Loys of Harcourt
/ who lay in his bed a sleep in his logyng in the town. And so with the s^ry /
he was feign to fly in his sherte barefote and barelegged / fro house to house
/ fro garden to garden / in great dout and fear of taking by the frenchmen /
who had scaled and won the fortress. And so ferr he sledde / that he ca^e and
put him self under the bridge of Chasteleraut the which his men had fortifyed
before. and so there he saved him self / and kept him self there a long space.
But thus the bretons and frenchmen were masters of ye town / and there made a
good garrison / and made Carlonet capitayn. And daily the bretons and frenchmen
went to the bridge / and fought and scrimysshed with them that kept it.

DUke Loyes of Burbon / who saw well that the englysshmen and companyons were
in his country of Burbonoise. And how that Drtygo / Bernard de Wist / and
Bernard de la Sale / held his castle at Bell perch / and the good lady his
mother wtin: whereof he had great displeasur. Than he aduysed hi to make a
journey and to go and lay siege to Bell percly and not to deperte thens / till
he had won it. Of the which enterprice / he desired the french king to
give him leave / which the king lightly agreed unto: saying how he would
help him to maynteyne his siege. Thus he departed fro Paris / and made his
assemble at Molyns in Auuerne / and at saint Porcyns: so that he had a great
nombre of men of war. The lord of Beauieu came to serve him with three
hundred spears / and ye lord Uyllers and Rosellon with a hundred spears /
and diverse other barowns and knights of Auuergne and Forestes / where of he was
lord by right of his wife / daughter to the gentle lord Berault earl
Dolphyn. So thus the duke went and laid siege to Bell perch / and made before
it a great bastyd / for his m^n daily to draw in to under covert: and so daily
scrimysshed with the^ that were within. Also the duke had there four great
engines / the which cast night and day great stones / so that the toopes of the
towers and houses were beaten down and a great part of the towers. Whereof the
dukes mother who was prisoner within had great fear. And sent out messangers to
the duke her son / desyringe him to cease his assantes / for thengins sore
feared and troubled her. But the duke of Burbone / who knew well that her
request and desire was done / by the means of his enemies. Answered / that
in no wise he would cease nor forbere what soever fell. And when they within
saw / how they were so sore oppressed / and how that the strength of ye
frenchemen daily multiplied. For to them was newly come sir Loyes of Sanrer /
marshall of France / with great plenty of men of war. Than they determined
to give knowledge of their poor estate to sir Johan Deureux / seneshall of
Lymosyn / who lay at Soubterayne a two little tourneys fro the^ / and to
certifye him how the lords of Poictou and of Gascoyne / when they departed
fro them at the journey of Quercy promised them on their faythes / that if they
took any fortress in France / and after to be besieged: how they should be
comforted. Thus inco^tynent they wrote letters / and secretly by night they
sent a varlet out of ye forteresse to sir John^ Deureur / and when the
messa^ger came to him / he remembered well the matter / by such tokens as he
showed him. And when he had reed the letters / he said: he would gladly aid
and help them / and the rather to sped^: said he would go him self to
Angolesme to the prince and to the lords that be there: trustyng so to enduse
the^ that they of Bell perch should be conforted / and delivered out of
parell. And so he departed fro his fortress / and rode so long that he came
to Angolesme / where he found the prince / the earl of Cambridge / therle of
Pe^broke / sir John^ Montagu / sir Robert Canoll sir Thomas Percy / sir Thomas
Phelton / sir Guyssharde Dangle / the Captal of Beufz and diverse other. There to
them he sagely showed / how the companyons were besieged in the castle of
Bell perch / by the duke of Burbon / the earl of saint Poule / and other
frenchmen. To the which words ye lords gave good heryng and said: how
gladly they would comfort them / acordyng as they had promised. Of this enter
price were chief the earl of Cambridge and the earl of Penbroke. And
incontinent the prince sent out his commandment / that all his subgettes
after the sight of his letts / should in all have draw to the town of
Lymoges. So than thyderwarde auaunsed / knights and squyers / co^panyons / and
other men of arms / and so came thither as they were commanded. And when they
were assembled / they were mo than. xv C. spears / and three thousand of other
men of war And so quickly they passed for the that they ca^e to Bell perch /
and lay on the othersyde of the town against the frenchmen / who lay and kept
still their bastyde / the which was as strong / and as well fortified and
as well enuyroned as a town. So that thenglisshe foragers wist not whyder to
resort for any forage / howbeit they had some vitayls brought fro Poyctou /
when they might convey it. Than sir Loys of Sanxere marshall of France /
signified the state of thenglysshmen to Paris to ye king / and to the knights
that were there / and made writings and seadules to be set up on the pales /
and in other places saying thus. Among you knights and squyers / desyring to
find deeds of arms we certifye you for truth / that the earl of Ca^bridge
and therle of Penbroke and their company / ar come before Bell perch / to
thentent to reyse the siege there laid by our men / who there so long has
endured pain. and we have so co^streyned them within the forteresse / that of
pure necessyte they must other yield it up / or else fight with us byforce of
arms. Therefore come thither hastily / for there shall ye find noble deeds of
arms. And certainly the^glysshmen lie but in small order / and ar in such a
place that they might soon have great damage. Thus by exortacion of the
marshall / diverse good knights of the realm of France / auaunsed them to
that part. How beit I knew well that the governor of Bloyes / Allart of
Toustayne with a.l. spears came thither / and so did therle of Porcyen / and
sir Hugh of Porcien his brother.

How therle of Ca^bridge and the earl of Penbroke / led a way fro the
garyson of Bell Perch / the duke of Burbons mother / and all those that were
within. Cap. CC.lxxiii.
When the earl of Ca^bridge and the earl of Penbroke had been thus before ye
frenchmen the space of.xv. days / and saw how they would not issue out of
their bastyde to fight with the^. Than they took counsel and advise to send
to them an heraulde / to know what they would do: and so they sent Chandos the
heraude with the message that he should say to them / and so he went to them and
said. Sirs my lords and masters has sent me to you / and they would ye know
by me / yt they are all greatly marueyled: sithe that ye have perfyte know led
how they have been here the space of fyftene days before you / and yet ye would
not issue out of your strayte to fight with the^. Therefore they send you word
by me / that if ye will come out toward the^ / they will suffer you to take a
plot of ground to fight on with them. And than let the^ have the vyctorie that
god will send it unto. Than the duke of Burbon said: Cha^dos you shall say to
your masters / yt we will not fight with the^ at their wylles / nor
apoyntment. And I know well that they be yonder / but I will not depart hens
/ nor break up my siege. till I have won the castle of Bell Perch. Sir quod
the heraude / I shall show them your pleasure. Than departed the heraud / and
returned to his masters / and showed them the answer / y^ which was nothing
pleasant to them. Than they went to counsel / and after they said again to
Chandos / go again to yonder lords and show them this wise / and so declared
to him his message. And than he went for the / and when he came to them / he
said. Lords: my masters and lords sends you word by me / that sith ye
will not fight. Surely they purpose the.iii. day hens / at the hour of.ix. or
at noone to set a horseback the lady of Burbone / and to convey her away in
the sight of you / my lord of Burbone her son. And sir / than they bydde you
rescue her and if ye can. Well quod the duke / to se my lady my mother led
away / shall be to me right displeasant. how beit we trust to have her again
when we may. And sir heraud sith ye have said this mocheto us / say again to
your masters / that if they will put into ye field afyftie of their company /
we shall put to them as many: and than take the vyctorie who may get it. Sir
quod the heraude / I shall show them all that ye have said. And therewith
Cha^dos departed and came again to therle of Cambridge and to the other lords
/ showing them the duke of Burbons answer / and also his demand. How beit
they thought not so to do / but ordained to depart thens and to lead with
them the lady of Burbon / and all they within the for teresse / who had been
sore traueyled with the engens of the host.

How the duke of Burbone gave leave to all his men / when he knew that the
good lady his mother was led away. Cap. CC.lxxiiii.
When the day ca^e / that they had set / in the morning they sowned all their
tru^pettes. Than they armed them and all their company / and drew in to the
field in good array of battle / a foot and a horseback ready to fight / their
baners and sta^dardes before the^. And at the hour of.ix. their mynstrels
blewe up on high. Than they voyded out of the castle of Bell preche all manner
of men and the lady of Burbone they mounted on a (...)rey well dressed for her
/ and her ladies and damoselss with her. Than the englysshmen departed about
noone / and on the lady awayted sir Eustace Da^breticourt / and sir John^
Deureux. And so drew them in to the principalyte and the lady was prisoner a
certain space after: among the companyons in the Roche Ua^cloyre in Limosyn /
but with her taking the prince was never well content / for when soever the
case was spoken of / he said yt if any other men had taken her beside the
co^panyons / he would incontinent have caused her to have been delivered without
delay. And when the companyons that had her / were spoken unto for her
delyuerance / they said that what soever bargayne they made / they would have
for her their knight again sir Simon Burle / who was prisoner among the
frenchmen.

IT is not to be douted / but that the duke of Burbone was sore dyspleased that
the englysshmen led away his mother / but anon after she was departed / he
sent to take possession in the castle of Bell perch as his own / the which
the englysshmen had left as than clean void. The duke repaired and new
fortefied the castle / and made it stronger than it was before. Thus brake up
this great journey and every man went to his own / the frenchmen that had been
there with the duke of Burbone / went again to their own garysons. And the
duke returned with his knights and squyers into France to the king / who made
him great chere and was glad of his coming. And therle of Pe^broke and his
company went to the town of Mortaygne in Poictou / and the men of arms and
companyons returned into Poytou and Xaynton / and serched all about the
country to get their lyuenges / and did many villayne deeds / they could not
absteyne them self fro doing of yuell. And anon after departed fro the prince
sir Robert Canoll / and went in to Bretayne to his castle of Doruall / and he
had not ben there past a month / but that the king of England sent to him /
that incontinent without delay all excusacions laid a perte / he should pass
the sea and came in to England to speak with him / which commandment he
would not break but aparelled him self and took the sea / and arrived in
Cornwall at saint Myghels mount. And than rode so long that he came to
wyndsore / where he found the king / who had great joy of his coming / and so
had all the other barons of the realm / by cause they thought they should have
need of him / and that he was a good captain and leader of men.

How the duke of Aniou came fro Tholous to Paris / and how king Charles sent
him to the duke of Berry his brother into Acqtayne against the englysshmen.
Cap. CC.lxxv.
IN this season the duke of Aniou deperted fro Tholous / and rode in great
array through the realm of France / and ca^e to the cite of Paris and there he
found the king his brother / the duke of Berry and the duke of Burgoyne his
other brethren / who received him ioyoully. And so between these four
brethren while they lay at Paris / they had diverse counsayls together / on the
state and business of the realm of France / to se what war they should make
/ and how to maynteyne the same the somer following. Than it was fully
purposed and ordained / that they should make two great armies and journeys into
Acqtayne / whereof the duke of Aniou and his company should govern the one /
and enter in to Guyen / by Ryall and Bergerath. And the duke of Berry should
govern the other army / and enter in by Lymoges and Quercy / and so both
armies to mete before the town of Angolesme: and to besiege the prince within
it. Also it was concluded by great delyberacion of counsel / to send for ser
Bertram of Clesquy that valy a^t knight / who so often and valy antly has fought
/ for the sauegard of the crown of France / and to desire him to take on him
to be constable of France. And when ye king and his brethren had fully
determined their counsel / and had sported the^ a space / till the begynnig of
the month of May. Than the duke of Aniou took leave of the^ all / thinking
first to return into his own country / because he had the longest journey / he
deperted first. He was conveyed by the barons and knights of France / because
he was well-beloved. So long the duke rode yt he came to Mou^tpellyer / and there
tarried more than a month / and than he went to Tholous / and there assembled
together men of war all about / where as he might get the^. and there were many
yt kept the feldes / and kept fronter against the^glyshmen ^n Rouergne and
Quercy / for the little Mechyn and Nandon of Pauns / Perot of Sauoy / the
bourge Camus / Antony lenegre / Lamyt / James of Bray. All these with a great
no^bre were all this season in Caours / and had done much hurt in the country.
The duke of Berry also ca^e to Burges in berry and made there a great assemble
of knights and squyers of France and of Burgoyne. Also the duke of Burbon went
in to his country / and assembled a great no^bre of knights and squiers of the
county of Forest and burbonoise. also sir Peter of Alenson his brother /
provided him self greatly for that war. And in the same season sir Guy of
Bloys was newly returned out of Spruce / where as he had be^ made knight and
raised his baner at a scrimyshe made against the enemies of god. So that as soon
as the gentle knight was returned into Heynault / and herd tidings of this
great journey y^ was toward / by his cosyns into the duchy of Acquitayne. He
purueyed him self greatly to go to yt viage / and so dented out of Heynalt and
went to Paris / and presented him self to the king / who was glad to se him /
and appointed him to go with the duke of Berry / with a certain no^bre of me^
of arms / knights and squiers. And so ser Guy of Bloys deperted fro Paris /
and rode to ward Orlyance / to go into Berry. In like manner as ye french king
ordained his armies / the king of England also set forth two great armies. The
duke of Lancaster was ordained with.iiii. C. men of arms and as many archers /
to go into the duchy of Acqtayne / to comfort and aid his brethren for it was
thought surely / yt in those perties grettest war should be made by the
french king. Also the king of England by thaduyse of his counsel / made
another army to go into Picardy / of the which ser Robr^t Canollshuld be chief
governor: for it was thought he was a knight metely to be ye leder of men of
arms / for he had long time used the war / and seen great experience there in.
Therefore he was desired thus to do / by the king of England: who ioyously
condiscended thereto. And so took on him that voyage / to go to Calays / and so
into France to fight with the frenchmen / if he might mete with the^ in the
field: of the which he thought to be sure. And so he provided for his journey
/ and all such as went with him. In the same season was delivered out of
prison / the duke of Burbons mother in exchange for sir Simon Burle: and ser
Eustace Dambreticourt did help much in that treaty: where of the duke of
Burbone and the french queen thanked him greatly. All this season there had been
great treatyes: between the french king / and the king of Nauarr / who lay
at Chierbourge. And so much did they / that were treaters of the peace
between them / that they showed the french king / that it was than no time for
him to keep war with the king of Navarre / for they said he had enough to do
to keep war against the englisshemen / saying how he were better to let
some what go of his own / rather than any greatter euyls should rise. For if
the king of Navarre should suffer the englysshemen to arryue and pass through
his fortresses of Cloux and of Constantyne / they should thereby greatly grieve
the country of Normandy: which things they said ought greatly to be redoubted
and considered. So much they enduced the king / that he agreed to the peace /
and went to the town of Roan / and there the peace was confyrmed / And to the
king of Nauarr there went the archebysshop of Roan / the earl of Alenson / the
earl of Salebruche / sir Wylliam of Dorma^s / and ser Robert of Lorrys / they
found the king of Nauar at Uernon / there was made great feasts / and tha^ they
brought ye king of Nauarr to Roan to the french king / and there again was
confyrmed all the aliau^ces and confederacions / sworn and put in writing and
under seal / and as I understood the king of Nauar in making of this peace
should renounce all promysses of love that had been / between him and the king of
England / and that after his return again into Nauarr / he should defye the
king of England. and for the more surete of love to be holden and kept bitwene
him and the french king / the king of Nauarr went with yt french king fro
Roan to Paris / and there were again new feasts and sole^pnities. And when
they had enough sported them / tha^ leave was taken / and the king of Nauer
departed amyably fro the french king: and left behind him his two sons with
the king their uncle. And than he went to Mou^tpellyer / and so in to the
county of Foi / and after into his own country of Nauer. Now let us return
to the business of Acqtayne.

How sir Bertram of Clesquy deperted out of Spain and went to Tholous / where
as the duke of Aniou received him ioyously. Ca. CC.lxxvi.
VE shall know as it has been said before / how the duke of Aniou had been in
France / and was agreed / yt as soon as he was returned in to la^guedoc / he
should enter byforce in to Guyen / for he could in no wise love y^ prince nor
thenglyssmen / nor never did. And before his departing / the french king sent
letters with great messangers in to Castle to king Henry. Desyring him to send
in to France sir Bertram of Clesquy: also the king and the duke of Aniou wrote
to sir Bertra^ / that he should find the means to come shortly into France.
So these messangers did their message / and ye king of Spain / thought not to
keep him against the french kings desire / and so would make non excuse. And
so sir Bertra^ of Clesquy made him ready as shortly as he could / and took leave
of king Henry / and did somoche that he came to Tholou / where the duke of Aniou
was / and had there assembled a great nombre of knight / squyers / and men of
war / and tarried for nothing: but the coming of sir Bertram. So that by his
coming the duke and all his / were greatly reioysed / and than they ordained to
de part fro Tholous / and to enter into the prices land. The same season was
come to Ha^pton in England the duke of Lancaster / with.iiii. C. men of arms /
and as many archers / their ships and vessels ready withal their purueyance:
and were in mind to sail to Bourdeaux / so they might have wind. And with
the duke / there was the lord Rose / sir Michell de la poule sir Robert Rouxe
/ sir Johan of saint Low / and sir Wyllyam Beauchampe.

How they of Monsac and of Mou^tpellyer yielded the^ to the duke of Aniou. And
of the duke of Berry / who lay at siege before the city of Lymoges. Cap.
CC.lxxvii.
THan the duke of Aniou deperted fro the cite of Tholou / in great array and in
good order: and with hi there was therle of Armynake the lord Dalbret / therle
of Piergourt / the earl of Comynges / the vycont of Carmayne / y^ earl of Lyle
/ the vycont of Brune Kyell / the vycont of Narbon / the vycont of Talar / the
lord de la barde / the lord of Pyncornet / sir Bertra^ Tande / the
seneshalles of Tholous / Carcassone / and of Beauchair and diverse other. They
were a.ii. M. spears knights and squyers / and vi. M. a foot with lau^ces and
pauesses. And sir Bertram of Clesquy was chief captain of all that company /
and so took the way to Dagenoise. And by the way they found in the feldes mo
than a. M. of the co^panyons / who all that season had been in Quercy / and as
than were rydinge to ward Again. The first forteresse that they came to was
Monsacke / and the country was in such fear / by reason of the coming of
the duke of Iniou with such a great no^bre / that diverse towns and
forteresses trymbled for fear / and were not in will to hold war against
him. And so as soon as they were come before Moysac / they yielded them and
became french: and than they went to Thounyns on the river of Garon. And so
the frenchmen rode at their ease following the river / and so came to the port
saint Mary / the which inco^tynent turned french. And in every place the
frenchmen put in people and made garrisons / and both the town and castle of
Thounyns yielded the^ up and became french and there they set a new captain /
and.xx. spears with him. Than after they took they way to Mou^tpellyer / and
to Iguyllon / brennyng and distroyeng the country. And when they were come to
the good town of Mountpellyer / they within were sore afraid of the duke of
Aniou / and so yielded the^ self up to the french king. Than they went to the
strong castle of Aguyllon / and there they were four days / for within was
sir Gaultyer of Manny and his company: and so yielded him self and the castle
to the duke of Aniou / whereof they of Bergerath had great marueyle / that they
yielded the^ self so soon. Captain within Bergerath was the captall of Beufz
/ and sir Thomas Phelton / with a hundred spears english and gascoyns. And
in like manner as y^ duke of Aniowe and his company were entered in to the
princes land / in the country of Again and Tholousen. Like wise the duke of
Berry / the same time and his company rode in Lymosyn / with a.xii. hundred
spears a horseback / and a three thousand a foot: conquerynge towns and
castles / brennyng and exilyng the country. And with him was the duke of
Burbon / the earl of Alenson / sir Guy of Bloyes / sir Robert of Alenson earl
of Perch / sir John^ Darmynake sir Hugh Dolphyn sir John^ of Uyllemore, the
lord of Beauieu the lord of Uyllers / the lord of Senar / sir Geffray
Mo^tagu / sir Loyes of Malleuall / sir Rayman of Marnell / sir John^ of Boloyne
/ sir Godfray his uncle / the vycont Duzes / the lord of Sully / the lord of
Talenton / the lord of Co^fant / y^ lord Dappecher / the lord Dacon sir
John^ Damenue / ymbault of Peschyn and diverse other good barons / knights and
squyers. These men of arms entered in to Lymosyn / and did there great
(...)uries / and so came and laid siege to Lymoges. Within y^ town there were
a few englyshmenes the which sir Hugh Caurell had left therein garrison / for
he was seneshalll in the country.

THe prince of Wales who was in y^ town of Angoleme / was well informed of
those two great armies / as well of the duke of Aniou / as of the duke of Berry:
and how they were entered with great strength into his country / in two
perties. And also it was showed him how by all likelyhod / they would draw
toward Angoleme / and to besiege him and the princess within the town. The
prince who was a valyant man and ymaginatyfe / answered and said: how his
enemies should not find him closed / another within town nor yet castle / but
said how he would mete the^ in the plain field Than he caused letters to be
written / and sent forth to all his true friends and subgettes: in Poictou in
Xaynton / in Rochell / in Rouergue in Quercy / in Gore / in Bygore / and in
Agenoise. Desyring and commaundyng them to come to him in all have / with as
much power of men of war as they could make: and to mete with him at the
town of Cougnac / for there he had stablysshed his assemble. And so anon
after he departed fro the good lady pricesse his wife / and had with him
Richard his young son. And in the mean season that the prince made thus his
assemble / the frenchmen rode on forth / wastyng and distroyeng the country
before them / and so came to Lynde a good town / standing on the River of
Dordone / a leage fro Bergerath. And captain thereof was sir Thomas of
Batefoyle a knight of Gascoyne / who was within the town / set there to defend
it. And so the duke of Aniowe / the earl of Armynake / the lord Dalbret / the
earl of Pyergourt / the vy count of Carmayn / and all the other barons and
knights came thither: and so laid siege to the forte resse. Saying how they
would never depart thens / till they had the forteresse at their commandment.
The town was good and strong and well furnysshed with artillary / for the
captall of Beufz and sir Thom^s Phelton had been there not past a.xv. days
before / and had so refresshed y^ garyson / that they thought well that they
within might keep well y^ fortress if they list. Consydering the aid and
help that they might have shortly fro Bergerath / if need required. Howbe it
the people of the town were sore enclyned to become french / and had great
desire to harken on the promysses that the duke of Aniou made unto the^. So
that finally the capitayn sir Thom^s of Batefoyle / was feign to agree to them.
And also by a certain sum of money that he should have: and great profit
yearly of the duke of Aniowe / and there upon to become good french / and so it
was ordained that in a morning he should let the frenchmen enter into the
town. This treaty and covenant was not so close kept / but that it was known
in Bergerath / the night before that the town should be delivered in the
morning. And the same time in to the town of Bergerath there was come / the
earl of Ca^bridge with two hundred spears / and he was present when report
was made of those tidings. The Captall of Beufz / and sir Thomas Phelton had
great marueyle thereof / and said: how he would be at the delyuere of the town.
And so after mydnight they departed fro Bergerath / and rode toward Lynde /
and at the brekyng of the day they came thither / and caused the gate to be
op*ned and so rode through the town / till they came to the other gate / where
as the frenchmen should enter. At which time they were a entering / and sir
Thomas Batefole ready to make them way to enter. Than the Captall of Befz stepped
forth his sword in his hand and lighted a foot nere to the gate / and said.
A / sir Thomas Batefole false traitor: thou shall dye first / thou shalt
never do trayson more / and therewith stroke at him with his sword in such
wise / that he fell down deed to the earth. When the frenchmen parceyued the
Captall and his baner / and sir Thom^s Phelton / they knew well they failed of
their intent / wherefore they reculed together and turned their backs and fled
away. So the town abode still english / and was in great parell to have been
robbed and brent by the englysshmen / and all the men within slain: because
they consented to the trayson. How be it they excused them self and said:
how they did nothing / nor consented to do nothing but for very fear / and
pri^cipally for fear of their captain. So this passed over / and these two
lords abode still there a long season / till the duke of Aniou and his company
departed thens / and took another way. Now let us speak of the state and
ordinance of England / and of the army that sir Robert Canoll made in the
realm of France.

How trewse was made between England and Scotland / and how sir Robert Canoll
brent and exyled the country of Picardy and of Uermandoise. Cap. CC.lxxviii.
BEfore that sir Robert Canoll and his company parted out of England / there
was a great treaty between England and Scotland / which treaty was so wisely
handled by sad and discrete counsel of both parties / so y^ a peace was
granted between both kings / their countries and liege people / to
endure.ix. year. So that the scotts might at their pleasure arm the^ and
serve and take wages other of english or french at their pleasur / without
brekyng of any peace / whereby sir Robert Canoll had in his company a hundred
spears of the realm of scot land. When sir Robert Canoll was ready and his
company he went to Dover and so past forth to Calays / and there arrived and
took land / and was well received of the captain sir Nicholas Stamborne. And
when he had been well refresshed there / the space of seayn days / and taken
there counsel / to what part they should draw. And so in a morning they
deperted and took the field / and were to the no^bre of.xv. hundred spears /
and four thousand archers. And he had with him out of England / sir Thom^s
of Grantson / sir Alayne of Bourequeselles / sir Gylbert Gyfford, the lord of
Saluatier / ser Johan Bourchier / sir Wylliam Mesucyle / ser Geffray Orsell and
diverse other knights and valyant men of arms. and so the first day they went
nere to Fiennes. Sir Moreau of Fie^nes / who was constable of France was the
same time in his own castle of Fiennes / with a great nombre of knights and
squyers / well purueyed and aduysed to receive y^ englysshmen. And in the
morning the englysshmen came thither / thynkyng to assail the castle / but
anon they saw how they could take none advantage there. And so passed
forth through the cou^tie of guyens / and entered into the county of
Fauco^brige and brent all before them / and so came to the cite of Turwyn. But
they did not assail it / for it was so well provided for / that they thought
they should but lose their pain. And so thanne they took their way throught
the country of Terrenoyse / to enter into Artoise / and daily they rod a four
leages and past not / because of their caryage and men a foot / and took their
lodging ever about noone / and lay about great vyllages. And so at last they
came to the city of Arras / and they lodged in the town of Mount saint Eloy
(...) to Arras. And so they burnt and wasted all the country as ferr as they
durst stretche abroad. The french king had the same season set great garysons
in all cities / towns / castles / fortresses / bridges / and passages: to
defend them against all assautes. And when sir Robert Canoll and his company
had refresshed them two days in the mount saint Eloy / than they deperted and
went and passed by the city of Arras. Sir wyllm^ Mesuell and sir Geffray
Dursell marshals of the english host / thought to go and se them of Arras
more nerer / and took with them a two hundred spears / and a four hundred
archers and departed out of the great battle / and auau^sed the^ self to the
subbarbes of the town and so came to the barryers / the which they found
well furnisshed with cross bows and men of arms. And within the town was sir
Charles of Poicters with the lady of Artoise / but he made no semblant to issue
out nor to fight with thenglysshmen. And when the englisshmen had tarried before
the barryers a certain space / and saw that non issued against them. Than
they drue again to their battle but at their departing they thought to make a
knowledge that they had been there / for they set the subbarbes a fire / to
thente^t to have drawn out of the town the men of war / but they were in no
mind so to do. And so the fire did much hurt and damage / for there they brent
a great monastery of freers prechers / cloister and all. and so thenglysshmen
passed forth and took ye way to Bapalmes / brennyng and wastyng the country.
And so at last they came into Uermandoise and ca^e to Roy and brent the town /
and than passed forth and went to Hem in Uerma^dois wherinto all the people
were withdrawn / and all their goods: and so they did in like wise at saint
Quintyns and at Peron. so that thenglisshmen found nothing abroad / save ye
gra^ges full of corn: for it was after August. So they rode forth fair and
easily a two or three leages a day. And when they came where as any plenty of
vitayle was than they tarried there a two or three days / to refresshe the^ and
their horses. And so on a day they came before a town / the which was chief
of all that country there about and the marshals spoke with the captain by
assurance / and said to him. How say you? what will ye give and we shall
respyte this country / and save it fro brennyng and robbyng. so they fell at a
co^posicyon that they of the plain country should give and pay to the^ a
certain so^me of florens: and so the country was saved. This sir Robert Canoll
gate in the same voyage / by the said means at diverse times / above the sum
of a hundred thousand frankes / whereof afterward he was shente / for he was
accused to the king of England / yt he had not well done his deuoyre in yt
journey / as ye shall here after in this history.

THe land of the lord of Couey abode in peace / for there was another man nor
woman that had any hurt / the value of a penny / if they said they belonged to
the lord of Couey. And so at last the englysshmen came before the cite of
Noyon / the which was well furnyshed with men of war. There the englysshmen
tarried and aproched as nere as they might / and aduysed to se if any manner of
assaut might prevail them or not / and there they saw that the town was well
aparelled for defense. And sir Robert Canoll was loged in the abbey of Dolkans
/ and his people about him. And on a day he came before the cite raynged in
manner of battle / to se if they of the garyson and comontie of the town would
issue out to fight or not / but they had no will so to do. There was a scottysh
knight did there a goodly feate of arms / for he departed fro his company his
spear in his hand / mounted on a good horse his page behind him / and so
came before the barryers. This knight was called sir Johan Assucton / a hardy
man and a courageous. when he was before the barryers of Noyon / he lighted a
foot and said to his page / hold keep my horse and depart not hens / and so
went to the barryers. And within ye barryers there were good knights / as sir
Johan of Roy / sir Launcelat of Lourys / and a.x. or.xii. other / who had great
marueyle what this said knight would do. Than he said to them. Sirs / I am
come hyder to se you: I se well ye will not issue out of your barryers /
therefore I will enter and I can / and will prove my knyghthode against yours /
wyn me and ye can. And therewith he laid on round about him / and they at him.
And thus he alone fought against them more than an hour / and did hurt two or
three of the^: so that they of the town on the walls and garettes / stood
still and beheld them / and had great pleasure to regard his valya^tnesse and
did him no hurt / the which they might have done / if they had list to have
shot or cast stones at him. And also the french knights charged them to let
him and them alone together. So long they fought that at last his page came nere
to the barryers / and spoke in his langage / and said. Sir come away / it is
time for you to depart / for your company is departing hens. The knight he cd
him well and than gave a two or three strokes about him and so armed as he was /
he lept out of the barryers / and lepte upon his horse without any hurt behind
his page: and said to the frenchmen. Adue sirs I thank you / and sorode forth
to his own company. The which deed was much praised of many folks.

How they of Noyon took the englisshmen that had set fire in the bishops
bridge / and how the french king sent for sir Bertra^ of Clesquy. Cap.
CC.lxxix.
SIr Robert Canoll or he depted fro y^ siege of Noyon / his people brent the
town of bysshoppes bridge / on the river of Dyse / wheri there were many fair
houses. The knights and squyers that were with in the town of Noyon / had great
dyspleasure of the fire. And so they vuderstove that sir Robert and his company
were departed: and a.lx. speres of the^ went out of Noyon and ca^e to the fire
/ and found there styllparte of the^ that had set the fire in the town / and
diverse other that were there to pylle and rob / and so the most part of them
were slain. And there the frenchmen won mo than.xl. good horses / and rescued
diverse prisoners / and saved fro brennyng many fair houses. And so they
returned again to Noyon / with mo than.xv. prisoners / and so struck of all
their heedes. And the englysshmen rode forth in good order to come to Larroyse
/ and to pass at their ease the river of Dyse and the river of Ewe / and they
did no hurt in the county of Soyssons / because it parteyned to the lord of
Coucy. And true it was: they were coosted ever with certain lords of France:
as the vycont of Meaulx / the lord of Chauny / y^ lord Raoll of Coucy / the
lord wyllyam of Mehung / son to the earl of Tankernell and by their folks.
Whereby the englysshmen durst not break their order / but ever kept them self
close together. And also the frenchmen would not medyll with the^ / but every
night lodged within strong holds and good towns: and the englysshmen abroad
in the plain country / where as they found plenty of vitayls and new wynes /
whereof they made great larges. And so thus they rode through the country /
bre^nyng and wasting all before them / and at last passed the river of Marne /
and so entered in to Champayne / and passed the river of Aube / and turned to
the marches of Prouynce / and passed diverse times the river of Saync / and
drew toward the cite of Paris. For it had benshewed the^ how the french
king had made there a great assemble of men of war: of whom the earl of saint
Poule / and the lord of Clyssone should be chief governors / wherefore they
thought to draw thider / wylling to fight with the^ for by semyng
the^nglisshmen desired nothing else but battle. And therefore the french king
wrotte to sir Bertram of Clesquy / who as than was in Acquytayne with the duke
of Aniou. Commaundyng and desyring him on the sight of his letters / that he
should draw incontinent in to France / showing him how he would set him a
warke in other places. In the same season pope Urbane the fyft / came in to the
cite of Amou: he had been before a four year together at Rome / and there about.
He came thither in trust to make a peace bitwene the two kings for the war was
renewed again / the which was sore displesant to the pope. Of whose coming to
Aniou / y^ cardynals in those marches were greatly reioysed / for they thought
to fare the better by him.

Now let us speak of the prince of Wales how he parceyuered in his wars. ye
have herd here before recorded / how the price of Wales had made his assemble
at Congnac / to thentent to ride against the duke of Aniou / who brent and
wasted his country. and so at his commandment thither auau^sed barons /
knights and squyers of Poictou of Xaynton / and of other lands that held of
the prince. The earl of Penbroke departed fro his garyson and ca^e to the
prince. The same season the duke of Lancaster arrived at Burdeux / whereof the
prince was right ioyouse. And so he tarried not long there but deperted / for he
understood that the price would encou^tre his enemies. And so a days journey
fro Congnac / he encountered the earl of Penbroke / who was in like wise going
to the prince. And so they made great chere each to other when they met / and
so rode to gyder to Co^gnac. Where they found the prince / the princess and
the earl of Ca^bridge / who were right glad of their coming. And daily there
came men of war to the out of Poictou / Xaynton Rochell / Bygore Gout /
Gascoyne / and the marchesse nert adioynyng under the obeisance of the price.
And on the french party the duke of Aniou the earl of Armynake the lord
Dalbret the earls / vycontes / knights / and squyers / who had conquered:
cities / castles / towns / and fortresses in their coming / mo than.xl. And
were aproched within five leages to Burdeux and had wasted all the country.
And about Bergerath and Lynde they understood well how the price had made his
assemble at Congnac. And also how the duke of Lancastre was arrived with a great
no^bre of men of war / spears and archers. Than they drue to counsel / to
take advise how they should perceyuer in their war. And so newly to them was
sent ser Bertram of Clesquy by the french king / who came fro the duke of
Berry / keeping siege before the city of Lymoges / and had in such wise
constrained them within / that they were at a point to yield them / on certain
means and co^dicyons. And so to this counsel of the duke of Aniou and of the
lords about him / sir Bertram of Clesquy was called as it was reason. There
were many reasons alleged and laid / but finally all things co^sydred / they
counsayled the duke of Aniou to break up his journey for that time / and to
send all his people in to garysons / and to war garyable: saying how they had
done sufficye^tly for that time. Also it was needful to the lords or Gascone
/ as the earl of Armynake / therle of Piergourt / the lord Dalbret and diverse
other / to draw into their own countries to keep and defend them / and to
make fronter war for they knew not what was the prices intent: saying that he
had assembled toguyder so great an army. So by a common acorde they departed
each fro other / and the duke of Aniou went to the city of Caours / and
spredde abroad his people in the country / and put in to garysons. The earl of
Armynake / and the lord Dalbre / and y^ other returned in to their countries
/ and provided to furnisshe their towns and castles / thynking surely to have
war / and made their people to be on a redynesse to keep and defend their
countries if need were. Now let us speak of sir Bertram of Clesquy / who
departed fro the duke of Aniou / and did somoche that he came with his company
to the cite of Lymoges / where the duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burbone /
and other lords of France were at siege.

How they of Limoges yielded the^ to the duke of Berrey / and how the same
duke brake up his army. Cap. C C.lxxx.
When sir Bertram was come again to the sege / the frenchmen were greatly
reioysed of his coming Than anon they pursued the treaty / that was begone
between the bishop of Lymoges and them of the city / and the duke of
Aniowe. And so finally the bishop and they of the city turned them and
became french. And the duke of Berrey and the duke of Burbone / entered in to
the city: and sir Guy of Bloys and other lords of France with great joy /
and took faith and homage of them of the city / and so refresshed and rested
them there a three days. And so determined there in counsel to break up their
army for that time / as the duke of Aniou had done / and to return in to
their own countries to keep and defend their towns and forteresses / because
of sir Robr^t Canoll / who was still abroad in the field in France. Also they
said: how they had right well sped / in wynnyng of such a city as Lymoges.
So this counsel and advise was not broken: but thus these lords departed
each fro other / and sir Bertram ab^de still in the parties of Lymosyn with two
hundred spears / and kept the castles of y^ lord of Maleuall / the which
were turned french When the duke of Berrey departed fro Lymoges / he ordained
and set in y^ same city / at the request of the bishop sir Johan of Wyllemur
sir Hugh de la Roche / and Roger Beauforde / with a hundred men of arms. and
than he went in to Berrey / and the duke of Burbon into but bonoyse. And other
lords of farther marches / went home into their own countries. Now let us
speak of the prince how he spedde.

When tidings was come to the prince that the city of Lymoges was turned
french / and how that the bishop who was his gossyp / and in whom he had
before great trust and confydence / was chief ayder to yield up the cite and to
become french. With the which the prince was sore displeased / and set less
force in y^ men of the church: in whom before he had great trust. Tha^ he
swear by his fathers soul / whereby he was never forsworn: that he would get
it again / and that he would make y^ traitors derely abye their falsnesse.
When the most perte of his people were come / they were nombred to xit.
hundred spears / knights and squyers: a thousand archers and a thousand men
a foot. And so he departed fro the town of Co^gnac / and with him his two
brethren / the duke of Lancastre and the earl of Cambridge: sir Thomas Phelton
and the captall of Befz / abode still at Bergerath to keep y^ fronter against
the frenchmen and companyons that were in the country. And with the prince
also: was sir Guyssharde Dangle / sir Loyes Harcourt / the lord of Po^s the
lord of Parteney / the lord of Pynau / the lord of Tanyboton / sir Percyuall
of Coloyne sir Godfray Darge^ton. Potenyns and gascons: the lord of
Mountferant the lord of Camont the lord Lo^gueren / sir Aymere of Tharse /
the lord of Pomyers / the lord of Musydent / the lord of Lespare / the
souldyche of ^estrabe / the lord of Gerond and dyuets other engliss hme^* as
sir Thomas Percy / the lord Rose / the lord Wyllm^ Beaucha^pe / sir Mychell
dela Poule / the lord Stephan Gosenton / sir Richard of Pontchardon / sir
Baudwyn of Franuyll / sir Simon Burle / sir Dangouse / sir John^ Deureur / sir
Wyllm^ of Mesuyll and diverse other / the which I can not all name. And of
heynouse there was sir Eustace Da^brety court: and of the companyons / sir
Perducas Dalbret / Nandon of Bergerath. And thither came le Bourge de Laspare /
le Bourge de Bretuell / Espyot / Bernarde de Wist / and diverse other. So all
these men of war went for the in good ordinance and took the feldes / and
all the cou^tte trymbled before them. The prince was so dyseased that he could
not ride: but so was carried in a horse lytter / and he took the way to Lymosyn
/ to the intent to come to Lymoges. And at last thither they came / and so
lodged round about the city: and there the prince swear that he would never
depart thens / till he had the city at his pleasure. The bishop within
and the burgesses considered well: how they had greatly trespassed the prince
/ whereof than they repented them. But than they could not remedy it: for they
were not as than lords nor masters of their own city. Sir Johan Wyllemur
sir Hugh de la Roche / and Roger Beaufort / who were capitayns within the city
/ comforted greatly their people / and said. Sirs: be not afraid we are strong
enough to resyst against the prices power / for by assaute he can not hurt
nor grieve us / we are all well furnysshed with artyllary. When the prince and
his marshalles had well ymagined and considered / the puyssance and strength of
the city / and had knowledge of the nombre of men of war within. Than they
said how by assaut they could never win it. Than the prince thought to assaye
an other way. He had always in his company a great nombre of myners / and so
he set them awarke to undermine. The knights within parceyued well / how
they were undermined / and began to make dykes and to countermyne / to the
intent to break their mine.

How sir Robert Canoll entered in to the realm of France / with a great nombre
of men of arms / and came nere to Paris. Cap. C C.lxxxi.
SIr Robert Canoll (as it has been said before) with a great nombre of men of
arms / entered into the realm of France: and rode for the in small iourneys
with great expense through the realm. But y^ poor people of the plain country
paid derely therefore / for the englysshmen as they went and ca^e / they did
great hurt: and showed in manner how they desired nothing but battle. And
when they had passed the cou^tres of Artoise / Uerma^ doyse / the bysshopriche
of Laon / the archebysshopriche of Raynes / and Champayne. Than they turned to
Bry / and so came before the city of Paris / and there lodged a day and two
nights / the which time the french king was there / and might well se out of
his lodging of saint Poule / the fyres and smokes that were made about
gastenoyes. The same day / the constable of France / sir Moreau Fye^nes was
within Paris. The earl of saint Poule therle of Tankeruyll / the earl of
Salebruch / the vycount of Meaulx / sir Raoll of Coucy / the feneshall of
Heynault / sir Edward of Rauncy / sir Anguerrant Douden / the lord of Castle
Julyan / sir Johan of Uyan / the lord de la River and diverse other knights /
squyers / and valyant men of France. But none of them did issue out that day
/ for the king would not suffer the^. For the lord of Clysson / who was one
of the most pri^cypall of his counsel / and best b^leued and herd / did
put great doutes: and said to y^ king. Sir * ye have no need to enploy your
people against yonder sort of mad me^. Let the^ go / they can not take from
you your heritage / nor put you out of your realm by their smokes. And at the
gate saint James / and at the barryers / was the earl of saint Poule / the
vycount of Roan / sir Rafe Coucy / the lord of Canyne / the lord of Creques /
sir Edward of Rauncy* sir Anguerant Doudyn. And so on a tuesday in the morning
/ the englisshmen dissoged and had set fire in the vyllages where as they had
lodged / so that the fire might plainly be seen to Paris. There was a knight in
their company had made a vow the day before / that he would ride to the walls
or gates of Paris / and stryke at the barriers with his spear. and for y^
furnysshyng of his vow / he departed fro his company his spear in his fyst /
his shield about his neck armed at all pecesse / on a good horse / his squire
on another behind him with his bassenet. And wha^ he aproched nere to Paris /
he took and did on his helm / and left his squire behind him: and dasshed
his spurs to his horse / and came galopynge to the barryers / the which as
than were opyn. And the lords that were there / had wend he would have entered
into the town / but y^ was not his mind. For when he had stryken at the
barryers (as he had before auowed) he turned his reyne and drue back again /
and departed. Than the knights of France that saw him depte / said to him.
Go your way / ye have rightwell a quyted your self. I can not tell you what
was this knights name / nor of what country: but the blasure of his arms /
was goules / two fusses / sable aborder sable. Howbeit in the subbar bes / he
had asore encountre: for as he passed on the pauement / he found before him a
bocher / a bygge man / who had well seen this knight pass by. And he held in
his hands a sharp heavy axe with a long point; and as the knight returned
again / and took no heed. This bocher came on his side / and gave the knight
such a stroke between the neck and the shulders / that he reuersed forward
heedlynge to the neck of his horse / and yet he recovered again. And than the
bocher struck him again / so that the axe entered in to his body. So y^ for
pain / the knight fell to the earth: and his horse ran away and came to the
squire / who abode for his master at the streets end. And so the squire took
the horse / and had great marueyle what was beco^e of his master / for he had
well seen him ride to the barriers and stryke thereat with his glayue and
return again. Thanne he rode a little forth thyderwarde / and anon he saw
where his master lay upon the earth between four men / layeng on him strokes:
as they would have stryken on a stethy. And tha^ the squire was so affrayed /
that he durst go no farther / for he saw well he could not help his master.
There fore he returned as fast as he might. So there the said knight was slain.
And the knights that were at y^ gate / caused him to be buried in holy
ground. And the squire returned to the host / and showed all the adventure
of his master / whereof they were all sorry and displeased. And the same night
they loged / between mou^tle Hery and Paris / by a little river / and lodged be
times.

How sir Bertram of Clesquy made great war in the county of Lymoges / and
how they took the castle of saint yriell. Cap. CC.lxxxii.
THe same season that sir Robert Canoll made thus his vyage: and that the price
of Wales and his two brethren lay before the cite of Lymoges. Sir Bertram of
Clesquy and his company / the which were to the nombre of two hundred spears.
He rode by the one side of the country of Lymoges / but he lay not in the field
never a night for fear of the englysshmen. But every night lay in a forteresse
/ such as were turned french: parteyning to sir Loyes of Maleuall and to sir
Raymon of Marneyle / and to other. Howebeit every day they rode forth and did
great pain / to conquer towns and forteresses. The prince was well
aduertysed of this toney that sir Bertram made / and daily co^playntes came to
him: how beit in no wise he would break up his siege. Than sir Bertram of
Clesnuy entered into the vicou^te of Lymoges / a country that was yielded / and
did hold of the duke of Bretayne (the lord Johan of Mountford) And there sir
Bertram began to make great war in the name of the lady / wife to the lord
Charles of Bloyes / to whom the same enherytaunce sometime belonged. There he
made great war for none came against him / for the duke of Bretayne thought
full little y^ sir* Bertra^ would have made any war against him. And so sir
Bertram came before the town of saint yriell / wherein there was never a
gentylman to defend the town. Wherefore they were so afraid / that they
yielded them up to y^ obeysaunce of the lady of Bretayne / in whose name sir
Bertram made war. And so of saint yriell the bretons made a great garrison /
whereby they wan diverse other towns in Limosyn. Now let us return to the
prince of Wales.

How the price took the cite of Lymoges / and how four companyons did
marueyls in arms. Ca. CC.lxxxiii.
ABout the space of a month or more / was the prince of Wales before the city
of Lymoges / and there was no there assaute nor scrimysshe: but daily they mined.
And they within knew well how they were mined / and made a countermyne there
against / to have distroyed the^glysshe myners / but they failed of their mine.
and when y^ princis myners saw how the cou^termyne against the^ failed / they
said to the prince. Sir / when soever it shall please you: we shall cause a
part of the wall to fall in to the dykes / whereby ye shall enter in to the
city at your ease / without any danger. Which words pleased greatly the
prince / and said. I woll that to morrow be times / yeshewe forth and execute
your warke. Than the myners set fire in to their mine. and so the next morning
as the prince habbe ordained / there fell down a great pane of the wall and
filled the dykes / whereof the englysshmen were glad / and were ready armed in
the selde to enter into the town. The footmen might well enter at their case
/ and so they did: and ran to the gate / and beat / down the fortifyeng
and barryers. For their was no defense against the^ it was down so suddenly /
that they of the town were not ware thereof. Than the prince / the duke of
Lancastre / the earl of Cambridge / the earl of Penbroke / sir Guyssharde
Dangle / and all the other with their companyes / entered into the cite and all
other footmen ready apelled to do yuell / and to pyll and rob the city: and
to sle men / women / and children: for so it was commanded them to do. It was
great pytie to se the men / women / and children: y^ kneled down on their
knees before the price for mercy / but he was so enflamed with ire y^ he took
no head to them / so that none was herd / but all put to death as they were
met withal / and such as were nothing culpable. There was no pity taken of
the poor people / who wrought never no manner of treason. yet they bought it
dererr than the great personages / such as had done the yuell and trespace.
There was not so hard a heart within the city of Lymoges / and if he had any
remembrance of god / but that wept pyteously for the great mischefe that they
saw before their eyes. For mo than three thousand men / women / and children
were slain and be heeded that day / god have mercy on their souls / for I
trow they were martyrs. And thus entering in to the city / a certain company
of englysshmen entered into the bysshoppes palys and there they found the
bishop. And so they brought him to the princes presens / who beheld him right
fersly and felly. And the best word that he could have of him / was how he
would have his heed stryken of / and so he was had out of his sight.

Now let us speak of the knights that were within the city: as sir John^
of Wyllemure / sir Hugh de la Roche / Roger Beaufort / son to the earl of
Baufort / capitayns of the city. When they saw the trybulacion and pestylence
that ran over them and their company / they said one to another / we are all
deed without we defend our self. Therefore lettevs sell our lives derely / as
good knights ought to do. Than sir Johan of Wyllemure said to Roger
Beauforte. Roger / it behooves y^ ye be made a knight. Than Roger answered /
and said. ser / I am not as yet worthy to be a knight I thank you sir of your
good will / so there was no more said. They had not the leaser to speak long
together / howbeit they assembled the^ together in a place against an old wall /
and there dysplayed their baners / so they were to the no^bre of.lxxx. persons.
thither came y^ duke of Lanca stre * therle of Cambridge and their companyes /
and so lighted a foot / so that the frenchmen could not long endure against
thenglysshmen / for anon they were slain and taken. Howbeit the duke of
Lancastre himself fought long / hand to hand / against sir John^ Wyllemure
/ who was a strong knight and a hardy. And therle of Ca^bridge fought against
sir Hughe de la Roche: and the earl of Pe^broke against Roger Beaufort / who
was as than but a squire. These three frenchmen did many feats of arms /
their me^ were ocuped otherwise. The prince in his charyote came by them and
beheld them gladly and apeased himself in beholding of them. So long they
fought together / that the three frenchmen by one accord beholding their swerdes
/ said. Sirs: we be yours / ye have conquered us. Do with us according to
right of arms. Sir quod the duke of Lancastre: we look for nothing else
therefore we receive you as our prisoners. And thus the foresaid three frenchmen
were taken / as it was enfourmed me.

How the city of Lymoges was brent and distroyed / and the bishop delivered
fro death / and how sir Bertram of Clesquy was chosen constable. Cap.
CC.lxxxiiii.
THus the city of Lymoges was pylled / robbed / and clean brent: and brought
to distructyon. Than the^glysshmen departed with their conquest and prisoners
and drue to Co^gnac / where my lady the pri^cesse was. Than the prince gave
leave to all his men of war to deperte / and did no more y^ season: for he
felt him self not well at ease. For always his sickness increased / whereof
his brethren and people were sore dismayed. Now shall I show you of the
bishop of Lymoges / who was in great paryll of lesyng of his heed. The duke of
Lancastre desired of the prince to give him the bishop / to do with him at his
pleasure. The prince was content / and caused him to be delivered to the duke.
The bysshope had fre^des / and they had newly informed the pope / who was as
than at Auygnon (of the bysshoppes taking) the which fortuned well for y^
bishop: for else he had been deed. Than the pope by sweet words / entreated
the duke of Lancastre to deliver to him the said bishop. The duke would not
deny the pope but granted him and sent him to Auignon / whereof y^ pope was
right glad. Now let us speak of the adventures of France.

THe french king was informed of the distructyon and conquest of the city of
Lymoges. And how it was left clean boyde / as a town of desert / wherewith he
was sore displesed and took it in great passion / the damage and anoy of
thenhabytantes of the same. Tha^ was it aduysed in France: by counsel of the
nobles prelates and commons of all the realm / yt it was of necessyte / that
the frenchmen should have a chief and a governor / called y^ constable. For
ser Mo reau of Fyennes would leave and give up his office / who was a right
valyant man of his hands / and a great enterpriser of deeds of arms. So that
all thing co^sydred and ymagined / by a common acorde they chose sir Bertram of
Cles quy / so yt he would take it on him: as the most valyant knight / most
virtuous / and most able to execute that office / and most fortunate / that
they knew as tha^ / that bare arms for the crown of France. Than the king
wrote and sent certain messangers to him / that he should come and speak with
him at Paris. The messangers found him in the county of Lymoges / where as he
took fortresses and castles / and made them to yield to the lady of Bretayne /
wife to sir Charles of Bloys. And as than he had newly taken a town called
Brandon / and was rydyng toward another. And when the kings messangers were
come to him / he received the^ ioyously and right sagely / as he that could do
it right well. Than the messanger delivered to him the kings letter and did
his message. And when sir Bertram saw the commandment of the king / he would
make none excuse: but concluded to go and know the kings pleasur. And so
deperted as soon as he might / and sent y^ most part of his men in to garysons
such as he had conquered / and he made sovereign and kepar of the^ sir Olyuer
of Ma^ny his nephue. Than he rode forth so long by his iourneys / that he ca^e
to Paris / where he found the king and great no^bre of lords of his counsel
/ who received him right ioyously / and did him great reverence. And there the
king showed him / how he and his counsel had chosen him to be constable of
France. Than he excused him self right sagely / and said. Sir I am not worthy:
I am but a poor knight / as in regard of your other great lord and valyant
men in France / though it be so that fortune has a little auaunsed me. Thanne
the king said. Sir it is for nothing that ye excuse you. It behooves you to
take it / for it is so ordained and determined by all the counsel of France
/ the which in no wise I will break. Than sir Bertram excused him self again
by another way / and said. Right dear sir and noble king / I may not nor dare
not withsay yo^ noble pleasure. How be it sir / it is of truth y^ I am but a
poor man / and to low of blood to come to the office of constable of France
/ the which is so great and so noble an office. For it is conuenyent that he
that will exercise and acquyte him self well in that office / must commau^de
as well / and rather the great men than the small personages. And sir behold
here my lords your brethren / your nephues / and your cosyns / who has
charge of many men of war in your host and iourneys. Sir / how durst I than
be so bold as to command them: certainly sir / envy is so great that I ought
to fere it. Therefore sir / I require your grace pardon me / and give this
office to some other y^ would gladlyer have it tha^ I / and that may better
execute the office. Than the king answered / and said. Sir Bertram / excuse
you not by that way: for I have another brother / cosyn / nor nephue / earl nor
barowne in my realm / but that shall obey you. And if any do the contrary / I
shall so anger him / that he shall parceyue well my displeasur. Therefore sir /
take ioyously the office I require you. Sir Bertram saw well that any
excusacyons that he could make / should not avail. Than finally he accorded to
the opinyon of the king / right sore against his will. So than with great joy
sir Bertram of Clesquy was made constable of France / and farther to his
advancement / the king caused him to sytte at his table / and showed all the
tokens of love that he could deuyse. And gave him with the office / diverse
gifts and great lands and heritage: to him and to his heirs for ever. To
this promocyon did help greatly the duke of Aniou.

How sir Bertra^ of Clesquy / and the lord of Clysson / disconfyted at the
bridge of Bolayne / certain of sir Robert Canols company. Cap. CC.lxxxv.
Anon after that sir Bertram was stablysshed constable of France / he said to
the king. Sir / and it like your grace I will go and ride against sir Robert
Canolle / who is in the marches of Aniou and Main. Those words pleased well
the king / who said. Sir / take with you whom it shall please you / as ye
think best / all shall obey you. Than the constable purueyed for that journey
/ and gathered together men of arms / bretons and other. And so deperted fro
the king and rode toward Main / and had with him in his company the lord
Clysson / and so he came to the city of Man's / and there made his garyson / and
the lord of Clysson in another town nere thereto: and they were about the
nombre of five hundred spears. And sir Robert Canoll and his company was still
in the country / how be it they were not all of one opinyon / for there was an
english knight among them / called sir Johan Maystrude / who agreed not to
their minds / for always he counsayled against that journey. Saying: how
they lost their time / and traueyled them self without conqueryng of any
thing. This knight had a great company with him. Sir Robert Canoll and sir
Alayne Boucquesell / were lodged nere to Man's. Sir Thomas of Grantson / ser
Gylbert Gifforde / sir Geffray Oursell / and sir Wyllyam Mesuyll: all these
with a great company were behind the other. And when ser Robert Canoll and ser
Alayne Boucquesell / knew that the constable of France / and the lord of
Clysson were come in to the country / they were thereof right joyful. And ser
Robert Canoll said these tidings be good for us / let us draw together and
take our advantage. Surely ser Bertram of Clesquy / for the novelty of his
new office / is come to look on us. We have rydden over a great part of the
realm of France / and as yet we have found no manner of aduentur. Let us
send our minds and ententes to sir Hugh Caurell / who is at saint Mors on
Loir to sir Robert Briquet / and to sir Bertram Ceyn and to other capitayns of
the companyons / such as are nere about us: and desire them to come to us
incontinent. I think they will be glad to come. And if that we may
overthrow this new constable / and the lord of Clysson / who is so great an
enemy unto us. It shall be to us great honor and profit. Between sir Robert
Canoll and sir Alayne Boucq^sell / there was no manner of discord / but always
they followed one counsel. Than incontinent they sent letters and messangers
secretly unto sir Hugh Caurell / to sir Robert Briquet and to other / desyring
them to come forth / to thentent to fight with the frenchmen. In like wise
they sent to sir Thom^s Grantson / to sir Gylbert gyf forde / and to sir
Geffray Dursell / and to other / to mete with them at a certain place / in
trust to fight with the frenchmen as they ride.

ALl these knights and capitayns apparelled themself to keep this apoyntme^t
and so took forth their journey to come to their company / and they were to the
nombre of two hundred spears. Sir Robert Canoll sent not so secretly to his
companyons / but that sir Bertram of Clesquy had knowledge thereof. And when
they were well informed of their ententes they armed them in the night season /
and deperted with their company out of their garyson. The same proper night /
sir Thomas Grantson was departed out of his lodging with sir Geffray Dursell /
sir Gylbert Gyfforde / ser Wyllyam de Mesuyll and other. And so they came
toward sir Robtt Canoll / where as they thought to find him. Howbeit their way
was shorted / for at a place called the palse of the Pount Uolant the frenchmen
and they met together suddenly. The frenchmen were four hundred spears / and
the^glysshmen two hundred spears. There was a ferse battle and well fought /
and it long endured: for as soon as they met they lighted all a foot / and came
rudely each against other / and so fought with spears and swerdes right
valyantly. Howbeit the place abode with the frenchmen / and they obtained
vyctorie against the englysshmen: so that they were all slain and taken / none
escaped* except pages and boys / and such as lept on their masters horses
and saved them self. There was taken sir Thomas Gra^tson / sir Gylbert Gyfford
sir Geffray Drsell sir Wyllin^ Mesuyll / sir Philyp Courtney sir Hugh Spens and
diverse other knights: and they were all led as prisoners to the cite of
Man's. These tidings were anon brought to sir Robert Canoll / to sir Hugh
Caurell* and to sir Robert Briquet / and their companyons: whereof they were
sore difpleased / and so brake their enterprice because of that aduentur. And
they of saint Mors on Loyre came not forth / but kept still their logyng. And
sir Robert Canoll / and sir Alayne Boucquesell withdrue the^ back / and brake
up that journey and entered in to Bretayne. And sir Robert went to his own
castle of Doruall / and gave leave to all his men of arms and archers to
depart / and take their advantage where as they thought best. So they departed /
and some went over again into England. And sir Alayne Boucq^sell went to
winter in the town of saint Sauy our the vycont / which the king of England
had given him.

How pope Urbane dyed / and how Gregory was chosen. And how sir Raymon of
Marneyll was taken by the englysshmen. Cap. CC.lxxxvi.
AFter this disconfyture thus at Pont Uolant / where as part of the englysshmen
were overthrown / whereby their journey was broken. Than sir Bertram of Clesquy
/ who in the novelty of his office / as constable of France had done this deed
/ whereby he gate great renome and laud / and so came again in to France / and
the lord of Clysson with him. And led with him a great part of the english
prisoners / and brought them to the city of Paris without danger / and there
courtesly raunsomed them without constraynt / and did let them go on their
faythes. They put them not in stocks noryrons / nor yet in prison / as these
almaygnes do their prisoners / to get of them the greater ransom. Cursed be
they / they are people without pytie or honor: therefore there is none that
ought to take any mercy of them. The frenchmen kept good company with their
prisoners / and raunsomed them courtesly / without any greuaunce to them.

Of this disco^fytur the prince of Wales was right sore displeased / and the
duke of Lancaster and all their company being at Congnac. After the
reco^queryng of Lymoges / about the time of Christmas / pope Urbane the fyft
dyed at Auygnon / who had been a valiant clerk and a wise: and a good
frenchman. Than the cardy nals entered into the Co^claue / and did chose among
them a new pope / who was cardynall of Beauforde / and was called Gregory
the.xi. of whose creacyon and deuyne prudence / the french king was right
ioyoule / because he seemed to be a good frenchman / at whose creacyon there was
with him at Auygnon the duke of Aniou / who did great pain to cause him to be
pope. The same season there fell to sir Eustace Da^ bretycourt an hard
adventure / he rode in Lymosyn / and in an evening he came to y^ castle of
the lord Pyer Buffyer / whom he reputed to have been his special friend and
lover / and for a good englysshman. But he did put sir Thy balt du pont / a
man of arms a breton into his castle / and caused him to take sir Eustace
prisoner / as he that took no head of him. And so heledde him away with him as
his prisoner / and afterward raunsomed him at.xii. thousand frankes / whereof
he paid four thousand: and his son Frances abode in hostage for the resydue
with the duke of Burbone / who repledged him / and did much pain for his
delyuerance / because that sir Eustace before did his pain to deliver the
lady his mother / whom the co^panyons had taken at Bell perch. And so after
sir Eustace delyuerance / he went and lay at Carenten / beyond the waches of
saint Clement in base normandy / in a good town / the which the king of
Naucr had given him / and there he dyed: god have his soul / for as long as he
lived he was a right valyant knight.

THe same season ser Raymon of Marvel depted fro Paris / to go in to his own
country / the which newly was returned french: and by the way he met an hard
aduentur for him. For he found a great rout of englysshmen of sir Hugh
Caurelles / which were led by a knight of Poytou. Hesell so in this knights
hands that he could not escape / and so he was taken prisoner / and brought in
to Poyctou to the said knights castle: The taking of sir Raymon was anon
known in England: so that the king was informed thereof. Than the king wrote
to the knight that had him / co^mau^dyng him inco^tynent to send him his enemy
/ and false traitor sir Raymon Marnell* saying how he would take such
vengeance on hi^ that all other should take ensample by him / promysing the
knight to give him for the taking of him.vi. M. frankes. The knyghes was called
sir Geffray Dargenton / who would not disobey the king his masters
commauadement / but said he would fulfill his pleasur. Sir Raymon of Marnell
was informed how the king of England would have him / and had sent for him:
and how his master was determined to send him over in to England. And when
he knew that / he was more abashed than before / and good cause why. Than in
his prison he began to make the most lamentable co^playntes that could be
devised: in so much that he that kept him / who was an englysshman / had great
pity on him / and right swetely reconforted him. Sir Raymon / who saw no
conforte in the danger that he was in: seeing that be should be led into
England to the king. Than he discovered his sorrow to his kepar / and on a
day said to him. My dear friend: if ye would deliver me out of the danger that
I am in. I promise you on my faith and truth / to depart with you the half
of all my lands / and make you enheryter thereto / and never to fail you. The
englysshman who was but a poor man / considered how sir Raymon was in parell
of his life / and how he had promised him great curtessy. He had of him great
pytie and co^passyon / and said. Sir I shall do my pain to save you. Than ser
Raymon / who was right joyful of that answer: swear to him his faytl^ to keep
his promise / and farthermore if he would desire it. And than they devised how
they might accomplysshe their entences. And when it was night (the englysshman)
who bare the kayes of the castle and of the tower / wherein sir Raymon was
prisoner / and had they kay of the posterne. He did so much that he let him
out in to the feldes. And so toguyder they went in to a great wood / to the
entente they should not be followed. That night they suffered as much pain as
could be thought / for they went a seuyn leages a foot the same night / and it
was hard frost / whereby they cut their fete. And in the morning they came to
a french fortress where they were received joyfully with them of the
forteresse / to whom sir Raymon recounted all his adventure / whereof they all
thanked god.

IT was of truth / that the next morning wha^ it was known how they were
gone men a horseback followed after: but it was to late. Thus sir Raymon escaped
and returned into Lymosyn / and showed to all his friends / how the english
squire had showed to him great curtesy. And soever after thenglysshman was
greatly honored and cherysshed among them. And sir Raymon would have delivered
to him the one half of his heritage / according as he had promised to him
before / but the englisshe squire would in no wise take so much. And so he
took all only but. C C. ^t. of yearly revenues / saying it was sufficyent
for him / to maynteyne there with his astate.

How the prince of wales left the duchy of Acquitayne / in the keeping of the
duke of Lancastre / and how four breton knights / took the castle of Mount
Paon. Cap. C C.lxxxvii.
THe same season in the cite of Bordeaux / dyed the eldest son^e of the prince
and princess / whereof they were right sorry as reasone was. Than the prince
was counsayled / y^ he should return in to England into his own country /
to thentent the rather thereby to recover his health: this counsel was given
him by his phisycions and surgyons / that knew his disease. The prince agreed
well thereto / and said: he was well content so to do / and thereupon made his
provision And as I understood / the earl of Ca^bridge his brother / and the
earl Johan of Penbroke: were ordained to return with him to keep him company.
And when the prince should depart out of Acquitayne / and that his ships
were ready in the tyuer of Garon / and in the haven of Burdeaur. The prince and
pricesse / and their young son Richard being there: Than he made a special
somons at Bordeaux / of all barownes and knights / of Gascoyne and Poictou:
and in all other places where as he was lord. And they under his obeysaunce /
when they were all come toguyder / in a chamber before the prince. Than he
showed to them / how he had been their lord / and had kept them in peace as
much as lay in his power / and had maynteyned them in great prosperyte and
puysance / against all their enemies. Showing them / that to recover his health
/ whereof he had great need: he was in purpose to return in to England.
Desyring the^ to believe / serve / and obey his brother / the duke of Lancastre:
in like manner as they had done himself. Trusting they should find him a good
lord and curtesse / requyringe the^ to counsel and assyst him in all his
business. The barons of Acqtayne / Gascoyne / Poictou / and of Xainton /
promised and swear on their faythes / that there should never defaute be found
in any of the^. And so there they did fealty and homage to the duke / and
promised him their loves service / and obeisance and that they swear to uphold
and keep / in the presence of the prince / and so kyst his mouth. And after
this order taken / y^ prince tarried not long in the city of Burdeux / but
entered into his ship / and the pricesse and their children / and the earl of
Cambridge and the earl of Penbroke with the^. And with him there was a five
hundred fighting men / beside archers. So long they sailed without danger or
damage / that they aryued at Nampton. There they took land and refresshed them
two days than they took their horses and the prince in a lytter / and so came
to wyndsore where the king was / who received swetely his children* and so there
he was informed by the^ / of all the state of Guyen. And when the prince had been
with the king as long as it pleased them / than the prince took his leave and
went to his own house of Camestades. Now let us leave to speak of the prince
/ and show somewhat of the business of Acquitayne.

Anon after that the prince was departed fro Burdeux / the duke of Lancastre
made the obsequy of his cosyn Edward / sofie to the prince his brother / the
which was nobly done in the city of Burdeux. And thereat were all the barons
of Gascoyne / and Poictou / such as had sworn obeisance to him. In the mean
season of this obsequy / and that all these lords were at Burdeux / there
issued out of the fortetesse of Pyergourt a two hundred spears bretons / the
which were sent thither by the duke of Aniowe. Of the which company there were
four knights capitayns / right hardy and valyant knights / called sir Wyllyam
of Lo^uall / sir Alayne of Aussay / sir Loyes of Mally / and the lord Darcy.
These lords rode with their companyes to a strong castle / called Mount paon
/ perteyning to a knight. And when these bretons were co^ethyder / and had
run to the barryers / they made semblant to assail the castle. Than the
capitayn within called sir Wyllyam of Mount paon / who showed himself to have
rather a french heart than an english. He turned and yielded up the place /
and received the bretons in to his castle / who said they would keep that
place against all the world / than they new repaired and fortifyed it. These
tidings anon was known at Burdeux: than the duke of Lancastre said to the
lords about him. sirs / we do not our beuoyre as we shulve do / for the
bretons are a broad / and have taken the fortress of Mountpaon marchyng nere
to them. Of the which taking / the duke and all the lords about him had
great shame / (...) than they ordained all to go thither. And so departed fro
Burdeaur on a wedntsday / and with y^ duke of Lancastre was the lord of Pons /
the lord of Parteney / sir Loys Harcourt sir guys sharde Dangle / sir
Percyuall of Culoyue / sir Godfray Darge^ton / sir Jaques of Surgeres sir
Maubrune of Linyers / sir Wyllm^ of Montendre / sir Hugh of Uinoy / the lord
of Crupenacke / and diverse other barons and knights of Poictou / and Xaynton.
And of gascon there was the captall of Befz / the lord of Pomyers the lord of
Chamount / the lord of Mountserant / the lord of Langueron / the souldyche of
Lestrade / sir Bernard Dalbret / the lord of getonde / sir Amery of Charse and
diverse other And of England / there was sir Thom^s Phelton sir Thom^s Percy /
the lord Rose / sir Mychell de la Poule / the lord Wyloughhy / ser Wyllyam
Beaucha^pe / sir Richard Pontchardon sir Bandras of Franuyll / sir Da^goses
and diverse other. They were aseuyn hundred spears / and five hundred archers.
And so they rode right ordinatly toward Mountpaon / and so came thither. And
when sir Wylliam of Mount paon knew of the coming thither of the duke of
Lancastre and of his company / and saw how he was by them besieged. He thought
him self than in no surety / for he knew well that if he were takenne by
force / heshulde not escape fro death / thinking surely he should not be taken
to mercy / because of the forfet that he had done in gyueng up the place before
to the bretons. Than he dyscouered his intent to the forsayde four knights /
and said to them. Sirs / I will leave this castle to you / and I will depart
and go to Pyergourt / and keep that. And so he departed and went to Pyergourt
/ and left his own castle / in the keeping of the foresaid four knights.

How these four knights bretons defended the^ self valiantly / against the
duke of Lancastre / and how finally the duke took them all four to rau^some.
Ca. C C.lxxxviii.
When the duke of Lancaster and the barons and knights were come to the
castle of Mountpaon / they laid siege thereto / and made as great proyisyon for
their lodgings and other necessaryes / as though they should have tarried
there the space of seuyn year. And they lay not ydell / for incontyuent they
apperelled themself to assail the castle / and caused the villayns of the
country to cut down great quantyte of wode and tymbre to cast into the
dykes. And thus fyftene vayes together they did nothing / but always cast
stuff in to the dykes / and on the wode and tymbre they laid over straw and
earth. And so within that space they had filled a great perte of the dykes / so
that they might well come to the walls / to scrimy she with them within / as
they vyde nigh every day / five or six assautes / where as there was many noble
deeds done. For the four breton knights that were within / were right valyaut
men of arms / and defended the^ self right nobly / wherefore they ought
greatly to be commended. For though the englisshmen and gascoyns came so nere
them / yet they were not afraid / nor lost no great thing. And nere to this
garyson there were other bretons in an other garyson / called saint Maquayre /
of who^ Johan of Malestroyt and Syluester Budes were capitayns / who every day
herd spekyng of the feats of arms / that were done before Mountpaon. And
they had great desire to be there / and said often times one to another. We
know well our companyons are here by / who are right valiant / as we may here
daily by their deeds / and every day they have five or. vivatayls / and yet we
lie here still and do nothing* Certayuly we acquyte us not well. So thus they
were in great desire to go and rescue the^ if they might. And when they had all
spoken / and consydred the peril to leave their own forte / resse void /
they wist not well what to do. tha^ on a time / Syluester Budes / said to his
fellow. John^ / ye shall other go or else will I / chose you whyder. Than Johan
answered and said Syluester / ye shall abide here and I will go. And there they
were at a long strife / which of them should go. And so at last they acorded
and swear / and made promise before all the company / that they should draw
cuttes: and he that should have the longest straw should go forth and the
other abide. So than they drew / and the longest cut fell to Syluester Budes
/ than there was great laughyng among all the company. This Syluester took it
for no fable / but apparelled him self and mounted on his horse and departed
with.xii. men of arms with him and rode so long / that at the euenyng he
entered in to the town and castle of Mou^tpaon / where of the knights and
companyons within had great joy / and gave great praise to Siluester Budes. As
I have showed you here before / there was every day assautes at Mou^tpaon / and
right well the knights within aquyted themself / and deserved great honor.
For until ye time that a great part of their wall was overthrown / they were
never afraid nor a basshed. The englysshmen ordained mantels and other
instruments of war / whereby to aproche nere to the walls / over the dykes
that they had filled. and there the brigantes well pauessed / who had great
pykes of iron / wherewith they undermined the walls / in such wise that a
great pane of the wall fell down / more than.xl. foot long. Than the lords of
the host / ordained their batayls with their archers / who shot so holy
together / that non of the^ within durst ones apere abroad And when sir Wylliam
of Lonuall / sir Alayne of Houssay / sir Loyes of Maylley / and ye lord Darcy:
saw how they were in the case / not able to endure nor keep the hold. Tha^
they sent a heraulde out a horse back to the duke of Lancastre to have a
treaty if it might be. The heraulde came to the duke / and showed him the
intent of his coming. Than the duke by thaduyse of his counsel / gave respyte
to them with in / to speak with him and his counsel. The heraulde returned /
and showed his masters how he had spedde. Than all four knights went for
the / and the duke sent to them sir Guyssharde Dangle / and so on the dykes
they spoke together. Than they demanded under what manner the duke would receive
them. Than sir Guyssharde / who had the charge / answered and said. Sirs: ye
have greatly displeased my lord the duke / for ye have kept here this castle
against him / more than.xi. wekes: whereby he has lost diverse of his men.
Wherefore he will not receive you to grace nor mercy / without ye will yield
your self simply. And also deliver to him first / sir Wylliam of Mou^tpaon / yt
he may put him to death as he has deserved / like a treatour. Tha^ sir Loyes of
Mailly: answered and said. Sir Guyssharde / as for sir Wyllyam of Mountpaon /
whom ye desire to have deluered / we swear unto you truly / that we know not
as no we where he is: for he was not in this castle sithe ye laid siege
thereto. And sir / it is a hard thing for us to yield our self up symply / as
ye would have us to do / sithe we be sent hyder but as soudiers / to get our
self wages to live by. In like manner as ye send yours / and sometime your
self glad to take wages. Therefore sir / or we make y^ marcha^dyse: we shall
sell our self so derely / that it shall be spoken of a hundred years after our
dethes. But sir / we desire you to return to the duke / and show him that we
desire him to receive us courtesly / on certain composycion of ransom. In
like manner as he would that his me^ should ^e dalt with all / if they were
fallen in such like danger. Than answered sir Guyssharde / and said. Sirs /
I shall do the best of my power. And so returned to the duke / and took with
him the Captall of Beufz / the lord of Rousayne / the lord of Musyden / to
the intent the rather to speed. And when they were all come before the duke /
they showed him so many fair words / that he condyscended to their request.
And so took the four breton knights / and Syluester Budes and all their
company to mercy / as prisoners. And so he had again full possession of the
forteresse of Mountpaon / and took fealty of them of the town: and set there
two gascone knights to keep it / and forty men of arms / and as many
archers. And new repaired and fortifyed the place / and refresshed it with
vitayle and artyllary.

How the duke of Lancastre gave license to all his people to depart / and
returned himself to Burdeux. and how the lord of Pons turned french / and
how the seneschall of Poyctou assembled together a company. Cap. CC.lxxxix.
AFter the Conquest of Mountpaon / and that the duke had set there
capitayns / and well fortifyed the fortress. Than he dysloged and gave license
to every man to depart wheder they would: and so they departed each fro other
and returned into their own countrees. And the duke went to the city of
Burdeur / and the poictenyns in to their country / and they of Gascone went
home to their own towns and castles. And the companyons spredde abroad all
about the country / who did much hurt and yuell / as well in the land of
their friends / as on their enemies. The which the duke suffered / because he
thought he should have need of them again shortly / for the wars as at that
time / were more sorer without comparyson in Poyctou / than in any other
country. And there was kept a great garyson in the castle of Mountcontor a
four leages fro Thouars / and seuyn leages fro Poicters. And sir Peter of
Guerfyll and Jordayne of Colloyne were capitayns there / and so they ran
daily / outher before Thouars or else before Poicters / and did great hurt to
the^ of the country / that held of the english part. Also in the castle of
Leraunt was capiten Carlonet a breton / and with him a seuyn hundred bretons /
who did great damage to the country. And also they of the garyson of the Roche
of Pousay / and they of saint Saluyn / ran daily abroad in the country / so
that the barons and knights of Poictou / such as held of the english part
/ durst not stir abroad / without they rode by great companyes: for fear of
the frenchmen that were thus closed in their country.

Anon after the wynning of Mou^tpaon and that the lords of Poictou were with /
drawn in to their own countrees ke^yng fro^ter against the frenchmen. There
was ye same time secret treaty: between the lord Loys of saint Julyan / the
vycount of Rochchoart / and other frenchmen / by great gifts coming fro the
french king. Who night and day traueyled / to draw them of Poictou to his
acorde / and so much they did / that the lord of Pons turned french /
against the will of the good lady his wife: or the men of the town of Pouns in
Poictou. And so the lady abode still english and her husband french. Of the
which tidings the barons and knights of Poictou / such as were english were
sore displeased / for the lord of Pouns was a great lord. When the duke of
Lancastre knew thereof / he was right sore displeased with the lord of Pons:
and praised greatly his wife and the men of Pons / that would abide still
english. and to aid and to counsel the lady: the duke ordained a knight to
go thither right valyant and hardy / called ser Aymemo^s of Bours. Thus they
ran daily before the town / and sometime did nothing and sometime were
chased away: and returned with damage. So the englysshmen were troubled / and
the lords and knights of Poictou one against another / the stronger ouerca^e
the wekar. So there was another right / law / nor reason minystred on any
part. And the fortresses and castles were intermedled one within an other /
some english and some french / each of them ronnynge on other / and pyllynge
each other without sparyng. Than certain of the barons and knights of Poyctou
/ such as were english: aduysed well how they of the forteresse of
Mountcontour traueyled them more / than any other garyson: wherefore they
determined to go thither and besiege the^. And so they made a somons of men of
war to assemble in the town of Poyters / in the name of the seneschall of
Poytou / sir Thomas Percy. To which commandment all knights and squyers
obeyed / and so they were a five hundred speres / and two thousand brigantes
pauessed / with the archers / such as were there. So that there were of Poictou:
sir / Guyssharde Dangle / sir Loyes of Harcourt / the lord of Parteney / the
lord of Pynan / the lord of Tannyboton / the lord of Cupenac / ser Percyuall
of Coloyne / sir Godfray Dangenton / sir Hugh of Wynay / the lord of Coyes /
the lord of Puyssances / sir Jaques of Surgeres / sir Maubrune of Linyers and
diverse other. And of englysshmen yt were in Poictou: there were the lord
Baudwyn of Franuyll / sir Dangoses / sir Water Hewet / sir Richard Pontchardon
and other. And when they were all assembled at Poycters / and ready apparelled:
they departed and took the way to Mountcontour / well furnysshed to lay there a
siege.

How the seneshall of Poictou took Mou^tcontour / and how sir Bertra^ of
Clesquy took diverse towns and castles in Rouuergne. and how he besieged the
city of Duses. Cap. CC.lxxxx.
THe castle of Mou^tcontour stands on the marchesse of Aniou and Poyctou /
and was marvelous strong and fair: but four lea (...) Thouars. And so much
did these englysshmen and poite^yns who were to ye nombre of three thousand
fighting men / that they came to the forteresse: and had brought with them
great engyns fro Thouars / and fro the city of Poicters. And anon they were
raised up against the castle / which did cast night and day in to the
castle. And beside that / daily there were assautes given to them within and
scrimysshes. There was done many noble feats of arms for with these poicteuyns
there were certain of the companyons / who would not lie still: as John^
Creuell / and Dauyd Hollegraue. These two / with sir Gaultyer Hewet were
capitayns. Sir Peter Cressell and Jordayne of Coloyne / who were within / bare
themself right valiantly: and daily came to ye bar^ye^s / and fought with the
englysshmen. And among the assautes that were there made / which were many:
the tenthe day that they were come thither / they made such assaute / and with
so good order / that by clean force the pearsed ye walls / and entered in and
conquered the frenchemen. And so all were slain that were within except Peter
/ and Jordayne / and a five or sire men of arms / who were taken to mercy.
After this adventure and enterprise / sir Thomas Percy / sir Loyes Harcourt /
and sir Guys sharde Dangle / by the acorde and counsel of all the barons and
knights / gave the same castle to sir Gaultyer Hewet / and to John^ Creswell
/ and to Dauyd Hollegraue / and the companyons / who were a five hundred
fighting men / to thentent to keep fronter war against them of Aniou and
Main. Than these lords departed / and every man went home to his own Thus
the forteresse of Mountcontour and the fronter / abode in the keeping of these
foresaid knights / who made there a strong garyson and well fortifyed it. And
so kept it a long season after / and did much trouble to the country there
about / for daily they ran outher to Anioweor to Main.

Now let us return to speak of sir Bertram of Clesquy constable of France
/ who was with ye king at Paris euersyth his coming fro the bridge Uallant.
Where he and the lord Clysson had overthrown the englysshmen (as ye have herd
before) and he had well herd how the englysshmen in Poictou and in Guyen kept
the feldes. So that as soon as candelmasse was past and that the springyng
time began. Sir Bertram thought to reyse and gather an army / and to asseble
lords and knights and to ride to some other part / in like manner as
the^glysshmen ryd in Poytou / in Quercy / and Rouuergue. For in these countries
there were englysshmen that did right honorably / and had so maynteyned them
self euersyth the rene wyng of the war. And also the company of sir Johan
Deureur / were newly come in to the country of Limosyn: and had taken in
Auuergne a castle / city / and town all toguyder / named Duses / the which
sir Bertram of Clesquy thought / ought not to be suffered. Than he said he would
draw to that part / and so by the kings license / he assembled to guider a
great nombre of men of arms / and so departed fro Paris and always his no^bre
increased. And so long this constable rode that he ca^e into Auuergne / and
there was with him ye duke of Berrey / the duke of Burbone / the earl of Alenson
/ the earl of Perch his brother / the earl of saint Poule / the Dolphyn of
Auuergne / the earl of Uandon / the earl of Porceen / the lord of Sully / the
lord Montague / sir Hughe Dolphyne / the lord Beauieu / the lord Rochforte /
the lord of Talenson / and a great nombre of barownes / knights / and squyers
of the marchesse of France. So long they rode that they came to the city of
Duses / and there they lodged and besieged the city / and lay there a.xv.
days. there were given many great and ferse assautes / how be it they could not
get the forteresse / for win there were englysshmen that valyantly defended
their hold. So than the frenchmen departed and rode farther with the constable
/ in to the pties of Rouuergue / and some of the chief lords went to Auygnon
to se pope Gregory / and the duke of Aniou who was with him. And anon after
this visytacion / and that these lords had spoken with the duke of Aniou: they
departed fro Auygnon and drew again to the constable who was in Rouergue /
and conquered towns and castles on thenglysshmen. And so they came before the
town of Lamulae / and laid siege thereto: the which sir Thomas of Ueulq^ fare
held / and had kept it long / and also the Roche Uauclere. But ye said
english knights by composycion yielded the^ to sir Bertram / and so did
diverse other castles / on the fronter of Limosyn. And when sir Bertram had
refresshed him / he took his way and his return toward the city of Duses in
Auuergne / and so came thither and laid siege thereto. And thither they brought
great engyns fro Ryon and Cleremont / and dressed them up before the fortress
/ and also apparelled all manner of instruments for assautes.

How they of Duses yielded them up to sir Bertram / and how sir Robert Canoll
was in the displeasure of the king of England / and how at the request of the
lords his peace was made again. Cap. CC.lxxxxi.
When the englysshmen that were within the city of Duses / saw the order and
manner of the constable of France / and also had perfyte knoledge how that sir
Thom^s of Ueulquefare was departed and had forsaken the forteresse in
Rouergue. And also saw well how there was no comfort coming to them fro no
part. Than they drew to counsel / and determined to yield them up by treaty
and none otherwise. And so they made with the constable so wise poyntmentes /
that they deperted without danger or blame and had with them all that they
would carry and also were conveyed in sauegarde to saint Symere in Lymosyn.
Thus sir Bertra^ wan in this voyage diverse places and countrees / that the
englysshmen held before / and than he returned in to France.

yE have herd here before / of the journey yt sir Robert Canoll made in France
/ and how he returned to his own castle of Deruall in Bretayne. And it was
of truth / that certain englysshmen at their retournyng in to England /
informed so the king against him / that the king and his counsel was not
well content with him. But when sir Robert Canoll knew thereof / he send to
excuse him / two of his esquyers. And they did so well their deuoyre / that
the king and his counsel parceyued well / how they were yuell and falsely
informed of him. And so were well content again with him / through the help
of sir Alayne of Bouquesell / and of other knights about the king / who helped
to excuse him. Sir Johan Ourde bought it derely: for he was taken and put to
execusyon openly at London. The execusyon of him / was the excuse of all yuell
words. And so sir Robert Canoll abode still in the kings grace and in the
princes.

How the earl of Herford and diverse englysshmen disco^fyted in Bretayne on the
lee / diverse flemynges that assailed them. Cap. CC.lxxxxii.
THe king of England seeing how the frenchemen made him war / he gat him
friends where he could. and so had to his accord: the duke of Guerles his
nephue and the duke of Jullyers / and were agreed to assemble toguyder certain
no^bre of men of war / and so to enter into France. And the same season the
king of England / sent the earl of Herford and the knights of his household
in to Bretayne to speak with ye duke for certain matters between them / and ye
same season the flemynges and englysshmen were no friends. And so they met
together on the sea but there the flemynges lost / so that they were nothing
content / for by adventure they met each other before a hauyn in Breten /
called la Bay. And of the ^^emysshe navy was patron / Johan Peterson / and of
the englysshemen sir Guy of Brian. And as soon as they met they set each upon
other / so that there was a great battle and a sore. And with the earl of
Herforde / there was sir Richard Stury / sir Thomas Wysque and other. And so
they fought together right valyantly / and how be it that the flemynges were
more in no^bre and better purueyed for the matter (for they had tarried there a
long space for the same purpose) yet for all that / they had but little
advantage. This battle thus on the sea / endured the space of three hours /
and there was done many a noble feate of arms / and many a man wounded and hurt
with shot / for they had graped their ships to guyder with hokes of iron
/ so y^ one could not fly fro another. How be it finally the vyctorie abode
with thenglysshmen / and the flemynges disconfyted: and sir Johan Peterson
their patron taken / and all the other taken or slain / so that none escaped.
And the englysshmen turned back again into England with their conquest and
prisoners / and so brake up their vyage for that time: and than showed these
tidings to the king of England who was right ioyouse of that adueture / when
he knew that the flemynges gave the assaute and occasyon and were disconfyted.
Than Johan Pete^son was sent to prisone / and al^ the other into ^yuers places
of the realm.

How the king of England sent a great navy to the lee against the flemynges /
and how the peace was made between them. Cap. CC.lxxxxiii.
AFter this disconfyture thus on the flemynges before the Bay in Bretayne. The
king of England sent men of war to ye see against the flemynges / commaundyng
them to make sharp war against all the flemynges and to keep all passages:
so that nothing should come thither without danger. And when they of Bruges / of
Ipre / and of Gaunt herd thereof / than they drew to counsel: and all
things consydred and ymagined. They thought it not profitable for them to have
the yuell will of England / there nere neighbor / for the susteynynge or
aydinge of the earl their lord. Therefore the good towns sent suffycient men
into England to treat for a peace with the king and his counsel. Who spedde
so well or their return / that they did bring peace to the country of
Flanders / and to the flemynges: on certain artycles sealed of both perties.
So they abode than in good state rest and peace. Now let us a little speak
of the realm of Mayllorques.

How the king of Mayllorques was in displeasure with king Henry of Spain /
and than went and made war to the king of Arragon. Cap. CC.lxxxxiiii.
YE have herd rehearsed here before: how that king James of Mayllorques was
takenne in the vale of Olyffes in Castle / when king Henry conquered again
Spa^gne / and so he was as prisoner with the said king Henry. When the queen of
Naples his wife / and the Marquis his suster had knoledge of his taking / they
were sore displeased therewith: and so provided for remedy therefore. I shall
show you by what manner. They sent certain valyant men to entreat with king
Henry for his rausome / and they did so much that he was set to his ransom /
for the sum of a hundred thousand frankes / the which these.ii. ladies paid
so curtesly: that king Henry was well content. And as soon as the king of
Mayllorques was departed he returned into Naples / and tarried not there: but
did so much that he had gold and silver / and many fre^des in diverse parts.
and than took his way to the intent to make war on the king of Arragon his
adversary / whom he could not love / for he had slain his father / and kept
away his heritage. And so the king ca^e to Auygnon to pope Gregory the.xi. and
there he tarried a month / and there made his complayntes in such wise that the
pope agreed to his desire y^ he should make war against the king of Arragon /
to the intent to recover his heritage. Than the king provided for men of war
all about where he could get them / and bought them derely: both english /
gascoyns / almaygnes / bretons and certain of the co^panyons / whereof sir
Gasyen of the castle / sir John^ Malestroyt / Syluester Budes / and Jaques of
Bray were capitayns. They were about.xii. hundred fightyng men / and so went
forth and entered into Nauer / and there tarried a season by the consent of the
king of Nauer. And so than entered into Aragon / and began war against the
king of Aragon / and over ran the country / and took little fortresses / and
sore traueyled the plain country / and rau^somed men and took prisoners. So
that ye king of Aragon / who douted greatly that war sent men of war to the
fronters / of whom the earl of Roq^bertyn / and therle of Rods were
capitayns. And while this war thus began cruel and fell / king James of
Mayllorques fell sick again in y^ vale of Sorey / of the which sickness he
dyed. And so thereby the arago ^eses had peace and rest for a great season after
and the companyons that had made war / departed and returned into France /
thither as they thought to have some advantage and profit. Now let us speak of
the duke of Lancaster.

How the duke of Lancastre wedded theldest daughter of king Dampeter of Spain
/ and how the confederacions were made bitwene the french king and the king
of Spaygne. Cap. CC.lxxxxv.
THe duke Johan of Lancaster / who was in the city of Burdeux on Garon / and
with him diverse barons / knights and squyers of Acqitayne: for as than
fortune stood metely well on the english part. How beit diverse barons of
P^^^tou and of Limosyn / were turned to the french party / and they made
often yssues and s^ry mysshes against their enemies. This duke of Lancastre was
a wydower without a wife / for the good lady Blanch of Lancastre and Derby /
was disceassed. Than the barons of Gascoyne / consydred that king Dampeter of
Castle had two daughters by his first wife / who was suster to ye king of
Portyngale / who were as than in the city of Gascoyne. Thither they were
brought by the sea / to be kept by certain knights fro the parties of Cyuell
/ for doubt of king Henry. As Soon as they knew the death of their father / the
two ladies were dysconsolate and in great trouble / that it was great pite: for
they were true herytoursto Castle / by right succession of king Da^peter
their father. The which matter sir Guyssharde Dangle showed to the duke / sayng
thus. Sir / and it like you ye are to mary: and we knew where is a great
marriage for you / whereby you and your heir shall be king of Castle. And also
it is great alms to confort maidens in their bistresse / and specially
daughters to a king / being in y^ case that they be in. sir: we your faithful
servants / would counsel you to take theldest to your wife / for we can not
tell where ye should be so well married again / nor where that so much prosyte
should come to you thereby.

UHese words and other entered so into the dukes heart / and so well pleased
him: y^ he was well content to send for the two ladies / theldest called
Co^stance / and the other Isabell And so he sent four knights for them / and
there spedde so^ in their journey / that they brought with them the said ladies.
And when the duke knew of their coming he rode out of Burdeaur to mete with
them. And a little fro Burdeaur / in a vyllage called Rochsort / he married y^
eldest called Constance. At the which day of marriage there was a great feast
and great no^bre of lords and ladies: and thanne the duke brought his wife to
Burdeux. And than there was again great feast and joy made / and the good lady
and her suster were greatly feested there / by the ladies and damsels of
Burdeux / and given to them great gifts and fair presents / for the love of
the duke.

UHe tidings came in to castle to king Henry / and to the barons of that
realm who were alyed by fay the and homage to him / how that his nese had
married with the duke of Lancastre. And also it was informed them / that the
younger should be wedded to the earl of Cambridge / when the duke were returned
in to England / whereof king Henry was right sore displeased / and called all
his counsel toguyder. Than was it counsayled him / that he should send great
messangers to the french king to treat with him / to which counsel the
king agreed. And sent wise and sufficyent personages into France. And so
they departed and did so much by their iourneys / that they came to the city
of Paris where they found the king who received them with great joy and feast.
And so between the king and these counsaylours of king Henry / who had
procuracyons sealed / to treat and to proceed in all causes in the name of
their lord: in any plyament / treaty / counsel / secret or otherwise to
take effect. Finally the same season there were a corded / ordained / and
confyrmed: alyaunces / and confederacions right great and large / and sworn
so^e^ply on both parties / to hold fermly and not to break / nor to do
against it by no manner of way: but that those two kings to abide fermly in an
unity of peace / love / and alya^ce. and there the french king swear by the
word of a king / that he would aid and help the kings of Castle in all his
business: and to make no manner of peace nor acorde with the king of England /
but that he should be comprised in the same. To this treaty sir Bertram of
Clesquy helped greatly / for he loved enterely the king Henry. After these
things confyrmed and agreed: the ambassadors departed and returned into
Spaygne / and found their lord at Lion in Spaygne / who was right ioyouse of
their coming home / and that they had so well sped. And by reason of this
alyaunce / king Henry thought himself better assured and conforted / than he
was before.

How the duke of Lancaster ordained governors in Guyen and led his wife
with him in to England / and how the king of England ordained the earl of
Penbroke to be governor in Poitou. Ca. C C.lxxxxvi.
Now let us return to ye duke of Lancastre who was in the cite of Burdeux
and so about the feast of saint Mychaell / he thought to re turn in to
England / the better to inform the king his father of the business of
Acquitayne. And so a little before his depture / he ordained therefore and
assembled in the city of Burdeux / all the barownes and knights of Guyen /
such as were english. And than he showed them how he was purposed to return
in to England / for certain matters for the profit of them all and of the
country of Acquitayne / and that the next somer after he would come thither
again if the king his father were so pleased. These words pleased them all.
Than the duke ordained the lord Captall of Beufez / and the lord of Musydent
/ with the lord Lespare: to be governors of all the country of Gascoyne /
that was english. And in Poytou he ordained to be governors: sir Loyes
Harcourt / the lord of Parteney. and in Xaynton / sir Loyes Dargentou and sir
Wyllyam of Mou^tendre / and left all ^is seneschals and officers as they were
before. And it was ordained that there should go with the duke into England
certain persons of Gascoyne / Xaynton / and Poictou: to show to the king of
England the state and business of Aquitayne. As sir Guyssharde Dangle / the
lord of Pynan and sir Aymery of Tarse: and to abyue for them / the duke
tarried a certain space and when they were all ready apparelled they entered in
to their ships in the hauyn of Burdeux. So the duke departed with a great
company of men of arms and archers / he had a threscore vessels with his
company and purueyau^ce and led with him his wife and her suster. And they
spedde so well on the sea and had so good wind / that they arrived at Hampton
in England and there issued out of their ships and entered into the town. And
there rested them the space of two days and than departed and rode to wyndsore
/ where the king received the duke his son / and the ladies damsels / and
knights strangers with great feast: and specially he was glad to se ser
Guysshard Dangle. The same season dyed the gentle knight sir Gaultier of Manny
in the city of London / whereof all the barons of England were right sorry /
for the truth and good counsel that they had always seen and herd in him.
He was buried with great solempnyte in the monastery of the charterhouse beside
London / and at ye day of his obsequy / there was the king and all his
children: and the prelates banrons and knights of England. And so all his
lands both in England and beyond the sea fell to the earl Johan of Penbroke
/ who had to wife the lady Anne his daughter and heir. So the earl of
Penbroke sent to enter in to the land that was fallen to him in Heynault by.
ii of his knights / who did so well their deuor^ with the duke Aubert / who
as than held the erldome of Heynalt in rule / that they atteyned their purpose.

ALl that winter there were diverse counsayls in England among the lords / for
the state of the realm / and how they should me^tayne the war the next somer
following. And so were of intent to make two viages / the one in to Guyen / and
the other into France by Calys way / and the king sought for friends in all
parties / as well in Almayne as in ye marches of the empire / where as he gate
diverse knights and squyers of his acorde: also he made a marvelous great
apparel for his host / that the like had not ben often seen before. The
french king had knowledge of their secrets / and what they were in purpose to
do / whereupon he took counsel and made prouisyon: and fortifyed his cities /
towns / and castles in Pycardy / and set in every place great garysons of
men of war to thentent to defend the country fro all mysaduenture. When that
somer was come / and that king Edward of England had holden his feast and
solemnyte of saint George at wyndsore / as was his usage yearly to do. And that
ser Guyssharde Dangle was entered into the same fraternity with the king and his
children / and other barons of England / the which were called in the
fraternity / knights of the blue garter.

THan the king went to London to his palace of westmynster / and there he had a
great counsel for the orderyng of the realm. And because that the duke of
Lancastre should that season pass in to France / by the playnes of Pycardy /
and the earl of Cambridge with him The king at the desire of sir Guyssharde
Da^gle and of them of Poyton. Ordained that the earl of Penbroke should go in
to Poictou to vysyte that country / and to make war against the frenchmen on
that side. For the gascoyns and poicteuyns had required the king by their
letters / and by the mouth of sir Guyssharde Da^gle / that if he would not
send any of his sons that he would send the earl of Penbroke / who^e they
greatly loved and desired to have / for they knew him for a good knight and a
hardy. and so the king of England said to the earl of Pe^broke before all his
barons and knights / that were there assembled in counsel. John^ fair sofie:
I ordain you to go in to Poictou / in the company of sir Guyssharde Dangle.
And there ye shall be sovereign and governor of all the men of war that ye
find there whereof there be great ple^tie (as I am surely informed) and also of
all them that gothe with you. The earl kneled down before the king / and
said. Sir / I thank your grace of the high honor that ye put me to: sir I
shall gladly be there to do you service / as one of your leest marshals. So
thus brake up the counsel and the king returned to wyndsore / and had sir
Guyssharde Dangle with him / and spoke to him often times of the business of
Poicton and of Guyen and sir Guyssharde said to him. Sir as soon as my lord
the earl of Penbroke be ones arrived there / we shall make good war: for we
shall be to the nombre of four or five hundred spears / all obeyng to you. so
they may be well paid their wages. Than the king answered. Sir Guysshard /
care you nothing for hanyng of gold or silver when ye come there / to make
war, withal / for I have enough. And I am well content to enploy it on that
marchandyse / sithe it touches me and my realm.

How the earl of Penbroke departed out of England to go into Poyctou / and
how the spanyerdes fought with him in the hauyn of Rochell. Cap. C C.lxxxxvii.
THus with such words the king past the time often with sir Guysshard Da^gle /
who^ he loved and trusted as reason was. So the season ca^e that therle of
Pe^broke should depart / and so took his leave of the king / and all his
company. And ser Others of Grauntson was ordained to go with him / he had no
great company with him / but certain knights / by the enformacyon of sir
Guissharde Dangle. But he had with him such certain sum of money / to pay
the wages of three thousand men of war. And so they made speed till they
came to Hampton / and there tarried.xv. days abydinge wind / and than had they
wind at will. and so entered ito their ships and deperted fxo the hauyn in ye
name of god and saint George / and took their course toward Poitou. King
Charles of France / who knew the most perte of all the counsel in England / I
ca^ not tell how nor by who^e. But he knew well how sir Guysshard Da^gle was
gone into England / to the^tent to get of the king a good captain for the
country of Poytou: and also he knew how therle of Penbroke should go thither
and all his charge. The french king was well aduysed thereof / and secretly
sent an army of men of war by the sea / of spanyerdes at his desire because
his own men were gone to king Henry of Castle / because of the confederacyon
and alyaunce / that was between them. The spanyerves were forty great ships
/ and.xiii. barks well purueyed and decked / as these spaynysshe ships be.
And soueraynes and patrones of that flete / were four valyaut capitayns:
Ambrose de Boucquenegre / Cabesse de Uacadent / Ferrant de Pyon and Radygo de
la Rochell. These spanyerdes had lain a great space at ancre in thesce /
abydinge the retournyng of the poicteuyns / and coming of therle of Pe^broke.
For they knew well how their ente^tes were to come to Poitou / therefore they
lay at ancre before the town of Rochell. And so it happed / that the day
before the vigyll of saint Johan Baptyst / the year of our lord god. M.iii.
hundred.lxxii. The earl of Penbroke and his company should arryue in the hauyn
of Rochell / but there they found the foresaid spaignyerdes / to let them
of their arryuyng / who were glad of their coming. And when the
englysshemen and poicteuyns saw the spaignyerdes there / and parceyued how
they must needs fight with them / they conforted themself: howbeit they were
not agally matched / another of men nor of ships. How be it they armed them /
and put them self in good order / their archers before them ready to fight.
And tha^ the spaynisshe ships / who were well provided with a great nombre of
men of war and brigantes / with arbalasters and go^nes / and with great
bars of iron / and plomettes of leed to cast down. Anon they began to
aproche / making great noise: the great ships of Spaygne took the wynd to
fetch their turn on the english ships. Whom they but little feaced: and
so came with a full sail on them. So thus at the beginning there was great cry
and noise of the one and other and the englisshmen bare them self right well.
And there the earl of Pebroke made certain of his squyers knights to: honor.
There was a great battle and a harve the englysshmen had enough to do / for
the spanyerdes that were in the great ships had great bars of iron and
great stones / and did cast them down to perse the english ships / and
hurt therewith many a man right yuell. And among the knights of England and
Poictou / great nobleness of knight / hode and prowes was showed. The earl of
Pe^broke fought and received his enemies right fersly / and did that day many
a noble feat of arms with his own hands / and in like manner so did sir
Oaths Grau^tson / sir Guissharde da^gle / the lord of Pynan / and all other
knights.

How they of Rochell town would not socour the earl of Penbroke / and how
the seueschall of Rochell / and the lord of Tanyboton and other / came to
socour him. Cap. CC.lxxxxviii.
ANd as I have herd reported by them that were there at ye same battle /
that the englysshmen and poyctenyns that were there / desired greatly to
co^quer laud and praise in arms. For there were never men that did more
valyantly / for they (...) but a few people in regard to the (...)des and
also far less nombre of ships: and less of quantyte. Therefore it might
well be marueyled how they endured so long / but the noble knightode that was
in them / reconforted them / and held the^ in their strength. For if they
had been like in ships / the spanyerdes had taken but little advantage of
them. They held them self so close toguyder / that none durst abide their
strokes / without they were well armed and pauessed / but the castyng down of
plommes of leed / great stones / and bars of iron / hurt and troubled them
marvelously sore. And hurt and wounded diverse knights and squyers. The people
of the town of Rochell saw well this battle / but they never auaunsed them
to come to help the earl of Penbroke and his company / who so valyantly there
fought with their enemies / but did let the^ alone. Thus in this battle
and strife they endured till it was night / and than they departed each fro
other and cast their ancres but this first day the englysshmen lost.ii. barges
/ laded with their prouisyon / and all that were within put to death. The
same night sir Johan of Hardan: who as than was seneshall of Rochell made great
desires to the^ of the town. As to the mayre Johan Chaudron / and to other:
that they should arm them / and cause to be armed all the cominalte of the
town / and to enter in to barges and ships. And to go aid and comfort their
company / who all the day had so valiantly fought with their enemies. But they
of the town / who had no will to the matter: excused them self / and said:
that they had enough to do to keep the town. And how they were no men for
the sea / nor wist not how to fight with the spanyerdes on the sea / but if
the battle were on the land / they said they would than gladly go forth. So
the seneschall could not get them forth / for nothing that he could do. The
same time within ye town: there was the lord of Tanyboton / sir Jaques of
Surge res / sir Maubrune of Linyers: who also desired them of the town to go
forth. But when they saw that their request could not avail: they four
knights went and armed them and all their company / such as would go forth
with them / the which was but a small nombre. and so they entered in to four
barks / and at the brekynge of the day when the fludde came / they went to
their company / who gave them great thank for their coming. And so there
they she wed unto the earl of Penbroke / and unto sir Guyssharde Dangle. How
they of the town of Rochell / would not come forth to help to aid and
socour him and his company. Than the earl answered / and said. Well / than it
must behoue us to abide the grace of god / and ye adventure of fortune.
Trustyng ones to find the season to cause them of Rochell / to repent their
unkind dealyng.

How the earl of Penbroke was taken prisoner / and disconfyted by the
spanierdes: and how they departed fro the hauyn of Rochell with their
prisoners. And the same day the Captall of Beutz came in to Rochell. Cap.
CC.lxxxxix.
When the day was come and that ye fludde began / the spanyerdes wayed up their
ancres / making great noise with trumpettes / and set them self in good
order / as they did ye day before. And furnysshed their great ships fulle of
men of war / and took the advantage of the mind to close in the english
ships / who were nothing to the nombre of the spanyerdes. And so the
foresaid four patrones of the spanyerdes came before in good order. The
englysshemen and poyctenyns / saw well their order: and so drew all together /
and set their archers before them. Therewith came on the spanyerdes with full
sail / and so began a feirse and a cruel battle. Than the spanyerdes cast
great hooks of iron / and graped their ships toguyder to the english
ships / so that they could not be part. With the earl of Penbroke and sir
Guyssharde Dangle / there were.xxii. knights / who right valiantly fought with
such weapens as they had. Thus fightyng they continued a long space / how
beit the spanyerdes had to great advantage of the englysshmen / for they
were in great ships / and cast down great bars of iron and stones / the
which sore traueyled the englysshmen. Thus cryeng / showtynge / and fighting
each with other: they endured till three of the clock. There were never men that
endured more traueyle on the sea / tha^ the englysshemen did there that day /
for the most part of their men were sore hurt / with the casting of bars
of iron / stones / and plomettes of leed. So that sir Aymery of Tharse ye
valyant knight of Gascoyne was there stayne and also sir John^ Lantonne / who
was knight for the body with the earl of Penbroke. To the earls ship / there
were fastened four great ships. Whereof Cabesse of Wakadent / and Dom ferant
de Pyon were governors / and in them were many good fightyng men. And they did
so much / that they entered into the earls ship where was done many a feate
of arms: and there therle was taken and all that were in his ship / taken or
slain. First there were takenne of his knights / sir Robert Bufforce / sir
Johan Cursone / and sir Johan of Grimyers. And slain there was: sir Saymon
Houssagre / sir John^ Mortayne / and sir Johan Couchette. and there fought
still the poictenyns: as sir Guyssharde Dangle / the lord of Pynan / the lord
of Canyboton / and diverse other knights of their company. And in another
ship was sir Oaths of Grau^tson / Ambrose of Boucquenegre / and Radygo of
Rochell / and they were all takenne by the spanyerdes / so that none escaped:
but outher they were taken or slain. But when they had taken the chief
masters / they left slayeng of servants / for their masters desired that
they would forbere them. Saying how they would pay for them all.

ALl such as were in like danger / as the earl of Penbroke / and sir
Guyssharde Dangle were in: should be feign to take the adventure that god would
send the^. And beside the loss of so many good knights and squyers / as were
takenne and slain the same day. The king of England lost the greattest loss
for by the same disconfyture / he lost after all the hole country: as ye shall
herafter in this history. And as it was showed me / thenglysshe ship wherein was
all the treysure and richesse / where with sir Guyssharde Da^gle should have
paid all soudyers wages in Guyen / was perysshed and drowned: and all that was
therein / so that nothing thereof came to profit. All that day the which was
the vigyll of saint Johan the Baptyst and that night / and the next day till
it was noone / the spanyerdes lay still at ancre before Rochell / making great
joy. And it for tuned well to a knight of Poictou / called ser Jaques of
Surgeres: for he spoke so swetely and so fair to his master / that he was
quyt: with ye payeng of three. C. fra^kes. And so he ca^e on salt John^s day to
dinner in to the town of Rochell by him there it was known / how ye journey was
spedde / and who were slain and who were taken. and diverse burgesses of the
town / showed by semblant how they were sorry and displeased. Howbeit they
were in deed right ioyouse / for they never naturally loved the englysshemen.
And so whan^oone was past on saint Johans day / and that the tide came on.
Thespanyerdes wayed up ancres and spread their seals / and so departed making
great noise of trumpettes and other mynstrelsies. And they had long stremers
wauynge in the wind beaten with the arms of Castle / with other penous and
standerdes: so that it was great pleasure to behold them. Thus in this case
they departed and took there course toward Galyce / and the same day of saint
Johan / there came to Rochell a great no^bre of men of arms gascoyns and
english / who had not as than herd of that adventure: but they knew well
that the spanyerdes lay / and had lain a long space before the hauyn of
Rochell / and therefore they came thither to conforte and a yd the town. Of the
which men of war of gascoyns / there was the Captall of Beufz / ser Beras de la
Launde / sir Peter of Landuras / sir Soudyc / and sir Bertram de Frank. And of
englysshmen / there was sir Thomas Percy / sir Richard of Pontchardon / sir
Wyllm^ Ferryton / sir Dangoses / sir Baudwyn of Fra^uyll sir Water Hewet / and
sir Johan Deureur. When these lords and their company / who were to the nombre
of sire hundred men of arms were come to Rochell / they of the town made them
good chere outward / because they durst do none otherwise. Than they were
informed by sir Jaques Surgeres / of the battle of the spanyerdes on the sea /
and showed them how he was him self at the same battle / taken and
raunsomed. Of these tidings were the barons and knights right sorry and
displeased / and reputed them self right unfortunate / that they had not ben
there: and complained greatly the loss of the earl of Pe^broke / and of sir
Richard Da^gle. So thus they tarried at Rochell / I can not say how long: to
take counsel and advise / how they should do and maynteyne forth the war.
Now let us leave a little while to speak of them / and let us speak of sir
yuan of Wales / how he did the same season.

How ^ir yuan of wales disco^fited thenglisshmen in the isle of Gernsay / and
how the french king sent into Spain for men of warr^ / to lay sege to
Rochell. Cap. CCC.
THis yua^ of Wales / was son to a prince of Wales / whom king Edward had put
to death: I ca^ not say for what cause. And so gave the principalyte to his
son^e / and made him prince of Wales. So this yuan came into France and
complained to king Charles of France / of the iniuryes that the king of
England had done to him / as in slayeng of his father: and taking away of his
he rytage. So the french king retained him / and aduaunsed him greatly / and
made him governor of certain men of war. And so the same somer / the king
delivered him four thousand fightyng men / and sent him to the sea / and took
shippyng at Harflewe / and so sailed forth toward England / and so came to
they will of Gern* say against Normandy: whereof Aymon Rosse a squire of honor
with the king of England was captain. And when he knew y^ the frenchmen were
aryued in the isle / and yuan of Wales with them: he was nothing content. And
so made his somons through the isle / the which is not great in quantyte / and
so he assembled / what of his own and of them of the isle / to the nombre
of.viii. hundred. And so came to a certain place / and there fought with ye
said yuan where there was a sore battle / and endured along space. How beit
finally the englysshmen were disconfyted and flayne in the same place / mo than
four hundred. And so this Aymon fled away or else he had been deed or taken: so
he saved him self with much pain / and entered into a little castle a two
leages thens / called Cornette: the which the same Aymon had well fortifyed
before. Than after this disconfytur / the said yuan drew together his men / and
had knowledge how that Aymon was entered into the castle of Cornette. Than
he drew thither and laid siege thereto / and made diverse assautes: but the
castle was strong and well purueyed with good artyllary: so that it was not
easy to be won. During this siege before Cornette / the aduentur fell on the sea of the taking of the earl of Penbroke and sir Guyssharde Dangle / and their
company before Rochell (as ye have herd before) Of the which tidings / when
the french king herd thereof he was right joy ouse / and intended thereby the
rather to pursue the war in Poictou. For than he thought that if the
englysshmen began ones a little to declyne / that lightly the cities and towns
would give up / and render themself to him. Than the french king desermyned
that in to Poyctou / Xaynton / and Rochelloyse: he would send for that season
his constable thither / with certain men of arms / and to make hot war in
those countrees / both by land and by see: saying that the englysshmen there
as than had no capttayne nor chief ruler. Than the french king sent his
letters to the said yua^ / who lay at sege before the castle of Cornet / in
the isle of Gernsay. Of the which siege the king was well informed / and how
the castellby lykelyhod was in preignable. Therefore the king commanded him
after the sight of his letters / to deperte and break up his siege. And to
enter into a ship / the which the king sent him for the same purpose / and
so to sail into Spain to king Henry / to get of him barks and galeys / and
his admyrall and men of war / to come and to lay siege by the sea / to the
town of Rochell. When the said yuan saw the kings message and commandment
/ he obeyed thereto / and so brake up the siege and gave leave to his company to
depart / and delivered them ships to bring the^ to Harflewe. And himself
entered into a great ship and took his course toward Spain. Thus befell of
the siege before Cornette / in the isle of Gernsay.

How the king of England was sore displeased of the taking of therle of
Penbroke / and how sir Bertram of Clesquy took the castle of Mount morillon.
Cap. CCC.i.
THe king of England was sore displeased wha^ he herd how the army that he had
sent in to Poictou was overthrown by the spanyerdes on the sea / and so were
all such as loved him / how be it they could not am^de it for that time. tha^
the sages of therealme thought surely that the country of Poictou and of
Xaynton was likely to be lost / by reason of the said mysse hap: and this
they showed to the king and to the duke of Lancastre. So they were long in
counsel on the matter / and so determined as than: that the earl of Salysbury
with five hundred men of arms should go thither. But what s^^uer (...) s^yle or
advise was taken / there was nothing done / for there came other busynesses in
hand out of Bretayne / that let that journey / where of the king repented
him after / when he could not remedy it. So it was / that the spanyerdes who
had taken the earl of Penbroke (as ye have herd before) they tarried a certain
space on the sea / because the wind was contrary to the^ Howbeit at last they
arrived at the port saint Andrewe in Galyce / and so entered into the town
about noone. And so brought all their prisoners in to the Castle / all bound
in cheanes of iron acordyng to their custom / for other courtesy they can not
show. They are like unto the almaynes.

THe same day / yuan of Wales was arrived with his ship in the same port /
and so took land and entered in to the same house / where as Domferant of Pyon /
and Cabesse of Wakadent had brought the earl of Penbroke and his knights. And
so it was showed yuan as he was in his chamber / how the englysshemen were in
the same house as prisoners. And this yuan had great desire to se them / to
know what they were. and so he went forth in to the hall / and as he went
thither he encountered with the earl of Penbroke / whom he knew right well /
yet he had not often seen him before. Tha^ he said to him as in reproach / a
earl of Pe^broke / are ye come in to this country to do homage to me / for
such lands as ye hold in the principalyte of Wales / whereof I am rightful
heir / the which your king has taken fro me / by yuell counsel and
advise. The earl of Penbroke was abashed / when he saw that he was a prisoner
and in a strange land / and knowing not the man that so spoke to him in his
language. And so answered shortly / and said. What are you that give me this
langage? I am quod he / yuan / son to prince Aymon of Wales / whom your king
of England put to death wrongfully / and has disheryted me. But when I may by
the help of my right dear lord the french king / I shall shape therefore a
remedy. And I will ye know: that if I may find you in any place conuenyent /
that I may fight with you / I shall do it. and she we you the right y^ ye have
done to me: and also to the earl of Herforde / and to Edward Spe^ser. For by
your fathers with other counsaylours / my lord my father was be trayed /
whereof I ought to be displeased / and to amend it when I may. Than stepte
forth a knight of the earls / called sir Thomas of sait (...) to speak and
said. yuan / (...) and maynteyne that there is any (...) or has been in my
lord / or that he owes or should owe any homage to you / or any (...) his
(...). cast down your gage in that quarrel and ye shall find hun that shall
take it up. Thanyuan answered and said. ye are a prisoner. I can have none
honor to apele you for ye have not the rule of yourselfe: for ye are under the
rule of them that have taken you. but when ye be quyte / than I shall speak
with you more of the matter for it shall not rest thus. And so with tho words /
certain knights of Spaygne came between them: and so departed them a sondre.
And so wtin a while after the said. (...) capIte^s led for the their
prisoners toward the city of Burges in Spayn / to yield them to king Henry /
who as than was there a byding. And when king Henry knew of their coming and
that they aproched nere to the city: He sent his eldest son called Johan /
who was called as than / the child of Castle with great nombre of knights
and squyers / to mete with these englysshmen / to do them honor: for the
king knew tight well what aparteyned to nobleness. And wha^ they were come to
him he did them much honor / both with words and deeds. And than anon
after the king sent them into diverse pertes of his realm to be kept.

How let us return to the business of Poitou / ye which was not little: and
let us speak of the gascoyns and english knights / who on saint John^s day
at night came to the town of Rochell (as ye have herd before) and they
weresore displeased / in yt they ca^e not the day before to have been at the
battle / to have ^ought with the spanyerdes. So tha^ they took counsel what
thing was best for them to do / for they had great dout of the^ of Rochell.
Than they ordained sir Johan Deureux to be seneshall of Rochell with three
hundred men of war to keep ye town / for they thought that as long as they
were strong enough in the town / they durst not rebel. This order was taken
by the Captall of Beufz / who was chief gouernoure of that company: and sir
Thomas Percy / sir Dangoses sir Richard of Pontchardon / the Souldyche / sir
Bereas de la Land and other with their companyes / departed fro Rochell / to
the nombre of four hundred spears / and took (...) way to Subyze for there
were certain bre (...) held churches and small forteresses / and had
fortifyed them. But as soon as these lords came thither they drove them away
and wanne their holds / and rydde clean those marchesse of them. And the same
season there kept the feldes in the marchesse of Aniou / Auuerne / and Berrey
/ the constable of France / the duke of Berrey / the duke of Burbone / the
earl of Ale^son the Dolphyn of Auuergne / ser Loys of Sa^xere / the lord
Clysson / the lord de la Uale / the vycount of Rohan / and the lord of
Beaumanoyre / with a great no^bre of the barony of France / to the nombre of
three thousand speres. And they rode so long / till they assembled all together
with the constable in Poyctou / and so laid siege to a castle / called
Mountmorillon: and with assaut wan it / and slew all that ever were within /
and new manned it with frenchmen. And than they went to Chauigny / sta^dynge
by the river of Cruse and beseged it / and there lay two days / and on the
third day the place was yielded up and they within taken to mercy. Than they
rode further and came to Luzat / where there was a town and a castle: and so
they also yielded them up / without abiding of any assaute. Than they went to
the city of Poicters / and lay one night without among the vynes / whereof
they of the city were sore abashed and douted of a siege / how beit they
had none as at that time. For the next morning the frenchmen departed and
went to the castle of Moncou^tour / whereof John^ Cresuell and Dauyd Holegraue
were capitayns / and had under them threscore hardy and valyant men of war /
who greatly had constrained the marches of Aniou and of Thourayne / and other
french garysons: wherefore the constable said he would not deperte thens / till
he had it at his pleasure.

How the constable of France besieged Mountcomptour / and how he departed
thens to go to the duke of Berrey and of Limosyn to besege saint Severe. Cap.
CCC.ii.
THe constable of France with all ye said lords and knights rode so long that
they ca^e to the castle of Montcountour / a six leages fro Poycters. And when
they were come thither they laid siege thereto / and assailed it valyantly. And
because the dykes were so broad / they caused tymbre and wode to be cut down
by the villayns of the country / and to be brought thither and cast in to the
dikes to fill it and to cast straw and earth thereon. And so in four days they
filled so the dykes that they might with their ease go to ye walls. Than they
made a sore assaut / and they within defended them self valyantly (...) of the
which they had great need so to do / for they were in great parell of taking:
how be it they were so valyant and so good me^ of war / that they kept the^
self and their place with much pain / from any hurt that day. And so the
sirt day / the constable and bretons came again to the assaut: with pauesses /
pykes / and matockes in their hands: and so pearsed the walls in diverse
places / so that they within weresore a basshed. Howbeit they defended the^
self as valia^tly as ever men did. And John^ Cresuell and Dauyd Holegraue who
were capitayns / ymagyned and consydred the parell that they were in and
parceyued how the constable and his company were not in mind to depert / till
they had won the castle. And they saw well / that if they were taken by
force / they should all dye. and also they parceyued how there was no comfort
coming to them fro any part. Wherefore all things co^sydred / they entered
into a treaty to yield up them self / their lives and goods saved. And the
constable / who would no lengar grieve his company / nor to sore oppress them
of the castle / because he saw well they were valyant men of arms. He was
content they should depart without any hurt of their bodies / so they took
no goods with them except gold or silver / and so they departed and were
conveyed to Poicters. Thus the constable had the castle of Montcountour / and
new fortifyed it: and so tarried there a space to refresshe him and his company
/ because he wist not as than whyder to draw / other to Poicters or to some
other place. When they of the cite of Poicters knew how the constable and
bretons had won again the castle of Montcountoure / than were they more
abashed tha^ before. And sent incontinent their messangers to sir Thomas Percy
/ who was their seneshall: and was riding in the company of the Captall. And
or sir Thomas Percy knew of those tidings / sir Johan Deureur who was in the
castle of Rochell / was informed how the constable of France had been before
Poicters and aduysed the place: whersore he thought verily they should be
besieged. And also he herd how the seneschall was not there / wherefore he
thought he would go and conforte them of Poicters. And so departed fro Rochell
with a fyftie spears / and set a squire called Pbylpot Ma^seyle to be
captain there / till his return again. And so rode to Poiters and entered
in to the city / whereof they within thanked him greatly. Than these tidings
came to sir Thom^s Percy / who was with the Captall from his men / in the city
of Poicters. Desyringe him to come to them / for they feared of a siege to be
laid to them / and that he would bring with him as much help and aid as he
could. Certifyenge him how the frenchmen were strong. Than sir Thomas showed
these tidings to the Captall / to the intent to know what he would say
thereto. The Captall said he would take advise on that matter. And so the advice
taken / he was not de^myned to break his own journey for that matter / but he
gave leave to ser Thom^s Percy to depart fro him / and so he did / and rode
to Poicters: where he was received with great toye of them of the town / for
they great lie desired his presens. And there he found sir Johan Deureux / and
so each of them made great there of other. All this was showed to the constable
/ who was still at Montcountoure / and how that they of Poicters were newly
refresshed with men of war.

THe same season came to his knowledge / how the duke of Berrey with a great
nombre of men of war: of Auuergne / Berrey / and of Burgoyne / and of the
marchesse of Lymosyn. Was fully determined to lay seige to saint Severe in
Limosyn / which parteyned to sir John^ Deureux. And capitayns thereof under
him: were sir Wyllyam Percy / Richard Gylle / and Richard Horn / with
acertayne nombre of good men of war. And they had before ouerronne the
country of Auuergne and Limosyn / and had done much yuell: wherefore the duke
of Berrey was determined to draw thither. And sent and desired the constable /
that if he might in any wise to come to him / for the said intent. The
constable / who was a wise and a subtell knight in all his deeds consydred well
/ yt to lay siege to Poicters should little avail him / seeing the cite new
refresshed with men of war / wherefore he said he would draw to the duke of
Berrey. And so departed fro Moncou^tour with all his host / and ordered for the
keeping of that garyson. And so rode forth till he came to the duke of Berrey /
who thaked him much of his coming / and all his copany. So they was a great
host when both hoostes were assembled together. And so they toue toguyder till
they came before saint Severe they were well a four thousand men of arms /
and so belieged the garyson and determined not to depart thens / till they
had won it / (...) so fetrsly assailed it. And sir Wyllm^ Percy valiantly
defended the fortress. These twdynges came to the cycle of Poycters and to sir
John Deureur who was lord of saint Severe. How the duke of Berrey / the
doulphyn of Auuergne the costable of France / the lord Clysson / and the
vicount of Rohan / with four thousand men of arms had besieged the fortress
of saint Sever in Limosyn whereof sir Johan Deureur was right pensive / and said
to sir Thomas Percy / who was there present at the report making. Sir Thomas /
ye are se nelhall of this country, and have great puyssaunce. Sir I require
you help to socour my men / who are but lost if they have no help. sit quod
he glad would I be to synde remedy for them / and for the love of you / I will
depart and go with you. and let us go speak with my lord the caprall of Beufz
who is not far hens / and let us do our best to move him to go and help to
reyse y^ siege and to fight with the frenchmen. Than they departed fro Poicters
/ and left the keeping of the city with the mayre of the same / called Johan
Reynalt / a good true and just man. And so long they rode toygder / that they
found y^ captall in the feldes / ridyng toward saint John Dangle. Than these
two knyght^ showed to him / how the frenchmen had taken Mountmorillon beside
Poietres and also the strong castle of Montcountour / and were as than at
siege before saint Severe / parteyning to sir Johan Deureur. and also they
showed him how sir Wyllm^ Percy was within the castle / Gylle / and Richard
Horn: who were no men to be lost. The Captall studied a little at those words
/ and than answered and said. (...) what think you best that I should do? to
the which counsel there were diverse knights called / and they all answered:
and said. Sir it has been a great season that we have herd you say / that ye
desire greatly to fight with the frenchmen. And sir ye can not better find
the^ that now. Therefore sir draw thither / and send out your commandment
into Poictou / and Amou: we shall be men ynowe to fight with them, with the good
will we have thereto. By my faith (...) the Captall I am content / we shall
shortly fight (...) the^ / by the grace of god and saint George. In contyne^t
the captall sent letters to the barons / knights and squyers / of Poictou /
and of Xaynton: prayeng and straightly co^maundynge the^ to come to him / to a
certain place lymytted. All such as his commandment came unto / came
toward the Captall in all have they could: there was the lord of Partney /
sir Loys Harcourt / sir Hugues of Uynou / sir Perciuall of Colen / sir Amery of
Rochchoart / sir Jaques of Surgeres / sir Geffray of Arge^ton / the lord of
Puissance / the lord of Rosyllon / the lord of Campenac / sir John^ Dangle /
sir Wyllyam of Mo^tender / and diverse other. And when they were assembled
together / they were a nine hundred spears / and tyue hundred archers.

How they of saint Severe endutyng a great assaut / yielded them up to sir
Bertram of Clesquy: and how the city of Poicters turned themself french.
Cap. C C C.iii.
THese tidyndes came into the host before saint Sever to sir Bertra^ of
Clesquy / and to the other lords there. How that thenglisshmen and poicteuyus
aproched fast to them ward / to thentent to reyse their siege. When y^
constable herd that / he commanded every man to harness: and to go feirsly to
the assaut so there was none that disobeyed his commandment. Than they came
frenchmen and bretons before the forteresse / well armed and pauessed / and so
there began a great assaute: every lord under his own baner. What should I
say? it was great beauty to behold them / for there were.xlix. baners and a
great nombre of penons. And there was the constable and sir Loys of Sa^rere mat
shall greatly traueyling to encorage their men to thassaut. There aduau^sed
forth knights (...) squiers of all nations to increase their honor and did
marueyls marmes / for some passed clean through the dykes which were full of
water / and so ca^e to y^ walls. And for all that they could do that were
within / they would not recule back: but ever went forward. And on the dykes
there was the duke of Berrey / the duke of Borbone / the earl of Alenson / the
dolphyn of Auuergne and the other great lords in couragyng their people. and
because these great lords beheld the^ / every man auau^sed him self more
wyllingly / not doutyng the parell of death. sit Willyam Percy (...) the two
other squyers of honor capitayns of the fortress / saw well how they were
fersly assailed without any rest and so to continue / it was not possible for
them to keep the places and also they saw no conforte^ mynge to them ward
for any part / for they knew none of their friends nere to the^ by the space
of.x. leages. And therefore they entered into a treaty with y^ constable in
eschewyng gretter damage. How be it sir Bertram the cosstable was well
informed / how y^ same night he should here tydinges of thenglysshmen:
therefore he agreed the sooner with them of the castle and so received them
saving their lives / and entered into the fortress with great joy (...) made
great feast. Than he caused all his company to draw in to the field / and to
set them in order of battle ready to fight / and said to the^. Sirs auyse you
well / for our enemies aprocheth fast I think yet or it be night / we shall
have battle: therefore let every man make him ready. Howbeit the englysshmen
made no great ha^^ when they knew that saint Severe was taken. Now let us
speak of them of Poicters and / how they maynteyned themself.

THe same season it fell so / y^ they of Poicters were in great discencyon
among themself: For three parts of the town would gladly have turned
french. But John^ Reynalt mayre of the town and part of the come^tie / would
abide still english: howbeit y^ rychest burgesses and the me^ of the church
/ whereof there were great ple^tie / would y^ in any wise y^ constable of France
should be sent for. and so they sent secretly to him: that he should come
hastelye and take possessyon of the city / for they promised him to open the
gate against him. wherefore the co^^able was right ioyouse. And showed the matter
to the duke of Berrey / and to the duke of Burbone. And so they agreed that the
constable should depart fro thehoost: with three hundred of the best horsed men
of their company. And so he departed and rode that say and night following with
little rest / more then.xxx. leages / by a another way than the englysshmen
kept. And so in the mornyngethey arrived at Poitres / and there found the
gates open: and they ready there that should receive them. And if they had
tarried lengar / but the space of a leage ridyng / they had come to late. For
John Reynalt and such of his part had sent in all have / for sir John^ of
Ubrues and for sir Johan Percy / who with a hundred spears and a hubre^
archers were ready the within a leage of the city. ^f the taking thus of the
good city of Poicters were the knight^ and squyers of Gascone of Poictou / and
of England sore abashed: such as were assembled toguyder there in Poyctou /
who were to y^ nombre of. viu. C. spears / and four hundred archers. Than they
drew to counsel / to determyne how to be ruled: for they saw well they
were in great parell / and will not well in whom to put their trust. Than the
barownes and knights of Poycton spoke a word / to conforte the englysshmen:
and said. Surely sirs / it greatly displeases us / the besy nesses of this
country and that we can not amend it. But sirs / be you in suertie / y^ as
long as we can endure / and that there is any house or fortress in Poycton
that we may draw in to / we shall be true and faithful to our natural lord
the king of England: and to you. Than the englyss he knightis y^ were there
said. Sirs / that is our specy all trust / and to dye in the quarrel: ye shall
find us ever true companyons. So thus in the field there was great counsel
among them (and so all things consydred) it was determined / that the
poicteuyns should draw to gyder one way / and the englysshmen a another way. So
there they depted right amiably each fro other: that is to say / the lord of
Pertenay / the lord of Thouars and of Rosilly / sir Aymery of Rochchoart /
John^ Dangle / Loyes Harcourt / Percyuall of Coloyne capitayn of Thowars /
Hughe Briane / Reynalte of Thouars / Wylliam of Ca^penac / Jaques of Surgeres /
and other knights / took the way to Thouars And the englysshmen: that is to
say / sir Johan of Ubrues / sir Richard of Pontchardon / Thomas Percy /
Dangoses Geffray Dargenton / Mathewe Fonques / Thomas Gourney / Water Hewet /
Johan Cresuell and other: took the way to Nyorth / where they thought to have
entered without any let. But when they came thither / they found the gates shyt
/ and the bridgs drawn: and they of the town said to the^, how surely they
should not enter there. Than they drew together to counsel / and determined
not to suffer that dealyng: and so in good array they assailed the town / and
they within defended them. Howebeit there was within no gentylman that wist what
the warrement / and so they were conquered by the englysshmen. But if they
could have kept the town against the^ ^yll it had been night / they had been
greatly conforted. For the constable of France had sent thyber Thybalt of
Pount / with two hundred men to have refresshed y^ town / how beit they came
to late. The town was taken with assaute and robbed / and a great nombre of
men and women slain: and so there abode still the englysshmen / to harken
after other news.

How the frenchmen took the Captall of Beufz before Soubise in battle / and
how they of Rochell turned french. Cap. CCC.iiii.
THis while thenglisshmen were in Nyorth / and durst not well deperte a sondre
/ there ca^e before Rochell yuan of Wales / in the company of ye admyrall of
king Henry of Spayn called Da^pradigo de Roux / and with him.xl. great ships
(...).viii. galys full of men of war and so they laid them self before the
town in manner of a stege / so y^ none could issue nor enter without danger.
Than they within Rochell seeing the^self not well assured / fell in treaty
privily with yuan of Wales and with the admyrall of Spain / and so agreed yt
they within nor they Woute / should not trouble nor vex each other. but still
the spanyerdes and frenchmen lay before the town at ancre / and had their
spies abroad in ye country of Poitou and Xayn ton / to know and se what was
done in every place. The captain of the castle of Rochell / was called
Philippe Mansell. The constable of France who was at Poicters * sent the lord
of Pouns and Thybault du Pont / with a three hundred spears to the castle of
Soubise / which was strong and sta^dyng on the sea side open before ye mouth
of Tharent as the sea gives. And Win the castle was the lady thereof / with no
great company of men of war / howbeit she sent by a squier for socour to John^
of Granuyll and to the captall of Beufz costable of Acqtayne who were at saint
John^s Da^gle. and in contynent as soon as he had word thereof / he sent for
sir Henry Hay seneshall of Angoleme / and for sir Wylliam lord of Marnell /
nephue to sir Raymond of Marnell / Johan Cresuell / and for sir Thomas Percy /
who incontinent came to him. All this assemble and ordinance of ye siege /
yuan of Wales was informed thereof there he lay at Rochell. Than he took four.
C. spears of the most speciallest / and surest men of war of all his company
and did put them in to three barges. and so departed him self and sir James of
Mount^^ye / and Morellette his brother and left Radigo de Rouxe admyrall of
Spain there still / with the resydue of his company. And so he rowed secretly
toward Soubise / and arrived on the other side right against the lord of
Pouns / who knew nothing of that busshement. No More did the Captall who made
his assemble at saint John^s Dangle / for if he had known thereof / he would
have taken with him a gretter company than he did. For he sent back a great
part of his company* and left another part within the town of saint Johans
Dangle / and so departed with two hundred spears and no mo. And so rode so
long / that about night time / he came nere to the host of the frenchmen /
and nere to the castle of Soubise: Than he alighted beside a little wode / and
rested a little their horses and them self. And than mounted again and
displayed their baners and penons / and so suddenly dasshed in to ye french
host / making their cries. there was a sore scrimysshe / and many a man slain
and sore hurt / for the frenchmen were not ware of the^. and so there was taken
the lord of Pons and Thybault of Pount / and a.lx. of the best of their
company / and the other put to slight. tha^ yuan of Wales came in with his rout
/ who had passed the tharent with their barges / and brought with them great
nombre of tortches / fagottes / and other ablementes for fire: For the night
was very dark. So he with four hundred speres of fresshe men and lusty /
dasshed in among the^glysshmen and gascons / who thought that they had clean
acheued all their enterprise and so were spread a broad and not together / about
their pyllage / and taking head of their prisoners and so by clean force they
were beten down / and within a short space disconfyted. There auau^sed forth
a hardy squire of Uerma^doyse / called Peter Danyels: and he aproched so nere
to the captall of Beufz that he took him prisoner by clean feat of arms /
which captall was as than the knight / other of Gascon or of England / that
the french king and the frenchmen desired most to have / because he was right
hardy and a good captain. Also there was taken ser Thom^s Percy by a priest
of Wales / called sir Dauy / Also there was taken sir Henry Hay / sir Mores
Line / and diverse other. And sir Water Huetscaped with much pain sir Petyton
of Corton / sir Wylliam Ferencon and Carmyll / fled toward the town of
Soubyse / and had no socour: but that the lady of Soubyse was at the barryers
/ and caused the gate to be opened / and so they entered and diverse other. The
next day yuan of Wales brought all his barges and ships before Soubise / and
gave a feirse assaut / and also so did the lord of Pons and Thybalte of Pont
/ who were before taken and rescued. Howbeit they within y^ town defended them
self right valiantly / but the lady saw well the town was not strong enough
to endure a long space against them / and had no hope of any socour: seeing that
ye captall was taken prisoner. Tha^ she called her knights to counsel and
took such advise / that ^he sent to treat with the frenchmen. Which treaty
took such effect / that all such knights as were within the town might
depert at their pleasur Wout any damage / and to draw to Niorth / to Xaintes
and to Lusygnen: or whyder soever it pleased the^. and the lady of Soubise to
put her self under the obeisance of the french king / and all her land. Thus
deperted thenglysshmen fro Soubyse / and were brought in sauegard whider as it
pleased the^. Tha^ the frenchmen took possessyon of the town and fealty of
the lady / and she swear fro thens forth / to obey the french king and all her
land. Than yuan of Wales ser James of Mou^tioy / and their company took their
ships / and so brought the captall and other prisoners into their great
ships / yt lay still before Rochell. and y^ lord of Pons and the other
bretons hasted them greatly to ride with a great company / such as y^
constable of France had sent the^: as the vycont of Rohan / the lord of
Clysson / Torayne / Beaumanoyre / and of Rochfort / sir Wyllm^ of Bordes Olyuer
of Ma^ny / Reynalt of Limosyn / Geffray Ricon / yon of Lanconet / Alayne of
saint Poule / Carsuell and diverse other. And they ca^e before the town of s.
Johan Dangle / and made great assemblant to assaut it. And they within the
town saw how the country began fast to be lost / and that their chief
capiten was taken prisoner and saw no socour fro no perte / yielded the^ up and
became french. Than the bretons rode to Augolesme / and in likewise they turned
to the french pertie / and so did after Talybourge. and than they ca^e before
Xayntes / where they lay before it two days for the capiten thereof called
Fere^con / said how he would not yield up so lightly and so made good se^blaut
of defense. and within y^ town was the bishop thereof / who was good french:
he turned so the cytezins that they took their captain / and said they would
s^e him / without he would consent to yield up the town to be french / and so
for fear he agreed to the^ / so y^ he and all his might depert quyte and
clear. And so he did / and the frenchmen took possession of y^ cite and the
castle of Xaintes. and sir Willm^ of Fere^con was conveyed to Burdeur. Before
Rochell lay still at ancre yuan of Wales / in the company of Da^pradigo the
rour admyrall of Spain / with.xl. great ships. ^iii. barges / and.viii.
galys of Spain. There was great treaty between the^ of the town and the^
without / howbeit they (...) in could not turn french as long as the castle
was english / and in the possessyon of englysshme^. wherefore they held still
dissimulyng with the^glyshmen / till ever little and little thenglysshmen
deperted. And so the lord Deureux had left the garyson in the keeping of a
squire / called Philyp Mansell / who had with him about a hundred co^panyons
one and other. and a burges was mayre of the town / called John^ Caudrer who
on a day assembled togiderperte of the^ that were wyllinge to beco^e french
rather than english / and said unto the^. sirs / we se daily how our
neighbors turn french / and I fear lest y^ shortly we shall be so enclosed /
that we shall not know which way to stir / nor to issue out of this town.
Therefore it were good that be times we took head / how we might get ye castle
/ the which so often times has done us trouble and displeasur / and now it is
but easily kept. for Philyppe Mansell is not greatly ingenyous: I shall show
him / that I have received a commandment fro the king of England /
co^teyning how I should cause all the men of the town to be armed / and to
come into a place that I shall name / and so to take the musters and a vieu the
nombre of them: and also of the^ of the castle / and so to write again the
certe^tie thereof to the king. And so thereby I shall command him in the kings
name to come out of the castle / and to make his musters / and I believe he
will do so lightly. And than let us be well provided of a busshment / of two
hundred men in harness / lyeng among the old walls without the castle. So
that when they of the castle be issued out / than let them step forth /
between them and the bridge / the which as than will be auayled down. And
than let us all be ready to furnysshe our enterprise / and so we shall take
them at our pleasure. and thereby we shall have both the^ and the castle: and
so they were all agreed to this purpose. And than they perseuered in this
purpose so long / till y^ mayre who was chief of this enterprise on a day /
desired Philippe Mansell to come to him to dinner and diverse other great
burgesses / such as were of the english part. And so he made a great dinner
/ and talked of diverse matters par taynynge to the king to England. And after
dyuer the mayre brought for the a letter / sealed with the kings great seal
to cause Philippe Mansell to believe him the better / who could not read / now
be it he knew well the seal. And so than the mayre read the lettre as it
pleased him / other wise than it was written. Than the mayre said to Philippe.
Sir yese and here how the king our sovereign lord has commanded me / and
also that I should command you in his name / that ye make to morrow your
mustres and in like wise so shall we do ours. And he who thought none yuell /
said he was content so to do / and so departed. The same night or it was day /
the mayre took two hundred men and put the^ in a busshment nere to ye castle /
among the old walls that were there: and in the morning the mayre caused ye
watch bell to be sow ned / and every man in the town to be armed. Philyppe
Mansell in likewise / caused all the^ within ye castle to be armed / whereof
there were a. l^. sufficient and able men of war. Than he issued out of the
castle: and wha^ he was ones past the busshement / than they stepte forth
between ye bridge and thenglysshmen than the englysshmen saw well how they
were betrayed. Than they ran at them of the busshment / to have gotten again
thentre in to the castle / but the mayre came incontinent with all the
comynaltie of the towne^ to the nombre.ii. M. men. So there the englisshmen
were assailed both before and behynd / and all taken: for they were feign to
yeloe them / saving their lives. Howbeit for all that / yet they of the town
had not ye castle ^or thenglysshmen had left.xii. of their company still
within the castle / who had drawn up again the bridge. Tha^ the mayre ca^e
to Philippe there captain and to his company / and said. Sirs / harken what I
say unto you. Without ye yield up inco^tynent the castle all your heedes shall
be stryken of at the bridge foot. The englysshmen answered and said: they would
do the best of their powers / to deliver to the^ the castle / and so they went
and spoke with them that were in ye castle. And so they agreed to deliver up
the castle / on the condycion that all those within the castle / and also all
such as were taken should be put in to a ship / and co^ducted in save guard
/ by the mayre and burgesses of Rochell to the city of Burdeur. Thus they were
agreed and so they of Rochell had the castle. And as soon as the dukes of
Berrey / of Bur bone / and of Burgoyne / the marshall of Sanrere / the bycont
of Rohan: the lords of Sully / of Pons / of Clysson / of Beaumanoyre / and
diverse other barons of France: herd of these tidings. They departed fro
Berrey / and fro the marchesse of L^^osyn and Aniou: and determined to draw
toward Poicters / where the constable of France was. And in their going
thyderward / these lords took by the way in Poictou a town called saint
Maxa^t / which was yielded to them: as soon as ever they came thither / and the
castle was taken with assaut / and all they within ssayne. And after that they
took the castle of Marle / and than^e the castle of Dowaye / and diverse
other forteresses that they found in their way. And when they were come to
Poiters / they sent certain messangers to treat with the burgesses of Rochell:
how beit they of the town would not open their gates to let in those lords /
and said they would not yield up so sone. howbeit they said / that if it would
please ye duke of Berrey and the other lords there / to send the^ a save
conduct to come to Poiters wtinsixe days: than they would bring their hole
minds in that behalf. The french messangers returned to these lords / and
showed them the mind of the^ of the town of Rochell. Than the conduct was
granted the^ / and to Poycters went certain of the burgesses of Rochell / and
said to these lords of France: how they were well content / to be under the
french king / so that they might cast down their castle to the earth: and
that there beneuet castle made there more. And on that condicy / on the town
of Rochell and all rochellois / should be for ever / under the resort and
demayne of ye french king / and never to be put away by marriage or any manner
of peace / that may hap to come to the realm of France / or by what so ever
co^dycion it be. And also they of the town to have a mynt / to forge money
both white and black: of the same form and alay as is in Paris. But the
lords of France would not agree to all this / till they knew the french
kings pleasure in that behalf. And so the lords gave save conduct to the^ of
Rochell / to go the the king to know his pleasur. And so.xii. of the
burgesses of the town went to Paris to the king who accorded to their desire /
and feested them greatly / and gave the^ great gifts. And when they were
returned to Rochell / they showed their charters sealed by the king / and
confyrmed in the chamber of the king and of the peers of France. And so
inco^tynent was beaten and rased down to the earth the great castle of
Rochell. And than they sent to ye great lords of France at Poicters that they
should come to Rochell / and that they would set open the gates to them And so
thither came the constable of France / and two hundred men of arms with him /
and there they were received with great joy. and to him they did feaultie and
homage as to the french king / for he had good procuracion fro the french
king to receive it / for the king had stablysshed him in those parties of
P^^ardye / representyng his own body.

How sir Bertram of Clesquy constable of France / took diverse castles in
Rochelloys. And how the king of England took the sea to come and reise the
sege at Thouars. Cap. ccc.v.
When the constable of France / sir Bertram of Clesquy had be four days in ye
town of Rochell / and had showed the^ of the town / how they should order
themself for thens forward. Than he departed and went to Poycters to the
foresaid dukes and lords. And so with the^ he went into the field to conquer
certain fortresses on ye marches of Rochell / and he was to ye nombre of three
thousand spears. And so they departed fro Poyctres / and went and besteged the
castle of Benon / which was a fair castle and a strong / and so they said
they would not depart thens / till they had it at their pleasure. And in this
castle there was a capitayn under the captall of Benon / a squier of the
county of Foiz called Wyllm^ of Pons / and with him a knight of Napless /
named sir James. There ye french lords made diverse assautes / and they within
defended themself right valyauntly / and not far there is there was the
fortress of Surgeres / wherein there were certain englysshmen y^ kept it
vnderthe captall / and so in an euennyng they said how they would go and a wake
the french host. And so there rode forth a.xl. spears / with some ye they
had sent for fro Marant / and so they came sovenly into the constables lodging
/ and did hurt diverse of his men: and specially they ssewe a squier of his.
Than the host began to stir and to arm them as soon as they might / and
the englysshmen who had done their enterprise without danger returned again
to their for tresse without any damage. Whereof ye constable was so sore
displeased / that he swear never to depart thens till he had taken the castle
of Benon / and slain all those within it. And so the same morning / he caused
all manner of men to arm the^ and to draw for the all manner of a bylementes of
assaut. and gave such an assaut. y^ long before was not seen such another /
for tha^men of arms and bretons entered into dykes / not sparynge them self.
And so came to ye foot of the walls with pauesses on their heed^ and mined the
walls with pikes / that it was marueyle to behold them. And they did somoche
that they beat down a great pane of ye wall / whereby they entered without
danger: and so the castle was taken / and all they within slain / as many as
could be found. Than after the said constable / caused the same castle to be
again repaired / and set therein a new garyson of frenchmen. Than he drew to
the castle of Morant / and they within yielded them up / saving their lives
and goods. And than they went to Surgeres / which also yielded up to ye
obeisance of the french king / but the englyshmen were deperted / for they
durst not abide the coming of the constable. And so than after the constable
went to the castle of Fountnay the county / which the wife of sir John
Harpen / dan kept / and so they beseged the town and castle / and gave thereto
diverse assautes. Finally they within by composicyon departed with the lady as
many as would / and so were by the constable conveyed to Thouars. So the
frenchmen had the possessyon of the town and castle of Fou^tuey / and
refresshed it with new people.

THan the constable and lords of France went and laid sege to Thouars / where
as the most part of the knights of Poictou were. As the vycont of Thouars /
the lords of Pertney / Pousanges / Corse and Crupenac / and sir Loyes of
Harcourt / Geffray Dargenton / James of Surgeres and Percyuall of Coloyne. And
these french lords had made at Poicters and at Rochell diverse engyns where
with they assailed / and traueyled greatly the poicteuyns within Thouars. And
so all things consydred / they entreated with the frenchmen to have a peace
for themself and for their lands syll the feast of saint Michaell next
following / which should be in the year of our lord. M.iii. C.lxii. And in ye
meaue time / they to send to the king of England their lord / to certifye him
of their estate and co^dycion / so that if they were not aided by him or by one
of his sons within the said term: than they to yield them and their lands
to the obeisance of the french (...). This treaty was agreed unto / and than
the knights of France returned to Paris / and thither was brought the Captall
of Beufz and put in prison under sure keeping / in a tower in the temple. And
the king who was right glad of his taking caused to be delivered to y^ squire
that took him.xii. thousand frankes. And so the messangers that went fro the
poicteuyns came into England and showed to the king / to the prince / and to
their cou^sayls: the state of Poictou / and of Xaynton. And when the king saw
how he lost with so little war / the countries and lades that had cost him
so much the wynning / he was in a great study a long space And than he said /
how that shortly he would go over the sea himself with such a puyssance
that he would abide to give battle / to the hole power of France. And said how
he would never return again in to England / till he had coquered again as
much as he had lost / or else to lose all the resydue. The same season there was
agreat army ready charged to attend on the duke of Lancastre / and should arryue
at Calys. But than it was ^^imyned by the king and his counsel / that they
should go into Poyctou and in to Xaynton toward Rochell / for yt was thought
to be the next voyage / and most needful. And the king made a great somons
throughout the realm of England / co^maundyng every man to come in harnes to
Ha^pton / and there about at a day assigned: and there to take the sea. So there
was none that durst nor would disobey his commandment / but every man departed
fro his own country / and drew to the sea side / where there was ready a four
hundred vessels / of one and other. And the lords drew to the king to
Westmynster beside London. and there it was ordained between the king and the
prince his son: that if the king of England dyed in this viage / or the
prince: that than Richard the son of the prince / who was borne at Burdeur /
should be king of England. So that when all the lords were come before the
king / or they departed / the prince showed the^: that if it happed him to dye
before the king his father than his son Richard to be king of England /
after the discease of his graundfather. The prelates / lords / knights / and
all ye comynalte / loved so well the prince / for the ma^ay fair iourneys that
he had acheued / as well in England as beyond thesee / that they all a(...)
thereto ioyously. The king first / and than all his sons / and after all the
lords of England ^o the which the prince caused the^ all to swear and scale
or he departed. All these things done: the king / the prince / the duke of
Lancaster / therles of Ca^bridge / Salisbury / War wyke / Arundell / Suffolk /
and Stafforde / y^ lord Spenser who was newly come out of Lombardy. The
lords of Percy / of Uyen / of Rose / of Dalawar / and all other barons and
knights of England / to the nombre of three thousand men of arms / and.x. M.
archers / who came all to Ha^pton where they took shyppyng / with as great a
flete / as ever any king went before out of England in any voyage. And so they
sailed toward Rochell / in costynge Normandy and Bretayne / and had diverse
wyndes. And the french king made a great assemble of men of war in Poictou
to hold his journey at Thouars / at y^ day appointed. So all the country was
full of men of war: also the gascons and the lord Arche^balt of Grayly /
uncle to the Captall of Beufz / at the desire of ser Thom^is Felton seneshall
of Burdeux ca^e with three. C. speres. And in the same company there was the lords
of Duras / of Corton / of Musydent / of Rossen / of La^goren / and of Landuras:
ser Peter Corton and sir Wyllm^ Fereton englysshemen. All these deperted fro
Burdeux and came to Nyorth / and there they found sir Water Huet sir John^
Ubrues / sir Thom^s Percy / Johan Cresuell and diverse other / so yt when they
were all together / they were a.xii. C. fightyng men. and sir Richard of
Pontchardon ca^e to them with other.xii. C. All this season the king of
England and his sons with their great army were on the sea / and could take
no land at Rochell nor there about / for the wind and fortune was contrary to
the^. And in that case they were the space of.ix. wekes / so that the feast of
Myhelmas aproched / and yt the king and his counsel saw well how they could
not come time ynow to keep the day of rescuyng of Thouars / where of the king
was sore displeased / and so gave lyce^ce to all his people to deperte wheder
they list Thus returned this great navy of England and had wind at will at
their returning / and there arrived at Burdeux.ii. C. fayles of merchants of
England for wine. And when it was nere mighelmas / the barons of England and
Gascone ca^e fro Niorth to go toward Thouars / to mete with the king of
England: and when they saw that the king came not they had great marueyle.
Than to acquyte themself / they sent certain messangers to Tho wars to the
barons of Poictou / such as were there / which messa^gers said. Right deresirs
/ we be sent hyder to you fro y^ lords of Gascone and England / under they
obeysaunce of the king of England. Sirs there be about Nyorthe twelfe hundred
fightyng men ready apparelled to aid and serve you in all manners and sirs they
desire to have knowledge sro you / whyder that in the absence of the king of
England and of his children / they shall aid and confort you or not. For sirs
they are well content in your company / to aduentur their bodies and goods.
The barons of Poictou said: how they would take counsel and advise in that
cas^ / but sirs: we thank greatly the barons of Gascone and Englade / who
has sent you hyder: in that they be ready to socoure us. Than the knights of
Poictou drew together / and so the first day they greed not / for the lord of
Parteney, who was one of the greattest of that company / woldeth at they should
keep their day / and receive the said aid / representynge the king of
England. And the other lords were of the contrary opinyon: saying how they
had sealed and sworn / how that if the king or one of his children were not
there personally by the said day / than they to yield them up to they obeisance
of the french king. Wherefore the lord of Partney went to his lodgyng not well
content / how be it afterward he was so entysed by the other / y^ he agreed
to their minds. And so they sent word again by the said messa^gers, that
they thanked them of their good wylles. How be it the king of England or one
of his children must needs be there / acordyng to the treaty that they had
sworn and sealed unto. Where with the gascoyns and englysshmen that were at
Nyorthe were sore displeased / but they could not amend it. And so myghelmas
day came / and fro Poy cters there came to Thouars to hold their journey * the
dukes of Berrey / of Burgoyne / and of Burbone / the constable of France / the
lord of Clysson / the dycount of Rohane / the Dolphyn of Auuergne / sir Loyes
Saurere / the lord of Sully / and other great lords of France. And they were
ten thousand spears beside other. And so before Thouars / the even and the
day ofsaynt Mychaell they stood in ordinance of battle / and against night
they withdrue the^ to their logynges. And in the morning y^ two brethren of
the french kings and the constable of France / demanded of the knights of
Poictou within Thouars to deliver the town acording to their promise and oaths
in that be half. They answered / and said: how y^ shortly they would come to
Poicters / and put themself and all their lands / under the obeysaunce of the
french king / which answer was sufficyent to the lords of France / and so
departed fro Thouras / and the dukes gave lyc(...) to the most part of their
companyons.

THe lord Clysson departed with a great nombre of men of war / appointed him
by the constable. And so went to Mortayne on the sea / the which was as than
english / and captain thereof was a squire of England / called James Clear:
and he had with him a threscore co^panyons. And when the lord Clysson was come
before Mortayne / he made a feirse assaute / at the which he was him self,
How be it with that assaute he wanne nothing / and s^ at night he drew to his
lodgyng. Than the captain within seeing him self sore oppressed / he sent
privily to the lordz of Gascoyn and of England being at Nyorth / showing the^
yt if they would com thither by night he would receive the^ into his fortress:
whereby they might lightly pass through the lodgings of the lord Clysson /
who had with him but two hu^dredmen. And so secretly these lords departed fro
Nyorthe with five hundred spears / and rode by night till they came to
Mortayne / for they habbe great besyre to atrape the lord Clysson / howbeit a
spy / who departed with the^ fro Nyorthe knew all their ententes. And so he
came hastily to the lord Clysson / and found himsyttynge at supper: and said.
Sir your enemies are departed fro Nyorthe to the nombre of.v. hundred / and are
coming on you. Thanne the lord Clysson put the table fro him and armed him
in have and mounted on his horse and all his company. And so departed and all
his suddenly / and left behind them a great part of their caryages / and rode
so long that they came to Poicters: And the englysshmen who sailed of their
ententes / returned again to Nyorthe right sore displeased. And anon after
they departed fro Nyorthe and left in garyson there: sir Dangoses and Cresuell.
and sir Johan He wet returned in to England / and all the other went to
Burdeur / and in their returnyng they brent the lord of Partneys lands. Thus
all Poictou was conquered / except these fortresses: as Nyorth / Elyseth /
Mortymer* Mortayne * Lysignen / Castle / Accart / la roche Suryone / Gausar /
the toure of Larbre Merris and other. Which fortresses made diverse yssues and
assautes on their neighbors sometime chasyng and sometime rechased again.

How sir Bertram of Clesquy beseged the castle of Syreth / and how the
englysshmen were disconfyted / and how all the country of Poictou / of
Xaynton / and of Rochell / were clean delivered out of the^glysshmens hands.
Cap. CCC.vi.
THe duke of Bretayne / who was pesably i^ his own country / was sore
displeased of the damage of the englishmen. For it was said / that y^ king of
England and his puyssaunce had made him as he was: and that he had / had
nothing / and the king of England had not ben. For he always made war for
him / and lend him silver and gold: and also he had his daughter in marriage.
For the duke would gladly / that his country should rather hold of the king of
Englandes part / than of France. How beit the most part of the lords /
knights / and squyers of Bretayne / were in their hertes good french. And
specially the lord Clysson / and de la Uale / and the vycount of Rohan / who
as than were the chief rulers in all Bretayne: and these lords said to the
duke. Sir / as soon as we can parceyue that ye take any part with the king of
England / again the french king our sovereign lord / we will all forsake
you / and leave the country of Bretayne. How be it the duke could not hyde
the courage of his heart: but said. Sirs ye do great wrong to the king of
England: and spoke great words to certain of the lords of Bretayne. The
french king / who had drawn to his love the hertes of them of Bretayne: except
sir Robert Canoll. Desired the^ / that if they saw any defense made by their
duke / that they would give him knowledge thereof: to the intent to find remedy
therefore. The duke parceyued well / how that his men had him insuspect / and
laid great a wayt on him. Than he douted leest they should send him to Paris
/ wherefore he sent to the king of England / showing him what case he was in:
desyring him to send him men of war to defend him if need were. And the
king of England sent him the lord Neuyll / with four hundred men of arms /
and as many archers / who arrived at saint Mathewes defyne poterne. And there
held them in the to ^^ne without doing of any manner of damage to the country /
but paid truly for that they took. And so there they were all the winter: the
duke would never put them in to any fortress y^ he had. And when the knights
of Bretayne / saw these englysshmen come in to the country / to the aid and
confort of the duke they took it in great in dignacion / and closed their
fortresses / and showed much yuell will toward the duke. Thus the matters
abode in great varyaunce all that winter.

ANd as soon as winter was past / sir Bertram of Clesquy constable of France /
departed fro Poicters with.xiiii. hundred fyghtyng men. And so went and laid
sege to y^ town and castle of Syreth: and with him there were of breton
knights / sir Alayne of Beaumont / John^ of Beaumanoyre / Arnolde Limosyn
Geffray Ricoynan of Lanconet / Geffray of Konyell and diverse other knights and
squyers. And so they laid siege to Syreth / and closed them self about with
pales / to thentent not to be troubled in the night. Often certain of them
aproched to the fortress and scrimysshed with the^ within / who defended them
self right valyantly. So it fell this siege enduryng / that sir Robert Mycon /
and sir Nicotyn the scotte / who were kepers of the fortress / sent knowledge
of their estate to sir Johan Ubrues / and to sir Dangoses / capitayns of
Nyorthe. And they in contynent sent to them of the garyson of Lusygnen / and
Dangosey: and so they assembled at Nyorthe. And than departed to the nombre of
six hundred and seuyn spears / of good men of war / beside other folowers.
And so long they rode that they came to Syreth / for it was but four leages fro
Nyorthe. And when they were come to Syreth / than they rested them a space of
time / to apparel them self. But it had been better for them to have set on
the lodgings of the constable / for anon he had word of their coming / and
how they were araynged in the field. Hobeit the constable was not greatly
afraid / but made all his men to be armed and to draw toguyder / and than he
said. Now fair sirs / how say you? have you any will to fight with your
enemies / for I believe surely it must be houe us to fight. And they said: sir
we thank god / it shall be welcome to us. Than the constable aduysed to set a
busshment to watch them of the castle / for he thought well they would issue
out / and so set there two hundred for that intent. Thanne he caused to be cast
down the most part of the pales that were about their hoostes to thentent
they should not let him nor his company when he would issue out. And so
ordained two batayls / the one was governed by sir Alayne of Beaumount / and
the other by sir Geffray of Carnuell / and commanded that none should pass
before his baner without his commandment / and that every man should keep
their lodging.

Now let us speak of sir Robert Mycon and of sir Robert le scot / who were
above in the castle / and saw thenglisshmen ready apparelled in the feldes.
Than they said / let us arm our self and issue out / we shall so one pass
through these bretons / and as soon as our folks knows that we be fighting
with the^ / they will come on / and do great damage to them / or they shall
know of our issuyng out. And so they armed the^ / to the nombre of.lx. and
issued out a horseback to skrymysshe with the host / but they were encountered
with the busshement that was laid for them. And so there was a sore scrimysshe /
but the englysshmen were so enclosed / that they could another recule back nor
go forward: and so they were all taken or slain so that none escaped. The two
capitayns were taken. And all this season the other englysshemen were on the
field / and the constable still in his perclose / and issued not out: for they
feared that the englisshmen had some great enbusshement in the wode behind
them. The englysshmen had brought thither with them / a certain nombre of
poicteuyns and bretons / robbers and pyllers to the nombre of two hundred /
whom the englisshmen sent on before the^ / to scrimyshe with the french host.
And as soon as they ca^e before the constables battle / they turned the^
self / and said. how they were good french / and would be on the constables
part / if it pleased him. The constable said he was content to have them. Than
he set them on a wynge on the one side / and learned by them all the manner and
dealing of the englysshmen / and knew by them how they had no manner of
busshme^t behind them.

When the constable of France understood that / he was more toyouse than he
was before. Than he drew all his people toguyder / and caused de his bannerre
to auaunce forth / and drew to the wynge of his two bataylles / and went
forth a foot: casting down their pales / cryenge ourlady Clesquy. And when
the englysshmen saw them issue out of their hold / they raynged them self a
foot / and auaunsed forward with great desire. And at their first metyng they
encou^tred the co^stables battle / and fought there so valiantly / that they
passed through the battle / and brought many a man to the earth. But than the
bretons had wisely ordered their two batayls / being on the wyng. And so they
came on all fresshe and lusty / and basshed in so among thenglysshmen / who
were all weary / yt they were sore reculed back. Howbeit like valyant men and
full of courage / they fought with axes and swords of Bordeaux / wherewith they
gave great strokes. There were good knights on both parts / who nobly
adventured them self to exaulte their honors. This battle was as well fought
/ and as many proper deeds of arms done / in taking and rescuynge as had been
seen of many a day before in plain field / without any advantage: for every
man did his best to his power. there was many a man sore hurt and cast to the
earth with great myschefe. howbeit finally all thenglisshmen were dico^fyted /
so that few escaped / but other they were taken or slain. There were slain. it.
good squyers / Richard of Mesuyll / and Wylliam Dursell: and James Ubille sore
hurt. And there was taken sir John^ Ubrues / Aymery of Rochchoart / Dauyd
Hollegraue / Richard Olyue / John^ Cresuell / and diverse other of England and
Poytou. This bataile of Syreth / was in the year of our lord god / a M. three
hundred.lxxii. the.xxi. day of March.

And than after the constable returned and his folks in to their lodgings /
and took head to their hurt men and to their prisoners: whereof they had great
plenty. And afterward the constable sent to speak with them of the castle /
sir Alayne of Beaumounte / who showed them that if they were taken by force /
they should all dye without mercy. Than they of the garyson put the^ in to the
constables mercy / who received them to grace / for he suffered them to pass
quyte / and had save conducte to go to Bordeaux. Thus the french men had the
castle and the land: which was put under the obeysau^ce of y^ french king.
Tha^ the bretons in a great heat came before Niorth / which was a good town
in Poictou / and had all y^ season before ever sustained the englysshmen / for
they kept ever a great garyson. And as soon as they of Niorth / knew that
the constable came to them ward / they went out against him / and presented to
him y^ kayes of the town: and so brought him in to their town with great joy
/ and there the bretons refresshed them a four days. And than depted with
great array / they were a xiiii. hundred spears / and so went before the
forteresse of Lusiguen / which was yielded up to them by composicion so that
they of the garrison within departed: their lives saved / and as much as they
could carry before them of their own: and so had a save conducte / to convey
them to Burdeux. Thus the frenchmen had that castle and all the seignory / and
all the men thereof became subgettes to the french king. Tha^ the bretons rode
before the castle Alart / and the constable sent to the lady / wife to sir
Richard Dangle / who was there within to yield up the castle / And she
desired to have assurance ye she might go to Poicters to speak with ye duke of
Berry: The constable granted her desire / and caused her to be conveyed thither
/ by one of his knights. And wha^ she came before the duke she kneled down /
and the duke took her up / and demanded what was her request. Sir quod she. I
am required by the constable of France / yt I should put me and my lands /
under the obeysau^ce of the french king. And sir / ye know well y^ my lord
and husband lies yet prisoner in Spain: and sir his land is in my
governance I am a woman of small defense. And sir / I can not do with the
heritage of my husband at mine own pleasure / for peradventure: if I should
do any thing against his pleasure / he would can me no thank therefore / and
so should I be blamed but sir / to apease you and to set my land in peace: I
shall co^pounde with you for my self and all mine that we shall make you no
war / so that ye will make no war to us. And sir / wha^ my husband is come
out of prison / I believe well he will draw in to England / than I shall send
him word of this co^posicion / and than sir I am sure he will send me his
mind: and than I shall answer you. The duke answered / and said dame: I agree
me well to your desire / on this condition / that you nor none of your
fortresses provide for no men of war / vitayls / nor artyllary / otherwise
than they be at this present time: and so thus they were agreed. Than the lady
returned to her castle / and caused the siege to be raised / for she showed
letters fro the duke of Berrey / co^tayning the same purpose. Than they
deperted / and the constable went before Mortymer the lady whereof yielded
herself and put her and her lands / under the obeisance of the french king:
and also yielded up the castle of Dyenne which partayned to her. Thus was all
Poictou / Xainton / and Rochell quyte delivered fro the englysshmen. And when
the constable had set garysons and good sure keeping in every place / and saw
no rebellyon in those marches unto the river of Gyronde / than he returned in
to France: and also / so did the dukes of Berrey / of Burgoyn / and of
Burbone / and the most part of the barons of France: such as had been in
these said co^questes. The king greatly feested them at their retournynge / but
all was but iapes / when sir Bertram came to Paris to the king / for the king
could not honor him to much. So thus the constable abode with the king at
Paris in joy and myrthe.

Of the seige of Bercerell / and of the death of the king of scotts / and of
the peace bitwene the french king and the king of Nauar. And how the duke of
Bretayne fled in to England / and how the constable of France conquered
his duchy. Cap. CCC.vii.
THe same season the lords of Clisson / of Lauall / of Uangour / of Tournemen
/ of Rieux / and of Rochfort / the vicount of Rohane / sir Charles of Dignen
bannerette of Bretayne / the marshall of Blarouille / the lords of Hambe^ / of
Ruille / of Fou^teuyll / of Granuyll / of Farnyll / of Denneuall and of Cleres
/ banerettes of Normandy. And of other people great plenty of bretayne / and of
Normandy / and so they went and laid siege to the strong castle of Bercerell
/ and greatly they constrained it by assautes / within there were two capitayns
englysshmen sir Johan Aparte and sir Johan Cornwall / and with them certain
companyons / yt valiantly defended them self. At this siege there was done
many a noble feate of arms many issues many sautes / and many a scrymysshe.
And a little there beside there were at sege before saint Savior the vicount /
sir Thomas Trybles / sir Johan de Bourge / sir Philippe Pecharde and the three
brethren of Maluriers. So that or the seige were laid before them / those two
garysons ouerran all the country of base Normandy / so that no thing was abroad
but all in the forteresses. Also they raunsomed and took prisoners in the
bysshopriche of Bayeux / and Deureux / and the king of Nauer was consen^yng
thereto / for he conforted the^ diverse times both with me^ and vitayle / such
as were in his garrisons in the county of Deureux / for he was not acorded with
the french king / so that the garysons of Chierbourg / of Gouerell / of
Couches / of Bretuell / of Deureux / and diverse other under the obeysanuce of
the king of Nauerr / had greatly enpouered and wasted the country of Normandy.
But in the sametyme there was so good means made between ye two kings / and
specially by the labor of the earl of Sale bruses / who had taken much pain
between the^ / and also the bishop of Deureux. and they did so much / that
they brought the^ to acorde And so the two kings met together right amyable
at the castle of Uernon on the river of Said. And there were sworn diverse
great lords of France to keep peace / love / unite / and co^federacyon
together for ever. And so ye king of Nauer went with the french king in to the
realm of France / and there the king did him much honor and reverence /
and all his. And than and there / the king of Nauer put all his lands of
Normandy / into the hands and gouernynge of the french king / and lest his
two sons Charles and Peter / with ye king their uncle. Than he departed and
went back again in to Nauerre. Thus this peace endured foue years / howbeit
after there fell again between them great discord: as ye shall herafter in the
history / if ye will look therefore. How beit I think there will none end be
made thereof in this present book. The.viii. day of May: the year of our lord
a. M. three. C.lxxiii. there passed out of this life in the town of Edenborowe
king Dauyd of Scotland / and was buried in the abbay of Do^fre^^lyn / beside
king Robert de Bruise his father. He dyed without son or daughter / laufully
begoten of his body. But there was king after him by right succession a nephue
of his / named Roberts who was seneshall of Scotland a goodly knight / and he
had a son.

How there were a certain ordained in England to keep the country / and how
the earl of Salisbury / william Neuyll / and Phillyp Courtnay with diverse other
men of arms / enterd in to the sea: and landed in Bretayne. and how the
constable of France went thither and the duke of Bretayne went in to England.
Cap. ccc.viii.
THe same seson it was ordained in England / to the intent to keep the
country: that the earl of Salisbury / Willyam Neuyll / and sir Phylippe
Courtnay / should take the sea with a certain nombre of men of war. For it was
said how that yuan of Wales was coming by the sea / with six thousand men /
to land and brenne in the country. The lords of England had.xl. great
ships beside barges / and two thousand men of arms beside archers. Thus
they departed fro Cornewayle and there took the sea / and took their way
toward Bretayne. And so came to saint Malo the Isle / and there brent in ye
haven before the town a seven great spaynisshe ships / whereof all the
country had maruayle / and said: how they thought surely / that the duke of
Bretayne had caused them so to do. So in all towns castelles / and cities /
they had the duke in great suspect: and than kept more strayter their
forteresses / than they did before. The secretnesse of the dukes mind was
dyscouered / for certain knights of Bretayne / showed diverse words y^ should
be spoken by the duke. In so much that the fr^ the king ordained his constable
to make a journey into Bretayne co^mau^dyng him to take in to his possession /
towns / cytes / castles / and for tresses / and to sease all rebels: both
their goods and bodies. The constable deperted fro Paris and went to Angiers /
and there made his somo^s. And thither came the duke of Burbon / the earl of
Alenson / the earl of Perch / therle of Porceau / the dolphyn of Auuergne /
the vicountes of Meaulx / and of Dausnay / sir Rafe of Coucy / Robert of saint
Poule / Rafs Rauenall / Loys of Sansere marshall of France / and a great
nombre of the barony and chyualry of Uerma^ doyes / Artoyes and Pycardy /
beside the^ that came thither of the marches of Aniou / Poitou / and Tourayn.
And on the other patte the earl of Salisbury and all his army / being at saint
Malo the Isle / knew well of this french assemble / and saw well how all
the country of Bretayne was against the duke. And so depted fro thens with all
hysshyppes / and sailed so long that he came to Breast / which was one of the
strongest castelles in all the world / and when the duke of Bretayne knew of
the constables coming / he durst trust no lengar in them of Uennes and Dignan
/ nor in them being in any good town in Bretayn. and though^ y^ if he were
ones enclosed he should be in great perll. And so he went to the castle of
Alroy which is bitwene Ue^nes and Renes / which held of his part / for he
had made ruler there an english knight / called sir Johan Augustyne.

The duke left his wife with him desiring him to keep her well / and the knight
promised him so to do. than the duke rode to saint Mathues of fine potern / but
ye town was closed against him / from thens the duke went to Kouke / and there
tokeshyppynge: to thentent to arryue in England. So thus the constable of
France entered in to Bretayne / and there came in his company the lords and
knights of Bretayne / such as had been at the siege before Bercerell / and
they had left up the siege to the lords of Normandy. and when the constable
was come before Reins / they within who knew well he was come to cease in to
his hands for the french king / all the dukes lands / for the king and his
counsel said: how the duke had forfayted all his lands / because he had
sustained the englysshmen his enemies / in his towns and castelles. And also
that he him self took part with the king of England against the erowne of
France / of whom he held his duchy of Bretayne / by faith and homage.
Wherefore they of Reins thought to make no war / but peaseably ceceyued the
constable / and knowledged him for their lord in the name of the french king.
And when the constable had the possessyon of Reins / than he roode hastily to
the town of Dignan / the which yielded up to be under the obeysaunce of the
french king. Than the constable went before the cite of Ue^nes / the which
also yielded up / than he went to Luzemont / the which was assailed and taken by
force / and all they wtin slain. than the constable went to Jugon the which
put the^ self under the obeisance of the french king. In like wise did the
castle of Gouy and ye forest / and the Roch ^yen / and the town of Guigante /
saint Mathewe of Fine Poterne and saint Malo the Isle. than after the constable
went to Quipercorentyn / and it turned also french / and after Campelly / and
Credo / Galande / and diverse other forteresses there about. First the constable
ouerran Breton bretouant / because always it enclyned tather to the duke Johan
of Mountfortes part / than Breton gallet. And as ye have herd here before /
when the duke went in to England / he set sir Robert Canoll to be governor of
all ye duchy / howbeit there were but a few lords that obeyed to him.
Nevertheless he furnisshed well his castle of Dyriuall / and gave the keeping
thereof to a cosyn of his / called sir Hughe Broit and sir Robert went to Breast.
Than the constable went to Hanybout / and captain therein vuder the duke was a
squier of England / named Thomelyn Ubyche also therein was a knight sent by sir
Robert Canoll / called sir Thomas Priour and they were a fourscore / what one
and other. And as soon as the frenchmen were come thither they began to assail
the castle / and brought with them thither fro diverse places / certain engyns
and great gonnes / wherewith they had won diverse castelles and forteresses and
specially the town of Ca^pelly was taken / whereof James Rosse a squire of
England was captain / and he could not be taken to mercy / for he fell in
the hands of sir Olyuer of Clisson who slew him with a glayue and also he
slew diverse other with his hands for he had no pity nor mercy of any
englysshman / that fell in his danger.

NOwelet us retourn to the siege of Hanibout. The constable of France / who
had caused his engines to be reared up against the town and castle / and went
to the saut and swear yt he woldesuppe in the castle: and they within defended
them self valyauntly. Than the constable said / sirs: ye that be within / it
is of certain that we shall co^quere you / for we will suppe this night within
the town. Know for truth / yt if any of you cast stonne or quarrel / whereby
that the leest of our company be hurt / I make mine auowe to god / ye shall all
lose your lives. Which words abashed so them of the town / that they went
into their houses and let the englysshmen alone / who defended themself right
valyauntly / as long as they might endure. But the town was so great / that
the englysshmen could not take heed of every place. So the frenchemen entered
in to the town and all the englisshmen slain: except the two capitayns / who
were taken. And because that they within the town obeyed the constables
commandment / he therefore commanded that none should be so hardy to do any
manner of damage.

When the constable of France had thus conquered the town and strong castle
of Hanybout he tarried there. xv. days / than he went to the town Kouke. And in
ye mean time therle of Salisbuty / sir Wyllm^ Neuyll / sir Bertram Stapleton /
and sir Wylliam Luzy / who hadd new refresshed the forteresse of Breest /
both with men of arms / archers / artyllery / and vitayle tokeshippyng: to
thentent to defend the country / for the frenchmen were still in the field in
Bretayne / and ye said englisshmen wist not whyder the constable would brawe.
but when ye constable ca^e before the town of Kouke / which was a haven town
/ he wan it byforce of assaut and the englisshmen slain that were wihin it /
except the captain / named sir John^ Langay who was taken to mercy. This
town ye frenchmen new repaired / than they drew all to the town of Breast /
where the lord Neuyll and sir Robert Canoll were who had with them a. C. men of
arms / and as many archers. And so ye lords of France and of Bretayn beseged
the town with a.vi. M. fyghting men / and as soon as they had laid thesiege /
they sent ser Olyuer Chsson in the name of the duke of Aniou with a certain
no^bre with him / to go and lay sege to the Roche sur yon / which thenglysshmen
kept / and so the lord Clysson besieged the town round about. and reared up
diverse engyns / which was brought him fro Angiers and Poiters / and with the
bretons there ca^e thither diverse noble men and ge^tylmen of Aniou and of
Poictou / and so assauted it / and said. how they would not deperte thens till
they had it. And ye same time ye duke of Aniou / often times refresshed the^
that lay at thesege / with vitayle and other things. And still the constable
lay at sege before Breast / and with him the duke of Burbon / the earls of
Alenson / of Piergourt / of Dolphyn / of Auuergne / and byuers other lords of
France: but they wanther but a little / for Breast was one of the stro^gest
castles in the world / and because that sir Robert Canoll was captain / and
was there within / the lords of France determined to send and ley siege to
his castle of Duriuall. and so thither went diverse lords of Bretayne and
Tourayn with four hundred fighting men.

How the frenchmen lay at ^iege at four sundry places all a tones / and how
they of Roche suryon / yielded them self and became french: And how the
englysshmen came before Breast. Cap. CCC.ix.
THus the lords of France held a / tones four seges. One before Bercerell /
another before Breast / the (...). before Roch sur yon / and the.iiii. before
Duriuall: and to each of these was made many a great assaut. They within Roche
sur you / who were farthest of fro any copany or comfort / made a composycion
with their enemies / that without they were socoured within the space of a month
/ they should deperte and put ye castle under the obeisance of the french
king. At which day / the lord Clysson and the other knights of his company
ca^e thither / and when no rescue ca^e to reyse their siege / the castle yielded
up / and thenglysshmen deperted / under the save conduct of the lord of Pons /
and so went to Burdeur. Than the lord Clysson and the other went from thens to
the siege before Duryuall / and brought with the^ great engines. And also to the
samesege ca^e the constable of France / the duke of Burbon / therles of
Alenson and of Perch / and a great no^bre of the barony and cheualry of
France. For they thought they did but lose their time with lyeng before Breast:
howbeit they left still there a two. M. and they fortifyed the^ self in a place
to keep the ways / y^ non should enter nor issue out of Breast / to refressh
the fortress. And when sir Broes and they within Duryuall / saw the^ self so
sore oppressed / they douted greatly the taking of their fortress. Than they
devised a treaty to have respyte for two months / so that without they were
rescued by the duke of Bretayne / or by some other / able to keep the field /
and to reyse the siege within the said space / (...) to yield up the forteresse
to the duke of Aniou or to the constable / and if men of arms came fro ye duke
of Bretayne to coost the frenchmen / than they within to sit still in rest
and peace. This treaty was put for the and showed to the duke of Aniowe and he
agreed / so that they of Duryuall / during the said term / should not take
into their fortress no more aid nor help. Than sir Broes delivered certain
ge^tylmen knights and squiers for hostages in y^ behalf / and so after this
treaty and co^posycion / the constable rode to Nau^tes / and they of the city
shyt fast their gates against him / because he came with such a great army /
and so they sent to him to know his ente^cyon. The constable / answered and
said: how he was sent thither by ye french king their lord / to take possession
in his name of the duchy of Bretayn / and that sir Johan of Mountforte / who
calls him self duke / has forfayted it. Tha^ the burgesses of Nau^tes
demanded to take counsel / and than to answer. and wha^ they had long
counsayled / they came forth and said. Sir: it is great marvel to us / that
ye thus take the heritage of our lord the duke for the french king / who
commanded us to receive him as our duke and lord / and to him we have swerne
fealty and homage / and he has sworn to us to govern us as his subgettes.
Thus have we taken him / and we know no cause in him of fraud or suspection.
Ifye coe in to this town by the virtue of such procuraryon as ye have / we
agree that ye shall enter by condicyon. So that if it hap that the duke of
Bretayne our lord return in to this country and will become french: than
all prelates barons / gentylmen / and the good towns of Breten / all we to
knowledge him as our lord and tha^ we to be quyte without damage / now or any
other time. and also ye to receive no re^tes nor revenues of Bretayn / but let
them still remain in our hands: until such time / that we have other
tydinges: y^ which shall be more agreeable to us than this. The constable swear
to the^ to fulfill all this / as procurer of the french king in that case. Thus
the constable entered in to the rytie of Nauntes / which was chief city of
Bretayne / and all his company.

When sir Robert Canoll / who was sovereign of Breest / understood how sir
Hugh Broes his cosyn / had made composycion of the fortress of Duryuall with
the frenchmen: and saw well how he could not depart fro thens there as he
was / to go and comfort his castle of Duriuall / without so be he would make a
co^posycion in like case. Than he began to treat with the frenchmen / that were
there before Breast / and they answered: that without the constable they could
do nothing. Than two knights and two squyers of England had save co^ducte /
and went to the constable beside Nau^tes / where as he lay by the river of Loyre
/ with great copany of France and of Bretayne. And so this treaty took such
effect / yt they of Breast had respite for.xl. days: so that wtin that space
they should beso conforted with men of warte / able to fight with the constable
/ or else to yield up the forteresse. And in the mean season they of Breast / to
abide still in the same case as they were tha^ in / without reuitaylyng or
enforsyng any thing of their fortress. Than the messangers returned again to
sir Robert Canoll / and he sent sufficyent men both knights and squiers to
the constable for hostage. Than the constable put them in prison / and all they
yt had been at the siege before Breast departed: the constable gave them license.
And the french king sent for them to fortifye the cities / towns / castles /
and fortresses in Picardy / for the duke of Lancastre was aryued at Calais with
a great army.

When the earl of Salisbury / who was on the sea: and had all yt season kept
the fronters of Bretayne and Normandy / and also the king of England had newly
reconforted them with a thousand men of arms and two thousand archers. When
he understood the co^posycion of them of Breast / he said: that with gods
grace he would fight with the frenchemen / and he sailed so long that he
arrived at Breast. Than he took land and all his company before Breast / and
every night went again to his ships / and every day raynged in batell to
fight with his enemies if they brewe thider. The constable / who had given
license to the most part of his company / and held still two sieges: one
before Bercerell / and the other before Duryuall: and thought full little that
the earl of Salisbury would have come thither / so strongly as he did. Than he
departed fro the marches of Nauntes / when the day of the delyueraunce of Breast
did aproche: how be it wha^ the day came he went not thither / for than he had
knowledge how the englisshmen were there with such a strength / able to
fight with him. therefore he thought to warke by great and sad advise / and so
he did (for he tarried still there he was / and removed not) and there tarried
a.vii. days or more. and when therle of Salisbury being before Breest / had
taken a place of ground for his advantage / And saw that the constable of
France nor the bretons came not forward / he sent thither an haraude / who
when he came before the constable / said. Sir / the earl of Salisbury and the
lords of England send you word by me / who am an haraude of arms / how that
before this time / ye have laid siege before the castle and town of Breast.
sir / my lords and masters understand / how certain composycions and
treatyes were made / bitwene you and them of the town / that if they were not
comforted by the day lymytted / the which is not now long unto that they
should yield up the town and castle to you. Wherefore sir. may it please you
to know / they be come before Breest to keep their day / and to defend their
fortress. Therefore sir / they desire you to draw forward / and ye shall be
fought withal without dout / and if ye will not / than they desire you to
send them again such hostages as ye have for that intent. Than the constable
said / haraulde: ye bring us good tidings / wherefore ye be welco^e. ye shall
say to your masters: how we have greatter desire to sight with the^ / than
they have to fight with us / how beit they be not in that place / where the
treaty was made and agreed unto. Therefore say to them / that let them draw
to that part and place / and without fail they shall be sought withal. Than
the haraud returned to Breast and did his message / and than they sent him
again to the constable with another message and when he came there / he said.
Sir / I am come again to you fro my lords and masters / to whom I have
showed every thing / as ye commanded me to say / when I was with you last.
How be it sir: now they say how they be men of the sea lately come thens /
and have brought no horse with them. and sir / they say they have not ben
acustomed to go far a foot / wherefore they send you word that if ye will
send the^ your horses / they will come to what place ye will apoynt them to
fight with you / and to keep their day. Fair fared quod the constable: we are
not in mind / to do to our enemies somoche auantage / as to send to the^ our
horses: it shulbe be reputed for a great outrage and if we were so minded to do
/ we would deman^de good hostages and sufficient / to answer us of our horses
again. Sir quod the haraud / I have no such commandment to answer to that
matter / How beit sir / they say that if ye will not agree to this point: ye
have no lawful cause to retain still the hostages that yehaue. Therefore sir:
and yesend the^ / ye do as ye should do. The constable said he was not abuysed
so to do. So returned the haraude to the earl of Salisbury and his company /
before Breast. And when they understood that they should not be fought wall /
nor their hostages delyucred / they were sore dyspleased. How be it they
tarried there still without remouyng / till the day was expyred / and parceyued
well how the constable ca^e not to fight with them. Than they entered in to
Breast and new reuitayled the town / and refresshed greatly the fortress. And
on the other perte when the constable saw that the englysshmen ca^e not
forward to fight with him / than he deperted and took the hostages with him.
and said: how they were his prisoners (for he said) that the englysshmen and
they of Breast / had not kept truly their apoyntment / in rescuyng of Breast /
because the earl of Salisbury had newly refresshed and vitayled y^ fortress.
And so than the earl of Salisbury deperted fro Breast and entered again in to
his ships / to keep y^ marches and fronters / as he was committed to do. And
also sir Robert Canoll when he departed fro Breast he went straight to his own
forteresse of Duryuall. And as soon as he was come in to the castle (it was
showed to y^ duke of Aniou) and to the constable / being as than in Nauntes.
They supposed than / as it fortuned after / for sir Robert Canoll brake all the
treaty and apoyntment before made / and renounsed them all. And send word to
the duke of Aniou and to the constable / that he would keep no such apoyntmeut
/ as his men had made in his absence without his leave: saying they had no
such authorite so to do. When the duke herd that / he came personally to the
sege of Duriuall.

How diverse englysshmen were slain and disconfited by the lord of Soubyse
before Ribamont / and how the garysons of Soissons disco^fyted the
englysshmen. Cap. C C C.x.
AT Calais there aryued the duke of Lancastre and y^ duke of Bretayne / and mo
than three thousand men of arms / and.x. thousand archers englysshmen /
which voyage had been ordayning and imagenynge three year before. There was with
them: the earls of Warwyke / of Stafforde and of Suffolk. The lord Edward
Spcusar / one of the greattest barons of England / and constable for that
time of all the host: and the lords of Wylloughby / of Pole / of Basset / of
Hubelles / of Holenton / sir Henry Percy / Loys Clyfforde / Wylliam Beaucha^pe
/ Chanoyne Robersart / Water Hewet / Hughe Carleton / Stephyn Gosenton /
Rychard Po^t chardon / and diverse other knights and squyers of England / who^e
I can not all name. The french king / who knew right well the passage of these
englysshmen: provided sufficye^tly for the sure keeping of his towns / cities /
forteresses / and castelles: in Picardy / in Artoys / and in Uermandoyse. And
had set in them men of warrees as bretons / burgonyons / pycardes / normayus
/ and diverse other soudyers of the empire. Thus these englysshmen departed fro
Calais / after they had aparelled their caryages / whereof they had great
plenty: so they rode forth in three batayls as well ordered as could be devised
First ye battle with the marshals / whereof the earls of Warwyke and of Suffolk
were chief: and than the two dukes / of Lancastre and of Bretayne and with them
a noble company. And the third battle led the constable the lord Spe^ser /
and all three batayls marched forward / keeping themself close together: always
in harness ready to fight / if they found with whom. And every night they lay
togider and made good wache / and went never past three leages a day. None went
before the marshals baners without commandment / and so they passed by
Motrell: whereof the lord of Handboure was captain but they made there none
assaut / and so past by saint Omer / and after by Turwyn. The currours brent
the land of therle of saint Poule / and than went nere to Arras. And the two
dukes lodged in the abbey of mount saint Eloy / and there tarried two days. Than
they departed and costed Arras / but they assailed it not: for they knew well
they should but lose their labor. and so they went to Bray on the river of
Some / and there the two marshals made a great assaut before the gate. Within
there were in garyson good knights and squyers of Picardy / of whom the vicont
of Mealx was captain / and sir Rafe of Menac. The chanon of Robersart that
day struck down with his glayue three to the earth before the gate / where there
was a sore scrimysshe. Howbeit the frenchmen kept so well their forteresse that
they lost nothing / and so the englysshmen passed by / coostynge the river of
Some / thynking to pass over at Ham in Uermandois / and at saint Quintynes.

THus went forth thenglysshe host / where of the duke of Lancastre was chief
governor / by the ordinance of the king of England his father. Than the lord
Bousyers of Heynalte ca^e in to France and he passed by the bridge of Ham: and
there they of the town desired him effectuously yt he would be retained with
the^ / and to help to aid the^ against thenglysh men / and he agreed to them
/ and there he tarried a two days / till the englysshmen were all past / who
took their way above to enter into verma^ doys / and to pass the river of Some
/ at a strayter passage. And when the lord of Bousyers knew that
thenglysshmen were nygh all past over / and how yt they drue toward saint
Quintynes and Rybamont / where the lord of Clyn (whose daughter he had in
marriage) was: the which lord had there fair land and heritage. and also he
had him self there fair land by ye right of his wife / and knew well how the
castle of Rybamont was unpurveyed of men of war. Than he took leave of them
of Ham / and they greatly thanked him of his service that he had done to them:
so he departed with such nombre as he had / which was no great no^bre. and he
rode so long that he came to saint Quintynes in great parell / for the country
was full of englysshmen. He came in such danger / that he was no sooner entered
/ but that the englisshe currours chased him in at the gate. And the lord of
Bousyers found in the town sir Wylliam of Bourges / who was captain there /
under the french king who received him ioyously desyring him to a bide there /
to help to defend the town. The lord of Bousiers excused him self / and
said: how he had enterprised to enter in to the town of Rybamont / to keep
the town and fortress there / because it was with out captain / wherefore he
desired so sore the said sir Wylliam / that he had of him out of saint
Quintynes.xii. cross bows / and so departed / and he went not far past / but
that he spyed a company of englysshmen / but he took another low way beside
the^ for he knew well the country. So the same day he rode in great parell
toward Rybamount / and as he rode he encou^tred a knight of Burgoyne / called
sir Johan of Bulle / who was going toward saint Quitynes / but when he had
ones spoken with the lord of Bousyers / he returned with him to Rybamount /
and so they were about a.xl. spears and.xx. crosbowes. And thus they aproched
Rybamont / and sent before one of their currours to inform them of the town
of their coming to help to aid / and to defend their town. And in ye mean
season they saw where there was coming a company of englisshmen / to the nombre
of fourscore. Than the frenchemen said / behold: yo^der be our enemies / who
are coming fro their pyllage / let us go before them. Than they dasshed their
spurs to their horse sides and galopped forth as fast as they might / cryeng
our lady of Rybamont. And so came in among the englysshmen / and disconfyted
and slew the most part of them / for he was happy that might escape. And
when the frenchemen / had thus overthrown the englysshmen / they went to
Rybamont / where they found the lord of Chyne / who was come thither but a
little before with.xl. spears / and xxx. crosbowes. And as they were before
the castle / and their company in their lodgings unarmed / they herd the
watchman of the castle cryeng to harness sirs / me^ of arms aprocheth your
town. Than they drew together / and demanded of the watchman what no^bre by
like lyhode they were of / he answered and said: how they were about the
nombre of fourscore men of arms. than the lord Bousyers / said. sirs it
behooves us to go out and fight with them / for it should be a great blame to us
/ to sulfre the^ goby so nere to our fortress. The lord of Chin said / a fair
son: ye say truth / cause our horses to come out and display my baner.
Than sir John^ of Bulle said / lords ye shall not go without me. but my
counsayleis y^ we go wise lie / for parauenture they be but currours / which
the marshalles of England / or the constable has sent hyder / to cause vsto
go out of our fortress: our issuyng parauentur may turn to folly. The lord
Bousiers said / if ye will be leave me / we shall go out and fight with them /
(...) that brefely: hap what may befall / I will go out and fight with them.
And so did on his helm and lepte on his horse and so issued out / and with
him a sixscore / and the englysshmen were about fourscore and they were of ser
Hugh Caurelles company / but he was not there himself / he was still with the
duke of Lancastre. Howbeit there were six knights and many squiers / and they
were come thither to revenge their company / that were overthrown before. As
soon as the frenchemen were out of the gate / they found incontinent the
englisshmen / who couched their spears and ran in among the frenchmen / and
the frenchmen opyned and let them pass through them / and so they did: whereby
there rose such a dust / that one could not se nor know another. Than the
frenchmen closed them self again toguyder / and cried our lady of Rybamont:
there was many a man overthrown on both pertes. The lord of Chyn had a
plummet of leed in his hand / wherewith he brake bassenetes / such as he
attained unto for he was a bygge and a goodly knight / and well formed of all
his members. At last he had such a stroke on the helm / that he had nere
fallen / and a squire had not kept him up / which stroke grieved him after as
long as he lived. There were diverse englysshmen had great marueyle / in y^ they
saw his penonsemblable to the arms / without difference of the lord Coucy /
and said. How is it: that y^ lord Coucy has sent men hyder to be against us
/ and he ought to be our friend. So there was a hard batell: how be it finally
the englysshmen were taken and slain / but few y^ escaped. The lord Bousiers
had prisoners / two brethren of Pennenort / a knight and a squire. And sir
Johan of Bulle had other two prisoners / than they went to Rybamont foreby the
english host / without any scrimysshe. And also they forbear to brenne in
the land of the lord Coucy / or to do any damage there / who was as than in
Lombardy / and medlyd nothing with the war of France. Than the englysshmen
went and loged in the valeys under Laon / and there about Brueres and Crescy.
And they did much damage in the country of Lonnoys / howbeit before that time
/ the french king had caused all the goods in the plain country to be had
into the forteresses / towns / and castelles / which were so well provided
for / that the englissmen could have none advantage / to aproche to assail any
of them. And also the englysshemen were not in mind to enploy their season
there about / for they had rather that y^ french king had sent down power of
men to have fought with them / but the french king always commanded in no
wise to give them battle / but would that they should be ever pursued / and
kept short. And every night the frenchmen lay in fortresses / and in the day
pursued thenglysshe host / who went ever close toguyder.

SO it happed that beyond Soissous in a morning / a sixscore of thenglysshe
speres ran over the country / and came within the danger of a busshment of
burgonyons and frenchmen whereof sir John^ of Uyen / John^ Bulle / Wyllyam
Bordes / Hugh Porcien / John^ of Coucy the vycont of Mealx / the lords of
Rauenall and of Bone were capitens / and diverse other. They were a three. C.
spears always costyng to get aua^tage of the^glishmen. The same night they
had lain in the field and made their bushment in a little wode in Soissons /
and thenglysshmen ca^e in the morning to seek for pyllage / and their host was
lodged behind them: and when the englysshmen were past / the frenchmen ca^e
out of their busshment and displayed their baners and penons. And when
the^glisshmen saw yt great company so nere them / they rested and took advise
/ and sent to their host behind the^ / which was a long leage fro them. And
sir Gaultyer / who was a great captain was not far thens / and when he herd
thereof / he lept upon his horse in great haste / his spear in his fyste /
without ^a^^enet or vyser: and so rode thyderwarde without advise or counsel
/ his men solowed after as fast as they might / and so i^ that fray he was
stryken through the neck / and so he fell down deed. The^glysshmen fought
valiantly / but finally they were slain and taken few escaped. There were
taken of english knights prisoners: sir John^ Radwyn / Thomas Faulque /
Hughe Bromewell / Thomas Spenser / Thomas Ebreton / Nycholl Gascoyne / John^
Candley / Philyppe of Cambrey / Hughe Harp / Done Lyonet Dautryne / and
squyers Johan Galarde / Thomas Brudlay / Henry Mamefort / Guy Chuet / Wyllm^
Dautry / John^ Menet / Antyque^ / Wylliam Gausull John^ of Fo^bret / Tomelyn
Solerant / Wyllm^ Quiteuyn Robert Bouchell / To. daudley / Rafe Stanby / and
Thomas Arthus. Tydinges came in to the english host / how their company
were fighting: than the marshals made have to remove the host to that part /
but he could not so soon auaunce / but that the matter was past and done / and
the burgonyons and frenchmen withdrawn withal their prisoners / so y^ the
englysshmen wist not where to seek them. Thus it fell of the encountre (as I
was informed) which was nere to Douchy beside Soissons: the.xx. day of
February / the year of our lord a thousand three. C. threscore and.xiii.

After these two iourneys of Rabymont and Douchy / there fell none adventure to
the duke of Lancastre in the realm of France / that any mencyon ought to be
made of. The englysshemen passed many a strayte passage / but always they rode
wisely and close together. The french kings counsel / said to the king /
Sir: let them go on / for finally they can not attain to your heritage. They
shall weary them self and all for naught / for often times when a storm or
tempest ryseth in a country / at last it wastes away by it self. In likewise
so shall it be seen by these englysshmen.

How the hostages that were laid by them of Duriuall were beheeded and how sir
Robert Canolle beheeded again / all such prisoners as he had: And also of the
duke of Lancastres journey. Cap. CCC.xi.
LE have well herd here before / how sir Robert Canoll was come to his
castle of Duryuall / ye which he held as his own heritage / and brake the
treaty yt was made between his men and the duke of Aniou wherefore the duke came
thither to the siege / for the duke claymed it as his own enherita. and he had
with him a great company of lords and knights: of Bretayne / of Poictou / and
of the low marches. The french king would his constable / ye lord Clysson /
and other yt were there should return in to Fa^rce / to aid his brother the
duke of Burgoyne to pursue the english men. Hesent often to them of the
castle of Duryuall to obey to him / and to let him have possessyon of the
castle. And when the day was past / that the castle should have been delyuerd
/ yet they lay still at siege and had great marueyle what they within
thought. They knew well that sir Robert Canoll was entered into the castle /
and had new refresshed it. Than these dukes and lords sent a haraude to sir
Robert Canoll and to sir Hughe Broes / who had made before the treaty with
them. And when the haraulde was come in to the forteresse / he said. Sirs / my
lords has sent me hyder to you / to know the cause why ye do not acquyte
your hostages / and deliver this castle / as the covenant was: and as ye sir
Hugh have sworn. Than sir Robert Canoll / said. Haraude / say unto your
masters: how that my men could make no composycion / without me or mine
agreement. Return to them and show them so. The haraude returned / and
recounted to his lords all that sir Robert Canoll had said. and so they sent
him again with a new message / and when he was there / he said. Sirs / my
lords yet sends you word by me / that the composycion was / y^ they should
receive in to their forteresse no person / till the day that was prefixed. And
sith that time and before their day they have received you / sir Robert Canoll
into their fortress / which they ought not to have done. Therefore sir / know
for trouther y^ without ye yield up the castle / your hostages shall be
beheeded. Sir Robert answered / by god haralde / for all the manysshing of your
masters I will not so lose my castle. And if so be y^ the duke cause my men
to dye / I shall serve him in like case / for I have here within / both
knights and squyers prisoners: and though I might have for them / a hundred.
M. frankes / I will save never a one of the^. And when the haraude was departed
/ and had made his report. The duke of Aniou called forth the hangman and
made to be brought forth the hostages two knights and asquier / and caused
their heedes to be stryken of / nere to the castle / so that they within might
se it / and know it. Incontinent sir Robert Canoll made a board to be put out
of a wyndowe of the hall / and brought thither four prisoners that he had / three
knights and a squire / for whom he might have had great rau^some. But he
made their four heedes to be stryken of / and did cast them down into the
dykes / the bodies one way / and their heedes a another way. Than they brake up
their siege / and all manner of men went into France / and namely the duke of
Aniou went to Paris to ye king his brother. The constable / the lord Clysson /
and other rode toward the cite of Troyes / for the englysshmen were in that
marches / and were passed ye river of Marne / and took their way toward
Anxere. The same time pope Gregory the.xi. had sent into France in legacyon /
the archbysshoppe of Rohan / and the bishop of Carpentras / for to treat for
a peace if it might be / between the french king and the king of England.
These prelates had much labor to ride in and out / between the french king
and his brethren / and the duke of Lancastre: but always the englysshmen rode
forth / thorough the countries of Forestes / of Auuergne of Limosyn / and the
river of Loyre / to Dordone / and to Loathe. Thenglysshmen were not all at their
ease in that journey: nor in likewise were not the frenchmen / that followed and
costed them. In the which pursuit there dyed three knights of Heynault: sir
Fateres of Berlaumount / Bridoll of Montague / and the begue of Uerlan: and
also of the english part there dyed some. Solonge the dukes of Lancastre and
of Bretayne rode forward / that they came to Bergerath a four leages fro
Burdeux. And always the frenchmen had pursued them: the duke of Aniou and the
constable rode above / toward Rouuergue / Rods / and Toulouse / and were
come to Pyergourt. And there the two for said prelates rested / and rode ever
prechynge between the parties: and laid many reasons to bring them to acorde /
but both parties were so hard that they would not condiscende to no peace /
without a great advantage. and so about christmas / the duke of Lancastre came
to Burdeux / and there both dukes lay all that winter and the lent following /
and some of his company departed. When the journey was paste: there returned
in to England the lord Basset and his company / wherewith the king was not
content: but reproved him / because he returned and not the duke his son.

THan anon after the feast of Easter / the year of our lord god. a thousand
three hundred and.xiii. The duke of Aniou being at Pyergourt assembled a great
army / and with him was the constable of France / and ye most part of all the
barons and knights of Bretayne / of Poictou / of Aniou / and of Tourayne Also
there was of Gascoyne / sir Johan of Armynake / the lords: Dalbret / and
Pyergourt The earls of Comynges / and of Narbone / the vycountes / of Carmayne
/ Uyllemure / and of Thalare / the earl Dolphyn of Auuergne / and the most
part of the lords of Auuergne and of Limosyn / the vycount of Myndone / the
lords de la Barde / and Pyergourt / and sir Robert de Charde. They were a.xv.
thousand men a foot: and also they had a great nombre of geneways and cross
bows / and took their way toward high Gascoyne / and came before saint
Syluere: whereof an abbot was lord. How beit that there was a strong town
yet the abbot douted y^ he should lose it by force Therefore he fell in a treaty
with ye duke of Aniou / for he thought another him self nor his land should
abide the war / nor be in the dukes indygnacion. Saying to him / how his town
nor fortress was but a small thing / as in regard of the towns and castles
in high Gascone / whyder he supposed ye duke was going. Therefore he desired him
to leave him in rest and peace / by certain composycion / y^ he nor none of his
men should make any war / so that non were made to him: and also to do in
like manner / as herytours and lords of Gascoyne did. The duke accorded to him
/ and had hostages in that behalf: and sent them to be kept in Pyergourt.
Than all the hoole host / whereof the duke of Anio we was chief: drew
toward Mount Marsen / and to the town of Lourde in high Gascone / whereof
sir Arnold de Uyre was captain. Than the frenchmen laid siege thereto / and
demanded if they would yield the^ up to the duke of Aniowe. They of the town
were soon agreed thereto / but the knight that kept it / said: how the earl
of Foiz delivered him the place / wherefore he said: he would deliver it to
none other person. When the constable herd that / he caused every man to
assaute the Castle / in such wise / that it was won by force / and the
captain slain / and diverse other: bo the men and women / and the town
ouerron and robbed and so left it / and at their depertyng they left men
therein. Than the frenchmen entered in to the land of the castle Bone / and
ouerran it. And tha^ passed by the land of the castle Neufe which they
assailed / and so went for the toward Byenre / and came to the enter of the
land of the lord of Lescute and rode so forward / that they came to a good
town and to a good castle called Sault / which held of ye county of Foiz and
all his lands / and arere fees in Gascoyne. The prince of Wales before he went
in to Spain / was in mind to have made war against ye county of Foiz /
because they would not hold of him. And also ye duke of Aniou / who had
conquered the most part of all Acquitayne showed himself as lord there / and
would have had it in possessyon. So he laid siege before the town of Sault in
Gascoyne / which was not easy to win / and within there was capitayn sir
Wyllim^ of Pans. And when the earl of Foiz / saw how the frenchmen conquered
his lands and arerefees / the which by reason he should other hold of the
french king / orels of the king of England. He sent for the vicount of the
castle Bone / and for the lords of Mersalte / of castle Neufz / of Lescute /
and for the abbot of saint Syluere. And when they were come to him / than he
sent for a save conduct to go and speak with the duke of Aniowe / who lay still
at siege before Saulte: the duke accorded thereto. Than he and the other lords
went to the host to the duke / and there agreed that they and their lands
should abide in a respite of peace till ye mids of August / at the which time
there should apere before ye town of Mo^sac by y^ day / certain nombre of men
of war other of the french kings part / or of the king of Englandes part.
And that party that could keep the field / of him they would hold their lands
in peace for ever. Which covenant to parforme / therle of Foiz and the other
lords laid good hostages. Than the duke of Aniou went to Pyergourte with all
his hole army / and gave license to no man to depart.

IN that season there was an exchange made of certain lands for prisoners in
spaygne / which lands the king of Spain had given to the constable of
France / and the lord of Manny / for such service as they had done in
Spain. The constable gave the land of saryen castle in exchange for the earl
of Pe^broke who was taken prisoner before Rochell / and ser Olyuer of Ma^ny
gave his land of Greece / for the lords sir Richard Dangle / and Wyllim^ his
nephue / and for Oaths of Gra^tsone John^ de Gremeres / and Tanyboton. The same
season there began a treaty / between the duke of Aniou and the duke of
Lancastre at Pyergort by assurances toward the duke of Aniou / for the duke of
Lancastre held himself as king and regent of the^glysshe marches. And so
there was a respyte of war agreed / between them and all their ayders / to
endure till the last day of August. So yt these two dukes should be at the
beginning of Septe^bre in the marches of Picardy: the duke of Aniou at saint
Omers / and the duke of Lancaster at Calys. After this truce thus taken / the
duke of Lancaster and the duke of Breten / therles of Warwyke / of Suffolk /
and Stafforde: the lords Spenser / Will loughby / Chanoyne / Robersart / Henry
Percy / and the lord of Mauue / and all other lords and knights / the.viii.
day of July deperted fro Burdeux / and returned into England. And when the
capitayns of Bercerell / sir Johan of Pert and Johan of Cornwall had kept the
for tresse the space of a year against the frenchmen / that lay there at siege
/ and saw no socoure nor aid coming to them ward / and that their vytayls
began sore to mynisshe. Than they took advise together / and de^myned to make
some composycion: than they fell in treaty with the lords of Hambuye / of
Stonuyll / Blaynuyll / and Franuyll. The lords of Normandy that lay there at
siege were right weary / and would gladly have fallen into some treaty / how
beit first they would know the kings mind / who acorded right well thereto.
So that if the duke of Bretayne were not personally bitwene that time / and the
feast of Allsayntes next coming after / before ye town of Bercerell / in such
wise able to reyse the siege / else they within to yield them up. For which
composycion there were de lyuered hostages. therle of Penbroke was put to
ransom of six thousand frankes / and lomberdes in Bruges beca^e dettours
therefore / and promised payment thereof / as soon as he were hole and in good
point. So the earl rode under the conduct of the constable through France / so
that the fever and sickness took him by ye way / and so in a horse lytter he
was brought to the cite of Arras / and there his sickness took him so sore
that he lay in his bed / and final / lie dyed there: and so the constable
lost his money. And therle of Penbroke left behind him a son of the age of
two year / and sir Richard Da^gle made his finau^ce / as I shall show you. ye
have herd here before / how y^ lord of Roy was prisoner in England who had
no children but a daughter / who was his heir. The friends of the said lord
of Roy / fell in treaty with sir Olyuer of Manny / a knight of Bretayne / and
nephue to sir Bertram of Clesquy: for the delyueraunce of the lord of Roy / by
this means / by exchange for one of his prisoners. and he to have to his wife
the lord of Roys daughter / who was of great lynage. Tha^ sir Olyuer of Ma^ny,
sent to y^ king of England / to know what knight he would gladlyest have
delyueced for the lord of Roye / the king enclynod to have sir Rychard
Danglees and so they were delivered quyte each for other. And the lord Ma^ny
wedded the daughter of the lord of Royes / and the said lord of Roye / after
married the daughter of the lord of Will and of Floren (...) in Heynalt. And
y^ other knights: as sir Tanyboton / sir Oaths of Grantson and Johan of
Gruners were put to their fynau^ce / and by the means of sir Olyuer of Manny /
they passed with easy and courtesse rau^some.

How diverse towns yielded up to the french king in Gascon / and how sir Hugh
of Chastellon returned fro prison / and how the castle of Bercerell in
Normandy yielded them up french. Cap. CCC.xii.
When the mids of August began to aproche / and that the journey should hold
before Monsac. the duke of Anioue came thither with a great no^bre of men of
war and so came and lay before Monsac six days / and thither came no body to
apere of the other part / for the englysshmen thought that by reason of the
treaty that was made / bitwene the duke of Aniou and the duke of Lancastre /
that journey should have ouerpast / but the duke of Aniou and his counsel was
not of that mind. Than the duke sent to the earl of Foiz / the vicount of
Chatell Boine / to the lords of Marsen / of Chatell Neufe / of Lescute / and
to the abbot of saint Syluere / that they should hold their covenant / or else
the duke said he would sle all the hostages that he had for that intent / and
would enter in to their lands with such puyssaunce / that he would compel
them to cry for mercy. Than these lords put them self and their lands /
under the obeisance of the french king / and they of Monsac opened their town
which was a fair garrison / and went and presented the keys to the duke of
Aniou / and to him did fealty and homage. And so the duke and his company
entered / and there tarried.xviii. days. and in the mean season ^oke counsel
to what part they should draw / as soon as the mids of August should be
past / and that the truce should be expyred. and when the day was past / the
duke of Aniou went before the Ryoll / and when he had layen there at siege three
days / than they of ye Ryoll put themself under the obeysaunce of the french
king. than they went before Langon which also yielded up / and after saint
Marquayre / Condose Basylle / the tower of Prudence / Mauleon / and the tower
of Drowe / and to the nombre of a.xl. towns and castles turned them self
french / in the same viage. the last that turned french was Dauberoth / and
in every place ye duke laid new garrisons. And when he had ordained every thing
according to his pleasure / than he returned in to France / and the constable
in likewise for the king sent for them / and so they gave license to the most
part of their company to depart / and the lords of Clisson / of Beaumauoyre
/ of Dauangourt / of Ray / and of Ryon / the vycontes of Rohan / and of Lauall
and other / came to ye siege before Bercerell to hold their journey at ye day
prefixed / for it was said how the duke of Bretayn / sir Robert Canoll / and
the lord Spenser / were coming thither to reyse the siege.

yE have herd here before / how sir Hugh of Chastellon master of the crosbowes
was taken before Abbeuile by sir Nycholas of Louuayn / and carried into England.
he could come to no rau^some / because they axed so much for his fynau^ce /
how be it a merchant of Flaunders auaunsed himself / and did somoche / that
subtelly he gate him out of England: the manner how / is over long to be told
/ therefore I pass it breuely. But when he was come a gain in to France / the
king restored again to him his office / as master of ye crosbowes / and sent
him to Abuyle to keep the fronters there / and with him a two hundred spea^es
and all the country there about obeyed to him / as sir Johan of Bertheouyllers
capitayn of Boloyn sir Henry of the Isles captain of Dept. and all such as
were in the garysons of Tyrwinnyn / saint Dmers / Lykos / Fiennes / and Mount
roye. So it was that the lord of Comynges captain of Arde / and sir Johan of
Ubrues assembled at Arde an.viii. hundred spears / and erly in a morning they
departed and ran toward Boloyne / to se if they could find any adventure.
The same day the capiten of Boloyne with a.lx. spears issued out and rode
toward Calais / in likewise to find some adventure. And at his returning he
encountered with the sorde of Compynges and his company who had ryden to ward
Boloyne. The captain of Boloyne saved him self with much pain / and lost
a.xiiii. of his spears / and after this chase / the lord of Comynges
returned again. The same morning the master of the crosbowes had made his
musters / and had with him a great nombre of them of Arthoys / and Uerma^doyes
and there about / so that he was to yt nombre of three hundred spears. The
same time the earl of saint Powle was newly come out of Picardy fro his land
of Lorayne / and was the same day riding to our lady of Boloyne in pilgrymage
/ and herd by the way how the master of the crosbowes would in likewise tide
thither / and so met him and rode forth together and came by Arde / and tarried
there a certain space in ye field / and knew nothing that the^glysshmen were a
broad in the field / nor the englisshmen knew nothing of the^ / and when the
frenchmen had been a certain time before Arde and saw no man issue out / they
returned to the abbey of Lyques. And as soon as they were departed fro Arde an
englisshman issued out privily / and rode so long by privy ways (for he knew
the country) that at last he met with the lord Comynges returnyng to ward
Arde / and than he told him / how the frenchemen had been before Arde / and
were departed: and by that time that the frenchmen were past Tornehen / they
were certifyed how thenglisshmen were tydynge abroad / with the captain of
Arde. Than they turned and costed on the one side / and laid a busshment of
three hundred spears in a little wood beside Liques / whereof sir Hugh Chastellon
was chief capitayn / and they ordained yt the young earl of saint Poule / and a
great nombre with him of knights and squiers should tide forth. and not far
thens along by a great hedge / the lord of Comynges and sir Ubreues and their
company / were restyng the^ / and lighted a foot and were in good order. Than
sir Johan Harlston went forth with a.xx. spears to break the french
busshement and was determined to fly and to suffer the frenchmen to chase him /
and so he rode forth in to the feldes. Than the young earl of saint Poule /
who was a broad on the other perte with a hundred spears / said to his
company: let us auance forth yo^der be our enemies. than they basshed their
spurs to their horses / and ran to them as fast as they might. and than sir
John^ Harlston turned and caused them to chase him along by the hedge / where
the^glysshmen were ready rainged / and the archers before the^. As Soon as the
frenchmen came there / the englysshmen received them with spears and axes /
and the archers began to shote / and ouerthrewe men of arms and beat down
horses. There was done many a feate of arms / but finally the frenchemen were
enclosed and overthrown. the young earl of saint Poule was takenne prisoner /
by a squire of the duchy of Guerles / and there was taken the lord of Pouns
and of Clarry / sir William of Melle / Charles of Chastellon / Lionet Daraynes
/ Gauues of Uaisnell / Henry of the Isles and Johan his brother / the
Chastellayn of Beauuoyse / and diverse other knights and squiers. And in
contynent after this disconfyture / The lord of Chastellon with his banner and
three hundred spears came to the same hedges end / but when he saw the
disconfyture of his company / he drew his company toguyder and departed
without any strokes given. Than thenglysshmen and haynowes / led their
prisoners in to the town of Arde. The same night / the lord of Comynges
bought therle of saint Poule / of the squier that had taken him prisoner. and
anon after he went with him into England and presented him to the king / who
thanked him therefore / and had thereby great profit. The same season there
was come in to France / the duke of Aniou / and the constable of France / and
also the arche bishop of Rohan / and the bisshoppe of Crapent as / who had been long with the king at Paris. so they passed forth to go to saint Dmers /
to keep their day of apoyntement with the duke of Lancastre / who was also
come to Calys / and the lord of Bocnyer with him / and after they went to
Bruges. And anon after the duke of Aniowe came to saint Dmers in great array /
and he sent for to be there with him / his cosyn sir Guy of Bloys / who came
thither out of Haynalt. than there lay in the frontres of France and of
Fla^ders toward Arde / and Croyes / and about Ba^llule in Flaunders / and
about Cassell and there about. The constable of France / the lords of Clysson
/ and Lauall / and sir Dlyuer of Manny with mo than.vi. hundred spears to keep
the country / that no let should come by the earl of Flanders / for they had
no great trust in him. nor also they would never come to Bruges for nothing
that the entreatours could us.

yE have herd here before how they of Bercerell were besieged the space of a
year / and how they had made a composicion to yield up their fortres without
they were reskewed by the feast of All saints / and when the day began to
aproche ye french king sent thither a great nombre of men of war. There were
all the knights of Bretayne and of Normandy: except such as were with the
constable. there were the mershals of France / sir Jews of Sa^xere / and sir
Mouton of Blanuylle / the earl of Harecourt / and sir James of Uien / the
admyrall of France / the doulpoyu of Auuergne / sir Johan of Bulle / and
dyuerss other lords. And all these held their journey and day before
Bercerell / but none came thither to apere before them / and so the forte resse
was yielded up / and every man departed who would / and so sir John^ Apert and
his men of Cornwall took the sea / and returned in to England / and the
lords of France took possessyon of the forteresse of Bercerell / and new
repaired it: and refresshed it with men / artyllary / and other puruyances. And
anon after by the co^mau^dment of the french king / all these men of war /
went and laid siege before saint Saluyour the vicount in Co^stantyne / which
parteyned before to sir Johan Chandos / and after his death / ye king of
England gave it sir Alayn of Boucquesell / who as tha^ was in England / and
he had left a captain there / a squier called Charenton / and with him sir
Thomas Cornet / Johan de Bourge / and the three brethren of Maulurier / and
with them there were a sixscore men of war. and so saint Savior was besieged
by see by sir Johan of Uien admyrall of France / and by land by the other
lords of Bretayne and Normandy. There was a great host / and they dressed up
engyns against the town whichesore traueyled them within the forteresse.

Now let us speak of the lords that (...) at Bruges / to entreat for a peace
of the french part. The dukes of Anion / and of Burgoyne / the earl of
Salebruch / the bishop of Amiens and the chief of Bayeux. And on the
englisshe part: there was ye duke of Lancaster the earl of Salisbury / and the
bishop of London. So at last / to thentent that none yuell nor trouble should
come to any of these lords / nor to none of their men / that rode in and out
daily between the parties. Therefore they agreed on a truce to endure to the
first day of May next after / in all the marches of Calais / and to the river
of Some / and other lands to be still in war. Than there was sent in to
Bretayne / the lord Clysson / and the lord de Lauall with all their companyes
to keep the fronters there about.

How the duke of Bretayne arrived in Bretayne: where he took diverse castles
and forteresses by force / and of the trewce that was made between the french
king and the king of England and their alyes. Cap. CCC.xiii.
While these lords were entreatyng for peace at Bruges. The duke of Bretayn
who was in England (as ye have herd here before) saw well how his country
was in great trybulacion and nighe all the country turned against him. And as
than the countess his wife was in the castle of Alroye / and him self about
ye king of England / who right hertely loved him / and to him said. Fayreson I
know well how for the love of me / ye have put in balance your lands / and
are put out of your seignory and fair heritage / but be ye in certain / that
I shall right well recover it you again / for I woll make no peace with the
frenchmen without ye be co^prssed therein / and you to have again your
heritage. The duke humbly thanked him. And so y^ same season the duke of
Bretayne assembled toguyder at Ha^pton / three M. archers. And they were all
paid their wages by the ordynance of the king of England for half a year /
and with the^ two. M. men of arms. And in yt journey there went / therles of
Ca^bridge and of March / the lord Spenser / sir Thom^s Hola^de / Nicholas
Camoire / Edward Twyford / Richard Pontchardon / Johan ^esselle / Thomas
Grantson / Hugh Hastynges the lords of Ma^ue / and of Pole / and diverse other
knights and squiers. the duke of Bretayne with all his company / arrived at
saint Mathewes of tyne Potern in Bretayne. and so took land and in contynent
assailed ye castle / which was without the town. the castle was not greatly
fortifyed another with men nor artillery. and so the engylsshmen took it by
force / and slew all them that were within: and when they within the town of
saint Mathewes knew thereof / they opened their gates and received in the duke
as their lord. Than thenglisshmen went to the town of Polle de Lion / which
was strong and well closed. There they made a great assaute / and the archers
being on the dykes shot so holy together / that few or none durst show them
self at defense / so the town was won / ouerron and exyled. and than they
went to Brue de Uaulx / which was well fortifyed with men of arms and other
purueyaunces / for the lords of Clysson and Beaumanoyre / the vycount of Rohan
/ and diverse other lords of Bretayne had been there but a little be fore / and
had refresshed the fortress with every thing that neded. and so the duke and
the englisshmen laid siege thereto. And when they of saint Savior the vicou^t
understood / how the duke of Bretayn and these lords of England were arrived
in Bretayne / they trusted that they would come thither and reyse the siege
about them / which they greatly desired / for they were greatly co^streyned by
their engyns / which did cast day and night / so that they wist not where to
keep themself out of danger. Than they took advise to entreat with the
frenchmen to have a truse to endure to Ester: the year of our lord. M. three
hundred.lxxv. which was but.vi. wekes after so that within that time they
should be fought withal orreysed fro the sege / or else to yield up the
forteresse their lives and goods saved. this truce was taken but they lay
still at siege / but they made no war each to other / during that season.

THe vicont of Rohan and the lords of Clisson and of Beaumanoyre / who lay in
fronter against the duke of Bretayne and the^glisshmen who lay at sege before
saint Bru de Uaulx / and they herd reported how sir John^ Deureux was nere to
Campelly and made great war in the country / and had newly repaired and
fortifyed a little fortress / wherein he was and made there his garyson / and
called it the Novel fort / so that they of Ca^pelly could not issue out of
their town without trouble. And so they sent word thereof to the lord Clysson
/ who was at Lamballe than he and his company departed thens / and left men
behind them to keep the town / and rode so long that they came to the new
forters / and laid seige thereto which tidings came to the duke of Bretayn /
where as he was at siege / before saint Brue de Uaulx / where as ye duke had
made a mine / the which had been a making ye space of.xv. days and at the same
time they had lost their mine and labor. And when the duke and the lords of
his host knew that / they said all things considered: they thought they
lost their time to abide there any longer. wherefore they said it were better
for them to go and aid sir John^ Deureux / for if we may find them in the
field that has laid siege to him: we trust we shall have a fair journey. So
than they disloged and rode toward the new forteresse / which the lords of
Bretayne made to be assailed / in such wise: that they were at the foot of the
wall and feared nothing that was cast down on the^ for they were well
pauesshed. and also they within had but little stuff to cast down / and
therewith / in all have there came one to the^: and said. sirs get you hens /
for yonder comes the duke of Bretayne with the englysshmen / they be not past
two leages hens. Than the trumpet sowned the retrayte / than they drew abacke
and took their horses and so departed / and went into Campelly which was not
far thens / and closed their gates and lift up their brydges. And by that time
the duke of Bretayne was come thither / with the barons of England in his
company / and they had past by ye new fortress and had spoken with sir
Johan Deureux / who thanked them of their coming: for else he had been soon
taken. And so the duke laid siege to the town of Campelly / and set forth
their archers and briga^tes well pauessed / and there they made a great assaut.
The englysshemen feigned not no more did they within / there were diverse hurt on
both parts. and every day there was an assaute / or else skrymysshe. They
within saw well / how they could not long endur / nor they saw no socours
coming also they saw well yt they could not issue out to depart / their
fortress was so closed on every side. And also they knew well if they were
taken byforce / they should have no mercy / and specially the lord Clysson /
thenglysshmen hated him so sore. tha^ the lords of Bretayn that were within
began to entreat with the duke to yield them self up / upon a courts ransom
/ but the duke would have them symply. so with much pain at last they gat
arespyte for.viii. days / and during the same respyte it fell well for them
within the forteresse / for two knights of England one sir Nicholas Carsuell
and sir Water Durswyke / were sent to the duke of Bretayne fro the duke of
Lancastre / co^maundyng that by virtue of treaty of peace / as was made at
Bruges: bitwene the king of England and ye french king / whereof they brought
charters sealed of the trewce. that without delay on the sight of them / to
leave and make war no more. So incontinent the truce was reed and publysshed
through the host / and also showed to them that were within Ca^pelly / whereof
they were right joyful. that is to say: the lord Clisson / the vicont of
Rohan / the lord of Beaumanoyre and ye other / for the trewce came well for
them: and thus brake up the siege of Ca^pelly. And ye duke of Bretayn gave
leave to all them that were with him to depart: except such as were daily in
his house / and so went to Alroy where his wife was. And than the earls of
Ca^bridge and of March / sir Thomas Holande earl of Irelande / the lord
Spenser / and the other englysshmen returned again in to England. When the
duke of Bretayn had ordered all his business by great leaser / he refresshed
the town and castle of Breest and Alroy / and than he returned again in to
England and his wife with him.

THe same day that the trewce was made at Bruges to endur for a hole year /
between the kings of England and France / and all their alies. And the duke
of Burgoyne for the one part / and the duke of Lancastre for the other part /
swear to come thither again at the feast of Alsayntes. and that each part
should hold and enjoy every thing that they had as than in possession /
during the said term. The englysshmen thought / that saint Savior the vicount
should be saved / by reason of that treaty / but the frenchmen said: that the
first couynant should pass the last ordynance. So that when the day aproched
that they ofsaynt Sauyoure should other yield up / or else be rescued by their
friends. The french king sent thither a great nombre of men of war / as a.vi.
thousand spears knights and squiers / beside other people / but none came
thither to reyse the siege. and wha^ the day was expyred there with in yielded
them up to the frenchlordes / full sore against their wylles / for yt
forteresse was well sittyng for the englysshmen / and the captain sir Thomas
Tynet and Johan de Bourc / and the three brethren of Malurier / and the other
englisshmen went to Carentyn / and so took shyppynge and returned into
England. Than the constable of France new refresshed the forteresse of saint
Saluyour the vicount / and set a breton knight captain therein / and
understood so as than / that the french king had given him that seignorie.

Of the journey that the lord of Coucy made in Austrych / and of the death of
the prince of wales / and how there could be found no manner of treaty of
peace bitwene the two kings. and also of the death of the king of England
Edward the third. Cap. CCC.xiiii.
THe same season there was come in to France the lord of Coucy / who had been
long in Lu^bardy with the earl of Virtue / son to sir Galeas / making war
against sir Barnabo and his alies / because of pope Gregory the.xi. and for the
holy college of Rome. The lord of Coucy by succession of his mother / who was
suster to the duke of Austryche last disseased / whereby he ought to be
enheryter to the duchy / for the duke was deed without issue / by way of
marriage. and they of Austrich / had given the duchy and land to another /
farther of by lynage than the lord Coucy / whereof the lord of Coucy had
often times complained to the emperor / the lord Charles of Behayne.
The Emperor knew well yt the lord Coucy had right thereto / how be it he might
not with his ease constrayne the^ of Austryche / for they were strong in his
country / and many good men of war. The lord of Coucy had made war there
before / by the conforte of his aunt suster to the duke / but little it auayled
him. and when he was thus come in to France the king made him great chere.
Than he aduysed and saw well / how there was in France as than many men of
war / satte as ydell. Wherefore he thought they could not be better ocupyed /
than to help him to his right: during the trewce between France and England.
Than the lord of Couey desy^^d the king to let him have of the bretons such as
over run the realm / to make war with him in Austryche. the king who would
gladly that the companyons were out of his realm / accorded to his desire. So
the king lend or gave him I can not tell wheder / a.lx. thousa^de frankes: to
depart among the said companyons. So they rode forth to ward Austryche about
ye feast ofsaynt Michell they did much yuell all the ways as they w^t. Also
there were diverse barons / knights / and squiers of France of Arthoys / of
Uermandoys / of Haynaulte / and of (...)rdy / as the vicountes of Meaul^ / and
Daunoy / sir Ra^e of Co^^y the ^arone of Roy / Peter of Bare / and diverse
other: desyring to (...) their bodies to get them honor.

When the feast of Alsayntes began to aproche / tha^ there came again to Bruges
to entreat for peace / fro the french king. the duke of Burgoyn the earl of
Sal^bruce / the bishop of and my^ns / and the duke of An^^we but he lay
(...) atsaynt Omers. And ^ro the king of England thither came: the duke of
Lancastre / the duke of Bretayne / the earl of Sal^sbury y^ bishop of London.
The town of Bruges was well garnysshed with diverse astates / and specially the
duke of Burgoyn kept there a noble astate. And with the duke of Lan^astre /
there was ser Robert of Namur and kept him good company / as long as the duke
was in Flaunders. and there were the ambassadors the archebysshop of Rohan /
and the bishop of Carpe^tras / who went still and labored between both
^ties / and laid forth many good reasons / but none came to any effect. These
lords were far a sondre in their treaties / for the french king demanded
to have again (...). hundred thousand frankes / the which were paid for the
redemption of king John^ / and to have Cala^s raised and beaten down. to the
which the king of England would never consent. so y^ trewce was continued to
the feast of saint Johan Baptyst next after: the year of our lord a thousand
three hundred.lxxvi. and so these lords ^aryed still at Bruges all that winter
/ and in somer they returned every part to their own countries except the duke
of Bretayne who tarried still in Flaunders / with the earl Loys his cosyn who
made him good cher. The same season on Trynite sunday: there past out of this
world the ^^oure of chi^alry of England / Edward prince of Wales and of
A^tayne / at the kings pala^s of Westmynster beside London. And so he was
enbawmed and put in leed / and kept till the feast of saint Michaell next after
/ to be entered with the greatter sole^^ytie when the parliament should be there.
King Charles of France because of lynage / did his obsequy reverently in the
holy chapel of the paleys in Paris. And there were many of the prelates and
nobles of the realm of France and so than the truce was prolo^ged / to the
first day of April next after. Now let us somewhat speak of the lord Coucy and
of the almayns.

When they of Austriche and the almayns / understood that the lord of Coucy /
was come with such a strength to make war. They caused to be brent and
distroyed three days ^ourney in to the country / along by the river. And than
they went in to the mountayns and places inhabytable / and so wha^ the lord of
Cou^y had wend to have found vytayle for his host / he could get none.
Whereby he suffered that winter much trouble and disease / for they wist not
whyder to go to forage / nor to get vitayle for they^ nor their horses: so
that some dyed / for hunger / cold and sickness. And therefore when the
springyng time began they returned again in to France / and went in to diverse
places to refresshe them self. And the french king sent the most part of
the co^panyons in to Bretayne / and in to base Normandy to a^yde and rest there
/ for he thought well he should have so^what to do in short time after. And at
the retournyng of the lord Cou^y in to France he began to be good french /
because he ^ounde the king so amyable to condiscende to his desire. And also
his counsel said / he ne^^ not to a void out of his heritage under the
shadow of the king of Englandes war: for they said he was french of name /
of blood / of arms / and extraction. He sent his wife into England / and kept
still with him his eldest daughter / and left the younger still in England /
where as she had been brought up and norisshed* Than y^ french king sent the
lord Coucy to Bruges to them that were there to entreat for the peace / how
bent as than the great lords were not there / but all only the duke of
Bretayne / who was still with his cosyn therle of Flaunders / but he busyed him
self but little in the treaty for the peace. And after the feast of saint
Mychaell / when the obsequy of the prince was done and fynisshed / than the
king of England made to be known to his (...)* The duke of Lancaster / the
earl of Cambridge / and to the lord Thom^s the youngest / and to all the barons
/ earls / prelates / and knights of England: how that the young Richard
should be king after his discease. And so caused them all to swear solemly to
maynteyne him / and on Christmas day the king made him to sytte at his table /
above all his own children in great estate / representyng that he should be
ky^^^ alter his discease. And there was sent to Bruges for the king of
Englandes part: John^ lord Cobham / the bishop of Herforde / and the mayre
of London. And for the french party / thither came the earl of Salebruche /
the lord of Chastellon / and master Phylbert Les(...) / and the two
bysshoppes embassadr^ / always went between the parties treating for peace /
and spoke of a marriage to be had / between the young prince of England and my
lady Ma^y / daughter to the french king. And so they departed / as well they of
France as of England and so made report to both kings: and than about lent
there was a secret treaty (...) / to be between the two kyngesat Moutrell by
the sea. And so were sent by the king of England to Calais / sir Richard
Dangle / Richard Stan / Ge^^ray Cha^^er* And fro the french king was sent /
the lord of Cou^y and of Riuyer / sir Nycholas Braques / and Nycholas Brasier
/ and they along season treated on the said marriage. And the frenchmen offered
as I was enfourmed diverse thyng^s / and they would have again otherthynges /
such as they named or else nothing. Than these entreatours went and made report
to their lords / and so the trewce was again relonged to the first day of
May / and so came again to Calais / the earl of Salisbury / y^ bishop of
saint Dauyd chau^cellour of England and the bishop of Herforde. And for the
french king at Muttrell: there was the lord of Coucy / sir Wylliam of
Dormans chau^cellour of France / but they durst never trust to mete toguy ^er
in any place between Mutterell and Cal^^^ / nor between Mutterell and Boleyn /
nor in the fronters for any thing that the two bysshoppes ambassadors could do
orshewe. Thus these entreatours abode in this astate / till the (...) was
expyred.

ANd when the war was open / than sir Hughe Caurell was sent to be kepar of
Calais. When pope Gregoriebeynge (...) ^non understood that no peace could be
had by^wene France and England / he was right sorousull / and ordered his
business shortly and went to Rome. And when the duke of Breten who had ^e^
more than a year with the earl of Flanders his cosyn / saw that ye war was
open. he took leave of therle and went to Grauelyng / and thither he came to
therle of Salisbury and sir Richard Dangle / and so went with them to Calais
and there tarried the space of a month / and so went in to England and came to
Shene (...) four leages fro London / a long by the Temmes side / where the
king of England lay sore sy^ke. And past out of this world / the (...) gyll
ofsaynt John^ Baptyst: y^ year of our lord a thousand three hundred.lxxvii.

THan was there great sorrow made in England / and incontinent all the
passages of the realm were stoppedde / that none should issue out of the
realm. For they would not that the death of the king should be so soon known
in France / till they haddeset the realm in some order. The same time there
came in to England the earl of Salisbury / and sir Richard Dangle. So the
body of king Edward the third: with great processyons / we^ynges / and
lamentacyons / his sons behind him / with all the nobles and prelates of
England: was brought a long the city of London with open visage to
Westmynster / and there he was buried beside the queen his wife. And anon after
the young king Richard was crowned at the palace of Westmynster with great
solem^ytie / and by him stood the dukes of La^^^llre and of Bretayne: the.xi.
year of his age in the month of July. The which day there was made four earls
and nine knights. First the lord Nycholas his uncle / was made ^rle of
^olengy / the lord Percy earl of Northumberlande / sir Thomas Dangle earl of
Huntyngdon / the lord Mombray earl of Notyngham. And the young king was put
unto the rule of the gentle knight sir Richard Dangle / by the accord of all
the land / to be instru^ted in noble virtues / and the realm of England / to
be governed by the duke of Lancastre. And as soon as the french king knew
of the death of king Edward / he said: how ^yght^obly / and valiantly he
had reyg^ed: and well he ought to be put newly in remem^raunce / among the
nombre of the worthyes. Than he assembled a great nombre of the nobles and
prelates of his realm / and did his obs^quy in ye holy chapel in his palys at
Paris. And anon after dyed ye eldest daughter of the french king / who was
ensured to have been married to Wylliam of Heynault / eldest son of duke
Aubert.

How the french king sent a great navy to the sea / and how diverse towns
were brent in England: and how the duke of Burgoyne took diverse castles
about Calys. Cap. CCC.xv.
IN the mean seasone while this said trewce endured / the french king
provided greatly for ships andgaleys. And the king of Spain had sent to him
his admyrall sir Ferraunt Sause. Who with sir Johan de Uien admyrall of France
/ when the tree we was expired went and brent the town of Rye / a four days
after the death of king Edward / in the vigill of saint Peter in July. and
there slew men and women / and all they found. These tidings came to London
/ than therles of Cambridge and Bouligney went to Dover / with a great nombre
of men of war. And the earl of Salisbury and the lord Montagu / went to the
marches toward Ha^pton. Than after the french army took laud in the I Will of
Ubyq^ / and brent therm diverse to wnes / as Lame^d Dartmouth Plomouthe /
Plesume / and diverse other. and when they had burnt and pylled the town of
Ubique / they went again to ye see and costed forewarde / and came to a port
called Poc. there was ready the earl of Salisbury / and the lord Montague / who
defended the passage: howebeit they burnt part of the town of Poc. and than
took the sea again and costed toward Ha^pton / and would daily have taken
land in England / but the englysshmen in the company of the earl of Salisbury
rode so daily / alonge the sea cost: that they kept them ever fro taking of any
land. Than ye frenchmen came before Ha^pton / and there was ready sir Johan
Aru^dell / with a great nombre of men of war and archers who defended the
town / or else it had been taken. than the frenchmen departed and went toward
Dover / and took land on a day (...) a little abbay called Lians. There were
many men of the country assembled / and they had made the priour of the place
and sir Thomas Cheyny and Johan Fuselle their chief capitayns / who set them
self in good array to defend the passage / so that the frenchmen had but
small advantage / for it cost them much people or they could take land /
how be it finally by force of good fightyng they took land. There was a sore
scrimysshe / how beit the englysshmen were driven back and put to flight /
and two hundred slain: and the two knights and the priour taken prisoners.
than the french men entered again in to their ships / and lay still all that
night at ancre before the abbey. There the french men knew first of the death
of king Edward of England by their prisonners / and of the coronacyon of
king Richard / and a great part of the order made in England: for rulynge of
the realm. Than sir Johan of Uyenne caused a bark to depart / and sent
therein a knight / who aryued at Harflewe. And than the knight rode to Paris /
and there he found the king / and there showed him the certain tidings of
the death of king Edward. To which saying the king gave credence. Than the
frenchmen and spanyardes departed / and sailed forth and had wind at will /
and came with the same tide about threof the clock to Dover. There was sir
Edmonde earl of Cambridge / and sir Thomas his brother earl of Buckynghame /
who were ready with a hundred thousand with baners displayed / abydinge the
frenchmen / who were a sixscore ships and galyes. The frenchemen came foreby
the port and tarried not / but passed by and took the deep see / for the sea
began to ebb. How beit the englysshmen tarried there still all that day and
the nextnight / and the french men by the next tide came before the haven of
Calays / and there entered.

yE have herd here before: how sir Johan captall of Beufz / was taken prisoner
before Soubise / and kept in the tower of the temple of Paris. The king of
England and the prince while they lived / would gladly have had him delivered:
there was also much entreatie made for him at the counsel at Bruges / and there
was offered for him in exchange / the young earl of saint Poule / and three or
four other knights / but the french king nor his counsel would not consent
thereto. Howbeit the french king made to be showed him by the priour / who had
him in keeping: y^ if he would swear / never to bear arms against ye crown of
France / that than he would condiscende to his delyuerance. The Captall
answered / that he would never make that oath / to dye in prison. so he abode in
prison in sure keeping a.v. year with little joy / for he took his prisonment
but with little pacyence / and so long he was there that at last he dyed in
prison. The french king caused him to be entered right solemply / and thereat
were diverse barownes / knights / and prelates of France. Thus feblyssed
thenglissh capitaynes / for y^ same year there dyed also the lord Spensar a
great baron in England / and a good knight. And of him and of his wife / who
was daughter to sir Bartylmewe of Brunes / there abode a son and four
daughters. And anon after the death of the said Captall / the french queen
was delivered of a fair daughter / named Mary: Of the which birth / the
queen took such a sickness ye she dyed. This queen / who was full of noble
vtues: was daughter to the gentle duke of Burbone the lord Peter / who dyed
at the battle of Poycters. Her obsequy was done in the abbay of saint Denyse
/ where she was buried with great solempnyte / whereat there was nighe all ye
nobles and prelates of France: and namely they about the marchesse of Paris.

ALl this season / sir Hughe Caurell captain of Calais / sir John^ Harlston
capitayn of Guynes / the lord of Gomegines captain of Arde. Made many
iourneys in to Picardy / every weke three or four: and often times ran before
saint Omers and Arkes / Moton Fye^nes and therabout / to Boloyne and sometime to
Tyrwyn. And specially the garyson of Arde did much hurt in the country /
whereof the complayntes came oftentimes to the herynge of the french king.
Whereupon he took counsel to know how he might best restrayn them / and it
was showed him how that ye garyson of Arde was not so strong: but that it
might easily begoten. Than the king said / to have it we will spare for no
cost. Than within a little space after / he made a somo^s of men of war
secretly / no man wist whider he would send them. The chief of them was the
duke of Burgoyne his brother: he had a.xv. hundred spears well furnysshed /
and suddenly they ca^e to the bastyde of Arde / and besieged it round about.
And with the duke of Burgoyne: there was the earl of Guynes / the marshall of
Blanuyle / the lords of Clysson and of Lauall / of Rougemont / of the river of
Bregyde / of Frannyll / of Danuyll / of Dautoyng / of Raueuall / and of Angest
/ sir James of Burbone / the seneshall of Heynalte / and diverse other knights
and barons. And they had engyns that cast night and day / stones of two
hundred weight / and assailed it right feirsly. The lord Gomegynes lord of
the forteresse / when he saw him self enclosed with so many noble men of
war / and they promised him that if he were won with assaut / that he and
all those with him should dye. And also he was not well provided of artillary
long to endure: and so by the procurement of the lord of Raneuall his cosyn
germayn / he entered in to a treaty and to yield up the garyson / their lives
and goods saved. This treaty was long a making / how beit at last the
forteresse was given up / and such as would departed: and were brought to
Calais by sir Gawen of bayllule: and sir Wylliam of Bourdes was made captain
of Ard^. And after him was kepar there a long time the vicount of Meaulx / and
thirdly after him was captain there / the lord of Sampy. The same day that
Arde was delivered / the duke went and laid siege to the castle of Arduyche.
wherein were capitayns / the three brethren of Mauluryer. There the duke lay
three days / and made diverse assautes: at last they within yielded up the
castle / and they were brought to Calys by the marshall of France. Than the
duke went and besieged Uauclinen / Which also yielded up as the other did. And
when the duke had new refresshed these places with vitayls and men / than he
gave license to every man to depart: and so went himself in to France to the
king / and the other lords bretons went into Bretayne. For tidings was
brought them / that the duke of Bretayne was aryued at Breast with a great army
and the lords of Burgoyne and other places / returned every man to their own.

How the war began again / between the french king and the king of Nauerre:
and how the king of Nauer lost the cou^tie of Deureux / except Chierbourge /
which was beseged by the frenchmen. And of the journey that the duke of
Lancastre made in to Bretayne. Cap. CCC.xvi.
VE have herd here before / of y^ peace made at Uernon / between the french
king and the king of Nauar: and how the king of Nauar left his two sons
with their uncle the french king. After there was a great suspect laid on a
squire being in the french kings court / attendyng on the two sons of the
king of Nauarr. This squire was called James of Rue. And also on a clerk / a
great master and of the king of Nauars counsel / and a great governor in
the county of Deuxeux / called master Peter of Tartre. They were iuged to
death / and so cruelly they were executed at Paris / and there showed before all
the people / how they were in mind to have enpoysoned the french king. Than
the king reared up a great army of men of war / and made the constable chief
leader of them / and with him the lord de la River / and diverse barons and
knights. And so they all went into Normandy to the fortresses and castles of
the king of Navarre / which were fair and noble / and well garnysshed. And so
they laid siege to a forteresse called Ponteau de mere / they had diverse go^nes
engyns / and ableme^tes for the saut / whet with they troubled sore the
forteresse / and them that were within: howbeit they did defend them self
valiantly. There were diverse sautes and scrimysshes a long space during this
siege. The castle was sore bruised and they wtin sore oppressed / and desired
oftentimes by the constable to give up the forteresse / or else if they were
taken by force / he promised the^ that they should all dye: customably such
was the co^stables promise. The naueroyse saw how their vitayls began to
mynisshe / and knew well how the king of Nauer was far fro them: so they
yielded up the fortress / and they were conveyed to Chierbourge / and had their
goods with the^ The fortress was rased and beaten down to the earth / which
had cost much the making thereof: also the walls of Po^teau de mere was
beaten down. Than the frenchmen went and besieged the fortress of Mortayne /
and there lay a great season: but they within saw no manner of aid nor confort
/ coming fro the king of Nauarr / nor also the other forteresses were not able
to make resystence against the frenchmen: and so they gave up as other did
before. The same season the constable brought into the french kings
obeysaunce: all the towns / castelles and fortresses / in all the county of
Deureur. And all the forteresses beaten down to the earth and the towns
unclosed / to thentent that there should never after rise any war unto the
realm of France / by the means of any castle or town / y^ the king of
Nauer should have in the county of Deureux. Also the french king made the
gabelles and subsydies to rynne there / as well as in any other part of the
realm of France.

ALso the same time / the king of Spaygne made his bastard brother to enter in
to Nauarr / with a great nombre of men of war / who began to win the
country / and assailed towns and fortresses: so yt the king of Nauerr could
make no resystence against them. Than he sent word thereof to the young king
Richard of England / desyring him of aid against the french king / in the
county of Deureux. And he him self to abide still in Nauar to keep his
fortresses there / against the king of Spaygne. And so king Richard / by the
advise of his counsel: sent sir Robert d^ Roux with a nombre of men of arms
and archers to the sea / and they took land at Chierbourc. And thither came all
those that had been put out of the fortresses in the county of Deureux by the
french constable. And when they were there all together / they were a great
nombre of chosen men: and so they provided well for the fortress / for they
believed to be beseged. When the constable and the lord de la River with their
company / had won all in the cou^tie of Deureux / so that nothing was left
aparant for the king of Nauer / but all was unclosed and under the obeisance of
the french king. Tha^ they ca^e before Chierbourc / which was strong and nobly
founded / first by Julyus Caesar / when he conquered England: and there is a
port of the sea. The frenchmen laid siege round about it: except on the sea
side / and so they determined not to depart thens / till they had won it. Sir
Robert de Roux and his company within / made many issues day and night for there
was no there day nor night / but that there was a scrimysshe. The frenchmen
could seek for no deed of arms / but that they found ynowe ever to answer
the^. So there were many slain and taken / as well on the one part as on the
other during the siege / which lasted all the remynaunt of the summer. Thanne
sir Olyuere of Clesquy / made on a day a busshement / and so began to
scrimisshe: And than the french men were driven back to the busshment. Than
sir Olyuer of Clesquy ca^e out of his enbusshment and all his / and ran
feirlly at thenglysshmen and naueroyes. There was an hard encou^tre on both
parties / many a man borne to y^ earth slain / hurt / taken and rescued:
finally sir Olyuer of Clesquy was taken prisoner / by asquier of Nauer called
John^ Coq / and so was put into Chierbourge. And so the scrymysshe ended / more
to the damage of y^ frenchmen than to the englisshmen / and sir Olyuer was sent
in to England / and there abode as prisoner a long space at London / and after
he was put to his ransom. Thus in great cost and charge / the frenchemen
abode still a great part of y^ winter with little conquest / and so they saw
well how they lost their time with lyeng there. They thought well that
Chierbourc was inprignable / for always they might be new refresshed with
vitayls and men by the sea / wherefore the frenchemen dislodged and laid
counter garysons against Chierbource / as at Mountbourge / at Pount done
Charentyn / saint Lou / and saint Saluiour the vicount / than every man badde
leave to deperte. This was in y^ year of our lord a thousand three
hundred.lxxviii.

yE have well hard here before / how the duke of Bretayne was departed out of
Bretayn and had with him his wife in to England / and so he abode on such
laud as he had in England / which was called the county of Richemont / and
he labored sore to the young king Richard and to his counsel to have help
and aid to recover his land again / which was turned french: but he could
not be herd as than. The same season the duke of Lancastre was enfourmed that
if he would go in to Bretayne with a great army / there were diverse
forteresses and castles that would yield up to him / and specially saint Malo
the Isle a fair fortress and a haven on the sea. Than the duke of Lancastre
raised up an army and went to Hampton / and so took the sea with a great nombre
of lords and knights / men of war and archers / and so sailed forth till
they came at saint Malos / and took land and discharged their purueyance / and
so laid siege about the town of saint Malo. They within y^ town were nothing
afraid / for they were well provided of vitayls / of men of war and of cross
bows / who valiantly defended the^ self / so there the duke lay a long
space. And when the constable of France / and the lord Clisson knew thereof /
they made a great sommons of men of war / and ca^e toward saint Malos to
reyse the siege. A man would have thought diverse times y^ battle should have
been between the parties. The englysshmen often times ordered themself ready to
give battle / but the constable nor the lord Clysson / would never aproche so
nere y^ battle might be between the^. And so when the englisshmen had been there
a great space they saw well they of the town had no will to yield them up.
Than the duke of Lancastre had counsel to disloge / seeing they lost their
time with lyeng there / and so he took again the sea and returned in to
England / and gave leave to every man to depart.

How the castle of Alroy in Bretayne was yielded up french / and of the
french garyson that was laid at Mountbourge / against the garyson of
Chierbourc. Cap. CCC.xvii.
ALl this time the castle of Alroy was in the possession of the duke of Bretayn
who lay still in England. The french king sent diverse lords of France and
of Bretayne / with a great nombre to ley siege to the castle of Alroy / and
they in Alroy knew no socour coming to the^ fro any part / wherefore they fell
in treaty / so y^ if they were not socoured by the duke of Bretayne or by the
king of England by a certain day lymytted / than they to yield up the place:
which treaty was agreed. So the day came and the frenchmen kept their journey
and none a pered / another fro the duke of Bretayne nor fro the king of
England. So the castle was given up and put under the obeysau^ce of the
french king as the other castles and good towns of Bretayne were. And so they
deperted fro Alroy such as were ^in for the duke of Bretayne.

The year of our lord / a thousand three hundred.lxxviii. Anon after Easter
king Charles of France / saw well how they of Chierbourc made sore war in
the county of Constantyne. he than ordained sir Wyll^^ of Bordes a valiant
knight and a good captain to be keeper and sovereign capityne of Constantyne /
and of all the fortresses there about Chierbourc and so the said sir Wyllim^
with a fair company of men of arms and cross bows genowayes / went and lay
at Mountbourge / where he made counter garyson against Chierbourc / for he
desired nothing so much / as to fight with the englysshmen in Chierbourc /
co^sydering: how he had with him the flower of men of arms / with them of the
garysons there about. The same season there was sent to be captain at
Chierbourc an englisshe knight / called sir John^ Harlston / of whom I have
often spoken here before / he had been a long space captain of Guyens / he
took shippyng at Ha^mpton with.iii. hundred men of arms and as many archers /
and so arrived at Chierbourc. and with him was sir Oaths of Grantson / and of
englisshmen there were / sir Johan Aubourge / sir John^ Orsell / and diverse
other knights and squyers / and as soon as they were arrived / they discharged
all their horses and baggages / and tarried there certain days / and made them
ready to ride abroad in the country and to make war. Also sir Wylliam Brodes of
the french party / imagyned night and day / how he might do any damage to
the englysshmen. The same season these two knights laid many busshementis each
for other / but it aueyled nothing: for it was not their fortunes to mete / but
sometime / some of their companyes met together / as they rode about sekyng for
adventures / and as they met often times they ouerthrewe each other / sometime
the frenchmen wanne / and sometime they lost.

SO long they rode forth and laid wait each for other / that in a morning sir
Wylliam of Bordes and all his garyson of Montbourge thought to ride forth
toward Chierbourc / and to fight with sir Johan Harlstone / if he might
encounter with him / or to draw him in to the field. and so he rode forth
withal his company and puyssau^ce / as well men of arms and crosbowes as me^ a
foot. On the other part sir John^ Harlston / who knew nothing that the
frenchmen were abroad / had also great desire to ride forth the same morning /
and so sowned his trumpettes / and caused all his company to be armed / as well
a horseback as a foot And so went all out in to the feldes / and ordained them
that should bide in the forteresse / and so rode forth in great array / and
ordained sir Orsell to be captain of the fotemen / and than ordained his
currours. in likewise so had done sir Wylliam of Bordes / and so long both
parties rode forth / that at last their currours ca^^ so nere toguyder / that
each of the^ aduysed well other and so each of them returned to their own
host / and reported the certayntie of their enemies. Than these two capitaynes
were right ioyouse for than they had found that they had long sought. And
when these two captain had herd the report of their courrours / they drue
their companyes together / and displayed their baners and standerdes / and
aproched each other. And as soon as they were nere together within the shot
of a bow / than the frenchmen a lighted / and in likewise did the
englysshemen / and the archers and cross bows began to shote: and men of arms
aproched with spears in their hands / rainged and well closed to gyder. Than
they assembled together in all pertes / and began to foyne with spears and
stryke with axes and swexdes. There was a sore and a hard bataile and well
fought: men of arms proved well there / their valya^tise and prowes. Sir
Wylliam of Bordes was there armed at all peses / with an axe in his hand
strikyng on the right side and on the lift / whom soever he gave a full stroke
went to the earth. there he did such deeds of arms with his own body that it
ought to be praised forever. On the other / side sir Johan Harlstone captain
of Chierbourc / fought valiantly with an axe in his hand a foot among other
with the formast / he had enough to do: for he was matched with a hard part.
There was many a valyant deed done that day / and many a man slain and hurt.
and there sir Johan Harlston was borne down to the earth / and in great
adventure of his life / but by force of arms he was rescued. The battle
endured a long space and well fought and well continued on both perties / there
was none that had any great advantage / for there were diverse slain and hurt
on both parties / but finally the englysshmen fought so long and with so good
hertes / that they obtained the place / and the frenchmen disconfyted / slain
/ and taken / and but few noble men said. For they were so sore fought
withal / that they had no power to depart / thinkyng outher all to dye or else
to va^quesshe their enemies. There was taken ser Wylliam of Bordes by a squire
of Heynault / called Wylliam de Beaulyau / a man of arms who had long lain
among the englysshmen at the garyson in Calais / to whom the said sir Wylliam
yielded him self / right soroufull that the journey had not ben his. There
thenglisshmen brought the frenchmen to great myschefe / and many were taken
prisoners at the end of ye battle / but it was great pytie of the^ that were
deed. And when thenglysshmen had dispoyled the deed men. than sir John^
Harlston and his company departed fro the place / and leyde with them their
prisoners and spoil: and so went again to Chierbourc. ye may well know that
the englisshmen made great toye / for thiss journey ye god had sent them. sir
Wylliam of Bordes des was greatly feested / for his person was well worthy to
be made much of. This discomfyture was between Mountbourge and Chierbourc on
saint Martyns day: the year of our lord a thousand threhundred.lxxir.

When the french king knew that tydinges: how the garrison of Mountbourge
and his captain were taken and slain / and how that the country was in a
great afray for yt disco^fyture. The king who was sage and well abuysed in all
his deeds / he purueyed incontinent for remedy / and sent with out delay to
Mou^tbourge new men of war to keep the fronters / fortresses / and country /
against the garyson of Chierbourc. And chief of those men of war was sir
Johan of Uyen / and sir Hugh of Bremalles. and so they held the marches
against thenglysshmen / but after by the ordynance of the french king / they
abandoned and forsook Mountbourge / and all the country of Constantyne / which
was a goodly plentyfull country: and caused men / women / and children to issue
out / and forsake the country of Constantyne / and left up fair houses and
possessions / and all the people went out of the country of Constantyne. and
than the frenchmen keep fro^ter at Dune / at Care^ton / at saint Malo / and on
all the marches joining to Constantyne.

Of the journey that the duke of ^^iou made against thenglisshmen / in the
country of Burdeloyse. Cap. CCC.xviii.
YE have well herd here before how the duke of Burgoyne made a viage into the
marches of Picardy / the which was right honorable for him / and profitable for
yt frenchmen. and how he ordained in Arthoise / in such castles as were in his
possession capytens and men of war to keep them / and specially in the town
of Iper / he stallysshed to abide there the vycounte of Meaulx and the lord of
saint Pee / and they newly fortifyed the town how be it / it was stronger
enough before. The french king who was right glad of those tydingess and
reputed yt journey right honorable / he sent incontinent his letters to saint
Omers / and commanded that the town of Air should be well garnysshed / and
well and largely provided of all necessaryes / and all thing was done as he
commanded. so thus this journey brake up / howbeit the lord of Clisson and
the bretons brake not their company but as soon as they might they drew them
to Bretayne / for tidings was come to ye lord Clysson and to y^ bretons while
they were before Air / how that Janequyn de Clear / a squier of England and a
good man of arms was issued out of England and come in to Bretayne / and kept
the bastydes before Breest. Wherefore the bretons drew thither as fast as they
might / and brought with them sir Jaques of Uertayne seneshall of Heynalt /
and the duke of Burgoyne returned in to France to the king his brother.

The same season there was a great assembly of men of arms in the marches of
Burdeuux / at the commandment of ye duke of Aniou and of the constable. And
they had a journey against the gascoyns and englisshmen / whereof I shall speak
more plainly / when I shall be better enfourmed thereof / than I am as yet. The
same time that the duke of Burgoyn made his army in Picardy as it has been
showed before. The duke of Aniou was in the good city of Toulouse with the
good lady his wife / and night and day he ymagined subtelly: how he might do
some thing contrary to thenglyssmen. for he saw and knew well how there were
diverse towns and castelles a long the ryue^ of Dordone and in the fronters of
Rouurgue / Tholosen / and Duercy / that co^streyned greatly the country / and
traueyled much the poor people under their obeisance. Wherefore he aduysed to
provide therefore some remedy / and so determined in his mind to go and lay
siege to Bergerath / because it was the kaye of Gascoyne as on the fronter of
Rouuergue / Duercy and Lunosyn. And because yt he knew that diverse great
barons of Gascoyne were contrary to him as the lord of Duras / the lord of
Rosen / the lord of ^ucydent / yt lord of Langurant / the lord of Guernols /
and of Carles / sir Peter of Landuras and diverse other. therefore he aduysed to
make him self strong and puyssante / and made a great assemble to resyst
against the said lords and to be so strong to keep the field. Than he wrote
to sir Johan of Armynake / desirynge him not to fail at that b^synes / and in
likewise he sent to the lord Dalbret: and all o he sent in to France for the
constable and marshall of France / sir Loys of Sa^xere. and beside all this
the lord of Coucy and diverse other knights and squiers in Picardy / in
Britayne and in Normandy: desired greatly and had great will to serve him / and
to auau^ce their bodies by feats of arms to acheue to honor and praise / and
there was come to him the constable and marshall of France. The duke knew well
how there was a great discord between the cosyns and friends of the lord of
Pointers gascons and sir Thom^s Phelton great (...)shall of Burdeux and
Burdeloys / the reason (...) cause why / I shall show you here after.

BEfore that time in the year of our lord a thousand three hundred.lxxv. there
was done a cruel justice in the city of Bordeaux / done and comprised by sir
Thomas Phelton / lieutenant to the king of England in the marches of Burdeur /
on the lord of Pomiers called sir Wyllm^ and all by manner of treason / whereof
there was had great marueyle. In the city of Burdeur at the commandment of
the seneshall was taken the lord of Pomers and a clerk of his counsel and
secretary / of the nacyon of Burdeau^ / called Johan Coulone and it was proved
on them as I was infourmed / how the lord of Pomiers should yield himself and
all his castles to the french part / so that he could make non excuse to save
him fro death / wherefore the lord of Pomiers and his clerk were openly
beheeded in the city of Burdeux / before all the people / whereof there was
had great merueyle. And they of his lynage took that deed in great dispyte /
and thereupon departed fro Burdeu^ and fro Burdeloys the gentle knight sir
Edmond of Pomiers / uncle to the forsaid lord of Pomiers and took that deed in
great shame and swear y^ for the king of England he would never dear armur /
and so he went over the sea to the holy sepulcher / and to diverse other
pylgrimages / and when he returned / he turned himself french and put him
self and all his lands under the obeisance of the french king. And
incontinent defied the lord Lespare gascone / and made to him great war /
because he was at the foresaid judgment / and also for the same cause and
suspectyon / because the castle of Fron^a^ was taken / and delivered in to the
french hands which was of the heritage of the lord Pomiers before beheeded
/ there was taken for the same suspect of treason / sir Johan of Plessac / sir
Peter of Landuras and sir Bertram of France and were put in prison in Burdeaur
/ and so remained y^ space of. (...). months / howebe it after they were
delivered by y^ labor and purchase of their friends / and because there could
nothing be proved against them. Thus they endured a long space in great
danger / and in the same case / words ran against sir Gaylart Uyghier whereof
was had great marueyle / for he was not in the country / he was in Lombardy
with the lord of Coucy in y^ service of pope Gregory / who helped to excuse
him when he herd of that report / and so the knight abode still by his right.
so there engendered in Gascon for such besynes great hatredes and covert envy /
whereby fell after many great myscheues.

When the duke of Aniowe saw / that it was time for him to deperte out of
Toulouse / and that the most part of his men of war were come to him and
drawn in to the field / and specially the constable of France / in whom he
had great trust and confydence. Than he departed fro Toulouse / and took the
right way to Bergerath / and keeper thereof and capitayn was ser Parducas Dalbret
/ who was in a castle a little leage fro Languedoc / called Mou^ux a right
fair castle. so long traueyled the duke of Anious host / that they aryued
before Bergerath / and so lodged about it as nigh the river as they might / for
ye ease of them self and of their horses. there was with the duke of Aniou
many noble men. first sir Johan of Armynake with a great rout / the constable
of France with a great company / sir Loys of Sanxer sir John^ of Bulle / Peter
of Bulle / yuan of Wales / sir Mores Trisiquidi / who sometime was on the
englisshe part of Bretayne / but as than he was one of the french bretons /
also sir Alayn of Beaumont / sir Alayn of Housey / sir Wylliam and Peter of
Mornay / sir Johan of Uers / sir Baudwyn Cremoux / Thybalte of Pount / Helyot
of Calay / and diverse other good men of war. There they made their lodgings
alonge the fair meadows / by the river side of Dordon / which was great
pleasur to behold. nere to the dukes lodgyng was the constable of France
lodged / often times these companyons desired to auaunce their bodies / and
went and scrimysshed at the barryers / and so some were hurt and wounded / as
adventure falls often times in such deeds of arms / The s^^iday after the
siege was laid before Bergerath there came in to the dukes host / well
acompanyed with men of arms and briga^tes / the lord Dalbret and sir Bertram
his cosyn: they were received with great joy for y^ host was gretlye enforsed
by the^. The.viii. day the duke an^ the capitayns of the host were in
counsel to se how they might grieve them of Bergerath / there were diverse
words and deuyses / and they were long at one point / which was to assail
the town. than it was thought again that by their assautes / their people
might be sore hurt and to little effect / and so for that day the counsel
brake up / and determined on no full conclusyon / saving to contynewe still
their siege / for they looked daily for mo men of war coming out of France
/ and specially the lord of Coucy.

Of the scrymisshes done before Bergerath: and how the englisshmen /
fre^chemen / gascoyns and other: feirlly recou^tred each other. Ca. CCC.xix.
IT was so that sir Thomas Felton being at Burdeaulx / and knowing that his
enemies were wtin.xii. mile of him / with such a puyssaunce that he was not
able to resyst against them / whereof he was nothing ioyouse. And all that
season he knew well / how the duke of Aniou had made his somons / and had
sent for all the states of France. Than he sent word thereof into England to
the king and to his counsel / but they that he sent thither did little good
or nothing in the matter. For the realm of England was as than in great
bariau^ce among them self / one against an other / and specially the duke of
Lancastre was not in the favor of the comen people / whereby diverse incydent
parels fell after in England. the which season there deperted no men of war
out of England / another to go in to Gascoyne / nor yet in to Bretayne. Whereof
they that kept those fronters / under the young king of England / were
nothing ioyouse. Than sir Thom^s Felton desired the lord Lespare to go in to
England the better to enfourme the king and his uncles of the state of Gascoyn
and thereby to provide counsel for them. And so at the desire of sir Thomas
Felton / the lord Lespare entered in to thesee but there rose such a tempest
against him that he was driven in to Spain / and there was encountered by
ships of Spain / and had there a great bataile and such was his fortune
that there he was taken prisoner / and led in to Spain / and there remained
more tha^ a year and a half / for he was still behated with them of the lynage
of the lord Pomers. sir Thom^s Felton / who was a right valyau^te man / wrote
and sent specially for the lord of Musident / the lord Duras / the lord Rosen
/ and for the lord Langurant / who were four of the chief barons and most
puyssau^te in all Gascoyn / of the englisshe party / desiryng them that for the
honor and heritage of the king of England / they would come and help to
defend the country / and to come with all their puyssance to Burdeaulx. So
than all knights / such as would truly acquyte the^ to their king and lord
and to his officers / were ready come to Burdeaulx. And when they were all
together / they were to the no^bre of.v. hundred spears / and thus they were at
Bordeaux and in Burdeloys / the season while the duke of Aniou lay at siege
before Bergerath. than sir Thomas Phelton and those four barons of Gascone
took their counsel and advise / and determined to ride forth against the
frenchmen / and to enter in to some place to se if they might spy any
advantage / to conquer any thing against their enemies. And so they departed
out of Bordeaux in one company / mo than three hundred spears / and took the
way to Ryoll and so came to a town called yuret and there lodged. Of this
busshme^t knew nothing the frenchmen whereby they had great damage. Thus held
still the siege before Bergerath where many a scrimishe was made / and many a
seat of arms acheued / both by them within and the^ without / how beit
little wanne thereby the frenchmen / for sir Parducas Dalbret who was captain
/ defended valiauntly the town. Than they of the host without / to thentent
to grieve the sorer their enemies / they sent to Rioll for a great engyn called
the truye. This engyn was so made yt it would cast great stones / and a hundred
men of arms might well be within it / to aproche to assail the town. sir
Peter de Bulle was ordained to fetch this engyn / and with him sir John^ of
Uers / sir Baudwen Cremoux / sir Alayn Beaumont / the lord o^ Mount calay and
the lord of Gaures. And so they departed fro the host about a three hundred
spears and passed by a gyde the river of Dordon and rode toward Ryoll. And so
they came forby a place bitwene Bergerath and Rioll called yuret / where as the
englisshmen were mo than four hundred spears / and knew nothing of the coming
of the frenchmen. Tidings (...) to the host to the constable / that the
englysshmen were ridynge abroad: but no man could tell where they were. Than
incontinent the constable for doubt of his men sent out another company of men
of arms / to be a countergarde to the foragers that were gone before for the
engyn. Of the which new company there were capitayns sir Peter of Mornay /
yuan of Wales / Thybault of Pount / and Alyotte of Calay. In that company there
was a two hundred men of arms well appointed / sir Peter of Bulle and his
company who were gone for the engyn / did so much that they came to Ryoll /
and there charged many chares with the engyn and so returned again toward the
host by another way (than as they came) and a more brother passage because of
their carriage. and so are they came to yuret or nere thereunto within a leage
they had a fair adventure / for there they met with the other company of
their own felowshy^ / and when they were all together they were a.vi. hundred
spears / than they rode at more leyser / thynking themself more insuerty than
they were before. than tydinges ca^e to sir Thom^s Phelton and to ye barons of
Gascoyn bring at yuret / how the frenchmen were abroad and were coming fro
Ryoll to pass that way toward Bergerath with a great engyn. Of the which
tydinges they were right ioyouse / and said: how it was the thing ye they
most desired. Than they armed them and mounted on their horses and made them
self ready / and when they were abroad in the field / it was not long after but
that they saw where the frenchmen were coming in good order / and a great
nombre. And as soon as each of them knew other reputing each other enemies /
desirynge to auance to fight in prouyng their horses / and couchyng their
spears and crieng their cries / they encountered each other. At the first
metyng there was a goodly iustes / and noble deeds of arms acheued / and many
a knight and squier ouet thrown to the etthe / by clean force of arms / in
such ^ylous points many a hard aue^ture falls. There Helyot of Calay a right
expert squter and a good man of arms / was stricken fro his horse and was
stryken in the throat with a tauelyn of Bordeaux / as sharp as a rasure / the
which stroke cut a sonder the veins of his neck and so he fell to the earth
/ and there dyed which was great damage / for by that adventure he ended his
time and days. There was a knight of Berrey or of Lymosyn / called sir Wyllm^
of Lignac / an expert man of arms and a valyant / who did the same day many
a valiant deed of arms.

How the englisshmen were over thrown / and the greattest lords of Gascon
taken / and how Bergerath turned and became french / and diverse other
towns and castles in those marches / by the army that the duke of Aniou made.
Cap. CCC.xx.
THis said encounter was well fought on both parts in a place called yuret /
nere to ye village. when their speres were broken / they drew their swerdes /
wherewith they fought right valia^tly. there was done many a noble feate of
arms / many prisoners taken and rescued again / and there was slain of the
english party / a knight of Gascone called the lord of Gernos and of Calais
/ and of the french part there was slain / Thybaulte du Pount. This battle
endured a long season and well fought / for there were many valyant men / the
which caused the batell to endure the longer but finally the englysshemen nor
ye gascons could not obtain the place The frenchmen conquered the victory by
clean force of arms / and there ser Wylliam of Lignac with his own hands
took prisoner / sir Thomas Phelton seneshall of Burdeux / there was also taken
the lord of Mucydent / the lord of Duras / the lord of Langurant / and the
lord Rosen / and in ye battle there were but a few that escaped / outher
english or gascoyns / but they were taken or slain. And such as sledde took
the way toward Bordeaux / and encountered the seneshall of Lands / sir Wylliam
Helmen the mayre of Bordeaux / and sir Johan of Multon with a hundred spears /
who wers ^^^myng to yuret / but when they herd tydinges of the loss of the
field / they returned again in all have to Bordeaux.

AFter this battle was clean done / and the prisoners put in save guard /
than they returned to Bergerath to the siege. The duke of Aniou was greatly
reioysed of those tidings / when he hard how his men had sped / and how
the flour of all Gascoyne of his enemies were taken prisoners and specially sir
Thomas Phelton / who had done him before many a great displeasure. He reputed
this adventure of more valor than.v. hundred thousand frankes. sir Peter of
Bulle and his company / at last returned and came again to the host before
Bergerath / and they were well received and brought to ye duke of Aniou / by
the constable / barons / and knights / and by their fre^des: and they reputed
this a noble and a profitable journey for them. The next morning the great
engyn was rered up against Bergerath as nere as might be / the which greatly
abashed them of the town. And so they took counsel toguyder and spoke with
their captain / for they saw well they could not long endure / nor they
could parceyue no manner of socoure coming to them ward. Consydering how sir
Thom^s Phelton their seneshall was taken and all the chiualry of Gascon / in
whom they should have had any trust. Sir Perducass said to the^. sirs: we are
strong enough to keep the town / and we have vitayle and artillary sufficyent
/ therefore let us make none evil merchandise. So the matter abode still in that
casetyll the next morning that they sowned in the host trumpettes to the
assawte / and the constable of France being in the field / or he would assail
the town / in exchewynge of hurtynge of his men / sent to speak with them of
Bergerathe and made to be showed to them / how he had all their capitayns
prisoners / by whom they should have any aid or socour / and how they were in
the case to become french / and to put themself and their lands under the
obeisance of the french king. And also he showed them / that if they were
assailed and taken by force / how all the town should be put to the fire:
and men / women / and children to ye sword / without any mercy. These words
abashed greatly them of Bergerath / and they desired to take counsel and so
they did / than the burgesses of the town went to counsel without calling of
their captain / and they agreed to become french / so they might live
peasably without having any men of war among them / the which was lightly
agreed to them. and when sir Perducas Dalbret their capiten herd of that
treaty / he mounted on his horse and made his men to pass over the bridge /
and so departed and went to the garyson of Moneyn and Bergerah yielded up to the
french part. And the constable of France took possessyon thereof / and set
therein a captain and men of war to keep it. When yt Bergerath was thus
turned french / the duke of Aniou was counsayled to go forth and to ley siege
to Chastellon on ye river of Dordone The tidings thereof spread abroad in the
field / and every man prepared to go thither: as the duke / the constable and
all other men of war: except the marshall of France who abode behind to
abide for the lord of Coucy / who came the same night. and the marshall rode
to mete him with a great company and received him right amyably / and so tarried
all that night in the same place / where as the duke had been the night before.
The duke ye same day came to a fair medowe in his way to Chastellon / on the
river of Dordon. And with ye lord of Coucy there was sir Edmond of Pomyers /
sir Tristram of Roy / the lord of Faignels / the lord of Jumont / sir John^
of Rosey / sir Robr^t of Cleremont / and diverse other knights and squyers. And
in the morning they depted fro their lodging and rode in the company of the
marshall of France / till they came to the dukes host / where they were
received with great joy going toward Chastellon / in a town called saint Foy
or the vowarde came to Chastello / and assailed the town of saint Foye right
feersly. Within the town there were no men of war / and so made but small
defense and would have yielded them up / and in their yelding they were all
pylled and robbed. So the siege was laid about Chastellon / and endured a.xv.
days there were many scrimysshes before the barryers / for within the town
were diverse englisshmen and gascoyns / such as fled fro the dysconfyture of
yuret / who right valiantly defended the town. And such lords of Gascone as
were taken prisoners before / were with ye duke of Aniou in his host / and did
asmoch as they might to cause the town to yield up to ye duke how beit sir
Thomas Phelton did nothing in the matter / because he was an englysshman. And
also he that took him prisoner sir John^ of Liguac had as than put him to his
ransom / to pay.xxx. M. frankes / and when the money (...) as paid he / was
d^lyuered but y^ was not so ^^^ne. So long these four barons of Gascone were
desired and ^ntysed to beco^e french / that at last they were content / and
made promise to y^ duke of An^ou by their faithes and honors to be ever good
frenche^ both themself and their lands. And so by that means the duke of
Aniou delivered them quyte and fre / and so departed ^ro the duke on that
promise. the lord of Du^as and the lord of Rosen / to thentent to go into
their own countries. And the lord of Lan^uras and the lord of Mu^y^ent abode
still in the host with the duke at their pleasur / and (...) and (...) daily

clean force of arms. Sirs quod the duke I believe you well: and If were by god
/ y^ when I deptehens / the first thing that I will do / shall be to ley siege
before ye to wne of Duras and next to ye town of Rosen. Thus the duke of
Aniowe abode still before the town of Chastellon right sore displeased / with
th^se two for said lords of Gascoyne. This town of Chastellon parteyned to ye
heritage of the Captall of Be^^^ whom the french king had in prison in Paris.
the siege thus enduryng before Thas^^^lon there fell a great famyn* another for
gold nor silver could be got any thing to live by / so y^ the frenchmen
were feign to ride a. (...). or.xv. miles to get any vitayle for the host /
and often times they returned again in great parell / for there were diverse
castelles and forteresses english on the fronters / the which issued out and
made busshmentes / and encountered them at streyghtes / and passages. and when
they saw they were strong enough for ye french foragers / they would set on
them / and hurt / and ^lee many of them / and take away their vitayls /
wherefore the frenchmen durst not ride but in great companyes. So long the
siege endured that they within were so co^stray ^^d / what with assawtes and
with engyns / that they were feign to yield them up / their lives and goods
saved. and so all the men of war within deperted with bag and baggage / and
went to saint Macayre / where there was a good town and a strong castle. When
Chastellon was yielded up / the duke of Aniou took possession thereof / and
faith and homage of the dwellers within the town / and there he set new
officers / and made captain there a knight of Thowrayn / called sir James
Mou^tmartyn. And when the duke departed thens / he took his advise whyder he
should draw / than he was counsayled to goo to saint Maryne / but in his way
there were diverse little forteresses which the duke thought not good to be
left be hynde him / bi^awse of his foragers / and so fyr^^ he laydsiege to
Sauueter / and than tidings came to the duke otherwise than he had hard
before of the lord Duras / and of the lord Ro^^^ it was said how surely they
were at Burdeau^ / but under what manner they could(...) as than know / which
words spra^^ (...) in the host / and so came to the herynge of the lord
Mucydent / and of the lord (...). Than they spoke to the lord of (...) and so
sir Peter of Bulle desirynge the^ to help to excuse the said lords: sayng how
it was a great symplenes to believe so lightly such fleyng words / and so they
promised to do * and so spoke to the duke thereof / and he answered and said /
he would be right glad to here and know the contrary of that he had hard
before. This (...) was before Sauueterre / which held but three days / for y^
captain yielded up the forter^^^e saving his life and all his / and their
goods. and so the duke passed forth and came to saint Basyll a good town /
which incontinent y^lded up / and put them self under the obeisance of the
french king. And than the duke went to Mountsegure / and at the first he gave
assaut and mist it: and so lodged for that night. And the next morning they
made them ready again to the assawte / whereof they within were abashed and went
to counsel / and finally concluded to yield up the town / their lives and
g^des saved / and so they were received. Than the duke rode farther / and came
to a closed town between saint Ma^ayre and the Ryoll / called Amberoche. There
the duke was four days (...) he could have it / and than by treaty it was
given up. And tha^ the duke went to saint (...).

How the duke of Aniou took by force saint Macayre / and the town of Duras by
assaute / and diverse other forteresses against the englisshmen. Cap. CCC.xxi.
Daily the dukes host multiplied and increased / for men came to him fro all
parts / as knights and squiers to auau^ce their bodies. So the siege was
layne before saint Macayre and within were all such men of war as were goone
out of such fortresses as had been yelden up before whereby the town was ye
stronger / and the better defended / there was diverse great assautes made / and
many a fair (...)ysshe before the barryers. Than the duke and the (...)
or^ayned the siege endurynge / that certain (...) with their companyes should
(...) in the (...) all (...). And so the men (...) arms sprad abroad. (...) y^
ma^shal^ of France with a great route / sir Percyuall of M^^^^ll norman / and
Wylliam of Moncontoure with a great company* (...) men of arms were a broad in
the feldes(...)ayes / and took dyuer^ towns and small holds / and brought the
cou^^^e all about / under the obeisance of the french king. there were none
that withstode them for the country was void / and unprovided of men of war
of thenglysshe part / and they yt s^edde went to Burd^ur. And than these men of
war^ returned again to ye host / they of saint Macayre knew well / how they
could not long (...)dure / and it was daily showed the^ / that if they were
taken by force they should all dye without mercy / whereof they douted. And the
commons secretly treated with ye frenchmen to yield up the town their lives and
goods saved. The me^ of war within parceyuing well their ententes douted
greatly the commons / yt they should make some yuell bargayne for them. Wherefore
they brue the^ to the castle / which was right strong and able to be kept /
and therein they put all yt they had / and some pyllage of the town: than they
of the town, yielded up / and put the^ self under the o^eysance of the french
king. Tidings ca^e to the duke while he lay at siege before Moutsegu^e / how
that ye duches his wife was at Tho^ouse / and was there delivered of a son /
whereof the duke and all his host was right ioyouse / (...) were of the more
hardynes / to atempt deeds (...) arms. As Soon as saint Ma^ayre was given ^p /
the duke entered and all his / and eased and refresshed the^ / for in the town
was good loging and well furnysshed. and so ye castle was h^s^ged and ^^gy^s
^eysed before it the which did (...) (...)ylous great stones of iron / which
great (...) (...)head the^ within. And thus while y^ duke (...) at this siege
true tidings ca^e to him of the (...) Duras and of the lord Rosen / brought
by (...) haraudes / and that was ^^^ely how they were ^^the become english
again. Than y^ duke said / let us make an end here and than I will go and lay
siege before Duras / and so made a ^^irse assaut to the castle / for he would
not ^eau^ it be ^^nd him. And they of y^ castle saw how they were a^^ailed on
all sides and codde (...) no ^onfort / and saw well how the duke nor the
ca^^^able would not deperte thens till they had y^ castle at their will o^ther
with fayrnesse or fou^nesse. So all thing co^sydred / they fell in (...)
yielded up the castle / their lives and goods (...)* and they were received
and coueyed to (...) (...) And so (...) Macayres town and (...) was become
french / and therein the duke made new capitayns / and than disloged and took
ye way toward Duras / and so long he rode that he came before Duras. And at
the first aprochyng the duke ordained to assail the town / and every man
prepared for the saut / and the crosbowes before well pauessed. And so they
aproched to the town / and some had ladders ready to mount / there began a sore
and a cruel assaut and such as mounced / fought hand to hand with the^
within. This assaut endured a long space / on the ladders there were done many
feats of arms / as in fighting hand to hand. This assaut endured the most
part of the day than at last the trumpettes sowned the retreat / and so every
man drew to his logyng for that night. The same time there came to the host /
sir Alayne de la Hay / and sir Alayne of saint Poule / and with them a great
company of bretons / who had ryden toward Lyburne / and had assailed an
english garyson / named Cadyllac / the which they had taken byforce / and
slain all them within. In the morning / the duke of Aniou commanded every
man to go to the assaut: desyringe them to do their best / and by a haralude
made to be cried through the host / who soever entered first in to Duras /
should have in reward / five hundred frankes. For couytousnesse of wynning of
this reward / many a one auaunced and icoperded themself / so there were many
ladders anon reared up against the walls. There was a feirse assaute / for
the young knights and squyers desyring to auau^ce their bodies / adue^tured
them self right valiantly. The lord of Langurant was mounted upon a ladder /
his sword in his hand one of the first / and payned him self much to have
entered first into the town / not for wynning of the five hundred fra^kes / but
to exalt his name: for he was sore displeased with ye lord of Duras / because
he was turned so lightly english again. The lord Langurant did that day
marueyls in arms / so that his own men / and also strangers had marueyle of
his deeds. He auau^ced himself so much forward / that he put his life in
great ieopardy. For they within by clean force rased the helm of his heed /
and so had been deed without remedy and a squire of his had not ben / who
followed him so nere that he rouered him with his targe. And the lord and he
together descended down the ladder little and little / and in their dyscendyng
they received on ye targe many a great stroke. they were greatly praised of all
that saw them. Also there was sir Trystram of Roy / and sir Percyuall Daneuall
on another ladder / assayling and sautyng right valiantly. In like wise did sir
John^ Jumont and sir John^ of Rosey / each of them doing marueyls in arms /
and at another lope of the wall on a ladder / there was the lord of Sereell /
and fought hand to hand with his enemies / so that every man that saw him
said / if there were any likely to enter in to the town / he was semyng to be
the first. The knight did not adventure him self all only for the profit /
but rather to get honor: but the fortunes of war be right peryllous / and
so it happed to him / for he was put down feersly with a glayue / so that he
fell down to the botome of the dyke / and with the fall brake his neck / and
there he dyed. And in like case dyed an other squire of Bretayne / who bare in
his arms: goules / two cheurons chekard: gold / silver / and asure: of whose
death the constable was sore displeased. Than the assaut began to be fiersar on
every part / the lord of Mucyde^t proved that day a good knight / and showed
well by his deeds how he was a true french man. So thus byforce the town of
Duras was conquered / and the first that entered was sir Trystram of Roy and sir
John^ of Rosey: than the men of war within the town fled in to the castle.

How yuan of wales laid siege to Mortayne / and how the scotts took by
stelthe the castle of Berwyke: against the will of the king of England. Cap.
CCC.xxii.
THus the town of Duras was taken and all slain that were within / than the
men of war took their logyng / and unarmed them and took their ease. the next
morning the constable of France mounted on his horse and the marshall of
France with him / and went and aduysed well the castle / and took good head on
what side it were most best to assail it. And all things consydred / they
saw well the castle was right strong and hard to win / without long siege:
and so they returned and showed this to the duke of Aniou. It makes no matter
quod the duke / for I have said and sworn that I will not depart hens / till
I have the castle at my will. Than the constable answered. Sir / with gods
grace / yeshall not beforsworne. Than they reared up all their engyns against
the castle / and when they within saw the dealyng of the^ in the town and of
the frenchmen / consydering how the assautynge should be right perylous for
them. Than they thought to fall entreaty / and so entreated with the constable
to take them to mercy / their lives and goods saved / and so to yield up the
castle. The duke of Anio we took counsel / and by the advise of the
constable / who would not by his will travail any more his people. The third
day received the^ to mercy / and so they departed and were brought thither as
they would be / and so the constable took possession of the castle / but as I
was enfourmed: the duke of Aniou commanded / that the castle should be beten
down. and so after ye conquest of the castle and town of Duras / the duke of
Aniou ordained to abide there: sir Johan of Jumont / sir Tristram of Roye and
sir Johan of Rosey with a hundred spears / to keep there the fronters against
Burdelois. and the duke thought to return to Toulouse / to se the good lady
his wife who was as tha^ newly churched of a fair son. and he thought at her
churchyng to keep a great feast at Toulouse / and he ordained in all such
towns as he had conquered men of war / and garysons to resyst pusantly
against his enemies: and said to yuan of Wales. Sir: yeshall take in your
charge / bretons poicteuyns / and angeuyns: and yeshall go in to Poictou and
ley siege to Mortaigne / on the sea which the lord of Lestrade keeps / and
come not thens for no manner of commandment fro the king or fro any other /
tyllsuch season as ye have ye full possession thereof / for it is a garyson that
has done much trouble to us. sir: quod yuan to the best of my power / I shall
do your commandment. Than the duke ordained and appointed all them that should
go with yuan in to Poyctou / and so they departed fro the duke to the nombre of
five hundred spears and took the way in to Xaynton / to goo toward saint
John^s Dangle. And the duke / the constable / the lord of Coucy / the marshall
of France / and sir Johan and sir Peter of Bulle / returned back to Toulouse
/ and there found the duches newly puryfied / at which time there was made great
feast and iustyng. than after the constable and the lord Coucy returned into
France / and the marshall of Sanxere went in to Auuergne to aid the barons /
such as made war against the englysshmen / who were in Limosyn / in Auuergne
and on the frontres there. How let us show how yuan of Wales laid siege the
same season before Mortayne / and how he constrained them within the garyson.

THis yuan of Wales was gladd to obey the commandment of the duke of Aniou /
for he knew well what soever the duke did / it was the pleasure of the king.
And also he knew well that the king bare all the charges of his enterprises:
and so came in to Xayntes in Poitou / and there refresshed them in that
plentyfull country. And in his company was the lord of Pouns / the lord of
Thouars / the lord of Umaroyse / the lord Jaques of Surgeres / and great
no^bre of knights and squyers of Poictou. And of the bretons and normans /
there were capitayns / sir Mores of Trysiqdy sir Alayne Housey / sir Alayne of
saint Poule / sir Percyuall Daneuall / Wylliam of Mountcomptor / and the lord
of Momorette his brother. These men of war departed when they were ready / and
went and laid siege before Mortayne / which was the fairest and strongest
castle standing on the river of Garon / and nere to the mouth of the sea.
Thus yuan and his company laid siege before Mortaigne / and made bastydes
little and little / and prepared for all things necessary / for they knew
well by assaut they should never win the castle / nor by no way: saving by
long siege and by famyne. There yuan ordained four bastydes about the castle /
so that none could reuitayle the town / another by land nor by see. And ye
young knights and squyers / desiryng to auaunce their bodies / went often times
to the barryers of ye castle and scrimysshed with the^ within / and they with
the^. And so between them there was done many a proper feate of arms. Within
the castle there was a knight called the Souldiche / who was a gascoyn a right
valyant knight / and a good man of arms / by whose counsel they within were
ruled / as much as by their capitayns. Wine and vitayls they had within
sufficyent / but of other small necessaries they had great scarcyte during the
siege. King Charles of France though he held himself at Paris / and sported
him at his pleasur without armyng of his own person. yet he kept war in
diverse places against the^glisshmen his enemies and gatte him alyaunces / as
well within the realm / as in any other country about / more than any of his
predecessors / of four or five kings had before. And greatly he held them
in love / such as he thought to have any aid by. And because he saw well
king Richard of England was but young and the realm in trouble and discord.
Therefore he sent in to Scotland diverse times / both to king Robert and to
king Dauyd his uncle / always to entertayne them in love. Desyring the^ ever
to make good and sharp war on thenglysshmen / and so to traueyle them / that
they should have no puissaunce to pass over the sea. In so much / so it happed
that king Robert of Scotland / the same season that king Edward ye third
was deed / and king Richard crowned: he assembled his counsel at Edenborowe
in Scotla^de where as were the most part of all the barons and knights of
Scotland and of other / such as he thought should do him service / showing
them how thenglysshmen in time past / had done them many great
inconuenyences as in brennynge of their countries / beatynge down their
castles / stayeng and raunsomyng their men / saying also. Sirs: now is ye time
come that we may be well revenged / for no we there is but a young king in
England / for king Edward is deed / who was wont to have so good fortune.
Than the barownes and young knights that were there / such as desired to be
reue^ged of the damage done to them by the^glysshmen / answered all with one
voice how they were all ready apparelled to ride in to England / and it were
the same day or the next / or when it pleased him. This answer pleased
greatly the king of Scotes and thanked them all / and there the king ordained
four earls / to be as chief capitayns of all the men of war. And that was the
earl Duglas / the earl Moret therle of Maure / and the earl of Surlant / and
the constable of Scotland sir Archambalt Duglas / and the marshall of the
host / sir Robert Uersy. And so they made their somons to be at a certain day
at Morlane / and in the making of this assemble / there departed fro them a
valiantsquier of Scotland called Alysander Ramsey / who thought to enter prise
to acheue a great feate of arms / and took with him forty well mounted / and
rode so long by night privily that by the day in the morning he came to Berwyke
which was englisshe / and capitayn of the town was a squire of the earl of
Northumberlandes / named Johan Byset: and in the castle was captain a
valyant knight / called sir Robert Abenton. When the scotes were come to
Berwyke / they kept the^ self privy and sent a spy to the town and to the
castle / to se in what co^dicyon it was / the spy entered down in to the
dykes / where there was no water nor none could abide there / for it was all a
quycke boylyng sand. And so the spy looked and harkened all about / but he
could not here nor se no creature / and so he returned and showed all that to
his master. Than Alysander Ramsey auaunsed for the / and brought all his
company privily into the dykes / and had with them ladders / and so dressed
them up to the walls. Alysander was one of the first ye mounted up with his
sword in his hand / and so entered in to the castle / and all his company
followed him / for there was none that withstode the^. And when they were all
within / than they went to ye chief tower / where as the captain was a sleep /
and so there suddenly with great axes they brake up the door. The captain
suddenly awoke and had slept all night / and had made but small watch the which
he derely bought. And so opened his chamber door / wenyng to him the noise had
be made by some of his own soudiers that would have robbed or murdered him in
his bed / because he had displeased them the weke before / and so lept out of
a wyndowe down into the dykes in great fear / without order or good advise /
so that with the fall he brake his neck and there he dyed. The watchmen were
half a sleep and herd the noise and woke / and parceyued well how the
castle was scaled and betrayed / and so sowned in a trumpet trahey / trahey.
Johan Byset captain of ye town / hearing the voice of a trumpe armed him /
and caused all them of the town to be armed / and so drew all before the
castle / and herd well the noise that the scotts made within / but they
could not enter in / for the gate was shytte and the bridge drawn. Than the
captain Johan Byset remembered him of a great aduyce / and said to them of the
town / that were about him: Let us break down the stays of the brige on
this side / and than they within can not issue without our danger. Inco^tynent
with axes they beat down ye bridge and stays thereof toward the town. And
than John^ Byset sent a messanger to Anwyke a.xii. little miles thens to the
lord Percy / certifyeng him of all ye matter. desyring him to come without
delay with some great puyssaunce / to rescue again the castle of Berwyke / so
taken by stelthe by the scotts. And moreover Johan Bysette said to Thomelyn
Fryant / who was the messanger / she we to my lord in what case ye leave us /
and how the scotts are closed within the castle and can not issue out /
without they leap over the walls: and therefore desire him to make the more
have. Alysander Ramsey and his company / who had thus scaled the castle of
Berwike / and thought they had done a great enterprice / and so they had don in
deed and Johan Byset had not provided asodayne remedy: for else they had been
also lords of the town. And so they slew of them within the rastell whom
it pleased them and the resydne they took prisoners / and shytte them up fast
in a tower. Than they said: now let us go down in to the town for it is ours
/ and let us take all the good therein and the rich men of ye town / and
bring them all in to this castle / and tha^^sette fire on the town: for it
is not to be kept by us. And within three or four days we shall have rescue
out of Scotland / so that we shall save all our pyllage / and at our departing
/ let us set fire in the castle / and so pay our host. To which purpose
they all agreed / for they desired all to win some pyllage. And so they took
each of them a glayue in their hands / they found ynowe in the castle / and
so opened the gate and let down the bridge. And when the bridge was down /
the ropes ye held it brake asondre / for the restyng place of the brige was
broken away toward the town. And when Johan Byset saw the manner of them /
than he and all his company began to shoute and cry / and said. Asirs / keep
you there: ye shall not depart thens without our leave. and when Alysander
Ramsey saw the manner of them without. Than he saw and knew well / how they
were aduysed of his being in the castle / and so closed again the gate for
fear of shot / and fortifyed the castle / thinking to have kept it / and
did cast out in to the dykes all the deed me^ and put up in to a tower all
their prisoners. They thought the place was strong enough to keep long / or at
leest till some rescue might come to them out of Scotland / for the barons and
knights of Scotland were assemblyng together at Morlane and there about / and
also therle Duglas was departed fro Alquest / and was come to Dombare.

Now let us speak of the squier sent by Johan Byset to Anwyke / to the lord
Percy earl of Northumberlande / signyfieng him all this said adventure.

How the earl of Northu^berlande wan again the castle of Berwike / and how
he entered puyssantly in to Scotland. Cap. C C C.xxiii.
SO long rode Thomelyn Fryant that he ca^e to Anwyke early in the morning /
and the lord Percy / was as than in his bed. Nevertheless he did so much
that he spoke with him / for his business had have / and said. Sir: the
scotts has this morning taken by stelth the castle of Berwyke. And sir the
captain of the town has sent me hyder to you / to give you knowledge
thereof / seeing ye be warden of all this country. When the earl herd those
tidings he made have as much as he might / to conforte them of Berwike / and
sent out letters and messangers over all the country to knights squyers and
other to come to Berwike inco^tyne^t / to help and aid him against the
scotts / who had taken by stelth the castle of Berwyke. Anon this was
known through the country / and so every man departed fro their own houses
knights / squiers / archers / and crosbowes. And to Anwyke came the lord
Neuyll / the lord Lucy / ye lord of Blelles / ye lord of Graystoke / the
lord stafforde / the captain of Newcastell / and a right valyant knight
called sir Thom^s Mosgraue. And so first came to Berwyke the earl of
Northumberlande / and every day people came thither to him / so that he was a
ten thousandemen / or there about. and than besieged the castle so nere /
that a bird could not come out without knowledge. And than they began to
mine under the castle / the sooner to come to their ententes of the scotts /
and to win again the castle. Than tidings came to the barownes of
Scotland / how the earl / barownes / knights / and squiers / of
Northumberlande / habde besieged their company in the castle of Berwike. And
so they were all determined to go and reyse up the siege / and to refresshe and
vitayle the castle / and they all said: how Alysaunder Ramseys enterprice /
was valyauntly atempted. And sir Archambault Duglas constable of Scotland /
said. Alysaunder is my cosyn: it comes of a noble gentle heart / to
enterprise such a feate / as for to win the castle of Berwyke / and we
ought all greatly to comfort and help him in his deed. And if we may (...) the
siege, it shall turn to our great nobleness wherefore let us go thither. And
there they ordained who should go with him and who should bide. And so he took
with him five hundred spears of the best of all the host: and so they rode
for the toward Berwyke. Tidings came to the english lords at Berwyke / how
the scotts were coming to reyse their siege and to reuitayle the castle.
Than they went to counsel / and so determined to take a place and to abide
their enemies and to fight with them / it was all their desire. and so the
lord Percy caused all his company to be ready armed and aparelled to fight /
and to make their musters. and so they found them self to the nombre of three
thousand men of arms / and seuyn thousand archers. And when the erlesawe
that he had so great a nombre he said / let us keep our place we are men
enough to fight with all the puyssaunce of Scotland. And so they abode in a
fair plain without Berwike / in two batails in good order. And they had not
been there the space of an hour / but that they saw certain currours of the
scotts well horsed / ridynge to advise thenglisshe host. There were certain
knights and squyers would gladly have ryden to them to have scrimysshed with
them / but the lord Percy would not suffer them: but said let their hole
bataile come / for if they will fight with us they will aproche nerer to us. So
the englysshmen kept them self still close together and the scotts came so
nere them / that they aduysed well their two batayls / and the nombre of their
people. And when these currours had well aduysed the dealyng of the englysshmen
/ than they returned to their masters / and showed them all that they had
seen / and said. sirs / we have ryden so nere to the english host / yt we
have well aduysed all their behauyng / and sirs / we say unto you: they be ready
abidyng for you in two fair batails in a fair plain / and in every battle
a.v. thousand men. Therefore now take good advise / we aproched them so nere
that they perceived well how we were currours of Scotland / but they would
not stir nor send out one man to rynne at us. When sir Archambalt Duglas and
the knights of Scotland herd that tidings they were pensive / and said / we
can not se that it should be for our profit to ride as now against the
englysshemen for they are ten against one of us and all chosen men wherefore we
may lose more than wyn / and of a folysshe en^price comes no good / as it
proves now by Alysander Ramsey / and there was an uncle of Alysanders / called
sir Wyllyam Lindsey / who did great pain to confort his nephue. Saying /
sirs: on the trust of you my nephue has made this enterprice / and taken the
castle of Berwike. It will turn you all to great blame if ye lose him thus /
and paraduentur herafter / there is none that will be so hasty to inpart such
another case. They than answered and said: they could not amend it / nor it
was not behouefull that so many noblemen as was there / should put them self in
adventure to be lost / for the rescuynge of one squire. And than they
determined to return again into their own country / and lodge on the
mountayns beside the river of Twyde / and so they withdrue thither at good
layser. And when the earl of Northumberlande / and the earl of Notyngham / and
the other barons of England parceyued that the scotts came not forward /
they sent forth their currours to know where they were beco^e / and they
brought wordehow they were gone toward Morlan / beyond the castle of Ros
bourge. And than against night the englysshmen drew again to their logynges
and made good watch that night / and in the morning every man was ready
aparelled to go and assail the castle / and so there was a ferse assaute /
which endured almoost all the day. ye never se more hardyer men of so few /
than the scotts were / nor that better defended a place than they did. For
the englysshmen had ladders / which they reared up to the walls / and the
englysshmen mounted up on them with targes before them / and so came and fought
with the scotts hand to hand / and some of the^ cast down into the dikes.
And that thing ye most troubled the scotts was the archers / who shot so holy
toguyder / that almoost there was none durst come to the defense of the wall. So
long this assaut continued / that at last the englysshmen entered in byforce /
and there slew as many as they found / not one of all them that were within
that escaped / but all were slain: except Alysander Ramsay / who was taken
prisoner. Thus the castle of Berwyke was delivered fro the scotts: and the
erlemade Johan Byset captain there / and he newly repaired the castle and
made the bridge new again that was taken.

How the earl of Northu^berlande and the earl of Notyngham / and the other
englisshmen entered with great puyssaunce in to the realm of Scotland. Cap.
CCC.xxiiii.
AFter the wynning again of the castle of Berwyke the earls of Northumberland
and Notyngham / which were two of the greatest men in all the englyssh host /
wha^ they had assembled all their men together / they determined to ride after
their enemies / and if they could find them to fight with them. And so early
in a morning they departed / and took the way toward Rosebourge / a long by
the river of Twyde. And when they had ryden together ye space of two leages /
than they took new counsel / and so divided their company / and sent one
part toward Mauros a great abbey of black monks / by the river of Aude / the
which was the departure of both realms / to thente^t to se or know if they
might find any scotts there. And the other part of their company rode
toward Morlane / thinking y^ by one of these two ways they should here some
tidings of the scotts. and of the company that rode to Mauros was captain /
sir Thomas Mosegraue / and with him three hundred spears / and as many archers.
And so thus they departed / the one ridyng on ye right hand and the other on
the left hand / and sir Thom^s Mosegraue and his son rode so long / that
they came to Mauros / and there took their lodgyng at a good hour / to refreshe
them self and their horses. and to know justly where the scotts were become /
they sent forth two squyers well horsed / and such as knew the country / to
se if they could here any tidings of the^. These two squiers when they were
departed fro their masters rode so long that suddenly they were in a busshment
of the scotts / of whom sir Wyllyam Lyndsey was chief / and was at adventure
to se if he could here any tidings of Berwike and how his nephue Alysander
Ramsay had spedde in ye castle of Berwyke / or to here some tidings of
thenglysshmen. He had in his company a.xl. spears. As Soon as these two
squyers were entered within their busshement / they were suddenly beset round
about and so taken / whereof the knight had great joy / and demanded of them
fro whens they came / and so they were in tear to speak / and loath to dyscouer
the deeds of their maystres / but it behooved them to speak / for the knight
said: they should lease their heedes / if they told him not the troth of
every thing / that he would demand of them. And when they saw there was none
other remedy they spoke / and showed how the castle of Berwyke was won
again / and all that were within slain / except Alysa^der Ramsay. And how
therle of Northumberlande and the earl of Notyngham / were ryden a long by the
river of Twyde to find the scotts / and how sir Thom^s Mosegraue and his
son / sir John^ Asheton / and sir Richard Beton / with three hundred spears
and as many archers / were lodged and tarried at the abbey of Mauros / and also
how they were sent to know justly where the scotts were. By my faith quod
sir Wylliam of Lyndsay / ye have now found us / howbeit ye shall tarry with us
/ than they were delivered to besauely kept fro startyng away. And sir Wylliam
of Lindsey called a man of arms to him / and said. Go your way and ride to our
host / and show them all that ye have hard of the englisshmen / and I woll
abide here still till it be night to se if I can here any more tidings. And
so this messanger rode forth / till he came to a great village beyond Morlan /
called Ho^dbray on the river of Twyde / among the mou^tayns / where there was
fair meadows and a good country / wherefore the scotts tarried there In the
euenyng thither ca^e the squier / and found there the earl Duglas / the earl
Morette / therle of Surlant / and sir Archambalt Duglas / and the other
scotts. than the squire was brought to these lords / to whom he showed all
the matter (as ye have herd before) and when the scotts understood how ye
castle of Berwike was conquered again they were sore dyspleased / and
sorrowful / how be it they were recomforted again / when they herd how sir
Thom^s Mosgraue and his son / and other knights and squiers of England were
lodged at Mauros. than they determined to go thither and dislodge their enemies /
and to assay if they could recover any part of their damage / and so they
mounted and departed fro Hondbray / and rode toward Mauros on the right hand
/ for they knew well the country. And so they had come thither before mydnight
/ but that there fell such a rain and wind / the which struck them so in the
faces / that the proudest of them was so beaten with rain and wind / that
they co^de scant sit on their horses. and their pages what (...) and we^e (...)
^at ^^re their may ^^ers spears but let them fall / and so brake every man
fro other / and lost their way. Than the chief capitaynes rested privily
under a great wood side / and such k^yghtes as were sage and wise said how
they rode but folyshly / for it was no good season at that time to ride /
say^ng: how they might rather lose thereby than wyn^^. So they tarried and
covered them and their horses under the trees / till the day began to a^ere *
and such as were were and cold / made fyers to warm them / but or they
could make any ^yre they endured much pain / for y^ wod was gr^ne and the
ground wete. This rain and wether endured till the son rose / tha^ the
wether ^^^an to clear up / and the son shone * and the ^arkes began to sing.
Than these cap^tayns drew to gyder to take counsayll what they shu(...) do /
for they had failed of their en^^nt as to coe to Maurose by night time / than
it was thought b^st yt they should there refresh them se^^^ and their horses /
and to send out abr^^^ th^^^ foragers / and so they did. and they rode abroad
in to villages there beside / and so brought to their companyes hay and hotes
/ for their horses / and vitayle for their masters. The same morning the
englisshmen that lay at Mauros sent out their foragers / so that they and the
^^ottysshe foragers encountered each other / but there the englisshmen had
none advantage for there were diverse of them slain and hurt (...)e of them
lost. so that tidings (...) o^ ^ame to sir Thom^s Mosegraue and to the^ that
were at Mauros / whereby they knew that the scotts were not far fro them.
Than they founed their trompettes and sadled their horses / and armed them /
and so determined to take the ^^^de / and so they did. And anon the scotts
knew thereof by their foragers than they made halte to refresshe their horses /
and so armed them / and set them in good order of battle (...)r covert a
long by ye wode side. they were a (...) hundred spears / and two thousand or
other called yomen with glay^es / dagers / and other wepyns of war. than sir
Ar(...) Duglas / and the earl Duglas said / (...) can be none otherwise / but
y^ we shall have (...) do for y^ englisshmen rydeth this morning / therefore let
us be ready / and let us ^yght with them if we se time conuenyent. and so they
(...) out a certain men of arms to ^yscouer their enemies / and ^aryed the^
self still in their (...).

How sir Thomas Mosegraue and the englisshmen were discomfytted by the
scotts. And of the death of the french queen. Cap. CCC.xxv.
SIr Thomas Mosegraue and his son and the englisshemen / who desired greatly
to find ye scotts / departed fro Mauros / and took the way toward Morlane
/ and left the river of Twyde on their left hands / and went up a mountain
called saint Gylle / and there were the scotyshe currours / who right well
aduysed the englisshmen / and so returned to their company and showed them all
the dealing of the englisshmen / and how to their estimacyon they were not
past three baners / and.x. penons. of the which tydinges the scotts were right
joyful / and said all with one will: let us go and ride to them / in the name
of god and saint Gylle for they are all ours / than they cried all one cry
Duglas saint Gylle. And they had not ryden the space of half a leage / but
they saw their enemies / and the englisshmen them. Tha^ each party saw well
how it behooved them to fight. And so ye earl Duglas made his son knight /
called sir James / and made him to reyse his baner / and in like wise so he
did two sons of the king of scotts / sir Robert and sir Dauyd / and both
raised their baners. and there was made a.xxx. knights on the Scottysshe part
/ and a knight of Suede / called sir George of Besmede / who bare in his arms
silver / a myll pyn / gowles / a border endented gowles. Also sir Thomas
Mosegraue made his son Thomas knight / and diverse other of his house in like
wise so did the lord Stafforde and the lord Gascope / and so they ordered their
archers and set them on the wynge / and thenglisshmen cried that day our lady
of Arleton. There began a ferse recounter / and archers began to shote / and
men of arms began to stir. The scotts were so great a nombre / that y^
archers could not take heed in every place / there was between the perties
many a goodly course of a^mes / and many a man overthrown to the earth diverse
taken and reskewed again at the beginning. Sir Archambalt Duglas was a mighty
knight and a ^ygge / and sore feared of his enemies / when it came to the
aprochynge he light a foot / and had in his hands a long swerd / whereof the
blade was two else of length it was to heavy for any other man lightly to lift up
fro ye earth / but for him it was light enough and he gave therewith such
strokes / yt whom so ever he hytte full / went to the earth: so that there
was not the hardiest there / of the englissh part / but that refused his
strokes. There was a sore battle and well fought / as long as hi^ endured /
but that was not long / for the scotts were three against one. I say not nay:
but that the englisshmen bare them self right valyantly / how beit finally
they were dyscomfytted / and sir Thomas Mosegraue taken prisoner / and his
son also: and diverse other knights and squyers / so that the scotts had a
six score of good prisoners / and the chase endured to the river of Twyde /
and diverse were slain. After this disco^fytur / the scotts drew into their
own country / and determined to go to E^enbourge / for they knew by their
prisoners that the earl of Northu^berlande / and therle of Notyngham were in
the country / by the river of Twyde in the way toward Roseburge / and how
they were men ynowe / to fight with the power of Scotland for a day /
wherefore they thought they might well br^ke up their army / and to draw in to
save guard to keep their prisoners. they took a better advise to draw homward
/ for if they had gone again to their ^lde lodging / they had been in a great
adventure to have been beaten / as I shall show you how.

THe earl of Northumberlande / and the earl of Notyngham / and the ba^ones of
England / when they departed fro Berwyke / and sir Thomas Mosegraue departed
fro them / they had knowledge by their spies / that the scotts were lodged at
Ho^dbray / whereof they were right ioyouse / and so determined to come on them
in the night / and s^rymysshe with them. and so they came thither ye same night
that they were departed in the morning / but it rayned so sore that they
could not attain to their entreprise / and so lay in the woods till ^he
morning / than they sent out their spies to know where the scotts were
become / and they brought word again how ^he scotts were departed and how
they could find none. Tha^ they drue toward Mauros to here some ty^ynges of
sir Thomas Mosegraue / and sent a long the river currours to s^ if they could
here any tidings of the scotts. After the ^isco^^s^ture of the field saint
Gylle / as ye have hard before the currorrs met with some of their own
company sleynge as falt as they might / and so they showed all that ever they
knew of the battle / and the currous returned / and had with them such as
they met slyeng / and so told all the certaynte of the battle / but they
could not tell how many were slain / nor how many were taken. When the
englissh lords herd these tidings / they were than more pensive than before
/ and good cause why. They were dyspleased for two causes: one because they
had lost their men / y^ other because they could not find the scotts / whom
they desired so sore to fight withal. so they would feign have followed but
they wist not what way the scotts were gone / and night drew on. than they
went to Mauros and lodged there / and incontinent true word ca^e to them of
the battle / and how sir Thom^s Mosgraue and his son^e / and sirscoremen of
arms with them were taken prisoners and the scotts led them to Ede^borowe.
Than thenglisshe lords saw well yt it behooved them to bear this damage as for
that present time / because they could not amend it / so they passed that
night as well as they might / and in the morning they dysloged / and the lord
Percy earl of Northumberlande / gave leave to every man to depart home / and he
went into his own country. Thus brake up that journey / and part of the
scotts went to Edenbourg^ and therle Duglas and his son^e abode still on the
way to Alquest. And great tidings ran over all Scotland / of the journey that
their men had made / and so knights and squiers took their pleasure with their
prisoners / and raunsomed them curtesly as they list.

Now let us leave to speak of Scotland for this present time / and let
us speak of other insydentes that fell in France.
The same time in the monethe of February the french queen dyed / and as the
p^ysicyons said through her own fault / for she lay in child bed of a fair
lady named ^ateryne / who was after duches of Berrey / the qwene being in
chyldbed was not well at ease / and her physicions had defended her in any wise
that she shul^e* not enter in to no bayne / for they said it was contrary to
her dissease / and right perylus for her / All that not withstandyng she would
needs be bayned / and so she was and so fell sycker and dyed. And so king
Charles of France was a wydower for he never married after.

How the war began again bitwene the naueroyse and the frenchemen / and of
the beginning of the cisme of holy church. Ca. CCC.xxvi.
AFter the death of the french queen / dyed also the qwene of Nauer / suster
germayne to the french king. And after the death of this qwene of Nauer / great
murmuryng rose between the sagemen and customyers of the county of Uire /
which is in Normandy / the which by right succession of their mother should
^all to the king of Nauers children who were as than within age / and under the
rule and keeping of their uncle / king Charles of France. and king Charles of
Nauer was had in such suspect before time in that he had made / and consented
and raised so many euilles and inco^uenyences in the realm of France / that
he was not worthy to hold any heritage in the realm of France / under the
shadow of his children. The same season there came out of Acquitayne ye
constable of France / who had been all that season with the duke of Aniou.
and brought with him in his company the lord Mucydent of Gascon / to se the
king / and to be acquaynted with him / and so he did. Between the king and the
constable there was many secret cou^sayls / of the state of the realm of
France and of Nauer / which was not suddenly known we shall shortly speak of
yt matter. But justly to cronycle all matters that fell in the same season in
the world / I shall show you of the beginning of the pestylence and
inconuenyens / that began in the church of god / whereby all christendom was
in great trouble and varyance: and thereby many great mischefes grew and
followed.

yE have hard here before / how pope Gregory the.xi. of that name / was in
the city of Auygnon / and when he saw that he could find no manner of peace
to be had bitwene the kings of England and France / wherewith he was in great
dyspleasure / for he had greatly traveled there about / and had made his
cardynalles to do the same. Than he aduysed him self / and had a devotion to
go and reuyset Rome and the sea apostolyke / the which saint Peter and saint
Poule had edefyed. He had made before promise / that if ever he came to the
degree to be pope / he would never keep his see / but there as saint Peter kept
his and ordained it. This pope was a man of feeble complexion and sickly / and
endured much pain more than any other. And he thus being in Auignon, was so
sore let with the besynesses of France / and so sore traueyled with the king
and his brethern / that with much pain he had any leyser to take heed any
thing to him self / or to his church. Than he said to him self / he would go
farther of fro them to be at more rest / and so he caused prouysyon to be made
on the river of Gennes / and all the ways as he should pass / as it apertayned
to such an high astate as he was / and than he said to his cardynals. Sirs:
make you ready for I woll to Rome / of that mocyon his cardynalles were sore
abashed and displeased / for they loved not the romans / and so they would
feign have turned his purpose / but they could not. And when the french king
knew thereof, he was sore displeased / for he thought he had the pope nerer
at hand there / than in any other place. than the king wrote inco^tynent to
his brother the duke of Aniowe who was at Toulouse / signyfieng him that after
the sight of his letters / he should go to Auignon to the pope / and break his
voyage to Rome if it were possible. The duke did as the king commanded him /
and so came to Auignon / where the cardynalles received him with great joy / and
so was lodged in the popes palace the ofter thereby to speak with the pope ye
may well know he spoke with the pope and showed him diverse reasons to have
broken his purpose / but the pope would in no wise consent thereto / nor take
any head of any besinesses on this side the mou^tayns. But the pope gave the
duke full puyssance to do what he might / reseruyng certain cases papal / the
which he might not give to no man / nor put them out of his own hands. When
ye duke saw he could not come to his intent / for no reason nor fair words
that he could show / he took leave of the pope / and said at his departing.
Holy father ye go into a good country among such people where as ye be but
little beloved / and ye woll leave the fou^tayne of faith and the realm / where
as holy church has most faith and exellence of all the world / and sir by
your deed the church may fall in great trybulacion / for if ye dye there the
which is right likely / and so say the phisycions. Than the romans who be
malycious and traitors shall be lords and masters of all the cardynalles / and
shall make a pope at their own will / how beit for all these words and many
other / the pope never rested till he was on his way / and so came to Marcyll
where as the galeys of Ge^nes were ready to receive him / and the duke returned
again to Toulouse. Pope Gregory entered into the sea at Marcyll with a great
company / and had good wind and so took land at Gennes / and there new
refresshed his galays / and so took the sea again and sailed till he ca^e to
Rome. The romans were right joyful of his coming / and all the chief of
Rhome mounted on their horses / and so brought him in to Rome with great
tryumphe / and lodged in saint Peter's palys. and often times he vysited a
church / called our lady the great / within Rome. Wherein he had great pleasure
/ and did make therein many costly warkes. And within a while after his coming
to Rome he dyed / and was buried in ye said church and there his obsequy was
made as to a pope aparteyned.

ANon after the death of the pope Gregory the cardynalles drew them in to the
conclaue / in the palace of saint Peter. Anon after as they were entered to
chose a pope / acordyng to their usage / such one as should be good and
profitable for holy church / the romans assembled the^ together in a great
nombre / and came in to the bowrage of saint Peter. They were to the nombre
of.xxx. thousand what one and other / in the intent to do yuell / if the matter
went not according to their appetytes. And they came oftentimes before the
conclaue / and said: hark. ye sir cardynalles / deliver you atones / and make
a pope ye tarry to long / if ye make a romayne we woll natchaung him / but if
ye make any other / the romayne people and counsayles woll not take him for
pope / and ye put your self all / in adventure to be slain. The cardynals
/ who were as than in the danger of the romans / and herd well those words /
they were not at their ease / nor assured of their lives. and so apeased them
of their ire as well as they might with fair words / but somoche rose the
felony of the romans / y^ such as were next to ye conclaue / to thentent to
make the cardynalles a frayde / and to cause them to co^discende the rather to
their opinyons / brake up the door of the conclaue / where as the cardynalles
were. than the cardynalles went surely to have been slain / and so stedde away
to save their lives / some one way and some a another but the romans were not
so content / but took them and put them together again / whether they would or
not. The cardynalles than seeing themself in the danger of the romans and in
great parell of their lives / a greed among them self / more sor to please the
people than for any devotion / howbeit by good electyon they chase an holy man
a cardynall of the romayne nation / whom pope Urbayne the fyfte had made
cardynall / and he was called before the cardynall of saint Peter. This
electyon pleased greatly ye romans / and so this good man had all the ryghtes
that belonged to the papalyte / how beit he lived not but three days after /
and I shall show you why. The romans who desired to have a pope of their own
nation / were so joyful of this new pope / ye they took him / who was a
hundred year of age and set him on a white mule and so led him up and down
through ye city of Rome / exaltyng him / and showing how they had va^quesshed
the cardynals / seeing they had a pope romayn according to their own ententes /
in somoche that the good holy man was so sore traueyled that he fell sick /
and so dyed the third day. and was buried in the church of saint Peter and
there he lyethe.

Of the orgulous words / that the romans said at the electyon of the new
pope again. And how the war renewed between the french king and the king of
Nauerre. Cap. CCC.xxvii.
OF the death of this pope the cardynalles were right sorrowful / for they saw
well how the matter should not goo well to pass. For they had thought if y^
pope had lived / to have dissimuled among the romans for two or three years /
and at the last to have brought the sea apostolyke / in to some other place
than at Rome / at Napoles / or at Gennes / out of the danger of the romans /
but ye death of the pope brake their purpose. Than the cardynalles went again
in to the conclaue in greater danger than they were in before / for ye romans
assembled them together again before the conclaue / and made semblant to break
it up and to slay them all / if they did not chose a pope / acordyng to their
minds and cried to the cardynalles and said. Sirs advise yo we well / if ye
deliver us a pope romayne we be content / or else we woll make your herdes
reeder than your hattes be such words and manasshes abashed greatly ye
cardynall / for they had rather a dyed confessors then martyrs. Than to
bring them self out of that danger and parell / they made a pope / but he was
none of the college of cardynals / he was archbysshop of Bare a great clerk /
who greatly had traueyled for the welthe of holy church. with his promocyon of
papalyte / the romans were a peased / for the cardynall of Genne put out his
heed out at a wyndowe of the conclaue / and said on high to ye people of Rome.
Sirs: apease you / for you have a pope romayne / and that is Bartylme we des
Angles / archbysshop of Bare. The people answered all with one voice: than we
be content / the same archebysshoppe was not as than at Rome. I think he was
in Napoles. Than he was incontinent sent for / of the which tidings he was
right glad / and so came to Rome / and at his coming there was great feast made
to him. And so he had all the ryghtes that parteyned to the papalyte / and was
called Urban the sirt of that name / the romans had great joy: his creacyon
was signified to all the churches of christentie. And also to emperors /
kings / dukes / and earls / and the cardynalles sent word to all their
friends / that he was chosen by good and true eleciyon howbeit some of them
repented them after / that they had spoken so largely in the matter. This pope
renounced all graces given before also so diverse departed fro their countres
and places / and went to Rome to have grace. Now let us leave somewhat to speak
of this matter / and let up return to our princypall history of the
besynesses of France.

yE have hard right well here before / how the king of Nauer / who had to
his wife the freuche kings suster / for the love of the one and of the other /
it was said and purposed that the heritage of the children of the king of Nauer
/ the which was fallen to them by the right of their mother / ye the french
king their uncle by the succession of his suster ought to have power thereof in
name of the children seeing the children were in his keeping / whereby all the
land that the king of Nauer held in Normandy / should be in ye french kings
hand / as long as his nephews were with in age. Of all these matters the king
of Nauer doughted greatly / for he knew well the usage and custom of France.
Than he aduysed him of two things / the one was to send the bishop of
Panpilone and sir Martyn Car / in to France to the king / Desyring him
hertely / that for good love and favor to send him his two sons / Charles
and Peter. and if it pleased him not to send him both two / than at lest to
send him his son^e Charles / because he was toward a treaty for a marriage
for him / with the daughter of ye king of Castle. The second thing was / not
withstandyng that he sent thus into France / yetsecretly he sent also in to
Normandy / to visyte and to refresshe the castelles there / pertaynyng to him:
to thentent that the frenchmen should not take them in to their hands / for he
feared if they had them ones in these possessions / he should not have the^
again when he would. And so he sent two valiant men of arms naueroyse / in
whom he had great trust the one called Peter Basylle / and the other Ferando
into Normandy / for ye said enten^ The first messangers went into France / as
the bishop of Panpylone / and sir Marten Car / who spoke with the king at
great leysar / right humbly reco^maundyng the king of Nauer to him desyringe in
his name / that he would send to him his two sons. The king answered and
said. He would take advise and counsel in the matter. And so after they were
answered in the kings name: the king being present and the two children / also
his nephews / how that the king loved them right entierly. Wherefore they
could not be better in no place / and y^ the king of Nauerre ought to be
content rather to suffer the^ to be in France with the king their uncle / than
in any other place. And also ye king will in no wise depart fro them / but keep
them about him in their estate / as the children of a king / and like his
nephews: other answer ye messangers could not have. And in the mean season
y^ these messangers were in France / Peter of Basylle and Fera^do / arrived at
Chyerbourge with great prouisyon / the which they put in diverse places / in
towns and castles of the king of Nauers in Normandy. And so they visyted in
the king of Nauers name / all the county of Eureux / and made new officers
and set in people at their pleasures. and so returned again into Nauerre /
the bishop of Panpylone and sir Marten Carr / and showed the king how they
had spedde in France. The king of Nauer was not very glad of that tidyges /
when he could not have his own sons. And so began a great hatered in his
heart toward the french king / the which he would gladly have showed if he
had might / but the puyssance of him self was not so great to grieve the realm
of France / without help and aid of some other realm. So he suffered all
these matters / till he had better cause to speak / and more displeasure done to
him / than he had as than.

THe french king and his counsel were well informed / that the king of Nauer
had new reuitayled his castles and towns in Normandy / but they knew not for
what intent The same season thenglysshmen made a secret army on the sea of two
thousand men of arms but they had no horse with them. Of the which army the
duke of Lancastre and the earl of Ca^bridge were chief capitayns. This ye
normans reported surely to the french king / and this army came on the costs
of Normandy / but they could not tell to what part they would draw unto.
Some in France thought that ye king of Nauer had caused them to come in to
Normandy / to deliver to them such castelles as he had there. Wherefore it was
said to the king. Sir go hastily / and be lord of those castles before: for
ye may hap to tarry to long / for if the englisshmen have the^ / they may do
much hurt to the realm of France / for it shall be one of the best entrees
that they can have / if they were lords in Normandy / of the cities / towns /
and castles / belongyng to the king of Nauer. The same season there was taken
in France / two secrataries of the king of Nauers / a clerk and a squire. The
cleke was called Peter of Tertre and the squire James of Rue / and they were
brought to Paris to be examyned. And somoche it was known by them of the
secrettes of the realm of Nauerre / how they were determined to have done
damage to the king or else to have poisoned him. so they were condemned to dye
/ and execucyen was done at Paris beheeded and quartred. These tidings
multyplied so on the king of Nauer / that ye french king swear y^ he would
never attend to none other thing / till he had ryd Normandy / and taken in to
his possession / for the behoffe of his nephews / all the towns and castelles
that the king of Nauer held there. so daily there came sore informacions to the
french king against the king of Nauer. Also it was said openly / that ye
duke of Lancaster should give his daughter Kateryn to the king of Nauer / and
so by that means the king should give to the duke of Lancastre all the hole
countye of Deureur. These words were lightly believed in France for the king
of Nauer was but little trusted among them. So than the same time the french
king came to Rohan / and there assembled a great army of men of war / whereof
the lord Coucy / and the lord de la River were chief capitayns / and they all
met together before a town called Lyseur / a city in Normandy / parteynynge to
the king of Nauer. and these two lords had the two sons of the king of Nauer
/ Charles and Peter / to show to the^ of the country / that the war that
they made was in the name of ye two children / for their heritage that was
fallen to them by ye right of their mother / And how yt the king of Nauer had
no right to keep them / but the most part of the men of arms / were so
joined in love with the king of Nauer / that they could not depart out of his
service. And also the naueroyse that were there assembled / such as the king
of Nauer had sent thither / caused his war to be the more easyer and fair.

How the french king ceased all the land of the king of Nauers. Cap.
CCC.xxviii.
THe french king sent commyssioners to Mountpellyer / to cease ye land and
seignorie in to his hands / the which the king of Nauerr held. And when
these co^myssioners: that is to say sir Wylliam of Dormans and sir Johan Merger
were come to Mountpellyer / they sent for the most noblest persons of the
town / and showed them their co^myssions. They of Mountpellyer obeyed / for
they might do none otherwise / for if they had not obeyed / it had benyuell for
them. For the duke of Anio we and the constable of France / were in the
country with a great army / and desired nothing so much / as to have had
war with them of Mountpellyer. There were taken prisoners / two knights of
Normandy / who were before governors to the country under the king of Nauer:
and also sir Guy of Gravel / and sir Lyger Dergesy / who tarried in prison a
long time after. Thus the to wne of Mountpellyer / and all the barony was
become french.

Now let us return to the french army that was in Normandy / and she we how
the lord Coucy / and the lord de la River sped. they came before Eureur / and
laid siege thereto / they of the garysons parteyning to y^ king of Naue^ /
closed fast their garysons a gaynst the frenchmen / for they were not in mind
so soon to yield them up. When the king of Nauer understood that ye frenchmen
had taken the possessyon of Mountpellyer and of all the country: and yt great
nombre of men of arms were in the country of Eureux / pillyng and beatyng
down his towns and castelles. He had diverse y magmacyons and counsayls with
them that he trusted best / finally it was concluded by his counsel / that he
could have no conforte without it were by the englysshmen / wherefore it was
concluded / that he should send a sufficyent personage with letters of credece
to the young king of England and to his counsel. Desiring to be alyed with
him / and he to swear fro y^ day forward / to be good and true to the
english part: and to put in to their hands / all such forteresses as he
held in Normandy. And to do this message he commanded a clerk to go / in
whom ^he had great trust: called master ^aschall. And said to him: master
Paschall / go your ways in to England / and do so much that ye may bring me
good tidings / for fro he^s forth / I will be alyed with the englysshemen.
This clerk did as he was commanded / and made him ready: and took shyppyng and
sailed so long yt he arrived in Cornwall. and than rode for the till he ca^e to
Shene beside London / where the king of England was: and so he spoke with the
king / and reco^maunded the king of Nauerr his master to him. And so there
the king made him good there: and there was present the earl of Salisbury and
sir Symond Burle / who took on him to speak and to give him his answer for
that time / and said. Sir: on such a day the king will be at London / and than
send for all his counsel / at which time ye shall be herd. And so at the
day assigned / master Paschall showed to the king and to his counsel
theffect of his message / and spoke so sagely that he was well herd. And he
was answered by the counsel / that the king of Nauers offer ought not to be
refused: how be it to make so great alyance as the king of Nauer desires /
it behooves than that he come hyder into England in his own proper person to
thentent that he may be herd speak him self / whereby the matter should take
the better effect. And so with that answer master Paschall departed / and
returned in to Nauer / and showed the king all that he had done / and how it
behooved him to go in to England him self / and to se the young king of
England and to speak him self with him and his counsel. than the king of
Nauer answered and said: I am content to go theder. Than he made ready for him a
ship / called the Line: the which would go on the sea withal manner of wyndes
without parell. and so the king of Nauer took this ship and entered in to the sea with a preuy company / how be it he had with him sir Marten Carr and
master Paschall / and sailed so long that he arrived in England.

Of the alyences that the king of Nauer made with the king of England / and
how the french king had men of war in diverse places. Cap. CCC.xxix.
ALytell before his depertyng / the french king had the king of Nauer in
great hate / and knew covertly by some of the king of Nauers house / all the
secremesse between him and the king of England: and how that king Henry of
Castle had defied him / and made war against him. The king of Nauer left at
his depertynge behind him / ye vycont of Chastellon / the lord of Lestrade
father to Uyen / and the Bascle: and great nombre of men of war / as well of
his country as of the county of Foiz / to keep the fro^ters against the
spanyerdes. And when he was in the sea he had wind at will / and arrived in
Cornwall / and so rode to Wynsore / Where as king Richard and his counsel
were / who received him with great joy / for they thought the better to speed
of his land in Normandy: and specially of the castle of Chierbour^ / whereof
thenglysshmen desired greatly to be lords. The king of Nauer showed sagelye to
the king of England the cause of his coming / and he was well herd and so
well conforted / that he was content. I shall show you how this treaty went
between these two kings. One thing there was: the king of Nauer should fro
thens for the always be true english / and should never make peace with the
realm of France / nor with the king of Castle / without the knowledge and
consent of the king of England. And if the king of England or any of his men
by their puyssance / could get any towns or castelles that the king of
Nauer ought to have in Normandy against the frenchmen / that the same towns or
castles should abide for ever to be english / the souerayntie ever reserved
to the king of Nauerr. The which thing the englysshmen praised much /
because they thought by that means they should have asayre enter into France
thorough Normandy. And the king of England should send the same time a
thousand spears and two thousand archers by the river of Gyronde to Burdeur /
or to Bayone: and the men of arms to enter in to Nauerr / and to make war
against the king of Castle. And not to depart fro the king of Nauer or out of
his realm / till he had made an end of his war with the spanyerdes. And
the men of war so ones entered in to Nauer: the king of Nauer than to pay
them their wages / and to stuff the^ sufficiently / acordyng: after the same
rate that the king of England was wont to pay his men of war. Diverse
treaties and alya^nces were there made and ordained: and also written / sealed
/ and sworn to be kept / on both parts. And there were named such as should
go in to Normandy / and such as should go in to Nauer. And because that the
duke of Lancaster and the earl of Ca^bridge were not at this treaty / it was
ordained that this treaty should be sent to them sealed / to then tent that
they should make have to enter into Normandy. The duke of Bretayne was present
at this treaty.

RIng Charles of France / who was right sage and subtell: and so he well
showed himself as long as he lived. He was well enfourmed of the army of
England / yet he knew no certe^tie but by suspecte / whyder they would draw
in to Normandy or else into Bretayne. And for dout thereof / he held many men of
arms in Bretayne / whereof the lord Clysson / the lord de Lauall / the
vycount of Rohan the lord of Beaumanoyre / and the lord of Rochfort were
capitayns. And had besieged Breest by bastydes / and none otherwise: wherefore
they might vitayle Breast when they list. And in the rowne was captain / a
valyant squye^ of England / called James Clerk. And because the french king
knew well that the king of Nauerr was alyed with England / and thought
surely that or his return / he would enter in to some treaty with his
adversary y^ kyn of England. And douted of this army thus on the sea / lest
they should take land in Normandy / and enter into the castelles parteyninge to
the king of Nauer. Therefore he sent hastily to the lord Coucy and to the lord
de la Ryuerr / that they should as shortly as they could / get by fayrnesse
or by foulness / such castelles as were belonging to the king of Nauer /
and specially such as were nere to the seesyde. Ne knew well that Chyerbourge
would not caselye be won / how be it by land they could not ^euitayle it nor
refresshe it with men / out of the basse marches of Bretayne and of Normandy
And so for the bretons sir Olyuer Clysson was captain / and for the normayns
/ sir Diuoye and sir Percyuall.

Of the siege that the lord Coucy / and the lord de la River laid to
Carentyne: and of the castelles and towns that the king of Nauerre lost in
Normandy Cap. CCC.xxx.
THe (...) and the lord de la ^yuer ^esieged Carentyne with great puyssaunce /
and they of Ca^^tyne had as than no captain of name / nor had not sith the
death of sir Eustace Dambreticourt / who dyed there. He had been captain there
four year. So they had no conforte nor counsel but of them self / and
they saw well against them a great nombre / and also the admyrall of France
sir Johan of Uyen and the admyrall of Spaygne / and with them a great nombre of
men of war before Chy^rbourge. They knew nothing of the treaty of the
king of Nauerr / nor how he had spedde in England. And they were daily
assailed two ways: the one by armies / and the other way by words: for the
lord Coucy and the lord de la River / would gladly have had the town of
Carentyne. And at last they did so much that they had it by treaty / and so
it was given up to the obeisance of the french king / the right reserved of
the true enhery toure / who was the king of Nauers son^e. In all treaties the
lords of France acorded to reserve y^ chyldes right / for they cared not / so
they might have the towns and castles in their possessyon. Thus they had
Carentyne / and put therein new men of war: and than departed and went to the
castle of Molmeur and within three days they had it by treaty. And than they
went to Couches and lay by the fair river of Dorne / which rynneth to Cane:
and there they tarried till they knew the minds of the^ of Couches / and so
they yielded up by treaty. The lord of Coucy / and the lord de la river / had
always with them the child of Nauer / which helped much their matter. ever
when any yielded up to the french king or to his co^myssioners / it was ever in
the treaty by condycion / y^ they might depart when they list / and whyder
they would Such as departed went no farther but to Eureur / whereof Done Ferant
naueroyse was captain. After the conquest of Couches / they departed and went
to Past / and there made assaut / and diverse hurt on both parties: but the same
day it was yielded up / and so y^ castle became french. And finally all that
ever y^ king of Nauer had in Normandy / except Eureux and Chyerbourge / was
yielded up and become french. And when they had won all castles and small
holds / and that all the country was under their obeysaunce. Than they went
and laid siege to Eureux: and there be and were went to be of old usage / the
most strongest naueroyse in all Normany: and they of Deureur never loved
perfitely none other lord but the king of Nauer. So Eureux was besieged right
puissantly and endured a long season for within was Feraudo captain / who
did many a feate of arms with his own hands.

THe same season the king of Nauerre was returned in to his own country /
and trusted some what to have been aided by the englysshmen / how be it they
did him no profit as apered. For the duke of Lancastre and the earl of
Cambridge had the wind against them to come in to Normandy. And alsoo the
army that was made in England / of the four thousand men of arms / and
eight thousand archers. As Soon as they were come to Hampton they entered in to
their ships / before the feast of saint Johan the Baptyst / and so departed:
and they found at Plommouthe the earl of Salisbury and sir Johan of Arundell /
who should have gone in to Bretayne / to have refresshed the^ of Breast and of
Hanybout but they could have no wind before. And so they entered in to the
duke of Lancasters army / and took land in the isle of Wight / where they
tarried a long space / to here tidings outher out of Bretayne or out of
Normandy. Than they herd tidings / how the army of France was one the sea /
wherefore they sent sir John^ of Arundell / with two hundred men of arms and
four hundred archers to Hampton / to eschew all the parels that might fall by
the sea.

Of the men of warr^ that the duke of Aniou retained against the^glisshmen /
and of the siege that the spanyerdes held before Bayone. Cap. CCC.xxxi.
Because of this / the french king thought to provide for remedy to resyst his
enemies / for it was showed him by the normayns / that the englysshmen were on
the se with a great puyssance / but he could not tell whyder they would go.
Than be sent a special commandment through out his realm / that every man
knights and squyers should be ready apparelled for the war / to go and to
come where he commanded them. In likewise the duke of Aniou had all that
season retained men of war on all sides / to the intent to have laid siege
to Burdeux. And in his company was his brother the duke of Berrey and the
Constable of France: and all the flour of chiualry of Gascone / Auuergne /
Poictou / and Limosyn. And the better to come to his intent / and to have y^
more nombre of men of war by the consent of the king his brother he had
gathered in Languedoc / to the sum of two hundred. M. frankes. Howbeit he
could not do his enterprice in that season / for y^ king sent for the duke of
Berrey his brother / and for the constable of France / and for all other
barons / such as he thought should do him service For well he knew / that
the englysshmen were on the sea / but he wist not whyder they would draw. And
though this enterprice in Laquen doc were broken / yet the poor men that had
paid great sommes of money for that intent / had not their money again.

THe same season y^ king of Castle with xx. thousa^de spanyerdes and catelayns
held siege before Bayone / and there lay all the winter. And many a feate of
arms was there done / both by land and by water / for Radig^ de Rour and
Dampe Ferrant of Castle / Ambrose Bouchenoyr and Peter Bascle lay at ancre
before Bayone with two hundred vessels / (...) did much trouble to them of
Bayone. Of the which town there was captain / a valyant knight of England
/ called sir Mathewe Gorney. His wit and prowes / conforted them of the town
greatly / how be it some said of them that were within / that the spanyerdes
had had their intent at length / if a death had not fallen among them. For there
fell such a mortalyte in the host / that of five there dyed three. and king
Henry of Castle had there with him a ^ygr^ ma^cer of Tollet / who said y^ the
air there was so enuenomed and corrupted / that there was no remedy / but that
they were all in great danger and parell of death. And because of that doubt /
the king dyslodged and brake up y^ siege / but the spanyerdes and the bretons
the same season had won a broad in the country / diverse castles and small
holds / and so entered in to them. And the king of Castle went to Colongne /
and sent his constable to lay siege before Paupylone / with.x. thousand
spanyerdes / in the which city the vicounte of Chastellon / and the lord of
Lescute and the Bascle / were with two hundred spears / who greatly took head
for the city. And the king of Nauer who was newly reuirned out of England /
was at Tudela abiding daily for such socours / as should have come to him
thens / as it was ordained. for the king of England and his counsayll / had
ordained to have come thither / the lord Neuyll / and sir Thomas de Terms /
and they were at Plommouthe / and there about with a thousand men of arms /
and two thousand archers / to thentent to have come to Burdeaul^ / how beit
they could have no passage at their desire / but the great army of England /
with the duke of Lancastre took landyng at saint Malo in the Is^e / the which
was anon known. Than departed for their houses / the vicount of Bellyer / sir
Henry of Malatrayt / and the lord of Co^^bre / and so they came and entered in
to saint Malo with two hundred men of arms / whereof the captain Morsonae was
greatly reioysed / for else they had been in great danger.

Of the issues and iourneys that the englisshmen made in that season in diverse
places in France / and also of the piteous death of yuan of wales. Cap.
CCC.xxxii.
SIr Johan Arundell / who was at Hampton with two hundred men of arms / and
four. C. archers / hard by his me^ who had been taken on the sea in a ship of
Normandy / how the duke of Lancastre and his army had so scoured the hauyns
of Normandy / that there were no frenchmen on y^ see. Than inco^tynent he
ordained four great ships / charged with prouisyon / and so entered in to his
ship / and sailed till he came in to the haven of Chierbourc / where he was
received with great joy / and at that time the castle was in the keeping of
the naueroyse / but than they departed saving Peter Bascle / who aboode still.
he was captain there before / and so tarried with the englysshmen. Chierbourc
was not likely to be won without famyn / for it is one of the strongest
castelles in the world and has diverse fair issues. So sir Johan Arundell
tarried there a five days / and reuitayled the castle / and than departed
again to Hampton / for there he was captain. Now let us speak of the siege
of saint Malo.

When the englysshmen entered first into the Isle of saint Malo / they found
there many vessels of Rochell / charged with good wine / the merchauntes had
anon sold the wine and the ships burnt. Tha^ they laid siege to saint Malo
/ for they were men ynowe so to do / and the englisshmen spread abroad in the
country / and did much hurt / a^^ they y^ most commonly kept the feldes was
sir Robert of Courbes / and sir Hughe Brone his nephe we / who knew right well
the country and the chanon Robersarte with them / daily they rode forth
sometime they wanne / and sometime they lost. So they wasted and brent all the
country about saint Malo. And the duke of Lancastre / and the earl of
Cambridge his brother / and their army had vitayle plenty / for there came to
them enough out of England. So before saint Malo / there were diverse assautes
/ and marvelously well defended / for there were right good men of war within
/ wherefore they were not easy to be conquered. They of the host caused to be
made diverse mantels of assaute / and they had a four hundred gonnes laid
round about the town / the which greatly constrained them within. Among
diverse assautes / there was one marvelous ferse the which endured a hole day /
thereat were diverse englysshmen slain and sore hurt for they with in defended
them self so valiantly * y^ they lost not a man. There was slain a knight of
England called sir Peter Lescume / for whose death the duke and his brother /
were right sore o^spleased.

ANd as ye have herd here before: yuan of Wales / lay at siege before Mortayne
in Poitou / in four bastydes: of the which town the lord of Lestrade was
captain. The first bastyde where as part of the siege lay / as at the side
of a rock / before the castle of Geron one the sea * the which basty de yuan
him self kept. The second was between the water and the castle low before a
posterne / so that none could enter nor issue thereat. The third bastyde was on
the other side of the castle. The fourth was in the church of saint Legar /
half a leage ^^o y^ castle. By these four bastydes they with in Mortayne
were sore constrained / because of the lenght of the siege / for it endured a
year and a half. So that they within had nothing to live by norshowe on their
fete / nor confort nor soc our apered none to them fro any part* wherefore
they were sore abashed. This siege thus enduryng before Mortayne / there
issued out of the realm of England / and out of the marches of Wales a squier
a walshman / called James Laube / he was but a small ge^tylman and that well
showed a^t / for a very ge^tylman will never set his mind on so evil an
intent. some said or he departed out of England / be was charged and
enfourmed / by some knights of England / to do the treason that he did. For
this ynan of Wales was greatly behated in England and in Gascon / because of
the captall of Beufz * whom he took and helped thereto before Soubyse in
Poictou. For after he was taken / the frenchmen would not deliver him again by
no means / another for ransom nor for exchange / yet the earl of saint Poule
was offered for him / and gold and silver / but it would not be taken. And
when he saw that / for pure melancoly he dyed in y^ temple at Paris / whereof
all his friends had great displeasure. This walsshe squier James Laube / the
same season arrived in Bretayne and did somoche / that he came in to Poictou /
and ever as he went he named him self to beseruaunt to yuan of Wales for he
spoke good french / saying how he was come out of Wales to speak with yuan /
and so he was anon believed / and was conveyed by them of the country to
Mortaygne / where the siege was. Than he went wisely to yuan / and showed him
in his own langage how he was come out of his country to se him / and to do
him service. yuan who thought none ill * lightly believed him / and gave him
much thanks for his coming / and said: how he would right gladlye have his
service. And than he demanded of him tidings of the country of Wales / and
he showed him true tidings / and vntre we for he made him believe how all the
country of Wales would gladlye have him to be their lord. These words brought
this James greatly in love with yuan / for every man naturally desires to go
in to their own cou^tres / and to here thereof / so y^ yuan made him his
chamberlayne. And this James every day more and more / aquaynted him so with
this yuan of Wales / that he had not so much trust in no man / as he had in
him. Somoch this yuan loved this James Laube that it was his distructyon / and
the more pytie / for he was a good and a valyant man of arms. And was sometime
son to a prince of Wales / who king Edward of England caused to lose his
heed / the cause why I can not tell. and so king Edward ceased in to his
hands / all the prouynce of Wales. And this yuan in his youth came in to
France / and showed all his trouble to king Philyppe / than being french king
/ who kept him still about him as long as he lived / and was as one of the
children of his chamber with his neuewes of Alenson and other. And in likewise
so did king Johan / and than he bare first arms / and was at the batell of
Poicters / how be it he was not there taken: it had been better for him / that
he had been there slain. and when the peace was made bitwene the king of
England and the french king / than this yuan went in to Lombardy / and
there continued in war. And when the war began again between England and
France / than he returned again in to France / and bare him self so well y^
he was greatly praised / and well-beloved with the french king and with all the
lords. Now let us speak of his end the which I am loathe to do / saving
to show truly what fell in that time.

THis yuan of Wales had an usage being before Mortayne at the siege / that
gladly in the morning when he was up and ready / he would come before the
castle / and sytte down and kembe his heed a good long space / and sit and
behold the castle / and the country about / being out of doubt or fear af
any thing / and lightly there went none with him but this James Laube / and
oftentimes he made him ready / and none but he / whereby at last came his endyng
day. On a morning betymes wha^ the wether was fair and clear / and the night
had been so hot that he could not sleep / howebeit he rose / and did on him
but a syngle iacket and his shyrte / and a mantell or a cloak above / and so
went thither as he was wont to go / and sat him down / and this James Laube
with him / every man being in their lodgings a sleep / for it was early in
the morning / and there was made but little watch / for they thought themself
sure of the castle. And when yuan was set on an old stock of wode / he
said to James / go to my lodgyng and fatche my comb / for I will refreshe me
here a tytell season. sir (...) he it shall be done / and so he went and came
again with the comb / and as he was coming I trow the devil entered in to
him / for beside the comb / he brought with him a little Jauelyne of Spain
with a large heed of stele / and with the same / struck this yuan as he sat
clean through out the body / so y^ he fell down stark deed. and when he had
done / he left still the dart in his body / and so went his way / and drew
under covert of the castle / and so came to the barryers and was let in / for
he made signs to enter / and so he was brought before the Soudyc of Lestrade.
Sir (...) he / I have delivered you of one of the greatest enemies that ye had
/ of whom is that quod the Sowdic? of yuan of Wales (...) James / and how so
(...) the Soudic? thus (...) James / and so showed him all the hole matter: as
ye have herd before / fro point to point. And when the Soudycherde that / he
shaked his heed and beheld him right felly / and said. A than y^ have murdered
him: know for ^routhe all things consydred. Saving but that this deed is for
our profit / it should cost the thine heed / but sith it is done it can not
be undone again. how beit / it is a great damage of that gentylman to be so
slain / we shall have rather blame thereby than praise.

THis was the end of yuan or Owen of Wales wheder ye will all is one / slain
by great unhap and treason / wherewith they of the host when they knew it /
were right sorry and displeased / and so was every man y^ herd thereof / and
specially king Charles of France / who greatly complained his death / how
beit he could not amend it. And so this yuan was buried in the church of
saint Ledger / where as he had made a bastyde / half a leage fro the castle
of Mortayne. And all the gentylmen of the host were at his buryeng / the
which was done right honorably. How beit for all that the siege held still
before Mortayne / for there were good knights and squiers / bretons poicteuyns
/ and frenchmen / who had geatter desire to conquer the castle / than they
had before. and thought never to depart thens / till they had won it / or
else raised by puyssance / they would so feign have been revenged of the death
of yuan of Wales / and so they lay still without any sawte geuynge / for they
knew well they lacked vitayle within the castle / and none could come to
them. Now let us leave to speak of the siege of Mortayne and return to the
siege before saint Malo / and first to speak of y^ siege of Eureux / and how
they did that lay there.

How they within Eureux yielded them self french / and of the two hoostes
assembled to gyder before saint Malo. Cap. CCC.xxxiii.
THe siege being before Eureux / the lord of Coucy and the lord de la River /
who were souerayns of the host / herd often times tidings fro the french
king for he lay at Rohan / as nere to his men as he might / for he thought to
have Eureux shortly out of hand / outher byforce or by composicion / for he
perceived well how the englisshmen began to wax strong in Bretayne wherefore he
would have all his men of war to draw thither / to reyse the siege before
saint Malos / and to fight with ye englysshmen. These two lords before Eureux
/ aquyted them self right valyantly: for every day they made assaute / and
also sent many treaties to the burgesses of the town / showing them how
they suffered them self to be grieved without reason / and mynysshe their
goodesse / and suffer their houses in the country / to be beaten down and
brent. For their natural lord was there with out with the^ (Charles of Nauer)
to whom the heritage of the countye of Eureux was fallen / by reason of the
death of the countess his mother. And counsayled them not to hold the error
and opinion of the folysshe naueroyse / and such other as Ferando is: who
cares not to lease them all. for beside their ryghtfull quarrel / they said
they would never depart thens / till they had the castle at their will: and
if they had it by force / they should have no mercy / and y^ town new peopled
with strangers. Such offers / words / and manasshes were showed to them of
Eureux / and every day they were assailed. Than they within began to doubt /
for there apered to them no manner of comfort / tha^ they said one to another /
we se well that the french king desires not the country and castle of
Eureux / for him self: but for his nephewe Charles of Nauerre. Than they fell
in treatye with the lord Coucy. When Ferando knew that the burgesses of the
town fell in treatye / he kept him self within the castle / and would not
come out / nor be at none of their treatyes: finally they of the town and
country yielded up / their lives and goodesse saved / and received Charles of
Nauerre for their lord. And than they besieged Ferando within the castle /
than he began to entreat / so that if they would suffer him and his to depart
without danger / he would yield up ye castle. The lords were content. Than
they departed out of the castle and so were brought to Chyerbourc. After the
conquest of Eureux / all the capytayns of the host drew to Rohan / where the
king lay to here tidings / for well he knew that thenglysshmen lay at siege
before saint Malos in Bretayne. The king received them joyfully / and specially
the lord Coucy and the lord de la River because they had so well spedde.
These lords abode still in Normandy / and were still retained in wages.

THe french king / who all this season lay still at Rohan / had sure
knowledge how the englysshmen had puissantly besieged saint Malos: and how
they within were sore constrained: and every day enpayred / he thought ve would
be loathe to lose his men / and the good town of saint Malos / for if that had been ones englisshe / he thought Bretayn sore weaked on that side. therefore to
resyst the englisshmen the king had made a great assemble / for none durst
disobey his commandment / as to sytte still at home. And so the king sent
his two brethren thither / the duke of Berrey and ye duke of Burgoyn / the earl
of Alenson / the earl de la March the Dolphyn / of Auuergne / therle of Guefe
/ sir Johan of Bolayne / and many other great barons and knights of all
countries. Also the king commanded his constable sir Bertram of Clesquy / yt
he should not be behind. The constable would not dysobey / but went forth
with a great company of men of arms / of Poictou / Aniou / and Towrayne. Also
there was the two marshals of France / and yt marshall of Bleunylle: also there
was sir Olyuer of Clisson / the lord of Leon / and all the barons of Bretayne.
They were a.x. thousand men of arms / and in ye feldes mo than a hundred
thousand horse / they lodged ever as nere to gyder as they could / but
between the^ and the englisshmen there was a river and an arm of the sea. And
often times when the sea was ebbed / some knights and squiers would go and do
diverse feats of arms with their enemies in the plain river. There was never
such assemble made in Bretayne before / for if the frenchmen were puyssa^t /
in like wise so were the englisshmen / and each part thought to fight / for
every day they showed them self in the field / with baners and penons waueryng
with the wind / it was great pleasure to behold the^. The frenchemen would
come down to the river side / and make semblant to fight / and would say /
behold yonder our enemies / anon ye see will ebb / if they wollcome over we
will se them come fight / but it semythe they have no will thereto / they fear
the fortunes of battle / we think their chief governors will not suffer
them to adventure / to fight with us in plain battle.

THis fasynge and mustryng was daily between them. So on a day the earl of
Cambridge / swear and said: that if there were any mo such assembles / that if
they would not come and fight / that he would go over and fight with them /
what soever fell thereof. Than on a day the vowarde with the constable of
France / who saw well how the englysshmen were hot and hasty / ordained on
a season all his batayls on the sands / as nere to the river as they could /
all a foot. The earl of Cambridge when he saw their manner said / they that
love me follow me / for I will go and fight with the^ / and so dasshed in to
the water / the which as than was low / but the fludde was coming / and so
came just to the ryuersyde with his baner. tha^ the englisshmen began to shote
against ye frenchmen / and ye constable of France drew abacke and all his
people / and went back in to the field who thought verily y^ the englisshmen
would a come over the water / they would gladly have caused them to have done
so. The duke of Lancastre with a great battle / was ready to have followed his
brother if he had seen there had been need / and said to Gerarde of Brees a
squier of Heynaulte / who was by him. Gerarde: behold my brother / how he
aduentureth himself / it seems how he shows ensample to ye frenchemen /
how he would feign fight with the^ / but it seems they have but small will
thereto. Thus they continued and no deades of arms done on another party / the
fludde began to rise. Than the englisshmen drew a back out of the river / and
went to their lodgings / and the frenchmen in like wise to theirs.

IN such musters and assembles / the siege during: there was done diverse
feats of arms. The frenchmen kept well their fronter / so that the
englisshmen durst not pass the river. And so it was / that diverse times more
higher in the country / certain knights and squiers bretons / such as knew
well the country / rode a broad in certain companyes / and passed the river
by gydes / and often times encountered with the englisshe foragers / and
sometime they fought / and so^e over thrown: sometime they wan / and sometime
lost / as adventures of war often times falls. The siege thus endurynge the
lords of England more dilygently to attain to their purpose / they concluded
to make a mine / and so thereby to enter in to saint Malos / for otherwise they
thought they could not get the town / it was so full of good men of war /
and so well furnysshed with all ordynance and artyllery: the which helped the^
merueylusly well. Also thenglisshmen nigh every day / were feign to be armed
and to assemble to gyder to abide battle / if the frenchmen would have come
forward / wherefore they had no leyser to make any assawtes to y^ town / but
with their gonnes / whereof they had great plenty: which troubled them sore
within the town. So they aduysed the place to make their mine and set mynours
a warke. Now let us a little space leave spekyng of this siege / and speak
of the siege of Mortayne in Poictou.

How the englysshmen came and raised the siege before Mortayne. Cap.
CCC.xxxiiii.
VE have hard before: of the bethe of yuan of Wales / and how he was slain /
and how the bretons and poicteuyns / were still at the siege before Mortayne /
and sir James of Mountmore / sir Percyuall Deyneuall / Wylliam of Mountcountour
/ and sir James of Surgeres were capitaynes / and would not leave the siege /
for the death of yuan of Wales: who was their sovereign captain. they had
great desire to revenge his death on them of the forteresse. Also ye have
herd: how sir Thom^s Trivet / sir Wyllm^ Scrope / sir Thomas Berton / sir
Wylliam Sendrue / and a great nombre of men of arms and archers / were
ordained to go in to the marches of Bordeaux / for the reskewe of them of
Mortayne. And sir Mathewe Gornay who was at Bayon / and was daily occupied
therabout / in the marches against the gascons / and such as held forteresses
there. These said four knights and their companyes had layen at Plomouthe.vii.
months / and could have no wind to serve them to go in to Gascoyne / whereof
they were right sore displeased / but they could not amend it. Also ye have
hard / how the lord Neuyll of England was ordained with a great nombre of
men of arms and archers / to go and comfort the king of Nauer against the
spany ardes / for he was ordained to be seneshall of Burdeux / and so he found
all these other men of warr^styll at Plomouth / and each of them were glad of
other. and anon after the lord Neuels coming they had wind at will. Than they
took shippynge and sailed toward Gascoyne / and so they were in one flete a
six score vessels and xl. barks / there might well be a thousa^de men of
arms / and two thousand archers / and they had no let on the sea but good
wind / and so they entered in to the haven of Burdeux / the even of our Lady in
Septembre: the yer of our sorde a thousand three hundred.lxxvii. When the
bretons and poicteuyns / that lay at siege before Mortaygne / saw such a
flete of ships pass by / making great feast and brunt / and so w^ynge of
trompettes / they were right pensive / and they within the castle right
joyful: for they hoped well than to be shortly reskewed / or else their
enemies to have battle / for they thought surely they were not come thither for
naught / but for to do some great feate of arms. Than sir James of Mountmore
and the capitaynes of the host drew to guyder to counsel / to determyne
what was best for the^ to do. Than they repented the^ of the forsakyng of the
treaty that was offered the^ before / for but a little before / the Soudic of
Lestrade / offered to render up ye forteresse / so they might depart to Burdeur
/ their lives and goods saved / but the frenchmen would not thereof. So than
they sent a ^^^aulde to the castle showing the^ how they were content to
receive their treaty. The Soudic answered: how they were than in no mind ^o
fall to no treaty / for their socour was come / wherefore they would freely
depart or a ^yde at their pleasure: so ye siege lay still. The lord Neuyll
and his company came to Burdea^ / and they were joyfully received of sir
Wylliam ^^^man seneshall of Lands / sir Johan of Multon mayre of the city /
and of the archbysshop there / and of the burgesses / ladies / and (...). The
lord Neuyll was lodged in the abbey of saint Andrews / and so was seneshall
of Burdeur. Than anon after he made an assemble of knights and squiers
gascons / such as held of the englisshe part / so that he was a four
thousand. And he ordained ships and vessels on the river of Garon / and so
departed fro Burdeux to go and reyse the siege before Mortayne. Anon these
tidings were known in the french host / how thenglysshmen and gascons were
coming down the river of Garon to reyse their siege / or else to ^yght with
them. Than the capitayns drew to counsel / and all things considered / it
was thought they were not able to abide y^ puyssance / wherefore it was
determined that they should rather l^^e ^he time that they had spent / than
to put themself in to a farther danger and parell. And so sowned then
dis^ogyng without any thing doing farther / and so drew in to Poictou: but all
departed not / for a certain bretons and walshmen that were parteynynge to
yuan of Wales / said: how they were able to abide all ye world and to keep the
fortress of saint Ledger / and so they entered into it / and drue in all their
artyllary.

THe knights of England and Gascon / who were coming with full sails in
barges / by the River of Garon: they rested at thentre before Mortayne / and so
took land little and little. And as they landed / they put themself in order
ready to assail y^ fortress of saint Ledger / wherein the bretons were. And so
at the first coming there was a sore assaut / and while they were at the assaut
/ the lord Neuyll sent a haraude to Mortayn to the Soudic to know how he
did. The haraude did as he was commanded / and brought word again how they
did rightwell: but that they had no shows on their fete. The assaut before
saint Legerendured well three hours and wan nothing / but had diverse of their
men sore hurt / and so lodged the^ that night. And it was their minds not to
depart thens till they had won that hold / and were sore displeased that the
lord of Mo^tmore and the other french knights had not ben ^in the fortress of
saint Ledger / but they were wiselye departed and left there the bretons.

How the englysshmen recovered diverse castelles on the frenchmen in Burdeloys.
Cap. CCC.xxxv.
ANd in the next morning the lord Neuyll and the knights of England ordained
to give assaut to saint Ledger / and so sowned their tru^pettes to ye assaute
and aproched to the fortress and there began a sore assaut The fortress stood
so on a rock y^ none could easily aproche thereto / and on y^ wekest side there
were diverse great dykes / so that none could easily aproche. The assaylers
traueyled sore and wanne but little / but diverse of their men were sore hurt /
and some slain. Than thassaut ceased / and it was thought best to fill the
dykes / to have the more advantage togyue assaut: so with great pain the dykes
were filled. Than the bretons that were within seeing that douted more than /
than they did before: and good reason why / and so fell to entreat. The
englysshmen who had great mind of ye king of Nauers business: and also *
thought to deliver certain fortresses in Burdelois / holden by the french
bretons / agreed to their treaty / and so the hold of saint Ledger was given
up so that they within departed whyder they list / their lives and goods
saved. Thus saint Legers was english / and than the lords went to the
castle of Mortayne and found y^ Soudic of Lestrade in the same case / as the
haraud had reported to the^ before. So than they were refresshed of every thing
that they neded / and the castle new furnysshed with me^. And than they
returned again to Bordeaux the same way they ca^e by water / by the river of
Garon.

When they were come again to Bordeaux and refresshed / in the mean season
they had knowledge / y^ a sire leages thens / there was a barone that held a
fortress called saint Mauberen / in a country called Medoc / who did much
hurt in the country. Tha^thenglysshe lords charged all their prouisyon on the
river of Garone and all their artyllary / and than took their horses about a
three hundred spears / and so came by land to saint Mauberen. And there were of
gascoyns with the lord Neuyll / sir Axchambalt of Grayle / the lord of Rousy
/ the lord of Duras / and ye lord of Ternon. And when the barons and their
companyes were come before saint Mauberen they took their lodging / and
incontinent gave assaut the which was feirse and terryble / for the bretons
within were good men of war / and their captain was one called Huguelyn /
by whom they were ruled. This first assaut did the bretons but little hurt /
than thenglysshmen drew to their lodging. The next morning they raised up
their engyns to cast stones / and to break down the tops of the byldinges in
the tower. The.iii. day they ordained to give asore assaut / saying how those
rybaudes should not long endure against them. There was a sore and a feirse
assaut / and many a man slain and hurt: there were never men that better
defended them self than the bretons did. How be it finally / seeing no
confort coming fro no part to them ward they fell in treaty / for they saw
well their enemies would not depart thens / till they had them at their
pleasure / though they should lie long there therefore. So ye treaty took
such effect y^ they gave up saint Mauberen / and departed with their goods
without damage / and so they went in to Poictou or whyder they list. And when
the lord Neuyll was lord thereof / he newly repaired the forteresse and
furnysshed it with new men and artillary / and set therein gascoyns to keep
it. A squire of Gascoyne / called Peter of Brasyas was captain there / and
than y^ lord Neuyll returned to Burdeux. And daily he herd how the siege
endured before Panpilone in Nauer the which was besieged by the child of
Castle / but they herd no certain tidings of the king of Nauer / nor also
the king of Nauerr herd no word of them / the which greatly displeased him.
Now let us return to the business in Bretayne and in Normandy / and speak
of the siege of saint Malo.

How the mine made by thenglisshmen against saint Malos was lost / and the
siege raised. Cap. ccc.xxxvi.
BEfore the town of saint Malo there was a sore siege and many a soore saute
given / for thenglysshmen had well a four hundred go^nes / who shot night and
day into the fortress / and against it. And the captain within called
Morfonas a valyant man of arms / set all his mind to ye defense of the
forteresse / and by the good counsel of sir Henry of Maletrait / of the lord
Co^bore / and of the vycont of Bellere / did so valyantly that they took all y^
time but little hurt. In the country as ye have herd before: was all about
the flower of France / as well of great lords as other / they were to the
nombre of.xvi. thousand men of arms / knights and squyers / and well a
hundred thousand horses / and gladly they would have fought with
the^glisshmen. And in likewise the englysshmen would gladly have done the same
/ if any part could have found any advantage / but that thing which brake
their purpose oftentimes / was a river that was between them / so that wha^ the
studde came there could none pass over so that none of them might come at
other. And always the mine went forward / and they within were in great dout.
ye may well know that in such assembles it could be non otherwise / but that
the foragers of either pertie somtymes met in the field / for there were expert
knights and squyers of both parties: and many a feat of arms done / and some
overthrown. These myners wrought sore day and night under y^ earth to thentent
to come in to the town that way / and to make a pane of the wall to fall / so
that their men might enter. Of this mine Morfonace and they within douted
greatly / for they knew well by that they might be lost / they cared for none
other assaut but for that. For their town was well furnysshed with vitayls and
artyllary / to keep it for two year if need were / but they had great thought
how to break this mine. so long they thought thereon and traueyled there about
that at last they came to their ententes / and by great adventure / as many
things falls in war. The earl Richard of Arundell should have kept the
watch one night / with a certain with him of his own men. And therle took no
great head of that was his charge / so that they ^in saint Malos knew thereof
by their spies or other wise. And so wha^ie they saw it was time / on trust of
the watch they departed secretly out of the town / the host being a sleep.
And so they came without noise making to ye place where as the mine was a
making: and the myners had nigh made an end of their warke Than Morfonace and
his company being ready to do that he was come for at their ease and without
defense brake the mine / so that some of the myners ca^e never out: for the
mine fell down on them. And when they had done / they said they would awake
the watch that was next the town / to thentent that the host should know
how valiantly they had done. And so they entered in to the one side of the
field cryeng their cries / beatyng down of tents and lodgings / and sleynge
of men: so that the host began to stir. Than Morfonace and his company with
drew them in to saint Malos / without hurt or danger. Than the host began to
assemble / and ye duke had great marueyle what it might be * and demanded what
it was. Than it was showed him that in y^ defaut of the watch their mine was
lost the same time. Than the duke of Lancastre sent for therle of Arundell /
and he was sore rebuked for this adventure: but he excused him self as well as
he might. Howbeit he was there with sore ashamed / and had rather have spent a
hundred thousand frankes / than it should have so fortuned.

This adventure thus fallen / and their mine broken: than the lords of ye
host drew to counsel / to know what were best for them to do. Than they
beheld each other / and saw well how they had lost their season / the which
was not likely to be recovered again. And to begin a new mine they thought
they should never bring it to an end / for y^ time passed and winter drue on.
So they determined all things co^sydred for the best to dyll^g^ and to
return in to England again. And it was than ordained / that every man should
dyslodge and go to ship: their flete lay still at ancre in the haven of
saint Malo. Anon every man was dislodged and in to ship / and had wind at
will. And so sailed toward England and aryued at Ha^pton / and there took
land And there they knew that sir John^ Aru^dell capiten of Ha^pton was gone
to Chierborc / to refresh ye garrison there. Thus brake up the^glishe army and
every man drue to his own house and some repassed the sea and went into their
own countries. Than the commons of England began to murmr against ye noble
men / saying how they had done all that season but little good / and
specially because saint Malos was so escaped / wherefore the earl of Arundell
had but little grace nor love.

How sir Olyuer of Clesquy was taken by them of Chierbourge. Cap. CCC.xxxvii.
Anon after the departure of the englysshmen fro saint Malo / and that the
fre^chemen had refresshed newlye the town and the castle. Than the constable
of France and the bretons / determined to go and lay siege to Chierbourc *
whereof sir Johan Har^ston was capitayn / and had with him diverse knights both
english and naueroyse. And the hole host of France went not thither / for
there departed the duke of Berrey / the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone
/ the earl de la March / the Dolphyn of Auuergne / and all the great lords:
and sent their me^ in to their countries. And diverse of them went to Rohan to
se the king / who received them right ioyously: and a three hundred spears of
bretons and normayns / went to Ualonges a three leages fro Chierbourge / and
there made their bastydes. And they knew well that sir Johan Aru^dell had
newly refresshed Chierbourc and they supposed that he was as tha^ between
Chierbourge and Ualo^ges. On that side there were high wodes and forestes /
that endured to the cite of Co^stances / so they of Chierbourg might issue out
and ride about the country when they list / for they had in this wode away so
sore hedged on both sides / that when they were ryding there could none
aproche to them this Chierbourge is one of the stro^gest castles of the world.
They that were in the garyson of Ualo^ges / were right sore displeased / in
that they could do no damage to the englysshmen / that so haryed the country.
Than sir Olyuer of Clesquy brother to sir Bertram came fro Catyminy / and rode
through y^ wode and aduysed Chierbourg right nere / to thentent to se if there
might be any siege laid thereto. How be it he thought at leest if he might
get the town / the which stood higher than the castle / he should do a
great enterprice. For than he thought he might so fortify the town / that none
should issue out of the castle / but to their great damage Sir Olyuer
perseuered still in this purpose / and took with him a fyftene spears and
guydes / such as could surely bring him through the wodes. And so in a
morning he departed fro Ualonges and came through the woods / till he was
against Chierbourg. And ye same day and time sir Johan Arundell was come in to
the town out of the castle / and a squire of Nauer called Johan Coq with him
/ to the intent to show him the town. And there he herd tidings how the
frenchmen were come thither to advise the place. Sir quod Johan Coq / I have
herd how sir Olyuer of Clesquy / brother to sir Bertram / has past the
wodes: and has aduysed this town. Sir / for god sake let us pursue him. Sir I
warrant to bring you such away that he shall not escape us / but that he
shall fall in our hands: and so they shall be conquered little and little. By
my faith quod sir Johan Arundell I am content. And so they armed them secretly
and took with them a two hundred spears / and so entered in to the wodes where
as the frenchmen rode the same day / and knew nothing each of other. And when
sir Olyuer had well aduysed the town / the which he saw was right strong:
and in a place impossyble to be besieged. Than he withdrue and took the way
toward Ualo^ges / the same way he came. And he had not rydden the space of
two leages / but that sir Johan Arundell and Johan Coq came straight on them /
they were so well gyded: and cried on the^ our lady of Arundell. When sir
Olyuer herd that cry / and saw them ready to mete him / he wysshed him self
again in Ualonges. Than^e he mounted on a good courser / thynking to save him
self by ^^eynge: for he saw well there was no time nor place to sight / for
his advantage. So his men entered in to the thycke of the wood / some here some
there they wist not whyder: but a few of them kept together. Johan Coq like a
valyant man of arms / followed in the chase after sir Olyuer so nere / that
finally he took him prisoner / and a ten or.xii. other were there taken: and the
resydue saved them self in the woods / and so gate to Ualonges when they
might. And there showed sir Wylliam of Bordes and his company / how they had
spedde by reason of a busshement / and how sir Olyuer of Clesquy was taken /
whereof all they that were there were soore displeased / howbeit they could not
amend it. Than sir Olyuer was led in to the castle of Chierbourg / and he
was showed how he should pay for his ransom.x. thousand frankes. These
tidings were anon known both in England and in France / and so the matter
abode still long in the same estate.

SIr Olyuer of Clesquy was prisoner a long season in Chierbourge / in the
keeping of Johan Coq of Nauer / who took him. yet sir Johan of Arundell had the
profit. And afterward sir Olyuer made fynance for himself / and for all
those that were taken with him but it was a long space first. And when the
garrison of Chierbourg* was well refresshed / than sir Johan Arundell departed
and went again to* Hampton / whereof he was captain. There abode still in
Chierdourg with sir John^ Harlston captain there / diverse knights of
England: as sir John^ Coplande / sir John^ Bulle / sir Thom^s Bygorne / and
diverse other knights and squyers. And they and other took so good head to the
fortress that it took no damage.

Now let us leave to speak of Chierbourc till time come thereto again / and
let us speak of sir Johan Neuyll seneshall of Burdeaulx / and of his company /
sir Thomas Tryuet and other / and how they perseuered.

How the child of Castle and the spanyerdes lay at siege before Panpilone /
and of such castelles as the englysshmen conquered out of the frenchmens
hands. Ca. CCC.xxxviii.
THe lord Neuyll being at Burdeur was well entourmed how the child of
Castle with a great nombre of spanyerdes had laid siege to the good town of
Pa^pylone / and the vycont of Chastellon / the lord of Lescute / and Raymon of
Ramesen and diverse other were within. and they could here no certain troynges
of the king of Nauer whereof they had marueyle / but they supposed shortly to
here fro him. The cou^tremen of Burdeaur and there about / desired the lord
Neuyll not to depart out of the country / nor to suffer none of his men of
war to deperte / as long as the frenchmen had any fortresses in the coutre.
And specially they co^playned of the fortress of Bersat / the which they
said did ^oche (...)we in the country. Than the lord Neuyll demanded what
nombre of bretons they were within Bersatte / and it was showed (...) five
hundred fightyng men. Than he called to him the seneshall of Lands and sir
Wyllyam Scrope / and said: sirs take with you a two or three hundred spears
and as many archers / and go your way and look on them of Bersat / and do
somoche as to deliver the country of the^ and than we shall attend to a
greatter matter. The two knights would not disobey / but so took two hundred
spears and as many archers and passed the river of Garon / and so rode toward
Bersat. And ye same season they of Bersat were ^^te abroad rydinge / to the
nombre of (...) corespeares all a long the river of Garon / to the^tent to se
if they might find any ship. and their captain was one of Pyergourt called
sir Bertram Raymon / a good man of arms: and so within a litell leage of
Bersat they encountered the englysshmen. And when this sir Bertram saw that he
must needs fight / he was affrayed: but ordered his men in good array / they
were nere all gascoyns. And so the englysshmen came on them with their spears
couched and spurs to their horses. And at the first coming there were diverse
overthrown of both parties and many a feate of arms done Now b^it finally
the frenchmen could not endure thenglysshmens deeds also they were mo (...)
nombre and chosen men. In somoch that all they of the garyson of Bersat were
slain or taken / but few that escaped. And there was taken sir Bertram Raymon /
and sir wyllm^ Hemon / and than they rode to Bersat. And wha^ they of the
garrison saw that there men were taken and slain they were sore abashed / and
so gave up the forteresse their lives saved. So thus Bersat became englisshe
and than they returned to Burdeur. The same day was ye night of Alsayntes / ye
year of our lord. M. CCC.lxxviii. that the^glysshmen entered in to Bersat / and
the same day the king of Nauer came to Burdeux or any man wist. And he was
received right honorably and well lodged at his ease / and all his men. And
than he was demanded of the tidings in his country and of the spanyerdes: and
he answered plainly ye the child of Castle had besieged Pa^pylone with great
puyssance / so that they yt were within the cite were sore constrained. Tha^ he
desired the^ acordyng to ye apoyntment made by the king of England / that they
would help to confort his people / and to reyse the siege. The knights of
England offered themself and said / how they were in good mind so to do / so
ye by their neglyge^ce the siege should not be vnreysed / and so ordained
therefore and said to the king. sir return you into yor own country / and make
a spiall asse^bly of yor men / and we shallbe there at a day appointed and let us
assemble together / and so we shabe the stronger. your men also know the
country better than ours do / He answered and said. ss ye say well: and thus it
shall be done. And so the third day after he departed and took the way by the sea side. For there was about Bayon and Dare in Gascone / certain fortresses
holden by the bretons. So long the king of Nauer rode yt he came to the town
of saint Johans / and there he abode. In the mean season while the king of
Nauer made his vyage to Burdeux / and tarried there and returned again. John^
of Castle son to the king of Spain / and the constable of the realm of
Castle / who were chief of that war / who was called Dome Peter of Moriche.
They held thesiege before Panpylone / with a great nombre under them. With
them there was therle Done Alphons / therle of Medyna / therle of Manos therle
of Ribydie / Peter Ferant of Salesque / and Peter Gousart of Modesque and
diverse other knights and squiers of Castle. And the spanyerdes as they came
toward Panpylone they had taken and brent the town of Lornich and the city
of Uyen beside Groynge. There was never a lord in Nauerr that durst apere
before the^ / but every man kept his own hold. All this knew rightwell ye
king of Nauer / for always he had messangers coming and going but he could not
remedy it without ye help of the^glishmen. ye lord Neuyll who was at burdeur
sent thither by the king of England and hiss counsel. He knew rightwell the
liage and a lya^ce that was made between the kings of England and of Nauer /
yet he faynted and was slack in the acomplysshing thereof. All this he thought
in him self / and so called to him sir Thomas Tryuet a right valyant knight /
and said: sir Thom^s ye know well how we were sent hyder to take heed of the
fro^ters of this country / and to put out our enemies. And also to comfort ye
king of Nauer / who has been here with us / and has showed us the need that he
has / ye were present when I promised him how we should serve him. wherefore it
behooves us so to do / or else we shall be blamed. Wherefore dear sre^de and lover
/ I ordain you to be chief governor of that war / and that ye take a six
hundred speres and a thousand archers and go into Nauer / and I will abide
here in these marchesse because I am seneshall of Burdeux / and have the charge
thereof committed me by the king of England. And therefore I will take heed of
such adventures as shall fall / for as yet the country is not all rydde of our
enemies. Sir (...) sir Thomas / ye do me more honor than I am worthy / I shall
gladly obey you as it is reason and shall aquyte me in this vyage to the best
of my power. Than the lord Neuell said / sir I am well conforted by that ye
arwylling to go.

wIthin a little space after / sir Thomas Tryuet departed fro Burdeux and took
the way to Dare in Gascoyne / and with him there was sir Wylliam Condone / sir
Thomas Berton / sir John^ Asfull / sir Henry Paul sir Wyllm^ Croquet sir Loys
Malyn / sir Thomas Fourque / and sir Robert Haston all gascons with a great
nombre. When all these men of war were come to the city of Dare / than they
herd tidings that the king of Nauerre was at saint John^s du Pie du port /
and there made his somons of men of war / whereof they were right glad. In
the city of Dare there was a captain an english knight called sir Mathue
Gorney uncle to sir Thom^s Tryuet / who received his nephewe right joyfully and
all his company / and aided to lodge them at their ease. Thentent of sir
Thomas Tryuet was not to have rested / but to have kept on his way to the king
of Nauerr: but than sir Mathewe said. Fire nephue / sytheye be here with such
a puyssaunce / it behooves you to deliver this country of a certain bretons
and french / men / who keeps well a.xii. fortresses between this and Bayone /
for if ye leave them behind you / they will do us this winter much trouble.
and sir if ye do this / the country will can you much thank / and sir I
desire you do it. Sir quod sir Thomas and I will do it. And than he set every
thing in order / and so came before a forteresse called Mountpyn / the which
ye bretons held / and therein was a capitayn a squier of the county of Foyz /
called Tayllerdon. As soon as these men of arms were come thither they made a
sore assaut / and so the fortres was taken / and all that were within slain
except the captain / who was taken prisoner: than the castle was new
furnysshed with new me^. And after they went farther to an other castle /
called Careyllat / kept also by the french gascons. And so these men of war
gave assaute thereto / but they failed at yt assaut of winnynge of it / and so
dislodged. And the next morning they made so feirse assaute ye by force they
wan it / and all slain that were within / except the captain / who was a
breton bretonant and was called yuonet Aprisydie / and he was delivered to the
englysshmen as prisoner / and the castle brent. And than they passed farther /
and came before another fortress called Besenghen / and therein was captain a
squire of Gascoyne called Roger of Morlac. The englysshmen were two days there
or they had it / and that was by treaty so that all that were within deperted
with out damage / and went whyder they list.

THan fro thens they went to Tassegnon a castle sta^dyng a three leages fro
Bayoue / and there laid siege. And when they of Bayone herd how the siege was
laid there / they were right joyful: and so ca^e to the siege a.v. hundred
men of the town with spears and pauesses / and brought with them the greatest
engyn that was in Bayone. They of the fortress had done so much trouble to
them of Bayone / that they desired nothing so much as their dystructyon / but
for all their strength they could not have get it / and the advise and help
of the englysshmen had not ben. They lay there.xv. days or they had it / and
yet when they had it / it was by treaty: so ye all that were wtin went their
way without any damage / and were brought in sauegard to Bregent / which held
of ye french part. Than they of Bayon bought the castle for three. M. frankes
/ and after beat it down / and carried all the stones to Bayone / and there
these men of war were well received / and had every thing that they desired
payeng therefore.

How the spanyerdes departed fro the siege of Pa^pylone / and how the
englysshmen arrived in Nauer: and how they did. Cap. CCC.xxxix.
THe king of Nauer being at saint John^s town / was right sore trobled and
dyspleased in his mind y^ the^glisshmen tarried so long / for his country was
in great perell. Surely the cite of Panpylone had been won by the spanyerdes if
the wisdom and good keeping of the vycont of Chastellon had not ben / who was
capyten there with two. C. spears gascons / but his wise order kept the^ fro
parell. In the town of Tedula in Nauer was captain sir Perducas Dalbret and
in the cite of Myranda / was capiten therle Pulloys / and with him sir Roger
his brother. And in another strong town in Nauer / called Arkes was captain
a knight of Cateloy^e / called sir Raymon of Bageth. In trust of these
capitayns the king of Nauer held him at saint John^s town / but all the
country was wasted and ouerrynne with enemies for none kept the feldes / but
the spanyerdes: and they knew well that at length by long siege the cite of
Panpylone should be won or yielded up but they had no will thereto / for the
vycount of Chastellon / the lord Lescute / wyllm^ of Paur took so good head /
that they feared no danger. So at last the spanyerdes began to ware weary / for
winter drew on about saint Andrews tide and their vitayle began to fail and
ware scante. It had failed sorer / and the vycount of Roquebertyn had not ben /
for he refresshed the^ with threscore summers laden with vitayls / else their
vitayls had failed them by Alhalowtyde Than the king of Nauer sent a knight of
his called sir Peter of Bascle to the englysshmen / prayeng them to make have
for he thought they tarried over long / seeing their promise and his need
together. The knight did so much y^ he came in to the march of Bayone / and
found the englisshmen before a castle called Poula^t / there he did his
message. Than sir Thomas Tryuet said: y^ castle that he lay at / ones won he
would do nothing till he came in to Nauer and so badde the knight on that
promise to return. And than he departed / and the castle within two days
after was given up by treaty and they that were within departed / and the
castle new refresshed with new men. Than the country was well in peace /
how be it there were still little fortresses kept in churches and mynsters /
the which did hurt in the country: but they had no great puyssaunce. So the
englysshmen would tarry no longer / but said they would go in to Nauer and reyse
the sege before Pa^pylone / or else fight with the spanyerdes.

SIr Thomas Tryuet and sir Mathewe Gorney and all their men returned to Dar /
and there tarried four days / and than departed and took the way to Nauer. But
sir Mathewe Gorney returned to Bayone with his own men to keep the country /
and to conquer some small forteresses that the bretons kept. so long sir
Thom^s Tryuet iourneyd / that he ca^e to saint John^s du Py du port / where he
found the king of Nauer / who received them right ioyously. The knights
lodged in the town and the men of war about in the country. Before that time
the king of Nauer had somoned all manner of men to assemble at the cite of
Myra^da. There was none that would resyst against the kings commandment / but
so every man prepared him self to go to Panpylone to fight with the
spanyerdes. Tidings came into the host / how that thenglysshmen with great
puyssance were with the king of Nauer at saint John^s town / to the nombre
of.xx. thousand men of war. Than the capitayns drew together to counsel /
to se what was best for them to do / outher to abide the king of Nauer / orels
to withdraw back. This counsel was long for some of the capitayns would
that the^glisshmen should be byden / and some other said nay / because they
were not strong enough to abide them that were fresshmen / for theymselfe were
sore traueyled by reason of the long siege. And so finally they concluded to
dyslodge and every man to draw to his own country / and the most that
enclyned them to deperte was. There were some valyant knights used marmes said
that it was not against their honor to deperte / co^sydring that king Henry of
Castle being in his own country had sent a.xv. days past / for his son to
break up the siege. So thus y^ spanyerdes dysloged and departed / and set fire
in their lodgings: and so drew toward Groyng and to saint Domynikes in
Castle. And when they within Panpylone saw them depert they were right
joyful / for they had not ben at all times at their ease.

Tidings came to the king of Nauer and to thenglysshmen / being at saint
Johans town how the spanyerdes were all goone in to their own countrees. and
by semyng / they were therwt right sore displeased / for gladly they wolo^ have
fought with the spaynyardes / and so they dyslodged and went toward Panpilon /
and there they found the vicount of Chastellon / the lord Lescute and other /
who received them joyfully. And when they had refresshed them there a two or
three days / than they determined to ^eparte and go and lie in garysons to be
at more large / for the mountayns in Nauer arre right cold in winter / because
of the great snowes. So tha^ it was ordained that the englisshmen should go and
lie at Tudela / and the lord Lescute at Pont de la Royne / and the earl of
Pulloys / and sir Roger his brother to go to Corell and the lord Chastellon to
Mundon. Thus these men of war departed / and the king of Nauer abode still
in Panpylone in his own palys / and the garysons of Nauer were kept in peace
/ without doing of any thing / for in the winter they would not ride abroad:
in like wise all the spanyardes departed / and king Henry went to Cyuell / and
with him his wife and his children. Sir Thomas Tryuet and his company being at
Tudela / remembering how he had done nothing sithe he came in to Nauer / and he
had word by his espyes how the spanyardes were departed and with drawn. Than
he thought to ride toward Spaygne so^ what to enploy his time / and to veserue
his wages. And so secretly he gathered together a certain nombre of men of
arms and archers and he sent word thereof to the earl of Pulloys and to sir
Roger his brother / who came to him with two. C. spears and three hundred
pauesses They assembled together at Tudela / so y^ they were a.vii. C. spears /
and.xii. C. archers / and as many of other brigantes. And so they charged on
summers great plenty of vitayls / and deperted and loged on Christmas even / in
afayre medowe by a ryuersyde / at the foot of the mou^tain called mount Cane /
the which deperted three realms Nauer / Castle / and Aragone. and on y^ other
side of the mou^tayn / was a country called the vale of Sorry: the same day was
a marvelous hot day / for that time of the year.

How the englysshmen and naueroyse ran in to the realm of Spain and of the
pillage that they gat there Cap. CCC.xl.
ANd when they had dyned they went to counsel / to know if they should do
any thing y^ day ornar / because it was Christmas even / seeing they were
entryng in to y^ land of their enemies. Than it was determined that they
should ride at night / so y^ by the morning on Christmas day / they might be
ready to scale y^ city of vale de Sorry. This counsel was kept / and every
man made him ready to the same entente: and it was ordained / that there should
goo to do this enterprice / but three hundred spears: and the resydue with all
the fotemen should lie still there as they lay / till y^ morning / that they had
word how their company had spedde. Therle Pulloys with a. C. speres / and sir
Thomas Tryuet and his company / they had gydes to bring the^ thither: and they
should ^yde in four co^panyes / y^ more secretlyer to do their entprice / and
the more easly to come to their ententes. And so about two hours within night
they armed them and lept a horsbacke and had no tru^pettes / but the capitayns
and gydes knew well where they should mete again. and so they mounted the hill
and were in a fair plain / and suddenly there fell such an hayle and snow /
that it was marueyle / for all the ground was covered with snow: and so they
rode till the morning or they could find each other. This unhappy wether for
the englisshmen / fell well for them in the cite / who took no head of that
bushment / for they were not ware thereof / for if thenglisshme^s apoyntment had
kept at their hour appointed / they had not failed to have won the town.
When sir Thom^s Tryuet saw that he had failed of his purpose / he was sore
displeased in his mind / and so gathered together his company as well as he
might. Than they took new counsel / and so drank and eat a little / and
after dinner which was but short. Sir Raymon of Balgette naueroyse / was
chosen with a forty spears to go and rynne before the town to draw out
some of the genyciens that were within. And so the knight rode before the city
and ca^e to the barryers / and there was a great scrimysshe. For the genyciens
/ who were a two hundred issued out and began to shote / and to cast at the
men of arms / who ever little and little drew back / to bring them farther
of fro the town. They had yuell handled those men of arms / if their
busshme^t had not drawn forward / but they ca^e feirsly with their speres and
struck in among the^ and beat the^ down: many were slayue and driven in to the
town again / to their great ^^mage. Tha^ they closed their barryers and gates
and mounted to the walls / for they wend surely to have had assaut but
the^glysshmen thought to return by day light. And so they returned again to
their lodgyng / where they found the rest of their men / and so lay there that
night. And the next morning which was saint Stepbyns day / they drue to a
town called Quasquam in Normandy. And there they found the king of Nauer who
was come thy^er on Christmas day / but as the englysshmen ^a^e to Quasquam /
the same day they brent certain vyllages / and specially they brent and robbed
a great vyllage / called Nygret.

How the peace was made between the king of Spain and the king of Nauer: and
of the death of king Henry of Spain / and of the coronacyon of Johan his
son. Cap. C C C.xli.
Tidings came to king Hen^y of Castle / who was at Cyuell in ye heart of his
realm: how that the englisshmen had brent the town of the Uale de sorry in
making of war for the king of Nauer / whereof he was sore displeased: and swear
it should be amended. Than he wrote letters to John^ of Castle his son /
that he should make a somons throughout his realm / and to assemble to guyder
the noble men. Saying how he would be shortly in Spain / to revenge him of
the king of Nauer / for the excess that he had done to him. The child of
Castle would not disobey the commandment of the king his father / but sent
out his commandment: and so drew to him all manner of men of war. And in
the same mean season * sir Thomas Tryuet thought to assemble a certain nombre
of men of war / and to go to the town of Alpharo in Spain. And so he did /
and departed in an evening fro Quasquam and fro the king of Nauer / and had
with him but one hundred speres of chosen men of arms. And so by the next
morning they came within a little leage of the town / and there they made
their busshement. And sir Wylliam Sendrine was sent to rynne before the town
and Andrewe Andrac: and with the^ a ten spears. And so they ca^e to a little
river or broke y^ which went straight to the town and so passed it with great
trouble / and Andrewe Andrac made their horses to leap over / and so came to
the barryers. Than there began great noise in the town / and sownyng of
trumpettes. The men of war within the town assembled together and opyned their
gates and barryers and issued all out and so began to scrimysshe / and of the
said ten spears / there were but two of them that was past the river / and so
they returned when they saw the people coming to them ward / and so made
their horses again to leap over the broke. When they of ye town saw there
were so few of their enemies / and knew nothing of the bushment: they followed
fast after / and so past the river a little above / where as they knew the
passage / and so chased the ten spears to their busshment. Than sir Thomas
Tryuet and his company ca^e forth cryeng their cries / and bare many of the^
to the earth. To say truth / y^ spanyerdes could not long endure / and so
returned as well as they might / but there were but few that were saved but
outher they were slain or taken. The fray was great in the town / and
thenglysshmen believed / that at the first coming to have had the town /
because there men were disco^fyted / but they failed of their purpose for ye
women saved the town. For as soon as their men were issued out and were past
the river / they closed their barryers and gates and mounted up to the walls /
and made semblant to defend them self. And when sir Thomas Trivet saw the
order and manner of the^ / he said: behold yonder y^ good wives of the town
what they have done. Let us return again / for we can do nothing there.
And so they returned and passed again the little broke / and so went to
Quesquam and led with them their prisoners. Of the which deed sir Thomas
Tryuet had great thank / laud / and praise of the king of Nauer.

ANd a fyftene days after that they had made this journey before Alpharo / the
spanyerdes came in to the feldes with a twenty thousand horsemen and fotemen /
in great will to fight with the englysshmen. And when the king of Nauer herd
thereof / he came to Tudela / and sir Thomas Tryuet and his company with him.
And than he sent for all them of the garysons of the realm of Nauer to come
to him they would not disobey his commandment / for they desired nothing else.
And the spanyerdes tarried for nothing / but for the coming of king Henry / who
as than was deperted f^o Ceuyll with a great nombre / and so came to saint
Dominykes and there rested and lay in ye field. When Johan of Castle knew that
the king his father was come / than he went fro Alphare to saint Dominykes to
the king his father. the intent of the spanyerdes was to have goone to ley sege
to Tudela / and to have closed in y^ king of Nauer / or to have fought with
him. Of all this the king of Nauer was well informed and knew well he was not
of puyssaunce to abide battle against king Henry / for he had a.xl. thousand
men a horseback and a ^ote.

BItwene king Henry and the king of Nauer there were certain noble men of
both realms / prelates and barons / who ymagined the great parell and damage
that might fall to both parties: if any of them should ^^ee other. Than they
entreated between the perties / to have a respyte of war between them / to
have the more leysar to entreat. And so they took great pain with going and
coming / bytwen the parties / or they could bring about their intent: for the
englisshmen were a two thousand and were feirse against the spanyerdes / and
cou^sayled the king of Nauer to battle. On the other side the spanyerdes were
a great no^bre / wherefore they set but little by thenglysshmen nor naueroyse:
therefore it was hard to bring this treaty to a good effect. They that had
the business thereof took much pain and labor / at last a respyte was taken
between them to endure six wekes / to the^tent in the mean season to entreat
for a full peace. Their intent was to make if they might / a marriage between
the child of Castle / eldest son to king Henry: and the daughter of the
king of Nauer. Whereby the peace should the surelyer co^tynue / to the which
the king of Nauer was well agreed / because his daughter should be so highly
married. And moreover the prelates and barons of both parties / thought also to
mary the king of Nauers son / to king Henryes daughter. In somoche that this
treaty took effect: so that king Henry should send to the french king /
desyringe him to suffer Charles of Nauer / who was in his keeping to come in to
Nauer. And so he did / at his desire the french king sent him. and so for
the performance of this treati^ and marriage / the king of Nauer should ^ay in
pledge for the space of ten year to king Henry / the town and castle of
Lestoyll / the city and castle of Tudela / the town and Castle de la guard.
And that king Henry should yield and render to the englysshmen sir Perse
Courtney / who was prisoner / and the lord of Parre gascoyne. All these
things were done / sealed / confyrmed / accorded and sworn: to be kept stable
and ferme for ever / between these two kings and their realms. And which of
them yt ever should break this peace by any manner of ways should rynne in the
sentence of the pope.

While these treatyes were this in making / the king of Nauer who was bound
to the englysshmen / in ye so^me of.xx. thousand frankes: to acquyte him self
against them. He sent the vycont of Chastelon in to Arragon to the king there
/ to borowe of him the said sum of money. And he to have in pledge therefore /
his good towns of Panpylone / and Myrando / the queen's town / Corell and
saint Johans town. Thus the englysshemen were paid and delivered / and so
departed fro the king of Nauer and went to Bur^eux / and fro the^s in to
England. And y^ marriage was made between Charles of Nauer and king He^rys
daughter called Jane / a right fair lady. The same year dyed king Henry of
Castle / and his son John^ crowned king and so he was king by accord of the
prelates and barons of the realm of Spaygne / of Castle / of Cecyll / of
Galyce / and Candonne: and they all swear to him faith and homage for ever.
Than there began a war between the king of Portyngale and king Johan of
Castle / wh^che endured long / as ye shall here after. Now let us return
to the busynesses of France.

How the lord of La^gurant was wounded to death / and how the captain of
the garyson of Boutuylle was disco^fyted / and the castle yielded up french.
Cap. C C C.xlii.
VE have herd here before: how the lord of Mucydent was turned french /
and was a yer or more at Paris / till at last he was weary: for he had thought
to have ^ounde the french king otherwise to ward him thanne he was / wherefore
he was angrye in his mind / and so repented him self in that he was turned
french. Saying how it was for fear rather tha^ for any other thing. And so
thought to steal fro Paris and to go to his own country / to yield him self
again english: for the service of the king of England pleased him much
better than the service of the french king. And as he had aduysed so he did
/ and gave knowledge to all them that he knew / except his own servants how
he was sick: and kept his lodging. And so in an euenyng he lept on his horse
unknown / and took but three persons with him / and so deperted fro Paris / and
rode toward his own coutre / and his men followed after him little and little.
And so long he rode that he came to Burdeux / and there he found sir Johan
lord Neuyll seneshall of Burdeux / to whom he showed all his adventure / and
so became again english: and said / how he had rather be false of his
faith to the french king / than to his natural lord ye king of England.
Thus the lord Mucydent abode english as long as he lived / whereof the duke
of Aniou was sore displeased / and said and swear that if ever he could get him
/ he should lose his heed. Whereof the lord Mucydent was well enfourmed / and
thought to keep him self right well out of danger.

ALl this season the lord of Langurante was still french / who was an expert
knight and did much hurt and trouble / to such lands as parteyned to such
lords as were beco^e english. As the lord of Rosen / the lord of Duras /
and the lord of Mucydent / wherewith these three lords weresore displeased and
so set all their minds how they might slay him / for he was utterly their
enemy. this lord of La^gurant rode forth on a day with a.xl. spears and came
nere to an english forteresse / called Cadylhatte: of the heritage of the
Captall of Beufz / and his brethren gascoyns. And so the lord Lagurant made
there abusshment of his company / and said. Sirs / tarry you still here: and I
will go and ride to yonder forteresse alone / and se if any will issue out
against us. And so he rode forth and came to ye barryers of the castle / and
spoke to the kepars / and demanded where was Bernard Courant their captain
and said: show him how the lord Langurantis here / and desires to Just
with him a course: if he be so good a man / and so valyant in arms as it is
said / he will not refuse it for his ladies sake. if hedo / it shall turn
him to much blame. For I shall repute whersoeuer I go / that for cowardnesse /
he has refused to ryn with me / one course with a spear. than a squire of
Bernardes answered / and said. Sir Langurant / I have well herd your words.
Sir / and ye will suffer a little / I shall go and speak with my master. Ifye
will abide / I warrant you / there shall be no reproach in him of cowardnesse. I
will tarry quod the lord of Langurant. Than the squire went / and found his
master in a chamber / and there showed him all the words: as ye have herd
before. And when Bernard herd that / his heart began to swell for pre: and
said. Get me my harness / and sadell my horse: he shall not go refused. Than
incontinent he was armed and mounted on his horse / and took his targe and his
spear / and opyned the gate and the barryers / and issued out in to the field.
And when the lord Langurant saw him coming he was reioysed / and couched his
spear like a good knight / and so did Bernarde: and dasshed to their horses.
They were both well horsed / and they hytte so even both that there sheldes
fell in pieces: and in the passing by / Bernarde sholdred sir Langurantes horse
in such wise: that the lord fell out of the sadell. And when Bernard saw him
on ye earth he was right joyful / and turned shortly his horse to him. and as
the lord Langurant was risynge up / Bernarde who was a bygge and a valyant
squire / took him by the bassenet with both his hands / and drew it so sore
to him / y^ he raised it of his heed / and so did cast his bassenet under his
horse fete. The lord of Langurantes men being in the busshement / saw all
this. And than they brake out / and were coming to rescue their master and
lord / and Bernard who saw the^ coming / drew out his dagger and said to
the lord Langurant. Sir / yield you my prisoner: rescue or no rescue / or else
ye are but deed. The lord Langurant / who trusted on the rescue of his men
spoke not a word again. And when Bernarde saw y^ / he was enflamed with
feruentyre: and douted leest he should lose the more for ye less / and so
struck the lord Langurante on the heed / which was all bare: in such wise /
that he brake the skoll in to the brain. And than he dasshed to his horse /
and entered in to the barryers / and than a lyghted and made him ready to defend
him self ifnede were. And when the lord Langurantes men were come to him /
and found him wounded to death / they were right soroufull: and so took and
carried him as well as they might in to his own castle / but the next day after
he dyed. Thus it befell that season of the lord Langurant.

THe same season there was a deed of arms done in Rocheloys. For Helyot of
Playsac / a gentle squire and a valiant man of arms / captain of Boutuyll
/ an english garyson of sixscore spears english and gascoyns. Who pylled
sore the country / and ran nigh every day before the town of Rochell / or
else before the town of saint John^s Dangle / And they held these two towns
in such fear and doubt / that they durst not issue out but by stelth /
whereof the knights and the squyers of the country were right sore displeased.
and thought one day to provide for remedy / or else to be slain or taken by
their enemies in the field. And so on a day they assembled in the town of
Rochell / about two hundred spears: for that was the town that most comenly
Helyot of Playsac and his company did most hurt unto. there were of Poyctou
and of Xaynton / the lord of Thowars / the lord of Puissa^ce / sir James of
Surgeres / Percyuall of Coloygne / sir Raynolde of Gomers / sir Hugh of Uynon
and diverse other knights and squyers / having great desire to fight with their
enemies. And these capitayns knew by their spies / that Helyot of Playsac was
abroad / and was coming to apere before Rochell / to get there some pray.
Than all these lords and knights went out of Rochell in the euenyng / well
armed and on horseback: and so took the feldes. And at their depertyng / they
ordained that in the next morning / they should put out in to the feldes all
their catell at adventure: and it was done as they deuysad. And in the next
morning Helyot of Playsac and his company came before Rochell to the barryers /
and some of their company gadered together all the catell they could find: and
made them to be driven by them of the country before them. And they had not
driven this catell the space of a leage / but that the frenchmen a.ii. C.
spears came suddenly on them on a wyng / of whom the englisshmen were not
ware: and so came in at the spears points among the^. so at their first
metynge there were many cast to ye earth. Than Helyot of Playsac said / a foot
a foot every man. Let us not natflye / and let our horses go / if the day be
ours we shall have horses ynowe / and if it be against us / we shall have but a
small loss of our horses. There Helyot and his company a lighted a foot / and
put the^self in good order. In likewise so did the frenchmen for they feared
the sleyng of their horses. There was a sore battle and long endured / for
they fought hand to hand. there was done many feats of arms / many a one taken
and rescued again. Finally the poicteuyns and xayntons had the vytorie / and
their enemies disco^fyted and nighe all slain or taken / but a few that
escaped. and the pray of catell again rescued: and Helyote of Playsac taken
prisoner and led to Rochell. Anon after this adventure these lords of France
went to the castle of Boutuyll / which was anon taken / for it was easy
enough to win for there was none within to make any defense. Thus was the
castle of Botuyll french / where of all the country had great joy: and Helyot
of Plaisac was prisoner a long space after.

How the french kings messanger was let of his vyage in to Scotla^de: and of
the debate that began between the french king and therle of Flaunders. Cap.
CCC.xliii.
IN the same season returned in to England / sir Thomas Tryuet and sir
Wyllyam Helman / with diverse other knights and squyers such as had been in
Spain to aid the king of Nauers war. And so they ca^e to the king of
England / who as than was at Chertsay and his two uncles / the duke of
Lancastre and therle of Cambridge with him. And these knights were joyfully
received / of the king and these lords: and there they were desired to show
some tidings fro those parties. And so they showed all y^ they knew / both
of Spain and of Nauer / and of the peace made between the two kings / of
spain and Nauer. And how the king of Nauer had married Charles his eldest
son / to king He^ryes daughter: and so fro point to point as the treaty was
between the^. The duke of Lancastre and therle of Cambridge were right pe^syfe
of those words / for they thought and named them self to be heirs of Spain
/ by right of their wives. Than they demanded how long it was sith king Henry
the bastard dyed / and whider the spanyerdes had crowned John^ his son^e or
no. The knights answered / and said. (...): at the death of king Henry / nor
at the cocona^yon of Johan his son / we were not present / for by that time
we were come back in to Nauer. But sir / here is an haraude was there present
/ ye may know every thing by him / and it please you. Thau ye heralde was
called forth and demanded by the duke of Lancastre how the matter was. He
answered / and said. Sir: at your request I shall she we you. In ye mean
season while these noble me^ were at Pa^pylone abiding the acomplysshment of
the treaty / the which was made by their good wylles and leaves. I tarried
behind still with the king of Na^er / where as I had good chere / both of him
and of his men. And so I went with him fro Pa^pylone to saint Domynikes /
against whose coming / king Henry issued out of the town with a goodly
company / and met us with great sign of love and peace. And there the king of
Nauer was greatly honored by him and all his / and gave him the same night an
honest supper. and after supper tidings was brought to them / how that a
great wild Boore was lodged in the laundes thereby. And so it was ordained /
that the next morning they should go and hunt the same Boore / and so they
did. at which huntyng there was both kings / and a great company and the
boore taken. and against night they returned again with great love to saint
Domynikes. And the next day king Henry departed and went to Peter Ferando / for
a day that he had there against his men: and there he fell sick and so dyed.
And the king of Nauer was coming to ward him / to se him there: and by the way
he herd word of his death / whereof he was right sorry / and so returned
again. and than I took leave of him and went in to Castle / to know some
tidings there. This king Henry dyed on Whitsonday. And anon after the.xxv. day
of July / the day of saint James and saint Christofer / Johan of Castle his
eldest son was crowned king in the cathedral church / in the city of
Burgus. At the which coronacion were all the barons and prelates of Spaygne /
of Galyce / of Cordowayne / and of ^euyll. And all they swear there on the holy
e^a^gelystes / to take and mentayne him for their king. And there was made the
same day / two hundred and ten new knights / and many a great gift given.
The next morning with a great company of noble men / he went to an abbey of
ladies without Burgus / called ^urches. And there he herd mass and dyned /
and after dinner there was great iustyng and the vycont of Roq^bertyn of Arragon
had the price / and than he returned again to Burgus. And this feast
endured.xv. days. Than the duke of Lancaster enquered if the king of
Portingale was desired to be there ornat. Sir quod the heraud / he was desired /
but for all that he was not there / nor would not come thither. And as it was
said he answered the messanger that came to him / how he would not go to the
coronacyon of the son^e of a bastard. By my faith quod the duke of Lancastre
/ he was rightwell counsayled / to say these words I can him great thank
therefore. I trust the matter shall not long abide in that case. For my brother
and I will demand that heritage / whereof he calls him self king us now.
And so they left talking and called for drink. Now let us leave to speak
of this matter / and return to the busynes of France.

KIng Charles of France who as than reigned / was right sage and subtell / and
that was well showed as long as he lived. For tho that he kept him self preuy
in his chamber / taking his pleasure and sport. yet he conquered again / that
his predecessors had lost in the field / armed with their swerdes in their
hands wherefore he was greatly to be commended. And because he knew well yt
king Robert of Scotland / and all the realm there had made war / and had
mortal hate to the^glysshmen / for those two realms could never love together.
Therefore to the intent to norisshe more love between France and Scotland. The
french king thought to send a knight and a secretary of his counsel to
king Robert of Scotland / and to y^ scotts / to speak with the^ / and to
advise the country. And to know if he might make any good war to England
by Scotland. For yuan of Wales in his life time had enfourmed him / that
Scotland was the place in ye world whereby England might be most anoyed. And
of this purpose the french king had many ymaginacio^s. so that at last he
ordained a knight a sage man called sir Peter lord of Bournesell / and said to
him. Sir / ye shall go and do this message in to Scotland / and reco^mende me
to the king there / and to his barons. And show h^^ how that we and our
realm are ready to do the^ pleasur / and to have a treaty with them as our
friends. So that thereby in the season to come / we may send people thither /
whereby we may have enter in to England that way / in like manner as our
predecessors have had in time past. and in your going thither and coming
homewarde / I will ye keep such estat^ as a messager and co^missary of (...)ng
should do: on our cost and charge. sir quod the knight all shall be as it
pleases you / and so he tarried not long after / but wha^ he was ready departed
fro Paris / and did so much by his iourneys / that he came to Scluse in
Flanders / and there tarried and abode for wind and passage a.xv. days / for
y^ wind was contrary for him. And in the mean season he held a great estate /
and well stuffed with vessel of gold and silver through out his hall as
largely / as though he had been a little duke or better. His mynstrels played
before his service daily / and bare as werde garnisshed with gold and silver /
and his men paid well for every thing. Of the great estate yt this knight
kept in his house and in the streets / dy^ers of the town had great marueyle.
The bailey of y^ town beheld it well / who was officer there under the earl of
Flaunders / and could keep it no longer secret / wherein he did yuell. For he
sent word thereof to the earl / who lay at Bruges / and the duke of Bretayne
his cosyn with him. And when therle of Flaunders had studied a little on the
matter / and by y^ help of the duke of Bretayne / ordained that the knight
should ^e brought to him. The baylye returned again to Sluse / and came
vncurtesly to the french knight for he set his hand on him / and rested him in
the earl of Flanders name. Whereof the knight had great marueyle / and said to
ye bailey. What means this? I am a messanger and comyssary of the french
king. sir quod the bailey I believe well. howbeit ye must needs go and speak with
therle of Flaunders / for he has commanded me to bring you to him. so the
knight could make no scuse / but that he and his company were brought to Bruges
to therle. And when he was in the earls chamber / therle and the duke stood
together / leanyng out of a wynd^we into the garden ward. Than the knight
kneled down / and said. sir / behold here is your prisoner. Of the which
word the earl was sore displeased / and said in dispyte and ire. what say
y^ rybaude? that thou art my prisoner / because I have sent to speak with the.
Thy masters servants / may right well come and speak with me. But thou have
not well acquyted thy self / sithe thou have ben so long at Scluse / and
knowing me here so nere to the: and yet not to come ones to se or to speak
with me. Thou had disdain so to do. sir quod the knight saving your
displeasure. Than the duke of Bretayne took the words / and said. Among you
bourders and ia^glers / in the palys of Paris / and in the kings chamber. ye
^ette by the realm as ye list / and play with the king at your pleasure and
do well oryuell as ye will yourselfe. for there is no price of ye blood ryall /
if ye among you have ones brought him in to any hate or displeasur with the
king / that can be herd after. But ones I trust there will be so many of such
people taken / that the gybettes will be full of them. The knight who sa^styll
on his knees / was right sore abashed of those words / for the hearing of
such words was right hard to him. Howbeit he saw well it was better for him
to keep his tongue than to speak / and so gave no answer to those words And
when he saw his time / he took his leave of therle and of the lords / and
departed out of their presence. and some noble men that were about the earl
made him way / and made him to drink: and than he returned again to Sluse to
his logyng. And I shall show you what f^ll after. Though all his purueyance
were ready aparelled / and that he had wynd at will to have sailed into
Scotla^de / yet he durst not put himself into the dangers of the sea. For it
was showed him / how he was spyed by the^glysshmen y^ he lay at Scluse / and
how that if he kept on his voyage / he was likely to be taken and carried into
England. and because of those doutes he brake his vyage and returned to Paris
to the king. ye may well know / that the lord of Burnesell told no less to
the french king / than was done to him by the earl of Flaunders. And also it
was needful for him to tell all for his excuse / for the king had marueyle of
his retonrnyng. The same season there were diverse knights in the kings
chamber / and specially sir John^ of Guystels of Heynalt / cosyn to therle of
Fla^nbers / who had great displeasure at the words of this knight / that he
had of therle of Fla^ders. so y^ finally he could keep his tongue no le^ger /
but said. I can not suffer these words thus to be spoken of my dear lord. And
sir knight / if ye will say that he did as ye say / to let you of your vyage /
in that quarrel I appele you to the field: and here is my gage. The lord of
Bournesell was nothing abashed to answer / but said. sir Johan I say thus /
how I was thus taken by the bailey of Sluse / and brought before the earl of
Flanders: and as ye have herd he said to me / and in likewise so did the
duke of Bretayne. And if ye will say contrary / to this I will receive your
gauge. I will say so quod the lord of Guystelles. With those words the king
was not content / and said. Let us go hens / I will here no more of these
words / and so de^ted (...) went (...) to his cha^r^ all only with his
cham(...) right (...) at the lord of Bu^^^ll had ^o well and freely spoken
against y^ words of (...) John^ of Guystels: and said all smylyng. He has
holden foot well with him / I would not for xx. M. frankes but that he had done
so. And after it fortuned so / y^ this sir Johan of Guystels who was
cha^berlayn with the king / was so yuell beloved in the court / that he was
weary thereof: and thought not to abide the dangers. So he took leave of the king
/ and departed fro the court / and went into Brabant to the duke Uy^^elant of
Braba^t / who received him toyfully. The french king was sore displeased with
therle of Fla^ders / because it was thought by ^yuers of the realm / yt he had
let y^ lord of (...)sell of his ^^age in to Scotland. and al^o in that he
^eloe still about him the duke of Bretayne his cosyn / who was greatly in y^
kings displeasur. and so they that were about the king p^rceyued well / how
the earl of Flaunders was nothing in the kings grace.

Anon after the king wrote sharp letis to his cosyn the earl of Flanders /
thretnyng him: because he sustained with him the duke of Bretayn / who^ he
reputed to be his enemy. The earl wrote again to the king / excusing himself
as well as he might: but it aueyled nothing. For the king sent him again more
sharper letters / showing him plainly / yt without he would put the duke of
Bretayne out of his company he would surely displease him. wha^ therle of
Flanders saw that the king pursued his cause with such effect / than he took
advise in him self / and thought he would show these ma^a^^ h^s and
thretnynges to his good towns / and specially to Gau^t / to know what they
would say to the matter. and so he sent to Bruges / to ^pre / and Cortrey / and
after departed / and the duke of Bretayne in his company. and so went to Gaunt
and lodged at y^ posterne / where he was ^oyfully received of the burgesses /
for they lo^ed well to have him among them. And (...)han the people of the good
towns such as were sent for were come: therle assembled them together in a
pleace / and there he made be showed to the^ by John^ de la Faucell his entency
on / and the lett^^s reed that the french king had sent him two months
before. And when these letters were re^^: than the earl spoke and said. All ye
sirs of my good towns of Flanders / through y^ help of god I have been your
lord a long season / and I have kept and governed you in good peace to my
power. Nor ye have not seen in me(...) contrary / but that I have entertained
you in great prosperyte / in like manner as a lord ought to keep his men and
subgettes. But it is to my great displeasur and it ought to be to you that are
my men / that the french king thus hates me and will hate because I sustain
about me and in my company / the duke of Bretayne my cosyn germayne / who as
now is not well-beloved in France. Nor he dare not well trust his men in his
own country / because of five or six barons that loves him not. Wherefore the
king would that I should drive him out of my country / the which should be a
strong thing to him. I say not nay / but if I did confort my cosyn: outher
with towns or castelles against the realm of France / than the king might
have good cause to complain him of me. But I do not so / nor am not in will so
to do: and therefore I have here assembled you together / showing you the parels
that may hap to fall. therefore I would know your minds / whyder he shall
abide still with me or not. They answered all with one voice. Sir / let him
abide still / why should he not? And sir / if there be any man living that will
make you war / ye shall find ready in your land of Flanders.ii. C. M. men
of war to serve you. Those words greatly reioysed therle and said. sirs I
thank you / and so ended that parlyament / and therle was well content with
his men / and gave every man leave to deperte in peace. Than when the earl saw
his time he returned to Bruges / and the duke of Bretayne with him. Thus these
matters hanged in a trance. the earl was in great grace with his people / and the
country in peace and prosperity the which abode not so long after. for it was
in great trybulacion / as ye shall here after in this history.

How the duke of Bretayne deperted out of Flanders / and how therle of saint
Poule was taken prisoner / and how he was married in England: and of the
wars that fell than in Bretayne. Cap. CCC.xliiii.
YE may well know / how the french king had knowledge of all this matter / and
how the earl had answered. He loved him not one whyt the better / how be it
he must let it pass / for more he coud not have as at that time / and said:
how therle of Flanders / was the most proudest prince that he knew. And a
man might have seen well by the manner of the king / that the earl was the lord
that the king would most gladly have brought somewhat to reason. When he saw
that he withsayd him / and that he was no more displeased tha^ he was. the earl
of Flaunders for all the kings writing / and that he was in his great
displeasur / because of keeping about him the duke of Bretayne. yet y^ not
withstanding / he kept him still as long as it pleased him to tarry / and made
him keep a goodlye estate. finally the duke of Bretayne had counsel to draw
in to England / and so he took leave of therle his cosyn and went to
Grauellyng. and thither came to him the earl of Salisbury with five. C. spears
/ and a thousand archers / for dout of the french garysons / and so brought
him to Calais / whereof sir Hugh Caurell was captain / who received him right
ioyously. and when the duke had tarried there a five days he had wind at will /
and so took the sea / and the earl of Salisbury in his company. and so aryued
at Dover / and came to the young king Richard / who received him with great
joy. And so did also the duke of Lancastre / and therles of Cambridge and of
Buckynghame / and the great lords of England.

ye have herd before: how sir Ualeran of Lusenburge / young earl of saint Poule
was taken prisoner / between Arde and Calays / and was in England at the
kings pleasure / for king Edward in his life time / bought him of the lord of
Gomegines for he was first his prisoner / because he made the journey when he
was taken / of a squier a man of arms of the country of guerles. So this young
earl of saint Poule / abode long prisoner in England or he was delivered. It
was of truth the king offered him often times in excha^ge for the captall of
Bu^z while he lived / but the french king nor the counsel of France would in
no wise here thereof / whereof y^ king of England had great disdain. Thus the
^ater co^tynued a long space / and the young earl still prisoner in England /
in the fair castle of Wynsore. and he had so curtesse a kepar that he might
go and sport him a haukyng / between Wynsore and Westminster: he was believed on his
faith. The same season the princess / mother to king Richard lay at Wynsore
/ and her daughter with her: my lady Maude: the fairest lady in all England.
therle of saint Poule and this young lady were in true amors together each of
other / and sometime they met together at daunsynge and carollyng / till at last
it was spyed. And than the lady discovered to her mother / how she loved
faithfully the young earl of saint Poule. Than there was a mary age spoken of /
between therle of saint Poule / and the lady Maude of Holande. and so therle
was set to his rau^some to pay sixscore. M. fra^kes / so that when he had
married the lady Maude / than to be rebated / threscore thousand: and the other
threscore thousand to pay. And when this couynant of marriage was made /
bitwene therle and the lady: the king of England suffered the earl to repasse
the sea to fetch his ransom / on his only promise / to return again
within a year after. So the earl came in to France to se his friends: y^ king
/ therle of Flaunders / the duke of Brabant and his cosyns in France. In the
same year there was made an hard informacyon against the earl of saint Poule /
for it was laid to his charge / that he should deliver to thenglysshmen the
strong castle of Bohaygne. and so the french king caused him to be rested /
and kept in surety: and so the king showed / how therle of saint Poule would
have made an yuell treaty for him and for the realm / and the earl in no wise
could be excused. And also for the same cause / there was kept in prison in
the castle of Mons in Heynaulte / the lord Chanon of Robersarte / the lord
of Uertayne / sir James Dusarte / and Gerarde Dabyes / but at length all that
matter came to none effect / for there could nothing be proved against them /
and so they were delivered. than the young earl returned again in to England
/ to acquyte him of his promise / and so wedded the lady: and did so much /
that he paid his threscore thousand frankes / and so passed again the sea.
But he entered not in to France because the king loved him not. And so he and
the countess his wife went and lay at the castle of Han on the river of Ewre.
The which castle the lord of Mor^ane / who had wedded his suster / lent
him to lie in. And there he lay / as long as king Charles of France lived /
for the earl could never get his love.

Now let us leave to speak of this matter and return to the business of
France.

THe same season all Bretayne was kept close / what against the french king
and against the duke. How beit some of the good towns of Bretayn held them
self close in the dukes name / and many had great marueyle y^ they took him
for their lord. And also diverse knights and squyers of Bretayne were of the
same acorde. And also there was alyed to them the countess of Ponthyeute /
mother to the children of Bretayne. But sir Bertram of Clesqui constable of
France / ye lord Clysson / the lord de Lauall / the vycont of Rohan / and
the lord of Rochfort. They held the country in war with the puyssance that
came daily to the^ out of France. for at Pontorson at saint Malo they will and
there about / lay a great nombre of men of arms of France / of Normandy / of
Auuergne / and of Burgoyne: who did much hurt in the country. The duke of
Bretayne who was in England had knowledge of every thing / and how the duke
of Aniou was at Angers and daily distroyed his country. Also he had knowledge
how ye good towns kept the^ self close in his name / and certain knights
and squyers of the same part / whereof he conde them good thank. yet not that
withsta^dyng / he durst not well trust in them / to ieoparde to return in to
Bretayne on the trust of his men: for always he douted of treason. Also the
king of England nor the duke of Lancastre / would not counsel him to
return.

Of the rencounters that were made in Normandy / and how Geffray Tetenoyre and
Amergot Marcell and their co^panyes took diverse castelles in Auuergne. Cap.
CCC.xlv.
IN Normandy and in Burgoyne there were in garyson / sir Wylliam of Burdes / who
was chief capiten there / and in his company ye little seneschall of Ewe / sir
Wylliam Marsell / sir Braq^ of Braquemont / the lord of Torcy / sir Percyuall
Danyuall / the begue of Dury / sir Lau^celot of Lorrys / and diverse other
knight and squiers of the french party. And night and day they ymagined /
how they might do damage to them of Chierbourg / whereof sir John^ Harlston was
captain. and they of the garyson of Chierbourg issued out often times when it
pleased the^ for when they list they might ride out in couerte / and no man
preuy to their issuynge out / because of the great wodes that were nere to the^
/ wherein they had made such a way that they might ride in to Normandy at their
pleasure / without danger of any frenchemen. And so it fortuned in the same
season / that the french men rode abroad / and they of Chierbourge in
likewise / none of them knowing of other. and so by adventure they met each
other / at a place called Pastoy in the ^ode. Than like valyant knights /
desyringe to fight each with other a lighted a foot all / except sir
Launcelotte of Lorrys / who sat still on his horse / his spear in his hand /
and his shield about his neck / and there demanded a course of iustyng for his
ladies sake. There were there that rightwell understood him / for there were
knights and squiers of the english part in amors / as well as he was. And
as I understood / sir Johan Coplande a right hardy knight went to him / and so
they ran together / and rudely encou^tred each other. But thenglysshe knight
gave sir Lau^celot such a stroke on his shield / that the spear pearsed
throughout his body / and so was wounded to death: the which was great damage /
for he was a hardy knight young and ioly / and right amorous / and his death was
sore complained both there and else where. Than the englisshemen and frenchemen
encountered together / and fought hand to hand. There were good knights on the
french part / as sir Wylliam of Burdes / the little seneshall of Ewe / sir
Willm^ Marsell / sir Braque of Braquemont / and diverse other who fought right
valyantly. And also the englyshmen there fought that day valiantly / sir Johan
Harlston / sir Philypart Picourde / sir John^ Burle / sir John^ Coplande / and
diverse other. And so finally by good fightyng the englisshmen had the vyctorie
/ and all their enemies knights and squyers taken and slain / specially a
squire of Heynalt called Wylliam of Beauleu and sir Wyllm^ of Burdes were
taken. So the prisouers were brought to Chierbourge / and there they found sir
Dlyuer of Clesquy who was taken prisoner. Thus it fell of this journey as I was
informed. Also in Auuergne and Limosyn there fell daily feats of arms / and
marvelous enterprices. and specially of ye castle of mount Ue^tadore in
Auuergne / the which was one of the strongest castles in all ye country / the
which was betrayed and sold to a breton / the most oruell knight of all
other / called Geffray Tetenoyre / I shall show you how it was. The earl of
Tentadore and of Mountpeser was a right ancient knight and a good peasable man
/ who ocupyed no more the war / but kept him still in his house. This earl
had a squire with him / called Pouns de Boys / who had served him long: and
had but a small lyueng or profit by his service. and he saw well / he should
have but a little profit by his master. Than there ran in his thought an
ungracious devise / for he went and made a secret treaty with this Geffray
Tetenoyre / who was in Limosyn / how that he would deliver him the castle of
Uentadore / for.vi. M. frankes. But he made in his covenant / yt they should do
none yuell to his master therle of Uentadore / but to put him out of the
castle in courtesse manner / and his good with him. And so it was done: for the
bretons nor englisshmen that entered did no manner of hurt to the earl nor to
none of his men / nor kept nothing saving vitayle and artyllary / whereof there
was great ple^tie. And so the earl / his wife / and his children / went to
Mountpeser beside Agueperse in Auuergne. And Geffray Tetenoyre and his company
kept Ue^tador / whereby they did much hurt in the country. and so took diverse
strong castles in Auuergne / in Rouergue / in Limosin in Quercy / in Gynalda /
in Bygore / and in Agenoise. and with this Tetnoyre there were other capitayns /
who did many other feats of arms. as Amergot Marcell / a squire of Lymosyn
of thenglisshe part / who took the strong castle of Casuryell in Auuergne /
in the bysshopryke of Cleremont / and they ouerrant the country at their
pleasure. And of the same company there were other capitayns of diverse castles /
as the Bourge Calart / the Bourge Angloys / the Bourge of Champayne / Raymonde
de Fore gascoyne / and Peter of Bearne in Bearnoys.

AMergot Marcell rode forth on a season / and.xiii. with him at adventure /
and took ye way to Aloys to ward saint Flower / the which was a fair castle
in the bysshoprike of Cleremont. They knew well yt the place was not kept /
but by the porter all only. and when they ca^e nere to ye castle / Amergot
saw where the porter sat on a block without the gate. than a breton who could
shote well with a cross bow / said. sir / will ye that I slay the porter at ye
first shote. ye quod Amergot I require the. the breton shot a quarrel and
struck the porter right in the heed / the porter when he felt him self
stryken entered in to the gate / thinkyng to have closed it but he could not:
for in thentryng he fell down deed. than Amergot and his company made have to
enter / and so entered in at the wycket / and there they found the porter deed
/ and this wife by him right sore afraid / to whom they did no hurt / but
they demanded of her where was the captain. and she answered and said / how
he was at Cleremo^t. Than they assured her life / so she would deliver the^ the
keys of the castle / and of the master tower / and so she did: and than they
put her out with asmoche stuff as she could carry away with her. and so she
went to saint Flour a city but a leage thens / and they of the city were sore
abashed wha^ they knew that Alois was englisshe: and so was all the country
about. And anon after / Amergotte Marcell took the strong castle of Balon /
by stelth of scalyng. and when they were wtin / the captain was a sleep in
the great tower / which tower was not likely to be won by force / and by that
tower the castle might be won again. Than Amergot aduysed him of a subteltie.
He had in his hands the father and mother of the Captain / and so he brought
them before the tower / and made semblant to stryke of their heedes / without
he would yield up the tower. These good folks douted death / and said to
their son / who was in the tower. Sir have pity on us / and they wept
pyteously. The squier thought yt his father and mother should never dye for his
sake / and so yielded up the tower: than they put him out of the castle. Thus
Balone was english / the which did after much trouble to the country. for
all such as thought to do yuell resorted thither / or else to Causuryell / a two
leages fro Lymoges / else to Carlat / to Aloys / to Uentadore / or in to such
other places. and when these garrisons assembled toguyder / they were to the
nombre of six hundred spears: and so ran over all the country and into the
cou^tie of the dolphyn of Auuergue. It was of truth that the lord of Cupyer
was to them a great enemey / in likewise so was the lord of Forterell and the
bastard of Forterell his brother / and a squire of Burbonoyse / called
Gordones. Who by clean feate of arms / on a day took Amergot Marcell prisoner
/ and raunsomed him at.v. thousand frankes. Thus the deeds of arms fortuned
in Lymosyn / and in the country there.

Of the cisme that was made in the church / and the manner how. and of the
bretons who made warr^ to Ro^c: and of the queen of Naples who put all her
lands into the popes hands. Cap. CCC.xlvi.
IT has been long sith I spoke of holy church / now I will return thereto /
the matter requires it. ye have well herd here before / how by the exortacyon
of the romans. The cardynalles / who as than raygned / to apease the people of
Rome / who were greatly moved against the^. Made a pope of the archbysshoprike
of Bare / called before Bartylmewe des Angles. Hereceyued the papalyte / and
was called Urbayne the sire / and so opyned grace as the usage was Thentencyon
of diverse of y^ cardynals was / y^ when they might se a better hour and time /
they would again return to their election / because this pope was not
profitable for them / nor also to the church as they said / for he was a
f^m^sshe man and malincolyous. So that wha^ he saw him self in prosperyte and
in puyssance of the papalyte / and that diverse kings christened were joined to
him / and wrote to him / and did put them under his obeysaunce. Whereof he
wared proud / and worked all on heed: and would have taken away fro ye
cardynals / diverse of their rightes and old customs / the which greatly
displeased them. And so spoke together / and ymagined how he was not well
worthy to govern the world. Wherefore they purposed to those another pope sage
and discrete / by whom the church should be well governed. To this purpose the
cardynals put to all their pain / and specially he y^ was after chosen to be
pope. Thus all a somer they were in this purpose / for they that intended to
make a new pope / durst not show their minds generally / because of the
romans. So that in the time of the vacacyon in the court / diverse cardynals
departed fro Rome / and went about Rome to sport the^ / in diverse places at
their pleasure. and pope Urbane went to another city called Tyeulle / and there
(...) lay a long season. in this vacacion time which might not long endure /
for at Rome there were many clerks of su^drie places of the world / abydinge
for graces / the which was promised to diverse of them. Than the cardynals all
of one acorde assembled together: and their voices rested on sir Robert of
Genesue / sometime son to the earl of Genesue. His first promocyon was / he
was bishop of Therouene / and after bishop of Cambrey: and he was called
cardynall of Genesue. At this election were the most part of the cardynals /
and was called Clement.

THe same season / there was in the marchesse of Rome: a right valyant knight
of Bretayne / called Syluester Bude. And he had under him a two thousand
bretons / and in the year before / he had right well borne himself against the
florentynes / under pope Gregory / who had cursed them: because of the
rebellyon. And by the means of this Syluester Bude / they were come to mercy.
Than pope Clement and the cardynals of his part / secretly sent for him and
his company. And so he ca^^ and entered in to the castle Angle / the better to
constrayne the romans. So pope Urbayne durst not depart fro Tyeulle / nor
such cardynals as were of his acorde for doubt of the bretons / they were so
great a nombre: and all chosen men of war. And when the romans saw them
self in that danger / they sent for other soudyers: almayns / and lumbardes /
and so daily they scrimysshed with the bretons. Clement opyned his graces to
all clerks / such as would have it. And so he signified his name over all the
world. And when the french king / who as than raygned was certifyed thereof:
he had great marueyle / and sent for his brother / and for all the nobles and
prelates of his realm. And for the rectour and master doctor of the
university of Paris / to know of them / to which electyon / outher the first
or the second / that he should hold unto. This matter was not shortly
determined / for diverse clerks varyed: but finally all the prelates of France
enclyned to Clement. And so did the kings brethren and the most perte of
the vnyuersite of Paris. And so the king was informed by all the great clerks
of his realm / that he obeyed to pope Clement / and held him for the true
pope. and made a special commandment through out his realm / that every
manne should take and repute Clement for pope. And that every man should obey
him / as god on earth. The king of Spaygne was of the same opinyon / and so was
the earl of Sauoy / the duke of Myllayne / and the queen of Naples.

The beleuyng thus of the french king upon Clement / colored greatly his
deeds / for the realm of France was reputed to be the chief fountain of
believe of the christen faith / because of the noble churches and prelasies /
that be therein. As than lived Charles of Boesme / king of Almaygne and emperor
of Rome / who was at Praigne in Behayne / and was advertised of all these
matters / whereof he had great marueyle. and though y^ his empire of Almayne /
except the bysshoprike of Trect believed in faith / courage / and entencyon in
pope Urbane / and would not here spekyng of any other. yet he feigned and
dissymuled all his life time / and would answer when he was spoken to of that
matter so courtesly / that all his barons and prelates of his realm were
content. How be it the churches of the empire obeyed pope Urbayne / but
Scotland held of Clement. The earl Loyes of Flaunders was greatly against
Clement / in the perties of Brabant / Heynalt / and in Lege / for he would ever
abide to be Urbanyst. Saying / how they did the same pope great wrong. And
this earl was so believed and renomed in those parties / where he was conversant
/ that the churches and lords held of the same opynion. But they of Heynaulte
and the churches there / and the lord called Albert abode as neutre / and
obeyed no more to one than to ye other. Wherefore the bishop of Cambrey /
that reigned at that time called John^ / lost in Heynalt all the revenues of
his temporalties. And in the same season there was sent into France / into
Heynalt / in to Flaunders / and in to Braba^t fro pope Clement. The cardynall
of Poicters / a right wise / valyant / and a sage clerk / to ensygne and to
preche to the people / for he was at the first election. And there he showed
how by constraynt / they chase first the archebysshop of Bare to be pope. The
french king and his brethren and the prelates of France / mekely received
him / and gladly intended to his business and words: for it seemed to the^
that he spoke all truth / and so gave faith to him. And when he had been a
season in France / than he went in to Heynalt / where he was also ioyously
received. In likewise so he was in Brabant / both of the duke and of the
duchess / but he did there nothing else. He thought in his retournyng to have
gone into Lege / but he took other counsel and went not thither / but
returned to Tourney / and thought to have gone in to Flanders / to have
spoken with therle. But it was showed him that he had nothing to do there /
because ye earl held and would hold of Urbayne / and so to live and dye. Than
the cardynall departed fro Tourney and went to Ualencennes / and so to Cambrey
/ and there he lay a long space / in hope always to here some good tidings.

THus the christen realms were in variacyon / and the churches in great
dysference / because of the popes. Urbayne had the greatter party / but to
speak of the most profitable revenues and plain obeisance / Clement had it.
And so Clement by consent of the cardynals / sent to Auygnon to make ready the
paleys there for him / for his intent was to go thither / as soon as he might.
And so he went to the cite of Fou^des / and there opyned his graces. Thither
drew all manner of clerks / such as would take grace: and he kept about in
vyllages many soudyers / who made great war to Rome / and to the bourage of
saint Peter / and traueyled them day and night with diverse assautes and
scrimysshes. And also they that were in the castle Angle without Rome / did
much trouble to the romans. But they of Rome enforsed themself so with
soudyers / almayns / and with the puyssance of Rome / so that they assembled
toguyder on a day / and conquered the bourage of saint Peter. Than the bretons
drew them in to the castle of Angle / how be it they were so handled by
force of arms / that they gave it up / their lives saved. Tha^ the bretons
deperted and drew to Foundes / and there about in the country: and the romans
beat down the castle Angle / and brent the bourage of faint Peter. When sir
Syluestre Bude / who was in the country: herd how his men had lost the
bourage of saint Peter / and y^ castle Angle. He was right sore displeased /
and studied how to be revenged of ye romans. It was showed him by his spies /
how on a day the romans / and the noblest men of the city of Rome / should
assemble together in counsel in the Capitolle. As Soon as he knew that / he
assembled toguyder a certain nombre / and rode forth by covert ways secretly
/ and so came to Rome in the evening / and entered in at the gate of Naples.
Wha^ these bretons were within / they took ye straight way to the Capitol /
and came thither as the counsel of Rome were issued out of the chamber. Than
the bretons couched their spears / and ran in among them: and slew and beat
down a great nombre of the most notablest of the cite. There was slain a six
baneretes / and a two hundred of other rich persons / and a great nombre hurt.
and when these bretons had done their enterprise / they withdrewe them
against night / and than it began to be late so yt they were not pursued: what
for they night and for the sudden fray that they were in. for they wist not
what to do / but to take heed of their friends that were sore hurt. So they
passed that night in great dystresse and sorrow of heart / and so buried the
deed / and dressedde the hurt. And in the morning / the romans aduysed the^
self of a great cruelty / for the poor clerks that were in Rome and were in
no fault: they slew and hurt of the^ mo than three hundred / and specially
bretons y^ fell in their hands / there was no mercy. Thus went the matters in
Rome by reason of the state of the popes / and daily they bought it dear /
such as were without fault.

IN the mean season that Clement and his cardynals lay thus at Foundes / y^
queen of Napoles came thither to se him / for she did put her self under the
obeysaunce of pope Clement. This queen had been long in purpose to put the
realm of Cecyll (whereof she was lady / and the county of Prouence / which
depends of the same realm) in to the hands of the pope / to do with them at
his pleasur / and to give the^ to some high prince of the realm of France /
being of such puyssa^ce to keep them / against such as she hated deedly / who
were descended out of the realm of Hu^gry. And when y^ queen of Naples was
come to Foundes / she humbled her self lowly to pope Clement and was confessed
of him / and discovered to him all the secrets of her heart / and said. Holy
father: I hold diverse noble herytages / as the realm of Naples / the realm
of Cecyll / Puyll / Calabre / and the county of Prouence. And it is of truth
y^ king Loyes of Cecyll / duke of Puyll and Calabre my father: while he lived /
knowledged all these lands to hold of the church / and on his death bed he
took me by the hand / and said A fair daughter / ye are enherytour of many a
^che country / and I am sure many great lords will seek to have you in marriage
/ because of y^ fair heritage that ye have. Therefore daughter I would ye
should use you after my counsel as to mary yourselfe to so high a prince /
that may be puyssant to keep and maynteyne you and your heritage in rest and
peace. And if it so fortune that ye have none heirs / than deliver all your
lands in to the hands of the pope / than being a live: for king Robert my
father at the hour of his death / gave me in like charge. therefore fair dought
/ I charge you and discharge me. And than I promised him on my faith in the
presence of all them that were in his chamber / that I should acomplysshe his
last desire. And holy father / so it was that after his discease: by the
consent of all the nobles of Cecyll and Naples. I was married to Andrewe of
Hungry / brother to king Loyes of Hungry: by whom I had no issue / for he
dyed young at Ayes in Prouence. And after his discease / I was married again to
the prince of Tarent / who was called Charles / and by him I had a daughter.
Than the king of Hungry / for the displeasure that he had to Andrewe his
brother my first husband / went and made war against my husband Charles of
Tarent / and took fro him Puyll and Calabre / and took him in battle and led
him to prison in to Hungry: and there he dyed. And yet after again by the
acorde of the nobles of Cecyll / I married again king James of Maiogres / and
sent in to France for sir Loys of Nauer to have married my daughter / but he
dyed by the way. Than it fell so / that the king my husband went to conquer
his heritage of Maiogres / the which the king of Arragon had taken fro him
byforce / and had dysheryted him: and caused his father to dye in prison. And
or he departed fro me / I said to him. Sir: I am a lady and have puyssance and
richesse sufficyent to maynteyne your estate acordynge to your desire / how
beit he preached so much to me / and showed me so many fair reasons /
desyring to recover his heritage / so that I was feign to consent to him to
take his pleasure. But at his departing I desired him to have gone to king
Charles of France / and to have showed him his business / and to have ordered
himself by his counsel. How be it he did not so / the which was his hurt /
for he went to the prince of Wales / who promised to have aided him. So he had
greatter trust in the price of Wales than in the french king / to whom I was
nere of lynage. and in the mean season while he was in his vyage / I wrote to
the french king and sent great messangers to him / desyring him to send me a
noble man of his blood to mary my daughter / to the intent that mine herytages
should not be without an heir. The king sent his cosyn sir Robert of Artoyse /
who wedded my daughter: and in y^ vyage that the king my husband made he dyed.
And after again I married sir Oath of Broswyche / and because sir Charles de la
Paixe / saw that sir Oath should have mine heritage as long as I lived / he
made us war. And took us in the castle of Locufe / when the sea was so high
that we feared it would have overflowed us. at which time we were so afraid /
that we yielded us all four / to sir Charles de la Paixe / our lives saved. And
so he held us in prisone: my husband and I / my daughter and her husband.
And so it happed / that my son and daughter dyed there: and after by treaty
I and my husband were delivered / so that Puylle and Calabre might come to
him. And also he ente^deth to come to the heryrage of Naples / of Cecyll and of
Prouence / for he seeks all about for alyance. and so will take a way the
right of the church as soon as I am deed / if he may. Therefore holy father / I
will acquyte me against god and you / and acquyte the souls of my
predecessors / and put in to your hands / all y^ herytages that I ought to
have / of Cecyll / of Naples / Punyll Calabre / and Prouence / I give them to
you / to do with them your pleasure / to give them to whom soever it pleases
you / such as may obteygne them against our adversary / sir Charles de la
Paix. Pope Clement received joyfully her words / and took her gift in great
reverence / and said. A my fair daughter of Naples / we shall so ordeyn that
yor heritage shall have such an heryter of your own blood / noble and puyssant
to resyst against them / that will do or offer you or the^ any wrong. Of all
these words and gifts / there were publyke instruments / and autentyke made
/ to the intent that the matter should abide ferme and stable / in time to come
/ and to be of more plain knowledge to all them that should here thereof after.

How pope Clement went to Auygnon / and of the gifts that he gave to the
duke of Aniowe / and how sir Siluester Budde / and his company were beheded /
and of the country of Flaunders / and of their aduersyte. Cap. CCC.xlvii.
When the queen of Naples / and sir Oath of Brouswiche had done all things /
wherefore they were come to Foundes to the pope / than they took their leave and
departed and went to Naples Than it was not long after but that pope Clement
imagyned in him self / that to abide long about the parties of Rome / was
nothing protytable for him / and saw well how the romans and pope Urbayne
trauayled greatly to get the love of the neapolitans / and of sir Charles de
la Paix. therefore he douted lest the passages and ways should be closed against
him / so that he should not get to Auygnon when he would. and the princypall
and special cause / that inclyned him to go to Auignon / was to thentent to
give to the duke of Aniou / the ryghtes that the queen of Naples had given unto
him / of all the foresaid seignoris / whereof he had instruments past / and
sealed. So he ordained secretly / and sagely his business / and took thesee /
and his cardynals with him / in galies and vessels that were come out of
Arragone. They had wind and wether at will / and arrived without damage at
Merseyll / whereof all the country was right glad. and for thens he went to
Auignon / and sent word of his coming to the french king / and to his
brethern / who were right glad of his coming. And the duke of Aniou who lay
at the city of Toulouse / went to se y^ pope. and at his coming the pope gave
him all the gifts y^ the wene of Naples had given him. The duke of Aniou / who
alweys desired high seignories and great honors / received the gifts in great
magnyficence. And so had them to him / and to his heirs for ever. and said to
the pope / that in as short time as he might / he would go so strong in to
those marches / that he would be able to resyst them that would do any wrong
to the queen of Naples. The duke tarried with y^ pope a.xv. days / and than
returned to Toulouse to the duchess his wife / and pope Clement delivered his
men of war to sir Bernard de la Sale / and to Flouremont / to make war
against his enemies.

THe same season / there was in the marches of Thuskayne in Italy / a valyant
knight englyssh / called sir John^ Haconde who did and had done many a noble
feate of arms. he issued out of the realm of France / when the peace was
made bitwene y^ two kings at Bretigny beside Charters / and in y^ time he was
but a poor knight / and than he thought to return again in to England in
to his own country / he thought he could win nothing there. And when he
saw that all men of war should avoid the realm of France by the
ordinance and treaty of peace / he made him self captain of a certain
nombre of co^panyons called the late comers / and so went in to Burgoyne / and
there he assembled a great nombre of such rutters / englisshe / gascons /
bretons almayns / and companyons of diverse nacyons. And this Haconde was one of
the cheyfe with Briquet and Carnell / by whom the battle of Brumauxe was made
/ and helped to get the Pount le Spirit / with Bernard of Forges. and when
they had warred and haryed the country against the pope and the cardynals /
than there were entreated / and went to the marquis of Mou^tferrant / who as
than kept war with the lords of Myllayne. and so this Marquis brought them
all beyond the mountains / after he had delivered to the^.lx. thousand
frankes / whereof Hacond had for his part.x. thousand for him and his company
/ and when they had acheued the war with the Marquis / diverse than returned in
to France. for sir Bertram of Clesquy / the lord de la March / and the lord
Beauiewe / the marshall of France / and sir Andrewe Dandrehen / brought them
into Spain against king Dampeter / on king Henry's part / and sir Johan
Hacond and his company abode still in Italy. and pope Urbayne the fyfte as
long as he lived / had him in his wars of Myllayne / and in like wise so had
pepe Gregory / who raygned after him. and this same sir Johan Hacond had for
the lord Coucy a fair journey against therle of Uertues / for it was said for
troth / that the lord Coucy had been overthrown by y^ earl of Uertues and the
lombardes / if this Haconde had not ben / for he came to his aid with five
hundred / bycawse the lord Coucy had wedded the king of Englandes daughter /
and for none other cause This sir Johan Haconde was a knight right hardy and of
great experyence / and well renomed in the marches of Italy / and did there
many great feats of arms. Than the romans and Urbayne / who called him self
pope / aduysed in them self / when Clement was departed fro the marches of
Rome / to send for him / and to make him master and governor of all their
war. So they sent for him / and retained him and all his company / and he
acquyted him self right valiantly / for on a day / with the help of the
romans he disconfyted Syluester Bude / and a great company of bretons / so y^
they were all slain or taken. and Syluester Bude brought prisoner to Rome / and
was in great danger to lose his heed. And to say the troth / it had been
better for him / to have been beheeded the same day he was brought to Rome /
than otherwise for the honor of him and of his friends. For afterward / pope
Clement caused him to lose his heed in the city of Mascon / and another squier
of Breton with him called Wyllm^ Boyleau / for they were had in suspect of
treason / because they were issued out of the romans prison / and could not
be known by what treaty or means / and so they came to Auygnon and there were
taken. Of their taking was culpable the cardynall of Amyens / for he hated
them sithe they made war in Rome for the pope / because in the feldes on a
day / they and their companyes took the said cardynalles somerses wherein they
had a great qua^tyte of vessel and plate of gold and silver / and departed it
among their companyes / who could not be paid of their wages / wherefore the
same cardynall took the same dead in great displeasure / and so covertly
accused them of treason. So that when they were come to Auygnon treason was
laid to them / how they had falsely betrayed y^ pope and thereupon sent to
Mascon / and there beheeded both. Thus the matters went at that time in those
countries / and sir Bertram of Clesquy was sore displeased / for the death of
Syluester Bude his cosyn / with pope Clement / and with the cardinals. so that
it he had lived long after they should well have known that his does had been
right sore displesant to him.

Now let us leave to speak of these matters and let us enter to speak of the
wars of Flanders / the which began in the same season. which were hard
and cruel / whereby much people were slain and exyled / and the country
turned in to such a case. that it was said: that in a hundred year after /
it should not be recovered again. And I shall show you by what mean and
occasyons / the unhappy wars began.

When the tribulacyons began first in Flanders / the country was so welthy and
so rich / y^ it was marvel to here. and the men of y^ good towns kept such
estate / that it was wonder to here tell thereof. but these wars began first
by pride and envy / that the good towns in Flanders had one against another /
as they of Gau^t against the^ of Bruges / and they of Bruges against the^ of
Gaunt / and other towns one against another. but there was such resort that
no war could rise among the^ / without therle of Flaunders their lord did
consent thereto / for he was so feared and beloved / that none durst displease
him. Also y^ earl who was right sage and subtell / kept under the warr^ and
yuell will of his people / for he would in no wise suffer no war to rise
among them and him. for well he thought in his ymaginacyons / that when any
difference should rise between him and his people / he should be the febler /
and the less set by of his neighbors. Also he kept under the war for
another cause / howbeit at the end he was driven to use it. And y^ was / he
consydred the great distructyon that should fall thereby / both of bodies and
goods. For always he had lived in great prosperyte and peace / and had as
much his pleasure as any other christen prince had / but this war began for
so light a cause and in sydent / that justly to consider and speak. ^f good
wit and sage advise had been in the lord / he neded not to have had any
manner of war. What shall they say / that redeth this or hereth it read? But
that it was the warke of the devil. For ye know / or else ye have herd say of
the wise sages: How the devil subtelly tiseth night and day to make war /
where as he sey the peace. And seeks little and little / how he may come to
his ungracious intent: and so it fortuned in those days in Fla^ders / as ye
may clerelye know and se / by the treaty of the order / of the matter that
follows.

Of the princypall rote and cause of the war / between the earl of Flanders
and the flemynges. And how the white hattes were set up by Johan Lion. Cap.
CCC.xlviii.
THe same season: while the duke Loys of Flanders was in his greattest
prosperyte. There was in Gaunt a burgess (called Johan Lion) a sage man: cruel
/ hardy / subtell / and a great enterpriser: and cold and pacient enough in
all his warkes. This John^ Lion was great with the earl / as it apered / for
the earl entysed him to slay a man in Gau^t / with who^ehe was displeased. And
at the earls commandment covertly / this Johan Lion made a matter to him /
and so fell out with him and slew him / the which burgess was sore
complained* and therefore John^ Lion went and dwelt at Doway / and was there
a.iii. year / and held a great estate and port / and all of therles cost. and
for this slaughter on a day / Johan Lion lost all that ever he had in Gaunt /
and was banysshed y^ town four year but after the earl of Flaunders did so
much for him / that he made his peace / and so to return a gain to the town
of Gaunt / and to have again as great fraunches as ever he had / whereof diverse
in Gaunt and in Flaunders had great marvel / and were there with right sore
abashed / but for all that so it was done. And beside that / to thentent that
he should recover again his loss / and to maintain his astate / the earl
made him chief ruler of all the ships / maryners / and Navy. This office was
well worth by year a thousand fra^kes / and yet to deal but trewely. Thus
this Johan Lion was so great with the earl that there was none like him.

IN the same season there was anotherlygnage in Gaunte / called the Mahewes.
There were of them seuyn brethren / they were the chief of all the maryners.
And among these seuyn brethren / there was one of them called Gylbert
Mahewe: a right sage manne / much more subtell than any of his brethren. This
Gylbert Mahue had great envy covertly at this Johan Lion / because he saw him
so great with the earl / and studied night and day how he might put him out of
favor with the earl. Diverse times he was in mind to have slain him by his
brethern / but he durst not for for fear of the earl. So long he studied and
ymagined on this matter / that at last he found the way. The chief cause that
he hated him for was: as I shall show you / the better to come to the found
acyon of this matter. Aunciently there was in the town of Dan a great mortal
warr^ between two maryners / and their lynages. The one called Peter Guillon /
and the other John^ Barde: Gilbert mahewe and his brethren were come of the
one lynage / and this Johan Lion of the other. So this covert hate was long
norysshed bitwene these two paties / how beit they spoke and ete and drank to
gyder. and the lynage of Gylbart Mahewe / made more a do of the matter / than
Johan Lion did. In so much that Gylbert Mahewe without any stroke gyuyng
aduysed a subtell deed. The earl of Flanders would some time lie at Gaunt /
than this Gylbert Mahewe / came and aquaynted himself with one of them that
was nere about the earl / and on a day said to him. Sir: if my lord therle
would / he might have every year a great profit of y^ ships and navy /
whereof he has now nothing / which profit the strangers and the maryners
should pay / so that Johan Lion who is chief ruler there / will truly
acquyte him self. This ge^tylman said he would show this to the earl / and so
he did. The earl than / in likewise as diverse lords are lightly enclyned
naturally to harken to their profytte / and not regardyng y^ end / what may
fall thereby / so they may have riches / for couytousnes disceyueth the^. he
answered and said. let Gylbert (...) come to me / and we will here what he will
say. Than ca^e Gylbert and spoke with the earl / showing him diverse reasons
reasonable as the earl thought / and so answered and said. I think it were well
done yt it should be thus. Than John^ Lion was sent for / who knew nothing of
this matter / and there in the presence of Gylbert Mahewe / the earl showed him
all the matter and said: John^ if ye woll / we may have great profit in this
matter. Johan Lion / who was a true man. saw well it was not a thing reasonable
to be done how be it he durst not say the contrary / but said. Sir: that thing
that ye demand / and that Gylbert Mahewe has brought forth / I can not do
it alone / for it will be a hard matter to all the maryners. Johan quod therle /
if ye will acquyte you truly in this matter / it will be done. sir quod he: I
shall do therein the best of by power / and so they departed. Gylbert Mahewe /
who intended to bring out of favor this Johan Lion with the earl / intended
to none other thing / but to make him lose his office. Than he came to his six
brethren and said / sirs. it is time now that ye socoure and aid me / and to
maintain this matter as good trendes and brethern should help each other / it
is for you that I have dryue^ about this matter / I shall discomfyt John^ Lion
without any stroke strykyng / and shall bring him in as great displeasure with
the earl / as he is now great and in favor. Whatsoever I say in the ne^t
parlyament / keep your own openyons / for if the earl require you to do such
a thing debate you well the matter / but I will say still and maintain / yt
it Johan Lion will truly acquyte him self / this ordyna^ce may be done. And I
know so much / that my lord the earl if the matter come not to his intent /
Johan Lion shall lease his favor and office / and give the office to me. And
when I ones have it than ye shall agree thereto / we are puyssant enough in this
town to rule all the resydue / there is none will say against us: and tha^ I
shall do so that John^ Lion shall be overthrown. thus we shall be revenged on
him without any stroke gyuyng / all his brethern accorded to him. So the
parlyament came / and all the maryners were ready. There Johan Lion / and
Gylbert Mahewe showed them the earls pleasure on the new statute that he would
reyse on the navy of Lys and Lescaulte / the which thing seemed to them all
right hard / and contrary to their old custom. and the chief that spoke
there against were Gylbert Mahewes brethren / more than any other. Than Johan
Lion who was chief ruler of them all. was right ioyouse / for he would to his
true power maintain them in their old ancient fraunchesses and lyberties.
And he went that all that they said had been for him / but it was contrary /
for it was for an evil intent toward him. Johan Lion reported to the earl
the answer of the maryners / and said. sir: it is a thing can not be well
done / for great hurt may come thereby. sir: and it please you let the matter
rest in the old ancient estate / and make no new thing among them. This
answer pleased nothing the earl / for he saw that if the matter might be
brought up and raised / it should be well worth to him yearly a seven thousand
florens / so he held his peace as at that time / but he thought the more. And
so pursewed by fair words and treaties these maryners / but always Johan
Lion found them right obstynate in the case. Than Gylbert Mahewe came to the
earl and to his counsayll / and said: how that John^ Lion aquyted him but
slackely in the matter / but and ye earl would give him the office that Johan
Lion has / he would so handell the maryners / yt the earl of Flaunders should
heretably have ye said profit. The earl saw not clear / for couytusnes of the
good blinded him / and by his own counsayll he put John^ Lion out of the
office / and gave it to Gylbert Mahewe. Wha^ Gylbert Mahewe saw how he had
the office / within a little space he turned all his six brethren to his
purpose / and so made the earl to have his intent and profyt / wherefore he was
never the better beloved of ye most part of the maryners. howebeit it behooved
them to suffer / for the seven brethern were great and puyssant / with the aid
of the earl. Thus by this subtell means Gylbert Mahewe get him self in
favor with the earl / and he gave many gifts / and ioweles to them that were
nere about the earl / whereby he had their loves. And also he gave many great
presents to the earl / the which blinded him / and so by that means he gate
his love / and all these gifts and presents this Gylbert Mahewe raised of ye
maryners / whereof there were many that were not well content / howbeit they
durst speak no word to the contrary.

Johan Lion by this means / and by the purchase of Gylbert Mahewe / was out of
y^ erls favor and love. and so kept his house and lived of his own / and
endured and suffered patiently all that ever was done to him. for this Gylbert
Mahewe / who as than was chief ruler of all the ships / covertly ever hated
this Johan Lion / and took away the third or fourth perte of the profit that
he should have had of his ships. All this John^ Lion suffered and spoke no
word / but sagely dissymuled and took in gre / all that ever was done to him /
and said. There is time to be still / and time to speak. This Gylbert Mahewe had
one brother called Stenuart a subtell man / who aduysed well the manner of Johan
Lion / and said to his brethern in prophesyeng as it came to pass. Sirs this
John^ Lion suffers now / and hangs down his heed / he does it all for
policy. but I fear me he will at length make us lower / tha^ we be now high.
but I counsel one thing / that while we be thus in the earls favor / letre
us slay him. I shall soon s^e him / if I take the charge to do it: and so we
shall be out of all parelles. his other brethren would in no wise consent
thereto / and said to him / that in no wise he should do him any hurt / saying
to him: how a man ought not to be slain / without the sentence of a Judge.
Thus the matter continued a certain space / till the devil who never slepeth
/ awaked them of Bruges / to dig about the river of Lys / to have the easment
of y^ course of the water / And the earl was well accorded to the^ / and sent
great nombre of pioners and men of arms to assyste them. Before that in time
past they would have done the same / but they of Gaunt by puyssance brake their
purpose. These tidings came to Gaunt / how they of Bruges were byggynge to
turn the course of the river of Lys / ye which should greatly be to the
preiudyse of Gaunte. many folks in the town began to murmr / and specially
the maryners / for it touched the^ nere. wherefore they said. they of Bruges
should not be suffered so to dygge / to have the course of theryuer to them /
whereby their town should be distroyed. And some said preuely / a god help now
Johan Lion / for if he had been still our gouernoure / it should not have been
thus. they of Bruges would not have been so hardy to attempt so far against
us. Johan Lion was well aduertysed of all these matters. Than he began a little
to wake / and said to him self. I have slept a season / but it shall apere /
that for a small occasyon I shall wake / and shall set such a trymble bitwene
this town and the earl / that it shall cost perauenture a hundred thousand
men's lives. The tidings of these dyggers increased. So it was / there was a
woman that come fro her pilgrymage from our lady of Bolayne (who was weary) and
sat down in the market place / where as there were diverse men / and some of
the^ demanded of her fro whens she came / she answered fro Bolayne. and I have
seen by the way / ye greatest myschefe that ever came to this town of Gaunte.
for there be mo than five hundred pioners / that night and day works before
the river of Lys / and if they be not let / they will shortly torn the course
of the water. This woman's words was well hard and understand / in diverse
places of ye town. Than they of the town began to moan and said, this deed
ought not to be suffered / nor consented unto. Than diverse went to Johan Lion /
and demanded counsayll of him / how they should use them self in this matter.
And when Johan Lion saw him self sought on / by them whom he desired to have
their good wylles and love / he was greatly reioysed / how be it he made no
semblant of joy. For he thought it was not as than yet time / till the matter
were better a certayned / and so he was sore desired or he would speak or
declare his thought / and wha^ he spoke he said. Sirs: if ye will adventure to
remedy this matter / it behoue that in this town of Gaunte / ye renew an old
ancient custom / that sometime was used in this town / and that is / that ye
bring up again the white hattes / and y^ they may have a chief ruler / to
whom they may draw / and by him be ruled. These words were gladly herd /
and than they said all with one voice / we will have it so. let us reyse up
these white hattes. Than there were made white hattes / and given and delivered
/ to such as loved better to have war tha^ peace for they had nothing to
lose. And there they chase Johan Lion to be chief gouernoure of all the white
hattes. The which office he took on him right gladly / to the intent to be
revenged on his enemies / and to bring discord between the towns of Bruges
and Gaunt / and the earl their lord. And so it was ordained / that they should
go out against the dyggers of Bruges / with Johan Lion their sovereign
capytayne / and with him two hundred with their companyes / of such as had
rather have had war than peace. and wha^ Gylbert Mahewe and his brethern
saw the manner of these white hattes / they were not very joyful thereof. than
Stenuart said to his brethren. I said to you before / how this Johan Lion
should discomfytte us at length / it had been better that ye had believed me
before / and to have let me have slain him / rather than he should be in this
(...)te that he is now in / and is likely to be in. and a(...)s by the white
hattes / that he has brought up. Nay nay quod Gylbert / when I have ones
spoken with my lord the earl: I warrant you / they shall be laid down
again. Let them alone / to do their entprise against the pyoners of Bruges /
for the profit of this our town: for else to say the truth / the town were
but lost.

Johan Lion and his company with the white hearts departed fro Gaunt / in will
to slay all the pyoners / and such other as kept the^. These tidings came to
the pyoners how the gauntoyes came on them with a great puissaunce / wherefore
they douted to lose all. And so lafte their warke / and went back again to
Bruges / and were never after so hardy to dyg there again. When John^ Lion and
his company saw nothing to do: they returned again to Gaunt. But for all
that / Johan Lion lafte not his office / but that the white hattes went daily
up and down the town / and John^ Lion kept them still in that estate. And to
some he would say secretly. Hold you well content / eat and drink and make
merry and be not afraid of any thing that ye dispende. Such shall pay in time
to come for your scotte / that will not give you now one penny.

How by the exhortacion of John^ Lion / the gau^toyes sent certain notable
burgesses of the town of Gau^te to the earl of Flaunders / for the
co^seruacyon of their priuyleges and old fraunchesses* and of the desire
therle made to lay down the white hattes. Cap. CCC.xlix.
IN the same weke that Johan Lion had been thus at Donse / to have met with the
pioners of Bruges. there came diverse out of the frau^chesse of Gaunt / to
compain to them / that had as than the rule of the law: and said. Sirs /
at Erclo beside us the which is within the fraunchesse of Gaunt. There is one
of our burgesses in the earls prison / and we have desired therles baylye there
to deliver him / but he has plainly answered / that he will not deliver him.
The which is plainly against y^ priuylege of this town of Gaunt. And so
thereby little and little your priuyleges shall be broken / the which in time
past / have been so noble and so highly pray sed: and beside that / so well kept
and maynteyned / that none durst break them. And that the most noblest knight
of Flaunders / held him self well reputed / to be a burgess of Gaunte. Than
they of the law answered / and said: how they would write to the bailey /
desyringe him / that the burgess may be delivered. For trewely his office
extends not so far / as to keep our burgess in the earls prisone. And so
they wrote to the bailey / forth delyueraunce of the burgess / being in
prisone in Erclo. The baylye answered / and said. What needs all these words
for a maryner? Say quod the baylye / who had to name Roger Dauterne: to them of
Gaunt / that though he were a richer man ten times than he is / he shall never
go out of prison without my lord the earl command it. I have puyssance to
arest / but I have no powere to deliver. The words of this Roger Dauterne were
reported to them of Gau^t / wherewith they were sore displeased / and said: how
he had answered right proudely. By these answers and insydentes as well for
the pyoners of Bruges / who would have dygged against the heritage and profit
of Gaunt. And for such other semblable deeds / whereby the fraunchesses of
Gau^te should have been hurt. There began to ryn through the town and abroad
in the country these unhappy rybaudes / called the white hattes: to the intent
to be the more feared and renomed. For it behooves in a lynage / that there be
some folysshe and outragyous / to maynteyne and sustain the peasable.

THe tidings of this maryner burgess of Gaunt / being in the earls prison at
Erclo / whom the bayly^ would not deliver / spredde abroad in the town of
Grant. And diverse folks began to murmr / and to say: how it was not to
be suffered. For in sitting still and being to soft / in maynteyninge of
their fraunchesse / they might lose all / the which has been so noble. Johan
Lion / who intended always but to one thing: and that was / to set in
trouble the town of Gaunt / against the earl their lord. In such wise / that
he should not apease it again / but with much sorrow and great dommage:
wherefore he was nothing displeased of these adventures / but he would always
/ that for one of them there had fallen threttie. He put forth his words /
and couertlye did so we them through the town. Saying how: that when soever
offices be bought in a town / the iurysdictyons and priuyleges can not be
well kept. For the earl receives now yearly three or four thousand frankes /
beyond the old usage or customs / whereby the merchants and maryners
greatly complayneth them / and leaves to resort to the town of Gaunt. both
they of Ualencennes / of Doway / of Lyle / of Bethayne / and of Tourney. And
this may be a thing / whereby the town may be lost: for little and little
daily the frau^chesses be takenne away / and ancient priuyleges: and yet
there is no man dare speak against it.

GIlbert Mahewe and the ruler of the mean crafts / who was of Gylbertes perte
/ herd with their own ears daily such words / and knew well / how they
did rise by Johan Lion / but they durst not remedy it: for Johan Lion had
sowed throughout the town the white hattes / and given them to such
co^panyons hardy and outragyous / in such wise that none durst assail them.
And also Johan Lion went never alone* for when soever that he went out of his
house / he had ever with him a two or three hundred white hattes about him / nor
he never went abroad in the town / without it had been for a great cause*
for he was greatly desired to have his counsel / on the insydentes / that
fell within Gaunt and without: conseruynge the fraunchesse of the town and
lyberties thereof. And when he was in counsel / than he would show a general
word to y^ people. He spoke in so fair rethorike / and by so great craft:
that such as herd him / were gretlye reioysed of his langage. And would say
all with one voice / that all was true that he said. By great prudence Johan
Lion said to y^ people. Sirs / I say not that we should hurt or my nysshe any
part of my lord the earls enheryta^ce / for though we would we canna^: For
reason and justice would not suffer us. Nor that we should seek any craft or
incydent / whereby we should be in his displeasur or indygnacion. for we ought
always / to be in love and favor with our prince and lord. and my lord
therle of Flanders is our good lord / and a right hye prince feared and
renomed / and always has kept us in peace and prosperyte. The which things
we ought to know / and to suffer the more largely. More bound we are thereto /
than if he had traueyled us or displeased us / or made war or hared us / and
to have put to his pain to have our goods. But how soever it be / at this
present time he is yuell cou^sayled or informed against us / and against the
fraunchesses of the good town of Gaunte. In that they of Bruges be more in his
favor than we. It apereth well by the pioners of Bruges / that he being
there: they came to take away our heritage. and to take away the river / whereby
our town of Gaunt should be distroyed. And also he would have made a castle
at Donse against us / to bring us in danger / and to make us weaker. And I
know well: how they in Bruges had promised him in time paste / ten or.xii.
thousand frankes yearly: to have to them the easment of the river of Lys.
Therefore I counsel / let this good town of Gaunt: send to the earl some
sad and discrete personages / to show him boldly all these matters / as well
touching the burgess of Gaunt in prisone in Erclo / the which his baylye
will not deliver: as all other matters / wherewith the good town of Gaunte is
not content. And also these matters herd: than let it be showed him also.
that he nor his counsel / think that we be so dull or deed (but y^ if need
be / we may if we list) make resystence there against. And so his answer ones
herd. Than the good town of Gaunte may take advise / to punysshe the
trespass on them that shall be found culpable against the^. And when Johan
Lion had showed all these words to the people / in the market place: every
man said. he says well. And than went home to their own howses. At these
words thus spoken by John^ Lion / Gylbert Mahewe was not present / for he
douted the white hattes: but his brother Stenuart was there always * he
prophesyed of time to come. and when he was returned to his brother / he said.
I have always said / and say yet again: how y^ John^ Lion shall distroy us
all. Cursed be the hour y^ ye had not let me alone / for and I had slain him /
he should never have ouerco^e us / nor come so lightly up. And now it is not
in our puyssance / nor we dare not anoy nor grieve him. He is as now more
greatter in the town than the earl. Gylbert answered / and said. Hold thy
pease fool / for when I will / with ye earls puyssance / all the white hattes
shall be cast down. And such there be that bears them now / that here after
shall have no need of any hatte.

SO than there were charged certain burgesses / to go ambassade to the earl /
of the saddest men of the town. and Gylbert Mahewe was one of them that was
chosen to go and that caused Johan Lion / to the intent that if they spoke any
thing contrary to the earls displeasure / yt the earl should be displeased
with him / as well as with any other. So they departed and found the earl at
Male / and did somoche that finally they accorded so well / that the earl
granted them all their requests / as touching their prisoner at Erclo. And
promising to keep and maintain the fraunchesses of Gaunt without brekyng of
any of them. and defended them of Bruges that they should not be so hardy to
dygge on the heritage of them of Gaunt. And the better to please them of Gaunt
he commanded them of Bruges to fill again the dykes that they had made. and
so they amy ably departed fro the ^rle and returned to Gaunt / and recorded all
that they had done with therle their lord / and how he woll maintain them in
their fraunchesses / without brekynge of any of them / how beit he desired
them by fayrnesse to lay down the white hattes. And with tho words the earls
servants brought again the prisoner fro Erclo / and so yielded him again as
by the way of restablysshing / whereof they had great joy. At this answer
making was Johan Lion / and a.x. or.xii. of the most notable of his company /
and when they herd that the earl required / yt the white hattes should be laid
down / every man held his peace. Than Johan Lion spoke / and said. All ye good
people that be here present / ye know and have seen but late / how ye white
hattes has better kept your fraunchesses / than outher reed or black hattes
have done or of any other color. Be ye sure: and say that I said it / as soon
as ye white hattes be laid down / by the ordinance that the earl would have
it so / I will not give for all your frau^chesses after not three pens. The
which words blinded so ye people / that every man departed thens / and the
most part went home to their houses: and said. Let them alone / John^ Lion
say the truth: we have not seen in him but good and profitable for our town.
So the matter stood still in the same case. And Johan Lion was than in more
fear of his life than he was before / and imagined anon as it fell after for
he thought that Gylbert Mahewe had wrought some matter against him and his
company / in his last voyage with the earl / because therle made so amyable an
answer. Than he thought to find some remedy / and ordained and made secretly
capitayns of the white hattes / as Senteners and Muquateners / and to them
said. ss / say unto your company: that they be day and night purueyed ready /
and as soon as they know or here any mouyng / let them come to me / for it
were better we slew than to be slain / sithe we have begone so far. and as
he ordained so it was done every man ready.

How the white hattes slew the bailey in the market place / and of the goods
and howses of maryners that were distroyed / and of the great brullynge that
was than in Gaunt. Cap. CCC..l.
IT was not long after / but that the baily of Gaunt Roger Dauterne came too
Gaunt with a two hundred horse / and ordained to do as the earl and Gylbert
Mahewe and his brethren had devised. The bailey with two hundred men that be
brought with him / came down a long the streets with the earls baner in his
hand. And when he came in to the market place he rested / and set the baner
before him. Than anon drue to him Gylbert Mahewe and his brethern and the
ruler of the mean crafts. It was ordained that his men of arms should go to
Johan Lions house / and to take him as chief ruler of the white hattes / and
a.v. or sire other of his company / of the^ that were most culpable / and they
to have been brought to the castle of Gau^t / and there to have had their heedes
stryken of. Johan Lion who thought no less / and was well aduysed of this deed
/ for he had spies and watchesse in every corner of the town. He knew well of
the coming of the bailey (and knew for certain / and so did all the white
hattes) y^ the same journey was set for them. they all drew together be times /
and came to Johan Lions house / who was ready in the street abydyng for them. So
there came.x.. than.xx. and ever as they came they fell in array in the street /
and when they were assembled to the nombre of four hundred. Than John^ Lion
departed as fyrse as a lion / and said. let us go on these traitors that will
betray ye good town of Gaunt. I thought well that all y^ sweet words that
Gylbert Mahewe brought us the last day fro the earl / was but disceyte and
distructyon for us / but I shall make them repent it. Than he and his company
went a great pase / and alweys his nombre increased / for there were diverse
that fell to his company that had no white hattes / but they ^ryed treason
treason / and came about by a strayt lane in to the market place / where as the
^ayly was representyng y^ earls parson. And as soon as Gylbert Mahewe and his
brethren saw Johan Lion come in to the place / they fled a way as fast as
they might / and so did all other except such as ye bailey brought with him. As
soon as John^ Lion was come in to the place / the capytayne of the white
hattes / with agreat company with him / came to ye bailey / and with out any
wordespekyng / they took and cast him to the earth / and slew him there. And
than the earls baner was cast down to the ground / and torn all to peaces /
and they touched no man there but the bailey. And than they came all about
John^ Lion. And when the earls men saw the bailey deed / and the earls baner
all to torn / they were greatly abashed / and so took their horses and voyded
out of the town.

YE may well know: that Gylbert Mahewe and his brethren / who were enemies
to John^ Lion were not well assured of the^ self in their own houses /
wherefore they departed as fast as they might / and voyded ye town one after a
another / and left behind them wyfes / children / and herytages / and went
as soon as they might to the earl / and showed him how his bailey was slain.
Of the which tidings therle was sore displeased and good cause why: for they
had done him great dispyte / and said and swear. how it should be greatly
recompe^sed or ever that he returned again in to Gaunt and that they should
never have peace with him in ensample to all other towns. So Gylbert Mahewe
and his brethren / abode still with the earl. And Johan Lion / and the white
hattes perseuered still in their outrage. Roger Dauterne was thus slain / and
all other departed / and y^ none apered before the white hattes to be revenged.
than Johan Lion / who entented to over ryn the maryners / because he loved the^
not * said. Sirs on a fore to these false traitors the Mahewes / that would
this day^ distroy the fraunchesse of the town of Gaunt. And so they ran alonge
the streets to their houses / but they found no body there / for they were
departed. then they were sought for in lodgings / street by street / and
chamber by chamber. And when Johan Lion hard how none of them could be
found / he was sore displeased. Than he gave all their goods to his company
and so all their houses were pilled and robbed / so that no thing was left. as
though they had been false traitors to ye town / and when they had done / they
returned in to their own howses. And after that there was no officerr of the
earls / another within ye town nor without / that ones said to them they had
done evil. and as at that time they durst not / for the white hattes were so
multiplied / that none durst displease them. they went in the streets by great
companyes / but there were none that would mete with the^. It was said in
diverse places in the town and without also / how they had some supportacyon
of some officers / and rich men in Gain the which was lykely to be so / for
who durst begin such a riot / as to enterprise to sle the earls bailey /
holding the earls baner in his hands / doing his office / without some
bolsterer or co^forter in their deed. And after that they multyplyed / and were
so strong in ye town that they cared for no manner of aid / but of the^ self
There were none that durst displease them or withsay any thing that they would
do. This bailey Roger Dauterne was taken by ye freers and so buried in their
church.

When this thing was thus fortuned / diverse good men / sage and rich of the
town of Gaunt were rightsory / and began to speak and murmr. And said each to
other: how they had done a great outrage / in sleyng thus therles bailey / in
doing of his office. And how of right their lord therle must need be
displeased with the^ / and by all likelyhode never to have rest nor pease with
him. and how that these ungracious people had brought all the town in parell
to be dystroyed / without god find some remedy. How be it for all these
words / there were none that durst find the means to correct or to amend
the^ / that had done this out rage. Johan de la Faucell who as than was in
Gau^t / a man right sage and greatly renomed / saw how the matter was gone so
far. and saw how outragiously they had slain the bailey / he thought the
matter should be yuell at length. And for the intent he should not be suspect
with the earl nor with the town: he departed fro the town as privily as he
might / And went to a fair house that he had without Gaunt / and there abode
/ and feigned him self sick: so that none spoke with him but his own men. And
daily he herd tidings out of Gaunt for he had left behind him the most
part of his goods / and his wife and his children / still in the town. Thus
he dissymuled for a season.

How.xii. burgesses of Gau^t were sent to the earl of Flanders / and how in
the mean season the white hattes pylled and burnt / the fair castle of
Andrehen. Cap. CCC.li.
THe good men in Gau^t and rich and notable marchantes / who had within the
town their wives / children / and marchandyse / and their heritages both
within the town and without / and had to live by / right honorably without
dangere. They were not well at their ease in their hertes / to se the business
in Gaunt. they knew well they had sore forfayted against the earl their
lord / and thought well how he would pro did therein some remedy / and that
they should be feign to make amends of their trespasses / now ^rels another
time and they to put them self in the earls mercy. Wherefore they thought it
better to do it be times / rather than to late. Than they took counsel
together / to se how they might use them self / to the profit and honor
both of them and of the town. To this counsel was called Johan Lion / and
the capitayns of the white hattes / or else they durst not have done it. There
were many words and dyue^s purposes devised / finally they were all of one
acorde that they of the counsel should chose.xii. notable persons / and send
the^ to the earl requyringe him of mercy: for the death of his bailey / whom
they had slain. And so by that means if they might have peace they would be
glad: so that all might be comprised in the peace / and nothing else
demanded of the earls part. Than these burgesses were chosen that should go
on this viage / and always Johan Lion said: it is good to be in favor with
our lord and prince. Howbeit he would the contrary / and thought and said to
him self / that the matter was not yet there / as he would bring it unto. So
these burgesses departed and went to Male beside Bruges to ye earl: who at
their first coming / made a cruel and (...)ell countenance against them of
Gaunt. These.xii. burgesses made a pytefull complaynt before the earl / and
required him / holdyng up of all their hands / that he would have mercy on
them. And excused them self of the death of the bailey / both the^ of the law
/ and the notable persons of ye town and said. Right dear sir / acorde so to
us: that we may bring peace with us to the town of Gaunt / the which loves
you so well. And sir / we promise you / that in time to come / this out rage
shall be so greatly recompensed on the^ that has done it / and caused it to be
done: so that ye shall be content. And that it shall be to all other towns
ensample. These.xii. burgesses made so humble requests / that the earl somewhat
refrayned his ire / and by means of other yt was made to him: that he acorded
and ordained at ^ycles of the peace. And therle pardoned all his yuell will
that he had against them of Gaunt / by the amends that should be made: but
than there came to them other new tidings / as I shall show you here after.

Johan Lion who was at Gaunt / thought all contrary to that he had said in the
counsel. How that it was good to be in favor with their lord: he knew in
certaynte that he had so much trespassed against the earl / that his peace
should never be made with him. And if he had any peace granted him / he
thought it should be but dissymulacyon / and that it should cost him his life
at last. So therefore he thought he had rather to be shamed / than to be in
parell and in adventure of his life every day. I shall show you what he did.
While the counsel of the town were with therle for peace / he assembled
together all the white hattes and of all the crafts in Gaunte / such as were
of his accord / and so came to his purpose by a subtell means / and tha^ said
to them all. Sirs ye know well / how we have displeased our lord therle of
Flaunders / and how we have sent unto him / we know not as yet what report
they will bring outher peace or war / for ye earl is not easy to be apeased.
for he has about him such as will rather styre him to displeasure / than to
quietness / as Gylbert Mahewe and his brethern. there is a hundred hyndrers of
ye peace / rather than one forderer therefore it were good that we took good
head to our self / if we have war / to know who shall aid us / and how we
shall get us love among you rulers / of such a craft and such a craft. Cause
to morrow to come in to ye feldes as many men as ye can get / and there we shall
se how able every man is and how they be furnysshed / it is better to be
aduysed be time than to late / this shall cost us nothing / and yet we shall
be the more feared and drad. they all answered / and said: it is well devised /
so let it be done. The next day they went out all at Bruges gate / and so went
in to the feldes in a fair plain without Gaunt / called Andre hen. Than Johan
Lion beheld them gladly: for they were a.x. thousa^de / and all well armed
than he said behold: here is a goodly company * and when he had been there a
certain space and had gone all about them / than he said. Sirs / I
counsel: let us go to the earls place here by / sith we be so nere it / for
it is showed me how he makes there great prouisyon / it may fortune to be
great prejudice to our town of Gaunt. They all agreed thereto / and so came to
Andrehen the which was as than without any great keeping or defense / so they
entered and sought all about the house / and a none this ungracious company
pylled and robbed it of all that ever they found there. There was within it
much riches / for the earl had made there his warderobe. Johan Lion made
semblant / as though he had been sore displeased / how beit that was not so
as it apered. for wha^ they were departed fro the castle / and come again in
to the field they looked behind the^ / and saw all ye place a fire / and that
the fire was more than in xx. places in the castle / so that it was not in the
peoples puyssance to quench it / nor also they had no great will to do it.
Than Johan Lion as though he had great mernayle (said) how comes yonder fire
in my lords house? And some answered / and said. We can not tell^ but by
adventure. well (...) he we can not tha^ amend it / it is better that it be
brent by adventure / rather than by us. And also all things considered / it
was a perylous neighbor to us / for my lord might there a set such a garyson
/ y^ might have done us great damage / if we should have war with him. They
all answered / and said: ye say truth. And so returned in to ye town of
Gaunt / and did no more that day / for they had done yuell enough and to
much: for it cost after / mo than two hundred thousand men's lives. And it
was one of the princypall things / wherewith the earl was most displeased. And
therefore Johan Lion did it / because he would have no peace / for he knew well
/ what soever treaty were made: he was likely to lose his life This castle of
Andrehen / had cost the earl of Flanders the bylding thereof / two hundred
thousand frankes / and he loved it best / of all ye houses he had. The good
men of Gaunt / who de^yred to have had peace: was of this adventure right
sorou^ull / howbeit they could not am^de it / nor they durst make no words
thereof. For the white hattes said: how the castle was brent by unhappy / and
none otherwise.

THese tidings came to the earl of Flanders / who was at Male: and he that
brought him word / said. sir: know for truth / your fair house of Andrehen
/ the which has cost you so much / and that ye so well loved is brent. Brent
(...) the earl: ye surely sir quod he. And how so (...) the earl? Sir by
unhappy as it is said. A (...) the earl / that deed shall never have peace in
Flaunders / as long as Johan Lion lives. He has covertly made it to be set
a fire / but it shall be derely bought. Than he made the burgesses of Gaunte to
come before him / and said to them. A ye yuell and unhappy people / ye pray me
with sword in the hand. I have granted to you all yor requests / as ye will
your self / and now your folks have bre^t my house / the which I loved among
all other. Think they not / that they have done me dyspyte enough / in
sleynge my bailey for doing his office / and to tear there my baner and to
tread it under their fete. Know for troth / saving mine honor / and that
I have given you save conduct / I should cause all your needs to be stryken
of. Depart out of my presence / and say to yonder unhappy people of Gaunte /
that they shall never have peace nor treaty with me till I have of them whom
I will / to stryke of their heedes: and none shall have mercy the burgesses /
who were fullsor^e of these tidings: because they were natte culpable of that
deed / they began to excuse them. but there was none excuse would serve / for
the earl was so sore displeased that he would not here themspeke / and so made
them to avoid his presence / and they took their horses to return to Gaunt /
and showed how well they had spedde / and had great peace and apoyntment / and
this castle had not been brent. And also they showed how the earl greatly
manasshed the^ and send the^ word: how they should never have peace with him /
till he had as many of the town at his pleasur / as he list to have. The good
people of ye town saw well: how the matter went but yuell for them / and how
the white hattes had caused all / but there was none so hardy that durst speak
it.

Therle of Flanders went fro Male to Lyle and all his household: and than he
sent for all his lords and knights of Flanders / such as held of him / to
have their counsel. how he might do in all his besynesses: and how to be
revenged of them of Gaunte / who had done him so many dispyghtes. All the
gentylmen of Flaunders swear to him to be good and true / as they ought to be
to their lord / without any mean / wherefore therle was greatly reioysed. Than
he sent men to all his castelles / to Teremont Rypemont / Aloes / Gaures
Andwarpe / and all about he made great provision.

Of the death of Johan Lion and of other capitaynes that the gauntoyse made /
and of the good towns in Flanders: that alyed them self to Gaunt. Cap. C C
C.lii.
John^ Lion was greatly retoysed / wha^ he saw that therle of Flaunders would
take no peace with them of Gaunte / seeing he could come to no peace. And he
had than put ye town of Gaunt so forewarde in war / ye they must needs
than whether they would or not / continue the war than he said openly. Sirs /
ye may se and understand / how our lord the earl of Flanders prouydeth him
self against us: and will have no peace with us. Therefore I counsel you for
the best that or we be more grieved or opressed / let us know what towns in
Flaunders will take our part. I dare answer for them of the town of
Grau^tmont / that they will not be against us / but take our part. And in
likewise so will they of Courtray / for they be within our fraunchesse: and
Courtraye is our chamber. But behold here the^ of Bruges / who be great and
proud / for by the^ all this matter was first moved. It is good ye we go to
them so strong / that other by fayrenesse or by rygour: we may bring them to
our acorde / they all said: it were good it were so. Than by process of time /
all such as should go in this journey were made ready / and so departed fro
Gawnte about a.ix. or. (...). thousand men / and had with them great
caryages. And so lay the first night at Donse and the next morning they
aproched Bruges / and so came within a little leage thereof. Than they araynged
themself in the feldes / and set them self in order of battle / and their
caryages behind them. Than Johan Lion ordained / that a certain of the rulers
of diverse crafts should go to Bruges / and to know their ente^tes. And so
they went to Bruges and found the gates fast shytte and well kept / and there
they showed thentent / wherefore they were come thither / the kepers said they
would go gladly / and show their minds to ye borough masters and chief
rulers of their town / and so they did / than the rulers answered / go and
show them how we will go to counsel and take advise in this matter / so
they returned and showed their answer / and when Johan Lion hard that
answer / he said / auaunce forewarde to Bruges / if we a bide till they take
counsayll we shall not enter but with much pain / it is better that we
assail them or they take counsayll / whereby they shall be suddenly taken. This
purpose was kept / and so the gauntoyse came to the barryers and dykes of
Bruges. Johan Lion with the formast mounted on a black courser / and
incontinent he alyghted / and took an axe in his hand / and when they ye kept
the barryers / who were not strong enough to make defense / saw the gauntoyse
aproche ready to give assaut. They went in to the streets of the town / and in
to the market place and cried ever as they went. be hold here the gau^toyse
ready at the gate / go to your defense / for they arreredy to the assaute. Than
they of ye town who were assembled to gyder to have gone to cou^sayll / were
right sore abashed / and had no leysar to speak to gyder / to ordayn for their
business / and the most part of the comynaltie / would that the gates should
have been opened / and it behooved so to be / or else it had been yuell with the
rich men. Than the borough masters and rulers of the town with other went to
the gate / where as the gauntoys were ready apperelled to make assaut. The
borough masters and rulers of Bruges / who had the gouernynge of the town for
that day / opened the wycket to speak with Johan Lion / and so opened ye
barryers and the gate to treat. And so long they spoke together / that they were
good friends / and so entered in all toguyder. And Johan Lion rode by the
borough master / the which became him well. He was hardye and couragyous /
and all his men clean armed followed him. It was a fair sight to se them enter
in good order / and so came to the market place / and there he araynged his men
in the streres. And Johan Lion held in his hand a white warderere.

SO between them of Gaunt and of Bruges there was made an alyance and sworn
always to be good friends together. and that they of Gaunt might somou the^ and
led them whyder so ever they would. And anon after ye the gauntoyse were
arnynged about the market place. John^ Lion and certain capitayns with him /
went up in to the hall / and there made a cry / for the good town of Gaunt:
co^maundynge / that every man should draw to his lodgyng fair and easily /
and unarm them with out noise or mouyng / on pain of their needs and that no
man dislodge other / normake no noise in their lodging / whereby any strife
should rise / on the same pain. and also that no man take any thing fro
another / without he pay therefore incontinent / on the said pain. This cry
ones made: than there was another cry made for the town of Bruges / that
every man should mekely and agreeable / receive the gauntoyse in to their houses
and to mynyster to the^ vytaylles / acordynge to the comen price of the town /
and that the price should not be raised in no manner of thing / nor no noise to
be made or debate moved: and all these things to be kept on pain of their
heedes. Than every man went to their houses / and so thus right amyably they
of Gaunt were with them of Bruges two days. And there they alyed and bound
them self each to other surely. These oblygacyous were written and sealed: and
on the third day / they of Gaunt departed and went to the town of Dan / where
the gates were set open against their coming. And there they were curtesly
received / and tarried there two days. Than suddenly a seknesse took John^ Lion
/ wherewith he swelled / and the same night that ye syknes took him / he supped
with great reuyll / with the damsels of the town. Wherefore some said: he was
there poisoned / whereof I know nothing nor I will not speak to far therein. but
I know well / the next day that he fell sick / at night he was laid in a
lytter and carried to Ardenburg he could go no farther / but there dyed. whereof
they of Gaunte were right sorry / and sore dismayed.

OF the death of Johan Lion / all his enemies were right glad / and his
fre^des sorry. and so he was brought to Gaunt / and because of his death all the
host returned. When the tidings of his death came to Gaunt / all the people
were right sorry / for he was well beloved: except of such as were of the earls
part. All the clergy came against him / and so brought him in to the town
with great solempnyte / as though it had been the earl of Flaunders. and so he
was buried right honorably in the church of saint Nycholas / and there his
obsequy was done. yet for all the death of this Johan Lion / the alyances and
promyses made between them of Gaunt / and of Bruges: brake not / for there were
good hostages in the town / wherefore it held. Of the death of this John^ Lion
/ the earl was right glad / and so was Gylbert Mahewe and his brethren / and
the rulers of the mean crafts in Gaunt / and all such as were of the earls
part. Than the earl made sorer prouysion than he did before in all his
castelles and towns / and he sent to the town of Ipre / a great nombre of
knights and squiers / out of ye lyberties of Lysle and Doway / and said. how
he would have reason of Gaunt. And anon after the death of Johan Lion / all
they of Gaunte aduysed / how they could not be long without capitayns. Than
they ordained of the aldarmen of the crafts / and of the Synkquateners of the
ports: four of them / acordyng to their advise / most hardy and cruel
persons / of all other. First they chase Johan Drunaur / Johan Boulle / Raze de
Harsell / and Peter du Boys. And all the other people swear to maintain and
obey them / as their capitayns / on pain of their heedes / that did the
contrary. and the capitayns swear again to keep and maynteyne the honor and
fraunchesses of the town. These four capytayns styrred them of Gaunt / to go
to ypre and to Frank / to have obeisance of them / or else to slay the^ all. So
these capitayns and their people departed fro Gaunt / in good array. They were
a.xii. thousand clean armed / and so came to Courtrey. They of Courtay suffered
them to enter in to their town without danger / for it parteyned to the
frau^ches of Gaunt / and there took their ease two days. and ye third day
departed and went to Ipre / and took with them two hundred men of arms / with
the crosbowes of Courtray / and so took the way to Touront. And when they came
there / they rested and took counsel / and aduysed to send thither a three or
four thousand of their men / and the captain of the white hattes with the^
to treat with them of Ipre / and the great battle to follow after to confort
them / if need required. As it was ordained so it was done / and so came to
ypre and when they of Iperre / and specially they of the mean crafts knew
the coming of them of Gaunt / they armed them / and took the market place /
and they were a five thousa^de. So there the rich men of the town had no
puyssance. The knights that were there in garyson set by the earl / went
ordynatly to the gate of Touront / where as the gauntoyse were without /
desirynge to have fre enter. The knights and squires were ready raynged before
the gate and showed good defense / nor in deed the gau^toyse had never entered
without great damage / but that the ancient crafts of the town against the
knights will / would that the gauntoyse should enter. The men of the town
went out of the market place / and so came to the gate / the which the
knights kept / and said. Sirs open the gate: let our fre^des and neighbors of
Gaunt enter / we will they shall enter in to our town. The knights answered /
yt they should not enter / and said: how they were stablisshed there by the
earl of Flaunders to keep the town the which they would do to the best of
their powers. sayng / how it lay not in the puissance of Gaunt to enter there.
In somoche that words multiplied in such wise / between the gentylmen and
them of the town / that at last they cried. Sle and beat down the^ / they
shall not be masters of our town. There was a sore scrimysshe and long
endured in the streets / the knights were not of sufficyent force to resyst
against them of the town / so that there were five knights slain / whereof
two were sir Robert and sir Thomas Hundrey / the which was great damage. And
there was in great danger sir Henry Dautoynge / with much pain some of the
rich men of the town saved him / and diverse other. but the gate was set
open and the gauntoise entered / and were lords and masters of the town /
without damage of any hurt. And when they had been there two days / and taken
surety of the^ of the town / who swear in like manner and form as they of
Bruges / of Courtray / of Grantmont / and of Danne had done / and delivered
hostages for the same intent. Than they departed right courtesly / and so went
again to Gaunt.

How the gauntoyse besieged the town of And warpe / and of the great assaut
they made at Teremond where as the earl lay. Cap. CCC.liii.
THe earl of Flaunders / who lay at Lyle / understood how they of Ipre were
turned to the gauntoyse part. and that by y^ means of the^ of the mean
crafts in the town / he was sore displeased / as well for the death of his
knights yt were slain in the town / as for other causes / how be it / he
said. Well: if we have lost Ipre at this time / we shall recover it again a
another time to their myschiefe. for I shall stryke of so many of their heedes /
that all other shall beware thereby / and be abashed. The earl specially
intended to provide for ye town of And warpe / both with provision and good
men of arms. For he supposed / that the gauntoyse would come thither and lay
siege thereto / for he thought it should be to him a great damage / if they were
lords of that town. For thereby they should have the good river of Lescault /
and the flete therofat their pleasure. therefore therle sent thither a great
nombre of knights and squiers / of Flaunders of Heynalt / and of Arthoyse. And
so they were masters there / whyder they of yt town would or not. The
capitayns of Gaunt / who were returned fro Ipre in to their town again / herd
how therle made great provision for ye town of And warpe. Than they
determined to goo and lay siege thereto / and not to depart thens / till they
had it / and slain all them within / and beaten down the gates and walls
thereof. so they made a commandment in Gaunt / that every man should be ready
apparelled to go thither / as their capytayns would led them. To which cry
there was non would disobey / and so charged tents / pauilyons / and other
provisions / and departed fro Gaunt / and came and loged before And warpe / in
the fair meadows a long by the river of Lescalte. and three days after / came
they of Bruges and lodged on the side next their own town / and they brought
with them great prouisyons. Than came they of Ipre in great array / and they of
Propringe / of Messanes / and also of Grantmont. The flemynges there before And
warpe / were in nombre / mo than a hundred thousand / and had made brydges
of ships nailed toguyder on the river of Lescalte / to go one to another. The
earl of Flaunders being at Lysle / was in purpose to go to Teremont / for he
had sent in to Almayne / to Guerles / and in to Brabant / for a great nombre
of knights and squiers / and specially to ye duke of Mons his cosyn / who came
to serve him / with a great nombre of knights and squiers / and went in to
Teremont / where he found the earl of Flanders / who was come thither by y^
fronters of Haynalt / and Brabant who were right joyful of his coming.

THus the siege contynewed before Andwarpe with many great assautes made by the
flemynges / and scrimysshes nyghe every day / and manlye deeds of arms done
at the barryers / and men slain and hurt. for the flemynges adventured them
self often times folisshely. So that often times by their pride / they were
slain and hurt. Within the town there were an.viii. C. spears of knights
and squiers right valiant men. and also.vii. barons as the lord of Guystels /
the lord Uillers / the lord Hullut / the lord Scornayse. flemynges and heno
ways / the lord Danghen / the lord Dantoing / the lord Bosnell / ye lord
of Taux / the lord of Gomegines / and the three brethren sir Johan / sir
Dannyell / and sir Josse / the lord of Stanburge / the lord Carue / sir
Gerrarde of Marquelles / the lord of Cohen / sir Rafe Monteney / sir Henry of
Hamede / sir Johan of Gres. And so many knights that they were a hundred and
five / and they made good watch / and had no trust on them of the town /
and caused them to have their wyfes and children in to the mynsters and
churches / and the burgesses to keep their own houses / for fear of the
gonnes and fire / the which the flemynges cast often times in to ye town / to
have set the town a fire / wherefore they within caused the howses to be
covered with earth / to the intent that the fire should do no hurt.

THis siege thus being before Andewarpe the flemynges and capitayns that were
there / had knowledge how their lord the earl was at Teremonde / and the duke
of Mons his cosyn with him. than the gauntoyse sent a six thousand of their
men to go thither / and to give assaut to Teremonde / and Raze of Harsell was
their captain / and so they came on a tuesdaye at night / to a little village
a leage fro Teremond by the river of Ture / and there they lodged. The
flemynges had ordained a certain nombre of ships to come down the river /
and so to assail it by water as well as by land. And anon after mydnyght
they armed / and made the^ ready to fight inco^tynent / when they were ones come
to Teremonde. and so thought to take the lords in their beds / and so they
went forth. But some men of the country that were aduertysed / how the
flemynges were going by night to Teremond / they went and gave warnyng to the
wachemen of Teremonde. Saying / sirs: take good head / for certain gauntoyse
lies this night not far hens / we can not tell what they purpose to do.
Than the kepars of the gate went and showed this to the knight of the wach
called sir Terrey of Bredero a holandre. when he knew thereof he took the
better head and made the surer watch / and gave warnyng thereof to the^ of the
castle / and to every house in ye town / where as the knights were lodged.
And at the point of the day light / the flemynges came both by land and by
water / and were reoy to the assaute. And when they of the town and castle
saw them aproche / than they began to sownde their trompettes to awake all
their company / and so there were the most part of all the knights and
squiers ready armed. And the earl who lay and slept in ye castle / when he
understood that the flemynges were come thither to give him assaut / he rose and
armed him and issued out of the castle / with his baner before him. The same
time there was with him / sir Gossuyn of Urle great bailey of Flanders / and the
lord of Gau / sir Gerard of Rase^ghen / sir Philyp of Mamynes and diverse other
/ as sir Philyp of Rungi burgonyon. all these lords drew under the exles
baner / and went to the assaut / which was than begone right ferse and cruel
/ for the flemynges had brought with them in their ships / gonnes and
crosbowes / where with they shote so great quarelles / that whosoever they hit
he dyed of the stroke. But against the shot of quarelles / they within had a
great nombre of pauesses. and also the earl had within many good crosbowes the
which did much hurt among the flemynges. The duke of Mons was there with
his baner before him / and in his company there was the lord of Bredero / sir
Josse and sir Terey de la ware / sir Wyuant of Chuperoyse and diverse other /
every man doing right well their deuoyre. And at a another gate within / there
was sir Robert Dalle / sir Johan Uillayne / and the lord of Wyndscot with sir
Robert marshall. This was a sore assaute / both by land and by water / the
flemynges had many hurt / and so there were of both parts: how beit most of
the flemynges. for they adventured them self sometime folisshly. This assaut
endured without cease / fro ye morning erly till it was none / and there was
slain a knight of the earls part / called sir Hugh de Reny a burgonyon / which
was great damage and sore complained / for by his hardynesse he was slain.
Without there was Raze of Harsell / who did bear him self right valiantly /
with his words as well as with his deeds / which greatly encoraged the
gauntoyse.

Of the assautes made before Andwarpe / and of the peace that was made between
the flemynges / and therle of Fla^ders by the means of the duke of Burgoyne /
by his great wit and advise. Cap. CCC.liiii.
THan at afternoon the assawte seized / for Raze of Harsell saw well / how
they traueyled in vain / and how ye within Teremond there were many good and
valyantmen of arms / whereby he parceyued it was not easy to get them / and
also his men began to be weary. Than he sowned the retrayte / and withdrewe a
long the river fair and easly / and took again their navy / and ye next day
went again to Andwarpe. The siege lay long still there / and the flemynges
that were there / were lords of the feldes / and of the river. so that no
prouisyon could enter in to the town / without great parell / of the side
toward Haynaulte. how be it sometime vitaylers would adventure them self for
wynnyng: when the host was a sleep / to put them self within the bailes of
Andwarpe / and so had in to the town. And among the assautes that were made /
there was one that endured a hole day / and there were made diverse new
knights within the town / of Heynalt / of Flanders / and of Artoyse. and so
the new knights came and fought with the gauntoyse at the barryers. There was
a good scrimysshe and many a feate of arms done / and diverse flemynges slain
and hurt / but they made little thereof / for little they feared the death /
whereby they adventured them self the more largely. for when they that were
before were slain and hurt / they that followed would pull them back / and
set themself before and showed hardy visage. Thus continued that assaut /
which endured till it was nere night. Than they of Andwarpe returned in to
their town / and closed their gates and barryers / and than buried them that
were dedde / and dressed busely them that were hurt.

THe flemynges that lay thus at siege before Andwarpe / trusted by their sege
to co^quere the town / and them that were within by famyne or assaut. for they
knew well their siege lay so round about / that nothing could come in to the
town / another by land nor water. and the long lyeng there could not grieve
them much / because they were in their own country / and nere to their own
houses / wherefore they lacked nothing that was needful for them / for they
had vitayle / and every thing there largely / and at a better price / than
they should have had outher in Bruges / or in Gaunt. The earl of Flaunders / who
saw well ye there was in the town a great nombre of knights and squiers /
douted greatly of one point / and that was / lest by long sege they should be
famysshed within. wherefore he would gladly that there had been some honorable
treaty for him / for in deed the war thus with his men / grieved him greatly /
it was never with his good will. And also the lady his mother Margarete /
countess of Arthoyse / was right sorry to se it. And blamed the earl therefore /
and took much pain to appease it. This countess lay in the city of Arras.
Than she wrote all the matter to the duke of Burgoyne / to whom the heritage of
Flanders should fall after the death of therle / by reason of the lady
Margaret his wife. The duke who was well informed of all the matter / for every
day he hard tidings. He went to Arras and his counsel with him / as sir
Guy de la Tremoyll / sir John^ of Uyen admyrall of France / sir Guy of
Pountayllers / and diverse other. The countess of Artoyse was glad to se them /
and showed the duke right sagely all the war / between the earl of Flaunders
her son / and his country. saying / how it greatly displeased her / and
ought to displease every reasonable man. And how that a great nombre of
honorable men were within the town of Andwarpe in great perell: desiryng
therefore the duke for goddessake to find some remedy. the duke answered / and
said: He was bound so to do / and how that he would do the best of his
power. Than anon after the duke deperted fro Arras / and went to Tournay /
where he was received with great joy / for they of Turnay desired greatly to
have peace / because of their merchandise to and fro / on the river of Lescalt
/ the which was as than closed fro them. The duke of Burgoyne sent the abbot
of saint Martens to the host before Andwarpe / to know if the capitayns of
Gaunte would fall to any treaty. The abbot brought word a gain to the duke of
Burgoyn / that for his love they would be content. And so ye duke gave salve
conduct to them to the bridge of Roone / and the flemynges in likewise to him.
This treaty endured fro the morning till night / for the duke came to the
bridge of Rone / to speak with the flemynges. than the duke returned to
Tournay / and the earl in his company / who went in and out with him. This
treatye endured.xv. days / for it was hard to find means of peace / because
the flemynges would have had Andwarpe / to the intent to have had it beaten
down / but the duke and his counsel / would in no wise consent thereto. The
flemynges / who were great / fierce / and orgulous / and set nothing by peace /
for they reputed Andwarpe and all tho within in a manner yielded / Nor they
could not go out without their danger. And the duke of Burgoyne / who saw
the flemynges so proud and so hard to fall to any treaty had great
maruayle what they meant thereby. And on a day he gate a save conduct for his
marshall to go in to the town / to speak with the knights there. so the
marshall of Burgoyne went to Andwarpe and found there the company in good
point. how beit they had great need of some things / yet they spoke valiantly
/ and said. Say for us to the duke of Burgoyne / that let him make none evil
bargayn for fear of us / for thanked be god we are in good point / and have no
fear of our enemies. This answer pleased greatly the duke of Burgoyne / who
was still at the bridge of Rone. How be it for all that / he left not his
pursuit for peace. To say truth / they of Bruges and of Ipre with the^ of
Fra^ke were weary / and sore anoyed / for they saw well the winter aproched. so
they showed their minds in counsel / and said: how the duke of Burgoyne
had taken great labor / and is come hyder to us / and has offered us /
that all things should be pardoned. And the earl our lord to return to Gaunt
and to abide there with us and never to make semblant of any thing past. these
things ought to enclyne us to peace / and truly we ought to know our lord /
and not to take fro him his heritage. These words apeased much them of Gaunte
/ and accorded to their saying. And on a day the duke of Burgoyne gave a dyuer
to them of Gaunt / of Bruges / of Ipre / and of Courtray. and ye same day it
was concluded that the siege should be raised and good peace to be in Flanders
/ between the earl and his men. And the earl to pardon every thing / and
nothing to reserve without any excepcy on or dissymulacion. and the earl to
come and dwell in Gaunt / and within a year they of Gaunt / to make again the
castle of Dandrehen / the which the gauntoyse had burnt: as the noise
ran. And for the sure confyrmacyon of all these things / Johan Prunaux should
go to Courtray with the duke / and there charters of the peace should be made and
sealed. and so on this clause the duke returned to Tournay. And Johan Prunaux
/ and Johan Boulle abode still in the host. The next day the peace was cried
between both parties / and so the siege brake up / and every man went home too
their own howses / and the earl gave license to all his sowdyers to depart.
And thanked the strangers of the good service / y^ they had done to him. and so
than he went to Lysle / there to finysshe up the alyances / that his brother of
Burgoyne had made. And some of the countries there about said: that this was a
peace with two vysages. sayng how they would rebel again shortly / and that
the earl of his part was agreed to the peace / but to the intent to have out
of danger the noble knights and squiers that were in Andwarpe in great parell.

Johan Prunaux after the departing fro the siege of Andwarpe / he went to
Tournay / and there the duke of Burgoyn mad him good there / and there was made
parfyt all the ordinance of the peace / and the duke of Burgoyne / and ye earl
of Flaunders sealed thereto. and than Johan Prunaux returned to Gaunt and showed
how he had spedde. The duke of Burgoyne had so sore desired them of Gaunt /
and showed so sweet words to them / that they were content to keep the peace
ferme and stable / between them and And warpe. For at the reysyng of the sege /
the gauntoyse would have had two gates of / the town beaten down / and the
walls between / because it should always be open for them / to enter at
their pleasure. And when the earl of Flaunders had been a certain space at
Lysle / and that the duke of Burgoyne was gone in to France. Than he went to
the town of Bruges and there tarried a long season after / and showed
couertlye great displeasure to certain burgesses of the town / but he made
none other prouisyon among them. his displeasure was because they had so
soon forsaken him / and turned to the service of the^ of Gaunt. The burgesses
excused them / as truth was / that it was nothing in their fault / but the
faut was in them of the mean crafts / who would needs be alyed to them of
Gaunt / when John^ Lion ca^e thither. So ye earl passed his displeasure as well
as he might / how be it he thought never the less.

Now let us leave to speak of him and of them of Flaunders / and let us
return to the busynesses of Bretayne.

How the duke of Bretayne returned out of England into Bretayne at the
request of his men / and of the will of the englisshe men for the marriage of
their young king of England. Cap. CCC.lv.
YE have herd here before: how the duke of Bretayne was in England / with
king Richard and his uncles / who made him right good chere / and his land
was in war and in great trouble. For the french king had sent thither his
constable / with a great nombre of men of arms / who were about Po^t Toyson /
and about Mount saint Mychaell. And made war to the country / cities / and
good towns in Bretayne. Wherefore all the country greatly desired the presence
of the duke their lord / and they had sent to him diverse messangers and
letters / but he durst not trust all that: till the prelates and barons of
Bretayne / and all good towns murmured thereat / and said. We have sent for
our duke by letters diverse times / and always he excuses him self. In the
name of god quod some / he has good cause so to do: for we send for him to
simply. It were well sytting / that we sent to him a knight or.ii. dyscrete and
sage / in whom he might trust: and they to show him plainly / the state of
this country. This purpose was well allowed and holden. and so two valyant
knights were chosen to go in to England / as sir Geffray of Quaresmell and
sir Eustace Housey. And at the desire and request of the prelates and barons /
they aparelled them self to go in to England. and so took shippyng at Cone /
and had wind at will and arrived at Hampton. And fro thens they rode till they
ca^e to London / where they found the duke of Bretayne and the duchess / and
sir Robert Canoll / who received them with great chere and joy. The knights
than showed to the duke their lord / all the state and disposycion of his
country: and how his people desires to have him come home. And delivered him
letters of credence / fro the barons and prelates and good towns of Bretayne.
The duke believed well these knights and the letters also / and had great joy:
and said / how he would show the matter to the king and to his uncles / and so
he did. And when the king of England and his uncles were informed of all
these matters / and how all the country of Bretayne: prelates / barons / and
good towns. Except Claquy / Clisson / Rohen / Lauall / and Rochefort / had
sent for their lord ye duke: desyring him to return into his own country.
Than the king and his uncles / said. Sir: it is best ye go in to your own
country / sith ye be thus desired: and maintain yourselfe among your noble
men. And sir / we shall send you men of war and such conforte / that they
shall be able to keep your fro^ters against your enemies. And leave the duchess
your wife here behynd you / with her mother and brethern / and go you and make
war against your enemies. Of these words the duke was greatly reioysed / and
made him redye.

ANd shortly after / it was ordained for his departing at Hampton. And so he
took leave of ye king and of his uncles / of my lady princess / and of the
duchess his wife. And at his departing / made a great alyance with the king of
England / and swear to him by his faith / that if he were shortly conforted
by the englysshmen. He would always abide with them / and do the best of his
power / to turn his country english. And the king promised him / that he
should ever find the englysshemen ready to help him / in what soever manner he
would desire. And so he departed out of England and sir Robert Canoll with him
/ and the two knights that were come thither for him / and one hundred men of
arms and two hundred archers / and took shippyng at Hampton. And so sailed to
the port of Guerrande / where they took land / and so rode to Uennes / where
he was received with great joy: and all the country was glad / when they
knew that he was come home. The duke refresshed him there a five days / and
thanne he went to Nauntes. Thither came to se him: barownes prelates / knights
and squyers / ladies and damoselles: offryng him their service / and put them
self under his obeisance. Complaining greatly of the frenchmen / and of the
french constable who lay about Reins / and did much hurt in the country.
The duke apeased them and said: my friends / I shall have shortly comfort out
of England / for without aid of England / I can not well defend my country
against the frenchmen / for they are to bygge for us / seeing we be not all one
in our own country. And when the aid that the king of England shall send
us / be ones come: if they have done us wrong / we shall quyte them again. Of
these words were right joyful / all tho that were of the duke of Bretayns
part.

The same season about saint Andrues tide there dyed sir Charles of Boesme /
king of Almayne and emperor of Rome. And while he was lyueng / he did so
much: what for gold and silver / and great alyances that he had. That the
electours of the emperor / swear and sealed to him / that after his disceasse
/ to make his son emperor. And to aid him / to keep the siege before Ays /
and to abide with him against all men / that would deny him. So that when he
was deed / than Charles his son as emperor: wrote him self king of Almayne
/ of Boesme / and king of the romans.

THe same season there was great counsel in England / among the kings
uncles / and the prelates and barons of the realm for to mary their young king
Richard of England. And thenglysshmen would gladly have had him to ben married
in Heynalt / for love of the good lady queen Philyp / wife to king Edward the
third. Who was so good and so gracyous a lady / for all the realm large and
honorable / who was come out of Heynaulte: but as than the duke Aubert / had no
daughters to mary. The duke of Lancastre / would have had the king his
nephewe / to have had his eldest daughter / my lady Blanch of Lancaster to
his wife. But the realm would in no wise consent thereto / for two reasons. The
first / because the lady was his cosyn germayne / the which was to nere of
blood / to mary toguyder. The other cause was / they would the king should
marry without the realm / to have thereby more alyaunce. Than was there
spekyng of the daughter of the king of Boesme and Almayne / and emperor of
Rome. And to that advise every man was agreed. Than to go in to Almayne / to
treat for this marriage / was sent a right sage and a valyant knight / who had been the kings master / and was nere of counsel always with the prince of
Wales the kings father / called sir Symonde Burle. And so was ordained for him
/ all things necessary for his journey and than he departed and arrived at
Calayes. and so to Grauellyng / and than to Bruselles: and there he found duke
Uyncelant of Brabant and duke Aubert / the earl of Bloyes and the earl of saint
Poule / sir Wylliam Ma^lye. And a great no^bre of knights of Heynalt / of
Brabant / and of other places. For there was a great feast and iustynge kept:
therefore there were all these lords assembled. The duke of Brabant and the
duchess / for the king of Englandes sake / received the knight right
honorably. And when they knew the cause / wherefore he went in to Almayne /
they were right glad thereof: and said. That it should be a goodlye marriage /
between the king of England and their nephue. And at the knights departing /
they sent letters by him to the king of Almayne / showing him how they had
great desire and affectyon / that this marriage should take a good effect. Than
the knight departed fro Bruselles and went to Louuayne / and so to go to
Colayne.

How the englysshmen that were sent in to Bretayne / were tourmented on the sea: and how the gau^toise desired to have the earl of Flaunders their lord /
to come dwell in their town of Gaunt. Cap. CCC.lvi.
THe same season it was ordained in England / by the king and his counsel:
that two hundred men of arms and four hundred archers should goo in to
Bretayne. And the chyefe captain of that journey should be sir Johan Aru^dell
/ and with him should go sir Hugh Caurell sir Thomas Banystre / sir Thomas
Tryuet / sir Water Pole / sir Johan Bourchyer / ye lord Ferres / and the lord
Basset. All these knights drew to Hampton / and when they had wind they
entered in to their ships / and departed. The first day / the wind was
reasonable good for the^ / but against night / the wind turned contrary to
the^ / and whyder they would or not / they were driven on the cost of Cornwall.
The wind was so sore and streynable / that they could cast none ancre: nor
also they durst not. In the morning the wind brought them in to the yrisshe
see: and by the rage of the tempest three of their ships brast and went to
wrake / wherein was sir Johan Arundell / sir Thomas Banystre / and sir Hughe
Caurell: and a hundred men of arms. Of the which hundred / fourscore were
drowned: and sir Johan Arundell their captain was their perysshed / which
was great damage. and sir Hugh Caurell was never in his life before / so nyghe
his death: for all that ever was in his ship except him self and seuyn
maryners / were all drowned. For he and the seuyn maryners that were saved /
took hold of tables and mastes / and the strength of the wind / brought them
to the sands. Howebeit / they had drunk waterr enough: whereof they were
right sick and yuell at ease. Out of this danger escaped / sir Thomas Tryuet
and sir Johan Bourchyer / the lord Ferres / the lord Basset / and diverse
other: but they were sore tourmented and in great parell. And after that this
tempest was ceased they returned again to Hampton / and went back again to
the king and his uncles / and recounted all their adventures / wenyng to the^
that sir Hughe Caurell had been drowned with the other. How be it that was not
so / for he was gone sick to London. Thus brake up that journey / whereby the
duke of Bretayne could have no comfort of the englysshemen / which was right
contraryous to him. For all that season and the winter following / the frenchmen
made him right sore war: and the bretons. As sir Olyuer Clysson and his
company / took ye town of Dyna^t in Bretayne / by reason of vessels and
barges. And so the town was pylled and robbed / and was kept against the duke
a long season after. Now let us return to the business of Flaunders.

When ye peace was agreed bitwene the earl of Flaunders and them of Gaunt / by
the means of the duke of Burgoyne / whereby he gat him self much thank in
the country. The intent and pleasure of them of Gau^t was / to have their lord
therle of Flanders / to dwell with the^ in Gaunt / and there to keep his
householde. The earl also was counsayled by ye provost of Hardebeque / and of
the^ that were next about him to do so / whereby he should norisshe great love
/ between him and them of Gaunt. The earl lay still at Bruges and came not to
Gaunt / whereof they had great marueyle / and specially the good and rychmen of
Gaunt / and such as were sage and wise: for they desired nothing but peace.
But the palyerdes and white hattes / and such as desired rather strife and
debate / they cared nothing for the earls coming. For they knew well that if
he came / they should privily be corrected at last / for the yuell deeds that
they had done. Not withstanding that they were in this doubt / yet they that
had the gouernyng of the law / the cou^saylers and good men of the town /
would for any thing / that he should come thither / and that they should go and
require him so to do. For they thought they had no ferme peace / without the
earl came thither. And so there was ordained.xxiiii. men to go to Bruges: to
show to the earl the great affection that they had to have him. and so they
deperted honorably / as it aparteyned for them ye should go for their lord:
and it was said to the^ by them of the town. Sirs / return never again to
Gaunt / without ye bring therle with you: for if ye do / ye shall find the
gates closed against you. Thus these burgesses of Gaunt rode forth toward
Bruges / and between Bruges and Donsay / they herd say: how the earl was
coming to Gauute ward / whereof they were right ioyouse. And they had not
ryden past a leage farther / but that they met the earl in the feldes. Than
the burgesses stood still on both sides of the way / and so the earl and all
his company passed through them. As he passed by / the burgesses enclyned them
self right low and humbly / and made great reverence to the earl. The earl
rode through them / without any great regardyng of them / but a little put
his hand to his hat / nor all they way / he made to them no semblant. So the
earl rode on the one side / and the gau^toise on the other / till they came to
Donse / and there they rested: for the earl did dyne there. And the gauntoyse
went to other lodgings and dyned also.

ANd after dinner / the gauntoyse in good array / came to the earl and kneled
aldowne before him / for therle sat. And there they presented right humbly /
the affection and service of them of the town of Gau^t. and showed him how by
great love they of Gaunt / who desired so much to have him with them / has
sent them to him. And sir / at our departing / they said to us: that it were
but a folly for us to return again to Gaunt / without that we brought you
thither with us. The earl / who right well herd these words / held his peace
a certain space. And at last when he spoke: he said fair and softely. Sirs /
I believe well it be as ye say: and that diverse of Gaunt desires to have me
among them / but I have marueyle of that they remember not / nor will not
remember of time past / what they have showed me. and I have been to them so
courtesse^ meke and gentle / in all their requests. And I have suffered to be
put out of my country / my gentylmen / when they have complained of the^ /
to acquyte their law and justice. I have also opyned diverse times my prisons /
to deliver out their burgesses / when they have desired it. I have loved and
honored them / more than any other of my country / and they have done to me
clean contrary. They have slain my baylye / and distroyed the houses of my men
/ banysshed and chased away mine officers / and brent ye house in the world
that I loved best. Enforced my towns / and brought them to their ententes /
and slain my knights in the town of Ipre. And have done so many tres passes
against me and my seignorie / that it is noyfull to me to record it. and I
would I could never think on it / but I do and shall do / whyder I will or
not. A right dear lord / said they of Gaunt / for gods sake never regard
it: ye have all things perdoned. It is truth quod the earl. for all my
words / in time to come I will ye shall be never the worse. But I show it unto
you sirs / for the great cruelties and felonyes / that I have found in them of
Gaunt. Than the earl apeased him self and rose up on his fete and caused them
to rise / and said to the lord of Ruyselyers / who was by him: go get some
wine. So they of Gaunt drank and departed to their lodgings / and tarried
there all that night / for so did the earl. And the next day all together /
they rode to wards Gaunt.

How the earl of Flanders entered in to the town of Gaunt / and of his
departing thens / without knowledge of any of the town. and how the walls
of Andwarpe were beaten down / by the white hattes and their fellows. Cap.
CCC.lvii.
When they of Gaunt understood that the earl was coming / they were right
joyful / and came and met him / some a foot and some a horse back. And they
mekely enclyned the^ self low / and did him reverence: and he passed forth /
without and word speaking to any of them / and but a little enclyned his
heed. And so came to his logynge / called the Posterne / and there dyned / and
had many presents given him / by them of the town. And there came to se him
they of ye law of the town / and humbly enclyned themself to him / as reason
required: and the earl said. Sirs / good peace requires nothing but peace.
Wherefore I would / that these white hattes were laid down / and amends to be
made for the death of my baylye for I am sore required therein of all his
lynage. Sir quod the men of law / it is right well our intent / that it should
so be. And sir / we require your grace with all humylyte / that it may please
you to morrow nerte / to come in to an open place / and there to show your
intent to the people. And wha^ they se you / they will be so reioysed / that
they will do every thing that ye shall desire them / than the earl accorded to
their request. The same evening many folks knew in ye town how the earl
should be the next morning by.viii. of the clock in the market place / and
there preche to the people. The good men were right joyful thereof / but the
foles and outrageous people gave no fear thereof / and said: how they were
preched enough / and how they knew well what they had to do. Johan Prunaux
Raze de Harsell / Peter Boyse / and Johan Boule capitayns of the white hattes
douted lest all that matter should be laid on their charge / and than they spoke
together / and sent for such of their company as were most outrageous / and
worst of all other / and said to them. Sirs / take heed this night and to
morrow and let your armure be ready / and what so ever be said to you / put
not of your white hattes / and be all in the market place to morrow by.viii. of
ye bell / but make no styrring nor strife / without it be begone on you / and
show all this to your companyes / or else send the^ word thereof. They said it
should be done / and so it was. In the morning at.viii. of the cloak they came
in to the market place / not all together / but in diverse plumpes. The earl came
to the market place a horseback / a co^panyed with his knights and squyers /
and them of the law of the town / and by him was Johan Faucyll and a.xl. of
the most rychest of the town. therle as he came a long the market place / he
cast his eyes on the white hattes / and was in his mind right sore displesed
with the^ and so a lighted and all other. Than he mounted up in to a wyndowe
and leaned out thereat / and a reed clothe before him: And there he began to
speak right sagely / she wynge them fro point to point: the love and affectyon
that he has had to them or they displeased him. There he showed how a prince
and lord ought to be beloved feared / served and honored of his men: and how
they had done the contrary. Also he showed / how he has kept and defended
them against all men: and how he had kept them in peace / profit / and
prosperyte / in the passages of the sea / the which was closed fro them. At
his first entering in to his land / he showed the^ diverse reasonable points /
which the wise men understood and conceived it clearly / how all that ever he
said was truth. Diverse gave good care to him and some never a whytte / such
as had rather have war than peace. And when he had been there the space
of one hour / and had showed them all this and more. Than finally he said:
how he would be their good lord / in like manner as he had been in time
past. And pardoned them of all the iniuryes / hates / and yuell wylles / that
he had against them: and all that they had done. He would here no more
thereof / and to keep them in their rightes and seignories / as in time paste
had been used. How be it he desired them / that they should begin no new thing
nor custom / and that the white hattes should be laid down. At all these
words that he spoke before / every man held their peace / but when he spoke
of the white hattes / there was such a murmuring and why sperynge / that it
might well be parceyued / that it was for that cause. Than therle desired them
swetely / every man to draw to their own houses. And so every man departed
out of the place / but the white hattes were the first that came thither / and
the last that tarried. And when the earl passed by the^ they smyled / and
folisshely beheld him / and they made no reverence to him / whereof the earl
was sore displeased in his mind / and said to his knigh tes / when he came to
his lodging. I trow I shall never come easily to mine intent / against these
white hattes / they are unhappy people. My heart gives me / that ye matter will
not rest long in the case that it is now in. For as ferr as I can parceyue
/ they are likely to do many yuell deeds: for though I should lose all / I
can not suffer them in their pride and yuell doings.

THus therle of Flanders was there a four or five days / and than deperted /
so that he returned no more thither again. and so went to Lysse / and there
ordained to lie all ye winter. At his departing fro Gaunt / he took leave of no
man: but departed in displeasure / wherewith diverse of the town were right
yuell content / and said. How they should never have any good of him / nor he
would never love the^ / nor they him. And how he was deperted fro the^ at that
time / as he had done in time past. And that Gylbert Mahewe and his brethren /
had counsayled him so to do. Seeing he was departed so sodaynlye fro Gaunt.
Johan Prunaur / Raze Harsell / Peter de Boyse / Johan Boule / and the yuell
capitayns / were right ioyouse of his departing: and sowed lewd words about
in the town. Saying / how that or somer come therle and his men will break
the peace. Wherefore they said: it were good that every man took head to him
self / and that they provide for the town / corn and other vitayls: as
^esshe and salt / and such other things. Saying how they could se no
surety in the earl. So they of Gaunt made provision of diverse things that was
necessary for the^ and for the town. Whereof the earl was enfourmed / and had
great marueyle / wherefore they douted them self in such wise. To say truth
/ all things co^sydred: in that I say or have said before. It may be
marueyled: how they of Gaunt dissymuled them self / so at the beginning as
they did. The rich / sage / and notable persons of the town: can not excuse
them self of these deeds at the beginning. For when Johan Lion began to
bring up first the white hattes / they might well have caused them to have been
laid down / if they had list. And have sent other manner of persons against
the pioners of Bruges / than they but they suffered it / because they would not
medell / nor be in no business nor prease. All this they did and consented to
be done / the which after they derely bought / and specially such as were
rich and wise. For afterward they were no more lords of them self / nor they
durst not speak nor do nothing / but as they of Gaunte would. For they said:
ye another for John^ Lion nor for Gylbert Mahewe / nor for their wars or
enuyes / they would never depart a sondre. For whatsoever war there were
between one or other / they would be ever all one: and euerredy to defend the
fraunchesses of their town the which was well seen after: for they made war
/ which endured seuyn year. In the which time there was never strife among
them in the town. And that was the thing that sustained and kept the^ most
of any thing / both within and without. They were in such unity / that there
was no dystaunce among them: as ye shall herafter in this history.

IT was not long after / that therle of Flaunders was departed fro Gaunt and
returned to Lyle. but that sir Olyuer Dauterne / cosyn germayne to Roger
Dauterne / slain before in Gaunt. Sent his defyance to the town of Gaunt /
for the death of his cosyn: and in likewise so did sir Philyppe of Mamynes /
and diverse other. And after their defyances made: they found a forty ships
/ and the maryners to them parteyninge / of the burgesses of Gaunt / who were
coming on the river of Lescaulte / charged with corn. and there they revenged
them of the death of their cosyn / on these ships and maryners. For they all
to hewed the maryners / and did put out their eyes: and so sent them to
Gaunt / maimed as they were / which dispyte / they of Gaunt took for a great
injury. The learned men of Gau^t / to whom the complayntes came / were right
sore displesed / and wist not well what to say. Great murmuryng was in the
town / and the most part of the people of Gaunt / said: how therle of
Flaunders had caused all. so that there durst no man excuse him. And as soon
as Johan Prunax herd these tidings / who was as tha^ capitayn of the white
hattes / without any word spekyng to the^ of the law. I can not say: whyder he
spoke with ye capitayns of other co^panyons or not. I think rather ye tha^
nay. So he took the most part of the white hattes / and diverse other folowers
/ ready inoughe to do yuell: and so departed fro Gaunt and came so daynly to And
warpe. When he entered first / there was no watch nor kepers / for they feared
no man. And so he and his company entered in at ye gate to the nombre of five
thousand and mo. And the next morning / he set warkemen a warke carpentars
and masons / such as were there ready with him / to do his commandment. And so
he ceased not / till he had beaten down two of the gates / and ye walls and
towers between them / and laid them up so down / in the dykes toward Gaunt.

How may they of Gaunt excuse the^ self that thus consented to this dede^ for
they were at And warpe / beatynge down these walls and gates more than a
month. If they had sent for these men to have come back again / when they
herd of it first / than they might well have been excused but they did not
so. They wynked rather with their eyes / and suffered it / till tidings came
to the earl / who lay at Lysle / how John^ Prunaur had by stelthe come in to
Andwarpe and beten down two of the gates with the walls and towers. Of which
tydinges the earl was sore displesed / and also he had good cawse so to be /
and said. A these unhappy cursed people the devil I trow is with them. I
shall never be in joy as long as they of Gaunt have any puissance. Than he
sent to Gaunt some of his counsel / showing the^ the great outrage that they
had done / and how they were no people to be believed in making any peace.
seeing yt the peace / which the duke of Burgoyne had made to his great labor
and pain / was now thus broken by them. The mayre and learned men of Gaunt
excused them self / and said. that saving the earls displeasure / they never
thought to break the peace / nor never had will thereto. For though Johan
Prunaur had done that outrage of him self / the town of Gaunt will in no wise
auowe / suffer / nor sustain it. And so plainly and truly excused them self
/ and said moreover. how the earl had consented thereto / for they be issued
out of his house / such as have done this great outrage / slain and may med
our burgesses / the which is a great inco^uenyence to the hole body of the
town. How say ye sirs / to this (...) they? Than therles comissaryes replied
/ and said. sirs: than I se well ye be revenged. Nay not so quod they of the
town / for though yt Johan Prunaur have done thus at Andwarpe / yt it is done
for any reuengyng. We say not so / for by the treaty of the peace / we may
prove and show / if we list. And that we take record of the duke of Burgoyne
/ that we might have done with Andwarpe / and have brought it in to the same
point / that it is now at. but at the desire of the duke of Burgoyne / we to
ware and suffered it undone as at ye time. Than the earls comyssaries said. It
apereth well by your words / that ye have caused it to be done: and that ye
can not excuse your self therein. Sith that ye knew that Johan Prunar was
gone to Andwarpe / with an army of men of war: and by stelth under the
shadow of peace / has beaten down the gates and walls thereof. ye should
have gone before the^ / and have defended them fro doing of any such outrage
(...)ll ye had showed your complayntes to (...). And of the hurtyng and
mayminge of your burgesses of Gaunt / ye should therein have gone to ye duke of
Burgoyne / who made the peace / and have showed him all your co^playnt. (...)
than ye had amended your matter / but ye have not done thus. Now sith ye have
my lord the earl of Flaunders thus displeased / ye send to excuse your self.
ye desire peace with your swerdes in your hands: but I ensure you one day he
will take so cruel vengeance on you that all the world shall speak thereof. So
the earls comyssaries departed fro them of Gaunt / and went by Cortray to Lyle
/ and showed to therle what they had done: and thexcusacyons yt they of Gaunt
made for them self.

How the gauntoyse rendered And warpe / and of the houses of the noble men of
Flaunders that they beat down. And how the war began bitwene them and the
gauntoyse right cruel / and without pytie. Cap. CCC.lviii.
THe hearing speaking of the treating of this process / may well be marueyled
/ for the marvelous matter therein. Some gives ye right of the war / the
which was at that time / great and cruel in Flanders: to the^ of Gaunt.
Saying / how they had a good and a just cause to make war: but I can not se
that / as yet. For I could never se nor understand / but that the earl loved
ever peace rather than war. Reseruyng always / his highness and honor.
Did he not at their desire / deliver their burges out of his prison of Erclo?
and yet for all that they slew his bailey: and tha^ he again perdoned the^
that great outrage / to thentent to have kept the^ in peace. And ouerthat
again: on a day / they moved all the country of Flaunders against him / and
slew in the town of Ipre / five of his knights. And went and assailed and
beseged And warpe / and did their pain / to have dystroyed it. and yet again
they had of the earl peace: but for all that / they would make none amends /
for the death of Roger Dauterne / the which his lynage often times desired.
Wherefore they somewhat revenged the death of their cosyn / on a certain
maryners: by whom all this war and myschefe was begone. Was this yet any
reasonable cause / why they should beat down the walls of Andwarpe? I think
and so did many other / that it was none occasyon so to do. They said therle
was rather in their debt than they in his / and that he should make them
amends for that / that had been done to their maryners ^or ever they would
deliver again And warpe. The earl who was at Lysle and his counsayll with him
/ was right sore displeased / in that they kept And warpe / and wist not well
how to get it again. and so repented him of the peace that he had given
to the gauntoyse / and he wrote often times to them / co^maundynge them to
deliver up And warpe / orels he would make them so cruel war / that it
should be ever had in remembrance. They of Gaunt / would in no wise auowe the
deed / for if they had / they had broken the peace: finally certain good
people of Gaunte / and rich men / who would have no thing by their wylles: but
peace: went so between in this matter. As John^ Faucyll / Gylbert Guyse / sir
Simon Bet and diverse other. that the.xii. day / they of Gaunt being in the
town of And warpe returned a gain to Gaunte / and delivered the town to the
earls servants. and to apease the earls displeasur / John^ Prunaur was
banisshed Gau^t and all Flaunders / because by his aduyce the commons had taken
And warpe / without knowledge of the substance of the town of Gaunt. And on
the other part / the earl banysshed out of all Flaunders: sir Phylippe of
Mamynes / sir Olyuer Dautern / the Galoys of Manes / the basterde of
Wrydrymines / and all tho that were cause of the mayminge of the maryners /
burgesses of Gaunt / without knowledge of the earl / and so by the reason of
these banisshynges / both parties were apeased. So Johan Prunaux forsook the
country of Flaunders / and went to Athe in Brabante / and there dwelled. and
sir Phylip of Mamynes went to Ualencennes in the cou^tie of Haynalt / but when
they of Gaunt knew thereof / they did somoch to the provost of Ualencennes /
called John^ Patryse who in fair manner / caused the said knight to depart
thens. and so he departed with his good will and went to Warlam beside Do way /
and there tarried till he hard other tydinges / and the other knights and
squiers voyded Flanders and went in to Brabant. And as soon as the earl had
again possessyon of And warpe / he set warkmen a warke and new repaired the
town better than ever it was before / both walls / gates / and dykes. The
gau^toyse knew well how the earl new fortefyed And warpe / but they made no
semblaunce thereof / bycawse they would no fault should be found in them / as
in brekynge of the peace. But the foles and outragyous people / said among
them self. let the earl alone in his warke / for though he make And warpe
ofstele / yet it can not endure against us / if we list. For all this peace
thus in Flaunders / they of Gaunt were ever in suspect with the earl / and the
earl with them / for daily there was brought to the earl hard tidings of them
of Gaunt. And in likewise to them of Gaunt of the earl. Johan de Faucyll went
and dwelled at Nazareth / in a fair house that he had / a leage fro Gaunt: and
so hell ay there still dissymulynge as much as he might / and would not be in
counsel with the^ of Gaunt / because he would not be noted by the earl. And
also he kept him fro the earl as much as he might / to keep him still in love
with the^ of Gaunt. Thus he swamme bitwene two waves / making him self newter
/ as nere as could. In the mean time while the earl repaired the town of And
warpe he procured so much by his letters / to his cosyn the duke of Burgoyne
/ to send him Johan Prunaur being at Athe / that so he did / and sent him to
the earl / and so he was sent to Lysle and there beheeded / and than set one
a whele like a traitor. Thus dyed John^ Prunaur. Than ye earl went to Ipre /
and did there great Justyce / and beheeded many yuell ruled people / such as
had before been at the death of his five knights / there slain / and had
opened ye gates to them of Gaunt / and this he did to thentent that other
should take ensample by them.

OF all these matters ye gauntoyse were well enfourmed / wherefore they douted
more than they did before / and specially the capytayns such as had been
forth in their iourneys and before And warpe. And they said among them self /
certainly if the earl may: he will destroy us all he loves us well / for he
will have nothing but our lives. Has he not put to death Johan Prunar? To say
troth / we did John^ Prunaur great wrong / when we banysshed him fro us. we
are therefore culpable of his death and to the same end we shall all come / if
he may get us at his will / therefore let us take good head of ourselfe.
Than Peter de Boyse said. Sirs / if ye will believe me: there shall not a house
stand upright / of never a genytlmans in the country about Gaunt. for by
reason of the gentlemen's houses that be now standing we may be all distroyed
/ if we take not head thereto betymes / and provide for some remedy. That is
truth quod all the other let us go forth and bear them all down. Than the
capitayns Heter du Boyse / Johan Boule / Raze de Harsell / Johan de Launoy and
diverse other with their companyes departed on a day fro Gau^t / and brent and
beat down all the gentylmens houses there about / and took all that ever was
in them / and departed it among them self / and when they had done / they
returned again to (...). They found never a man that would say sirs: ye have
done evil. When the gentlemen knights and squiers being at Lysle with the
earl and there about / hard tydinges how their houses were brent and beten
down / and (...) goods takenne away / they were right so^^ displeased / and
not without a good cause. They said to the earl* sir: this dispyght must be
(...) and the pride of them of Gaunt beaten down. Than the earl gave leave and
abandoned to the knights and squiers to make war against the gauntoyse /
and to counteruenge them of their domages. Than diverse knights and squyers of
Flaunders alyed them self tog^der / and desired their friends of Heynalt to
a^de to revenge them of the gau^toyse / and they made their captain the ^as^e
of Flaunders / the youngest son bastard of the earls a right (...) knight.
this knight with his company sometime lay at And warpe another time at Gaures /
and sometime at Alos / and at Teremond / and scrunysshed with the gau^toyse
daily and sotyme ran to the barryers of the town of Gaunt. And beat down the
wyndmyls about y^ town / and did great dispyght to them of Gaunt / and with
them there was a knight of Heynalt / called sir James of Uerchyn^ seen shall of
Heynalt. he did many feats of arms in that season about Gaunt / and
adventured him self often times right ieoperdously. He fought two or three
times at the barryers / and wanne bassenetes and crosbowes / and other a
bylementes of war. This knight loved well the noble feate of arms / and had
been a valyant knight if he had lived long / but he dyed young in his bed in
the castle of ^ubre beside Mortayne / which was great damage.

How the noble men of Flanders made war against the flemynges / and of the
death of sir Berteram of Clesquy coustable of France. Cap. CCC.lix.
When the gauntoyse saw them self thus mocked and warred by the gentlemen of
Flaunders / they were right angry therewith / and thought to have sent to earl
Aubert earl of Haynault / desirynge him to have found the means / to have
caused these gentylmen / to leave their war a gaynst them * but when they had
all things considered / they thought they should lose their pain / for they
were sure the earl Aubert / would do no thing for them / nor they would not
dysplease him / nor put a thing to him / that should be to his displeasure.
For they might yuell live with out the favor of his country / for if Holand
/ zelande / and Haynault had been closed fro them they thought them self but
lost. Therefore they left that purpose and took a another counsel / and yt was
/ to send to the knights and squiers of Haynalt / such as had herytages /
rentes / or revenues in Gaunt or in ye precynct thereof / that they should come
and serve them / or else to lose their re^tes and revenues there. and so they
sent to them / but it auayled them but little / for they set but little by
their commandments. Than they of Gaunt sent to the lord Dautoyng and to sir
Herne / who was an heryter in the town of Gaunt / and constable of the same /
that they should come and serve them / or else to lose such right as they had
there. and because they came not nor would come / they beat down their houses.
The lord Dautoyng sent the^ word how he would come and serve them at their
cost and charge to their distruccyon / and yt they should have no another trust
in him / but that he would be their ennemy / and hold nothing of them / but
of the earl of Flanders his lord / to whom he owed service and obeysa^ce.
The lord Dautoyng held well his promise / for he made mortal war against
them / and did them great damage / and made great prouisyon in his castle /
which garyson did much traueyle to them of Gaunt. Also ye lord of Daughen /
who was a young squier called Gaultyer / he did also great dispyte to them of
Gaunt. Thus continued still the war / and the gauntoyse durst not issue out
of their town / without they were in great companyes / and when they found
any of their enemies they had no mercy / but having the better slew all
before them. Thus began the war to be right cruel between the earl of
Flanders and the gauntoise / the which cost after a hundred thousand men's
lives / twice told. it was great pain to find outher end or peace / for the
capitayns of Gau^t knew well they had so trespassed against their lord / the
earl of Flaunders / and against the duke of Burgoyn / yt for any treaty of
peace sealyng or sweryng what soever it were. yet they thought they should
never have peace / but that it should cost them their lives. This dought and
fear caused them to be of that opinyon / and to keep still the war against
the earl and the gentylmen of Flaunders. and also this fear gave them courage
to keep war / and as their adventures fell / ye shall here after in the story.

THe earl of Flanders being at L^^e hard daily news fro the them of Gaunt /
and how they brent and beat down gentylmens howses / wherewith he was sore
displeased / and said. how he would take such vengeance on them / that he
would bring all Gaunt under flame of fire / and the rebels within it. Than
the earl to be the more stronger against them / sent for all his barons of
Flaunders / and abandoned his country / to them to resyte against the white
hattes / and appointed two gentylmen to be their captayns / that is to say: the
Galoys of Mamynes / and Peter Destreueles. These two with their companies bare
with them the earls baner / and so about a three wekes they lay between And
warpe and Courtrey / on the river of Lys / and did great damage to them of
Gau^t. And when Raze of Harsell herd thereof / he issued out of Gaunte with
all the white hattes and came to Douse / and there he had thought to have
found the earls company / but the men of arms / when they knew of the
gau^toyse coming / they withdrewe toward Tourney / and so tarried in the town.
And the gauntoyse lay a great season about Orches / Danne / and Uorlam / so
that the marchantes durst not go between Doway and Tourney for fear of them.
And it was than said: how the gau^toise would go and lay siege to Lyle / and
therle with in the town. They alyed them self with them of Bruges and Ipre /
and they had Grantmont and Courtray of their acorde. But Bruges and Ipre varyed
and were not agreed with y^ crafts / for they said: it should be a great
folly for them / to ^ay siege so far of as Lysle. and how that the earl might
have great alyaunce and aid of the french king / as he has had before. these
doutes and other / stopped the good towns of Flanders for making of any war
/ or layeng of any siege in that season. And for the^tent that the earl should
have no help nor aid of the french king / nor of the duke of Burgoyne / his
son. They sent messangers and meke letters to the king / desyring him for
gods sake / yt he should give no counsel nor aid to therle of Fla^ders /
to their damage or hurt. For they would nothing but peace / love / obeisance /
and service to their lord. Wherefore they said / their lord did great wrong
/ so to traueyle and grieve the^ And all that ever they did / was to sustain
the frau^chesse and lyberties / the which their lord would take fro them in
his cruelty. The king some what enclyned to them / without any semblant making.
In likewise so did the duke of Aniou his brother for all that the earl of
Flaunders was their cosyn. yet he was not greatly in their favors / because of
the duke of Bretayne whom he kept with him in his country / against their
wylles a long season: Wherefore they took no great head to his business. No
more did pope Clement / for he said that god had sent therle of Flanders that
rod and punysshment / because he was his enemy / and held with pope Urbane
against him.

THe same season the good knight and constable of France / sir Bertram of
Clesquy was in Auuerne with a great no^bre of men of arms. And lay at sege
before New castle of Raudone / a three leages fro the city of Pie in Auuergne
/ and had closed in the castle nine englysshemen and gascoyns / enemies to the
realm of France. Who were issued out of Lymosyn / where as were many
forteresses. The constable gave many sore assautes to the castle / and swear:
that he would never depart thens / till he had the castle at his pleasure.
But than a great sickness took him / and so lay in his bed: but for all
that the siege brake not up / for his men were more angrye than they were
before. Of this sickness sir Bertram dyed / which was great damage to his
friends and to ye realm of France / and he was borne to the freers in Pie /
and there he was one night / and fro ^hens he was carried to saint Denyse in
France / and there he was laid in sepulture / nere to the tomb of king
Charles / which the king had made for him in his days / and so he lay at
the kings fete. And there his obsequy was done right honorably / as though he
had been the kings son. And there was all the kings brethren / and
notable persons of the realm of France. Thus by the death of sir Bertram of
Clesquy / the office of the constable ship of France was void. Than it was
ordained and aduysed / who should be constable. There were named diverse great
barons of France / and specially the lord Clysson / and the lord of Coucy.
The king would that the lord Coucy should have had the office / and that he
should be regent of all Picardy. and the king gave him all the land of
Mortayne / the which was a fair heritage / lyeng bytwne Tourney and
Ualencennes. And sir James Uerchyne was put out thereof / who was constable of
Heynalt. He held it by succession of his father / who had been lord thereof / a
great season before. The lord of Coucy was in great favor with the french
king / and the king would have had him constable of France but the gentle
knight excused him self by diverse reasons / and would not take it on him / and
said. How sir Olyuer Clysson was more worthy then he was to have it / for he
was a worthy knight / hardye and beloved and known among the bretons. So
thus the matter abode a long season / than sir Bertrams men returned in to
France / for the castle yielded up the same day that ser Bertram dyed / and
they of the garrison went in to Lymosyn to the garyson of Uentadore. When the
fre^ che king saw the co^stables men / he gave them great gifts.

Now let us leave to speak of them / and show how sir Thomas earl of
Buckyngham youngest son of king Edward the third / made a great army of men
of arms and archers / and passed with his host through the realm of France
/ and went in to Bretayne.

Of the earl of Buckyngham / youngest son to king Edward the.iii. who passed
with a great army thorough the realm of France / to go in to Bretayne to the
duke there. Cap. CCC.lx.
VE have herd here before: how that when the duke of Bretayne departed out of
England / king Richard and his uncles had promised him to send men of arms
and archers to aid him. The king kept his promise / but yuell fortune came
thereof: for sir Johan Arundell was sent thither with two hundred men of arms /
and they had such fortune / that they were nyghe all perysshed in the sea by
tempest. Sir Hughe Caurell and sir Thomas Tryuet were saved with great pain /
there was perysshed a fourscore archers and as many men of arms or mo. And so
by that fortune this army was broken for that time. The duke of Bretayne had
great marueyle and all those on his part / that they could here no word of
them / they could not consider nor ymagenne what let they had. Feign they
would have known / to the intent to have had some comfort / for they were
sore ouerpressed by sir Olyuer of Clysson / sir Guy de la Uall / sir Olyuer of
Clesqui earl of Langueuylde / and the lord Rochforte: and the frenchmen that
lay about the fronters of Bretayne. Than the duke was counsayled to send
sufficient messangers in to England / to know the cause why they came not /
and to have them forther for they had need of their help. The lord of
Beaumonoyre and sir Eustace Housay / were desired by the duke and by them of
the country / to take on them that voyage in to England. They answered / how
they were content to go. Than they had letters fro ye duke of Bretayne / and
fro them of the country / and so they deperted and took shyppinge and had wind
and wether at their pleasur / and arrived at Ha^pton. And than issued out of
their vessel and took horse and rode to London. This was about Whytsontyde /
the year of our lord god / a thousand three hundred and fourscore.

THe king of England was anon certifyed of their coming. So the king went
to Wyndsore: to keep the feast of Penthecost there / and with him his uncles /
and a great nombre of barons and knights of England. And thither came these two
foresaid knights of Bretayne / and were honorably received of the king and
of his uncles / and of all other / and there they delivered their letters to
the king and to his uncles. They reed them / and knew thereby / how the duke
of Bretayne and his country / desired them effectuously of aid and confort.
There these two knights knew of ye death of sir Johan Arundell / and the
other that were perysshed in the sea / going toward Bretayne. and so there the
duke of Lancastre excused the matter / and said. How the king nor his counsel
was in no fault / but the fortune of the sea / against the which no man can
resyst / when god will have it so. So the knights held the king excused / and
greatly complained ye death of those knights / so perysshed in the sea. The
feast of Pe^thecost passed / and than they held a parlyament at Westmyuster /
and there was all the kings counsayll. And in the same mean season there dyed
at London / sir Rychard Dangle earl of Hu^tyngdon / and was buried in the friar
Augustynes. The king caused his obsequy to be done right honorably / with a
great nombre of prelates and barons of England / and the bishop of London
sange the mass. Than anon after began the parlyament / and there it was
ordained y^ sir Thomas of Wodstocke youngest son to king Edward the third
/ and diverse barons / knights / and squiers with him / should pass the sea
and land at Calayes / and so to pass by the grace of god through France /
with three thousand men of arms and as many archers / and so to come in to
Bretayne: like the son of a king.

He took on him a great thing as to pass through the realm of France / the
which is so great and so noble / and wherein there is so noble chyualry / and
so valyant men of arms. When these things were thus determined and the voyage
concluded and agreed. Than the king of England and his uncles sent letters to
the duke of Bretayne and to them of the country / gyueng them knowledge of
their ententes / and of their counsel and parlyament that they had concluded
at London. How that without fault / sir Thomas of Wodstocke earl of Buckingham
youngest son^e to king Edward the third / should shortly pass the sea to
come and socour the^. The king of England honored greatly these knights of
Bretayne and gave them great gifts / and in likewise so did his uncles / and
so they departed and returned in to Bretayne / and delivered their letters to
the duke / and he opened and red them / and saw what they contained / and so
showed them to the lords and knights of his country / who were well content
with that answer. The king of England and his uncles forgate not the voyage
that was appointed / but sent for all them that were chosen and appointed to go
with the earl of Buckyngham / who were both barons / knights / squiers / and
other / and they were paid for their wages at Dover for three months / their
wages to begin as soon as they should be arrived at Calayes / as well men of
arms as archers. and their passage was delivered them frank and fre / and so
they passed little and little and arrived at Calays / and it was a.xv. days or
they were all past. They of Boloyne saw well how men of arms and archers
were issued out of England and landed at Calays / and gave knowledge thereof
over all the country / and to all the french garysons / to the intent that
they should take heed every man to his part. So that when these tidings were
known in bolonoyse / and thoronyse / and in the county of Guynes / knights /
and squiers of the country drew into the forteresses / and put therein all
that they had for fear of lesynge. And the capitayns of Boloyne / of Arde /
of Monteire / of Spirlo que / of Tornehen / of Horns / of Lyques / and of
other castelles on the fronters there / intended greatly to provide for their
places / for they thought / seeing the englisshmen were come over in such a
nombre / yt they should have some assautes given to some of them. The tydinges
of this passage of ye englisshmen was brought to king Charles being at Paris.
Than in co^tynent he sent to ye lord Coucy to saint Quintynes that he should
provide formen of war and to go in to Picardy / to comfort his cities towns
/ castelles / and fortersses there. The lord Coucy obeyed the kings
commandment / as it was reason / than he made a somo^s of knights and
squiers of Picardy / Arthoyse / and Uermandoyse to mete at Peron in
Uermandoyse. The same time the lord of saint Pie was capytayne of Arde / and
of Boloyne / sir Johan Bouillers. This sir Thomas of Wodstocke earl of
Buckynghame youngest son to king Edward the third: arrived at Calays three
days before Maudlyn tide / in the month of July / the year of our lord god a
thousand three hundred and fourscore.

How the earl of Buckyngham and the englisshmen departed fro Calats to go in
to France / and of their order. Cap. CCC.lxi.
When the earl of Buckynghame was aryued at Calays / the companyons had great
joy / for they thought well not to tarry long there / but to go forth on their
vo^age. The earl refresshed him two days at Calays and on the third day
departed and took the way to Marquegnes. It were reason that I show you the
names of the bauers and pensels that were there with the earl. First the earl
of Buckyngham himself / therle Stafforde / who had wedded his nece / daughter
to ye lord Couey and therle of Dymestre. These lords rode with baners
displayed / the lord Spensar constable of the host / the lord Fytz water
marshall the lord Bassette the lord Bourgthyer / the lord Ferres / the lord
Morlay / the lord Parsy sir Wyllyam Wynsore sir Hughe and aurell sir Hugh
Hastynges / and sir Hughes. all these by one assent rode with their standerdes
and penons: sir Thomas Percy / sir Thomas Tryuet / sir Wyllyam Clynton / sir
yuon (...) sir Hugh Torell / the lord of Uar(...) Eustare and sir Johan
Harbeston / ser Wyllyam Feruytone / the lord of Briame / sir Wyllyam Fabre /
sir Johan and sir Nycholas (...) court sir Johan Mase / sir Thom^s Camoyse /
sir Rafe son to the lord Neuell / ser Henry bastard Ferres / sir Hughe Broe
/ sir (...) Orsell / sir Thomas West / the lord of (...) More / Dauyd
Holograue / Hugh Lyn / (...) bastard Bernarde of Coderers and diverse other.
These me of war rode in good (...) and great array. The first day they
deper(...) Calais / and went no farther than to Marquegues. And there rested
and took counsel what way were best for the^ to take to furnysshe there
voyage for there were diverse in that cu^(...) that had never ben in France
before / as the e^^e himself and diverse other great barons and knights.
Therefore it was reasonable / that such persons as had been in France before
and knew the country / should have such rule and gouernynge / that it might
be to their honor. Threw it was / that when the englysshmen in time past had been in France / they had ever such ordinance among them / that the (...)
swear ever to the king of England and to his counsel two shynges. The one
was: that they should never disclose their secre (...) person lyueng but among
themself / (...)der they intended to go. The second thing was: they swear and
promised to make no manner of treaty with their enemies without the knowledge
of the king or his cousayle.

When chese barons / knights / and squyers and their company: had rested the^
at Marquegnes three days / and that every man of their company was come to them
out of Calais / and that the capitayns were determined what way to take. They
deperted and went for the till they came before Arde / and there rested them
before the bastyde of Arde / to thentent to show themself before the me^ of
arms / that were within the forteresse. And there was made new knights by
the earl of Buckyngehanm; as therle of Dymestre / and also the lord Morlay.
and than those two knights put for the their baners / and moreover therle made
knights: all such as follows. First the lord Fytzwaters son sir Roger
Strange / sir John^ I pre / sir John^ Coll / sir James Tytiell / sir Thomas
Ramston / sir Johan Neuell / and sir Thomas Roste: and than all the host went
and lodged at Hosque. All these foresaid new knights were made / because of
the vowarde / the which went the same day to a strong house stadynge on the
river side / called Folant. Within was a squire: owner of the house / called
Robert / he was a good man of arms: and had well furnysshed his house with
good men of arms the which he had got therabout / to the nombre of xl. And
they made good semblant to defend themself and their house. These barons and
knights in their new knyghthod / enuyroned about the tower of Fola^t: and
began fiersly to assail them within / and they within valiantly defended
themself. There was done many feats of arms and they within short so holly
and quickly together / that they hurt diverse assaylantes such as adue^tured
themself to much forward, for they had within diverse good crosbowes sent
thither by the captain of saint Omers / at the request of the squire / for he
feared before: that the englisshmen would pass by his house wherefore he
thought to keep it to the best of his power / and so he did: for he bare
himself right valiantly. Than the earl of Dymestre spoke a high word / as he
stood on the dykes / his baner before him / the which word greatly encouraged
his people. Saying sirs: how is it thus in our new knyghthode / that this
peuysshe douchouse holds against us so long? The strong places and
fortresses that be in the realm of France shall hold long against us /
sithe this small house endures so long. Sirs on a fore / let us show our
new chiualry. They that herd these words noted it right well / and
adventured them self more largely than they did before / and entered in to the
dykes and so came hard to the walls. and there the^glissh archers shot so
holly together / that scant non durst apere at their defense, there were diverse
slain and hurt / and ye base court won and brent: and so finallye they were
all won. How be it / first they defended themself tight valiantly / and
never a man within / that was wounded to death. Thus the house of Folant was
taken / and Robert Folant within taken prisoner by therle of Dymestre / and all
the temnant taken prisoners by his men. And all the host lodged on the river
of Houske / abiding for sir Wyllyam Wyndsore / who led the rerewarde / and
was not as than come / but he came the same night: and the next day they
disloged and rode to Esperleque and there lodged. The captain of saint Omers
/ seeing the englysshmen so nere to them / increased the watch of the town /
for that night they watched ^o than two thousand men / to the intent that
saint Omers should not be sodayuly wonby the englysshmen.

THe next morning about sire of the clock the englisshmen dislodged / and rode
before saint Omers. and when they of the town saw thenglisshmen come / they
armed them and ordained them self in the market place to go to the gates and
walls by good dely(...)cyon / for it was shewedde them / how the englysshmen
would assail them: but it was not in their thoughts. For they knew well the
town was to strong / and thought they should lose there more than win. How
be it she earl of Buckyngham / who had never ben in France before / thonght he
would sesaynt Omers / because it seemed so fair a far of: in walls / gates /
towers / and steples. So he rested all his host on a mountain half a leage
fro the town araynged in good order / more than three hours. And than there
were some young knights and squyers thought to prove theymselfe / and rode to
the barryers of the town / and hesyred to just with some of the knighted or
squyers in the town / but they could have none answer / and so they
returned again to the half. The same day that the earl ca^e before saint
Omers he made again new knights. First sir Rafe Neuell / sir Bartylmewe
Bourgehter / sir Thomas Camoyse / sir Fouke Corbette / sir Thomas Danglure sir
Rafe Perypars / sir Aoyes of saint Albyne / and sir Johan Paul. These new
knights in their first churalry to prove themself / rode to the barryers of
the town(...) desired iustes: but they wered / and so retourded again to
their host. When the earl and his company / saw that the (...) of France /
such as were within (...) would not issue in to the feldes array (...) than
they passed farther. And the same day (...) and loged at Esquyles / between
say(...) and Tyrwyn: and the next day they rodeth ward Tyrwynne.

When they of the garysons in the county of Bolayne / Artoyse / and Guynes:
saw the dealing of the englysshmen / and how they went always forward
without restyng. They showed their wylles each to others and determined to
pursue the english host / thinking thereby somewhat to win. So they
gathered together / and assembled under the standerde of the lord of Fresures /
and of the lord of saint Pie. They were a two hundred spears: and than they
coosted and pursued the englisshmen / but the englysshmen kept themself ever
so close to guyder without disorderynge / that the frenchemen could get none
advantage. How be it sometime the frenchemen encountered with the english
foragers and ouerthrue them(...) fore they durst not go a foragynge but (...)
companyes. Thus thenglysshmen rode forth and paste Tyrwynne without any thing
doing: for the lord of saint Pie / and the lord of Tresures were there. And
the host lodged at Bethwyn / and there tarried a day / and I shall show you
why.

ye have herd here before: how king Richard of England / by thaduyse of
his uncles and of his cousayle. He had sent in to ^lmayne a knight of his
(called sir Simon Burle) to ye king of romans / to have his sustre in
marriage. The knight had so well spedde / y^ the king of romans assented thereto
by the counsel of all the great barons of his court. And the king of romans
sent in to England with sir Simon Burle / the duke of Casson to advise the
realm of England / to se how it should please his suster / and to make an
enue of the matter. for the cardynall of Rauene was all redye in England / who
held with pope Urbane and converted the englysshmen to the opinyon of Urbane /
Haryed for the coming of the said duke, who at the king of Englandes desire /
and the duke of Brahantes: both he and all his company had asau^co^duct / to
pass through the realm of France to come to Calays / and he ca^e by (...)
and Bethwyn. And so came and saw therle of Buckyngham / who received him(...)
norably / and the next day they took leave each of other. and so the almayns
came to Air and to saint Omers / and so to Calays. And therle and his host
went to Liques / and lodged that day at Bohayne. And always the lord of saint
Pie and the lord of Fresures pursued y^ host / and in the morning the host
disloged and went toward Bethwyn. In the town there was a great garyson of
knights and squyers / perteynyng to the lord of Couty: as the lord of
Ha^gest sir Johan and sir Trystram of Roye / sir G^ffray of Chargney / sir Guy
Harcourt / and diverse other. The host passed by Bethwyn and went to Douchers /
and at night the lord of saint Pie and y^ lord of Fresures entered into
Bethwyn. (...) the next day they went to Arras where they found the lord of
Coucy / who received them joyfully / and demanded of them what way the
englysshmen took. And they answered and said: how they had lain the same night
at Do^chers / and showed him how they rode wisely and close together. Than the
lord Coucy said / than it seems well y^ they demand nothing but battle /
the which they shall have if y^ king our lord will a gretherto / or they
have aco^plysshed their viage. Therle of Buckyngham passed by Arras in good
order of battle / and went and lodged at Anette / and the next day at
Myramount / and so to Clery on the river of Sum. When the lord Coucy being
at Arras / understood how they took that way / he sent the lord Hangest to
Bray / on the same river of Sum / and in his company.xxx. spea^es knights
and squyers. and to Peron he sent Jaques of Uerchyn seneshall of Heynault / the
lord of Haureth / sir John^ of Roy and diverse other. and went him self
toward saint Quitynes / and sent the lord of Clary and diverse other in to
Uerma^dorse / For he would not that by his negligence / the country should have
taken any damage.

How the lord of Brymewe and his children were takenne by the englysshmen and
all their company. And how they of the garyson of Perone were chased into
their town hastily Cap. CCC.lxii.
THe same night that the englysshmen lodged at Clary / certain knights among
the^: as sir Thomas Trivet / sir Wyllyam Clynton / and sir yuon of Fytzwaren /
by the mouynge of their lord Uarchyne / who knew well the country / and they
knew well how the lord of Coucy was with a great nombre at Arras / thinkyng
surely / that he would ride the next morning to se if they could mete with
any of their english foragers / for they knew well / his desire was to do
deeds of arms: and as they thought so it fortuned. So the englysshemen with a
thretie spears rode forth and followed far of fro their foragers at
adventure. The same day there departed fro the city of Arras / the lord Coucy
with a great company / and took his way toward saint Quyntines. and when he
was in the feldes / the lord of Brimewe and his children / departed fro the
lord Coucys company / with a thretie speres: like men that desired to find
adventures. and suddenly the french men and englisshmen met each with other
/ so that there was no remedy but to fight. so they cried their cries / and at
their first metyng there were many overthrown / slain / and hurt on both
parties: and there was done many a feate of arms and than lyghted a foot and
did valyantly / so that for the space of one hour / none could tell who
had the better. How be it finally the englysshmen had the vyctorie: and sir
Thomas Tryuet took the lord of Brimewe and his. (...). sons / Johan and
Loyes / and there were taken a sixtene men of arms / and the other saved them
self. Than the englysshmen returned a gain to their host / and so tarried
about Peron / for they had knowledge by their prisoners how the lord of
Coucy was at Perone with a thousand spears / and could not tell wheder he
would fight with the^ or not. The same day there went out of the host with
the foragers / the lord of Uerchyne and Ferchras his bastard brother / and
sir yuon Fytzwaren and diverse other / and rode to the mount saint Quyntyne and
there lay in a busshment. For they knew well / that the seneshall of Heynalte
was at Peron with certain men of arms / and they knew well he was so young
and lusty / that he would issue out to seek for some adventure / and so he did.
The vowarde sent. (...). men of arms to ren before Perone: as Terrey of
Soubezmayne / the bastard of Uertayne / Hugelyn Caurell and Hopkyn Hay /
mounted on good horses. And so they rode to the barryers of the town / and
within with the seneshall of Heynaulte were a fyftie spears. And he caused the
barryers to be opined / and had thought to have trapped those fore ryders / and
so fell to chasyng of them / and they fled for the nones toward their
bussheme^t. And when they of the busshment saw the frenchmen chase their
company / they issued out of their enbusshment / but it was a little to sone
For when the seneshall and his company saw that great nombre against them /
they returned and fled. And the englysshmen followed after / as fast as their
spurs would drive their horses / and the frenchmen found the barryers opyn /
as hap was for them. How be it they were so nere followed / that diverse of
them were taken prisoners / as sir Richard of Marquylles / sir Loyes of Uerchyn
/ Honarde of Honardery / and vytall of saint Hyllary / and a ten other men of
arms: and the other saved them self. And when the englysshmen knew / how
that the seneshall / the lord of Hauerathe / and the lord of Clerey: and
twenty other knights were escaped away / they were sorry / and said. if we
had taken them / they should well a paid forty thousand frankes. And so
they returned to the host / and there was no more done that day. The host
tarried a three days at Clery and there about / and on the fourth day / they
departed and went to the abbey of Uancyll / a three leages fro Cambrey / and the
next day toward saint Quyntines. The same day / a company of the duke of
Burgoynes rode abroad a.xxx. spears / and came fro Arras to saint Quyntines.
And sir Thomas Tryuette / sir yuon Fytzwarenne / and the lord of Uertayne /
and diverse other englysshmen / beyuge before with their fore^gers / as they
would have taken their lodging / they encountered the burgonyons / and so
fought together / but it endured not long / for anon the burgoyons were
dysceuered and fled away / saving them self as many as might. How be it sir
Johan Moruay a hode still in y^ place and his penon before him / and fought
valia^tly / but finally he was taken / and ten men of arms with him. Than the
englysshemen went to Fousons a two leages fro Amyens / and there the vowarde
lodged.

How the englysshmen brent and wasted the country of Champayne / and of the
encounterynges that they had in their way / and of the prisoners that they
took. Cap. CCC.lxiii.
THe next morning wha^ therle of Buckyngham had herd mass / he took his way
toward saint Quintynes / in y^ which town there was a great nombre of men
of war / but they issued not out. There were certain currours that ran to the
barriers but anon they deperted / because the host passed by without taryeng /
and went to Origny saint Benet / and there lodged / and in the vyllages
therabout. In the town of Origney was a fair abbey of nonnes / and y^ same
time the abbess there / was aunt to the lord of Uertayne / who was in the
vowarde. and so at his desire / the abbey and town was saved fro brennyng /
and therle lodged in the abbey. But the same euenyng and the next morning /
there was great scrimysshing at Ryllemont not ferr fro the host / and diverse
slain and hurt on both parties. The next morning the host disloged fro Origny
and went to Cressy / and than passed at Uaux beside Laon / and lodged at
Syssone. and the next day they passed y^ river of Aigne at the bridge of Uayre
/ and so went to Hermouyll and to Hormissy a four leages fro Reins / and
found nothing in their way* for every thing was put into the good towns and
in to fortresses. The french king had abandoned to his me^ of arms / all that
ever they could get abroad in the country. So thenglysshmen had great need / and
specially of flesh: than they determined to send to Reins to treat with
the to send vitayle to their host / as a certain qua^tyte of beestes / bread
/ and wine. They of Reins answered / how they would do nothing at their
desire / they badde the^ do as they list. the englysshmen were so sore
dyspleased with that answer / y^ within a weke after / their currours brent
beyond.lx. vyllages in the marchesse of Reyns. Also the^glysshmen had certain
know lege / how they of Reyns had within their dykes a great no^bre of
beestes. So the forward came thither and made their men to enter into the dykes
and chased out all those beestes for none durst issue out of the town / nor
make no dese^ce for the archers were on the dykes and shot s^ thick / that
non durst apere on the walls. So there the englysshmen had mo / than.xx.
thousand beestes of one and other: and yet they (...) again to them of the
town / showing the^ how they would burn all their corns without they would
send out in to their host seem bread and wine. They of Raynes douted that
tidings / and so they sent sire chares laded with asmoch bread and wine as
they could carry / and by that means their corn was saved fro brennynge. So
thenglysshmen passed by Reins in good order of battle / and went to Beaumount
for they had passed the river beside Reins. And when they disloged fro
Beaumount on the river of ^yell / they rode fort^e to pass the river of Maren
/ and so ca^e to Conde: and there they found the bridge broken. How be it ye
stays and posts stood still / and there they found plankes and tymbre / and
so made again the brige / and than passed over and lodged in the vyllages
about Maren. and the next day they came to the town of Uertues / and there was
a great scrimysshe before the castle / and diverse sore hurt. Therle lodged in
the town of Uertues and in the night the town was brent / all save the abbey
wherein the earl was lodged / else it had been also brent. for they of the
town were withdrawn in to the castle / and would give nothing to save it.
The next morning the host disloged and passed by the castle of Moymer / which
parteyned to the heritage of the lord of Chastellon / the scrimysshers came to
the barryers / and so passed forth and lodged at Pelayng / aprochyng toward
the city of Troys / and the next day at Plancy on the river of Aube. Than they
rode forth / the lord of New castle and Johan his brother / and Raymonde of
saint Marsyn gascoyns / and other englysshemen about a.xl. spears of one and
other. But they found none adventure a great while / where with they were sore
displeased. At last they saw coming in the feldes a great company of men of
arms ridyng toward Troyes / which was the lord of Hangest and his company.
Than the englysshemen and gascoyns proched their horses with their spurs /
and followed after them. The lord of Hangest had well auewed them / and douted
lest they had been a greatter company than they were in deed / and said to his
company. Sirs / let us ride toward Plancy and save our self / for the
englysshmen has discovered us / and are nere to us / let us save our self
in the castle of Plancy. So they drue thither. And the englysshmen fold wed
fast after. There was a man of arms of the lord of Uertaygnes retynewe / an
expert man of arms / named Peter Berton well horsed. he laid his spear in
the rest / and ran after the lord of Ha^gest / who fled before him. So
that his spear poyat touched his back behind him / thinkyng to have stryken
him out of his sadell. How beit for all that / the lord of Hangest lost
another sadell nor slyrroppe / and yet still the other man of arms held still
rennyng ye spear point at his back / and so he came to Plancy. And at the
entryng in to the castle / the lord of Hangest so daynly lepte fro his horse
and entered a foot in to the dyke. Than they of the castle intended to save him
/ and so came to the barryer / and there was a great scrimysshe / for they of
the castle shot sore / for they had many good crosbowes. There was done many
a proper feate of arms / of the one part and of the other. So with great pain
the lord of Hangest was saved / who right valiantly ^ought at his first
entryng in to the castle / and still came thither people of ye vowarde. The
lord of Uer taygne / sir Thomas Tryuet / sir Hughe Caurell / and diverse other
came thither / so that there was asore battle / for there were slain and taken
of the french part about a.xxx. and ye base court of the castle brent / and
the castle assailed on all parts / ye which was well defended / and the
mylles about Plancy brent and beten down. So than the host drew again
together and passed the river of Aube / at the bridge at Angle and rode toward
Ualant / on the river of Said. So thus that day the lord of Hangest was in
great adventure.

THe same day the lords of the vowarde / sir Thomas Tryuet / sir Hughe Caurell
/ the lord of Uertayne / the bastard his brother / Peter Berton and diverse
other / rode forth and encountered sir Johan of Roye / and a.xx. spears
parteyninge to the duke of Burgoyne rydinge to Troyes. The englysshmen spyed
them and followed after as fast as they could drive their horses. The
frenchemen thought to save them self / for they were not men ynowe to abide
them / and so the most part saved them self. And sir Johan of Roy and diverse
other / put them self within the barryers of Troyes / for as than they were
open. And so in the tournynge again of the englysshemen / they took four
prisoners who came to short to save them self. Among the which there was a
squire of ye duke of Burgoins (called Gyon) an expert man of arms. his horse
was right sore chafed. So he rested in the field / and had at his back a mire
/ and there he fought right valia^tly / against two englysshemen / who spoke to
him in english / and badde him yield him: but he wist not what they said. The
bastard of Uertayne / as he returned fro the chase came to them / and said to
the squire in french / yield the. And when he understood him / he said again.
what are you? a ge^tylman. The bastard answered / and said yetrewely. Well
quod he / than I yield me to you. And so took him his gauntelet and his sword.
than the englysshmen would have slain him / in the bastardes hands. Saying
how he was not courtesse / to take from him their prisoner / how be it the
bastard was stronger than they and so saved his prisoner. Than at night
questyon was made thereof before the marshalles / and so all things consydred /
the bastard kept still the prisoner / who raunsomed him ye same night / and
trusted him on his faith / and sent him the next day to Troyes. Than the
host lodged at Bala^de on the river of Said / and ca^e to a village a leage
fro Troyes / called Ber nare saint Simple / and there the great lords had a
great counsel together.

How thenglisshmen came before Troyes / and of the bastydes that the duke of
Burgoyne made without Troyes / to resyst the englysshmen. Cap. CCC.lxiiii.
IN the cite of Troyes was the duke of Burgoyne and had made there his somons /
for he had entensyon and was in will to sight with thenglisshmen / between the
river of Said and yone. And also the barons / knights and squyers of France
/ desired none other thing. But Charles the french king / would in no wise
acorde thereto / because of doubt of fortune. For he remembered much the great
losses and domages: that the nobles of his realm had of time past / by the
vyctories of the englysshmen. Wherefore he would in no wise that they should
sight / with out it were to their great advantage. The duke of Burgoyne was at
Troyes / and with him the duke of Burbone / the duke of Bare / the earl of Ewe
/ the lord Coucy / sir Johan of Uyen admyrall of the sea / the lord of Uyenne
and of saint Croyse / sir James of Uyenne / sir Water of Uyen / ye lord of
Tremoyle / the lord of Uergy / the lord of Rengemont / the lord of Hambey /
the seneshall of Heynalte / the lord of saint Pie / the barone of Habers / the
lord of Roy / the vycont Dassey / sir Wyllyam bastard of Langers / and mo
than two thousand knights and squiers. And it was showed me / how the lord
Tremoyle was sent by the duke to the king to Paris / to get license to fight
with the englysshmen: and he was not returned ye same day / that thenglysshmen
came before Troyes. The frenchmen within Troyes thought surely / that the
englysshmen would not pass by / with out lokyng on the town. Wherefore they made
without the town / a bow shot of fro ye gate: a bastyde of great tymbre /
wherein might well be a thousand men of arms. In the euenyng in the host /
all (...)ayns went to counsel to determyne what they should do the next day.
Than it was concluded / that every man with their baners and penones well armed
/ should ride before Troyes / and to abide in the selde. and to send to them
of the town / to demand battle. So in the next morning they armed them /
and set theymselfe in three batayls / and so came in to a fair plain before
Troys / and there tarried. Than two harauldes / as Chandos and Aquitany / were
sent for to the earl of Buckyngham. And when they were come the earl said.
Sirs / go your wa(...)s to Troyes / and show the lords there: how (...)
beyssued out of England to do deeds of arms / and where as we might have it
/ to demand therefore. And because we know well / how a great part of the
s^oure delyse / and of the chiualry of France is within the town. Therefore
show them / we become this way. and if they will any thing / say to them /
they shall find us in the field / in the same form and manner / as ye shall
leave us and in such wise / as they ought to find their enemies. So the
haraldes departed and rode toward Troyes / thentre of the bastyde was opyned
to them / but they could not get to the gate of the town. There issued out
so many men of arms and cross bows / setting the^ self in order of battle:
the harauldes had on their cotes of arms of therle of Buckynghams. the lords
demanded of them what they would / and they answered / and said. how they
were sent to speak with the duke of Burgoyne.

IN the same season / that these harauldes should have done their message / the
duke of Burgoyne and the lords with him / were be sy to set their men in
order of battle. The englisshmen thought verily to have had battle / wherefore
there were made new knights. First sir Thomas Tryuet brought his baner rolled
up toguyder / to the earl of Buckyngham / and said. Sir / if it please you / I
shall this day display my baner / for thanked be god / I have revenues
sufficyent to maintain it withal. It pleasethe me right well quod the earl.
Than the earl took the baner / and delivered it to sir Thomas Tryuet / and
said. sir Thomas: I pray god give you grace to do nobly this day / and always
after. Than sir Thomas took the baner and displayed it / and delivered it to a
squier / whom he trusted well. And so went to the vowarde / for he was
ordained so to do / by the capitayue the lord Latymer / and by the marshall
the lord Fitz water. And there were made new knights: as sir Peter Berton /
sir John^ and sir Thomas Paulle / sir John^ Syngule / sir Thomas Dortyngnes /
sir John^ Uassecoq sir Thomas Brasey / sir Johan Brauyne / sir Henry Uernyer /
sir Johan Coleuyll / sir Wylliam Eurart / sir Nycholas Styngule / and sir Hughe
Lunyt. And all these went to the first battle / bycawse to be at the first
skrimysshe. Than the earl called forth a gentle squire of the county of
Sauoy / who had been desired be fore to have been made knight / both before Arde
and saint Omers. This squier was called Rafe of Gremers / son to the earl of
Gremers. The earl of Buckyngham / said to him. Sir / if god be pleased / I
think we shall have this day battle / wherefore I will that ye be a knight.
The squier excused him self / and said. Sir god thank you of y^ noblenes
that ye would put me unto. But sir: I will never be knight / without I be made
by the hands of my natural lord / the earl of Sauoy / in battle: and so he
was examyned no farther. It was great pleasure to be hold the Englisshmen in
the field and the frenchmen made their preparacyon in their bastyde / for they
thought well at the leest / to have some scrymishe. Thinkyng that such men as
thenglisshmen were would never pass by / without so^e manner of face or
skrimysshe. The duke of Burgoyne was there without the town armed at all pieces
/ with an are in his hand / and so all knights and squiers passed by him to
the bastyde / so that there was so great prease / that no man could go
forewarde / nor the harauldes / could another go forward nor backewarde /
whereby they could not come to y^ duke to do their message as they were
commanded.

Beside the earl of Buckynghams commandment to the two harauldes / there were
diverse other / that said to them. Sirs / ye shall go forth and do your message
/ and beside that: say to the duke of Burgoyne. How that the duke of Bretayne
/ and the country there / has sent to the king of England to have comfort
and aid / against a certain barons and knights of Bretayne / rebels to the
duke / who will not obey to their lord: as the most part of the country
does. But make war in the country / and shadow them self / under y^
french king. And because the king of England will aid the duke and the
country / he has now specially sent one of his uncles / the earl of
Buckyngham / with a certain nombre of men of war / to go in to Bretayne / to
confort the duke and the country. Who arrived at Calays / and has taken their
way to pass through the realm of France / and so they be forward in their
journey hyder / to the city of Troyes, where as they knew well / there is a
great nombre of lords / and specially the duke of Burgoyne / son to the
french king disseased / and brother to the king that now is. wherefore ye may
say to him how sir Thomas earl of Buckyngham / son to the king of England
disseased / and uncle to the king that now is / desires of him battle. The
harauldes or they went / they demanded to have had letters of credence /
consernynge that matter. and they were answered: how they should have had
letters the next day / but in the moruynge they had taken other counsel / and
said. How they would send no letters / but badde them dept / and said. Go
your ways / and say as ye have been informed / ye are credable enough / if they
list to believe you. So the haraldes departed (as ye have herd before) and the
new english knights had begone the scrimysshe / so that all was in
trouble. And certain knights and other of France / said to the haraudes. Sirs
/ what do you here? get you hens ye be here in great parell / for here be yuell
people in this town. Which doubt / caused the haraldes to return again /
without any thing doing of their message. Now let us show what was done in
this scrimysshe.

FIrst there was an englisshe squyre borne in the bysshoprike of Lyncoln^ / an
expert man of arms / I can not se whyder he could se or not: but he spurred
his horse his spear in his hand / and his targe about his neck. his horse
came russhyng down the way / and lepte clean over the bars of the barriers /
and so galoped to the gate / where as the duke of Burgoyn and the other lords
of France were / who reputed that deed for a great enterprise. The squier
thought to have returned / but he could not / for his horse was stryken with
spears and heaten down / and the squier slain. wherewith the duke of Burgoyne
was right sore displeased / that he had not ben taken a live as prisoner.
Therewith the great battle of the earl of Buckynghams came on a foot / toward
these men of arms in the bastyde / the which was made but of doors / wyndowes
/ and tables. And to say the troth / it was nothing to hold against such
men of war / as the englisshmen were / wherefore it could not long endure.
When the duke of Burgoyne saw them coming so thick and so great a nombre /
considering how his nombre was not sufficyent against them. commanded every
man to enter in to the town: except crosbowes / and so they entered in at the
gate little and little / and while they entered / the genowayes cross bows shot
continually / and hurt diverse of the englisshmen. There was a sore scrymishe /
but anon the bastyde was conquered / it could not endure against englisshmen.
So the frenchmen entered again in at y^ gate / and as they entered: they set
themself in order in the streets. There was the duke of Lorayne / and the
lord Coucy / the duke of Burbon and diverse other between the gate and the
barryers / there was many a feate of arms done. some slain / hurt / and
taken. When the englisshmen saw the frenchmen withdraw back / they in
likewise reculed back / and stood still in order of bataile the space of two
hours / and than returned to their lodgyng / and y^ next day they went to
Maylleroys the Uycount / nere to Sense in Burgoyne / and there the host tarried
two days to refresshe them / and to get vitayles in the country / for they had
no great plenty.

THus ye have hard well: how the englisshmen rode through the realm of
France to go in to Bretayne / and it was said / and they also mayntayned /
how the duke of Bretayne and the country had sent for them / and made no
war in the name of their lord the king of England / but named them self to
be sowdyers of the duke of Bretaynes. King Charles of France was well in
fourmed of all these matters / and sagely and wisely he abuysed the parels and
insyde^tes that might grow by this war / and saw well how the country of
Bretayne with the aid of the englysshmen were contrary to him / and thereby he
feared leest the fortune of the war should be to him y^ more harder. And
specially by reason of the duke of Bretayne / for by him the good towns of
Bretayne should be his enemies / and be opyned to his enemies / whereby he
should have great preiudyce. Wherefore he sent sweet letters and gracyous to
them of Nauntes / the which was the key and chief town of all Bretayne.
showing the^ / how the^glysshmen as they rydde through the realm do make
their auaunt and afferme / how they be soudyers and sent for by the^ / and by
the other commons of Bretayne. And also she wyng them / how that if it be so /
that they will so continue / they do yuell and run in the maledyction and
sentence of the holy father the pope. And in the forfeyture of two hundred
thousand florens / the which he may than laufully take of them / and
whereunto they are bound by their writings sealed. and by the treaties made
here tofore / whereof they have y^ copy / wherefore they ought not to forget it.
And also he showed them how he has been always their friend and lover / and
has conforted and aided the^ always in their busynesses / and counsaylinge
the^ / that they should not do so far / whereby they might take wrong.
Saying: how they had no such tytell as to complain of him / or to enter in
to such a war / as to receive his enemies. Wherefore he counsayled them to
be well aduysed / and if they have been yuell exorted and cou^sayled by feeble
counsel / yet he would pardon it / so that they opyn not their town to the
englysshmen his enemies. And in their so doing he promised the^ to menteyne and
keep up their fraunchysses and lyberties / and to renew it if need required.
Wha^ these offers thus made by the french king / was presented to the^ of
Nau^tes / and well debated among them. Than the most notable of the town
(said) how the king had cause and right to say as he did / for surely they
said: how they had sworn and writings sealed / how they should never do
none anoyaunce to the realm of France nor aid nor assyst none enemy to the
king or to the realm. Wherefore they took head to y^ matter / and sent secretly
to the king / desyring him to take no thought for that matter / for they said:
thenglyshmen should not be sustained by them / nor enter in to their town / to
run or to make any war to the realm of France. Howbeit they desired the
king / that if need required / to be aided and comforted by some of his men /
to who^ they said / they would open their town / and to none other. When the
french king herd this treaty he was right glad thereof / and believed well
their words / for Nauntes had been always good french. And of all this knew
no thing the duke of Bretayne / who was at Uennes / he believed surely that
they of Nauntes would have been true and steadfast to him / and to have opened
their town to the englysshmen when they came thither. Now let us return to
the englysshmen / who were lodged nere to Sense in Burgoyne / in the which
city was the duke of Bare / the lord Coucy / the lord of saint Puye / the
lord of Fresures and their companyes.

How the englysshmen rode and pylled the country of gastenoyse and of Beause.
And how a french squire right valiant requyredde an englisshe squier to just
with him. Cap. CCC.lxv.
When the earl of Buckyngham and his host had well rested them at Maylleroyes
the vicount. Than they took counsel to draw in to Gastenoyes. Than they
passed the river of Dyone / and their ^oreryders went to the faubories of
Se^ce. and the next day they lodged at saint John^s of Nemour and therabout and
than at Beause in gastenoyes. And there the host tarried three days because of
the good ple^tyfull country that they found there. Than they took counsel /
whyder they should hold and keep the plain way of Beause / or else by the
river of Loyre. Than they determined to take the way of Beause / and to go
toward Tourey in Beause. In the castle of Tourey was the lord of saint Pie
/ sir Olyuer of Manny / sir Guy of Baueux / and a great nombre of men of war.
And at yenuyll in Beause was the lord of Uylames / the Barroyse of bars and
diverse other / about.iii. C. spears. So thus in all the castles and fortresses
(...) Beause / there were men of war set / to re syst against thenglisshmen.
The english vowarde came and scrimysshed with the^ of Tourey / and diverse
hurt on both parts. There the earl of Buckyngham and all his host was lodged
about / and found there great plenty o^ vitayls. At the scrimysshe before
Tourey / there was a squire of Beause auaunsed him self without any setting on by
any other person / and came to the barryers scrimysshynge / and said to the
englysshmen. Sirs / is there any gentylman among you / that for the love of his
lady will do any deed of arms. If there be any / here I am ready to issue out
armed at all pieces a horse back to ren three courses with a spear / to stryke
three strokes with an axe / and three strokes with a dagger. Now let us se if
there be any amorous among you. This squire was called Gawen Mychaell. This
word and request was anon spredde among the englysshmen. Than an english
squire / called Joachym Cathore: stepped forth / and said. I am here / ready to
deliver his request: let him come out of the castle. Than the lord Fitz water
marshall of the host / came to the barryers / and said to sir Guy le Baueux
Cause your squire to come forth / he shall find one will be gladd to deliver
him / and we shall assure him in all things. Gawen Mychaell was right ioyouse
of those words / and armed him incontinent / and the lords did help to arm
him / and set him a horse back. So he issued out of the castle and three with
him / and the varlettes bare: three spears / three axes / and three daggers. He
was greatly regarded by the englysshmen / for they believed before / that there
was no french man that would fight body for body. And in the same challenge /
they should have three strokes with the sword: so he had also three swerdes
borne after him.

THe earl of Buckingham was informed of this challenge / and said. How he would
go and se it him self. And so he mounted on his horse / and the earl Stafforde
and the earl Dymestre with him / and for this cause seized the assaut at
Tourey* the englysshmen drew thither to se these iustes: than the englysshman
ca^e forth armed at all pieces mounted on a good horse. When they were come in
to the place / there spears were delivered them / and so ran each at other /
and myssed by reason of stryuinge of their horses. The second course they met
and ataynted. Than therle of Buckyngham said / hola: cease for it is late. And
than he said to the constable / cause the^ to cease / for they have done enough
for this day. They shall end their enterprise another season at more leysar /
than we have as now. and take good head / y^ the french squire lack nothing /
but let him be as well kept as our own squire. And show or cause to be
showed to the^ of the castle / that they take no care for their squire / for
he shall go with us to perform his enterprise / not as a prisoner / for if he
escape a live / he shall return again with out parell. The earls words were
acomplyshshed / and it was showed to the squier / by ye marshall / how he
should ride with them without any danger / and when the earl is content / ye
shall be delivered. sir quod the squire / as god will so be it. And a haraude
was sent to the castle / to show all the matter to them within.

The next day they rode to ye^uyll in Beause always being in hope to fight
with their enemies / for well they knew / how they were pursued and costed on
all parties by the frenchmen who were as great a nombre as they were / or
greatter. And to say the truth / the french lords / knights and squiers /
had great will and desire to fight with the englysshmen / and said among them
self. How it was a great shame to suffer them so long unfought withal. And
when they spoke to the king thereof / he said ever to them. Sirs / let the^
alone to keep on their way / they shall at length lose them self. So thus
the englysshmen kept forth their way / to thentent to enter in to Bretayne.
And as ye have hard / in yenuyll in Beause / there were mo than three hundred
speres / and all the host passed by before the barryers / there was a little
scrimysshe and so passed forth / for they lost their pain / and without
yenuylle there was a fair wyndmyll / the which was beaten down. So the earl
of Buckyngham came to yt^ruyll / and alighted at the house of the te^plers /
and the vouarde went to Puyset. And they were aduertysed / how that there was
a strong tower and a xl. companyons within. Thenglysshmen went and assailed it
* it stood on the plain ground with little defense. So there was a great
assaut / but it endured not long / for the english archers shot so holly
toguyder / that there was none durst apere at any defense: So the tower was
taken / and all they within slain or taken. And than thenglysshmen set fire
in the tower and so passed forth / for they could find no good waters /
which was a great myschefe for them. Than they came to Ermoyne and loged there
and fro thens went and lodged in the forest of Marcheaunoy.

Of the iustes between Gawen Mychaell fraunsois / and Joahym Cathore angloys:
and of the words that king Charles of France said on his death bed. Cap.
CCC.lxvi.
WIthin the forest of Mar cheaunoye was an abbey of monks Sesteause / wherein
were noble houses and buyldynges of old time. it was edified and bylded / by a
valya^t and noble man therle of Bloys and he gave thereunto reuene was and
rentes / but the wars had sore mynisshed their lyuelode. There the earl of
Buckynghame lodged and herd mass on our lady day in Septembre. And there it
was ordained / that Gawen Mychaell should furnysshe his challenge / against
Joachym Cathore the next day. the same day thenglysshmen came toward Marcheau
noy / and within the town there was captain the same time / a knight of that
country / called sir Wyllyam of saint Martyne / a right sage knight and a
valyant in arms. When the englysshmen saw the manner of that castle / they
withdrewe to their lodgings. The lord Fitz water came before the castle of
Uerby / not to give any assaute unto it / but to speak with the lord thereof at
y^ barryers / because they knew each other. They had been toguyder before that
time in Pruce. So the lord Fitz water knowledged him self to the lord of
Uerby / and desired him for old acquayntance / to send him some of his wine
of his courtesy / and promised to save all his lands fro brennyng and
wasting. The lord of Uerby sent him wine largely / and thretie myches
therewith / for the which the lord Fytz water gave him great thanks / and
kept well his promise. The next day after our lady day / Gawen Mychaell and
Jochyme Cathore armed them and mounted on their horses / to perform their
enterprise. So they met at the spear points rudely / the french squire iusted
right plesantly / the englysshman ran to low / for he struck the frenchman
deep in to the thygh. Wherewith the earl of Bucking ham was ryghtsore displeased
/ and so were all the other lords: and said / how it was shamefully ron. Than
each of them struck three strokes with their swerdes / than therle said how
they had done enough (and said) how they should (...) no mo^^: tor he saw the
squyet blede sore.

^han Gawen Mychaell was unarmed / and the earl sent him by an haraude a
hundred fra^kes and gave him leave to depte home again to his own company.
Sendyng them word / how he had acquyted him right valiantly. so this Gawen
Mychaell returned again to ye french lords / and the englysshemen departed
fro Marcheaunoy / and took the way toward Uandoue / but or they came there /
they lodged in the forest of Coulonbers.

YE have herd before: how the french king had sent diverse treaties and
couenauntes / to certain towns in Bretayne: to the intent that they should
not open their towns to the englysshmen. Showing the^ that if they did
otherwise / they should soore trespass against him / so y^ it should be
inperdonable. they of Naunces had sent to the king secretly / that he should
be in no doubt of them. Promysinge / they would make no treaty / that should
be against the king their lord / so that if the englysshmen did aproche
their town / than the king to send them some socoure / to the which the
french king was well agreed / and had charged his counsel to take heed
thereto. Of all these treaties / sir Johan de Bulle had the business thereof
under the duke of Aniou who lay at Angers. The duke of Burgoyne was in the
city of Man's and therabout / and in the castelles and forteresses there about
/ there were these lords. The duke of Burbone / the earl of Bare / the lord
Coucy / the earl Ducke / and the duke a^ Lorayne / and so much people / that
they were above the nombre of six thousand men of arms / who said among
them self. How they would whyder the king would or not / fight with the
englysshemen / or they were past the tyuer of Sartie / the which departs
Main and An^owe. The same season a sickness took the french king whereby
him self and all such as loved him / were greatly discomforted: for they
saw in him no remedy but that shortly he should dye. He knew it well him
self how he could not live long / for so said all his phisycions and
surgyons / I shall show you why.

IT was of truth as the common brunte ran / that the king of Nauetr / when
the french king was but duke of Normandy and lay there / he would have
poisoned him. so that the king received the poison / and was in the case / that
all the hear of his body went of / and all the nails of his hands and fete /
and than all his body became as dry as a staff: so that he was without
remedy. The emperor of Rome his uncle / when he herd speaking of his malady
/ he sent him a conyng phisycion the greattest master reputed in that art /
that was as than in all the world. When this master was come in to France to
the king / who as than was but duke of Normandy / and had ones knowledge of his
disease: he said he knew well that he was poisoned / and was in great parell
of death. And so he did there / one of the greattest cures that has been
herd of / for he killed the venym within him / or the best part thereof. and
made his here and nails to grow again / and made him hole / and brought him
again to his strength. This venym ever issued out of him little and little at
his arm by a little pype. and when this master departed out of France / he
gave the king a receyte to use as long as he lived / and he said to the king
and to the^ that were about him. Look when this issue by this pype dries up /
than surely ye shall dye. But ye shall have a fyftene days respyte after ye
fall sick or ever ye dye / to remember your soul. So the king remembered well
his words / and bare this pype.xxii. days / which thing often times
abashed him. And such phisycions as he had most trust in / they of ten times
reioysed him / and said. Sir / by the good medycins that ye have we shall make
you to live long in great joy / wherein he had great trust. Beside this / the
king had other diseases right grievous / and specially in his tethe / whereof he
had marvelous pain. And the king knew well by these maladyes / yt he
should not live long. At his later days / the thing that most conforted him
was / that god had sent him three fair children / two sons and our
daughter. Charles / Jews / and Katheryne.

When this issue in his arm began to dry up / the doutes of his death began
to aproche. Than he prouyed therefore / for like a noble / prudent / and sage
prince / as he was ever in all his warkes. He sent for his three brethren / the
duke of Berrey / the duke of Burgone / and the duke of Burbone. and he let his
second brother the duke of Aniowe alone / and sent not for him / because he
knew well he was so sore given to couy^ousnesse. Than the king said to the
other three. My fair brethren / by the ordinance of nature I feel well and
know how I shall not live long. Wherefore I recommaunde in to your keeping my
son Charles / and look that ye use your self to him / as good uncles should
do to their nephewe / and than ye acquyte your self to him trewely / and
crown him king as soon as ye can after my death. Counsel him always well
and trewely / for in you lies all my trust. The child is young and light of
spirit / therefore it is great need / that he be well counsayled and governed.
And teache him or cause him to be taught / all the points and states ryall /
the which he ought to keep and mary him in so high a place that the realm may
fare the better thereby. Long a gone / I herd a master of astronomy say and
affirm that in his youth he should have much a do / and should escape fro
many dangerous parelles. Wherefore I have had diverse ymagmacyons how it might
be / without it grow by reason of Flanders / for thanked be god / as for the
business of this our realm of France / standethe in right good point. The
duke of Bretayne is a crafty and a subtell man / and has had always his
heart rather english than french. Wherefore it will be requysite / that ye
keep the noble men and good towns of Bretayne in love and amyte / whereby
yeshall break part of his intent. I praise greatly the bretons for always
they have served me and helpte to keep my realm fro mine enemies. And I will
ye make the lord Clysson constable / for all things consydred / I se no man
so mete as he for that office. Seek for some marriage for my son Charles in
Almaygne / to the intent that our alyaunce might be the stronger. ye well
understand / how our adversary the king of England will mary there / to have
the more alyaunce. The poor people of our realm / ar sore oppressed and
tourmented by him and his. Therefore put them away as shortly as ye can / for
they are things though I have sustained the^ / that greueth me right sore /
and lies heavy in my courage. But the great alyance that we have in ye good
towns of Bretayne / has caused me to forbere fighting with them / so long
as we have done.

THe king spoke diverse other words / the which I can not resyte. At this
rehersall was the duke of Aniowe absent. The king douted him / because he was
so couytous but though the king did absent him at the hour of his death /
and put him far of fro the busynesses of the realm of France. yet the
duke of Aniowe thought to medyll never the less for all his absence / for he
had always messangers coming and going between Paris and Angers / who ever
reported to him the certayntie of the king his brother. And also the duke had
some secret persons always about the king / by whom he knew every thing.
for the same day that the king dyed he was in Paris / and nere to the kings
chamber / and so thought to prepare for himself (as ye shall her after) But
now we will pursue on our matter as touching the englysshmen going in to
Bretaygne.

Of the lord of Mauuoyson who was taken prisoner by the englisshemen / and of
the lord of Ha^gest who skaped / and of the death of king Charles of France
the fifte of that name. Cap CCC.lxvii.
When the earl of Buckyngham youngest son to king Edward the third departed
fro the forest of Marcheaunoy they rode toward Uandon / and to the forest of
Colombiers. There rode to gyder sir Thomas Trivet / and sir willyam Clynton /
and with them a.xl. speres / and by adventure they encountered on the way the
lord of Hangest coming fro Uandone / with a xxx. spears. The englisshmen
knew incontinent that they were frenchmen / and so ran feirsly at them. The
frenchmen saw they were over matched / and thought not therefore to abide the^
also they were not far of fro Uandone. So they rode thyderwarde as fast as
they might / and the englysshmen after / and there was over thrown with a
spear / sir Robert of Hangest / cosyn to the lord of Ha^gest / and John^ of
Mo^decryes and six other were taken^e prisoners. The lord of Hangest came so
to the barryers / that they were opyn as his hap was / and so entered in
thereat. And than took his spear / and turned him to defense right valiantly /
but the englysshmen had a twelfe prisoners. (...) The same day^ ^^de forth
sir Robert Ca^^^ll and his company / who encountered ye lord of Mauuoyson /
defendyng him self right valiantlye / How be it finally sir Robert Canoll
took him his own hands. the same day the host passed by Uandone and went
to Ausey / and the next day to saint Cales and there rested two days / and than
went to Pount Uolayne. Thus the englysshmen rode forth and found no man that
spoke against them / so all the country was full of men of war. There were a
great nombre in the city of Mauns / and the duke of A^^ou rode by Towers in
Tourayne / by Bloyes and by Orlyaunce / and so came to Paris. For he had
knowledge how his brother the king lay in great ieopardy / and not likely ^o
escape / wherefore he thought to be at his dyeng. His men of arms kept still
their garysons and pursued theng^ysshmen. The men of arms of France ordained
to trouble the englysshmen as much as they might. Thinking to enclose them in
the country / and so to ^amysshe them if they could / and than to fight with
them at their advantage / whyder the french king would or not. And they made
on the passage of the river of Sartre / where as they thought the englysshmen
should pass / great defense. and brought thither great pyles of wode and dra^e
them down by force in to the river / whereby no man could pass there. And also
at the yssuinge out of the river / they made great and deep dykes / so that no
man could pass out. The earl of Buckyngham and his company departed fro Pount
Uolayne / and came to the river of Sartre and there rested / for they could
find no passage / for the river was great and deep and yuell to pass / but at
certain places. The vowarde rode a long the river and could find no passage
/ but there as the pyles were driven in the water. Than the lords a lyghted
and aduysed well the passage / and said. We must ned^s pass this same way /
if we will go any farther. Therefore let us go to it * and by force draw out
these pyles. Thanne ye should have seen lords knights / and squyers enter in
to the river at adventure / and took great pain ^r they could get out these
pyles. How be it finally they drew them out / and so opyned the passage with
great pain.

Now ye may co^^ydre / that if the french men had as than pursewed them / and
known o^ their deed they might have (...) the great (...)age. For the formast
could not have been aided with them that came after / because of the great
marysses that they had past / but so much did the english men that they
passed over / and so came to Noyen on the river of Sartre. The same day that
the englisshmen passed the river of Sartre / Charles the french king dyed in
his house of saint Poule in Paris. And as soon as the duke of A^io we his
brother knew that his eyes were closed / he took and seized all the kings
jewels the which were without nombre * and did put them in to save keeping to
his behoue. Thynkyng how they came right well to pass / to aid him in his
wars that he thought to make / for he wrote him self king of Cycell / of
Pulle / of Calabre / and of H^erusalem.

THe french king was carried through the city of Paris with open visage
discovered / his brethren and his two sons behind him to the abbey of saint
Denyse. and there he was buried right honorably / in like manner as he had
ordained in his life time / and sir Bertram of Clesquy his constable lay at
his fete. And though that king Charles in his life time had well ordained for
the gouernyng of the realm / how it should have been ordained. yet the duke of
Aniou followed nothing that ordinance. For he took on him incontinent the
gouernynge and reigned above all his brethren. How be it he would that
Charles his nephewe should be king / but he would have the gouernyng of the
realm above all other / because he was the eldest. And there was none in
France that durst say against him. Thus the king dyed about Myghelmas. Anon
after his discease / the lords of France aduysed that sone after Halowen tide
they would crown the young king Charles at Reins / to the which coronacy on
the three uncles to the king were well agreed. That is to say / the duke of
Aniowe / the duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burgoyne / so that they might
have the gouernynge of the realm / till the king came to the age of one and
twenty years. To this swear all the nobles and prelates of France. Than
knowledge of the coronacyon of this young king was given in to outward parts
/ as to the duke of Brabant / to duke Aubert of Bauyer * and to the earl of
Sauoy: to the earl of Bloyes to the duke of Guerles / to the duke of Julyers /
to the earl of Armynake / and to the earl of Foim* (The duke of Barle / the
duke of Lorayne / the lord of Coucy / and the earl Dolphyne of Auuergne) were
still in the pursuit of the englysh me^ / wherefore they were not sent for to be
at this coronacyon. The earl of Flaunders was desired to come thither / the day
was assigned on Alhalowen day / the which was on a sunday / as it fell that
year. Of the death of the french king were they of Gaunt right sorry / for he
did the^ much good in their war / for he loved but little the earl of
Flaunders. Now let us speak of the englysshmen / and leave the coronacyon of
the french king.

How the englisshmen arrived in Bretayne / and how the duke excused him self
of his long taryenge fro them. Cap. CCC.lxviii.
ALl this season the englysshmen knew no^hynge of the parell that the french
king was in / and were passed the river of Loyre / and were lodged at Nogen.
and than departed and went to Porle a two leages fro Sable / and all the power
of France / was as than in the cite of Ma^s and therabout / but they did
nothing but always coosted the englysshmen. Some said they would fight with
them / but when the tidings came among them / how the french king was
deed. Than their purpose was broken / for diverse of the lords returned in to
France to harken for tidings. And so the english men lay still a three or
four days / than they departed and went to saint Peter's of Auren / and fro
thens to Argens. and the next day the host passed the river of Mayenne /
thorough a marys with great pain / for they could not pass but two or three a
front the space of two leages* If the frenchmen had known thereof / and had
assailed the vowarde / the re^ewarde could na^ have given them any mane^ of
help. The englysshmen doubted much that passage / how beit they passed it
and came to Cosse / and were there four days * always in hope to here some
news out of Bretaine. The duke of Bretayne was in Hanybout / in the marchesse
of Uannes and herd often times word of the englysshemen / how they aproched
nere to Bretaygne. And he wist not well as than / how to be demeaned / for when
the death of the french king was showed to him / he let it soon ouerpasse /
for he loved him but a little / and said to them that were about him. The
rancoure and hate that I had to the realm of France / because of king
Charles now deed / is minisshed more than the one half. Such have hated the
father / that have loved right well the son / and some have made war to the
father / that after has ayeded the son. How be it I must acquyte me trewely
against the englysshmen / for they been come hyder at my request / and have
passed thoroughe the realm of France. Therefore I must keep that I have
promised to them. There is one hard point for me and for them / for I
understand that the good towns of Bretaygne are closed fast / and will not
suffer them to enter And thereupon the duke called his counsel to him / as the
lord of Mounboursyer / sir Stephyn Guyon / sir Wylliam Tanneguy / sir Eustace
Houssey / sir Geffray Caiemelle / and the Les^ewe of Lion / and said to them.
Sirs / ye shall ride and mete the earl of Buckynghame / who aprocheth nere to
this our country of Bretaygne. I think ye shall mete them not far hens /
wherefore go and reco^maunde me to him and salute all the other lords / and say
unto the fro me / that shortly I will be at Reyns to mete them there. Therefore
let them take that way / and there we shall all together take advise / how we
shall continue forth. And show them how I find not my country in the same
point that it was in / when I sent for them in to England * wherewith I am right
sore displeased / and specially with them of Nauntes / who rebel more than any
other. So these knights departed with their message and rode toward Nau^tes
and in their company a forty spears. The englysshmen departed fro Cosse / and
entered into the forest of Gravel / and passed through and came to Uyter in
Bretayne * for there they were better assured than they were before / for thanne
they knew well they should no more be pursued by the frenchemen / and fro thens
they went to Chateau Briant and there rested / because of coming of the dukes
knights thither to them.

UHe earl of Buckyngham and the other lords of England / received the said
knights messangers / to the duke of Bretayne right honorably / and there they
had toguyder great counsayls / and the englysshmen said to them / how they
had great marueyle / that the duke of Bretayne nor the country were not
otherwise aparelled. Than it apered to receive them / seeing they were come
thither at their request / and taken such pain / as to pass thorought the
realm of France. Than the lord Mounboursyer spoke for all the resydue / in
excusing of the duke / and said. My lords / ye have good cause and reason to
say as ye do. And as for the duke / he is in great will to keep and to
acomplysshe the ordynaunces and couenantes that he made with you / and you with
him / according to his power / but he can do acordynge to his will. And
specially he can not rule them of Nau^tes / which is the kay of Bretaygne /
who are as now rebels / and have determined to receive into their town
men of war of the french party. Whereof my lord the duke is greatly
marueyled / for they were the first that alyed them self with the other good
towns of Bretaygne / to have taken his part and yours. Also my lord thinks
/ they have made a new treaty and aliance with the new young french king /
who shall be crowned at Halowmas next coming. Wherefore sirs. My lord desires
you to hold him excused. And moreover / that ye will take the way toward
Reins / and thither he will come to you / having great desire to se you / and
of this he will natte fail. These words greatly contented the earl of
Buckyngham and the englysshmen / and said. how the duke could say no better.
Than the dukes messangers returned again to Hanibout / and so to Uannes to
the duke. And the englysshemen tarried at the castle Briaunt four days / and
than departed and came to the subbarbes of Reyns but the gates of the cite were
closed / and would suffer no man of arms to enter in to the city. But the
earl of Buckingham the lord Latymer / sir Robert Canolle / and a six other
were lodged within the city / and the dukes counsel. and there they tarried a
fyftene days abydinge for the duke of Bretayne who came not / whereof they
had great marueyle. Within the city of Reyns was the lord Mon teraulewe the
lord of Mountforde in Bretaygne / sir Geffray of Quarmell / sir Alaye de la
Houssey captain of Reins / and sir Eustace his brother: and daily they
excused the duke of Bretayne. I can not say whyder they had good cause so
to do or not but the englysshmen began not to be well content / because the
duke came not. They of Nauntes kept their city close / for they were not well
assured of the englysshmen that were lodged at Reins / wherefore they sent to
the duke of Aniowe / who had made all the treaties with them. showing him how
they were not strong of themself to keep and defend their city / if they
should have any assaut / without he would send them some men of arms:
desyringe him so to do. To their request agreed the four dukes that had the
realm in governance / Aniowe / Berrey / Burgoyne / and Burbone. And so they
sent thither mo than six hundred spears of good men of arms / men of estate
and of great valor. Thus they of Nauntes were well comforted / and these men of
arms intended to repair the town in all points / and to bring it into that
case / able to resyst any assaut given thereto.

THe englisshmen being at Reins and therabout / began to murmur and to grudge
against the duke / because he came not. And tha^ they determined to send unto
him / and sir Thomas Percy and sir Thomas Tryuet was ordained to go to the duke
/ and with the^ a five hundred spears to conducte and dyscouer them / and as
many archers. And so they departed on a thursdaye / and the host on the
saturday after. And than the earl of Buckyngeham went and lodged at saint
Sulplyces in Bretaygne / and there tarried a three days. and than he went to
Ca^bore / and there tarried four days. And the duke of Bretayne was as than
departed fro Hanybout and was come to Uannes / and every day he knew the
demeanyng of thenglysshmen by his own men / such as were with them. Than he
determined all things consydred to speak with them / for acordynge to his
honor / and to such alyaunces as he had made with them / he could no lengar
drive them of. And understood how sir Robert Canoll / sir Thomas Percy / and
sir Thom^s Tryuet were coming toward him. Than he took the way to go to Reyns
/ and the same day that he departed fro Uannes / he met with these englisshe
knights. Than they made great reioysynge each of other in the field / and the
duke demanded tidings of therle of Buckyngham. The knihgtes answered and
said. how they left him at Reins right marvelously displeased because he
herd no word fro him. The duke excused him self / and said: how by his
faith he was no less troubled than he was. than they rode all toguyder / and
were welcome to Uannes / and than they had knowledge how the english host
was dyslodged fro Cambre / and were coming toward Hayde and to Mauseyre they
held that way. The next day therle of Buckyngham and the duke met / there
was showed great love between them. And there the duke right honestly excused
him self to therle and to the^glisshmen / in that he had tarried so long but he
said the cause was / because he found not his country so well disposed / as
he had trusted they had been / wherefore he could not keep his promise that he
had made to the englysshemen / in the beginning of somer. Than answered the
earl and said. Fair brother of Bretayne for all that / and ye will we will
not abide / but that we shall correct your rebels / for what with the aid and
puyssance that ye have / and ours toguyder: and that day lie may come to us
out of England. We shall bring under yor subgettes in such wise / that they
shall be happy / when they may come to axe your mercy, with such words and
other / they were long toguyder talking: and than each of them drew to their
lodging / and the next day they rode toguyder. And it was determined / that
the earls counsel should go to Reins with the duke / and there to conclude
all their matters. The same night the duke of Bretayne and the earls counsel
abode at the Mauseyr / and the earl returned to Hayde. and so the next day the
duke went to Reins / and the lord Latymer / sir Robert Canoll / sir Thomas
Percy / sir Thomas Try uet / and the earls counsel in his company. so they
were three days cou^sayling their matters.

How the duke of Bretayne and the englysshmen beseged Nauntes / and of the
coronacyon of king Charles the sixth of that name / and of the scrimysshe done
before Nauntes. Cap CCC.lxix.
AT the last counsel it was acorded and sworn on the holy euangelystes /
that the duke of Bretayne should come and lay siege to Nau^tes / in the earl of
Buckynghams company / within fyftene days / after the coming of the
englysshemen thither. And yt the duke of Bretayne should bring and cause to be
brought by the river of Loyre / plenty of barges and barks / the sorer thereby
to constrayne them of Nau^tes. And the duke nor his men not to depart fro the
siege / till the town were won. All the things to conclude and to determyne
/ therle of Buckyngham was sent for to Hayde / to be present at the confyrmynge
of that treaty. So he came and lodged in the subbarbes of Reins (as he had
done before) So the earl and the lords entered in to Reins / and they dyned
all with the duke And there the Duke solempnely swear by his faith and by the
holy euangelystes / y^ he would come with all his power before Nauntes / and
thereupon departed and went to Hanibout. and the englysshemen abode at Reins /
and there they were a fyftene days orderyng their business. Of all these
matters they of Nauntes were well enfourmed / and how they should be beseged.
Wherefore they ordained them self ready to receyne them. One of the greattest
capytens within Nauntes / was sir Johan of Baroyes of Bars / a right valyant
and an expert knight / and with him there was the captain Clesson Johan of
Castle Moraunte / Morfonace / sir Johan of Maletrayt / the lord of Tournemyn
and diverse other / the flower of men of arms. They provided wisely for such
things as they wanted / as well for the river as for the gates and towers / on
such part as they thought the siege should be on.

Now let us leave spekyng of this matter and return to the coronacyon of
the young king Charles of France / who was the same time crowned at Reins.

yE must know / that nothing was spared touching nobleness / at the
coronacyon of the young king Charles of France / who was crowned king on a
sunday the.xii. year of his age: the year of our lord / a thousand three
hundred and fourscore. At the solempnyte of his coronacyon / were great no^bre
of great lords. His four uncles were there (...) we / Berrey / Burgoyne / and
Burbone. And also his great uncles / Uyncelyn duke of Brabant / the duke of
Bare / and ye duke of Lorayne / the earl of Sauoy the earl de la march / the
earl of Ewe / sir Wyllyam de Namure / but the earl of Flaunders / and the earl
Johan of Bloyes ercused them self. there were many other great lords / whom
I can not name. Thus the young king entered in to Reins / the saturday at
euensongtyme / right well acompanyed with nobles and mynstrelles. and special
lie he had mo than.xxx. trumpettes before him and the king alighted before the
church of our lady of Reyns / his uncles and brethren in his company. There
were also his cosyns / young gentylmen of Nauer / of Labreth of Bare and of
Harcourt. and a great nombre of young squyers / children two great lords of the
realm of France. Whom the young king / the day of his coronacyon made them
all knights. The saturday the king herd euensong in the church of our lady
/ and as the usage was: there he was the most part of the night / and all the
new knights with him. And than the sunday Ashalowen day / the church was
richely apparelled / and there at the high mass solempnely he was sacred and
anointed / by tharchbysshop of Reins / with the holy ampell / wherwt saint
Remy consacred Clouis / the first christen king that ever was in France. This
ointment was sent down by almighty god from heuyn by an holy angel. and
euersythe the kings of France has be consacred therewith / and yet it
apereth as it were nothing touched / the which is a right worthy and a noble
thing. before that: the king made all his young new knights and than they
went to the office of ye mass right solempnely / and the archbysshop of Reins
sange the mass. and there the young king was in habyte ryall in a chair lypt
up on high apparelled with clothe of gold / and all ye young new knights on
lower scaffoldes at his fete / covered with clothe of gold. There was the new
constable of France / sir Olyuer of Clysson / who was but late before chosen
to that office / who did right well his office / as it aparteyned.

THe great lords of France were there richely aparelled. The king sat in his
magestie ^oyall / with a right precious and rich crown on his heed. The
church that day was so full of nobleness / that a man might not a removed his
fete. And so at this new beginning of this young king / to rejoice thereby the
people of France: All manner of imposycions / aids / gabelles: fowages /
subsydies / and other things yuell taken / whereby the realm was hurt and
enpouerisshed / were utterly laid down and set a part: the which greatly
pleased the people. After mass they went to the palais / and because the hall
was to little to receive such a nombre of people. There was made in ye court
of the palais / a high and a great stage covered / where as the dinner was
ordained. and there satte the young king and his five uncles / Brabant* Aniowe
/ Berrey / Burgoyne / and Burbone / at the same table a far of fro the king.
and the archbishop of Reyns and other prelates sat on his right hand / and
great lords served the^ all. The lord Coucy / the lord Clisson / ser Guy de
la Tremoyll admyrall of ye see / and diverse other / on great coursers trapped
to the earth in clothe of gold. Thus in all honor that day continued / and
the next day / many of the great lords took leave of the king and his uncles /
and so returned in to their own countrees. The same day the king went and
dyned / at the abbey of saint Therrey two leages fro Reins / for they of the
abbey should give him that dinner / and they of Reins the day when he is
sacred. Thus ended the feast of the coronacyon of king Charles of France.

tHan the king went to Paris / where as he was greatly feested at his enter.
And after all this feast and solempnyte / there was a great counsel on the
gouernynge of the realm. and there it was ordained that the duke of Berrey
should have the gouernyng of Languedocke / the duke of Burgoyne of all Picardy
and Normandy / and the duke of Aniou to abide about the king / and to have the
princypall gouernynge and mynistracyon of the realm. Than the earl of saint
Poule was repealed again / who had been out of the favor and grace of the
king Charles last disceased. And the duke of Aniowe and the duke of Brabant
made his peace at Reyns in whose favor greatly was the earl of saint Poule /
and so he departed fro Hanne on the river of Hewre in the bysshopriche of Leage
/ where as he had layne a long space. Than he returned in to France and
his wife with him / and so brought her unto the castle of Bouhaygne. And so
put out all those that ocupyed his lands and took them again to his own
profit. Now let us a little leave speaking of these said matters / and
return to the insydentes of Bretayne / and to the earl of Buckyngham.

ye know how the couenau^tes and treaties were made / between the duke of
Bretayne and the earl of Buckyngham / as to besege Nau^tes When the duke of
Bretayne was departed fro Reins / the lord of Mounbrousyer / sir Stephyn
Guyon / the lord Houssey in his company / rode to Uannes and toward
Hanyboute. And the earl of Buckyngham and his company ordained to go to the
sege at Nauntes / and so departed fro Reins and there about where as they were
lodged / and went the same day and lodged at Castle Briant / and the next day
at Bayne / and the third day at Tyeull / and the fourth lodgyng / they took
in the foubours of Nauntes. And the earl was lodged at the gate of Saluetout /
and the lord Latymer constable of the host / the lord Fytzwater / and the
lord Basset / were loged at the gate saint Nicholas on the ryuersyde. and sir
Wyllm^ Wynsore and sir Hughe Caurell / were lodged among their folks right
honorably / as nere to the earl as they might. Within the town was a great
no^bre of knights and squyers / of Bretaygne / of Beause / of Aniou / and of
Main / who intended to defend the town. So they had all the charge thereof /
in so much that they of the town had no business therewith. And it was so y^
on saint Martyns night / sir Johan of Barroys of Bars / styred and moved some
of his company within the town / and said. Sirs / we se well our enemies are
nere us / and as yet we have not waked them. Therefore I counsel that this
night / we go and scrimysshe with the^. Certainly sir quod they / ye speak
nobly: show us what ye will have us to do / and we shall do it. So they
gadered toguyder the same euenyng to the nombre of sixscore of choice men. Than
they opyned the gate of saint Peter / where as the constable / The lord
Bassette and the lord Fytwater were lodged. So the frenchmen set good order at
the gate / because of their retrayt Capitayns of that company was / the Barrois
of Bars / Johan of the castle Morant / and the captain of Clysson: and so
they came on the host as they were at supper / and had to their cry the
bars. So they entered in to their lodginges / and beat down and hurt many
than anon the englysshemen were raynged before their lodgings. And when the
frenchmen saw that / they returned and kept them toguyder right sagely / and
so returned to their town. Than the englysshmen came thither and scrymysshed /
there was entryng and puttyng back and beatynge on both parties / and so the
frenchemen entered into their barryers. There were diverse slain and hurt on
both sides / but the Barroyes of bars entered again the town with little
damage. And so this scrimyshe was reputed to be well done on both parties.

ANd on saint Martyns day at night / the Barroyes of Bars spoke to his
company / and said. Sirs / I think it were well done yt tomorowe early / we
took a six or seuyn great barges / and two hundred men and two hundred
crosbowes / and let us go by the river and visyte our enemies. They take but
little head on that side. So they were all agreed / and the same night the got
their company toguyder / and so by day they were entered their besselles / and
so rowed down the river / and took land beside the lodgings. Sir Johan
Harleston was lodged thereby and had a great lodgyng / and at the brekyng of the
day the frenchemen were round about his lodging / and assailed it. Anon sir
Johan Harlston and his company were armed and ready at their defense right
valiantly / and archers shot against the crosbowes. There was a sore
scrimysshe and diverse hurt / and surely that lodgyng had been taken and
conquered / and sir Robert Canoll had not ben / who was lodged not far thens.
And so he and all his company with his baner dysplayed / came privily to that
part. And also sir Wyllyam Wyndsore had knowledge thereof / and so he and all
his company came thither / and still englysshmen drew to them fro all parts.
Than the frenchmen drew back to the river ward to come to their vessels /
so at their return in to their barges / there was a sore scrymysshe / and so
valiantly they departed. The capitayns did great feats of arms / how be it
there were some of the frenchmen taken / slain and drowned / and so they
returned in to Nauntes. In so much that all that herd of this enterprise /
reputed it of great valor.

Of the lettes that the duke of Bretayne had / in that he might not come to the
lege before Nasites / and of the scrimysshes made there. Ca. ccc.lxx.
When the englysshmen parceyued how they of Na^tes woke them so often. than
they took counsel to keep better watch. and so it fortuned on a night /
the.vii. night after that the barroys of bars had made his scrimysshe he
issued again in the night at the gate / where the earl of Buckyngham was
lodged / and with him a two hundred men of arms and a hundred crosbowes. The
same night the almayns kept the watch / and there capitayns were / sir Algars
and sir Thomas of Rodes. Than the Barroys dasshed in to the watch and himself
one of the first / there was a sore scrimysshe and sore beaten. Than they that
were lodged about the earl / rose and went to the scrimysshe. When the
frenchemen parceyued how the prease began to increase and multyply / they
withdrewe toward the gate and scrimysshed ever as they went. There were diverse
hurt with shot on both parties / and specially sir Thomas of Rodes / a
knight of Almayne / was shot through ye bassenet into the heed / of the
which stroke he dyed within three days after / which was great damage / for
he was a valyant knight. So the frenchmen and bretons entered again in to
Nauntes with little damage / and had taken six prisoners. So thus the matter
stood / and thenglysshmen ever made good watch / for every night they looked
for none other thing / but to be waked and raised fro their rest.

THus therle of Buckyngham lay before Nauntes / abiding daily for the duke of
Bretayne who came not / and to that he had promised and sworn nothing kept:
whereof the earl had marueyle what he meant / that he could here no tidings
fro him. The earl had sent to him diverse messangers and letters / she wyng him
/ how he did yuell his devour / in that he would not keep his promise that
he had made and sworn to acomplysshe in the city of Reins. But for all the
letters that therle sent / he had never none answer again. The englysshmen
supposed that the messangers were slain by the way because none returned
again / and truly they were in great parell / and all other men. without so
be they had been of the same country or well aco^panyed / for the ways between
Nauntes and Hanybout were so sore watched / that none could escape that way
without taking. So that it should be known from whens they came and whyder
they would / to ye intent that no letters nor word should go between the duke
and the earl / if any such were taken they were slain. Also the foragers of
the host durst not ride forth but in great companyes / for the knights and
squyers of the same country were assembled together / and would in no wife that
their lands should be haryed or ouerryden. So that sometime when they found
a.xx. or.xxx. of the englysshmen toguyder a foragynge / they would set on
them and take all that they had fro them / and sore beat and hurt them / without
having of any remedy. Wherewith they of the host were right sore displeased /
but they wist not of who^e to have ame^des. To say the truth / the duke of
Bretayne himself did asmoche as he could to bring ye men of his country to be
agreed to go and ley sege to Nauntes with him / acordyng to the promise that he
had made to therle of Buckyngham. But he could not bring it about / for it was
plainly said to him / how that another knight nor squire of the country would
go with him / to help to distroy their own country for the war of the
englisshmen / nor as long as the englysshmen should abide in Bretayne / they
would never arm the^ to take his part. Than the duke demanded of them / why
they did than consent to send for thenglysshmen. They answered / how it was
more for to give fear to the frenchmen / ye they should not lose their
ancient vsages: rather than for any other thing. And in case that the french
king will nothing with the^ but good / they will make him no war. Other
answer the duke could not have of them: on the other part the lord Clysson
constable of France / the lord of Dynant / the lord de Lauall / the vicont
of Rohan / the lord of Rochforde / and all the great lords of Bretayne / had
all toguyder closed fast their towns / and caused them to be well kept. And
said to the duke / and caused to be showed him by their messangers / how he
should be well aduysed what he did. Saying how he was but simply cou^sayled /
to send for the englysshmen to make war and to distroy his own country.
Promysinge him / how he should have no conforte of any of the^. And that if he
went to Nauntes to lay siege there / as he had promised to the englisshmen to
do / which he ought not to have done / they would distroy his lands in all
parties / and put him to such trouble / that he should not know well what to
do. But if so be he would knowledge and put him self under the obeysaunce of
the french king / as he ought to do. Than they said they would do their best
to make his peace with the young king. Saying also / how some have had their
courage against king Charles now deed / that will come and abide in the love of
his son. Of the most highest lords of all Bretaygne the duke was thus served
/ in so much that the duke wist not what to say / for he could find no sure
astate in his people / wherefore it behooved him to disse^ble. and always the
sege lay still before Nauntes.

ON our lady day in aduent at night / the frenchmen went to counsel /
determining to awake the host the same night / because they had so long lain
still. So there issued out of the town a two hundred spears / whereof sir
Almery of Clysson cosyn germayne to the lord Clysson / and the lord of
Amboyse were capitayns and governors. And so they entered in to the host where
as sir Wyllm^ Wynsore was lodged / they issued at the gate of Richbourge / and
the same night sir Hughe Caurell kept the watch. The same time the lord of
Amboyse was made knight / and sir Almery of Clysson made him knight. Than men
of arms frenchmen and bretons ca^e in with a fierce will / and at the first
coming they wan the bars of the watch / which was kept by sir Wyllyam of
Gysenton. There was a sore scrimysh and many a man overthrown / sir Willm^ wyn
sore and sir Hughe Caurell being in their tents heryng the noise armed them /
and ca^e thither as ye chief noise was / there both parties fought valiantly.
The frenchmen and bretons entered again in at the posterne Richebourge / where
they issued out without any great damage. And they had taken a knight prisoner /
and ten other me^ of arms / and of their men there were but three taken.

Of the scrimysshe that the barrois of Bars and Almery of Clyssone made on
Christmasse even / against the englysshmen being at Nauntes. Cap CCC.lxxi.
THe monday before the ^ygyll of Christmas / there issued out of Nauntes in the
euenyng at the gate of Sauetout^ sir Barrois of Bars and the lord of Solette
with sixscore men of arms. They came and dasshed in to the earl of Buckynghams
lodging / and the same night the earl of Domestre kept the wathe. There was a
great scrimysshe and many a man overthrown but the englysshmen were byggerr
thanne the frenchmen / wherefore they were driven back in to their baryers /
and in at the gate byforce. and there were slain and taken of them about.xvi.
and there was slain an english knight / called sir Hughe Tytiell / he was
stryken through his bassenet / whereof he dyed. Than every man drew to their
lodgings / and no more done yt night. Than all the frenchmen determined again
to make a scrimysshe on christmas night withal their power / and so kept their
en^prise secret. Therle of Buckyngham and the other englysshmen were awaked
often times by the bretons and frenchmen being wtin Nau^tes. and also the
foragers in the feldes had great pain / in serchyng for vitayle and forage for
their horses / and durst not ride out but in great companyes. Therle and his
company had great marueyle of the duke of Bretayne who ca^e not / nor herd no
manner of ridynges fro him / where with they were not content for they found
ever worse and worse / and feeble couynaunt kept by him / and wist not to whom
to complain / nor who should do them right. And so they determined that about
Christenmas to send again to the duke / sir Thomas Tryuet / sir Robert Canoll
/ and sir Thomas Percy to Uannes or to Hanybout / and they to show to the duke
fro the earl that he does yuell his deuoyre / that he has not acquyted him
self otherwise tha^ he has done against them. Howbeit this apoyntment was
broken / and they said among them. all things considered and ymagined / they
thought they might not ^eblysshe their host nor siege / nor yt they could not
go to the duke without they went all toguyder / for if they went a five or six
hundred speres together / and hap to mete a thousand / it should be for them
but an yuell match and for that dout they would not depart fro the host / but
kept them self toguyder.

ANd on Christmas even at night ye barrois of Bars / sir Almary of Clysson /
(...)orde Damb(...) / the lord Destolet / the cha(...) of Clysson John^ of
Castelmorant / and (...) the (...)ns within Nau^tes / issued at the (...)te
sayut ^e^t / in great desire to trouble their (...)* and had in their company
a.vi. hundred men of arms. and when they were without the gate in two parts
the one took the way by the street / and the other through the feldes / and let
on the lodging of the lord Latymer / and of the lord Fitzwater who kept the
watch the same night / and sir Wylliam Renton. And at their first coming they
wan the bayles of the watch / and drove them back with great force to the
constables lodging the lord Latymer. And there tarried before the lord of
Uertaynes lodgyng and there was a great skrymishe and a great assaute / for the
frenchmen had determined to have taken him / and so he was in agreat danger of
taking. So they of the watch had much a do or any socour came to the^. Sir
you Fitz waren the lord of Uertayne / and sir Nycholas Trayton / did there
many a great feat of arms. Than the constable and marshall enfor^ed themself
to come thider and sowned the trumpettes and so armed them. Sir Wylliam
(...)or^^ / and sir Hugh Caurell hard ye noise of the trompettes / and knew
that the voward had a sorry. Than they sowned trumpettes and made great baners
and lyghtes / and displayed their baners / and came thither with a hundred men
of arms and as many archers. Also sir Thomas Trivet / sir Thomas Percy / and
the lord Basset / every man under his own standerd came to the scrymisshe. y^
same time they of the vowarde had great need of aid / for they were lykely to
have lost their lodgings / but when these lords and knights were come /
than the frenchmen reculed back all to gyder right sagely and so drew a back
toward the town skrimysshyng. There was done many a noble deed of arms and
some of the french knights adventured them self to auaunce their renown /
and for their ladies sake / so that sir Tristram de la ^aylle was taken
prisoner / by his folyshe hasty enterprise / by a squire of Haynalte / called
Thierry of Sommayne.

UHus continued this scrymisshe / and so the most part of the frenchmen
entered in to Nauntes / how beit in such deeds of arms ever some be slain /
hurt or taken. yet they returned with no great damage / for they had as many
prisoners / as the englisshmen had of theirs / and so went to their
lodgings. And when the gate was cllosed / tha^ they caused these hurt men to
be dressed / in likewise they of the host drew to their lodgings. yet they
brake not their watch / but rather made stronger watch than they did before.
on Cristmas day nor all the feestes after there was nothing done / how beit
the englysshmen every night looked to be waked with scryes / yet ye thing that
most touched the^ / was that they could here no tydin ges of the duke of
Bretayne / and their vitayls and forages were so scant / that it was much
pain to get any. How be it they within the town hadd enough / for it came
to them by the tyuer of Loyre / out of the good countries of Poictou / Xaynton
/ and Rochell.

How the englysshmen departed fro the seige of Nauntes / and of the fair
excuses that the duke of Bretayne made to the earl of Buckynghame. Cap.
CCC.lxxii.
When the earl of Buekyngham and the english men had been long at siege
before Nauntes / about the space of two months and four days / they
parceyued well yt the duke of Bretayne kept not his promise / as in coming to
them, tha^ they determined to dislodge fro thens and go to Uannes / and there
to speak with ye duke / and to know all his intent. Than their dislodgynge was
known in the host / and so disoged the next day after Neweres day / and rode
forth in order of battle / in like manner as they did when they past through
France / and the first night after their departure they lodged at Niorch and
there tarried three days to refreshe them / and because the bridge was broken /
they had much trouble to make it again / to get over their cariages. yet
they made it / and the host passed the river of Uolayne / and on a saturday
they went and loged at Loheacke and there tarried two days / and so fro thens
to Grosy and there tarried two days / and the next day they passed the river of
Aust at the bridge of Brehaigne / and there tarried in the fair plain country.
The same day that they departed and passed y^ river / they of y^ city of
Uannes were informed by them of the country / how that the earl of
Buckynghame and the englisshmen were coming to lodge in their town: they wist
not what to do / whyder to suffer them to enter their town or not. and so they
went to Hanybout to the duke / but the same day that they came toward
Hanybout / they met the duke in the feldes within two leages of Uannes /
coming thither. and when y^ duke saw the men of Uannes coming to him ward / he
demanded of them / what tydinges / and whyder they went? sir quod they: as for
tydinges we can show you ynowe. sir / the earl of Buckynghame and the
englisshmen are coming yonder / and it is their entencyon / as we be enfourmed
/ to lodge in your good town of Uannes. sir / look what it please you to do /
for without your commandment we will do no thing. sir they have made again
the bridge at Brehaigne / the which was broken on y^ river of Aust. When the
duke hard of this he studied a little / and said: sirs / be not a frayde /
have no dought / every thing shall be well enough / they are such men as will
do you do hurt. I am some what bound to them by certain treaties / the
which I must needs uphold and acquyte me trewely therein / I will go to Ua^nes
/ and to morrow I think they will come thither / and I will go and mete with ye
earl my brother / and do to him as much honor as I can do / for I am
bound so to do / moreover ye shall do as I counsel you. ye shall offer and
present to him the keys of the town / and say unto him how that you and all
the town are ready to receive him / how beit desire him to be sworn / yt
within.xv. days that he be required to depart / that he will depart / and to
yield again to you ye keys of the town this is the counsel that I will give
you. the burgesses answered and said / sir: we shall do as ye have ordained.
and so they rode forth with the duke to Uannes / and there the duke lodged
that night / and y^ englisshmen the same night lodged at saint Johans / a
little village two leages fro Uannes. The same night the earl of Buckynghame
received letters fro the duke / who wrote to him as his kind brother /
welcomyng him into the marches of Uannes. the next morning when the earl had
hard mass / he took his horse and all his company and rode in good order
toward Uannes / the toward first / and the earl and his battle after / and
the rerewarde following the earls battle. Thus they met with the duke of
Bretayn / who was issued out of Uannes to mete with them the space of a great
leage / and when they met they made each to other great honor and
reverence. after this metynge which was right honorable / rydyng toguyder /
the earl on the right hand / and the duke on the left. Than the earl began to
say: saint Mary fair brother of Bretayne / what a long space has it been /
that we have tarried before Nau^tes at the siege there abiding for you /
according to the treaty and covenant made between you and me in that be half /
and yet ye came not. By my faith quod the duke I could do none otherwise /
wherewith I ensure you I was greatly displeased / howbeit I could not amend it
/ for my men of this country / for any thing that I could show unto them /
nor for any alyaunces at their requests that I had made to you. yet for all
that they would never go to the siege to you before Nau^tes / but kept them
self strong on the fronters. the lord Clisson / the lord Dynant the lord
Dornall / the vycount of Rohan / and the lord Rochforde / to keep thentreis
and issues of Bretayne / and all such as were joined with me as well knights
and prelates as burgesses of the good towns / ar as now all rebel against me
wherewith I am greatly displeased / sithe by their fault ye find me untrue.
Sir / I shall show you what ye shall do / it is now in the hard of winter /
and cold and an cuyll season to keep an host to gyder. ye shall come to
Uannes and there abide till it be Aprell or May and refreshe you / and I shall
ordain other places for your company / and so pass the time as well as ye may
/ and in somer weshall revenge us of all matters. the earl answered and said /
as god will so be it / for he saw well it would be none otherwise, so the duke
brought him in to Uannes / and at the entering in to the town the comen people
came in to the earls presence / and said: sir / because of the reverence of
your great signory and noble honor / we will not be against your entryng in
to this town / but sir: to apease all the people of this town / and for your
surety ye shall swear unto us on the holy euangelyst that within.xv. days
after ye be required / to depart out of this town: you and all yours / and
that ye do nor suffer to be done to us any manner of damage or hurt. By my faith
quod the earl of Buckynghame I am content to swear to you to keep and fulfill
all this / than all the other lords swear the same oath / for they were feign
so to do / or else to have lain in the feldes. Thus the earl of Buckynghame was
lodged in the eytie of Uannes him self lay in the dukes house / a pleasant
and a fair castle handyng within the town named the Motte. and all his
company were lodged in the town and in the subbarbes / and the duke of Bretayn
and his company went to Asnotte and there a bode / and sometime he came to
Ua^nes to se the earl and to comen with him. The lord Latymer / and the lord
Fytz water / sir Thom^s Percy / sir Thomas Trivet and y^ vowarde / were lodged
about the town of Hambout / but they never came within the gates / but lay in
the subbarbes and in the feldes. Sir Robert Canoll / and the lord Fitz waren
and diverse other should have lodged in the town / called Ouyn percorentyn. But
they would never open their gates / wherefore they were feign to lodge in the
subbarbes and in the feldes. So thus they endured and suffered that season
great dissease and poverty for that was not worth three pens / was sold to them
for.xii. pence. yea? and worse / for sometime they could get nothing for
money. so that their horses dyed for poverty and cold for they wist not
whyder to go a foragyng / and when they went they were in great parell / for
their neighbors were their enemies. The vicount of Rohan had that time in the
marches of Uannes two strong castelles / the one called Cayre and y^ other
Lynguisshant / and in these two castelles there was great garysons laid by the
vycount / the which did much trouble to the englissh foragers / with the
help of other garysons / pertaining to the lord of Clysson. as y^ castle of
Josselyn / Montagu / and Moncountour / all this suffered the duke of Bretayne
and said / how he could not amend it. The same time the constable of France
/ and the lord Clisson made war for the french king / and was in the
country with a great nombre of men of war / wherefore the englysshmen durst
not depart one fro another. All things considered how they were lodged in
the feldes without defense / it was great marueyle they had no more hurt than
they had / for they of Uannes could not lightly have reskewed them / that lay
about Campernell / or Hanybout or Numpercorentyne. but to say the truth the
duke went between them / and defended them to his power that they should not be
distroyed. And said to his counsel / how that he had but febly acquyted him
toward the earl of Buckyngham / seeing such promise as he had made unto him.

IN the same season there was at Paris with the king / four great lords sent
by the duke of Bretayn to purchase his peace. that is to say / y^ vicont of
Rohan / sir Charles lord of Dynnant / sir Guy lord de Lawall / and sir Guy
lord of Rocheforde. These four lords of Bretayne had entysed diverse times
the duke / sayng thus. Sir / ye show your self to all the world / how that
your courage is all englisshe. ye have brought in to this country the
englisshmen / who will take fro you your heritage / if they may get the
vperhande. What profit or pleasure have you in them / to love them as ye do?
behold how y^ king of Nauer / who trusted so much in them / that he suffered
them to enter in to y^ town and castle of Chierbourge / and never sith they
would depart out of it / but keeps it as their own heritage. In likewise if
ye put the^ in any of your closed towns / they will never depart again out of
them / for daily they will be refresshed with new men? behold how they keep
still Breast / and they be not in mind to deliver it again to you / the which
is your right heritage. sir / let it suffice you to be beloved with your own
men of this same country / who will never renounce the french king to serve
the king of England. sir / if your wife be of England: will you for y^ cause
leave your own heritage / the which has cost you so much pain to get / and
always abide in war. ye can do no more tha^ one man may do / if your
country close them self against you. sir leave your counsaylynge with them /
for the french king / who loved you not is deed. and there is now a young
king fair and good and of bold spirit / and such has hated his father that
now serve him. Sir / we shall make your peace with him / and set you at
acorde / and so ye shall abide lord and duke of Bretayne / and be of great
puyssance. and let the englisshmen return home in to their own country. These
words and such other the for said barons / showed to y^ duke diverse times /
so that they had nyghe conquered him to their wylles. how be it yet he feigned
and dissymuled with the french king and his counsel / and with the
english men also / till he might se to what end his war should come unto.
And of all these secret treatyes / that these four barons of Bretayne had
made at Paris with the king and his uncles / the earl of Buckyngham and the
barons of England knew nothing till the conclusyon was taken / but or they
perceived it / and or they departed out of Bretayn there was done in Nau^tes a
deed of arms before the earl of Buckynghame. Whereof I shall make mention / for
it is a matter not to be forgotone.

SO it was y^ same season / that Gawen Mychaell and Jaques Cathore / did their
deed of arms before therle of Buckyngham. there were diverse lords / knights
/ and squyers / that ca^e thither to se it. Some of France came thither fro March
caunoy and Bloys. In so much that sir Raynolde of Thowars / lord of Pousances
a barowne of Poyctowe. Spoke words to the lord of Uertaygne / and said. That
gladly he woldedo deeds of arms with him: as three courses with a spear / and
three strokes with an axe. And the lord of Uertaygne would not refuce his
request / but accorded thereto. And would incontinent have delivered him / what
soever profit or damage he should take thereby / but the earl of Buckyngeham
would not suffer it. And commanded the knight to do nothing / nor to speak no
more there of. How be it the words of the enterprise of arms abode still in
the purpose of the two knights. And like words there was spoken the same day
by a squire of Sauoy / called the bastard Clarens / to Edward Beauchampe /
son to sir Roger / but all passed: as well the one as the other. In likewise
between Galoys Daunoy / and sir Wyllm^ Clynton. and between sir Hoyan Dareyns /
and sir Wylliam Frank. Thus as the earl of Buckyngham was lodged in the
subbarbes of Nauntes / and the knights and squyers of France within Nauntes.
Than^e the lord of Uertayne and the other of his side / required the^ that had
apealed them in arms / that they would come and deliver them before Nauntes.
The capitayns in Nau^tes were not agreed so to do. but excused their men and
said How they were within Nauntes as soudiers / set and ordained to keep the
town. So these words passed over / till therle of Buckingham came to the
town of Hanybout: and to Campelle and Quynpercore^tyne. but when he was come
to Arestes. Than sir Raynolde of Thowars lord of Barroyes of Bars / sir
Hoyan Darreynes / and a great nombre of knights and squyers came to the
castle Josselyne / a seuyn miles fro Uannes / where as the constable of
France was. And also the earl of March / and a great nombre of other knights
of France. Than the words were showed to the constable / of the enterprise of
the deeds of arms / against the Englysshmen. The constable herd well their
words and said. Sirs / send to the^ word / how I shall give them
saueconducte / to come to do these deeds of arms. And first Galoyes Daunoy
and sir Lyonell Darreynes send word how they were ready to do their enterprise
of arms / as three courses a horseback with a spear. And when sir Wylliam
Clynton and sir Wylliam Fra^ke / understood how they were desired and sommoned
to do these deeds of arms by the frenchmen / they were right joyful. and took
leave of the earl of Buckyngham and of the lords of England to go thither. and
so thither they went / and a certain knights and squyers in their company.
and there iusted right valiauntly both parties / and did their deeds of arms
/ as it was ordained. Than sir Rainolde of Thouars and sir John^ of Castle
Morant / and the bastard of Clarens / desired the lord of Uertayne and sir
Johan Dambrety court and Edward Beauchampe / to deliver their challenge. And so
these three english knights / were of good will to go and fight with them /
at the castle of Josselyne / on the constables saueconduct.

Of the deeds of arms done before therle of Buckingham between the
Englysshemen and the frenchemen. and the answers made to the haraldes on their
saueconductes. Cap. CCC.lxxiii.
WHan^e the earl of Buekyngham was come to Ua^nes / and understood the
frenchemens request / he answered and said to the harauldes. Sirs / ye shall
say to the constable / that therle of Buckynghame sends him word / how he
is as puyssaunt and able to give his saueconduct to the frenchemen / as he is
to give his to the Englysshemen. Therefore such as desires to do deeds of
arms let them come to Uannes / and I shall give them save conducte to come and
return / and to bring in their company / such as shall please them. And
whan^e the constable herd this answer / he ymagined in him self / how that
therle of Buckyngham said truth And how it was but reason / that he should
se the deeds of arms done at Nauntes. As well as he had seen the deeds of
arms / at the castle Josselyne. Than the constable said. The earl of
Buckynghame speaks like a noble valyant knight / and son to a king. And I
will it be as he says. and for such as will go thither. I shall send to him
for his saueconducte for them. Than knights and squyers made them ready / to
the nombre of.xxx. and a haralde came to Uannes / for their saueconducte. The
which was given and sealed by therle of Buckyngham. Than there departed fro
the castle Josselyne / the three knights that should do the deeds of arms /
and their company. and so ca^e to Uannes / and lodged in the subbarbes. And the
English men made them good chere. The next day they appointed to fight / and
so they came in to a fair plain place without ye town. Than came thither
therle of Buckingham / the earl of Suffolk / and the earl of Deuonshyre / and
the other barownes of their company. And brought them forth / that should do
the deeds of arms. First the lord of Uertaygne against sir Raynolde of
Thowars / lord of Pousances. and sir Johan Dambrety court / against ser
Trystram de Lauall. and Edward Beauchampe / against the bastard of Clarens.
There the englysshmen took the one side / and the french men the other. And
they that should just were a foot / armed at all pieces with bassenettes and
vysures / and good speres with heedes of Bordeaux / ready to fight.

Here after follows their feats of arms.
FFirst the lord of Pousances in Poictou / and the lord of Uertaygne in
Heynaulte. Two barownes of great prise and hardynesse / came each against other
a foot / holdyng their spears in their hands / sparyng nothing each other.
The lord of Uertaynge was stryken but not hurt / and he struck the lord of
Pousances in such wise / that he pearsed ye mayle on his breast and all that
was thereon / so that the blood followed. And it was great marueyle / that he had
not been worse hurt than^e he was. And so they struck out their three strokes /
and finysshed their arms / without any more damage. And than went and rested
them / and beheld the other. Than came sir Johan Dambreticourt of Hey nalt /
against sir Trystram de Laualle of Poictowe / and they did their arms right
valyantly / without any damage / and so left. Than came Edward Beauchampe and
Clarens of Sauoy the bastard / who was a squire right hardy and strong / and
bygger in all his members / than^e the English man was. So they came each
against other / and met with great will. and struck each other on the breast /
in such wise / that Edward Beauchampe was overthrown backewarde. Whereof the
Englysshemen were sore displeased. And whan^e he was up again / he took his
Spear and came again against Clarens / and so met again. And there Edward
Beaucha^pe was again overthrown to the earth / wherewith the^glysshe men /
were more sorer displeased and said. how that Edward was to weak / to medyll
with the French squire / the devil was on him to just against him. So than
they were departed / and showed how they should do no more. And when Clarens
saw the manner / desyringe to perform his arms said. Lords / ye do me
wrong: And sithe ye will that Edward shall do no more / than set some other
to me in his stead / that I may perform mine entprise. The earl of Buckynghame
demanded what he said / and it was showed him. Than he said the french man
spoke valyauntly. Than stepped forth an English squire / who was after a
knight. and was called Jenequyn Fetaceilles. He came before the earl and kneled
down / and desired that he might perform the battle. And therle acorded
thereto. Than this Jenken Fetaceilles came forth / and armed him at all pieces
and took his spear / and the bastard Clarens his. and so met each at other
and foyned and thrust so sore each at other / that the spears flewe all to
pieces over their heedes. And at the second coupe they did in likewise / and
at the third also. So all their spears were broken / so that all the lords
on both parties / reputed this deed / a goodly feate of arms. Than they took
their swerdes / the which were right byg. and in six strokes they brake four
swerdes. And than^e they would have fought with axes / but the earl would not
suffer them. And said he would not se them fight at vttraunce. Saying / they
had done enough. Than they drew abacke and other came forth. As one Jeneken
Clynton english / against one Johan de Castle Morant french man / who made
them ready to do arms.

THis Jenken Clynton was a squier of honor with the earl of Buckynghame / and
right nere about him. How be it he was but sclender and small of body.
Therefore the earl was not content / that he should have to do in arms / with
so bygge aman / as Johan of the Castle Morant was. How be it they were put
toguyder to assay / and so they came right rudely toguyder. But the
englyssheman could not endure against the French man / but with their foyninge
/ the English man was overthrown to the earth. Than the earl said. how they
were nothing euenly matched. Thanne there came to Jenequyn Clynton / certain
of the earls company and said. Jenequyn / ye are not metely to acomplysshe out
this feate of arms. And the earl of Buckyngham is not content of your
enterprise / and commands you to go and rest you / and so he departed. And
Johan of the Castle Moraunt / seeing the manner / said. Sirs / if ye think
that your squire be to little to deal with me / send another to me at your
pleasure / to the intent I may perform mine enterprise / or else it should be
to my villainy. And also I should have wrong / if I should depart / without
doing of any deeds of arms. Than the Constable and the marshall of the host
said. ye say right well. and so it was done. Than it was said to all the
knights there about. Sirs / is there any of you that will deliver this knight
/ to the which answered sir Wylliam of Fermyton / and said. show unto the
knight / how he shall not deperthens / without doing of deeds of arms. If it
please him a little to rest him / he shall anon be delivered for I shall arm
me against him. This answer pleased much John^ of Castle Morant and so went
and satte down to rest him. Anon the English knight was ready / and came in
to the place.

SO the two knights ca^e a foot each against other rudely / with their spears
low couched / to stryke each other within the four quarters. Johan of Castle
Moraunt struck the english knight on the breast in such wise / that ser
Wylliam Fermyton stombled and bowed / for his foot a little failed him. He held
his spear low with both his hands / and could not amend it. And struck sir
Johan of the Castle Moraunt in the thighe / so that the spear went clean
through / that the heed was seen a handful, on the othersyde. And sir Johan
with the stroke reled / but he fell not. Than^e the English knights and
squyers were right sore displeased and said. How it was a foul stroke Sir
Wylliam Fermyntone excused him self / and said. how he was sorry of that
adventure / and how that if he had known that it should have been so / he
would never have begone it. saying / how he could not amend it / because of
glau^synge of his foot / by constraynt of ye great stroke / that sir John^ of
the castle Morant had given him. So thus the frenchmen departed and took leave
of the earl and of the other lord. and took with them in a lytter sir John^ of
Castle Moraunt / and brought him to the Castle Josselyne / and he was after
in great paryll of death / by reason of his hurt. Thus ended these deeds of
arms / and every man drew to their own part. The englisshmen to Uannes /
and the frenchmen to castle Josselyn.

How the duke of Bretaine made his peace with the french king / and how the
englysshmen returned in to their country. and of a deed of ardone / between a
french squire and an englisshe. Cap. CCC.lxxiiii.
AFter these deeds of arms done / while the earl of Buckyngham lay at Uannes /
there was nothing don that ought to be remembered and as it has been said here
before / the englisshmen lay at Uannes / at Hanyboute / at Camperle / and at
Quynpercorentyne. And so they passed the winter / as well as they might. Diverse
of the^ had great dommage / and were in right great dangers / and lacked
vitayle / for them self and for their horses / for they could find no forage
in the country. And in that time of ye year / the graunges and barnes were all
void / and the ^odder spente. The frenchemen them self had sore wasted and
distroyed it / because their enemies should have no ease thereby. In this
danger the Englysshemen were long / for the frenchemen were in their garrisons
on the fronters / wherefore the englysshmen durst not ride. Some vitayle came to
the englysshmen by the sea from Corn wall / from Gernesay / and fro the ysle
of Wight / the which somewhat conforted them * or else they and their horses
had dyed for famyne and hunger. And all this season / there was at Paris with
the king / fro the duke of Bretaygne / the Uycount of Rohane / the lord de
Laualle / sir Charles of Dynaunt / and sir Guy of Rocheforde. and they did
purchase the dukes peace / to the which he agreed. For he saw well he could
not keep his promise to the English men / without he would lose all his
country. The intent of the Earl of Buckyngham and his company / was to pass
over the winter in the marchesse of Uannes / as well as they might. And in the
beginning of Somer / to return in to France and make war. And they had
send word of their state and condycion to the king of England / and to the
duke of Lancastre. And the king of England and his counsel / thought the
earl of Buckynghams ente^cy on right good / and wrote to him that they would he
should so do. And send him word / how the same season they would send over
another army of men of war / to land at Chyerbourge / to thente^t that
both armies should mete toguyder. Whereby it was thought they should do a great
feate of war in France. The French king / his uncles and his counsel /
ymagined well all those points. And also / they were somewhat enfourmed thereof.
And it was say de also among them in secret counsel / that if the duke of
Bretaynge / and some of his towns / took part with the Englysshemen. the
realm of France / should than^e have much to do. And these four barownes of
Bretaygne representynge the duke / conceived well all this business / and
laid forth all these doutes / and specially / showed it to the duke of
Antowe. Who had the sovereign gouernynge of the realm of France / at that
time. And also the duke of Aniowe was entending to make a voyage within two
year / or shorter time / In to Poule and Calabre. And was loathe that his vyage
should have been broken or let. Therefore he enclyned lightely to the duke of
Bretaignes peace / so that he would become faithful and true / and do homage
to the french king. And so he was agreed and his peace made. And it was also
agreed / that he should help the englisshmen with ships / to return into
their countries. Also it was agreed / yt all they of ye garrison of Chierbourge
/ that had been in that viage to serve the earl of Buckyngham / that if they
would return by land to their garrison / they should have good saueconducte
of the king so to do. And to go through the realm of France without harness
/ and certain knights and squyers of England in their company / if they list
so to do. And after the departing of the Englysshemen out of Bretaynge. Than
the duke to come in to France / to the king and to his uncles / and to do
faith and homage to the King / as the duke of Bretayne ought to do / to his
natural lord the french king. All these matters were written and sealed /
and suffyciently brought to the duke of Bretaygne / who as than was in the
marchesse of Uannes. And he accorded / to that his men had done / with right
an yuell will / for he knew well he could not do it / without ye yuell will of
the englysshmen.

When the knowledge of this treaty ra^e to the earl of Buckyngham and to the
English men / how that the duke of Bretaygne was agreed with the french
king. they were therewith greatly displeased / and were yuell content with the
duke. Saying / how he had sent for them to come in to Bretaygne. And never
sithe they came / he^ did never acquyte him self trewely against them / as
he ought to have done. Wherefore they said / there was no point of truth in
him. Anon after the duke of Bretaygne came to Uannes / to the Earl of
Buckyngham / and there showed them secretly / how his men had made his
peace with the french king. To the which he was feign to agree / or else to
have lost his country. There were great words between them / but the duke
humyled him self / and excused him as much as he might / For he knew well in
a manner / that he was in the wrong. How be it / he was feign for to do it /
to the entente that the englysshmen should depart out of Bretayne. Than
therle made to be cried through the cite of Uannes / that if any of his men
did owe any thing in the town / that they should come forth and they shall
be paid. And than therle rendered again the kayes of the town / to the
burgesses thereof / and thanked them of the pleasure that they had done to him.
And than they delivered to the earl for his money: ships at Uannes / at
Hanybout / at Camperle / and where as they were lodged. And so the earl of
Buckyngham departed fro Uannes the.xi. day of Aprell / with all his baners
displayed in order of battle / and so came to the hauyn. And thither ca^e the
duke of Bretayne / sir Alayne Housey / the lord of Monbroiser / sir Stephyn
Gyon / sir Wyllyam of Tribiquidy / sir Geffray of Quaresmell / and diverse other
of the dukes counsel. And they sent to the earl in to his ship / desyringe
him to speak with the duke / but the earl would not come again to land / but
sent to them the lord Latymer / and sir Thomas Percy. These two came and
spoke with the duke of Bretaygne / and they comuned toguyder the space of three
hours. And the englysshmen promised at their departing / that they would do so
much / that the earl should speak with the^ another day: and so retourued
again to their ship. and than showed the earl all that they had done with
the duke. And anon after myd night the fludde came / and the maryners had
wind at will. Than they demanded of the earl what he would do? and the earl /
who would have no more speaking with the duke / said. Sirs / draw up your
ankers and aueyle your sails / and let us go / the which was inco^tynent
done. Thus departed the englisshmen fro the hauyn of Uannes / and sailed
toward England. And so did all other englysshmen fro other hauyns. so they
all came toguyder on the sea. Now let us speak of some knights and squiers
/ that returned to Chierbourg by land / and record what adventures fell to
the^ by the way.

THe constable of France / was as than in the castle of Josselyn / a seuyn
miles fro Ua^nes / and he had given safeco^duct to diverse knights english
and nauerosse: to go by land to the garysone of Chierbourge / the which
knights had served the earl of Buckynghame in his said voyage. And among
other there was sir you of Fitz waren / sir Wyllyam Clynton / and sir Johan
Burle. They departed fro Uannes / and took their way by the castle of Josselyn
/ and there lodged in the town without the Castle / thynkinge no more but to
dyne there / and so depart. And when they were alyghted at their lodgyng /
certain companyons of the castle / knights and squyers came to se them: as
men of war often times will do / and specially englysshmen and french men.
And among the frenchemen there was a squyers a good man of arms / parteyninge
to the lord of Burbone earl of March / and one that he loved entierly /
called Johan Boucmell: He had been before that time in the garyson of Boloyne
with sir Wylliam Bourdes / with the frenchmen / against the garyson of
Chierbourge / at which time there had been diverse words spoken of deeds of
arms to have been done between him and an english squire / called Nycholas
Clyfforde. The which Nycholas was as than there present. And when the french
men were come to the englysshmens lodgyng / and had comuned toguyder / and
beheld each other. Than Johan Boucmell began to speak and said to Nycholas
Clyfforde. Nycholas / diverse times we have wysshed and devised / to do deeds of
arms toguyder / and now we have found each other in place and time / where
we may accomplysshe it. Now we be here before the constable of France / and
other lords that be here present. Therefore I require you / let us now have
three courses a foot with a spear / each of us against other. Than Nicholas
answered and said. Johan / ye know right well / we be here now going on our
way / by the saueconducte of my lord your Constable. Therefore that ye
require can not now be done for I am not the chief of this saueconduct / for
I am but under these other knights y^ be here / for though I would here abide
/ they will not do so. Than the french squire answered. Nycholas / excuse you
not by this means. let your company depart if they list / for I promise you
by covenant / the arms ones done between you and me. I shall bring you in
to the vales of Chierbourge without damage or perell / make ye no dout thereof.
Than Nycholas answered / and said. I think well that ye will bring me thither
/ and I believe it of a very truth. But ye se well / how we go through the
country without any harness / we have none with us. So yt though I would arm
me / I have not wherewith. Than answered Johan: excuse you not by that I shall
show you what ye shall do. I have harnes of diverse sorts at my commandment
/ they shall be brought in to y^ place / where as we shall do deeds of arms.
Than behold them well and chose which ye will / and I shall arm me with the
other. When Nicholas Clifforde saw himself so sore aposed / he was sham fast:
by cause of the^ that were there present and her de the matter. and he saw well
how this John^ offered him so much reason / that he could not with his
honestye refuse him. And moreover Johan said to him. sir / take what part and
what covenant ye will / and I shall not refuse it rather thanne we should not
do deeds of arms. Tha^ Nicholas said: how he would take advise / and show
him his mind or he departed. And if it be so / that I may not do it now / and
that the lords under whom Jame / will not agree thereto / I promise you / as
soon as I come to Chierbourg and you to Boloyne letre me know of your coming
thither / and I shall inco^tynent come to you / and deliver your challenge. Nay
nay quod John^ seek no respite / I have offered and yet do offer you / so many
things so honorable / that in no wise ye can depart / ^auynge your honor:
without doing deeds of arms with me / sithe I require you of it. Than Nycholas
with those words was sorer displeased than he was before / for he saw well
(and true it was) ye he laid sore to his charge / there with the frenchmen went
to their castle / and the englisshmen abode still at their lodging / and so
dyned / and when the frenchmen were in their castle / there was no little
speaking of the words that had been between Johan Bourmell and Nycholas
Clyfforde. In so much that the words thereof came to the hearing of the
constable / and he studied a little thereat. than the knights and squiers of
the country desired him that he would put to his pain / yt this deeds of
arms might be done / and the constable (said) he was content there with. And
when they had dyned / the englyssh knights such as were there and would
depart / they went to the castle to se ye coustable / and to speak with him:
because he should send at the lest.vii. knights to conduct them through
Bretayne and Normandy to Chierbourge. and when they were come to the castle /
the constable received them swetely / and than said to the^. sirs / Ja rest you
all: so that ye shall not depart this day. and tomorowe after mass ye shall
se deeds of arms done / between our squier and yours. and than ye shall dyne
with me / and after dinner / ye shall depart with such guydes as shall bring
you to Chierbourge. So they agreed to him and drank of his wine / and than
returned to their lodging.

THan these two squters / Johan and Nycholas aduysed them well of ye battle /
that they must furnyshe the next day / and so in the next morning they both
hard one mass and were confessed / and so slept on their horses and all the
lords of France on the one part / and the englisshmen on the other part /
and so came all to gyder to a fair plain place without the castle of
Josselyn / and there tarried. Johan Boucmell had made ready two harnesses fair
and good / according as he promised too the english squier / and than (he
said to him) Nycholas chose which ye will have / but he would in no wise
chose / and gave the first choice to the french squier / and so he took the
one and armed him therewith / and Nycholas did help to arm him / and so did he
in like wise again / and when they were both two armed they took good spears
all of one lenght / and so each of them took his place and came a fair pace a
foot each against other / and when they should aproche they couched down
their spears. and at the first stroke Nicholas Clyfforde struck Johan Boucmell
one the breast / and the stroke did slide up to the gorget of mayle / and the
spear heed did enter in to his throat / and did cut a sonder the orgonall
vain / and the spear brake and the tronchion stacke still in the squiers neck
/ who was with that stroke wounded to death. the englisshe squier passed for
the and went and sat down in his chair. When the lords saw that stroke /
and saw how the tronchyon stacke still / they came to him and took of his
bassenet / and drew out the tronchion / and as soon as it was out he turned
about with out any word spekyng / and so fell down deed suddenly / so that the
english squier could not come to him time enough / for he had certain
words to have stau^ched him / that would have helped. but when he saw that he
was deed / he was sore dyspleased because of that adventure / seeing how he
should sle so valya^t a man of arms. he that than had seen the earl of March
would have had pity to se what sorrow he made for his squier / for he loved him
entierly. The constable reconforted him / and said: in such deeds of arms let
no man look for no thing else / though this yuell fortune be fallen on our
squier / the englysshman is not to blame / for he can not amend it. Than the
collable said to thenglisshmen / sirs: let us go and byne it is time / and so
the constable against their good wylles had them with him in to the castle to
dinner / for he would not break his promise for the death of the squier. The earl
of March wept piteously for his squier / and Nicholas Clifforde went to his
lodgyng and would not dyne in ye castle / what for sorrow and for doubt of the
french squiers friends / but the constable sent so for him / that it behooved
him to go to the castle. And when he was come / the constable said: certainly
Nicholas / I believe verily and se well / how ye be sorry for the death of Johan
Bourmell / but Jercuse you for ye can not amend it / for as god help me if I
had been in the same case as ye were in: ye have done nothing but I would have
done the same / or more if I might. for better it is a man to grieve his enemy /
tha^ his enemy should grieve him / such be the adventures of arms. so they sat
down at the table and dyned at their leysar. And dinner done and the wine
drouke / the constable called to him the lord Barrois of bars / and said to
him. Sir: make you ready / I will that ye shall conduct these englysshmen to
Chierbourg / and all they way open to the^ towns and castles / and mynistre to
them all things necessary. The knight answered and said. Sir / with right a
good will it shall be done. Than they took their leave of the constable and of
the other knights there present / and so went to their lodging / and mounted
on their horses and departed fro the castle of Josselyn / and rode to
Pontorson and to mount saint Mychell / under the conduct of the gentle knight
the Barrois of bars / who never left them till they ca^e to Chierbourge. Thus
as ye have herd / deperted the earl of Buckynghams army / both by see and by
land. Nowelet us return to the business of Flaunders in that season / how
they of Gaunt maynteyned them self. And also of the earl of Flaunders their
lord / how he parceyuered against them / who made to them right sore and
cruel war.

How the war began again be twene the earl of Flaunders and the flemynges /
and how they of Ipre were disconfyted by a busshement. Cap. CCC.lxxv.
IT is of truth / that the earl of Flanders at this beginning / feared
little the flemynges nor the gau^to is / for he thought well to bring the^
under by wisdom and by arms / little and little. and specially sith that
John^ Lion and John^ Prunaux were deed. But the gaunto is had as than other
great capitayns / in whom they had great affiaunce / and did all by their
counsel. And Raze de Harsell was captain of the chatelayne of Gaunt / and
Johan of Bannoy captain of Courtrey. and there were other capitayns / as
Johan Bulle / Peter Boyse / Arnolde the Clerk / and Peter of Nuyte. The same
season there was a stryne / between the great men and the commons / within the
town of Bruges / for the mean crafts would have had every thing at their
pleasure / and the great men would not suffer it / and so they rebelled. And a
tertayne weyuers and fullers were slain / and the other apeased. Than the
great men of Bruges sent to the earl to Lysle / desyringe him for gods sake
to come to them as their chief lord / and to help to subdue the commons.
The earl was glad to here that tidings / and so departed Lysle / and sir
Wyllyam of Namure in his company / and a great nombre of knights and squyers
of Flanders / and so came to Bruges / where he was r^ceyued with great joy.
And at the earls coming / there were taken all the principals of them that had
their hertes gauntoise / and such as were suspecte. and so were put in prison
mo than five hundred / and little and little their he des were stryken of. And
when they of Frank understood that the earl was peasably in Bruges / they
feared. and so put them self in to the earls mercy / and he received the^ and
had great joy / for daily his power increased. And also they of Frank always
have taken more the earls part / than all the re^ydue of Flaunders. The earl /
seeing that he had brought under his subjection them of Bruges and of Frank /
and that he had under him knights and squyers of the country of Heynault and
of Arthoyse / he thought than little and little to conquer again his country
/ and to punysshe his rebels. And first he ordained and said: he would go and
se them of Ipre / for he hated the^ greatly / because they opened their gates
so lightly to them of Gaunt, and said / how that they that had made that
treaty / and to let in his enemies to slay his knights should repent it / if
he might get the over hand of them. Than he made his somo^s through Frank
and Bruges / saying how he would go to Ipre. tidings came to Ipre that the
earl their lord ordained himself / to come and assail the^. Than they took
counsel and determined to send word thereof to them of Gaunt / to thentent
that they should send them some men to assyst the town of Ipre / for they
were not bygge enough of them self to keep it without aid of the gauntoyse /
who had promised and sworn to aid them / whansoeuer they had any need. So
they sent covertly letters to Gaunt and to the capitayns / and signified to
the^ the state of the earl / and how he thretned to come and assail them.
Than they of Gaunt remembered well / how they were bound by their faith and
promise / to aid and confort them. Than they set for the two capitayns / John^
Bulle and Arnolde Clerk / and they said to them. Sirs / ye shall take with you
three thousand of our me^ and go hastily to Ipre / to confort them as our good
friends. Incontinent they departed fro Gaunte / and so these three thousand men
came to Ipre / whereof they of the town had great joy Than the earl of
Flaunders issued out of Bruges with a great nombre of men and so came to
Tourande / and the next day to Pourpringue and there tarried three days / till
all his men were come. And than he was about a twenty thousand men of
war.

THey of Gaunt who knew right well all this matter / and how that the earl
would go puissantly to Ipre. They determined to assemble their puysaunce / and
to go by Courtrey to Ipre / and so all together to fight with therle. saying:
that if they might one time overcome him / he should never be releued after.
Than all the capitayns departed fro Gau^t / Raze de Harsell / Peter du Bouse /
and Peter le Nuyte / Johan de Launoy / and diverse other: as Centenyers and
Cinquantenyers. and when they were in the field they were a nine thousand /
and so long they reiourned that they came to Courtrey / where as they were
received with great joy / for John^ de Launoy was captain there Therle of
Flaunders being at Pourpringue and therabout / under stood that they of Gaunt
were coming to Ipre / and that they were at Country on their way. Than the earl
took advise and held all his company together. They of Gaut departed fro
Courtrey and went to Rolers / and there rested. And sent word to them of
Ipre / how they were come thither / she wyng the^ how that if they would issue
out of their town with their power / and such as were sent to them before /
how they should be all togider men ynowe to fight with the earl. Of the which
tidings they of Ipre were right joyful / and so the next day they issued out
mo than.viii. thousand. and Johan Bulle and Arnolde Clerk were their
governors. Therle of Flanders and his power / who was in those marchesse /
knew how they of Ipre were issued out of their town / to mete with them of
Gaunt. I can not tell how nor by what means / in so much that therle
ordained at a passage / by ye which they of Ipre must pass / two great
busshmentes with his son^e the Hase bastard of Flaunders / and the lord
Da^ghien / with diverse other knights and squyers of Flanders and of Heynalt /
with them of Bruges and them of Frank / and in every company / there were.x.
thousand men. Than when they of Ipre and the gauntoise that were with them
with Johan Bulle were in the feldes / and had not iourneyed past one mile /
they found two ways / the one went to Rolers and the other to Tourande. Than
they rested and took advise which way they should take. Than Arnolde le Clerk
said. I counsel / let us go and se our fellows at Rolers. By my faith quod
Johan de Bull / and I think it were better that we were lodged on the Mount
door. For be you sure / I know so well Peter de Boyse and Raze de Harsell /
sith that they have sent for us / surely they will fight with the earl.
Wherefore I am sure they will aproche as nere to him as they can. Therefore I
counsel let us go that way. So they determined to take that way / and when
they had gone a two miles / they were weary of going a foot / and or they were
ware / they were between the two busshmentes. And when they saw that they
cried all / we be betrayed. There were neuermen yt made less defense than they
did as than / for every man did what he could to save him self. Some
returned to Ipre and some took the feldes / and fled he that best might
without array or order. And the earls men took and slew them without mercy /
howbeit John^ Bulle and Arnolde Clerk saved the^ self. they that fled
toward Courtrey met with the gauntoise / who were departed fro Rolers / and
were in the way to Rosebeque. When Peter de Boyse and the other saw them that
fledd / they demanded of them what they ayled / They answered and said / they
could not tell / for they said they had not the leyser to know the matter but
they said they fled like men betrayed. Than Peter de boyse had diverse
Imaginations / other to go forewarde / and to return again the fleers / and
to fight with their ennemies / who chased them: orelles to draw to Courtray.
All things considered / they determined to draw back for that time. The
which they thought was for them (as than) most profitable. So they drew
abacke in a battle raynged i^ good order / and the same day returned to
Courtray. And thither also drew many of them that fled. So they lodged all
within Cortray / and made the gates to be well kept / to thentent that they
should not be suddenly taken. And when John^ Bulle and Arnolde Clerk were
returned / and had rekened all their people / than they knew well / that of
them of Gaunte / such as had been sent to Iper before / they had lost in
nombre a xii. C. and as many of them of Iper. And if they of the buss hement
had chased them that fled to Iper and to Cortray / there had but a few skaped
/ but all had been deed or taken / but they chased not far. They took head to
nothing / but to slay them that were within their bushement. the which saved
all the residue. They of Iper were sore abashed / when they saw their people
return beaten and disco^fited / the same day that they were issued out: and
demanded how it might be. And diverse answered / and said how John^ Bulle
had betrayed them / and had brought them to be shamfully slain.

ye have hard often times recorded how it is a hard warke to apease a
Commontie wha^ they be styrred. I say this because of them of Gaunte. When they
were the same day drawn back to Courtray. They that were disco^fytted knew
well that John^ Bulle was in the town. Than mo than a thousand drew together
and said / let us go on the false traitor John^ Bulle / who has betrayed us.
For by him and by no^e other we took that way that brought us into the
bushement of our enemies. For if we had believed Arnold the Clerk / we had been
in surety / For he would have brought us to our own company / and John^
Bulle had not ben / who has sold and betrayed us / and brought us where as we
were betrayed and discomfytted. Loo / ye may se how these commons accused him
of treason / and yet I think verily they had no cause so to do. For if it had been as they said / and that he had sold and betrayed them to the earl / he
would never have returned again to them / but rather have bydden still with the
earl. How be it I can not excuse him so / but yt it cost him his life / and I
shall tell you how. The gauntoyse went and took him in his lodging / and so
brought him into the streat / and there he was stricken an to pieces / so that
every man bare away a piece of him. Thus ended John^ Bulle. The next day the
Gauntoyse departed fro Courtray and returned to Gaunte / and did send John^ de
Lanuoy to the castle of Gaures / a castle of the earls / standing by the
river of lescaulte / and there this John^ made a garyson.

How they of Iper and Courtray turned to the earl of Flaunders part / and
how the town of Gaunte was besieged. Cap. CCC.lxxvi.
Now let us speak of the earl of Flanders and of his company. When they had
thus by their bushement overthrown the gau^toyse and slain a.iii. M. of them
or there about / what of them of Gau^te and of Iper. Than the earl determined
to draw toward the town of Iper / and to lay siege thereto. And as he was
counsayled so it was done / and he drew thither with all his people / a great
no^bre of knights and squyers of Flanders / of Heynault / and of Artoys / who
were come thither to serve the earl. And when they of Iper understood that the
earl came on them so stro^gely / they were all sore afraid / and the rich men
of the town took counsel / and said among them self / how they would open
their gates / and go and mete the earl / and put them self under his
obeysaunce / and cry him mercy. and to show him how they were gau^toyse by
force / by reason of the comontie / as fullers / weauers / and such other
unhappy people in the town. And they thought that the Earl was so pytefull /
that he would have mercy on them. And as they ordained / so they did. And so mo
than.iii. C. in a company came out of the town of Iper / and had the keys of
the gates with them / and so they fell down on their knees before the Earl
cryenge for mercy / and did put them self and their town at his pleasur. The
earl had pite on them and took them to mercy / and so entered with all his
puyssau^ce in to the town of Iper and there tarried a.iii. wekes / and sent
home again them of Fra^ke and of Bruges. And while therle lay in Iper he
caused to be beheedded mo than.vii. C. of fullers and weauers and of such
manner of people as had brought first into that town John^ Leon and the
gauntoyse / and slain such valiant men as the earl had set there. For the
which cause the earl was sore displeased / and to thente^t yt they should no
more rebel / he sent a.iii. C. of ye most notablest of them into prison in
Bruges. and so tha^ took his way to Courtray to bring that town to his
obeysau^ce. When they of Courtray understood that therle their lord came to
them so stro^gely / and how that Iper was under his obeysau^ce / than they
greatly doubted / for they saw no comfort apparent fro them of Grant.
Wherefore they were advised lyghty to yield them to their lord / thinking it was
better for them to hold with therle / to whom they ought to owe their faith and
homage / rather than to the gauntoyse. Than they ordained a.iii. C. of the best
of the town a foot to go into ye feldes to therle / and the keys of the
town with them. And when therle came by / they all kneled down and cried for
mercy. The earl had pity of them / and received them to mercy / and entered
into the town ioyously / and they al made to him reverence and honor. Than he
took a.ii. C. of the best of the town of Courtray / and sent them to Lisle and
to Daway in hostage / to then tent that that town should no more rebelle. And
when the earl had been there a.vi. days. than he went to Bruges / and there
refresshed him a.xv. days. Than he made a great somons / to thente^t to lay
siege to Gau^te. For all the residue of Flanders was as than at his
commandment. Than the earl departed fro Bruges / and so came and laid siege
before Gau^te / and lodged at a place called the Briet. Thither came to the
earl ser Robert of Namure to serve the earl with a certain nombre of men of
war / according as the earl had written unto him. But sir William of Namure
was not there / he was in France with the king / and with the duke of
Borgoyn. This siege began about the feast of the decollacion of saint John^
Baptist. And ser water Danhien was marshall of all the oost of Flanders. He
was young and hardy / and feared no pain nor peril / whatsoever fell. For all
that the earl lay thus before the town of Gau^te / yet he could not so
constrayne them of the town / but that they kept still open iii. or.iiii. of
their gates. so yt vitayles might come in to them without any dasiger. For they
of Brussels and of Brabant were right favorable to them. And also they of
Liege / to comfort them in their opinion / sent to them a message / saying
thus, ye good people of Gaunte / we of Liege know well / how ye be
soretrauayled / and have much a do with the earl your lord / whereof we are
sore displeased. But syrs know for treuth if we did march nere you / as
within iiii. or.v. leages / we should give you such comfort as men ought to
do to their good neighbors and fre^des. but ye be far of fro us. and also
the country of Brabant is between you and us. wherefore we must forbear. But
thought it be so that ye be as now besieged / yet be not discomforted. For god
knows / and so does all other good towns / that ye be i^ the right of this
war. Wherefore all your busynes shall acheue the better. Thus they of Liege
sent to them of Gaunte to comfort them.

THerle of Flanders / who had thus besieged the town of Gau^te on the side
toward Bruges / and toward Courtray: but as toward Brussels therle could not
come / nor lay his siege / because of the great rivers / that is to say the
river of Lyse / and ye river of lescault. And I say unto you / all things
considered / Gau^te is one of the most strongest towns of yt world. For it
behooves mo tha^.ii. C. M. men to besiege it round / and to stop fro it all
the ryuers and passages / and also that the ostis lie nere together / for else
they could not comfort one another / because of the rivers. And also there is
much people in the town of Gau^te / they were in those days / men of defense
/ a.iiii. score. M. me^able to bear harneis / bitwene.lx. year and.xv.

And when therle had layen at this siege the space of a month / and that his
men / and the Haze his sone / and his marshall had made many askrymysshe with
them of Gau^t / and some day wo^ne and some day lost / as the adventures of
war falls. Than therle was cou^sayled on a day to send them of Bruges / of
Iper / and of Pourprynge to skrymysshe with the gauntoyse / at a place called
ye long bridge / for it was thought yt if they might win that place / it
should be a great aduau^tage and profitte for them / for tha^ they should enter
into the.iiii. crafts / and thereby aproche nere to Gau^te. And so there was
ordained sir Josse Ualuin to be chief captain of that enterprise. And so when
they were come to this passage / they found it not disgarnisshed but well
provided for / with a great nombre of men of Gau^te. There was Peterdu voyse /
Peter de Nuytee / and Raze de harzelles. There began a sore skrymysshe /
there was shotyng of gonnes and crosbowes on both parties / whereby diverse were
slain and wounded. And right well the gauntoyse did acquyte them self / for
they reculed their enemies / and wanne by force the goldsmythes baner of Bruges
/ and there it was cast down in to the water. And there were of the
goldesmythes and other a great nombre slain and hurt / and specially ser
Josse Ualuin was thereslayne / Which was great vomage. And so the other
returned again without doing any more. So the gauntoyse bare them self
valiauntly.

How the earl of Flaunders raised up his siege fro the town of Gau^te / and
of the battle between him and the gauntoyse. Cap. CCC.lxxvii.
OUrynge this siege before Gau^te there were many skrymysshes before the town
/ for the lord Danghien and ye seneschall of Heynault and the Haze of Flanders
when they might spy any manner of aduau^tage / they took none to rau^some. And
some time they were so put abacke / that they had no leyser to look behind
them. Than they of Gau^te drew together to the no^bre of.vi. M. and Raze of
Harzelles / Arnolde Clerk and John^ Launoy were capitaynes. And they departed
out of Gau^te without any danger of the oste / and went to Alour a good closed
town / and the earl had lyenge there in garrison diverse knights. But
incontinent as they knew of the coming of the gau^toyse they fled out of the
town at the gate toward Brussels / for else they had been deed / for the town
incontinent was brent and spoiled by the gauntoyse / wherein they conquered
great pyllage. And fro thence they went to Teremo^d a strong town yet by
assaute they conquered it. And there was slain ser Philip of Namure. And so the
gauntoyse were lords of the town / but not of the castle: for the lord of
Wyndscot kept it valiantly. Than the Gauntoyse went to Granmout / the which
was newly turned to the earls part by the treaty of the lord Da^ghien. and I
can not tell whether it were by treason or not but ye gau^toyse entered by force
/ and many of them within slain. And when they had made this voyage / they
returned again to Gaunte with great pray and pyllage.

When the earl of Flanders saw that he lost his time / with lyeng at the
siege before Gau^te / and how that he lay there at great cost and charge /
and great pain to him and to his people: for he saw well that they within
left not for all him to issue out and bren the country / and knew well how
they had conquered Teremo^de and Granmont during the siege. Therefore therle was
cou^sayled to depart thence / because winter approached. And so he did / and
sent his people home to their own houses to refresshe the^. And he sent the
lord Danghten and the lord Montigny to And warp^ in garrison / and beside ye
men of arms he had a.ii. CC. good archers of England / whereof he made great
count. And the earl went than to Bruges. and they that lay in And warpe made
diverse skrymysshes with the gauntoyse / for they issued out nere hand every
day into the feldes / so that none could go to Gaunte to bring thither any
vitayles or other marchaundise / without they were slain or taken. And when
it came to the monethe of April and that winter was past / the earl than
assembled again his people both fro Iper / fro Cortray / fro Pourprynge / fro
Dan / fro Sluice and fro Frank / and so he departed fro Bruges and went to
Nieule / and there he tarried a certain space / and of all his men of arms he
made captain the lord Danghien. So than the earl was to the nombre of.xx. M.
and determined to go to Gawres / where as John^ Launoy was. And when he knew
the coming of the earl he sent word thereof to Gau^te to Raze de Harzelles
for some aid and comfort. Than Raze assembled together.vi. M. and issued out
of Gaunte / and went toward Gawres / but there he found not John^ de Launoy /
for he was at Douze on the other side of the river and pylled the country
there. and so they drew together / and rode forth all that day / and met with
them of And warpe and Douze going toward therle. And there the gau^toyse did
assail them and slew of them a.vi. C. but the lord Danghiea was not in that
company / for he was gone to therle / who was in ye feldes between Bruges and
Douze. And wha^ these tidings came to the earl / and to the lord Danghien /
how they of And warpe had received such damage / they were sore displeased.
Than it was ordained / yt the lord Danghien with.iiii. M. should go to Gaures.
thynking to find John^ Launoy there but he was not there / for he was drawn
back to Gaunte with all his pyllage and prisoners / of the which there was no
great quantite. And the next day after / Raze de Harselles departed out of
Gau^te / with.vi. M. and John^ Launoy with him. And also the same day there
issued out of Gaunt Peter du boyse with.vi. M. and Arnolde Clerk in his
company. and they went and brent the suburbs of Courtray / and than they
returned toward Douse / to mete with their own company / but they came to
late. for when Johan Launoy and Raze of Harselles came to Nyeule. There they
found the earl and all his company ready in the field / abiding for non other
thing but for battle. And so therles host and the gauntoyse found each other
/ without any knowledge in the morning. And when Raze of Harselles and John^
Launoy saw that they must needs fight. than they set their men in three
batayles / and in every battle two thousand men / of the most hardyest of
Gaunt. And Peter du Boyse and Arnolde Clerk had as many with them / and they
were abroad in the field and knew nothing that their company and the earl
were so nere together / nor that they should fight as they did. For it was
ordained among them or they departed fro Gaunte / that if they found therle
with his hole puissau^ce / that they should not fight with him / without they
were all toguyder. For they thought theymselfe not bygge enough to encountre
the earl / without they were all toguyder in one battle. And to this they were
sworn to uphold. And to say truth / Raze of Harsels might have let the
battle / if he had list. For if he would have kept himself still in the
town / and have tarried till Peter du Boyse had come to him. The earl would
not have assailed them in the town so shortly. but ass one as Raze de
Harsels knew that therle was there / incontinent by great pride he issued out
in to the field and said. How he would fight with his enemies and have the
honor himself / and not to abide for Peter du Boyse and his company. He had
so great trust in his own company / and so good hope in the fortune of them of
Gaunte / that he thought he could lose nothing. And well it showed ye same day
/ the great will that he had to fight / as ye shall here after.

O Reatly was therle of Flanders reioysed / when he saw that Raze of Harsels
was issued out of Nieule / and was abroad in ye field ready to fight. Than
therle ordered his men / and he was about the nombre of.xx. thousand / and he
had a.xv. hundred spears knights and squyers / of Flaunders / Heynalt /
Brabant / and Artoyse. Of Heynault there was the lord Danghien marshall of the
host / and with him the lord Mo^tigny / and my lord the bastard Da^ghien /
Gyles Ryston / Johan Burlemont / and diverse other. And of Flaunders there was
the lord of Guystels / sir Guy of Guystels / ye lord Cornettes / the lord
Hulluc / the lord of Halwyn / sir Danyell of Halwyn / sir Tyrrey Disquetan /
sir Johan Discoubourcke / the lord of Gentus / sir Johan Uillayne / sir
Gerarde of Mortigiliet / and diverse other. and there were made a certain of
new knights. Before the young seneshall of Heynalt dyed on his bed at Aubyes
/ beside Mortayne. Therle made five batayls / and in every battle four
thousand men / every man in great desire to ron on their enemies. and that day
the lord of Lieurghien bare therles baner. When all the batayls were well
ordered / the five batayls aproched against the three batayles of the gauntoyse.
And at the first setting on / there aproched but three of the earls batayles /
for the other two were as wings / to comfort the bataylles if need required.
There the earl him self prayed all his company to do well their deuoyre / and
to take vengeance of these outragyous gauntoise / who had put him to so much
pain. And also he said to the^ of the good towns. Sirs / be ye all sure / for
if any of you fly away / ye were better here to be slain / for without mercy
it shall coost you all your heedes. And so therle set them of Bruges in the
first battle / they of Fra^ke in the second and they of Ipre and of Courtray
in the third and they of Propigne / of Bergues / of Cassell / and of Bourge in
the fourth battle. And he retained with him self / them of Lyle / of Doway /
and of Andwarpe. Thus they assembled their batayls / and ca^e each against
other. And of the gauntoyse / Raze of Harselles led the first battle / for
he was the most hardyest / therefore he would be with the formast. To thentent
to get honor if he could / and so he encountered against the battle of them of
Bruges / led by the lord of Guystell and his brotherne. and there was a sore
encountre / and so all the batayls assembled toguyder. There were many
overthrown on the one perte and on the other / and the gau^toyse did many proper
deeds of arms / but the earl had a far greatter nombre / for they were three
against one. There was a good assaut and long endured or it could be known or
seen / who should have the better. and when all the batayls were joined togeder
/ they of Flaunders cried lion / deco^fortyng each other. and the other cried
with an high voice / Gau^t gaunt. There was one time that the earls company
were in adventure to have had the worse. And if they had lost their ground /
they had been all slain without remedy. For Peter de boyse with.vi. M. with him
/ were in the feldes / and might well se ye battle / but he could not come
thither / to comfort or aid his company / because of the marisshes and waters
that were between them. But and therle had lost the field and his men fled /
Peter de boyse should have met with them / so that none should have escaped /
earl nor other. But all should outher have been slain or taken / which should
have been great damage to Flaunders / and by likelihod never to have be^
recovered again.

How the gau^toyse were brent in the church of Nieule. and how the white
hodes slew diverse noble me^ of the earl of Flaunders part. Cap. CCC.lxxviii.
Raze of Harsels and John^ of Launoy had none auau^tage in assaylinge the earls
men. For the earl had there many a noble knight / and many a goodman out of
Bruges / Ipre / Courtray / Andwarpe / Danne / Sluse / and Frank. Also the earl
was four men against one / so that when all the earls batayls were assembled
toguyder. there were so many / that the gauntoyse could not endure them / but
opyned and reculed toward the town of Nieule. As Soon as they brake their
array / the earls men entered in among the^ / and slew them by heaps. Than the
gau^toyse reculed toward the mynster of Nieule / which was a strong hold.
and there was a great slaughter at the entryng of the gauntoyse in to the
mynster. John^ de Launoy all abashed and disco^fyted / entered in to the
mynster to save him self / and went in to the steple / and such of his
company as he could get in with him. and Raze de Harsels abode behind him and
reculed his company / and did great feate of arms at the door. But finally he
was stricken with a long pyke through the body and so slain. Thus ended Raze
of Harsels / who had been a great captain in Gau^t against therle. And the
gauntoyse loved him greatly / because of his wisdom and prowes / but for his
valya^tnesse this was his end and reward. When therle of Flau^came to the
mynster / and saw how the gauntoyse fled in to the church. Than he
commanded to set fire on the mynster. His commandment was shortly done /
fire / fagottes / and straw were set together round about the church: the
fire anon mounted up to the covering of the mynster. There dyed the Gauntoyse
in great pain / for they were brent quick / and such as issued out were
slain / and cast again in to ye fire. Johan Launoy who was in the steple /
saying him self at the point to be brent / cried to them without / ransom
ransom. and offered his cote / which was full of florens to save his life.
But they without did but laughe and scorn at him / and said to him. Johan /
come out at some window and speak with us / and weshall receive you. make a
leap in likewise as ye have made some of us to leap wtin this yer. yt be
houeth you to make this leap. wha^ John^ Launoy saw him self in that point /
and yt he was without remedy / and that the fire took him so nere / yt he saw
well he should be brent. He thought it were better for him to be slain than to
be brent. and so helept out at a wyndowe among his enemies / and there he was
received on speres and swerdes and cut all to pieces / and cast a gain into the
fire. thus ended John^ Launoy.

OF six thousand men that Raze de Harsels and Johan de Launoy had out of
Gau^t and about Gau^t / and such as served the gau^toise for their wages. there
escaped away alive about three hundred. all the resydue were slain in the dykes
/ in thefelde / and in the town: and brent in the mynster. And Peter de Boyse
/ who had a great battle in the field could not aid the^ / for between his
battle and Raze de Harselles there was a great marys and much water / where
fore he could not come to them. Than he departed fro the place there as he was
and all his me^ / well raynged in good order of battle and said. Let us go
fair and easily toward Gaunt. Raze of Harselles and Johan of Launoy with
their company has spedde but yuell / they are disconfyted / I can not say what
shall fall of us. if we be followed and assailed by the Earls men. Let us keep
us together and let us fight valya^tly / like them that fight for our right.
And all they that herd him said / so they would do. and so than he departed
and took the way toward Gaut in a fair bataile well rainged and in good
order. Some of the^ that fled fro the battle retourued to Gaunt / and showed
all the adventure / how Raze of Harsels and Johan of Launoy and their company
were discomsyted and slain in the battle of Nieule. When they of Gaunt herd
those tidings / they were sore afraid and sorousull for the death of Raze /
for he was well-beloved. and they had a great trust in him / for they had ever
found him a good captain and a true. And because that Raze was a gentylman
borne / and son to alorde and to a lady / and that he had served them trewely
for their money / they loved and honored him the more. Than they of the town
demanded of them that were come thither flyeng fro y^ field / where Peter de
Boyse was / during the field? and they that had not seen him / nor knew not
where he was / answered and said. We can not tell you where he was / for we saw
him not. tha^ some of them of the town of Gaunt / began to murmr against
Peter de Boyse and said / how he had yuell aquyted him self / in that he was
not at y^ field: seeing that he had a six. M. men of war with him. And so they
of the town were determined that as soon as Peter du Boyse should return /
they would slay him. and than agree with their lord therle / and put them all
in to his mercy. I believe if they had done thus / they had done wisely / and I
think sortlye have come to peace. But they did not thus the which they
derely bought after / and in like wise so did all the country of Flaunders.
For yet to this day / every thing is not as it ought to be in Flanders. When
this bataile at Nieul was done / the Earl understood that Peter du Boyse and a
great battle of Gauntoyse were still abroad in the feldes / and were going to
Gaunt. Than the earl demanded counsel / whyder he should go and fight with
the^ or not. and his lords and knights answered him / how he had done
enough for that day. And how that his men were weary / and had need of rest.
But they counsayled to send a five or six hundred men of arms to pursue them
/ and to se what they did. Saying / how paraue^ture they might hap to find
their enemies lodged that night in such a place / that they would look on them
/ at their dislodgynge in the morning. The earl was content with this counsel
and so it was done. Anon they were appointed out that should go in this company
/ and the lord Daughien was chief captain. So they deperted fro Nieuie and
rode under covert / to se the demeanor of the gauntoyse. and at last they
saw the gauntoyse where they disce^ded down a hill / keeping them self close
and in good order. The lord Danghien and his company pursued them a far of /
on the one side. And Peter de Boyse and the gau^toyse saw them well / but they
made no semblant. Than said Peter de Boyse to his company. Sirs / let us keep
on our way and break none order. if they come on us / let us receive them /
but I think they will not medyll with us. Thus they rode till they came to
Gaunt. Than the lord Da^ghien returned to the earl / and Peter de Boyse and
his company entered in to Gaunt. Than Peter du Boyse was so received / that he
was at y^ point to have been slain / because he had not helped Raze de Harsels
/ at the battle of Nieule. Peter de Boyse excused himself and said / how he
had send to Raze / that in no wise he should fight with the earl / without he
were in his company / because the earl had so great a puissau^ce / but Raze
did the clean contrary. And therefore though yuell become to him / I can not do
therewith. And sirs / know surely: that I am as sorry and as much displeased
for his death / as any man may be. For the town of Gaunte has lost of him a
right valyant man / and a sage captain. Therefore it is conuenyent to seek out
for another discrete / sage / and of good renome / or else let us all put our
self under the obeysa^ce of the earl. And he shall distroye us all / and make
us to dye a villayne death. behold now? chose what ye will do / outher
perceyuer and co^tynue as we have done / or else to put us in to the earls
mercy? And as than there were none that answered him / but as for the battle of
Nieule / and of the death of Raze de Harselles / he was excused. And because
they gave him none answer to that he said / he was sore dyspleased in his
mind. And specially he was not content with some of the burgesses that were
there present / of the best and most notablest of y^ town. As sir Guysbert
Grut / and sir Symonde Brette. He made as than to them no semblant / but he
showed well his displeasure to the^ or the year past / as yeshall here after.

When the lord Da^ghien and the lord Montigny / the Hase of Flaunders / and
their routes were returned from Nieule to the earl / and had showed him all
that they had seen. Than therle departed and went to Bruges / and sent home his
people of y^ good towns / and he send them of Frank with the lord Da^ghien
to And warpe. And when they of Gaunte understood that the Earl was gone back
to Bruges / and that his people were departed fro him. Than by the styrring and
mouyng of Peter de Boyse / they of Gaunt drew together / for he said to the^.
Sirs / let us go forward / let us not be this a cold to make war. let us
show ourselfe / like people to do an entprise. And so there deperted out of
Gau^t mo than fyftene. M. and so came strongly before Courtray / and laid siege
to the town / while y^ feast and processyon was at Bruges. The which was the
year of our lord / a thousand three hundred.lxxxi. There they were ten days
and bre^t the subbarbes / and the country about. and when the earl herd
thereof / he sent for all his gentylmen and garrisons / and for the commons of
Ipre and Frank. and so departed fro Bruges / and he was to the nombre of. xxb.
thousand / and so he took the way toward Courtray to fight with the
gauntoyse / and to reyse the siege. And when Peter de Boyse and the gau^toyse /
herd how the earl was coming to them ward with so great a no^bre / than they
determined no longer to keep the siege / but so departed and went and lodged at
Douse and at Nieule. Saying how they would abide the earl there / and sent
word of their estate to Gaunt / and sent for the rerebande / to the intent to
be the stronger / and to have the more people. And so there departed again fro
Gaunte / to the nombre of.xv. thousand / and so came to their company to
Nieull and to Douse / and there lodged all together in the feldes abydinge the
earl. And when the earl was come to Harlbecke beside Courtrey / than he
understood that the gauntoyse were departed to wards Gaunte / and were lodged
about Nieule and Douse. Than the earl was cou^sayled not to pursue them / and
so gave leave to his men to depart. and he sent the lord Da^ghien and
heynowers / and his bastard son the Hase of Flanders to And warpe in
garyson. and when the gauntoyse saw that therle came not on the^ / than they
departed fro Nieule and fro Douse / and took the high way by And warpe to come
to Gaunt. And the same day that they passed / they sent to And warpe a
certain nombre of their men / of whom Arnolde Clerk was captain / to y^
barryers of the town / to scrumysshe with them within the town. and the
knights and squyers that were within / could not absteyne themself / but
came and scrimysshed with them. so that there were hurt and slain diverse on
both parties. and at last they departed and entered into Gau^t / every man to
his own house. And three days after / Arnolde Clerk was ordained to go to
Gaures with a.xii. hundred of the white hobes / to lie in the castle and there
about / in manner as a country garysone against And warpe. And so thither went
Arnold clerk with his company / and he had not ben there long but he understood
that certain knights and squyers were issued out of And warp to seek
adventures. Than Arnolde Clerk departed fro Gaures / and with him a. xb. C.
and so laid the^ self in a busshment / to mete with them yt were issued that
morning out of And warpe. whereof there were diverse gentylmen: as the lord of
Cornayse / the lord of Remseles / sir Johan of Uyllayns / the lord Danghien /
the Galoys of Mamynes / the bastard of Cornayse / and the Blancharde of
Calemey. And as these knights and squyers were retournynge to And warpe / the
busshment brake out on the^. And there were diverse slain / hurt / and
overthrown / for the gau^toyse took non to mercy. There these knights and
squiers horses did them good service for they broched their spurs to their
horses / and so returned to And warpe. and at the barriers of the town they a
lighted / and put them self to defense / abiding for their company and var
lettes. yet they could not enter so clean / but that there were slain mo than
three score. And than Arnolde clerk returned and lodged the same night at an
abbey thereby / called Chem. And in the abbey they found Peter Destonehoyr and
the Galoys of mamynes / and a. C. of their copany with them. Than Arnolde
Clerk assailed the abbey / and with great pain the Galois of mamynes saved
him self / and departed out at a back posterne and entered in to a boat / and
by night time went to And warp / and showed the lord Danghien / the lord
Montigny / and sir Danyell of Halwyn / and the other knights y^ were there. How
the same night Arnolde clerk and the white hodes were in thabbey of Chem and
had slain diverse of their company. and said how he thought verily / that
Peter Destonehoix was there slain. and so he was in deed. For Arnolde clerk
and his company made him to leap out at a wyndowe / and there was received With
glayues and slain / which was great damage.

How the white hoodes and their capitayn were slain. and how Phylyppe
Dartuell was chosen capiteyn of Gaunt. Cap. CCC.lxxix.
When the knights and squyers yt were within Andwarpe / understood that
Arnolde Clerk and the white hodes / to the nombre of.xii. hundred / were at
the abbey of Chem / and had taken there diverse of their companyons. They were
right sore displeased / and so determined to send the same night their spies /
to se where they might find their enemies in the next morning. And as they
ordained so they did / and in the morning the spies brought report / how the
white hodes were determined to abide there all that day / wherewith these lords
and knights were right joyful. Than they armed them: as the lord Da^ghien /
the lord of Mo^tigny / the lord of Bresuell / sir Michaell de la Hamarde /
and mo tha^ six hundred knights and squiers of Heynalt and as many of
Flanders. and out of And warpe a three hundred spears / and mo than a
thousand crosbowes and other varlets. and when they aproched nere to them /
they sent before sir Olyuer of Chem / and a hundred spears with him to begin
the assaut. to the intent to draw out of the abbey Arnolde Clerk / and to
ocupy the time / while their footmen and crosbowes were come to them. Than
sir Danyell and sir Peter of Disquemake / and the Hase of Flanders came before
the abbey of Chem / and cried flau^ ders with the lion of the bastard. The
gauntoyse / who were not ware of the busshment because it was so early / nor
they were not fully ready. And are Arnolde Clerk could bring his men toguyder
in good arraye: the lord Danghien / the lord of Lens / the lord of Bresuell
/ the lord of Cornayes / the lord of Montigny. and their batayls entered
behind into the town / in cryeng Danghien. And set on the gauntoise and white
hodes so valiauntly / that they could not endure but brake their order. So yt
there was slain of the^ / what in the abbey and in the feldes.xi. hundred /
and they were but.xii. hundred in all. And there was Arnolde Clerk slain with
two pikes as he was flyeng. and so he was laid up leanyng against a hedge. And
after this disconfytur the lord Danghien and the other knights returned to
And warpe. and so this deed was reputed a great prowes. And when therle of
Flanders knew these tidings / he was greatly reioysed / and said to the
lord Da^ghien. how he was his fair goodson / and should prove a noble valiant
man. To say the truth of the lord of Danghien / in him was all the honor of
the county ol Flaunders. and so while therle lay at Bruges / he called him not
all only his cosyn / but also his fair son.

When it was known at Gaunte / that Arnolde Clerk was deed and his men
disco^fyted there were many than that were sore abashed / and said among them
self. Our business proves but yuell. Little and little / our capitayns and
men are slain. We think we have done yuell to move this war thus against our
own lord / for he does minysshe us thus little and little. The yuell will and
hatered that was by twene Gylbert Mahue and Johan Lion / turns to our great
damage. I trow we have to long sustained the opinyons of Johan Lion and Peter
de Boise. They have brought us so deep into this war / and into the hatered of
the earl our lord / that now we can not nor know not how to find any
remedy / to have mercy and peace. yet it were better that.xx. or.xxx. did repent
it / than^e all the hole town. Thus there were diverse yt said each to other
privily / they durst not speak it generally / for dout of the^ that were yuell.
For they were all of one sect / and daily increased in puissaunce. And in the
beginning they were but poor companyons without any substance / but than
they had gold and silver enough. For when they neded and co^playned to their
capitayns / they were well herd and comforted. For than anon some of the
rich men of the town should be sent for to them / and when they were come /
for fear they durst not refuce so to do. Than the capitayns would say to
the^. Sirs / it behooves that the good town of gau^t make some shyft to pay
our soudyers / who aydeth and helps to defend and to keep our iurysdictyons
and fraunchiese / and it behooves that our companyons must live. And so they
would ask of every man as they list them self and none durst say nay. For
and they had / incontinent they should have been slain / and borne in hand.
how they had been traitors to the good town of Gaunt / and loved not the
welthe / honor / nor profit thereof. Thus the knaves and yuell dysposed
people / were masters in the good town of Gaunt. And so continued / as long
as the war was between the^ and the earl of Flanders their lord. And to say
the very truth / though the rich and noble men of the good town of Gau^t
/ were thus beaten with such rods / there ought none to be so rye thereof. Nor
they could not excuse themself / but that by their own fautes / they were
cause of their own trouble / reason proves how. for when therle of Flanders
send to the^ his baily / to have done justice on certain rebels / and evil
disposed people. They might if they had list / abydden by him / and have given
him confort in doing of justice / the which they did not. but it seemed / that
they had leauer the matter had gone yuell as it did / rather than well. And
had rather to have war with their own lord tha^ peace. For well they might
know / that if they had war / that the yuell people should be lords of the
town / and should be their masters / and not to be put down again when they
would. This proved well by John^ Faucell / who (to y^ intent to dissymule the
matter) departed out of the town of Gaunte / and went and / dwelte in Heynaulte
/ whereby he thought to be pourged out of blame / for the war between therle
and the town / thinking to bear no blame of neither party. How be it the
matier was so laid to his charge / that he dyed thereby / which was great
damage. for this John^ Faucell was in his time a right sage and a noble wise
man / but it is hard halting before lords and their cou^sayles / for they se
clearly. This man could well aid and counsel other / but as touching him
self / he could not take the best way. I can not say / whyder he were
culpable or not / of the artycles that he was examyned of at Lyle / by ser
Simon Rayn / but the knights and yuell fortune turned all against him / so
that he dyed. And in like wise so is fallen of all y^ capitaynes of Gau^t that
sustained the rebellion against their lord. Also it has cost sith many a ma^s
life in Gau^t and parauenture many a one / that were in no defaulte.

When Peter du Boyse / saw that the town of Gau^re daily enpaired and febled
/ as well in their capitayns as in their men. And saw well how the rich men
began to wax weary / and were in mind to leave the war. Wherefore he doubted
greatly / and imagined / and same well that by no means of the world / there
could any peace be made with the earl so that he should besure of his life. Than
he remembered him self of John^ Lion / who was his master / and studied by
what means he wrought. And he saw well that he could not do all thing alone /
nor that he had not the wit and understanding / to govern the hole town of
Gau^te. Wherefore he thought he would not have the pryncypall charge / but in
all folisshe enterprises he thought covertly to have the study of them. Than he
remembered him self of a man / the which was not greatly taken head of / in
the town of Gau^t. he was a wise man / but his wisdom was not known / nor he
was not taken head of / till the same day. He was called Philip Dartuell / sone
to Jaques Dartuell / who in his time.vii. year together had the governance of
all the county of Flanders. And he hard Peter du boyse and John^ Lion his
master / and diverse other ancient men of Gaunte often times say / that the
country of Flaunders was never more loved / honored / and feared / than it was
in the time of Jaques Dartuell / the which endured y^ space of.vii. year. And
as than he hard daily the gau^ toyse say / how that when Jaques Dartuell lived
/ their busynes was in good estate / for than they said / they might have peace
at their wyls / and the earl was glad when he might perdon us all. Peter de
Boyse remembered well these words in him self / and saw how Jaques Dartuel
had a son called Philip / a right couenable and gracious man. And the queen
of England / while the lay at Gau^t / during the sege before Turney was his
godmother / and so for the love of her / he was named Philyp. Than Peter de
Boyse in an evening came to this Philip / who was abiding in his mothers
house / and lived honestely on their rentes. And Peter de boyse began to reason
with him / and began to open the matter / wherefore he was come to him / and said
thus. Philyp / if ye will take good head to my words / and believe my counsel
/ I will make you the greattest man in all the county of Flanders. How can
that be sir said Philip. I shall show you said Peter. ye shall have the
gouernynge and mynistration of all them in y^ town of Gaunte. for we be now
in great necessyte to have a sovereign captain of good name and of good
renoume. And so by this means your father Jaques Dartuell / shall rise again
in this town / by the remembrance of you. for every man says / that sith
his days / the country of Flaunders has not ben so loved / honored / nor
feared / as it was while he lived. and I shall lightly set you in his stead /
if ye list your self. And when ye be in that auctorite / than ye shall govern
your self by my counsel / till ye have full understanding of every case / y^
which ye shall soon learn. Tha^ this Philip / who was at man's state / and
naturally desired to be auaunced / honored / and to have more tha^ he had /
answered and said. Peter du boyse / ye offer me a great thing / and I believe
you. And if I were in the state that ye speak of / I swear to you by my faith
/ that I should do nothing without your counsel. Than Peter answered and
said. How say you / can ye bear your self high and be cruel among the
commons / and specially in such things as we shall have to do. A man is
nothing worth without he be feared / doubted / and some time renowned with
cruelty. Thus must the fle^mynges be governed. Ama^ must set no more by the
life of men / nor have no more pity thereof than of the lives of swalowes or
larkes / the which be taken in season to eat. By my faith said Philip all
this ca^ I do right well. That is well said quoth Peter. And I shall make you so /
that ye shall be soueraygne above all other. And so therewith he took leave of him
and departed. The night passed / the next day came. Than Peter du boyse came
into a place / Where as there were assembled moo than.iiii. M. of his sect and
other / to here some tydyng es and to know how they should be ordered / and
Who should be chief captain of Gaunte. And there was present the lord of
Harzelles / after Whom much of the busynes Within Gaunte was ordered. But of
going outward he would not meddle. And so there among them / there was named
diverse persons of the town of Gau^t. and Peter de boyse stood still and hard
them well. and than he spoke openly and said. Sirs I believe well all this y^ ye
say / ye speak of good affection / and by great deliberation of courage / that
ye have to the keeping of the honor and profit of this town. And also such
persons as ye have named be right able / and have well deserved to have part
of y^ gouernynge of the town of Gau^te. but ss I know one that if he will
meddle therewith / I think there should not be a meter man therefore / nor of a
better name. Than Peter was desired to show his name / and so he named him and
said. Sirs it is Philip Dartuell / who was cristened at saint Peter's in this
town of Gaunte / by the noble queen of England called Philip. The same season
that Jaques Dartuel was before Tournay with y^ king of England and the duke
of Brabant / the duke of Guerles / and therle of Heynault / y^ which Jaques
Dartuell this Philips father governed the town of Gau^te and the country of
flaunders so well* that it was never so well ruled sith / as I have hard say /
and do here daily of the ancient men / who had knowledge thereof / Who say the
town was never so well kept sith as it was in his time / for Flaunders was in
a great iopardie to be lost / and by his wisdom he recovered it. ser s know
for truth we ought better to love the branches and members that comes from
so high a valiant man as he was / than of any other. And as soon as Peter du
boyse had said those words / Philip Dartuell entered so in to every man's
courage / that they said all with one voice. Let us have him / we will have none
other / go send for him. Nay not so quoth Peter du boyse / let him not be sent
fore / it were better we went to him / we know not as yet how he will
maynteyne himself / let him first be examyned.

Of the ordinance of Gau^te. And of the war of Spaygne and of Por tyngale.
Cap. CCC.lxxx.
ANd so with Peter du boyse words / all they y^ were there and diverse other
that followed them came to the house / where as Phylyp Dartuell was / who knew
right well before their coming y^ matter. There was the lord of Harzell /
Peter du boyse / Peter le mite and a.x. or.xii. of the chief aldermen of the
crafts / and there they showed to Phylyp Dartuell how the good town of
Gaunte was in great danger without they might have a captain and a
sovereign / who both without and within might order al manner of people abidynge
in Gaunte. Wherefore they said they gave al their voices to him / and did chose
him to be their soueraygne captain for the good renome of his name / and for
the love of his good father / they were better content with him than with any
other. Wherefore they desired him affectuously / that he would take on him the
charge / and they swear unto him faith and troth / as to their lord /
promysyng how every body within the town should be under his obey sau^ce.
Philip understood well all their words and requestis / and than right sagely
he answered and said. Sirs ye require me of a great thing and I think ye
remember not well how the case stands / when ye would that I should have the
gouernynge of the town of Gau^te / ye say how the love y^ your p^decessors had
to my father draws you to this prpose / but for all y^ suice y^ my father did
/ yet at the last he was slain among you. and so if I should take on me y^
gouernyng as ye speak of and than at last to be slain / than I should have but
a small reward. Philip quod Peter du boyse / y^ is past can not be recovered /
work by counsel / and ye shall alweys be so well cou^sayled / that every man
shall praise you. Than said Philip I would be loath to do other wise. There he
was taken up among them and brought in to the Market place / and there they
made to him assurau^ce both mayres / alderme^ / and masters of every craft in
Gaunte. Thus Philip was made chief captain in all Gau^te / and thus at the
beginning he was in great grace / for he spoke swetely to every man that had
any thing to do with him / and dealt* so wisely that every man loved him / for
part of the reue^nues that perteyned to the earl of Flanders in Gau^t as his
heritage / he caused them to distributed to the lord of Harzels because of
gentylnes and the more honestely to mainteyne his estate. For all that ever he
had in Flaunders / without the town of Gaunte / he had lost it clearly.

Now let us leave a little to speak of the busynes of Flaunders / and let us
somewhat speak of England and of Portyngale.

ye have hard well before / how that after that king Henry of Castile was
drsseased and his eldest sone John^ crowned king / and his wife crowned queen
/ who was daughter to Peter of Aragon. Than the war began between the king
Fernando of Portyngale / and the king of Castile for certain occasions
between them / and specially for the dealing of y^ (...). ladies Constance and
Isabel / daughters to the king Dampeter / The first married to the duke of
Lancastre / and the second to the Earl of Cambridge. And the king of
Portyngale said / how that the king of Castile had wrongfully without cause
disherited his two cosyns of Castile. and that it was not to be suffered that
such two so noble ladies should be dysheryted fro their heritages / for the
matier might ro^ne so long / that it should be forgoten / Whereby the ladies
should never recover their right. The which thing he said he would not
suffr^* Seeing that he was one of their next kynsmen / and as well for the love
of god / as for to keep the reason of Justice / to the which he said every
noble man ought to entend and inclyne. And so he defied y^ king John^ of
Castile / who was crowned king of Spaigne / Galise / Castile / and Civil. And
so thus the king of Portyngale made him war on these said articles. King
John^ defended him right valiantly against him / and he* sent to his fro^ters
in to garrison great nombre of men of arms to resist against his enemies / so
that at the beginning he lost no thing. He had right sage and good knights
of France with him / who comsorted him greatly in his warris and gave him good
counsel / as the Begue of Uilames / and ser Peter his son / sir John^ of
Bergettes / ser William of Lignac / ser Water Puissac / y^ lord of Taride ser
John^ and ser Tristram of Roy / and diverse other that were gone thither /
after the earl of Buckingham had been in Britayne / for y^ french king had
great aliaunce and confederacions with the king of Castile. Wherefore the king
of Portingale aduysed to send certain messangers into England / to the king
and to his uncles / to thentent to have aid of him in such wise that he might
be able to maynteyne his War against the spaignardes. Than he called to him a
wise and valiant knight and a great lord / called John^ Ferrande / and to him
he showed all his intent / and said. John^ ye shall bear me these letters of
credence in to England / I can not send a better messanger than you / nor
none that knows so well the besynes of France as ye do. ye shall recommende
me to the king with these letters / and show him how I sustain my cosyns i^
their right of Spaigne / Galice / and Cyuill. Wherefore say that I require him
to send to me his uncle the duke of Lancastre / and his wife / and a certain
no^bre of men of arms and archers. And wha^ they be come / we trust than to
make good war / what with them and with our own puissau^ce / so that we
trust to recover our heritages. Sir said y^ knight / at yo^ pleasur I shall
fulfill your message. And not long after he entered into ship to do his voyage
and so departed fro the hauyn and the city of Lissebone. And so long sailed
that he arrived at Plommoth / the same day / the same hour / and same tide
that therle of Buckyngham arrived and certain of his vessels / as they
returned fro Britayne. The englissheme^ had so sore fortune on y^ see / that
they lost.iii. of their ships charged with men and provision / and all his
flete was sprede abroad by a great storm of wynd and they arrived in great
peril in.iii. hauyns of England. Of the coming of this knight out of
Portingale therle of Buckyngham was right joyful and made him right good chere
/ and demanded of him tidings / and he showed him diverse things both of
Portyngale and of Spaygne. And so after they rode together till they came to
the good city of London / where the king of England was. When therle of
Buckyngha^ was come to Londu^ / they of y^ cite made him good chere / and than
he went to the king / who was at Westminster and his.ii. uncles with him / the duke
of Lancastre and the earl of Cakridge / and the knight of Portingale was in his
company. And when the king and the lords had knowledge of him / they made
great semblant of joy / and greatly honored him. He presented his letters to
the king / Who red them in the presence of his uncles. The king as tha^ did
no thing / but by the counsel of his uncles / for he was but young. Than the
knight was exammed because he brought letters of credence / and demanded the
cause of his coming out of Portingale into England. And he answered sagely /
and showed them all the matter as ye have hard before. And when the lords had
Well understand him / they answered / Saying in the kings name. We thank
our cosyn ye king of Portingale that he puts him self so foreward in our
besynes / in that he makes war against our adversary / and that he requires
is reasonable. Wherefore he shall hastily have aid / and the king shall take
advise how it shall be ordered. And so as than there were no mo Words. This
knight stranger for the love of these tidings yt he had brought pleasant to
the duke of Lancastre / and to the earl of Cambridge / he was feasted and dyned
with the king / and so tarried the space of.xv. days / till the vtas of saint
George / Where as ye king and his uncles were. And thither was comesyr Robert
of Namure to se the king and to make his relef for that he held of the king
in Inglande. Than was there the parliament and counsel assigned to be at
Westminster / I shall tell you why / as well for the besynes of Portingale the
which was a new matter / as for other for the truce was expired the first day
of June / and so there was a great counsel of the prelates and barons of
England / how they should order all these mats. And so they were in mind to
send the duke of Lancastre into Portingale / and some said / it was a far and
a long voyage to send him thither. And if he went / they might hap to
repent it / for they understood that the scotts made great apparel to enter
in to England. And sothan it was determined in their counsel / that the duke
of Lancastre / who knew well the marches of Scotland and the dealyng of the
scottis. And it was thought that they would sooner fall at a treaty with him /
rather than With any other great lord of all England / and how that the
scotts would do more for him than for any other. And how that the earl of
Cambrydge / with.v. C. spears and as many archers should goo in to Portingale.
And if that the duke of Lancastre could do somoche with the scotts with the
honor of the realm that a truce might be had to endure.iii. year than he
might well go into Portingale about the month of Auguste or Septembre / if the
king and his counsel thought it best / and so thereby to enforce the Army of
his brother. Also there was a another point / Wherefore the duke of Lancastre
went not out of England / Because the king of England had sent certain
messa^gers with the duke of Tasson and the Arche bysshopp^ of Rauenne to the
king of Almayne / to have his sister to wife / orelles to know how the matter
should stand. For there had be long treatye thereof more than the space of a
year. Of England there was the bishop of saint Dauys / and sir Symond Burle
to have a conclusion of this matier if they might. And so to this counsel
accorded the king and all the lords. And so the parliament brake up on this
point / and there were named and written the barons and knights that should
go in to Portyngale with the earl of Cambridge.

How the Earl of Cambrydge departed out of England to goo in to Portyngale.
And how the commons of England rebelled against the noble men. Cap. CCC.lxxxi.
THe duke of Lancastre ordered his busynes and departed fro the king and fro
his brethern^. And at his going he swear to his brother the earl of Cambrydge /
that at his returnyng out of Scotland he would order so his busynes yt he would
hastily follow him into Portyngale / if there were no great cause to let.
Thus the duke of Lancastre departed toward Scotland / but with his own men. And
at the same last parliament holden at London / it was ordained that ser Henry
Percy earl of Northu^berla^de should be wardeyn of all the land of
Northumberland / and of the bysshopriche of Duram / and fro thens into Wales to
the river of seuerne. And so he departed fro Lo^den to go to his charge / and
that was a xv. days after that the duke of Lancastre was departed. Also tha^
departed fro the king and fro therle of Buckyngham his brother the earl of
Cambrydge / to go toward his voyage in to Portyngale. And so made prouysion
about Ploumoth and vstayled his ships / and took with him his wife the lady
Isabell / and his sone John^. his intent was to bring them into Portingale /
the which he acco^plisshed. And with the earl of Cambrydge were these lords.
First the lord Mathue Gornay constable of the host / the lord Chanon Robsard /
the lord John^ of new castle / the lord Wyllm^ Beaucha^pe marshall of thost /
ye Souldic of Lestrade the lord of Barrere / the lord Chalebore / sir Willm^
Helmon / ser Thomassymon / Mylles wyndesore / sir John^ of Ca^derut and diverse
other / to the nombre of v. C. men of arms / and as many archers. So these
lords and their men came to Ploumoth and lodged there about / abiding for
wind. and little and little shypped all their stuff. but they took with them
no horses, because the way was far a sondre / between England and Lucebone
in Portingale. and ye Portingale knight was always still in their company.
And so they tarried there.iii. wekes abiding for wind / the which was contrary
to them. Ja the mean time the duke of Lancastre went toward Scotland / and so
came to the cite of Berwike the next town to Scotland of all England. And when
he was there he rested him / and sent an haralde of arms in to Scotland /
toward the barons there. showing them / how he was come thither to speak with
the^ on the marches / as the usage had been before. And if they would come and
treat with him to send him word / or else he knew right well what to do. The
harauld departed and rode to Edenbourg / where king Robert of Scotland / therle
Duglas / ye earl de la Marc / the earl Morette / and the other lords of
Scotland were assembled together. For they had knowledge how the duke of
Lancastre was coming thither to treat with them. wherefore they were assembled in
the chife town of Scotland ioynyng to the fronters of England. And there the
harauld did his message / and was well herd at length / and he had answer
that they were well content to here the duke speak. And so the harauld brought
a salueconduct for the duke and his company / to endure as long as he were in
the marches / and comuned together. Thus the harald returned to Berwyke / and
showed how hesped. And so the duke depted fro Berwyke / and left all his
provision behynd him in the town / and so went to Rosebourge and there lodgyd.
And the next day he went and lodged at the abbey of Mamos on the river. yt was
an abbey that departed England and Scotland a sundre. there the duke tarried and
his company / till the scotts were come to Monbanne.iii. little mile thens. and
when they were come thither / they sent word to the duke. Thus the treaty
began between ye Scotts and Englysshmen / the which endured a.xv. days. In
ye mean season while this treat was / there fell in England great myschife and
rebellion of mouyng of the common people. by which deed / England was at a point
to have been lost without recovery. There was never realm nor country in so
great aduentur / as it was in that time. and all because of the ease and riches
that the common people were of / which moved them to this rebellion / as
sometime they did in France / the which did much hurt. for by such incidentes
the realm of France has been greatly grieved.

IT was a marvelous thing and of poor foundation / that this myschife began
in England. And to give ensample to all manner of people / I will speak thereof
as it was don / as I was enfourmed / and of the incide^tes thereof. There was an
usage in England / and yet is in diverse countries / that the noble men has
great frau^ches over the commons / and keeps them in seruage. that is to say /
their tenau^tes ought by custom to labor the lords lands / to gather and
bring home their corns / and some to threshe and to fan. and by suage to
make their hey / and to heaw their wood and bring it home. all these things
they ought to do by seruage. And there be mo of these people in England / than
in any other realm. thus the noble men and prelates arre served by them / and
specially in the county of Bre^dpest / Sussetter / and Bedford. These unhappy
people of these said countries began to stir / because they said they were
kept in great seruage. And in the beginning of the world / they said there were
no bond men. Wherefore they maynteyned yt none ought to be bond / without he
did treason to his lord: as Lucifer did to god. But they said they could have
no such battle / for they were another angels nor spirittes: but men fourmed
to the similytude of their lords. sayng / why should they than be kept so under
like bestes? the which they said they would no lengar suffer / for they would be
all one. and if they labored or did any thing for their lords / they would have
wages therefore as well as other. And of this imaginacion was a folisshe priest in
the cou^tie of Rent / called Johan Wall / for the which folysshe words he had been three times in the bishop of Canterburies prison. For this priest used
often times on the sondayes after mass / when the people were going out of
the mynster to go in to the cloister and preche: and made the people to
assemble a dout him / and would say thus. Aye good people the matters gothe not
well to pass in England / nor shall not do till every thing be common. and
that there be no villayns nor gentylmen but that we may be all united toguyder.
and that the lords be no greatter masters than we be. What have we deserved:
or why should we be kept thus in seruage? We be all come fro one father and one
mother / Adam and Eve. Whereby can they say or show / that they be gretter
lords than we be? saving by that they cause us to win and labor / for that
they dispende. they are clothed in Ueluet and chamlet furred with grise / and
we be vestured with poreclothe. they have their wynes / spyces / and good
breed: and we have the drawyngout of the chafe / and drink water. They dwell
in sayre houses / and we have the pain and traueyle / rain and wind in the
feldes. And by that / that comes of our labors, they keep and maynteyne their
estates. We be called their bondmen / and without we do redilye them service /
we be beaten. And we have no seuerayne to whom we may compain / nor that will
here us / nor do us right. Let us go to the king / he is young: and show him
what seruage we be in. and show him how we will have it otherwise. or else we
will provide us of some remedy. And if we go together / all manner of people that
be now in any bondage will follow us / to thentent to be made fre. And when
the king seyth us / we shall have some remedy / outher by fayrnesse or
otherwise. Thus John^ Wall said on sondayes* when the people issued out of the
churches in the vyllages. Wherefore many of the mean people loved him / and
such as intended to no goodness said / how he said troth. and so they
would murmr one with another in the feldes and in the ways / as they went
together. Affermyng / how Johan Wall said truth. The archebysshoppe of
Canterbury / who was informed of the saying of this John^ Wall / caused him to
be taken and put in prison / a two or three months to chastise him. Howbeit /
it had been much better at the beginning / that he had been condemned to
perpetual prison / or else to have dyed. rather than to have suffered him to
have been again delivered out of prisone / but the bishop had conscience to
let him dye. And when this Johan Wall was out of prison he returned again to
his error / as he did before. Of his words and deeds there were much people
in London informed / such as had great envy at them that were rich / and
such as were noble. And than they began to speak among them and said. How
the realm of England was right evil governed / and how that gold and silver
was taken fro the^ / by them that were named noble men. So thus these unhappy
men of London began to rebel and assembled the^ together / and sent word to
the foresaid countries / that they should come to London / and bring their
people with them. Promisyng them / how they should find London open to
receive them / and the commons of the city to be of the same acorde. saying /
how they would do so much to the king / that there should not be one bondsman
in all England.

THis promise moved so them of Kent / of Essex / of Sussex / of Bedforde / and
of of the countries about / that they rose and came toward London / to the
nombre of. l^. thousand. And they had a captain / called Water Tyler / and
with him in company was Jaques Straw and Johan Balle. These three were chief
soueraygne capitayns / but the heed of all was Water Tyler / and he was in deed
a tyler of houses / an ungracious patron. When these unhappy men began thus to
styre / they of London / except such as were of their band / were greatly
afraid. Than the mayre of London and the rich men of the city / took
counsel together. And when they saw the people thus coming on every side /
they caused the gates of the cite to be closed / and would suffer no man to
enter in to the city. But when they had well imagyned / they aduysed not so
to do. For they thought they should thereby / put their subbarbes in great
parell to be brent. And so they opened again the city / and there entered in
at the gates / In some place a hundred / two hundred / bytwentie / and by.xxx.
And so when they came to London they entered and lodged. And yet of truth /
the third part of these people / could not tell what to ask or demand /
but followed each other like beestes / as ye shepherdes did of old time.
Saying / how they would go conquer the holy land / and at last all came to
nothing. In likewise these villayns and poor people came to London a hundred
mile of.lx. mile.l. mile.xl. mile / and.xx. mile of / and fro all countries
about London. but the most part ca^e fro the countries beforenamed / and as
they came / they demanded ever for the king. The gentylmen of the countries
knights and squyers began to doubt / when they saw the people began to rebel
/ and though they were in dout / it was good reason. For a less occasyon /
they might have been afraid. So the gentylmen drew toguyder as well as they
might. The same day that these unhappy people of Kent were coming to London /
there returned fro Canterbury the kings mother princes of Wales / coming
from her pylgrimage. She was in great ieopardy to have been lost / for these
people came to her chare and dealt rudely with her. Whereof the good lady was in
great doubt / lest they would have done some vilany to her / or to her
damsels. How be it god kept her / and she came in one day fro Caunterbury to
London / for she never durst tarry by the way. The same time king Richard her
son was at the tower of London. There his mother found him / and with him
there was the earl of Salisbury / the archebysshoppe of Caunterbury / sir
Robert of Namure / the lord of Gomegines / and diverse other. Who were in dout
of these people yt thus gadered toguyder / and wist not what they demanded.
This rebellyon was well known in the kings court / or any of these people
began to styre out of their houses. But the king nor his counsel did provide
no remedy therefore / which was great marueyle. And to thentent that all lords
and good people / and such as would nothing but good / should take ensample to
correct them that be yuell and rebellions. I shall show you plainly / all the
matter as it was.

The yuell deeds that these come^s of England did to the kings officers /
and how they sent a knight to speak with the king. Ca. C C C lxxxii.
THe monday before the feast of Corpus Christy. the year of our lord god a
thousand three hundred.lxxxvii. these people issued out of their houses / to
come to London to speak with the king to be made fre / for they would have had
no bo^de man in England. and so first they ca^e to saint Thomas of
Caunterbury. And there Johan Balle had thought to have found the bishop of
Canterbury / but he was at London with the king. When Wat Tyler and Jacke
Straw entered in to Canterbury / all the common people made great feast / for
all the town was of their assent. And there they took counsel to go to
London to the king / and to send some of their company over the river of
Thames / in to Essexe in to Sussexe / and in to the counties of Stafforde and
Bedford / to speak to the people / that they should all come to the farther side
of London / and thereby to close London round about so that the king should
not stop their passages / and that they should all mete toguyder on Corpus
christy day. They that were at Caunterbury entered into saint Thom^s church and
did there much hurt / and robbed and brake up the bysshoppes chamber. And in
robbynge and bearing out their pyllage they said. A this chau^celler of
England / has had a good market to get toguyder all this richesse. He shall
give us now account of the revenues of England / and of the great profytes
that he has gathered sithe the kings coronacyon. When they had this monday
thus broken the abbey of saint Uyncent / they deperted in the morning and all
the people of Canterbury with them: and so took the way to Rochester / and
send their people to the vyllages about. And in their going they beat down
and robbed houses of advocates / and procurers of the kings court / and of
the archebysshoppe / and had mercy of none. And when they were come to
Rochester / they had there good chere / for the people of ye town tarried for
them / for they were of the same sec^e. and than they went to the castle there
/ and took the knight that had the rule thereof / he was called sir Johan Moton:
and they said to him. Sir / it behooves you to go with us / and you shall be
our sovereign captain / and to do that we will have you. The knight excused
himself honestly / and showed them diverse consyderacions and excuses / but all
auayled him nothing / for they said unto him. Sir Johan / if ye do not as we
will have you / ye are but deed. The knight seeing these people in that fury /
and redye to slay him. He than douted death and agreed to the^ / and so they
took him with them against his inward will. And in likewise did they of other
countries in England / as Essexe / Sussexe / Stafforde / Bedforde / and
Warwyke / even to Lyncolne. For they brought the knights and gentylmen into
such obeisance / that they cansed them to go with them wheder they would or
not / as the lord Molayne a great barone / sir Stephyne of Hales / and sir
Thomas of Guysighen and other.

Now behold the great fortune. If they might have come to their ententes /
they would have distroyed all the noble men of England. And thereafter all
other nacyons would have followed the same / and have taken foot and ensample by
them / and by them of Gaunte and Flaunders / who rebelled against their lord.
The same year / the parisyens rebelled in likewise / and found out the
mallettes of iron / of whom there were mo than.xx. thousand / as ye shall
herafter in this history: but first we will speak of them of England.

When these people thus lodged at Rochester deperted and passed y^ river and
came to Bra^forde / always keeping still their opynions / beatyng down before
the^ / and all about / the places and houses of advocates and procurers / and
strikyng of the heedes of diverse persons. and so long they went forward / till
they came within a four mile of London / and there lodged on a hill / called
Blacheth: and as they went they said ever / they were the kings men and the
noble commons of England. and when they of London knew / that they were come
so nere to them. The mayre (as ye have herd before) closed the gates / and
kept straitely all the passages. This order caused the mayre / who was called
Nicholas Walworthe: and diverse other rich burgesses of the cite / who were not
of their sect. But there were in London of their unhappy opinyons / mo than.xxx.
thousand. Than these people thus being lodged on Blacheth / determined to
send their knight to speak with the king. And to show him how all that they
have done or will do / is for him and his honor. And how the realm of
England has not ben well governed a greet space / for the honor of the
realm / nor for the common profit / by his uncles and by the clergy. And
specially by the archebysshop of Caunterbury his chau^celler / whereof they
would have account. This knight durst do none otherwise / but so came by the
river of Thames to the tower. The king and they that were with him in the
tower / desiring to here tidings / seeing this knight coming / made him way
and was brought before the king in to a chamber. And with the king was the
princess his mother and his two brethren / therle of Kent and the lord John^
Holland / the earl of Salisburye / the earl of Warwyke / the earl of Oxenforthe
/ the archebysshop of Caunterbury / the lord of saint Johans / ser Robert of
Namure / y^ lord of Uertaigne / the lord of Gomegynes / sir Henry of
Sauselles / the mayre of London / and diverse other notable burgesses. This
knight sir Johan Moton who was well known among the^ / for he was one of the
kings officers. He kneled down before the king and said. My right redouted
lord / let it not displease your grace / the message that I must needs show
you. For dear sir it is byforce and against my will. Sir John^ said the king /
say what ye will I hold you excused. Sir / the commons of this your realm
has sent me to you / to desire you to come and speak with them on Blacheth /
for they desire to have none but you. And sir / ye need not to have any dout of
your person / for they will do you no hurt / for they hold and will hold
you for their king. But sir / they say they will show you diverse things /
the which shall be right necessary for you to take heed of / when they
speak with you. Of the which things sir / I have no charge to show you. But
sir / and it may please you to give me an answer such as may apease the^ / and
that they may know for troth that I have spoken with you / for they have my
children in hostage / till I return again to them. And without I return
again / they will slay my children incontinent. Thasie the king made him an
answer and said. Sir / ye shall have an answer shortly. Than the king took
counsel what was best for him to do. and it was anon determined / yt the
next morning the king should go down the river by water and without fail to
speak with the^. And when sir Johan Moton herd that answer / he desired
nothing else. And so took his leave of the king and of the lords / and
returned again in to his vessel and passed the Thames and went to Blackeheth
/ where he had left mo than threscore thousand men. and there he answered the^
that the next morning they should send some of their counsel to the Thames
/ and there the king would come and speak with them. This answer greatly
pleased them / and so passed that night as well as they might. And y^ fourth
part of them fasted for lack of vitayle / for they had none. Wherewith they
were sore displeased / which was good reason.

ALl this season therle of Buckynghame was in Wales / for there he had fair
herytages by reason of his wife / who was daughter to y^ earl of
Northu^berlande and Herforde / but the voice was all through London / how he
was among these people. And some said certaynlye / how they had seen him
there among them. And all was / because there was one Thomas in their company
/ a man of the county of Cambridge / that was very like the earl. Also the
lords that lay at Plummouth to go in to Portyngale / were well infourmed of
this rebellyon / and of the people that thus began to rise. Wherefore they
douted lest their vyage should have been broken / or else they feared lest the
commons about Hampton / Wynchestre / and Aru^dell / would have come on them.
Wherefore they wayed up their ancres and issued out of the hauyn with great
pain / for the wind was sore against them / and so took thesee / and there
cast ancre abiding for the wind. and the duke of Lancastre / who was in the
marches of Scotland / between Morlane and Roseburg entreatyng with the scotts
/ where it was showed him of the rebellyon / Whereof he was in doubt. For he
knew well he was but little beloved with the comens of England. How be it
for all those tidings / yet he did sagely demeans him self / as touching
the treaty with the scotts. The earl Duglas / therle of Moret / the earl of
Surlant / and therle Thomas Uer say: and the scotes that were there for the
treaty. knew right well y^ rebelly on in England how the comen people in
every part began to rebel against the noble men. wherefore the scotts thought
that England was in great danger to be lost. and therefore in their treaties
they were the more styffer again the duke of Lancastre and his counsel. Now
let us speak of the commons of England / and how they perceyuered.

How the commons of England entered in to London / and of the great yuell that
they did. and of the death of the bishop of Canterbury / and diverse other.
Cap. CCClxxxiii.
IN the morning on corpus christy day king Richard herd Mass in the tower
of London / and all his lords. and than he took his barge / with therle of
Salisbury / therle of Warwyke / y^ earl of Suffolk and certain knights. and
so rowed down a long Thames to Redereth / where as was disce^ded down the
hill a.x. M. men / to se y^ king / and to speak with him. And when they saw
the kings barge coming / they began to showt / and made such a cry: as
though all the deuylles of hell had been among them. and they had brought with
them sir Johan Moton to the intent that if the king had not come / they would
have stryken him all to pieces: and so they had promised him. And when the king
and his lords saw the demeanor of the people. The best assured of them were
in dread. And so the king was counsayled by his barownes not to take any
landynge there / but so rowed up and down the river. And the king demanded of
them what they would / and said. how he was come thither to speak with them.
And they said all with one voice. we would that ye should come a land / and
than we shall show you what we lack. Than the earl of Salisbury answered for
the king and said. Sirs / ye be not in such order nor array / that the king
ought to speak with you. And so with those words no more said. And than the
king was counsayled to return again to the tower of London: and so he did.
And when these people saw that / they were enflamed with ire / and returned
to the hill / where the great band was. And there showed the^ what answer they
had / and how the king was returned to the tower of London. Than they cried
all with one voice. Let us go to London / and so they took their way thither.
And in their going / they beat down abbeyes and houses of advocates / and of
men of the court and so came in to the subbarbes of London / which were great
and fair / and there beat down diverse fair houses. And specially they brake
up the kings prisones / as the Marshalse and other / and delivered out all the
prisoners that were within: and there they did much hurt. And at the bridge
foot they thret them of London / because the gates of the bridge were closed.
Saying / how they would brenne all the subarbes / and so co^quere London
byforce: and to slay and brenne all the commons of the city. There were many
within the city of their accord / and so they drew toguyder / and said. Why
do we not let these good people enter in to ye cite / they are our fellows: and
that that they do is for us. So therewith the gates were opyned / and than these
people entered in to the city and went in to houses / and satte down to eat
and drink. They desired nothing but it was incontinent brought to them / for
every manne was ready to make the^ good chere: and to give them meat and drink
to apease them. Than the capitayns: as John^ Ball / Jacke Straw and Watte
Tyler went through out London / and a twenty thousand with them. and so ca^e
to the Sauoy / in the way to Westmynster / which was a goodlye house / and it
perteyned to the duke of Lancastre. and when they entered / they slew the
kepars thereof / and robbed and pylled the house. And wha^ they had so done /
than they set fire on it / and clean distroyed and brent it. and when they
had done that outrage / they left not therewith / but went straight to the fair
hospytalle of the Rodes / called saint Johans. and there they burnt house /
hospytall / mynster and all. Than they went fro street to street / and slew
all the flemmynges that they could find / in church or in any other place /
there was none respyted fro death. and they brake up diverse houses of the
lombardes and robbed them / and took their goods at their pleasure: For there
was none that durst say them nay. And they slew in the city a rich
merchant / called Richard Lion: to whom before that time / Watte Tyler had
done service in France. And on a time this Richard Lion had beaten him while
he was his varlet. the which Watte Tyler than remembered / and so came to his
house and struck of his heed. and caused it to be borne on a spear point before
him all about the cite. Thus these ungracious people demeaned them self / like
people enraged and wode. and so that day they did much sorrow in London.

ANd so against night / they went to lodge at saint Katherins / before the
tower of London. Saying / how they would never depart thens / till they had
the king at their pleasure. And till he had accorded to them / all that they
would ask acomptes / of the chau^cellour of England. to know where all the
good was become / that he had leuyed through the realm. and without he made a
good acompte to them thereof / it should not before his profit. And so when
they had done all these yuels to the strangers all the day / at night they
lodged before the tower.

YE may well know and believe / that it was great pytie / for the danger that
the king / and such as were with him were in. Forsome time these unhappy
people showTed and cried so loud / as though all the deuylles of hell had
been among them. In this euennynge / the king was counsayled by his brethren
and lords / and by sir Nicholas walworthe mayre of London / and diverse other
no table and rich burgesses. that in ye night time they should issue out of
the tower and enter into the cite / and so to slay all these unhappy people /
while they were at their rest and a sleep. For it was thought that many of them
were dronken / whereby they should be slain like flees. Also of twenty of them
/ there was scant one in harnes. And surely the good men of London might well
have done this at their ease / for they had in their houses secretly / their
friends and servants ready in harness. And also sir Robert Canolle was in his
lodgyng keeping his treasure / with a sixscore ready at his commandment / In
likewise was sir Perducas Dalbret / who was as than in London. In so much that
there might well assembled toguyder / an eight thousand men ready in harness.
How beit there was nothing done / for the resydue of the commons of the city
were sore douted / leest they should rise also. and the commons before were a
threscore thousand or mo. Than the earl of Salisbury and the wise men about
the king said. Sir / if ye can apese them with fayrnesse / it were best and
most profitable / and to grant them every thing that they desire. For if we
should begin a thing / the which we could not atcheue / we should never
recover it again. But we and our heirs ever to be disheyrited. So this
counsel was taken / and the mayre countermaunded. And so commanded that he
should not stir. And he did as he was commanded / as reason was. And in the
city with the mayre there were.xii. aldermen / whereof nine of them held with
the king / and the other three took part with these ungracious people / as it
was after well known / the which they full derely bought.

ANd on the friday in the morning / the people being at saint Katheryns / nere
to the tower. Began to apparel them self / and to cry and shoute / and said.
Without the king would come out and speak with them / they would assail the
tower / and take it byforce / and slay all them that were within. Than the king
douted these words / and so was counseled that he should issue out to speak
with the^. And than the king send to them / that they should all draw to a
fair plain place / called Myleende / where as the people of the city did
sport them in the somer season. And there the king to grant the^ that they
desired. And there it was cried in the kings name / that who soever would
speak with the king / let him go to the said place / and there he should not
fail to find the king. Than the people began to depart / specially the
commons of the vyllages / and went to the same place / but all went not thither.
for they were not all of one condycion. For there were some that desired
nothing but richesse / and the utter destruction of the noble men / and to
have London robbed and pylled. That was the princypall matter of their
beginning / the which they well showed. For as soon as the tower gate opyned
/ and that the king was issued out with his two brethren / and the earl of
Salisbury / the earl of Warwike the earl of Oxenforthe / sir Robert of Namure /
the lord of Bretaygne / the lord Gomegynes / and diverse other. Than Watte
Tyler / Jacke Straw / and Johan Ball / and mo than four hundred entered into
the tower / and brake up chamber after chamber / and at last found the
archebysshoppe of Caunterbury / called Simon / a valyant man and a wise / and
chief chaunceller of England. and a little before / he had said mass before
the king. These Glottons took him and struck of his heed. and also they
beheded the lord of saint Johans / and a friar mynour master in medicyn /
perteyning to the duke of Lancastre / they slew him in dispyte of his master.
and a sergeant at arms / called John^ Laige. And these four heedes were set on
four logn spears / and they made the^ to be borne before the^ / through the
streets of London. And at last set the^ a high on London bridge / as though
they had been traitors to the king / and to the realm. Also these glottous
entered in to the prices chamber and brake herhed / whereby she was so sore
afraid / that she sowned. and there she was taken up and borne to the watersyde
/ and put in to a barge and covered / and so conveyed to a place called the
queen's Warderobe. And there she was all that day and night / like a woman
half deed: till she was conforted with ye king her son / as ye shall here
after.

How the nobles of England were in great paryll to have been dystroyed. and how
these rebels were punisshed and send home to their own houses. Cap.
CCC.lxxxiiii.
When the king came to the said place of Myleende without London / he put out
of his company his two brethren / the earl of Kent and sir Johan Holande / and
the lord of Gomegynes: for they durst not apere before ye people. And when the
king and his other lords were there ^he found there a threscore thousand men
/ of diverse vyllages / and of sondrie countries in England. So the king
entered in among them / and said to them swetely. A ye good people / I am your
king. What lack ye? What will ye say? Than such as understood him said. We
will that ye make us free for ever / our self / our heirs / and our lands:
and that we be called no more bo^de nor so reputed. Sirs said the king / I am
well agreed thereto. Withdraw you home into your own houses / and into such
villages as ye ca^e fro / and leave behind you of every vyllage.ii. or three.
and I shall cause writings to be made and seal them with my seal / the
which they shall have with them / containing every thing that ye demand.
And to thentent that ye shall be the better assured / I shall cause my baners to
be delivered in to every Bayliwyke / shyre / and countries. These words
apeased well the common people / such as were simple and good plain men /
that were come thither and wyste not why. They said it was well said / we desire
no better. Thus these people began to be apeased / and began to withdraw
them in to the cite of London. And the king also said a word the which
greatly contented them. He said: Sirs / among you good men of Kent. ye shall
have one of my baners with you / and ye of Essexe another / and ye of Sussexe /
of Bedforde / of Ca^bridge / of Germeney / of Stafforde / and of Lyneche of you
one. And also I pardon every thing that ye have done hyder to / so that ye
follow my baners / and return home to your houses. They all answered how they
would so do. thus these people departed and went in to London. Than the king
ordained mo than.xxx. clerks the same fridaye to write with all dilyge^ce /
letter patentes / and sailed with the kings seal and delivered them to these
people. And when they had received the writynge / they departed and returned
in to their own countries / but the great venym remained still behind. For
Watte Tyler / Jacke Straw / and John^ ball said / for all that these people
were thus apesed. yet they would not depart so / and they had of their acorde
/ mo than.xxx. thousand. So they abode still / and made no prese to have the
kings writing nor seal / for all their ente^tes was to put the city to
trouble / in such wise: as to (...) all the rich and honest persons / and to
rob and pylle their houses. They of London were in great fear of this /
wherefore they kept their houses preuily with their fre^des / and such
servants as they had / every man according to his puyssaunce. And whan^e
these said people were this fridaye thus somewhat apeased / and that they
should depart as soon as they had their writings / every manne home in to
his own^ country. Than king Richard came in to the Royal / where the queen
his Mother was ^^ght sore afraid. So he comforted her as well as he could /
and tarried there with her all that night.

YEt I shall show you of an adventure that fell by these ungracious people /
before the cite of Norwiche / by a captain among them: called Guillyam Lystre
of Stufforde.

THe same day of Corpus Christy / that these people entered in to London and
brent the duke of Lancasters house / called the Sauoye: and the Hospytall of
saint Johannes / and brake up the kings prisons. And did all this hurt (as ye
have herd before) The same time there assembled toguyder: they of Stafforde /
of Lynne / of Cambridge / of Bedforde / and of Germeney. And as they were
coming toward London / they had a captain among them / called Lystre.
And as they came they rested them before Norwiche. and in their coming / they
caused every man to rise with them / so that they left no villayns behind
the^. The cause why they rested before Norwyche / I shall show you. There was
a knight captain of the town / called sir Robert Sale. He was no gentylman
borne / but he had the grace to be reputed sage / and valyant in arms. And for
his valiantness / king Edward made him knight. He was of his body / one of
ye biggest knights in all England.

Lyster and his company thought to have had this knight with them / and to make
him their chife captain / to the entente to be the more feared and beloved.
So they send to him / that he should come and speak with the^ in the field /
or else they would brenne y^ town. The knight considered / that it was better
for him to go and speak with the^ / rather than^e they should do that outrage
to the town. than he mounted on his horse and issued out of the town all
alone / and so came to speak with the^. And when they saw him / they made him
great chere and honored him much. desyring him to a light of his horse and to
speak with them / and so he did / wherein he did great folly. For whan^e he
was a lyghted / they came round about him / and began to speak fair to him
and said. Sir Robert / ye are a knight and a man greatly beloved in this
country / and renowned a valiant man. And though ye be thus / yet we know
you well: ye be no gentylmanne borne / but son to a villayne such as we be.
Therefore come you with us and be our master / and we shall make you so great a
lord / that one quarter of England shall be under your obeysau^ce. When the
knight herd them speak thus it was greatly contraryous to his mind / for he
thought never to make any such bargayne / and answered them with a felonous
regard. Fly away ye ungracious people / false and yuell traitors that ye be.
Would you yt I should forsake my natural lord / for such a company of knaves
as ye be / to my dishonor for ever. I had rather ye were all hanged as ye
shall be: for that shall be your end. And with those words he had thought to
have lepte again upon his horse / but he failed of y^ styrroppe: and the horse
sterted away. Than they cried all at him and said / slay him without mercy.
When he herd those words / he let his horse go and drue out a good sword /
and began to scrimysshe with them / and made a great place about him / that it
was pleasur to behold him. There was non that durst aproche nere him. There were
some that aproched nere him / but at every stroke yt he gave / he cut of
outher leg heed / or arm. There was none so hardye but that they feared him.
He did there such deeds of arms / that it was marueyle to regard / but there
were mo than forty thousand of these unhappy people. they shot and cast at
him / and he was unarmed. To say truth / if he had been of iron or stele /
yet he must needs have been slain. But yet or he dyed he slew.xii. out of
hand / beside them that he hurt. Finally he was stryken to the earth / and
they cut of his arms and legs / and than struck his body all to pieces.

This was the end of ser Robert Salle / which was great dommage. For which
deed afterward all the knights and squyers of England were angry and sore
displeased wha^ they hard thereof. Now let us return to the king.

THe saturday / the king departed fro the Warderobe in the Royal / and went
to Westmynster and hard mass in the church there / and all his lords with
him. And beside the church there was a little chapel with an image of our lady
/ which did great miracles / and in whom the kings of England had ever great
trust and confydence. The king made his orisons before this Image / and did
there his offryng. And than he lepte on his horse and all his lords / and so
the king rode toward London. And when he had ryden a little way on the lift
hand there was a way to pass without London. The same propre morning Watte
Tyler / Jacke Straw / and John^ Ball had assembled their company to common to
gether / in a place called Smythfelde / where as every friday there is a
markette of horses. And there were together / all of affinite / mo than.xx.
thousand / and yet there were many still in the town / drinking and making
merry in the tauernes / and paid nothing. For they were happy that made them
best chere. And these people in Smythfelde / had with them the kings baners
/ the which were delivered them the day before. And all these glottons were
in mind to ouerrenne and to rob London the same day / for their capitaynes
said / how they had done nothing as yet. these lyberties that the king has
given us / is to us but a small profitte. Therefore let us be all of one
accord / and let us ouerrenne this rich and puyssaunt city or they of
Essex / of Sussex / of Cambrydge / of Bedforde of Arundell / of Warwyke / of
Reedynge / of Oxenforde / of Guylforde / of Linne / of Stafforde / of Germeney
/ of Lyncolne / of york / and of Duram do come hither / for all these will
come hither. Wallyor and Lyster will bring them hither. And if we be first
lords of London / and have the possession of the riches that is therein / We
shall not repent us. For if we leave it / they that come after will have it fro
us. To this counsel they all agreed. And therewith the king came the same
way unware of them. For he had thought to have passed that way without
London / and with him a.xl. horse. And when he came before the abbaye of saint
Bartilmeus / and beheld all these people. than the king rested and said /
how he would go no farther / till he knew what these people ayled. saying /
if they were in any trouble how he would repease them again. The lords that
were with him tarried also / as reason was wha^ they saw the king tarry. And
when Watte Tyler saw the king tarry / he said to his people. Syrs / yonder is
the king / I will go and speak with him / styre not fro hence / without I make
you a sign. and when I make you yt sign / come on / and slay all them /
except the king / but do the king no hurt / he is young we shall do with
him as we list / and shall lead him with us all about England / and so shall
we be lords of all the royalme without doubt. And there was a dowblette maker
of London / called John^ Tycle / and he had brought to these Glotons a.lx.
doublettes / the which they ware. than he demanded of these capitaynes who
should pay him for his doublettes / he demanded.xxx. mark. Watte Tyler
answered him and said. Friend appease yourselfe / thou shalt be well paid or
this day be ended / keep the nere me / I shall be thy credytour. And there with
he spurred his horse / and departed fro his company / and came to the king /
so nere him that his horse heed touched ye crope of the kings horse. and the
first word that he said was this / Sir king / see thou all yo^der people?
ye truly said the king / Wherefore say thou? Because (said he) they be all
at my commandment / and have sworn to me faith and troth to do all that I
will have them. In a good time said the king / I will well it be so. Than
Watte Tyler said / as he that no thing demanded but riot. What beleuest thou
king that these people and as many mo as be in London at my commandment /
that they will deperte from the thus / without having thy letters. No said
the king / ye shall have them / they be ordained for you / and shall be
delivered every one each after other. Wherefore good fellows withdraw fair and
easily to your people and cause them to deperte out of London / for it is our
intent that each of you by villages and towneshippes shall have letters
patentes / as I have promised you. With those words Watte Tyler cast his eyes
on a squire / that was there with the king / bearing the kings sword. and
Wat Tyler hated greatly the same squire. for the same squier had displeased
him before / for words between them. What said Tyler / art thou there /
give me thy dagger. Nay said the squier that will I not do. Wherefore should I
give it the? The king beheld the squire / and said give it him / let him
have it. And so the squire took it him sore against his will. And when this
Watte Tyler had it / he began to play therewith / and turned it in his hand:
and said again to the squire / give me also that sword. Nay said the
squire it is the kings sword / thou art not worthy to have it / for thou
art but a knave. And if there were no moo here but thou and I / thou durst
not speak those words / for as much gold in qua^tite as all yonder abbaye.
By my faith said Wat tyler / I shall never eat meat till I have thy heed.
And with those words the mayre of London came to the king with a.xii. horses
well armed under their cootes / and so he brake the prease / And saw and hard
how Watte Tyler demeaned him self / and said to him. Ha thou knave / how
art thou so hardy in the kings presence to speak such words. It is to much
for the so to do. Than the king began to chafe / and said to the mayre. Set
hands on him. And while the king said so / Tyler said to the mayre / A
goddesname / what have I said to displease the? yes truly quod the mayre /
thou false stynkynge knave / shall thou speak thus in the presence of the king
my natural lord? I commytte never to live / without thou shalt derely abye
it. And with those words the mayre drew out his sword and struck Tyler / so
great a stroke on the heed / that he fell down at the feet of his horse. And
as soon as he was fallen / they environed him all about / whereby he was not
seen of his company. Than a squire of the kings alyghted / called John^
Standysshe / and he drew out his sword and put it in to Watte Tylers belie /
and so he dyed. Than the ungracious people there assembled perceiving their
capytayne slain / began to mourmure among them self and said. A / our
captain is slain / let us go and slay them all. And therewith they araynged
them self on the place in manner of battle / and their bows before them.
Thus the king began a great outrage / how be it all turned to the best.
for as soon as Tyler was on the earth / the king departed from all his
company / and all alone he rode to these people / and said to his own men.
Syrs / none of you follow me / let me alone. And so when he came before these
ungracious people / who put them self in ordinance to revenge their
captain. Than the king said to them. Syrs / what ayleth you / ye shall
have no captain but me. I am your king / be all in rest and peace. And so
the most part of the people / that hard the king speak / and saw him
among them / were shamefast / and began to wax peasable / and to depart.
But some / such as were malicious and evil / would not depart / but made
semblant as though they would do somewhat. Tha^ the king returned to his own
company / and demanded of them what was best to be done. Than he was
cou^sailed to draw into the feld / for to fly away was no boot. Than said
the mayre / it is good that we do so. for I think surely we shall have
shortly some comfort of them of London / and of such good men as be of our
part / who are pourueyed / and have their fre^des and men ready armed in their
houses. And in this mean time voice and bruyte ran through London / how
these unhappy people were lykely to sle the king and the maire in Smythfelde.
Through the which noise / all manner of good men of the kings party / issued
out of their houses and lodgings / well armed / and so came all to Smythfelde
/ and to the field where the king was. And they were anon to the nombre
of.vii. or.viii. thousand men well armed. And first thither came sir Robert
Canoll / and ser Perducas Dalbret well accompanied / and diverse of the aldermen
of London / and with them a.vi. hundred men in harneys. And a pusant man of
the city / who was the kings draper / called Nicholas Member / and he brought
with him a great company. And ever as they came / they raynged them a foot in
order of bataylle. And on the other part these unhappy people were ready
raynged / making semblaunce to give battle / and they had with them diverse
of the kings baners. There the king made.iii. knights. The one the mayre of
London sir Nycholas walworthe / sir Johan Standysshe / and sir Nycholas Braule.
Than the lords said among them self / what shall we do? we se here our
enemies / who would gladly slay us / if they might have the better hand of
us. Sir Robert Canoll counsayled to go and fight with them / and slay them all.
yet the king would not consent thereto / butsayd. Nay / I will not so. I will
send to them / commaundynge them to send me again my baners / and thereby we
shall se what they will do. How be it outher by fayrnesse or otherwise / I will
have the^. that is well said sir quod therle of Salysbury. Than these new
knights were sent to them. And these knights made token to them / not to
shote at them. And when they came so nere the^ that their speech might be herd
/ they said. ss the king commands you to send to him again his baners /
and we think he will have mercy of you. And incontinent they delivered again
the baners / and sent them to the king. Also they were commanded on pain of
their heedes / that all such as had letters of the king to bring them forth /
and tosende them again to the king. And so many of them delivered their
letters / but not all. Than the king made them to be all to torn in their
presence. And as soon as the kings baners were delivered again / these
unhappy people kept none array / but the most part of them did cast down
their bows / and so brake their array / and returned in to London. Sir Robert
Canolle was sore dyspleased / in that he might not go to slay them all. But the
king would not consent thereto / but said he would be revenged of them well
enough / and so he was after.

THus these folysshe people departed / some one way and some a another. And the
king and his lords and all his company / right ordynately entered in to London
/ with great joy. And the first journey that the king made / he went to the
lady princess his mother / who was in a Castle in the Royal / called the
queen's wardrobe. And there she had tarried two days and two nights right
sore a basshed (as she had good reasone) And when she saw the king her son /
she was greatly reioysed / and said. A fair son / what pain and great
sorrow / that I have suffered for you this day. Than the king answered and
said. Certainly madame I know it well: but now rejoice your self and thank
god / for now it is time. I have this day recovered mine heritage and the
realm of England / the which I had nere lost. Thus the king tarried that
day with his mother / and every lord went peaseably to their own lodgings.
Than there was a cry made in every street in the kings name / that all manner
of men / not being of the city of London / and have not dwelt there the space
of one year / to depart. And if any such be found there the sunday by the
son risyng / yt they should be taken as traitors to the king and to lose
their heedes. This cry thus made / there was none that durst break it. And so
all manner of people departed and sparcled abroad every man to their own
places. Johan Balle and Jaques Straw / were found in an old house hydden /
thinkyng to have stolen away / but they could not. For they were accused by
their own men. Of the taking of them / the king and his lords were glad:
and thanne struck of their heedes / and watte Tylers also. and they were ser on
London bridge / and the valiant men's heedes taken down / that they had
set on the thursday before. These tidings anon spredde abroad / so that the
people of the strange countries / which were coming to wards London /
returned back again to their own houses / and durst come no farther.

How the duke of Lancastre kept him self still in Scotland / for fear of
this rebellyon. And how the king punysshed of these traitors / the chief
masters. Cap. CCC.lxxxv.
Now let us speak / how the duke of Lancastre in the mean season of this
rebellyon / was in the marchesse of Scotland / treatyng for a peace with
therle Duglas / and the other lords of Scotland. The Scotts knew right well
of this rebellyon in England / and in likewise so did the duke of Lancastre.
How be it he never made any semblant there ofto the scotts / but was as sore
in his treaty / as though England had been in good rest and peace. So long
this treaty was debated among them / that at last a truse was taken to endure
three yer between England and Scotland. and when this truse was thus accorded /
the lords of each part made good chere each to other. Than the earl Duglas
said to the duke of Lancaster. Sir we know right well of the rebellion of the
common people in England / and the parell that the realm of England is in by
that incide^ce. Sir we repute and take you for right sage and a valiant man
since ye have continued your treaty so freely / as ye have done / for ye would
never make any semblant thereof. Sir / we say to you yt we offer ourselfe yfye
have need / to be ready to aid you with.v. or.vi. C. speres / and to do you
service. by my faith said the duke. fair lords I thank you / I woll not
refuse your offer. how be it I think verily / that the king my lord has so
good counsel / that the matter shall right well come to pass. how be it I
desire you to have a salucconducte for me and mine to return in to your
country / if need be / till the matter be apeased. The earl Duglas and the earl
Moret who had the kings auctorite / granted him his desire / and so than thy
departed. The scotts returned to Edenbourge / and ye duke and his went to
Berwyk. wenyng to the duke to have entered in to the town / for when he passed
that way: there he left all his provision. but the capitane of the town /
called ser Mathue Redmayn / refused to him the enter / and closed the gates
against him and his. sayng how he was so comau^ded by the earl of
Northumberlande / who as than was princypall and soueraygne of all the marches
and frounters of Northumberlande. And when the duke herd those words he was
sore displeased and said. how so Mathue Redmayn. Is there in Northu^berlande a
gretter soueraygne than I am / that shall let me to pass this way / and left
all my prouisyon with you. what means these tidings? By my faith ser said
the knight. This is true that I say / and by the commandment of the king.
Sir this that I do to you is right sore against my will: how be it I must needs
do it. Therefore ser for goddessake hold me excused / for I am thus commanded
on pain of my life / that ye shall not enter in to this town / nor none of
yours.

yE may well know that ye duke of Lancaster had great marueyle / and was
sore displeased with these words / but not with the knight all only / but
with them that ordained that matter. seeing that he had traueyled for the
besynes of England / and than to have him in such suspecte. As to stop fro
him the first to wne between England and Scotland. And so imagyned greatly in
himself / and discovered not all that he thought in his courage. and so he
made no more prease on the knight / and thought well the knight would not so do
without some express commandment. and so brake out of that matter and said.
ser Red^ayn / have you any knowledge of ye tidings i^ England. ser said he I
know none / but that the country is sore meuyd. and the king our sovereign
lord has written to all the lords / knights / and good towns of this
country: to be all ready to come to him when soever he sendith for them. and all
co^stables and kepars of cities / towns / and castelles in Northumberland. he
has sent strayt commandment on pain of death / to suffer no man to enter in
to any place under their rules / and to take good head of their charge. And as
for the common people that rebelleth about London / I know no certain word of
the^. but that the officers of the bysshopryche of Lincoln / of Cambridge / of
Stafforde / of Bedford / and of Norwich / have written: how that ye common people
under them have great desire / that the matter should go evil. and that there
should be trouble in England. ya said the duke / what here you of our countries
of Lancastre / Derby / and Lynsetur. here you of any rebellion there? Sir said
the knight I here no thing yt they pass Lyncolne. Than the duke mused a little
and deperted fro the knight and took his way to Roseburge / and there he was
received of the constable / for when he passed he set him there. Then the duke
of Lancastre was cou^sayled / because he knew not surely how ye matters did in
England / nor of whom he was beloved nor hatyd. That he should send to the
lords of Scotland / desyring them to send a quantite of men of war to convey
him in to Scotland / with a saueconduct. And so thus he sent to the earl
Duglas / who lay as than at Alquest. and when the earl saw his lettre he had
great joy / and made great cher to the messa^ger. And sent word thereof to the
earl Moret / and to therle de la Mare his brother / desyring them incontinent
without any delay / to mete with him at Morlane the third day after / with a
certain nombre well horsed and aparellyd. As Soon as these lords knew this /
they sent for their men and friends / and so came to Morlan / and there they
found the earl Duglas / and so they rode all together / to the nombre of v. C.
speres / and came to the abbey of Mauros a.ix. little mile fro Roseburge. And on
the way they met the duke / and there they made great chere each to other. And
so long they rode together till they came to the cite of Edenbourge / where as
the king of scotts was. And for the most part ever the king lay there /
for there was a good castle / a big town / and a fair hauyn but as at that
time the king was not there. He was in the wild scottysshe. There the duke of
Lancastre was greatly honored of the Earl Duglas / and of the barownes of
Scotland. and the castle was delivered to the duke to lie in. And so there he
lay a season / till other tidings came to him out of England / but that was
not so soon as he would. Than it was marvel to regard the yuelles of these
unhappy people how in malice and hatered they spoke of this duke / without
cause. The voice and brute ran about in England / the time of this rebellyon /
How y^ the duke of Lancaster was a traitor to the king / and how he was
become scottysshe. but anon after it was found false and contrary. But these
ungracious people / to bring the realm into trouble sowed abroad these
words. and that they knowleged at ye hour / when they were executed to death.
That is to say: Lyster / Watte Tyler / Jacke Straw / Uaquyre / and Johan
Balle. These five were throughout all the realm chief and sovereign capitayns
/ for in five parts of the realm / they were masters and governors. And
specially they had in hatered the duke of Lancastre / and that they well
showed. For at their first entryng in to London / they brent his house of the
Sauoy / clean to the earth. And beside y^ / they had sprede abroad in England
by their false words / how the duke was of the scottysshe part. and in
diverse places they turned his arms up so down like a traitor the which was
after derely bought / for they that did it / lost their heedes for their
labor.

Now I shall show you the vengeance that the king of England took of these
ungracious people. In the mean season while the duke of Lancastre was in
Scotland.

When these people were repeased / and that Uaquyre was executed to death: and
Lystre of Stafforde / Watte Tyler / Jacke Straw / Johan Balle / and diverse
other at London. Than the king was cou^sayled to go visyte his realm / through
every shire bayliwyke / and vyllage: to pourge and punysshe all the said yuell
doers. And to get again all such letters as byforce / he had given the^ in
diverse places. and so to bring again his realm in good order. Than the king
sent secretly for a certain nombre of men of arms to come to him / at a day
appointed. and so they did / to the nombre of a five hundred spears and as
many archers. and when they were all come as the king had devised. The king
departed fro London with his housholdmen all only / and took the way in to
Kent / where as first these ungracious people began te stir. And these forsaid
men of war followed after the king / and costed him: but they rode not in his
company. The king entered in to Kent / and came to a vyllage called Comprimbre /
and called the mayre and all the men of the town before him. And when they
were all come in to a fair place / the king made to be showed them by one of
his counsel how they had erred against the king / and how they had nere
turned all England / to trybulacyon and to loss. And because that the king
knew well that this business was begone / by some of them and not by all.
Wherefore it were better that some did bear the blame than all. Therefore he
commanded them / that they should show what they were yt were culpable / on
pain to be for ever in the kings indygnacion / and to be reputed as traitors
against him. And when they that were there assembled herd that request / and
saw well that such as were culpable should excuse all the other. Than they
beheld each other / and at last said. Sir / behold him here / by whom this
town was first moved. in contynent he was taken and hanged / and so there were
hanged to the nombre of seuyn. and the letters that the king had given the^ /
were demanded again. and so they were delyuerd again and torn and broken
before all the people / and it was said to them all. Sirs / ye that be here
assembled: We command you in the kings name on pain of death / every man to
go home to his own house peasably / and never to grudge nor rise against the
king nor none of his officers. and this trespace that ye have done / the king
does pardon you thereof. Than they cried all with one voice: God thank the
kings grace and all his counsel.

IN like manner as the king did at Comprimbre: he did at Canterbury / at
Sa^dwyche / at Germeney / at Conculle / and in other places in Kent. In
likewise he did in all other places of his realm / where as any rebellyon had been. And there were hanged and beheeded / mo than fyftene hundred. Than the
king was cou^sayled to send for his uncle the duke of Lancastre out of
Scotland. so the king sent for him by a knight of his house / called sir
Nycholas Carnefell. The knight rode so long that he ca^e to Edenbroughe / and
there he found the duke and his company / and delivered his letters of
credence fro the king. The duke obeyed as it was reason / and also gladly he
would return in to England / to his own heritage. And so took his way to
come to Ros bourge, and at his departing he thanked the lords of Scotland /
of the conforte that they had done to him / as in susteyninge him in their
realm / as long as it pleased him. The earl Duglas / therle Moret / and other
of Scotland / brought him to the abbey of Maurose. Thus the duke came to Rose
bourge / and to Newcastell upon Tyne / and so to Dyrham and to york. and in
every place he found / cities and towns ready apparelled / as it was reason.
And the same season there dyed in London a knight / called sir Richard Dangle
earl of Hu^tyngdon / and master to the king. He was reverently buried in the
freres prechers in London. And on the day of his obsequy / there was the king
/ his two brethren / the princess his mother / and a great nombre of prelates
/ barownes / and ladies of England: and there did him great honor. And
truly this getyll knight was well worthy to have honor / for in his time he
had all noble virtues / that a knight ought to have. he was merry / true amorous
/ sage / secret / large / prewe / hardy / aduenturous / and chyualrous. Thus
ended the gentle knight sir Richard Dangle.

The yuell will that the duke of La^ castre conceived in his courage / For the
refuce that was made him at berwyke. And how the earl of Ca^brige arrived in
Portyngale. Cap. CCC.lxxxvi.
When the duke of Lancastre was returned out of Scotland into England / and
had showed to the counsel how he had spedde with the trewse / that he had
taken with the Scotts. He forgate not than / how sir Mathue Reedmane
captain of Berwyke / had closed the gates against him / by the strayte
commandment of the earl of Northumberlande. Than the duke enquered / if the
king his nephue would auoqe that deed or not / and so it seemed to him / that
the king did auowe it but faintly. So the duke held his pease / and abode
till the feast of our lady in the mids of the month of Auguste. At which
time the king held a sole^yne court at Westmynster / and there were than a
great no^bre of nobles and lords of England. there was the earl of
Northumberlande and the earl of Nottyngham / and diverse other lords of ye
north. And the king made knights the same day / the young earl of Penbroke and
sir Robert Maubre / sir Nycholas Twyforde and sir Adam Francoys. And after the
feast / the king was in purpose to ride to Reedyng / to Oxenforthe / and to
Couentre: to punysshe the yuell doers of the said rebellyon. And so he did /
in like manner as he had done in Kent / in Sussexe / in Essexe / in Bedforde /
and in Cambridge. At this feast of our lady at Westmynster after dinner / there
were great words between the duke of Lancastre and the earl of
Northumberlande. The duke said to him. Henry Percy / I believed not that ye
had been so great in England / as to close the gates of any city / town /
or castle / a gaynst the duke of Lancastre. The earl humyled him self in his
spekyng / and said. Sir / I deny not that the knight did / for I can not.
For by the strayt commandment of the kings grace here present. He straightly
enjoined and commanded me / that on mine honor and on my life / I should not
suffer any manner of person lord or other: to enter in to any city / town /
or castle in Northumberlande / without he were heryter of the place. Sir / the
king and the lords of his counsel can well excuse me. For they knew well
enough how ye were in Scotland / wherefore they should have reserved you.
What quod the duke / say you that there ought a reseruacyon to have been made
for me / who am uncle to the king. and have kept mine Heritage / as well or
better as any other has done / next to the king. And seeing / how I was gone
for the business of the realm in to Scotland. This excuse can not excuse you
/ but that ye have done yuell / and greatly against mine honor. And have
given thereby ensample / to bring me in suspect that I have done / or should do
some treason in Scotland. When at my retournyng / the kings towns be closed
against me: and specially there as my prouisyon was. Wherefore I say / ye have
aquyted yor self right yuell. And for the blame and sclaundre that ye have
brought me in / to pourge me. In the presens of ye king here present / I cast
against you here my gauge. Reise it and yedare. Than the king stepte forth and
said. Fair uncle of Lancaster / all that was done I auowe it. I must excuse
the Earl of Northumberlande / and speak for him. For on pain of his life / we
commanded him / that he should keep close all ye towns on the marchesse. and
ye know well / how our Realm was in great trouble and parell. The fault was
in the clerk that wrote the letters / and the negligence of our counsel.
For of truth / we should have reserved you. wherefore I will / and also desire
you: to lay a part this yuell will that ye have to the Earl. And I take the
charge on me / and discharge the earl in that behalf. Than kneled down before
the Duke: the earl of Arundell / the earl of Salisbury / the earl of Suffolk /
ye earl of Stafforde / and the Earl of Dymester / and said to him. Sir / ye
here how amyably and truly the king spekethe. Wherefore sir / ye ought to
condiscende to his pleasure. Well quod the duke / who was enflamed with ire: I
shall hold my peace. And so mused a little / and made the lords to rise / and
thanked them and said. Fair lords / there is none among you / if ye were in
like case as I am / but I am sure / ye would be sore displeased. But as it
pleases the king to have it / it is reason that I be content there with. So
there ye peace was made between the duke and the earl by means of the king
and the other lords. And the second day the king took his journey (as is said
before) and a five hundred spears and as many archers followed / and ever
costed the king in this vyage. The king did great justice on them that had
rebelled against him.

How let us leave to speak of the king of England / and speak of the earl
of Ca^bridge his uncle / and show how he did in Portyngale.

VE have well herdhere before / how therle of Cambridge lay in the hauyn of
Plummouthe / with a five hundred spears and as many archers / abydinge for the
wind / to sail into Portyngale. So long he lay there that at last wind and
wether came / and so disancred and departed toward Lysbone / where they
thought to arryue. And the first day / they costed England and Cornewayle. and
the.ii. day also. And the third day they entered in to the high see of
Spaygne / and there they had hard fortune. for there rose such a tempest /
that they and all their ships / were in great parell and hard adventure of
death. And specially the ships / wherein were the gascoyns. As sir Johan of
Newcastell / the Souldicke of Lestrade and the lord de la Barde / and a
forty knights and squyers. They lost the sight of the earl of Cambridge
flete. The earl / and sir Olyuete Beauchampe marshall of the host / and ser
Mathewe Gourney constable / and the Chanoyne Robersarde and the other / passed
this tempest in great danger. And so long they sailed by the wind and
stars / that they arrived at the city of Lysbone. These tidings came anon
to the king of Portyngale / who tarried and looked ever for the coming of these
englisshmen. Than the king send of his knights to mete them / and so they
were honorably received. And the king Dampferant came out of his castle / and
met with therle of Cambridge / and received him and all his with great
honor. And so brought the^ in to his castle / and called for wine and spyce.
And there was young Johan of Cambridge son to the earl: Of whom the king of
Portyngale made great joy and said. Behold here my son / for he shall have
my daughter: they were both proper and goodlye / and all of one age. These
children had great joy each of other / and held each other by the hand. In
the mean season while the king of Portyngale made cher to the earl and to the
other strangers / all their company were well lodged as they came out of
their ships / for the City of Lysbone was great and well furnysshed with
every thing / for it was well provided for / against the coming of the
englysshmenne. So these lords were merry and well at their ease: How be it
they were right sorry for their company / that they thought were lost on the sea / in the tempest. Or else driven into the danger of the moors in Granade.
the which if it were so / they thought them as good as lost / and so for them
they made great complayntes. and to say truth / they were well worthy to be
co^playned. for they were so sore tossed with the tempest / that there were
never men in greater danger of death / and escaped. They passed the straytes
and the bounds of the realm Tramesuynes and Bell maryne. And they were often
times in great adventure of taking with the sarazins / and they all counted
themself but lost and deed / and never had trust to come to land. And in this
great danger they were.xl. days. and than they had such a wind that brought
them / wheder they would or not / again in to ye spaynisshe see And when the
wind failed / than they ancred / and by adventure they found two great
ships / coming (as they said) fro Flanders / charged with marchaundyse / and
going to Lysbone. Than the English ship came to the^ / and purte out their
standerdes. and when they of Lysbone / who were but merchants / saw the
arms of saint George / and in the ship men of arms / they were half
afraid. But at last / when they aproched and saw who they were / they made
them great chere. And after these merchants did put these knights again
in great parell (as ye shall herafter)

THese knights demanded of these merchants what tidings / they answered
and said. How that the king of Portyngale with the english men were in
Spaigne / and had besieged the king of Castyle in Ciuyll. Of these tidings
the knights were right joyful / and said. how they would go thither / for
they were as than on the fronter of Ciuyll. And so they departed: and the
merchants left with them wine / and other prouysion / to refresshe them with
all. Than the gascoyns said to the maryners. Sirs / bring us straight to
Ciuyll for there our company lie at siege. The maryners said / in the name of
god: and so turned thyderwardes / and sailed so long / till they aproched
nere thereto. Than the maryners / who were wise and sage / and would not that
their masters should be lost neglygently. Caused a ladde to mount up to the
top of the ship / to se if he could spy any manner of siege laid to Ciuyll
outher by water or by land. and the ladde / who saw every thing parfitelye /
said. Surely there is no manner of siege / another by land nor by water. Than
the maryners said to the lords. Sirs / ye are not well and truly informed /
for surely there is no siege / another by land nor by water about Ciuyll. For if
there were any / it should apere in the hauyn. Therefore sirs / it is no going
thither / without ye will lose all. For the king of Castyle is there / as in
the city (wherein he would be) of any other in all his realm. So with great
pain these maryners might be believed / and at last they were be lened. And so
sailed a long the side of Civil: and entered in to the sea of Portyngale / and
at last arrived in the hauyn of Lysbone. Thesa^e hour and day / there was
done in the church of saint Katherine a solemn obsequy / for the^ and all
the english men: morenyng for them in black. But than ye may well know /
there was joy enough / whan^e they arrived at the port: and there was great
feast made. and these gascoyns for joy / forgate the pain and fear / that
they had endured in the sea.

'NOwe let us leave to speak of the business of Portingale / for there was as
yet no deed of arms done there. and let us now speak of the business that
was in Flaunders the same season.

IN this season while all this business was in England / the wars of
Fla^ders was not in rest / between the earl and the gauntoyse (ye have herd
here before) how Philyppe Dartuell was chosen as sovereign captain of Gaunt /
by the oppynyon of Peter de Boyse / who counsayled him to take on him the
office / and to be cruel. To the intent to be the more feared. Philyppe
followed after his scole and doctrine / for he had not been long in office /
when he caused.xii. heedes to be strykenne of before him. And some said / they
were those / that principally were causers of the death of his father. and so
than he revenged his cause. This Philyppe Dartuell began^e to raygne in great
puyssaunce / and was greatly feared and beloved / and specially of such as
followed war. And to win their favor and love / he spared nothing: but
abandoned every thing to them. It might be demanded how they of Gaunt made
their war? I will answer thereto / acordynge as I have herd. Of very
necessyte / according to their quantyties: they ever supported the poor. And
so by reason of the unity among them / they endured in great puyssaunce. And
all things consydred / Gaunt is one of the most stro^gest towns of the
world. So that Brabant / Holande and zelande / make them no war. But if
those three countries with Flaunders make war to them / than they be enclosed
and likely to be lost and famysshed. And these three countries made no war with
them / wherefore they endured the lengar. In this season / while that Philyppe
Dartuell was made new offycer. The alderman of the wayuers was accused of
trayson / and set in prison. And to prove the truth in that he was accused
/ they went to his house / and found there certain poudre of Saltpeter /
wherewith he had done no help to the town at siege / nor otherwise / of all
the hole year passed. Wherefore he was beheeded / and drawn through the town
like a traitor: to give ensample to all other. Than the earl of Flaunders
determined to lay siege to Gaunt / and so he made a great somons of lords /
knights / and squyers: and men of good towns. And he send to Malynes / from
whens he had much people. Also he send for his cosyns / sir Robert of Namure
and sir Wyllyam. and out of Arthoise there came much people to him. And the
countess of Arthoise his mother / was as than newely departed this life.

TO this assemble there ca^e the lord Da^piers / with a great company of
knights and squyers of the county of Heynalt. And so therie went and laid
siege to Gaunt / on the side toward Bruges and toward Heynalte. and while
this siege endured / there was many a scrymisshe / and sometime a sort of wight
companyons would issue out of Gau^t. Sometime they were driued home again to
their loss / and sometime they wan. And in this season he that did most
deeds of arms and was most renomed / was the young lord of Danghien. And
most commonly all lustye companyons / such as sought for deeds of arms /
would be ever in his company. And in this season / the lord of Danghien with
four thousand horse men beside footmen / went and laid siege before the
town of Grauntmont / the which as than was gau^toyse. Before that time / the
said lord had been there / and traueyled and haryed the^ sore: but nothing
conquered. But at this time / he came puissantly and in good order / and on a
so^ day he sauted the town / in mo than.xl. places. And was at the saute him
self / and set forth first his own baner. This was so great assaute and so
well co^tynued on every side / that about the hour of noone / it was taken and
conquered. And than entered in at ye gates / the lord of Da^ghien and his
company. And when they of the town saw / that their town was lost without
recovery / they fled out at the gates / where as none of their enemies were.
and so every man saved him self that might. There was great murdre / of men /
women / and children: for there was none taken to mercy. There were mo than v. C.
men of ye town slain / and a great no^bre of old people men and women brent
/ lyeng in their beds / which was great pytie. For they set fire in the
town / in mo than three hundred places / whereby the hole town was brent
churches and all: nothing left hole. Thus Grau^tmont was prosecuted and put to
fire and flame than the lord Danghien returned in to thost to the Earl of
Flaunders / who gave him great thank for his deed / and said. Fair son /
ye are a valyant man / and shall be if god be pleased a good knight / for
yehaue a good beginning.

AFter the distructyon thus of the town of Grauntmont / on a sunday / in the
monethe of June / while the siege lay stylle before Gaunt. This lord of
Da^ghien / called Water: would never lie in rest in his lodgyng / but every day
sought for adue^tures. Some day with a great no^bre and some day with so few
/ that he durst not parceyuer in his enterprise. So yt nere every day / there
was by him or by ye Hase of Flaunders / done some adventure. And so it fortuned
/ that on a tuesday in the morning / the lord Danghien was issued out of his
logyng and the lord of Montigny in his company / ser Mychell of Hamsede his
cosyn / and the bastard of Danghien his brother. Julyen of Toyson / Hutyn
Donay / and diverse other. They went to scrimisshe before Gaunt (as they were
wont to do) and adventured themself so far / that they took no good thereby.
For they of Gaunt had laid a sore busshment before their town / mo than a
hundred pykes. And some said there was in this busshme^t / such as had fled
fro grau^tmont: when it was won. Their entente was set on nothing else / but
how they might trap ye lord Da^ghien / to be revenged on him / for the damage
y^ he had done to them. They thought ever that he was free and hardy / and
would adventure him self largely. And as they thought so it came to pass /
which was more pity. The lord Danghien and his rout / took no head till they
were enclosed with the gauntoyse / who escryed them to death. Than the lord
Da^ghyen demanded counsel of the lord of Mo^tigny who was by him. Than sir
Eustace Mo^tigny answered / and said. It is now to late to take counsel. let
us defend our self / and sell our lives derely or we dye: there is none other
remedy. Than these knights made the sign of ye cross before them / and
reco^mended them self to god and to saint George. And so entered in among
their enemies / for they could not fly / they were so forward in the enbusshe.
And so there they did deeds of arms as well as they might: but they could not
long endure / for their enemies were a hundred against one. And a great nombre
of long pykes / wherewith the gau^toise gave great strokes and peryllous / as it
well apered. There was the lord Danghien slain / and by him his bastard
brother / and Gyles of Toyson / and diverse other valyant knights of Haynalte.
And the lord of Montigny saint Christophe / and sir Michell of Hamsede sore
hurt. And he had been slain without doubt / and Hutyn Donay / by force of
arms / had not saved him. And yet he had much pain to save him. How be it
/ in the mean time that the gau^tois were about to dysarme the knights that
they had slain / to the intent to bear them into the to wne of Gaunt. For
they knew well they had slain the lord Danghien / whereof they had great
joy. In the mean time / Hutyn Donay brought out of the prese and parell sir
Mychell Hamsede. Thus this journey fortuned against the lord Da^ghien. It is
not to be douted / but that the Earl of Flaunders had for his death great
sorrow / the which he well showed / because: for ye love of him he brake up
his siege before Gaunte. And night and day made great soro we for his death /
and said. O / Water Water my fayreson. What adventure is this? thus to fall on
you in your youth. I will that every man know / that they of Gaunte shall
never have peace with me / till I have so great amen des / that it shall
suffyce. Than the earl send to Gaunt / to have again the body of the lord of
Danghien / the which the gau^toyse would not deliver. Than the earl send them
a thousand frankes to have his body / the which the gauntoyse did depart
among themself. And so the body of the lord of Da^ghien was brought in to
the host / and so was sent to Anghien the town / whereof he was lord.

THus for the love of the young lord of Danghien / thesege brake up before
Gaunte. And than the earl departed and went to Bruges / and gave leave to all
his people to depart / and send a certain to his fortresses in Flaunders. As
Gaures / Andewarpe / Teremonde / and Curtray: and all about in the fortresses
nere to Gaunt. And the earl send to the legeoys / showing them / because the
yco^forted Gaunt with vitayle and other prouisyon: therefore he had broken up
his siege. Desyringe the^ / no more to comfort the^ with any vitayle. They of
Liege answered proudely: that they would be aduysed what they would do. Of them
of ^ayn ton / of Huy / and of Dygnet: therle could have none other answer. How
be it he sent to his cosyns / the duke of Braba^t / and the duke Aubert bailey
of Heynalte / of Holande / and of zelande: diverse messangers right sage
knights. and they to show him / how ye town of Gau^t / is still in their
error / by the occasyon of the great confort / that they of Gaunt has / by
their people and countries. In bringynge daily to them fresshe vitayle:
desyring the^ therefore / to provide for a r^medy. These two lords / who would
not gladlye do anythyng / to the displeasure of their cosyn the earl. Excused
them self honestly and said. how they knew nothing thereof before. But fro
thens forth they would look thereto / and set a good order. This answer was
suffycient to the Earl of Flaunders. The duke Aubert / who as than was in
Holande / wrote to his bailey in Heynalte / sir Symone de la Layne / and send
him the copy of the earls letters: and y^ request that the earl had made to
him. And beside that he commanded him / that he should so deal in the country
of Heynalt / that he here no more tidinges of displeasure / toward therle of
Fla^ders his cosyn. For if he did / he would not be content. The baylye obeyed
as it was reason / and did his commandment through all Haynalte /
commaundynge them in no wise to carry any vitayle or any manner of thing to
Gaunte. If they did / they should run greatly in the dukes displeasur. A
like cry and defense was made in Brabante / So that none durst go to Gaunte /
but by stelthe. Whereof they of Gaunt began to be dismayed / for their
prouisyon began ta fail / and had been in great famyne / and they of Holande
had not conforted them. Who would not leave to aid them / for any commau^
dement that duke Aubert could make. In the same seasone / the sage men and
wise counsaylours of Heynalt / of Brabant / and of Liege: set a day of
counsel to be holden at Harlequebec beside Courtrey. And so there they met:
and they of Gaunt send thither a twelfe of ye most notablest men of the town.
And there they showed how generally / the most perte of the town. Except such
rybaudes and vnthriftye people / as desired nothing but yuell and noise. All
the other (gladlye they said) would have rest and peace: what soever came
thereof. At this counsel / were all the wise counsaylours of all the good
towns in Flaunders. There was the earls counsel / and they of Liege / of
Brabant / and of Heynalte. And the matters were there so well debated / y^ upon
certain articles of peace the gauntoyse returned to their town. And all
such of Gaunte / as desired rest and peace: drew to the houses of two rich
men of Gau^t / who had been at this treaty. The one called sir Gylbert Gente
/ and the other sir Symone Bette: demanding of them tidings. And they
dyscouered the matter to soon / to some of their friends. Saying / good
neighbors: we shall have so good peace (and it please god) that such as loves
peace and rest / shall have it. And some of them that be yuell dysposed in ye
town of Gaunt / to be corrected and punysshed.

How two valyant men of Gauut were slain / by Peter de Boyse and by Philyppe
Dartuell. And of the rebellyon at Paris / against the french king. Cap. CCC
lxxxvii.
IT is said most come^ ly. If it be as he does / it is as he say the. Peter
de boyse who thought him self not well assured of his life / and had his spies
about / to here every new tidings. And such as had been at this said
treaty: had reported in the town. How that this treaty was brought about /
by Gylbert Gent and Simon Bette. And when Peter de Boyse understood it / he was
mad in his mind therefore / and took the matter to him self and said. If any
be corrected for this war / yet I shall not be the first for the matter shall
not go all as they wene. shall they that have been at this treaty: rule every
thing as they list* May hap nay. I purpose not yet to dye. I think the war
has not endured so long / as it shall do. As yet / such as were my good
masters / Johan Lion and Wyllyam Craforde / their dethes is not yet well
revenged. If the matters ^e now in trouble / yet I will bring them in to more
trouble / and so he did. I shall show you how.

THe same proper euennyng / that the cou^ sail should have been the next day in
the counsel Hall / there to here reported the treaty that was taken at
Harlequebecke. Peter de Boyse / came the same euennynge to Ph^lyppe Dartuels
house / and found him in his chamber lyenge in a wyndowe / musing and
studyeng. And the first word he spoke / he said. Philyp Dartuell / here you
any tidings. Nay truly (...) he. But that I here say our men are returned fro
the counsel at Harlequebecke. And to mord we we shall here in the hall / what
tidings they have brought. That is true (...) Peter. But I know all ready /
what ways they have taken and purpose to take. For such as have be there has
showed it to some of my friends. Certain lie Philyppe / the treaty yt they
have made and would make / lies on the ieopardy of our heedes For if there be
peace taken / between the Earl and this town. Know for truth / that you and
I and the lord of Harsels* and all such capitayns / as have aided us in this
war / shall be the first that shall dye: and the rich men shall go quite. They
will bring us in to danger / and go the^ self free. And this was ever the
opinyon of Johan Lion my master. Always the Earl has these marmosettes about
him / as Gylbert Mahewe and his brethren / and the provost of Harlequebecke.
Who is of the lynage of the alderman of the mean crafts / who fled away with
them. We ought wisely to look on this matter / and to se what were best to do.
Philyppe answered and said. Peter / I shall show you my mind. Let us give
knowledge of this / to all our aldermen and capitayns. That they be to morrow
/ all ready aparelled in the market place And than let us two enter in to the
Hall / with a hundred with us: to here the content of y^ treaty. And than let
me alone / so ye will auowe my deed / and abide puissantly by me. For without
we be feared among the commons / it is nothing and so they agreed. Than Peter
de Boyse departed / And send to all rulers and capitaynes under him /
commaundyng them and all their men / to be ready in the morning in the market
place to here tidings. They all obeyed / they durst do none otherwise. And
also / they were ever ready to do yuell.

THe next morning about the hour of.ix. the mayre and aldermen / and rich men
of the town / came into the market place and entered in to the Hall. And thither
came they that had been at the treaty at Harlequebecke. Than thither came Peter
de boyse and Philyp Dart well / and such of their sect well acompanyed. And
whan^e they were all assembled / and set such as would sytte. Than the lord
of Harselz was myste / for he was not there. and so he was sent for / but he
excused himself / because he was sick and not well at ease. Say what ye will
quod Peter du Boyse / for I am here in his stead. Here beynowe: let us here
what they will say / that has been at Harlequebecke. Than there rose up two of
the notablest men of the company / Gylbert Gente and Symone Bette: and one of
them said. Lords of Gaunt / we have been at the parlyament at Harlequebecke /
and have had much pain and traueyle. And also / so had the good men of
Brabant / of Liege / and of Heynalte / to make acorde and agreement / between
our lord the earl of Flaunders and us of Gaunte. Finally at their requests /
and by the help of my lady of Brabant / who sent thither her counsel / and
the duke Aubert his. So that by their means the good town of Gaunt is come to
a peace and to agreement / with our lord the earl. In this manner / that two
hundred men of ours / such as he shall send us their names in writing. within
fyftene days we must send them into the earls prison at Lysle / to put them
clearly to his mercy and pleasure. He is so free and so noble / that it is no
doubt / but that he will have mercy on them. With those words Peter de Boyse
stepte for the / and said. Gylbert Gente / how durst you be so bold to make
such agreement / as to send two hundred of our men of Gaunte / in to the
town of our enemy / in great rebuke and shame / to all the town of Gaunt.
It were better Gaunte were turned up so down / than they of Gaunt should have
such reproach: as to make war and end it so shamefully. We that have herd
you / may well know / that ye shall be none of the two hundred prisoners / nor
also Simon Bet. ye have chosen for your self / now than we will chose for
ourselfe. On for the Philyppe Dartuell / set hands on these false traitors /
that would betray and dishonor the town of Gaunt. There with Peter de Boyse
drew out his dagger / and came to Gylbert Gent / and struck him into the
belly. and so he fell down deed. And Philyppe Dartuell drew out his dagger /
and he struck Simon Bet / and slew him in likewise. And than they cried
treason treason. And they that were slain / had of their men above and
beneth: for they were men of great lygnage / and the richest men of the town:
but they get the^ self out of the town to save them self: so that there
was no more done / but they two slain. But to apease the people / and to
bring them to their believe. They send out of their men / cryenge and saying.
These false traitors / Gylberte Gente and Symone Bette / would have betrayed
the town of Gaunte. Thus the matter passed / these two notable men were slain
/ and no man to revenge them. And when therle of Flanders (being at Bruges)
herd of these tidings: he was sore displeased / and said. At the desire of my
cosyns of Brabante / I lightly agreed to have peace with them of Gaunt. and
now and before this time / they have wrought falsely. But I will they know /
that they shall never have peace again with me: but I will have them at my
pleasure.

THus there was slain in the town of Gaunte / these two balyant men rich and
sage. They might each of them spend of their own patrimony / two thousand
fra^kes yerelye. They were sore be moned privily / but non durst speak of them
openly. Thus the war was more feyrsare than it was before / for they of the
garysons about Gaunte / were night and day busye / to stop all prouisyon
coming to Gaunt. So that they of Brabant nor of Haynalde / dutst not adventure
to bring any thing to Gaunt. For if the earls men met any vitaylers / they
would slay their horses / and bring the^ prisoners in to Ande warpe or to
Teremonde. So that all vitaylers / feared the parell thereof. In the same season
/ the commons of Paris rose and rebelled against the king and his counsel /
because the king and his counsel would generally / reyse up through all
France: ayedes / fo wage / tails / and subsydes: such as had rynne in the
days of Charles / father to y^ king as than. The parisyens rebelled and said.
how that the king last disceassed / had quyte them in his life time. And how
the king his son at his coronacyon at Reins / had acorded to y^ same. Than
the king and his counsel avoided Paris / and went and lay at Myeulx in Bric
As soon as the king was departed fro Paris the commons rose in harness / and
slew all those that had ceased the aids. And brake up y^ prisons and diverse
houses in the town / and robbed and pylled the^: and took all y^ ever they
found. and so came to the bishop of Paris house / and brake up his prisons
/ and delyuerd Hugh Aubert who had been provost of Paris / in the time of
King Charles. Who was in his days by just sentence condemned to prison / for
diverse yuell deeds that he had done / and consented to do. At which time /
some would have had him brent: but these parisyens delivered him. This hap
he had by the rebellyon of the commons / and so he departed the town as soon
as he might / for fear leest he should be takenne again. And so he went into
his own country of Burgoyne: and there showed his friends all his adventure.
These people of Paris during their rebellyon / did much hurt. But there were
many good men that were happy / that they fell not to their rebellyon and
company / for and they had / the matter had been much worse than it was. Thus
the king was at Myeulx and his three uncles with him: the duke of Aniowe / the
duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burgoyne: who were sore dyspleased with this
rebellyon. Than they determined to send thither the lord of Coucy / who was a
sage knight to treat with the commons and to apease them for he could do it
better than any other.

How the lord of Coucy apeased the discencion and rebellyon of them of Paris.
And of the great preparacyon that the duke of Aniou made to make him self
king of Napoles. Cap. CCC lxxxviii.
THan the lord of Coucy / called Enguerrant came to Paris / not with an army
but in peasable manner / with his own servants. and so lyghted at his
lodging / and than he send for some of the^ that were chief begynners of the
rebellyon. and when they were come to him / he showed them in fair manner.
How they had done right yuell / to slay the kings officers / as they had
done. And broken the kings prisons / and delivered the kings prisoners.
Saying / how that if the king and his counsel would be hastye and rygorours
/ they should sore repent it. The which the king would not / because he loves
Paris so well / for he was borne therein: and also it is the chife city of his
realm. Therefore he will not distroye the people that be therein. Showing them
/ how he was come thither / as to be a mean to bring them to peace.
Promisynge them / how he would desire the king and his uncles / to perdone
all that ever they had done. Than they answered and said. How they would
none yuell / nor to have war with the king nor with his uncles. But they
would that these imposycions / subsedyes / and gables / should be laid down
in all Paris: and that the city should be exempte fro all such matters Saying
/ how they would aid the king in some other manner. In what manner quod the
lord of Coucy. They answered and said. We will be content to pay a certain
gold and silver every weke / to a certain man appointed to receive it / to
help to pay the Soudyers / and men of war in France. What sum will ye
pay quod the lord of Coucye? Such sum quod they / as we shall agree upon.
And so the lord of Coucy treated so the matter with them / that with their own
good wylles / they ceased them self to pay wekely / a ten thousand
florence / to a certain man admytted / to be receyuoure thereof. And so thus
the lord of Coucy departed fro them / and went to Myeulx in Brie / to the
King and to his uncles / and showed them what he had done. Than the king was
counsayled for the best / to receive this offer of the Parisyens. Saying /
how it was good to enter on them little and little / For in likewise they
should do with the other good towns in France. Seeing that Paris did thus
begin. Than the lord of Coucy returned to Paris / and brought peace fro the
king to the Parisyence / so that they would keep the promise that they had
made: the which they said they would do. And so a receyuer was appointed to
receive the florence every weke. so that the money should not go out of Paris /
for none other intent / but to pay men of war wha^ need required. And that the
money should not be enployed to the kings use norprofyte: nor to none of his
uncles. Thus the matter continued a certain space / and the Parisyence in peace
/ but the king would not come in Paris / where of the parisyence were sore
displeased.

IN likewise they of Rohane rebelled / the common people rose and slew the
Cathelayne there / and all such as had set the imposycions / aids / and
gabelles on them. And when the king and his uncles herd thereof / they were
right sore dyspleasedde. For they doughted greatly / that other Cities and
towns would do in like case. Than the king was cou^sayled that he should go
to Rohan / and so he did / and apeased the commons there / and perdoned them
the death of his Chatelyne / and of all that they had done. And also they
ordained a receyuour / to whom they paid every weke a certain sum of
florens. and so thereby they were in peace. So thus there began great yuel in
France / and all took fotynge and ensample of the gauntoyse / for why: as than
all the commonties throughout all the world said. how they of Gaunt were good
people / and valyant lie had sustained their fraunchises. Wherefore they said:
they ought to be beloved / praised / and honored.

IT is to be known / that the duke of Aniowe had a great and an high intent
and ymaginacion / to go to the realm of Napoles. For he wrote him self king
of Puyle / of Calabre / and of Cicyle. For pope Clement had given him that
heritage / by virtue of the letters pate^tes / that the queen of Napoles had
given him. The duke of Aniowe / who was sage and ymaginatyfe / and of high
courage and enterprise. He saw well that in time to come / according to the
state that he had begone / the which he was loathe to make less. He thought
thereby / to be no little lord in France. When so noble and high herytages
were fallen to him / as.ii. kyngdoms / Napoles and Cicyle: and three ducheris.
as Puyle / Calabre / and Prouence. for by reason of these countries / whereof he
reputed him self lord and king. He thought he should attain to great richesse
/ and so therefore he set all his intent night and day / how he might perform
that viage. And he knew it would not be / without great conforte of gold and
silver / and great company of men of war / to resyst against all those / that
would let his viage. So the duke of Aniowe for this occasyon / gadered toguyder
as much richesse as he could / and kept him in love with them of Paris /
asmoche as he might. for he knew well that within Paris / there was richesse
great habu^daunce. and also he send to the Earl of Sauoye / in whom he had
great affyaunce. Desyringe him not to fail him at this business / promising:
that as soon as he ca^e in to Sauoy / he would give wages for a hole year /
for a thousand spears of that country. The earl of Sauoy had great joy of
those tidings / for he greatly loved deeds of arms. And he answered to the
messangers / how he would gladly serve the duke / by the said couynaunt.
Whereof the duke of Aniowe was glad / for he loved greatly the company of the
earl of Sauoy. Beside y^ / the duke of Aniowe retained men of arms / to the
nombre of nine thousand. Than he made preparacyon for him self and for his
company at Paris / of all manner of things. As tents / pauylyons / and all
other ordinance / as it should pertayne for a king to do: when he is in
purpose to go in to a far country. Now let us leave to speak of him for a
season / and return to the earl of Cambridge and to his company / being as
than in Portyngale / with the king there.

How the englysshmen rode with out any commandment of the king of
Portyngale. And how the castle of Sygheire in portyngale was taken Cap. CCC
lxxxix.
THe earl of Cambridge and his company refreshed them a long space at Lysbone
/ with the king of Portyngale. And the englysshemen and gascoyns aduysed well
the country / by cause they had never been there before. And as I understood /
there was a marriage accorded / between the daughter of the king of Portyngale
who was of the age of ten years / and the earl of Cambridge son of the same
age. He was called Johan / and the Lady named Beatryce. At the wedding of
these two children / there was made great feast among the lords and
prelates of the realm / and as young as they were / they were laid toguyder
in one bed. So this marriage thus ended / the which endured the space of
eight days. Than y^ king of Portyngale and his counsel / ordained y^ the
men of war / that were as than at Lysbon should deperte in to other places /
and keep the fro^ters. So therle of Cambridge and his company were ordained to
go lie in another town / called Estremour. And the englysshmen and gascons
should lie in another country / called Besy ouse / and young Johan of Cambridge
should abide with the king and his wife. When the Chanone Robersarde / and the
other english knights and gascons took their leave of y^ king to depart to
go to their garrisons. than y^ king said to them. Sirs / I command you ride
not out against our enemies / without my leave and knowledge: for if ye do / I
will not he content. They answered / how they would not ride till they had his
license. and so thus they departed and so rode to y^ town of Besyous / a.ii.
days journey fro Lysbone / and asmoche fro Ceuyll / where as the king of Spain
lay. Who knew right well of the coming of the earl of Cambridge and his
company. And sent word thereof in to France / to such as he thought would
serve him. And when they knew thereof and saw that war was likely to be in
Spaygne / they were glad thereof. And diverse such as desired to be auaunsed
by the war made them ready / and took their way in to Spain.

THe Chanoyne Robersarde / who lay in garyson at Besyouse / with his company
english and gascoyns. On a time he said to his company. Sirs / me think we
lie here thus long still / nothing to our honor. We have done as yet nothing
against our enemies / wherefore they set the less store by us. Therefore and
ye will it is my counsel / that we send to the king of Portyngale /
desyringe him to give us leave to ride / and to do some what against his
enemies. and they all answered and said. We are content. Than sir Johan
Chandonich was sent on that message. and so he came to the king to Lysbone /
and did his message as he was charged to do. But y^ king said* he would in no
wise they should ride forth. And so this knight could get none other thing
of y^ king and so returned to his lords / and said. Sirs the king will in no
wise that ye shall ride forth Than they were sorer displeased tha^ they were
before / and said among them self. how it was not the order of men of war /
tolye so long still in a garyson / without doing some deed of arms. And so
thus they made couynau^t to ride forth at adventure. And so on a day they rode
out in to the feldes / to the nombre of a four hundred men of arms / and as
many archers. And they enterprised to besiege a great town / parteyninge to
the master of saint Johans. And as they went thyderwarde / they took another
way and went to the castle of Sighyre / wherein there was a threscore men of
arms / spaynierdes in garyson. Of whom Peter Gousses and his brother were
capitayns. The chanone Robersarde / who was chefemouer of that journey rode
before: and there was with him sir Olyuer of Beauchampe / sir Mathewe Gourney
Mylles Wyndsore / the lord Talbotte / sir Adam Simon / and sir John^ Fou^dre /
who was bastard brother to the king of England / the Souldycke of Lestrade /
the lord of Newcastell / the lord de la Barde / Raymon of Marson / and diverse
other. And so they rode till they came to the castle of Sighyre / and so made
the^ ready to assail it. And when they within parceyued that they should be
assailed / they orday ned for their defense. And anon after day / the saulte
began right sore and cruel. and the Englysshmen entered in to the dykes /
wherein there was no water / and so they came just to the walls well pauesshed
for the cast of stones / and there they hew with pykes to enter the walls /
and they within cast down on them / bars of iron and stones / and hurt
diverse of them. That day the Chanoyn Robersarde did marueyls in arms / and so
did Eperus a varlet of his. and y^ archers stood a long the dyke / and shot
so holly toguyder / that there was none above y^ durst apere at their defense.
The one half of them within were sore hurt / and there was slain with the
shot / the brother of Peter Gousses capytayne of the castle / called
Bartylmewe / a proper man of arms. And so by his hardynesse / and to much
aduenturyng he was slain.

THus this assaut continued fro the morning till it was noone. The knights
and squyers both English and Gascoyns / spared not to assail the castle /
with great will and courage / because they did that enterprise without the
knowledge of the king of Portyngale. Therefore they did all their pain to
conquer the Castle / to the intent that the renome thereof / should come to
Lysbone. And that men might say. how they had well spedde at their beginning.
Than the Chanoyne Robersarde said. A sirs / we thought yesterday / this
Castle should not have hold so long against us. But and we be so long in
conqueryng of towns and castelles in Spaygne and Galyse / we shall never be
lords of the^ / wherewith y^ knights and squyers took more courage. And with
those words / the Chanoyne Robersarde / for all his pauesse / received a great
stroke: wherewith he was sore hurt and brosed. And he had by him a young squiers
of Heynalt / called Fro^ssart Mullyer. who bare him self valiauntly at this
assaut. and so did all other. The artyllary of the castle: as stones / and
bars of iron began to mynisshe. and they within saw well / that of.xxv. men
of arms / there were but three of them / but they were sore hurt and in parell
of death. So that they could not long endure / but that by force they should
be taken. and they saw their capitayns brother was slain. than they
determined to take some respyte / and in ye mean time to treat for a peace.
Thanne they made token to speak with the englysshmen / and so the assaute
ceased. and the assaylantes came out of the dykes / whereof they had need. for
there were many of them sore traueyled and hurt. Than sir Mathue Gourney
constable of that host / and sir Mylles Wynsore marshall went to them / and
demanded what they would say. The captain sir Peter Gousses said. Sirs / we
se well ye will not depart hens / till ye have this fortress. ye hurt our
people and we yours Let us take counsel one with another. I say for all my
company of whom I am captain / that we will render to you the fortress / our
gods and lives saved. sirs / take this off re. This is a right covenant of
arms. ye are as at this time more stronger than we be. Therefore it behooves us
thus to do. The english knights said / they would take counsel / and so
they did And when they were determined / they answered and said. how they
within should depart when they list / but their goods should abide still in
the castle: for they should have nothing but their lives. And when Peter
Gosses saw there was none other remedy / he acorded thereto / right sore
against his will. Thus this Castle was given up / and put in to the hands of
thenglysshmen. And so the spaynierdes departed without any saueco^duct / and
went to Esteryes / where the masters of saint Jaques lay. How be it they
found him not there / as than: for he understood that the english men were
abroad / therefore he was entered in to the feldes / with a four hundred men of
arms / spaynierdes and castylians / in trust to mete with the englysshmen at
their advantage / to fight with them.

How the Chanoyne Robersarde and his company returned to their garyson. And
of the marriage of the king of England / to the daughter of the king of
Rhomayns. Cap. CCC lxxxix.
When these knights of England had conquered ye castle of Sigheir they were
right joyful / and so they repaired it and left therein.xl. of their company /
and did furnyshe it with artillary and other purueyaunces / and set there a
good captain to keep it. Than they counsayled toguyder / what was best for
the^ to do. And so they determined to go again to their first lodgings: and
the englysshmen and gascoyns deperted in three routes. And behind all to keep
ye field / abode the Chanoyne Robersarde / and with him certain englysshmen /
gascoyns / and almayns. He was about a threscore spears and as many archers
and so they rode all that day / and the second day in the morning all hole
toguyder. and they entered in to a great town of Portyngale / called Huence /
and the castle of Concrelet / was right without a wode side. In the which wode
more nere to Concrelet than to Huence / was the master of saint James in a
busshme^t / with a four hundred men of arms. And as soon as the englysshmen
parceyued them / they drew all togider and made no countenance of fear / but
rode forth a good pase. And the spaynierdes for all their great nombre made no
semblant to break their busshement / but held them self still and close. for
they believed that the englisshmen had nere hand their great battle / and
therefore they durst not assail them. So thus they departed each fro other /
without any more doing. The spaynierdes returned the same night to Esteryes /
and the Chanoyne Robersarde to Uesyouse. And there he showed his company / how
they had seen the spagynierdes / between Concrelet and Huence / and said. If we
had been all toguyder / we would have fought with the^ / and so they were sorry
/ that they had not been all toguyder. And when these tidings came to the
knowledge of the king of Portingale / he made semblant that he was dyspleased /
because they rode forth without his commandment or ordinance. Thus the
englysshmen and gascoyns lay still in their garysons all that winter / without
any thing doing / worthy to be made me^cyon of / the which greatly anoyed
the^. There lyeng still / was not by their wylles. In this mean time / Johan /
king of Castyle: send to the french king and to his uncles for socour.
Showing them / how the earl of Cambridge was arrived in Portyngale. And how ye
voice ran through the realms of Castyle and Portyngale. How that the king
of England / the duke of Lancastre and his brother / puissantlye acompanyed:
should come in to Portyngale / to the earl of Cambridges aid / in the next
somer. Wherefore / he desired the french king / according to such alyaunces
and confederacions / as the realm of France and the realm of Spaygne has
toguyder / and by reason of good love and amyte. That they would send some men
of war to him the next somer / to the intent to resyst his enemies. Than the
french king and his counsel / consented well thereto. For they saw well /
how the king of Spain / desired nothing but reason. Than it was ordained in
France / to give all manner of men of war license to go thither. And the king
delivered the^ their first pressed money. So sir Olyuer of Clesquy / brother to
sir Bertram of Clesquy constable of France / was ordained to take his voyage /
in the beginning of the springyng time. And so did knights and squyers: of
Bretayne of France / of Beause / of Picardy / of Aniowe of Berrey / of Bloyse
/ and of Main. And so they passed by companyes to have ye more ease / and
their passage was opyn through ye realm of Aragon / and they found every
thing ready / and their wages paid. but they paid not for every thing they
took / when they were abroad in the country / which was great hurt to the
poor commons.

yE have herd here before / how king Richard of England / the space of a
year / had been in treaty with king Charles of Almayne. Who wrote him self
the tytell of the king of Rhomayns / to have his suster / the lady Anne in
marriage. And how sir Simon Burle had sore traueyled in that matter. And how
the duke of Tasson in Almayne had been in England / for to confyrme that
marriage. And the matter was so concluded / that the king of Rhomayns send his
suster in to England / and the duke of Tasson with her. And a great company of
knights / ladies / and damsels / in royal astate / as it aperteyned to such
a lady. And so she came first in to Brabante / to the town of Bruesels. And
there the duches of Brabant received her and all her company / in goodly manner.
The duke of Brabant was her uncle / for she was daughter to the emperor Charles.
And so thus ye lady Anne of Behayne held her at Brusels with her uncle and
aunte / more than the space of a month. She durst not go thens. I shall tell
you why. It was showed her / that there was on the sea a.xii. vessels of nor
mayns / between Caleys and Hollande / and they robbed and pilled on ye see /
they cared not who. And so they kept he bounds of the sea / about Flaunders
and zelande / abiding the coming of this young lady. For the french king would
gladly have broken that marriage / for he greatly douted the alyaunce / between
England and Almayne. How be it always it is said / that it is not honorable
to take ladies in war. In coloryng the war bitwene lords / to make their
war the fayrer. The prince of Wales / father to king Richard of England. It
was said / he consented to the taking of the lady of Burbone mother to the
french queen. She was taken by the prices servants / in the castle of
Belperch. and so brought in to Guyen / and raunsomed. Wherefore the frenchmen
thought / if they might take the king of Englandes wife / in reue^gyng thereof /
they should do no wrong. So for fear and doubt thereof / this lady lay still
at Brusels / the space of a month. Than the duke of Brabant send his
counsel into France / as the lord of Roussela^s / and the lord of
Bousqueher: to show the king and his uncles / they were nephews to the duke
of Brabant: as children of his suster. These lords of Brabant spedde so well
with the french king and his counsel / that they had a sure save conduct /
for the lady to pass outher by land or by see. Wheder it pleased her /
through the realm of France / or by the fro^ters thereof to Calais. And the
normains that were on the sea / were countermaunded again. And so the french
king and his uncles wrote to the Duke of Brabant / that they did this for his
sake all only / and for none other. This pleased much the duke of Brabant and
the duchess / and all such as would pass the sea. So than they departed fro
Brusels / and the lady took her leave of the duke her uncle / and of ye
duchess her aunt. And of the ladies and damsels of the country / such as
had held her company. And so the duke send with her / a hundred spears to
convey her to Gaunte / and there she rested her a day. And there the gauntoyse
did her great honor. and fro thens she went to Bruges / and there the earl of
Flaunders received her right honorably / and there she rested her a three
days. And than she rode forth and came to Grauelyng / where as was ready / the
earl of Salysbury / and the earl of Dymester with a five hundred speres: and as
many archers / and so they brought her to Calays. And the brabansies returned
/ as soon as they had delivered her to the barons of England.

THis young lady tarried not long at Calayes / but that she had wind at will.
and so than she entered in to her ship on a friday in the morning / and all
her company and horses in other ships. And the same day she aryued at Dover /
and there she rested her two days: and the third day she rode to saint Thomas
of Caunterbury. And there she found the earl of Buckyngha^ / who received her
honorably. and so long this lady rode forth that she came to London / where
as she was honorably received of the burgesses / ladies / and damsels of the
country and city. And so the king of England wedded her / in the chapel of
his palace of Westmynster / the.xx. day of Christmas: at which there was great
feast and tryu^phe holden. And ever sith she deperted first out of Almayne /
the gentle and noble knight sir Robert of Namur left her not / till she was
married to the king of England. Whereof he had great thank / both of the
king of England / and of the king of Almayne. And so the king of England after
his marriage / brought ye queen his wife to the castle of Wyndsore / and there
kept a great house. And so there they were ioyously together. And my lady
princes the kings mother / abode still with ye queen. And also ye same time
there was in the court with the queen / the duches of Bretayne suster to king
Richard. for Lois her husband duke of Bretayne / could not have her delivered
out of England for the king of England nor his counsel / would in no wise
consent to send her in to Bretayne / because her husband ye duke was become
french. For the lords and knights in England / said the same time. That the
duke of Bretayne acquyted himself fasly / to the earl of Buckyngham and to our
men / now at this last vyage y^ they made in France. And for all he has sent
for his wife / yet will not we send her to him. but will rather send thither
his.ii. enemies / John^ and Guy of Bretayne. Who were children to saint
Charles of Breten / who has more right to the heritage of Bretayne than he
has. for he is duke but by reason of our puyssaunce and aid and be semyng: he
co^sydreth but yuell / ye goodness y^ we have done to him. wherefore we must in
likewise / show him the vylany that he does to us. True it was / these two
lords John^ and Guy of Bretayne / children to saint Charles of Bloyse were
prisoners in England. and kept in a strong castle / in the keeping of sir
Peter Dambreticourt. And they were desired in curtes manner / by the king of
England and his counsel / that they should hold Bretayne by faith and
homage of the king of England. And if they would thus do / than the king of
England promised / to recover their right in Bretayne. and John^ to have to his
wife / ye lady Phylippe of Lancastre wydowe. But they answered: in no wise they
would do so / nor for sake to be french to dye in prison. So thus ye
materhanged. And after the king of England knew ones fermly their minds /
they were no more desired thereto.

How the french king could have no money of the receyuour of Paris. And how
the duke of Aniowe passed in to Italye / and of his noble chyualry. Cap. CCC.
xCi.
LE have herd here before / how the parysiens were a greed with the king / to
pay a certain so^me of florens every weke. This some of floreyns was paid to
a certain receyuour appointed by them / but the king had it not / nor it went
not out of Paris. And so it happed / that the king had besynes with money to
pay his men of war / such as he sent in to Castle. whereto he was bound /
by ye aliaunces that was made before. And so the king sent to Paris to his
receyuour / that he should prepare for him a hundred thousand frankes / for he
said he would comfort and aid king John^ of Castle. The receyuour answered ye
kings letters and message right graciously / and said: how he had money
mough. how beit he might deliver none without the hole consent of ye town of
Paris. These words pleased nothing the king / but he said he would puruey
right well for remedy: when he might / and so he did. And so for his entente
(as at that time) he purueyed him of other money / by the help of his good
towns in Pycardy. Thus there was a great disce^cion / between the king and
them of Paris. and so the king would not come to Paris / but he abode at Mieulx
/ at Senles / or at Compayne / and there a bout: whereof they of Paris were sore
displeased. And the greatest sure tie and mean that they had / was the duke
of Aniou / who wrote him self king of Cecyll / and of Hyerusalem: and had
taken on him the arms thereof. This duke most commonly lay at Paris / and there
he gate much good to help him to his viage. He gate toguyder so great a so^me
of money (that it was said) that he had at Roquemore beside Auignon / two
myllions of florens. He entreated so them of Paris by his fair langage. and by
that he had ye soueraynte above all his brethren / because he was eldest. that
he had of them the so^me of a hundred thousand frankes. But the king could
get none of them / nor his uncles of Berrey / nor of Burgoyne. and when the
duke of Aniou had made his provision / in the springyng time of the year he
took his journey / and so passed the realm / and came to Auignon: where as he
was greatly feasted with the pope / and with the cardynals. and thither came to
him the barons and rulers / of the good towns of Prouence / and received him
for their lord / and did him homage and feaulte. and did put them self in to
his obeisance. and thither came to him ye gentle earl of Sauoy his cosyn: with
certain lords and knights / who were also well received of the pope and
cardynals. And there the duke of Aniou delivered to the earl of Sauoy a great
so^me of money / for the^ of Sauoy / who were a great nombre. So than the duke
and therle took leave of the pope and departed / and took the way to the
dolphyn of Uien / and so in every good town they had good chere. And so their
men of war went on before / and at last they entered into Lombardy / the
which passage was ready open. And so the duke entered in to Lombardy / and in
every town had great feast and chere / and specially at Myllayne. There they
were honored beyond measure of sir Galeas / and sir Barnabo. and they had of
them great riches and iuels / that it were marueyle to recounte it. And in
every place the duke of Aniowe held astate like a king / and ever as he went
he made money floreyns / and white money to pay his men of war. And when
they came in to Coustane / and aprochyd Rome / than they kept them self nerer
together than they did before. For the romans / who knew right well of their
coming / were greatly fortifyed against them. and ye romans had a capitayn an
englisshman / called sir John^ Ha^onde / who had long lived among the
romans: and knew all the fronters / and had many so wdyours in the field /
at the wages of the romans / as almayns / and other nacyons: in the quarrel
of pope Urban. who was at Rome. He was nothing afraid of the coming of the
duke of Aniowe. and when any spoke to him and showed him how the duke of
Aniou: with the earl of Sauoy in his company / was coming to Rome ward / by
lykelyhode to put him down fro his siege apostolyke / because they were all
clementyns. He would than answer / and say. Christ protege nos. Christ
help us. this was all the fray that he had / and all the answer that he
would make.

THus the men of war / and the duke of Aniou calling him self king of
Napoles / of Cecyll / and of Hyerusalem / Duke of Puylle / and of Calabre. And
the Earl of Sauoy and his company / costed Italy and Coustane / and the marches
of Denconnye / and the land of Patrimone: and entered not Rome / for the duke
of Aniowe would make no war to Rome / nor to ye romans. for he thought to
do the viage that he enterprised or he departed out of France. and in every
place where as he went he kept ye state of a king / and every man praised him.
And all men of war lyked well his payment. The same time in ye city of
Napoles there was his enemy / sir Charles de la Payx / who in like wise wrote
him self king of Napoles / of Cecyll / and of Hyerusalem / Duke of Puyll / and
of Calabre. He claymed to be king by rightful enherytau^ce / without any heir
in lawful marriage / after the king of Napoles was deed. This Charles held
the gift that the queen had made to the pope / but in vain: and so showed
after his opinyon / by two reasons. the one was / he sustained and said. and
the neapolitans aided him / in sustaynynge of the same. and the cesilyens in
likewise (they said) how the queen of Napoles / could not give away another
man's heritage. and though her gift had been good / and so allowed in the
court of Rome / yet she did not well. for she held with pope Urbane and not
with Clement. these were the questions and the debates / that sir Charles de la
Payx laid for him self / and in ye beginning he wrought wisely. For he sore
fortifyed and furnysshed the castle of Leufe / the which is the most
strongest castle of the world. for it is set by enchau^tment in the sea / and
it is not passyble to be wone / but by nygromancy or by the art of ye devil.
he vitailed it for three or four year / and had with him a certain men of war
and so kept that place: for he knew well they of Napoles would not forsake him
though he lost Puyll and Calabre for.ii. or three year. he thought to recover it
again as lightly. for he ymagyned in his mind: that the duke of Aniou would
entertayne such a nombre of men of war as he had brought with him / the
which should not long lie in his puyssaunce so to do / outher for fault of
vytayle: or for money. Whereby he thought they should be constrained to depart
within a two or three year. And than he ymagined / that when they were weary and
out of good rule / than he would fight with them at his advantage. These
thoughts and ymagynacions hadd Charles de la Payx / whereof he saw some take
effect: or the term passed that he presired. For truly / there was no prince
christened: without it were the french king / or the king of England. that
could keep four year to gyder such a nombre of men of war / out of their own
countries / as ye duke of Aniou had with him. He brought over the mountains
a.xxx. thousand fyghtinge men / and to begin such an enterprise / behooves in
ye beginnynge wisely to consider and ymagin.

When the duke of Aniou and his company / entered in to Puylland in to Calabre /
the country incontinent turned to them. For the people showed / how they
desired no other thing / nor to have none other lord / but the duke of Aniou.
And so thus with in a short time / all the lords / cities / and towns in
that country / were under his obeisance. Such as had been in those cou^treyes
/ the which is one of the greatest marches of the world. said and affyrmed:
how yt for because of the great plenty and welthe that haboundeth in those
parties / the people are all ydell / and will do no labor. And when these men
of war were in this country / the which they found so replenysshed with
all wealth / whereof they were right glade. And than the duke of Aniou / the earl
of Sauoy / the earl of Uandon / and all the chyualry of France / of Bretayn /
and of Sauoy passed forth and came in to the marches of Napoles. They of
Napoles / for all ye fear that they had of these men of war / they would
never close gate of their town / but kept the^ still open. for they thought
well / that ye duke of Aniou should never en^ in to their town / with their
displeasure. for if he were within the town with all the people that he had /
they thought he should but lose him self and all his / and they list. for
their houses were not easy to be won / for they had plankes and boordes: to
take away when they list. and underneath is the sea / so that none dare
enterprise there too fight. Than there was an enchaunter / a conning man in
nygromancy / in the marches of Napoles / and so he came to the duke of Aniou /
and said. Sir / if ye will / I shall render to you the castle of Leufe / and
all tho that be within / at your pleasure. how may that be quod the duke. Sir
quod he I shall show you. I shall by enchau^tment / make the air so thycke /
that they within / shall think that there is a great bridge on the sea / for
ten men to go a front. And when they within the castle se this bridge / they
will be so afraid / that they shall yield them to your mercy. for they will
thanne dout / if they be assailed / that they should be taken perforce. The
duke had great marueyle of his words / and called to him the earl of Uandon /
and the earl of Genesue / sir John^ and sir Peter of Benill / sir Moris of Maum
and other. and showed them what this enchauntour had said / wherefore they had
great marueyle. Than the duke said. Fair master: on this bridge ye ye speak
of / may our people assuredly go thereon to the castle / to assail it. Sir
quod the enchauntour / I dare not assure you that. for if any that passes on
the bridge / make the sign of the cross on him / all shall go to naught /
and they that be on the bridge shall fall in to the sea. Than the duke began to
laugh / and a certain of young knights that were there present said / sir. For
godsake / let the master assay his connyng / we shall leave making of any sign
of the cross on us as for that time / and a more redyer way can we not get
our enemies. Well quod the duke / I shall take advise in this matter. Therle of
Sauoy was not there present / but he came to the duke sone after.

How the earl of Sauoye / caused this enchau^ters heed to bestryken of. And
how the Chanone Robersarde and his company took diverse castles in Spain. Cap.
CCC. xCii.
When the earl of Sauoy was come in to ye tent of the duke of Aniowe / the
master enchauntour was as thanne departed. Than ye duke showed him all ye
words of the master / and what he offered. the earl bethought him a little /
and than said. sir send him to my lodgyng / and I shall examyn him sir / I
know well / it is the same enchauntour / by whom the queen of Napoles and sir
Oaths of Bresuych were taken / sir the castle of Leufe. for he caused by his
craft / the sea to seem so high / that they within the castle feared / that
the sea should have over flowen y^ castle. whereof they were so abashed /
that they went all to have dyed. Sir / a man ought not to have any great trust
in such people. sir / ye may se the unhappiness of them of this country and
their nature. All only now to please you / and to have profit by you. This
enchau^tour would now betray them / to whom ones he delivered the queen of
Napoles and her husband / the which was to sir Charles de la Payx. Than the
duke said. sir / I shall send him to you / than the lords fell to other
matters. and than ye earl of Sauoy returned to his lodging / and the next day
the enchauntour came to the duke / and saluted him. As Soon as the duke saw him
/ he said to one of his servants. Go and bring this master to the earl of
Sauoy. The squier came to the master / and said. sir / my lord the duke /
will that ye go and speak with the earl of Sauoy. and he said. sir / I am
content. than ye squier brought him to the earls tente / and said. sir: here is
the master / that my lord ye duke has sent to you. when the earl saw him /
he had great joy / and said. master / is it of trouthes that ye will cause us
too have the castle of Leufe / so good chepe as ye say. sir quod the
enchau^tour / that shall I do. for sir / by the same means: I caused before
this / he y^ has it now / sir Charles de la Payx to win it. And the queen of
Napoles and her daughter / and sir Robert of Arthoyse her husband / and ser
Oaths of bresuich. And sir / I am the man of the world / ye sir Charles dela
Payx reputeth most / and is in most fear of. By my faith quod the earl of
Sauoy / ye say well. and I will that sir Charles de la Payx / shall know that
he has great wrong to fear you. But I shall assure him of you / for ye shall
never do enchauntme^t to disceyue him / nor yet none other. I would not that in
time to come / we should be reproched / that in so high an enterprise / as we
be in / wherein there be so many noble knights and squyers assembled. that we
should do anythyng by enchau^tment / nor that we should wyn our enemies by such
craft. Than he called to him a servant / and said. go and get a hangman / and
let him stryke of this masters heed / without delay. and as soon as the earl
had commanded it / incontinent it was done. for his heed was stryken of before
ye earls tent. Thus ended this master enchau^tour / and so was paid his wages
/ acordyng to his deserts. Now will we leave to speak of the duke of Aniou /
and of his vyage. and speak of the besynes of Portyngale / and show how the
englisshmen and gascoyns parceueryd.

When it came to the beginning of ye month of April / the knights yt were in
garyson in the town of Uesious / and had lain there a long season and not ryden
forth / but wha^ they were before Syghiere. So than they took advise among the^
self to ride forth / and they had great marueyle / what ye king of Portyngale
and the earl of Cambridge thought. In ye they had been a ten months in the
country of Portyngale / and had ryden forth but one time / which was to the^
a great shame. Tha^ they determined to send to the earl of Cambridge to show
him their minds. and so the Souldych of Lestrad was sent to him / and so he
ca^e to Estremouse / where as the earl lay / and said to him. sir: all our
company has sent me hyder to you / to know your pleasure / what ye will do.
for they have great marueyle for what cause ye have brought them in to this
country / and lie so long still / the which is to the^ a great displeasur.
sir they desire to know your pleasure / what ye will do / for they would feign
be doing of somewhat. Sir quod the earl / ye know well / when I deperted out
of England My lord my brother / the duke of Lancastre / promised me by his
faith / that as soon as he were returned out of Scotland / that he would come
hyder / with a certain nombre of men of war / as a three thousand and as
many archers. for I was sent hyder in this state y^ I am in. for none other
intent / but to advise the country and I am sure / shortly we shall here
some tidings. for I have great marueyle that he taryeth so long. reco^mende me
to all your company and show the^ as I have showed you: howbeit I may not nor
will not let them to ride forth / if they have sore affection thereto. but ye
know well / the king of Portyngale pays all our wages / therefore it must be
ordered by him. By my faith sir quod the souldich / he pays but yuell and that
all the hole company complayneth of. he owes us as yet wages for.vi. months.
he will pay you right well quod the earl / money shall come right well at
point. Thus departed the Souldiche fro y^ earl / and returned to his company /
and showed the^ / as ye have hard. Sirs quod the Chanone Robersard. for all
this I will not lie still. I se well he does but disse^ble with us / he would
not that we should ride forth / to thentent we should have no cause to
demand our money. but I am of y^ opynion to ride forth and so they all
determined the same / and thereupon made every thing ready / and appointed the
euenyng / when they would ride forth the next morning. Than there ca^e to the^
/ sir John^ Ferand / a knight of ye king of porti^gales / who had been infourmed
how they would ride forth / and so he brought letters to ye Chanone Robersarde
which he red: and found therein / how the king of Portyngale defended him in
any wise to ride forth: Saying further / how he knew well yt the styrring of
any rydyng forth to do any enterprise / was by his procuring. Of these
tidings was ye Chanone Robersard sore displeased / and said to the knight.
sir: I se well / the king will not in any wise / that I should ride forth.
Take it so yt I a bide still in my lodging / think you yt these other
knights / who are better / and more valiant than I am* that they will leave
for all that their enterprise? I ensure you nay. and that ye shall* se tomorowe
/ for they are all determined to ride. sir quod ye knight / than command ye
them in the kings name to a bide still: and not to stir. by my faith quod
the Chanone / that will I not do. but sir / command ye the^ sith ye come fro
the king. So thus the matter rested all that night and in the morning they
sowned their tru^pets. Than knights and squiers armed them / and mounted on
their horses / and so came to the Chanone Robersardes lodging / who did not
arm himself. And there these knights / and squiers rested. and the Chanone
Robersarde came to a wyndowe / and spoke to them / and showed them / how the
king would not that he should ride forth / nor none with him. By my faith
quod they: than will we / seeing we beso forewarde / and so we counsel you to
do. it shall be no reproach to us / and we ride forth: though ye abide behind.
So the Chanone Robersard saw well there was none other boot for him / but to
arm him / and to ride forth with them / and so he did / and so did y^ knight
of Portyngale / sir John^ Ferande. wherefore after he was in sore displeasure
with the king / and like to have dyed there fore. So thus at the desire of
these companyons they armed the^ / and issued out of the town of Uesyouse /
and entered in to the feldes. They were to ye nombre of four.C. spears / and as
many archeres. and took the way to Geuyll / and came to a town called the Bane.

So long they rode forth that they came to the town of Bane / and there
lyghted a foot. on that part / that they thought most prignable. and there
they set the^ self in array ready to give assaute / and so entered in to ye
dykes which were dry / without any water / and so came to the walls / and mad
a ferse assaut / and mined and under hewed the walls. The same time in the
town of Bane / there were no men of war / but the men of the town yuell
armed. How beit they were at their defense / and did cast darts and stones
as well as they might. but at lenght they could not endure / but to be taken.
Than they began to treat / and so finally they yielded up the town / their
goods and lives saved. sayng how fro thens forth / they would be under the
obeisance of the king of Portyngale. and so thus they were received / and all
ye men of war entered in to the town / and well refresshed them self. Than
they went and regarded the castle and saw well how it was prignable. and so
yt euenyng some of the host / and they of the castle did skrymysshe. and in
the morning they made assaut / and they within defended themself. With in the
castle there was captain / a gentleman of the country. Howbeit he was no
very good man of war / as it well apered. and he was called Peter Jagouse /
for as soon as he saw yt he was assailed / with so many good men of warr^ he
was afraid / and fell in treaty / and so yielded him self and ye castle / his
life saved. and such as were within with him. and so it was taken and new
refresshed / with men of arms and archers. than they departed and came to a
another castle / a vii. mile thens / called Courtise. Than they set them self
in order to give assaut / and so they did right fersly / they yt were within
defended them self right valyauntly / to their powers. And so at this assaut /
the captain was slain within the castle / called Radulphes / a right subtle
and an expert man of arms / he was slain with an arrowe / for he adue^tured
him self to far at the defense. After that he was deed / the other could not
long endure. and so the castle was taken / and they within most part
slain. Thus the Chauone Robersarde and his company / had the castle of
Courtyse / the which was new fortifyed / and repeopled again. and thau they
depa^ted aprochyng to the cite of Ceuyll the great.

Of the great pillage and proyes / done by the Chanone Robarsarde and his
company / against the king of Castyll / and of the discencyon that was among
them. Cap. CCC. xCiii.
SO much did these men of war / englisshmen and gascoyns / that they came to
Ja^^^y a.x. mile fro Ceuyll / which was a town but fe^ly enclosed. But within
the town there was a mynster right strong / the which they of the country
had fortefyed / and there in they were / in trust of the strenght of y^ place.
at the (...) coming (...) town was taken and brent / and the mynster
(...)ayled / the which assaut enduced but one hour(...) but y^ it was won.
wherein there was great pyllage for them that entered first / and there were many
men slain. And than they ^ode forth / for they were enfourmed that in a marys
thereby / there was a great boty. for down in a valey beside the marys / there
was mo than.xx. thousand^ beasts / swyne / be^^es / kene / and moutons. Of
which tidings they had great joy / and so went thither / and entered into y^
marys. and so by their ^o^e men all these beestes were driven before the^. Than
they took advise to return to Uesyous their old logy^g^s / and so returned
and took the way thither. and so came thither the next day by night with all
their pray / whereby they were well vitayled. This beca^e of this journey. And
when ser John^ Ferande was come to Lys bone / to the king of Portyngale / and
showed him how they hadd sped / and what great pray they had brought to
Uesyous. Wenyng / that the king would have been content the^ with / but he was
not. for the king than said to him. Why thou false ^^aytour how durst you be
so hardy / against the co^masidment that I made / y^ none of them should ^yde.
to consent to do y^ contrary / and were thy self in their company. by ye holy
saint James I shall cause y^ to be hanged. Than the knight fell on his knees /
and said. sir / their captain did aquyte him well and truly / in obeyng your
co^maundment. but the resydue cawsed him to go forth with the^ a gaynst his
will / and made me also to go with them to show the^ the ways in the country.
and sir / sith the journey has taken good effect / ye ought to pardon it.
howbeit for all those words / the king made him to be put in prisone. And so
remained / till the earl of Ca^bridge caused him to be delivered / when he ca^e
to Lys^on to the king: as ye shall herafter.

After that thenglysshmen and gas^o^s / were returned to the town of Uesyous /
and there tarried a great space. than they de^myned to send to the king of
Portingale for their wages / that they were behind. and so they send forth
the lord Tal^ot a baron. And when he was come to Lysbone / and had spoken with
the king / for that he was come for. The king answered and said how they had
two times rydden forth against his commandment / wherein they had displeased
him / the which delayed their payment. and so as than the lord ^albot could
have non other answer. and so returned to his company / and showed the^ the
kings answer / wherwt they were sore displeased. The same weke therle of
Cambridge removed fro Estremuse / and came and lodged at Uesious / in an abbey
of freres without the town. The knights and squiers of England and Gascone /
were right glad thereof. Among these companyons / there were some that might
natforbere their wages so long / and among them self they said. we are
marvelously evil dealt / with all. for we have been here in this country /
nyghe the space of a year / and yet we have had no wages. It can not be / but
that our captain has recey^ed it / for he would never have suffered to have
forborne it so long. These sayynges and murmuryng / multiplied so among them /
till at last (they said) they would endure it no lengar. And so among them
self they set a day to speak together / in a fair mynster with out the town /
right over against the Freres / where as the Earl of Cambridge was lodged. And
the Chanone Robersarde said / he would be there. And to say truth / it was
needful for him ^o to be / for else the matter had been worse than it was.

iN the morning / when they were all assembled / except the Chanon Robersard:
for he was not as than come to the^. There was sir Willm^ Beaucha^pe / sir
Mathue Gorney his uncle / the lord Talbot / sir Wyllm^ Helmon. and the gascons
/ as the lord de la barde the lord of Newcastell / the Souldyche of Lestrade
/ and diverse other. Than they began to speak / and make their co^playntes each
to other. and among the^ there was a knight / a bastard brother of the king of
Englandes / called sir John^ Soltier / who was right bold in spekyng and said.
The earl of Cambridge has brought us hyder / always we are ready to adventure
our lives for him. and yet he with holds our wages. I counsel / let us
be all of one alyaunce and of one accord. and let us among ourselfe reyse up
the baner of saint George: and let us be fre^des to god / and enemies to all
the world For without we make our self to be feared / we get nothing. By
my faith quod sir Wyllyam Helmon / ye say right well / and so let us do. They
all agreed with one voice / and so regarded among the^ / who should be their
captain. Than they aduysed in yt case / how they could not have a better
captain than sir John^ Soltier. For he should than have good leysed to do
yuell / and they thought he was more metelyer thereto tha^ any other. Than they
raised up the penon of saint George / and cried a Soltier a Soltier / the
valyant bastard. friends to god and enemies to all ye world. And so they were
determined / first to ouerron the town of Uesyous / and to make war against
the king of Portyngale. Sir Mathewe Gourney and sir Wyllyam Beauchampe / gave
counsel not to ouerron the town of Uesyous / but their counsel could not
be herd. And as they had raised up the penon of saint George / and were
departing out of the mynster. The Chanone Robersarde came to them and entered in
to ye prese / and said a loud. Fair lords what will ye do? have good order
and temperaunce in your selfs. ye se well ye be sore dismayed. Than ca^e to
him sir Johan Soltier and sir Wyllm^ Helmon and other. and showed him what they
had done / and what they were in purpose to do. tha^ the Chanone with fair
langage refrayned the^ and said. Sirs / remember and ymagin well your deed yt
ye enterprise / the which me think is but a folly / and an outrage. We can not
better be distroyed / than by our self. If we make war to this country /
our enemies shall here tidings thereof. They shall thereby enforce the^ self /
when they se that we go not forward. thus we shall lose two manner of ways. we
shall reiose and assure our enemies / in that they be as now in doubt of. And
also / we shall false our truth / to therle of Cambridge. Why quod Soltier /
what would ye that we should do? we have suende more than our wages comes to.
And we have had no money sithe we came into Portyngale. Though ye be paid and
we be not / yet ye have had a fair sufferyng. By my faith quod the Chanone / I
have had no more payment than ye have had. nor without your knouledge I ensure
you / I will receive nothing. Than some of the knights that were by / said.
Sir / we believe you well. But sir / every thing must have his course. Sir /
show ye / how we may honorably issue out of this matter / and to have hasty
delyuera^ce / ye we might be paid of our wages. for if we be not shortly well
paid the matter will go yuell. Than the Chanon robersard began to speak / and
saw well how the english co^panyons were displeased with the king of
Portyngale. and saw well money would apease the^ / than he said to the^ thus.
Fair lords I counsel / that in the same state that we be now in. Let us go
and speak with therle of Cambridge and show him all our needs* that shall be
quod Soltier / so yt ye will auowe my saying. they were all content so to do.
And so in the same manner as they were / they went forth with the penon of saint
George before the^ / and so ca^e to the freres / where as therle lay. and he was
as than going to dinner. The companions were mo than.vii. C. and so they entered
in to the court / and demanded for therle: and he ca^e out of his chamber in
to the hall to speak with the^. Than all the knights that were there auau^sed
forth / and Soltier before the^: who with a bold spyrite / spoke and said.
sir / we are come here in to your presens / and diverse other here without. sir
/ ye have brought us out of England our own nation. and sir / ye are our
chief captain / and wages have we non. and we can ask none of no man but of
you. for as for the king of Portyngale / we had never come to do him service /
if ye should not have paid us. and ser / if ye will say yt the war is not
yours / but the king of Portyngals. We shall pay or self / than well enough of
oue wages. For first we will ouerron this country / and than catch it who so
will after. Soltier quod therle / I say not but that ye shall be paid. but to
ouerron this country / ye shall cause me to have great blame of the king of
Portyngale / and also of the king of England. Why sir quod Soltier / what
would ye yt we should do? sir quod therle / I would ye should take three of our
knights / one of England / another of Almayne / and the third of Gascone.
and let these three go to Lysbon to the king / and show him what need ye be in.
And compain of the long delay of payment of your wages. and than if ye have
no remedy / ye have more cause to follow your entprise / by my faith quod the
Chanon robersarde / my lord here therle of Ca^bridge speaks sagely and
valiantly. and so to that purpose they all determined. but for all that they
kept still with the^ / the penon of saint George. Saying / how lythe they had
raised it by one accord / in the realm of Portyngale. they would not lay it
down again / as long as they were there. Than they ordained them that should
go to the king on this message / and sir Wyllyam Helman / was named to go for
the englysshmen / and sir Thomas Simon for the almaynes: and the lord of
Newcastell for the gascoyns.

THese three knights did so much / that they came to Lysbone / and there
found the king / who made them good chere / and demanded of them / how
their company did. Sir quod they / they be all in good point / and would ride
forth with right a good will / to enploye their time otherwise than they do or
have done. For this lyeng still / is to them nothing agreeable. Well quod the
king they shall ride forth shortly / and I in their company / and that show
them fro me. Sir quod sir Willyam Helman / we are sent hyder fro the^ to
thente^t that we should show you on their behalfes. That sithe they came in to
this country they have had another pressed nor wages of you / y^ which they
desire generally to have. sir / it is a hard thing to have the love and
service of me^ of war / without they be otherwise paid / tha^ they have been
or this. Sir / they have been in great thought a long space / because they
could not tell to whom they should be long. And sir they have laid the
charge thereof on our capitayns / whereby there was and is lyckely to grow much
yuell. Sir / the capitayns are excused: in that it is known / that they have
received nothing / and ye know well they say truly. Sir they will be paid of
their wages / if ye will have their service. and if ye pay them not / they
certify you by us / that they will pay them self of yours. Sir / take aduyce
and make an answer / that we may show them your pleasure / they abide for
nothing else. The king than be thought him a little / and said. Sir Wyllyam it
is reason they be paid / but they have sore displeased me / in that they have
rydden forth contrary to my commandment. and if that had not ben / they had
been all paid or this time. Sir quod sir Wyllyam / if they have rydden / it
has been to your honor and profit. They have taken towns and castles / and
over rydden the country of your enemies / almost to Ceuyll / which was an
honorable enterprise. They ought not to lose their times / nor also they would
not lose it by their wyls. ser / at our return / they say they will pay
themself / without they have some gracious answer of you: other than they
have had hyderto. Well quod the king / within.xv. days at the farthest / they
shall be paid every penny. But say unto therle of Ca^bridge / that I will he the
and speak with me. sir quod the knight / ye say well I shall do your
commandment. And so the king went to dinner / and made the^ to dyne with him
at his own table. and so passed that day / and the next day they returned to
their company. And as soon as it was known they were come home / their
company resorted to the^ / to know what tydinges they had brought. and they
showed the^ / all the kings words / so that they were content. Losirs quod
Soltier / ye may se well / sometime riot both good. We have well aduau^sed
forth our payment with a little wyldnesse / he does ever well that is feared.
Than these three knight^es went to therle of Cambridge / and showed him how
they had sped. and how the king would / he should come and speak with him at
Lysbone. and so therle deperted the next day / and rode to Lisbone. and there he
was received of his son and his daughter right amiably. And there the king and
he made a certain poyntment to ride forth. Than the king made his somo^s
through his realm / every man to be in field / between Ueryous and Clemens /
the.vii. day of June. And so every man made him ready to be at the said place /
the day before lymited. at the coming of therle to Lysbone / sir Johan Ferand
was delivered out of prison. Than therle took his leave and returned to his
company / and showed the^ of the poyntme^t / whereof every man was glad. and
anon after cae money to pay their wages and so they were al paid and content /
capitayns and other: but always they kept up still the penon of saint George.

How the kings of Castle and of Portyngale assembled their puyssau^ces. and
how peace was made between them / against the will of thenglyshmen. Cap. CCC.
xCiiii.
King Johan of Castyle all this season gadered togider his men of war out of
France / and other places. So that he had a two thousand spears knights and
squyers / and four thousand of other / beside them of his own country / whereof
he had well a ten thousand a horsbacke and as many a foot. When he knew how
the king of Portingale would ride / he ordained y^ more honorably to use his
war. seeing y^ he knew him self p^yssant both of money and of men. And so
sent to the king of Portyngale / demau^dyng of him / to deliver a certain pese
of land in Portyngale / where as they might de^myne battle / puyssaunce
against puyssaunce. And if he resused so to do / than he to offer to deliver
him the same in Spain. The kings haralde had the charge to go with this
message / and so he rode to Lysbon and there did his message. The king than
answered the haralde / and said. how he would take advise in this matter /
which way he would take. And when he were detmyned: than he promised to send
word there of to the king of Spain. Than the haralde departed again to
Ceuyll / and there he found the king / and they of France / of Aragon / and
of Galyce / who were as than all come to the king And there he showed his
answer / so that every man was well content. And it was not long after / but
that the king of Portyngale / by the advise that he had of the Englysshemen /
that he should deliver a certain place to do battle / in his own country.
And than there was ordained / such as should go and a view a place
conuenyent. And so for that intent went forth sir Thomas Simon and the
souldiche of Lestra^: and they advised a place bitwene Clues and ^ale de Lore /
which was a fair plain place to fyghton. And these two knights and their
company / had a scrimysshe as they went to advise this place / with some of y^
foreryders of the king of Castyls: and there were diverse hurt and slain on
both parties. And so finally / they returned to the king of Portyngale / and
showed him / how they had aduysed the place / and where it was / wherewith
every man was well content. Than the king ordained a knight of Almayne * named
sir Johan Custodore / to go to the king of Castyle on that message / and an
haralde with him. And so they departed and rode to Ceuyll / and there did their
message. Showing him how he should have place delivered him / bitwene Clues
and Ualede lore. And that within five days after he departed fro ^cuyll / he
should find the king of Portyngale there ready / to give him battle. saying /
now he desired nothing else. Of these tidings the spanyerdes were right
joyful / and also the french men. And there the knights of Spaygne took the
messangers of Portyngale and made them great chere all that day / and held
them as good company as they could. and the next day brought them to Jafreys /
and than returned. And the messangers returned to the king of Portyngale /
and showed him / how they had done their message / and the answer that they
had. Wherewith the king was well content and all the other.

It was not long after / but that the king of Portyngale went and lodged him
and his host / about the same place before aduysed / between Clues and Uale
delore / in a fair plain among the olyues / and he was to the no^bre of.xv.
thousandemen. And the fourth day after / thither came the earl of Cambridge
with the english men in good order / and they were in nombre * a six hundred
men of arms and as many archers / and so they lodged themself ioyninge to the
kings company. And when the king of Spain knew / that the king of
Portyngale was lodged in the field / where as the battle should be. he made
semblant / as though he had be glad thereof and said. Let us go forth / our
enemies abides us / it is time that we ride. We desired of them the battle /
and they acorded to us and so they kept their promise / as they made. It can
be none otherwise: but y^ we shall have battle / let us draw thyderwarde.
Than it was commanded / that every man should go forward. And so they
departed out of their logynges all knights and squyers / geneuoys and
genetours: and all followed the kyuges baner. And so he went and lodged within
two little miles / of the place appointed. The king of Castyle with the
genetours / was to the nombre of threscore thousand men.

THus in this manner these two hosts lay the one before the other / and between
the^ the hill and the town of Uale de lore / parteynyng to the king of Spain.
and thither resorted his men / when they list to refresshe them. and the city
of Clues was on the other part of the hill / perteyning to the king of
Portyngale. Between these two hosts and the mountain / there was done daily
deeds of arms / by young knights and bachelors / desyring to auau^ce
themself. This they continued the space of.xv. days or more. The faut was not
in the king of Castle that they had no battle / but it was rather in y^ king
of Portyngale. For he saw well he was not strong enough to fight with the
spaynierdes / and so douted the parell that might fall. For he saw well if he
were there disco^fyted / his realm were lost / for ever fro him. And also / all
that season: he looked ever after the coming of the duke of Lancastre and his
company out of England. For he had promised to bring with him / a four
thousand men of arms / and as many archers. For the earl of Cambridge had
certifyed y^ king of Portyngale / that he would come. And he thought not the
contrary / but that he would have come. For the duke of Lancaster at the
beginning / when he departed out of England / promised him by his faith. That
as soon as he were returned out of Scotland / that he would incontinent come
into Portyngale / with such a nombre: as to be able to fight with the king of
Spaygne. And true it was / the duke of Lancastre did all that he might to keep
his promise. But because of the trouble y^ had been the same year in England /
and for certain other incydentes that had fallen in Flanders. The king of
England nor his counsel / would not suffer him to deperte out of England
For they would not consent to the voyage in to Portyngale / at that time. Nor
that any men of war should go out of England. And when the king of
Portyngale saw / that he could have none other conforte of the englisshmen /
than he thought to seek another way. Than y^ master of Castrane / and Da^peter
of Modesque / the bishop of Bruges / and the bishop of Lysbon. These
entreated for a peace / between Portyngale and Spain: and so much they did /
that a peace was taken. But the englysshmen were never called thereto / wherewith
therle of Cambridge was sore displeased. And would gladly have made war
against the king of Portyngale / if he had thought him self strong enough in
the country / but he was natso. therefore it behooved him to suffer this peace /
whider he would or not. But thenglysshmen said / how that the king of
Portyngale / had right yuell delte with them. For ever sith the beginning to
the endyng / he ever dissymuled with the spanyerdes / and had never will to
fight with the^. And the king of Portyngale excused him self and said. How
the fault was in the englysshemen and in y^ duke of Lancastre / who should have
come and did not. Wherefore he could do none otherwise / but to take peace.

How the king of Spaygne was married again / to the king of Portyngales
daughter. Cap. CCC. xCv.
IN the king of Castyls host / there was a young knight of France / called
sir Trystram de Roy. Who desired greatly to auau^ce his honor / when he law
the peace was made bitwene y^ two kings / and that there should be no battle.
Than he determined not to go out of Spayn / till he had done some deed of
arms. Than he send on haralde in to thenglysshe host / requyryng all
knights and squyers / sith the bataile failed between the two kings. That
some knight or squier would answer him / three courses with a spear / before
the cite of Uale delore. When these tidings came in to the english host.
The knights and squyers spoke toguyder / and said. how his offer ought not to
be refused. Than a young squire of England / called Miles Wyndsore: who would
for his hono^ be made knight in that vyage. Said unto the haralde. Friend /
return to your master / and say to sir Trystram de Roy. that Miles Wynsore
sends him word / that to morrow next / before the cite of Uale de Lore / he
shall there deliver him of his desire. The haralde returned and recorded those
tidings to his masters. and sir Tristram was right ioyouse. The next morning
/ Miles Wyndsore departed out of the field / and rode to ward the cite of Uale
de Lore / which was not far of. He had no more but the mountain to pass /
and he was well a companyed. There was with him sir Mathue Courney / sir Wyllyam
Beauchampe / sir Thomas Simon / the Souldyche of Lestrate / the lord of
Newcastell / the lord de la Barde / and diverse other. There was well a hundred
knights and squiers at y^ place / where as the battle should be between them.
And also than / thither came sir Trystram de Roy / well acompanyed with french
men and bretons. There Miles Wyndsore was made knight / by the hands of the
Souldyche of Lestrade. As of him y^ was reputed the best knight in that
company. Thus these two knights were armed at all pieces / and well horsed with
their spears ready in their hands. And so they ran each at other and brake
their spears / each upon other rudely / without any other hurt. and than they
ran their second course. And at y^ third course / they struck each other so
rudely / in the mids of their sheldes / that the spear heedes entered
through the plates of their harnes / to the bare flesh / but they had no
hurt. and their spears brake / and the tron ^hyons flewe over their heedes in
to the air. This course was praised of all them that saw it. And than they
took leave each of other right honorablye / and returned every manne to his
own party. And after there was no more war used for there was peace between
both realms And so eycher party departed and went home.

THus this army brake up. In the same time / tidings came in to the king of
Spaynes host. How the king of Granade made great war against the king of
Barbary and the king of Train samayns. Wherefore all such knights as would go
thider / should be received in to wages. And that the king of Granade would
send sure save conduct for the^ / and that as soon as they become in to Granade
/ they should have pressed wages for a quarter of a year before hand. Whereby
certain knights of France / as sir Trystram de Roy / sir Geffray Carney /
sir Peter Cleremo^t / and diverse other took leave of the king of Castyle / and
went thither to seek adventures. And in likewise / so did some of the english
men / but not many. For therle of Cambridge brought them home again into
England: and his son also. where by it showed well / that he was not content
with the king of Portyngale: to take a way his son from him / for all that he
had married the kings daughter. He said / how that his son could not
endure the air of the country. For all that ever the king could say or do /
the earl would not leave him behind him. But said to the king / that his son
was to young to abide in Portingale. wherefore it fell after / as ye shall here.
About a year after that this peace was thus made / between Spayn and Portyngale
and that the earl of Cambridge was returned in to England. The queen of
Castyle dyed / who was daughter to the king of Aragon. and so than the king of
Spain was a wydower. Than it was debated by the prelates and lords of both
countries / Spain and Portyngale / that the lady Beatryce of Portigale / could
not be more higher married thanne to the king of Spain. And to bring these two
realms in a full accord and peace / the king of Portyngale agreed to ye
marriage. and deuorsed his daughter fro the earl of Cambridge son / by the
popes dispensacion: who co^fyrmed this new marriage. Thus the king of
Portyngales daughter was made queen of Spaygne / of Castyle / and of Galyce.
And the first year of the king of Spaynes marriage / he had by his wife a fair
son / whereof they gad great joy. Than after dyed Ferrande king of
Portyngale. howbeit for all that / they of Portingale would not suffer the
realm to come to the king of Spain / as in the right of his wife. But they
made king / a bastard brother of the Kings dysceassed / who was called before
master Denis / bastard of Portyngale. This Denis was a right valyant man in
arms / and always before / bare the arms of Portigale. So thus he was
crouned king / whereby after grew much war / between Spain and Portyngale.
as ye shall here after in this book.

WHau therle of Cambridge and his company / were returned in to the realm of
England. The king and the duke of Lancastre made them great chere / as it was
reason: and demanded of them tidings. And there they showed all the manner of
the war. The duke of Lancastre / to whom the matere most touched / because
of the challenge that he made to the realm of Castyle. For he named him self
(as heir thereof) by the right and tytell of his wife: the lady Custaunce /
sometime daughter to Dompeter / king of Castle. Therefore he demanded of his
brother the earl of Ca^bridge / how they had demeaned them self in
Portyngale. Therle showed him / how ye two kings had layen in host / more
than fyftene days: the one before the other. And fair brother / because the
king of Portyngale could here no word fro you / he lightly accorded to ye
peace. And we could never se / ye ever he would co^discende to battle. Whereof
we that were on his party were sore dyspleased / for we would gladly have put
it at adventure. And sir / because I can se no sure a state nor trust in them
/ therefore I have brought again with me my son for all that he has married
the kings daughter. Sir (...) the duke / I think ye had good cause: saving
for fear of breakyng of that marriage. For paraduenture if the king may find
/ any aduau^tage in another place / he will than give his daughter at his
pleasure. By my faith sir quod therle / hap what will. I think I have done
nothing / whereof I should repent me. and so than they entered in to other
communycation of other matters.

Now let us leave to speak of them and of the wars of Spain and
Portyngale. And return to the wars of Gaunte / and of the Earl and country
of Flaunders / which were right feirse and cruel.

Of the great necessyte of vytales / that they of Gau^t endured. and how they
were socoured by the^ of Liege. Cap. CCC. xCvi.
ALl the season / after the destruction and brinnyng of the town of Grauntmont
/ and of ye reysyng of the siege of Gaunt. by cause of the displeasure ye the
earl of Flaunders had / for the death of his cosyn / the young lord of
Dangheyn. slain by the enbusshment of the gauntoyse (as ye have herd here
before) The knights and squiers / nor good towns / made no war to the^
Gau^t: but by garrisons. so ye all the country held with the earl / against
Gaunt: except the four mestiers / and so by them / some vytayle came in to
Gaunte. And some vitayle ca^e in to Gaunt out of the county of Alos / but the
earl of Flanders / as soon as he knew that / he found remedy. For
inco^tynent / he sent to the garyson of Teremo^t / co^mau^dyng them to ouerryn
and to brenne / all the plain country of the county of Alos: which was done
at his co^maundment. so that the poor folks with their beasts / were feign
to fly a way in to Brabant / and in to Haynalte. and the most part to go a
beggyng. yet there was a country parteynyng to the four mestiers / fro whom
there came ever some aid or vitayle into Gaunt. Thus all this winter the earl
and they of Flanders / constrained so sore them of Gaunt / that they could
have nothing come to them / another by land nor by water. The earl had so won
his cosyns / the duke of Brabant and duke Aubert / that their countries were
kept close against them of Gaunt. so that nothing came to the^ fro thens /
without it were by stelth. and by great adventure and parell / for the^ that
did it. The sage men said: how it could not long endure / but ye they must
dye for famyne. for all their garners were void / and the people could get
no breed for no money. And when any breed was baken in the town / they were
feign to keep it by strong hand. or else the common people that dyed for hunger
/ would have taken it byforce. It was great pity to se and to here the poor
people / both men / women / and children. ye / such as were right notable /
fell in this danger. And every day increased the complayntes / wepynges / and
cries / made to Phylyp Dartuell / their sovereign captain. Who had of them
great pytie and compassyon / and made many good orders: whereof he was greatly
praised. For he caused the garners of the abbeys to be opened and of rich men
/ and set a reasonable price of the corn / whereby the town was greatly
conforted. and some corn there came to them by stelthe / out of Holande and
zelande / and tonnes full of flower and bysket breed / the which greatly
conforted them. for they had been long discomfyted before / if they had not
been comforted by these said countries. It was defended in all Brabant by the
duke / ye on pain of death / they should carry any thing to Gaunt / but if they
of Gaunt would ieoparde to fetch any. tha^ they might give them or sell to
them at their pleasure. And when ye time of lent came / than were they in great
dystresse / for they had no lenton stuff. Than there departed out of the town
a.xii. thousand of sowdyers / and such as had nothing to live by / but were
overcome with famyne. And so they came to the town of Brusels / the town
closed their gates against them / for they feared them / they knew not their
thoughts. Whan^e they were nere to Brusels / they send a certain of their
company unarmed to the gate of the town / and there they desired them of the
town / for godsake to have pytie of them / as to suffer them to have vitayle
for their money. Saying / how they dyed for hunger. And swear / how they
thought none yuell too them / nor to the country about. The good men of
Brusels had pytie on the^ / and brought them vytayle for their money. and so
they passed their time about in the country / the space of three wekes but they
could enter in to no good town. And so they came to Louayn / who had pytie on
them / and did them much good and refresshyng. Their captain and leader was
Frau^ces Atreman / he made the treaties for the^ with the good towns. And in
this season while they of Gaunt lay in the marches of Louayne / their captain
spoke with the masters of the city of Lyege / and they had compassyon on
them. and so had the bishop of Liege / sir Arnolde Darcle. and promised them
to send to the earl of Flaunders / and to do so much / as to make their peace
/ saying unto the^. A ye good men of Gaunt / if the country of Lyege were as
nere to you as Brabant is / or Haynalte. ye should be otherwise comforted by us
/ than ye be by them / to maynteyne your fraunches. How beit / we shall aid
you as much as we may. We will that ye that be merchants and use
marchandyse / may go and come through the country / as it is reason: to the
so^me of five or sire hundred carts / laded with corn / so that the owners of
the corn may be truly paid therefore. they will suffer our marchaundyse to
pass through Brabant they and we are at a peace. And though it be so that
Brusels be closed / we know it well / it is more for fear / than for any
yuell will: for they have of you great co^passyon. but the duke of Brabant and
ye duches / at the desire of their cosyn the earl of Flaunders / inclyneth
rather to his part than to yours: as it is reason. for all ways great lords
will hold each with other. Of these offers and love that the legeoyse offered
to the gauntoyse / they were thereof greatly reioysed / and thanked them hertlye
/ and said: how of such people and friends / the gauntoyse had great need.

FRaunces Atreman and the burgesses of Gaunt / yt were in the cite of Liege.
took leave of ye masters of Liege / who ordained certain men / to go with them
in to the country / to get them chares. and so in two days they had a six
hundred charged with corn / whereof they had most need. And so they went
forth with their caryage / and passed between Louayn and Brusels. And whan^e
Fraunces Atreman came to his company / he showed them the love and courtesy /
ye they of Liege had offered them. and offers yet to do. and moreover he said
/ how he would go to Brusels to speak with the duches of Brabant / and to
desire her / to find some means / how the good town of Gaunt might have
peace with the earl of Flaunders. And so he sent unto her to know her pleasure
/ and she was content / that he should come and speak with her / and so he
went to Brusels. The same time the duke of Brabant was at Lusenburge. And so
this Frau^ces and three with him entered in to Brusels / and so came to the
duches to her lodgyng at Coleberge. The duches had part of her counsel about
her. Than Fraunces Atreman kneled down before her / and said. Right honorable
and dear lady: through your benygne grace. may it please you / to have pity and
compassion of the^ of Gaunt / who can come to no mercy / with the earl of
Flaunders: by no means. right dear lady / if by your means: ye could cause my
lord therle to discende to some reason. and to have pytie of these poor men
of Gaunt: ye should do herin a great alms deed. and madame / they of Liege
would gladly help thereto: to the best of their powers. Than the lady answered
right humbly / and said. How that the discencyon / between her cosyn the earl
and them of Gaunt: displeased her right greatly. and how that long or that
time / she would gladly there had been a peace between them. if she could have
found any means how. But also she said. A ye sirs of Gaunt / ye have so often
times displeased him / and have holden so marvelous opynio^s against him.
which has caused him to sustain still his displeasur against you. howbeit for
goddessake / and for pytie / I shall enploy me herin / to do the best I can. I
shall send to him. desyring / that he will come to Tourney / and there shall
be my counsel. and do you somoche / that ye may have there the counsel of
Haynalte and of Liege (as ye say they will) ye truly madame quod he so they
have promised us. well quod the duches / and ye shall se that I shall do the
best I can. Madame quod they god reward you / both bodily and gostly. and so
took their leave and departed fro Brusels / and so came to their company and
chariotes / who tarried for the^. And than they did so much that they came to
their town of Gaunt.

When the tydinges came to Gau^t / that their men were returned / and had
brought with them / mo than six hundred chares with vytayle / they were right
joyful. howbeit all y^ they brought / would not suffyse the town of Gaunt /
the space of.xv. days yet to them y^ were disconforted / it was a great
comfort. And so there went against this carriage much people in manner of
processyon / and kneled and held up their hands too the merchants that
brought it / sayng. A ye good people: ye have done great alms / thus to
conforte the mean people of Gaunt. who had nothing to live by / if ye had not
come. First / laud and praise be to god / and than to you. And so these chares
were conveyed in to the market place / and there discharged. and so this corn
was divided and delivered by weightes to them y^ had most need. And so / five
thousand of them of Gaunt / conveyed again these chares into Brabant out of
danger. All this knew well the earl of Flaunders / being at Bruges. And
knew well they of Gaunt were so sore constrained that they could not long
endure. He was nothing sorry of their poverty. no more were his counsel / who
would gladly have seen the distruccyon of the town / as Gylberte Mahewe and
his brethern / with other. All this fell in the lent / in the monethe of March
and April / the year of our lord god / a thousand three hundred fourscore and
one. The earl of Flaunders was in purpose to come more puissantly / than ever
he did to lay sieg before Gaunt. and was determined to enter on the four
mestiers / and to brinne all before him / because they had aided Gaunt with
vytayle. The earl sent his mind and intent to all the good towns of Flanders
/ co^maundyng them to be ready. for ye processyon day ones past at Bruges / he
said: he would depart to go and lay siege before Gaunt. and also / he wrote to
all knights and squiers that held of him in Heynalt / that they should be with
him at Bruges within.viii. days after.

The hard answer / that the earl of Flaunders made to the^ of Gaunt. And of
the nombre of men of arms that were than at Paris in France. Cap. CCC. xCvii.
FOr all the somons that therle of Flaunders made. yet the duches of Brabant /
and the duke Aulbert / and the bysshope of Liege / traueyled so much with
therle / that a day was let that their counsel should mete / to treat for a
peace / in the city of Tourney. Though the earl were loathe thereto. yet at the
desire of these lords / he a greed to have a counsel for that matter in the
cite of Tourney / ye weke after Ester. The year of our lord a thousand three.
C.lxxx. and two / and to be there himself. At this day assigned / thither came
the bishop of Lyege / and of the good towns to the nombre of.xii. and sir
Lambert of Perney a rightsage knight. Also the duches of Brabant / sent thither
ye most notablest persons of her counsel / and certain of every good
town. Also duke Albert sent thither out of the county of Haynalte his
counsel / as sir Simon de la Layne his baylife and diverse other. All these
came to Tourney in Ester weke / and they of Gaunt sent thither.xii. notable
persons / whereof Phylippe Dartuell was chyfe. and all they of Gaunt were a
greed / whatsoever end these. ^ii. made / so that none of them should suffer
death. If it pleased ye earl / they were content to be banyssehd Gaunt / and
the cou^tie of Flanders forever. and so here upon they were concluded. and
Philippe Dartuell had so much pytie of the common people / that for all the
dyspleasure that he had done to the earl. yet he was content to put him self
into the Earls mercy. And so when he departed fro Gau^t to go to Tourney / men
/ women / and children fell down on their knees before him: holdyng up their
hands. de syring him / what soever myschefe they endured / that he would bring
them peace. of the which cry he had such pytie / that he was determined to do
as it is showed before.

When they of Liege / of Heynalt / and of Brabant / had been in Tourney the
space of three days / after ye day appointed was past. And saw that the earl
came not / nor was not coming / they had great marueyle and than took counsel
together / and determined to send to Brusels to him: and so they did. and they
sent to him ser Lambert of Perney / and of Brabant ye lord of Compelant / and
of Haynalt sir Willyam of Herman / and six burgesses of the three countries.
And when the earl saw these three knights he made the^ great chere: as it was
reason. and when he knew their message / he answered them: how it was not his
ease to come to Tourney as at that time / how beit he said because they were
come / and traueyled to have him to Tournay / and for ye honor of such as
were come thither / and at the instance of my lady of Brabant his suster / and
of duke Aulbert his cosyn / and the bishop of Liege. he said: he was content
to send hastily to Tourney a fynall answer / by some of his counsel. These
three knights could have non other answer of him: as at that time. and so
they returned again to Tournay / and showed how the earl answered them. And
a six days after there came to Tourney from the earl / the lord of Rasels /
and the lord of Gountris / and sir Johan Wylliam / and the provost of
Harlequebec. and they excuse therle / because he came not. and than they
declared the earls full intent as touching ye peace / sayng how they of Gau^t
can have no peace with the earl / without y^ they will generally / all manner of
men in Gau^t of the ages bytwen.xv. and.lx. come out of the town of Gau^t in
theirshyrtes / bare heeded with halters about their necks / and so mete the
earl between Bruges and Gaunt. and the earl to do with them his pleasure /
outher to let the^ live or to put them all to death at his pleasure. When this
answer was made / and the relacyon thereof declared to them of Gaunt / by the
counsayls of these three countries. Than they were more abashed than ever they
were before. Than the baylyfe of Heynalte said / to them. Sirs: ye be in great
parell / every man take heed to himself. I think if ye take this way / and
put yourselfe at his will. he will not put all to death / that he seyth in his
presens. paraduenture some he will / as such as has displeased him more tha^
other. I think he shall have such means of pytie / that paraduenture such
as weneth them self to be most in parell / may hap to come to pardon and
mercy. therefore sirs / I would counsel you take this offer: and refuse it
not. for if ye do I thynk it will be long / or ye recover again such a
another offer. Sir quod Phylip Dartwell we have no such charge to go so far / as
to bring the good people of Gaunt in to y^ point. for I ensure you / they will
not so do. For sir: when we be come again to Gaunt / and have showed them
therles pleasur. know for troth they will not do it. If they will / I ensure
you / they shall not be let for us. sir we thank you for the traueyle and good
dyligence / that ye have ho^d in this matter. And so than they of Gaunt took
the^ leave of y^ cou^sayls of these three countries / and made well semblant
that they would in no wise agree to this purpose. and so departed and returned
to Gaunt / through Brabant.

SO thus brake up this counsel at Tour nay / and every man went home. Than
therle of Flaunders demanded what answer they of Gaunt made / and it was
showed him. The earl as than set little prise by them / for he knew well /
they hadd endured and suffered so much / that they could nere suffer no
longar. wherefore he thought he should have shortly an honorable end of the
war. and to bring Gaunt in to that point / y^ all other towns should take
ensample by it. The same season y^ commons of Paris began again to murmr /
because the king came not thither. and they feared lest the king would have
come suddenly on the^ / with a certain men of war / and ouerryn the city. and
to have put to death whom he had list. And for dought of that parell / they
made great watch every night / in the streets and market places / and raised
up their cheynes: y^ no man should ride nor enter in among them. and if any
person were found abroad after.ix. of the clock / without he were well
known among them / he was but deed. So they were in Paris rich men and other
men of arms / to the nombre of.xxx. thousand / as well harnessed at all pieces
/ as any knight ought to be. And also they had servants right well harnessed
/ bearing great malettes of iron and stele / to confound helmes. And when
they were nombred and viewed / they thought themself able to fight with the
greatest prince in all the world. These people were called the rowtes and
malettes of Paris.

How that a five thousand gau^toyse issued out of Gaunt / to fight with
therle / and with them of Bruges / after the answer that Phylip Dartuell had
showed them. Cap. CCC. xCviii.
When Phylip Dartuell and his company: entered again in to Gaunt. A great
nombre of the common people desyring nothing but peace / were right joyful of
their coming / trusting to here some good tidings. they came against him /
and could not restrain: but demanded tidyn ges / sayng. a dear sir Phylip
Dartuell / rejoice us with some good word: let us know how ye have sped. to
which demaundes Phylippe gave none answer / but passed by / holding down
his heed. the more he held his peace / the more the people followed him /
precyng to here some tydinges. and ones or twice as he rode to his lodging
ward / he said to them that followed him. sirs: return to your houses / for
this day god aid you / and to morrow at.ix. of the clock / come into the
market place / and than ye shall here y^ tydinges that I can show you. other
answer could they have none of him / whereof every man was greatly abashed.
And when Phylippe Dartuell was alighted at his lodging / and such as had been
at Tourney with him: and every man gone to their own lodgings. Than Peter de
boyse / who desired to here some tydinges. came in y^ euenyng to Phylyps house.
and so than they two went together in to a chamber. than Peter demanded of him
how he had spedde. and Phylippe who would hyde nothing fro him / said. By my
faith Peter / by that therle of Flaunders has answered / by his counsel sent
to Tourney. He will take no manner of person within the town of Gau^t to mercy
/ no more one thanne another. By my faith quod Peter / to say the truth / he
does but right to do so. he is well counsayled to be of that opynion / for
they be all perte takers / as well one as another. Now the matter is come even
after mine intent. And also it was the intent of my good master / John^ Lion
that is deed. for now y^ town will be so trowbled / that it will he hard
ever to apease it again. Now it is time to take bridell in the tethe. Now it
shall be seen / who is sage and who is hardye / in the town of Gaunt. Outher
shortly the town of Gaunt / shall be the most honored town in christendom
/ or else the most desolate. At the leest / if we dye in this quarrel / we
shall not dye all alone. therefore Philyp / remember your self well this night
/ how ye may make relacyon to morrow to the people / of the determynacion of
your counsel holden now at Tourney. and that ye may show it in such manner
y^ the people may be content with you. For ye have all ready y^ grace of the
people / for two causes. One / is because of your name / for sometime Jakes Dart
well yor father / was maruelusly well beloved. The other cause is / ye entreat
y^ people mekely and sagely / as the common sayng is through out the town.
wherefore the people will believe you to live or dye. And at the end show them
your counsel / and say how ye will do thus and thus / and they will all
say the same. therefore it behooves you to take good aduyce / in showing words
/ whereon lies your honor. Truly quod Philyppe ye say truth / and I trust
so to speak and show the besynes of Gau^t. That we / who are now governors
and capitayns / shall outher live or dye with honor. So thus they departed for
that night each fro other. Peter de boyse went home to his house / and Philyp
Dartuell abode still in his

yE may well know and believe / yt when the day desired was come / that Philyp
Dartuell should generally report the effect of the counsel / holden at
Tourney. All y^ people of the town of Gau^t / drew them to the market place /
on a wednisday in the morning. And about.ix. of the bell / Philyp Dartuell /
Peter de Boyse / Pe^ de myrt / Frau^ces Atreman and the other capitayns came
thither / and entered up in to the common hall. Than Philyp leaned out at a
wyndowe / and began to speak / and said. O all ye good people / it is of
troth: that at the desire of the right honorable lady / my lady of Brabante /
and the right noble duke Aulbert / baylife of Heynalt / Holande / and zelande /
and of my lord the bishop of Liege. There was a counsel agreed and accorded
to be at Tournay / and there at to be personally therle of Flanders. And so he
certyfyed to these said lords / who have nobly aquited themself. For they
sent thither right notable cou^saylours / and knights and burgesses of good
towns. And so they and we of this good town of Gau^t / were there at y^ day
assigned. lokyng and abiding for the earl of Flaunders / who came not nor would
not come. and when they saw that he came not nor was not coming. Than^e they
sent to him to Bruges / three knights for the three countries / and burgesses
for y^ good towns. and they traueyled so much for our sakes / that they went
to him to Bruges / and there they found him / who made the^ great chere (as
they said) and hard well their message. but he answered the^ and said. that
for the honor of their lords / and for the love of his suster the lady of
Brabant (he said) He would send his counsel to Tourney / with in five or
six days after. so well instructed by him / that they should plainly show
the full of his entencyon / and mind. Other answer could they none have /
and so they returned a gain to us to Tourney. and than the day assygned by
therle / there came fro him to Tourney / the lord of Ranessels / the lord of
Goutris sir Johan Uillayns / and the provost of Harlequebec. And there they
showed graciously their lords will / and certain arest of this war. how
the peace might be had * between the earl and the town of Gaunt. First /
determynatly they said. therle will y^ every man in the town of Gaunt / except
prelates of churches and religions. all that be above the age of.xv. year * and
under the age of.lx. that they all in their shirtes bare heeded and bare foted
/ with haulters about their necks / avoid the town of Gaunt. And so go
a.xii. mile thens / in to the plain of Burlesquans. And there they shall mete
the Earl of Flaunders / acompanyed with such as it shall please him. And so
wha^ he seyth us in that case holdyng up our hands / and cryeng for mercy.
than he shall have pytie and compassyon on us if it please him. But sirs / I
can not know / by the relacion of any of his counsel / but that by shameful
punycion of justice. there shall suffer death / the most part of the people /
that shall appear there that day. Now sirs / consider well if ye will come to
peace by this means or not. When Philyp Dartuell had spoken these words / it
was great pytie to se: men / women / and children weep / and wring their hands
for love of their fathers / brethren / husbands / and neighbors. And after
this tourme^t and noise / Philyp Dartuell began again to speak / and said.
Pease sirs pease. and in contynent / every man was still. Than he began to
speak / and said. A ye good people of Gaunt / ye be her now assembled the
most part / and ye have hard what I have said. Sirs / I se none other
remedy but short counsel. for ye know well / what necessyte we be in for
lack of vitayle. I am sure there be.xxx. thousand in this town / that did
eat no breed this. ^v. days passed / sirs: of three things we must of
necessyte do the one. The first is / if ye will let us enclose ourselfe in this
town / and mure up all our gates. and tha^ confess us clean to god / and
let us enter into the churches and misters / and so let us dye for famyn
repe^tant of our sins / like martyrs. and such people as no man will have
mercy of / yet in this a state god shall have mercy of our souls. and it
shall be said / in every place where it shall be herd / that we be deed
valyauntly / and like true people. Or else secondly / let us all men / women /
and children: go with halters about our necks in our shyrtes / and cry mercy
to my lord the earl of Flaunders. I think his heart will not be so indurate
(as when he seyth us in that a state) but that his heart will molefy / and take
mercy of his people. and as for my self / I will be the first of all / to a
pease his displeasure. I shall present my heed / and be content to dye / for
them of Gaunt. Or else thyrdly let us chose out in this town five or six
thousand men / of the most able and best appointed / and let us go hastily and
assail the earl at Bruges / and fight with him. and if we dye in this voyage.
At the least / it shall be honorable / and god shall have pytie of us. and all
the world shall say / that valiantly and truly / we have kept and maynteyned
our quarrel. And in this battle / if god will have pytie of us / as aunciantly
he put his puissance in to ye hands of Nabugodonosor / duke and master of his
chyualry. by whom the assyrience were discomfyted. Than shall we be reputed
the most honorable people / that has raygned sith the days of the romans.
Now sirs / take good head which of these three weyes ye will take / for one of
the^ must ye needs take. Than such as were next him / and had hard him best
said. A ser / all we have our trust in you to counsel us. and sir / look as
ye counsel us / so shall we follow. By my faith quod Philyppe / than I
counsel you: let us go with an army of men against the earl / we shall find
him at Bruge. And as soon as he shall know of our coming / he will issue out
to fight with us / by the pride of them of Bruges / and of such as be about
him / who night and day enfourmeth and styreth him to fight with us. And if
god will by his grace / that we have the victory / and disconfyte our enemies.
than shall we be recovered forever / and the most honored people of the
world. and if we be disconfyted / we shall dye honorably and god shall have
pity of us. and thereby all the other people in Gaunt / shall escape. and the
earl will have marcy on them. and therwt they all answered with one vocye. we
will do thus / we will do thus. we will make none other end. Than Philyppe
answered / and said. Sirs / if it be your wylles to do thus / than return
home to your howses / and make ready your harness. for to morrow sometime of the
day / I will that we depart out of Gaunt / and go toward Bruges / for the
abiding here / is nothing for us profitable. and within five days / we shall
know if we shall dye or live with honor. and I shall send the constables of
every parysshe / fro house to house / to chose out the most able and best
appointed men.

IN this a state every man departed out of the market place / and made the^
ready. and this wednysday they kept ye town so close / that another man nor
woman entered / nor issued out of the town / till the thursday in the morning /
that every man was ready / such as should depart. And they were to the nombre
of.v. thousand men and not past / and they had with them two hundred chares of
ordinance / and artyllary / and but.vii. carts of vitayle / five of bysket
breed / and two tonne of wine / for in all they had but two tonne / and left
no more behynd them in the town. This was a hard departing / and they that
were left behind / were hardly bestadde. It was pytie to behold them that
went forth. And they that abode behind said to them. sirs / now at your
departure / ye know what ye leave behind you / but never think to come hyder
again / without ye come with honor, for if it be otherwise / ye shall find
here no thing. For as soon / as we here tidings / that ye be outher slain
or disconfytted. we shall set the town a fire / and distroy ourselfe like
people dispayred. Than they yt went forth / said to comfort them. sirs: pray
to god for us / for we trust / he shall help us and you also / or we return
again. Thus these five thousand deperted fro Gaunt / with their small
prouysion. and that thursday they went and lay a mile without Gaunt / and brake
not up their prouisyon / but passed y^ night / with such things as they found
abroad in the country. And the friday they went forth / not touching as yet
their vitayle. for the fore^gers found somewhat in the country / wherewith they
passed that day. And so lodged a seuyn mile fro Bruges / and there rested and
took a place of ground at their deuyse / abiding their enemies. And before
them there was a great plasshe of standing water / wherewith they fortifyed
theymselfe on the one part / and on the other part with their caryages. And
so they passed that night.

Of the order of the battle of the gauntoise / and how they disco^fited the
earl and them of Bruges / and by what means. Cap. CCCxCix.
ANd wha^ it came to the saturday in ye morning / the weder was fair and clear
and a holyday called in Bruges for that day of custom they made processyo^s.
Than tydinges ca^e to them / how ye gauntoyse were come thither. And than ye
should have seen great murmuringes in Bruges / so that at last / word thereof
ca^e to therle and to his company. Whereof the earl had great marueyle / and
said. Behold yonder ungracious people of Gaunt. I trow the devil has
brought them to their destruction. Now is the time come to have an end of
this war. And so thanne his knights and squyers came to him / and he
received them graciously. and said to them. We shall go and fight with yonder
unhappy people of Gaunte. yet quod the Earl / they had rather dye by the sword
/ than by famyne. Than the earl was counsayled to send three men of arms in to
the field / to se the demeanoure of his enemies. And so than the marshall of
Flaunders appointed out three squyers / valiant men of arms / to go and se the
behauyng of the gau^toyse. As Lambert of Lambres / Damas of Buffey / and Johan
of Beart. And so they three departed fro Bruges / and rode toward their
enemies. And in the mean time / while these three went forth: they of Bruges
made them ready to issue out / to go and fight with the gauntoyse. Of whom I
shall show / so^what of their order.

THis saturday in the morning. Phyllyppe Dartuell ordained and commanded /
that every man should make him ready to god. And caused masses to be song in
diverse places / by certain freers that were with him. And so every man
confessed him / and prayed to god for grace and mercy. And there were certain
sermons made / enduryng an hour and an half. And there it was shewedde to
people / by these freers and clerks / figurynge them to the people of Israel
/ whom king Pharaon kept long in seruytude. And how after / by ye grace of
god they were delivered / and led in to the land of Behest / by Moses and
Aaron. And king Pharaon and the Egypciens slain and taken. In likewise quod
these freers / ye good people. ye be kept inseruytude / by your lord the earl
of Flaunders / and by your neighbors of Bruges. Before whom now ye beco^e /
and shall be fought with / by all lykelyhode. for your enemies have great will
to fight with you / for they fear little your puyssau^ce. But sirs / take no
head to that. For god / who knows and seythe all thing / shall have mercy on
you. Nor think nothing / of that ye have left behind you. For ye may well
know / it is without recoueraunce / if ye be disconfyted. Therefore sell your
lives valyantly: and dye if there be none other remedy honorably. And be not
dismayed though great puyssaunce of people issue out of Bruges against you.
For vyctorie lies not in puyssaunce of people: But it is all only in god. And
by his grace / it has been often times seen / as well by the Macabeus / as by
the Rhomayns. That a small people of good will / trusting in the grace of god
/ has disconfyted agreat nombre of people. And sirs / in this quarrel ye have
good right and a Just cause. And therefore by many reasons / ye ought to be
hardy / and of good comfort. Thus with such words and other / these freers
preched to ye people that morning: wherewith they were well content. And three
parts of the host were houseled / she wynge them self to have great trust
in God. And after these masses song / than they assembled toguyder on a little
hill. And there Phylyppe Dartuell by great sentence / showed them fro point to
point / the right that they thought (...) had in their quarrel. And how that
often ^mes the town of Gaunt had required their ^ode(...) Earl / to have mercy
on them. but they could never come to no point with him / But to the great
confusyon and damage of y^ town of Gaunt: and to the enhabytau^tes thereof.
Also saying / how they were than come so farforthe that to recule again they
could not. And also / than to return (all things considered) they could
win nothing thereby. For they had left nothing behind them / but
poverty and heaviness. And moreover he said. sirs / think another of your
wives nor children / but think of your honor. Thus such fair words
Philyppe Dartuell showed among the^ / for he was well langaged / and could
speak rightwell / and well it became him: and finally he said. Now fair
lords. Let us truly and equaly deperte our vitayle each to other like
brethren / without any manner of outrage. for when this is spend it must behoue
us to seek for new / if we thinke^ to live. And so than right humbly / the
chayres were discharged and the bred was divided by the constables* and the two
tonnes of wine / the bottomes were set upward. And so there they dyned with
the bredde and with the wine / and were content with their small repaste / for
that time. And felt them self better disposed / both in courage and in their
members / than^e and they had eaten more meare. And whan^e this dinner was past
/ than they set them self in order / and drew them self within their
rybaudeur. The which were high stakes / bound with yrone and sharp poynted
/ which they used ever to bear with them in their war. And so they set them
before their battle / and closed them self within them. And in this estate /
the three squyers that were send fro therle / to se their demea nynge found
them. For they aproched so nere / that they might well auiewe them / for they
ca^e just to their stakes. But the gauntoyse never styred for all them / but
let them alone. And made semblaunt / that they were right ioyefull of their
coming.

THan these currours rode to Bruges to therle / and found him in his lodgyng /
with a great nombre of knights and squyers with him. So they came through the
preace to the earl / and they spoke out a loud / because the Earl would they
should be herd. And so there they showed / how they hadd rydden so nere to
the gauntoyse / that they might have shot at them / if they had list. But
they suffered them to pass peasably. And also they showed / how they had seen
their baners. Than the earl demanded what nombre of people they were / by
estymacyon. They answered / that surely: as far as they could disery / they
past not a five or six thousand. Than the earl said well. Let every man
appareyle himself / I will go fight with them they shall not deperte without
battle* and therewith the trumpettes did sown through Bruges / and than
every man armed him. And assembled in the market place / and set themself in
order with their baners / as was the usage. And before the Earls lodging
assembled: lords / knights / and squyers. When every thing was ready: than
therle went to the market place and saw there great nombre of people well
ordered and araynged / whereof he reioysed. And so at his commandment / every
man drew in bone order in to the feldes. It was great pleasure to behold
them. They were a.xl. thousand armed men. And so / what a horse hacke and a
foot: they came nere to the place where the gauntois were / and there they
rested. And by that time that therle was come thither / it was past noone and
the son began to declyne. Than so^e said to the earl. sir / ye se yonder your
enemies / they be but a handefull of men / as to the regard of your company.
And sir / they can not fly away We would counsel you / not to fight with
the^ this night. Let them alone till to morrow. and sir / thereby ye shall se
what they will do. They shall be febler than they be now / for they have
nothing to eat. The earl acorded well to that counsel / and would that it
should so have been done. But they of Bruges were so hot and hasty to fight /
that they would not abide. But said: set on them / they shall not long endure.
And so than they of Bruges began to shote gonnes at the^. And than they of
Gau^t discharged at ones three. C. gonnes at one shot: and so turned a bout
the plasshe of water. and caused the son / to be in the eyes of the^ of Bruges
/ the which grieved them sore: and so entered in among the^ and cried Gaunt. And
as soon as they of Bruges herd them cry Gaunt / and herd so many go^nes
come in among them / and saw how they ser full front on them. Like falls
herted people and of yuell courage / they gave way to the gau^tois to enter in
among them. And so without any de fence / they cast down their weapens and
tour ned their backs. Than y^ gau^toyse seeing well how their enemies were
disconfyted / kept the^ self still close toguyder / and beat down on both
sides and before them. And ever went forth cryeng Gau^t. saying also / follow
follow our enemies are discomfyted / and let us enter in to Bruges with the^.
God has regarded us this euenyng by his pytie. And as they said so they did /
for they pursued the^ of Bruges sharp lie. And as they over took them they
slew the^ / and tarried not / but kept on still their way / and ever they of
Bruges fled on before. There were many slain and beaten down / for among
them of Bruges there was no defense. I trow there was never so unhappy people
/ nor more recreantly maynteyned them self. For all the great pride and
bobance / that they were of before. Some would think and suppose by
ymaginacyon / that there had been some treason / the which was not so. It was
non other / but their simple defense / and yuell fortune that fell on the^.

How the town of Bruges was taken by the gau^toyse* and how the earl of
Flaunders saved him self / in a poor woman's house in the town of Bruges.
Cap. CCCC.
When the earl of Flaunders / and the company y^ was about him. saw the yuell
or der and rule of them of Bruges. and saw how they were disco^fyted by their
own follye / and could se no recoueraunce / for they fled away before the
gauntoyse. Therle than was abashed / and all they that were about him. And so
disco^fyted / y^ they fled away / every man to save himself. Of a truth /
if they of Bruges would have retour ned again / and assailed the gauntoyse
with their help / they had been lykely to have recoue red all again. but they
saw no remedy / for they fled toward Bruges as fast as they might. the fader
tarried not for the son / nor the son for the fader. So than the men of
arms and all brake their array / but they hadd no list to take the way to
Bruges. the prease was so great in the way toward Bruges / y^ it was maruayle
tose and to here / the clamoure and cry of them that were slain and hurt. And
the gau^toyse fo lowyng them of Bruges / cryeng Gaunt gaunt still going
forward / and beatyng down of people. The most part of the men of arms /
would not put themself in that parell. Howbeit / therle was counsayled to
draw to Bruges / and to be one of y^ first that should enter. and than to
close the gates / to thentent that the gauntoys should not be lords of Bruges.
Therle seeing none other remedy / nor no recouerau^ce / by abiding in the
field. For he saw well every man fled / and also it was dark night.
Wherefore he believed the counsel that was given him / and so took the way
toward Bruges / with his baner before him. And so came to the gate / and
entered with the first and a.xl. with him. Than he set men to keep the gate /
and to close it if y^ gau^toyse did follow. Than the Earl rode to his own
lodgyng / and send all about the town / commaundyng every man on pain of
death / to draw to the market place. Thentensyon of the earl / was to recover
the town by that means / but he did not. as ye shall here after.

In the mean time that therle was at his logyng / and send forth the clerks
of every ward fro street to street / to have every man to draw to the market
place / to recover the town. The gauntoise pursewed sofiersly their enemies /
y^ they entered in to the town with them of Bruges And as soon as they were
within the town / the first thing they did / they went straight to the market
place / and there set them self in array. The earl as than had send a knight
of his / called sir Robert Marshall to the gate / to se what the gau^toise
did. And when he ca^e to the gate he found the gate beaten down / and the
gau^toyse masters thereof. and some of them of Bruges met with him and said.
sir Robert / return and save your self if ye can / for y^ town is won by
them of Gaunt. Than the knight returned to therle as fast as he might / who
was coming out of his lodging a horse back / with a great no^bre of cressettes
and lyghtes with him / and was go yng to the market place. Than the knight
showed therle all that he knew. how beit the earl wyllyng to recover the
town / drew to y^ market place. And as he was entryng / such as were before
him. seeing the place all raynged with y^ gauntoyse / said to therle. sir /
return again / if ye go any farther / ye are but deed / or taken with your
enemies. For they are raynged on y^ market place / and do abide for you. They
showed him truth. And when the gau^toyse saw the clerenesse of the lyghtes /
coming down y^ street they said. yonder comes the earl / he shall come in to
our hands. And Philyppe Dartuell had commanded / fro street to street as he
went. That if the Earl came among them / that no man should do to him any
bodily harm / but take him a live. and than to have him to gau^t and so to
make their peace as they list. Therle who trusted to have recovered all / came
right nere to the place / where as the gauntoyse were. Than diverse of his men
said. Sir / go no farther / for the gauntoyse are lords of the market place
and of the town. If ye enter in to ye market place / ye are in danger to be
slain or taken A great nombre of the gauntoyse / are going fro street to
street / seeking for their enemies. They have certain of them of the town
with them / to bring them fro house to house / where as they would be. And sir
/ out at any of the gates ye can not issue / for the gauntoyse are lord thereof.
Nor to your own lodging ye can not return / for a great nombre of the
gauntoyse are going thither. and when therle herd those tidings / which were
right hard to him / as it was reason. He was greatly than abashed. and
ymagined what parell he was in. than^e he believed the counsel / and would go
no farther but to save him self if he might: and so took his own counsel.
He commanded to put out all the lyghtes / and said to the^ that were about
him. I se well there is no recovery. Let every man depart / and save him self
as well as he may. And as he commanded it was done. The lyghtes were quenched
and cast in to the streets / and so every man departed. Therle than went in to
a back lane / and made a varlette of his to unarm him / and did cast away his
armure / and put on an old cloak of his varlettes. And than said to him. Go
thy way fro me / and save thy self if thou can: and have a good tongue / and
thou fall in the hands of thine enemies. And if they ask the any thing of me
/ be not be known that I am in the town. He answered and said. ser / to dye
therefore / I will speak no word of you. Thus abode there the earl of Flanders
all alone. He might than well say / that he was in great danger and hard
adventure / for at that time / if he had fallen in the hands of his enemies /
he had been in danger of death. For the gau^toyse went fro house to house /
serchyng for the Earls friends. And ever as they found any / they brought them
in to the market place. and there without remedy / before Philyp dart well and
the capitayns / they were put to death. so god was friend to the earl / to save
him out of that parell. He was never in such danger before in his life / nor
never after. As ye shall here after in this history.

This about the hour of mydnight / the Earl went fro street to street / and by
back lanes. so that at last he was feign to take a house / or else he had be
found by the^ of Gaunt. and so as he went about ye town / he entered in to a
poor woman's house / the which was not mete for such a lord. there was another
hall / palys / nor chamber it was but a poor smoky house. there was nothing
but a poor hall black with smoke / and above a small pla^cher / and a ladder
of.vii. steps to mount upon. And on the plancher / there was a poor couche /
where as the poor womans children lay. than therle sore abashed and trymblyng
/ at his entryng said. O good woman save me / I am thy lord therle of
Flanders. but now I must hyde me / for mine enemies chase me. and if ye do me
good now / I shall reward you her after therefore. The poor woman knew him
well / for she had been often times at his gate to fetch alms / and had often
seen him / as he went in and out a sportyng. And so inco^tyne^t as hap was she
answered. For if she had made any delay / he had been taken talking with her
by the fire. than she said. sir / mount up this ladder / and ley your self
under the bed y^ ye find there / as my children sleep. and so in the mean
time the woman sat down by the fire with another child / that she had in her
arms. So the Earl mounted up the plancher as well as he might / and crept in
between the couche and the straw and lay as flat as he could. and even there
with / some of the rutters of Gau^t / entered in to ye same house for some of
them said. How they had seen a man enter in to the house before the^. and so
they found the woman syttyng by the fire with her child. than they said. Good
woman / where is the man that we saw enter before us in to this house / and
did shytte the door after him. sirs quod she / I saw no man enter in to this
house this night / I went out rightnowe and cast out a little water / and did
close my door again. if any were here I could not tell how to hyde him. ye
se all the easment that I have in this house. Here ye may se my bed / and
here above this pla^cher lies my poor children. Than one of the^ took a
candell and mounted up the ladder / and put up his heed above the pla^cher. and
saw there none other thing but the poor couche / where her children lay and
slept. And so he looked all about / and than said to his company. Go we hens /
we lose the more for the less. the poor woman says troth / her is no
creature but she and her children. and than they deperted out of the house.
After y^ / there was none entered to do any hurt. all these words the Earl herd
right well / where as he lay under the poor couche. ye may well ymagin / tha^
that he was in great fear of his life. He might well say? I am as now / one
of the poorest princes of the world. and might well say / that the fortunes of
the world are nothing stable. yet it was a good hap / that he escaped with
his life How be it / this hard and peryllous adventure might well be to him a
spectacle all his life after: and an ensample to all other. Now let us leave
the earl of Flaunders in this hard estate / and speak of them of Bruges / and
how the gauntoyse parceyuered.

How they of Gaunte / spared the merchants strangers: and how the earl
parted fro Bruges and went to Lysle. And how he was received there ioyously.
Cap. CCCC.i.
FRaunces Atreyman / was one of the chief capiteynes of these rutters. he was
sent by Philyppe Dartuell and by Peter de Boyse / to seek about Bruges for
their enemies. and to keep ye markette place all night till the next day. that
they might se / that they were lords of all the town And they were straytely
commanded / that they should do no hurt / to any merchant stranger / being
than in Bruges. Saying / how it were no reason: that they should take hurt /
for their war. This commandment was well kept. The chief occasyon fell on
the four Mestyers / for they had always ben favorable to the earl / before
And warpe and in other places. The gauntoyse went all about serchyng for the^
and as they were found / they were slain without mercy. The same night there
were slain / (...)han.xii. hundred / what of one and other: with many other
robberyes and yuell deeds / ye which came not all to knowledge. As diverse
houses robbed and pylled / women defoyled and distroyed: and coffers broken up.
So that the most poorest of Gaunt / were than beco^e rich.

tHe sunday in the morning / the joyful tidings ca^e to the town of gau^t.
How that their company had disconfyted the earl and all his chiualry: and were
lords and masters of Bruges. ye may well believe and know / that this
tidings greatly reioysed the people / being before in tribulacyon. And so for
joy they made diverse processyons / lauding god: in that he had so regarded
them with his eye of pytie / and so conforted them. as to give them vyctorie of
their enemies. And so always / there came fresshe tidings to them of their
vyctorie: whereby they were so reioysed that they wist not what to do. The lord
of harsels / who was as than abidynge in Gaunt. If he had taken the same sunday
or the monday after / a three or four thousand men in harness / and gone to
Andwarpe: he had taken ye town at his pleasure. For they of the town were so
abashed when they herd the tidings / that nigh for fear / they had fled
out of the town in to Heynaulte / or in to other places / to have saved them
self. Thereto / they were ready aparelled. but when they saw that they of
Gaunte came not to them ward / than courage came to them and also / such
knights as came thither did confort them. As sir Johan Bernage / sir Tyrrey du
Ban / and sir Flureant of Hurl. These three knights conforted them of Andwarpe
/ unto such time / as sis Damas of Hallone came thither fro the earl. as ye
shall here after.

There were never people / that did with their enemies / as they of Gaunte did
with them of Bruges. They did hurt no man of any of the small crafts of the
town / without he were sore accused. When Philyp Dartwell and the capitayns of
Gau^t / saw how they were lords of Bruges / and all at their commandment
and under their obeysau^ce. Than they made a cry / that every man on pain of
death should draw to their logynges / and not to rob nor pylle / nor to make
no debate / without they were commanded. Than it was enquered / if any man
knew where therle was become. some said / how he was fled the saturday. and
some other said / how he was still in the town / hyd and could not be found.
the capitayns of gau^t took little head thereof / for they wereso reioysed with
their vyctorie / y^ they cared for nothing. Another for earl / baron / knight /
nor other in all Flanders. They reputed them self so great / y^ they thought
to have all / under their obeysa^ce. Than Philyp Dartuell and Peter de boyse
remembered / that when they deperted fro Gau^t / they left no vitayle / nor
other purueyau^ce in ye town Therefore they sent straight a certain nombre of
men / to Dan and to Scluse: to the^tent to belordes thereof / and of the vitayle
in the^. And when such as were sent ca^e to Dan / they opyned the gates to
them. And all that was in the town / was put in to their hands / and every
thing at their commandment. Than there was taken out of the fair cellers /
the good wynes of Poyctou / of Gascone / and of Rochell: and of other far
countries / a five or six thousand tonnes. And it was laid in to ships and
in to chares and conveyed to Gaunt / what by land and by water. And than they
went farther and came to Scluse. Which town incontinent was opyned to them /
and put under their obeysaunce. And there they found great quantyte of corn
and meal / in ships and cellers of merchants strangers. So all was bought
and paid for / and send to Gaunt / by water and by land. Thus the town of
Gaunt / was refresshed and delivered fro misery / by the grace of god / other
wise it could not have been done. The gau^toys than ought well to remember /
that god plainly had helped them. Seeing / that five thousandemen nere famysshed
/ disconfyted.xl. thousandemen / at home at their own doors. The capitayns
nor they / had no cause to be proud thereof but they were so proud thereof /
that god was displeased with them. And that was well seen or the year passed.
as ye shall her after in the story: to give ensample to all people.

I Was informed / and I believe it well. that the sunday at night / the earl of
Flanders issued out of the town of Bruges / by what means I can not say. If
any did help to make his way I can not tell / but I believe yes. He issued out
a foot all alone / in an old simple cloak And when he was in the feldes he was
joyful / for than he might well say / how he had escaped a dangerous
passage. And so went forth at adventure / and went to a thick busshe / tose
what way he might take. For he knew not well the ways / nor he was not wont
to go a foot. And as he stood under a thick bussh in the night / he herd by
adventure a man speak / as he came by and it was a knight of his / who had
married his bastard daughter: and he was called sir Robr^t Marshall. Therle
knew him well by his words / and as he passed by / he said. Robert / are ye
there. The knight / who knew the earl well by his speech / said. A sir: ye
have made me this day to seek in many places for you about Bruges. How are ye
get out? Let us go our way quod the earl. It is no time to tell our
adventures. I pray you let us do so much / that I may have a horse / for I am
sore weary with going a foot. and I pray you: let us take ye way to Lysle and ye
know it. yes sir quod the knight I know it well. And so they went forth all
that night till it was the next morning / or they could get a horse / and yet
they could get none. But the first that they found was a Mare / the which
they took fro a poor man in a vyllage. So the earl lept on her without sadyll
or panell. And at night came to Lysle / where the most perte of his knights
that fled out of the field were come thither: some a foot / some a horse back
/ and so^e were gone in to Hollande and in to zelande. as sir Guy of Guystels /
he arrived at a good port for he found in zelande in a town there / therle
Guy of Bloyes / who made him good chere / and departed largely with him / and
wylled him to tarry there with him / as long as it should please him. Thus they
that were desolate / were reco^forted by the lords that they resorted unto /
who had pity on them: as it was reason. For nobleness and gentylnesse / ought
to be aided by nobles and gentyls.

Of the great richesse that the gau^toyse found in Bruges. And how all the
towns of Flaunders / yielded them to Gaunte / except And warpe. Cap. CCCC.ii.
THe tidings spredde a broad in to diverse countries / of the disconfyture of
the^ of Bruges / and of therle their lord / done by the gauntois. wherewith
there were diverse people reioysed / and specially commynalties. All the good
towns about Gaunt / and in the bysshoprike of Liege / were as joyful / as
though the matter had been their own. In likewise / so were they of Rohan and
Paris in France / if they durst have spoken it. And when pope Clement herd
thereof / he be thought him a little / and said. Surely / this disconfyture was
a stroke of god / to give ensample to the earl. And that god had send him that
tribulacion / because he was rebel against his opinyons. Also other great
lords in France and in other places / said. how the earls aduersytie / was
not greatly to be complained / for he had well deserved to bear it. For he had been so presu^ptuous / that he loved no lord / neighbor french king nor
other: wherefore they co^playned less his persecucyo^s. Howbeit it is an old
sayng / he that has any yuell fortune / men will speak the worst thereof. and
specially they of the town of Louayne were greatly reioysed / with the victory
of the gauntoyse / and of the earls trouble. for they were but in hard case
with ye duke of Brabant their lord / who was in purpose to make them war /
and to beat down their gates / to keep them thereby the rather under. Also it
was said in the town of Louayn / y^ if Gaunt had been as nere them as
Brusels was: they would have joined together / and have been all one. Of all
their words and deuyses / the duke and duches of Brabant were informed / but
it behooved the^ / as at that time / to close their eyes and to hold down
their heedes / for it was no time for them than to speak.

THus they of Gaunt being in Bruges: devised many new things. and among
other / they devised to beat down two gates that were toward Gaunt / and to
fill the dykes to thentent that they of Bruges should never rebel after against
Gaunt. and when they should depart / to take with them a five hundred men of
the^ of Bruges / to thentent to keep the^ in the more fear and subiectyon.
Thus in the mean season while these capitayns were at Bruges / beatyng down
gates and walls / and fillyng of dykes. They sent to Ipre / to Courtray / to
Berges / to Cassell / to Propringne / to Bourbourc / and to all the towns and
castles of Flaunders on the sea cost. that they should be all under the
obeysau^ce of them / and to send them the keys of their towns and castles.
submittynge themself to their obeysau^ce and service. and so they all obeyed /
none durst say against it / but came all to Bruges / puttyng them self under
the obeysau^ce of Philyppe Dartuell / and Peter de Boise. For these two named
and wrote them self souerayn capitayns of all other / and specially Pihlyppe
Dartuell / was he that most besyed him self with the charge of all Flaunders.
and as long as he abode in Bruges / he kept the estate of a prince. for every
day he had playenge at his lodgyng door / mynstrels dinner and supper / and was
served in vessel of silver / as though he had been the earl of Flaunders. And
well he might keep than that estate / for he had all the Earls vessel / gold
and silver / and all his ieowels found in his house at Bruges / there was
nothing saved. Also there was sent a certain nombre of gauntoyse to Merlle / a
fair house of the earls / standing half a mile fro Bruges. they that went
thither did much hurt / for they brake down all the house / and brake down
the fownte / wherein the earl was christened / and laid in charyotes / all the
gold and silver ieowels / and other things that they found there and sent it
to Gaunt. The term of.xv. days there was going and coming with caryages fro
Bruges to Gaunt / with their pyllage that they had get that journey. It was
hard to exsteme the profit that they gate there.

ANd whan^e they of Gaunt had done all their will and pleasure / in the town
of Bruges. they sent a five hundred of the notablest burgesses of the town to
Gaunt / to lie there in hostage. and Fraunces Atreman and Peter de Myter / and a
thousand of their men / conveyed them thither. And Peter de Boyse / abode as
captain of Bruges / till the gates and walls were beaten down / and the
dykes filled. And Philyppe Dartuell departed with four thousand men / and went
to Ipre. and there all manner of people came out against him / and received him
as honorably / as though he had been their own natural lord / that had come
first to his land. and there they all did put them self under his obeysau^ce.
And there he made new mayres and aldermen / and made new laws. And to him
came thither they of Cassell / of Berges / of Bourbourcke / and of Propringne.
they all / submytted them self under his obeysau^ce / and swear to him faith
and truth / and to hold of him as to their lord the earl of Flaunders. And
when he had thus done / and taken the assurance of the^ / and had tarried at
Ipre the space of.viii. days. Than he departed and came to Courtray / where as
he was also received with great joy / and there he tarried three days. And than
he sent messangers and letters to And warpe co^maundynge them to come to him /
and to be under his obeysau^ce. seeing / how all the country was turned to
them of Gaunt. and how they were behind / and did not as other did. wherefore
he sent them word surely / yt the gauntoyse should lay siege to the^. And not
to depart till they had the town / and slain all the^ with in. When these
tydinges and message came to And warpe / sent fro Philyp Dartuell. Than the
three knights answered hotely / and said. how they set but little by the
manassyng of the son of a tryer of honey / nor that ye herrtage of therle
their lord / should be so sone given to him / nor to none such. saying how
they would de^^no^ (...) to dye in the quarrel. Thus the messangers returned
again to Courtrey.

How therle of Flaunders was at Lysle / and how Andewarpe was be sieged by
the gauntoyse and flemynges. Cap. CCCC.iii.
When Philyp Dartuell herd his messanger speak / and report / how they of the
grayson of And warpe set nothing by him. Than he swear / y^ what so ever it
cost him / or the country of Flaunders* he would nothing entende / till he had
taken that town and cast it down to the earth / he was so sore dyspleased. He
thought this to do / had been well in his puyssau^ce / seeing that all
flaunders was inclyned to him. When he had soiourned a six days at Courtrey /
and had renewed their law / and had taken fealty and homage of them / as
though he had been earl of Flanders. than he returned to Gaunt / and there he
was met with procession / with so great joy. that the earl their natural
lord: was never so honorably received. the people worshypped him like their
god / because he gave the counsel whereby their town recovered their estate
and puissau^ce. For it could not be esteemed / the great riches and wealth that
came daily to them by water and by land. Fro Bruges / fro Dan / and fro Sluice
/ and the lofe of breed that in three wekes together / was worth an old grote /
was than worth but four mytes. and the wine that was worth.xxiiii. grotes /
was than valued but at two grotes. As than every thing in Gaunt was better
chepe than at Tourney / or at Ualencennes. Philyppe Dartuell than kept a great
stable of good horses like a great prince / and he was as well stuffed in all
thing in his house / as though he had been earl of Flaunders / and better than
therle was appointed at Lysle. And also / he had through all Flaunders his
officers bayliffes / co^stables / receyuours and other. who daily brought him
substance / whereby he maynteyned his astate. and he ware scarlet gowns /
furred with myneuer: like as the duke of Brabant / or earl of Haynalt did. Also
he had his chamber of account / to pay and to reken for every thing / as y^
earl had. And he gave diverse suppers and banketes / to ladies and damsels in
like manner as the earl had done before / and spared another gold nor silver for
his pleasure. And he wrote and called himself Phylip Dart well / the regard
and over loker of Flanders.

THe earl of Flaunders being at Lysle / had much to think on / when he saw
his country so sore rebelled against him / and could not se that he was of
puyssance / as of himself ever to recover it again / for all the towns were
in unite / and of one acorde against him / the which he could never for do /
but by great force and puyssaunce. for all the country spoke no more of him /
nor did him no more honor / nor would not know him for their lord / no more
than he had never been so. Than the alyaunce that he had with the duke of
Burgoyne / who had married his daughter / the lady Margaret by whom the duke
had two fair sons. this alyaunce / stood the Earl as than in good stead. It
was happy also than for him / y^ king Charles was deed / and that the young
king as than was under the governing of his uncle / the duke of Burgoyn / who
might lead the king at his pleasur. And also the king was young and had good
will to the war / wherefore it was y^ less maystrie to stir him thereto. And
therle hoped that the duke of Burgoyne would sone set him thereon / if he would
show him how he is bound to aid his men / when their men will rebel
against them. But some thought / that if king Charles had lived still till
that time / that he would have done nothing. and if he had: men supposed that
he would thereby anexed the county of Flaunders / to the crown of France /
for therle of Flanders was not so well in his grace that he would have done
any thing for him / without he had known well why.

Now let us leave to speak of these deuyses / till time be that we return
thereto again. but let us show how the earl of Flaunders / being at Lysle
/ After the great loss that he had at Bruges. he understood how sir Terrey
Damayn / and sir Fiurant de Heulle / kept still the town of Andwarpe. and had
kept it / ever sithe the besynes before Bruges. and knew well / that these
knights were not able to resyst against the puyssance of Flaunders / if they
came to lay siege thereto: as it was thought y^ they would do shortly. Than to
refressh the town / therle called to him sir Danyell of Halwyn / and said.
Sir: I will ye go to And warpe / and be sovereign capitayn there / and take
with you a hundred and fyftie spears / a hundred crosbowes / and two hundred
other varlettes / with spears and pauesses. and take ye head to that garrison /
I give you the charge thereof. and new vitayle it with corn / whete / and otes
/ and sault flesh / and with wine out fro our friends / and neighbors of
Tourney / they will not fail us at this need. Sir quod the knight all this
shall be done / and sir: I shall take as good head to y^ town as I can / sithe
it please you that I shall so do. there shall none yuell come thereto / by my
fawte. Danyell quod the earl / of that I am sure. And so the knight took leave
of the earl / and went to Andewarpe / and there refresshed the town with new
men of war / vitayle and other things necessary.

When Philyp Dartuell being in Gau^t understood the tydinges / how they of
Andwarp were refresshed with new men. than he said / he would provide for
remedy / sayng: how it was not to be suffered. For it was greatly to the
preiudyce and dishonor of the country of Flanders / that this town held so
against them. wherefore he said / he would go and lay siege thereto / and not to
depart thens / till he had beaten it down / and put to death all tho that
were within / knights and other. Than he sent his commandment through the
country of Flaunders / that every man should be ready the.ix. day of June / to
be with him before Andwarpe. There was none that durst disobey his
commandment. so the men of all the good towns in Flanders / and they of the
frank of Bruges / made them ready. and came and laid siege before Andwarpe /
and lay abroad in the feldes / in meadows and in marsshes / and there about.
And there was Philyppe Dartuell their capytayn / by whom they were all ordered
/ who held a great estate before Andwarpe. Than he reared a tayllage in
Flaunders / every fire: every weke to pay four grotes / the rich to bear out
the feeble / whereby he gate together much money for there was none excused / but
all paid. For he had servants for the nones through / all the country / who
made every man to pay / poor and rich / whyder they would or not. It was
said / he had at y^ siege mo than a hundred thousand men / and the flemynges
had pyled in the river of Lescalt / great pyles of great tymbre. so that no
ship could come / fro Tourney to Andewarpe. and they had in their host all
things plentyfull / market with clothe / furs and other mercery. and every
saturday they had a market. and all the vyllages therabout brought thither
fruits. butter / milk / chese / pulleyn / and other things. And they had
tauernes as plentyous with wine / as though they had been in Brusels / both
renyshe wine / wine of Poyctou / and of France / malueseys and other wynes of
strange countries / and good chepe. Every man might go and come / pass and
repasse without any parell. They of Heynalt / of Braba^t / of Almayne / and of
Liege / but none out of France.

How the gauntoyse assailed the town of Andwarpe diverse times / and how they
ran before Lysle / and in the country about on the realm of France. Cap.
CCCCiiii.
WHan^e that sir Danyell of Haulwyne / capytayne of Andwarpe / entered first in
to the town. he divided ye vitayle there egally every man his porcyon / and
sent away all the horses* and beat down all the howses ioyninge to the
walls. And covered them with earth for fear of fire and gonne shot / whereof
they of the host had great plenty. Also they made all the women and children
to lodge in the churches and mynsters / and diverse to avoid the town / and
all dogs were clean avoided or slain / and cast in to ye river. The
companyons that were within / made diverse issues / and did much damage to them
of the host without. There were within two brethren squyers of Arthoyse /
Lambert of Lambres and Trystram. these two did diverse times great feats of
arms / and took away diverse times vitayle fro the host / and prisoners also.
Thus this siege continued all the somer / and it was the entensyon of Philyp
Dartuell / and of his counsel to abide there / till they had famysshed the
town. for they saw well / by assautyng they should lose much of their
people. They of Gaunt made on the hill of Andwarpe a marueylus great engyn.xx.
foot large and.xl. foot long. they called this engyn a moton / it was to cast
great stones in to the town / to beat down houses. also to make the^ within
afraid / they made a marvelous great bombard of.l. foot of length / shotyng
stone of a marvelous weight. and when this bombarde shot / it might well be
hard by day time five mile of / and by night ten. and it made such a noise in
the going / as though all the dyuels of hell had been in ye way. diverse other
engyns they had / where with they put them of ye town in great trouble howbeit
the capitayns within did comfort them of the town / and made as good
resystence as they could. and would issue out a three or four times in ye weke
/ whereby they gate more honor than blame / and more profit than damage.

While this siege / lay thus still before And warpe / there deperted fro the
host a.xii. hundred men / thynkyng to beat down knights and gentylmens
houses / such as were ^led out of Flaunders / and gone to dwell in Heynault /
in Braba^t / and in Arthoyse / with their wives and children / and so these
gauntoise did as they purposed / and did much hurt in Flaunders. they left
no gentylmans house vnbrent or cast down to the earth. And thanne they came
again to Marlle the earls house / and beat down all that they had left
sta^dyng before. and there they found the cradell / wherein the earl was kept in
his youth / and brake it all to pieces. And a fair bayne / wherein he was wont
to be bayned. Also they beat down the chapel and bare away the bell / and
than they went to Bruges / where they found Peter de Boyse / and Peter de Myrt
/ who did them great there / and gave them great thank of that they had done.
Than these rutters when they had well refresshed them self at Bruges / took
their way to the bridge of warueston / and passed the river of Lyse / and so
came before the town of Lysle / and beat down certain wyndmyls / and set
fire of diverse vyllages in Flaunders. Than there issued out of Lysle a foot and
a horsback / mo than four thousand / and so there were diverse of the flemynges
slain and taken / and beheded after at Lysle. and if they had been well
pursued there had scaked but a few. how beit these rutters of Gaunt than
entered in to Tourneses / and did there much hurt. and brent the town of
Helehyer / and other vyllages there about / parteyning to the realm of
France. and than they returned with great joy and proy / to the siege of
Andwarpe. Tydinges came to the duke of Burgoyn / who was as tha^ at Bapaulmes
in Arthoyse / how the gauntoyse had pylled and ouerryn the country / and
brent certain vyllages in the realm of France. Than incontinent the duke
wrote to the king / who was at Campayne / and to the duke of Berrey his brother
/ and to the duke of Burbon / and to the kings counsel / to the intent that
they should find some remedy. and the duke of Burgoyn would not / but yt the
flemynges had done as they did for than he thought well / that the earl of
Flaunders should be feign to require the french king to help and aid him /
or else he was never likely to enter in his heritage of Flaunders. And also /
all things considered / this war somewhat displeased the duke of Burgoyne.
for he was by the reason of his wife / after the death of therle of Flanders /
next heryterto Flaunders.

IN this season the earl of Flaunders was at Heden / and it was showed him /
how these rutters of Gaunt had been at Merlle / and beaten down his house in
the dispyte of him / and ye chamber wherein he was borne. and also how they had
broken the fount wherein he was christened. And also his armery and bayne all to
broken / where with he was sore dyspleased / and had many ymaginacyons. for he
saw his country lost / and turned against him / except Teremount and
Andewarpe. And he could se no recovery / without it were by the puyssaunce of
France. Than he determined / all thing considered / that he would goo and
speak with his son in law / the duke of Burgoyn / who was as than at
Bapaulmes / and so to show him all his besynes. and thereupon departed fro
Hedyn and went to Arras / and there rested two days. and the next day he went
to Bapaulmes / and so alyghted at the earls place / which as thanne was his
own. for he was earl of Arthoyse / for the good lady his mother was deed. The
duke of Burgoyn had great compassyon of the earl his father in law / and
ryghtswetely did comfort him / and said. Sir: by the faith that I owe to the
king / I shall ente^de to nothing / but to help you / or else we shall lose all
the remnant. for it is not conuenyent / that such rascal as be now in
Flaunders / should be suffered to rule a country. for by them chyualry and
gentylnes might be distroyed / ye? and consequentlye all christendom. The earl
was well recomforted in y^ the duke said / he would help to aid him. and so
than he departed and went to the cite of Aras. All this season therle had in
prison a two hundred men of diverse good towns in Flaunders / who were hardly
kept / they had nothing but breed and water. and every day it was showed them /
ye they should lose their heedes. And when the earl was returned and come to
Arras / in ye honor of god and of our lady / he caused the^ all to be
delivered. for he saw well / that all that was fortuned in Flanders / was not
by their means / nor they were nothing gilty thereof. And so he made them to be
sworn to be true and faithful to him / and so did give to each of the^ gold
and silver / to go to Lysle and to Doway / or whyder as they list them self /
whereby therle did get great love. And so than he went to Heden.

Of the request that the duke of Burgoyne made to the french king / and why
the king took on him to bear the flyenge heart. Cap. CCCC.v.
THe duke of Burgoyn for gate not the covenant / that he made with his father
in law / th earl of Flanders. And so he departed fro the town of Bapaulmes
/ and with him sir Guy of Tremoyle / and sir John^ of Uyen / who was admyrall
of France / who did all his pain to comfort the earl. And they two were
chyefe of counsel with the duke. And so the duke and his company came to
saint Lyse / where as the king was / and his two uncles with him / the dukes
of Berry and of Burbone. and so there the duke of Burgoyn was received with
great joy / and he was demanded tydinges of Flaunders / and of the siege of
Andwarpe. and the duke answered them right sagely / and showed all the matter.
And when he saw his time / he took aparte the duke of Berrey / and showed him
how the gauntoyse full of pride / had done their deuoyre and pain / to
distroy all noblenes. And also he showed / how they had brent and pylled on
the realm of France / the which was a thing preiudicyall / and to the
confusyon and shame of the realm of France. sayng how it ought not so to be
suffered. Fair brother quod the duke of Berrey / we will speak with the king
in this matter / we two are chyfe of his counsel. so yt if we enfourme the
king thereof / there is none shall say against our ententes. How beit / to move
war between France and Flaunders / the which has been long in peace. It
behooves that we have some laufull tytell / and that the other barons and
lords of France / be joined and agreed thereto. or else peradventure we might
be blamed / and bear all the faut / if it fortuned not well. for the king is
young / and every man knows: that he will soon agree to y^ we counsel him.
If the matter do well / than well shall come thereof. And if any yuell come
thereby / we shall than bear ye charge / and be more blamed than any other: and
good cause why. For every man shall say / behold yonder the kings uncles /
the duke of Berry and of Burgoyn / how yuell they have counsel the king.
they have brought ye realm of France in to war / where as it neded not.
wherefore dete brother I say / let us call together / the most part of the
prelates and nobles of the realm of France. and than let us show them all
the matter / in the presence of the king. to whom the matter personally touches
/ because of the heritage of Flanders. and so thereby we shall here generally
every man's will / and opinyon. ye say right well quod the duke of Burgoyne /
and as ye have devised / so shall it be done. And with those same words / the
king entered in to the same chamber / with an hawk on his hand / and so he
spoke merely to his uncles / and said. Amy fair uncles / what matter is that ye
speak of: in so great counsel / I would gladly know it / if I might. Sir
quod the duke of Berrey / ye may know it right well for it parteyneth greatly
to you. Sir: behold here your uncle ye duke of Burgoyn / who complayneth
greatly of them of Flaunders. for the false villayns of Flanders / has put
out of his heritage therle their natural lord / and all noble men. And as
now: they lie at siege before Andwarpe / with mo than a hundred thousand
flemynges / wherein they have besieged a great nombre of ge^tlemen. and these
flemynges have a capitayn / called Philyppe Dartuell / pure english in his
courage. and he has sworn / never to depart thens / till he have his will of
the town / and of them that be within it. without so be that your power of
France reyse / him fro the siege / ye which he has resarued in his oath.
therefore sir / how say you? will ye aid your cosyn of Flauuders / and conquer
again his heritage / the which these proud villayns has taken fro him. By
my faith quod the king fair uncles / I have great will thereto. and for gods
sake let us do it / I desire none other thing / but to be armed. for as yet I
never bare armure. it behooves me / if I think to raygne in puyssa^ce and
honor / to learn the feats of arms. these two dukes each of the^ regarded
other / and had great pleasure of the kings words. Than the duke of Berry
spoke again and said. Sir / ye have said passingly well: and thus to do sir /
ye are bound for diverse reasons. Sir the cou^ty of Flaunders / is of the
demayne of France. and ye have sworn and we for you / to keep and maynteyne
in their right all your liege men. and also sir / therle of Flanders is your
cosyn / wherefore ye ought to love him. And therefore sir / sithe ye be in this
good mind / keep you so still: and answer thereafter / to every person that
speaks to you thereof. And sir / we shall assemble hastily y^ prelates and
barons of your realm / and shall show the^ all the matter in your presens.
And sir than if ye will speak as hertely as ye do now to us / than every man
will say / we have a king of high enterprise and of noble will and courage. by
my faith quod the king fair uncles / I would we should be ready to morrow next
/ to go to that journey. for fro hens forth / the grettest pleasure that I
desire / is to go in to Flanders / to abate the pride of the flemynges. Of the
which words the two dukes had great joy. than came to them the duke of
Burbone and they showed him all the matter: as ye have herd before. And of y^
great desire that the king had to go in to Flanders / whereof y^ duke of Burbon
had great joy. Thus the matter hanged in this estate. And the king and his
uncles wrote letters to the lords of the counsel of France. Desyring them /
to come at a day assigned to Campyen / to a perlyament that should be there
holden / for certain business of the realm of France. and so every man
obeyed as it was reason: and the king was right glad of that tidings. His
mind was so sore thereof / that no man could set him therfro. And the king said
often times / that there was to great delays made in the matter. for he said / that
he thought / if one should enterprise a great matter it should not be long
delayed. for in the delay / y^ enemies take aduyce to their aduau^tage. And
also when the parels of war was laid to him than would he answer and say. ye
/ he that never enterpriseth / little or no thing atchyueth. Thus the young
king often times devised / with the knights and squyers of his chamber.

Now shall I show you a dreme / that fortuned to the king in the same season
/ while he lay at saint Lyse: by occasyon of which dreme / he ordained the
deuyse of the flyeng Heart / as I was than informed. Ca. iiii. C.vi.
IT fortuned while the king lay at saint Lyse: on a night as he lay in his
bed a sleep / he had a visyon. It seemed to him properly that he was in the
cite of Aras / where as he had never ben before / and with him all the chiualry
of the realm of France. And he thought y^ thither came to him therle of
Flaunders / and did set on his fist a fair faucon pelerin / saying to him
thus. Sir / I give you this faucon / for the best that ever I saw: y^ best
flyeng and beater down of fowls. Of which present / the king thought he had
great joy / and said. Fair cosyn I thank you. And therewith / he thought he
regarded the constable of France sir Olyuer Clysson / and said unto him. sir
Olyuer / let us two go in to the feldes to prove this gentle faucon / that my
cosyn of Flanders has given me. And than he thought / the constable answered
him and said. sir let us go when it pleases you. and so than he thought /
that they took their horses they two alone / and went in to the feldes: and
found plentic of heerons to fly at. Than the king said / constable / let the
faucon fly / and we shall se how she will chase her game. Than the constable
cast of the faucon / and she mounted so high in to y^ air / that they could
scant se her. and the king thought she took her way straight in to Flanders.
than the king said / let us ride after my bird / I would not lose her. and
so he thought they rode after / till they came to a great maryse / and to a
thick wode. Than y^ king said / let us light a foot / for we can not pass
this wode a horse back And so they a lighted: and tha^ he thought that
varlettes came to the^ and took their horses. and so the king and the
constable entered in the wode with great pain / and traueyled so long y^ they
came to a fair great launde. And there y^ king thought / he saw his faucon
chasyng herons / and fightyng with them and they with him. And it seemed to the
king / that his faucon chased so y^ herons / that at last he lost the sight of
her. Wherewith he thought he was sore displeased / seeing that he could not
follow his hawk. and thought he said to the constable. A / I fear me I shall
lose my faucon / whereof I am sorry. And I have no lure nor nothing else /
wherewith to call her again. And at this point / the king thought that there
apered suddenly before him / a great Heart with wings / and enclyned him self
before him: whereof he had great joy. and thought how he said to the
constable. Sir / abide you here / and I will mount on this Heart / and so follow
my faucon. And so the king thought / he mounted on this flyeng Heart, and how
y^ heart acordyng at the kings desire / did bear him over all the great wodes
and trees. and there he same how his faucon beat down great plenty of fowls
/ so y^ it was marueyle to behold. And than it seemed to the king / when his
faucon had long flyen and beaten down many herons. Than he thought he called
her / and inco^tynent y^ faucon came and sat her down on his fyst. And than
the Heart flewe again over the wodes / and brought the king to the same launde
/ where as the constable tarried for him: who had great joy of his coming. And
as soon as he was a lyghted / he thought the Heart departed / and than never
saw him after. and so there the king thought how he showed to the constable
how that the Heart had borne him easly: he never rode so easly before. and also
he thought he showed him / of the bounty of his faucon. And therewith it seemed
to him / that his varlettes ca^e to them and brought them their horses. And so
they mounted and took the high way / and so came again to Arras. And
therewith the king awoke and had great marueyle of that visyon / And he
remembered every thing thereof right well / and showed it to them of his chamber
/ that were about him. And the figure of this Heart pleased him so much / that
all his ymaginacion was set thereon. And this was one of y^ first incydentes /
that when he went in to Flanders to fight with the flemynges / he took to his
deuyse to bear the flyeng Heart.

PHilyppe Dartuell / for all his good aduentur at the begyuning of his battle
against them of Bruges / and for all the good fortune / that he had in the
discontyture of therle and of them of Bruges. yet for all that he was no
subtle man of war / another in sautyng nor layeng of siege. For he had not
ben brought up therein in his youth / he had been more used to fisshe with an
angle rod in the river of Lescalt. The which well apered while he lay at
siege before And warpe / for he could not get y^ town He thought by
presumpcyon / that the sight of him should have made them of Andewarpe to have
yielded the^ to him / but they were nothing so disposed. For they bare them
self like valyant men / and made often times scrimysshes at the barryers / and
slew and hurt diverse of the flemynges: and drew again in to their town
without any damage. And of such issues La^bert of Lambres and Trystram his
brother / and the lord of Lunelhyen bare the greattest reno^e The flemynges
saw well / how the dykes of the town were large and full of water / so that
they could not a proche to assatle it / but with much pain and danger. Than
they determined among them self to get fagottes and straw / and so to fill
the dykes to come to the walls / to fight hand to hand. And as they ordained
so it was done. How be it / they within made no count of the^ / and said. that
if there were no treason among the^ self nor in the town / they would set no
thing by the siege that they saw laid to them. And so therefore sir Danyell of
Halwyn / who was captain there / to bring every thing out of doubt / kept him
self day and night ever above the^ of the town. and he so ordained that there
was none of them of y^ town should come on the walls of the town / without
company of some of the men of war: if they did / they lost their heedes for
their labors. this lay still this siege. the flemynges had great plenty of
vitayls coming to them by land and by water / for they were lords of all the
country of Flanders. for always for wynning of money / the countries of
Flaunders / Holande / zelande / and Brabant / and also part of Haynault by
stelthe / brought ever vitayles to their host. This Philyp dartuell had ever
his courage more englisshe than french / and would gladly that he had been alyed
with y^ king of England. Whereby he thought that if the french king / or duke
of Burgoyne came on him with an army / that he should be aided by the
englysshmen. He had all ready in his host a. CC. archers of England / the
which were stolen out of y^ garyson of Calys / and so took wages there of him /
and were wekely paid.

Of the messangers that Philyppe Dartuell sent in to England and also in to
France / and of the death of sir Parducas Dalbret. Cap. iiii. C.vii.
PHilyp Dartuell / to the intent to color his deeds / and to know what was
said of him in France. He determined to write in the name of the hole country
of Flaunders / to the french king. submytting them self / and requyring y^
king to tak^ some busynes for the^: as to bring the^ again i^ to parfyte love
with their lord the earl of Flanders. So thus he wrote certain letters to
the kyage and to his counsel / and delivered the^ to a messanger. Commaundyng
him / to go to the king with the letters / and so he did. And rode so long /
that he came to saint Lyse / where he found the king and his uncles / to
whom he delivered his letters. The king took and reed his letter / in ye
presens of his uncles and of his counsel. As Soon as they were reed and well
understand / they did nothing but laughed thereat. And than^e it was ordained
/ to take the messanger / and to set him in prison / because he was come to the
presens of the king / without any save conduct. and so there he remained more than
three wekes. When Philyppe Dartuell knew it / he had great indygnacion thereat /
and caused to come before him all the capitayns of the host / and than he said
to them. Sirs: ye may se what honor the french king does to us / sithe we
have written to him so amyably, and there upon he has recayned our messenger /
and keeps him in prison. Certainly this constrey / neth us sore / to be alyed
with the englisshmen. for think not the contrary / but that the duke of
Burgoyne / who is all in France. and leads the king there as he list him
self / for the king is but a child. think you yt he will leave this matter as
it is: nay surly* ensample by our messanger / whom he keeps in prisone.
Wherefore we have good cause to send in to England / as well for the common weal
of Flanders / as for our suretye / and to give dout and fear to our enemies.
Therefore I would we should send a ten or.xii. of the most notablest of our men
/ whereby the knowledge thereof might come in to France so that the king there
and his counsel / should think / how we will alye our self with y^ king of
England / their adversary. how beit I will not that the same alyance be
shortly made without we have more need / thanne we have as yet. but I would our
men should enter in to a communicacyon / and so to do we have just cause. and
to demand of the king of England the so^me of two hundred thousand crowns
/ which sum / Jaques Dartuell my father / and the country of Flanders. lent
sometime to ye king of England / while he was before Tourney at the siege / to
pay therewith his sowdyers. and so I would our men should say to the king of
England and to his uncles / and to his counsel. how that generally / all
the countye of Flaunders / and the good towns thereof such as lent the said
so^me / desires to have again the said so^me. And so that done / than to offer
the king of England to enter into Flaunders / and so into France if he list.
For surely I think it were bett for us to aid ourselfe with our own / than
to have help of strangers. And I think / we shall never attain to it /
sooner than now. for y^ king and realm of England / I think will not
forsake the alyau^ce / of such a country as fla^ders is now. For as now /
the^glysshmen have not on y^ see cost / between Burdeux and Scluse. Except
Calys / Chierburge / and Breast: where for to land and enter in to France.
Therefore the country of Flaunders / should serve the^ well at the point. For
Bretayne except Breast / is closed against them. And the duke of Bretaygne has
sworn to be good french. And if he be not he will come thereto / because of the
love of his cosyn germayne / therle of Flaunders. Than all they that herd
Philyp speak / answered and said. Philyp / ye have full well spoken: and we all
will that it be thus done. For whosoever will the contrary / loves not the
common profit of Fau^ders.

Philyp Dartuell tarried not long / but that he wrote to Peter de Boyse and to
Peter de myrt who were capitayns of Bruges. And also to the^ of Ipre and
Courtrey: showing them his said purpose. And all they thought it good / so to
be done. So there were chosen of the good towns of Flaunders / one or two
burgesses of every town / and out of the town of Gau^tsixe. First there was
chosen / Frau^ces Atreman and Raze de Uerdell / Loys de vaux / sir John^
stotler / Martyn bondrell / water jacob berner / and a clerk who was chosen to
be bishop of Gau^t by pope Urbane. For master John^ dalbrest / who had been
deane of our lady church in Turney / he aduysed in his time / that there should
be a bishop in Gaunt. And to posses and have the profytes / y^ the bishop of
Turney should have had. and so when these.xii. burgesses were ready aparelled /
they took their leave and departed fro the siege before And warpe / about the
beginning of the month of July. And did so much / that they came to Calais:
and the captain there / called sir Johan Dalbrenes received the^. And when he
knew that they would go into England / he purueyed them of ships. And so
they tarried there but three days / and took their passage and aryued at Dover /
and so went to London. at which time the king and perte of his counsel: as
ser Johh^ mo^tagu / ser Simon burle / and sir Willm^ beacha^p were at Westminster.
To enheryte ser Perducas dalbret / of all the barony of Chaumont in gascone the
which was as than / in the kings hands. I shall show you by what manner. king
Edward of old time / had given it to sir Johan Chandos / and he held it as
long as he lyu^^: and after his death / it was given to sc Thomas Felton. And
he was as than newly deed. and so thereby the lands fell again into the kings
hands the which land / might not long be without a governor to keep it. For
it joined to y^ lands of the lord Dalbret / who as than^e was good french.
Than it was abuysed / by the king of Englandes counsel / that sir Perducas
Dalbret / who had well served y^ kings of England / both Edward / Richard /
and the prince: and all the country of Burdeloyse / more than.xxx. yer.
wherefore it was thought / he was well worthy to have that land / and was well
able to defend and keep it fro all men. Sir Perducas dalbret / when he
received this lands. He said unto the king / in the presens of his counsel /
and other noble men. sir / I take and receive this heritage / to me and to mine
heirs / on the condycion to serve you against all men: except the house of
Dalbret / fro whens I am come. For against them shall I never make war / if
they suffer mine heritage to be in rest and peace. the king answered and said:
he was content. And so put him in possessyon of the land.

Now shall I show you / what fell of this Parducas Dalbret. When he was come
in to Gascoyne / and had taken possessyon of the lands / and the seneshall of
Burdeloyse / had given him possessyon. Than the lord Dalbret had great joy
thereof / for he thought well than / that his cosyn would make him no war. And
so y^ lands of Dalbret and Chaumont / abode in good love and rest. And the
lord Dalbret held in great love his cosyn / for he hoped ever / after his
dyssease / he would put him in possessyon of the said lands of Chaumounte.
But this sir Parducas / was not so minded. for at last when he lay on his death
bed / and that he saw he must needs dye. he called before him all his men /
and did se^de for a young squier of his / a proper man of arms: called Parduche
/ and said to him. I give the here in the presence of all my men / all the
lands of Chaumo^t / so thou be ever good english: and true and faithful to
the king of England. but I will yt the house of Dalbert / out of the which we
become / that thou make there against no war / without they do some outrage to
the. The squier answered and said. sir / your commandment shall be done. this
Perduche of Albert was lord of Chaumo^t in gascone. and thus dyed sir perducas
/ I can show no more of him.

How the king of Englandes counsel mocked the flemynges / and of the
prisoners that were exchaunged. Cap. CCCC.viii.
When these gauntoyse were come to London / the king and his counsel was
certifyed thereof. and so he sent to them / to know what they would have. and so
they came all in a company to the palace of Westmynster and there they found
ready the duke of Lancastre / the earl of Buckyngham / therle of Salisbury / and
the most part of the kings counsel. How be it / the king was not present
at their first coming. These men of Flaunders and of Gaunte / enclyned them to
the lords of England. and than the clerk that was chosen bishop of Gau^t /
spoke for them all / and said. My lords / we become hyder / and sent fro the
town of Gaunt / and fro the hole country of flaunders. To have counsel /
confort / and aid of the king of England. Upon certain artycles and good
reasons / of the au^cyent alyau^ces / between England and Flanders. They
desire now to renew y^ same. for it is now needful to the country of
Flanders / the which is as now without a lord. The good towns and the
country / has as now but a governor / the which is a man called Philyp
Dartuell. who recommaundeth him principally to the king / and to you all y^ be
of his counsel. and he desires you to take in gre / this offer that we shall
make to you. And that is / when soever it shall please y^ king of England /
to arryue in Flaunders / he shall find the country opyn to receive him / And
there to rest and refresshe him / as long as it shall please him. And also /
he shall have at his commandment / of the country of flanders / a hundred
thousand men armed ready to do him service. Moreover my lords / the country of
Flaunders / makes one request / and that is this. To have again / two hundred
thousand crowns / that sometime Jakes Dartuell and the good towns of
Flanders / lent to king Edward of good memory. At the sege of turney / and
at the siege of Calais. For it is the entencyon of the good towns of Flanders
/ that or this alyau^ce pass any farther / to be first repayed of this said
some. And that done / than y^ king of England and all his / may well say / y^
they and the flemynges are friends together. and y^ they have fre enter into
Flaunders / to go where as it shall please them. And when the lords of
England herd those words and request / they began each of the^ to regard
other: and some smyled. Than the duke of Lancaster said. Fair lords of
Flanders / your words and demand requires to have counsel. Go your ways
to London to your logynges / and the king shall take advise on your requests:
and shall so answer you / that ye ought to be content. The gauntoyse answered
and said. God grant it. and so they departed fro the counsel / and the
lords abode still to guyder: and began to laughe among them self / and said.
Have ye not seen these fleminges / and herd their requests that they make.
They demand to be conforted / and say / how they have need thereof. and yet
for all that / they demand to have our money. It is no reasonable request /
that we should both aid and pay. So thus they reputed the flemynges right
proud and presumptuous * to demand to have again / two hundred thousand
crowns: of so old debt (as they said) of a.xl. year paste. There was never a
better point for the french king / if he will / than to come into flanders.
For if the flemynges had not as than / demanded the foresaid sum of crowns
/ but have desired the king of his confort and aid. The king would have gone
or sent into Flanders / so puissauntlye: to have bydden battle (with the aid
of the flemynges) to any prince of the world. But it went otherwise: as ye
shall herafter in the story.

UIdynges came into France to the counsel there. Now that Philyp Dartwell
(whose courage was all english) and y^ country of Flaunders / had sent in to
England certain of their men / to make aly au^ces with thenglysshmen. And the
voice ran / and the common renome: that the king of England with a great
puissau^ce / should come in that season and aryue in Flanders * and to lie in
Gaunt. these tidinges were lightly to be believed / how that the flemynges
would fortify them self * in some manner awyse. Than it was devised / y^ the
messanger that was come fro Philyppe Dartuell / who^e they held in prison *
should be delivered. And to say the truth / there was no cause why to retain
him. so he was delivered / and sent to thost before And warpe. The same season
they of Bruge* had taken certain burgesses of turney / and kept the^ in prison.
The flemynges she wed well / how they had as live have war with France as
peace. And when they of Tourney / saw that they did so much * than they
atrapped / and took certain burgesses of Courtrey and so kept them in prison
in Tourney. Thus there engendered hatred daily / between France and Flanders.
howbeit the lords of Tourney would not that their deed / should be a tytell of
war to the flemynges / who were their neighbors / without it were by the
commandment of the french king. The which commandment they had not as
than. Therefore they devised to send two of their burgesses to y^ flemynges /
and to have in eschange / prisoners for prisoners. so there was chosen to go on
this message / Johan Bone and John^ Pycart. And so they went to thoost before
And warpe / and spoke with Philyp dartuell. Who for the honor of the city of
Tourney / and not for love of the french king (as he said) welcomed: and
received the^ amyably. For Philyp said: how the king had not deserved their
love. When that their messa^ger sent to him for a good intent / should be put
in prison. sir quod the two burgesses. ye have again your messa^ger. That is
true quod Philyp / but y^ was more for fear than for love. But sirs / tell me
wherefore ye become to us. sir quod the burgesses / it is to have again our
men of the city of Tourney / that be in prison at Bruges. A sirs quod Philyp /
if they keep them / in like wise / so do ye keep of our men of Cortrey. but
sirs / ye shall not lose your coming. Render again ours / and we shall render
yours. sir quod they / ye speak well and so shall it be done. So there they were
acorded to make this eschange. and so Philyp dart well wrote to Peter de Boyse
and to Peter de Myrt / being at Bruges: that they should deliver the prisoners
of Tourney / and to receive for them the prisoners of Courtrey. And so when
they deperted / Philyp Dartuell said to the^. sirs / take heed what I say / I
will not betray you. ye be of the town of Turney / the which is under the
french king / with whom we will have no treaty / until the season y^
Teremonde and Andwarpe be opyned to us. Therefore sirs / come no more to us /
for they that do / shall not go home again. Therefore co^strayne your people
and merchants / another to come nor go in to Flanders. and they do on their
ieoperdy. For we look for none other thing / but that the french king will
come and make us war. The burgesses of Tourney understood well those words /
and so deperted and returned to Turner: and showed as ye have herd before. Than
there was made a commandment / y^ non should go a merchandise in to flanders.
on pain / to be in the indygnacyon of the french king. and so the prisoners
were delivered but they of Tourney durst not marchau^dyse with them of
Flanders. But when they would have any marchau^dyse of Fla^ders: than they
would go to Ualencennes. For they of Heynaulte / of Holande / of zelande / of
Brabant / and of Liege might go and come / and make their marchau^dyse through
all Flaunders. Thus the sege lay still before Andwarpe. Philyp Dartuell and
they of Gaunt / lay on the mount of Andewarpe / on the side toward Heynalte.
and there were his engyns / and great bombardes and gonnes: The which made
such noise when they were losed / that the noise thereof * might well be herd
six leages of. and next were lodged they of Bruges / beyond the river of
Lescalt. And next them: they of Ipre / of Courtrey / of Proprigne / of Cassell
/ and of the frank of Bruges so that they vyroned round about the town.
Thus the town was enuyroned. And the fle^mynges thought by this siege / to
famyne them within. And sometime they within would issue out / and sometime wan
and sometime lost / as aue^ture falls often times in such cases. but there was
none assaut made. for Philyppe dartuell would not folisshely adventure his men
/ for he said: he would have them without any assaut. Seeing / how they could
have no conforte fro any part. A bird could scant have flyen in to the town
/ but that some of the host should have seen her. It was so set round about.

Letters sent to Philyp dartuell fro the co^myssaries of the french king. And
how the messangers that bare the letters / were taken and set in prisone. Cap.
CCCC.ix.
Now let us return to the french king. His uncles and the counsel of
France detmyned to send to Turney / certain prelates and knights of the
realm / to treat with the flemynges / and to know more plainly their
ente^tes. So there were appointed to go to Tourney / sir Miles of Ormayns bishop
of Beauuoys / the bishop of Anxere / the bishop of Lan / sir Guy of Honcourt
/ and sir Trystram de boyse. And so all these came to Tourney / as co^myssaries
fro the french king. And there was Johan Bone enfant and John^ Pycart / who
were newly come thither / fro the sege before Andwarpe. and they showed to these
co^myssaries and lords of France how that Philyppe Dartuell / when they took
their leave of him / said to them. sirs / we will never harken to any treaty /
till And warp and Teremonde be to us opyned. Well quod these lords / Philyp
Dartuellis of great pride. how beit / yet he is not master of all the good
towns in Flaunders. Therefore / let us send and write to Gaunte / to Bruges /
and to Ipre: and let us send to every town a letter and a messanger. We must
have some manner of enter of comunycacion / if we purpose to begin. Than they
wrote three letters to the three pricipall towns of Flanders / and in every
lr^e / they began ever with Philyp dart well the content of the said letts here
follows.

TO Philyppe Dartuell and to his co^panyes / and to the good people of the three
towns of Flanders / and to the frank of Bruges. Please it you to know /
that the french king has sent us into these parties. In hope y^ good peace and
concord may be made / between the noble prince therle of Flanders his cosyn /
and the comors of the country of Flanders. For the renome and brute rynncth /
How y^ ye go about / to seek alyau^ce with y^ king of England. Which thing
is against reason / and to the prejudice of the realm of France / and of the
crown royal the which the king may in no wise suffer. wherefore we desire you
/ in y^ name of the french king / that ye will give us saueco^duct. To the^tent
y^ we may go and come / and send in and out to make the peace. And to bring
the matter to such a co^clusyon / that the king may be content. Prayeng you /
to write to us an answer of your ententes in this behalf. And thus our lord
keep you. Written at Tourney / the.xvi. day of Octobre.

When these three letters co^teyning one thing were written and sealed / they
were delivered to three men. And it was said to them. ss / ye shall go to Gau^t
/ ye to Bruges / and ye to Ipre. And bring us again an answer. they answered
it should be done / and so they deperted every man his way. And when the one of
the^ aryued at Gau^t / Philyp dartuell was there the same time / or else they of
Gau^t / would not have opyned the letter without him. and so he opyned y^
letter and reed it / and when he had done he laughed thereat. and so depted fro
Gau^t / and returned to the sege before Andwarp and bare the lr^e with him /
but the messa^ger abode still in prisone in Gaunte. And when he was come to the
siege / he called to him the lord of Harsels / and other of his co^panyons:
and reed to them the letter / send fro the french kings commyssaries: and
said. Sirs / me think the frenchmen do but tryfell with me / and with the
country of Flanders. I said or this to the burgesses of Turney / when they
were here before me. That I would here no tidings out of France / nor entende
no no treaty: Without And warpe and Teremonde were yelden to us. and therewith
came tydinges to them fro Bruges / and fro I pre / how they had received like
letters / and the messengers retained and set in prison. that is well said
(...) Philyp / and than he said: how he would write again to the commyssaries
of France / and so he did. He wrote on the superscripcyon. To the right noble
and discrete lords / co^myssaries of France / the content of which letter
follows.

RIght dear and puissaunt lords / to your right noble discressyons. please it
you to know / that we have received right amiably / the letters to us sent*
fro y^ right excellent Charles of France. Making mencyon / how that ye right
noble lords ar come to Tournay / for to treat for peace and acord in his name.
between us / and the right high prince the earl of Flaunders / and his said
country. And how that ye have / by the said king and his counsel:
suffycyent puyssance and authorite / to conclude and acomplyssh. as they of
Tourney our right dear and good fre^des bear wytnes / by their letters
pate^tes: by us seen and reed. And because that the king writes: that it is
right displesaunt to him / that the discord has so long endured. Whereof we
have great marueyle / how it may be. for in time past: when Gaunt was assysed
/ And warpe was of little valur. And also / when that we by the common* counsel
of the three good towns of Flanders / wrote unto him as to our sovereign lord
/ to have made peace and accord. and as than / it pleased him not so to do /
the which now seems to us he would do. and also in like manner: we have
received letters patentes co^teyning / how that two times ye have written to
us / and that ye have come two times for the same ententes. But acordyng to y^
answer we have sent you or this / that we have no will nor intent to harken to
any treaty of peace. with out the towns and fortresses / which be closed
against the country of Flaunders / and specially against the town of Gau^t.
Whereof we be regard / be opyned at our will / and at the commandment of the
good town of Gaunt. And Without this be first done / we can make no treaty as
ye desire. For we think the king does and may do assemble great puyssaunce /
for y^ aid of his cosyn in the color of this treaty. For we se well / y^
falls head may be wrought in the mean time / as there has been done or this.
Wherefore our entencyon is / to be sure and ready at our defense. Our host shall
be ready apparelled to defend our enemies: for we hope by the aid of god / to
have y^ vyctorie / as we have had or this time. Moreover / we give you
knowledge: that the brute is. How ye think / that we of Flaunders treat / to
have alyaunce with the king of England: and to have socoure of him. Wherein ye
say / we do against right / because we be subjects to the crown of France.
And how that the king there / is our soueraygne lord. Wherefore ye say / we
ought to aquyte us truly against him. And so we have done or this / for in
time past / we have send to him our letters / as to our soueraygne lord /
requyring him to have made our peace: whereunto he has given us none answer /
but our messa^ger taken and set in prisone. The which we think a great
blame in such a lord. And moreover / yet we repute in him more blame / in
that we wrote to him / as to our sovereign lord: and he not willing to send
us an answer* And because it pleases him not so to do. We thought and yet
think / to seek for the profit of the country of Flanders / by some other
means / and to such as will help us. How beit / as yet there is nothing:
but that the king may help all the matter / so that the forteresses be opyned
to us. And therefore / we defended them of Tourney / when they were last with
us in our host / that they should no more come in such manner to us / with any
manner of letters or crede^ce by mouth / without saueco^duct. And yet for all
that / they be come to Bruges and to Gaunt with other letters. wherefore we have
taken the messangers / in gyueng ensample to other / to bring any such
letters. For we think ye study some treason / and specially against me
Philyppe Dartuell / fro the which god defend me. Wherefore / we will ye know
/ that your traueyle is for naught / without so be the fortresses be opyned to
us: the which we trust by the aid of god shortly shall be. And thus God keep
you / written before Andewarpe / the.xx. day of Octobre. The year of our lord
god / a thousand three hundred.lxii. By Philyp Dartuell regard of Flaunders.

When Philyppe Dartuell had thus written his letter / by the aduyce of his
counsel / and had well examyned it / and so sealed it: than he bethought him
who should bear it. and so demanded / if there were no prisoner taken before
Andwarpe. and it was showed him / how there was a varlet of Arthoyse / taken
the day before at a scrimysshe. than he commanded / that he should be brought
before him / and so he was. Than Philyppe said / thou art my prisoner / I may
make the to dye and I will. howbeit / sith thou art here / thou shalt be
delivered / upon covenant on thy faith. y^ thou shall deliver such letters
as I shall take the: to the french kings counsel / now being at Tourney.
And when the varlet hard spekyng of his delyueraunce / he was never so ioyouse
/ for he went verily to have dyed / and said. sir: I swear to you by my faith
/ that I shall bear your letter / whyder it shall please you / and if it be
into hell. Than Phylyp began to laughe. and said: thou say well and so
Philyppe gave him two crowns / and delivered him the letter / and caused him
to be conveyed out of the host / and set in the way to Turney. And when he
ca^e to Turney he went to the lodging of the bishop of Laon / and so he
came before the bishop / and did his message / fro point to point. and there
was demanded of him tydinges / of the host before Andwarpe / and he showed as
much as he knew / and so dyned there. And after dinner y^ bishop departed to
his company / and would not open the letter / till they were present. And when
the three bysshoppes were all together / they opyned the letter / and read it at
good leyser / and made due examynacion thereof. Than they spoke together / and
said: how that Philyp Dartuell by that he showed / was full of pride and
presumpcion. and said / how that he loved but little the majesty royal of
France. And so took counsel together / and said: how that the Provost and
counsel of the town of Turney. knew right well / how they had sent letters
to Philyp Dartuell / and to the other towns of Flaunders. wherefore they said:
it should be well done / that they should here the answer that Philyp had made.
And so sent for the provost / and sowned the common bell / and all the counsel
drew together. and than before the^ all the letter was red two or three dtymes.
The wise men ha great marueyle of the presu^ptuous words y^ were therein
written. and so it was determined that a copy of the letter should remain
still in Turney. and therewith the counsel deperted / every man to his logyng.

PHilyp Dartuell / being still in the host before And warpe. repented him
nothing of that he had written so roughly to the comyssaryes of France. but he
repented him / in that he had written so amiable / to the provost and the^ of
turney. she wyng them honor / by way of dissymulacion. but he did it / because
he would not bear all the blame / nor norisshe all the hate y^ might fall
thereby. So thus Philyppe wrote to them in manner as follows. And the
superscripcyon was. To y^ right honorable and sage / our dear friends / the
provost and cytezins of Tourney.

Of the letters sent to Tourney fro Philyp Dartuell. and how the french king
and his counsel / were informed of the answers that the flemynges had made to
the comyssaries. Cap. CCCC.x.
RIght dear and good fre^des. Please it you to know that we have received your
letters. making mencyon of.ii. of your burgesses / and yuell bearers of
letters / to Gaunt and to Bruges / fro the comissaryes of France / who be
retained by us. and at your requests to be delivered out of prisone. whereby
the good love and affectyon that has been / between you and the commons of
Flanders / should perceyuer as ye write. the which love right dear friends:
semythe to us to be right little. For it is come to our knowledge / that the
french king / and the dukes of Burgoyne and of Brytayne / assembleth them
together / to come and aid the earl of Flaunders. and to recover his country /
and to fight with us (for all y^ letters that ye have sent us. to treat for
peace) Wherefore / we think this no way to treat for peace. But we shall take heed thereof / and are ready and shall be / ever at our defense / day and night.
And as for the prisoners your burgesses / we shall keep the^ with us: till we
know the certe^tie of the asse^bles of these said lords / and till it be our
pleasure to deliver the^. For when your burgesses were last in Fladu^ers / to
treat for peace. ye know well / there it was ordained and commanded / that no
person fro thens for the with letters nor otherwise / should go nor come
without saueco^ducte. and these said comyssaries have done the contrary / to
thentent to make debate and dyscorde. Wherefore dear friends / we desire you
that ye will send no parsone / burges nor other in to Flaunders / fro you nor
fro none of the lords. but if there be any thing tou chynge your own cawses /
that we may do for you. we shall do: in like manner as we would / ye should do
for us. for we have aspeciall trust and affyaunce in you / as we ought to have
in our good neighbors. For it is the general entencyon of all Flaunders /
that all marchantes and their marcha^dyses: should pass and repasse safelye /
out of the one country in to the other / without any interupcyon or let. And
thus god keep you. written in our host before And warpe / the xxii. day of the
month of October. The year of our lord god / a thousand three hundred
fourscore and two. By Philyp Dartuell regard of Flaunderrs.

About a three days after that ye first letters were sent to the lords
comissaryes of France. as the lords were in the hall in counsel / there was
brought to them these other letters by a varlet of Doway / and he showed them /
how that they of the host before Ande warpe / had sent it to the^. So there
the letter was received / and read at good leysour. and than finally the
lords of France / said to them of Tourney. Sirs: we counsel you for the
best / that ye make none alyaunce / nor a quayntance with them of Flanders.
for and ye do / ye shall have no thank thereof in France. nor receive no
letters sent to you fro them. for if the kings counsel know that ye do / ye
shall receive blame and damage thereby / for the matter can not long continue as
it is. and they of Turney answered / and said: how they would perceyuer in
their counsel. sayng / that by the grace of god / they would do nothing /
whereby they should have any reprofe. and so a three days after / the
commissaryes departed fro Tourney / and went to the king to Peron. and with
him was his three uncles / the dukes of Berrey / Burgoyne / and Burbon.

ANd the day before the earl of Flaunders was come to the king / to show him
the greues yt he had / and to do feaulte for the countye of Arthoyse / the
which was fallen to him the same year / by the death of his mother. And when
ye said comyssaries were come to the king / before him and all his counsel /
there was red the two letters / that Philyp Dartuell and they of Flaunders had
sent to them of Tourney. the which they took in great dispyte / and said: that
in the beginning of the kings raygne / such pride / as was than used in
Flaunders / Ought not to be suffered. With the which words / the earl of
Flaunders was no thing dyscontent. And so there the Earl before the king and
his counsel / made his complayntes / which were well hard. And the king
answerde him / and said. Cosyn / return you in to Arthoyse / and breuely we
shall be at Aras. for we can not show better that the quarrel should be ours /
but to a proche our enemies. the earl was well content with that answer / and
so departed and went to Hedyn. And the king (as he that would go in to
Flaunders / to abate the pride of the flem mynges / as his predecessors had
done before) set all his clerks awarke / and sent letters and messangers in to
every cost of his realm. commaundynge every man without delay: in their best
aparell for ye war / to come to him to Arras / at a day lymited. showing
them: how by the pleasur of god / he would go and fight with the flemynges in
Flaunders. No man durst disobey / but every man made them ready both nere and
far. as they of Auuergne / of Rouergue / of Tholousyn / of Gascoyne / of
Limosyn / of Poyctou / of Xaynton / of Bretayne / and of Bur bonoyse / of
Forestes / of Burgoyne / of Doulphyn / of Sauoy / of Barroyse / of Lorayn / and
of all the cyrcuites and countries of France. And so every man came toward
Arras in Arthoyse. There was so great an assemble of men of war / that it was
marueyle to consider.

How Philyp Dartuell made the passages in Flanders to be kept / and how
diverse french knights were lost in Flaunders / and could not return again.
Cap. CCCC.xi.
THe Earl of Flaunders being at Heden / hard every day news fro the king /
and fro ye duke of Burgoyn and of ye great assemble that was made in France.
Than the earl commanded through all the country of Arthoyse / y^ no man on
pain of death / should put out of the country nor out of their logynges no
manner of thing in to any forteres / nor in to no closed town. for he would
that the men of war should be sarued and eased / with every thing abroad in
the country. And so the king came in to Arthoyse / where they found every
thing in great plenty / every grange full of corn. and so therle of Flanders
came to Arras and there did homage to the king for the county of Arthoyse. And
there the king received him for his liege man / and said to him. Fair cosyn /
if it please god and saint De nyce / we shall set you peaseably in your
heritage of Flaunders / and shall abate the pride of Philyp Dartuell and of the
flemynges / in such wise / that they shall never be able here after to rebel
again. Sir quod the earl: of this I have great trust / and thereby ye shall
attain to such honor / that all the world shall praise you / for certainly
great is the pride of Flaunders.

PHilyppe Dartuell being at siege before And warpe / was well enfourmed. how
the french king with his puissance / was coming on him. Than he said to his
men. sirs: what wenyth the young ryottouse king to enter in to Flaunders? he
is a year yet to young to assail us. I shall cause ye passages and entres to be
so kept / that it shall not lie in his power of all this year to pass the
river of Lyse. And so than he sent to Gaunt for the lord of Harsels / and when
he was come to him / he said. Sir of Harsels: ye know well and here daily /
how the french king apareleth him self to distroy us all. it behooves us to
regard wisely / and to take counsel in this matter sir: ye shall abide here
at the siege / and I will goo to Bruges to learn more certain tidings / and
to encorage the people of the good towns. and I shall stablissh such people
at the passages / y^ the french men shall not pass over. Thereto accorded the
lord of Harsels. Than Philyppe dartuell departed fro the siege / and so rode
to Bruges like a great lord / with his penon displayed before him of his
arms: he bare a field sable / three hat tes silver. When he came to Bruges he
found there Peter de boyse and Peter de myrt / who were capitayus of Bruges.
and there he showed them how that the french king with all his puyssance /
would come in to Flanders. Wherefore I will that ye Peter de Boyse / go to the
passage of Comynes / and keep the river. and ye Peter de Myrt / shall go to the
bridge of Warneston and keep that passage / and cause all ye bridges to be
broken above on the river / till ye come to Gerge / to Hasels / to Meureuylle /
and to Cour tray / and so the frenchmen can not pass. and I shall go to Ipre
to refresshe the^ / and to comfort them. Erortyng them to keep fermly the v^yt^
that we have sworn each to other. and it shall not be in the french kings
puyssance / to pass the river of Lyse / and to enter in to Flaunders / if the
passages be well kept. Than both Peter's answered / and said. Sir ye say well /
let it be done as ye say / but s: what word here you out of England. Truly
quod Philyppe we here as yet none / whereof I marueyle / but as now the
parlyament is at London / wherefore I think shortly / we shall here some word.
The french king can not be so hasty / but y^ I trust we shall have some aid
out of England. I hope the king of England makes some assemble / so that ye
englysshmen will aryue here in a night / with such a nombre / that we shall
not need to fear the frenchmen / with the aid of Flanders for all is under
our obeysaunce / except Teremonde / and And warpe. In the mean season that all
this besynes was / and that ye king was at Arras / and that these men of war
assembled in Arthoyse and Tournesyes / and about Lysle. Certain knights and
squiers being about Lysle / by the entysinge of the Hasell of Flanders:
thought to do some enterprise / where by to be renomed. And so on a day there
gadred together a sire score men of arms / knights and squiers / and rode and
passed the river of Lysle at Pounte amenyn a two le ages fro Lysle / the which
bridge was not broken. and so rode to the town of Harle / and so there chased
nigh all the people out of the town / so y^ the laram rose and the towns all
about range their belles alarm. And when the Hasell of Flaunders and sir Johan
of Jumo^t / the Chatelyn of Wyllone / sir Henry Du^^le / and the other knights
and squyers had well moved the country / and saw that it was time to return.
They took again the way to return by the same bridge that they had passed /
and there they found a great nombre of the flemynges breakyng the bridge / and
when they had broken a part thereof / they covered it again with hey and straw
/ that it should not be aspyed. and there these knights found ready aparelled to
give the^ battle a great nombre of villayns of the country. than the knights
couched their spears / and ran at the^ withal their force / and the flemynges
opened and gave them way. it was said for the nones / and fled and said
among themself / let us fly and give them way / for we are sure the bridge
will not bear the^ / we shall se anon good game. And so the Hasell of
Flaunders and the other knights dasshed all at ones on the bridge / the which
was not able to bear so many me^. how be it the Hasell and a.xxx. with him
passed over and as the other would have passed / the bridge brake under them /
and so fell down horse and men / and many were slain. And whan^e they that
were behind saw that / they were sore abashed / and wist not whyder to fly
to save themself. some entered in to the river / thynkinge to swymme over / but
they could not ye water was so deep / and the banks high. that the horses
could not get up / the which was great myschefe for them. for the flemynges
came on them and slew them without mercy / and mad some to fall again in to
the water / and were drowned. sir Johan Jumont was in a great adventure to be
lost / for the bridge brake under him. yet through the valyantnes of his body /
he saved him self. How be it he was sore hurt on the heed and on the body / so
that it was sire wekes after or he could help him self. In this recou^tre was
slain ye Chatelayn of Wyllon of Bouchars / and of saint Hilary / and diverse
other slain and drowned / and also sir Henry Duffle. There were slain and
drowned mo than threscore / for he was happy that could save him self / and
many hurt and sore wounded that escaped. Tydinges came to the lords of France
being at Arras / how their men had lost the journey / and how the Hasell of
Flanders had folysshly taken on him y^ enterprise. some complained them and
some not / and such as were expert men of war / said: they did great folly to
pass a river without any gyde / and to enter in to a great town / and to
return again the same way they went / without keeping of the ^assage in the
mean season. it was none enter^^se of wysemen of war / and because they rode
(...)the like foles / so it came by them.

The ordinance that the french king made for to enter in to the county of
Flaunders / after that the passages were stoped and broken. Cap. iiii. C.xii.
SO this matter passed over and was forgote / and Philyppe Dartuell departed fro
Bruges and went to Ipre / where as he was received with great joy. and Peter de
boyse went to Co^mynes / where as all men of the country were assembled. they
made all ye bridge to be vnuayled ready to be broken down inco^tynent / if need
required / but they would not clearly pull it down as than. for the aduau^tage
of them of the country to pass and repasse / with their beasts over the
water of Lyse. The same proper hour that Philyp Dartuell came to Ipre /
tydinges came / how that at the bridge of Amenyn / the frenchmen were
dystrussed / and how the Hase of Flaunders was nere taken. Of these tydinges
Philyppe Dartuell was greatly reioysed / and laughyng / to encourage them that
were about him / said. Sirs: by the grace of god and the good right that we
have / this matter shall take such an end / y^ if the king with his young
counsel pass the river of Lyse / he shall not return again into France.
Thus Philyp Dartuell was five days at Ipre / and preched openly in ye market
place / to encourage his people / and to cause the^ to keep their promise. And
also he showed them / how the french king / without any title of reason /
was coming to distroy the^ / wherefore he said. Good people be not abashed
though he come on us / for he shall not be of puyssaunce to pass the ryer of
Lyse. I shall cause the passages to be well kept / and I have ordained to be at
Commynes / Peter de Boyse with agreat nombre of men. he is good and true and
loves the honor of Flaunders / and Peter de Myrt is at Warneston / and all
the other passages on the water of Lysear broken / so that they can come over
at no place / but at one of those two. and also I have hard tidings of our
men that we sent in to England / we shall have shortly great comfort of ye
englysshmen / for we have good alyaunce with them. Therefore let us live in hope
/ for honor shall be with us. therefore good friends of Ipre be ye true / and
keep faithfully the promise that ye have promised ^o me / and to the good town
of Gaunt / who has endured so much pain / to maintain the right and fredome
of Flanders. and all such as will keep true promise with me / let them
hold up their hands toward heaven / in token of loyalte. And therewith all
such as had hard him speak lift up their hands. Than Philyp descended fro
the scaffolde / where as he had preched / and went to his lodging and tarried
there all that day / and the next day depted and went toward And warpe to the
sege / and he passed by Courtrey / and there tarried two days.

Now let us leave to speak of Philyppe Dartuell / and return to ye young king
Charles of France who was at Aras / having great will and desire to enter into
Flaunders / to abate the pride of the flemynges. And daily there repaired to
him men of war fro all parts. And when the king had soiourned there viii.
days / than he went to Lens in Arthoyse / and there tarried two days / and the
third day of Nouembre he departed and went to Seclyn / and there rested. And
there the chief constable of France / and the marshals of France / of
Burgoyn / and of Flanders / were in counsel how they should be ordered. for
it was a common saying in all the host / how it was a thing impossyble to
enter into Flaunders. seeing how the passages were so strongely kept. And also
daily it rayned so sore / that the ways were so enpayred / that men could
skant go forth / and some of the wise men of France said. home it was a great
outrage to enterprise that voyage in that season of the year / and to bring the
king so far forward into that country. sayng also how it had been better
for him to have tarried till. Somer / than to make war in that country /
where as he had never been before / and specially in that season of the year.
and also they said / how the river of Lyse is so yuell to pass / that there
is no place to skape / but at certain places. Thanne the marshals demanded
fro whens the river did come / and it was said / how it came fro Air / and
fro saint Omers. well quod the constable / sithe it has a beginning we shall
pass it well enough / let us order our people / and let us take the way to
saint Omers / and there shall we pass ye river at our ease / and so enter into
Flaunders. and let us go alonge the country / and the flemynges are so proud
that outher before Ipre or in some other place / they will come and fight with
us. And so to this purpose agreed all the marshals and thereupon rested all that
night. Than the next morning / the lord Dalbret / the lord of Coucy / sir
Aymemon of Pompers / sir John^ of Uyen admyrall of France / sir Willyam of
Poyctres / the bastard of Langres / the Begue of Uyllanes / sir Raoll of Coucy
/ the earl of Conversant / the vycount Dacy / sir Raoll of Rayneuall / the
lord of saint Just / sir Arture of Hedyn / sir Anton y Darchyes / the lord of
saint Pie / sir Willyam of Bordes / the lord Lo^geuple / ye lord of Sully /
sir Trystram of Lestouet / sir Olyuer Clesquyn / sir Moryce of Treguidy / ser
Guy of Bayeur / sir Lucas of Lestrughen / ser Nycholas Pamell / the two
marshalles of France / sir Loys of Saurere / and sir Loys of Blanuell / ye
marshall of Burgoyne / the marshall of Flaunders / and sir Anguerant of Helwyn.
all these came to the constable of France to take advise / how they should
pass outher by Lyle to go to Comynes / or else to Arualueston / where as the
passages were kept / or else to go higher up toward the Gorge of Uenoy / and to
saint Uenant / and so to pass ye river of Lyse. And so among these lords
there were diverse opinyons / and such as knew the country said. Surely as at
this time / it is no going into that country nor in to the land of Cassell /
of Surmes / nor of Uerthes. why what way shall we than hold quod the
constable? Than ye lord of Coucy said: I counsel let us goo to Tourney / and
there let us pass the river of Lescaulte / and take the way to Andewarpe /
that way is easy enough / and there let us fight with our enemies / we sha'l
have no let / and we be ones passed ye river and Tourney. and than let us go
straight to Andewarpe / and do ryghtfull judgment on Philyp Dartuell / and so
we shall be daily refresshed with vitayle and ^uruyance out of the cost of
Haynalt / the which shall follow us / fro Tourney along by ye river. These
words were well hard and with diverse well vpholden / but ye constable and
marchals inclyned rather to go the right way / another on the right hand nor on
the lift. and to sustain their opinyon they laid diverse reasons. sayng: if we
should go and seek for any other passage but ye right way it might be said /
that we do not like good men of war / at lest with out we assay to pass by
Comynes / the which is kept. and also if we withdraw our self fro our
enemies ward / they will be reioysed thereby / and have new refresshynge and
take new counsel / and say / how we be fled away. And also there is one
point that ought to be dowted / we know not in what astate they be in / with
ye englisshmen / for by incyde^t if aid should come to them out of yt cost /
it should be a great let for us therefore we think it were best to deliver ye
matter as shortly as coud be devised / therefore a gods name let us take the
way to Comynes / and god shall help us / we have or this time passed and
repassed great ryuers / more greater than the river of Lyse / it can not be
kept long fro us. at lest when we are at the river side than let us take
advise. Such as be in our company in the voward have seen this.xx. or.xxx.
year / often times passed / a more dangerous river than this is. and if we be
ones over / our enemies shall be a hundred times more abashed / than and we went
at our ease / on ye right hand or on the left out of our right way. and also
being ones over we may reken our self lords of all Flaunders. And so every
man acorded to this last apoyntment / the which was kept and not broken. and
because ye all the lords were as than together / they said. it is needful that
we advise and regard ye order of our batayls / and apoynt them that shall go
with the constable in the vowarde and to know who shall make ye ways before
the battle / and who shall be the fotemen and to ordeyne the^ that shall be
currers to discover our enemies. and who shall be in the kings battle / and
what service they shall do / and who shall bear the Oriflambe of France / and
to apoynt the^ that shall assyst it / and to know who shall be in the wings /
and who in the reregard. Of all these things they took advise and counsel /
and it was determined by the said lords and officers / that ser Joys of Halwyn
and the lord of Rambures / should be governors of the footmen / such as
should go before the host and make the ways. And to cut down hedges / wodes
/ and busshes / and to fill valeys and pull down hyls / and to do all other
necessary things / and of them there were in nombre a.xvii. hundred and.lx.
and than in the vowarde were the marshals / of France / of Flaunders / and of
Burgoyne / and they had under their rule a.xvii. hundred men of arms / and
seven hundred crosbowes / beside four thousand men a foot that the earl of
Flaunders had delivered them / well pauessed and harnessed. And it was ordained
that therle of Flaunders and his battle / wherein he had men of arms /
knights / squiers / and fotemen / to the nombre of.xvi. thousand should be
the wynge to the vowarde / for to recomfort it if need required. Also it was
ordained / that between the battle and the erls vowarde / the kings battle
should follow. and therein to be ye kings three uncles / Berry / Burgoyn / and
Burbon / the earl of March / sir James of Burbon his brethren / the earl of
Cleremount and Dolphyn of Auuergne / the earl of dampe Martyn / the earl of
Sanxere / sir John^ of Boloyne / and to ye nombre of six thousand men of
arms and two thousand crosbowes / genoways and other. And than it was
ordained for the reregarde / two. M. men of arms and two hundred archers. and
chyefe governor of them was sir John^ dartoyse earl of Ewe / ser Guy earl of
Bloyse / sir Warans earl of saint Powle / sir Wyllm^ earl of Harecourt / the
lord of Chastelon / and the lord of Sere. and to bear the Oryflambe was
appointed sir Peter villers / and sour knights to acompany him. As sir Robert
of bayeux / sir Moris of sancourt / ser Guy of Triguidy / and Bandon de laheuse
/ and to keep the baners the Bourge of ruet / and the Bourge of mount dowset.
These lords ente^ded surely never to return in to France / till they had
fought with Philyppe Dartuell and his puyssaunce. and therefore they made all
thing ready to fight the next day if need required. Also the lord de la Bret /
the lord of Coucy / and sir Hugh of Haulon were appointed to set and order the
batayls in array. and the marshals of ye lodgings were appointed to lodge the
king and ye battle / and that was sir Willyam of bannes / and the lord of
Champreny. Also it was ordained yt the day that the battle should be on / the
king to be a horseback / and none other but he / except.viii. valyant men /
to be a horsbacke about him. As the lord of Rayneuall / the Begue of villanes
/ sir Aymemon of Pomyers / sir Anguerant of Halwyn / the vycount Dacy / sir Guy
of Bayeux / sir Nycholas Penuell / and sir Willyam of Bourdes. Of the which
eight / the lord of Rayneuall and sir Anguerant of helwyn / to be in the
front before the king. And the Begue of Uyllayues / and the vycount Dacy /
who is called in diverse places before the Uycou^t dan noy / these two knights
to be beside him. and behind him the other four knights before named / and
sir Olyuer Clyssone Constable of France / and sir Willm^ Poycters bastard of
Langres should ride before / and dyscouer and advise the manner of their enemies
/ the day of the battle. And whan^e all these things were appointed and
determined / every thing as was needful. Thanne the counsel brake up / and
every man departed to their lodgings. And such as had not been at the
counsel: were showed what they should do and also it was ordained yt the next
day / the king should depart and to pass through the town of Lysle / and not
to rest there* but to lodge at the abbay of Marquettes / and the vowarde to
pass farther toward Comynes and Warneston / as soon as they might.

How the french men could not pass by the bridge of Comynes / and how they
passed without knowledge of the flemynges. Cap. iiii. C.xiii.
AS it was thus ordained every thing was done and the next day / they of the
vowarde dyslodged and went toward Comines / and they found the ways ready made
for ye lord of Fransures and sir Joyse of Helwyn / had taken great labor to
make the ways ready / and this was on a monday / and when the constable and
marshals and they of the vowarde were come to the bridge of Comynes / there
they were feign to stop / for they found the bridge so broken that it was
not possible to make it again / if any defense were made to the contrary. And
the flemynges were beyond the river puyssaunt enough. To let them and to keep
the passage against any that would scrimysshe or assaut them / for they were ^o
than.ix. thousand. And there was Peter de Boyse captain / who made good
semblant to defend the bridge. for he and his men were by the bridge on the
causey / raynging on both sides. Than the constable and the other lords of
France beheld the manner of the country. And ymagined well / that it was a
thing impossyble to pass that way / without the bridge were new made. Thafie
they caused some to ride up and down by the river side a mile or two / to se
if there were any passage / and they so did / and returned again and showed
their masters / that they could not find no place / where as their horses
could take any land on the other side of the river. Than the constable was
sore dyspleased and said. We have been but yuell cou^sayled to take this way.
yet it had been better to have gone by saint Omers / than to bide in this
danger. Orels to have passed the river of Lescaulte at Tourney / as the lord
of Coucy said. And so to have gone the straight way to And warpe / and to have
fought there with our enemies / sithe we must fight with the^ and will. They be
so proud / that they would have bydden us at theirsege. Than sir Loyes of
sa^xere said. I counsel let us lodge here for this day / and cause our
people to lodge as well as they can when they come. And let us send to Lyle
by the river / and get some ships and nails. And with them let us make a
bridge to morrow against ye fair ^aedowes / sith we can do none otherwise.
Than sir Joys of Halwyn said. Sir / we have well aduysed / how ye there is a
great let between this and Lysle. sir / the river is called Menyn. And by this
river the ships or barks must pass / if they should come hyder. And sir /
the flemynges have broken ye bridge / and have put in between the ioystes great
tymbre and stakes / that it is impossyble for any vessel to pass by. I can
not tell than quod the constable what we shall do. it were good we took the way
to Air / and there pass the ryuet of Lyse / sithe we can have no passage here.
In the mean season that the constable / and the marshals of France and of
Burgoyne / were about Comynes in this abusyon / and wist not what to do / there
were a certain knights and squiers enterprised valiantly to assay to pass
this river by some means / and to go fight with the flemynge / and to win
the town and passage of Comynes / as ye shall here after.

THus as the vowarde was come fro Lyle to Comynes / the lord of sait Pie and
diverse other knights. Of Heynalt / of Flaunders / of Arthoyse / and also of
France / without knowledge of the constable or marshalles. They were
determined together and said. We will go get two or three little botes / and
launche them in to the river of Lyse beneth Comynes / in some couerte place.
And we will set great stakes on both sides of the river to tie ropes thereto
/ for the river is not very large. And by that means / we shall get over a
great nombre of men in a short space. And than we may go and assail our
enemies behind them or they beware / and win the passage. And acordynge to
this counsel / the lord of saint Pie made to be brought out of Lysle / a
bark and ropes with other necessaries. Also sir Herbert of belperche / and sir
Johan of Roy / who were companyons toguyther in that voyage / brought with
them another bark. Also sir Henry of Manny / sir Johan of Malestrayt / and
sir John^ Chaudronne bretons / brought another. The lord of saint Pie was the
first that entredde with his bark cords / and stakes. And there he pytched a
great planke and stake on the one side / and tied a cord thereto. Than^e three
varlettes passed over to the farther side with the bark / and carried the other
end of the Cord with them. And there they set another great stake / and
tyedde that end of the Cord to the stake. and that done / than the varlettes
returned with the bark to their masters. and so it was that the constable of
France and the two marshals who were at the bridge foot of Comynes were anon
informed of the said besynes. than the constable said to sir Loys of Sa^xere
one of the marshals. sir go your way / and se if it be possible to pass the
river by y^ means / as ye have herd devised. And if ye se that it be possible
/ than find y^ means to get mo barks. and so these said knights prepared
the^ self ready to pass when they saw the barks ready. and there with there came
to them the said marshall of France with a great rout / and he beheld well
the manner. Than the lord of saint Pie said to him. sir / may it please you
that we shall pass. it pleases me right well quod the marshall. Howbeit ye
put yourselfe in a great adventure / for if your enemies at Comynes know of
you / they may do you great damage. sir quod the lord of saint Pyhe that
nothing adue^tureth nothing gets. In the name of god and saint Denis / we
trust to pass / so y^ ar to morrow at night we trust to fight with our
enemies. than the lord of saint Pie set his penon in the bark and entered
himself first / and with him to the no^bre if.ix. and a none they were
lau^ched for the by the cord that was tied on the other side of the river. and
than they issued out and went in to a little wode there beside / because they
would not be seen. and they on the rerewage drue again to the^ the bark. Than
entered therle of Co^uersant sir Da^ghien and his baner with him / and also the
lord of Uertayne his brother. and so.ix. of the^ passed and no mo / and again
the third time there passed as many. And therewith there ca^e two other barks
with sir Herbert of Belperch and sir John^ of roy and with the bretons. and
anon they were la^ged in to the river / and ordered as the other were. and so
knigh^es passed. and there was none that passed but good men of arms / and they
passed with so good will / that it was great marueyle to be hold them. And
there was such prese to pass that and the marshall had not been there / they
would have over charged the barks.

Tidings came to the constable and to the lords of France being at Comynes /
how their people passed as ye have herd. than the constable said to the
seneshall of Reur. go I require you and se yonder passage / and whider our
people do pass as it is said or not. This knight was never so ioyouse of
nothing that ever he herd. and so struck his horse with the spurs / and in
his company.xl. men of arms. and when he ca^e to the passage and saw the
manner thereof / and how that there were passed all ready / to the full no^bre of a
C. and.l. Than he a lighted and said. how he would pass in likewise / the
marshall of France could not let him. Tidings came to the constable / how
that his cosyn the lord of Rieux was passed over y^ river. Than the constable
a little began to muse and said. Cause the cross bows to come forth and
scrimyssh with these flemynges beyond the bridge to keep the^ busy / to
thentent that they take no head to our men that are passing the river. for if
they knew it / they would ryn to the^ and distroy their passage. ye / and sle
all them that are passed / y^ which I had rather dye / than it should come to
pass. Than the crosbowes and men a foot and gonners / shote over y^ brige in
to the town. And so there began a sore strimysshe / and they made semblaunt to
pass the bridge. And the flemynges who were well pauessed / made the^ ready to
defend the passage. and thus they endured all that monday / and anon it was
night / for the days were as than but short and still there passed men of arms
by the said barks. and as they were over / they drue together in a little grove
there beside in covert. Now behold all things co^sydred / when parell and
hard adventure that they were in. For if they within Comynes had perceived
them / they had been distroyed / or the most part of them / and had lost
both their barks and ropes. but god did for them / to thentent to abate the
pride of the flemynges.

How the frenchmen that were passed the river of Lyse / put them self in
battle before the flemynges. Cap. CCCC.xiiii.
I Repute and also every man ought to reken this enterprise to be of great
valyantnesse / for them that passed. For the knights and squiers of the
vowarde / when it was late / stale fro thost and went to the passage to pass
with their co^panyons. So there passed the lord de Lauale / the vycount of
Rohan / the lord de La belyer / the lord of Cambort sir Olyuer / the lord of
Clesquyn / the barroys of Bars / the lord of Colet / sir Raynalde of Thouars
/ the lord of pousanses / sir Wyllyam of Lignacke / (...) Water pas (...) /
the lord of Thouars * sir Loyes of (...) / sir Trystram de la Gayle / the
vycount of (...)aur / and the lord of Mailly. And what of bretons / poicteuyns
/ beruyers / francoys / burgonyens / stemynges / arthoysens / troyens / and
heynouers a great nombre. When they were passed the river / the same night they
were to the nombre of four hundred men of arms / of chosen men of war. There
was not a varlet that passed over. And when sir Loyes of Sanxere saw so many
passed over / as six baners and xxx. penons. He thought it should have been a
great shame for him / without he passed in like wise. And so he and his
knights and squyers entered in to y^ barks / and with him passed the lord of
Haygest / sir Perciuall of Raynuall / and diverse other. And when they were all
together they said. Now it is time that we go toward Comynes and look on our
enemies / and se if we may lodge in the town / than they did on their
bassenettes and made the^ self ready. And so went forth through the maresses /
a long by the ryuersyde in good order / with their baners and penons wauyng
before them ready to fight And the lord of saint Pie was in the formast front /
and chyefe governor and leader of that company / because he knew the country
better than any other that was there. Thus as they were coming in good order
toward y^ town / Peter de Boyse and the flemynges / who were ready raynged on
the causey did cast their eyes a long the river side / and saw these men of
arms aproche / whereof they had marueyle. than Peter de Boyse said. What d^uyls
of hell has brought these men of arms hyder? which way have they passed the
river of Lyse? And some that were by him said. We are sure they be passed by
some barks or botes with out our knowledge for there is no bridge nor passage
between this and Curtrey / that they could pass. what shall we do? shall we go
and fight with them? Nay not so quod Peter / let them come / and let us
abide in our strength / they be beneth and we a high over them / therefore we
have a great advantage on them. And if we should dyscende down to fight with
them / we did not well. Let us abide till it be dark night / and than let
us take counsel what is to be done farther. They be no such nombre that can
long endure against us in battle. We know all the shyfte in the country and
so do not they. His counsel was believed / for the flemynges never removed out
of their place / but held the^ self still at the foot of the bridge / and
raynged all a louge the causey in good order of battle. and made (...)tenu^ce
by semyng / as though they set nothing by them. And they that were passed /
came thorough the maryse by the river side aprochyng to Comynes. The constable
of France / who was on the other side of the river did cast his eyes / and saw
on the other side the men of arms / with their baners and penons in a little
battle coming toward Comynes. Than his blood began to trymble / for fear
y^ he had of them. for he saw well there were a great no^bre of flemynges
raynged in good order of battle agayust them. Than he said in great
displeasur. O saint Jues. O saint George. O lady of heaven / what is this that I
se yonder? I se in part the chief flour of all our army / the which are now
in an hard adventure. Would to good I were deed / sith I se them do so great
an outrage. O sir Loyes of sanxere / I would have thoughtye had been more
atemperate and wyser than I se ye be now. How is it / that ye durst put in
adventure / so many noble knights and squiers as be now in your company? and
so few in nombre / against ten or.xii. thousand fierce and proud people /
who will take none to mercy. And if ye need we can not help you. O Rohen. O
Lauall. O Rieux. O Beaumanoyr. O longuyle. O rochfort. O mauuy. O malestroit O
co^uersant. O such and such I compain of you all. that without my counsel
/ ye will put yourselfe in this adventure. Wherefore am I constable of France?
if ye lose / the faut shall be laid to me. and it shall be said / that I sent you
thider He had given a commandment before / y^ none should depart fro the
host / to i^opart to pass the bridge. But whan^e he saw so many noble men
passed / and saw the dealyng of the^. than he said with an high voice. I
abandon y^ passage to every man that will assay to pass / by any manner of
means. And with those words / knights and squyers auaunced the^ self to
find way and engine / how to pass the bridge. but it was inco^tynent night /
so that of necessyte they must leave their labors / as in castyng of bordes
and plankes on y^ ioystes / and some laid their pauesses to pass over. so that
the flemynges had much a do to defend themself / for they wys^ not well to
who^ to take heed. For they saw beneth the bridge in the maryse / a great
no^bre of men of arms standing close to gyder / and still m^ coming to them.
And also they saw them that were on the other side of the bridge /
scrimysshyng sore with them / and did what they might to make the bridge
again.

THus as ye have herd before / the french men passed by the barks that night
/ and came privily thoroughe the marysses and mire to their anclees. Now
behold and consider the pain that they endured / and the valyantnesse of
them. Seeing / how in so long nights and winter / as in Decembre. They a bode
all the long cold night in their harness / on their fere in y^ mire / their
bassenettes on their heedes without meat or drink. Certainly I say / this
ought to be reputed for a great valya^tnesse. And trewely they were but a
handful of men / to the regard of the flemynges that were within Comynes /
and about in the country. so thus they stood and nouther durst enuade nor
assail / but determined to stand so still till it were fair day / saying
each to other. We shall se when it is day / the flemynges will come out of
their strength and assail us. And when they come / let us cry our cries all
with one voice / every man his own cry orels his lords. though it so be /
that the lords be not here: for by such cries / we shall abasshe them / and
than let us stryke in among them with good courage and will. It is in god /
to give us grace to disconfyte them / for they are but yuell armed. And we have
good spears well heeded / and good swerdes. The habergyns that they bear
shall not defend them. Thus in this good conforte they abode all that night.
And y^ constable who was on the other side of the river toward Lysle / had
great fear in his heart of the^ / and wysshed him self and all his puissau^ce
/ within ye town of Comynes. Than the marshals of Burgoyn and of Flaunders /
said to conforte him. Sir / be nothing abashed. they that be passed over be
chosed men of war / valiant and of great wisdom. They will do nothing but
by good order and discrecyon. Sir / they will not fight this day / the night is
to nere aprochynge. And sir / ye have aba^doned the passage to pass who will.
To morrow as soon as it is day / we shall do our best to pass the bridge. We
have provided this day for wood and tymbre / more than we shall need. I trust
we shall be soon over / and reconforte them if they have any need / and yonder
unhappy people: shall not endure against us. Thus the constable was reco^forted
/ by the saying of such valyant persons as were in his company.

How the french men that were passed the river of Lyse / disconfyted the
flemynges and slew many of the^ / and wan the passage of Comynes. Cap. CCCC.xv.
PEter de Boyse: who knew well that these me^ of arms in the marysse / were
nere joining to Comynes. thought him self in no surety / because he knew
natte what the^de should be. How be it he saw well / y^ he had in his company
a six or seuyn thousand men. Than he said to the^. Sirs / yonder men of arms
that have passed the river / they be not made of stele. They have all this
last day traueyled / and all this night stamped in the mire. I think now at
the brekyng up of this new morning / it were best we set on them. We are men
enough to close them round about. and if we beat them ones / there is none
will medyll with us after. let us make no noise till the time come to do our
feate. On the othersyde / the french knights that were in the marysses / not
far fro their enemies / were not at their ease / They stood so in the mire.
so^e to the ancles / some to the mydde leg. How be it / the great pleasure
and desire that they had to co^quere the passage with honor / made them forget
their pain and traueyle. if it had been in Somer as it was in winter / it had been but a pleasure for them. but as than the earth was cold and wete / and
the nights long. and some time rayned on their heedes / the which ran down
by their bassenettes. For they stood ever ready to fight / and looked ever whan^e
they should be assailed. The remembrance whereof / made them to forgette their
pains. There was the lord of saint Pie / who aquyted him self right nobly.
He was the formast / and ever went privily: to spy / se / and harken / the
dealyng of his enemies. And when he returned he showed his company / how
there was no noise among them. Saying / paraduenture they do it / because they
will be ready to do that is their purpose. Thus he went in and out to spy what
his enemies did / till at last about the breakyng of the day / the flemynges
all in a plumpe without any manner of noise / came softely toward the maryse.
When the lord of saint Pie / who was watchyng for them / saw certainly that
they were coming: than he came to his company and said. Sirs / let us set on
them / for our enemies are coming at hand. They come fair and softely
without noise / wenyng to set on us / or we beware of them. therefore now /
let us all show ourselfe like men of war: for inco^tynent we shall have
battle. And with those words / every man apparelled himself ready / and set
them self in as good order as could be devised.

ANd so when they aproched / they made their cries / as they were appointed
before to do. And received the flemmynges with the spear points / in such
wise / that ye mayle in their cootes / could hold out no more: than two or
three fold of clothe would have done. The constable of France / herd well
the cry and noise / and said. Sirs / surely our company are fighting / god
aid them: for we can not / as at this time. Thus the french men received
the flemynges / with ye good spear heedes of Bordeaux. The which went
through / habergyns / shulders / bellyes / and heedes: in such wise / that
the flemynges gave back / and the french men wanne ground. There was Peter
de Boyse in the formast front / hurt with a spear through the shulder / and
also in the heed. And he had been deed without remedy / if his men had not
saved him. For he had a.xxx. great varlettes / whom he had appointed to wait
ever on his own person. And so they took him in their arms / and bare him out
of the prease. the mire was so great / that every man waded to the mydde leg.
The men of arms / who had been used to great feats of arms / They beat
down the flemynges / and slew them without mercy. Some cried saint Pie Lauall
/ Sanxere / Rieux / Anghien / and other cries. The fle^mynges began to be
abashed and to be discomfyted / and began to recule back: and to fall one
upon a another. And the french men entered in among the thyckest of them / and
spared no more to slay the^ / than they had been dogs. and surely they had
good cause so to do. For if ye flemynges had achyued the prise over them / they
had been served of the same sauce. When the flemynges saw how they were
assailed so valyauntly / and that the men of arms had conquered the causey /
and the bridge. Than they determined to set fire in their own town / for two
causes. The one was / to thentent to cause the frenchmen to recule back. And
secondly to cause their own company also to recule back to the town. And as
they devised so they did they put fire in to diverse howses in the town.
thinking thereby / to have abashed their enemies / which auayled them
nothing. for the frenchmen: as valyauntly as they did before / so they
pursewed them still / betyng and sleyng of them. Than the slemynges forsook the
town and entered in to the feldes / and drew together. and than sent about in
ye country / to stir and reyse up the people. As to Uertaygne / to
Propringne / to Uergues / to Rolers / and to Mesiers / to Warneston / and to
all other towns about / to cause them to come to Comynes. And belles began to
braule / whereby it might well be known / that there was business in hand. so
some drew to the noise / and some went to save themself and their goods / to
Ipre / and to Courtrey. women and children forsook their houses / and left
their bestes / corn / and other mouables behind them. and some went toward
Comy nes to aid their company / where as they were fyghting. In ye mean
season while these frenchmen / that had passed the river of Lise by the little
barks / were in hand with their enemies. The constable with the great band
of the vowarde / did what they might to pass ye bridge / and there was great
prease / because the constable had abandoned the passage to every man who so
would adventure. So every man preased forth / they had no let to pass. So
these lords, passed the same day ye bridge with much parell / for they were
feign to lay pauesses and targes on the ioystes of the bridge to pass over. The
same night they had caused to be brought two lode of nails / the which greatly
did help them to amend y^ bridge. and so within a short time the bridge was
made again: good and strong. And so all the company passed over the same
tuisday in the morning / and so fought at the passage. Therle of Flaunders
understood how they fought at the passage of Comynes / and he sent thither a
six thousand men a foot / to aid their company / but or they came all was
done / and ye bridge new made. Than the constable sent them to the bridge of
Warneston / to make that bridge again / that all their caryage might easly
pass over.

How the french king passed the river of Lyse. And how Philyppe Dartuell
made his ordinance to resyst the king and his puissance. Cap. CCCC.xvi.
Tidings came the tuisdaye to the king / who was at the abbey of Marquetes /
and his uncles with him / how that ye passage of Comynes was conquered / and
his vowarde passed over. whereof they were greatly reioysed. Tha^ was it
ordained / that the king should pass / and so he hard mass and the lords
also. and drank and lept on their horses / and so took the way to Comynes.
They of the voward delivered the town clean fro the flemynges / and there were
slain in the streets and in the feldes / about a four thousand / beside those
that were killed in ye chase. and in mylles and churches / where as they had
hyden them self for fear. for as soon as the bretons were over / they lept on
their horses / and entered in to the chase / to find out the flemynges. and to
over ryn the country / which was as than fat and rich. The lord of Ryeux /
the lord de Lauall / the lord Malestroyt / the vycount of Bellyer / the lord
of Comborte and their company / rode so long. that they came to Uerayne /
agreat town. the which anon was taken and brent / and all they within put to
death. there the bretons had great pillage / and profit. and in likewise so had
other / as they spredde a broad in the country. for they found the houses
full of clothe / feathers / cloth of gold and silver. for the flemynges in
trust of the strength at Comynes / had not a voyded their goods out of the
country. The bretons that entered first in to the country / did set no thing by
the clothe nor other riches / but by ye gold and silver that they found
there. but such as came after took all and left no thing behind them / for
all was fysshe that came to net.

yE may well know / tydinges will anon spredde abroad. the same tuisday word
ca^e to Philyp Dartuell / where as he lay at siege before Andewarpe. how that
the frenchmen had passed the river of Lyse / by barks ye monday. and how they
had conquered the passage at Comynes. and how there were a six thousand of
his men slain / and as it was thought / Peter de Boyse was also slain. Of
these tidings Philypp^ was greatly abashed / and began greatly to marueyle.
And demanded of the lord of Harsels / what was best to do? He answered and
said. Go you to gau^t and assemble together / all the men ye can get in the
town / and than come hyder again. and so with all your puyssaunce / draw
toward Courtrey. And when the king understands that ye come so stronglye /
he will be aduysed or he come much farther in to the country. Also / I trust
we shall here shortly tidings fro our company that be in England. And it
may be so / that the king of England and his uncles will pass the sea with
great puyssaunce / or so^e of the^. The which shall come well to pass for us.
I marueyle greatly quod Philyppe Dartwell / that the english men tarry so
long. Seeing they know / that the french men be entered in to our country. I
wotte not what they mean thereby? And specially I marueyle of our own men /
that we here not fro the^. But how soever it be / I will go to Gaunt / to
fetch ye rerebande and so shall come again and fight with the french king /
whatsoever come thereof. I am informed / how the king has twenty thousand
men of arms / the which mounteth to.lx. thousand men of war. I shall
bring as many against him in battle. And if it please god of his grace / yt I
may disco^fyte him / with the good right that we have / I shall be the most
honored lord of the world. And if I be disco^fyted / as great a fortune has
fallen on a gretter lord than I am. Thus as Philyppe Dartuell and the lord of
Harsels were toguyder deuysinge / There came certain persons to them / such as
had been in the battle before Comynes / who verifyed all: as ye have herd
before. Than^e Philyppe Dartuell said. Is Peter du Boyse deed or a live. They
answered and said. Sir / he is not deed. But he was sore hurt in the battle /
and is gone to Bruges. And so therewith Philyp lepte on his horse / and a.xxx.
men with him / and took the way to Gau^t. And he went a little out of the way /
to se certain men yt were deed / of the garyson of Andwarpe. Who were issued
out the same night / to make a scrye in the host / and so there were a.xii.
slain. And as he stood and beheld them / he saw where an haraude was coming
from Gaunt ward / belongyng to the king of England / and he was called
Irelande. Of the coming of this haraude / Philyppe was right ioyefull / because
he came out of England / and demanded of him tidings. Sir quod the haraude /
there is five of yor men with a knight of England / called sir Wyllyam
Fermeton / are come to Gaunt. And they by the acorde of the king of England
and of his uncles / and generally / by consent of all the realm of England.
They have brought you letters (as I am informed) the which letters comyth to
you as Regent of Flaunders. And when ye know what the letters conteyne / and
the great alyances that ye shall have with them of England and your men ones
returned. ye shall know what ^^oforte ye shall have of the^. Well quod
Philyppe / ye ^^otente me much of this deuysing / but I fear me it will be to
late. Go your way to the host to our lodging / and so he was brought to the
lord of Harsels / and Philyppe rode forth to Gaunt right pensyfe / in such
wise / that no man could have a word of him.

Now let us speak of the french king / and let us show how he parceyuered.
When he hard how that ye passage of Comynes was won / and the bridge new
made. than he departed fro the abbey of Marquettes / and so rode forth toward
Comynes / in good order every man in his degree. So the king came the same
tuysday to Comynes / and he and his uncles lodged in the town / and the
vowarde was dyslodged / and went and lodged on the mount of Ipre. and so all
his people and caryage passed by Comynes and Warnestone. And on the wednisday /
the king came and lodged on the same mount of Ipre. and on the sa^e wednisday
the rerewarde passed by ye bridge of Comynes / wherein was two thousand men of
arms and two thousand crosbowes. and the earl of Ewe and the earl of Bloyse /
the earl of saint Powle / the earl of Harcourt / the lord of Chatelon and the
lord of sere / were governors of the^. And when it was night / and yt the
lords had thought to have rested the^ after their traueyle / there fell suddenly
a larum and a skrye. so that the lords thought surely to have had battle /
and thought that the flemynges of Ipre / of Cassell / and of Bergues had been
gadred together / and come to give them battle. than these lords armed them
again / and set on their basse nets / and set forth their baners and penons
/ and ordered their men / every man under their own ensygnes. Thus they stood
nygh all night / in the mire to the myde leg. These lords endured much
pain / as the earl of Bloyse and other / who had not been acustomed to suffer
such cold in such long nyghtes / as in Noue^bre / but they suffered it for
their honor. for they went surely to have been fought with all incontinent /
but all was nothing / for the skrye arose by certain varlettes among them
self. How be it these lords endured this pain / and bare it as well as they
might.

How the town of Ipre and diverse other / put them self under the obeisance
of the french king / and of the order of the kings host. Cap. CCCC.xvii.
ANd on the thursday in the morning the rerewarde dislodged fro comynes / and
drue to their company / who were on the mount of Ipre. And there the king and
the lords took counsel what was best to do / whether they should go before
Ipre / or before Courtrey / or before Bruges. in the mean season the french
forangers ran over the country / and they found catayle and other things /
that it was maruayle to consydre. for after they were ones over the passage at
Comynes they lacked no thing. When they of Ipre saw the king with all his
puyssaunce so nere them / and the passage at Comynes conquered they were not
well assured of them self / and so they drew together to counsel. The rych
and notable men of the town / would ever that they should have sent to cry
the king mercy / and to send him the keys of the town. but the captain who
was of Gaunt / and set there by Philyp Dartuell / would in no wise that they
should yield. sayng sirs: our town is strong enough and well provided / we
may bide a siege long ynogh if nedebe. and in the mean time Philyppe Dartuell
our regent will gather his puyssance / and come and fight with ye king / and
raise the siege: think not the contrary. The other answered / and said: we be
not in surety of this / for we think it can not lie in Philyppe Dartuells
power / to withstand the king / with out the help of the englysshmen / the
which is nothing lykely. therefore we think it were best to yield us to the
french king / and to none other. So much rose words between the^ / that they
rose against the captain and slew him / who was called Peter Uanelayre. And
when they of Ipre had done this deed / they caused two freres to go to the
king and to his uncles / desyring the king that he would take an amyable
treaty with them of Ipre. The king than by the aduyce of his counsel / gave
save conduct to.xii. of them of Ipre and an abbote / to come and go save / to
know what would be their desire / than ye frers returned to Ipre. And so than
xii. were chosen out in the town and an abbote / to go to the king on ye mount
of Ipre. and when they came before the king they kneled down / and offered him
to become always under his obeisance / without any mean or reseruacion. The
king than by the consent of his counsel / as he yt thought to reduce the
country by fair means if he might / received their offer / on a co^dicyon:
and that was this. that they of Ipre should pay to the king.xl. thousand
frankes toward his charges coming thither / to the which they of Ipre made
no refuse / but were right joyful thereof. Thus they of Ipre were taken to
mercy / and they desired the king and his uncles / to come in to their town to
refressh them / whereof they said all the town would be right glad. the king
agreed thereto / consyde ryng how fro thens he might go in to Flaunders / to
which part he would. So thus they of Ipre returned in to their town / and
the people thereof were right joyful / when they knew how they were received
to mercy. And so anon this.xl. thousand frankes was gadered among them / and
paid to the king or he entered in to Ipre.

ALl this time the king lay still on the mount of Ipre / and than there came
tidings to him / how yt the parysiens rebelled / and had determined / as it
was said among them self / to have beaten down the castle of Beautye /
standing in the wode of Uyncenes. and also the castle of Lowre / and all the
strong howses about Paris / to thentent yt they should not be grieved by any of
them. There was one among them thought to have said well / but he spoke right
yuell: as it apered after / for he said. Sirs: let us not do thus / iyll such
season as we know how the king our lord does / in his journey in
Flanders. if they of Gaunt come to their intent / as we trust they shall /
than it will be good time to do it. let us not begin a thing and afterward
repent us. He that said this / was called Nycholas the flemynge. and so by his
words the parysiens seized to do that outrage / but they held them self
still in Paris / and provided for all things. as harnes and other abylmentes /
as richely / as though they had been great lords. And they were of harnessed
men cape a pe / like men of arms / mo tha^.xxx. thousand / and as many with
malles / and daily they caused harnes to be made / and sold to every man that
would bye. behold and se what a myschiefe should have fallen / if the king and
the noble chiualry that was with him had been discomfyted in Flanders. it may
be well thought that all noblenes should have been deed / and lost in all
France / and as well peradventure in other places. The rebellyon called the
Jaquery / was never so great nor horible as this was likely to have been. In
likewise at Reins / at Chalons in Champayne / and on the river of Marewe / the
villayns rebelled / and thretened the gentlemen / ladies / and children / such
as were abydinge behind the king. Also at Orleance / at Bloys / at Rohan in
Normandy / and at Beau uoysen / the dyuell was entered in to their heeddes to
have slain all noblemen / if god had not purueyed of remedy. as ye shall here
af^ in this history. Now let us return to Flaunders.

When they of Cassell / of Bergues / of Bourbourcke / of Grauelyns / of Furnes
/ of Dunkyrke / of Propringe / of Tourront / of Uaylant / and of Messyne /
under stood how they of Ipre were become french / and had yielded up their
town under the obeisance of the french king / and that gracyously he had
received them to his mercy / they were greatly reioysed / and recomforted. And
thus whan^e they had well ymagyned / all these said towns / took their
capitayns and bound them fast / to thentent that they should not skape. and so
they brought them to the mount of Ipre to please the king / and cried him
mercy on their knees / sayng. Noble king we put our bodies goods / and towns
/ to be under your obeisance. and sir / to show more plainly that ye be our
right lord / we have brought you here our chyefe capitayns that Philyppe
Dartuell had set to rule us / and against our wylles to obey them. sir / do
your pleasure with the^ / as it shall like you best. for sir: they have ruled
us at their pleasure. Than the king was counsayled to take them to mercy / so
that among them they should give to the king.lx. thousand frankes / toward
his charges / and thereby all their catayls / and other things that they had
abroad in the feldes / should be saved / and not brent nor distroyed. Of the
which co^posicion they were right glad / and thanked the king and his
counsel / that they were so skaped. but all the capitayns that had been set
by Philyp Dartuell / in the said towns / were all beheeded on the mount of
Ipre. Of all these apoyntmentes and treaties / the earl of Flaunders was not
made preuy to noue of them / nor he was not call led to counsel. Somewhat it
anoyed him / for all that voyage he and his men lay ever on a wynge / because
they were flemynges. and it was ordained and commanded / in the kings name on
pain of death / yt no man in the host should speak any flemysshe.

How the french king departed fro the mount of Ipre / and how Philyppe
Dartuell and the flemynges apareled them self to fight. Cap. CCCC.xviii.
When the french king with all his host / vowarde and rerewarde / had lain on
the mount of Ipre as long as it had pleased him / and that his men had sold
there much marcha^dise / of such stuff as they had won abroad in the
country, to them of Lysle / of Doway / and of Tourney / they sold for a
frank that was worth four. and there were some bretons yt thought to win
more than^e other / they charged their wagans and horses with stuff. as with
cloth lynen and woollen / gold and silver / plate and vessel / and did send
it in to sauegarde / over the river of Lyse / and some in to France by their
servants. So than the king went to Ipre and lodged in the town as many as
might / and there they refresshed them a five or six days. They of Bruges
were well enfourmed how ye king was at Ipre / and how that all the country to
Grauelynge / was yielded to him. so they wist not what to do / outher to yield
or not / howbeit they did no more at that time. the most pri^cypall cause that
moved the^ not to yield / was because they had agreat nombre of their men of
the town with Philyppe Dartuell / at the siege of Andwarpe / to ye nombre of
seven thousand. and also in the town of Gaunt / they had lying in hostage of
the most notablest merchants of Bruges / to the intent that Peter de Boyse
should be the more surer to rule them. Also Peter de Boyse and Peter de Myrt /
was there a monge them / showing and saying to the^ thus. Fair sirs: and good
men of Bruges / dismay you not / though the king be come to Ipre. ye know
well / how auncyently all the puyssance that was sent by king Philyppe to
Courtrey / by our auncetours / they were all discomfytted and slain. in like
wise so shall they all be slain and disconfyted / for Philyppe Dartuell has a
great puyssance. he will not leave the matter thus / he will fight with the king
/ he may well do it / for the right is ours / and fortune is fauorabell to them
of Gaunt. so now if he may discomfyte the king / there is not one shall skape
nor repasse again the river of Lyse. and so thus in an hour / all our country
is won again. And so thus ye of this town shall be reputed good and true /
mayntayninge your fraunches and to be in the grace of Philyp Dartuell / and of
us of Gaunt.

THese words and such other like / showed daily by Peter de Boyse / and by
Peter de Myrt / refrayned them of Bruges to fall to any treaty with the french
king. In this mean season the burgesses of Gaunt / that had been in England
aryued at Calayes / and with the^ sir Willym^ Fermeton an english knight sent
in to the country of Flaunders / by the king of England / to conclude with the
flemynges a peace to be taken / between the^ and their coun treys. Than the
captain of Calys sir Johan Deluerays / said to them. sirs: ye are welcome /
but as at this present time / ye may pass no farther / for the french king is
at Ipre / and all the country between this and that / is turned to him.
shortly ye shall here other tydinges / for it is said / that Philyp Dartuell
assembleth his power to fight with the king / and than it shall be known who
shall have the better. If the flemynges be discomfyted / than ye have nothing
to do in Flaunders / and if the king lose ye field / than all is yours. Thus
the men of Gaunt and sir Willyam Fermeton tarried still at Calays.

Now let us speak of Philyppe Dartuell how he parceyuered. He had great
desire to fight with the king / and that he well showed / for he came to Gau^t
/ and there he ordained that every man that was able to bear arms / and the
town kept / should follow him. every man obeyed him / for he made them to
believe that by the grace of god / they should disco^fyte the french men / and
should be still lords of Gaunt / and of diverse other countries. And so he had
with him out of the town / a ten thousand men in harnes / for the arerebande.
and so he came before Courtrey / and he had sent to Bruges / to Audyn / to
Ardanbourc / to Sluse / and to the four mestyers / and to the chatelayne of
Gra^tmont / Teremonde / and Aloys. and so he raised among them a.xxx. thousade
/ and so lodged one night before Andewarpe / and the next day he departed and
went before Courtrey / and he had in his company a fifty thousand men in
harnes.

TJoynges came to the king and to the lords of France / that Philyppe
Dartuell and his puyssance aproched fast toward them and it was said ye he had
in his company a threscore thousand men. Than the vowarde departed fro Jore
and the reregarde / and all the host. While the lords were thus in the feldes
they endured much pain / for it was in the heart of winter / in the begynnig of
December / and it rayned nygh every day. the lords were feign to lie every
night in the high ways / for every hour they looked for battle. For it was
daily said in the host / how their enemies comes to morrow / and that was
said by the foragers that went daily forth a foragyng. the king was lodged
in the mids of his field a monge his men. And in that Philyppe Dartwell and
his company tarried so long or he came / the lords of France were sore
dyspleased / for the wether was so sore / that they would feign the matter had
been determined. With the king was the flower of all chiualry of France.
Philyp Dartuell and ye flemynges were to proud / when they were so hardy to
fight with ye king. for if they had leyen still at ye siege before Andwarde /
and a fortefyed them self there / and by the reason of the rain / and foul
wether that fell. The frenchmen would never have gone to have fought with them
there / and if they had / they could not lightly have fought with them / but
to their great pain and parell. But Philyppe glorified so in his fair fortune
and victory / that he had before Bruges / that it seemed to him / that no thing
could go against him / for he hoped well to be lord of all the world. this
was all his ymaginacyon / for he doughted nothing the french king / nor all his
puyssance / for if he had he would not have done as he did. as ye shall here
after.

Of the maruayle that came to the flemynges in the night / and how they
ordained their battle all in one company. Cap. CCCC.xix.
THe Wednisday at night that ye battle was the next day / Philyp Dartuell with
all his puyssance came and lodged in a fair ground / right strong between a
dike and a little grove of wood with a strong hedge so yt lightly no man
could come well at them. And this was between the hill and Rosebeque, where as
ye king lay. The same night Philyppe Dartuell made a supper in his lodgyng to
all his capitayns right plenteous / for they had prouisyon enough following
them. and after supper / he said to them. fair sirs: ye se well we be here in
arms / I hope well to morrow we shall have some besynes / for the king who
has great desire to find us to fight / is lodged at Rosebeque. now I
require you all / keep faith and truth / and be not abashed of any thing
that ye se or here / for this that we do is in the vpholdynge of our right /
and let us freely fight / to mayntayn the iurisdictyons of Flanders. Admonyst
your people to do well their deuoyre / and order them so well and wisely / that
by our good order and array we may have the victory of the journey to morrow.
by ye grace of god we shall find no lord that dare fight against us in the
field / and it shall be more honor for us / than though we had comfort of the
englisshmen / for if they were in our company / they should have the renome /
and not we. Also say to your company that they save no parsone alive / and so
thereby we shall live in rest / for here is with the king all the flower of
France / there is none lest be hynde. Wherefore I command on pain of death
that no man take any prisoner without it be the king himself / for I would he
were saved / for he is but a child (...)e ought to be pardoned / he knows
not yet what he does / but as he is led / we shall bring him to Gau^t to learn
to speak flemysshe. but as for dukes / erls / and other parsones / slay them
all. The commons in France will not be dyspleased there with / for I am in
surety they would that none of them should return again in to France / and no
more I trust they shall. All such as were with Philyppe at this supper /
acorded to his opinyon / and so answered with one voice / and said. Sir: ye say
well / and thus it shall be done / than they took their leave of him and
returned to their lodginges to their companyes to show them as ye have hard
before. Thus passed the night in the host with Philyppe dartuell / but about
midnyght as I was enfourmed / there fell in their host a maruaylous thing / I
never hard of none like it in any manner.

THus whan^e the flemynges were at rest in their lodginges / howbeit they knew
well their enemies were on the hill / not past a leage fro them. As I was
enfourmed / Philyp Dartuell had brought a damsel with him out of Gaunt. and
as Philyppe lay and slept on a couch beside a little fire of coals in a
pauilyon / this said damsel about ye hour of mydnight issued out of the
pauilyon to look out on ye air / and to se what time of the night it was by
likly hode / for she could not sleep. she looked toward Rosebeque / and she
saw in the sky diverse fumes and fire flyeng / it was of the fyres that the
frenchmen made under hedges and busshes. this damsel harkened / and as she
thought she hard great brute / between their host and the french host / she
thought she hard the french cries / cryeng mou^tioy saint Denyce and other
cries and this she thought was on mount Dorre between them and Rosebeque. Of
this thing she was sore afraid / and so entered in to the pauylyon / and
suddenly awaked Philyp / and said. Sir: rise up shortly and arm you / for I
have hard a great noise on the mount Dorre / I be leave it be the frenchmen
that are coming to assail you. with those words he rose and cast on a gown /
and took his axe in his hand and issued out of the pauylion to se what it was.
And as the damsel had showed him / he herd the same him self / and it seemed
to him that there was a great tournement onthe said hill. than inco^tynent he
entered in to his pauilyon / and caused his trumpet to be blown. As soon as
the trumpet had blown / every man arose and armed them. They of the watch
sent inco^tynent to Philypp^ Dartuell / to know for what ^^use he styrred up
the host / seeing there was no cause why. showing him / how they had sent to
their enemies host and there was no styrring. why quod Philyppe / whereof rose
that noise on the mount Dorre? Sir quod they we herd the same noise / and sent
thither to know what it was. and they that went has made report / y^ when they
came there / they herd nor saw nothing. And sir / because we found nothing
we made no noise thereof / for styrring up of your host. If we should have
styrred them without a cause / we ought to have been blamed for our labor. and
when they of the watch had showed Philyppe these words / he apeased him self
and all the host. Howbeit he had marueyle in his mind what it might be. Some
said it was fendes of hell / that played and tourneyed there as the battle
should be the next day / for joy of the great pray that they were likely to
have there.

Ever after this sudden afray / Philyppe Dartuell and the flemynges were in
dout of betrayenge. And so at good leysar they armed the^ and made great fyres
/ and eat meat and drank / whereof they had sufficient. and an hour before
day Philyppe said. Sirs / it were good we drew in to the field and order our
people / to the intent that though the french men come on us at the breakyng
of the day / that we may be ready to receive the^. They all accorded to his
saying / and so issued out of their lodgings and came in to a hethe without
the wood. And before them there was a great large dyke newly made / and
behind them full of busshes of genepar and other small busshes. there they
ordered their battle all in one company / and by the report of their
co^stables / they were to the nombre of.l. thousand chosen men / who did
set but little by their lives. Also there were a threscore archers
englysshmen stolen away fro Calys / thynkyng to have more profit by Philyppe
Dartuell. So thus every thing was ordered / their carriage / women / and
varlettes. and Philyppe Dartuell had his page by him on a good courser / worth
to a great lord five hundred florens. He had him not by him / to the intent to
fly away or to steal fro his company / but it was the gretter thereby to show
his estate and to mount on him if need were to follow the chase of the
frenchmen. He had of the town of Gau^t about a nine thousand men well armed
whom he kept ever about his own person / for he had more trust in them than
in any other. and he and they with their baners were in the formast front / and
they of Aloyes and Grantmo^t next them. And than they of Courtrey / of Bruges /
of Danne / of Scluse / and of Frank / who were armed the most party with
malles and chapeause of stele / and hocquetons and gantlettes of steel and
baleyne / each of the bearing a stake typped with iron. These towns had
difference in arms and lyuereis / to know one company fro another. Some had
cotes of yelowe and blue / some with black bands on reed cootes / some
bordered with white on blewe cotes / some planted with grene and blewe.
So^elosenged with white and black / some quartred white and reed some all
blewe and one quarter reed / some reed cut upon white / and their baners
according to their crafts / with great holmesses ha^gynge at their gyrdels. So
thus they tarried for the day light / which was nere aprochyng. Now I shall
show you the order of the frenchmen.

How the constable and admyrall of France / and the bastard of Langres went
to se the flmynges / and how they fortifyed them self Cap. CCCC.xx.
THe french king and the lords about him / knew right well how the
flemynges aproched nere to them. And saw well there was no remedy but battle /
for there was no mocion made of tretie of peace. The wednisdaye there was a cry
made in the town of Ipre / yt all manner of people as men of war / should
draw to ye field to the king / and to do as they ought to do. Every man
obeyed the kings commandment as reason was. And drue to the field / except
such bar lettes as were commanded to keep their masters horses. Howbeit in
the bowarde they had many horses for ye adue^turers / and to dyscouer the
feldes. Thus this wednisday the french men kept the feldes nere unto
Rosebeque. and at night the king made a supper to his four uncles and t^ the
constable of France / and to the lord of Coucy and to other great lords
strangers / of Brabant / of Heynalte / of Hollande / of zelande / of Almayne /
of Lorayne / and of Sauoy / who were come thither to serve the king / whereof he
thanken them greatly. The same night the earl of Flanders kept the wache /
and with him a six hundred spears and.xii. hundred men of other persons of
war. And after supper when these lords were departed / the constable abode
still to speak with the king and his uncles. It was ordained by the kings
counsel / that the constable of France sir Olyuer of Clysson should leave
his office for the next day / because it was thought yt they should have
battle / and that the lord of Coucy should occupy the office for that ^yme /
and sir Olyuer to be about the kings person. And so when he would have taken
leave of the king / the king said to him right swetely and amiably. Sir
constable / we would that ye render up your office in to our hands / for this
night and to morrow all day. We have ordained another to occupy the rome / and
we will that ye abide about our person. Of these words the constable had
great marueyle / and answered and said. Right dear sir / I know well I can
not have so great honor / as to aid to keep your person. But sir / this
should be right displesaunt to all my company / and to all them of the vowarde
/ if they have not me in their company. Paraduenture they may lose more thereby
than win. Sir / I say it not because I should think my self so valyant /
that for lack of me they should not do well. But sir / saving the correctyon
of your counsel / I say that all these fyftene days past / I have done none
other thing / but pursewed mine office / to the honor of you and of your
people. And sir / I have showed every man what they should do. And sir / if
they fight to morrow / and se not me among them / they will be abashed / where
by I shall receive blame. And some will say / that I have devised many things
/ and fly a way fro the first strokes. Sir / I require your grace break not
that has been first ordained / I ensure you ye shall have profyt thereby. So the
king and such as were about him / wist not what to say. At last the king
right sagely said. Constable / I know well ye have in all causes right well
acquyted your self and shall do. the king my father that deed is / loved and
trusted you above all other / and for the great trust and affyaunce that he had
in you / therefore I would have you about me in this business. Right dear sir
quod the constable / ye are so well acompanyed / and with so valyant and so
noble men and are so ordered by delyberacion of wise counsel / that there is
nothing can be amended. Wherefore sir / ye and your counsel ought to be
content. And I therefore require you in gods behalf / to suffer me alone in
mine office. And I trust to morrow ye shall have so good fortune in your
journey / that your friends shall be glad and your enemies displeased. To the
which words the king gave none answer of a great space / but at last said.
Constable / in the name of god and saint Denyce exercise your office at your
pleasure / I will speak no more thereof. For ye se farther in this matter than I
do / or such as moved first the matter. Be to morrow with me at my mass. sir
quod the constable with right a good will. and so took leave of the king and
returned to his logyng And on the thursdaye in the morning / every man
apparelled themself ready armed save their heedes / for they knew well by all
lykelyhodde / that they should have battle the same day. the french king
herd mass be times in the morning / and all the great lords with great
devotion / prayeng to god to send the^ honor that day. The same morning
there arose a great mist / so that one could not se an acre of bread before
him / whereof the lords were right sore displeased / but they could not amend
it. And after mass the king and the constable / and other great lords went
to / counsel / to determyne what they should do. And there it was ordained /
that sir Olyuer of Clysson constable of France / sir Mathue of Uyenne admyrall
of France / and sir Wylliam of Poicters bastard of Langres. These three should
go and vysette the demeanor of the flemynges / as nere as there might and to
come again and make report to the king and to his uncles / of the truth of
every thing. and in the mean time / the lord de Labreth and sir Hughe of
Chatelone should order the ba^aylles. So thus these three departed fro the king
mounted on good horses / and rode straight where as they thought to find their
enemies. The same morning in ye great mist the flemynges rose and drew
toguyder in the same strong place that they had fortifyed / and so stood
toguyder all in one battle till it was eight of the clock / and could here
nothing of the frenchmen. And than by great pride the capitaynes said each to
other. What do we here / thus standing still on our fete and take cold? Why do
we not go forth with great courage / sithe we have so great will to fight with
our enemies? We tarry here for nothing. the french men will never seek us
here. Let us go at the leest to the mount Dorrel / and take the advantage of
the hill. These words so multiplied / that they all agreed to auaunce forth /
to take ye hill that was between them and the frenchmen. And so than to escape
fro the dyke that was before them / they went about the little wode that was
behind them / and took the plain feldes And as they came about this wode /
the forsaid three knights aduysed them by great ^eysar / and so rode in costyng
their battle / within a bow shot of them. and when they were passed on the
lift side / than they rode again on their right side / so that they well
aduysed their hole batell. The flemynges saw them right well / but they brake
none array for all them. Than (...) Dartuell said softely to his capitayns.
(...) dress us and make us ready to the battle / (...) our enemies are nere
us. I se right well y^ three knights that have passed and ^^passed by us / have
well auiewed our battle. ^h^sie they drew all in to one battle as they
went to the hill. Than Philyppe said a loud. sirs / when we come to the
battle / let us think on our enemies / how they were disconfyted at the
battle of Bruges / by reason that we held our self close toguyder. Let us
beware that we opyn not / every man bear his weapen right before him / and
enterlase your staves over your arms / one within another / whereby they shall
not enter upon us. And let us go a good pase by leysar / and another turn on
the lift hand nor on the right. And shote our gonnes all atones / and shote
with our cross bows. And this we shall abasshe our enemies.

When Philyppe Dartuell had thus ordered his men and set his battle in arraye
/ and showed them what they should do. Than he made out a wynge of part of his
men / such as he best trusted / and by him was his page with his courser / to
who^e he said Go thy way with my horse behind yonder busshe / and when thou
seyst the frenchmen fly than bring me my horse and cry my cry. than men will
give the room / to the intent that I may follow in y^ chase with the formast.
y^ page did as he was commanded. Than he set beside him on a wynge.xl.
archers englysshmen whom he had in wages. Now behold if Philyp ordered him
self well or not. I think and so did many / such as were expert in
bataylles / that he did not well nor wisely in one thing. And that was /
whan^e he depatrted in the morning out of the strong place that he was in.
For it is to be thought / that the french men would never have sought them
there / to have fought with the^ / for they could not have done it without
great damage. But like foles they thought to show them self valiant and
little fearyng their enemies / and so they were served thereafter.

The manner of the battle of Rosebeque / and how the flemynges were (...)yted
by the counsel of the three for^^a^^ knights / who had a^ewed all their
b^hauyng. Cap. iiii. C. xx^.
SO these three foresaid knights returned to the king and to the bataylles /
ye which were ready in good a^ey as the^ ought to be. for there were many noble
and wise men and well expert in arms both in the vowa^de and in the
reregarde / and in the kings battle. and they knew right well what ought to
be done / for there was the ^^our of all the good ch^^alry of the world So thus
every man gave these three knights way to come to the king / the lord Clysson
spoke first en^lynynge his body to the king / doing of his hatte and said.
Sir / be merry: yonder people be all yours / ^ure varlettes shall beat them.
Constable quod the king / god grant it. Let us go forward than in the name
of god and saint Denyce. Than^e such knights as were appointed to attend on
the kings body were set in good order. And there the king made many new
knights / and so did every lord in his own battle / and diverse baners were
new raised up. Than it was ordained / that wha^e they should ^oyne to fight /
that the kings battle with the ^riflambe of France should be in the fore
front / and the Uo ward should pass by a side on a Wynge on the one side of
the king. And the rerewarde to pass by / a little on the other side of the
king. So that all three batayls might atoues / close about the ^^^mynges
battle / who came close toguyder all in one battle. So the arereward were
showed of this apoyntme^t / the earl of Ewe / the earl of Bloyse / the earl of
saint Poule / the earl of ^arcourte / the lord of Chatyllone / and the lord
Sere were chief of that ward. And before the earl of Bloyse there was made
barone the young lord of haurell / sir Thomas Dystre * and sir James ^ameth
bastard were made ^^^ght^s. There were made the same day by the report of the
haraudes / four hundred three score and s^uyn knights. And so than the three
knight^s departed fro the king and went in to the vowarde / where as their
romes were. than (...) the ^riflambe was displayed that si^ ^e^e^ of ^yllers
did bear. And some say as they have found written / that it was never before
seen displayed against christe^men. but tha^ in that voyage there was great
questyon made / whyder it should be displayed ornatte. How be it diverse
reasons considered / finally it was determined to be displayed as than / by
cause the flemynges held the opynion contrary to pope Clement. And therefore
the frenchemen called them Urbanystes / wherefore they said they were
hery^^kes / and out of the true believe. That was the chyefe cause that it was
borne and displayed in Flaunders. This Ori^^ambe is a precious baner / and was
sent first fro heuyn for a great mystery / the which was ever a great comfort
to them that saw it. And the same day it showed some of his virtue / for all
the morning there was a great thick mist / that one could scantese another.
But as soon as it was displayed and lift up on high / the mist brake away /
and the sky was as clear as any time in the year before. The lords of France
were greatly reioysed / when they saw the son shine so clear / that they
might se all about them / this greatly did reconfort them. it was great
beauty than to regard the baners and stremars wave with the wind. And
beheld well the great battle of the flemmynges / who ever still aproched /
fast joined toguyder with their staves upright / that it seemed a little grove of
wode / there were so many of them.

How the flemynges were disco^fyted at the battle of Rosebeque. Cap. iiii.
C.xxii.
IWas as than enfourmed of the lord of Destenort / who showed me / how that
he was there and saw it / and so did diverse other That when the Oriflambe was
displayed and the mist gone away. There came a dove and made diverse flyghtes
over the kings battle. and a little before they fought / she sat down on one
of the kings baners / the which every manne took for a good token. so thus
aproched the flemynges and began to shote go^nes and arowes fethered with
steel. Thus the battle began the which was right sharp and feirse at the
first encou^tryng. for ye flemynges set on proudly thrustyng With their spears
and shulders like wild ^o res / and they held themself so close toguyder
that they could not be opyned. there was with the shot of the gonnes at the
first thrust slain / of the french part / the lord Del^^rwyn baneret /
Morlette of Harwyn / and James Dorre / and so therewith the kings battle was
reculed / but the vowarde and ye arerewarde passed on forth / and enclosed
about the flemynges / and held them strayte / I shall show you how. On
these two wings the men of arms fersly assawted / with their strong spears
well heeded with heedes of fine stele / wherewith they persed the flemynges
cotes of mayle in to ye hard bones / so that the flemynges were glad to esche
we the strokes. So thus these men of arms kept the flemynges so short / that
they could not well help them self / nor put down their arms to give any
strokes. So there were many that lost their strength and brethe / and fell one
upon a ^other / and so dyed for lack of breath with out strikyng of any stroke.
And there was Philyppe Dartuell wounded and beaten down among his men of Gaunt
/ and when his page with his horse / saw the disco^fyture of his master / he
departed and left his master / for he could not help him / and so rode to
Courtray toward Gaunt.

THus these batayls assembled to gyder. So the ^lemynges battle was enclosed
on both sides / so that they could pass no way / than ye kings battle came
forth again the which was before a little drawn a back. The men of arms
beat down the flemynges on every syd^ / some had good axes of stele / where
with they brake a sonder bassenetes / and some had malles of lead. wherewith
they gave such strokes / that they beat all down to the earth be fore them /
and as the flemynges were beaten down / there were pages ready to cut their
throtes / with great knyues / and so slew them with out pytie / as though they
had been but dogs / the strokes on the bassenetes were so great yt no man
could here other speak for noise. I hard reported yt though all the armorers
of Bareys / and Brusels had been workynge toguyder / could not have made so
great a noise. There were some that aduau^ced so sore in to the prease that
they were s^ayn / and overcome for lack of brethe. as sir Loys of Gousalles a
gentle knight of Berrey / and sir Fleton of Renyell and diverse other / which
was great damage. but so great a battle as the flemynges were / could not be
overcome without great loss / for young knights and squiers will lightly
auaunce them self to get honor. and the prease was so great and the business
so parylous / that when they were in the thick of the prease / they could not
releue them self / but were trodden under foot to death. and so by that means
there were diverse of the frenchmen slain / but to no great nombre. The
^lemynges were slain by hepes / one upon a another. And whan^e they that were
behind saw the discomfyture of their company / they were abashed / and cast
down their pauesses / and armures / and turned and fled away toward Courtrey
/ and other places / and had mind of nothing but to save them self. And ye
bretons and frenchmen chased the^ through dykes / groves / and busshes / and
ever fought and slew them down right. there were many fled between
Courtrey and the battle / to go to Gaunt. This battle was on the mount dorre
/ between Courtrey / and Rosebeque. In the year of our lord god / a thousand
three hundred sourscore and two / the thursday next before adue^t in November /
the.xxvii. day. the french king Charles than being of.xiiii. year of age.

How the body of Philyp dartuell was brought to the king and so hanged up.
and how the town of Curtray was brent. Cap. C C C C.xxiii.
THus as ye have herd the flemynges were disconfyted on the mount Dorre /
their pride abated and Philyppe Dartuell slain. and of them of Gaunt / and of
their parteners slain with him in the field / to the nombre of nine thousand
/ acordynge to the report of the herauldes / and in the chase.xxv. thousand
slain. And the battle endured not past half an hour / or it was disconfyted.
And after this disco^fyture / the which was right honorable for all
christendom / and for all nobleness. For if these said villaynes had atchyued
their ententes / there had never so great cruelty have been seen before in all
the world. For the comonties in diverse countries had rebelled / to have
distroyed all nobleness.

What think you that they of Paris would say / when they knew of this
disconfyture? I think they were nothing joyful thereof. thus when this
battle was atchyued / at last they left the chase / and tru^pettes sowned the
retrait. And so every man drew to his lodging / and the vowarde lodged
forward / there as the flemynges had lain the night before. And there took
their ease and were well refresshed / for new purueyaunce came to them fro
Ipre. And so y^ night they made great fyres / with such pauesses and staves as
the flemynges had brought to the field. And when the king was in his lod gynge
/ there was pyght up a pauilyon of crymasyn sendall right noble and rich. And
there the kings uncles (...)ed him / and diverse other lords of France came
thither to se him as reason required. Than the king said to them that were
about him. Sirs / if Philyppe Dartuell be a live or dedde / I would feign se
him. they answered / how they would do their pain that he should se him. And
thanne there was made a cry through the host / that who soever could find
Philyppe Dartuell / should have a hundred frankes for his labor. Than there
were many that went among the deed bodies / who were nyghe dispoyled of all
their clothes. At last there was such search made / that he was found and
known / by a varlette that had served him long time before / and he knew him
very well by diverse tokens. So he was drawn and brought before the kings
pauylyon. And the king beheld him a long space and so did all the other
lords. And he was turned and returned / to se what hurtes or wounds he had /
but they could se no wound whereby he should dye. But it was judged that he fell
in a little dyke / and a great meny of the gauntoyse on him / whereby he was
pressed to death. And so wha^ they had well regarded him / than at last he was
taken fro thens and hanged upon a tree. This was the end of Philyp Dartuell.

Sir Danyell of Helwyn / who was within Andewarpe with other knights and
squyers the which had kept the garyson right honorably / the wednisdaye
before the battle. because he knew well that the king was in Flanders / and
should have battle with the flemynges. Late in the night / he caused four
fagottes to be set a fire and cast a high out of the town / in tokenynge
to the^ that lay at the sege / how their siege should be raised. The thursdaye
/ tidings came to the lord of Harselles / how that their company were
disco^fyted and Philyp Dartuell slain. And as soon as these tidings were
known they dislodged / and took their way to Gaunt / and left behind them the
most part of their prouysion. But they with in And warpe knew nothing
thereof / till the next morning. And when they knew thereof / they issued out
/ and brought in great pyllage that they found hydden there about. The sa^e
thursday at night / tidings came to Bruges of the disconfyture of the battle
/ whereof they were greatly abashed / and said. Lo / we may now se our own
distructyon. If the bretons come hyder and enter in to our town / we shall all
be pylled and slain / for they will have of us no mercy. than the burgesses and
their wives / took all their best iowelles and riches / and put it in to
ships to save it / to send it by water in to Hollande and in to zelande. In
this case they were four days / so that they left no disshe nor cup of
silver in all Bruges / but all was put in to ships for dout of the bretons.
when Peter de Boyse who lay there sore wounded / with the hurtes. that he took
at the passage of Comynes. Understode the disconfyture of his company / and
how that Philyppe Dartuell was deed and slain / and how the people of Bruges
were so abashed. Than he was in no surety of him self. And so determined to
depart and to go to Gaunte / for he thought that they of Gaunt would also be
sore abashed. and so made a lytter to be dressed for him for he could not
ride. ye may know well / when these tidings came to Gaunte / of the loss of
their men and of the death of Philyp Dartuell / they were so sore disconforted
/ that if the frenchmen had come thither / the day of the battle or the next
day after / or ye saturday after / or ever that Peter de Boyse came thither.
they would have suffered them to have entered in to ye town with out any
resystence / to have done what they had list: but the french men took no head
thereto. They thought right well to be lords thereof at their pleasure. seeing
that Philyppe Dartuell was deed / they thought surely: that the people of
Gaunte would have yielded them to the kings mercy. Howbeit they did not so /
for they alone made greatter war than ever they did before. As ye shall
herafter in this history.

ON the friday the king disloged fro Rosbeque / because of the air of the deed
bodies. And he was counsayled to go to Courtray to refresshe him there. The
Hase and diverse other knights and squyers / such as knew the country /
lepte on their horses and galowped straight to Courtray / and entered in to the
town / for there was made no defense against them. The burgesses and their
wives / and all other men / women / and children / entered in to cellars and
into the churches to fly fro ye does / so that it was pytie to se it. Such as
entered first in to Courtray / had great profit by pyllage. And so than after
there entered the french men and bretons / and every man took up their lodging
as they came. And the king entered the first day of Decembre. Than there was a
new persecucyon made in the town on the flemynges / such as were hydden
about. For as they were found out they were slain / for there was no man taken
to mercy. The french men and they of that town hated each other mortal lie /
because of a battle that was ones fought before Courtray / where as sir Robert
Arthors and a great part of the ^^oure of France were slain. It was showed
the king / how y^ there was in Courtray / in the church of our Lady a
chapel / wherein were five hundred gylte spurs parteyninge of old time to
the lords and knights of France / such as had been slain at the said
battle of Courtray. The which was in the year of our lord god / a thousand
three hundred and two. And they of Courtray ones a year made thereof a great
triumph and solempnyte. Wherefore the king said. it should be derely bought /
and so it was after. for at his departing he set the town a fire / to the
intent that it should be known ever after / how that the french king had
been there. And anon after that they king thus come to Courtray / there came
thither a fyftie spears fro the garyson of And warpe / with sir Danyell of
helwyn to se the king / who made the^ right good chere / and so did all the
lords. And when they had been there a day / than they returned to And warpe
to their company.

How they of Bruges yield them self under the obeysa^ce of the french king /
and how they of Gaunt were reconforted by Peter de Boyse. Cap. CCCC.xxiiii.
THe bretons and they of the voward showed well by their demeanoure / that they
had great desire to go to Bruges / to pylle and to rob the town. The earl
of Flanders / who loved right well the town of Bruges / and would not by his
will that the town should be clean distroyed. and also he was informed / how
they of Bruges were disconforted and greatly abashed. He had pytie on them /
and said to his son the Duke of Burgoyne. Sir / if they of Bruges would come
to ask mercy / for goddessake let them not be refused. For if the town be
over run with these bretons / it shall never be recovered again / but lost
for ever. the duke agreed well thereto. Thus while the king lay at Courtrey /
they of Bruges lived in great fear / and wist not what to do / outher to
avoyde the town / or else to abide the adventure. And so at last they
determined to send two freres to the king to Courtrey / to obtain a
saueconduct for twelfe of the best of their town / to come and speak with the
king and his counsel. These two freres came to Curtrey and spoke with the
king and his counsel and with the earl of Flaunders / who molefyed the matter
as much as he might The king granted for these twelfe burgesses this
saueconduct / to go and come to speak with him. So thus these freres returned
to Bruges. And so twelfe of their burgesses departed and went to Courtrey / to
the king and to his uncles. They kneled down on their knees before him and
said. Sir / we require yor grace to take and accept us as your own / and to
do with all the men of the town at your pleasure. But sir / for goddessake
have pytie of us. Let not the town be distroyed nor lost. For sir / if it be
distroyed / many good men are utterly un done for ever. And sir / in that we
have been contrary to our natural lord / it was by the puissaunce of
Philyppe Dartuell and of the gau^toyse. For and that had not been / the town
of Bruges had benefull true to their lord. The king intended well to their
words / by the means of the earl of Flaunders / who was there present. Who
kneledde down before the king / and desyredde to have mercy for them. Than
it was showed them / that to apease the bretons and the men of war lyenge
in the feldes / between Courounte and Bruges / that it must behoue them to
pay some certain some of money. and so there was comunyng on that matter / and
it was demanded of them to pay two hundred thousand frankes. So at last it
was determined yt they should pay six score thousand frankes / three score
thousa^de in hand / and the resydue at Candelmas next after. and so thereby to
live in rest and peace / and clerly to become liegmen to the french king / and
to owe to him faith homage and obeysaunce. Thus the good town of Bruges abode
in peace / and not robed nor pylled / wherewith y^ bretons were right sore
displeased / for they had thought to have had great profit thereby. so that
some of them said / when they saw that the peace was made / and lykely to have
no more war. This war of Flaunders is no thing profitable for us / for we
have little advantage thereby. let us return in to our country / but let us go
through Haynalt / for duke Aubert who has the gouernynge there / came not to
aid nor to help his cosyn therle of Flanders / but has dissymuled with him.
wherefore it is good that we go and vyset him / for he has a good country and
a fat / we shall ^ynd none that will let us the way / and so let us recover our
domages / and our wages yuell paid. So there were all of one accord to the
nombre of.xii. hundred spears / what of bretons / burgonyons / sauosyns / and
of other countries. O what ieopardy the good country of Heynalt was in. but the
knowledge thereof came to the gentle earl of B^oyes / who was there as one of
the great lords among other / and one of the chief governors of the arere
guard / and one of the kings counsel. And anon when he knew that ye
bretons and burgonyons desired nothing but pyllage / and how they ma^asshed
the good country of Heynalte. Than to find remedy therefore / he advanced
forth and said. How it was not a thing to be consented unto / that the good
country of Heynalt should be over run. And so called to him his cosyns / the
earl of March / the earl of saint Poule / the lord of Coucy / the lord
Dangeen and diverse other / having lands ^n the cou^tie of Heynault. And
heshewed them / how in no wise they ought to consent / that the good country
of Heynalt should be over run / fro whens they be dyscended / and have therein
fair heritage. Also he said. sirs / ye know well that the country of Heynalt
has done no manner of trespass. For in all the war between the earl of
Flaunders and his country / always Heynalt bare no fault. But has served the
king in this voyage well and truly / with the barons and knights thereof. And
also or the king came in to Flanders / the knights and squyers of Heynalt
served truly the earl of Flaunders. so that some of them were closed and
beseged in Tere monde and Andwarpe / and there adventured both body and
goods. So much the earl of Bloys did and went fro one to another and gat
such friends / that all the matter was broken / and so abode still in peace.
Also the same earl did another thing. There was as than in Flanders a knight /
called the lord of Esquymyn / who for the love of a kynsman of his / called
sir Danyell Buse / who through his own fault was slain in the town of
Ualencennes. And so to revenge his quarrel / the said lord: said he would
make war / and harry the town of Ualencennes. And he had gotten such friends
toguyder to do yuell / as drew to the nombre of ^yue hundred spears / ready to
go in to Heynalt to harry the town of Uale^cennes. Affirmyng / how he had a
good quarrel so to do. but when the earl of Bloyes was informed thereof / he
defended the said knights that he should not be so hardy to enter in to
Heynalt / nor in to the country of his cosyn duke Aubert: for if he did / it
should be derely bought. So much did the gentle earl of Bloys / that he
stopped the said knights enterprise / and the matter put clearly in to his
hands and to the lord of Coucy. and so thus the town was in peace. Such
service did the earl of Bloys in this army to them of Heynalt and to them of
Ualencennes / whereby he gatte greatloue / and specially of the town of
Ualencennes.

ALl this season the lords and men of war lay still at Courtray / and there
about. For they knew not what the king would do / whyder he would go to
Gaunte ornat. For the frenchmen believed / that when they of Bruges were yielded
up / that they of Gaunte would do so in likewise. Seeing they had lost their
captain / and had received great damage and loss of their men / at the
battle of Rosebeque. And of trouth^ / ones they of Gaunt were in mind so to
have done. For they were three days they wist not what to do / outher to
depart and leave the town / or else to send the kayes thereof to the king /
and to yield* them to his mercy. They were so abashed that they wist not what
to do Nor the lord of Harsels who was there / wist not how to reconforte
them. When Peter de Boyse entered in to the town / he found the gates wide
opyn without any keeping or defense / whereof he had great marueyle. And
demanded what it meant / that they kept no better their town. And such as
were come to se him / answered and said. A sir / what should we do? ye know
well we have lost our good captain and men of our town beside strangers /
to the nombre of nine thousand. This damage touches us so nyghe that we have
no recovery. A folysshe people quod Peter de Boyse / ye are abashed and wot
not well why / for the war as yet is not at the end. For the town of Gaunt
was never so renomed as it shall be yet herafter. if Philyp dartuell be deed / it
was by his own outrage. Close up your gates and entende to your defenses / ye
need not fear that the king will come hyder in this winter time. And in the
mean time or the new season come / we shall be new releued with our men /
out of Holande zelande / Guerles / Brabant and other places. We shall have men
ynowe for our money. Fra^coys Atreman / who is in England shall return / and
he and I shall be your capitayns. the war was never so sore as we shall make
it. We are better now alone / tha^ when we had all the help of Flanders /
and we are now better expert than we were before. Therefore let us entende
now to provide for the war / and we shall do more tha^ ever we did before.
thus with such words Peter de boyse reconforted the^ that were sore abashed
at his returnyng to Gaunt. For and he had not been / they had yielded themself
symply to the french king. Lo / thus ye may se what counsel and confort
there is in one man / in time of need. And when they of Gaunt saw that five or
six days were passed / and that no man ca^e toward their town nor no
lykelyhod of any siege. Than they were greatly reconforted / and more prouder
than ever they were before.

How the treaty of alyaunce / between the english men and the flemynges was
broken. And how the french king deperted out of Flanders. Cap. CCCC.xxv.
YE have herd before: how sir Willyam Fermeton was at Calys / sent thither by
the king of England and by his counsel / and brought letters with him to
have been sealed by the good towns of Flaunders. Making men^yon of great
alyaunces / to be taken between thenglysshmen and the flemynges. And at Calais
with him was still Fraunces Atreman and six burgesses of Gaunt. and when
tidings came to them of the disco^fyture at Rosebeque / they were sore
abashed. and the englisshe knight saw well that he had no more to do / to
enter any farther in to Flaunders. For he saw well that the treaty was
broken. So he took the letters unsealed / and return in to England again
as soon as he might / and so showed the matter how it was fallen. Whereof the
gentylmen of the country were not greatly displeased. For they said and also
say yet: that if the commons of Flaunders had won the vyctorie / and that the
noble men of France had been slain. The pride of the commons in every country
would have been so great / that all noble men should have repented it / The
which was well seen but a little before in England. wherefore of the loss of
the flemynges there was but little thought taken. And when they of Flaunders /
such as had been in England with Frau^ces Atreman knew these tidings / it
was right grievous to the^. And so departed by water and arrived at Mydelborowe
in zelande / and such as were of Gaunt returned to Gau^t / and every man home
to their own towns. And Frau^ces Atreman and his company being at Calis
departed and went to Gaunt / but that was not as long as the french king was
in Flanders. but as I was enfour^^ed they returned by zelande.

In the same season that the french king lay at Courtrey / he had diverse
cou^sayls to know how he should parceyuer in his war / and whether he
should go and ley siege to Gaunt or not. The king was well wyllyng to have gone
thy^er. In likewise so were the bretons and burgonyo^s. But the lords
co^sydred: how it was in the month of Decembre and in ye deed time of winter
/ and daily it rayned. Wherefore they thought it was no good hostyng till somer
season. And also they saw well how their horses were but feeble / by reason of
ye cold season / and the ryuers great and large about Gau^t. Wherefore they
thought but a lost time to ley any sege there. And also the lords were weary
and sore traueyled / with so long lyeng in the feldes / in that cold time and
tayny. So all things consydred / it was determined that the king should go to
Tourney / and there to refresshe him and to keep his Christmas. And they of
far countries / as of Auuergne / of Dolphyn / of Sauoy and of Burgoyne /
should return home into their own countries fair and easily. And the bretons
normayns / and frenchmen / should abide still with the constable to attend on
the king. for it was thought / that they should have some business with the
parisye^s / who had newly forged a great no^bre of malles. wherefore they
thought to set another rule and order among the^. And when the king should
depart fro Courtrey / he and his counsel forgate not the gylt spurs that
they found in a church there in Courtray / the which of old time parteyned
to the noble men of France / sometime slain with earl Robert of Arthoyse / at
the battle of Curtrey. So than the king ordained that at his departing the
town should be set a fire / and distroyed. When the knowledge thereof came to
the earl of Flaunders / he thought to have found some remedy therefore. And so
came before ye king and kneled down / and required him to do none yuell to the
town of Curtrey. The king answered / how that surely he would not here his
request. And so therle durst speak no more of that matter / but so departed and
went to his logyng Before they fire began / the duke of Burgoyne caused an
horaloge to be taken down / ye most fairest and goodlyest that could be
found on that side of the sea. The which horaloge was taken down by pieces
and laid in chares / and the bell also. And after / it was carried to Diyon in
Burgoyne / and there it was set up. and there sowneth the.xxiiii. hours of
ye day and night.

AT the departing of the king fro Courtrey / the town was clean distroyed and
brent. And the knights / squyers / and men of war / took some of the men /
women / and children to ransom. And so the king rode and came to Turney / and
was lodged in the abbey of saint Martyne. and they of the town did great
reverence to the king / as reason required. And all they of ye town were
arrayed in white / with three bars of grene on the one side. The city was
divided to lodge the lords. The king lay at saint Martyns / and his company
had one quarter of the town. The duke of Berry was lodged in the bysshoppes
lodginge / the duke of Burgoyne at the crown / the duke of Burbone at the
golden heed / the constable at saint James heed. There was a cry made in the
kings name on pain of death / no man to do any hurt to the people of the
city. and that no man take any thing without he pay truly therefore / and
that none enter in to the county of Heynaulte / to do any hurt or damage
there. All these things were well kept and holden / there the lords
refresshed the^ well. And they of ye far countries departed and returned
homewarde / some by Lysle / some by Doway / and some by Ualence^nes. The earl
of Bloyse took leave of the king and of his uncles / and of his companyon
therle of Ewe / and so returned to his heritage in Heynalte. And he lay a day
and a night at. Ualence^nes / where he was well refresshed. For he had achyued
entierly the love of the good people of the town / for the service yt he did
to the country / when the bretons / burgonyons / and sauoy syns / would have
ouerron the country / which was let by his means. And also for sir Tyrrie of
Disquemyne / who held them of Ualencennes in great feate. Which matter was
put in to the earls hands and in to the lord of Couces / and so thereby they
were in peace. Than the earl departed fro Ualencennes and went to Le^decheries
/ and there he tarried a season with the lady Mary his wife and Jews his sofie.
And the somer after he went to Bloyse / but the countess his wife and his
son tarried still in Heynalt and for the most part lay at Beaumont.

How the french king ca^e to Paris / and how he caused to be put down the
cheyns and harnes in the town: and how the parisye^s were raunsomed at his
pleasure. Cap. CCCC.xxvi.
IN likewise the earl of March and sir James of Burbone his brother / deperted
fro Tourney and went to refresshe them at Scluse in Heynault / on their own
herytages. Sir Guy de lauall breton went to Cheure in Heynault / where he had
part of enherytau^ce: for he and sir Robert of Namure were lords thereof. And
y^ lord of Coucy went to Mortayn on the river of Lescalt / and there
refresshed him and his company / but for the most part he him self was with
the king at Turney. The earl of saint Poule had co^missyon to chastyce the
Urbanystes / whereof there were many in that town. And so he found many / and
ever as he found the^ in the church of our lady or else where: they were taken
and put in prison and sore rau^somed. And by that means / the earl of saint
Poule gathered toguyder in a short season / more than seuyn thousand frankes.
For there was none that escaped him / but that paid or found good surety to
pay. And while that the king lay at Tourney / they of Gaunt had a saueconduct
to go and come / and to entreat for a peace. But in all their treaties they
were as hard and as proud / as though they had won the vyctorie of the
battle of Rosebeque. They said they would gladly put the^ self under the
obeysaunce of the french king / to hold of him / and to have their resort to
the court of Paris. But they said / they would never have nor take to their
lord the earl Loyes. For they said / they could never love him / because of
the great domages that they had received by him and by his means. All that
ever ye king and his counsel could do / could never turn them fro that
opinyon: They would never make other answer / butsayde. Though they had lived
this two or three year / in pain / trouble / and danger. yet they trusted at
last / to recover it / and to bring up their town again / in to great
prosperyte and welthe. than it was showed them / they might depart when they
list. And so they deperted fro Tourney and returned to Gaunt: and so the matter
hanged still in war. The french king and his lords took great pain / to
cause the county of Flaunders to be good Clementyns / and to obey to pope
Clement. But the good towns and churches were so sore anexed and bound to the
opinyon of pope Urbane / that they could not be turned. Therle of Flaunders him
self was of ye same opinyon / and so they answered by the counsel of therle
to take aduyce / and to answer detmynatly by the feast of Ester: and so thus
the matter hanged. The king kept his Christmas at Turney / and when the king
deperted / he ordained the lord of Guystell to be capitayn of Bruges / the
lord of saint Pie at Ipre / and the great lord of Guystell to be regard of
Flaunders / and sir John^ of Jumont to be captain at Courtrey. And he sent
two. C. speres bretons and other in garyson to Andeburge. and to Andwarpe he
sent sir Wyllm^ of Langhien and about a. C. spears with him in garyson. Thus
the garysons of Flanders were purueyed for to keep garyson war all winter /
and none otherwise till the next somer. These things thus ordered / the king
departed fro Tourney and went to Arras and his uncles with him / and the Earl
of Flaunders in his company.

The king tarried at Arras / and the city was in a great adventure to have been
over ron and robbed with the bretons / For there was great wages owyng to them.
Also they had endured great traueyle in that voyage / and they were not well
content with the king it was great pain to refrain them fro doing yuell. The
constable and marshals of France apesed them / promysyng / how they should be
clearly paid of their wages when they came to Paris. so thus the king
deperted and went to Peron. The earl of Flaunders took leave of the king and
went to Lyle. so long the king iurneyed that he passed Peron / Noyon / and
Co^payne: and so came to saint Lyse and there rested. And all his men of war
were lodged in ye vyllages between saint Lyse and Meaulx in Bry / and on the
river of Marne / and about saint Denyce: so that all ye country was full of men
of war. And so than the king departed fro saint Lyse and went toward Paris /
and he sent before his officers to prepare for him his lodging / at the
castle of Loure. And also his three uncles sent of their servants to prepare
their lodgings: and in likewise so did other lords. And all this was done for
a cautell and wyle / for the king nor these lords were not determined to enter
so suddenly in to Paris / for they douted them of Paris. But they did this to
prove what countenance and order they of Paris would make at the kings enter /
they thought they would make this assay be fore. The servants that went before
were commanded to say / if any man demanded of the^ if the king were coming /
that they would be there inco^tynent. By the which the parisyens aduysed among
them self to be armed / and to show the king at his enter what puyssance they
were of: and what men of war they were able to make to serve the king when it
pleased him. but they had been better to have sytten still in their houses / for
the show that they made was converted to their great seruytude / as ye shall
here after. There said they did it for good / but it was taken to yuell. And
where as the king should have lodged at Lour / he made his lodging to be
prepared at Bourgell. And than voice ran thorough Paris / how the king was nere
at hand to enter in to Paris. Than mo than.xx. thousand parisyens armed them
and issued out in to the feldes / and ordered themself in a fair battle /
between saint Lader and Paris / toward Mount martyr. And they had with them
crosbowes / pauesses / and malles ready apparelled / as though they should have
fought inco^tynent in battle. The king was as than at Borgell and all the
lords / and thider to them was brought all the tidings of all the demeanoure
of them of Paris. Than the lords said. A / ye may se the pride of these
rybauldes. Wherefore do they now show their estate? if they would have served
the king / in the same point as they be in now: when the king went into
Flaunders. Than^e had they done well / but they had no mind so to do. They
rather prayed to god yt we should never return again / the which words
diverse that were there helped / well forward / to thentent to grieve the
parisyens. saying if the king be (...) counsayled / he shall not adventure him
self ^o come among such people / as comes against him with an army arrayed
in battle. They should rather have come humbly with processyon / and have rong
all the belles in Paris. In thanking god of the vyctorie / that the king had
in Flaunders. Thus the lords were abashed / how they should me^tayne them
self / Finally it was appointed / that the constable of France / the lord
Dalbret / the lord of Coucy / sir Guy of Tremoyle / and sir Johan of Uyen /
should go and speak with the^. And demand of them the cause / why they be
issued out of Paris in so great a no^bre / armed in order of battle against
the king / the which thing was never seen before in France. And upon their
answer / the lords said the king should take advise. They were wise
enough to order as great a matter as that was / and gretter. So these said
lords departed fro the king without harness / and for the more surety of
their business / they took with the^ three or four herauldes / and send them
somewhat before to the parisyens / and said. Sirs / go ye on before to yonder
people of Paris / and demand of them a save conduct for us to go and come /
till we have spoken with them fro the king.

THese heraudes departed and rode a great pace / and ca^e to these people. And
when the parisiens saw them coming / they thought full little they had come
to have spoken with them: they thought they had but rydden to Paris as other
did. The heraudes had on their cote armures / and when they aproched nere to
the parisyens / they said on high. Where be the masters? Where be the rulers?
Which of you be capitayns? We become to you / send fro the lords. Than some
of them of Paris parceyued well by these words / that they had not done well.
They cast down their heedes and said. Here be no masters / we are all of one
accord / and at the kings commandment and ye lords. Therefore sirs / say
in gods name what ye will to us. Sirs quod the heraudes / the lords that
sent us hyder / and named them they know not what ye think or entende. They
require you that they may peasably without parell come and speak with you / and
return again to the king / and show him the answer that ye make to them /
otherwise they dare not come to you. By our faythes sirs quod they / they
ought to say no such words to us / but of their ge^tylnesse we think ye do
but mock us. Surely sirs quod the heraudes / we speak it in good certentie.
Than quod the parisyens / go your way and say to them / that they may come at
their pleasure to us / without danger or parell / for they shall have no hurt
for none of us / for we are all ready to fulfill their commandments. Than the
herauldes returned to the lords / and showed them as ye have herd. tha^ the
four lords rode for the and their company / and came to the parisyens whom
they found in good array and order of battle / and there were mo than.xx.
thousand malles. and as the lords passed by them / and beheld them well
within them self / they praised much their manner. and also as they passed by
/ ever the parisye^s enclyned them self to the^. And when these lords were as
in the mids among them / than they rested and stood still. And the Constable
spoke a high and said. ye people of Paris / what has moved you to issue out
of the city in this order of battle? It seems ye will fight against the
king our sovereign lord / whose subgettes ye be or should be. Sir quod they /
save your grace. We were never of will to do any thing against the king. But
sir / we be issued out for non other cause / but to show the king what
puyssance the parisyens be of. The king is but young he never as yet saw it /
and without he se it he can not know it / nor how he may be served if need be.
Sirs quod the constable / ye speak well. But we say unto you fro the king /
that as at this time he will not se you in this manner / for this that ye have
done suffyseth. Therefore we counsel you to return again peaseably to Paris
/ every man to his own lodging and do of your harness / if ye entende that
the king shall come hyder. Sir quod they / we shall with right a good will
fulfill your commandment. And so therewith they all returned in to Paris /
every man to his own house to unarm him. And the said four lords returned
to the king / and showed unto him / all the words that ye have herd before.
Than it was determined / that the king / his uncles and lords / and certain
men of arms with them / should enter in to Paris. And the great band to ^yde
without the cite round about / to give the more fear to the parisyens. And
the lord of Coucy and the marshall of sa^xere were ordained / that as soon as
the king were entered in to Paris / that they should take down the leaves of
the gates of the four princypals of the city / toward saint Denyce and saint
More. So that the gates might stand open day and night / for all manner of men
of warr^ to enter in and out at their pleasur / to thentent to master them of
Paris if need were. And also / they to take down all the chenesse in every
street / to ride in and out at their pleasure. And as it was ordained so it was
done. And so the king entered in to Paris and lodged at Loure and his uncles by
him / and the other lords in diverse logynges. So thus the gates were taken out
of the gouges and laid down on ye ground / and the chenesse of every street
taken down and brought in to the palayes. Than the parisyens were in great
dout / and feared that they should be over ron / so that none of them durst
look out in to the street / nor open door nor wyndowe. and thus they were a
three days in great parell and fear to receive greatter damage / as they did.
for it cost many of them great fynance and rau^ some. For they were called in
to the chamber of counsel one after another / such as the lords would have.
And so there they were rau^somed / some at six thousand frankes / some at
three / and some at one. So that there was leuyed in Paris to the kings profit
/ to his uncles / and to his mynisters / the so^me of four hundred. M.
frankes. There was nothing demanded of the poor people but of the great
masters / and such as might bear it. They were right happy that might escape
with payeng of rau^some. And every man by him self / was feign to bring their
harness in sackes to y^ castle of Beauty / other wise called the castle of
Uyce^nes: and there it was closed in a great tower / and their mals also. thus
the parisye^s were delt^all / to give ensample to all other good towns of
France. and there were raised up: subsydes / gabels / aids / fouages douzimes /
trezimes / and all other such things. and also / all the plain country about
cleneryfled.

How diverse notable men of Paris were beheeded with master Johan Marettes at
Paris / and in diverse other towns of France: and of the warr^ of the
gau^toise that was new begone again. Cap. CCCC.xxvii.
THere were also diverse taken and put in prison and many drowned. and than to
apease the remynant / there was a cry made in the cite / that none on pain of
death should do any hurt to any parisyen / nor to(...) nor take any thing out
of any house / without payeng therefore. This cry apeased greatly them of the
cite. How be it on a day / there were diverse persons led out of the castle
judged to dye for their defaules / and for styrring up of the commons. Howbeit
there was great marueyle made of master Johan Marettes / who was reputed and
renoumed a sage and a notable man. Some said he had wrong to be judged to dye /
for he had always been a man of great wisdom and good counsel. And was one
of the most aute^tyke men of the court of parlyame^t: and had served king
Philyppe / king Johan / and king Charles: and was never found in no defaute.
How be it he was than judged to be beheeded and a.xii. in his company. And as
he was carried on a charet to the place of execusion. He spoke and said Where be
they that has judged me to dye? Let them come forth and show the cause why.
Thus he preached to the people as he went to his execusyon. The people had
great pity on him / but they durst speak no word. He was brought to the
markette place of the halles / and there first were beheeded / such as were
brought thither with him. There was one called Nicholas flamant a draper / and
there was offered to save his life / threscore thousand frankes / but it would
not be taken / but there he dyed. And when they came to master Johan Marettes
/ they said to him. Master Johan / cry mercy to ye king to forgive you your
misdeeds. Than he turned him and said. I have served king Phylyppe his great
grant father / king Johan / and king Charles his father / well and truly.
These three never laid any thing to my charge / nor no more the king y^ now
is would have done / and he had been at his full age / and of man's knowledge.
I believe in the iudgyng of me / he is nothing culpable. I have nothing to do to
cry him mercy / but I cry god mercy and none other: I require him humbly to
forgive me my misdedes. And so than he took leave of the people / so that many
wept for him. After this manner dyed master Johan Marettes.

iN likewise in the town of Rohan to master the town / there were diverse
put to death and raunsomed. Also at Reins / at Chaalons / at Troyes / at
Sense / and at Orlyaunce. These towns were taxed at great sommes of florens /
because at the beginning they disobeyed the king. There was gadered in the
realm of France such a so^me of florens / that it was marueyle to speak
thereof. And all went to the profit of ye duke of Berrey and of the duke of
Burgoyne / for the young king was in their governance. And to say the truth
/ the Constable of France and the marshalles / had a great part to pay the
men of arms / that had served the king in his vyage in to Flaunders. And the
earl of Bloys / the earl of March / the earl of Ewe / therle of saint Poule /
the earl of Harcourt / the earl Dolphyn of Auuergne. The lord of Coucy and the
great barons of France / were assigned to be paid on such tares as should be
paid in their countries / for such service as they had done to the king in
Flaunders: and they to pay their company. Of these assignacyons / I can not
tell how the lords were paid / for incontinent after: new taylles were
ceased in their countries for the king. And so before all other / the kings
tax should be paid and executed / and the lords duties put abacke.

yE have herd before: how whan^e the king deperted fro Courtrey / the town
of Gaunte abode still in war / as it was before. And capitayns of Gaunte at
that time / were Peter de Boyse / Peter de Myrt / and Fraunces Atreman. And so
they renewed the town with new soudyers / that came to them fro
dyuerscountreis / and they were nothing abashed to make war / but as
fresshe and as quycke as ever they were. And the capitaynes of Gaunt /
understood that there were certain bretons and burgonyo^s in the town of
Dardenbourge: They determined to go thither to look on them. And so Fraunces.
Atreman deperted fro Gaunt with three thousand men / and so came to
Darde^bourge / and there made a great scrimysshe. And finally the gauntoyse wan
the town / but ye cost many of their lives / for there were a two hundred of
his men slain / and the town was robbed and pylled / and the most part
thereof brent. And so than they returned to Gaunt with their boty and conquest
/ and were received with great joy. And anon after they went to the city of
Dabes and to Teremonde just to And warpe / and pylled and robbed all the
country.

Of the alyaunce that was purchased between thenglysshmen and the flemynges:
and of the bulls that pope Urbayne sent in to England to dystroy the
cleme^tyns. Ca. iiii C.xxviii.
THe earl of Flaunders who lay at Lile: understood how the gauntoyse auaunsed
them self to ride and to over ron the country / and to distroy that they
might. He was right sore displeased. He thought they had not had the wit nor
puyssaunce so to do / sithe that Philyppe dartuell was deed: Howbeit his
counsel said to him Sir / ye know well and ye have always herd say / how
the gauntoyse are right subtle people / the which they have well showed and
will show. And also again / they have been in England and are returned
again. And specially Fraunces Atreman / who was companion to Philyppe Dartuell
in all his faytes / as long as he lives ye shall have war with the^. Also
sir / we know well he has made great alyau^ce with the king of England for
the town of Gaunt. And has a certain pensyon out of England secretly by
Johan Saplemon / who is pure english / and dwells under you in the town of
Bruges / and has done the space of this.xxiiii. year. And to verify that this
is true Raze of Ueyrte / Loyes de Uos / and Johan Ser colacke of Gaunt / and
the clerk that procures to be bishop of Gauut. All these are still behind
in England / to perform this alyau^ce. And sir / ye shall here more trewer
tidings than we can tell you / or the mids of May be past. The Earl of
Flaunders believed well all these sayenges to be true / and so they were in
deed. Than he began to ymagin against this John^ Saplemon / and on
thenglysshmen dwelling in Bruges. Than he caused them to be somoned / to be at
a certain day assigned before the earl at Lysle. And so the earls servants
came and somoned Johan Saplemon and diverse other rich englysshme^ / or they
were ware there of: commaundynge them the fyftene day after / to be with the
earl at his castle of Lysle. When the englysshmen herd thereof they were sore
abashed and took counsel toguyder / having great marueyle / why the Earl
should send for them. All things consydred / they douted gretlye / for they
knew well the earl was fierce and fell / in his have. Than they said among
themself. He that keeps natte his body keeps nothing. We dout lest the earl
be enfourmed sore against us. For with Fraunces Atreman who has a pensyon of
the king of England / when he was in England / there was with him two
burgesses of this town of Bruges. And parauenture they have made some
enformacyon against us to therle / for as now they be on his part. So on this
purpose rested the englysshemen / that they durst not abide the earls judgment
/ nor to go to Lyle at the day before lymyted. So they departed fro Bruges and
went to Scluse / and did so much that they found a ship ready aparelled.
And so they bought it with their money / and so departed and sailed / till they
arrived at London. And when therle of Flaunders was enfourmed of this matter and
saw that the englysshmen apered not at their day he was sore displeased / and
send incontyne^t to Bruges / and caused to be ceased all that ever could be
found / parteyninge to the Englysshmen / and all their herytages given and
sold. And Johan Saplemon clean banysshed out of Flaunders / for a hundred year
and one day and his co^panyons / and such as were taken were put in prisone:
where as some dyed. And some recovered again all that ever they had lost.

THere is a comune proverb / the which is true: and that is / how envy never
byeth. I say it / because englysshmen are right en uyouse of ye welthe of other
/ and always has been. It was so / that the king of England and his uncles
and the nobles of England / were right sore displeased of the welthe and
honor that was fallen to the french king / and to the nobles of France at
the bataile of Rosebeque. And the knights of Englandespake and said to each
other. Ah saint Mary / how the frenchmen are now mounted in pride / by the
ouerthro wyng of a sort of rude villayns. Would to god Philyp Dartuell had had
of our men a.ii. M. spears and six. M. archers? There had not than escaped one
frenchmen / but outher slain or taken / but and god will this glory shall not
long endure the^. Now we have a fair aduau^tage to enter in to Flanders /
for the country is now conquered for the french king: and we trust to conquer
it again for the king of England. It shows well at this time / that the
earl of Flanders is greatly subget to the french king / and that he will
please him in all points. when our marchantes dwelling in Bruges and have
dwelt there beyond this.xxx. year be now banysshed and chased out of
Flanders. the time has be seen they durst not have done it: but now they
dare do none otherwise for fear of the frenchemen. We trust it shall not abide
long in this point. This was the langage among thenglysshmen through the
realm of England / therefore it was to be supposed / ye this was done but by
envy.

iN this season / he that wrote him self pope Urbane the sixth / came by the sea fro Rome to Ge^nes / where as he was well received and reverently of the
genoways and there he kept his resydens. ye know well / how all England was
obeysa^t to him / as well the church as ye people: because ye french king was
Clementyne / and all France. This Urbane / on whom the englysshemen and
diverse other countries believed: He being at Gennes / aduysed how he might anoy
the french king / and so he thought to send in to England for socoure. I
shall show you by what manner. He sent his Bulls to the archebysshoppes and
bysshoppes of England / making mencyon: how he assoyled from pain and from
sin / all such as would aid to distroy the Clementyns. For he knew well /
how Clement his aduersarye / had done in likewise in the realm of France /
and does daily. And they called the vrbanystes in their faith and believe / to
be but dogs. so this Urbane saw well / that the Clementynes would conde^pne
and distroy him if they might And he saw well / he could not more grieve the
frenchmen / than by the englysshmen. But first he saw well / he must find the
means to gather toguyder great riches. For he knew well the nobles of
England / for all his absolucyons / would not ride forth in war / without
money. For men of war live not by pardons / nor they set not much thereby /
but in the article of death. Than^e he determined beside these Bulls / to
send in to England to the prelates / that they should ordain a full Dysme on
the churches. The noble men and men of war thereof to be paid their wages /
without greuynge of any part of the kings treasur / or of the comontie of the
realm. The which thing the Pope thought the barons and knights of England
gladly would harken unto. Than he caused to be written and engrossed Bulls / as
well to the king and his uncles / as to the prelates of England / of plain
absolucyon from pain * and sin. And beside that / he granted to ye king and
to his uncles / a plain Dysme to be taken and leuyed through out all
England. so that sir Henry Spensar bishop of Norwyche / should be chief
captain of all ye men of war because the goods came fro the church.
therefore the pope would / yt one of the church should be chief gouernoure. And
to the intent that the churches and commons of the realm / should the better
believe the matter. And beside yt / because he knew the realm of Spaygne
contrary to his opinyon / and some what alyed with ye french king. He aduysed
/ that with part of the same gold and silver that should be gadered in the
realm of England That the duke of Lancastre / who reputed him self king of
Castle by the right of his wife / that he in likewise should make another army
in to Castle. And also / if the duke of Lancastre take on him the said viage /
than the pope said: he would grant to the king of Portyngale / who made new
war with king Johan of Castle / for king Fraunces was deed: a plain dysme
through out all Portingale. Thus pope Urbane ordained all his business / and
sent a.xxx. Bulls in to England / the which were received with great joy.
Than the prelates in their iurysdictions / began to preche this voyage in manner
of a crosey / whereby the people of England / who light lie believed gave thereto
great faith. and believed verilye / that they could not go to paradyse if they
dyed that year / without they gave so^ what in pure alms toward this war.
At London and in the dyoses / there was gathered a tonne full of gold and
silver. And according to the popes Bulls / he that most gave most pardon
obtained. And whosoever dyed in that season and gave his goods to these
perdones / was clean assoyled from pain and from sin. and according to the
tenor of the Bulls happy was he that dyed in that seasone / for to have so
noble absolucyon. Thus they gathered money all the winter and lent season /
what by the pardons and by the dysmes. That as it was said it drew to the
sum of.xxv. hundred thousand frankes.

How the bishop of Norwiche and the english men issued out of England / to
ron and to make war against all those that held with pope Clement. Cap.
CCCC.xxix.
When the king of England / his uncles and counsel / understood what money
was gadered: they were right ioyouse and said. How they had money enough to
make war against two realms / that was to say: against France and Spain.
To go into Spain in the name of the pope and of the prelates of England with
the duke of Lancastre / was ordained the bishop of London called Thomas /
brother to therle of Deuonshyre to be chief capitayn / and with him two. M.
spears and four thousand archers: and they to have half of the money thus
gadered. But it was ordained / that they should not so soon depart out of
England as ye bishop of Norwiche / because that army should aryue at Calys /
and so to enter in to France. and they wist not what should fall thereby / nor
whider the french king would reyse any puyssa^ce to fight with the^ or not.
Also there was another point contrary to the duke of Lancastre yet he had great
joy of that vyage. For generally all the comontie of England more enclyned to
be with the bishop of Norwiche / than to go with the duke of Lancaster: for a
long season ye duke was not in the grace of ye people. And also / they thought
the realm of France to be nerer journey / than into Spain. And also some
said / yt the duke of Lancaster for couytousnes of thesyluer and gold that was
gadered of the church and of the pardons / whereof he should have his part:
that he did enclyne rather thereto for the profit / than for any devotion. But
they said / how the bishop of Norwiche represented the pope / and was by him
instytuted. Whereby the greattest part of England gave to him great faith /
and the king also. And so there was ordained at the wages of the church to go
with this bishop Henry Spensar / diverse good knights and squyers of
England and of Gascoyne. As the lord Beaumont / sir Hugh Caurell / sir Thomas
Tryuet / sir Wyllm^ Helmon / sir Johan Ferres / sir Hugh Spensar cosyn to the
bishop / son to his brother / sir Wyllyam Fermeton / sir Mathewe Reedman
capytayne of Berwike: all these were of England. And of gascoyns / there was
the lord of Newcastell and sir John^ his brother / Raymon marsen / Guyllonette
de Pauxe / Garyot Uyghier / Johan de Cachytan and diverse other / and all
counted they were a five hundred spears and fyftene hundred of other men. And
a great no^bre of priests / because the matter touched the church and moved by
the pope.

THese men of war provided themself for the matter / and passage was delivered
them at Dover and at Sandwyche. And this was about Ester / and so they passed
over little and little as they list / this voyage was in the manner of a
Croysey. Thus they passed the sea / or the bishop and other capitayns were
fully ready. For the bishop and sir Hugh Caurell / sir Thomas Tryuet / and sir
Wyllm^ Helmon were with the king and his counsel. and there they swear
solempnely in the kings presens / to bring truly to an end their voyage.
Nor to fight against no man nor country that belde with pope Urbayne / but to
fight and make war against them that were of the opinyon of Clement. Thus
they swear. and than y^ king by the advise of his counsel said to them. sir
bishop and all ye / when ye come to Calais / I will ye soiourne there in
that fronter y^ space of a month / and in that term* I shall refresshe you
with new men of war / of arms / and archers. And I shall send you a good
marshall / a valyant man sir Wyllyam Beauchampe / for I have send for him / he
is in the March of Scotland / where as he keeps fronter against the scotts /
for the trewse between the Scotts and us falls now at saint Johans tide.
and after his return / ye shall have him in your company without any fail.
Therefore I would ye should tarry for him / for he shall be to you right
necessary / both for his wisdom and good counsel. The bishop and his
company promised the king so to do. And thus they departed fro the king and
took the sea at Dover and arrived at Calayes the.xxiii. day of April. the year
of our lord god / a thousand three hundred fourscore and three.

tHe same season there was captain at Calais sir Johan Deluarnes / who
received the bishop and his company with great joy. And so they landed
little and little / and all their horses and baggage. and so lodged in Calays
and there about / in bastylles that they made daily. And so there they tarried
till the fourth day of May / abidyng for their marshall sir Wylliam Beauchampe
/ who came not of all that time. When the bishop of Norwiche / who was young
and courageous and desirous to be in arms (for he never bare armure before /
but in Lumbardy with his brother) Thus as he was at Calays / and saw how he
was captain of so many men of arms. he said one day to his company. Sirs /
why do we soiourne hereso long / and tarry for sir Wyllyam Beaucha^pe / who
comes not? The king nor his uncles I trow think little of us. Let us do some
deeds of arms / sithe we be ordained so to do. Let us enploy the money of
the church truly while that we live / let us conquer somewhat of our
enemies. That is well said sir quod all those that herd him speak / let us
warn all our company that we will ride forth within this three days. And let
us take advise which way we shall draw / we can not issue out of the gates /
but we enter in to the lands of our enemies / for it is french all about on
every part / we were as good to go toward Flaunders as to Boloyne. For
Flaunders is a land of conquest / conquered by the puyssaunce of the french
king. We can not bestow our time more honorably all things consydred: than
to conquer it again. And also the earl of Flaunders has done of late a great
dispyte to men of our country / for without any tytell of reason / he has
banysshed and chased the^ out of Bruges and out of all Flanders. It passes
not two year / sithe that he would have been loathe to have done so / but as now
he is feign to obey to the pleasure of the french king. wherefore quod the
bishop if I may be believed / the first journey y^ we shall make shall be into
Flanders. Sir quod sir Thomas Tryuet and sir Wylliam Helmone / ye shall be
well believed. Let us ride into that party within this three days / for it is
of the land of our enemies. To this counsel they all agreed and gave war
nynge each to other.

How the english men took the town and mynster of Grauelynge / and how the
earl of Flaunders sent to speak with the^. Cap. CCCC.xxx.
AT all this agreement was not sir Hugh Caurell / for he was gone to se a cousin
of his the Captain of Guynes / called sir Johan Droithton and so he was there
all day / and returned again the next day. Than the bishop sent for him
to the castle / for the knights had said to the bishop. how they would
have the advise of sir Hughe Caurell or they did any thing / because be had
most seen and used the war. than the bishop said to him (as ye have herd
before) and commanded him to say his advise. Than sir Hughe answered him and
said. sir ye know well on what condycion we be departed out of England. Our
enterprise touches no thing the war between the kings* / but all only
against the Cleme^tyns / for we be soudyers of pope Urbane. Who has clean
assoyled us from all sin and pain / if we do our power to distroy the
Clementyns. If we go in to Flaunders / though the country has been conquered
by the french king and the duke of Burgoyne / yet for all that we should do
amysse For as I understand / the Earl of Flaunders and all the flemynges / be
as good Urbanystes as we be. Also sir / we have not men ynowe to enter in to
Flaunders / for they are all ready and used in the war / and they are a great
nombre of people. They have done nothing else / but lyned in war this three or
four year: and also it is a strong country to enter in to. Also the
fle^mynges have done us no trespass. But sir / if we shall ride let us ride
in to France / there be our enemies in two manners. The king our lords war is
now opyn. And also the frenchmen are good Clementyns / contrary to our believe
and against our pope. Also sir / we should abide for our marshall sir Wyllm^
Beaucha^pe / who should hastily come to us with a good no^bre of men: And the
last word that our king said / was that he would send him to us. But sir /
my counsel is if we shall needs ride / let us draw toward Air or
Moustrell. There is none I think as yet / that will come against us. And
always men will come to us out of Flanders / who has lost all that they
have. they will be glad to go with us / in hope to win some what again.
They bear yuell will in their hertes to the frenchmen / who has slain in the
wars: their fathers / brethren / kynsmen and fre^des. Sir Hughe could scant
speak these words / but that the bishop took the matter hot and hasty / and
said. A sir Hughe / ye have so well learned to ride in France / that ye can
not ride in to none other place. We can not better ride to our profit / thanne
to enter in to the fronter of Flanders by the sea cost: as to the town of
Bourbourge / of Dunesshe / of Mesport / of Bergues / of Cassell / of Ipre / and
of Proprigne. In these said countries as I am informed by the burgesses of
Gaunt / they had never war that grieved them. Let us go thither and refresshe
us and abide there / for our marshall if he will come. How be it wese not yet
but little aparence of his coming. When sir Hughe Caurell / saw that the
bishop did take him up so shortly. And he consydred well / how he was their
chyefe captain / and that he was a great man and of great lygnage / he held
his peace. For he saw well also / how that his opinion should not be
sustained / another by ser Thomas Tryuet nor by sir Wylliam Helmon. than he
departed and said. Sir / if ye ride forth / sir Hughe Caurell shall ride with
you. nor ye shall not go that way but y^ he dare well go the same. I believe well
quod y^ bishop / ye have good will to ride forth / therefore make you ready /
for we will ride to morrow.

oN this purpose they were all agreed / and their rydinge forth was publysshed
through out the town. And in the morning the trumpettes sowned / and every
man departed in to the feldes / and took the way to Grauelyng. And they were
in nombre / about a three thousand men armed / and so they came to the port of
Grauelynge. Thesee was as than but low / and so they passed forth and
assailed the mynster / the which they of y^ town had fortifyed. The town was
closed but with pales / the which could not long endure. Nor also the men of
the town were but see men. If there had been gentylmen / it would have held
le^gar than it did. Nor also they country was not ware thereof / for they
feared nothing the^glysshmen. Thus the^glysshmen conquered y^ town of
Grauelyng and entered in to it / and than drue to y^ mynster / wherinto the
people of y^ town were drawn. And put therein all their goods / on trust of
the strength of the place / and their wives and children / and made round
about it great dykes / so that the englysshmen could not have it at their ease
/ for they were there two days or they wanne it. yet finally they wan it / and
slew all them that kept it with defense / and with the resydue they did what
they list. Thus they were lords and masters of Grauelynge / and lodged
toguyder in the town / and found there plenty of prouisyon. Than all the
country began to be afraid / and did put their goods in to the fortresses
/ and send their wives and children to Bergues / to Bourbourcke / and to saint
Omers. The earl of Flaunders who lay at Lysle / whan^e he understood these
tidings / how that the english men made him war and had taken Grauelynge:
than he began to dout of them of Frank and of Bruges / and called his
counsel to him and said. I have great marueyle of the english men / that
they run this on my land. They demanded never nothing of me? and thus
without any defyaunce to enter in to my land. Some of his counsel answered
him and said. Sir / it is a thing well to marueyle of. But it is to be
supposed / that they repute you therle of Flanders to be french / because the
french king has so rydden in this country / that all is yielded to him. Why
quod therle / what is best than to be done? Sir quod they / it were good that
ye send sir Johan Uillayns and sir John^ Moulyn / who be here present (and
also they have a pensyon of the king of England) in to England to speak with
the king there fro you / and to show him sagely all this business. And to
demand of him / why he does make you war. we think when he hereth your
messangers speak / he will not be content with them that thus warreth against
your country / but call them back to their great blame. yea quod the Earl /
but in the mean time while they go in to England / they that be now at
Grauelynge will go farther: and do great damage to them of Frank. sir quod
they / than let the^ first go to the^ at Grauelynge / and desire of them a save
conducte to go to Calayes / and so in to England. And to know of them / what
it is that they demand of you. We think these two knights are so well
aduysed / and will handell them so wisely that they shall set the country in
rest and peace. I am content it be thus quod the earl. Than these two knights
were enfourmed by the earl and his counsel / what they should say to the
bishop of Norwych / and to show him what charge they have to go in to
England / to show the matter to the king there / and to his uncles.

iN the mean season that these knights prepared to go to Grauelynge / to
speak with the bishop of Norwyche. All the country arose / about Burbourcke /
Bergues / Cassell / Propringe / Furnes / Newport / and other towns. And they
came to Do^kyrke / and there abode in the town. Saying / how they would
shortly issue out and defend their fronters / and fight with the englysshmen.
And these men of Flaunders had a captain / called sir Johan Sporequyn /
gouernoure of all the lands of the lady of Bare / the which land lies in the
marchesse about Ipre. And this sir Johan Sporequyn / knew nothing that the
earl of Flaunders would send in to England For the Hase of Flaunders was
newly come to him with.xxx. spears. And showed him how that the earl was at
Lysle about a marriage to be had / between his suster and the^ lord Delbaryn.
So these two knights did as much as they could / to stir the country to
rise / so that they were to the no^bre of twelfe thousand pykes / with
pauesses and cootes of steel: hoctons / shapeause / and bassenettes. And in a
manner / they were all of the land of y^ lady of Bars / between Grauelynge
and Donkyrke / as I was enfourmed. And a three leages in y^ way there stood the
town of Mardyke / a great vyllage on the sea side unclosed. And thither came
some of the englysshmen and scrimysshed. And so thus came to Grauelynge / sir
Johan Uyllayne and sir Johan de Moulyne / for the Earl of Flaunders / by a
saueconduct that he had attained fro the bishop / or he came fro Burbourcke.
Than they came to the bishop of Norwiche / who made to them by semblaunt
right good chere. He had with him at dinner y^ same day all the lords of the
host / for he knew well / the earls knights should come to him the same time.
And his mind was / how he would that they should find them all toguyder. than
these two knights began to speak and said. Sir / we be send hyder to you /
fro the Earl of Flaunders our lord. What lord quod the bishop? They
answered again and said. fro the earl: there is none other lord of
Flanders. By the good lord quod the bishop / we take for the lord of
Flaunders the french king / or else the duke of Burgoyne our enemies. For by
puyssance but late / they have conquered all the country. Sir quod the knights
/ saving your displeasure. The land was at Tourney / clerelye rendered again
and put in to the hands and gouernyng of the earl of Flaunders / who has sent
us to you. Desyring you that we two / who have pensyon of the king of England
/ may have a saueco^duct to go in to England to speak with the king / to
know the cause why / without any defyaunce / he makes war against the earl
and his country of Flanders. Sirs quod the bishop / we shall take aduyce and
answer you to morrow. So thus they went to their logynge and left the
englysshmen in counsel / and so all that day they took counsel together /
and concluded as ye shall here.

The answer that the bishop of Norwyche made to the knights of Flaunders
/ and of the assemble that they of Cassell and of the country about / made
against thenglysshmen. Cap. CCCC.xxxi.
ALl things consydred and regarded / they said they would grant no
safeco^duct to the^ to go in to England / for it was to far of. For or they
could return again the country would be sore styrred / and greatly
fortifyed. And also therle should by that time / send word thereof to the
french king and to the duke of Burgoyne / whereby they might come with such
no^bre of people against them / that they should not be able to resyst the^ /
nor to fight with them. So on this determynacyon they rested. Than it was
demanded among the^ / what answer they should make to the knights of
Flaunders the next day. Than sir Hugh Caurell was commanded to speak and to
give his aduyce. Than he said thus to the bishop. Sir / ye are our chief
captain. sir ye may say to them / how ye be in the land of the duchess of
Bare / who is Clementyne. and how for Urbane ye make war and for no body
else. And offer the^ that if this land with the churches and abbeys will become
good Urbanystes / and to ride with you and to bring you through the country.
ye will than cause all yor company to pass through the country pesably / and
to pay for all that they shall take. But as touching to give them saueconduct
to go in to England / ye will not grant thereto in no wise For ye may say /
that your war touches no thing the war of England nor of France / but
that we be soudyers of pope Urbane. Sir as I think this answer should
suffyce. Every man agreed well to this / and specially y^ bishop / who had
mind of nothing that was said but to fight and to war on the country. Thus
the matter abode all night. And in y^ morning after mass / the two said
knights of the earls. Desyringe to have an answer / ca^e to the bysshoppes
lodging / and abode there till he came out to go to mass. And so than they
stepped forth before him / and there he made the^ good chere by semblant. And
devised with them a little of other matters / to delay the time till his
knights were come about him. And when they were all assembled toguyder / than
the bishop said to them. Sirs / ye tarry for an answer / and ye shall have it
/ on the request that ye make for the earl of Flaunders. I say unto you / ye
may return again when ye list to the Earl your master / or else to go to
Calais on your ieoperdy or in to England: but as for saueco^duct ye get none
of me. For I am not the king of England nor I have not so far authorite so to
do. I and all my company are but soudyers of pope Urbane / and of wages of him:
and take his money to serve him truly. And now we be in y^ land of the
duchess of Bare / who is a Clementyne: and if the people be of that opynion /
we will make them war. And if they will go with us and take our part / they
shall have part of our pardons and absolucyons. For Urbayne our pope for whom
we are in voyage / has assoyled us clean from pain and from sin / and all
those that will aid to distroy the Cleme^tyns. When the knights herd these
words / sir Johan Uillayns said. Sir in that as touching the pope / I think
ye have not herd the contrary / but that my lord therle of Flaunders has been
always good Urbanyst. Wherefore sir / ye do yuell to make war to him or to his
country. Nor I think the king of England yo^ lord has not charged you so to
to. for he is so noble that if he would have made him war / first he would
have defied him. With those words the bishop began to were angry and said.
Well sirs / go to your earl and say unto him / that he gets nothing else of
us. And if ye will send in to England to know the kings pleasure / do as ye
list: but as for this way nor by Calys they shall not(...)sse. And when these
knights saw they could not attaygne to their purpose none otherwise / they
departed and returned to their lodging and dyned. And after dyuer departed /
and went the same night to saint Omers.

THe same day that the knights deperted / there came tidings to the bishop
/ y^ there was at Donkyrke and theraboute / a.xii. thousand men in harness /
and the bastard of Flaunders in their company / as their chief captain: and
diverse other knights and squiers with them. In somoche it was showed him that
on the thursdaye before / they had scrimysshed with his company / and slain a
hundred of them. Lo quod the bishop ye may se wheder the earl do medyll in
this matter or not / it is he that does all. He entreats for peace with the
sword in his hand. Let us ride forth to moro we and go to Donkyrke / and se
what people they be that be there gadered Every man agreed thereto: and the same
day there ca^e to the bishop two knights / the one fro Calys the oath* fro
Guysnes / and with them a.xxx. spears and threscore archers. The knights were
called sir Nicholas Clyncon and sir John^ dracton captain of Guysnes. In the
next morning they made them ready to ride forth / and so drew in to the
field: They were mo than. vi hundred spears and sixtene hundred archers. And
so they rode toward Mardyke and Do^kyrke / the bishop made to be borne before
him the arms of the church / the baner of saint Peter: field goules two keys
silver / like soudyers of pope Urbane. And in his penon he bare his own arms
/ silver and azure quarterly / a fret gold on the azur / a bend of goules on
the silver. And because he was youngest of y^ Spe^sars / he bare a border of
goules for a difference There was also sir Hugh Spe^sar his nephue with his
penon. And with baner and penon / there was the lord Beaumont / sir Hughe
Caurell / sir Thom^s Tryuet / and sir Wylliam Helmon. And with penon without
baner / there was sir Wylliam Dractone / sir Johan his brother / sir Mathue
Reedman / sir John^ Ferres sir Wyllyam Fermeton / and sir Johan of New castle
gascone. Thus these men of arms rode toward Mardyke / and there refresshed
them and drank / and so passed forth and took the way to Donkyrke. And the
flemmynges that were there assembled / were aduertysed that the Englysshmen
would come that way / ready aparelled to fight with them. So they determined
among them self to draw in to the field / and to be ready in good array to
fight / if need required. for they thought to abide in the town / and to be
closed therein / should be nothing to them profitable. And as they ordained so
it was done: every man armed him self in the town / and issued out in to the
field. Than they set them self in good array on a little hill without the
town / and they were in no^bre a.xii. M. or mo.

ANd so therewith there came the englysshmen aprochyng to Donkyrke / and they
beheld the mountain on heir right hand to ward Burbourcke / toward the sea
side. And there they saw the flemynges in a great battle well ordered. Than
they tarried / for it seemed to them y^ the flemynges would give the^ battle.
Than the lords drew toguyder to counsel and there were diverse opinyons /
and specially the bishop of Norwyche / would that they should inco^tynent go
and fight with them. And other / as the lord Beaumont and sir Hugh Caurell /
said to the contrary. Layeng diverse reasons and saying. Sir / ye know well
the flemynges that be yonder have done us no forfayte. And to say the truth
/ we have sent to the Earl of Flaunders no defyaunce / and yet we be here in
his country. This is no courtesse war that we make / we do nothing but catch
it and we may without any reasonable war. And also all this country that we be
in / be as vrbanystes as well as we be / and holds y^ same opinyon that we
do. Behold now therefore and se / what just cause we have to ron thus on
them? Than the bishop said / how know we that they be Urbanystes or not?
In the name of god quod sir Hughe Caurell / me think it were good that we
send to them an heraude / to know what thing they demand / thus to be
raynged in battle against us / and let it be demanded of what pope they
hold of. And if they answer and say how they be good vrbanystes / than
require them by the virtue of the popes bull that we have / that they will go
with us to saint Omers / Air / or Arras / or thither as we will bri^ge them.
And wha^ they be thus required / than thereby we shall know their entensyon /
and thereupon we may take advise and counsel. This purpose was holden / and an
heraude called mount forde parteyning to the duke of Bretayne / was commanded
by all the lords to go to the fleminges / and to show them as ye have herd
before The heraulde obeyed their commandment as it was reason / and so went
to speak with them.

How the flemynges of the country and they of the land of Cassell were
disconfyted by the englysshmen / and Donkyrke taken: with diverse other
castelles in the country. Cap. CCCC.xxxii.
THus the heraude deperted fro the lords / and had on his cote of arms / and
so went to ward the flemynges and thought non yuell / they were all toguyder
in a great battle. And so the heraude would have goone to some knights that
were there / but he might not. For as soon as he aproched nere to the flemynges
/ they took and slew him without any demanding fro whens he ca^e / or wheder
he would. Thus they slew him like people of small knowledge. The gentylmen
that were there could not save him / when the englysshmen saw their dealyng /
they were sore displeased. So were the burgesses of gau^t such as were there /
who were right glad to move for the the matter / so that there might be a new
brewlynge in Flaunders. Than the English men said. (...) yonder rybaudes
have slain our heraude / but he shall be dear sold to them / or else we will
all dye in the place. Than they commanded their archers to step for the
toward the flemynges. And there was a burgess of Gaunt made knight / and
incontinent the battle began sore and sharp. For to say truth / the
flemynges marvelously defended them self / but the archers shot so thick /
that they ouerthrue many and grieved the^ sore. And the men of arms entered in
among them with sharp spears / and at the first front ouerthrue many.
Finally the englysshmen wan the place / and the flemynges disco^fited and
fled a way / thynkinge to enter in to Donkyrke. But the englysshmen chased
them so sore / that they entered in to the town with them. So that in the
streets and on the sands / there was many a flemmyng slain. How be it there
were many Englysshmen flayne / to the nombre of four hundred or mo* they were
found after in the town here and there / by ten atones / twenty.xxx. ye
and by forty. For as they did chase the flem minges in the streets they were
fought withal how be it finally / the flemynges were nere all slain or
taken. Thus fell of this re^countre at Donkyrke / where there were slain of the
flem mynges a nine thousand.

tHe same day of the battle / there returned to Lysle to the earl of
Flaunders sir Johan Uyllayns and sir Johan de Molayne / and showed him all y^
report that they had seen and herd of thenglysshmen / where with the earl was
right pensive to think how he should deal in the matter. And also he was more
pensive / and so he had cause: when he herd the tidings that his men were
slain and disco^fyted at Donkyrke. So he bare it patiently / and did
reconfort him self and said. Well / if we have lost at one time / we shall wyn
again at another time and it please god. So inco^tynent he wrote thereof to the
duke of Burgoyne / to the intent that some resystence might be made. For he
ymagined well / that the Englysshmen having ones that enter in to Flanders /
that they would do more hurt in the country / or they departed again. And
whan^e the duke of Burgoyne understood thereof / he send knights and squiers
in to the garysons on the fronters of Flaunders. As to saint Omers / to Air /
to saint Uenaunt / to Baylleule / to Bergues / to Cassell / and to all the
bayliwykes / to keep thentre of Arthoyse. Now let us speak of thenglysshmen
and how they perceyuered.

aFter y^ disconfyture at Donkyrke and the town taken. The English men
entered in to great pride / for it seemed to them / that all Flaunders had been
theirs. And to say the truth / if they had as than gone to Bruges (as they
said that knew the dealyng of the^ of the town) the town had been given up
to them. But the Englysshmen wrought otherwise / for they took ad^yse to go to
Bourburcke and to get that town / and so to go to Air and to Cassell / and
to conquer all y^ country. And to leave nothing behind them that should be
contrary to them / and than to go to Ipre. They thought verily / that the
town of Ipre would soon yield up / if they saw all the country yelden
before. So thus the englysshemen departed fro Donkyrke and went to Burbourcke /
and when they of the town saw the^ aprochenere to their town / they yielded
up the town / saving their lives and goods. And so they were received / and
the Englysshmen entered with great joy. saying / how they would make there a
good garyson for to keep war against them of saint Omers / and the fronters
nere adjoining. And so than after they wanne the castle of Driceham / and they
were three days before it or they wan it. And than they conquered it byforce /
and therein were slain a two hundred men that were there in garyson. And than
the englysshemen repaired again the castle and said. How they would keep it
to the best of their powers / and so set therein new men. And thanne they
went forth and came to Cassell and took the town / and had therein great
pyllage. Than they departed* and said they would go and se the town of Air.
How be it there was many of them that knew right well that the town was not
easy to be won / without great loss of their men. How be it the bishop
of Norwiche said / he would go nere it and look thereon.

How the englisshmen conquered all the country of Flaunders / fro Do^kyrke to
Scluse: and how they be seged the town of Ipre. Cap. CCCC.xxxiii.
THe same season capytayne of Air was sir Robert of Bethune vycount of Mealr /
and with him there was sir Johan Roy / the lord of Clary / sir Johan of bethune
his brother / the lord of Montigny / sir Perducas of Pount saint / sir Johan
of Chauny / and sir Floreyns his son and diverse other / So that they were a
sixscore spears of good men of arms knights and squyers. When the bishop
of Norwiche / and sir Hugh Caurell / sir Henry Beaumont / sir Thomas Tryuet /
sir Wyllyam Helmon / sir Mathewe Reedman / and the other englysshemen. When
they did aproche nere to Air / at a place called the New dike. They put
them self in order of battle / and so passed forth with baners and penons
wauyng withthe wind / for they knew not what the vycount of Meaulxe was
minded to do. The vycont and his company being as thanne there in garysone /
were rainged in good order on the causey / before the barryers of the town.
And there they might se clearly the englysshemen pass by / taking the way to
saint Uenaunt: but they were not men ynowe to stop them their way. Thus they
stood still keeping watch and ward / ready at their defense. And the
Englysshmen passed by and so went the same night a two miles fro sait Uenaunt
/ whereof a knight of Picardy was captain / called sir Wyllyam de Melle: Who
had fortifyed the mynster for him and his company / to draw in to if need
required / and so he did. For the town was closed but with small palys and
dykes / wherefore it could not long endure against the englysshmen. So the
french men withdrewe them self / some in to the castle and some into the
church / the which was right strong. They of the castle were not assailed /
for it was marvelous strong. There could no man aproche nere thereto / the
dykes round about were so large and deep. But the mynster was incontinent
assailed by the Englisshmen / when they had entered the town / by cause they
had knowledge that the men of arms were withdrawn in to it.

sIr Wyllyam of Melle Was a good knight and a valyant / and nobly defended the
church of saint Uenant. the English archers were round about it / and they
shot up arowes so thycke and so rudely / that they within durst scant apere
at any defense How be it they above had stones and artyllarye great plenty /
and did cast down stones and other things / and hurt many beneth. how be
it the assaut was so sore continued by the englysshmen / that the mynster was
won byforce: And sir Wyllyam de Melle within / who valyantly fought at his
defense / and so did all his company. And if they had parceyued any confort of
rescue / they would le^gar have co^tynued: but there was no conforte that they
could parceyue / and therefore they were the easier to win. Thus sir Wyllyam of
melle was prisoner with the englysshmen / and so set to his fynaunce. And so
went in to France by his bond of oblygacion: as all gentylmen englisshe and
french were wont to do each with other. but so did not the Almayns / for when
an almayne has taken a prisonere he puts him in to yrons and in to hard
prisone without any pytie / to make him pay the greatter fynaunce and ransom.

THus when the bishop of Norwyche and thenglysshmen departed fro saint
Uenant / they went and lodged in the wode of Mepce which was not far thens /
and about Baylueufe in Flaunders. And so entered into ye bayliwyke of Proprigne
and Messynes / and took all the close towns and therein found great pyllage /
and conveyed all their pillage and votie to Bergues and to Burborke. And when
they had all the country at their pleasure / and that they were lords of the sea side: as of Grauelyng to Sluse / of Donkyrke of Newport / of Furnes / and
of Bla^cque Berque. Than they went and laid siege to Ipre and there they rested
and than send to Gaunte. As I understood they send Frau^ces Atreman / who had been at the battle and at all their co^questes / for he was their gyde fro
town to town.

How the Englysshmen send for them of Gaunt / and how they came to the siege
of Ipre: And of the lord saint Ledger and his company / who were disconfyted by
thenglysshmen and how the bishop of Liege came to the siege of Ipre. Ca. iiii
C.xxxiiii.
WHan^e Peter de Boyse and Peter de Mirt / and the capitayns of Gaunt.
understood how the englysshmen send for them to come to the sege of Ipre.
they were gretlye thereof reioysed / and ordained inco^tynent to go thither. And
so departed fro Gaunt on a saturday in the morning / next after the vias of
saint Peter and s. Poule to the nombre of twenty thousand / and with great
caryage and ordinance: and so went through the country beside Courtrey to
Ipre. And of their coming the Englysshmen were greatly joyful / and made them
good chere and said. Sirs / surely we shall now shortly conquer Ipre / and
than we will win Bruges Dan / and Sluse. Thus they made no dout yt or the
end of Septembre / they should co^quere all Flanders. Thus they glorified in
their for tunes. The same season there was a captain in Ipre / a right sage
and a valyant knight / called Peter de la Syeple. He ordered all the business
of the town. There were men of arms with him / set there by the duke of
Burgoyne and therle of Flaunders: As sir Johan of Bougrayne chatelayne of Ipre
/ sir Baudwyn Del beden his son / the lord Dyssegien / the lord of Stades /
sir Johan Blancharde / sir Johan Meselede sir Hamell / sir Nycholas Belle / the
lord of Harleq^becke / the lord of Rollechen / sir John^ Ahoutre / John^ la
Sieple squier nephue to the captain / Frau^ces Bell / sir George bell and
diverse other expert men of arms / who had daily great pain and woe to defend
their town. And also they were in great fear / leest the commons of the town
should make any treaty with them of Gaunt / whereby they should be in danger
and be betrayed by them of Ipre.

THe same season there was in the town of Courtrey a valyant knight of
Heynalte / called sir Johan of Jumont. He was set there at the request of the
duke of Burgoyne and of therle of Flaunders. When he took it on him there was
never a knight in Flaunders durst enterprise to keep it: it was so perylous to
keep For when the french king went out of that country it was vnrepayred.
And few folks abode therein / for all was brent and beaten down so that it
was much pain to lodge therein any horse. So this sir John^ Jumont took on him
to keep it / and incontinent did repair it. and did so thanked by god / that
he attaygned nothing thereby: but honor and praise. The duke of Burgoyne to
whom the business of flanders touched right nere / took great study to brige
well all thing to pass. And so he send a three score spears bretons to
Courtrey / to thentent to refresshe the town: and so first these spears came
to the duke to Lisle. And on a friday they departed thens and took the way to
Comynes / and the lord of saint Ledger and yuonet of Ca^temat were capitayns of
the said spears. And in to the town of Comynes the same morning at the
breaking of the day / there was come two hundred English spears to fetch
forage abroad in the country / to bring it to their host before Ipre. The
said bretons or they were ware fell in their hands and danger. So there was a
hard and a sore encountre / at the foot of the bridge of Comynes: and
valiantly the breto^s did bear them self. If they had been rescued with as
many mo as they were / by lykelyhode they had escaped without damage. How be
it they were feign to fly / for they were to few me^ to endure long. The
most part of them were slain and taken in the field / retournynge toward
Lysle. The lord of saint Ledger was sore wounded and left for deed in the
place / they were happy yt escaped. The chase endured within half a mile of
Lyle: to the which town the lord of saint Ledger was carried / wounded as he
was / and a five days after he dyed / and so did five of his squyers. thus
fortuned of this adventure.

THus still the siege lay at Ipre. The englisshmen and gau^toys made many
assautes and they of the town trymvled for fear. the earl of Flaunders being
at Lysle feared greatly the taking of Ipre / for he knew well the englisshmen
were right subtell. and comfort might daily come to the^ fro Calys / by reason
of ye garysons that they had won in their way. And indede they might have had
great socoure out of England and they had list / but at the beginning they set
nothing by the earl / nor by all the power of France. There were diverse great
lords of England about the marches of Dover and Sandwiche / ready apparelled
to pass the sea to Calys / and to have aided their company if they had been
required. There were ready M. spears and two thousand archers. Sir Wyllyam
Beauchampe and sir Wyllm^ Wyndsore marshals of England were soueraygne
capitayns / set there by the king and by his counsel. And for that cause the
duke of Lancaster lost his vyage that season into Portyngale. For all the
realm of England was rather enclyned to the bishop of Norwiches army tha^ to
the duke of La^castres. Therle of Flaunders knew right well all this business
and insydentes / as they fell in England: and every thing that was done at the
siege of Ipre / thynkyng to find remedy to his power. He thought well yt the
duke of Burgoyne would move the french king and ye lords of the Realm / to
reyse and to assemble to drive the englysshemen out of Flaunders / the which
they had won the same year. And because he knew that the assemblynge of the
lords of France would belong / and specially of the^ that should serve the
king out of far countries. and that many things might fall or they came
toguyder. Therefore he aduysed to send to the bishop of Liege sir Arnolde
Desorge who was good Urbanyst. To the intent that he should come to Ipre / to
treat with the Englysshmen to depart fro thens / and to draw to some other
part: because he had great marueyle that they should make him war. Seeing
that he was good Urbanyst / and all the country of Flaunders: as all the world
knew. So much did the earl of Flaunders / that the bishop of Liege came
in to Heynaulte and passed Ualencennes / and so came to Doway and than to Lysle
and spoke with the earl. And there determined what he should say to
thenglyssheme^. And so thus the bishop of Liege ca^e to the siege before Ipre
/ to speak with the bishop of Norwiche and thenglysshmen / and with the^ of
Gaunte: and they received him right well / and were glad to here him speak.

Of the great commandment of assemble that the french king made to the
intent to reyse the siege before Ipre / and of them that were dysconfyted by
the Englysshemen. Cap. CCCC.xxxv.
ANd as I was than enfourmed / the earl of Flaunders by the words of ye
bishop of Liege: offered to the bisshoppe of Norwiche and to the englysshmen.
That if they would leave their siege before Ipre / and to go to some other
part / and to make war against the Clementyns. how he would find five
hundred spears to serve them three months / at his cost and charge. the
bishop of Norwiche and his company answered: how they would take advise. And
so they went to counsel / and there were many opinyons. They of Gau^t said /
how it was no trust on the promise of the earl. For surely they said / how he
would begyle them and if he might. So all things consydred / the englysshmen
answered to the bishop of Liege / how yt he might depart when it pleased him
/ for as to his requests they would in no wise agree thereto. saying how they
would never depart fro ye siege / till they had the town of Ipre at their
commandment. So when the bishop of Liege saw that the could do no more in
the matter / he took his leave and returned to Lysle / and showed the earl his
answer. When the earl saw that it would be none other wise / he was more
pe^syue than he was before. and parceyued clearly yt with out the puyssaunce of
France raised the siege / he was lykely to lose the good town of Ipre. Than
he wrote all the matter and answers to his son in law the duke of Burgoyne
/ who lay at Compayne. And the bishop of Liege departed fro the Earl and
went to Doway / to Ualencennes / and so to his country

tHe duke of Burgoyne saw well how the ma^^ers of Flaunders did right yuell
and were lykely to do / without the king put to his hand / and purueyed for
some remedy. He did so much / that a great counsel was somoned to be holden
at Compayne with the great princes and lords of the Realm of France. So
thither came every man that was send for / and thither came personally the duke
of Bretayne. And there it was agreed by the kings counsel: the Duke of Berrey
/ the duke of Burbone / and the duke of Burgoyne. How the king should go
again in to Flanders as puissantly / as when he went to Rosebeque to the
intent to reyse the siege at (...)* and to fight with thenglysshmen / if they
would abide him. All these things agreed and accorded the french king send
his commandment through out all his realm / that every man should be ready in
their best apparel for the war: and to be the fyftene day of August at
Arras * and there about. The king send also to them of far countries / as
to the earl of Armynake and of Sauoy / and to the duke Frederyke of Bauyers.
This duke was of high Almaygne / and was son to one of the dukes brethren /
and greatly he desired ones to bear arms ^or them of France / and to se the
estate of France: for he loved all honor. Also he was enfourmed that all the
honors of the world was in France. And because this duke was far of /
therefore he was send for first. He prepared him self ready and said / how he
would pass through Heynalt to se his uncle and his cosyn the earl of Bloys
and other. In the mean season that these lords aparelled themself / y^ sege
endured still before ^pre / and diverse sautes and scrimysshes made / and diverse
hurt of both per^ies. But the captain of Ipre sir Peter de la sieple took so
good head / y^ he had no damage.

THis siege thus endurynge / the Earl of Flaunders being at Lysle / was
informed / how the mynster of ye town of Emenyn was sore in decay. And how
that if thenglysshmen came thither / they should lightly win it for it was not
kept. Wherefore the earl was cou^sayled to send and to repair it. Than the
earl called sir Johan de Moulyne / and said. Sir Johan / take men out of this
town and cross bows / and go to Emenyn and repair again the mynster. And
keep and defend it fro the englysshmen for if they should have it / they would
yuell trouble the country all about* the knight answered he was content / and
so prepared himself. And the next day departed and with him a young knight / a
bastard son of the Earls / called sir Johan Sansterre / and they were in
nombre about a threscore spears and threscore archers. Thus they departed fro
the town of Lysle and rode toward the town of Emenyn and so came thither and
found no body there / but such as were there at their pleasur. Than they
caused the mynster to be newly repaired / and set men a warke thereon. The
same day there rode forth fro the siege of Ipre a two hundred spears
English and Gascoyns / who knew by the forangers y^ they met / that there
were men of arms and cross bows in the town of Emenyn / and repayringe and
fortifyeng the church. Than the Englysshmen rode thither / and as soon as they
came before the mynster / they a lyghted a foot and began to cry their
cries. Whan^e sir Johan of Moulyn and the bastard of Flaunders saw their
manner / and that it behooved them to fight / they put them self in order /
and caused their Crosbowes to shote / wherewith diverse englysshme^ were hurt
how be it inco^tynent the Englysshmen entered in among them. There was of so
few men a sore scrimysshe / and many slain and hurt. how be it finally the
englysshmen were so many that the flemynges could not endure them / but so
they were disconfyted and the two knights taken / yet right valyantly they had
defended the^ self. There were but a few that returned to Lysle / for nigh
they were all taken and slain. Thus it fortuned of the adventure of Emenyn
wherewith the earl of Flaunders was right sore displeased / but he could not
amend it. The englysshmen brought their prisoners to the siege of Ipre / and
within a while after they put the^ to their ransom.

How thenglysshmen and flemynges of Gaunt made diverse assautes before Ipre.
and how the french king departed fro Compayne and went toward Ipre to reise
the siege there. Cap. CCCC.xxxvi.
THus often times falls the adue^tures of deeds of arms / sometime to win
sometime to lose. the adventures thereof are right marvelous / as they know
rightwell that follow it. This still co^tynued the siege before Ipre / and it
was thente^cyon of the bishop of Norwiche / of the englysshmen / of Peter de
Boyse and of the gau^toyse / to win Ipre by assaut or otherwise. And according
to their ente^tes / often times they assauted and scrimysshed with them of the
town. And among all their assautes / there was one special great assaute /
which endured all a day till it was nere night And there was done many a
proper deed of arms* as well by them without as by the^ within. There was made
the same day four knights within the town / as sir Johan de la syeple cosyn
to the captain / sir Fraunces Bell / sir George Bell / and sir Johan Bell was
the fourth. They were good knights / and did acquyte them self right well
the same day. There was slain with a gone a proper squire of England / called
Jews Lynne. This was a sore assaute and many hurt on both perties / as such
as adventured them self to sore. The archers of England who stood on the one
side of the dyke / shot up arowes so thick / that almoost there was none
within the town durst look out over the walls / nor scant stand at their
defense. they of Ipre gadered bp the same day two tonne full of artyllary / and
specially of arowes: for they fell so thick in the streets that none durst go
without they were well armed or pauessed. This assaut endured till it was
night. Than the^glysshmen and flemynges that had assauted all the day in two
batayls / returned to their lodgings right weary and sore traueyled / and in
likewise so were they of the town of Ipre.

When the englysshmen and flemynges that lay at the siege before Ipre / saw
how they could not win the town / and how they lost much of their
artyllary. Than they aduysed to make a great nombre of fagottes and to cast
them in to the dykes / with straw and earth to fill up the dykes / to the
intent that they might come to the walls to fight hand to hand with them of
the town / and to undermine the walls / thinking thereby to co^quere it. So
there were set men a warke to fell down wode and make fagottes / and to bring
them to the dyke. This was not so soon done nor their warke accomplysshed /
but the french king / who had great desire to reyse the siege and to fight
with the Englysshmen / auaunsed forth his business and departed fro Co^paygne
/ and so came to Arras. And than passed forth the constable of France with a
great nombre of lords ordained for the vowarde and loged in Arthoise. The duke
of Bretayne came with two thousand speres / who had great desire to confort
the earl of Flaunders his cosyn. And he was greatly bound so to do / for he
had found him ever ready aparelled in time past in all his business. Thus
lords aproched both far and nere. Than came the Earl of Sauoy and therle of
Genesue with seuyn hundred spears of pure sauosyns. The duke Frederyke of
Bauyere came forward in to Heynalte and was at Qeusnoy / and refresshed him
with his uncle the duke Aubert / and with his aunt the duches Margarete: and
with his cosyns the duke of Lorayne and the duke of Bare / and so fro thens he
came in to Arthoise. Sir Wyllyam of Namur who had not been in none of the
foresaid wars / for the earl had excused him. He came than to serve the king
and the duke of Burgoyne with two hundred spears of good men of war / and so
passed by Heynalte and came and lodged at Tornesys. Lords came fro every part
right strongly and with so good will to serve the kyng^ that it was marueyle to
consider. Therle Guy of Bloyse had assembled his men at La^drechis but his men
could not tell if he were able or could endure the pain to ride with the king
in y^ army. So he was brought in an horselytter to Beaumont in Heynalte / there
he was better at ease / the air was better for him there than at La^dreches.
How be it he was sore sick and feeble / yet he purueyed his men to serve the
king. So his company and the lord of Mo^tigny / the lord of Useryn / sir
Uyllaynes of saint Martyne / sir Ualleraunce of Oustyen captain of
Remorentyne / and other knights and squiers auaunsed forward to serve the
king.

Tidings came to the siege before Jpre to the bishop of Norwyche / to sir
Hugh Caurell / and to the englysshmen. How the french king was coming to
them / with mo than twenty thousand men of arms knights and squiers / and
mo than three score thousand of other people. These words so multyplyed in the
host / till at last they found it true. In the beginning they would scant
believe it. But than it was said plainly / how y^ king would come and fight
with the^ as they lay at their siege. And they had marueyle when they knew
how the duke of bretayne was coming against them. Than they took counsel
together / to determyne what they should do. And all things considered / they
saw well how they were of no puyssau^ce to abide the king. Than they said /
it was best that Peter de Boyse / Peter de Myrt / and the gauntoyse should
return to the town of Gaunt / and the englysshmen to Bergues and to Burborke.
And so to abide in their garysons / without that some puyssaunce come out of
England: as king Richard him self to pass the sea / or else some of his
uncles / and thereupon to take better advise. This counsel was vpholden and
every man dyslodged: they of Gaunt drew to their town / and the englisshemen
went toward Bergues and Burbourke / and so entered in to such garysons as they
had before conquered. The same day that the Englysshmen departed from the siege
/ there came to them sir Thomas Percy son to the earl of Northumberlande. He
came out of Spruce / and when he was a little fro thens / it was showed him for
certain / that the french king and the king of England should fight together
in the marchesse of Flaunders or Arthoyse / puyssaunce against puyssau^ce.
Whereof the knight had great joy / and had great desire to be at that
journey. He was as than^e.xl. days journey from thens / but he made such have
that he rode it in fourtene days / but he left all his people and baggage
behind him. And he rode so fast without chaungyng of his horse / and with him
no mo but his page / that he came to ye town of Gaunt in the said space /
which turned to him a great valyantnesse.

How the duke Frederyke of Bauyer aryued in the french kings host and how
therle Guy of Bloyse and his men ca^e to Arras / and how the kings vowarde
took Cassell. Cap. CCCC.xxxvii.
Tidings ca^e to the french king as he lay at Arras how the englysshmen were
departed fro the siege and ye gauntoyse in likewise / and every man deperted to
their holds. Tha^ the king was counseled to make have and to follow them / to
thentent they should not escape. And so he departed fro Arras and went to Mount
saint Eloy a fair abbey / and there he tarried four days / abiding till the
duke of Berry was come. still people gadered thider fro all parties / and than
it was reported by the constable and marshals / and by sir Guyss hard earl
Dolphyn master of the cross bows / how that the king had there mo than a
hundred thousand men. Than the king departed fro Mount saint Eloy / and took
his way to saint Omers and ca^e to Air / whereof the vycount of Meaulx was
captain. And there the king tarried two days / and always still aproched men
of war. and the constable and they of the vowarde were on before / and loged
at the town of mount Cassell. And so the king came to saint Omers / and there
abode and tarried for his people that came from all perties. And whan^e duke
Frederyke of Bauyers came to the host / the great barownes of France went and
met with him to do him honor because he came fro so far a country to
serve the king. The king made him great chere / and gave him great thanks for
his coming: and lodged him all the voyage after / as nere to his person as
might be. In the kings host there were to the no^bre of three thousand horses
/ wherefore it was greatly to be marueyled / how prouisyon might be had to
suffyce such an host. How be it sometime they lacked and sometime they had
great habundaunce.

tHe earl Guy of Bloyse being at Beaumont in Heynault / though it were so that
he was not in good health / for the long malady that he was in / ymagyned in
him self / that it should not be honorable for him to lie still / and so many
great lords being in the field / and also he was sent for / he was one of the
chief appointed to the reregarde. Therefore he thought it were better for him to
go forth and put him self at the pleasure of god than to abide behind /
and that men should suppose in him any cowardnes. This ge^tyll knight went
forth / but he could in no wise endure to ride / therefore he was carried in a
horselytter: and so took leave of the lady his wife and of Loys his son.
Diverse of his counsel were against his voyage / because the season was very
hot for a sick man. But every man that herd spekyng thereof / reputed in him
a great valyantnesse. and with him departed out of Heynault: the lord of
Sanzest / the lord of Hauselles / sir Gerard of Warryers / sir Thomas of
Dystre / the lord of Doustrenent / sir Johan of Guysenell / who was made
knight the same vyage / and diverse other. So thus this earl passed by Chambrey
/ and so ca^e to Arras. And the more he rode and traueyled the better he had
his helth^ his own men were before with the king. And wha^ they herd how
their lord was coming / they ca^e and met him. And so than he was to the
nombre of four hundred spears / and prouisyon ever followed after him out of
Heynaulte great plenty.

Now let us speak of the king. tHe french king so spedde in his journey /
that he came to saint Omers and there rested / and refresshed him and his
vowarde. The constable and the marshals went toward Mount Cassell / that the
Englyssmen kept. They assailed the town and wanne it with assaute / and all
that were within slain. Such as escaped went to Bergues / where as sir Hughe
Caurell was / and with him three thousand englysshmen / but the bishop of
Norwiche was gone to Grauelynge / the sooner to be at Calays if need were. All
the country about Cassell was brent and pylled by the^glysshmen. and the
french king deperted fro saint Omers / and lay at an abbey called
Raynombergues / and there rested all that friday. The saturday in the morning
the vowarde / the constable and the marshals / the lord of Coucy and a great
nombre of good men of arms went to the castle of Trughen / where there were a
three hundred men of arms / that kept it all that season. And there the
frenchmen made a great and a sharp assaut / and the englysshmen that were
within defended the^ self marvelously. How be it by pure deeds of arms the
Castle was conquered / and all that were within slain / for the constable
would take none to mercy. And in the base court / there was found the fairest
white horse that might be seen the which was presented to the constable / and
he send him inco^tynent to the king. The horse pleased so the king / in such
wise: that he rode thereon the sunday all day. Than came therle of Bloys in to
the host: he was of the reregarde as he was the year before / at the battle
of Rosebeque. Therle of Ewe / therle of Harcourt / ye lord of Chatellon / and
the lord Fere: all these in his company. And still aproched men of war on all
sides. The season was clear and fair or else there would have been much a do /
there was such a nombre of men and horses.

How the^glisshmen after the sege of Ipre / were withdrawn in to the town of
Bergues: and how they departed thens and went to Burborke when they saw the
kings puissa^ce. Cap. CCCC.xxxviii.
IN the town of Bergues / which was closed with nothing but with pales and
small dikes. The^glisshmen were gone thider save ye bishop of Norwich / who
was at Graueling sore abashed and repented him that he had made that vyage /
for he saw well he was likely to forsake his co^questes with great blame. And
also / in that he had beforesayd and vaunted / how and the king came to reyse
the siege before Ipre / he would abide and fight with him and all his puissa^ce
/ which words were spread abroad thrughout all the real me of France. and than
he saw well how he was feign suddenly to deperte fro the sege / for his
puissance was not able to resyst against the french kings puyssa^ce / which
he thought should turn to his great blame. And also the^glysshmen being in
Calys / said how they had right yuell enployed the popes money. and to say the
truth the duke of Lancaster being in England / who had by the bysshopes
journey lost his vyage in to Portyngale / was nothing sorry that the matter went
as it did. For when sir Wyllm^ Wynsore sent to the^ as they lay at ye sege /
and offered the^ new aid and comfort: the bishop / sir Thom^s Tryuet / and
sir Wyllm^ helmon / answered and said. how they had men ynowe and would have no
mo to fight with the french king / and all the might of France. But sir Hugh
Caurell / who had seen more of such matters than all the other / spoke always to
the contrary. For he said to ye bishop and to the other / when thoffre was made
the^ out of England for more aid. What will ye do? sirs / ye will trust to
much in your own puyssaunce. Why should we refuce the confort of our company
/ when it is offered to us? and the realm of England would we had it:
paraduenture a day may fall / that we shall repent it. But his words could
not be herd / but ever they said they had men ynowe. So thus the matter went so
that at length they lost more than they wan.

When sir Hughe Caurell was withdrawn to Bergues / he found there with the
English archers / mo than four thousand. Than sir Hughe said. Let us keep
this town it is strong enough / and we are people ynowe to keep it. I think
within five or six days / we shall have confort out of England / for they of
England know by this time / what case we be in. And every man said they were
content. Than they ordered the town and their company / and set every man to
his defense to keep the walls and the gates. they caused all the women and
children to draw in to a church / and not to dparte thens. The french king
being at Raynombergues / understood how the englysshemen were withdrawn in to
the town of Bergues. Than he took counsel and it was determined to go thither
/ and that the constable and marshall should go first / and lie in a wynge on
the farthersyde of the town. And than the king / the duke of Berrey / the duke
of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone / and their companyes should follow. And than
the earl of Bloyes and the earl of Ewe and the reregarde should go on another
wynge of the town / and so close the Englysshmen round about. This purpose
was holden. The king departed fro Raynombergues / and all his people ordered in
the field. It was great beauty to behold shynynge against the son: to
ba(...)s / penons and clear bassnettes and so great nombre of people that the
eye of man could not nombre the^. their spears seemed a great thick wode. Thus
they rode in four batayls toward Bergues: and about the hour of three / an
heraude of England entered in to the town / and he had passed through the
french army by sufferaunce. He came to sir Hughe Caurell / and sir Hughe
demanded of him a high that every man herd him. heraude fro whens comyst
thou? Sir quod the heraude I come fro the french host / where I have seen the
most fairest sight of men of arms / and the greattest no^bre that ever I
saw. I trow there is no king can assemble so many to guyder again. These
goodly men of arms quod sir Hughe / what nombre do thou call them of? ser
quod he / they are well.xxvi. thousand men of arms / the most goodlyest men
and best armed that can be devised. Ah quod sir Hugh Caurell who was sore
displeased with those words: y^ art well made to forge a gretlye / I know
well thou lie falsely. For I have often seen the asse^blies of France / but
they were never yet found togider.xxvi. thousand / nor yet scant six. M. of
good men of arms. Therewith the watchman of the town so wned his trumpet / for
the kings vowarde was coming to pass by ye town walls. Than sir Hughe said
/ to such knights and squyers as were about him. let us go and se these xxvi.
thousand me^ of arms / they are coming I here by our watchman. So than they
went to the walls and leaned out and beheld ye kings vowarde / passing
forby the town / in the which ward there were.xv. C. spears. The constable
and the marshals / the master of ye crosbowes the lord Coucy and after them
the duke of Bretayne / therle of Flanders / and therle of^a^^ Poule / and with
them about a.xv. C. spears. Than sir Hugh Caurell / wenyng to have seen the
hole army of France said. behold if I said true or uat. yonder ye may se
the.xxvi. M. men of arms / if they be three. M. they be.x. M. Let us go to
dinner / for as yet I have not seen no no^bre that should cause us to leave the
town / this heraude would abasshe us well if we would believe him. the heraude
was a shamed / but yet he said. sir / ye have seen as yet no more but ye
vowarde. The king and his uncles are as yet behind and all their puyssaunce.
And behind the^ is the reregarde / where as there is mo than two thousand
spears. and sir / all this shall yese With in this four hours / if ye will tarry
to se it. Sir Hugh Caurell made no force at his words / but went to his
lodging and said. I have seen all together and so sat down to his dinner (...)
and as he sat the watch began again to blow as sore as he could. Than sir
Hugh rose fro the table and went to the walls to se what is was. There he saw
coming the king and his uncles and duke Fre deryke / the duke of Lorayne /
therle of Sauoy the dolphyn of Auuergne / the earl of March and there
co^panyes. In this great battle there was well a.xvi. M. spears. than sir Hugh
Caurell thought himself desceyued and said: the heralde said truly / I was in
the wrong to blame him. let us go hens lepe upon our horses. let us save our
bodies and our goods / it is not good here to abide. I never saw so much
before of the state of France. I never saw so many men together before / as I
se yonder in the vowarde and myddell ward. and yet I am sure there is a
reregarde behind. Than he deperted fro the walls and went to his logyng. and
so they trussed all their baggages and mounted on their horses without making of
any noise. and opyned the gate toward Burbourke and so deperted / and led
with the^ all their pyllage. but if the frenchmen had taken good head / they
might have been before the^ / but they knew it not of a long time / they were
first nere at Burborke. sir Hugh Caurell right sore dyspleased / turned his
horse and tarried till his company were come together: and than he said to sir
Thom^s Tryuet and to other y^ were present. Sirs / by my faith we have made
this season a shameful journey / there issued out of England never a more
unhappy army. ye have wrought at your pleasur / and have believed the
bishop of Norwiche / who thought to have flyen or he had wings. Now we may
se ye honorable end that we must abide. All this viage my words might not be
believed / what soever I said. yonder now we may se Burbur^ if any of you will
go thither ye may / but as for me I will go to Grauelynge and so to Calais / for
I se well we be not men suffycient to fight with the army of France. Some of
the English knights / who knew right well that he said truth / answered
and said. Sir a goddess name / we will go to Bourbourke and abide there /
such adventure as god will send us. And so sir Hughe Caurell departed fro
the^ and they entered into Burbourcke.

THe french king was anon certifyed that thenglysshmen were departed our of
Bergues and gone to Bourborke / and left Bergues clean void. Than the gates
of the town were set opyn and the king entered / and all such as would. The
first that entered found great pyllage / which the Englysshmen could not carry
away. The ladies of the town were saved and sent to saint Omers / but the men
were nere hand all slain. And so the town of Bergues was set a fire / and
the king departed because of the fire / and went and lodged in a vyllage
thereby. This was on a friday / and the lords lodged abroad in the feldes / as
well as they might: they were happy the season was so fair and dry / for if it
had been cold and were / they should full yuell agone any farther to get any
forage. It was marueyle how the forage was get for so many horse / for there
were mo than three hundred thousand. It was great wonder how such an host
might be vitayled: but the saturday when they came before Bourborke / they
determined to close in all the englisshmen and to assail the town / in trust
to win it. specially the bretons had great desire to assail ye town / for the
great pyllage that they trusted to find therein.

How the french king withal his host came to Burborke / and of the order of
the englysshmen within the town: and how Fraunces Atreman wan And warpe. Cap.
iiii. C.xxxix.
ON the saturday in the morning it was right fair and clear / the host
prepared them self to come before burbourcke. The vowarde the duke of Bretayne
/ the earl of Flaunders / therle of sait Poule / the constable of France / and
three thousand spears / passed forby the walls of ye town: and tarried on the
othersyde right against the kings host / where was the most goodlyst men of
arms that could be ymagined. Thentent of the lords / was to assail ye town.
there were baners and penons wauyng wi^h the wynd and every lord with his men
under his own baner. The lords of France showed there great honor and
richesse. There was the lord of Coucy in great estate / he had coursers
trapped and barded with the au^cyent arms of coucy / and with other such as
he bare than^e. And him self on a goodly courser / ridynge in and out setting
his men in array: every man that saw him praised him for his goodly behauo^.
So there eve(...) showed their estate / there was made the(...) day mo than four
hundred knights / and the heraldes nombred ye knights that were there to a
nine. M. there were in no^bre / a.xxiiii. M. men of arms knights and squyers.
Thenglysshmen yt were in the town of Burboure and saw the french kings
puissa^ce / they hoped well to have an assaut / of the which they were right
well comforted. But in that they saw the^ self enclosed in the town / which
was closed but with palis they were not thereof well assured. Howebeit like men
of good comfort and great courage / they ordered their people about ye town. The
lord Beaumont who was an earl in England / called Henry: with a. C. men of
arms and three. C. archers / kept one ward. sir Wyllyam Helmon with as many
men kept another sir John^ of Newcastell with the gasco^s kept another / and
the lord Ferres of England kept another ward with.xl. men of arms and as
many archers / so that thus the town was set with me^ round about. sir Mathue
Reedman / ser wyllm^ Fermton / and sir Nicholas tracton with two. C. men of
arms and as many archers / kept ye place before the mynster. Also they
ordained a certain nombre of men to take heed for fire and to quench it if
need were / without disordringe of any of their wards / for thenglisshmen
douted the fire / because the town was than most part all the houses covered
with straw. thus in this estate were the englysshmen.

Now shall I show you of an high enterprese that (...) rau^ces Atreman did
the same proper friday at night * that the french king passed by Bergues /
and howhe wanne the town of And warpe.

fRaunces Atreman / Peter de Boyse / Peter de Myrt / and the capitayns of
Gaunte / when they returned fro the siege fro Ipre and came to Gaunte. They
studied night and day / how they might do any damage to their enemies. Than
Fraunces Atreman understood * how the captain of Ande warpe sir Gylbert of
Lienghien was not Wtin the town * nor no men of war / but how they were
all with the king in his army / for theerle of Flanders had send for them.
Wherefore Fraunces thought well that the town of Andewarpe was but easly kept.
and how the dikes to ward the meadows agayust them were as than dry. For
the water had been let out for the fysshe that was therein / so that one might
easily go with a dry foot to the walls of the town / and by ladders to enter
in to the town. The spies of Gaunt had brought this word to Frau^ces Atreman.
They of And warpe were as than in no fear of them of Gaunt / but in a manner
had forgoten them. when Fraunces Atreman was justly informed how it was / he
came to Peter de Boyse and said. Peter / thus in this case is the town of And
warpe at this time / I will adventure to get it / and to scale it by night.
there was never time so good as is now / for the captain there of and the men
of war / are now with the french king in the fronters of saint Omers: and
they are in fear of no body. Peter so one agreed to his purpose and said. If
ye may come to your intent / there was never man did such a deed to have
praise. I can not tell quod Fraunces what will hap / my courage is good. For
my heart gives me / that we shall have this same night And warpe. Than
Frau^ces chase out a four hundred men / in whom he had best trust: and so
departed fro Gaunte in the euenyng / and took the way to ward Andewarpe. This
was in the month of Septe^bre / when nights be of a reasonable length / and
the wether fair and clear. And so about mydnight they came to the meadows of
Ande warpe / and had scalynge ladders ready with them. And as they passed by the
maresse / there was a woman of the town gaderynge grass for her kene * she
bydde her self when she herd noise of men coming that way. She herd them
well speak / and knew well how they were gau^toyse coming toward the town
to scale it: she saw well the ladders. This woman was sore abashed / and at
last said to her self. I will go to And warpe and show all that I have herd
and seen to y^ wache men of the town. And so leyd down all her baggage /
and took a preuy way that she knew and stale to the town or the gauntoyse
ca^e there and than she called. and at last one that went on the walls fro gate
to gate / herd her and said. What art thou? I am quod she a poor woman I say
to you * herby is a certain no^bre of gau^toyse. I have seen them / they
bring with them ladders to steal this town if they can. Now I have given
you warnyng I will return / again / for if they mete with me I am but deed.
Thus the poor woman departed and the man was abashed / and thought to abide
still to se if y^ woman said truth or not. The gau^toyse who right privily
did their enterprise / made no noise nor had no trumpette / but the noise of
their langage. Than Fraunces Atreman sent four of his company on before / and
said. Go your way secretly Without any words or cough hynge to the town
walls / and harken above and beneth if ye can parceyue any thing. And so they
did / and Fraunces and his company abode still in the marisshe / and stood
still nere where as the woman was. She saw the^ well and herd what they said
/ but they saw not her. These foresaid four men went to the dykes and beheld
the walls / and saw nor herd nothing. Lo / ye mayse what yuell adventure
fell to them within: for if they had fortuned to have had but a ca^dell light /
that the gau^toyse might have seen it they durst not have come there. For than
they would have thought that there had been good watch made.

THese four men returned again to Fra^ces Atreman and said. Sir / we canse
nor here no manner of thing. I think well (...) Frau^ces. I trow the watch
has made their turn / and are now gone to their rest. Let us go this high
way toward the gate / and than enter low down in to the dykes. The poor
woman where as she lay privily herd all these words. Than she went again to
the wall and came to the man that watched there / and showed him as she did
before: and declared all y^ she had seen and herd / and counsayled him to go
to the gate to sehowe it was kept. For surely (...) she / shortly ye shall here
of the gau^toyse. I will go my way I dare no legarabyde. I have showed you all
that I have seen and herd: do now as ye list / for I will come no more this
night. And so the good poor womandeperted / and the man remembered her words
and went to the gate / where he found the watchmen playenge at dyse / and
said to them. Sirs / have ye surely closed your gates and barryers. there was
a woman ca^e right now to me and showed me thus and thus / as ye have herd
before. They answered and said: all is safe enough. In an yuell time of the
night that woman is come hyder to trouble us. It is kene and calves are broken
lose / and she weneth the noise be gau^toyse: I warrant you they have no list
to come hyder. In the mean season while they were thus talking / Fraunces
Atreman and his company were come and entered the dykes / wherein there was no
water. And there they brake down a certain of the pales before the wall / and
so rered up their ladders and entered in to the town and went straight to the
market place / without so wnynge of any noise till they came thither and there
they found a knight called sir John^ Florence of Hulle / who was lyeutenant
under the captain of the town. And he kept there the standing watch with
a.xxx. men in harness with him. And as soon as the gauntoise were entered in
to the place / they cried Gaunt Gaunt and struck at the watch: and the said
knight was slain and all his company. Thus the town of And warpe was taken.

How they of And warpe were put out of the town / and none abode there but
gauntoyse. And how Amergot Marsell took the castle of Marquell in Auuerne:
and how it was given up by co^posycion for five thousand frankes / to the
earl Dolphyn of Auuergne. Cap. C C C C.xl.
Such as were a sleep in their beds in Ande warpe / were sore abashed when
they herd that cry / and saw their town taken and could not remedy it. For the
gau^toyse brake up their houses byforce / and slew them without any defense
making / they were taken so suddenly / wherefore there was no recovery / therefore
every man saved him self y^ might best. The men fled out of their houses all
naked and lept over the walls / and left all behind them / and waded through
the dykes and waters about the town. The rich men bare nothing away with the^
/ for they were happy that might save the^ self a live. There was the same
night a great nombre slain in the town / and drowned in the dykes and waters.
Thus it for tuned of this adventure. And in the moruynge when the gauntoyse
saw how they were lords of the town / than they put all women and children
out of the town naked / in their shertes and smockes / or in the worst tayment
they had and so they went to Tourney. and such as were escaped some went to
Mount to Achacondent to Ualencennes / and to Tourney. Tidings came to many
places how And warpe was taken / whereof they of Gaunt were greatly reioysed
and said / how Fraunces Atreman had achyued a great and an high enterprise /
which ought to turn to his great valur and praise. Thus Fraunces Atreman
abode captain of And warpe / and wanne there great riches and great prouisyon
/ which came well to point for the town of Gaunt: as whete / otes / and wine
the which they of the town had gadered together out of France / Flaunders /
and Turney. But all that was of Heynalte was saved / they took nothing thereof
but that they paid for.

In y^ same season there fell nere such a like adventure in Auuergne / where as
englysshmen held diverse castles / marchyng on the land of the earl Dolphyn /
and of the bishop of saint Fleure and of Cleremont. And because they that were
there in garyson / knew well how all the country was void of men of war /
and how that the lords and knights thereof / or at leest: most part of them
were with the king in his voyage in Flaunders. Therefore they thought they would
assay to steal and to scale some town or fortress. And so it happed that
Amargot Marsell captain of Aloyse a right strong castle within a mile of
saint Fleure / took a.xxx. of his company / and rode covertly toward the land
of therle Dolphyn. And his intent / was to assay to take by stelthe y^ castle
of Marquell whereby the earl Dolphyn bears his arms. and so he came thither
through the wodes / and tarried in a little wood nere to the castle till the
son went down / and that all the beestes and men of the castle were entered
in. and in the mean season that the captain called Grandon Buyssell satte at
supper. The Englysshmen ready apparelled to do their en^prise / dressed up their
ladders and entered into the castle at their ease. They of the castle were
walkyng beneth in the court / and when they saw their enemies on the walls /
they cried treason treason. and when the captain herd that / he thought
there was no remedy but to save him self by a preuy way that he knew / which
went out of his chamber in to the great tower / which was chief defense of
all the castle. He drew thither and took the keys with him and closed him
self in ye tower while that Amergotte intended to other things. And when they
saw yt the captain was escaped in to the tower / which was to strong to be
won by them. Than they said they had done nothing / and repented the^ that
they were entered / for they were enclosed within the castle and could not get
out again at the gate. than Amergotte went to the tower to speak with the
captain / and said to him. Grandon deliver me the keys of the gate of the
castle / and I promise the / we shall depart hens without doing of any more
hurt. No quod Grandon / but ye will led away my catell / wherein I have great
trust Give me thy hand quod Amergot / and I shall swear to the by my faith /
that thou shall have no damage. Than the folysshe captain put out his hand
at a little wyndowe / to thentent that he should swear to him. And as soon as
Amergotte had his hand in his / he drew it to him and streyned him sore: and
drew out his dagger and swear / that without he would deliver all the keys to
him / he would nail fast his hand to the gate. When Grandon saw himself in
that case he was sore abashed / and not without a cause. For he saw well
that Amergot would nail fast his hand to the gate / without he delivered the
keys. and so he delivered them with the other hand / for they were nere him.
Now quod Amergotte to his company have I natte well disceyued this fool / I
shall learn well such deeds. Than^e they opyned the tower and so were masters
thereof / and put the captain and all they that were within clean out / and
did them no more hurt of their bodies.

Tidings came to the earl Dolphyns wife / who lay in a castle in a good
town called zaydes / but a little mile thens / how the castle of Marquell
was taken by the Englysshmen. The lady was sore abashed / because her lord
was not in the country. She send to the knights and squyers of the country to
come to aid her to co^quere again the castle. Knights and squyers came
anon to the lady and laid siege to the castle / but the englysshmen made no
force thereof / and so held it fyftene days. Than^e the lady fell in treaty
with them and a composycion was taken. And so Amergot departed and had five
thousand frankes / and than returned to his own gary sone again. In
likewise they of Caluylcell / whereof Peter de Brenoise was captain / and did
much hurt about Auuergne and Lymosyn. The Englysshmen the same time held in
the fronters and lymyties of Auuergne / of Quercy / and of Lymosyn / mo than
threscore strong castles: so that they might go and come fro forteresse to
fortress / till they came to Burdeux. And the fortres that did most hurt was
Ua^tatoure / one of the stro^gest castles of the world and chief captain
thereof was a bretone / called Geffray Testenoyre. this was a cruel man and had
pytie of no man / for as soon he would put to death a knight or a squire as a
vyllayne for he set by no body. He was so feared of his men / that none durst
displease him. He had with him a four hundred companyons in his wages / and
well and truly he paid them fro month to month. He held the country about
him in peace and in subiectyon / none durst ride in his country he was so
feared and douted. he had all manner of purueyaunce about him. No man of the
world could have better: as clothe of Brusels and of Normandy / of peltre ware
and of mercery / and of all other things necessary: he sold it to his people
and abated it on their wages. also he had to sell all prouisyon as iron /
steel: leddar / spyce / and of all other things / as plentyfull: as though
it had been at Paris. And sometime he moved war as well to the Englysshmen
as to the frenchmen / to the intent to be the more redouted. The Castle of
Uantatour was ever purueyed of all things to abide a Siege / and it should
endure seuyn year. Now let us return to the business of Flaunders.

How the french King assailed Burbourke / and how he ordained that who
soever brought thither a fagotte should have a blanke. Cap. CCCC.xli.
THe saturday as is said before / the french king ca^e before Burbourke. There
was never seen a goodlyer army / and every man ready apparelled to assaut the
town / with great courage and will. And they said / the town should not long
endure against them / how be it first it cost the^ many of their men. Some had
great marvel why they went not inco^tynent to the saut. some said again /
that the duke of Bretayne and the earl of Flanders / who were on the farther
side of the town / were in trea^^e with the Englysshmen to yield up the town
without any assaut. The bretons / burgonyo^s / normayns / almayns and other
people / who thought surely that within the town was great pyllage and protyte
for them / if they might win the town byforce. Wherefore they were sore
displeased y^ they went not straight ways to the assaute. Some scrymysshed at
the barryers without any commandment or ordinance of the constable or
marshalles. The matter multiplied in such wise / that the frenchemen shot
fire in to the town / so that there was fire in mo than in.xl. places / so
that they might se the flame and smoke in every part of the host. Than
began^e the cry and assaut / and there was in the formast front / sir Wyllyam
of Namure and his company / who valyantly did assail. There was done many a
feate of arms. The assayla^tes with great courage and will entered in to the
dykes / some to the knees in water and mire / and came and shot and fought at
the pales with thenglysshmen / who defended them self as well as any men
might do / and it was need for them so to do. They within had so much to do /
that they wyste not well what to do. They were assailed on every side / and
still brent the houses of the town / which abashed the englyssmen most of
any thing. But for all that they went not fro their wards / but abode still at
their defenses. And sir Mathue Reedman and sir Nycholas Traicton / and such as
were stablysshed in the town. They did as much as they might to quench the
fire / but the wether was so fair and the season so dry / that the houses
flamed. And for certain / if the assaute had begonsoner the same saturday /
and that the night had not so soon come / they had won the town by assaut
/ but it behooved them to cease the assaut / because of the night. Of sir
Wyllyam Namures company there were a.xxxvi. sore hurt and slain / and of them
of the host. as the heraldes reported / there were slain and hurt mo than
five hundred. Than ceased the assaut because of the night / and the frenchmen
drew to their lodgings / and intended to their hurt people / and to bury the
deed. And it was said in ye host / that the next day in the morning / they
would new again assaut the town. Saying surely / how they would win it /
and that it should not endure against them. The englysshmen all that night
intended to repair their pales which were broken / and to quench the fire in
the town. So they saw them self all things considered in a hard case / for
they saw well they were closed in round about / so that they could in no wise
fly out.

aNd on the sunday in the morning after the king had herd mass. There was a
cry made in the host / that who soever brought a faggot before the kings tent
/ he should have a blanke of France / and as many fagottes as many blankes. To
thentent to cast in to the dykes for men to pass to the pales / and on the
monday to give assaute. Than there was good making of fagottes / and bringynge
of them before the kings tent / so that within a while there was a great
stacke of the^. So thus they drove of the sunday without any assaut. And some
said the same sunday / that the duke of Bretayne / who was on the farther side
of the town / fell in treaty with the^glysshemen / for they saw well what
case they were in. He counsayled them to yield up the town / saving their
bodies and goods / to the which counsel they were glad to follow. And
desired the duke for gods sake and gentylnesse that he would help to make a
treaty for them: and for that cause the sunday / the duke send to the king
and to his uncles / to his counsel / to the constable / and to therle of
saint Poule / that they should help to make this treaty. And to counsel the
king to take the fortress as they were offered. For as to assail them it
should cost the king much of his people / and as for Bourbourke it would be
hard to win. For therein were a few poor men of war / that would
defend themself to the death. The king and his uncles / because the duke of
Bretayne spoke for them: said he would here their treaty with a good will. So
thus the sunday passed all in peace / and as it was said: in the euenyng on
assurance. Johan of Newcastell Gascone and Raymonette of saint Mark / came to
the lodging of sir Guy dela Tremoyle to sport them / and tarried there all
night / and on the mo^day in the morning they returned to Bourburke / and at
their departure sir Guy said to them. Sirs: or it be night ye shall be my
prisoners. Sir quod they / we had rather be yours than a poorer knights. The
same euenyng tidings came to the host how And warp was taken by stelthe /
wherewith the captain thereof was sore displeased because he was there / the
which was loss of the town: but he was excused because the earl of Flaunders
had send for him. The same sunday at night the earl Blois kept the watch /
wenynge to assail the town in the morning.

oN the monday in the morning there was a cry made / that no man should be so
hardy to make any assaute to the town / till they were commanded. When this
cry was publysshed through the host / every man ceased. And some ymagined
that the Englisshmen should depart by some treaty / sith they were
commanded not to assail the town And at noone there issued out of the town
/ such as should comune for the treaty. Sir Wyllyam Helman / sir Thomas
Tryuette / sir Nicholas Traicton / sir Mathue Reedman / and to the nombre
of.xiiii. knights and squyers. And the duke of Bretayne / the constable of
France / and the earl of saint Poule brought them in to the kings tent. The
king was glad to se them / for as than he had seen but a few Englisshmen
except sir Peter Courtney / who had been before at Paris to do deeds of arms
with sir Guy de la Tr^moyle: but the same time the king and his counsel
agreed them so / that they fought not toguyder. And because that in time passed
great renome and brute ran / how that the Englysshmen were valyant in arms.
Therefore the young king was glad to se the^ and their treaty aueyled much
the better. Thus this monday they were in the kings tent. and with the king
there was the duke of Berry / the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone / the
duke of Bretaygne / the earl of Flaunders / and the constable of France and no
mo. The duke of Bretayne took great pain in this treaty. so at last they
concluded / that they should depart fro Burbourke and leave the town of
Grauelynge / and to take with them as much as they could carry of their own.
of this treaty diverse bretons / frenchmen / normayns / and burgonyous were
sore displeased. for they had hoped to have had part of their goods / but
they failed of their ente^tes / for the king would have it thus / as is said
before. After this treaty these knights took leave of the king and of his
uncles / of the duke of Bretayne / of the earl of Flaunders / and of the
constable. Than therle of saint Poule took and had them to supper in his
lodging and made them right good there * and after supper he conveyed them to
the gates of the town whereof they thanked him greatly.

Of the miracles that were done in the town of Burbourke. and how sir Thomas
Trivet and sir Wylliam Helman englysshmen were put in prisone for the damage
of France. Cap. CCCC.xlii.
THe tuisday all the day they ordered all their business and shodde their
horses and stuffed their males / whereof they had great plenty. The wednisday
in the morning they trussed and took their way / and passed by saueconduct
thorough the kings host. The breto^s were sore displeased / when they saw
them depart with such baggage / and such as abode behind did hurt enough.
Thus the englysshmen departed and went to Grauelyng and there rested / and on
the thursday in the morning they departed and set fire in the town / and brent
it clean up. And so came to Calais and all their pyllage / and there tarried for
the wind to have passed to return into England. The thursday in the morning
/ the french king entered in to Burburke and all the lords and there companyes.
Than the bretons began to pyll and rob the town / and left nothing in the
town nor in the church of saint Johans. In the which church a vyllayne
among other lept upon the auter / and would have taken away a stone out of
acrowne on the heed of an image of our lady: but the image turned away fro
him. This was a true thing: and the vyllayne fell fro the auter and dyed a
shameful death. Many men saw this miracle: and after that there came another
that would have done the same: but than all the belles in the church rang
without any help of man's hands / nor also they could not be ronge / for the
ropes were tied up a lofte. For these miracles the church was much visyted of
all ye people. And the king gave to the same image of our lady a great gift /
and so did all the lords. The same day there was offered and given well to the
valor of three thousand fra^kes. the next day they dislodged. The king gave
leave to every man to depart / and the king thanked the^ that were of far
countries / and specially the duke of Bauyer / because he was come to serve him
so far of: and also the earl of Sauoy. so thus every lord drew to their
own / and than the king returned / but the duke of Burgoyne tarried a little
behind with the earl of Flaunders / to set his business in good order / and
tarried at saint Omers. The lord of Coucy / nor mayns and diverse other knights
and squiers of Poictou / of Uymewe / and of Picardy / entered in to Grauelynge
when the Englysshmen had left it. And new repaired it / and made it a country
garyson against Calays. And little and little peopled again the country of
Furneys / of Do^kyrke / of Disqueme / and of Newporte / the which was all lost
before: but than they conquered it new again.

yE may know well / that ye duke of Lancaster was nothing dyspleased / that
the bishop of Norwyches army spedde no better than it did. For by reason
of that army / he lost his viage into Spain and Portyngale. And when these
english knights were returned in to England / they were sore taken up with
the comens. They said to them / how they had right yuell quyted themself in
their vyage / when they had so fair a beginning in Flanders / and conquered
not the hole country: and specially sir Thomas Tryuet and sir Wyllm^ Helman
were most blamed. As for sir Hughe Caurell there was no fault laid to his
charge / another by the king nor his counsel nor by the commons. For it was
well known / y^ if his counsel might have been believed / they had spedde
better than they did to their honores. And so it was laid to the two other
knights / how they had sold Burborke and Grauelynge to the french king / so
that all the realm was sore moved against the^ / so that they were in parell
of their lives. And they were commanded by the king in to prison to the tower
of London. And while they were in prison the commons apeased / and when they
were delivered out of prison / they were bound to the king to be at his will
and pleasure. Than there was put forth a treaty to be had between the
englysshmen and frenchmen. And they of Gau^t were comprised in the treaty /
wherewith therle of Flaunders was sore displeased / how be it he could not
amend it.

At the depertynge out of Burborke / the duke of Bretayne abode still at saint
Omers with the earl of Flanders his cosyn. And would gladlye have seen that a
good peace or a long truse might have been had / between the french king his
natural lord / and the king of England. And to set forward the matter / the
mo^day wha^ the englisshmen were with the king in his tent he moved the matter
to some of them. And they promised him / that as soon as they ca^e in England
to the king they would speak to him / to his uncles and to his counsel of
that matter. and so after to show that he was wyllyng to bring the matter to a
good end. He sent in to England two knights of his own good assurance / as
the lord of Housey / and the lord of Maylly. And they did so much that the
duke of Lancaster and the earl of Buckyngham his brother / the bishop of
Suffolk / sir Johan of Hollande brother to the king / sir Thomas Percy / and
other of the kings counsel should come to Calays / having full puyssaunce
and authoryte of the king and of ye realm to make peace or to ordain a treuse
at their pleasure. And on the other part there should come to Boloyne / the
duke of Berry / the duke of Burgoyne / the bishop of Laon / and the
chau^celer of France. Having also full authorite fro the french king his
counsel and realm / to take peace with the englysshmen / or to take truse
such as they could agree upon. and so when all these perties were come to Calys
and to Boloyne / they tarried a little or they met for the counsel of Spaygne
that should come thither / for the frenchemen would make no treaty without the
spanyerdes were enclosed therein. Finally there ca^e fro the king of Spain a
bishop / a dyacre and two knights. Than it was aduysed by all the parties /
because they thought it no surety for the frenchemen to come to Calais / nor
the englysshmen to come to Boloyne. Therefore it was ordained / that there
comunyng should be in the mydway between the said towns / in a little
vyllage: where there was a church called Abolyng. thither came all these parties
/ and diverse days there they met. And there was the duke of Bretayne and
theerle of Flaunders. And there in y^ field was pyght up the great tent of
Bruges. and the earl of Flau^des made a dinner in the same tent / to the duke of
Lancastre / to therle of Buckyng ham / and to the other lords of England /
there was great estate holden on both parties. but all things co^sydred / they
could find no means to have a peace: for the frenchmen would have had again
Guynes / Calays / and all the fortresses that thenglysshmen held on that side
of the sea to the river of Garon: as well in normandy / Bretayne / Poictou /
Xaynton / as in Rochell to the which thenglysshmen would in no wise agree / and
specially Guynes / Calys / Chierburge / nor Breast in Bretayne. They were
comunyng on this treaty more than three wekes / every day the lords or else some
of their counsel.

The same season there dyed in the duchy of Lusenburgh and in the town of
Lusenburgh / the gentle and ioly duke Uincelyns of Boem / duke of Lusenburgh
and of Braba^t. Who had been in his time: fresshe / sage / amorous / and hardy.
And when he dyed / it was said: yt the most high prince and grettest lynage
and most noble of blood was deed / god have his soul. And he was buried in y^
abbey of Uauclere / beside Luze^burgh. And my lady Jane duches of Brabant / was
as than wydowe and never after was married. Of the death of this noble duke /
such as knew him were right sorry.

How the lords of England and France were assembled together / to make a
peace: which by them could not be done. And how Loyes earl of Flaunders dyed
and of his obsequy. Cap. CCCC.xliii.
NO we let us return to their assemble / that was between thenglisshe lords
and the french / between Calays and Boloyne. Which treaty could never come to
none effect of peace / nor profit for the one party nor other. Some said / ye
earl of Flanders was in a great defaut thereof / for he would in no wise have
the^ of Gaunt comprised in any treaty / wherewith thenglysshmen were displeased
/ wherefore the treaty spedde the worse. For there was great promise made / that
no peace should be made without the gau^toyse were comprised therein. This they
had sworn at Calays / therefore this brake the treaty: finally there could be
made no peace / that should seem good to any of the perties. than they fell to
treat for a truse / and thereupon their treaty proceeded. Therle of Flanders
would gladly that they of Gaunt should have been out of the truse / but the
englysshmen would in no wise consent thereto / but that Gaunt should be
comprised in the truse. And that every party should sit still with that he
has / and no party to re^dre up any fortress to other. and for all that this
treaty was thus between Calays and Boloyne / the gauntoyse of the garyson of
And warpe / came and brent the subbarbes of Tourney / and returned sauely
again to And warpe. and in the feast of Christmas the gauntoyse gadered up the
rentes / parteyning to the lord of Tourney / wherewith he was right sore
displeased / and swear a great oath that whatsoever treaty was made between
fla^ders end the gauntoyse / he would never ente^de to no peace / but always
to make the^ the grettest war that he could. For he said / they took fro him
his heritage. Wherefore he wyste natte how to live / without his friends of
Brabant and Heynalt had aided him: the gau^toyse had so distroyed his heritage.

These treaties that were thus between Boloyne and Calys / between the lords
of England and of France was concluded with much a do that a truse should be
had between the french king and the king of England / and all their
adherentes and alyes. That is to say: on the french kings part / all Spain
/ Galyce / and Castle and all in the^ enclosed / as well by water as by land
/ and also the realm of / Scotland. And the french king as soon as he may /
to signify this truse to the king of Scotts and to the barons of Scotland /
and they that should go on that message / to have save conduct to go and come
through the realm of England. Also on thenglysshe part / there was comprised
all his adhere^tes and alyes / in whatsoever pertie they were in. And they of
Gaunt were expressly named and enclosed in this truse / whereof therle of
Flaunders was sore displeased. And this truse to endur to the feast of saint
Michell / in the year of or lord god. M. CCC.lxxxiiii. and than these parties
to return again to the same place / or else other for them: having full
puyssaunce to apease the said realms. Of all these things there were letters
autentyke and instrum^tes publykes written and sealed to hold and acco^plysshe
this truse and poyntment. The lords swear not to break it in no point. Thus
this counsel brake up / the frenchmen returned in to France / and
thenglysshmen to Calys: the duke of Bretayne returned than into his own
country / and therle of Flanders to saint Omers / and there a sickness took
him whereof he dyed. And it was ordained that he should be entered in the church
of our lady in Lysle. This earl of Flaunders dyed ye year of our lord. M.

How the earl of Northu^berlande the earl of Notyngham / and the Englysshmen
made a journey in to Scotland. And of the ambassadors of France that were
send in to Scotland / to notify the truse that was taken between England and
France. Cap. CCCC.xliiii.
LE have well herd here before: how the lords of France wha^ they made the
truse with englysshmen. They were charged at their deperting to signify ye
truse to the^ of Scotland: to the intent that no hurt should be done between
the^ of England nor Scotland. How be it to say the truth: thy of France
did not their dilygence in that matter: as they ought to have done: for they
should have send incontinent but they did not. I think the let thereof was
because of the great business that the duke of Burgoyne had for ye obsequy of
his father in law therle of Flaunders: as ye have herd here before. Also they
thought full little that the englysshmen would have done as they did / for
anon after Ester the earl of Northu^berlande / the earl of Notyngham and the
barons of the north country / made an army of two thousand spears and six
thousand archers / and passed by Rosebourge and entered in to Scotland / and
began to brinne the country and the land of therle Duglas and of the lord of
Lynsey / and left nothing vnbrent to Edenborowe: The lords and knights of
Scotland was nothing ware of this journey / and took the matter in great
dispyte: saying / how they would amend it to their powers. For they said as
they herd reported / they should have had truse with the englysshmen. How be
it they were not warned thereof / wherefore they knew well the war was opyn. ye
wotte well tidings will sprede anon abroad / whereby it was shortly known in
Flaunders and specially at Scluse / by marchantes that ca^e out of the realm
of Scotla^de. How thenglysshmen were entered in to Scotland / and how that
king Robert of Scotland and the lords of the realm / did somon their
people to assemble to fight with thenglysshmen. Also it was known in France
that the englysshmen were in the field / and the scotts also: and that in
short time they were likely to mete The dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne and the
counsel of France / when they understood these tidings / they said they had
folysshly done / in that they had not send word of the treuse in to Scotland
be times / as they had promised to do. Than was it ordained that sir Hamart de
Marse should go in to Scotland / who was a sage and a discrete knight / sir
Peter Framell / and a sergiant of arms / who was of the nacyon of the scotts
/ called Janequyn Cha^penoyse. He went because he knew the la^gage and the
country.

In the mean season y^ these ambassadors ordained them self to go in to
Scotland / the englysshmen over ran the country of Scotla^de. there was the
same time at Scluse men of war of France / that lay still and slept and wist
not what to do: for the truse between England and fla^ders still endured. And
they herd how the^glysshemen and scotts made war each with other / and it
was said at Scluse for certain / that hastily there should be battle between
the^ / There was sir Geffray of Charney / sir John^ of Plasy / sir Hughe of
Boloyne / sir Sayng of Uyllers / sir Garnere of leborne / sir Garnere of
Gussa^guyn / sir Oden of Metyn / sir Robert of Ca^pyhen / Jakes of mou^tfort /
John^ of heluyn / John^ of Melles / Michell dela bare / and Gyllam Gobert /
they were a.xxx. men of arms knights and squyers. They made promise together
to go and adventure their bodies. and they wist not where better to enploy their
season / than in ye realm of Scotla^de. and so they deperted fro scluse and
took a ship and left their horses behind the^ / for danger of the sea / and
for the long journey. the maryners knew well they could not arryue at the haue^
of Ede^borowe / at Do^bare / nor at non of those hauyns nere / for thenglisshe
army was as well by see as by land. And the englysshmen were lords and
masters of the first ports of scotland / because their prouisyon might
follow the^ by see. In this season the french ambassadors ca^e in to England
to go to Scotland / and the king and his uncles made them great chere and the
first day somewhat dissimuled with the^ to delay the time / because their men
were making war in Scotland. and when they understood that their men had
done their enterprise / and that they returned again in to England. Than
they let the french ambassadors depart / and gave them saueconduct to pass
through the realm in to Scotland / and made towns and castles to be opyned
against their coming. So they departed and went toward Scotland.

So long these men of war that went fro Scluse sailed by the sea / costyng
Hola^de and En glande / eschewyng the perels of thes^e / for encou^tryng of
the^glysshmen / that at last they aryued in Scotla^de at a little port called
Mo^stres. and when the scotts that dwelt in the town knew how they were
frenchemen / that were come to exercise deeds of arms / they made them good
chere / and did help to get them all that they neded. And when these knights
and squyers had refresshed them there two days / and had learned tidings. They
d^perted and rode on hakeneis and ca^e to Dondem / and so fro thens to saint
Johans a good town in Scotland / on the river of Tare / and there is a good
haven to sail whyder a man will. And when they were come thither / they
understood how the englysshmen were withdrawn / and how the king of scotts
and his lords were at Ede^borowe at a counsel. Than they ordained that sir
Garnyer of Cuissangyn and Mychaell de la Bare / should go to Edenborowe to
speak with the king and his counsel / to know what they should do. at leest
to show them the good will that they had to come out of Flanders in to
Scotland. And sir Geffray de Charney and the other / would abide there till
they had word again. And as they ordained so it was done / and so they
departed and went to Ede^borowe where the king was / and therle Duglas called
James / for his father Wyllyam was newly disceased. There was also the earl of
Moret / therle of Orkeney / the lord of Uersey / the lord of Lynde / y^ lord
of Surlant / and six brethren of therle of Orkenes all knights. These lords
of Scotla^de made good cher to the knights of France. than sir Garnyer showed
to the king and to the barons of Scotland / thentencyon of his companions and
the cause of their coming in to the realm. Than the ambassadors of France
ca^e thither / sir Hemart de Percy / ser Peter Framell and Janequyn Cha^penoise
/ and they brought the truse that was devised between France and England / but
the scotteshelde against it and said / how they came to late. and y^ they
would have no truse / because the^glysshmen in that season had done them much
hurt. And thus while the king and the knights were at difference / the earl
Duglas and therle Moret / the children of Lindsey and diverse other knights and
squiers of Scotland / desyringe to be armed: held a secret counsel together
in the church of Ede^borowe / and the knights of France were sent for to
the^. As sir Michaell de la bare and sir Garnyer. Desyring them to go to their
co^panyons and to show the^ their intent / and to keep their purpose secret.
So these two knights returned to saint Johans town / and showed their company
all that they had herd and seen.

How the barons and knights of Scotland and they of France made apoyntment
to enter in to the realm of England / without the knowledge of the king of
Scotts / who was at Edenborowe. Cap. CCCC.xlv.
OF these tidinges sir Geffray de Charney and the other knights and squiers
greatly reioysed / and so deperted thens and came to Edenborowe / and made no
knowledge of that they should do. They had not been there two days / but that
the earl Duglas send for them to come to his castle of Alquest / and sent to
them horses / and so they came to him the next day. And incontinent he brought
them to a certain place / where the scotts assembled. and so in three days /
they were mo than.xv. thousand a horse back / armed after y^ usage of their
country. Than they said they would make a journey in to England / and reueng
their hurtes and domages that had been done to the^. So they went forth and
passed forestes and woods of their country / and entered in to Northu^berlande
into the land of the lord Percy / and there they began to brinne / to rob /
and to steal. And than returned by the land of therle of Notynghm^ and the
lord Moubray / and did there much hurt and passed by Rosebourg*. But they
tarried not there / because they had great pyllage with the^ as well of prisoners
as of catell. And so returned without danger in to their country again for
the Englysshmen were all withdrawn and could not so soon again assemble
toguyder to fight with the scotts. Therefore it behooved them to bear that
brunt / for they had given be fore such another to the scotts.

Of this journey the king of scotts might right well excuse him self / for
of the assemble nor of their departing he knew nothing / and though he had
known thereof / he could natte have let it / when they were ones onwarde. For
all these journeys y^ was thus made / both in to Scotland and in to England /
there abode still with king Robert / sir Hamarde de marse and sir Pe^ framell /
because they would be laid in no faut to break the truse that was taken /
between England / France / and Castle. The king of Scotts and the
ambassadors of France send an heraude of arms in to England. and when he
was come before the king of England and his uncles / he found the country
sore moved to ride again in to Scotland. The duke of Lancastre and the earl
of Ca^bridge / who desired greatly in that year to go in to Portyngale and in
to Castle / or else one of them with a great puyssaunce of men of arms. For
they held the^ self heryters thereof by right of their wives children of
Castle. To renew the war between the king of Portyngale and y^ king of
Castle / for as than king Fera^do was deed. And the portyngales had crowned
dan Johan a bastard brother a valiant man / who desired nothing but war
with the spanyerdes / so he might have alyaunce with the Englysshemen / and
their confort and aid. Therefore the duke of Lancastre did with his fre^des as
much as he might / that there should be none asse^bly to go in to Scotland.
Also it was said plainly: how the king of scotts denied the knights of
Scotland and of France / to make any rode in to England. And in that they
did the contrary was against his will or knowledge.

When the scottysshe heraude was come to the king of England and to his
uncles / well instructed of that he should say and do. He kneled down before
the king and required that he might be herd / as an heraude of the king of
scotts to do his message. The king was content: there he showed wherefore he was
send / singulerly fro the king and fro the ambassadors of France / in
excusing them. Saying / how the king of scotts mekely received the
messangers of the french kynkes / and always intended to keep the trewse /
both he and all his. Howbeit some of the marches of his realm: as the elre
Duglas / the earl de la Mare his uncle / sir Arche^bale / sir Rame sir Peter /
sir Wyllm^ / and sir Thom^s Duglas and all the brethren of Lyndsey / and they
of Ra^sey and sir Wyllim^ Asweton. These would never agree to the truse / saying
how the englysshmen had done in their land great hurt and damage / which was
right sore displesant to the^ and to their fre^des: and said / how they would
be revenged when they might. and when these lords assembled them together to go
in to England as they did / they never made the king nor his counsel preuy
thereof. For they knew well if they had / they would never have consented
thereto. Howbeit they say plainly in Scotland / that the first incydent and
occasyon of this war moved first by you. For they say how your grace and
your counsel knew right well / of the truse that was taken both by land
and by water. Also they say. how y^ french ambassadors whan^e they passed
this way / were let by you of their coming in to Scotland. ye drove them
forth with pleasure and solace / so that they tarried over long / whereby this
myschiefe is fallen between England and Scotland. And so under the shadow of
dissymulacyon these things are done: but my redouted sovereign lord the king
of Scotts and his counsel / and the ambassadors of France that are with
him / excuses them self and will do at all times. that this last journey that
y^ lords and knights of Scotland made into England was unknown to them /
and that they were ignorant thereof. And to address and reform all these
things and to bring them in to good estate / I am charged to say to you. That
they desire your grace to ente^de to keep and observe the truse taken beyond
the sea / by y^ high and noble discrecyon of counsel / both of the french
kings and yours. And to co^fyrme the same truse to endure y^ said term / with
my soueraygne lord the king of scotts / and he and his noble counsel to
co^fyrme the same on his part / to be vpholden and kept. And of this please it
your grace to give me answer. The king of England and his uncles well
understood the heraude: than the duke of Lancaster said / how he should be
answered. Than they made him tarry at London for his answer.

How the truse taken bitwene England and France was publisshed in England
and in Scotland. Cap. CCCC.xlvi.
AT the end of two days / the heraulde was answered by sir Simon Bulle /
chamberlayne with the king. and so y^ matter was set at a good point. For to say
the troth all things considered / the lords of England that had been
beyond the sea and took* the truse / did not honorably to consent to send
their men to over ron Scotland seeing they knew the truse was taken. the best
excuse that they could make / was: how they were not bound to send word
thereof to ye scotts / but that the frenchemen were bound thereto. So than it
was said to the heraude / that in the name of god he was welcome. And how yt
it was thentency on of the king of England / of his uncles / and of their
counsel: yt all that they had sworn and promised to do / they would in no
wise break it / but would co^fyrme it to the best of their powers. For in that
has been done to the contrary / they that had most done had most lost. Of
all this the haraulde desired to have writing to thentent he might be believed.
There was given him great gifts so that he was well content / and thanked the
king and the lords. And so departed fro London and returned in to Scotland /
where the messangers of France were still taryeng for his answer / desyring
to know how the englysshmen would do. And when it was known what answer ye
king of England and his uncles had made by their letters sealed / they were
than greatly contented and reioysed. Thus endured the trewse for a year between
England and Scotland / and was publysshed through both Realms for the more
surety. And the ambassadors of France returned in to their country / and
passed through England safely without parell. And showed the french king and
his uncles at their returnyng how they had spedde / and the lettes that they
found in their journey. And so showed all the case / as ye have herd before.

When sir Geffray de Charney and the knights and squiers of the realm of
France / such as had been in Scotland / saw that there was peace between
Enlande and Scotland. Than they took leave of the lords of Scotland / and
specially of the earl Duglas / and the Earl of Moret / who had kept them right
good company: And they of Scotland said unto them at their depertynge. Sirs /
ye have seen the manner and condycion of our cositre / how be it ye have not
seen all our puyssaunce. Know for certain / that Scotland is the land in
all the world that the Englysshmen (...) most. For we may as ye have seen /
enter in to England at our ease / and ride far in to the country without
danger of the sea: so that and if we were men ynowe / we might do them much
more hurt than we do. wherefore sirs / and ye would show this to such knights
and squyers as would auau^ce them self to get honor / and to come in to this
country to seek deeds of arms / we thike they should do a great feate. For if
we had but a thousand spears of knights and squyers of France with our
people that we have in this country / we should do such a deed in England /
that it should be spoken of.xl. year after. Sirs / we desire you remember this
when ye come in to France. They answered and said / they would not fail to do
it / for it was a matter not to be forgoten. So thus they departed and took the sea and thought to have sailed to Scluse / How be it the wind was contrary
to them whan^e they were on the sea / so that they were feign to take land in
zelande / in a town called Uorell. tha^ they thought they were in sauegarde /
but it was not so: For the Normayns but a little before had over ron the
country therabout / and done to the zelanders great damage / Wherefore these
knights and squiers of France were in great danger / for while this brute
was thus in the town / their ship was entered / their cofers broken and their
armure taken / and they all in great parell to be slain.

THe same day there was in the town a squire of the earl of Bloyes / called
Jacob Grasyns / he did help to aid the french men as much as he might. He
spoke to y^ masters of the town and did so much by his la^gage / that part
of their goods was restored again to them / and to bring the^ out of the
parell and danger that he saw they were in (for he knew well the people of
the town were sore moved against them / and were in mind to ly in wait for
them on the sea / and to execute that purpose they had warned other towns by)
the said squire showed them what danger they were in / and the country was
sore moved against them. But he said / for the love of the king and for thonour
of the realm of France / he would ordain some remedy for them. Than he went
to a maryner and hired a ship to go where as pleased him with his company:
saying / how he would sail to Dondrest. So the maryner made couynaunt with
him / and so he entered in to the ship / and all the said frenchmen with him.
And so first the maryner set his course to Donderst. Whan^e Jacob saw his time
/ than he said to the mariners. Sirs / take heed what I say. I have hired this
ship for this viage to sail whyder as me list / therefore turn yo^ sail
toward streneghen / for I will sail thither. The maryners would not agree
thereto but said. Sir / ye said ye would sail to Dondrest / and thither will we
bring you but to none other place. than Jacob said / mark well what I say. Do
as I command you / or else ye shall dye therefore / than the maryners durst no
more strive it lay not in their powers. So they turned the helm and sail /
and sailed toward the town of Streneghen / and came thither without any parell.
The town belonged to the earl of Bloyes and there they refresshed them / and
so departed at their pleasure / and returned in to their country by Brabant
and by Heynault. Jacob did the^ this service a squire of Guyes the earl of
Bloyes.

wHan^e sir Geffray of Charney and sir Johan of Blassey / and the knights and
squyers that had been in Scotland were returned in to France / they were
inquired of the tidings of Scotland. There they showed all that they had
herd and seen / and showed the minds of the barons and knights of Scotland.
Sir Johan of Uyen admyrall of France spoke with sir Geffray of Charney / and
he showed him all as ye have herd before. than the Admyrall aduysed well / and
so did other barons of France / how they might have a fair enter in to
England by Scotland / also they knew well that naturally the scotts loved
not the englysshmen. Sir Amery of Marse confyrmed the same: saying / how he
was desired of the king of Scotts and by his counsel / to show the same to
the french king and to his counsel. So thus the frenchmen had an
ymaginacyon yt the truse ones expyred / they would send a great puyssaunce in
to Scotland to wast part of England. This purpose was concluded by the duke
of Berry and the duke of Burgoyne / who had as than the gouernynge of the
realm / but they kept it secret.

How the lord of Destornay made his assemble to win again Andwarpe / and
how by his policye he wanne it. Cap. CCCC.xlvii.
WE have herd here before / how Fraunces Atremanne in the mean time while
the french king was in his journey in Flaunders / took by stelthe the town of
Andewarpe / whereof they of Tourney and of other towns therabout were sore
dismayde / for the garyson there before the truse was taken / did much damage
in the country of Turnesyn / and specially all the lands of the lord of
Destornay was in their obeysau^ce. And at the feast of Christe^mas / they
gadered up the rentes as capons / and other things in his towns / wherewith he
was sore displeased / and his servants and fre^des. He said / that whatsoever
truse or respyte of war was taken between England / France / and Flaunders:
he would in no wise keep truse with the gau^toise. For they had done him so
much hurt that he was not able to bear it / but in a manner undone thereby. So
thus this lord of Destornay did cast his aduyce to get again Andwarpe / and
atchiued his intent by the aid of some knights and squyers of France / of
Flaunders / and of Heynalte / who helped him to his purpose. yet when he send
for the^ / there were many that knew nothing what he would do. This chance
happed the.xvii. day of May. the lord of Destornay knew by his spies / that
Fraunces Atreman was as than in Gaunt and not in Andwarpe. For he trusted so on
the truse bitwene them and France / that he feared nothing / which was a
great folly. For he took not so good head to Andewarpe as he should have done:
as ye shall herafter.

The lord of Destornay made an assemble of four hundred knights and squyers
good men of arms. And so he came into the wode of Lart against the gate
toward Grauntmount right nere to the gate of Andwarpe. And with him there was
sir Johan of Molyn / sir Jakes de la Tremoyle / sir Gylbert / sir Johan
Cacq^lon / sir Roulande Despyre / sir Blaynchard de Calonne / and the lord of
Destripouylle / who was there made knight. I shall show you now the manner how
they of Andwarpe were disceyued. They took two carts laded with vitayle and
four carters in gray cotes harnessed under neth / right hardy and aduenturous
fellows. So they came and drove their Carts before Andwarpe / and showed the
watchmen how they had brought prouisyon out of Heynault to vitayle the town.
The watchemen thought nothing but good / and so let down the portcolyse.
Than the carters privily losed the horses fro the cart / the watchmen said.
sirs / why drive you not forth your carts / and the watchemen took the
forehorses by the heed and drew them forth? And so they passed in and the
carts abode still in the gate and on the bridge. Than^e the watchmen saw well
they were betrayed / and began to fight with the carters / who defended them
self right well / for they were well armed under their cotes. And so they
slew two of the watchmen / and incontinent they were rescued for the lord of
Destornay and his company pursewed fast after and entered in to the town. tha^
the watchmen fled into the town / and cried treason treason. But or the
town was raised / the me^ of arms were entered and slew all that they
encountered / that made any defense / and so cried the town is won. Thus
Andwarpe was taken again / and there were of the gauntoyse slain and drowned
a three hundred / and there was found great richesse parteyning to Fraunces
Atreman. It was said / it amou^ted to a fyftene thousand frankes.

THese t^^ynges were sone known in diverse places how Andwarpe was taken / the
truse during by the frenchmen. And specially they of Gau^t were sore displeased
therewith as it was reason / for it touched the^ right nere. Than they took
counsel together / and determined to send to the duke of Burgoyne / showing
him how in the assurau^ce of peace / Andwarpe had been taken fro him: desyring
him / y^ it might be restored again / or else y^ truse was broken. So they
send to him / but the duke excused him and said: that he meddled nothing with
that matter / and so prayed god to help the^ For he said / he knew nothing of
the lord Destornayes en^prise. but he said / he would write to him with a good
will / and so he did / commaundynge him to render again Andwarpe to the
gau^toyse. Saying / how it was not honorable to take any town / castle or
fortress / during the peace. The lord of Destornay answered to the dukes
letter / and said to the messangers. Sirs / always the garysone of Andwarpe
has made me war / both in the war season and in peace time / and has
taken fro me mine heritage / and as for me I never agreed to be at peace with
them. Thus I have taken Andwarpe by good feate of war / and I purpose to keep
it as my proper heritage / till Fla^ders and Gaunt be all one / for I have
nothing else / for all is lost by the war. So thus the matter abode / the
gau^toyse could get nothing else. Of the yuell keeping of Andwarpe Fraunces
Atreman was sore blamed / and specially of the lord of Harsels / so that there
were great and heinous words between them. Fraunces said: how he had done
better service to Gaunt / than ever he did. Their la^gage multiplied so far
that each of them belyed other / with foul words. And anon after the lord
of Harsels was slain: some said it was by the means of Fra^ces Atreman and
Peter de Boyse for envy. The same season the gau^toyse made a request to the
king of England * to have some noble man of his blood to be gouernoure of
Gaunt. So the king and his counsel send to Gaunt a valyant knight and right
sage / to have the gouernyng of Gaunt / he was called sir Johan Bourchyer / he
had the gouernynge of Gaunte more than a year and an half.

How the duke of Aniou dyed in a castle beside Naples / and how the queen of
Cicyle was counsayled to go to the pope. Cap. CCCC.xlviii.
VE have herd here before / how the Duke of Aniowe wrote himself king of
Cicyle and Jerusalem. And went to Puyle and to Calabre / and conquered all the
country to Naples / but the neapolyta^s would never turn to his part / but
they ever sustained and held with sir Charles de la Payx. the duke of Aniou
abode in this vyage three years / which was a great cost and charge. Though a
man be never so rich / men of arms and war wastes all. For he that will
have service of me^ of war / they must be paid truly their wages / or else
they will do no thing aueylable. Certainly / this said journey cost the duke
of Aniou so much / that it can not be well esteemed. And they that wasted and
confounded most of his richesse / was the earl of Sauoy and the sauosyns. How
be it the earl of Sauoy and a great part of his company dyed in this viage
which was great pytie / so that the duke of Aniowe began to wax feeble / both
of men and of money. and for those two causes he send for so coure in to
France to his two brethren / the duke of Berry and the duke of Burgoyne.
Desyring them not to fail him at his need / but to socour him with men and
money: and so they said they would. Tha^ they aduysed what men were mete to be
send on that voyage. And all things consydred / they ymagined that they could
not send a better / nor one that knew better all men of war / than^e the
gentle lord of Coucy / and with him the lord Da^ghien earl of Conversant /
which Erldome is in Puylle. These two lords were desired by y^ king and by
his uncles to take on the^ that journey / to the which they wyllingly agreed /
and thought it was for the^ right honorable. And so they made them ready and
went forth as soon as they might with their men of war. But when they were
come to Auignon / and intended to their besynes and made their men to pass
forth. Tydinges than came to them how y^ duke of Aniou was deed in a castle
beside Napoles. When y^ lord of Coucy hard the tydinges / he went no farther
forth / for he saw well than that his voyage was broken. But the lord
Conversant passed forth farther / for he had much a do in his country / in
Puylle / and in Conversant. Tydinges was known anon in France of the death of
the duke of Aniou. So thus the death of y^ king of Cicyle was passed over as
well as it might be.

When the duches of Aniowe being at Angers hard of the death of her lord and
husband / ye may well believe she was sore discomforted. And as soon as the
earl Bloys / who was his cosyn germayne knew that the duke was deed: he
deparred fro Blois with all his train and came to his cosyn to Angers / and
held him with her / in comfortynge and counsayling her / to the best of his
power. Than she came in to France (writing her self queen of Napoles / of
Cicyle / of Puylle / of Calabre / and of Jerusalem) to speak with the king /
the duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burgoyne / to have counsel and comfort
of them / and brought with her her two sons / Loys / and Charles. The lady
was counsayled of y^ nobles of France and of her blood / that she should go to
Auignon to the pope / and promise him the possessyon of the erledome of
Prouence / which land parteyned to the king of Cicyle. The lady believed their
counsel and ordained her self to go to Auignon / and to lead with her: her
eldest son Loyes / who was than^e called king by succession of his father.
but these matters were not ouersone accomplysshed as I shall deuyse to you.

ALl this winter the frenchmen ordained to send in to Scotland an army / to
^rowble the realm of England. The truce between France and England was
relonged / (...)d all their adherentes fro Mighelmas to the (...)st day of May.
There was great prouysion (...)e by land and by see. The intent of the
counsel of France was / that the next somer they would make England great
war on all sides / and the admyrall of France to go in to Scotland with two
thousand spears / knights / and squiers / and the duke of Burbone and the
earl de la March with other two thousand to go and conquer certain castles
holden by the Englisshmen / which right sore traueyled the country. And the
french king caused a great nombre of axes to be made in Picardy / and in
Haynalt to serve for y^ voyage into Scotla^de / And in Arthoyse / at Lysle / at
Doway / and at Turney. There was much bysquet made and other prouysion a long
the sea side / for Harflewe to Sluse / which was the princypall haven / where
they thought to take shippynge.

How the lady of Brabant caused to be called a counsel whereat there was the
duke of Burgoyn / the duke Aubert and she / in the city of Cambray / to treat
for the marriage of their children. Cap. CCCC.xlix.
THe duches of Braba^t being a wydow (for y^ duke Wyncelent of Boesme was deed
/ for whose death she had great sorrow at her* heart) lay at Brusels. and it
greatly displeased her: y^ trowble that she saw in Flaunders / and gladly she
would have made a peace and she might / for she understood that the gauntoyse
daily fortifyed them self / by reason of the englisshmen / who promised them
great comfort. Also she saw well her nefewe y^ duke of Burgoyne / who should
be by right enherytoure of Flaunders / and one of the greattest enherytours of
the world / as than^e likely to be / was sore troubled by the gau^toyse. Also
she saw well that the duke Aubert chief of Haynault / and the duches his wife:
had fair children to gyder / two sons and daughters as tha^ unmarried. Also
she knew that the duke of Lancaster was in treaty of marriage for Philyppe his
daughter / had by the lady Blaunche his first wife / and the eldest son of
duke Aubert / who should be right enherytour to the erledome of Haynault / of
Holande / and of zelande. And so the said lady douted that if there were
alyaunce made between England and Haynaulte / that the french men would have
indygnacion thereat. and so there by the ioly country of Haynalt / outher
covertly or openly / such as should pass out of France in to Flaunders /
coming or going / should be sore troubled and grieved. and the rather / because
that duke Aubert by the means of the hola^ders and zelanders such as be
marchyng on the sea side / did comfort daily y^ gauntoyse in diverse manners.
whereof the duke of Burgoyne and his counsel / were well infourmed thereof.
wherefore he loved duke Auberte never the better / and yet he was thereof nothing
gylty. for as for the holanders / and zelanders / the war of Flanders
touched the^ no thing / they would not therefore defend their marchaundyses to
rynne. The said good lady considering all these things and parels that might
ense we / she aduysed to bring these two dukes together / y^ duke of Burgoyne
and the duke Aubert / and y^ she would be the mean to treat between them.
Also she though to entreat the duke of Burgoyne that the gauntoyse might come
to mercy. So this lady on this advise and ymaginacyon / would not let it sleep
/ but set clerks and messa^gers a warke / and she did somoche between these
two dukes / y^ there was a day assygned to mete at Cambray / they and their
cou^sayls. howbeit both dukes knew not the full intent why this lady caused
y^ counsel. To this counsel acordyng as they had promised in the month of
January / about the xii. day / there came to the city of Cambray the duke of
Burgoyne / the duke Aubert and their counsayls / and the duches of Brabant who
opened to the^ all the matter / why they were there assembled. First she showed
to y^ duke of Burgoyne / how he was a great lord / and lykely to be / and
how he had fair children / and how that he should be happy to bestow the^
well and nobly / and to the most advantage for him and his country. saying /
how as than in her opynion / she knew no place so metely for them / as the
country of Haynalt / Holande / and zelande / to bring their countries to a
perfyte peace / and to give fear and doubt to their enemies. For fair nephewe
quod she: I know for truth that the duke of Lancastre is right puyssant in
England / and does that he can that his daughter were married to Wyllim^ of
Heynalt your son and heir. And sir: I had rather se the profyt of you and of
your children / than of the english men. Fair aunt quod the duke I thank
you: I believe you well / I am content and ye can bring it a boute / to let
my daughter Margarete be married to the heir of Haynalt. Than the lady went fro
one part to the other / to treat for this marriage. The duke Aubert to whom
these tydinges were new. answered right curtesly / and said: how he had
there as than no counsel / such as he would have. What counsel would ye
have quod the duches / or what want you to do well / and to bring your
country in peace? I lack my wife quod the duke / and without her I will do
nothing in this matter / for she has as much part of my children as I. Also
fair aunt * it is metely that the nobles of the country be enfourmed thereof.
well quod the duches I pray god all be for the best. And than she thought at
their departinge / to desire them to mete again in the same place in Lent time
/ and to bring their wives and their counsayls with them. This lady did all
this so secretly / that few folks knew wherefore the counsel was. Thus the
two dukes departed fro Cambray. The duke of Burgoyne went to the city of Arras
/ where as the lady his wife was. and the duke Aubert returned in to Hola^de /
where as the lady his wife was. And the Duches of Brabant returned in to her
country / and ever secretly she wrote and sent to either party / and took
great pain to bring again these lords and their wives in to the city of
Cambray: for greatly she desired this marriage to be confyrmed / for to bring
in unite and concord / Flaunders / Brabant / and Haynalt to gyder.

SO much did this good lady / y^ she and the said dukes / their wives and
counsayls came again to Cambray / and there was done great honor / for each
of them enforsed them self to do honor each to other. There was the duches
Margarete of Burgoyn / and the duches Margaret of Heynault / who held sore in
this treaty. saying / y^ if her son should mary Margarete of Burgoyne / she
would also that her daughter should mary John^ of Burgoyne / and so to make a
cross maryag^ / whereby should be y^ more conjunction of love. And so two of
the children of Burgoyne should be married in to one house. The duke of Burgoyne
thought it was enough to mary his daughter / and excused Johan his son.
saying / how h^ was to young of age to be married. for the duk^ of Burgoyne had
ymaginacion to mary Jo(...) his son with Katheryne of France / suster(...)
his nephewe the french king. So thus on (...) point the treaty was like to have
failed / for the duches of Bauiers said / how there should be made no marriage
of any of her children / with out they were both married. Always she held this
purpose / there could no man break her thereof. The duches of Brabant had great
pain to go fro the one to the other / and to bring the treaty toguyder. So
much she did alegynge and she wynge so good reasons / specially to the duke
and duches of Burgoyn / that finally they went through / and concluded that y^
son and daughter of the duke of Burgoyne / should be married to the son and
daughter of the duke Aubert of Bauiers. And y^ let of the matter five days
before / was for a matter that the duke of Burgoyns counsel feared. for they
understood that duke Aubert had not been in true possession of Heynalt / but in
possibylite thereof / for as than lived earl Willyam of Haynault his brother /
and lay sore sick at Ouesnoy / the which earl might recover and ouerlyue duke
Aubert his brother. and if he so did they thought clearly and feared greatly /
that his other brethren should have the gouernynge of Haynault / and the
children of duke Aubert to be put clean out. For this dought they made a delay
in this marriage the space of five days / till at last it was clearly known /
that duke Aubert had no mo brethren but the Earl of Haynault / so that he
could not put the heritage fro duke Aubertes children. Whan^e these things
were known / there was than^e no longer delay / but these maryages were sworn
and couenaunted / that Willym^ of Haynalt should have in marriage Margaret of
Burgoyne. And Johan of Burgoyne to have to his wife Margarete of Haynault / and
that all these should return to Cambray / ^o parforme the solempnisacion of
these maryages at the vtas of Ester than next after. In the ^ere of our lord a
thousand three hundred four ^ore and five.

H^we the french king and the lords of France and of Heynalt / made their
^rouisyon to be at Ca^bray. And of ^^nessage of the duke of Lancastre (...)it
to the earl of Haynalt. and of the (...)yages of the children of Haynalt a(...)
Burgoyne. ^p. CCCC.l.
THus every man departed fro Cambray / and the duke of Burgoyne returned in to
France to the king / and the duches his wife returned to Arras. the duke
Aubert and the duches his wife returned to the town of Ouesnoy in Haynalt.
And the lady of Brabant in to her country. Than warkmen were set awarke to
make ready lodgings in the city of Cambray / and men were sent thither to make
prouisyon / so great and so costly that it was marueyle to consydre. This feast
was cried and publysshed abroad / to be holden at Cambray the weke after the
vtas of Easter. When the french king was enfourmed of this besynes / he said
he would be at the maryages of his cosyns. And so he sent to Ca^bray the
stewardes of his house to make prouisyon for him acordyng. The bysshopes palace
was taken up for the duke of Burgoyne / and his prouysion made there / howbeit
they were feign to deliver it up for y^ king. Than carpenters and masons were
set a warke in the palace to make it after astate royal / which warke as yet
apereth / for before this feast it was not in remembrance of man / nor hard
of two hundred year before / so great a feast and solempnyte as was than
aperelled. For the lords to make the^ fresshe and gorgious / and to exalte
their estates / spared no more money / than it had fallen fro the clouds / and
every man helped other.

Tidings of these marriages came to England. the duke of Lancastre who always
hoped / that Willyam of Haynalt should have had to his wife his daughter / at
leest he was borne so in hand * he was right pensive and sore troubled with
those news. And whan^e he had well ymagined to know the truth thereof / he
sent certain persons of his house to Gau^t / to speak wi^h duke Auberte. And
whan^e these messangers came to Gaunt / there they found sir John^ Bourchier /
and the aldermen of Gaunt / Peter du Boyse and Fraunses Atreman / who made them
right good chere. And so there they tarried two days / and fro thence they went
to Mons in Heynalt / and so to Quesnoy / and there they came to the duke / and
he and the duches and his children received them goodly / for the honor of the
duke of Lancastre / and made them good chere. And in likewise so did the lord
of Gouuighen. Than the master of the byenge of the wolles of England spoke
first / after he had de lyuered his letters of credence / and reco^maunded
the duke of Lancastre to the duke Auberte his cosyn. And than he spoke of other
things as he was charged to do. And among other things / he demanded of
duke Auberte as I was enfourmed / if it were his intent to perceyuer in the
marriage with y^ children of the duke of Burgoyne. With those words the duke a
little changed color / and said: ye sir truly by my faith / wherefore do you
demand. Sir (...) he: I demand it because the duke of Lancastre has
always hoped until this time / that my lady Philyp his daughter / should have
had my lord Willyam your son. Than^e the duke said / co^panyon: say to my
cosyn y^ when soever he mary his children / I shall not marueyle / nor be
dismayed thereat* no more he has to do to take any care for the maryenge of any
of my children / nor whether I will mary them or not / nor when / nor to whom.
This was the answer y^ thenglisshmen had of duke Aubert. So thus they took
theie leave and departed / and went the same night to Ualencennes / and the
next day to Gaunt. Of them I can tell no more but I think they returned in to
England.

When Easter came as than acounted / a thousand three hundred fourscore and
five years of our lord / the french king the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of
Burbon / the duke Aubert / the duches his wife / the duches of Brabant / the
duches of Burgoyne / sir Willyam and sir John^ of Namure / came to Cambray. The
king went to y^ palys that was his lodging / and every man drew to their
lodgings. ye may well believe and know that where the french king was / and
where as there was many noble princes and great ladies / there was great and
noble chiualry. The king entered the monday at none / and all lords and ladies
met him without the town. and so he was conveyed with trompettes / and great
plenty of mynstrels. And so brought to the palys. The same monday in the
presence and before all the great lords: was renewed the couenauntes of
maryages. and Willm^ Dorset should have the countye of Ostrenant / the lady
Margaret his wife was endowed with the land of Acque in Brabant. And y^ duke
of Burgoyn gave his daughter a hundred thousand frankes. Thus they made their
porcyons. The tuysday at the hour of Mass / they were wedded in the cathedrale
church of our lady of Cambray with great solempnyte. The bishop of Cambray
did the obseruaunce / who was called Johan Borne of Brucels. At the dinner there
was showed much noblenes. The king caused the two lords and the two ladies
newly married to sit at his table and other lords served. There sat at dinner
the constable of France / and the marshall of France sir Guy de la Tremoyle /
and sir Willyma de Namure served / and so did diverse other great lords of
France. In five hundred year before there was not seen such a solempnite in
Cambray. And after dinner knights and squiers were armed to just. And so they
iusted in the markette place.xl. knights of the one side. The young king
Charles iusted with a knight of Heynalt called sir Nycholas Espinot. So these
iustes were nobly continued / and a young knight of Haynalt had the price /
called sir Johan of Desternne / beside Beawmont in Haynalt. This knight iusted
greatly to the pleasure of the lords and ladies. He had for his prise a
gyrdell set with precious stones / given him by y^ duches of Burgoyne: from her
own wast. the admyrall of France / and sir Guy de la Tremoyle did present it
to him. Thus in great revel they continued all that weke / and on y^ friday
after dinner / the king took leave of the lords and ladies / and they of him /
and so departed fro Cambray. And also the dukes and duchesses deperted / and
the duches of Burgoyn brought margaret of Haynalt her daughter to Arras. and y^
lady of Haynalt brought y^ lady Margarete of Burgoyne to Quesnoy. Thus passed
forth this besynes.

How the duke of Berrey ensured his daughter / to the son^e of therle of
Bloyse. and how therle of Match and the duke of Burbon made their somons to
enter in to Lymosin. Cap. CCCC.li.
THe sa^e season there was trety of marriage / between Loys of Bloys / son to
therle Guy of ^oy^ and y^ lady Mary / dought (...) Johan of Berry. And so
th(...)rle of Bloys well aco^panyed with lords and ad(...)s brought his
daughter to Bergues in (...) / where the duke and duches were ready (...)de for
them / who tyght nobly received (...) and all their company. And there was
(...)rmed the assurance of that marriage / an(...) (...)chebysshop of Bergues
ensured them (...)der in the presence of many lords and lad(...) howbeit they
were natte wedded as than (...)ey were both very young. So there was great
feast / reuelyng and daunsyng / and so at last therle and the countess
returned to their country / and their son with them. And the lady abode
still with the duches her mother in Barrey / in a fair castle beside Bergues
called Mehune on the river of yure. The same season the duke of Berry went in
to Auuergne and La^guedocke / and so to Auignon to se pope Clement. And it was
ordained that the duke of Burbone and therle of March with two thousand men
of arms should go in to Lymosyn to deliver that country / fro all the
englysshmen and thieves that robbed and pylled the country. For in Poictou and
in Xaynton / they had as than certain fortresses which did much damage to
the country / whereof complayntes came to the heryng of the duke of Berrey* who
was in mind to remedy it. and he had desired the duke of Burbone his cosyn /
that in any wise when he were come into Limosyn and Xaynton / that he should
co^quere the garyson of Bertuell / for that was the forteresse that did most
hurt in that country. And the duke of Burbone promised him so to do. And he
had made his somons at Molins in Burbonoyse to be there the first day of
June / and so thither drew at that time all manner of men of war. The duke of
Burbone had with him a gentle squire called Johan bone lau^ce. He was master
and captain of his men of war. Certainly the squire was well worthy to have
such a charge / and the earl of March who should be in company with the duke
of Burbone made his somons at the city of Toures.

tHe same season there came to Scluse in Flaunders / all such men of war as
were appointed to pass the sea into Scotland / with sir Johan of Uyen admyrall
of France: and he should have with him a thousand spears knights and
squiers. And I believe well they were all there / for they had great desire to
go. In so much that some that were not desired / aduaunsed them self to go in
that voyage with the admyrall. All their shyppyng was ready apparelled at Scluse
/ and they carried with them harness for.xii. hundred men of arms. They had
taken that harness out of the castle of Beauty beside Paris. The harness was
parteyning to the parisyens / the which they were caused to bring to the said
castle in the time of their rebellion. In the admyrals company / there were a
great nombre of good men of war. And their entensyon was to deliver the said
harness to the knights and men of Scotland / because sir Geffray de Charney
had informed the kings counsel / how the men in Scotland were but easily
harnessed. I shall name unto you / part of the^ of France that went in to
Scotland the same season* First sir Johan of Uyen admyrall of France the earl
of grant pre / the lords of Uerdnay / of saint Crouse and of Mountbury / sir
Geffray of Charney / sir Wyllyam of Uyen / sir Jaques of Uyen / the lord
despaigny / sir Gerard of Burbone / the lord of Hetz / sir Floromonde of
Quissy / the lord of Marny / sir Ualerant of Rayneuall / the lord of
Beausaige / the lord of Uaynbrayne / the lord of Rynoll baron dury / the

of Landon breton / sir Guy la person / sir Wyllm^ de Couroux / sir Johan de
Hangyers / sir Henry de Uyncelyn / cosyn to y^ great master of Pruce: and
diverse other good knights which I can not all name / so that they were to the
no^bre of a thousand spears knights and squyers / beside cross bows and
other varlettes. They had good wind and a fair season on y^ see / the wether
was fair / it was in the month of May. That time y^ truse between England
and France was expyred / and bitwene the gau^toyse and flemynges likewise: for
as it seemed than every part desired war / knights and squiers desired
greatly to go in the voyage to Scotland / for they thought by the aid of the
scotts to have a fair journey against their enemies in England.
Thenglysshmen who were enfourmed of their coming / looked for them every day.
