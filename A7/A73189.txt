A most delicate, pleasant, amorous, new Song, made by a Gentleman that enioyes
his Love, showing the worth and happiness of Content, and the effects of love,
call, All lovers Joy.
To the tune of New Paradise.


SIng, O sing, the day is clear.
sad misfortunes are estranged,
Kinder Planets rule the Sphere,
what was ill, to good is changed:
My more froward hope remove,
And I now live where I love.
No more joy to man can happen,
then a creature so divine,
As my love, Each part is shapen
like to Venus in her prime,
No delight so true does prove,
As the sweet contents of love.
Cynthya, when she kissed Endimion,
upon towering Latmos mount,
By each free and wise opinion,
was not of so dear account.
In no age was known to move,
Fairer then my fairest Love.
Hellen in those wrinckled days,
was accounted beauties mirror,
My sweet Ladies glistering rays,
now approve that Ages error.
Hellen far her selfe's above,
Never lived a fairer Love.
Had Paris, when from Troy he parted,
seen in Ida my rich Fleece,
Spartas Queen had not orestarted,
neither her true Lord nor Greece.
Paris never had crossed the flood,
To this day fair Troy had stood.
Jason left his native Greece,
and unto Cholchis toyling went,
At his return, his Golden Fleece
equaled not this ornament:
Ancient Authors do approve
Mine the Queen of truest love,
The Second Part.
To the same Tune.




PRincely Theseus never knew,
nor the wandering Prince of Troy,
A beauty so divine and true,
all their times could not enjoy.
All their fortunes mine is above,
To enjoy so true a Love.
Happier I then tongue can utter,
to possess so fair a Fair,
Every sense for joy does mutter,
to my joys none can compare:
Sweeter pleasures cannot move,
Then to live where one does love.
Powerful love, the worlds knight marshall,
I will sacrifice to thee,
My true honors shall be impartial,
that thou shalt-receiue from me.
All the gods thou art above,
Let me still live where I love.
None does win a happier prize
the content (in mine opinion)
All the consurers of the wise,
grant it is the best dominion:
For the wisest does approve,
Kings can but live where they love.
Silly Swains that pipe on banks,
(turned poor Shepherds for their living
Give to love as many thanks,
as in Court great Lords are giving.
Trust, content does ever move,
In that place where rests love.
Strangest god of Homers number,
I will ever thee adore.
Thou art only earths great wonder
Cupid, I they aid implore.
As to serve thee still I strove,
Grant me still life where I love.
Pleasure now such scope possesses,
all my joy is in the prime,
No sad thought my mind opresseth,
comfort is so truly mine.
All delights do in me move,
Because I live where I love.
Come, O come and sing with me,
at my Feasts and Banquetings
Lovers all, that speeders be,
come rejoice like petty kings:
All our songs shall still approve,
All content does live with love.
Finis.
