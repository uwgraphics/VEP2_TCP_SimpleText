The Shepherd and the King, and of Gillian the Shepherds Wife, with h^^
Churlish answers: being full of mirth and merry pastime.
To the Tune of flying fane.

AN Elder time there was fo yore,
when gybes of Churlish glee,
Were used amongst our country Carles,
though no such thing now be.
The which King Alfred liking well,
forsook his stately Court:
And in disguise unknown went forth,
to see that Iouiall sport.
How Dick and Tom, in clowted shoone,
and coats of russet Gray,
Esteemed themselves more brave then those
that went in Golden ray.
In Garments fit for such a life,
our good King Alfred went,
All raged and torn, as from his back,
the Beggar his clothes had rent.
A Sword and Buckler good and strong
to give Jack sauce a rap:
And on his head in stead of a Crown,
he wore a Munmouth Cap;
Thus coasting through Somerset Shire,
near Newton Court he met
A Shepherd swain, of lusty limbs,
that up and down did iet.
He wore a Bounet of good gray,
close buttoned to his chin:
And at his back a leather Scrip,
with much good meat therein.
God speed good Shepherd (quoth. our King)
I come to be thy Guest,
To taste of thy good victual here,
and drink that is of the best.
Thy Scrip I know has cheer good store,
What then, (the Shepherd said)
Thou seem to be some scuruy Thief,
and make me sore afraid.
Yet if thou will thy dinner win,
thy Sword and buckler take:
And if thou can, into my Scrip
therewith an entrance make.
I tell thee Roister it has store
of Beef and Bacon fat,
With shiues of Barley bread to make
thy chops to water at.
Here stands my Bottle, here my Bag,
if thou can win them, Roister,
Against thy Sword and Buckler here
my sheep-hooke is my waster.
Benedicite now (quoth our King)
it never shall be said,
That Alfred of thy Shepherds hook,
will stand a whit afraid.
So roundly thus they both fell to it,
where giving bang for bang:
At every blow the Shepherd gave,
King Alfreds Sword cride twang.
His Buckler proou'd his chiefest fence,
for still the Shepherds hook
Was that, the which good Alfred could
in no good manner brook.
At last when they had sought four hours,
and it grew just midday,
And wearyed both, with right good will,
desired each other stay.
Kings truce I cry, quoth Alfred then,
good Shepherd hold thy hand:
A sturdier fellow then they self,
lives not within this Land:
Nor a Rustier Roister then thou art,
the churlish Shepherd said:
To fell thee plain, thy Theeuish looks
now make my heart afraid.
Else sure thou art some Prodigal,
that have consumed thy store:
And here come wa^dring to this place,
to rob and steal for more.
Deem not of me, then quoth our King,
good Shepherd, in such sort:
A Gentleman well known I am,
In good Kings Alfreds Court.
The Devil thou art, the Shepherd said,
that go in rags thus torn:
Thou rather seem (I think) to be
some Beggar basely borne:
But if thou will mend thy estate,
and here a Shepherd be:
At night to Gillian my old wife,
thou shall go home with me.
For she is as good a toothlesse Dame,
as mumblet^ on brown Bread:
Where thou shall lie in harden sheets,
upon a fresh Straw bed:
Of Whig and Whay, we have great store,
and keeps good Peas-straw fires:
And now and then good barley cakes,
when better day requires.
But for my Master which is chief,
and Lord of Newton Court:
He keeps (I say) us Shepherd S^^^^^^
in far more brauer sort:
We there have Curds and clouted C^^^^^
of red Cowes morning milk:
And now and then fine Buttered C^^^^
as soft as any silk.
Of Beef, and roasted Bacon store,
that is most fat and greazie,
We have likewise to feed our Chops,
to make them glib and easy.
Thus if thou will my man become,
this usage shall thou have:
If not, adue, go hang they self,
and so farewell sir knave.
King Alfred hearing of this glee,
the churlish Shepherd said,
Was well content to be his man,
and so the bargain made:
A penny round the Shepherd gave
in earnest of the match:
To keep his sheep in Field and Fo^^
as Shepherds use to watch.
His wages should be full ten Groat^^
for service of an year:
Yet was it not his use, old Lad,
to hire a man so dear:
For did the King himself (quoth he^
unto my Cottage come:
He should not for his twelue-month^ (...)
receive a greater sum.
Here at the bonny King grew blyth^
to hear this Clownish jest:
How silly Sots as Customers,
do descant on the best.
But not to spoil the following spor^^
he was content (good King)
To sit the Shepherds humor right
in every kind of thing.
A Sheep-hooke then, with Patch his (...)
and Tar box by his side:
He with his Master cheek by iowl^
unto old Gillian hyed:
Unto whose sight no sooner ^ome,
whom have you here (quoth she?^
A Fellow (I doubt) to cut ^ur thr^^^^
so like a knave looks he.
The second part.
To the same tune.

NOt so, old Dame, quoth Alfred straight,
of me you need not fear:
^y Master has hired me for ten Groates,
^o serve you one whole year.
(...) good Dame Gillian, grant me leave
within your house to stay:
^^r by Saint Anne do what you can,
I will not yet away.
^er churlish usage pleased him still,
but put him to such proof:
^^at he that night was almost choakt
within that smoakie roof.
^ut as he sat with smiling cheer,
the event of all to see:
^^s Dame brought forth a piece of Dowe,
which in the fire throws she.
^here lying on the Harth to bake,
by chance the Cake did burn:
that can thou not, thou Lowt, quoth she,
Make pains the same to turn?
^hou art more quick to rake it out,
and eat it up half Dowe:
^^en thus to stay till't be enough,
and so thy manners show.
^^t serve me such another trick,
I Will thwack thee on the snout:
which made the patient King good man,
of her to stand in doubt.
^^t to be brief, to bed they went,
the good man and his Wife:
^ never such a lodging had
^ing Alfred in his life.
(...) he was laid on white Sheep wool,
^^w pulled from tanned Fells:
(...) ore his head hung spiders webs,
^s if they had been Bells:
(...) this the Country guise, thought he?
then here I will not stay:
^^t hence be gone so soon as breaks
^he peeping of next day.
^^e cackling Geese and Hens kept roost,
and pearcht by his bed side:
^here at the last the watchful Cock
^ade known the mornings tide:
^^en up got Alfred, with his horn,
and blew so long a blast,
^^at made Gillian and her Groom,
^n bed full sore aghast.
Arise, quoth she, we are undone,
this night we lodged have,
At unawares within our house,
a false dissembling Knave.
Rise, husband, rise, he will cut our throats,
he calls for his Mates,
I Would give (old Will) our good Cade-Lambe
he would depart our Gates.
But still King Alfred blew his horn,
before them more and more:
Till that a hundred Lords and Knights
alighted at their door:
Which cried all hayle, all hayle good King,
long have we looked your Grace:
And here you find (my merry men all)
your Sovereign in this place.
We shall be surely hanged up both,
old Gillian, I much fear,
Tha Shepherd said, for using thus
our good King Alfred here:
A pardon my Liege (quote Gillian then)
for my Husband and for me;
By these ten bones I never thought,
the same that now I see.
And by my hook the Shepherd said,
and Oath both good and true,
Before this time, O Noble King,
I never your highness knew:
Then pardon me, and my old Wife,
that we may after say:
When first you came into our house,
it was a happy day.
It shall be done, said Alfred straight,
and Gillian my old Dame,
For this thy churlish using me,
deserves not much blame:
For it is the Country guise, I see,
to be thus bluntish still.
And where the plainest meaning is,
remains the smallest ill.
And Master, so I tell thee now,
for thy late manhood shown,
A thousand Weathers I Will bestow
upon thee for thine own:
With pasture grounds, as much as will
suffice to feed them all:
And this thy Cottage, I will change
into a stately Hall,
And for the same (as duty binds)
the Shepherd said, good King:
A milk white Lamb once every Year,
I Will to your Highness bring:
And Gillian my old Wife likewise,
of wool to make your Coats:
Will give so much at New-yeeres tide,
as shall be worth ten Groates.
And in your praise, my Bag-pipe shall
sound sweetly every year:
How Alfred our renowned King,
most kindly has been here.
Thanks, Shepherd, thanks, quoth. he again
the next time I come hither,
My Lords with me here in this house,
will all be merry together.
