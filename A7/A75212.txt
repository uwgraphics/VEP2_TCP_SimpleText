A Second Edition OF THE NEW ALMANAC For the Year 1656. OR, THE Nocturnall
Revised: Being Annotations upon the late Mercurius Aero-machus.

Wherein that Author, or the Printer for him, which is all one, was very
rightly mistaken, when he Entitled the same A REL-I-ATION OF Strange and
wonderful Sights seen in the Air on the first of January last, at the time the
Moon was in the Eclipse.

The truth whereof, if any man doubts, it is but airing his Horse in a
morning or so, as far as Selby in Yorkshire, which is scarce an 150 miles off,
where the print of the Horses feet are still to be seen in the Sky.

Together with an huge Compasse-window Rainbow, seen that night at Jackdaw-ood,
in the same County; where the Echo of the Drums and Trumpets remain visibly
to be heard to this day.

Being likewise Communicated in a Letter to a Friend, with an Epistle
Dedicatory at the end of the Book.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1656.

The Printer to the Reader.
Gentle Reader.
THe nimble aerie Mercury, having gotten the start of our Commentator, that he
could not be bound up with him; not knowing whether his treatise may ever come
to your hands, for the better understanding of the Following premises, I
thought fit to give you in this page, in stead of the Actors names, a brief
account of the story, without Interlarding, especially of those more remarkable
passages, which are Anatomised and held forth in this Lecture.

On Tuesday the first of January last, between 7 and 8 of the clock at night,
the Moon being then in the Eclipse, the air very cold, but no wind at all
stirring: The Author of that relation, with diverse other spectators, discovered
in the air, toward the North-west, a certain stream or cloud, in form and
color like a Rainbow, which first passing away, there arose from the earth a
bright and fiery pillar, standing straight up, but not very high: above this
fiery pillar, there appeared a darkish cloud, out of which came a great
company of Horse and Foot, the which in a little time, were formed into a
mighty army: so complete for order, and other things, that the beholders,
though many of them soldiers, said, They never saw the like, and here you must
be sure to remember, that a Minister, in a marginal note of the book, tells
you, that he being a hanger on at that scuffle, verily thought that the form
of Battalia, resembled that of Naseby-field, as he remembers to have seen the
same set forth in mapps: Those Gentlemen, having taken their seats, at the same
time there appeared in the East another great army of Horse and Foot: the which
came out of the Earth as the former, but without the prologue of a pillar, and
a cloud, They being not willing to go to the charge

The Eastern army was greater in number, and bigger in bulk of body, then the
other, but not so comely to sight, nor any commander in chief therein nor
somany field officers as the others had, who besides, inferior Captains, had
a General much like to the Sun: riding before them] Both the armies marched
one toward another, but it was observed, the North-west, [being perhaps a
flying army went much faster, and met the other the better half way being met,
there happened a very formal and mortal battle between them, but in
conclusion; the North west army beat the other out of the field, and yet durst
not keep it all night, themselves for fear of an ambush, but went off too, And
all this happened in a little more, then half an hour, and it is to be
remembered, that when the North-west army, went off, the Prisoners that were
taken, were plainly seen amongst them, this sight is said to have been seen at
wistoo near Selby in Yorkshire.

The same Night was seen a Rainbow too, at Hull.

Also at Cawood, the same night, the like to all this was discovered by a
Company, who were viewing the Eclypse of the Moon: One of them being more
quick-sighted then any of the rest, First spying the Armies in the Air: showed
them afterward to his fellows; According to the old proverb, One fool makes
many.

THE LETTER.
SIR!
BY the slender Ticket I bring with me for my admittance, you will easily
perceive, how readily presumptuous I am to intrude upon your more serious
affairs, it being only the enclosed printed paper; whose report, if in its
passage up at first it blew the horn, or has since reflected hence by other
means unto you, I beseech you to pardon this absurdity, and then impute the
reason of my sending, to be a desire of knowing; whether this have any better
credit with you, then that of vagrant same alone; or of the no less impudent
Press, which though no gadder abroad it self, has still standing by it those
vomitum absorbentes, as the Painter feigned of the Poet, such as are ready to
lick up any thing, and all it casts forth, that nothing be lost: Not knowing
where to find the Author, who perhaps is fallen sick, poor man, with the
fright he took; and therefore had not need be disturbed with questioning] I
have presumed to trouble you for my satisfaction, who I suppose may be able to
give some certain account thereof, if any such be to be expected; since I find
it, if not acted in, yet forged for your own meridian; the very town, if I
mistake not, where some of your friends in the North dwell, and where they say
this Terrible big-bellied-Trojan-horse Cloud disburthened it self, and
afterward packed up again, and went off with a very orderly retreat. As yet I
must confess I esteem it but what the Author himself, without correction, has
Entitled it, A RELIATION indeed; that half-piked letter [though he intended to
smother the business; for fear it should be challenged again] which he took up
after the field was fought, being in my judgment not redundant, but necessarily
inserted, whereby that word alone is rendered true, and all the whole Book
besides one great continued Erratum; which if so, the very Contempt thereof is
punishment enough for such a forgerie; Yet This fellow has thereby so
disturbed, and moved the air, that I cannot keep a Windmill I have in my head
from running Sallengers round, a while with it; but being yet at liberty, I
should be loath to immure my self, as needs I must, between two walls; If I
should undertake to decide the nicety of the point in general (waving in all
respects the present Relation) whether Apparitions of this nature, have indeed
so much reality in them, as that of their very apparency, or no, there being
not more confident maintainers on the one side, then obstinate opposers on the
other; and therefore I shall decline the same, and confine my self to sit close
upon the skirts of my Author, making some proper Annotations upon my present
Don Quixot.

First then, that there might be no stop in proceedings, but that without
susspending your belief, you may be ready to Join issue with him, he tells
you he was present himself, an eie-witnesse of the combat; and I think, with
some small necessary alteration, I might add for him what his own modesty
would not permit him to utter; viz. that great brag of Aeneas to Dido, in his
story to her of the sack of Troy. Et quorum pars tota fui.

But he was present, yes that he was, I will maintain it for him against any
man; for he must needs be there, where he either saw or made this Tragedy:
unless we will fondly imagine the Seal can be absent from the Wax, while the
impression is making; or that his Printer was drinking at the Alehouse, all
the while his book was in hand: for my own part I shall easily believe him to
have been present; And yet (if he aimed at that) think him never the more
valiant; For though I assure my self the stoutest heart could not brook such a
sight without some astonishment; yet I know no reason, but the shamefullest
coward may stand by him too, cheek by jowl, with hazard little enough; however,
certainly he was there, for we must not imagine, that these new raised
Train-bands, of the Rare-Aerian-militia, would go to exercise themselves in
their Artillery-garden without giving notice to their Cozen citts, that so they
might, if they pleased, be Spectators.

And thus far I have engaged my Author; and yet further, if honest probable
contrivance, and self-denying moderation, in what the Relator himself may be
concerned, as sometimes it does; I know no reason but it may here as well win
upon our belief; for though the publisher (I will say that for him who ever he
was) may be able no doubt to see as far into a millstone as another man, yet
this Kitish Gypsy would not pretend to spy, or discover what these combatants
did, until they were come clear out of the cloud; And then I hope it was as
lawful for him to take a view of them at full, as another man, which if he did,
as he says, pace tua Domine. it was long of your eyes.

Having thus far not only vindicated, but commended our Author; I hope for my
good will toward him, it will not be expected I should answer for any of his
after-failings, nor do I intend it; for I must needs confess, I cannot clear
him in one particular of the contrivance, as to point of prudence, whereof
perhaps he would purposely make no use, it being a Cardinal virtue; The matter
is this: He fancied the Battalia form of the Armies he talks of, to have
resembled those real ones at Naseby field] An error I did not think he would
have been guilty of, and for his credits sake I would be loath any body else
should take notice of, I much wondering how he could possibly hope, this
Retrograde Prognosrication should any way take with the people, in foretelling
them a thing from the sky, that had been already past more then ten years: And
surely if Astrologers are judged to soar too high by some, who make the Stars a
prophetical book, legible to judgments that way studied, yet this Revising
Calculator to be sure erreth as much in defectu, who offers to make them his
post-book and Chronicle, only to register things already past, this in time
might have been fairly provided for: If I had been of his counsel, I would have
advised him to have winked at the business a while, and have let the
skirmishers fought on till the 12 of June, and then a body might have had
somewhat to say for him; That probably, the departed slain on both sides, were
anniversarily allowed weapons on that day, to renew the memory of their
Combat. I will urge this slip no more upon the publisher, it being more
pardonable in him: But that the reverend Rabbi MANASSEH BEN ISRAEL too, should
be found not only accessory, but principal in this foul mistake, is a thing
whereby I humbly conceive He has deserved to have his whole nation barred out
of England, and that he should consent to have his folly hung up in the
margent, like a head and purtenance, is such a desire of being taken notice of,
I believe would set even the grave men of Gotham themselves, into a very
dangerous irrecoverable laughter. That all things might have been answerable, I
once thought to have had this man in my margent too, but then I intended to
have had him drawn at length in his own proper colors; in a pied Coat, and
such a like Sophisters Cap, with his worthy observation written in a scrowl
coming out of his mouth. Sir! your ingenuous confession, that you only make
the comparison as it lies in the Map, not pretending you were at the fight
your self, to have blown the coals. I approve of, and no man blames you for
your study of praelic-graphical maps, or that accurate Posture-Lexicon; where
we have the same man in several places, shouldring, loading, resting, priming,
and discharging his musket; no man blames you for this, it being requisite,
that while so many soldiers in this later age have turned preachers, that some
of these should go over and fill up their ranks, that so in time, if so it come
to pass, all on both sides may be found to have changed station. It being
better so, for ought I know, then being shuffled into one pack of
milito-praedicant Clergy, or praedico-militant Soldiery: nor can any impute
to you as a Seer, your itching desire of beholding this Ran counter. All this
was well enough, but since you would needs have all things Hieroglyphical, nay
and the very form of the Battle too: Yet sure it had been more consonant,
especially for You, to have patterned the resemblance of the Battalia ex Sparta
tua by some other Armies which the pillar and cloud, you all agree was there,
might well have minded you of, but now to the Book it self.

This sight he tells you was seen the first of January.] And now Janus his
gates are thrown of the hinges, and we are like to have a mad new year, which
thus begins with fighting for we must not think it will end thus. for if
the weathermongers rule hold true, that a jury of holy days are summoned every
year to give up their verdict of the following months; whether guilty or not
of fair weather, whose corn, upon what ground I know not, they measure by
their own bushel, then I say, Raw-head and bloody bones, we must look for
terrible doings all next July, that being the seventh month, as well as new
years day the seventh feast from Christmas; but again I must remember you
this first of January fell then on a Tuesday; for this tale would not have been
so proper if it had had fallen on another day, it being very requisite Mars his
puppet play, should be acted on his own holy day. Besides, it falling out so
pat at that time of year; In my opinion it may pass for the prettiest piece of
Enthusiastic Mummery, that ever was invented, to entertain the time in a
Christmas Gamboile.

The Author goes on. Between 7 and 8 of the Clock at night,] He is somewhat
too precise in the time, which might give occasion to some to think it a plo
ted business, but I am none of those, For indeed I hold his discretion
commendable therein, who judged that such an antic mask as this, would show
much better by owle-light. and therefore intending to have only a few wax
candles and a torch or two to show by, it is observed that after be had lighted
them up, it being only a private acting, that he put out the Moon taking her
by the heels; and holding her head a while under water, in the ducking pond,
making them who stood by believe she was burnt out and Eclypsed in a snuff,
there is a further reason why so late; Sed de hoc vide plura infra.

There appeared says he in the aire] Our relator I see is a very fair
gamester, and may be trusted another time, for though there was nobody there
but himself to eye him, yet he scorned to deal foul, playing all above
board, up in the air high enough to be sure, he need not fear any body should
look in his hand, for which perhaps he had a private reason to himself,
having been formerly, if same belie him not, burnt at sessions for forging of
debentares:

But again In the aire] And why not I pray; you that giggle and fleere so at
this? you would be loath in a winter night when you sit poring in the chimney
corner, and frame Chymaeras to your selse out of the fire, that any body should
contradict what you protest you see there, while the night mare is upon you and
the resemblance holds strong; and why then must this man be denied his Vis
Plastica? being a man of very choice parts that way, as I presage will
hereafter be judged of him, when his body comes to be begged for an anatomy;
why then must he I say be denied either the power, only berty, of forming to
himself what fights he pleases, of horse, foot, arms etc. out of the other
Element? and truly in my opinion this master of the ceremonies deserves the
monopoly better then any other, few besides himself being able to have
marshalled all things in such excellent equipage as he has done.

There appeared in the Air what? A certain stream or cloud in ferme and
color like a rainbowe] who can tell what to make of this? A certain stream or
cloud? and only like a rainbow? he ascertaineth nothing, and yet if it reached
from one end of the air unto the other, as probably it did, I shall not doubt
to affirm for him it was a mere Crosse-Bow.

This passing away there arose etc. the prologue being over, the play
begins, enter the military pageant; but by the way hence may be collected
that his warriors were but poor spirited men, or but meanly accoutred with
defensive arms that they durst not come upon the stage until The coast was
clear, you had like to have seen none of them, unless the bow be first
removed (call and hang if you will) although it was certain there was no body
there but the man In the moon to shoot it of:

But now they hunt full mouth, having started the hare: There arose from the
earth says our Author a bright and fiery pillar; on the top of this pillar was
seen a cloud, out of this cloud came forth a long et cetera of horse; foot,
cannon, arms and what not? he now that thinks these words are all to be
understood, literally, I assure him will find himself very much deceived. for
Ut similes haheant labra lactucas I am resolved somnium in somnio requiretur,
to have my dream and vagary as well as he; not caring though I thereby
entangle the. business so much the more, having provided as mad a comment for
so mad a story: The truth of the matter then was This, the relator having
nothing else to do, in an odd mood, observing his time, when the Moon was na
pping, went and transferred Lets wife from the plains of Sodom, placing her
more advantageously upon a rising hill in Yorkshire; this is meant by his
pillar, where when he had fixed her, looking a while, and peering very
wishfully upon her as e're Pigmalion on his statue; at length Horrendum dictu
from under her black hood, which he very subtly termed a cloud, this
muster-master General espied these brave aerian duellists come crawling forth:
nor does it any way hinder this exposition, that the Author expressly says
this pillar was on fire, for we must know it is not said to be so in respect
of matter, as the common sort, may be apt to take it, but in respect of the
form thereof; in that it went pointing and spiring up like a flame, that so,
let the matter have been what it would, yet still it might have been called
fiery in respect of the Pyramidall form thereof; but to satisfy the further
contentious I am resolved it was and shall be so as I have said and though I
should grant them it were true and real fire. yet according to the rate that I
intended to expound this treatise, it may stand well enough for salt too, and
what is that to them, if the Author be content, to whom I think I have done a
courtefie, since such stories as these use not to pass sine grano salis and
unless we allow him some seasoning for his fiery pillar it would presently
go out in igne (...)

Thus much for the Learned: But that other people too may have somewhat for
their money, I shall suppose the Rise to have been this: For we must know,
That all fictions are built upon some Fundamental truth] Our Author as I
understand, having been well warmed with a long winded mornings draught, which
held him till two in the afternoon, laid himself down upon the bed, where
slumbring away some two or three hours, at last he fell into a sound sleep;
but being wakened on a fuddain, with a mighty noise over his head above in the
Garret, he lay still and harkned; but being much afraid, and judging the tumult
rather to increase, he got him up, and went and raised the town, when having]
The constable with them, they stole up stairs, to see what was the matter;
being come to the door, they heard such a confused noise of scratching,
squeaking, grinning, mauwing, etc. that they could not possibly devise, what
should be the business: Having first demanded, yea and tried to have forced an
entrance, as themselves give out, to excuse their fulness of Courage, finding
the door fast barricado'd up, and all the crannies stuffed with well tempered
rats-bane, they went up another pair of stairs, into the three-peny room,
being resolved to see the fight what ever it cost; where when they were come,
they untiled the top of the house, when looking down after all these pains
these Skeptics saw the mortallest battle, that ever was sought between a
company of North-westerne Catts, (whose feet were shod with Wallnut-shells,
which caused the great noise) And an unruly rout of North-east Ratts, which, as
they truly report (for fear will make a man glad to say any thing) were much
bigger then their Antagonists* But to be short, the Cattae (being a very
warlike people, who give the lion rampant for their arms, being allowed by the
Heralds so to do, for that as is found upon record, their Ancestor was spitten
out of his mouth) and fighting also in a just cause, to recover the Impery,
nature had conferred on them over the other quickly subdued, and drove them all
into a mouse-hole: This latter opinion I rather incline to, for that I find it
gives light to the decision of a former question viz. What that stream or
cloud in form and color like a Rainbow should be, which we were fain to
stubber over before it was no other then the beam that went cross the room
where they fought; Which being in a Gentleman's house, was painted all over of a
light red color: only here and there a streak of green and white, and other
colors, even as pleases the Painter; you may laugh at this now if you please:
but I assure you as well skilled in Hors-flesh, as the best of you are; the
beam being arched, and colored, as it was, you might have been deceived
thereby, as well as our Author. The next thing we observe unto you is the great
Number of both armies.

Several companies of Horse and Foot, etc.] Now if any man on purpose to
cavil, after so manifest conviction should yet peevishly examine, how so many
regiments of Horse and Foot, carriage, Baggage, Ammunition, and all Habiliments
of war, necessary to the furnishing forth a royal army, for a pitched field)
could all be contained, and lie dormant, like Jack in a box under so little a
Hovel as the Cloud he speaks of, which in reason could not be very big, since
being fixed on the pillar, it would well nigh have obscured the same; it being
not very high, which yet was not so?) Our relator, has herein to answer for
himself, for ought I know, what a former Brother of his cloth was feign to
make use of, when having confidently reported here at home, that beyond sea
there were Bees as big as Hogs, and yet the hives no bigger then here in
England; being thereupon demanded, how it was possible those swinish bees could
get in or out those hivish sties; flearingly replied, Nay let them look to
that; But not to put you off with a flam, nor yet to tell you the clouds are
made of stretching Leather, whosoever gives credit to the story of the
Platter-faced Cabbage, which I hope we all do, who are not quite out of love
with that Beef-sauce-budget-root dish, can no way doubt of the truth of this;
since, for ought we know, the pillar was hollow, and where I pray then is the
impossibility? This cloud on the top of the pillar, being then but as a round
hole in the floor of a theater, whereat there being through vaults underneath,
all the men in the city might come up, If there were room as here there was to
be sure the whole air being allowed them, for their Randezvous: But to leave
no scruple, and fetch the author of clear, without ransom, what will you say
If I can prove, they all came out of a much lesser place then the Cloud? And
that is out of the Relators own noddle, the truth hereof if any man doubts,
I will undertake for your two pence a piece, Come when you will, you shall see
him send forth ten times as many more; give him leave to whiffe but a little
Spanish first, which is but reason and then you shall plainly perceive the
Pillar and Cloud he talks of, were no other, but the lighted Tobacco-pipe he
held in his hand: while at the same time he blew the Smoke out of his mouth.

This pillar and cloud it is said, came out of the earth] out of the earth?
hold a little: oh oh (...), to the tune of Joy come to thee old Dicke, I have
now found who these gentlemen should be: do you not remember, how at the
beginning of these times there was much talk, of great numbers of papists and
malignants, who were trayning themselves under ground, for a design, which but
some five men knew of, who had been dead fifty years before? and though some
few foole-hardy infidells of that age, would not suffer themselves to be gulled
into a belief thereof, yet the event now has proved it too true; These were
the men: but then a grand doubt will arise how our author brought these blades
to his lure; for that side being wholly defeated, whose part they were to have
taken, they grew sullen and intended never to have come out at all, And to
think of forcing them was an idle enterprise, especially the Caves mouth where
they went in being altogether unknown, but our Author was no fool, for he had
a trick for this too, which he formerly learned when he was prentice to a wine
Couper, who have a pretty art, by knocking their knuckles on a wine vessel to
tell whether it be empty or not, and more then that, can force out the liquor
into another vessel, without ever broaching, or pouring it forth at the top;
well then Our Author having formerly satisfied himself, where their Center
was, which he accidentally discovered seven years agone, when he was fast
sleeping on the ground, by a palpable noise which he heard in the room
underneath him, which he kept to himself: But now on the first of January
betimes in the morning; having received an express from his Socio-forger in
the North east army, for between these two used to pass intelligence] that
they were already upon the borders, and intended to be that night, at the place
appointed between them for battle. This wine-Couper as I told you, takes his
Gamlock-pipe And goes to his old Molehill where he had formerly slept, claweth
of the bung with both hands And thrusting in his instrument a good way down
into the earth, which he found hollow, being a good-smith-bellow-lung'd
Ruccinator, He sent such a thundering Alarm, into those low subterraneous
cavernes, That ne detur Vacuum, as the old books have it. But I rather, think
for that they could not possibly endure his stinking breath came bolting up, in
order as they stood next these brave warriors Lees and all, not so much as a
Landabrides being left behind; and here you must call to mind that all this was
not done till between 7 and 8 at night, for which I promised to give you a
further reason: Our Author would be loath to be found guilty of his slip, who
made Hercules bring up Cerberus from Hell at noon day, when being un-used to
the light, that Triple-headed, and so consequently Twelve legged curre,
stumbled three times every stepp he went, and was ready to knock at least one
of his Choppes against every post he met; this was a pretty tolerable fore cast,

One guess more what Creatures these parties should be, and I have done: It
being in the air where they fought, I believe they were no other then two
great swarms of bees, striving for the propriety of some Rosemary hangings
growing on a wall, in the Relators garden: And if we take it thus, we must
understand, that the pillar and cloud from whence they came, were no other,
then the Hive and candle burning in it, to show them the way out, it being then
dark, And then too the Author might very well have entitled his story, The
History of the Maccabees:

All this were well enough: But did ever man talk more idly, when he tells
us of the approach of the armies each to other: It was observed says he, that
the North west army moved much swifter, and met the other more then half way:
could he not be content to play the fool to himself, but he must needs pull
passengers by the cloak with an It is observed, who otherwise might happily
not have taken notice of his folly? for if there be any, he himself must bear
the blame, since he brought the North west army in a coach to the place of
battle, dropping them fresh and lusty out of his cloud as Chesse-men out of a
bag and therefore no wonder if happily they were nimbler for a spurt then the
other, who had come a long march that day, Having neither pillar nor cloud to
ease them] in a direct line from the Antipodes, being feign to be their own
pioneers all the way: And yet for all his talk I believe if the truth were
known, neither army had the ball of the other, nor perhaps the goal, but that
the Relator out of great partiality gave them both to the North-west Army; For
though I know no reason, but he ought to have stood equally affected; They
being both alike, his own offspring, yet ever since the Declaratorie Bull of
the old Parliament against Neutralitie, he is resolved to be of one side or
other, and take to a Faction, although in a Fiction.

The Eastern Army had no Commander in chief, but the North-west had, and him a
gallant person, like the Sun] Mounted upon a dark brown Barbary Pegasus, who
having a Scymitar in one hand, and a Caemiterium in the other, to bury therein
all he should kill, rode up to the front of the enemy, and fought there all
the while, which was I conceive a chief cause the other were beaten, fighting
at very great disadvantage, having the Sun in their faces.

The fight continued half an hour] How, no longer? I wonder where this fellow
got the nack of dispatching businesses of this nature in such a trice: What!
Table spread? guests come? a running banquet? all either eaten or pocketed up,
and then the Bells rung backward, Cloth taken away! Company gone! yea and room
swept too, that no body can tell any body was there, and all this in less
then an hour? Sure this was a rare Engineer: Ovid! why he was a fool to him in
this kind. What a strange circuit does he fetch to bring in his simple tale De
fratribus denti-natis? First we must hear a tale of a Cock and a Bull, in which
last shape (a likely matter) Jove bears away Cadmus sister; and we, as if we
had nothing else to do, must go seek her with him, till at last we find her in
the shape of a Cow; it was a wonder, having been so long away, she had not a
Calse by her side too: And then again, after many more preambles, trots,
gallops, and now and then a Parenthetical hedge and ditch to take over, at
length he brings us to the place where Cadmus was to fight with the Serpent,
which me thinks, if the Poet would have done any thing for him, he might have
got knocked down ready to his hands: However with much ado, he and Cadmus
together make a shift to kill the Dragon, and having boned his jaws, he
persuades this Wise-acres to sow the ground with the teeth, which having done,
he rocketh him asleep in a cradle till harvest, where he might have snoared
till this time, but that he was wakened with a uery strange confusion, His new
crop of corn being fallen together by the ears, and so continued threshing one
another a pretty space in his sight, till a strong gale of wind laid them all
one way; for that Cadmus eloquence did it I will never believe: he might well
have spared some of this Preface, and not have omitted as he has done, because
he could not get them into Verse, some more remarkable passages, which yet I am
fure are as true as most of the rest; As that this Fray went afterward by name
of the battle of Cock-all; and that thereupon Cadmus instituted that ancient
Olympic game called Scale-pins, in memory of nine of those gallants Lads, who
were placed by themselves as a reserve, in such admired posture, that look which
way you would, rank, file, or cross, they still were seen three, three and
three, all Dactyle feet, like the beginning of the first verse in Virgil,
Ty-ty-re-tu-pa-tu-lae-re-cu-; which goodly order they maintained, till an hand-
Granado, Anglice a Bowl, unfortunately lighting among them, tipped them all
down at once. I could have shown this Poet a shorter cut; for if he must needs
have his men without either flesh or blood, for the more likelihood of the
story, and better enduring the shock of the battle, he might but have gone to
one or two of our London Teeth-chandlers, and have taken whole bushels of this
Bone-seed upon his word, or at most there needed but a deed of bargain and sale
have passed between them, which might very properly have begun with the usual
form of This Indenture, etc. This had been the nearer way; for then being ready
strung, rank and file, to his hands; he needed but have sent them into the
lists, they having a long time stood ready drawn, expecting when the word
should have been given: But what do we talk of him for! Our Author I am sure
would have taken this course, if he had intended any such mockery: But he
thanketh you, he will not be persuaded to venture his teeth to Dantzick in
hopes of I know not what return, nor yet to bury them alive in the earth,
before he goes thither for good and all; as much doubting, I cannot blame him,
whether ever they might spring up again. But if he must needs sow before reap,
he is for a crop of Mushroms, somewhat that will come up again quickly, all in a
night, that he may be sure of his breakfast the next morning; And this method
he uses in This invention. But that you may know I am as good at it as he, I
will contract all in a less compass, and yet put in somewhat that he left out,
Our Landlord then, on the first of the last January, having been very
melancholy many days before, and sworn to see somewhat that night, what ever
came of it; between 7 and 8 a night, having cleared his eie-sight, and thickened
his common sense with a good round Boul of muddi-cappado, he steppeth me forth
from the fire side into his yard, where having seated himself upon a
three-storied horse-block, which stood just by the pales; the air being very
cold, that he could not possibly stay long out, presently by the word of
command, starteth out a pillar from under the earth, as nimbly as ever Hiccius
doctius out of Hocus Pocus cap: on the top of this pillar was seen a Cloud, out
of this Cloud came forth an innumerable company of Soldiers, who being all in
a trice set in order, without any speech at all made by the General to
encourage them, they march toward another army, which were seen coming on
from an opposite quarter; straight they meet, encounter, rout, kill, vanish,
and all is well again; why now! is not this better then to beheld in suspense
as long as a man hangs in chains? To be racked with tedious expectation? to
be fed with news like Apes, a bit and a knock? As this day came intelligence of
a great defeat given by our forces to the enemy: next Post tells us of
numerous Recruits come to their Camp, whereby we are never the near; and so the
whole year spends, sometime our own, sometime the enemies Army declining
engagement. What foolish dallying is this? Is this man-fighting? or not rather
child-play? For my part, If when we are well we cannot be content, let us go to
it quickly, agree who shall cut first, fight it out as these lads did, and so
the last man take all: You are like to hear no more of these men I dare say,
for our Author is no Cunctator Fabius, get the better who could, for he would
not build any Castles in the air for either side to retreat to; and truly for
my part, if such a thing must needs be, I am of of our Authors mind, The
sooner over, the better; for though this Bear-heard did not well indeed to set
these people together by the ears, yet he somewhat mended the matter, in
stepping in with his Jacobs-staffe so soon as he did, and parting them: but
then again, he did very ill, to report as he does, that one side had so much
the better of the other: For I spoke with two or three of the North-east Army,
who say, that though they seemed indeed at first to be worsted, Their noses
being more subject to bleeding then other men's, yet they made no question, as
having, they were sure, the longer breath, but to have beaten the other in the
end, would this spectator but have let them alone; which if I had been He, they
should never have feared: But the truth is, there was somewhat in the wind with
our Author, though he very cunningly would seem to anticipate any such,
objection in laying down, There was then no wind at all stirring, yet he being
very much afraid at the horrible product of his own fancy, having sufficiently
Atkinized himself at this General Training, he was glad to lay the spirits, and
hush all up again in quiet; in which sweet pickle, marvel not that I leave him,
and have no more to do with him.

And now put all this together: The unheard of approach, and unexpected
arrival, of these forces, being never before so much as dreamed of; The
causlessnesse of their quarrel, who for ought we yet hear, It being then
Eclipse, fought only as they say for Moonshine: The place of combat in
another guise ground then Callis sands, up in the air: A brave open Country;
The certain cruelty of their fight shooting Stars against one another as fast
as hopps, and making all the kennels in via Lactea, run with blood; And yet at
last, which is the wonder of all, The Harmless Conclusion of the whole, it
being more then probable, there was never a man Killed? And then tell me, If
ever you heard of such a Tragae-Comoediall Romance

THE POSTSCRIPT.
SIR!
YOu may see, though I say it; That I have been very merciful to these Armies,
having only culled a passage, or two out of every Regiment, and made them ride
the Wooden-Horse; For a terror to the rest, All of them having deserved to be
hanged for fighting without Order from the Council of War: It had been very
easy for me to have enlarged my Commentary, but that I have exceeded my
Authors Volume: But by this taste you may perceiv, what a rare subject this
would have been, if some Learned Wire-drawer, or more refined neat-fingred
Spinster would have pleased to have taken it in hand: For I will say that for
our Author, and a fig for him, Though he be no very good worker up; yet he can
cut out more in one hour then ten Journey-men are able to perfect in a month,
or perhaps ever make good. Vale.

A List of some Officers names, of the North-east Army, who were taken
Prisoners by the enemy, for though the relator says they had no Officers at
all: Yet we are to take no great heed to that: Nor do I charge a direct
falsity herein, upon our Author, for we cannot reasonably imagine how he
should well discern them from common Soldiers: or indeed from any thing else,
at so great a distance; And that there were some taken Captives; Himself
expressly declares.
INprimis, Major General Wag-Staffe, not he that danced the Corranto last,
care in the West: nor any thing of Kin to him.

Lieutenant Colonel Shake-speare. A very redoubted Commander.

Mounsieur Through-Goe-Nimble: A French man, General of the Horse; Who Charged
three times (After the rate of of ten Mile an hour,) Through all the
North-west Cavalry.

Splay-foote, Ten-toes Collonell of a Regiment of foot.

Peter Gunner, Master of the Ordnance:

Captain, A' la mort Taken in the heat of the fight; Having been sent the
Night before, with an express: And not as yet returned; to give notice of the
near approach of the armies; And to hasten the coming up of some Forces: who
were already drawn out in Battalia; In the place, where the Battle was sought.

Ensign Scot, a Welsh man.

One Major Spruce. A young Gallant who came thither to have his hair poudred,
and get holes boared in his ears.

Our Author himself too, in the rear, being Secretary General to a Corporal
of Dragoones; But since had his liberty for reporting the business, so much to
the advantage of his Enemies; As he does in his relation.

All these, together with several other The same Persons, whose names are not
yet certified; Are now Close prisoners, In Concavo Lunae.

The Epistle Dedicatorie.
To his Honored Friend -- in Cambridge.
RUmpatur quisquis, etc. I am resolved with your leave, to have my own way in
doing here as I do; for though some may think me mad for giving such hold
against my self, in case the Relator should reply; who perhaps will indite me
of false Heraldrie, for laying Epistle upon Epistle, (as I remember I once
heard him argue the case very learnedly with a Carpenter, who was making a
Wicket in the middle of a great Gate) or which is as bad, send some Pedagogue
with his ferula in his hand, to challenge me with a false Position, in placing
this concluding Preface, in manner as I have done; yet I fear him not, let him
do his worst: Be you Sir pleased to accept of it vultu annuente, it being made,
I assure you, while I my self was nodding, inter sleeping and waking, neither
one nor other; which you will the rather believe by what follows, having, I
protest unto you, been once such a fool as to dream, I must needs be reciting
this May Game in your Schools at the next ensuing Act: And that you may know I
tell you no tale, I still remember some of the Compellatorie Introduction, me
thoughts I then used, which here you have. Reverendissime Procancellarie, cum
toto doctoratus satellitie, hi ovium, caprorum illic, in utramque manum
assidentium. Patres, viri, juvenesque Academici, and so wishing them all good
rest, I proceeded; Mihi diutius excogitanti, qualem ansam, solennitatem vestram
excipere, arrepturus essem, arrisit tandem Novus noster Gallo-belgicus, quae
nunc in toto notissima fabu^a coelo est: And then propounding my question,
which you know I must of necessity do, some one or other, I took this, Omne
gliscens non est aurum; made use of my Author as a medium, and so went on ut
supra, animadvertizing upon his relation, Licet non omnino secundum sormam
statuti, which forbids all Anglicismes: Mine therefore being almost every
word English, and yet I assure you, for those two or three Tipps of the other
Neats-tongue, which you find therein, it had like never to have seen the
light, if the zealous Stationer who printed the other, could have helped, it
being a main reason why he refused to put forth this too himself, whereof I
afterward understood the cause; for that he being a Fifth-monarchie man, could
not away with the language of the Fourth. I never intended to have printed it
at all, but that it being Term-time, there was never a Scrivener, or Lawyers
Clerk in Town at leisure to write it out. (The Relator, if you see him, perhaps
will tell you this was a lie to his knowledge, but believe him not) And for mine
own part, I think it no shame to profess, I can neither write nor read, so
that it could not be otherwise engrossed. Vale.

From my House near Strand-bridg Jan. 26. 1656.
