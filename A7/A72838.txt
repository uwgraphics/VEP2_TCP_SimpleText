The Lovers Gift, Or a Fairing for Maids: Being a Dialogue between Edmund
and Prisilly.
To a pleasant new tune.




Edmund. MY Love she is fair,
su^passin^compare,
More bright, then was Daphne the coy:
Her two starry eyes,
My heart did surprise,
Being struck by the blinded Boy,
See where she does come,
Her sight strikes me dumb,
I Will speak though to speak it grieve me,
My own gentle sweeting
I am glad of this meeting,
Thou know not what I have to give thee.

Prisilly. I pray thee give ore,
Entice me no more,
In suing for love thou do move me.
For I tell thee plain,
I do thee disdain,
I have not the power to love thee:
My answer you know,
You backward may go,
For it is another must shriue me:
Thy face I despise,
for thy great goggle eyes,
I care not what thou have to give me.

Edmund. Thou Joy of my life,
what need all this strife,
Thou know that I love thee more,
Then Piramis,
When Thisby was his,
Who after by a Lion was tore:
Queen Juno did move,
The Olimpicall Jove,
Yet so will not Edmund grieve thee,
I pray thee sweet heart,
Some kind words impart,
Thou know not what I have to give thee.

Prisilly. As Juno did moan
The thunderer Jove,
Prisilly will strive for to move thee,
Thy rusticall words
No matter affoordes,
To make a young maiden to love thee,
Learn wit for to woe
Or I cannot do,
Nor will I in ought believe thee,
I pray thee give ore,
Torment me no more,
I care not what thou have to give me.

Edmund. Why maiden so bright,
My birth do not spite,
For I do not murmr at there,
But think with thy self,
Tho thy father have pelf,
Thy birth cannot equal mine:
Thy virtues does move
Poor Edmund to love,
And still shall if thou will believe me,
Let love not be vain
But love me again,
Thou know not what I have to give thee.

Prisilly. Nay grieve not at this
For what is amiss,
I Will strive for to make thee amends,
To leave off delay,
Faith what would you say,
If you and I joined like friends*
If to your desert
My love I impart,
And that I should fondly believe thee,
I doubt you would prove
Disloyal in love,
And you would that same gift give me,

Second part of the Lovers gift,
to the same tune.




Edmund. Dear sweet would you join,
Your love unto mine,
My love should for ever stand sure,
Or to end the strife
Would thou be my wife,
Like Turtles we both would endure:
There should not proceed
No bad word nor deed,
That should have the power to grieve thee,
We Will live till we dye
Most merrily,
Thou know not what I have to give thee.

Prisilly. Since nothing can shift,
Say what is the gift,
That you upon me would bestow,
And if I do find
It contenteth my mind,
Then more of my love you shall know,
That gift will me move,
To like as I love,
There quickly repeat it to me,
And here I protest,
My heart shall rest,
Thou and I straight will agree.

Edmund. Then if you will agree,
To marry with me,
I Will make thee a Ioynter by the year:
And set down profound
five hundred pound.
And all for the love of my dear:
What a woman can crave,
Be sure to have,
And if that thou durst to believe me,
It Is a gift most rare,
To a maiden so fair,
Lo this is the gift I will give thee.

Prisilly. This gift is of force
To make your recorse,
The easier to my bed,
No longer lets tarry,
But straight let us marry,
And then take my mayden-head:
No longer I can
Live without a man.
Then pray thee sweet heart believe me,
I Will love thee still,
If with a good will.
This pretty gift thou will give me.

Edmund. Then sweeting pray come,
I long till it is done,
To Church let us hie us with speed,
I can when I list,
Procure a blind Priest,
Which for us shall do this same deed,

Prisi. Then sweet let us go,
We must not be slow,
If ever you mean to win me,
But think upon this,
That you do not miss,
This same pretty gift to give me,

Author. Away then they went,
And fulfilled there intent,
Unto their great comfort and joy,
Forty weeks being past
This young wife at the last,
Did bring her young husband a boy,
Heaven send all young wives,
To lead honest lives,
And husbands to live with them kind.
May wives strive to please,
All such husbands as these
That are of so honest a mind.
