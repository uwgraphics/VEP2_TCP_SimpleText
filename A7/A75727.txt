EVen as a Tennis-ball, Man in this world
By various changes up and down is hurled:
Objects of sense, his own lusts, and the Devil
Do daily toss and bandy him to evil:
Where will he fall at last? ah! he must die,
And drop in the Hazard of Eternity.
The Great VENTURE: SHOWING, That Man's Life in this world is a Venture;
wherein he runs the hazard of an Everlasting Estate of Happiness or Misery in
another World, according as he behaves himself here.
O Man! thy God thee made
for an eternal state,
Where both the good and bad
have their appointed fate,
And thou must venture.
What is ordained by Him,
cannot be made void by thee:
Thou must submit to Him,
and stand to his Decree,
And thou must venture.
He has determined,
and in his Word revealed:
Sin shall be punished,
this Word cannot be repealed:
But thou must venture.
Yet He will pardon sin,
being punished in his Son:
For those who here begin
their lives to mend and turn,
And thus will venture.
He tells thee, he does hate
sin, and will vengeance take
Upon the hairy pate
of those who him forsake,
And thus will venture.
But if a sinner will
believe his word, and grace
In Christ accept, now while
it is offered for a space;
And thus will venture.
What Is past he will forgive,
and for the time to come,
As they to him will live,
so he will favor them
Who thus do venture.
It Is left now in thy hand,
and choice what thou will do:
To obey his command,
or after thy lust go:
Each way to venture.
For shortly thou must die,
and then shall surely know,
How far his word is true,
and whither thou must go,
As thou do venture.
Oh that I might advise
thee in this weighty case!
Oh that thou would be wise,
and let my words take place!
In this great venture.
My Counsel is to fear
Gods Majesty, and crave
Mercy at his hands here,
that he thy soul may save,
At the Which will be at the hour of death.
last venture.
Renounce thy will and lust.
Thy self up to him give:
And in his mercy trust,
and to his glory live,
And thi^ ^ay venture.
Though doubtful thoughts arise
and toss thy troubled mind:
Although thy heart no ease,
peace, rest, or hope can find,
Yet this way venture.
Though many ghastly fears
thy conscience terrify:
Though dreadful God appears,
and near despair thou ly,
Yet still thus venture.
Though blasphemy upstarts,
and Atheism in thy breast:
Though Satan shoot his darts,
and thou be sore oppressed;
Yet still thus venture.
Though strong temptations,
provoke thee hard to sin:
And thy corruptions
bestir themselves within:
Yet still thus venture.
Entertain none of these,
against them all still war:
Let no such thoughts thee please
as do with Gods Law jar,
Thus do thou venture.
Can thou do any good,
now while thy soul is here,
Cumber'd with flesh and blood?
to do it don't forbear:
So doing venture.
For unto every man
according to his deeds,
Recompense shall be given,
eternally he speeds,
As he shall venture.
Well then, while it is to day,
what e're thy life has been,
Believe, repent, and pray,
and add not sin to sin:
For thou must venture.
If thou with crosses meet,
and God afflict thee here:
With patience submit,
and his great name still fear.
For thou must venture.
Rage not, do not rebel,
blaspheme not, nor despise
His rod; his holy will
cross not in any wise:
For thou must venture.
To his sweet rest thy Lord
will shortly call thee hence:
And with a rich reward
will crown thy patience,
If thou thus venture.
Ah! an eternal state,
(as thou ere long shall find)
A business is of weight,
to mind it frame thy mind.
And wisely venture.
Not as some desperate fools,
who fondly do presume,
Though they walk by no rules,
it shall go well with them,
Howere they venture.
But he who hopes to find
Heaven in the way to Hell,
Is mad; and in the end
does cast away his soul*
He does not venture.
That man who in Gods way,
walks to eternal bliss,
It Is he alone may say,
There Is hope I shall not miss,
Therefore I Will venture.
Who makes Gods will his Law,
and truly as he can,
Frames himself to obey;
he only is the man
Who rightly ventures.
The wicked venture not,
but desperately throw,
Away their souls for naught,
into eternal woe,
At all adventure.
For they who God renounce,
and now cast off the bond
Of their allegiance
to him, are lost beyond
All peradventure.
Wherefore (O man) be wise,
consider, and forbear:
Do not thy God despise
presumptiously but fear
How thou do venture.
Bethink thy self a while,
Is thy immortal Soul
A thing so cheap and vile,
thou needst not care at all
How thou do venture.
O! know that in thy breast
thou have a pearl of price:
And nothing here possessed
can to its value rise:
Carefully venture.
A Jewel of such worth
is thy immortal soul,
That to it heaven and earth
a trifle we may call:
Don't rashly venture.
And if it once be lost,
alas! it is gone for ever:
And then no pains or cost,
can it again recover:
Oh! fear and venture.
Shall I a reason give,
why thy soul's of such value?
It Is because it must live
in endless joy or sorrow:
As thou do venture.
Then what is a moments pleasure
to endless joy or pain?
What is earths paltry treasure,
to endless loss or gain?
For this don't venture.
What is a bubble here,
a little painted glass,
A gay, but fading flower,
a pile of withering grass?
For this don't venture.
What Is honor, praise and fame,
from men's unconstant breath:
To everlasting shame,
attending thee in death?
For this don't venture.
Oh venture not to lose
thy dear immortal soul,
For such poor things as these,
least thou in hell bewail
Thy foolish venture.
Oh stake not heavens glory,
and an immortal crown,
For things so transitory,
and in a moment gone!
'Twere a mad venture.
Dare thou the hazard run
of everlasting woe:
For a short dream of gain,
fame, pleasure, here below?
A wretched venture!
And have thou not the heart,
a while to play the man:
And with thy base lusts part,
eternal life to gain?
And nobly venture.
Ah! thrice unhappy man,
and strangely desperate fool:
Who venturest to damn,
but not to save thy soul!
Oh cursed venture!
One of the two must be,
for God has sent thee here,
To prove thee, and to try
what course thou wilt choose to steer,
And which way venture.
Therefore sit down, at last
consider, let thy heart
Advisedly forecast,
and choose the better part,
Before thou venture.
Make good use of this season,
look how thou chusest now:
For so shall be thy portion
in endless bliss or woe:
This is thy venture.
Then take the safest course,
for thy Eternity:
Thou can not be the worse
for living virtuously,
If so thou wilt venture.
'Twill be no cause of grief,
at last when thou must die,
In holiness of life,
that thou did patiently
Trust God and venture.
Though it be somewhat hard
as a poor Pilgrim here
His law still to regard,
and mix thy joy with fear,
While thou do venture.
To bring thy will to his,
and thy dear lust forsake:
To bear thy daily cross,
and suffer for his sake:
And thus to venture.
Yet know, the trouble's short,
here is no lasting pain:
It Is but a moments smart,
it cannot long remain,
Take heart and venture.
Joy and eternal Rest
will afterward succeed:
When thou in heaven art blessed,
thou will confess indeed,
'Twas a safe Venture,
'Twas a brave Venture.
Advice to Youth.
GIve him the morning of thy youthful days,
Who did create and form thee for his praise:
God made thee for himself, that he might be
Thine, and thou his; there is thy Felicity.
'Twill be lost time and labor to attend,
What er'e diverts thee from this blessed end:
Hearken, to day he calls thee, and does make
Tenders of Grace; mind it, the blessing take.
This is thy golden season, in thy prime
To make him thine, and give thy self to him:
Oh! miss not this fair opportunity,
Least thou lament it to Eternity.
It Is but accepting what he proffers; bow
Thy will to his: Oh seek him, seek him now!
Come while he calls to day; for why, to morrow,
Who knows but thou may end thy days in sorrow.
This present moment which we now possess,
Is all we have t'ensure our Happiness:
When death has cut this lif's small thread in twain,
'Twill be too late to call time back again.
Youth stained with vice, and lost in vanity,
Unfits for God, ripens for misery:
Hardens the Heart to slight its chiefest good,
Therefore despised, because not understood.
Ten thousand worlds can make no recompense
For Gods lost favor, and times ill expense:
Before the world and lust prevail, Oh give
Thy heart to him by whom thy heart does live.
The longer sin takes rooting in thy heart,
The hardlier 'twill come out, and with more smart:
Delay of seeking thy eternal bliss,
Leaves still less hope thou wilt find, more fear thou wilt miss.
Now heaven, and Christ (who purchased that sweet place)
Are the fair prize of this thy life's short race:
Oh set out then betimes! hold on thy way;
That thou may win this prize make no delay.
Thy days are few, thy trial cannot be long,
Quit thy self bravely, play the man, be strong:
Watch, p^ay, strive hard against devil, world and lust
For daily help in God through Christ still trust.
Then let the grim-fac'd Messenger appear,
Pale Death to thee will bring no cause of fear:
But as thy friend, and fathers servant, come
Both to invite thee, and attend thee home.
Where thy thrice happy soul, Heavens Majesty
Shall see, love, praise, admire, eternally:
Ravished with pure delights, rivers of pleasure,
From Gods sweet presence which shall flow for ever.
An Humble Acknowledgment of Gods free goodness, and our own vileness and
wretchedness.
LOrd! what I am, I am alone by thee,
The most free author of all good to me:
What I find better than the worst of ill,
Is from thy favor, and thy mere good will:
The worst of punishments I have deserved,
Whose heart from thy just Law has ever swerved:
No villainy so base, but I do find
A proneness to it in my wretched mind:
Should thou not punish my offenses, yet
On mischief is my nature so far set,
That I my self-destroyer soon should be,
And find a way to my own misery:
Should thou but leave me to my own hearts evil,
My mind a Hell, my will would prove a Devil:
So, that I do not now the utmost know,
Of wretchedness, to thy mere grace I ow:
Which still forbears my sins due punishment,
And does my utter ruin yet prevent.
The Paradox.
LOrd! must the best fare worst? the good and just
By great afflictions humbled are toth' dust:
Mean while the wicked prosper; they who God
Contemn, yet seel not his afflicting Rod:
Can all this be, and thou yet God above,
Who hat'st the wicked and the just do love?
Thy Providence is strange; yet thou hereby
The just man's Faith and Patience do try.
Of the World.
THe world's a large and public stage, whereon
All act their several parts, and then are gone:
Naught else are acted here but Tragedies;
For in the close of all each Actor dies.
Of the same.
THe World's a Sea, men's passions are the winds,
Which belching from their fierce and boistrous minds
Such tempests cause; that many (being tossed
In storms which they themselves have raised) are lost.
Of Sin.
SIn is the Creatures will opposing Gods,
The Subject with the Sovereign at odds:
Whereby proud man exalts his own base lust,
Above Gods Law, most holy, good, and just.
Of the Law.
SInners toth' Law of God do offer force,
Gods Law to sinners does denounce a curse:
The sinner breaks the Law, and God does thwart:
God and the Law will break the sinners heart.
Of Death.
DEath is the King of Terrors; with his dart
Taking his aim at each man's trembling heart:
A Dragon, whose envenomed fatal sting
Strikes all; and spares not the greatest King:
Death is sins brat, man's bane, Gods curse, hells gate,
To all while in their unconverted state:
But to the just, (by faith in Christ who live,
And seek their chiefest good in things above)
Death's a safe passage into heavenly bliss,
The Gate of Life, the door of Paradise.
Of Christ.
GOds Son became Man, and the Law obeyed,
Its curse he bore, and for our trespass died:
By his death Sinners live, and have access
To God, though Infinite in Holiness
Of Faith.
FAith is the Eye whereby we Christ perceive,
Faith is the Hand whereby we Christ receive:
God freely offers Christ, Faith takes the gift,
As seeing it meant to all who it accept.
Of pardon upon going to Christ
WHen once the Sinners guilty troubled Soul
His lost estate comes to see, and bewail:
And by conviction sensible is made,
That he a Saviors Righteousness does need:
And is made willing from his very Heart,
With his own Works and Righteousness to part:
And he beholding to free Grace alone
For his forgiveness, and Salvation:
And as a weaned Child is well content,
For to receive Christ's Kingly Government:
And become subject to his Royal will,
Ceasing henceforth his own Lust to fulfill:
And so in his own Breast a Law does find,
In some sort ruling his rebellious Mind:
That notwithstanding Folly does remain,
Yet in his Heart Wickedness does not reign:
When Sin Committed moves him to Repent,
And Si^ ^^^emb'red makes him to Lament:
When to be Holy is his Hearts desire,
And in his Actions strives to be sincere;
Though failings very great sometimes appear,
And weaknesses too often here, and there
Do show themselves: which yet are not approved,
But truth still in the inward parts is loved:
And after perfect Grace his Soul does groan,
And for that end would fain to Heaven be gone:
And yet submits to stay Gods leisure here,
And serve him as he can till he come there:
When Sin his burden is become, and he
Would fain like Christ in Grace and Glory be:
Whose failings keep him humble, and thereby
Self-emptied he more need of Christ does see:
Who though he perish, cannot yet afford
While in this World, quite to forsake the Lord:
And cast away his small degree of trust,
And wholly turn from God unto h^s Lust:
But would be kept from Sin, and stand in awe,
And honor in his heart Gods holy Law:
And though his Faith and Hope be often low,
Yet he would venture still on Christ; and throw
Himself a wretched Sinner at his feet,
And self-condemned, mercy still entreat:
The humble Soul which God has brought to this,
Surely can never of it is Pardon miss.
Of Union with Christ: And our advantage thereby.
NO sooner Sin and we do part, but Christ
And we are one; and thus in Union blessed:
For all his blessings ours do become,
While all our Sin, and Curse he takes on him.
Of Holiness.
THe Grace of God revealed for our Salvation,
Merits from us a Holy Conversation:
They most indebted are who are best used,
Love deserves to be served, and not abused.
Of Repentance.
REpentance is a change of Mind and Heart,
Whereby the will from its own will does part:
Sin is our own will pleased, Gods disobeyed:
Repentance, Gods Will pleased, and ours denied:
At least in the desire this will be found,
And true endeavor; if the Heart be sound:
Grief, Tears and Conscience troubles after Sin,
Make no Repentance until this come in.
Of Time.
WHat thing Time is can hardly be defined,
It Is gone while it is but thought of in the mind
Time is that in which all things else are done,
And yet of all things is it self least known:
If 'twere a Body surely then it would
Be seen, felt, heard: our Sense perceive it could:
If 'twere a spirit 'twould immortal be;
But Time spends, and will shortly cease to be:
What then is Time? which all the good and wise
So much esteem of, and so highly prize?
It Is neither Silver, Gold, nor precious Stone,
Above them all, yet it is preferred alone:
It Is that of which all stand in so great need,
And yet from all it flies with greatest speed:
Swifter then Foot, or Wing, or Wind* or Tide,
Or hasty Streams along the Banks which glide:
It Is a short space, wherein each one does treasure
Up for himself Eternal Woe or Pleasure:
It Is but a moment, which spent ill or well,
Brings endless joys in Heaven, or pains in Hell.
Of Eternity.
WHen this short space of Time's expired then we:
(And not before) shall know Eternity:
God no beginning knows, nor end shall see,
He was from, and is to Eternity:
But Men and Angels did begin to be,
They are not from, but to Eternity:
So Man being born, his Life has here a date;
Which done, he goes to his Eternal state.
Wisdom.
VAin Man! Would thou be wise? know Wisdom lies
In things Divine; in Sacred Mysteries:
To know the secrets of thy own vile Heart,
So skilled in Sin, so learned in that Black Art:
To seek and find thy everlasting Good
In Christ; who purchased thy bliss with his blood.
To steer thy course of Life in every action,
Unto Gods Glory, and thy own Salvation:
Hereby thy Soul thou shall't secure,
And future happiness make sure.
Folly
Would thou see Folly in it is deepest dye?
A Fool in grain? then such an one is he
Whose wit's a servant only to his will,
Contriving how he may his Lust fulfill:
Whose chiefest good is but himself to please,
And melt away his days in sloth, and ease:
Who wastes his precious hours in Vanity,
And sleights God, Christ, Heaven, Hell, Eternity:
Who lives as if he had no Soul to save,
And minds not that he is hastening to his Grave:
Close prisoner there in darkness to remain,
Till God to Judgment call him forth again:
A wretch he lives, a wretch he will dye
Snatched hence to Endless Misery.
An Exhortation to all.
LO! Mortal Men of every rank and state,
High, low, rich, poor, young, old, both small and great:
Wisdom and Folly, Life and Death are set
Before your Face; and to your choice do yet
Expose themselves: O Man while thou art here
Be well advised how thou thy course do steer!
What guide thou chusest now, while in the way,
Unto that place where thou must ever stay:
And never return to mend what was amiss
Here, in thy Life's short race to Woe or Bliss:
Take Wisdom for thy guide, thy self commit
To her safe conduct, she thy mind will suit
To walk in Virtues path: and in the way
Of Grace to Glory will thy Soul convey:
O trust not blear-eyed Folly! which does see
Only things present as they seem to be:
If Folly guide thee, know that thy own Will
Blinded by Lust, will lead thee into Hell.
FINIS.
