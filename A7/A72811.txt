To the Honorable House of Commons, commonly called, The Lower House of
Parliament.
The humble Petition of the Masters or Governors of the Mystery and
Comminaltie of Barbers and Chirurgions of LONDON.
MOST humbly showing, That the Petitioners being an Ancient Corporation, and
confirmed, and their Science and Profession consisting not only in outward
practice and experience, but also in the Theorie knowledge of the causes of all
manner of outward Soars, Blanes, Swellings, Impostumations, and the wounds and
causes of the same, and the Symptoms that do follow and accompany them, and
of the natures and qualities of all manner of Salues, Plasters, Balmes,
Ointments, Baths, Poultesses, Waters, Herbs, and all other things fitting the
cure of such diseases, and fit to be ministered or applied for the curing
thereof. And the Petitioners have not only served many years, and been
trained and brought up in the said Art and Science, but have by their study,
practice and experience, attained such knowledge and perfection therein as
tends not only to the maintenance of themselves, their wives, children and
families, but to the great good of the Kings people both by Sea and Land in
their lives and limbs.

Yet so it is, That the Physicians of London (being grave learned men, worthy
of all lawful favor in their own Professions) have of late obtained a Grant
or Patent from his Majesty, whereby they do not only seek to have a
superintendencie over the Petitioners in their own Profession, But also seek
to abridge the Petitioners, and to restrain them from using part of their
Art, which they have studied and served for, and have done and do lawfully
use, and without which many times they cannot perform their Cures, nor give
such ease and remedy to their Patients as is fit they should do; In which
respect the said Grant will be very prejudicial to the Petitioners, and all
his Majesty's Subiests, who shall have occasion to use their help, if the same
should be confirmed by Act of Parliament, as the said Physicians desire.

The humble suit of the Petitioners is, That either no Act may pass for
confirmation of his said Majesty's Grant unto the Physicians; Or if any shall
pass, that the Petitioners may be heard. And if upon hearing, it shall seem
good to this Honorable House a Proviso or saving may be therein contained, that
the Petitioners may not be any way restrained thereby, but may in all things
use their said Profession, as they have heretofore lawfully done, and may
lawfully use the same, And the Petitioners as by duty bound, shall daily pray,
etc.
