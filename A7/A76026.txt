LONDON, Printed for A.N. 1643.

The Copy of a Letter sent from the Mayor of Bristoll, to a Gentleman a friend
of his in London.
Bristoll July 8.
I Do believe you expect something from these Western parts, and well you
may, two Armies having been so near together these many days, on Monday the
Marquess, Prince Maurice, Sir Ralph Hopton, and the Earl of Carnarvan
advanced from Froome to Marchfield, Sir William Waller being then with his Army
on Clarkon hill, near which were some slight skirmishes, which did not hinder
their progress to Marchfield: The next day Sir William Waller marched from
(...) to Lansdowne, where he formed his Army, Sir Ralph Ho^^on on the other
side looked toward Tooghill, where about the leaping-stocke is a plain
leading toward Landsdowne, there being a fall and a l^ne bebetwixt on either
side; They planted their Ordnance, which they shot plentifully at each other
from three in the afternoon, till eleven of the clock at night, which we in
Bristoll heard, and saw them give fire; All this while were several
skirmishes, by several parties of Horse and foot, in which the Parliament
horse behaved themselves bravely, but Sir Ralph Hoptons foot were fane more in
number, and the Cornish excellent fire men at their hedge fight in a little
wood there adj^c^nt there was much powder spent, insomuch that the Cav^liers
h^d but eight barrells left, that we hear of, which was the next morning
following blown up by accident, in which were many killed, many mo^
dangerously hurt, whereof Sir Ralph Hopton was one, who was yesterday carried
in his bed to a Caroach, a miserable spectacle, his head being as big as three,
and both his eyes blinded, besides which he was shot in his aim a day before;
it pleased God to put wonderful courage into the heart of Sir William Waller,
and Sir Arthur Haslerig, the l^st charging with his Regiment the whole body of
the enemy which came up, the Horse being lined with Pike and Musketeers, which
he brake through and did much execution on them, the battle not e^ding till
eleven a clock at night, the one Army retreating into B^th, the other into
Marc^field, the next day I had the first intelligence, by a friend whom the
Marquess kept ^oure or five days, till he had made his composition, so that
he saw all from the beginning to the end, and that he left them in a sad
condition, confessing themselves to have the route, which proves true by the
sequel, for they lost ^ir Beuil Greenvill, Lieutenant Colonel Ward, Sergeant
Major Lower, Captain Basset, Captain sornishant, Captain James, and five
Captains more, and two Captains more with powder, of ordinary men, We know
not the number; seven cart loads of dead men were carried from the place,
diverse wounded, twenty in a house, and not one like to live, and more in other
places they wanted Surgeons much; our dead men being viewed, we cannot yet
find lost above fifteen, whereof only one man of note, which was a Sergeant
major, who was buried here yesterday very honorably; The enemy is advanced
from Marchfield, who rose thence yesterday at ten of the clock, and before
night Sir William Waller was on his persuit after him, so that we trust one
bout more with Gods blessing will give them such a blow, that their entendment
for Oxford may be overthrown.

Master John Ash had his ground well stocked with 60. Cavaliers horses, who
fled from the Army the night after the battle, The horses are safe, and the
men secure.

FINIS.
