Repete these. vi. lines after every sixth line

Every Kingdom,
Both all and some.
That is divided within it self:
Desolate shall be,
Without fear truly
Of God, be in that Commen wealth.
THe first division,
In Paradise begone.
when Satan, the woman tempted:
By whose entisement,
They breeke Gods Co^man^dment
For that they were thence banished.
Spiteful wicked Cayn,
His brother has slain,
Because that Abels sacrifice,
Of God was accepted,
And Cayns neglected,
This mischeife he did devise.
This manslaughtor,
God did abhor,
And cursed wicked Cayn,
He dyed a like death,
Thus scripture says,
At length himself was slain.
Good Seth to auaunce,
Gods Kingdom to enhaunce,
Of him came many holy men,
But Cayns posterity,
For their infidelity,
were drowned in Noes flood then.
They despised God,
All godliness withstode,
In adultery lived they,
In all wilfulness,
In tyranny doutlesse,
For this ensued their dekey.
Of their ill living
God gave them warning,
An hundereth year before
By Noe his servant,
To that they would not grant,
but oppressed the poor much more
And sodeinly came on,
The flood them upon,
And every one there drowned,
Save only that Noe,
And his family,
In the Arc they were all saved.
Thus God preserved,
His Church, figured,
By faithful Noe and his household,
So surely he will.
Preserve them still,
That ^e of his true flock and fold.

Then after this,
The Caldeys,
Builded the tower of Babylon,
But in that building,
God not deliting,
He brought it to destruction.
The first kingdom than,
By Nemrod began,
Among the Babilonians.
Through Idolatry,
And living ungodly,
It came to the Assirians.
Then Sardanapall,
Most lecherous of all,
Of his kingdom was deprived,
For his ill living,
His Office neglecting,
His people were then divided.
Sodom and Gomor,
with.x. Cities more,
Sanke for the sin of lechery,
Therein they were brent,
They would not repent,
They lived so delicatly.
Joseph most prudent,
In his government,
Brought the Egiptians in religion
He set up godly fere,
with Civil good manner.
Of him is right famous mention.
Pharao truly,
For his tyranny,
was drowned in the red sea,
when Moses the capten,
with Gods people then,
Passed clean through that way.
King Roboam,
was a wylfull man.
He set naught by his counsel old,
For diverse things,
To his subjects vndoinges,
To obey them he never would.
Release naught he would,
That he unjustly did hold,
His people went from him a stray.
And a new kingdom,
was there begone,
And set up in Samaria.
The good King Ioas
An holy man was,
As long as Ioiada lived,
But when he did dye,
He set up Idolatry,
and zachari his so^ causde to be killed.
Good king Ezechias,
A godly man he was,
He restorde Gods worship again,
