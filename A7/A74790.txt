Remainder of the LORDS and COMMONS, now sitting at Westminster, in Empty
Parliament, under the Command and Wardship of Sir Thomas Fairfax, Lieutenant
General Cromwell, (our present Sovereign Lord the King, now residing at his
Royal Palace at White Hall) and Prince Ireton his son, and the Army under
their Command.

Containing the many new, large and ample Liberties, Customs and Franchises,
of late freely granted and confirmed to our Sovereign Lord King Charles, his
Heirs and Successors; the Church and State of England and Ireland, and all the
Freemen, and Freeborn People of the same.

New Magna Charta, Cap. 29. Omni vendemus, omni negabimus, aut differemus
Iustitiam, vel recium.

Printed in the Year 1648.

A new Magna Charta.
FIrst for the honor of Almighty God, and in pursuance of the solemn League
and Covenant which we made in the presence of Almighty God for the Reformation
and defense of Religion, the honor and happiness of the King, and the peace
and safety of the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, we have
granted, and by this our present Charter have consirmed, That the Church of
England shall be free to deny the perpetual Ordinances of Jesus Christ, to
countenance spreading heresies, cursed blasphemies, and general looseness and
profaneness, and that all Laws and Statutes formerly made against the
aforesaid offenses for the punishment and restraining thereof shall be utterly
repealed, that so all men may freely enjoy and profess what Religion soever
they please without restraint: And we will that all Archbishops, Bishops, and
their dependents shall be eternally suppressed, and all their Mannours, Lands
and possessions sold to defray and advance the Public Faith. That all
Ministers shall be plundered and thrust out of their livings and freeholds by
our Committee of plundering Ministers without Oath or legal trial, upon bare
informations of such of their Parishioners who are indebted to them for Tithes,
or have any Kinsman to prefer to their livings. And to supply the want of
Ministers, That all Officers, Soldiers, Cobblers, Tinkers, and gifted Brethren
and Sisters, shall freely preach, and propagate the Gospel to the people, and
new dip and rebaptize them without punishment.

Item. We will that the Kings Majesty's person be maintained, and his Authority
preserved, by seizing his Person at Holdenby with a party of horse, and
imprisoning him in the Army, indangering his life at Hampton Court, and by
color thereof conveighing him secretly into the Isle of Wight, removing from
him all his Attendants, disposing of his Revenue, Children, Forts, Ships,
Castles, and Kingdoms, and by this putting in execution these our Votes, That
no more addresses be made from the Parliament to the King, nor any Letters or
Message received from him: That it shall be Treason for any persons whatsoever
to deliver any Message to the King, or receive any Messages or Letters from
him, without leave from both Houses of Parliament: That a Committee draw up a
Declaration to be published, to satisfy the Kingdom of the reason of passing
these Votes, That so the world may bear witness with our consciences of our
Loyalty, and that we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish His Majesty's
just power and greatness, according to the words of the solemn League and
Covenant.

Item, We give and grant to the Freemen of the Realm these Liberties under
written.

First, that no Sheriffs shall make due returns of the Citizens and Burgesses
elected to serve in Parliament, nor make due Elections of Knights, nor in
convenient time, nor the ablest wisest, nor discreetest shall be returned, but
all fraud and deceit shall be used in Elections, and persons not duly elected,
nor elegible by Law shall be Members of the House of Commons, and those to be
our sons, kindred, servants, officers and such as will comply with us.

Item, No Member shall sit in the House of Commons with freedom and safety
that endeavors to settle Religion in the purity thereof, according to the
Covenant, to mantaine the ancient and fundamental Government of the Kingdom,
or to preserve the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, or that lays hold on
the first opportunity of procuring a safe and well-grounded peace in the three
Kingdoms, or that keeps a good understanding between the two Kingdoms of
England and Scotland, according to the grounds expressed in the solemn League
and Covenant.

And whoever offends against this Article, we will that such Members be
impeached of High Treason by the Army, suspended the House before any
particular impeachment, forced to accuse themselves by stating their cases for
want of an accuser, and witnesses to prove them criminal, and at the last cast
out of the House without answer, hearing the evidence, or privity of those that
elected them whose persons they represent.

Item, We grant, that neither we nor any by color of Authority derived from us
shall interrupt the ordinary course of Justice in the several Courts and
Judicatures of the Kingdom, nor intermeddle in causes of private interest
otherwhere determinable, save only our Committees of Indempnities, plundered
Ministers, Complaints, Sequestrations, Excize and the Army, who shall judge and
contradict the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, vacate and repeal all
Indictments, Verdicts, and Judgments given in Courts of Justice, imprison all
manner of persons, and turn them out of their Freeholds, Estates, Goods, and
Chattels without the lawful judgment of their Peers, and against the
fundamental Laws of the Land.

Item, we will and ordain that the great and unusual payments imposed upon
the people, and the extraordinary ways that were taken for procuring moneys,
shall (contrary to the trust reposed in us) be still burdensome, and daily
increased more and more upon the people by our bare Votes and Ordinances,
without the common consent by Act of Parliament; and in case of refusal,
forcibly levied by Troops of horse and soldiers, according to the law of
decolled Strafford, of all which moneys our selves and Members will be sole
treasurers and disposers: Free Quarter shall be still tolerated, and
countenance given by us to the exactions and extortions of the soldiers, to
whom we have granted an Ordinance of Indemnity for all murders, fellonies,
rapes, robberies, injuries and trespasses committed by them, and all such
offenses as they shall commit, to the end they may protect us against the
clamours and complaints of the oppressed people either by Sea or Land: and we
ordain, that all Freemen shall henceforth be tried only by Martial and
Committee Law, and impeached of new high Treason at our pleasure, to consiscate
their estates to our Exchequer.

Item, We will that such persons as have done valiantly, and dealt faithfully
in the Parliaments cause according to the Declaration of England and Scotland,
shall be publicly disgraced and dishonored, and without cause thrust from
their commands and employments both Civil and Martial without pay, hearing
conviction or reparation for their losses, and that the several and respective
Lievtenants, Governors, and old Garrison Soldiers of the Tower of London,
Newcastle, York, Bristoll, Plymouth, Gloucester, Exeter, Chester, Pendennis
Castle and the Isle of Wight be removed with disgrace by our new
Generalissimoes mere arbitrary power, notwithstanding our former Votes and
Ordinances for their particular settlement, and new mean seditious Sectaries of
our confederacy put into their places.

Item, We will that a just difference be made between such persons as never
departed from their Covenant and duty, and such as were detestable Newtralists
and oppressors of the people, and to that end we will, that the Commission of
the Peace be renewed at the pleasure of our flying Speakers, who are to
provide, that such be omitted as agree not with the frame and temper of the
Army and us their Lords and Commons sitting at Westminster, and others be added
in their places who have complied with the enemy, and oppressed the people, and
to that end we agree, that the Earl of Suffolk, Earl of Middlesex, William
Lord Maynard, William Hicks, Knight and Baronet, John Parsons Knight, Richard
Pigott Knight, Edward King Esquire, Thomas Welcome Esquire, and diverse others
be omitted, and that John Lockey, Thomas Welby, William Godfrey, Richard
Brian, Sir Richard Earl Baronet, and others of that stamp be added, of whose
integrity and faithfulness Quere.

Item, We will that for the perpetual honor of the Lords and Barons of this
Realm, whose Ancestors purchased for us with the expense of their lives and
bloods from King John and Henry the third, the great Charter, that they shall
from henceforth be impeached of High Treason, committed, imprisoned, and put
out of the House of Peers, and forfeit their lives and estates to our
disposing, if they defend that great Charter, the lives and Liberties of the
Subjects and Parliament against a perfidious and rebellious Army, and us the
fugitive Lords and Commons, who fled from our Houses to the Army without cause,
and there entered into a traiterous Covenant and Engagement, to live and die
with the Army, and to destroy the faithful Members that stayed behind at
Westminster, and all the freedom of this and future Parliaments. And we will
that henceforth there shall be no House of Peers, distinct from Commons, but
that all Peers and Peerage be for ever abolished, and all great and rich men's
estates levelled and made equal to their poorest neighbors, for the better
relief and encouragement of the poor Saints.

Item, We will that the City of London shall have all her ancient Liberties and
Customs in as full and ample manner as her Predecessors ever had, and for that
end we will that the Army shall march in a Warlike manner toward that City,
and pass like Conquerours in triumph through the same. That all the
Fortifications and Line about it shall be slighted and thrown down, the Tower
taken out of their hands, and put into our Generals, and fortified to overawe
them; the Militia of the City changed and divided from that of Westminster, and
Southwarke, the Lord Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen and some leading men of the
Common Counsel, by crafty, sinister, and feigned informations, impeached of
high Treason, and other great Misdemeanors imprisoned and disabled, and others
by our appointment and nomination put into their places, and the Citizens and
Common Counsell-men shall henceforth make no free Elections of Governors and
Officers: That White Hall, the Muse, Minories, Ely-house and other places shall
be made Citadells, that the Posts and Chains in the City and Suburbs be taken
away, their Gates and Purcullices pulled down, their Arms delivered into a
common Magazine by our appointment, to disable them from all future possibility
of selfe-defence, or disobedience to our imperial commands, that so they may
willingly deliver us up the remainder of their exhausted treasures and estates,
when we see cause to require the same, and made as absolute Freemen for all
their expense of treasure and blood in our defense, as our English Gally-slaves
now are in Algier.

Item, We will that the command of the Navy and all ships at Sea, for the
honor of this Nation and our own, be committed into the hands and government
of a Vice Admiral, (without and against the consent of the Lords) of late but
a Skippers Boy, a common Soldier in Hull, a I eveller in the Army, impeached
by the General for endeavoring to raise a mutiny at the late Rendevouz, and
since that taken with a Whore in a Bawdy house, who rode down in triumph to
the Downs to take possession of his place in a Coach and four horses, with a
Trumpeter and some Troopers riding before and after it, sounding the Trumpet in
every Town and Village as they passed, to give notice of his new Excellencies
arrival, and make the common people veil Bonnet, and strike sale to his
Coach, and at his late return from the Isle of Wight to the Downs was rowed
from the ship to the Town of Deal with the Ensign in the stern, the
Boatswaine and all the Rowers bare headed, like so many Gally-slaves, (a new
kind of state which never any Lord-Admirall in England, though the greatest
Peer, yet took upon him, but the King only:) and to maintain this new pomp
and state of his we will and ordain, that all Merchants, as well Natives as
Forraigners, shall pay such new Customs, Impositions, and Excize for all
manner of goods and Merchandise whatsoever imported, or exported, as we in our
arbitrary wisdoms shall judge meet, under pain of forfeiture of all their
said goods and Merchandise, and such other penalties as we shall impose.

Item, We will and ordain for the ease and relief of the almost famished
poor in these times of dearth and decay of Trade, that Excize shall still be
paid by them, and every of them for every drop of small beer they drink, and
for all oils, dying stuffes, and Mercers wares they shall have occasion to use
about their Trades and Manufactures, and that the lusty young soldiers, who
are able to work and get their livings by the sweat of their brows, shall
ramble abroad through all the Kingdom, and like so many sturdy rogues, take
Free Quarter for themselves, horses and companions from place to place,
refusing to work, shall eat up all the provisions in Gentlemen's, Yeomens,
Clothyers, and other rich men's houses, who formerly relieved the impotent poor
with their Alms, and the able with work.

Item, We will that William Lenthall our Speaker for the time being, shall have
a Monopoly and plurality of all kind of Officers, for the maintenance of his
state and dignity, and recompense of his infidelity, in the deserting the true
House of Commons, notwithstanding the selfe-denying Ordinance to the contrary,
and to this end we ordain, that he shall be our perpetual Speaker, and
eternally take five pounds for every Ordinance that passes the Commons House,
with all other incident (new exacted) fees and gratuities; that he shall with
this his office enjoy the custody and profits of the great Seal of England,
the Duchy of Lancaster, together with the Mastership of the Rolls, and as many
other places as we shall be able to confer upon him or his son; and that
his honored brother Sir John Lenthall for his great affection to and care of
the Subjects Liberties committed to his custody, shall have free license to
suffer what prisoners he pleases to escape out of prison, and Sir Lewis Dives
though Voted by us to be arraigned and tried for high Treason this Term, and
all persons lying in execution for debts to go and lie abroad at their own
houses, and make escapes at pleasure to the defrauding of Creditors, without
being prosecuted, or put out of his office for the same, provided they always
give him a good gratuity for this their liberty of escape.

Item, We will that our distressed Brethren in Ireland may enjoy the benefit of
this our new great Charter, and all the liberties therein comprised, and that
by virtue thereof the supplies, reliefs, men, moneys, and the monthly Tax of
sixty thousand pounds designed for them, shall be totally interrupted,
misimployed, and diverted by King Crumwell and Prince Jreton his son-in-law, to
maintain, pay and recruit their Supernumeraries and the Army here: That the
noble and valiant Lord Inchequin who has done such gallant service against the
Rebels, shall be accused and blasted in both our Houses and Pamphlets, and
mercenary Diurnall men for a Traitor, and Confederate with the Rebels, by the
Lord Lisle and his confederates, who wears much of Irelands imbezelled treasure
on his back, and has much more of it in his purse, taking no less then 10. l.
or 15. l. a day, as Lord Deputy of that Realm, only for riding about London
streets in his Coach in state, and victorious honest Col. Jones
discountenanced, discouraged, and both of them removed this Spring from their
commands, to advance the Independent cause, and godly party in that Realm.

Lastly, all these new Customs and Liberties aforesaid, which we have granted
to be holden in our Realms of England and Ireland, as much as appertains to
us we shall observe: and all men of these Realms, as well Nobles as Commons,
shall enjoy and observe the same against all persons in likewise. And for this
our Gift and Grant of these Liberties, the Nobles and Commons are become our
men from this day forward, of life and limb, and of earthly worship, and unto
us shall be slaves and vassalls for ever; and we have granted further, that
neither we nor any of us shall procure or do any thing, whereby all or any the
Liberties in this Charter contained, shall be ever hereafter infringed or
broken: and further we ordain, that our Postmaster Edmund Prideaux, one of our
fugitive and Army-ingaged Members, who byfraud got into that office, and keeps
it by force against common right, do send Posts with Copies of this our Charter
into all Counties, Cities and Places of our Dominions, for recompense of which
service he shall still conciously enjoy that office, and that our Sheriffs,
Committees, and newmade Justices cause the same to be speedily published
accordingly in all our Countrey-Courts, these being our witnesses to this
Charter.

William Lawd L. Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Earl of Strafford, Sir John
Hotham Knight, Governor of Hull, Lievtenant-Generall John Hotham,
All four beheaded by our command at the Tower Hill for the breach of old
Magna Charta and treachery.

Nathanael Fines, condemned to lose his head by a Council of War for
delivering up Bristoll to our enemies, by us to be one of the Grand Committee
forth safety of this and yet spared Kingdom and Ireland, instead of the
exploded Scotch Commissioners.

FINIS.
