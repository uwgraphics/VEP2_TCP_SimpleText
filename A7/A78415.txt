A CAVEAT FOR KNAVES.

You pearlesse Peers, that sit in Parliament,
as many of you as have Traitors been,
Beware least that too late you do repent
your unjust dealings with your sovereign King.
Let all of you upon your knees fall down,
and re-inthrone him with his Princely Crown;
So may you gain free pardon for your lives,
and live in peace, whence plenty will arise.
Printed in the Year, 1648.

A CAVEAT FOR KNAVES:
THere has been an old saying of a great while since, that the World runs upon
wheels, which were it true, then every spoke (as we call it) would have his
part, and bear his part; but I believe that it rather runs like a Crab, al
upon one side, as it has done the time of an Apprentiship with the Parliament;
and now Sir is not the Parliament the world, or is the Independent Army, that
has of a long time over-awed and tutored the Parliament, the world; or is Mrs.
London that has by her stretched out Purse to maintain them both, the world;
as for my part, if you will have my opinion, they are all as one, they are
joint partners in the world, and cannot be severed, but as one body they carry
on this wicked world at their pleasure, and not one body alone, but three
bodies, and as they are three bodies, yet there is but one head, that is, the
Head Parliament, why yes there is the head Army too, I and the head London
purse too, and what can either of them do one without the other? for whatsoever
the head Purse does, or what the head Army, although a holy sanctified saintly
one, does do, or pretend to have done, will come to nothing without the head
Parliament concur, and by her Vote or Ordinance make good: and so I conclude
that the Parliament is the head, purse London the bit or ^naffle in the mouth
of the same head, and the Army the raines to govern that head, and so there is
no other now visible head to govern this wicked Kingdom, but these three in
one head. And I truly for my part must confess that this wicked Kingdom has
bin too long, and too much governed by this triple headed Hidron or in plainer
terms, this three headed monster, for in my small judgment, there are none but
monsters that will run on headlong in wickedness, and never look beck unto the
great God who should be all our heads, nor unto their King, who immediately
under God should be our chief head, or unto their old head the true long
professed Protestant Religion, which so long time has flourished in England: But
now alas this head Parliament is broken, their wicked ulcers of Rebellion and
extortion, stink in the nostrils of men and there is no balm in Gilead to be
administered unto them, nor no plaster, but his Majesty's royal Pardon to cure
this broken head; then unto him that we have so rebelled against, and have most
offended, and most injuriously wronged, let us now fly for succor, and instead
of ropes about our necks, present repentent sorrow in our hearts, crave pardon
for our lives, and hazard the loss of our estates, (which if we do) it will
be greater mercy and favor than ever we deserved, having not shown neither to
him nor his the like favor, but he is merciful, his mercy will exceed our
inhumane cruelty: But stay, let us first see how far our power will stretch,
and our purse and persuasions of our party will serve to pleasure us, and to
continue war a little longer, and maintain our Kingly places, let us
continue, blinding the kingdom as long as we are able, with dallience and
delays, sue for Petitioners in private, and then answer them and all other at
our own pleasure, put them off with the accustomed phrase of rendering them
thanks for their continual respect toward the houses, and tell them we are
using al ways and means we can for the settling of a safe, and wel-grounded
Peace; or satisfy them as we did the Commanders of the rained-bands of London,
that we will hear what the Common Council says in their behalf, and
whether they are of the same mind; and then if they be, we will speedily give
you an Answer at our own leisure: but first let us see how we shall be secured
by them, to sit safe in our Kingly places, and also under pretense of caring
for the King, let us require from them the safety of his Majesty's person in
London, and that there may be a visible way prescribed for it, and then we will
consider of a way to send for him: and in the mean space we shall see what our
juggling Mephostapholisses will do for us, our flying spirits that we have
employed both a broad and at home, how they will prevail in their perswations,
and what forces may be raised for our safety, and desending of our evil cause,
we are sure that the Independent party will rise for us both abroad and at
home, for they are as deeply concerned in the danger as our selves, and if
Purse London will be brought to continue our friend st^^, we may chance to
continue our Kingly power; we have to this purpose made an Ordinance already,
giving powes u^^o Major General Skipton, to use what means he may to raise
what forces he can in and about London, to su^due the Royal party hereabouts,
or as many of them as he can c^tch, (...) to kill, hang, or murder them at his
pleasu^e not asking the Lord leave, nor use any mercy at all: and indeed (...)
no great marvel that you should now continue merciless (...) practiced
nothing but cru^lty so long a time; but (...) the word of God, do as thou wilt
be do^e unto and it (...) then remember the old Proverb, harm watch, ha^^ (...)
look what you have done, will be done to you (...) though you be three heads
yet (^and great (...) ber whose heads you are, and unto whom (...) heads, and
must give an account, and if you be not (...) then see your own errors, see
with a judicious eye, the woeful miseries that you have brought this poor
Kingdom unto already, and the miserable conditions that this poor distressed
Kingdom is like to fall into, by your overswaying, unlimited powers, nay if you
will ever take warning, and look about you, now is the time, take heed, beware
of a relapse, for if you persist, you are gone, therefore dally no longer, send
for His Majesty without delay, provide for him with honor, freedom and safety,
grant him his desires, let him have his own guard, and his own attendents,
freely without compulsion, let him treat with you face to face, or with as
many of you as dare to look him in the face: do you not see the eminent danger
that you are in? do you not see destruction before your face? your own houses
divided, nay some of your households divided one against another, the Kingdom
in general risen up against you, all Christian Princes deriding you, the
Seamen scorning to do you any more service, Purse London shaking you off by
degrees, refusing to disgorge any more bags to support you any longer, London
Trained-bands ready to forsake you, your dear brethren the Scots ready to
devour you, for falsifying your Oath to your King, your Covenant with them and
the two Kingdoms, and the severe judgment of God, threatening ruin and
destruction for your damnable devilish dealings, upon this most miserable
kingdom; and if none of these will prevail, then look unto the handy-worke
of the Lord, in raising such sudden and unexpected Armies in his Majesty's
behalf, the unthought of store of Arms and Ammunition, the multitude of
Garrisons taken and rendered up for the Kings Royal Majesty's use, the multitude
of Shipping, the fortunate successes that his Majesty's small forces have
continunally had, if truth might be believed, and right take place, which will
be hard for to make the world to believe, they have been so long blinded with
lies, however it is now visible to us here, by the multitude of your maimed
Soldiers that are brought into the Hospitals in London, that there has been
many of your Saints cut off, your invincible Army is much weakened, your Saints
are amazed, your wounded men curse ye, and vow that were they as well as ever
they were they would never serve you, your sound men wish that they had but
half their Arreares, they would curse you to your face, and tell you that you
are but blind guides, and have been the ruinning of many a soul; and if your
friends reward you thus, what shall you exspect from those that you call your
enemies? and at the latter days what may you exspect from the just severe God?
But you are Saints, whether God will or not, and you will make the world
believe that God gives you a daily blessing, or else your intelligence lies,
with great Victories, Langdale he is totally routed, and the party that was in
Lincolnshire for the King clean dispersed, not two to be seen together, ask
Walkers imperfect Occurrence else, and he shall make all the world to believe
it, the Scots too they are so far together by the ears themselves, that they
cannot come in against us, have not we Letters daily to that effect? Yes I must
needs confess that you have Letters as from thence, although made in the
Inner Temple; for I will justify that one Gentleman there made three Letters
himself in one day, and they must come from Scotland: and are not all these
routing Letters of the same stamp? how can there be 4000 Soldiers spared out
of Lancashire to recruite Lambert? when it is not able to withstand the Lord of
Darbies forces that is now there: and what County is there in England now, that
you may spare any out, or that is able to defend themselves? and for believing
experience look here at home into every county about you, and you shall plainly
see the good affection of them unto their King, and so by these you may plainly
discern the rest; they are not mean men that are the Leaders of them neither,
as yours are, Brewers, Shoomakers, Tailors, Weavers, Tinkers, Cobblers, but they
are Dukes, Earls, Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Commanders most of them, and
as soon as ever that the Prince is once seen to set foot in England, how many
thousands more in England will there then appear and rise against you? o ye
of little faith, it is not the Independent Army, nor the so many thousand hands
that you have presented unto you to have no King, nor no Personal Treaty, that
can defend you, nor all the Devils in hell to boot to help you, if the Lord but
once lift up his hand against you, as you may now apparently see he begins to
do, by stirring up the hearts of all the Country against, and for every
thousand of Independents that stick unto you, you will have five thousand of
good Christians against you, and therefore repent and amend, least it be too
late, and the Devil tear you in pieces.

FINIS.
