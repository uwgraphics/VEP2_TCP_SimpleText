An Account of the Design of Printing about 3000 Bibles in Irish, with the
Psalms of David in Meter, for the use of the Highlanders.
THE Inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland, have never had the Bible in
their own Language, which is the Irish: Some endeavors have formerly been used
in Scotland, to have it Printed in that Language, but hitherto they have proved
unsuccessful.

Of late, the Honorable, Learned, and Pious Mr. Boil has, at great charge,
caused to be Printed 500 Bibles in Irish, which were designed for Ireland, and
accordingly most part of them, especially the New-Testaments, were by him sent
thither: Of the Books of the Old Testament which remained, he sent above 200
into the Highlands, which made one Book for each Parish, there being so many
Parishes in the Highlands, and those of very large extent, containing great
Numbers of People.

The same Excellent and Worthy Person, was at the Charge of Printing for the
use of the Highlanders, 3000 Catechisms and Prayer-Books in Irish, with some
Passages of Scripture, containing the principal Heads of the Christian
Religion, they never having had any such helps before. He has also lately
given money to reprint as many more.

All sorts of People among them express an extraordinary joy upon occasion of
this great and unexpected Charity to their Souls, and do earnestly desire to
have another Impression of the Bible in Irish for themselves, and for their
Children, that by Reading, and Hearing of that Sacred Book, they may be
delivered from Ignorance and Barbarity.

The Money collected for carrying on the Work, is to be deposited with the
Reverend Dr Horneck, who has been pleased Charitably to accept of the trouble
of receiving it.

Several worthy Persons both of England and Scotland, have promised their
Concurrence, and signified the Proportions they intend to give, of whom also
not a few have already sent their Money to Dr. Horneck, at his House in
Exeter-street, who has a List of their Names, with the Sums of Money they have
Subscribed or sent.

The Person employed for the Printing of this Bible, is Robert Everingham, at
the Seven Stars in Ave mary-Lane, nigh Paternoster Row.

There is a Minister to come shortly from the Highlands, to attend the Press;
who likewise, by the Advice and with the Concurrence of other Discreet and
Pious persons, both of the Laity and Clergy in Scotland, is to distribute among
the poorer sort of Highlanders, those Books which are subscribed for by some
Charitable Persons of this Kingdom.

As for the Books which are Subscribed for by those of Scotland, they are
likewise to be bestowed on poor People, so far as is needful; and as for the
Money which shall be got from those Highlanders, who are able to buy Books for
themselves, it is to be kept in store as a Fund for another Impression of the
Bible in Irish, or for Printing some such useful Treatise in that Language, as
shall afterward be thought most proper.

The Names of those who have given, or promised to give Moneys, toward the
Printing the Bible in Irish for the use of the Highlanders.
