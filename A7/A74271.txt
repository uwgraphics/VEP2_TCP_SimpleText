ANNO XVII. Caroli Regis.
An Act for the Relief of the Captives, taken by Turkish, Moorish, and other
Pirates, and to prevent the taking of others in time to come.
WHereas many thousands of your Majesty's good and loving Subjects with their
Ships and goods, have of late time been surprised and taken at Sea (as they
were in their lawful trading) by Turkish, Moorish, and other Pirates; And some
of them, to free themselves of the cruel and barbarous usage of those Pirates,
have renounced the Christian Religion, and turned Turks; And others yet kept in
bondage, are used with so extreme cruelty, as they are in great danger thereby
to lose their lives, unless they shall also forsake the Christian Religion:
And diverse of those Your Subjects kept in bondage (being expert and skillful
Mariners) are usually employed at Sea against others Your good Subjects, and
prove very prejudicial to them, and hurtful to the Trade and Merchandise of
Your Majesty's Dominions: And whereas, as well Your Majesty's Subjects, as
strangers Exporting, or Importing their Goods and Merchandise into this
Kingdom, have ever sithence Your Majesty's access unto this Crown, been
charged with the payment of great sums of Money, under the name of Custom, and
that without consent of Parliament, which had they been legally taken, ought to
have been chiefly employed to the safeguard of the Seas, and preservation of
Your good Subjects in their Trade of Merchandise from the spoil of Pirates, and
other Sea-robbers, but have been exhausted by evil Ministers, and not applied
to their proper uses, so that Your Highness good Subjects have been exposed to
the merciless cruelty of those Pirates, and barbarous Infidels.

And the Commons taking into further consideration Your Majesty's pressing
wants, and great occasions of Moneys in these times of distemper, as well in
the Kingdom of Ireland, as other Kingdoms of Foreign Princes, so that there
will be required some further aid to enable Your Highness to effect so great a
Work, besides the present Tunnage and Poundage now granted to Your Majesty:
Have therefore for this present pressing occasion, and for a time hereafter
limited, taken into their Resolutions a further way of raising a Supply of
Moneys, for the providing and setting forth to the Seas a Navy, as well for
the enlargement and deliverance of those poor Captives in Argier, and other
places, if Almighty God shall so please to give that Blessing unto their
enterprises, as also for the preventing of the like future dangers unto Your
good people, their Persons, Ships, and Merchandises; Do therefore pray Your
most Excellent Majesty, That it may be Enacted, and be it Enacted by authority
of this present Parliament, That where any Subsidy, Custom, or other duty,
after the nine and twentieth day of September, in the year one thousand six
hundred forty one, and before the four and twentieth day of June then next
following, shall be laid or imposed by authority of Parliament, upon any Goods,
Wares, or other Merchandise, of what nature, kind, or quality soever, to be
Exported out of, or Imported into this Your Majesty's Realm of England, or
Dominion of Wales, That one other sum of one in the hundred, according to the
Rates to be established by Parliament, within the time aforesaid, over and
above the said Custom, Subsidy, or duty, so to be laid or imposed, shall be
raised, levied, and paid, from, and after the tenth day of December, in the
year one thousand six hundred forty one aforesaid, of and from all and every
such goods, wares and other Merchandise, to be imported into, or exported out
of this Your Majesty's said Realm of England or Dominion of Wales, the said
sum of one in the hundred to be raised, levied and paid for the space of
three years next after the said tenth day of December, and no longer; And
received and taken by the Lord Major and Chamberlain of London for the time
being, their Deputies, or Deputy, and by them the said Lord Major and
Chamberlain of London, for the time being, to be laid out, paid and employed
for providing and setting out to sea and maintaining of one or more Fleet or
Fleets of good and serviceable ships, and other necessaries to be used and
employed for the purposes aforesaid, in such sort as by Order of a Committee of
the House of Lords, and a Committee of the House of Commons in Parliament of
this Your Majesty's Realm of England shall be directed. And such Lord Major and
Chamberlain of London, who shall receive or disburse any the moneys aforesaid,
shall be accountable and account for all, and every their receipts and
disbursements before mentioned, to the said Committee, or to such person or
persons, as the said Committee shall Order and appoint.

And be it also enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any goods, wares or
other Merchandise, whereof the sum of one in the hundred aforesaid is or shall
be due and paiable by virtue of this Act, shall at any time hereafter be
shipped or put into any Boat or other Vessel, to the intent to be carried into
the parts beyond the Seas, or else be brought from the parts beyond the Seas
into any part of this Your Realm of England or Dominion of Wales, by way of
Merchandise, and unshipped to be laid on land, the sum of one in the hundred
as aforesaid, due or to be due for the same, not paid or lawfully tendered and
secured to be paid to the Major and Chamberlain of London, for the time being,
or their Deputy, or Deputies for the uses aforesaid; all the same Goods, Wares,
and other Merchandise whatsoever, shall be forfeited and lost; The one Moity of
the rate or value thereof, to be to him, or them, that will seize, or sue for
the same; and the other Moitie to be employed to, and for the uses before
expressed.

And for the better encouragement of Mariners to undertake the said service,
and Owners of Ships to let out their Ships for the said employment, Be it
further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Ships, goods, or
Merchandise of the said Pirates, or of the subjects of any that are, or shall be
in enmity with your Majesty, your Heirs or Successors; or the Person of any
such Pirates shall be taken by the Ships, to be employed in the service before
mentioned, that one fourth part thereof shall be to the Mariners that shall
take the same, and one other fourth part to the Owners of the said Ships, over
and above their Hire, and Wages; and the other two fourth parts, to, and for
such uses, as the said Committees shall order and appoint; and the overplus of
the Money to be raised by virtue of this Act, and not employed to, and for the
service before mentioned (if any shall be) shall also be employed according to
the Order of the same Committees.

And be it further Declared and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, that this
present Act for the raising of Moneys for the setting forth of Ships for the
suppressing of Pirates, and safety of Merchants, shall not hereafter be drawn
into example, but that Your Majesty would in time to come, be pleased to in
trust such Ministers, as may faithfully employ the Moneys raised by Tonnage and
Poundage unto the right and proper uses, for the guarding of the Seas, and
safety of Merchants, which will advance the Honor of Your Sacred Majesty
abroad, and procure the safety, peace, and happiness of Your Highness loyal
and faithful subjects at home.
