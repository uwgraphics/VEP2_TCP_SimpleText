From the Guildhall they marched in an orderly Train on foot, only the Lord
Major leading them in his Coach to the Court at Whitehall, and were instantly
received into the Banqueting House. His Majesty at their coming being in
debate of some inportant affairs at the Council, was pleased in much favor to
send a Person of quality, and after him several other Gentlemen one after
another, to acquaint them with that occasion, and to bespeak their attendance
till the same would permit his absence from the Council: Notwithstanding, it
pleased his Majesty after a little while to spare himself from those Affairs at
the Council; and with great show of Princely favor and regard to receive the
Papers of Address into his own hand, being presented by the Lord Major after he
had delivered himself in this affectionate Speech.

THE Lord Major's Speech.
May it please your Majesty.
I came accompanied with these Your Officers who command all Your London Forces
both Horse and Foot: Pointing at them severally.
Here stand those that command Your Horse, these Your Trained Bands, The other,
Your Auxiliaries; when Your Majesty has taken aright view of them, You will
see Loyalty linked in an unchangeable Chain; these are they who will not swerve
from what they swear, that is fealty without falsity, and it were a shame not to
do so; seeing we sow in peace and reap the plenty which springs from so
excellent a Governor, so good a Government: if You please to see our hearts,
these lines lead to them, and speak for them, which I here humbly present unto
Your Sacred Majesty in their names and under their hands, Beseeching Your
Majesty to accept them as a dutiful return of those many signal favors
vouchsafed by Your Majesty to Your native City and Loyal Citizens.

Whereunto his Majesty replied, That he had stolen a time from very important
Affairs, on which He was in debate with his Council, to come to them; and gave
a most gracious answer, declaring His good esteem of them; His kind resentment
of their Address; His assured confidence in their faithfulness; His readiness
and desire to advance the welfare of the City; and many other expressions full
of Princely goodness and affection.

And after all this, was further pleased that night to send a worthy Gentleman,
Clerk of the Council, to the Lord Major, to give notice that His Majesty
intended the nextday to send down some Lords of his Council to make a more
ample signification of his Majesty's gracious acceptance of the Address, and to
require a meeting of the Commanders and Officers for that purpose: But their
Lordship being prevented by the Lords Commissioners sitting for claims at the
Coronation, sent to excuse their personal coming by a Messenger to the Lord
Major, who also brought his Majesty's gracious Letter in these words.

CHARLES R.

TRusty and welbeloved, We Greet you well. We have received your Address,
wherein you do not only give Us a full and acceptable Demonstration of your
Duty, Love, and Loyalty to Us (which We do Graciously accept) but also show
forth an Eminent Example thereof to all other Our good Subjects within Our
Kingdoms and Dominions. You may be assured that as Our Royal Progenitors have
always had a particular and extraordinary kindness for that Our Capital City,
so We shall not come behind any of them in Our Princely care to make the same
both flourishing and secure at home, and Glorious and Renowned abroad. And so
we bid you farewell. Given at Our Court at White Hall this third day of April
in the 13th year of Our Reign.

By his Majesty's Command, WILL. MORICE.

To Our Trusty and Welbeloved Sir Richard Brown Knight and Baronet, Lord Major,
and Major General of Our City of London, to be Communicated to the Field
Officers and Captains, with all the Inferior Officers of the several Regiments
of the Trained Bands, the Regiments of Horse, and the Regiments of Auxiliary
Fortes of our said City.

Which being read in presence of all the Field Officers made deep impressions
of his Majesty's Grace, and favor upon their minds and drew forth all
answerable acknowledgments in outward expressions, which they ordered presently
to be represented to His Majesty by Sir Richard Ford, Sir William Vincent, and
Sir Thomas Player, and directed them to beg of His Majesty this Boyal addition,
that they might publish in print the Narrative of the whole passage of their
dutiful Address, and the most gracious reception thereof by his sacred Majesty
for the just support of those good Subjects whose loyal affections attended
that Remonstrance, and at once to stop the mouths of those who detracted from
the Royal acceptance of it, and to encourage them (if they have any sense of
Duty and Honor) to outdo the Remonstrants in the like real profession of their
bounden duty; for which the said Officers shall both love and honor their new
Rivals, and in all amity and mutual affections keep pace with them, if they can.

Which His Majesty was graciously well pleased to approve of, and consent that
His Royal Letter, and all the preceding passages should be made public.

FINIS.
