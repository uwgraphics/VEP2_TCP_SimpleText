The Cavaleers Complaint.
To the Tune of, I tell Thee DICK, etc.
The Cavaleer's Complaint.
COme Jack, let us drink a Pot of Ale,
And I shall tell Thee such a Tale
Will make thine Ears to ring:
My Coin is spent, my Time is lost,
And I this Only Fruit can boast,
That Once I saw my KING.
But This does most afflict my mind,
I went to Court, in hope to find
Some of my Friends in Place;
And walking There, I had a fight
Of all the Crew: But, by this Light,
I hardly knew One Face!
S'life, of so many Noble Sparks,
Who, on their Bodies, bear the Marks
Of their Integrity,
And suffered Ruin of Estate;
It was my damned unhappy Fate,
That I not One could see!
Not One, upon my Life, among
My old Acquaintance, all along
At Truro, and before;
And, I suppose, the Place can show
As few of Those, whom Thou did know
At York, or Marston-moore.
But, truly, There are swarms of Those,
Who lately were our chiefest Foes,
Of Pantaloons and Muffes;
Whilst the Old rusty Cavaleer
Retires, or dares not once appear
For want of Coin, and Cuffes.
When none of These I could descry,
Who, better far deserved; Then I
Calmely did reflect;
Old Services, (by Rule of State)
Like Almanacks, grow out of Date,
What then can I expect?
Troth, In contempt of Fortunes frown,
I Will get me fairly out of Town,
And, in a Cloister, pray,
That, since the Stars are yet unkind
To Royallists, the King may find
More Faithful Friends than They.
An Echo to the Cavaleers Complaint.
I Marvel Dick, That having been
So long abroad, and having seen
The World, as Thou have done,
Thou should acquaint Me with a Tale
As old as Nestor, and as stale
As That of Priest and Nun!
Are We to learn what is a Court?
A Pageant, made for Fortunes sport,
Where Merits scarce appear:
For bashful Merit only dwelis
In Camps, in Villages, and Cells;
Alas! it dwells not There.
Desert is nice in its Address,
And Merit oftimes does oppress
Beyond what Guilt would do:
But They are sure of Their Demands,
That come to Court with Golden-hands
And Brazen-faces too.
The King, They say, does still profess
To give His Party some Redress,
And cherish Honesty:
But His good Wishes prove in vain,
Whose Service, with His Servants gain,
Not always does agree.
All Princes, (be They never so wise)
Are fain to see with Others Eyes,
But, seldom hear at all;
And Courtiers find Their interest,
In Time to feather well Their Nest,
Providing for Their Fall.
Our Comfort does on Time depend;
Things, when They are at worst, will mend:
And let Us but reflect
On our Condition the other Day,
When None but Tyrants bore the sway,
What did We Then expect?
Mean while, a calm Retreat is best:
But Discontent, (if not suppressed)
Will breed Disloyalty.
This is the constant Note I sing,
I have been Faithful to the KING,
And so shall ever be.
LONDON, Printed for Robert Crofts at the CROWN in Chancery lane. 1661.
