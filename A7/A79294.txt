By the King.
A PROCLAMATION Concerning His Majesty's gracious PARDON, In pursuance of His
Majesty's former DECLARATION.
CHARLES R.

CHARLES by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith etc. Whereas by Our Declaration, Dated at Breda the 4/14
day of April last past, We did Declare, That We did grant a Full and General
Pardon, which We were ready to pass under Our Great Seal of England, to all Our
Subjects, of what Degree or Quality soever, who within Forty days after the
Publication there of, should lay hold upon that Our Grace and Favor, and
should, by any the public Act, Declare their doing so, and that they returned
to the Loyalty and Obedience of good Subjects, excepting only such persons as
should be excepted by Parliament. And We did further Declare, That (those only
excepted) all Our subjects, how faulty soever, should rely upon the Word of a
King, solemnly given by that Our Declaration, That no Crime whatsoever,
committed against Us, or Our Royal Father, before the publication thereof,
should ever rise in Judgment, or be brought in question, against any of them,
to the least Indammagement, either of their Lives, Liberties, or Estates; Or
(as far forth as lay in Our Power) so much as to the prejudice of their
Reputation, by any reproach, or term of distinction, from the rest of Our best
Subjects. We desiring, and ordaining, That thenceforward all Notes of Discord,
Separation, and difference of Parties, might be utterly abolished amongst all
Our Subjects, whom we invited, and Conjured to a perfect Union amongst
themselves, under Our Protection, for the resettlement of Our just Rights, and
theirs in a Free Parliament; Which Our said Declaration We sent Enclosed in Our
Letters, to both Houses of Parliament, and the same was by them received the
first Day of May last; And afterward according to Our Intention and Will was
Printed and Published for the satisfaction of Our Subjects.

And whereas, afterward, (that is to say) the seventh day of June instant,
Our Commons assembled in Parliament, did Resolve and Declare, That they did by
that their public Act, for, and in behalf of themselves, and every of them,
and of all the Commons of England, of what Quality or Degree soever they were,
Lay hold upon Our Free and General Pardon, according as in Our said Letters
and Declaration it was Granted, Tendered, or Expressed.

And that Our House, with their Speaker, did attend, and present to Us their
Humble desire; That it may be as effectual to all Our Subjects in particular,
(Except, as before Excepted) as if every of them, had at any time since the
first of May last, personally laid hold upon Our Grace and Pardon, and by
public Act declared their doing so; And that We Would be pleased to Declare
Our acceptance thereof accordingly, and by Our Royal Proclamation to assure
the hearts of Our Subjects of the same. We being very willing and desirous to
administer all just satisfaction and ease to the minds of our people, and to
remove all Fears and and Iealousies which may concern their security; And to
manifest to them, and the World, that Our heart is possessed With the same
Clemency and tenderness toward them, that We expressed in that Our
Declaration; Which if it were not, We should not think Our self worthy of those
signal Belssings Which God Almighty has powered upon Us, and the Nation since;
And by the publication of that Our Declaration, in the Cheerful obedience of
Our Subjects, Do hereby publish and declare; That We do Graciously accept the
said Address of Our said House of Commons, to the full Intent and End thereof,
and on the behalf of All the Commons of England, and that We will very
willingly and cheerfully give Our Royal Assent to the said Act of Free and
General pardon, when it shall be presented to Us by Our two Houses of
Parliament, and which We do with some Impatience expect, as the most reasonable
and solid Foundation of that peace, happiness and security, We hope, and pray
for, to Our self, and all Our Dominions; And for the better manifestation of
Our gracious intentions and desire herein; and in regard that the great
Deliverations of Our Houses of Parliament, upon all the weighty Affairs of the
Kingdom, cannot admit that expedition, in the dispatch of this Bill, which the
general fears and apprehensions of Our people may long for; and, that the
consideration of excepting Notorious Delinquents, may not stop the current of
Our Mercy and Grace toward the generality of Our Subjects We leave it to
themselves to take and sue out, Our particular Pardons, in such manner as they
think fit; And to that purpose We have appointed Our Secretaries of State to
present Warrants to Us for Our Signature, directing Our Attorney General to
prepare Bills, for the passing Pardons to such, who shall desire the same; in
the issuing whereof, We will take it upon Our Self, and it shall be Our Care,
and the Care of those Our Ministers, through whose hands the same are to pass,
That no Pardon shall pass to any of those Notorious Offenders, who are in
danger, or like to be be Excepted by the Parliament: And We have given order to
Our Attorney General, and Council at Law for preparing as full a Pardon of all
Treasons, Felonies, and other Misdemeanors, for all other persons, which have
happened or been occasioned by reason of the late Troubles, as they can wish.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Fifteenth day of June, in the Twelfth
Year of Our Reign, 1660.
