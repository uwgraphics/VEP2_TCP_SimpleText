A mad kind of wooing, Or, a Dialogue between Will the simple, and Nan the
subtle, With their loving agreement.
To the tune of the new dance at the Red Bull Playhouse.


Sweet Nancie I do love thee dear,
Believe me if thou can,
And shall, I do protest and swear,
while that thy name is Nan.
I cannot court with eloquence,
As many Courtiers do:
But I do love entirely wench,
and must enjoy thee too.
Spite of friends that contends
Lo separate our love:
If thou love me as I love thee,
my mind shall never remove.
Nan. Peace goodman clown you are to brief,
In proffering love to me:
And if thou use such rusticke speech,
we two shall never agree:
Do think my fortunes I Will forsake,
To marry with a clown,
When I have choice enough to take,
of Gallants in the town,
The Eagles eye does scorn the fly,
Shele find a better prey:
Therefore leave off thy dotish sure,
away fond fool away.

Will. Why prithee Nan never scorn my love,
Although I be but plain:
Where Will does once but set his love,
he must not love in vain.
For all you speak so Scholler-like,
And talk of Eagles eyes:
Know I am come a wooing wench
and not a catching flies.
Then never reply nor yet deny,
I will not be denaid:
I would not have the world report,
I twice did woe a maid.

Nan. But twice and thrice and twenty times
You Will woo before you win:
To match with ignorance amongst maids
is held a sottish sin.
Therefore I Will match if ere I match,
One equal to my spirit:
And such a one or else no one,
shall my best love inherit.
A man of wit best does si:
A Maiden for to take,
Then such a man if that I can:
my husband I will make.

Will. Why Nan I hope thou do not take,
Thy Will to be a fool:
Thou know my Father for thy sake,
three years kept me at school.
And if that thou have spirit enough,
To yield to be my joy,
I warrant I have spirit enough,
to get a chopping boy.
Then never deny, yield and try,
Or try before you trust:
Let who will seek for to enjoy,
for Will both will and must.

The second part.
To the same tune.


WHy I have those that seek my love
That are too stout to yield:
And rather then they would lose my love,
they would win me in the field,
Their skill in martial exercise,
So much does thine surpass,
That should they hear thee sue for love,
they's count thee but an ass,
Then be mute thy foolish suit
Is all but spent in vain:
It Is an impossibility
thou should my lo^^ obtain.
Will. Do hear me Nan what ere lebe,
Does challenge love of thee,
I Will make him like to Cupid blind,
he shall have no eyes to see.
I think I have a little skill,
My arms be strong and tuffe:
And I will warrant they shall serve
to baste him well enuffe:
If he but starts to touch thy skirts,
Or in the least offends:
By all the hopes I have of love,
I Will cut of his fingers ends.

Nan. How should I grant to fancy thee,
Whom others do disdain.
If thou should chance to marry me,
how would thou me maintain:
Thou know not how to use a wife,
Thou art so homely bred:
And soon I doubt to jealousy,
thy fancy might be led:
Many fears urge my cares,
That I should careful be:
I fear I match a crabbed piece,
if I should marry thee.

Will. Nan I am plain and cannot cog,
Nor promise wondrous fair:
When all my promises shall prove
like Castles built in the Air:
My true performance shall be all,
My word shall be my deed:
And honest Nan if I have thee,
you shall have all you need.
Clay hands be bold, say and hold,
Let us make quick dispatch:
If thou love me as I love thee,
we will straight make up the match.

Nan. Then Will here is both hand and heart,
I Will love thee till I dye:
The world may judge I match for love,
and not all for the eye.
I had rather match a lusty youth,
Whose strength is now at full,
Then match a small weak timbred man,
whose strength has had a pull.
Maidens all both great and small,
That hope to marry at length,
Do not marry for bravery:
but unto strength add strength.

FINIS.
