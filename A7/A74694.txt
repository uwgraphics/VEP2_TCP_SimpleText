LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. MDCXLI.



HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER To the PETITION which accompanied the DECLARATION
Presented to Him at Hampton Court, 1o December. 1641.
WE having received from you, soon after Our return out of Scotland, a long
Petition, consisting of many desires, of great moment, together with a
Declaration of a very unusual nature annexed thereunto, We had taken some
time to consider of it, as befitted Us in a matter of that consequence, being
confident, that your own reason and regard to Us, as well as Our express
intimation by Our Comptroller to that purpose, would have restrained you from
the publishing of it, till such time, as you should have received Our Answer to
it: But, much against Our expectation, finding the contrary, that the said
Declaration is already abroad in Print, by directions from your House, as
appears by the printed Copy; We must let you know that We are very sensible
of the disrespect. Notwithstanding, it is Our Intention, that no failing on
your part, shall make Us fail in Ours, of giving all due satisfaction to the
desires of Our people, in a Parliamentary way; And therefore We send you this
Answer to your Petition, reserving Our self in point of the Declaration, which
We think unparliamentary, and shall take a course to do that which We shall
think fit in prudence and honor.

To the Petition, We say; that although there are diverse things in the
Preamble of it, which We are so far from admitting, that We profess We
cannot at all understand them, as, Of a wicked and malignant party prevalent in
the Government; Of some of that party admitted to Our Privy Council, and to
other Employments of trust, and necrest to Us and Our Children; Of Endeavors
to sow among the People false scandals and imputations, to blemish and
disgrace the Proceedings of the Parliament: All, or any of which, did We know
of, We should be as ready to remedy and punish, as you to complain of. That
the Prayers of your Petition are grounded upon such Premises as We must in no
wise admit; yet notwithstanding We are pleased to give this Answer to you.

To the first concerning Religion, consisting of several branches, We say,
that for the preserving the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom from the designs
of the Popish party, We have, and will still concur with all the just desires
of Our people in a Parliamentarie way; That for the depriving of the Bishops of
their Votes in Parliament, We would have you consider, that their right is
grounded upon the fundamental Law of the Kingdom, and constitution of
Parliament; This We would have you consider, but since you desire Our
concurrence herein in a Parliamentary way, We will give no further answer at
this time.

As for the abridging of the inordinate power of the Clergy, We conceive that
the taking away of the high Commission Court has well moderated that, but if
there continue any Usurpations, or Excesses in their Jurisdictions, We therein
neither have nor will protect them.

Unto that Clause which concerns Corruptions (as you style them) in Religion,
in Church Government, and in Discipline, and the removing of such unnecessary
Ceremonies as weak Consciences might cheque at. That for any illegal
Innovations which may have crept in, We shall willingly concur in the removal
of them. That if Our Parliament shall advise Us to call a National Synod,
which may duly examine such Ceremonies as give just cause of offense to any.
We shall take it into consideration, and apply Our Self to give due
satisfaction therein; But We are very sorry to hear in such general terms,
Corruption in Religion objected, since We are persuaded in Our conscience,
that no Church can be found upon the earth that professes the true Religion
with more purity of Doctrine then the Church of England does, nor where the
Government and Discipline are jointly more beautified, and free from
superstition, then as they are here established by Law, which (by the grace of
God) We will with Constancy maintain (while We live) in their Purity and
Glory, not only against all invasions of Popery, but also from the irreverence
of those many Schismatics and Separatists, wherewith of late this Kingdom and
this City abounds, to the great dishonor and hazard both of Church and State;
for the suppression of whom We require your timely and active assistance.

To the second prayer of the Petition, concerning the removal and choice of
Councillors, We know not any of Our Council to whom the Character set forth
in the Petition can belong. That by those whom We had exposed to trial, We
have already given you sufficient testimony, that there is no man so near unto
Us in place or affection, whom We will not leave to the Justice of the Law, if
you shall bring a particular charge and sufficient proofs against him; and of
this We do again assure you, but in the mean time We wish you to forbear such
general aspersions as may reflect upon all Our Council, since you name none
in particular.

That for the choice of Our Councillors and Ministers of State, it were to
debar Us that natural liberty all Freemen have, and it is the undoubted
right of the Crown of England, to call such persons to Our Secret Councels, to
public employment, and Our particular service, as We shall think fit, so We
are, and ever shall be very careful to make election of such persons in those
places of trust, as shall have given good testimonies of their abilities and
integrity, and against whom there can be no just cause of exception whereon
reasonably to ground a diffidence; and to choices of this nature We assure you
that the mediation of the nearest unto Us has always concurred.

To the third Prayer of your Petition, concerning Ireland, We understand your
desire of not alienating the forfeited Lands thereof, to proceed from your much
care and love; And like wise that it may be a Resolution very fit for Us to
take, but whether it be seasonable to declare Resolutions of that nature before
the events of a war be seen, that We much doubt of. Howsoever, We cannot but
thank you for this care, and your cheerful engagement for the suppression of
that Rebellion; upon the speedy effecting whereof, the glory of God in the
Protestant Profession, the safety of the British there, Our honor, and that
of the Nation so much depends; all the Interests of this Kingdom being so
involved in that business, We cannot but quicken your affections therein, and
shall desire you to frame your Councels, and to give such expedition to the
work, as the nature thereof, and the pressures in point of time requires, and
whereof you are put in mind by the daily insolence and increase of those
Rebels.

For Conclusion, your promise to apply your selves to such courses as may
support Our Royal Estate with Honor and Plenty at home, and with Power and
Reputation abroad, is that which We have ever promised Our Self, both from
your Loyalties and Affections, and also for what We have already done, and
shall daily go adding unto, for the comfort and happiness of Our people.

FINIS.
