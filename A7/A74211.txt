THE BISHOPS LAST GOODNIGHT.
Where Popery and Innovations do begin,
There Treason will by degrees come in.
If they had ruld still, where had we been?
God keep us from Prelates, Popish Prelates.
Only Canonical prayers


Bishops. So we desire it.


Citizens. no afternoon sermons


Then no Bishops




The Pope. Estote proditores


Jesuit, Friar, and Papist.

COme down Prelates, all arow,
Your Protestation brings you low,
Have not we always told you so;
You are too saucy Prelates,
Come down Prelates.
II.

The storms have caused low to lie,
You know not how soon your self may die,
Prepare your self Canterbury;
Down must Canterbury.
III.
York, when you were Lincoln of late,
You were in the Tower, yet still you will prate,
How dare you Protest against the whole State,
You are too bold York,
Come down proud York.
IV.

To have the Parliament by you contrould,
It Were better you to the Scots had been sold,
You are deceived Durham,
Come down old Durham.
V.

It Were better you had let the Parliament alone,
But now it is too late to make your moan,
You are fast Coventry,
Come down Coventry.
VI.

We now see what your humility is;
Were you removed from Exeter for this,
You are led away Norwich,
Come down Norwich.
VII.

You that even now was so great a Peer,
And now a Prisoner this new year;
You must lie by it Asaph,
In the Tower Asaph.

Can thou not get a pardon from the Pope,
To pass away without a Rope?
Where art thou Bath and Wels?
Down must Bath and Wels.
IX.

Since out of the Convocation he was rooted,
To hasten this project it was well footed,
To bring thee down Hereford,
Down must Hereford.

For doing of such an ungodly Act,
Thy credit now is utterly cract:
You are not for Oxford,
But the Tower Oxford.

Left the Church naked in a storm and shower,
And now (for it) thou must to thy old friend in the Tower;
To the Tower must Ely,

That thou art made perforce to bow,
Merely drawn in, thou know though how,
You must away Gloucester,
To prison poor Gloucester.

Where is thy candle, book, and Bell?
Thy Pardons now will never fell,
There Is no help Peterborough,
Go must Peterborough.
XIIII.

Lest the Leeke, and Red-herring run away,
Are you resolved to go or to stay?
You are called for Landaff,
Come in Landaff.
FINIS.
London Printed in the year that ended,
When the Prelates Protestation against the Parliament was vended,
And they were sent to the Tower, as the old year ended,
By a dozen together,
In frosty weather.
Anno Dom. 164^.
