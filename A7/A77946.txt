AN EPITAPH.
WIthin this sacred VAULT does lie
The Quintessence of Majesty;
Which being Set, more Glorious shines,
The Best of KINGS, best of Divines;
Britains shame, and Britains glory,
Mirror of Princes, complete Story
Of ROYALTY; One so exact
That the Elixirs of Praise detract:
These are faint Shadows; But to endure,
He Is drawn toth' Life in's POVRTRACTVRE:
If such another PIECE you would see,
Angels must Limn it out, or HE;
Where Wisdom, Grace, and Eloquence,
Are Centred in their Eminence.
Martyred HE was to save His Laws,
Religion, People, from the Jaws
Of ASSASINES; whose weal HE sought,
Even then when they His MURDER wrought
With horrid Plots, that HEADLESS He
(And in HIM Church and State) might be.
Then since Correlatives They were,
Three Kingdoms in One KING lies here.
