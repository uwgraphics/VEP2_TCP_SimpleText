A Brief RELATION OF The late Passages that happened at His Majesty's Fort OF
DUNCANNON.
June 8.
WEdnesday about noon, when all our soldiers were at dinner within the fort,
the enemy gave us a sudden Alarm, being discovered on the side of an hill,
about a mile distant from the fort, marching toward the same, consisting of
the number of 300 men, and 10 horse, they having made a stand upon the top of a
plain; Our men in short time were in arms, then I, together with Lieutenant
Esmond, my Lords Lieutenant sallyed forth with 120 Musketeers and Pikes, and
marched up unto the enemy, pitching our selves in battle array, within Musket
shot of them: Then I commanded my men to give fire upon them by ranks, which
the enemy (Sergeant Major Butler being their Commander) answered very boldly:
The skirmish continued very hot between us for the space of two hours, till at
last (it pleased God that diverse of their men falling to the ground) their
courage began to fail them, which we well perceiving, came up boldly, giving
fire upon them as thick as we could, and forced them to retreat, pursuing them
about three quarters of a mile, where we discovered another company of the
Rebels about 100 of them, that were coming to second them; we then retreated
toward the Fort, but as we were retreating, we discovered six other horsemen
that were coming on the backside of us, thinking that Sergeant Major Butler had
maintained fight against us, and kept his ground, but presently I commanded six
of our horsemen to ride up unto them, which the enemy no sooner beheld them
approaching, and withal fearing that the Sergeant Major had lost his ground,
and been forced to retreat, but they retreated also down a hill into a bottom,
whom our horsemen followed, until such time as they discovering another company
of Rebels, with Colors flying, being about 100 of them: Then our horsemen made
a stand, but immediately a great storm of rain arose, so as we could not pursue
any further attempt against them, they having then the advantage against us, by
reason of their firelocks, I caused the Drums to beat a retreat, and brought
off every man of ours, not one of them (thanks be given to God) being so much
as touched by any shot that came from the enemy that day, but it is conceived
that diverse of the Rebels were slain and hurt, for when as we had beaten them
off from the place where they maintained skirmish against us, we found in
several places great store of their blood, as also a piece of Sergeant Butlers
Buff coat, which was shot from his body that day: Moreover, at the same time we
took Sergeant Major Butlers own Saddlenag, with his furniture, and one
Petronell, his rider being his Brother Pierce Butler, trusting to his
footmanship more then to his valor, escaped, or otherwise he had been taken,
together with the horse.

A continuance of the Passages that happened unto us at His Majesty's Fort of
Duncannon sithence the 8. of June, 1642.
June 13.
Monday, hearing diverse Guns to be shot off toward Tintern, and fearing that
the enemy had besieged them there, I obtained leave of the Lord Esmond to
march forth with some Musketeers and Pikes, and 6 horsemen, to learn what News;
and having marched so far as a place called Kilbreed, about the midway to
Tintern, I made a stand, and commanded the horsemen to scout abroad, who riding
by the the Castle of Dungulp, about a mile from Kilbreed, they discovered some
30 horses of the enemy, feeding near the Castle, which our horsemen brought
away, they being most of them laboring horses, and not above one or two fit
for service: Our horsemen being come up unto me, and finding the shooting to
cease, I marched back again unto the Fort, not being assaulted by the enemy
that day.

June 16.
Thursday morning at break of day having obtained leave of his Lordship to go
to Tintern, to see in what case they remained there, I marched forth with my
whole company, and six horsemen, and came unto Tintern in safety, not being
molested by the enemy, where I remained by the space of 2 or 3 hours, and
demanded the reason of the shooting, which had passed the Monday before; they
told me, that 10 of their men had sallyed forth unto Dungulp, and from thence
taken 20 Cows, and brought them away in despite of the enemy, who pursued them
almost within a Musket shot of the Castle of Tintern. Then I returned with my
Drums beating a march toward the Fort, but when I came to Kilbreed, there I
found a party of fifty Musketeers and Pikes, which his Lordship had sent to
second me, as occasion had served, where I made a stand, and by and by we
discovered the enemy, being about 200 of them, distant from us on our right
wing, about a mile, I commanded our horse to advance toward them, to see if
they would come on, but they kept their standing, and only came to show
themselves and no more; then I marched back again unto the Fort, not having any
resistance given me by the enemy that day.

June 19.
Sunday night a Consultation being had between the Lord Esmond, Captain Weldon,
and my self, concerning a surprisall, and an assault to be made in the night
time upon the enemy, whereas they lay quartered in a Town called Shelbeggan,
and another small Town called Burkestown, near thereunto adjoining, being about
4 miles distant from the Fort, and to fire the same, his Lordship then
conceived it to be most fit, that I should give the first onset, and give the
Alarm: and therefore his Lordship under his Honors hand, ordered me the
Sunday night before mentioned, to march with 60 Musketeers and Pikes unto
Tintern, there to procure what horse and men I could get (leaving a competent
Guard to defend the Castle) as also some good guides to conduct me the best way
to shun the enemies Sentinel, and bring me unto that part of the Town which
was appointed me to fall upon, between Shilbeggan and Burkestown, according to
his Lordships order, Captain Weldon being likewise ordered by his Lordship
under his Honors hand, to meet me in another place of the Town, with some 120
Musketeers and Pikes, and six horsemen, and likewise immediately so soon as I
had given the Alarm, and fired one house, to fall on into the Town to second
me.

In pursuance of his Lordships order, I marched to Tintern with my men that
night, and there got a friend of mine, by name Edward Aston, who was Commander
of the Soldiers that defended the Castle, to furnish me with 8 horses and 24
Musketeers, amongst whom were some good guides, and to march along with me
himself (leaving behind him at Tintern a reasonable guard) not having stayed
above half an hour. In our marching toward Shilbeggan, by the help of our
guides, we came so fortunately (albeit the enemy had placed many Sentinels) as
that we came to the place appointed, where making a stand, we heard one of
our enemies Sentinels singing, whom we had cut off, but that one of our horses
neighing, upon a sudden the Sentinel ran into the Town, crying out, Arm, arm:
The Town was presently in arms, although confusedly, then immediately I
commanded our horsemen to advance forwards in the Van toward the Town, to see
if they could discry the enemies horse, which were first to be intercepted, my
self and company drawing up also unto the Town, our horsemen having found the
enemies horse feeding just under the Town, drove them away, then I gave the
onset upon the Town, and fired one house, the first man that was slain, was the
Captain of the Watch, one of their Commanders, whose name we do not as yet
know, and eleven more, which we could discern, it being scarce break of day,
but it is conceived there were diverse more slain and burned, and having given
the Alarm, and fired the house as aforesaid; Thinking Captain Weldon would
have fallen on, and joined with me according to his Lordships order, I
proceeded in firing of the houses, and firing upon the enemy, who shot at us
very roundly on our Van; and Captain Weldons men on our Rear from off a hill
near adjoining to the Town, that we were forced to retreat, conceiving the
enemy had been round about us, having fired only 10 or 12 houses. And when as
we had retreated out of the Town, and and gotten out of the smoke thereof, the
day being broken, I discerned a body of men standing upon the top of an hill
close by the Town, whom afterward I found to be Captain Weldon and his
Company, I marched up unto him, and there made a stand also; the enemy then
increasing a pace round about, we sent forth diverse muskiteers to hold them
play, until such time as I had got my Ensign off, who stayed behind to make
good the place between both Towns with 20 muskiteers, which I had formerly
commanded him to do; I sent twenty muskiteers more and six hors-men to fetch
him off, he came up unto me, and brought all our men safe with him, not one of
our men being so much as once touched with any shot that came from the Rebels.

So having gotten all our men into a full body, we resolved to retreat,
marching toward the Fort, Captain VVeldon leading the Van, my son in the
body, and my self in the Rear. The enemy beholding our retreat, came against
us in the Rear, and gave fire upon us very thick, but we maintained our
retreat and made good our Rear so well, that the enemy notwithstanding their
many numbers, and the great advantages which they took against us from
ditches, could not gain any ground or advantage at all upon us. The enemy still
followed us retreating by the space of 3 miles, giving fire upon us in the
rear, and now and then on either wing, as they found occasion and advantage by
ditches; but we still kept the^ off, giving fire upon them so roundly, that they
did not so well relish our powder and shot as to dare to approach within the
command of our Arms, it being their chiefest drift and intent (presuming upon
their overplus of numbers) to come in upon us pel mel; This skirmish continued
until we came within a mile of the Fort, where in a bottom the Lord Esmond
having heard the report of our Guns, sent his Lieutenant with some forty
muskiteeres to have seconded us, as also to make good that place, where were
diverse ditches cast up; which if the enemy should have gotten, might have
proved very dangerous to our men in our retreat; but his Lordship well knowing
the drift of the enemy and the danger of the place, prevented the same in time,
for about 20 of the rebels were making all the speed they could thither
thinking to have come between us and the Fort, but his Lordships Lieutenant
manned the ditches, and maintained them against the Enemy, until such time as
our men had passed over a brook of water, and recovered the top of the hill
within command of the Fort, then the enemy retreated, and we drew off our men,
and marched into the Fort, having lost but one man all that day, and two or
three more that were wounded but nothing dangerous.

The numbers of the enemy that came against us that day were conceived to be
about six hundred, which would have far increased the whole Country being
raised, and would have fallen upon us, have we not retreated and come off so
soon as we did; the certain number that we this day killed or hurt on the
enemies side, we cannot tell, by reason that so soon as a man falls, (they
having men enough) he is presently conveyed away, so as we can nere come to
know any number of them to be slain.

This day also we took eight of the enemies best and choycest horses most fit
for service at my first onset upon the Town, the residue being but plow-horses
I rather chose to leave behind, then to hazard any of my men in the dangerous
attempt of driving them away.

June 20.
Tuesday morning my Son, and his men being the day before compelled to
retreat with me to the Fort, I obtained leave of my Lord to conduct them unto
Tintein, which I did with my Company; And by the way we found where the Enemy
had layen in an Ambuscadoe, to have cut them off, imagining they would have
come that way the night before; As we were returning back again to the Fort,
we discried a company of the Rebels on our left Wing near unto Dungolph they
made a stand and only showed themselves, bu^ would not advance toward us, So
we marched back unto the Fort, not being intercepted by the Enemy that day.

June 27.
Monday in the evening there being two ships which were employed in his
Majestes service, riding at Anchor under the Fort, the one the good ship called
the Confidence of Dublin, Captain Thomas Bartlet being Commander thereof; the
other the Mary of Bristoll, Captain William Chapel being Commander thereof:
his Lordship, Captain VVeldon, and my self, together with the said Captains,
upon due consideration had of a Town and Castle called Doumore lying in a bay
without the harbors mouth toward the Sea, far from the sight and command of
the Fort, as also a place wherein the Rebels belonging to Waterford kept
diverse fishing-boats and used to randevouze and shelter themselves, waiting and
expecting the coming of any ships bound for this harbor with supplies of
Ammunition from foraigne parts for them, and to give them notice of their
expectancy and attendance there, being a place where (unless it proved to be
tempestuous weather) shipping might safely Anchor and discharge their lading
unknown to the Fort, resolved that sixty muskiteeres, twenty to be chosen out
of each Company within the Fort, should go aboard the said ships that night,
Captain VVeldon being their Commander in chief, and that the ships should
fall down before the said Town by break of day, and then land the men and fire
the same, which accordingly they landed, fired the Town, and took three of
their fishing boats with their tackling, and came aboard again without being
interrupted by the enemy, who about 300. of them only appeared a far off,
but fearing the Ordnance of the ships durst not draw near.

June 30.
Thursday morning, having obtained leave of his Lordship to relieve the men at
Tintein with some corn which we got out of a Ship that was at the Fort, they
being in great distress (Captain Weldon being appointed by his Lordship to
second me with his Company at Kilbreede) we came to Tintein within shot
thereof, but before I came thither I must be enforced (by reason of the many
bogs, which are unpassible) to march through Battlestowne, wherein was a Castle
which we formerly had burned, which Castle if the enemy had gotten and manned
the same, might have proved very dangerous to us in our retreat, the enemy
being very thick round about us, wherefore I commanded twelve musketteers,
Captain VVeldon being appointed to send so many more to strengthen them, which
was done accordingly, to make good the same until my return; Before I had
marched within musket shot of Tintein as aforesad, and the Corn was delivered,
the enemy was gathered together round about us in sever^ll places, some of them
about 200, made toward Battlestowne thinking to have gotten that, but whenas
my men shot at them, they retreated and kept a loofe off them, about 200 more
came from Dungolph, and manned the ditches that lay between Dungolph, and
Batlestowne, whereas we must of necessity be forced to march along by them,
whenas I came to Battlestowne I commanded of my men from off the Castle,
resolving to make our passadge through them that lay before us, for the enemy
had gotten the advantage both of our Van, and Rear, and shot at us very
thick, being in this dangerous case I led up the Van of my Company, mine
Ensign bringing up the Rear, my men gave fire upon the enemy so roundly both
in the Van, and R^are, that we forced them to keep off at distance, so as they
could not gain any advantage upon us, and manteined the same so well, that I
had gotten my men over a narrow passage of water, in a bogge which lay between
us and Captain VVeldon: which we God be praised having recovered in safety,
only I lost one of my men and an other was hurt upon the first onset: But it is
conceived the enemy lost more on their side, for there was heard a great cry
among them. Then marching up to Kilbreede to Captain Weldon there also was an
other Company of the Rebels within half a mile thereof, that intended to have
got that place, which Captain VVeldon was compelled to make good, and
therefore could not safely come to relieve, or second me, which if it had
fallen out otherwise I do presume he would have done, Then we marched unto
the Fort, the enemy not pursuing us any further.

Where we had not remained above the space of two hours, but that the enemy
just a our men were at dinner gave us a sudden Allarum, sending their Horses
skouting abroad, who took two of our Horses, as they were feeding, without
command of the Fort, and drove them away unt^ a place called Ramsegrange, about
a mile and a half from the Fort, where whenas our men were gotten in Arms,
and some of them had sallyed forth, they were discovered about 300 of them:
Captain VVeldon and I sallyed presently forth with 200 Musketteeres, and
Pikes, toward them, offering to meet with them in a plain plot of ground,
but they would not come on, intending solely to have drawn us so far from
the Fort, that there Ambuscadoes might have cut us off, But we well knowing
their accustomed treachery, made a stand, and maintained all such places of
advantage that we could, for prevention of any sudden attempt that might be
given against the Fort, which the enemy perceiving, immediately they appeared in
several bodies, whereas they lay formerly concealed, amounting in the whole
number as near as we could guess to a thousand Foot, and an hundred Horse,
then we retreated, only a few Shot were bandied between us and came into the
Fort, All which companies of the enemies had (as we conjecture) intelligenee
of my going to relieve Tyntein, and were fully bent to have cut me off, and my
company, had it not pleased God to protect us, it hastening our return from
thence, and likewise to protract most of them, who came under the command of
the Lord Mungarralds. Son, to have joined with the rest of the Rebels (which
I met withal in the morning) so long that their intended proditious design
was altogether made frustrate and prevented.

FINIS.
