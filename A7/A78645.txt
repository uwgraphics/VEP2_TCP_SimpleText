His Majesty's ANSWER TO THE XIX. PROPOSITIONS OF BOTH HOUSES OF Parliament.

LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.

His Majesty's Answer To the nineteen PROPOSITIONS of both Houses of Parliament.
BEfore We shall give you Our Answer to your Petition and Propositions, We
shall tell you, that We are now cleary satisfied, why the Method, which We
traced out to you by Our Message of the 20th of January, and have since so
often pressed upon you, as the proper way to compose the distractions of this
Kingdom, and render it truly happy, has been hitherto declined, and is at
length thought fit to be looked upon; We now see plainly (and desire that you,
and all other Our good Subjects should do so too) that the Cabalists of this
business have with great Prudence reserved themselves, until due preparations
should be made for their Design.

If they had unseasonably vented such Propositions, as the Wisdom and Modesty
of your Predecessors never thought fit to offer to any of Our Progenitors,
nor We in honor or regard to Our Regal authority (which God has entrusted Us
with for the good of Our People) could receive without just indignation (and
such many of your present Propositions are) their hopes would soon have been
blasted, and those Persons, to whom Offices, Honors, Power and Commands were
designed, by such ill timing of their business, would have failed of their
expectation, not without a Brand upon the attempt. Therefore, before any of
this nature should appear, they have (certainly with great wisdom in the
Conduct of it) thought fit to remove a troublesome Rub in their way, The Law;
To this end, (that they might undermine the very foundations of it) a new Power
has been assumed to interpret and declare Laws without Us by extemporary
Votes, without any Case judicially before either House, (which is in effect the
same thing as to make Laws without Us) Orders and Ordinances made only by both
Houses (tending to a pure arbitrary power) were pressed upon the people as
Laws, and their obedience required to them.

Their next step was, To erect an upstart Authority without Us, (in whom, and
only in whom the Laws of this Realm have placed that Power) To command the
Militia, (very considerable to this their Design;) In further order to it they
have wrested from Us Our Magazin and town of Hull, and destridde Sir John
Hotham in his bold-faced Treason; They have prepared and directed to the People
unpresidented Invectives against Our Government, thereby (as much as lay in
their power) to weaken Our just Authority and due esteem among them; They have
as injuriously as presumptuously (though We conceive by this time Impudence it
self is ashamed of it) attempted to cast upon Us aspersions of an unheard of
nature, as if We had favored a Rebellion in Our own Bowels; They have likewise
broached new Doctrine, That We are obliged to pass all Laws that shall be
offered to Us by both Houses (howsoever Our own Judgment and Conscience shall
be unsatisfied with them) a point of Policy, as proper for their present
business, as destructive to all Our Rights of Parliament; And so with strange
shamelessness will forget a Clause in a Law still in force, made in the second
year of King H. 5. wherein both Houses of Parliament do acknowledge, That it is
of the Kings Regality to grant or deny such of their Petitions as pleases
Himself, They have interpreted Our necessary Guard, legally assembled for the
Defense of Us and Our Childrens Persons against a Traitor in open Rebellion
against Us, to be with intent to leavie War against Our Parliament, (the
thought whereof Our very soul abhors) thereby to render Us odious to Our
People.

They have so awed Our good Subjects with Pursivants, long chargeable
Attendance, Heavy Censures and illegal Imprisonments, that few of them durst
offer to present their tenderness of Our Sufferings, their own just
Grievances, and their sense of those violations of the Law, (the Birthright of
every Subject of this Kingdom) though in an humble Petition directed to both
Houses; and if any did, it was stifled in the Birth, called Sedition, and burnt
by the common Hangman.

They have refrained the Attendance of Our ordinary and necessary
Houshold-servants, and seized upon those small sums of Money which Our Credit
had provided to buy Us Bread, With Injunctions That none shall be suffered to
be conveyed or returned to Us to York, or any of Our Peers or Servants with Us,
so that (in effect) they have blocked Us up in that County.

They have filled the ears of the People with the noise of Fears and
Iealousies, (though taken up upon trust) tales of Skippers, Salt-Fleets, and
such like, by which Alarms they might prepare them to receive such impressions,
as might best advance this Design when it should be ripe. And now it seems
they think We are sufficiently prepared for these bitter Pills, We are in a
handsome Posture to receive these humble Desires, (which probably are intended
to make way for a Superfetation of a (yet) higher nature, (if We had not made
this discovery to you) for they do not tell Us this is all. In them We must
observe that these Contrivers (the better to advance their true ends) disguised
as much as they could their intents with a mixture of some things really to be
approved by every honest man; Others, specious and popular; And some which are
already granted by Us; All which are cunningly twisted and mixed with those
other things of their main Design of Ambition and private interest; in hope,
that at the first view, every eye may not so clearly discern them in their
proper colors.

We would not be understood, That We intend to fix this Design upon both, or
either House of Parliament; We utterly profess against it, being most
confident of the Loyalty, good affections and integrity of the intentions of
that great Body, and knowing well that very many of both Houses were absent,
and many dissented from all those particulars We complain of: But We do
believe, and accordingly profess to all the world, that the Malignity of this
Design (as dangerous to the Laws of this Kingdom, the Peace of the same, and
the Liberties of all Our good Subjects, as to Our Self, and Our just
Prerogative) has proceeded from the subtle Informations, mischievous
Practices, and evil Counsels of ambitious turbulent Spirits, disaffected to
Gods true Religion, and the Unity of the Professors thereof, Our Honor and
Safety, and the public Peace and prosperity of Our people, not without a
strong influence upon the very actions of both Houses. But how faulty soever
others are, We shall (with Gods assistance) endeavor to discharge Our duty
with uprightness of heart; And therefore since these Propositions come to Us
in the name of both Houses of Parliament, We shall take a more particular
notice of every of them.

If the 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 9. 10. 15. 16. 19. Demands had been writ and printed in
a tongue unknown to Us and Our people, it might have been possible We and they
might have charitably believed the Propositions to be such as might have been
in Order to the ends pretended in the Petition (to wit) the establishing of Our
Honor and Safety, the welfare and Security of Our Subjects and Dominions, and
the removing those Jealousies and Differences which are said to have unhappily
fallen betwixt Us and Our people, and procuring both Us and them a constant
course of Honor, Peace and happiness. But being read and understood by all,
We cannot but assure Our Self that this Profession, joined to these
Propositions, will rather appear a Mockery and a Scorn; The Demands being
such, as We were unworthy of the trust reposed in Us by the Law, and of Our
Descent from so many great and famous Ancestors, if We could be brought to
abandon that power which only can enable Us to perform what We are sworn to,
in protecting Our People and the Laws, and so assume others into it, as to
divest Our self of it; Although not only Our present Condition (which it can
hardly be) were more necessitous then it is, and We were both vanquished, and a
Prisoner, and in a worse condition then ever the most unfortunate of Our
Predecessors have been reduced to, by the most criminal of their Subjects;
And though the Bait laid to draw Us to it, and to keep Our Subjects from
indignation at the mention of it, the promises of a plentiful and unparaleld
Revenue, were reduced from generals (which signify nothing) to clear and
certain particulars, since such a Bargain would have but too great a
resemblance of that of Esaus, if We should part with such Flowers of Our
Crown, as are worth all the rest of the Garland, and have been transmitted to
Us from so many Ancestors, and have been found so useful and necessary for
the welfare and Security of Our Subjects, for any present necessity, or for any
low and sordid Considerations of Wealth and gain. And therefore all men knowing
that those Accommodations are most easily made, and most exactly observed, that
are grounded upon reasonable and equal Conditions, We have great Cause to
believe, that the Contrivers of these had no intention of settling any firm
Accommodation but to increase those Iealousies, and widen that division, which
(not by Our fault) is now unhappily fallen between Us and both Houses.

It is asked, That all the Lords and others of Our privy Council, and such (We
know now what you mean by such, but We have cause to think you mean all) great
Officers and Ministers of State, either at home or beyond the Seas, (For care
is taken to leave out no Person or place, that Our dishonor may be sure not to
be bounded within this Kingdom, though no subtle Insinuations at such a
distance can probably be believed to have been the cause of Our distractions
and dangers) should be put from Our Privy Council, and from those Offices and
employments, unless they be approved by both Houses of Parliament, how
faithful soever We have found them to Us and the public, and how far soever
they have been from offending against any Law, the only rule they had or any
others ought to have to walk by. We therefore to this part of this demand
return you this Answer, That we are willing to grant that they shall take a
larger Oath then you yours selves desire in your 11th Demand, for maintaining
not of any part but of the whole Law; And We have and do assure you, That We
will be careful to make election of such persons in those places of trust, as
shall have given good testimonies of their abilities and integrities, and
against whom there can be no just cause of exception, whereon reasonably to
ground a diffidence; That if We have or shall be mistaken in Our election, We
have and do assure you, that there is no man so near to Us in place or
affection, whom we will not leave to the Justice of the Law, if you shall bring
a particular charge and sufficient proofs against him; And that We have given
you (the best pledge of the effects of such a promise on Our part, and the best
security for the performance of their duty on theirs) a Trienniall Parliament,
the apprehension of whose Justice will in all probability make them wary how
they provoke it, and Us wary how We choose such, as by the discovery of their
faults may in any degree seem to discredit Our election. But that without any
shadow of a fault objected, only perhaps because they follow their conscience,
and preserve the established Laws, and agree not in such Votes, or assent not
to such Bills, as some persons, who have now too great an Influence even upon
both Houses, judge or seem to judge to be for the public good, and as are
agreeable to that new Utopia of Religion and Government into which they
endeavor to transform this Kingdom; (for We remember what names, and for what
Reasons you left out in the Bill offered Us concerning the Militia, which you
had your selves recommended in the Ordinance) We will never consent to the
displacing of any, whom for their former merits from, and affection to Us and
the public, We have entrusted, since We conceive, That to do so, would take
away both from the affection of Our servants the care of Our service, and the
Honor of Our Justice. And We the more wonder, That it should be asked by you of
Us, since it appears by the 12th Demand, That your selves count it reasonable,
after the present turn is served, that the Judges and Officers who are then
placed may hold their places quam diu se been gesserint. And We are resolved to
be as careful of those We have chosen, as you are of those you would choose,
and to remove none, till they appear to Us to have otherwise behaved
themselves, or shall be evicted by legal proceedings to have done so.

But this Demand (as unreasonable as it is) is but one link of a great Chain,
and but the first round of that Ladder, by which Our Just, Ancient, Regal
Power is endeavored to be fetched down to the ground. For it appears plainly,
that it is not with the persons now chosen, but with Our choosing that you are
displeased; For you demand, That the persons put into the places and
employments of those who shall be removed, may be approved by both Houses; which
is so far (as to some it may at first sight appear) from being less then the
power of nomination, that of two things (of which We will never grant either)
We would sooner be content that you should nominate and We approve, then you
approve and We nominate; The mere nomination being so far from being any thing,
that if We could do no more, We would never take the pains to do that, when We
should only hazard those, whom We esteemed, to the scorn of a refusal, if
they happened not to be agreeable not only to the Judgment, but to the passion,
interest or humor of the present major part of either House. Not to speak now
of the great factions, animosities and divisions which this power would
introduce in both Houses, between both Houses, and in the several Countries,
for the choice of persons to be sent to that place where that power was, and
between the persons that were so chosen. Neither is this strange Potion
prescribed to Us only for once, for the cure of a present, pressing, desperate
disease, but for a diet to Us and Our Posterity; It is demanded, That Our
Counselors, all Chief Officers both of Law and State, Commanders of Forts and
Castles, and all Peers hereafter made (as to voting, without which how little
is the rest?) be approved of (that is, chosen by them from time to time; and
rather then it should ever be left to the Crown (to whom it only does and
shall belong) if any place fall void in the intermission of Parliament, the
major part of the approved Council is to approve them. Neither is it only
demanded, that We should quit the Power and Right Our Predecessors have had of
appointing Persons in these places, but for Counselors We are to be
restrained, as well in the number, as in the persons, and a power must be
annexed to these places, which their Predecessors had not; And indeed if this
power were past to them, it were not fit We should be trusted to choose those,
who were to be trusted as much as We.

It is demanded, That such matters as concern the public, and are proper for
the high Court of Parliament, (which is Our Great and Supreme Council) may be
debated, resolved and transacted only in Parliament, and not elsewhere, and
such as presume to do any thing to the contrary shall be reserved to the
Censure and Judgment of the Parliament, and such other matters of State, as
are proper for Our Privy Council, shall be debated and concluded by such of
Our Nobility (though indeed, if being made by Us they may not vote without the
Consent of both Houses, We are rather to call them your Nobility) and others,
as shall be from time to time chosen for that place, by approbation of both
Houses of Parliament; and that no public Act concerning the affairs of the
Kingdom, which are proper for Our Privy Council, may be esteemed of any
validity, as proceeding from the Royal Authority, unless it be done by the
Advice and Consent of the major part of Our Council, attested under their
hands: Which Demands are of that Nature, that to grant them were in effect at
once to depose both Our Self and Our Posterity.

These being past, We may be waited on bare-headed; We may have Our hand kissed;
The Style of Majesty continued to Us; And the Kings Authority, declared by
both Houses of Parliament, may be still the Style of your Commands; We may have
Swords and Maces carried before Us, and please Our Self with the sight of a
Crown and Scepter, (and yet even these Twigs would not long flourish, when the
Stock upon which they grew were dead) but as to true and real Power We should
remain but the outside, but the Picture, but the sign of a King. We were ever
willing that Our Parliament should debate, resolve, and transact such matters
as are proper for them, as far as they are proper for them: And We heartily
wish, that they would be as careful not to extend their Debates and
Resolutions beyond what is proper to them, that multitudes of things
punishable, and causes determinable by the Ordinary Iudicatures, may not be
enterteined in Parliament, and so cause a long, chargeable, fruitless
attendance of Our People, and (by Degrees) draw to you as well all the causes,
as all the faults of Westminster Hall, and divert your proper business; That
the course of Law be no ways diverted, much less disturbed, as was actually
done by the stop of the proceedings against a Riot in Southwarke, by Order of
the House of Commons, in a time so riotous and tumultuous, as much increased
the danger of Popular insolences, by such a countenance to Riots, and
discountenance of Law; That you descend not to the leisure of recommending
Lecturers to Churches, nor ascend to the Legislative power, by commanding (the
Law not having yet commanded it) that they whom you recommend be received,
although neither the Parson nor Bishop do approve of them; And that the
Refusers (according to the course so much formerly complained of to have been
used at the Council Table) be not sent for to attend to show cause; At least,
that you would consider convenience, if not Law, and recommend none, but who
are well known to you to be Orthodox, Learned, and Moderate, or at least such
as have taken Orders, and are not notorious depravers of the Book of Common
Prayer; A care which appears by the Discourses, Sermons and persons of some
recommended by you, not to have been hitherto taken, and it highly concerns
both you in duty, and the Commonwealth in the consequences, that it should
have been taken; That neither one estate transact what is proper for two, nor
two what is proper for three, and consequently, that (contrary to Our declared
will) Our Forts may not be seized; Our Arms may not be removed; Our Moneys may
not be stopped; Our legal Directions may not be countermanded by you, nor We
desired to countermand them Our Self, nor such entrances made upon a Real War
against Us, upon pretense of an imaginary War against you, and a Chimaera of
necessity. So far do you pass beyond your limits, whilst you seem by your
Demand to be strangely straightened within them. At least We could have wished you
would have expressed, what matters you meant as fit to be transacted only in
Parliament, and what you meant by only in Parliament. You have (of late) been
persuaded by the new doctrines of some few to think that proper for your
debates, which has not used to be at all debated within those walls, but been
trusted wholly with Our Predecessors and Us, and to transact those things which
without the Regal Authority, since there were Kings of this Kingdom were
never transacted: It therefore concerns Us the more that you speak out, and
that both We and Our People may either know the bottom of your Demands, or know
them to be bottomless. What concerns more the Public, and is more (indeed)
proper for the high Court of Parliament, then the making of Laws? which not
only ought there to be transacted, but can be transacted no where else; but
then you must admit Us to be a part of the Parliament, you must not (as the
sense is of this part of this Demand, if it have any) deny the freedom of Our
Answer, when We have as much right to reject what We think unreasonable, as you
have to propose what you think convenient or necessary; nor is it possible Our
Answers either to Bills, or any other Propositions should be wholly free, if We
may not use the Liberty of every one of you, and of every Subject, and receive
advice (without their danger who shall give it) from any person known or
unknown, sworn or unsworn, in these matters in which the Manage of Our Vote is
trusted by the Law, to Our own Judgment and Conscience, which how best to
inform, is (and ever shall be) left likewise to Us; and most unreasonable it
were that two Estates, proposing something to the Third, that Third should be
bound to take no advice, whether it were fit to pass, but from those two that
did propose it. We shall ever in these things which are trusted wholly to Us by
the Law, not decline to hearken to the Advice of Our great Council, and shall
use to hear willingly the free debates of Our Privy Council (whenever We
may be suffered to have them for sending for, and they shall not be terrified
from that freedom, by Votes (and Brands of Malignants and Enemies to the State,
for advising what no Law forbids to advise) but We will retain Our Power of
admitting no more to any Council then the Nature of the business requires,
and of discoursing with whom We please, of what We please, and informing Our
Understanding by debate with any Persons, who may be well able to Inform and
Advise Us in some particular, though their Qualities, Education or other
Abilities may not make them so fit to be of Our sworn Council, and not tie Our
Self up not to hear any more then twenty five (and those not chosen absolutely
by Us) out of a Kingdom so replenished with Judicious and Experienced Persons
in several kinds. And though We shall (with the proportionable Consideration
due to them) always weigh the Advices both of Our Great and Privy Council,
yet We shall also look upon their Advices, as Advices, not as Commands, or
Impositions; upon them as Our Counselors, not as Our Tutors and Guardians,
and upon Our Self as their King, not as their Pupil, or Ward; for whatsoever
of Regality were by the Modesty of Interpretation left in Us in the first part
of the second Demand, as to the Parliament, is taken from Us in the second part
of the same, and placed in this new fangled kind of Councillors, whose power
is such and so expressed by it, that in all public Acts concerning the Affairs
of this Kingdom, which are proper for Our Privy Council (for whose Advice all
public Acts are sometimes proper, though never necessary) they are desired to
be admitted joint Patentees with Us in the Regality, and it is not plainly
expressed whether they mean Us so much as a single Vote in these Affairs: But
it is plain they mean Us no more at most then a single Vote in them, and no
more power then every one of the rest of Our Fellow-Councellours; only leave
to Us, out of their respect and duty, (and that only is left of all Our
ancient Power) a Choice, whether these that are thus to be joined with (or
rather set over) Us, shall be fifteen, or twenty five, and great care is taken
that the Oath which these Men shall take, shall be such, in the framing the
form of which (though sure We are not wholly unconcerned in it) We may be
wholly excluded, and that wholly reserved to be agreed upon by both Houses of
Parliament.

And to show that no more Care is taken of Our safety, then of Our Power, after
so great indignities offered to Us, and countenanced by those who were most
obliged to resent them: After Our Town and Fort kept from Us (from which, if it
were no otherwise Ours then the whole Kingdom is, We can no more legally be
kept out then out of Our whole Kingdom, which sure your selves will not deny to
be Treason) Our Arms, Our Goods sent away, and Our Money stopped from Us, Our
Guards (in which We have no other Intention then to hinder the end of these
things from being proportionable to their beginnings) are not only desired to
be dismissed before satisfaction for the injury, punishments of the injurers,
and care taken for Our future Security from the like: But it is likewise
desired, (and for this Law is pretended, and might as well have been for the
rest, which yet with some ingenuity are it seems acknowledged to be but Desires
of Grace) that We shall not for the future raise any Guards or extraordinary
Forces, but in case of actual Rebellion or Invasion, which if it had been Law,
and so observed in the time of Our Famous Predecessors, few of those Victories
which have made this Nation famous in other parts, could have been legally
achieved, nor could Our blessed Predecessor Queen Elizabeth have so defended
Her self in 88. And if no Forces must be leavied till Rebellions and Invasions
(which will not stay for the calling of Parliaments, and their consent for
raising Forces) be actual, they must undoubtedly (at least most probably) be
effectual and prevalent.

And as neither care is taken for Our Rights, Honor, nor safety as a Prince,
so Our Rights as a private Person are endeavored to be had from Us, it being
asked, that it may be unlawful and punishable, not only to conclude, but even
to treat of any Marriage with any Person for Our own Children, or to place
Governors about them, without consent of Parliament, and in the intermission
of those, without the consent of Our good Lords of the Council, that We may
not only be in a more defpicable state then any of Our Predecessors, but in a
meaner and viler condition then the lowest of Our Subjects, who value no
liberty they have more, then that of the free Education and Marriage of their
Children, from which We are asked to debar Our Self, and have the more reason
to take it ill, that We are so, because for Our choice of a Governor for Our
Son, and of a Husband for Our Daughter, (in which the Protestant Religion was
Our principal Consideration) We conceived We had reason to expect your present
thanks, and the increase of your future trusts.

We suppose these Demands by this time to appear such as the Demanders cannot
be supposed to have any such real fear of Us as has been long pretended, they
are too much in the style, not only of equals, but of Conquerours, and as
little to be intended for removing of Iealousies (for which end they are said
to be asked, and that is not as Merchants ask at first much more then they will
take, but as most necessary to effect it which (if they be) God help this poor
Kingdom, and those who are in the hands of such Persons, whose Iealousies
nothing else will remove) which indeed is such a way, as if there being
differences and suits between two persons, whereof one would have from the
other several parcells of his ancient Land, he should propose to him by way of
Accommodation, that he would quit to him all those in question, with the rest
of his Estate, as the most necessary and effectual means to remove all those
suits and differences. But we call God to witness, that as for Our Subjects
sake these Rights are vested in Us, so for their sakes, as well as for Our own,
We are resolved not to quit them, nor to subvert, (though in a Parliamentary
way) the ancient, equal, happy, well-poised and never-enough commended
Constitution of the Government of this Kingdom, nor to make Our Self of a King
of England a Duke of Venice, and this of a Kingdom a Republique.

There being three kinds of Government amongst men, Absolute Monarchy,
Aristocracy and Democracy, and all these having their particular conveniences
and inconveniences. The experience and wisdom of your Ancestors has so
molded this out of a mixture of these, as to give to this Kingdom (as far as
humane Prudence can provide) the conveniences of all three, without the
inconveniences of any one, as long as the Balance hangs even between the three
Estates, and they run jointly on in their proper Channel (begetting Verdure and
Fertility in the Meadows on both sides) and the overflowing of either on either
side raise no deluge or Inundation. The ill of absolute Monarchy is Tyranny,
the ill of Aristocracy is Faction and Division, the ills of Democracy are
Tumults, Violence and Licentiousness. The good of Monarchy is the uniting a
Nation under one Head to resist Invasion from abroad, and Insurrection at home:
The good of Aristocracy is the Conjunction of Counsel in the ablest Persons of
a State for the public benefit: The good of Democracy is Liberty, and the
Courage and Industry which Liberty begetts.

In this Kingdom the Laws are jointly made by a King, by a House of Peers, and
by a House of Commons chosen by the People, all having free Votes and
particular Privileges: The Government according to these Laws is trusted to
the King, Power of Treaties of War and Peace, of making Peers, of choosing
Officers and Councillors for State, Judges for Law, Commanders for Forts and
Castles, giving Commissions for raising men to make War abroad, or to prevent
or provide against Invasions or Insurrections at home, benefit of
Confiscations, power of pardoning, and some more of the like kind are placed
in the King. And this kind of regulated Monarchy having this power to preserve
that Authority, without which it would be disabled to preserve the Laws in
their Force, and the Subjects in their liberties and proprieties, is intended
to draw to him such a Respect and Relation from the great Ones, as may hinder
the ills of Division and Faction, and such a Fear and Reverence from the
people, as may hinder Tumults, Violence and licentiousness. Again, that the
Prince may not make use of this high and perpetual power to the hurt of those
for whose good he has it, and make use of the name of Public Necessity for
the gain of his private Favorites and Followers, to the detriment of his
People, the House of Commons (an excellent Conserver of Liberty, but never
intended for any share in Government, or the choosing of them that should
govern) is solely entrusted with the first Propositions concerning the Leavies
of Moneys (which is the sinews as well of Peace as War) and the impeaching of
those, who for their own ends, though countenanced by any surreptiously gotten
Command of the King, have violated that Law, which he is bound (when he knows
it) to protect, and to the protection of which they were bound to advise him,
at least not to serve him in the Contrary. And the Lords being trusted with a
Iudicatorie power, are an excellent Screen and Bank between the Prince and
People, to assist each against any Encroachments of the other, and by just
Judgments to preserve that Law, which ought to be the Rule of every one of the
three. For the better enabling them in this, beyond the Examples of any of Our
Ancestors, We were willingly contented to Oblige Our Self, both to call a
Parliament every three years, and not to dissolve it in fifty days, and for
the present exigent, the better to raise Money, and avoid the pressure (no
less grievous to Us then them) Our People must have suffered by a longer
continuance of so vast a Charge as two great Armies, and for their greater
certainty of having sufficient time to remedy the inconveniences arisen during
so long an absence of Parliaments, and for the punishment of the Causers and
Ministers of them, We yielded up Our Right of dissolving this Parliament,
expecting an extraordinary moderation from it in gratitude for so unexampled a
Grace, and little looking that any Malignant Party should have been encouraged
or enabled to have persuaded them, first to countenance the Injustices and
Indignities We have endured, and then by a new way of Satisfaction for what was
taken from Us, to demand of Us at once to Confirm what was so taken, and to
give up almost all the rest.

Since therefore the Power Legally placed in both Houses is more then
sufficient to prevent and restrain the power of Tyranny, and without the power
which is now asked from Us We shall not be able to discharge that Trust which
is the end of Monarchy, since this would be a total Subversion of the
Fundamental Laws, and that excellent Constitution of this Kingdom, which has
made this Nation so many years both Famous and happy to a great degree of
Envy; since to the power of punishing (which is already in your hands
according to Law) if the power of Preferring be added, We shall have nothing
left for Us, but to look on; since the incroaching of one of these Estates upon
the power of the other is unhappy in the effects both to them and all the rest;
since this power of at most a joint Government in Us with Our Counselors, (or
rather Our Guardians) will return Us to the worst kind of Minority, and make
Us despicable both at home and abroad, and beget eternal Factions and
Dissentions (as destructive to public Happiness as War) both in the chosen,
and the Houses that choose them, and the people who choose the Chusers; since so
new a power will undoubtedly intoxicate persons who were not born to it, and
beget not only Divisions among them as equals, but in them contempt of Us as
become an equal to them, and Insolence and Injustice toward Our people, as
now so much their inferiors, which will be the more grievous unto them, as
suffering from those who were so lately of a nearer degree to themselves, and
being to have redress only from those that placed them, and fearing they may
be inclined to preserve what they have made, both out of kindness and
policy; since all great changes are extremely inconvenient, and almost
infallibly beget yet greater Changes, which beget yet greater Inconveniences.

Since as great an one in the Church must follow this of the Kingdom; Since the
second Estate would in all probability follow the Fate of the first, and by
some of the same turbulent spirits Iealousies would be soon raised against
them, and the like Propositions for reconciliation of Differences would be then
sent to them, as they now have joined to send to Us, till (all Power being
vested in the House of Commons, and their number making them incapable of
transacting Affairs of State with the necessary Secrecy and expedition; those
being retrusted to some close Committee) at last the Common people (who in the
mean time must be flattered, and to whom License must be given in all their
wild humors, how contrary soever to established Law, or their own real Good)
discover this Arcanum Imperii, That all this was done by them, but not for
them, grow weary of Iourney-work, and set up for themselves, call Parity and
Independence, Liberty; devour that Estate which had devoured the rest; Destroy
all Rights and Proprieties, all distinctions of Families and Merit; And by this
means this splendid and excellently distinguished form of Government end in a
dark equal Chaos of Confusion, and the long Line of Our many noble Ancestors
in a Jack Cade, or a Wat Tyler.

For all these Reasons to all these demands Our Answer is, Nolumus Leges
Angliae mutari: But this We promise, that We will be as careful of preserving
the Laws in what is supposed to concern wholly Our Subjects, as in what most
concerns Our self: For indeed We profess to believe, that the preservation
of every Law concerns Us, those of obedience being not secure, when those of
protection are violated; And We being most of any injured in the least
violation of that, by which We enjoy the highest Rghts and greatest Benefits,
and are therefore obliged to defend no less by Our interest then by Our duty,
and hope that no Iealousies to the contrary shall be any longer nourished in
any of Our good People, by the subtle insinuations, and secret practices of
men, who for private ends are disaffected to Our Honor and Safety, and the
Peace and Prosperity of Our People. And to show you, that no just indignation
at so reproachful offers shall make Us refuse to grant what is probable to
conduce to the good of Our good People, because of the ill company it comes in,
We will search carefully in this heap of unreasonable Demands, for so much as
We may (complying with Our Conscience, and the duty of Our Trust) assent unto,
and shall accordingly agree to it.

In pursuance of which Search, in the 4th Proposition, under a Demand which
would take from Us that trust which God, Nature, and the Laws of the Land have
placed in Us, and of which none of you could endure to be deprived; We find
something to which We give this Answer, That We have committed the principal
places about Our Children to persons of Quality, Integrity and Piety, with
special regard that their Tender years might be so seasoned with the
Principles of the true Protestant Religion, as (by the blessing of God upon
this Our care) this whole Kingdom may in due time reap the fruit thereof: And
as We have been likewise very careful in the choice of Servants about them,
that none of them may be such, as by ill Principles, or by ill Examples to
cross Our endeavors for their Pious and Virtuous Education, so if there shall
be found (for all Our care to prevent it) any person about Our Children (or
about Us, which is more then you ask) against whom both Houses shall make
appear to Us any just exception, We shall not only remove them, but thank you
for the Information; Only We shall expect, that you shall be likewise careful
that there be no underhand dealing by any to seek faults, to make room for
others to succeed in their places.

For the 5th. Demand, as We will not suffer any to share with Us in our power
of Treaties, which are most improper for Parliaments, and least in those
Treaties in which We are neerlyest concerned, not only as a King but as a
Father, yet We do (such is Our desire to give all reasonable satisfaction)
assure you by the word of a King, that We shall never propose or entertain any
Treaty whatsoever for the marriage of any of Our Children, without due regard
to the true Protestant Profession, the good of Our Kingdoms, and the Honor of
Our Family.

For the 6th. Demand, concerning the Laws in force against Jesuits, Priests,
and Popish Recusants, We have by many of Our Messages to you, by Our voluntary
promise to you, so solemnly made never to pardon any Popish Priest, by Our
strict Proclamations lately published in this point, and by the public
Examples which we have made in that case since Our Residence at York, and
before at London sufficiently expressed Our zeal herein. Why do you then ask
that in which Our own Inclination has prevented you? And if you can yet find
any more effectual Course to disable them from Disturbing the State or eluding
the Law by trusts or otherwise, We shall willingly give Our Consent to it.

For the 7th. concerning the Votes of Popish Lords, We understand that they in
discretion have withdrawn themselves from the Service of the House of Peers,
(and had done so when use was publicly made of their names to asperse the
Votes of that House, which was then counted as Malignant as those (who are
called Our Unknown and Unsworne Counselors) are now) neither do We conceive
that such a Positive Law against the Votes of any whose blood gives them that
right, is so proper in regard of the Privilege of Parliament, but are content,
that so long as they shall not be conformable to the Doctrine and Discipline of
the Church of England, they shall not be admitted to sit in the House of Peers,
but only to give their Proxies to such Protestant Lords as they shall choose,
who are to dispose of them as they themselves shall think fit, without any
Reference at all to the Giver.

As to the desires for a Bill for the Education of the Children of Papists by
Protestants in the Protestant Profession, many about Us can witness with Us,
That We have often delivered Our Opinion, that such a Course (with Gods
blessing upon it) would be the most effect all for the rooting out of Popery
out of this Kingdom; We shall therefore thank you for it, and encourage you in
it, and, when it comes unto Us, do Our Duty; And We heartily wish, for the
public good, that the time you have spent in making Ordinances without Us, had
been employed in preparing this and other good Bills for Us.

For the 8th, touching The Reformation to be made of the Church Government and
Liturgy, We had hoped, that what We had formerly declared concerning the same,
had been so sufficiently understood by you and all good Subjects, that We
should not need to have expressed Our Self further in it. We told you in Our
Answers to your Petition presented to Us at Hampton Court the first of
December, That for any illegal Innovations which may have crept in, We should
willingly concur in the removal of them; That if Our Parliament should advise
Us to call a National Synod, which may duly examine such Ceremonies as give
just cause of Offense to any, We should take it into Consideration, and apply
Our Self to give due satisfaction therein; That We were persuaded in Our
Conscience, that no Church could be found upon the Earth, that professes the
true Religion with more purity of Doctrine, then the Church of England does,
nor where the Government and Discipline are jointly more beautified, and free
from Superstition, then as they are here established by Law; which (by the
grace of God We will with Constancy maintain (while We live) in their Purity
and Glory, not only against all Invasions of Popery, but also from the
Irreverence of those many Schismatics and Separatists, wherewith of late this
Kingdom and Our City of London abounds, to the great dishonor and hazard both
of Church and State; For the suppression of whom We required your timely and
active assistance. We told you in Our first Declaration, printed by the advice
of Our Privy Council, That for differences amongst our selves for matters
indifferent in their own nature concerning Religion, We should in tenderness
to any number of Our loving Subjects very willingly comply with the advice of
Our Parliament, that some Law might be made for the exemption of tender
Consciences from punishment or prosecution for such Ceremonies, and in such
Cases, which by the judgment of most men are held to be matters indifferent,
and of some to be absolutely unlawful; Provided, that this ease should be
attempted and pursued with that modesty, temper, and submission, that in the
mean time the Peace and quiet of the Kingdom be not disturbed, the Decency and
Comeliness of Gods Service discountenanced, nor the Pious, Sober, Devout
actions of those Reverend Persons who were the first Laborers in the blessed
Reformation, or of that time, be scandalled and defamed. And We heartily wish,
that others whom it concerned, had been as ready (as their duty bound them,
though they had not received it from Us) to have pursued this Caution, as We
were, and still are willing and ready to make good every particular of that
Promise. Nor did We only appear willing to join in so good a Work, when it
should be brought Us, but pressed and urged you to it by Our Message of the
fourteenth of February in these words, And because His Majesty observes great
and different troubles to arise in the hearts of His People, concerning the
Government and Liturgy of the Church, His Majesty is willing to declare, That
He will refer the whole consideration to the wisdom of His Parliament, which He
desires them to enter into speedily, that the present distractions about the
same may be composed: but desires not to be pressed to any single Act on His
part, till the whole be so digested and settled by both Houses, that His
Majesty may clearly see what is fit to be left, as well as what is fit to be
taken away: Of which We the more hoped of a good success to the general
satisfaction of Our People, because you seem in this Proposition to desire but
a Reformation, and not (as is daily preached for as necessary in those many
Conventicles which have within these nineteen months begun to swarm, and
which, though their Leaders differ from you in this opinion, yet appear to many
as countenanced by you, by not being punished by you, (few else, by reason of
the Order of the House of Commons of the 9th of September, daring to do it) a
destruction of the present Discipline and Liturgy. And We shall most
cheerfully give Our best assistance for raising a sufficient maintenance for
preaching Ministers, in such course as shall be most for the encouragement and
advancement of Piety and Learning.

For the Bills you mention, and the Consultation you intimate, knowing nothing
of the particular matters of the one (though We like the Titles well) nor of
the manner of the other, but from an Informer (to whom We give little credit,
and We wish no man did more) Common fame, We can say nothing till We see them.

For the 11th We would not have the Oath of all Privy Counselors and Judges
straightened to particular Statutes of one or two particular Parliaments, but
extend to all Statutes of all Parliaments, and the whole Law of the Land, and
shall willingly consent that an inquiry of all the breaches and violations of
the Law may be given in charge by the Justices of the Kings Bench every Term,
and by the Judges of Assize in their Circuits, and Justices of Peace at the
Sessions to be presented and punished according to Law.

For the 17th, We shall ever be most ready, (and We are sorry it should be
thought needful to move Us to it) not only to join with any (particularly
with the States of the united Provinces, of which We have given a late proof in
the Match of Our Daughter) for the defense and maintenance of Protestant
Religion, against all designs and attempts of the Pope and his adherents, but
singly (if need were) to oppose with Our life and fortune all such Designs in
all other Nations, were they joined: And that for Considerations of Conscience,
far more then any temporal end of obtaining access of strength and
reputation, or any natural end of restoring Our Royal Sister and her Princely
Issue to their Dignities and Dominions, though these be likewise much
considered by Us.

For the 18th. It was not Our fault, that an Act was not passed to clear the
Lord Kymbolton, and the five Members of the House of Commons, but yours, who
inserted such Clauses into both the Preamble and Act (perhaps persuaded to it
by some who wish not that you should in any thing receive satisfaction from Us)
as by passing the Preamble We must have wounded Our Honor against Our
Conscience, and by another Clause have admitted a Consequence, from which We
could never have been secured, by declaring, That no Member of either House,
upon any Accusation of Treason, could have his Person seized without the
Consent of that House, of which he is a Member, though the known Law be, That
Privilege of Parliament extends not to Treason, and if it did, any Member (the
House being for a short time adjourned, and so their Consent not being so had)
how treasonable soever his Intentions were, how clearly soever known, and how
suddenly soever to be executed, must have fair leave given him to go on and
pursue them, no way, how Legal soever, after the passing such a Clause, being
left to prevent it.

To conclude, We Conjure you and all Men to rest satisfied with the Truth of
Our Professions, and the Reality of Our Intentions; not to ask such things as
deny themselves; That you Declare against Tumults, and punish the Authors;
That you allow Us Our Propriety in Our Towns, Arms and Goods, and Our Share in
the Legislative Power, which would be counted in Us, not only breach of
Privilege, but Tyranny and Subversion of Parliaments to deny to you: And when
you shall have given Us satisfaction upon those Persons who have taken away the
One, and recalled those Declarations (particularly that of the 26th of May) and
those in the point of the Militia, (Our just Rights, wherein We will no more
part with then with Our Crown, lest We enable others by them to take that from
Us) which would take away the other; and declined the beginnings of a War
against Us, under pretense of Our Intention of making One against you: as We
have never opposed the first part of the 13th Demand, so We shall be ready to
concur with you in the latter.

And being then confident that the Credit of those Men, who desire a general
Combustion, will be so weakened with you, that they will not be able to do this
Kingdom any more harm, We shall be willing to grant Our general Pardon, with
such Exceptions as shall be thought fit, and shall receive much more joy in the
hope of a full and constant Happiness of Our People in the True Religion, and
under the Protection of the Law, by a blessed Union between Us and Our
Parliament (so much desired by Us) then in any such increase of Our Own Revenue
(how much soever beyond former Grants) as (when Our Subjects were wealthiest)
Our Parliament could have settled upon Us.

FINIS.
