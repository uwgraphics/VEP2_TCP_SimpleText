To the Loving Reider
GIf patience, vith confidence, of God hes had reuaird,

Gif perjury, and traitorie, be vices venomous,
Gif sclander, can rander, his master recompance
The Protestant so molestant, be al intelligence,
For hyi re, the fyi-re sal get of Cerberus.
Adieu.
TO ou ministers, and Prelattis of perdition
This schedul schort I do direct in plane
Sen violently e have fru-ition
Of that good spous, quhilk man cum hame agane
My counsall is e think her bot a lane
I mean the Kirk of CHRIST our Priest, and King
Quha for our thift I traist salbe our bane
That satan for our saull may dergie sing
Quha hes samony saulis in error brocht
To ou Conuoy to hell that Kindome dark
Sen miserable slauis lyk ou hes ever socht
To be accumpaneit in all yair evil vark
Sa did our Lord the reprobat ay mark
As members of sedition and stryf
That masters of ane evil steik of vark
Sold ay detest the godly vpricht life.
For sen the time that falls Apostat priest
Ennemie to Christ and mannis salvation
our master Knox, that vicked venomous beist
Vas chaissit from the Inglish nation
And come to ou to preiche abomination
In Scotland sumtyme Realm of re-noun
Extreme hes been that deso-lation
e have sustenit in city, tour, and town.
The Lord behaldis our Knaucrie great and small
our doctrine and our lyuis vicious
As of his sanctuary e brak the vall
Lymmers violent, falls, and se-ditious
Sik Pestis var never send pernicious:
Be God our Lord to Pharao the king
As ou quhom damnit Satan Cerberus,
Hes placit over Christianis to Rigne
Sik man sik master as is said
Sik try sik fructe all time ve se
And as our masters grund is laid
Lyk do the vallis and bigging be:
Father of leyis, stryf, and Iniquity,
^entation, blaspheme, thift, and all the laue
Sik childrene hes he procreat to be
Duollaris into his Babylon Geneue.
That chyre of Antichrist, and deso-lation,
That hure of Babylon, and Prince of Atheism
That Coup of poison for money realm and nation
Blasphemand CHRIST leuand in Barba-risme
Counsall that fosteris heresy and scisme,
Vitchecraft, adultery, and may gif e vill crave
Vith all the properteis of Sathannis drago-nisme
Place for the Antichrist in special is Ge-neue.
Money be fosterit under this huris band,
Diverse in manners, Doctrine, and con-dition,
Varkmen to Nemrod quha thocht to reich his hand
Heich to ye heauins to have fru-ition
Ane tour he beildit for tu-ition
From the deluge of valter him to save
Nemrod is Luther, sone of per-dition
That roman Antichrist blasphemous knave
Thus did proceid on pride and pre-sumption
This vark attemptit contrar the michtie Lord
As Nemrod vas ane man of great ambition
The halie vrit expreslie makis record
Bot quhen as he in place to have adord
His God and makar quha strenth unto him gave
Began to big that tour a thing ab-hord
As may be callit the Babylon Geneue.
Then God for just revenge of that their pride
Diversity of tungis unto them sent
And unto diverse cuntreis pat asyd
The varkmen of that monstreous intent
Quhilk the posterity Justly may repent
That unity of speiche vas then dissoluit
Nane understood quhat another meant
Vith confusion sua vas al thing in-uoluit.
Sua quhen our master Lucifer the Devil
Be ou his kingdom planelie had e-rectit
Detractand CHRIST reddie to all evil
Cofferit vithin ou for feir to be suspectit
God hes our tungis and myndis sa far deiectit
As nou dois vitnes our varkis and vritting is haill
Vith contradictions, and lesingis haill infectit
Profane protestantis, lament, murne and beuail.
After that Satan his horn begoud to blau
In diverse nations of Christianity
To raise his kingdom tentation did sau
Into ye hairtis of men in all degrie
First to blaspheme the name of God so hie
Nixt of his sone from death that did us save
And then all sanctis, vith his mother MARIE
As planelie testefeis that Babylon Geneue.
Bot it quha vald of Scotland knau the stait
Ay sen the eir of God threscore and ane
In place of prayer it did embrace debait
So Satan led men steid fast be the mane
That nather Lord nor knicht he lute a-lane
Except his coup var vachtit out aluay
Seasonit vith blaspheme, sacrilege, disdain
All godly life, and cheritie to slay.
Attour that serpent of our deformation
In every town and city he arryuit
Realm, kingdom, cuntrie, or nation,
Vith all his micht and force ay still he stryuit
That lauchfull pastors of the Kirk sold be depryuit
And sacrifice of the Altar eik aboleist
Thus is our Antichrist be S. Iohne descryuit
Blasphemand CHRIST our king, prophet, and priest.
Denyand scripturis plane and places good
Buikis, volumes, and Propheceis so treu
May plane Euangellis quhilk ar our saulis fude
Vrittin in the auld, and eik the Testament neu
Thus Satan in our knauish luggis bleu
Still to deny all treuth and verity
Sua that amang ou salbe fund richt feu
Bot ar infectit vith deulish blasphemy
Quhairfore sen nou their thingis be manifest,
And time requyris amendment of missis,
our deulish heresy at al time can not lest,
Bot as God louis his flock sa he them blissis
Lykuyse the visdome of the halie spreit ay vishis

And Blakuod four to Geneue haist vith speid.
Sua that ane metar man in my opinion
Can not be fund oeconomus to be
Na metar cuik nor Durie that fed loun

Discord amang ou to make our euins od
For gif e suffer he vil grou daily strangar.

For he subscryuit e knau: he can not hallou,
Except it be his cop, to sup, and suallou,
Gif e proceid to excom-munication,
For et not boyd of Glasgou vas his fallou

Dunkeson the knave vil never amend.
Bot it good Lord, quha anis thy name hes kend

Vith thy elect Arbuthnot I commend,
Althocht the laue to Geneue haist vith speid.
Balcanqual salbe corporal first in place

Vith michel als quha vranguslie both leid.

Var not thou seis full ill the band to leid
The less experience hes thou thy flock to save
Kilt up thy Connie to Geneue haist vith speid.
The other number of the congregation,
Redaris, exhortaris, or quhatsumeuir they be
That leuis this day into the Scottis nation
Let them prepare, and hy them haistelie
Vith bag, and baggage, pak up richt suddanlie
Memoriallis, vrittingis, letteris, nedil, and threid,
For nou their glass is run as e may se
Sua that of force to Geneue man they speid.
Nou for our vage that e may byt and gnau
For every day I make ou assignation
To tak the curse and vengeance I can schau
Of infenit people into that nation
That cryis to heauin: Lord for thy passion
Deliver us from this bondage miserable
Quhair thy name is in abhomi-nation.
That the to serve thy seruandis may be abill.
Curse of the infantis gottin in adultery
Fornication, Incest, filthy synnis all
Curse of the husbandis that leuis separatlie
From lauchfull vyf to the Adulteres thral
Curse of the people quha on the Lord do call
For Pastors, and Sacramentis, the saulis remeid
Curse of the pure in number great, and small,
Quhom e have scurgit, and hungerit to the deid.
Curse of the seik, lying in paynis strange
And sufferis dolor vith torment infenit
To quhoum in saul and body e do vrang
Barring auay that heauinlie benefeit,
And confortable sacrament, both of drink and meit
As planelie testefeis that saxt chapter of Iohne
A neidfull mean unto that kingdom sueit
As lykuse is that holy Unction.
Curse of the Kirk our mother spiritual
Quhom e have robbit and spul eit of her richt
Curse of our Saluiour her spous celestial
Quhom e deny pouar to have, or micht,
And callis him lear: O ennemeis of licht!
Curse of the Bischops, and Doctors of his kirk,
Quhom he hes ordanit as ey-is of her sicht,
Curse of the saulis quhom e keip in the mirk.
Curse for our breking of that Sacrament
And haly band of sacred Matremony
Quhilk e rebellis to Christis testament
Callis bastard: Double sonnis of Deuilrie!
S. Paul hes cursit ou in this point I se
Moses forbad ou to give the nichbouris vyf
To the vnlauchful husbandis cumpanie
Cursit be e in all our eage and life.
Cursit be e be CHRIST our saluiour
For breking of that godly ordonnance
Necessar office in kirk call it Ordour
Quhilk e bastard villanis of diffidence
In plane contempt of his pre-eminence
Lyk turk and Iou vith Satan do detest
O vepers forgit of malice and offense!
Judas sall Judge ou, and God sall scale our nest.
e mereit surely for recompance and pane
A thousand cursis daily at our rising
Gif godly Noe var leuand anis agane
He sold accuse our filthy, falls, misgysing
Of haly Kirk: our temerar dispysing:
e Sodometis discouerit hes her members:
Cursit be e for that our il a vysing
traitors to God, and to our prences lymmers.
Cursit be e quhais tung did flame our Queen
Cursit be e, quha thocht to sell our King
Traitors to God: to Inglish men I vene
our treason strange our fyrie breist sall ding
e gat the purse, and vaitit better thing
To sell the sone, as e did fleme the mother:
Unhappy clan, peruersit, and malign,
The schip is vrang quhen e do steir the ruther.
Cursit be e for templis casting down,
Cursit be e for our consente-ment,
To slauchter of that friend unto the croun
Fructis of our faith, peruersit Judgment,
Treason, invy, slauchter, ar our intent
Sua that the godly may not leave amang ou
I traist to se the day e salbe schent
That for their faultis King James the saxt sal hang ou
And als of liberality sal e have
The malediction of God omnipotent
His name, Angellis, sanctis, and all the laue
Quhom e blasphemit hail, vith villis bent,
Coniurit scurriors of the Antichryst repent,
Leave of in time Christis people to deceive
Unless e vald incur ye Judgment
In hell to duol vith Pluto leying knave.
Restore, thy glore, O lord I the beseik
Indeu, vith treu, intelligence thy flock
Thou scis, the leyis, thy ennemeis seik
Thy name, to blame, as they have thy Rock S. T.
Cum lord, ac-cord, reneu thy ock
That teichers, and Preichers, had in thy Kirk
Auail, preuail, destroy the block
That vurkis, their turkis, aganis the in mirk
That ve may sing, thy Pray-se benign
To the condign, O-ur Lord and King.
AMEN.
