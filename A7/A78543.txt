PLUS VLTRA.
To the Parliament of England,
THat you have made the Earth to shake, and the Seas to tremble under you:
(even Earthly men, and Seas of their Traditions) the power of the Lord is
magnified, and you are highly honored.

Would you now die like men, or live like the Sons of God? Remember whereto you
are exalted. Remember from whence you are fallen.

Do the first works, and let the last be better then the first. Take off every
burden, and let the oppressed go free.

Your Navy shall be maintained, freedom of Trade regained, Impost and Customs
cased:

Your Armies shall be duly paid, Assesment and (...).

Let but the people (who chose you) choose 2. Out of each Remotest -- and 4. out
of each well-affected County: (not Cavaliers least they offend you, not
Committee -- nor long Gown'd-men, lest they offend them; but un-byassed,
un-interressed Gentlemen or Yeomen) and let the Soldier (whom you chose) choose
one or more out of every Regiment, to consult and judge with you, concerning
the proposals to be offered.

If it succeed, you may be established. If it fail, yet may you gather in the
dispersed thoughts and wisdom of the Nation and obtain help and assistance for
those great affairs which multiply and oppress you.

Neverthelsse, I freely offer my life the pawn of my confidence in the success,
if you are pleased to put it to the trial, If not, yet have I discharged my
Duty and Engagement; but, in despising the day of small things, Armies will be
increased upon you, and murmurings against you: as Taxes and Assesments on the
people.

Great mischiefs happen but once. The Poor Man's Advocate would have prevented
all.

I have lost, I have suffered many things; You have given, you have granted me
nothing. Yet smile, and vote me

Your Sober Friend, and humble Servent in the Lord, PETER CHAMBERLAIN.
10. April 1651.
