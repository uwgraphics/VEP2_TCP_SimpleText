THE IESVITS UNDERMINING OF Parliaments and Protestants With their foolish
fancy of a TOLERATION Discovered, and Censured.
IT seems to wise men exceeding strange, that Ignatius Loyola a worn
Soldier, a man of very little Learning (when he was merely necessitated by
breaking of his leg to leave Mars and follow Mercury) should in less then
ten years become such a grand proficient, as to procure from the Sea of Rome
the last new order of Jesuits; whose number at first was but small. But after
some time, the Pope finding them to be well verst and most acute in all kind of
literature, exceeding active in undertaking, and men no less able then willing
to support the Papacy, which (without their unexpected rising like Locusts out
of the pit) had undoubtedly long since fallen without any hope of recovery,
their number was from time to time enlarged, until it became as now it is in
all Kingdoms (where the Pope has any thing to do) unlimited and unsatisfied.
But it seems yet much more strange that Christian Princes, to whom the
Jesuits incomparable treasons, cruelties, adulteries, perfidious and crafty
stratagems are so well known, should permit any of these Locusts to remain
within their coasts. Yea or that Jesuits themselves whose matchless treasons
and treacheries, since the time of reformation, have been so often discovered,
and punished with no less then setting their quarters assunder, should be so
audaciously confident as to conceive such extraordinary power or policy in
themselves as to be able to reduce these Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, to the blind obedience, I should say the miserable slavery of
Antichrist. And yet they have often attempted that since the beginning of King
James his reign, and are not yet utterly out of hope to effect it;
notwithstanding the present clear discovery of their damnable designs, and
the strong opposition which is daily made against them: But the infernal
practices, and most irreligious positions of these Jesults, the weak and
improbable means which their carnal wisdom has proposed unto themselves,
together with the general detestation of them and their tenants in these
Kingdoms, may somewhat though not altogether secure us that they shall never
be able to effect their so long desired toleration, which once obtained an
utter extirpation of Protestants might soon follow after, for such are their
principles. There was indeed not many years since some grounds of their hopes:
when instead of being close hid in vaults, they boldly walked the streets; when
instead of being imprisoned, and having the Law executed upon them, they were
preferred to be Confessors to great Court-Ladies, where they were very
plentifully fed, and royally maintained; when being imprisoned, they were soon
enlarged by a Secretary of State, one of their own society: when they had an
Arrchbishop after their own heart, (from whom holding intelligence with the
Pope) they found greater favor with him then did the sincere professors of the
Gospel. But that still they should flatter themselves with a hope of a
toleration, plainly shows them to be (what they are) most audaciously bold
and impudently restless, which that it may more plainly appear, I shall here
briefly discover so many of their hellish positions and practices as may justly
render them as well formidable as odious.

To begin then with their dangerous positions: First, they maintain that
Princes are so subordinate to the Pope as that he may as he shall see cause
discharge their Subjects from their loyalty and obedience; yea and depose them,
and confer their Kingdoms at his pleasure: nay further, that in case they will
not come in and submit to his Holiness (after admonition and excommuication)
that their subjects may and ought to rise up against them and destroy them;
which doctrine, how contrary it is to Scripture, the often repeated precepts,
and practices of the Prophets and Apostles, yea and of Christ himself
sufficiently declare.

Here the Jesuits as is their usual manner double extremely, according to the
men they have to do withal, if it be with a Papist they dare justify the
premises in each particular, in that the power and liberty of the Catholic
Church is boundless, and in that they kill them not as Kings, but as favorers
of heretics; but if they have to do with a Protestant, who abhors the very
thought of deposing much more of killing of Kings, then they say that it is but
a private opinion of some over zealous Catholics, not the doctrine of the
whole Church. Again, they answer by the way of recrimination, that the late
arms of Scotland, and the present preparations of England for war prove them
to hold the foresaid tenants. As if there were no difference between
discharging subjects from their due obedience, and the setting a Kingdom in
fit posture of war, when foreign invasions and homebred conspiracies (in the
judgment of Parliament, the Grand-Councell of the Land) do threaten the
present utter ruin both of King and Kingdom. As if it were the same to
deprive the King, or lay violent hand on the Lords anointed, as to desire his
government may be regulated according to law; or in case of extreme necessity
to endeavor the removing the wicked from the King, which is so far from being
dishonorable or prejudicial to his Majesty, as that in the end it will prove
the most effectual means for the more firm establishing of his throne. A
second detestable position of Jesuits, is that of equivocation, which they
style a safe holy mental reservation; but we more properly the art of lying:
for confirmation of which their lying reservation they produce the authority of
the Counsel of Constance, Anno 1414. which took it self not bound to keep
faith with heretics, though the same were solemnly sworn. Whence they infer,
they are much less bound to speak the truth although urged by oath. And they
further confirm that by the example of Pope Eugenius, who gave liberty to
Hildeslaus King of Hungary to break faith with Amurath the Turk, and
persuaded him to it. I wonder they do not remember what the fearful event
was of the liberty so given, and taken; was not Hildeslaus after many great
victories obtained, and a peace concluded, the most advantageous that ever was,
upon the breaking of his faith, not only beaten in the battle when he was far
stronger then ever, But he lost his honor, his army, his life, the Empire of
Greece, and a great part of his own Kingdom, which could never be recovered?

Why do not these acute learned Jesuits remember that the oath is made to the
living God, not to the dying man? were they so well versed in holy writ, as
they pretend, they should find misery and destruction to be the reward of
Perjury, and infidelity. Did not Zedekiah for breaking faith with a Pagan see
his children and servants slain before his eyes, after which his own eyes were
torn out of his head? How were the Israelites miserably afflicted in King
David's time, with 3 years famine for Saul's slaying of the Gibeonites? whose
preservation was sworn 400 years before, by the congregation of Israel, which
agreement, though it were fraudulently obtained by the Gibeonites, yet the
Israelites having by oath confirmed it in the name of the Lord dared not break
it: And though Saul were so bold as to violate the covenant so solemnly sworn,
yet just vengeance ceased upon his posterity, whereof seven of them were
delivered into the hands of the Gibennites whom they hanged up before the Lord,
and the famine ceased. And although they account us Protestants but Heretics,
and infidells yet they might likewise remember that Abraham swear to many
unbelieving Princes, Isaac gave his faith, and observed it to Abimelcch, Jacob
and his sons, especially Joseph, were allied and lived with the Egyptians.
And for their distinctions in promises, it will breed in short time such
confusion in all the states of Europe, as there will be nothing more pernicious
and lamentable; For if a serious promise, much more a solemn oath shall not be
kept inviolable upon what agreement may any rely upon? There are few towns,
castles, Cities, governments, that are not bound by oath. The Protestant by
oath takes assurance of the Papists. The Papists of the Protestants. Kings
from their Subjects. Subjects from their Kings, By oaths the lives and states
(...) all men are tried, and the whole religious world governned. How can this
Kingdom, or any other stand long, if equivocation prevail so far as that
things covenanted and sorwn need not to be observed? This once known there can
be no end of war, nor hope of peace, nor safety to treat of. Shall it be made
but a bait for lying, treason, and cruelty, by which our Predecessors passed
through the arms of their enemies, and through the weapons of their most
hateful soes. The Romans ignorant of the true God, in their swearing, and
contracting alliances were wont to say, O Jupiter smite, and with lightning
blast him, whosoever he be that is here with an intent to deceive; what can be
more horrible, then to cover falsehood with the name of the living God? We may
not touch them said the Princes of Israel meaning the Gibeonites, because we
have sworn to them in the name of the living God. Now then that Jesuits dare to
take liberty to themselves and dispense with others to equivocate to the
breach of faith given upon oath, we may safely conclude that they give the
greatest wound to Chistian society as ever it received

A third no less perilous then arrogant positio^ of Jesuits is blind obedience
to their conclusions and commands, be they never so differing, nay never so
contrary to the law of God, of nature, of nations. They indeed by virtue of
their order are bound to obey their general, though his command extend to the
killing of a King. And whereas their general is ever a Spaniard, be the
Jesuits English, Scottish, French, Dutch or of any other nation whatsoever, he
must venture upon the person of his own natural Prince, rather then the
Catholic King might suffer, and so the Romish cause (which is upon the matter
only supported by him) might come in jeopardy. But it does not hence follow,
that the people should herein follow their blind guides who dare publish to
the world that they under his Holiness can pardon slippes to Gods
commandments, But can afford no pardon unto those who break the
commandments of the Church, which how far it does derogate from the Majesty
and authority of God, and his holy word let not only religious, but even
rational men judge. I will now instance in one more no less dangerous then
blasphemous position of Jesuits, upon which the three former, and many more
are grounded, namely, that the Church is above the Scriptures and so judges of
the Scriptures, as that she may reproove or reject Scripture, as she shall
think fit, that the Church and the head thereof, the Pope, is the rule of
faith, better known and far more certain then are the Scriptures, by whom
Scripture ought to be judged, and not either Pope or Church by Scripture,
whereas in truth the Scripture affords such a clear and perfect light as may
sufficiently guide our feet in the way of truth, and fully instruct us what we
are to believe, and what we are to do, what to affect and what to hope, which
four contains the whole duty of a Christian. To say no more, the Church
became the Church, by receiving, believing, and so lowing the Scriptures from
which when it shall in any sort vary it is, no more the Church of God. And now
to their dangerous positions, I shall add so many of their bloody, nefarious
practices, as may in all reason indue those, who most admire and are most
addicted to them, to detest and abandon them. It is well known how often and
how miraculously Queen Elisabeth escaped their many close contrived plots
aagainst her person, and kingdom. And it is no less known that in the
beginning of King James his reign, an impudent petition for a toleration
co^trived by father Garnet and other Jesuits was preferred to his Majesty, but
advisedly rejected upon the Archbishop Abbots grave counsel to the King. Upon
the rejecting of which their audacious petition growing desperate, they
enterprised by the advice of the said Garnet, the gunpowder-treason, the most
cruel and barbarous as ever was heard of, which had it taken, it had been
accompanied with a greaer effusion of blood, then was the massacre in France,
but herein much more destructive, when King, Prince, Nobles, Gentry, and the
whole wisdom of the land should have received an irrecoverable blow, in being
blown up in a moment: so as the amassed headless people not able to resist
them, and their army, being at an instant in readiness, they must have yielded
to them both in matter of religion, and liberty, or have been miserably
slaughtered by them, A man might reasonably have concluded that such a
matchless treason, and bloody design upon King and kingdom should have
produced execution of law to the extirpation of them, and a dissipation of
their Jesuiticall adherents. But such was then their interest with foreign
Princes subject to Rome, especially with the King of Spain, and his pentioners
here, some of our Nobility, Church-papists (whose entertainment came to no
less then 3000 l. or 4000 l. a year) as that after execution done upon some
few of them, the father due prosecution of Law was stopped, yea so powerful
and prevalent were our Spanish pensioners, with King James (a very wise Prince)
as they by many importunate solicitations induced him to yield to somethings,
and to deny other things, which have, or may prove exceeding prejudicial to
him, and his royal posterity, to the peace, and tranquillity of the Kingdom,
and the protestant religion now established. First, his Majesty was drawn on to
conclude a peace with the King of Spain the most disadvantagious to this
Kingdom as ever was, were it but for one particular (which indeed was rested in
but upon the concluding of the Articles) and it was this, that no English be
permitted to trade in the West Indies, and if any did venture so to do, they
should be hanged and tortured without mercy. Hence it followed, that the
English who had resolved with the Netherlands for the sending of ten thousand
men between them into those parts, were so deterred, as that our best friends
the Netherlands were left to shift for themselves; who thanks be to God have
got a greater footing in Brasill, (not the tenth part of America, yet bigger
then three Englands) then that the Spaniard will be ever able to remove them
thence. And whilst the English have for many years sat still, and have not in
the general dared to adventure into those parts, the Pilatage into those
spacious and goodly Countries has been by us well nigh lost, and the King of
Spain so well enabled by a yearly abundant coming in of his vast treasure
there, to make full and due payment to his Jesuiticall pensioners here, as that
ever since they have performed such faithful service unto him as may shortly
prove destructive to these Kingdoms, if not timely foreseen, and prevented by
the wisdom and blessed accord of his Majesty, and this his present Parliament.
And lest any thing should be wanting to the Catholic King undertaking the
Catholic cause, his faithful pensioners persuaded King James to arm the
King of Spain with 20^0. pieces of Ordnance, under color of which license,
one Sir John Fern transported twice as many more. What others did here in is
not so well known; but by wise men who have had knowledge of former times, it
is conceived that if the King of Spain were as well prepared with men and
shipping, as he is with guns and ammunition from us, he might beat us with our
own weapons.

A third thing wherein King James was strangley abused by the Spanish pensioners
the best friends to Jesuits, was that by reason of their continual crying up
his boundless prerogative a point, which Princes generally are overmuch
pleased to hear of, his Majesty (though otherwise very judicious) was at last
drawn to di^affect and undervalue Parliaments as intrenching too much upon his
royal prerogative by how much they did more carefully endeavor to preserve
the laws enacted, in their full strength and to enact other laws as might tend
but to due regulating of regal power, which ought never to exceed law, but
when it tends to the releife of the subject in mitigating the vigor of law,
not to the oppressing and impoverishing of them with illegal Monopolies, and
unwarrantable taxations.

I might instance in many other particulars, but one more shall suffice to show
how prevalent the Spanish faction were with King James, when upon the motion of
Gundumore that arch politician seconded by their strong approbation, his
Majesty neglecting the profers of some German Protestant Princes, did
condescend to send his only son and heir into Spain for the contracting of
a marriage there with the Spanish Kings Sister, one of a contrary Religion,
which had it accordingly proceeded, it might have proved more inconvenient and
troublesome then has his marriage with France. How the Jesuits, and Jesuiticall
Spanish pensioners plots have succeeded since the access of his Majesty that
now is, unto the Crown, I need not relate at large, the wisdom of this
present Parliament has saved me that labor in their first unanswerable
remonstrance. I shall therefore only briefly mention some of the chief, after
which I shall lay forth their yet more bold practizes, and bloody executions in
France, and else where.

The first was the laying of their foundation at the conclave at Rome where it
was concluded that his holiness should have a Nuntio in England, and the Queen
of England should have an agent at Rome to act things here, as should be there
resolved upon.

The 2. was to persuade his Majesty by meditation of the Queen (whom they too
well knew) he did as entirely love, as if she had bin of his own Religion, to
prefer those to places of dignity at Court and of judicature both in Church,
and common weal as might serve to put in execution their mischewous designs.
Whence it came most unhappily to pass that the Spanish pensioners became here
Cabinet Counselors, so usually over-awing, and overswaying the far greater,
and better part of the privy Council, as that their mere proposalls past for
resolutions: and hence it was that the Star Chamber (where these Jesuiticall
pensioners and such as they had promoted bare Sway) did abound with extravagate
censures no less unconsionable, then terrible, to the oppressing of the common
people, by maintaining illegal taxations, and unwarrantable monopolies and in
advancing prerogatives far beyond all the presidents of former times, And
Shurely had it not bin for those exceeding powerful Popish factors, the high
commition had no dares so eagerly to oppose true Religion by suspentions,
deprivations, excommunications, fines, and imprisonments much les would some
Bishops, and in eriour ecclesiastical Courts have adventured with such
animosity: to propose or bitterness, to persecute their own superstitions
articles: as if they had bin Cannons concluded upon by the whole Church of
England, (as then consisting only of Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Cathedral
Priests and 2. such country Clerks as every Bishop and his Sly official
thought good off,) ought to bind the whole Church being so partially if not
corruptly represented, For what are Cathedral Church but such places as Queen
Elizabeth and her Council for some by Political ends were pleased to let rest
in some part of that Popist splendour which might take with neighboring Princes,
and not render her, and her people utterly irreconcilable to the Church of Rome
when as yet the Parochill Churchs here were better cleansed from Popish relickes
according to the well settled constitution of other reformed Churches, and yet
for south these better refined Parochial Churches must again be reduced to a
Cathedral garb why. But that it is more ceremonecus, more Majesticall and
therein more resembles Rome. To conclude this point by reason of the
oversweling greatness of those Cabinet Councillors, men were preferred to
places of Judicature in the commonweal, which either could not, or would not
maintain Justice but were always forward to advance prerogative, above and
against law witness some millions of money in few years wrested from the
subject under the name of Loan Knighthood Ship Coat, and conducte money, by
color of forest law the Statute of improvement the commission of severs
abused Tunnage, and Poundage inhaunced by unwarrantable rates.

All which though unlawful yet were they all either justified by the most part
of the Judges, or the people miserablely oppressed (whilst being debarred the
usual remedy at law either by Habeas corpus or otherwise) they were left
destitute of all legal defense for the preservation of their goods, or persons.

A 3. Jesuiticall plot was to weaken his Majesty both at whom and ahroad. Which
way could they more weaken him here in England then to employ the Cabinet
Council to peswade him to make sail of his own propper hereditary land, and
to raise money for the supporting of his royal Dignity, by unlawful or
unufuall means which could not but much with draw the dutiful affection of
his subjects from him wherein his chiefest strenght consists, And how could
they have devised more to have lessened the repute of his wisdom and puissance
with foreign Princes then by inciting his Majesty to begin war and conclude
peace both with France, and Spain, partly without and paetly against the
approbation of Parliament swherunto may be added the taking of Rochell by the
aid of his Majesty's ships the little assistance, or countenance which of
latrer times has bin from England afforded unto our best friends the
Neitherlands And from all these promises yet may strongly be concluded that
these were destructive ways to the Protestant Religion and therefore promoted,
and prosecuted by Jesuits, and persons Popistly addicted.

A 4. plot as to overaw and impowerish the whole Kingdom by billiting
souldiets in all parts of it, by intending to bring in foreign forces
especially many hundreds of German horses and by proposing Martial law to be
put in execution which had it taken affect, it would much more have impowerish
the land then have many millions of money exacted from the subject hince his
Majesty's reign; merely under a pretense of law when there was neither reason,
law nor equity for the raising of the least part of those infinite sum, which
yet had they bin employed in any reasonable proportion either for the good of
King or Kingdom, neither King, nor Kingdom had bin so destressed as now they
are. But the truth is as they were illegally imposed, so they have bin as
faudelently disposed without his Majesty's privitie even to the strenghtning of
the professed enemies of our Religion which now threatten no less then the
bringing under, if not the utter extirpation thereof.

A 5. design was at once to embrace, and imbecell the coin of the Kingdom by
making brass money as current, and more common then silver whilst our gold was
so slyly convoyed away as that in the greatest payments, the tenth of that
gold, which formerly has bin usually mad, could in no place appear, and how
should it be otherwise when the French (to omit other nations) of all sects
and conditions from the highest to the lowest, for the enriching of the Popish
Jesuiticall party there have bin permitted to carry it away. How much Queen
mother had for here share is not exactly known but it is conceived upon very
good grounds that she, and her Jesuiticall train have had 2 Millions of money
which is ten times as much as the Queen her daughter brought into this Land.

Another deep plot of the Jesuits was grounded upon their intimate
acquaintance, with Canterbury and Wren and other such like Popishly affected
prelate whereby they procured the discountenancing yea and the suppression of
the most able most sincere and most faithful Ministers of the gospel. When in
the mean time countenance, and maintenance yea and the greatest preferments
were conferred upon Arminian Socinian Priests upon meert Formalists and time
serving preachers whose poisonous, tenants in somethings are the same with
Rome, In other far worse and more dangerous, as being more subtly contriced.

Upon such who had, only a show of godliness and were more for the ceremony
then the substance of Religion: such as were most forward in their Sermons at
Court or in other eminent places to cry up the unlimited power and prerogative
of the King to the perverting of law and in as much as in them lay to the utter
debarring of the people from their ancient liberties and immunities, from all
right and property in their own proper goods.

But of all the Jesuiticall plots that which is now in action: the separating
of his Majesty from his Parliament and the working an ill opinion in some
people and counties against their own representative body so advisedly
aggregated in all shires, is most fearful and admirably desperate. For who
could imagine (did it not evidently appear) that the Jesuits and Spanish
pensioners should have such a powerful influence with his Majesty or be so
prevalent with to conte^ptible number of Nobles and co^ non people as to make
his Majesty and them believe that this Parliament is set against him and the
good of the land. And that Privados, Sycophantizing and time serving courtiers
(who for the most part are blinded and transported with those by respects of
profit or preferment) should be better affected, better able to see and advise
then they are for the good and safety both of King and Kingdom. This in the
general is the Jesuits last plot now in agitation, but that consists of many
branches very considerable: among which take special notice of some few
particulars here and there scattered in some papers lately published by the
Jesuiticall faction in his Majesty's name, whose person they have captivated,
and whose power they have ceazed upon. They dare boldly affirm with the
greatest confidence that the regal power is so derived from God, and the law
as that it has no dependence upon the trust and consent of man, but is
absolutely boundles and indefinitely supreme as well universis as singulis: so
over all, that he may dispose of all at pleasure and be no way accountable to
the Kingdom. That the being of Parliament is merely of grace, and may only
counsel in some things but not determine in any thing. That the major part in
Parliament is not considerable when many are absent or dissent, or when some
few overaw and over rule the rest. That Parliaments may do dishonorable nay
treasonable things and are questionable and triable elsewhere. As if it were
probable that the wisdom, and till now the never suspected integrity of both
houses of Parliament could ever prove so treacherous to King or Kingdom or so
careless of themselves, and their posterity as to do things dishonest and
treasonable.

Or as if it were credible that men for the most part never formerly known to
his Majesty, nor never greatly entrusted by him, or the State, should be able
to give more faithful counsel then the Parliament, or to be less subject to
erroneous advises, to desperate, and treasonable resolutions, then are those
who now sit in Parliament, whose great pains, prudence, and patience, we to
whom the benefit has and will redound, have great cause to bless God for; As
if a few factious persons (were they deservedly so censured) were able to lead
the whole Parliament the wisdom of the land. That a country jury of twely men
may be misled by two subtle Knaves, is not musuall, but that four hundred or
five hundred gentlemen, so considerately chosen as these were in all counties,
should be so abused, as without any show of probability, Unless we conceive
that those few accused members work by no ordinary means; And if it were
granted (as few truly religious will grant it) that those accused members were
any way guilty of misdemeanors, yea or of treason against his Majesty, and the
government established, yet it is but reasonable that their offenses should be
examined and decided by Parliament: otherwise upon mere pretenses the
Parliament might be extremly dismembered, And in case the whole body of
Parliament do err, yet it cannot be reasonably conceived, that the body of
this Parliament, and their resolutions are questionable, and triable by any
other power, then by some succeeding Parliament.

Oh then that all protestants, would seriously consider how the foresaid
positions tend to the dissolving not only of this, but of all other
Parliaments, without whose assistance neither our religion, nor our liberties
have any hope of continuance, by reason of many hellish subtle contrivements
of Jesuits, who as they have from their first original disturbed many other
Nations, so now they have procured our present calamities, and a geeat effusion
of blood in Ireland I cannot at large relate what they have no less tree cherou
ly contrived then bloodily executed in France, Germany, and other places, yet I
may not altogether pass them over in regard we may be admonished, and thereby
armed against these firebrands of Christendom, who in these our times are no
less insolent, and dangerous to kingdoms, and States, then were their
forefathers, and founders the Popes of Rome.

The great Massacre of France, wherein were slain more then 50000, was the
Jesuits damnable plot, and so were the murders of the two French Kings Henry
the third and Henry the fourth.

Henry the third was bred a papist from his cradle, and when he became a man
while he was Duke he was made general of the popish forces, and gave the
protestants that fatal blow at the battle of Mouncounter, and made them sue for
peace and after he was King, he maintained the Roman Religion to the uttermost
of his power. And yet because he gave peace to the Hugonets whom he could not
constrain and because he had compassion of his poor people eaten up with the
arms of strangers, And because the cries of the widow and fatherless pierced
his royal heart, and because he would not deliver the crown it self unto the
hands of his vassals, he was wounded to death, and the fact approved as
meritorious. And for Henry the fo^r^h though he changed the profession of the
protestant religion, which he had professed from his childhood, and though he
caused his own children, and the next Princes of the blood to be trained up in
popery, and to have Jesuits for their Instructors, yet because he would not
continue the civil wair, in his own country, and turn the sword against the
Huganites who had most faithfully served him in his greatest distress, and
because he would not break of his leagues, and prove ungrateful to his
protestant Princes and States which had assisted him with men, and money in
attaining the crown he was shameful, murdered by the procurement of Jesuits.
Oh that he had been more const^n^ in the way of his religion, that he had
depended more upon the power, and providence of the Almighty, and less upon
the arm of flesh, for the preservation and continuance of his kingdom, then
undoubtedly that God who so often protected would also have protected him
against Raveliack. And oh that our King would seriously consider the untimely
end of both those french Kings murdered by Jesuits though professing, and
maintaining popery then might we hope that his Majesty who deeply professes
to live, and die, in the protestant religion would cause the laws to be
severely executed upon these King-killing Athisticall agents for the Pope.

In Germany the Duke of Saxony, and many more other Luthran Princes, have of
late been miserably deluded by Jesuits who induced them to stand Ne^ters whilst
the Emeprour with his Popish army plundered the most part of Germany, and has
perplexed, and well uigh destroyed that Goodly Country, with twenty years
war, Which has consumed many thousands of Luthrans, as well as Calvenists,
al which ealamities, and slaughters might have been prevented, had they not
been unhappily disunited by the subtilety of Jesuits. In Polonia now lately
they have kindled such a fire betwixt the King and his subjects, as that they
who choose him with one general consent do now think how to be ridd of him
by reason that through their Councels he entrencheth upon their Liberties more
he ought to do.

And in V^nis where Popery is professed they have been long since Bannished by
reason of their treacheries, cruelties, and insolent inte meddling with state
affairs, wherein they do but resemble their holy Fathers the Popes of Rome
whose pride, cruelties and treachries were such, as no Christian could believe
them, were they not recorded by their own popish authors.

And yet these Jesuits the Poopes youngest sons do in all the forenamed
respects and many more equal them especially in regard of their audacious
intermedling with State affairs.

As the popes heretofore have disturbed kingdomns, destroyed kingdoms and
confirred kingdoms from nation to nation, from family to Family, so now his
dear sons the IESVITES take upon them, by his leave to do no less, How
have they set the FRENCH against the SPANNISH, the Spanish against the French,
The French against the Italians, The Italians against the French. The Spaniard
against the Portugal, the Portuall, against the SPANIARD. But almost all
Nations against ENGLAND, And the Dominions hereunto annexed, as evidently
appears by the great store of aid, shipping, men, money and all kind of
Warlike A nunition sent, and to be sent, against these united Kingdoms from
France, Spain, Polonia, Denmark. Dunkercke, and other Popish places of the
Low Countries, whereof some have been taken, others have unhappily escaped;
but far more are it in readiness and preparation to be sent.

And shall we permit such Vipers as these Jesuits, and they Jesuicticall
Abetors are to live among us until they have eaten up the bowels of the
Common Weal, and which is it much more the life, and substance of true
Religion by no by means: But let us stand and acquit our selves like men of
Wisdom, and courage, for the King and kingdom, but chefly for our GOD, and
that pure Religion which for many years we have now enjoyed.

Let our wisdom appear first by our Piety, in crying mightily to God by
seeking him by Fasting, Weeping and Mourning in truth and sineerity and all
other duties wherein we may manifest our true humiliation before him. And then
submitting our own particular understandings let us hearken unto and observe
diligently the grave observations and directions and resolutions of this
present Parliament, which cannot choose but see more and decide better than any
private man, yea or many men, be they never so wise, however men of no
understanding, or men of no religion, or Neuters in religion, or of a contrary
religion, either rashly or maliciously dare to affirm the contrary.

Let our courage appear in a stout and resolute opposition of all opposers of
our Religion, and laws established more especially against Jesuits, and their
abbettors who strive fiercely even to the effusion of much blood to disturb
and alter the Militia of the Kingdom, both by Sea and Land, under a fond
pretense of defending the King and kingdom religion and law, whereas in truth
they seek the utter subversion of them all. For how can it be reasonably
imagined, that papists should take up arms for the defense of the protestant
religion, utlaws for the preservation of the Law, or delinquents and fugitives
from parliament for privileges of parliament which is the representative body
of the kingdom And yet these are the men and but few other of any better
quality or condition who pretend to fight under the Kings Standard, against
King and kingdom: A very strong motive and unanswerable argument to incite all
of any understanding or resolution to stand firm to God and his truth for his
Majesty and royal posterity, for the peace and safety of the realm against
all foreign invasions and homebred conspiracies, which necessary prudence
and happy resolution if it shall please the Lord to give unto the land in
general, we need not much fear what either of them can do against us. Our
Militia by Sea so strongly and so completely set forth and so well assisted by
our no less grateful then provident friends the Netherlands may under God
sufficiently assure us against any great hurts from foreign forces, though
France and Spain, though Denmark and Poland a thing very unlikely) should at
once join their forces of shipping men money, horse, and other warlike
ammunition against us. And as for homebred conspiracies, now that the wisdom
of the parliament has so well contrived and disposed the order of the Militia
in all countries so well approved of all (some few only excepted as they
intend by Gods assistance to live and die in the defense of it. The Jesuits and
their abbettors are very likely ere long to their shame and confusion to find
their damnable plots to be fully discovered, their persons and estates to be
left to the severity of law as is most just and but necessary for the
preservation of this Kingdom.

FINIS.
