BEHOLD,
THe sum of all the blood, treasures. Victories, and losses after these
troubles, is to be bestowed on that most royal and precious Jewel, called, A
Personal Treaty; And its no marvel; for the virtue thereof is so rare and
singular, that it is as well an excellent salve to cure all sores, as a
sovereign remedy for all diseases, whether it be, The Kings Evil, or the
Parliaments Evil, or the House of Lords evil, the Cities, or the Armies, or
the Clergies, or the Cavaliers: so that only the peoples Evil* rests to be
cured, by the Scots glorious Reformation, according to their forced Covenant,
which comes to pass (they say) when neither Papists, nor Separatists, nor
Sectaties shall be any more mentioned.

All these mighty States being thus so easily cured, and the people of their
freedoms, Estates, and Livelihoods so pitifully cheated, it is like to follow
in the next place, that not only the King, (whom they have conquered and
imprisoned) being again to his Throne advanced, but all his race, will exercise
these 3. main points of Government, (without any more mention of a Parliament)
which may be thus distinguished.

The first is Vindicative; For by the scope of all his practices, as well
before as since this Parliament, (tending always to tyranny blood, and
oppression) he and all his papists and Cavaliers. Prince Rupert, Maurice,
Goring, and the rest, will endeavor to be sully revenged on all whom either he
or they know to be his or their enemies, beginning at the Scots who first
opposed him in his wicked practices, and next on the Parliament of England, and
their adherents, for following their example, and last on the Army, by dozens
and half dozens at Assizes and Sessions, if he cannot do it speedily by
another Army upon their refusing to disband, and not regarding to be proclaimed
(as they were once declared) Rebels and Traitors.

The second is Restaurative, because he and his Cavaliers will endeavor by
force of Arms in City, and Troops of horses in Country, not only to be
restored to their former greatness, but other his adherents (who were never
great) to be advanced on the peoples ruins.

And the third is Preservative, for he will make his little finger heavier then
all the Parliaments loins, by laying such heavy loads of taxations,
sequestrations, assesments, excises and other oppressions, that both nations
and this wealthy City, shall be made so poor and miserable, that they shall
never be able again to rise in Arms against him or his forces, but rather to
be weary of their lives, wive^ and families for want of subsistence.

Thus in brief, ye have here a Warning of the bitter fruits of a personal
treaty, though there were no woeful examples of France, Naples and other
places, by such personal treaties, with their Kings, to terrify you from
engaging in such desperate designs, left ye be guilty of all the bloods that
may (...)
