A TRUE COPY OF THE SENTENCE of War pronounced against Sir Francis Annesley
Knight, and Baron Mountnorris, in the Realm of Ireland, in the Castle Chamber
at Dublin in Ireland, the 12. of December 1635. TOGETHER WITH HIS LORDSHIPS
Petition against Thomas Earl of Strafford, exhibited into the honorable
assembly of the Commons house of Parliament the seventh of November, 1640.

LONDON, Printed for J.B. 1641.

THE HVMBLE PETITION OF SIR FRANCIS ANNESLEY Knight, and Baron Mountnorris, in
the Realm of Ireland. To the Honorable assembly, the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses, of the Commons house of Parliament.
HUmbly showing that whereas Your petitioner for diverse years past, has been
employed by his Majesty, and his late Royal Father in diverse offices, and
employments of great trust and eminence within the Realm of Ireland, wherein
to the utmost of his power, he has faithfully discharged the trust in him
reposed with the public approbation and satisfaction both of this, and that
State and Realm, in Testimony whereof, his Majesty was pleased to dignifie
your Petitioner with the style he now bears. Yet the Right Honorable Thomas
Earl of Straford, Lord Lieutenant, lately Lord Deputy of the said Realm of
Ireland, having conceived a causeless distaste against your Petitioner, and
thereupon indevouring the revenge of some supposed personal neglect, and the
undue advancement of his own ends and instruments by the dishonor and ruin
of your petitioner; his Lordship without any just cause at all not only stripped
and deprived your petitioner of those honorable employments with contumely,
and reproach, but also of his own private fortunes, and the birthright, and
liberty of a subject: a short view of part, of which your petitioners
sufferings he humbly presents in these ensuing particulars.

1. First, whereas his late Majesty, King James, by his highness Letters,
bearing date the first day of October in 14. year of his Majesty's Reign, did
appoint your petitioner to be one of the principal Secretaries, and of the
Council of State for that Realm, whereupon your Petitioner was sworn and
admitted accordingly; And whereas after, viz. the 8. day of June in the
sixteenth year of his said Majesty's reign, his said late Majesty by his
letters Patents under the great Seal of Ireland did grant unto your
petitioner, as well a pention of 200. l. Per annum for the exercise of the said
office, together with the Fees thereunto belonging, as also the office of
Custody of the privy Signet, with the incidents thereunto to be held by your
petitioner during his life immediately after the death, surrender, or forfeiture
of sir Dudley Norton, who held the same office and pention during his life, by
force of which premises, as your petitioner faithfully executed the said
office of Secretary, without fee during the life of the said Sir Dudley, who
was for many years infirm, and unable to execute the same; so he ought to
hold the said office and pention since his decease or surrender, according to
the effect of his Majesty's said Patent; yet upon pretense of a discoursesie
supposed to be done by your Petitioner to his Lordships brother, Sir George
Wentworth: his Lordship obtained a surrender to be made by the said sir Dudley
Norton, in or about the 12. day of July, in the tenth year of his now
Majesty's reign, and contrary to all right and justice procured the said
offices, and fees to be conferred upon sir Philip Manwaring, who
notwithstanding your petitioners often requests and petitions to his Lordship
for relief still holds the same under the protection of the power and
greatness of his Lordship.

Whereas his now Majesty by his Highness Letters patents, bearing date the
xxx. day of May, in the first year of his Highness reign, did appoint your
petitioner to be his Vice-treasurer, and general receiver of his revenues
within the said Realm of Ireland during his Majesty's pleasure, with the fees
and profits thereunto belonging, and appointed your Petitioner to be Treasurer
at wars in the said Kingdom by his Majesty's Letters of the 13. of June
1632. And whereas your Petitioner did refuse at his Lordships solicitation to
make a dishonorable sale of the said offices, the said Earl being therewith
enraged, and thereupon endeavoring to captivate not only your petitioners said
Offices, but also his honor and life, to his Lordships power and pleasure, his
Lordship in a time of public peace and serenity within that Realm, the 12.
day of December 1635. did call a Council of war, and did accuse your
petitioner of some words supposed to be spoken by your petitioner many months
before, tending in his Lordships strayned construstion to the disturbance of
government, and without allowing your Petitioner liberty of clearing his
innocence in a Legal manner, or so much as an hours time to make his just
defense, proceeded to sentence at the same time, and although the said supposed
words were no ways criminal, yet his Lordship contrary to all justice, did
cause the sentence of death to be pronounced against your Petitioner, being a
Peer of that Realm, as by the Copy of the said sentence hereunto annexed may
appear.

3. Though his Lordship for the further advancing of his own ends did partly
forbear the execution of the said sentence, yet by color thereof his Lordship
forthwith disposed of your petitioners Foot-company; and committed your
petitioner prisoner to the Castle of Dublin, where he was contained from the
said twelfth day of December 1635. until the sixteenth day of April 1637. And
within that time your petitioners papers, Cabinets, trunks, and other places of
his house, were strictly searched by some of his greatest adversaries, by his
Lordships direction; And your petitioner for the space of twenty days was kept
close prisoner to the extreme hazard of his life, until at last he was forced
to purchase his liberty by submission to the said unjust and illegal sentence,
and by the accepting of a pardon for the same.

4. His Lordship taking advantage of your Petitioners Condition, and
indevouring not only to justify his former proceedings, but also to convict
your petitioner, and render him a delinquent without a defense, did issue a
Commission to Commissioners of his own choice and nomination, who during your
petitioners imprisonment examined diverse witnesses touching some misdemeanors
falsely charged upon your petitioner in his office of Vice-treasurer? which
being returned, and the effect thereof transmitted into this Kingdom, his
Lordship by this, and other undue practices, brought your petitioner into
disgrace with his Majesty, and thereupon procured the said offices of
Vice-treasurer, General receiver and Treasurer at wars to be conferred upon
Sir Adam Loftus Knight, who had been formerly one of your petitioners accusers.

5. Whilst thus your petitioner had his offices taken from him, his honor and
integrity injuriously calumniated; his liberty restrained, his life not only
subject to the mercy of the said Earl, but extremely endangered by a
continual sickness caused by his imprisonment, his Lordship not therewith
content, caused an Information to be preferred against your petitioner in the
Castle chamber, touching the several supposed misdemeanors enquired of by the
said Commissioners, wherein though your petitioner was no ways conscious of
any guilt, yet finding his Council awed by his Lordships power, his Judges to
be such as were formerly his inquisitors, the witnesses pre-engaged by an
extrajudiciall examination, could expect no less then a sentence against him
notwithstanding his innocence; your petitioner was put to this miserable
choice, either to suffer continuance and addition of his miseries, or otherwise
to make such a submission as his Lordship pleased, whereupon your petitioner
was enforced in an ignominius manner to make submission, hoping thereby to
purchase his liberty, and go into England according to his Majesty's
directions, though by so doing he could not effect the same, but his
imprisonment was continued notwithstanding.

6. Whereas as well by the fundamental laws of that Realm, as also by his
Majesty's declaration published in print upon return of a Commission, and by
the advice of many grave and wise Commissioners sent from hence into Ireland
for examination of the grievances of his Majesty's Subjects in that Realm; the
Lord deputy and Council are not to meddle upon Titles of Inheritance between
party and party; or in business belonging to the Cognizance of other Courts;
or to alter possession: yet his Lordship upon a paper petition to him preferred
by Kichard Rolston against your petitioner touching the manor of Teemore in
in the said Realm, after 18. years quiet possession thereof by your
petitioner, has decreed the said lands to the said Rolston, and by his own
warrant removed your petitioner out of possession thereof.

7. Whereas also by the said laws of that Kingdom, and by the said
declaration, proceedings before the Lord Deputy and Council for things
remediable in other Courts, or by paper-petitions, and the abuses of Habeas
corpus within that Realm are prohibited, yet upon a paper Petition preferred
to his Lordship, and the Council by one Walter Peppard, touching land of
Inheritance in the Petitioners possession, his Lordship has retained the said
Cause for his hearing, notwithstanding your Petitioners legal exception
thereunto. And upon the like paper petition preferred to his Lordship by Arthur
Manwaring, his Lordship has for diverse years delayed, and frustrated the
benefit of an execution which your Petitioner had against him for a debt by
bond, and yet no end of the said Manwarings vexations suites before his
Lordship, and such other Referrences as his Lordship appoints.

8. His Lordship Rated your petitioner for the payment of his Majesty's
Subsidies in 1000. pounds in the Kings books, whereas men of far greater,
visible and known estates are not charged with hadfe that proportion, your
Petitioners estate being very mean to support the condition and quality of
the honors graciously conferred upon him by his Majesty, and his Royal
Father in acceptance of his faithful services, and his wife and eleven
children.

Now, forasmuch as your Petitioner is no ways guilty of the crimes under which
he has suffered, and yet it has been the height of his Lordships endeavor,
not only to bereave your Petitioner of his honor and fortunes, but also (as
much as in him lay) of his innocence by the said extorted submission, and
obtruded pardon, he here relinquisheth all advantage of defense by the said
pardon, and freely submits the Crimes to him imputed to the scruting and
determination of this honorable and impartial assembly: and forasmuch as the
said oppressions sustained by your Petitioner do not only in the highest
degree concern your Petitioner in his innocence, honor, liberty, and
fortunes, but alsotend to the public abuse, and scandal of the Laws,
liberties, and justice of both Realms, and to the introducing an Arbitrary
form of government, your Petitioner humbly offers the premises to the
consideration of this Honorable Assembly; And humbly prays such reparation
therein, as to this Honorable Assembly shall seem to stand with right and
justice,

And your Petitioner shall daily pray, etc.
BY THE LORD DEPVTY AND GENERAL OF THE ARMY, and Council of War.
WENTWORTH.

WHereas the Kings most excellent Majesty by his Highness Letters of the 31.
of July last directed to us the Lord Deputy, has been graciously pleased to
signify, that as he shall ever expect that all due Reverence shall be given
by his Subjects to the Person whom he appoints to be his Deputy, and General
of his Army, within this his kingdom of Ireland; so on the contrary he shall
hold them blameworthy, especially being persons who have received their
dignities from him, or hold their places of honor, and trust under his
Government, and yet shall forget their duty that way in their words or actions,
to the ill example of others; And taking notice of the carriage of the Lord
Mountnorris, his Majesty's Vice-treasurer, and Treasurer at wars here (who
holds a Captains place in his Majesty's Army) by uttering some speeches
inciting a Revenge upon us the Lord Deputy and General, from a Lieutenant of
this Army for performing the duties of our place, with modesty and good reason,
in the time of exercising our Troop, which his Majesty in his said Letters
declares to be an offense much unbeseeming the gravity of a privy Councellor,
to us the Lord Deputy; and the duty of a Captain to his General, and not to
be suffered in any well governed Army, where good discipline must be the Rule
and square of every man's actions: And therefore being very sensible of the
honor of us his Deputy, and General of his Army, which may suffer herein, and
be of ill consequence in the future. He has by his said Letters willed and
commanded us the Lord Deputy and General upon receipt of those his Letters, to
call a Council of war, and after a due examination and proof of those
speeches by the Lord Mount-norris, his Majesty's express will and pleasure is,
that he should undergo and be liable to such censure, as the said Council
should impose upon him, for the full reparation of us his Deputy and General,
in that point, and that there be no failing in putting the same in due and
speedy execution: In obedience to which his Majesty's Commandment, We the
Lord Deputy called a Council of war, who being this day assembled. We the
Lord Deputy in the presence of the said Lord Mount-norris did charge him with
this offense: That within three or four days, or thereabouts after the end of
the Parliament, it being mentioned at the Lord Chancellors table, that after
We the Lord Deputy had dissolved the Parliament, being sitting down in the
presence Chamber, one of our servants in moving a stool, happened to hurt our
foot, then indisposed through an accession of the Gout, That one then present
at the Lord Chancellors table, said to the Lord Mount-norris being there
likewise, That it was Annesley his Lordships kinsman, and one of our the Lord
Deputy and Generals Gentlemen Vshers that had done it: Whereupon the Lord
Mount-norris then publicly, and in a scornful contemptuous manner answered,
perhaps it was done in revenge of that public affront which my Lord Deputy had
done him formerly, but he has a Brother that would not take such a revenge,
which charge being so laid, the Lord Mount-norris was required by this Council
of war to make answer thereunto, who going about to answer it, and yet neither
confessing nor denying them; This Council after some time spent therein,
required him to answer the said charge, either negatively or affirmatively, yet
would not confess or deny them, whereupon the witnesses vouched for proof
thereof, were called, namely our very good Lord, the Lord Viscount M^ore, and
Sir Robert Loftus Knight, son and heir to our very good Lord, the Lord
Chancellor, persons who though they were not the original relators of his
Lordships said discourse to us the Lord Deputy, yet being present when the said
words were so spoken, were conceived to be able to give testimony therein: And
therefore were called to be interrogated withal thereupon, who being examined
before this Council upon oath ministered unto them by the Clarke of the
Council before us, by commandment of us the Lord Deputy, and their
dispositions then reduced to writing, and subscribed by them in our presence,
and in the presence also of the said Lord Mount-norris, who heard them affirm
the same, It thereby appears, that the said Lord Mount-norris uttered and
spoke the said words in manner and former, and at the time and place aforesaid:
The charge laid against him standing then fully proved: The said Lord
Mount-norris at last submitted himself to the judgment of this Council,
protesting that what interpretation soever his words might have put upon them,
he intended no prejudice or hurt to the person of us the Deputy, and General,
affirming that by these words; but he has a Brother that would not take such
is revenge, his Lordship meant only, that the said Brother would dye before
he would give us the Deputy and General, occasion to give him such a Rebuke.
We fell in the next place to consider as of the nature of the offense* so of
the punishment due thereunto: And first for this nature of the offense, we
conceive it to contain, first a calumny against the person of us the Deputy
and General of the Army, insinuating by these words, the pub-like affront, or
the disgrace, which my Lord Deputy had done him formerly, that indeed there had
been such an affront or disgrace put upon him by us the Lord Deputy, whereas
in truth it was nothing so, but that which was pretended by the Lord
Mount-norris, to have been the said disgrace, or affront to his kinsman was
this: That his said kinsman (being one of the horse troop commanded by us the
Lord Deputy) in the time of exercising the said troop was out of order on
horseback, to the disturbance of the rest then in exercising, for which we
the Lord Deputy in a mild manner reproving him, as soon as we turned aside
from him, we observed him to laugh and geere us, for our just reproof of him,
which we disliking returned to him, and laying a small Cane (which we then
carried) on his shoulders (yet without any blow or stroke then given him
therewith) told him that if he did serve us so any more, we would lay him over
the pate: the truth of which fact appeared unto us by the relation of His
Majesty's said Deputy, and our General, avowed and confirmed by two of us the
Captains; namely the Lord Kirkudbright, and Sir Frederick Hamilton Knight, who
then saw the manner of it, and now sat as members of this Council; which said
Act was by this whole Council adjudged to have been a far milder proceeding
with the said Annesley, then such an Insolence, and disobedience to any
Commander, much more to his General merited, and therefore it was a speech
savoring doubtless of malice, to insinuate that as an affront or disgrace,
which was indeed a justly merited, but mild and modest reprehension, and
admonition, Secondly, we conceive the offense to contain an incitement to a
revenge in these words, but be has a brother that would not take such a
revenge, Which incitement might have given encouragement to that Brother, being
then and now in this Kingdom, and Lieutenant of the said Lord Mount-norris,
his foot Company, to the said Annesley, himself being continually so near the
person of us the Deputy and General, or to some other to have taken up
resolutions of dangerous consequences, and the manner of speaking the words,
do so far aggravate them, as there is no place left for any indulgent
construction to be made of them, nor indeed any construction but such, as
renders the speaker a delinquent in a high and transcendent manner against the
person of his General, and his Majesty's authority; whence we derive our
power. This Council also took it into consideration, that if the like words
had been spoken of the sacred person of our dread Sovereign Lord the King,
they had amounted to little less then high treason, which by some rule of
relation apply themselves even to his Majesty, being directed to the person of
his Deputy, and the revenge thus insolently vaunted to have been taken upon
him, being done when we the Deputy and General had that great and high Honor
(which we always esteem our self in our self far unworthy of) as to be
apparelled, and robed with his Majesty's own Robe of Majesty and Sovereignty.
We consideted likewise the time when these words were spoken, when part of the
Army was in motion, and when there were diverse Companies of foot, and troops of
horse in town, and daily in exercising and training, whereat for the most part
we the Deputy were present, and the town full of people from all parts of the
Kingdom, as then unreturned back to their own dwellings, from their sitting
in Parliament. In the next place for the punishment due to his offense, we
judge it to be an apparent breach and contempt of the one and fortieth Article
of the printed laws and orders of war, established for the good conduct of
the service of Ireland, dated the thirteenth of March 1633. and published in
print by us the Lord Deputy soon after our access to this Government in
these words of the said Articles; No man shall give any disgraceful words or
commit any Act to the disgrace of any person in his Army or Garrison, or any
part thereof upon pain of imprisonment public disarming and banishment from
the Army as men for ever dis-abled to carry Arms. And which is more in like
breach and contempt of the thirteenth Article of the said printed Laws and
orders of war, the words of which Article are these; No man shall offer any
violence, or contemptuously disobey his Commander, or do any Act or speak any
words which are like to breed any mutiny in the Army or Garrison, or impeach
the obeying of the general, or principal Officers directions, upon pain of
death; which Articles are no other then the very same Articles this Army had
always been governed by in the time of the late Lord Faulkland, Lord Wilmot,
and other the Generals before them; And therefore this Council of War in
conformity to his Majesty's gracious pleasure signisied as aforesaid, and us
well to vindicate the honor of Us his Majesty's Deputy and General of his
Army, from the wrong and contempt under which we now suffer, to the scandal
of this Government, and to the ill example of others, as also to deliver over
to all which bear Office, or are lifted as members of the Army, under the rule
and government of us his General an example of Justice, for them to take
warning by, how they presume to offend against the authority entrusted with us
by his Majesty, do hereby adjudge, order and decree, that the said Lord
Mount-norris stands justly and deservedly liable to undergo, the censures,
pains, and punishments by the said forty one, and thirteenth Articles
provided against the breakers of all good Discipline, and the transgressors
against those orders, which are by the said forrie one Article Imprisonment,
public disarming, and banishment from the Army, as a man for ever disabled to
carry Arms, and by the said thirteenth Article death; And therefore according
to the said Articles this Council do unanimously, with one joint consent (not
one of us being of other opinion) adjudge the said Lord Mount-norris for his
said high and great offenses, to be imprisoned, to stand from henceforth
deprived of all the places, with the Intertainments due thereunto, which he
holds now in the Army, to be disarmed, to be banished the Army, and dis-inabled
for ever bearing office therein hereafter; And lastly, to be shot to death, or
to lose his head at the pleasure of the General.

Given at his Majesty's Castle of Dublin the twelfth day of December 1635.
