A brief Answer to a scandalous Pamphlet, entitled, A Speech made at a Common
Hall by Alderman Garroway.
THere came to my hands some few days since, a Pamphlet, entitled A Speech
made by Alderman Garroway at a Common Hall in London: and revolving with my
self the strangeness and subtlety of the speech, I could not but admire the
crafty wit of the Author, and yet wonder more at his impudence, that he durst
put so strong an imputation upon so worthy a Gentleman as Alderman Garroway
has ever been accounted, so much a lovery of the tranquillity of the
Country, and the welfare of the City: and seeing no man in all this time
undertook to answer the speech, out of a reverence to the man, whom my
conscience tells me that Calumniator has most egregiously abused, and to
disabuse the people, who by such a noted speech from a man so well beloved of
the Citizens, I thought it not unfit for me, though a person of little note in
the world, to enter the lists against him, that has so cunningly treated the
present state of the Kingdom. And as the cunningest and most venomous serpent
lurks in the smoothest and greenest grass, so shall we find that fellow,
whosoever he was, that made the speech, strived to shadow and palliate his
malice, with beginning his oration with the present miseries of the
Commonwealth which he seems extremely to pity, telling his readers (for I
believe he never had audience) how apparent were the miseries of the Kingdom,
how hideous the present distractions, such as no age in this Country could
ever parallel, no history examplifie; whereby having prepared them by that
proeme, to believe hi^ a true lover of his Country, he thought it the aptest
way, to make them and it the rest. And so having amplified the distractions
attendent in the State at this present, he descends to particularize the
occasions and causes and efficient of them, which he finds (as he says) to
proceed from jealousies and fears, not in his Majesty, but rather implies
them in his High Court of Parliament, which how far that is adverse to all
truth and likelihood, I shall in brief instance.

For that the Parliament should be the authors of his Majesty's distractions,
jealousies, or fears, is both untrue and improbable. The Parliament, we all
know, is the supreme Council of the Kingdom, a body congregated out of the
wifest and ablest heads thereof, for the rectifying the disorders in the
Commonwealth, and the cure of its distempers: and that these men should strive
to atchieve those ends, and to reduce the state into order, by causing his
Majesty's jealousies and fears, cannot stand with any probability to any
well-affected judicious man. For certain, the Parliament to full of wisdom,
and so endued with goodness, temperance, and obedience to his Sacred Majesty,
could never be so injurious to themselves, and to the people that had entrusted
them with the Kingdoms business, as to strive either by direct or indirect
means, to separate his Majesty, who is the head of that great Council from
the body thereof, themselves. No, it was the very machinations and devices of
such malignants as this man seems to be that did it, it was their cunning to
save themselves from punishment, being diverse of them notorious Delinquents, to
instill into his Majesty's good and gentle mind, those vain suspicion of his
Parliaments integrity toward him, that they should seek to obtrude new
dimunitions upon his royalty, and abridgements upon hsi Royal Prerogative,
which how far it was and has been from the general thought and soul o^ the
Parliament, may easily be proved by the specialty of their actions, which may
thus briefly be cited in their frequent propositions to his Majesty, that if
he would graciously hearken to their advices, they would make him f^r more
beloved at home, and dreaded abroad, than any of his Royal Predecessors, they
would settle him a revenue, and do indeed what his Majesty pleased; so entire
were the expressions, and certainly the same were the intentions of their
loyalty, which every honest man is bound to believe, before the attestations
and vain surmises of this; and a thousand such idle companions: for were there
ever more wholesome Laws enacted, than by this present Parliament, more
beneficial to his Majesty, or more excellent for the people? As first, the
putting down the High Commission Court, and that of the Star Chamber, which
were so destructive to the persons and estates of the subject, the settling the
Trienniall Parliament, beyond which, neither to his Majesty nor to the
Commonwealth, could have accrued a greater and more perspicious happiness.

And had his sacred Majesty gone on the same blessed path of corresponce of
this day that He walked in at the beginning with this present Parliament, these
distractions which this man laments so in his Speech had never oppressed the
Commonwealth, nor he had occasion to have foysted this Oration on Alderman
Garroway: the plundrings, rapines and bloodshes which he voices out in such a
pinfull manner, had never distained the beauty of the land with ruin, nor had
these distractions in the Church which he maliciously imputes upon several
persons of worth and eminence in the State and City ever been emergent in the
Kingdom, the Schisms of Brownisme, Anabaptisme, and the like had never been
so busy nor the preaching in tubs, which he so much exclai^^^ against, either
countenanced or tolerated; which in truth never was, though he seems
absolutely to imply to much, when he cries out, there was a tim^, good people,
when the Book of Common Prayer was in such reverence, that none durst (...) its
purity, these are the Gentleman's words; there was a time also, as I may boldly
tell them, when the Idol of the Mass was in such request, that it was a
capital crime for any man to mutter the least syllable against it, but that
was a time of ignorance and superstition, which by the pure light and glorious
Sunshine of the Gospel being expelled, the date of that time was expired, and
then every one had liberty to speak what they pleased. I make not this a
parallel with the Common^ on Prayer or Liturgy now in use in the Church of
England, yet let me inform him thus much; if he has ever read or heard the
Cannon of Mass read, and understood the Latin tongne, that the Book of
Common Prayer is put a graft orsien of the old stock, the Mass; every Prayer
in it being translated out of the Mass, for that we may justly say, though all
that is in the Masse-booke be not in the Common Prayer Book, yet all that is
in the Common Prayer Book is in the Masse-book; so that if diverse men of godly
and unsuperstitious minds do not affect the Book of Common Prayer, as it now
is, but wished a reformation in it, because of its affinity with the Mass,
they were no more to be blamed then those of our Ancestors, who sought a
reformation in the Mass and Popish Religion, because of its gross errors and
Idolatrous Ceremonies: and whereas he says, That the present Lord Mayor, who
has been too just a Patriot to the City, unless he had received more thanks
for his pains, is a favourer and promoter of Schisms, because he never has
the Book of Common Prayer read; what an ill consequence does he refer out
of that Antecedent, is plain and evident to any one that understands Logic:
for admit my Lord Mayor never hears the Book of Common Prayer, because he is
satisfied in his conscience that there are diverse things in it which are
erroneous, how does that conclude him a promoter of Schism; as well he may
conclude those Schismatics and averse to the doctrine of the Church of England
that do not desire to hear the Letany read, in which is surely relics of the
Mass, past dispute or question; or that Canticle of the three children, which
bid Shidrack, M^sach and Abednego praise the Lord who have been dead thousands
of years, and yet God says in the Psalms, the dead praise him not; and for
the imputation he casts upon Colonel Ver, that he should report, his wife
could make better Prayers then the Common Prayer Book, though I believe the
Gentleman did not say so, yet if he had, what harm was there in that saying,
when all the world knows, that they who serve the Lord in Spirit and Faith,
their Prayers are of as much value, though ex tempere and rudely penned, then
those that are set down by Scholars in fine and quaint language, God only
respecting the integrity of the heart; but he only did this, and urged other
more calumnies upon them, to incense the people against them, they being at
that time called into question by his Majesty for facts, which certainly they
may both justify to God and their own consciences, having done nothing in the
City of London, or in any other place which was not ordered them to perform by
the decree of the Parliament; and so much shall suffice to be said in answer to
that Pamphlet.

Now, according to our promise, we shall say a word or two of another of the
same brood, though of a more acute and dangerous style, namely, A Letter, to be
written to one in Milkestreet, but who that one was, to whom it was written, or
who was the writer, passes my Augury to determine; yet by the pedantique
phrase, it should appear to be sent from some Student in the University,
endowed, perhaps, with more learning then wisdom, and more faction then
honesty, otherwise he could not with such an audacious and fearelesse license
have taxed the proceedings of the State; but such calumnies, like arrows shot
upright, fall upon the owners heads, and wound themselves: Slanders, like Snow,
though it may for a small space, and in frosty weather, lie upon the ground,
yet the Sun no sooner shines, but it dissolves into its native substance,
water, and is dispersed away and forgotten: it is so with these ignominious
slanders a while they may be believed and gain credit with the people; the
Sun of truth once displaying his lightsome beams, they melt away like tales
ill told, leave behind them no remembrance, but vanish into mists with the
authors, who never would have written such notorious untruths as are in these
two Pamphlets, had they not had a mind like Herostratus that fiered Diana's
Temple to do something to be talked of when they are hanged, and acquire fame
for mischief; for I dare boldly aver, that books of this nature have done
more mischief since the beginning of these distractions and troubles in this
Kingdom, then any one thing whatsoever, the people being more disturbed in
their minds, and staggered in their understandings by such seditious untruths,
then they could by any other public endeavor, man's nature being desirous of
novelties, and apt to credit them, when they come dressed like devells in
Angels shapes, in the painted outside of fair and specious language, and this
shall suffice for the present as an Answer to those two scandalous Pamphlets.

FINIS.
