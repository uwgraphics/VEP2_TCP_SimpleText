An ANSWER To the LETTER Directed to the Author OF JUS POPULI, By a Friend of
the Authors.

Printed in the Year 1671

An Answer to the letter directed to the Author of JUS POPULI, By a Friend of
the Authors.
SIR,
At the first view of your Letter to my friend I begun to apprehend you had
transformed your self into an Apostle of Christ, borrowed a mantle of light,
and perceiving you so cunning as from a plausible misapplication of the gospel
precepts of charity, meekness, patience, and the like graces to study your
advantages against a just and zealous indignation occasioned by provocations
which might almost excuse the greatest excess, the least I could expect was a
non-contradicting practice; but how quickly am I releived of these
apprehensions? And how much more happily have you your self detected that
which, though by me evinced by clearest arguments, yet could not have been so
much as named without your complaint of reviling and persecution; if your
insinuation of a brotherly respect, and fair professions of Christian charity
freedom from wrath, malice, and bitterness, pity, compassion, a deep and
affecting concernment for Gods glory and religious advancement, high
pretendings for humility, meekness, and true holiness, a tender reguard to
the union of Christ's body, and daily panting for an escape from the
contentions and confusions here below, unto these regions of peace and joy
above, even unto the undervaluing of Episcopacy as well as Presbytery had been
followed with an uniforme strain in all other parts, they might have proven
very pernicious deceivings; but seeing that, beside the slay and scorneful
mixtures which obviously bewray themselves through the whole tenor of your
Letter, you are often transported to the very rudest and foulest eruptions,
accusing your opposite as a scurrilous bouffon, bloody incendiary, agent of
heel, equal to Beelzebub, guilty of the crime of Cham, and in hazard of Canaans
curse; unjust, malicious and cruel in reproaches, nay in the gall of
bitterness, and finally whom in the first page you accoasted as your brother,
representing him in the last as guilty of rebellion and treason, worthy to be
made an example to all such desperate incendiaries, sure I am that he, who
cannot in these variant methods discern your hypocrisy, must yet acknowledge a
strength of malice above its subtilty. However Sir in return to the acceptable
deliverance you have given me from meddling further in such naughty stuff, all
the use I make of this observation shall be to let you see that you are but a
man of like passions with us, and that though the insolence of the Surveyer did
in effect constrain my friend to some heat and sharpness, yet we do also
know in its exigence how to cut off occasion from them which desire it, and to
redargue your vain glorying in the mylder and calmer graces (so to speak) by
a more consistent imitation, in which resolution I address my self to a short
review of your Letter.

And first taking God to witness of these groans and tears which our furious
distempers do draw from some of you, whom we so much persecute, you fall into
your heavy regrates to see the great designs of Godliness and piety suffering
so much from some who pretend so highly, and yet are more concerned for a few
inconsiderable opinions and niceties then for charity, meekness, unity, and
obedience to Authority, or for carrying on the great end for which Christ died
etc. Sir, though I may not directly call in question your truth and sincerity
in this appeal, yet seeing that all men know how that you or at least most of
that party whereunto you associat did with hands lifted up to the most high God
engage sincerely, really, and constantly to own and mantaine these things which
you do here plainly disowne and blaspheme, give me leave to remember you that
though deceivers may deceive themselves as well as others, yet God will not be
mocked. If these furious and unchristian distempers, the object of your groans
and tears, and the persecutions that you mention be indeed nothing else then
the zealous dissent and testimony of such who, in the fear of the same high
and holy Lord God whom you attest, dare not comply with the present manifest
bakslidings, and for which they have been greivously vexed, and if this your
Character of their way as fury be only either from delusion of interest or
delicacy of humor, it is much to be feared that he who is the true and faithful
witness shall one day witness against you and not for you; one thing I am
persuaded of, that whoever at present is a true mourner before the Lord and as
in his sight, does not more find the reigning sins of the Land and the
desolations and profanations of Gods sanctuary to be his principal motive, then
the causes which you assign to be false and deceitful. The great designs of
godliness do certainly suffer much, And O that God would as manifestly declare
the authors of these sufferring, as all men know their beginnings. That we are
the men you point at by this overconcernement for a few inconsiderable and
disputable opinions is aboudantly obvious, but seeing you are not ashamed to
term these things in considerable and disputable, which yet do as certainly,
both by their institution, and in our experience, conduce to the great ends of
holiness and happiness, as from Scripture and clear reason they were
evidently determined, and by most righteous and solemn laws and cannons and
sacred oaths established amongst us, it were unreasonable for me to redargue
your imputation, as for your prejudicial comparing of Ordinances with Duties,
and your endeavors, by magnifying the ends of religion, to vilify its midses
as mere nicities, it is a piece of art so frequently practiced by G. B. in his
dialogues, and by his antagonist so soberly and convincingly discovered, that I
need to add nothing, only let me tell you that he who truly values the death
and resurrection of our Lord Jesus, as he will assuredly dearly esteem all
his purchase for, and gifts unto his Church, so in these bacslidings,
oppositions, and overturnings which we have seen, he cannot but judge your
comliant charity, unseasonable meekness, easeful peace, censpiring unity, and
excessive obedience to man's authority, to be at best the delusions of a
lukewarm indifferent; you say There is a generation who was once by appearance
seriously minding their souls, but now are taken off that noble exercise; thus
you discern the change but cannot discern its causes, nay of these you are so
willingly ignorant that while you refer them to foolish and unlearned
questions, you altogether dislemble who were the first movers; this poor Church
was enjoying (although with some infirmity) our Lords pure ministry and
Government, and then These excellent lessons of charity, patience, humility,
meekness, and true holiness, though not in your perverse application, were in
some request, when, behold, as if we had been delivered from our civil bondage
to commit all these abominations, a furious tempest of perjury, violence, and
apostasy broke in upon us, not only to the subversion of the Lords work, but
to the laying waste of all religion and conscience, what mad and untractable
questions, and unreasonable and violent disputings a faithful remnant have
since been exercised with the Lord knows, this one thing I am assured of that
whatever advantage you may take of failings, whereunto you force them, and
however you may vaunt yourself in empty professions, yet, by their constant
steadfastness in midst of so many trials, they have witnessed a measure of true
Charity, patience, humility, meekness, and holiness that shall be remembered
for a testimony for God and his truth to all generations; passing therefore
your groundless and childish reflection of our speaking against Bishops, as if
what you observe most we were best pleased with, and your more absurd and
ridiculous retortion as if we had ruined religion, betrayed Christ, and sold
him for the gratifying forsooth of our humors and passions (a strange price)
when as the real money that your Bishops received for him is to be found in
their coffers, the blood of his saints in their skirts, and under the color of
a name the very scandal and scorn of all religion in their lives; Omitting
also that most censorious calumny of our censuring, traducing, railing,
forging, and publishing of lies which you cast upon us without the least
verification, and contrary to the evidence of that profanity, falsehood, and
perjury on your part that i^ sufficient to justify the highest accusation, I
wish you could yet consider and lay to heart that it is not by the
noncompliance and testifying of our Lords faithful members against corrupt
bakstiders that the ligaments of his body are dissolved, but by the breaking of
his bonds assunder, and casting away of his coards from you, that your party
have rebelled against the Lord our Head and King, and labored for the very
destruction of piety and true religion among us. If with these things you were
rightly and deeply affected your soul would rather abhor the wicked, who have
marred and removed our true peace, then testify an aversion for such who, at
their own cost, dare not join in your sinful confederacy, and in place of
precipitating an escape from the contentions and confusions here below by your
aerie aspirings to these regions of peace and joy above you would prefer for
a time that warfare of faith and patience, against the wickedness, stander,
and persecutions of this evil generation whereunto the Lord has called us. Sir
this is the path that these have trod who out of great tribulation are
arrived, and do stand before the throne in white with their palms of victory,
singing a new song. Your excessive charity toward anungodly world, and fond
and sinful courting of peace on any terms will but in end deceive you, the
narrow way of life admits not of your latitude, and heaven knows not your
comprehension.

In the next place you are for Jeremiah's wilderness, and upon the wings of
the same fancy you flee also to David's retirement, why? would you so soon
leave these assemblies of treacherous men which you did freely choice? or does
the not ceding of a small afflicted party to all your imposings seem to you so
terrible a storm and tempest? Nay certainly, were there no other argument, the
obvious easiness of the execution with your contrair forbearance is eneug he
to redargue these your wishes either of a wretched peevishness, or a worse
dissimulation.

You forbid my friend to think that all this is the effect of your zeal for
Episcopacy, And I dare affirm that without your suggestion it had never come
into his thought, the giddie instabilitie of the now-Bishop of Dumblaines weak
Fantastic brain, dissatisfied with both prelacy and Presbytery, whom neither
the small cure of Newbottle, nor the more abstract retreat of the college of
Edenburrough, nor his own choice the Bishopric of Dumblaine could formerly
six, and the present accession of Glasgow does as little please, and yet in
discourse always longing either for the shaddes of the grave or the rest
above, is not so rare a thing but you may be tainted by the same or the like
malady.

But the cause of your weariness is your solicitude for the great Bishop of
souls, whom my friend you say is doing what in him lies to depose from his
Government and Kingdom, which you add is neither in meats nor drinks, neither
in Episcopacy nor Presbytery, but in righteousness and peace and joy in the
holy Ghost: what a bold accusation have we here? The zeal of Christ's government
and Kingdom is that which in a manner eats up my friend, he asserts not only
its internal and spiritual power, but also its external and visible
administration, consisting in these laws and ordinances which our Lord by
virtue of that All-power given unto him has expressly appointed, and the
whole scope of his writing is in defense of righteousness, and to establish
the peace and joy of all its followers, and yet you are confident to say
without any reason, that he is doeg what in him lies to depose him. It Is true
the Kingdom of God is neither in meats nor drinks, and thereby all the trash
of your unwarranted ceremonies is evidently rejected, but if under this you
judge the usurpation of Episcopacy and ordinance of Presbytery to be equally
comprised, I really fear that in the temptation the same errror may substitute
to you the Mess and the Lords supper, or the Alcoran and the Bible with the
same persuasion.

The next thing that occurres is your opinion of Episcopacie, and I am assured
that as to this whole paragraph you may already find your self so exactly and
fully answered in a little treatise anent the late accommodation, that
according to your own verdict all that read it will account you deceived if
you let it pass without a reply.

As to what ensues, viz, your resolution to forebeare both rallerie and
injury, and yet immediately objecting dull buffonrie, your mien and il phrased
boast of causing flashes of a left handed wit rebound, your purpose of
seriousness which yet you only term a serious mood and is not indeed more
permanent, your promise not to raill, observed just as well as you have done
other promises and vows far more important, and the prejudice which you
endeavor to insinuat from the alleged general dislike even of good Ministers
of our own persuasion against my friends book; As to these things I say I
shall content my self with the naked observation, only as to this last I may
affirm it upon good ground that, what ever dislike some good men's over-kinde
charity or civilitie toward you, or the temper of their particular
dispositions may make them express of this book in certain circumstantial
points, yet the substance of the work both for acuteness and soliditie has
the very consentent approbation of all of our way, and is also acknowledged for
such by many of yours, nay further I am persuaded that as none of your
champions have as yet ventured upon its resutation, so while reason and right
remain among men it shall always be esteemed a Master piece for just liberty
and against tyranny.

1. But now you begin your ontset, and for the first attacque you object
against its rallerie and reviling, the first as scurrilous, foolish, light,
course, dull, flat, a puddel and kennel of putrid matter, and the latter as
bitter and unexamplified railing against the laws of nature, civilitie, and
Scripture, foolish and Inpious insulting, unjust, cruel, and what not;
intermixing with both all the little arts of flyteing, such as a seeming
tenderness to condescend on particulars, indirect insinuations rather then
plain censures, a high and serious charge as before the great God, and then
shutting up all as if you had said nothing, with a Lord rebuke thee? And all
this we must believe to be said without railing in sober sadness, and in a
humble submission to the Lords indignation, but as there can be no reason
rendered to persuade this last part, unless it be that the words are yours,
and delivered by you in one of your serious modes, so I am certain that he who
examines these your reflections, together with the other passages that I
observed in the entry by the rules which ye adduce against my friend will
find you by these alone equally reproved.

And really since you must acknowledge that an apparent necessity of a
retaliation has therein transported you far beyond your ordinary strain, I
almost wonder how you could go through with such a long winded invective,
haling and houting my friend both before God and men, without the least
remembrance of the provocations he had received, but it is aboundently manifest
that however you have treated him with much severitie, yet you have used his
antagonist the Surveyer with a slighting silence and contempt nothing
inferior; waving therefore these idle and endless strivings, all that I
return to these your objections of rallerie and railing is first that your
offering to dashe his whole book and every page of it with scurrile rallerie
is an untruth so manifestly injurious, that I am persuaded, were it not to
serve a visible design of slighting arguments which you cannot answer, all
your confidence durst not have averred it: I grant his animadversions upon the
surveyers preface with the postscript of the book are by a just indignation
proportioned to their subjects, but as it is only from some little seeming
advantages which you thence endeavor to wreste that you have assumed the
courage to appear against my friend in print, so I must conclude that your
attempt by such a groundless slander to discredit these sound rational and
closse reasonings wherewith the Author does in other parts prove his assertions
above your faculty of replying, is but a disingenuous artifice.

Next as for your charge of railing and reviling it is such an ordinary topic
with all such as cannot bear the freedom of truth that it very little amuseth
me, only let me remember you that seeing malice and not the matter is the sting
of reviling, unless you had evinced this to be an ingredient in my friends
representations your clamours are but an empty sound: to call perjurie,
violence, irreligion and wickedness by their own names and in due season to
testify both against these abominations and their Authors and actors with that
burning zeal and cordial resentment that all men owe to the glory of God and
honor of his holy name is so far from contradicting any gospel precept, that
it is an indispensible duty, and often proves an effectual mean for the
reclaiming even of these who seem at first to be the objects of its
vehemency; whither my friend was indeed acted by the power and influence of
this motive I am not careful to inquire, the thing it self does so evidently
declare it, yet if I might be heard to name evil things without the censure of
evil speaking, and if there be any place for gentleness, meekness, and love,
in testifying against such perverse transgressors, I find it in my heart to
say as in the sight and fear of the great God, and in a very serious and
humble frame, with no other design then that of Gods glory and my countries
good, that such has been the heinous and notorious apostasy of our days,
carried on by a perjurie so gross and black, and a violence so irrational,
and since attended with such an utter abnegation of conscience, insolent scorn
of religion, and unexampled increase of all wickedness, that it may not only
justify upon the matter all that my friend has said either against the course
or its abettors, but upon impartial reflection must of necessity move every
serious Christian to horror, and every sober man to astonishment. And
therefore,

Jn the third place, though you go about to stage him before the world for a
despiser of dominions and a speaker evil of dignities, yet lest the hearts of
evil doers be more obdured, and their hands strengthened by your flatteries,
and since I know you will no daigne to read Naphthalies plain and unanswerable
narrative, give me leave but to touch a few particulars of our backslidings and
grievances in his vindication.

And first I shall only name that one act amongst many, the act rescissorie,
whereby at one blow a parliament, notwithstanding their oaths and engagements
to God, and their trust for desence of rights and liberties from the people,
do not only overturne the work of God, but remove the very foundations of all
security amongst men. 2. Breach of Covenant whereby I am assured we have seen
an oath, taken with the most unanimous and hearty consent of the people, and
the most profound reverence and observeable presence of God, and confirmed by
all the authority both of Church and State, King and Parliament, violat by the
same generation in the height of pride, scorn, and irreligion. 3. The
persecutions both of Mimsters and people that have insued, what by death,
banishment, imprisonment, fining, consining and the like rigours for no other
reason at the bottom then because the sufferers could not break the same
Covenant wherein both they and their adversaries stood equally engaged. And 4.
The universal profanitie and wickedness that these strange bakeslidings have
either directly introduced or thereto visibly tempted and encouraged.

Sir. I do not desire you to take these things upon my trust, no, this were
not more unreasonalbe then unnecessary, but if you could lay aside your
affected abstractions, and pretended elevations I doubt not but a very stender
examination would render you so convinced of all that I have here assirmed,
that in place of judging my friend his lifting up his voice to show the people
their transgressions, exciting of both King and people to repent and execut
judgment and righteousness, the language of an incendiarie, or his denouncing
of woes against a rebellious house and hypocritical generation the office of an
agent of hell; you should by hearkening, and fearing bear witness to his
fidelity.

I have not in the foregoing discourse taken notice of these slanders of
dislovaltie and ingratitude wherewith you think to make us odious, this is a
theme so trite and tossed on both hands, that though in this matter, I might
with an hundredfold more evidence demonstrat your flattery then you can
exprobat to us the least misdemaner, yet in real duty to his Majesty I
choice rather to wave it. Neither as to your Bishops and clergy, a company of
men of whom all men except themselves, are now wearied and ashamed, am I more
inclined to meddle. Only Sir, if the unpassion at and disinteressed composure
of my heart, either as to their persons or petty fortunes, with all the
professions wherewith your self do labor to persuade your sincerity may
obtain from you the belief that you expect of us viz, that I design not your
infamy but your resormation, I would say that if to despise the holiness of
God and trample underfoot his truth be to blaspheme him, if to acknowledge
another supreme and all-determining Governor in the Church then Christ the
Lord be to renounce him, if to smite his Ministers and scatter his flocks be to
destroy his Church, if to practice, indulge, or connive at all wickedness and
repute Conscience the only eyesore be to overthrow religion, if to put to
death banish and spoil faithful men be to persecut the saints, your Bishops and
clergy, notwithstanding of your few insinuat and seeming exceptions, will ever
to all discerning inquirers be found even by your own Characters the just
object of all men's indignation; how then they will bear the Lords or what they
may look for in the end I pray God that both you and they may in time consider.

Your next attempt upon my friend concerns the matter of his book, and you say
the whole design of it is to provoke to rebellion, a high charge indeed, but
as suddenly deserted, for you are not for raveling into this entangled matter
which you conceive to be without both your own and my friends sphere, how Sir;
are alleagance and rebellion (The common concerns of the meanest, and the great
flattering and boasting themes of your preachers discourses) so great
mysteries? Or is this only a declining shift like to that basle which you
design by saying that my friends book is but Lex Rex put into another method,
an allegation not more contrary to its manifest tenor then reflecting upon the
surveyer whom you would have with so much heat and confidence to have vented
things before confuted with very little notice taken of the answers? But the
things you cannot explicat Alexander like you can cut off by two positions the
first that by immemorial possession and a long tract both of law and practice
the King of Scotland is an absolute Sovereign, accountable only to God and
not to be controuled by the force of his subjects, but more especially that the
subjects of Scotland are bound to obey all laws enacted in Parliament, or at
least to submit to the enacted mulcts and punishments, How plentifully have
thou declared the thing as it as? Both first and second, viz. that the Kings of
Scotland are Absolut, and that at least in King and Parliament there is such an
absolut power as may in no case be controuled or resisted, are indeed the
contradictions of the greatest part of my friends book, but are contradictions
alone sufficient refutations? or shall your bare assertions be received against
the most undeniable evidence. The certain and clear constitution of this
Kingdom consisting of King and Parliament, the express establishment by
uncontroverted Law, I. 6. P. 7. C. 130. of the honor and authority of
Parliament upon the free votes of the three Estat's thereof, the known
restrictions of the Kings sovereign power who by himself alone can neither
make laws, impose taxes, nor so much as put away one foot of his annexed
patrimony; and lastly the frequent approven and authorized resistances and
oppositions made against maleversing Princes, especially that made by the
Nobles against King James the third fully approven by the 14. Act 1. P. Ja. 4.
extant in the old editions in the black letter as they call it, but
industriously left out in that of Scheens (the tittle of the act is The
proposition of the debait of the field of Striviling. The words after the
preface are. That the haill body of the Parliament and ilk an for himself
declarit and concludit that the slaughter committit and done in the seild of
Striviling quhair our soverane Lordis father happinnit tp be slain, and uthers
diverse his Barronis and liegis was allutterly in their default and colourit
dissait done be him and his perverst counsall diverse times besoir the said
field. And that our soverane Lord that now is and the true Lords and barronis
that was with him in the same field war innocent free and quyte of the said
slaughters done in the said field and all persuit of the occasion and cause of
the samin. These are the words, and the act is declared to be sealed by the
Kings great seal and the seals of part of the three estates) these I say as to
your first position are such manifest redargutions, that before equal judges I
could undertake, upon the hazard of my life, for the asserting of this one
point, to obtain you convict of high treason as a leesing-maker betwixt the
King and his subjects, and an impugner of the authority of the three Estates:
but retracting a little as to this head concerning the Kings power by
acknowledging that it has been called in question, you say my friend has the
honor to be the first who controverts the authority of King and Parliament as
is evidently confirmed by the perpetual practice of Scotland before year 1648.
But as it is incontroverted that laws agreed to by King and Parliament are
indeed the ordinary binding laws until by the same authority they be
repealed; so seeing its uttermost import is that the same sovereign authority,
which in absolut Kingdoms is in the Prince alone, is with us divided betwixt,
and subjected unto, both King and Parliament, it is evident that this does no
more afford us any special determination, then it does conclude my friend to be
singular for asserting the lawfulness of resisting even the princes who are
reput absolute in case of their intolerable oppressions, wherein he has thou
sands of concurrents.

But not to trifle with you, my friend alleges the Kings limited power, and
makes use of the authority of the Parliament in justification of the
resistances made by us in the years. 1639. And 40. And 43. whereby superaddeing
to our natural and common right these civil and positive privileges he
accumulateth an unanswerable vindication. As for other times wherein, the
hypothesis varying, both King and Parliament became our party, what could be
more reasonable then to show that even the most absolut politic Empire that
can be lawfully set up by men is liable to these employed yea indispensable
conditions and exceptions, which in the case of an insupportable perversion do
certainly warrant the peoples necessar resistance, to which if you judge the
inquiry into the rise of Magistracy, the nature of a compact betwixt a King
and his subjects, and the precedents of these two absolut Kingdoms of Judah
and Israel recorded and approven in Scripture to be impertinent, I confess
your reasons are above my reach. I grant therefore that the subjects of
Scotland are obliged to acknowledge with all due obedience and submission the
sovereign authority of King and Parliament, and that this is the only
supreme authority known amongst us; but as the consent, contract, and trust by
which this authority is constitute are by their express end and the supposed
superior rules of reason most certainly qualified, both as to the point of
obedience which is by all acknowledged, and also as to that of submission by
none disowned in its constraining exigence; so I plainly affirm that not only
there was never a surrender made by any people in terminis disclaiming the
lawfulness of resistance in every case, and though the pressures should be the
most injust and violent; but that a surrender of that nature were in it self
utterly unlawful, and no ways obligatorie, for seeing it were unquestionably
contrair to the law of God for any people in the certain imminency of visible
destruction to betray themselves and their posterity in their lives, religion,
or liberties by a wilful and explicit acquiescence, it must necessarly follow
that either the controverted general surrender, by reason of the tacit
exceptions pleaded, has not the same import, or that in this respect it is
equally sinful.

But to this you object that if such submission be unlawful then they are self
murderers who suffer willingly when they are in a capacity to resist, and this
you second with an affected Alas for the aspersion that thence would ensue upon
the glorious martyrs as self murderers. Its answered that he who from the
mere sense of such a promised submission suffers himself, in a clear capacity
to resist, to be killed, is either a malicious or stupid self murderer, I
nothing doubt, but seeing that to renounce a privilege, and to forebeare its
exercise are things so vastly different, that oftentimes the contradiction of
the former is the latters greatest praise, the causes and motives which induced
these glorious witnesses into quiet forbearing, and their voluntary and
cheerful sufferings are so noble and conspicuous, that I will not so much as
call in question their capacity, though for the most part by providence wisely
overruled, either to vindicat their immortal fame, or relieve my self of your
pitiful sophistry. But here you think that my friend will look to escape by
the distinction of religion when it becomes a right settled by law from what was
before it was so established, But seeing it is evident that he only makes Law
an accession to that liberty which we have by God and natures original grant,
your delusive self-conceit that suggested unto you this apprehension, and your
weak opinion that a right righteously and necessarily established by Law can as
easily by a contrary Law be renversed are equally contemptible.

In the next place after a preface of your religious preferring of Gods
commandments to the Kings Laws, you fall upon an inference which you say my
friend does thence draw. viz. because when the Magistrate commands what is
contrary to Gods Law we are not bound to obey him, therefore when he punishes
contrary to that same Law we are not bound to suffer, And for this indeed you
treat him as Magisterially as if he were really that school boy to whom you do
dully resemble him, but sparing to inquire where it is that you do find him
barely delivering this consequence, and not being permitted in this place to
explain how that, regard to the Prince, his place and character, and the
general ends thereof, and how that many considerations of prudence, charity,
and patience may in lighter occasions persuade to subjection, where its proper
and formal reason has no immediate force, I shall only say that the comparing
of the limitation of our obedience with the case of our suffering is of
excellent use, in as much as it shows, first, that as a peoples indefinit
surrender though chiefly respecting their obedience does nevertheless imply
its tacit exceptions, so the seeming generality of the same surrender is no
argument to exclude all conditions in the point of subjection, next that seeing
a discretive judgment is allowed to the people in the matter of obedience,
there can be no reason wherefore in the matter of suffering a thing far more
obvious and dignoscible the same should by the men of your way be so much
decryed. Thirdly since it is certain that subjection to suffering was directly
commanded by God, and consented to by the people only for the securing of our
obedience, it may well be concluded that as in inferior unjust sufferings our
resistance is mostly restricted not by virtue of our formal obligation to
subjection, but by the forementioned influences, so when by notorious and
insufferable perversions all these are cut off and both the place is plainly
forefeited, prudence befooled, charity rendered desperate, and patience turned
into stupiditie, the liberty of resistance must of necessity be conceded. As
for the reason of disparitie by you adduced, viz. That in the case of the Kings
sinful command Gods countermand of our obedience is supposed to be clear,
whereas our sufferings are not countermanded though he punish unjustly, I shall
not reply to you that in the case of a stupid casting away of life or liberty
even sufferings as well as sinful obedience are certainly countermanded, but the
thing I would have you to advert to is, that seeing it is not so much the
obligation as the right and liberty of defense which we plead for, and seeing
in the case of intolerable sufferings the same is no less clearly warranted
then sinful suffering appears to be countermanded, the difference by you
asserted is but claudicant and insufficient.

But now you are weary of tracing my friends politics, and truly considering
how samely you have done it, I wonder you have traced them so far, only let me
tell you that if you shall be pleased to give me any further provocation upon
this subject, I here offer to make good all that my friend has asserted in
maintenance of the Peoples rights and liberties to the most critic, if
impartial, of your adherents.

You add that it is your chief design to prove that matters of Religion are
not to be decided by the sword. Pray Sir, speak plainly, you know and are
persuaded that we are neither for the propagation of Religion, nor determining
in its matters by the sword, all that we maintain is that in the case of
unjust suffering for the sake of Religion, however the honor and excellency of
the cause may much allay a man's smart, and make him cheerfully to undergo it,
even to a not-accepting, and seeming contempt of deliverance; yet he has the
Privilege of common defense no less then in other occasions, which if he find
the interest of Religions preservation to concur it ought so much the more to
animat his resolution, now if this be a spirit totally different from Christ's
who came not to destroy the Law but teaches us to fulfill all righteousness, I
leave it to your own second thoughts. Christ's Kingdom is indeed not of this
World and that he did most evidently demonstrat by telling that if his Kingdom
were of this World then would his servants fight, and therefore seeing that
even for his own rescue he had not called them when he might have had ten
Legions of Angels upon his desire, that his Kingdom was not from thence could
not be doubted; but to turn this over as if our Lord had said, Because my
Kingdom is not of this World, therefore my servants may not fight, so much as
for their own preservation, is a manifest ranversing of both the text and the
truth.

Next you tell us, That to stir up to Religions defense by its value is but
an ignorant though plausible mistake; but as your persuading us to abandon the
maintenance of Religion by the firmness of Gods decree, and our Lords
Kingdom, sounds more like the Turkish error of unalterable fate, then to a
Christian deference to divine providence, which always admits of our lawful
concurse; and as this your doctrine is most palpably contradicted by the
constant practice of the whole Christian World, who with might and maine do
arm for, and stand to the defense of Religion against the invasion of
infidels; so your extenuation as if the hazard of our lives, fortunes, and
liberties were not to be regarded, is but an insipide deceitful affectation: if
God in the dispensations of his holy and wise providence especially by bringing
us under the power of men, subject us to suffering and call for a testimony,
it is most certain that neither ought Religions concern to discourage nor the
considerations of life, fortune, and liberty in the least to demurre us, but
thence to infer, that in case either a Nation or a Person (for as to the
point in general there can be no difference) be unjustly and violently invaded
for Religion, they ought without further care in a tempting confidence, that
Religion cannot be endangered by the Worlds opposition, and a base and
unrequired abjection of themselves and their interests foolishly throw Religion
and all down headlong unto the rage of in jurie and tyranny, is a doctrine too
agreeable to the Devils temptation for to deceive any rational man. The truth
of the matter therefore is, that as we ought neither to flight nor apprehend
too much our own prejudice, so it is from patient and not by stupid sufferings
that our holy profession receives the advantage.

But to this you subioine your grand discovery viz. that the great design of
the gospel is to elevat our minds to a noble contempt of the world, and a just
disreguard of our bodies, etc. whence persuading patience, trust in God, and
submission to his will you conclude, let all the world judge whether suffering
so like to it or fighting speaking out a froward and impatient mind do best
agree with this temper and design.

Sir, if I may so far digress under your conduct, I would say in the first
place, that the great design of the Gospel is to reconcile sinners unto God
through Jesus Christ who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption; your representing it by elevations of mind and
neglectings of the body does savor too rankely of that dangerous error of
making the righteousness of Christ a mere help to ours, and the Gospel only
the perfection of morality, next I say that setting aside the necessity and
beauty of every duty in its season, if it were all your intention to commend
suffering above fighting, I would not only with you in your judicious
discerning prefer patient suffering to passionat and impatient fighting
(things which I suppose were never before compared) but even in humanity, let
be in Christianity, advance the palm of a well composed, and resolved
patience; above the laurel of a warlike though righteous triumph. But because
your rise taken from the design of the Gospel does plainly enough insinuat
that it is the particular fightings for religion which you go about to decry,
it is in thithat I desire more distinctly to know your consequence; seeing the
same arguments of heavens hope, and this worlds contempt do equally mitigat the
passions, and depretiat the worldly prizes of all wars whatsomever, to admit
that Religion does allow all other lawful wars except what is levied in its
own defense is evidently in an excess of self denial to make it deny nay
destroy it self, but seeing all the pretensions that we have here repeated out
of the late dialogues of the Gospels design, spirituality of Religion, the
probability by sufferings of advance to the Gospel, and carnality of fighting
are already sufficiently discussed by their answerer I shall at present content
my self to pass them with a few remarks. As 1. That seeing you are upon the
persecuting side (pardon to truth the uneasinesse of the expression) or at
least do exhort to patience your antagonists and not your partakers in the same
cause, you must permit us to apprehend design as well as truth in all your
reasonings 2. Although if the will of God be so the Gospel excellently instruct
to suffering, yet it neither condemns lawful wars, nor is it imaginable
wherefore defensive wars being allowed, a defensive war upon the most
injurious provocation viz. persecution for Religion should not be accounted
most righteous. 3. That though patient suffering and holding fast of his name
under persecution be a strong and convincing evidence of our faith and hope,
yet as our Lord by retaining the dispensation in his own hand has only
commanded unto us the manner of our suffering, and having expressly permitted
flight has not engaged us to run upon it, so to use the right and capacity
which God gives of self defense without furious passion or revengeful design
can neither be reprehended nor suspected, I know a wicked man may fight
courageously for Christ, and so have some blasphemers and Atheists suffered
constantly, but seeing we have seen the same persons, with the same strength of
grace, both offer themselves resolutly, and suffer in testimony even of their
fighting most patiently, you must pardon us to reguard the truth more then your
cavilling exceptions.

But in the following section you go about to disprove defensive wars against
persecutions for religion by our Lords precepts and practices, who you say
blessed those who should suffer jor him. And why not? Surely they are
pronounced blessed and they shall be blessed, But he threatened them that drew
the sword, well, for him you dare not add, and against him is not doubted, nay
suppose it had been against Peter attempting his personal deliverance it had
given you no advantage, since he also rebuked him as Satan for desiring him to
spare himself; he blessed likewise the peace makers entituling them the
children of God, and our hearts desire is that God would raise up to us a true
peacemaker, to reduce you unto wisdom, whose ways are ways of pleasantness
and all her paths are peace. The incendiaries of war are indeed no where
pronounced happy and the boutefeus of rebellion are certainly the children of
him who was a murderer from the beginning; but, Sir, is this fair dealing? The
question that you move and have to prove is, that my friend is an incendiarie
and boutefeu and behold without any reason offered, you not only conclude him
but condemn him, it were undoubtedly as easy and abundantly just for me to
inquire where perjurious persecuters are pronounced happy, etc, but I will not
so much as retort or retaliat with such expressions, such as breath out war
and cruelty know not what spirit, they are of and our prayer to God is that
they who breathing out threatenings and slaughter against us term just defense
and necessary resistance war and cruelty may at length have their eyes
opened, All in the Gospel Dispensation is truly gentle and peaceable; and yet
of all things in the world it has been most reproached for tumult and
sedition; but the great consolation of all its followers is, that its author
the God of peace will one day make known all false pretenders, and its Lord the
Prince of Peace for their persecutions here will in the end bless with
everlasting peace all its true lovers, when according to the excellent order of
the Gospels rule of peace the Kingdom of God shall be fully revealed in
righteousness first, and then in peace and joy in the holy ghost.

But you say that all this viz a non-resistance of, and submission to
persecution was signally confirmed by our masters unexampled sufferings, and
yet you know so well that the free and voluntary sufferings of our Lord are in
themselves no less unexampled then unimitable, and that it is the manner and
not the matter thereof that we are to follow, that I cannot but doubt your
sincerity, Christ not only refused the aid of the sword but came into the
world willingly, went up to Jerusalem steadfastly, exposed himself knowingly,
and lastly would not ask the assistance of legions of Angels ready at his
desire that the Scriptures signifieing how that he ought to have suffered might
be fulfilled; and is it possible that you can think, that these specific acts
are for our imitation? But you say that he entailed perdition on these that
should draw the sword to wit all these that are not warranted to do it by the
Magistrate. How long will you love vanity and seek after leesing? Our Lord in
that place does most plainly, for the averting of Peter's unseasonable zeal,
and the comforting of all his Disciples, denounce that all these who take the
sword unjustly shall perish by the sword, and. Rev. 13.10. we have the parallel
place more fully set down he that kills with the sword must be killed with
the sword (spoken of persecuting Magistrates as well as others) Here is the
patience and the faith of the Saints, And yet you have the confidence to smooth
it over as if this sad doom had been pronounced not only against Peter but
all such as shall be by the force of oppression constrained to their own
defense.

You add that he witnessed that good confession before Pilat that Caesar
needed apprehend no hazard from his Kingdom, since it not being of this world
was not to be fought for. And do you indeed think that this is the emphasis of
that good confession viz to satisfy Cesars unjust fears? O perverse flattery!
The excellent goodness of our Lords confession cannot but be sweetly relished
by every serious Christian to lie in these words thou say that I am a King
to this end was I borne and for this cause came I unto the world that I should
bear witness unto the truth, how then are you not ashamed not only to wrest
it unto the pitiful interest of Princes; but to misconstrue the whole passage
as if our Lord in purging himself by a voluntary and free forbearance of the
affectation of a worldly Kingdom did in effect disowne all defensive arms to
the encouraging and strengthening of the most bloody tyrans.

You think it strange that through the whole Gospel we should meet with
repeated blessings on these that suffer, but never one upon such as fight; but
if our Lord having declared that he came not to destroy the Law of
righteousness did accommodat his encouragements to his Apostles, unto the
dispensation fo his providence under which for the greater glory of the power
of his free grace he thought good to gather and train up his Church, should
you or any else be thereat stumbled; for my part when I reflect upon both the
sufferings and grace of the primitive times and how the Lord did order them, I
rather wonder at that admonition by you observed that they should sell their
coats to buy swords; but you say had the Disciples understood this of the
material sword either their practices or writings should have had some vestiges
of that sense, by the which very argument a man may as easily deny that the
Purse there spoken of is to be taken for a material one; but seeing the tenor of
the context and relation made by the Lord to their former mission do exhibit
the meaning with that evidence as cannot be convelled, for want of an
unoccasioned confirmation, I go on to examine the rest of your gloss upon the
place; and taking notice that the Disciples at the time by presenting two
swords did show that they understood the Lord to speak of a material sword you
say that by his answer it is enough, which cannot relate to the two swords
produced no wise enough for eleven persons, he corrects their error and breaks
off their purpose as if he had said, enough of this, or no more of it, since he
saw they misunderstood his former words of a sword. Thus rather then to assent
to truth you would have our Lord by such a stop tacitly to acknowledge his own
inadvertency, but the passage is too obvious to be thus abused, in as much as
our Lord having before both signified and prepared for his own imminent
departure, forewarnes them by the necessity, of a purse and a sword of the
straits and dangers that would ensue, whereupon they, its like, out of their
blind and forward desire to have him delivered from the hand of the jews lay
hold on his words and show him two swords, probably with a confident
remembrance of his former miracles, and this their precipitancy our Lord
according to the meek and sweet composure to his patience now entering upon his
sufferings thinks fit to restrain with this short correction it is enough, i.
e. it is enough at this season, there must be no resistance in my voluntary
suffering: whether then yours or this explication be the more genuine I refer
it to the discerning of all understanding men.

But yet from all this you say it will easiely appear to one who examines the
matter without prejudice whether suffering or fighting have the clearest
characters of Christ's meekness. Sir though the nature of war being
considered, the comparison of suffering and fighting in the point of meekness
seems almost to be inept, yet if you will be pleased to advert how that our
Lord as well in his victorious triumph as in his lowest sufferings is
represented in the Revel: under the same figure of the Lamb, its like you may
come to understand that that calm staidness of mind, which by all is reput
the truest mark of the noblest courage, may in a Christian champion be yet
further advanced and beautified with his Masters meekness.

Your last argument against defensive arms upon the account of religion is
that the doctrine of suffering tends most to the recommending of the Christian
religion to all Princes and Stats, whereas the doctrine of defense may
prepossesse their minds with the deepest prejudices, etc. Thus to carry your
cause you care not what you say, this argument can have no process unless we
suppose in all Princes and States a most irrational aversion for religion, viz,
such as cannot endure that it should pretend to any manner of right or comport
with its professors at a lower rate then the absolute subjection of their lives
and liberties; upon this account, and yet without the least check of
correction, you bestow upon it a whole long paragraph. But seeing that all we
plead amounts to no more then that religion the great instructor of
righteousness may not deprive us of all right, and that its high honor may
not depresse men below the condition of slaverie, you must pardon me to think
your insinuation more odious then obliging.

But for to mend your error you add that indeed the Alcoran incites to kill
all who are not Musulmans but our holy profession rejects carnal weapons from
its defense. Who heard ever such distraction? Can we not detest the Mahumetan
Barbaritie of forceing religion by the sword, unless we lay open all
Christendom to their rage and cruelty? Or is your mind so blinded by your
design that you could not perceive the fair and rational midse of the
lawfulness of self defense against intolerable oppression, and that as well
yea rather when inflicted for, and levelled to destroy religion, then in the
case of any other unjust pretense, without either impinging upon the turkish
violent propagations on the one hand, or betraying the cause of religion by a
base stupiditie upon the other? Religion certainly in it self is no occasion of
wars, but if your Musulemans make it so, must we therefore abandon both it
and our selves to their pleasure? And if unjust wars do arise from your
lusts may not a just opposition very well consist, nay be warranted by that
which injoynes the mortifying of them all? Sir your lapses here are so gross
and raw against all right and reason that I am ashamed to draw forth against
you positive conclusions.

To these things you subjoyne the praise of Religion, For the allegiance
toward Princes and peaceablenesse toward fellow subjects which it teaches,
thence commending both its innocence and the great security it gives unto all
societies, but say you, the doctrine of resistance will change its whole visage
so that this day star whose aspects are benign will look like a fierie-eomet
blazing wars, etc. Sir, this charge appears to be so weighty that I
willingly wave its extravagance, that I may meet with its reason, For (you
continue) if this principle be drunk in by Christian societies they may for
ever despair of peace, since all cannot be of one mindein matters of Religion,
and the side or party oppressed would undoubtedly raise sturs. But seeing the
principle you inveigh against is in effect none other then that right of
self-preservation most deeply engraven in natures tables, to which we plead,
that Religion according to its dignity, in the case of persecution, intending
the injury, may make no exception, is it not evident that your arguing against
this Privilege as a novel seditious conceit is in effect nothing else save a
colorable pretext, through which Religion is only struck at as in its nature
altogether unpeaceable and the very seed of endless contentions? But the
matter is plain, the right self-defence is the principal reason both of the
institution and continuance of Government, Religion in it self is one, simple,
most pure, and peaceable; all contended for, is, that such as by embracing of
it do become partakers of the highest blessing may not therefore forfeit the
most common rights, if this be to turn this heavenly and benign star of
Religion unto a fiery blazing comet, and not rather by maligning it, with all
the perversities of its adversaries, unless it be made obnoxious to all their
injuries, either to render it odious to Princes, or liable to all the
arbitrarie imposings and persecutions of tyranny, let all men judge; it is
true that by reason of man's corruption a harmony in Religion is scarce to be
attained, but because error and irreligion will always be stirring,
persecuting, and provoking to stirrs and tumults, must therefore the truth and
its professors be stupidely submitted to their lust and rage? You say, That
even we ourselves would sinde it a hard pull to govern at this rate, specially
if we keep up our quarrels both at toleration and moderation. How? Would we
find it so hard a task by keeping faith to retain both obedience and peace,
and by pleasing God to please all men? That this was the true Crisis of our
affairs in the late revolution I believe thousands do now see, who then would
not, as for your objecting of our quarrels at tolleration and moderation, is
not this a strange envy, that because we cannot stretch to a compliance with
all the present evil courses, therefore even our just hatred at error and
heresy specially seeing it was so very dissoyal and seditious must also be
reckoned to our disadvantage.

After this you tell us that from this principle there were no peace to be
expected from Papists. And to deal fairly and shortly with you I freely accord
that if the Papists did hold the truth, and were therefore intolerably
persecut, they might very lawfully resist in their own necessary defense; but
since they both practice gross idolatry and other abominations, and are also
restless in their wicked machinations, it is evident that they could as little
reclaim against deserved punishment under the notion of persecution, as at
present they are largely indulged.

For a conclusion then you tell us that the doctrine of patient peaceable
suffering excludes all hazards, and is therefore more for the interest of
mankind and peace of societies. And certainly that which surrenders all has
no hazard to apprehend. But if the Christian world had been of your opinion,
how had its religion long since been swallowed up of Turcisme? And if our
fathers in the first dawnings of reformation had no after a noble conflict of
martyrdomes and persecutions discerned the times, and laid hold on the
opportunity, I am sure in all probability Scotland had been to this day as
France, and worse, and the United as the Spanish Netherlands, and all Germainie
under one cloud. If you do therefore judge Religion to be of the interest of
mankind do not deny it the liberty of a right nor deprive it of its just
privilege, seeing on the one hand this is not more iniquous and in effect
impossible, then on the other your pretendings to peace by such arguing do
visibly tend to the ruin of truth.

Having gone this far with my friend you desire him to look back seriously
upon these two different methods of advancing religion that he may see whether
of them will preponderat. But Sir if I may prevail with you in any thing, I
earnestly obtest you to use more ingenuitie, did ever we assert or practice the
advancing of religion by fighting? Or did we at any time in order to this end
so much as lay suffering and fighting in one balance? Or lastly must I again
inculcat that all that we maintain, is, that in case of violent persecution
for religion the oppressed may lawfully assume their own defense as upon the
provocation of any other injury whatsomever.

After this, dissembling your knowledge of our aversion for war, not capable to
be engaged but by manifest extremity, you please your self with some few
speculations of the advantages of peace and disadvantages of war: but seeing
such little arts are sufficiently discussed by the simple noticing, let us hear
how you make it out by Scripture instance that fighting is not a method
approved of God for advancing his cause, And for eschewing cavil, I am here
willing to think that by advancing of his cause you only mean the preservation
of religion and its professors against their persecutors, and your first
instance is of the Israelits who while in Egypt long oppressed in their
religion and liberty though very numerous and in a probable capacity yet made
no attempt by force for their own deliverie. But pray Sir do you think the
Israelites in their bondage could have foughten with weapons when they were
denied straw? Or does not such headless quibling as manifestly conclude that
because of their constrained subjection under their several oppressors the time
of the judges, therefore their after vindications of their liberty were sinful,
but the truth is seeing that if God so ordered the matter in his providence as
the Israelits neither did nor could endeavor their own liberty, that he
might in his own way manifest his glory, your inference that therefore either
they might not have done it lawfully, or that we are obliged to imitat their
forced and simple omissions is not worth the noticing, and really this
reasoning is so weak and pitiful that I am almost ashamed to have repeated it.

The next instance which you promise shall be yet stronger (as truly it had
need) is taken from the ten tribes non resistance to Jeroboams defection, but
knowing that they willingly walked after the commandment, and that if they had
had the smallest measure of that zeal for religion which they testified for
their own liberty, they had not so tamely complied in that bakessiding, you
recurre to the silence of the Prophets telling us that if popular reformation
had been the peoples ductie certainly they had exhorted to it. Well Sir, is
this your stronger reasoning? The Prophets by all the pains and industry they
did use could ot awake this stubborn people to repentance, and yet because
forsooth they did not expressly excit them active to reform, who were in
effect to have been its only objects, from this you conclude that the thing was
not their duty.

But you add that though Achab added the idolatry of Baal to the sin of the
Calves, yet Eliah never sturred up the people to arms, is not this solid
arguing? The people of Israel had at this time so deeply revolted that when the
Prophet put it home to them, if the Lord be God follow him, but if Baal then
follow him, they answered not a word, yea afterward when he was forced to flee
from Jezabels rage he thought he had been the only seeker of the true God left
in Israel, and yet without any reguard to a most manifest unlikeliehood you
think because the Prophet did not preposterously call them to it, that
therefore (notwithstanding all that my friend has said for it) national
reformation was not their part, the absurdity of which argument is so much the
more gross, that even in the same Prophet and people after a due preparation
you may find your assertion contradicted, in as much as immediately upon the
back of their acknowledgement of the Lord to be God Elijah said unto them (the
King being present) take the Prophets of Baal, let none of them escape, etc. a
very probable intimation that not only they might have done it, though the
King had countermanded, but that even without Eliah's exhortation it had been
nothing beside their duty.

From Israel you pass to Judah and finding there the like defections you
repeat to us the same observes, but seeing that all the Prophets do testify
aloud of the universal bakeslidings of that people together with their Kings,
and Isaiah and Jeremiah do expressly and frequentlie complain that none did
call for justice, or plead for truth, etc. And that they were not valiant for
the truth, as it is evident that they are thereby charged with lukewarmenesse
in the cause of God, so it seems that for the generality they were no less
perverse in heart then their ringleaders in these defections, as these very
persecutions perhaps of faithful dissenters under Manasse whom you vainly
represent as ignorant of our politics may very plainly evince? And as for that
of Libnah seeing the Scripture expressly says, that they did revolt from under
the hand of the King (and not from under Judah as the Edomits did) Because he
had foresaken the Lord God of his Fathers, your questioning its approbation,
because of the not ensuing of the like practice, is both presumptuous against
Scripture evidence, and derogatorie from the praise of all more noble and rare
exploits.

Having proposed your instances as we have heard, you seal them with a grave
truly you must consesse these instances to be strong, and really since you
deal so obligingly with my friend as not to force him by any reason, I believe
if the thing were a matter of complement he would in civility cede it, but
seeing it is truth we contend for, without further canvassing of what you
subjoine of the nature of Moses dispensation or the Gospels call to the Cross,
I frankely leave it as you do with all free minds to consider whether your
poor blind negatives be of any moment to preponderat that clear light of
reason which shines in our assertions, and is confirmed both by old testament
examples and new testament approbations, as my friend and the answerer of the
dialogues do evidently hold out.

As to your ensuing section anent the first ages of the Church their
unacquaintednesse with this doctrine and your boasting Historical observe, that
until Pope Gregory the 7th his days it was unheard of in the Church, with your
endeavors to render it odious by the patrociny of Cannonists and Jesuits it is
so exactly the same with the discourse of the dialogues, and is by the answerer
so clearly discussed, that I am not afraid to oppose his single reply to your
vain repetitions; one thing I must tell you, that seeing you cannot deny that
about and after Constantines days when Christians arrived to a greater
consistency and better capacity not only did Constantine himself with the
express approbation and assisting presence of the Godliest teachers in these
times fight against Licinius for his persecutions, but also both the oppressed
Christians in the east did assert by arms the liberty of the Gospel against
Jovius, Maximinus and at other times and in other places they implored the aid
of Christian and orthodox Emperors against pagan and Arrian persecuters, your
endeavor to put a tashe upon these practices as criminal which yet all the
after ages of the Church have approven, and to evade by saying that the
doctrine was not then owned which was only not expressly maintained, because
not contradicted, is nothing at all ingenuous; and therefore since it is
certain that even the most excellent truths have been liable to the foulest
abuses, neither your odious dating of the doctrine of resistance from a
notorious Papal rebellion, nor your futilous essay to make men believe that
its only propagators were the Popes Parasits do deserve any further notice.

And now we are come to the close of your Letter, wherein conceiting that
either you have made sure our conviction, or discovered our cure to be with men
impossible you think good to give a testimony to your self, which I am
persuaded, considering the folly or falsehood of the poor purpose that I have
perused, among all that have written on the subject you deserve least. But if
you miss of your own praise, you are resolved my friend shall fare no better,
and therefore, as if this were the first of it, you pretend constraint for one
severe word to tell him, whom almost in the beginning you termed an agent of
hell, as evil as Beelzebub, that you do fear him to be in the gall of
bitterness, Sir, although such reproaches be to me very light, yet I wish that
for your own souls good you would seriously ponder that to undervalue the
grace, and despise the glory of the work and cause of God that we have seen in
the land, to strengthen the wicked in their wickedness, and add affliction to
these whom for conscience only men do persecute, are characters of this
wretched and woeful state, equal (if not worse) to what appeared in him against
whom these words were first pronounced, whether your preceding discourse and
subsequent stricture in this place against the cause of God do partake of these
evils I leave it with your self.

Your last observe is upon my friends postscript, occasioned by the Bishop of
St Andrews his affirming in a sermon that the subjects lives were more the
Kings then their own, and his passage so moves your spleen, that it is evident
you resolve to be behind with him in nothing, and therefore after you have
charactered him as insolent, guilty of rebellion, and treason, all the
difference betwixt you and him is that what the postscript would have done by
St Andrews upon himself in a just consonancy to and punishment of his lying
flattery, you would have the King for no cause to inflict on my friend as real
demerit. But that which I concern my self most to notice, is the medium that
you use to convince us of the truth of the Bishops position, viz. that because
a subject committing a capital crime has no right to be the executioner of
justice on himself, therefore his life is more in the Kings power then in his
own but not to differ with you about their pitiful words which were that all
men's lives are in the Kings hand and hold of him, what ever agreement or place
the argument may have as to the Bishop, and amongst his accomplices, persons its
like conscious of their own guilt, yet sure I am as all honest men are without
the compass of such a title, so he must be a fool as well as a knave that will
hold a plain forfiture to the King to be a good tenor of him; the Bishop no
doubt thought he had passed a great complement upon his Majesty when by putting
his life in the Kings power he gave more unto him then he has himself, but
when you come to be his interpreter how strangely do you misserve them both?
the Bishop by supposing him to be criminal, and fo making him by right to amitt
what he thought he had freely given, and the King, by presenting him with
nothing else then the forefeited lives of wretched catives in place of the
loyal resignation of free leiges; but leaving these your follies which if they
had escaped my friend had no doubt been lashed by you as dull buffonries and
the coursest of rallerie without either edge or point, the truth is our lives
are not our own; all souls are mine says the Lord, and therefore as we
neither can give them up absolutely unto the Prince his arbitrary disposal, not
has the Lord even in the case of the most atrocious crime obliged the criminal
to be felo dese and his own executioner, so all the power the Magistrate can
pretend is only founded in the sentence of righteous Law, by which the person
guilty, losing his right, is therefore both by the will of God, and his own
consent subjected to the Magistrates execution and how much this does militat
both against the Bishops flattery and the pretensions of tyranny all sober
men may preceive.

Thus Sir in place of your examining my friends book in bulk, evident enough by
the grossness of your reflections, I have considered your Letter by retaile,
wherein I am assured you will see that I have omitted to answer nothing except
such things as silence will best reprove, What satisfaction you will find in
my reply depends upon your self: only in this I think I merit your
acknowledgement that by my prevention I have delivered you our of my friends
hands, who probably would have searched you out in a more accurat manner, if my
sineere endeavors shall produce to you any greater advantage, it is according
to the serious desire of one who though he has no reason to be more, yet
subscribeth himself,

SIR, Your real well-wisher.
