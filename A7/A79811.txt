The Cities welcome to Colonel RICH and Colonel BAXTER, with their solemn
Invitation to the Sainted Commanders in the Army, to come and Quarter amongst
them.
IF we may, dare to say,
That you most welcome are,
Most holy, holy, Colonels,
Great Mogulls of the War:
Our blessed Parliament,
Most wisely for you sent,
Your Forces near to draw
For to keep us in awe.
For we are sure to be
Your Vassailes, and your Slaves,
And it is but Justice we confess,
That Knaves should stoop to Knaves:
We were the first that strove,
Such was our Zealous love,
We are the last shall smart,
But you shall bear a part.
Therefore come with Fife and Drum,
Ye Army that are Sainted,
And Quarter here amongst us,
We long to be acquainted:
O 'twill be very brave,
Free Quarter here to have,
Each house turned to an Inn,
What wonders then begin?
Hewson, Col. Hewson a Shomaker.
we have been to thee,
E're now obliged much,
For Shoes which thou have sold us,
Therefore we shall not grutch.
Pride, Col. Pride sometime a Drayman.
thee we shall not jeere,
Thou ever brought good Beer,
Measure thou did allow,
We Will licour thee I vow.
Okey, Col. Okey a Tailor.
thou have e're now,
Before we were such Noddies,
Although thou stolest half in half,
Made Garments for our boddies.
Stains, Stains a cozening Alchymist
pray be thou not mist,
Who art an Alchymist,
When we have spent our store,
Thy Stone will help to more.
Watson, Watson a Clipper.
thee I long to see
By God, and by the Hallowes,
We are glad that for embating Coin,
Thou lately scap'st the Gallows.
Come Lambert, Lambert a Dipper.
there is a Crew
Would be baptized a new,
Come with thy Troops to Town,
Help Maids and Wives to drown.
Oliver, King Cromwell.
we thee prefer,
To guide these boys unto us,
Thou art the King of our New State,
And worthy to undo us:
Thy Nose and fiery Face,
Speaks thee a babe of Grace,
And most regenerate,
As Sack did e're create.
There Is no such thing as CHARLES our King,
We here renounce Him ever,
We Will have no King, but thee sweet Nol,
Or Tom that glorious Feather:
Our houses we will prepare
For thy brave men of War,
Our Wives we will adorn,
He Is happy wears the Horn.
Don't you believe we will deceive
Our trust, or the least harm you,
Or that we will a rising make,
And then by force dis-arme you:
Or that when as you sleep,
We Will on your faces peep,
And for to gain your Coats,
Most wisely cut your throats.
You cannot sure but be secure
Amongst us that first did raise you,
Who have allowed you constant pay,
And evemore did praise you:
Do you not fear to venture
Amongst us for to enter,
You know the Danes thrived well
Until the dismal Knell.
Alas you know, the case is so,
We now must be content
To smart for our base follies,
Our Trusty Parliament
(And you) have jointly now agreed
To prey on all we have,
But yet by God we will break the rod,
And fight, our goods to save.
The Scottish Nation are out of fashion,
You have no farther need,
But Jockey is resolved
To come on this side Tweed:
They Will now not be content,
To have their Money sent,
They Will come themselves and strain,
And then turn back again.
But first those men accursed,
That have abused their King,
They mean to call to an account
For their good Governing:
Say must no longer Rule,
Nor Martin that same Mule,
And all the Holy Flock
Must taste the Chopping-block.
White Hall now I know not how,
Is topsie-turvey turned,
The Thimble-makers bonney boys Col. Baxter.

Have private Mansions scorned:
Kings Houses only be
Fit for our Souldierie,
Parliament, Army, All,
Are Kings in General.
Come then dear Brethren,
and Fortify the City,
All that is in it we know is yours,
Yet pray show us some pity;
Or rather be so wise,
To follow this advice,
Keep your selves where you are,
For we your Mart shall mar.
Finis.
