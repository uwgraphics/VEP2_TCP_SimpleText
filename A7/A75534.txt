The Arcadian Lovers OR, Colin and Amarillis.
Being a Composure, Richly Illustrated with the indeared expressions of a
Shepherd and Shepherdess, for the pleasure and delight of all amorous Fancies.

To be sung in a Tune of great rarity.


Upon the smooth Arcadian plain,
Where the Lambs do frisk amain,
Fair Amarillis and her Swain,
With hand in hand, were walking;
The Sweets to prove, of harmless Love,
They Amorously were talking.
She was clothed all in green,
And surpass the Fairy Queen,
Which made poor Colin for to seem
Amazed with her Beauty;
To Prize his Dear, beyond compare
He took't to be his duty,
She for joy did neatly trip,
Whilst their flocks about them skip,
When Colin sat, a while to prate,
She courteously sat by him;
And for to strive, if he were kind,
Thus prettily she did try him.
Amarillis told her Swain,
To complete their joys again,
That he should love her and be plain,
And think not to deceive her;
Then he protested by his troath,
That he would never leave her.
O Colin if thou constant prove,
And that thou will not slight my love,
There Is never a Swain upon this plain,
That ever shall come near thee;
For Garlands and Embroidered Scrips,
Oh Colin, I love thee dearly.
But Colin if thou change thy Love,
And seek my fury once to move,
A Tygress unto thee i will prove,
When er'e thou do come near me;
O Amarillis fear not that,
For I do love thee dearly.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.


OH Colin if thou provest kind,
And never more will change thy mind
I Will deck ye bowers, with fragrant flowers,
Whose pleasure shall invite thee;
With boughs to shroud thee from the showrs
Whilst Colin I will delight thee.
O Amarillis I rejoice,
For to hear thy pleasing voice,
Then never think my only Dear,
That I will er'e deceive thee;
But cast aside such doubts and fear,
I vow I will never leave thee.
O Colin, how it joys my heart,
That our Loves shall never part,
Amyntas and his Chloris fair,
Did never enjoy such pleasure;
Nor Coridon and Philis rare,
I prize thee above all treasure.
O Amarillis change a kiss,
In token of a further bliss,
Whilst every Swain, upon this plain,
Does envy our embraces;
I Will sound thy praises in high strain,
To keep thee from all disgraces.
My Colin if a kiss be all,
I Will not refuse what ere befall,
I am inclined, our Loves to bind,
On such a harmless fashion;
Since never a Swain, could yet ere stain,
My innocent reputation.
O my dearest Love quoth he
Now our hearts do both agree,
No Shepherd on Arcadia's Ground,
Shall ever prove so loyal;
Now Amarillis thou have found,
My love will abide the trial.
Then Colin straight began to Sing,
And made the hills with eccho's ring,
In Amarillis softy praise,
He pleasant rimes composes;
Whilst she makes garlands of green bays
For Colin bedeckt with Roses.
Thus they past their time in sport,
And still thought it was but short,
Till young and old, their flocks did fold,
To keep them safe from straying;
And so the night did part them quite,
Which merrily had been playing.
