HIS MAJESTY'S LETTER AND DECLARATION to the SHERIFFS and CITY of LONDON.
January 17.1642.
TRusty and Wellbeloved, We greet you well. We received lately a Petition from
the Aldermen and Common Council of Our City of London, by the hands of
Persons entrusted by them for the delivery, who found such a reception from Us,
as well manifested Our regard to that body which sent them; Though We well knew
by whom that Petition was framed, and where perused and examined, before it was
approved by those from whom it seemed to be sent, yet We were so willing to
enter into a correspondence with that Our City, and to receive any address
and application from them, according to that Invitation We had given by Our
late Proclamation; And were so glad to find that there was yet some hopes they
would look to the Peace and happiness of that City, and at last sever
themselves from any Faction or dependence, which might insensibly involve them
in those Calamities they did not Foresee, that We returned such a gracious
Answer thereunto, so full of Candor and Affection, that the meanest Inhabitant
of that Our City, if he carefully consider the same, will find himself
concerned in it, and that We have had an especial care of his particular. With
this Answer of Ours We sent a servant of Our own, in the company of those who
had been so well used here, to require and see that it might be communicated to
the whole body of that Our City; not doubting but that both it and the Bringei
should receive such Entertainment there, as might manitest their due regard of
Us, and of Our Affection to them: But to Our great wonder, We find that after
ten days Attendance, and suffering ridiculous Pamphlets to be published in Our
name, as if We retracted Our former Resolutions, (which Pamphlet We have caused
to be burned by the hand of the Hangman, as We also require you to see don)
instead of that admission We expected to Our Messenger and Message, guards of
Armed Men have been brought to keep Our good Subjects, to whom that Our Answer
was directed, from being present at the reading thereof; and Speeches have been
made by Strangers (who have been admitted to the City Counsels, contrary to
the Freedom and Custom of those meetings,) to Blast Our said Answer, and to
Dishonor and Slander Us, which if Our good Subjects there shall suffer, We
shall be much discouraged in Our desired correspondence with that Our City,
and so by the cunning and power of those Incendiaries mentioned in Our Answer
(Alderman Pennington (who to show his great Loyalty to Us, and his fitness to
be the chief Magistrate of such a City, being informed that a desperate person
there, said, that he hoped shortly to wash his hands in Our Blood, refused to
send any Warrant, or to give any direction to any Officer for his
Apprehension,) Ven, Fulke, and Manwaring) who have plunged that Our City into
such unspeakable Calamities, in which they would still keep it to cure their
own desperate condition, Our good Subjects there are not suffered to receive
Our gracious Answer to that Petition; We have therefore thought fit to write
these Our Letters to you, requiring you the Sheriffs of Our said City, to
take care for the publishing that Our Answer (which We herewith send you) to
Our good Subjects of that Our City; And Our pleasure is, That you the Masters
and Ward^ns of the several Companies of Our said City forthwith summon all
the Members of your several Companies, with all the Freemen and Apprentises
(whose hopes and interests are so much blasted in these general Distractions)
belonging thereunto, to appear at your several Halls, where you shall cause
Our said Answer, together with these Our Letters, to be publicly read, that
all Our good Subjects may clearly understand how far we have been from
begetting, how far We are from continuing or nourishing these unnatural
civil dissentions, and how much it is in their own power to remove the present
pressures, and to establish the future happiness and glory of that famous
City, and may seriously weigh every part of that Our Answer, as well that
which carries caution in it for the future, as pardon for what is past, for
assure your selves, for the time to come, We shall proceed with all severity
against such who shall incur the penalty of the Law in those points, of which
we have given them so fair a warning in Our said Answer, and whosoever shall
not behave himself like a good Subject in this Our Kingdom, shall not (if We
can help it) receive the benefit and advantage of being Our Subject in any
other; but all Foreign Princes shall know, that as such Person has parted
with his Loyalty to Us, so he must not hope for any Security by Us, and to that
purpose We shall henceforward have a very inquisitive Eye upon the Actions of
all Our Subjects, that some example may be made, how easy it is for Us to
punish their disloyalties abroad, who for a time may avoid Our Justice at home.
And to the end that none of Our good Subjects of that Our City may think
themselves bound to obey any of the Orders or Commands of the pretended Lord
Major (whom We have and do still accuse of high Treason, and conspiring to
take Our Life from Us,) It is well known to those Citizens who understand the
Charter of that City (so amply granted by Our Royal Progenitors, and so
graciously confirmed by Us, and of which We presume Our good Subjects there do
still desire to receive the benefit,) that the said Isaac Pennington was never
regularly elected, or lawfully admitted to be Lord Major of that Our City,
that in truth Alderman Cordwell, was by the plurality of voices chosen, and
that this Man was never presented to, or admitted by Us, in such manner as is
prescribed by their said Charter, neither had that Judge, who presumed to
swear him, any more color of Law or Authority to administer such an Oath to
him, then he has to do the same to morrow to any other Alderman of the City:
And We do therefore hereby Declare the said Isaac Pennington not to be Major
of that Our City of London, and to have no lawful Authority to exercise the
same, and that Our good Subjects of that Our City, ought not to submit to any
Orders, directions, or commands which shall issue from him as Lord Major of
that Our City, but that the same are void and of none effect. And We do once
more require you the Sheriffs of Our said City, and all other the Magistrates
of the same, in which all Our good Subjects of that City will assist you, that
you cause the said Isaac Pennington, Ven, Fulke, and Manwaring, to be
apprehended and committed to safe Custody, that We may proceed against them as
guilty of high Treason, and principal Authors of those Calamities which are
now so heavy upon Our poor Subjects of that City, and if not suddenly
remedied, will in a short time utterly confound a Place, and a People lately of
so flourishing an estimation in all the parts of Christendom. And whereas We
are informed that one Brown a Wood-monger, Titchborne a Linnen-Draper, and one
Harvy a Silke-man, have exercised great Insolences and outrages in that Our
City, and when many of Our good Subjects there, have assembled together in a
peaceable and modest manner, to consult about the Peace and welfare of that
City, the said mutinous and seditious Persons have presumed to lead Multitudes
of armed Men against them, and by such force have beaten, wounded, and killed
Our good Subjects; Our Will and Pleasure is, that if the said Brown,
Titchborne, and Harvy, or either of them, shall so far neglect Our gracious
offer of Pardon, as still to engage themselves in those unwarrantable and
seditious coursed, That you Our Sheriffs of London, raise power to suppress
the said force, and that you and all Our Ministers of Justice, use your utmost
means to apprehend the said Persons, and to bring them to condign punishment.
And We do hereby Declare, That it shall be lawful for any of Our loving
Subjects, to resist and oppose the said Persons, if they shall hereafter, in
such a Warlike manner, endeavor to molest them as they would do Rebels and
Traitors: And We hope that all Our good Subjects of that Our much injured
City of London, do take notice of Our Grace and Favor toward them in Our so
freely passing by and pardoning the Offenses there committed against Us, as We
have offered by Our Proclamation and Our late Answer; and of Our very earnest
desire to be with them, and to reside amongst them for their Comfort, Support,
and Protection, if they shall, by first providing for their own security (in
such manner as We have directed them in Our late Answer) give Us an instance
that We may be safe there too; And that they do likewise observe, that being
by such violence kept from them, We have done Our utmost endeavor to continue
and advance the decayed trading of that Our City, by permitting and
encouraging all resort and traffic thither, and therefore if by the stopping
of Carriages, and seizing Commodities by other men, the commerce and
correspondence be broken between that place and Our good Subjects of other
Counties, they will impute that mischief to the true Authors of it, and look
upon Us only as not able to help them. Do but your Duties, and this Cloud,
which threatens a present confusion, will quickly vanish away, and you will
enjoy all the Blessings of a happy Nation, to the which no endeavor of Ours
shall be wanting.

Given at Our Court at OXFORD, this 17 th day of JANUARY. 1642.
