Perth December. 14. 1650.
THe Commission of the General Assembly considering how grievous a sin against
God and scandal to Religion it were for any of this Kirk and Kingdom to join
or comply with any of the Sectarian Enemy, who having most injustly invaded
this Kingdom, has shed so much of the blood of Gods people, is destroying the
Land, are so wicked Enemies to the Truth of God, and work of Reformation. And
having heard, that some already have fallen into those sins: Therefore the
Commission, for removeing so grievous Scandal, ordaines, that all such, as
have, or shall join in Arms or Council with the before said Enemy, upon the
clear notice and evidence thereof, shall be excommunicate; And all such as
shall be found to have procured protections from the fore said Enemy execute
any orders from them, or given them Intelligence, or have spoken favorably of
them to the advantage of their Cause: And all such as shall be found in any
other way to comply with them, shall be censured according to the degrees of
their compliance, as others have bin censured, who have complied with other
Enemies of the Covenant and Cause of God, and the peace of this Kirk and
Kingdom: And to the effect that all persons may be made to guard and keep
themselves from being misled or carried away with any Inticement or Tentation
unto such courses, it is appointed that this Act be read in all Congregations
of this Kirk.

A. KER.
