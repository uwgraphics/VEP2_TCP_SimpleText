A TRUE DECLARATION OF The suffering of the innocent, who is hated and
persecuted without a cause.

Wherein is discovered the zeal of the Magistrates and people of BANBVRY,
persecuting and imprisoning them that are sent of the Lord in love to their
Souls to warn them of the evil of their ways.

Declared in a Letter sent to William Allen, called Justice of Peace, with an
answer to the false Accusations charged upon the Innocent.

Also their Proceedings laid open, and proved to be contrary to the SCRIPTURES.

By Anne Audland, whom the world scornfully calls QUAKER.

The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces: out of heaven shall he
thunder upon them. The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth: and he shall
give strength unto his King, and exalt the horn of his anointed, 1 Samuel 2.10.

And on my servants, and on my handmaidens, I will pour out in those days of
my spirit, and they shall prophecy, Act. 2.18.

A TRUE DECLARATION Of the suffering of the Innocent, who is hated and
persecuted without a CAUSE, etc.
WIlliam Allen, Justice of Peace so called, but little peace I find in thee;
We came to the Town of Banbu^y on the 13th. day of the 11th. month: and being
strangers, we took in at the Lion: The next day being the first day of the
week, we went to a meeting which we heard of in the Town; and when the
meeting ended, we were moved to go to the Steeple-house, to speak the word of
the Lord to Priest and People; and in obedience to the Lord, we went, and
stayed till the Priest had done, and then my friend spoke to the Priest, and
the rude multitude came and hurried her forth, as the customs of the Heathens
is; Then I spoke to the Priest, Man, here, see the fruits of thy Ministry, and
presently the rude people hurried me forth: Then came one and took me by the
hand, and questioned me, what untruths their Minister had spoken; and I
answered, That they that are out of the Doctrine of Christ, all they spoke was
untruth: And though they say, The Lord lives, surely they swear falsely, Jer.
5.2.

Then another asked me, if the Lord did not live; I answered, yea, I know he
lives. Now there are two Boys that has sworn against me, that which I did
not speak, their blood will be required of them that caused them to err; And
know this O man, that the Lord God will be avenged of all unjust Justices, and
he will make his power known in the destruction of his Enemies: Therefore fear
him, and beware of persecuting his ^^rvants, for justly shall thou be judged,
according to the deeds done in the body shall thou receive thy reward; To the
light in thy conscience do I direct thee, it will let thee see all thy actions,
and from whence they arise, whether from the spirit of meekness, or from thy
perverse will, which the Lord will judge righteously; To that in thy conscience
I speak which will witness for God against all deceit.

This was I moved to write to clear my conscience of thee, and leave thee
without excuse, that when the book of Conscience is opened, thou may
remember that thou wast forwarned in thy life time. A friend of the Truth, and
a lover of thy Soul, who is a prisoner of the Lord for the Truths ^ake at
Banbury, whose ^ame in the flesh is

WHereas I am accused in a Mittimus for certain blasphemous words, saying,
That the Lord live^h no^; I answer, these words are false, and never spoken by
me: The Lord is my Redeemer, and I know that my Redeemer lives: and my soul
magnifieth him, and my spirit rejoceth in him; and here I deny your false
accusations and blasphemy, it is your own words, and not what I said; and you
that accuse falsely, know not the living God, the Heathen knows not God, and
the Heathens rage, but the Lord will be avenged of all his enemies, and plead
the cause of the innocent: And they are blasphemers which say they are Jews,
and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. And whereas I am accused for
causing a tumult in the Church, when the Minister was going to execute part of
his Function, and likewise to assault the Minister; I answer, This is likewise
false; Liars must be cast into the lake; The Church is built of living stones,
elect and precious, and there is order kept in the Church; And I did not cause
a tumult, neither did I assault the Minister (as ye call him) and that which
is called part of his Function, is an invention; and there is neither command
nor example in all the Scripture, that ever any of the Ministers of Christ did
sprinkle Infants, and call it a Function; and here you have no Scripture to
prove your Function, as you call it: And he that practices such things, for the
which there is no Scripture, leads people into the inventions, and so they are
not profited at all, as it appears by your own words, that they were in a
tumult. O blush, and be ashamed of that which you call your Church, who are so
suddenly in a tumult! Was there ever such a thing heard of amongst the Saints,
that they would be in a tumult, when one came in peaceably among them, not
offering wrong to any? Here you show your selves to be children of your Fathers
who lived in envy, haling out of Synagogues, carrying them before Rulers, and
casting into prisons them who was called of the Lord to bear witness against
their deceit; and here (him called the Minister) is made manifest to be one
that runs before he was sent, and so never profitted the people, and so like
Priest, like People. Therefore give over, and never call it a Church, who are
fighters and strikers, scoffers and scorners, tumulters and false accusers, as
your fruits makes it daily appear; And some of you confess that they are in
danger of their lives that comes among you, the people are so rude. Now you
that are Magistrates ought to punish evil Doers, Fighters, and Liars, and
false Accusers; but such have liberty, and dare do it in your Church (as you
call it) and you present, as he that caused the Mittimus to be made does
confess; That there was a tumult when he was present, and they that tumulted
are not punished, but the fault is laid upon the innocent, who was beat and
abused, but offered violence to none: And so they said Paul was a pestilent
fellow, and they tumulted Paul, but Paul did not cause the tumult: So you are
made manifest of what generation you are, and you shall be rewarded according
to your deeds: And from the Lord I declare, That he will visit for these
things, and plead with you for all your hard speeches, and all your ungodly
deeds: and give you your portion with hypocrites, except you speedily repent;
and when you come into the pit, remember you are warned in your life time: And
so your false accusation and blasphemy I do deny, and the living God will judge
between me and you.

The Borough of Banbury in the County Oxon. Anne Audland.


THe righteous Judge of all the world is now arising to judge the world in
righteousness, and the people with equity: And every tongue shall confess
that the Lord is righteous, when he comes to judgment, and he will reward
every one according to their deeds. And every tongue shall confess the Lord is
just. For according to that in the conscience which is just and equal, will
the Lord judge, whose Judgments are just and equal; and every tongue shall
confess him just, when he takes vengeance upon the unjust: And behold the
Lord comes with ten thousands of his Saints to execute Judgment upon all,
and to convince all that are ungodly of all their ungodly deeds, which they
have ungodlily committed, and of all their hard speeches, which ungodly sinners
have spoken: And such are they that walk after their own lusts, and their mouth
speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration, because of
advantage, such will the Lord execute judgment upon in righteousness: All you
that are ungodly, the Lord will reward you according to your deeds; And all you
that utter hard speeches against the holy one, and blaspheme God in his Temple,
the Lord is coming with his Saints to execute judgment upon you; and you shall
confess his Judgments is just, that which convinces you of your ungodly
deeds, and hard speeches, by it you shall confess the Lord is just, when you
are judged for your ungodly deeds, and hard speeches; And all you that have
men's persons in admiration because of advantage, you shall be judged
righteously, and you shall confess that God is just, and his ways equal, and
God respects no man's person; nor the Saints who comes with him to judgment,
respects no man's person; for he that respects persons commits sin, and is
convinced to be a transgressor of the righteous law of God; but they who are
guided by that which convinces the transgressor, they are kept out of the
transgression, and they do not admire men's persons, nor respect men's persons.
But you that do, are convinced to be transgressors; and according to that which
convinces, will you be judged by the righteous Judge, who comes with ten
thousands of his Saints, and he will judge all you that respects persons; for
the Lord regards the rich no more then the poor; but this is he that the Lord
regards, who is of a humble and contrite spirit, and trembles at his word.
Such you do not regard, who are poor, and trembles at the word of the Lord:
but you that respect persons, scoffs at such as they go along the streets; But
the Lord will plead the cause of the poor, who is now despised amongst you
that respects persons: you admire some men's persons because of advantage, and
ye despise others, and persecutes the poor, and goes about to make one an
offender for a word which is none indeed; and you set a snare for them that
reprove in the gate, that so you might catch the innocent, and they that are
offenders indeed, who can lie, and swear, and accuse falsely; such have liberty,
and such are set to ensnare the innocent, and to be as judges against the
innocent, and yet you profess your selves Christians; Oh that you were wise! oh
that you would consider your latter end! how will you stand before the Ju^gment
fear of God, in the day when the secrets of every heart shall he judged by
Jesus Christ, who has all judgment committed to him: And behold he comes, and
all the Saints with him, and he rules and reigns in his Saints, and sits upon
his Throne: But how will you stand at that day, who now sits as Judges upon the
Saints, and calls them deceivers, and persecutes them, who are made free by the
Son of God, and in obedience to him suffers the loss of all things, and are
killed all the day long, and are accounted as sheep for the slaughter^; and are
become a reproach, and a byword, and a scorn, even among you that profess
your selves Christians, and so the Scripture is fulfilled, They that work
wickedness are set up, and they that depart from iniquity becomes a prey to
the wicked; and the sufferings of the Saints is become a sport amongst you; and
you can stretch your selves upon your beds of ease; and you do not remember the
affliction of Joseph; nor you have not known, that all who live godly in
Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; And says Christ, As they have done unto
me, so will they do unto you: And the servant is not greater then his Lord.

Now if you were Christians as you profess your selves to be, then would
persecution cease, and not be found amongst you; for Christians does not
persecute, but you that live in such things, are made manifest (to all the
children of light) whose servants you are; and you that are Magistrates, who
should punish evil doers, such have liberty in the streets to scoff and
scorn, to swear and lie, and be drunk, and you pass by these things; but if
any come amongst you to declare the word of the Lord against such things, then
the innocent are accused by them who live in such things, and the innocent are
persecuted and sent to Prison; and may not know from you who prisons them, what
they are accused of; nor see their accusers face to face; is this according to
the Law of God? or is this as you would be done unto? Consider of it, and lay
it to heart, for the Lord will visit for these things; I speak what I know, and
find amongst you; for I was accused and committed to Prison, but I did not
know what the accusers swore against me, neither could I see my accusers: but
you took an o^th in secret, and so I was accused, and committed for that which
I never spoke, and had not liberty to answer for my self, nor others had no
liberty, nor could be heard on my behalf, who was by when they say I spoke
these words, for which I am accused, which would bear testimony that they heard
no such things spoken by me, as I am accused off, and so the innocent suffers
innocently; and in the mean time wickedness is at liberty, and not only in a
corner, but in your streets; men lie, and swear, and are drunk, and the
innocent is a prey unto them; and yet you do not lay it to heart; woe is me for
you, that you should so slight the day of your visitation, and so wickedly
requite the Lord for all his goodness; as to persecute his servants, who are
sent to warn you; and despise h^s witnesses, and shamefully entreat his
messengers, and them that comes to you in their own names, such you receive;
but them that come to you in the name of the Lord, such are a reproach amongst
you; and the Lord is highly displeased with you for these things; and he will
make enquiry for blood; you know that the blood of the innocent has been shed
in your streets; one that came amongst you and offered violence to none, was
beat and abused, and lost much blood amongst you: and yet you are not ashamed
to profess your selves Christians, when as these actions proceeds from you;
and your care is how to wound the innocent secretly, that so your deeds might
not be brought to the light; but it is in vain for you to dig deep to hide
your council from the Lord; Woe unto you that devises to work mischeife in
the dark, and say, who sees us; and consults together to shoot your arrows
secertly against the poor. The Lord sees you, and knows your hearts, and your
very thoughts which you think against the King in your bed chamber; there is a
bird of the ^ire that carries the voice; And the Lord will bring every work to
judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil; and the oath in
secret shall be tried; and the Lord will sit as Judge amongst the Judges, and
you shall all be weighed and those of you that a^e found wanting, the Lord will
cast you by, though you be as high and mighty as Belshazzar was: and if you be
angry with me for telling you so, and forewarning you in your life time; the
Lord will judge you for it; for he is tender over his little ones; and in as
much as you persecute one of them, ye do it unto him; and you that imp^ison the
innocent, and they may not see their accusers, is this according to the Law of
God? or is this to judge for God, and not for man, nor self ends, without
respect of persons? They that were set over the people to judge them according
to the Law of God, were just men fearing God, and hating coveteousnesse: just
men we^e to judge the unjust; for the unjust cannot judge true judgment: See
what charge Jeh^shaphat gave unto them he set over the people, 2 Chronicles. 19.6,
7, 9. Saying to the Judges, take heed what you do, for you judge not for man
but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: wherefore now let the fear
of the Lord be upon you, and take heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with
the Lord our God: nor respect of persons, not taking of gifts: And he charged
them saying, thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord faithfully and with a
perfect heart: Now all you that denies a perfect heart, and are respecters of
persons, you cannot judge with a perfect heart; and such are not judges for
God, who judges not not with a perfect heart, but are respecters of persons;
but they who fear God, and do faithfully with a perfect heart, such Judges, and
Magistrates I own who are just men; such rules for God, and is a terror to the
wicked, and for the praise of them that do well; and such am subject to for
conscience sake; but they who were the servants of Christ, and Ministers of
Christ, when they were commanded by the rulers that which was contrary to the
command of Christ; they said whether is it better to obey God or man: judge ye,
and I say the same, and they which command any thing contrary to ^he command of
Christ, which rules and reigns in his people, and is one in the male and in the
female; such are not just men fearing God and judging faithfully with a perfect
heart; and such who do not fear God and have not a perfect heart, such knows
not the voice of God; but Christ's sheep who follow Christ, and are sent of God
knows his voice: Now Magistrates and people will say, how may we know that you
are sent of God? as Pharaoh said to Moses, who sent thee? and he answered, the
Lord sent me, to bid thee let Israel go free; and Pharaoh said, I know not the
Lord, neither will I obey him, and let Israel go free; such are they who fear
not God, nor know not his voice; and such cannot discern the things of God,
Magistrates nor people who fear not God, and have not a perfect heart: now
consider if you judge me according to the Law of God, when you heard all that
was against me and did accuse me, but would not hear the accused and the
accusers face to face, nor those that was by, who would have witnessed against
those untruths charged upon me, but put them forth and said, what have you to
do here; notwithstanding, they said they came to bear witness to the truth:
see how Moses charged the Judges, Deuteronomy. 1.16, 17. saying, Hear the cause
between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother,
and the stranger that is with him; ye shall not respect persons in judgment,
but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
face of man; for the judgment is Gods: and Deuteronomy. 16.18, 19, 20. The Judges and
Officers was to judge the people with just judgment; thou shall not wrest
judgment; thou shall not respect persons; neither take a gift, for a gift does
blind the eye of the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous; that which
is altogether just shall thou follow, that thou may live and inherit the
Land which the Lord thy God gives thee; now this is true Judgment, and takes
hold upon the unjust; but here you do not act according to the Law of God, who
does respect persons, and does not hear the small as well as the great, which
you have not done who have committed me to Prison; and I had not liberty to
speak face to face with my accusers, and so I am falsely accused, and imprisoned
upon a false accusation, he that knows all secrets is my witness; and he will
plead my cause, and he will judge righteous judgment upon all the Heathen; and
the Lord comes with his Saints; and this honor have all the Saints; to execute
upon the Heathen all the judgments written; but the Heathen ought not to Judge
the Saints; but the heathen rages, and the heathen persecutes and prisons, and
falsely accuses the Saints, and the viols of wrath is now to be poured out upon
the wicked; and the Saints shall take the kingdom and rejoice in God for ever
and ever, which gives them victory over the world, and gives them strength to
rejoice in tribulation; praises to the living God for evermore. And so I warn
you all people, Magistrates, and Teachers, to fear the Lord God, least his
wrath and indignation break forth against you, and the decree be sealed, and he
take you away with his grievous stroke, and there be no remedy; for God is my
witness that my desire is for you; that you may know the things that belongs
to your peace; so to you all I have cleared my conscience, and I am free from
your blood, glory to the Lord for evermore, who has given me to believe and
suffer for the testimony of Jesus; so I remain a witness for the truth, and a
prisoner in bonds at Banbury for the truths sake, who am innocent; but falsely
accused, and slandered, and reproached; but the reproaches for Christ, is my
riches: whose name in the flesh is,
