At a Court held by the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor President, and the rest
of the Governors of the Corporation for the Poor of London, the 6th of
February, 1655.
WHereas the Governors of the Corporation for the Poor of London, have from
year to year given public notice of their having a Stock of Flax, Hemp, and
Tow, at either of their Workhouses, to employ the Poor within this City and
Liberties thereof; And for some years together did employ about one thousand
Poor at Work, besides the Poor Children that are Educated by the said
Corporation in Learning and Arts; Yet nevertheless there are many Vagrants and
Common Beggars which continually frequent the Streets of this City, and refuse
to receive or undertake any lawful work, or employment, to the Scandal of the
Government of this City, and the profession of Religion. For Prevention
whereof, It has pleased the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor of this City
President of this Corporation, lately to issue his Lordships Precepts to all
the Constables of this City, requiring them diligently to prosecute the Laws of
this Nation against Vagrants and Common Beggars, and has also given them a
Breviate of the Statutes in force, the better to inform them of their
respective duties, and of the penalties which they and others concerned must
sustain, if they shall not pursue the said directions; In the further
persuance whereof his Lordship and the rest of the Governors of the said
Corporation, (by and with the advice of the Treasurers and others, Governors of
the several Hospitalls of this City) have resolved to give each other their
best Assistance for the Vigorous and Constant carrying on of the same.

And to this end have appointed a Competent number of able men under a Sallary,
to spend their whole time in their respective appointed divisions, to be
Assisting to the Constables of this City, in the apprehending of all sorts of
Beggars, to the end that such of the Poor belonging to this City, as will Work,
may be sent to the Workhouses (at the Mynories and the Wardrobe) belonging to
the said Corporation, there being a Stock of Hemp, Flax, and Tow, in readiness
to employ them: And that the rest may be sent to the house of Correction, or be
passed away according to the directions inserted in his Lordships Precepts.

And to the end the broken Bread and Meat within this City (which has usually
been distributed to the aforesaid Common Beggars) may not be lost: It is
thought meet (respect being had to the several Prisons within this City) that
such Basketmen as shall be judged convenient, being recommended by the
Churchwardens or Overseers of the out-Parishes, shall be allowed to Gather and
Receive the said broken Bread and Meat in such places as shall be assigned to
them, to be distributed to such of the poorest sort of people, as the said
Churchwardens and Overseers shall appoint to receive the same, they giving a
Badge of distinguishment to such as they shall judge meet for that service.

Toward the more Effectual carrying on of which good work, his Lordship with
the rest of the Governors of the said Corporation, do earnestly desire the
Ministers of the Gospel within this City and Liberties thereof, to publish the
same, together with the heads of the Statutes inserted in his Lordships Precept
hereunto Annexed, the next Lords day in their respective Congregations: And to
stir up all good people to be cheerfully active (in their several duties)
for the encouragement of the great work under the management of the said
Corporation, And more especially to implore the blessing of God and his
gracious Assistance in and upon their endeavors.

Signed by the Appointment of the said Corporation; By William Haslope Clerk to
the said Corporation.
