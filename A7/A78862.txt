HIS MAJESTY'S LETTER TO THE LORD KEEPER OF THE GREAT SEAL OF ENGLAND:
Concerning Sir Edward Herbert Knight, and the Five Members of the House of
Commons, Read in both Houses the 9th of March. 1641.
CHARLES REX,
RIght trusty and welbeloved Councellor, We greet you well,
and have thought good hereby to certify that we did the third of January
last, deliver to Our Attorney certain Articles of Accusation ingrosed in
paper, a Coppie whereof We have sent here enclosed, and did then command him
in Our Name, to acquainte Our House of Peers, that diverse great and
Treasonable designs and practices against us and the State had come to Our
knowledge; for which We commanded him, in Our Name, to accuse the six persons
in the said paper mentioned of High Treason, and other high misdemeanors by
delivering the paper to Our said House, and to desire to have it read, and
further to desire in Our name, that a Select Committee of Lords, might be
appointed to take the examinations of such witnesses as We would produce, and
as formerly had been done in cases of like Nature, according to the Justice of
the house, and the Commit to be und racommand of secrecy as formerly, and
further in Our Name to ask liberty to add and alter if there should be cause,
according to Justice: and likewise to desire that Our said House of Peers
would take care of the securing of the said persons, as in Justice there should
be cause: We do further declare that Our said Attorney, did not advise or
contrive the said Articles, nor had any thing to do with, or in advising any
breach of Privilege that followed after, And for what he did in obedience to
Our commands, We conceive he was bound by oath, and the duty of his place, and
by the trust, by Us reposed in him so to do: And had he refused to obey Us
therein, We would have questioned him for breach of oath, duty, and Trust.

But now having declared, that we find cause wholly to desist from proceeding
against the persons accused, We have commanded him to proceed no further
therein, nor to produce nor discover any proof concerning the same.

Given at Royston, the Fourth of March. 1641.
