THE BROWNISTS FAITH AND BELIEF OPENED.
SOme that pretend most Faith, have least, who say,
That their Belief is pure, yet will not pray
I believe
This illegitimate Sect is neither just
In their own way, nor will impose their trust
In God,
A Spirit, which can guide them, they have got,
They Will grant no other conduct, who know not
The Father Almighty
They Will make a Chaos of the Church, to see,
(Their errors being composed) whether he be
Maker of Heaven
Thus they tempt their Creator, and dare say,
They are more holy, and not made of Clay,
And Earth,
They are inspired from Heaven, and thus they flout
The holy Scriptures, and with it play both out
and in
They Will grant no worship to our Lord, nor show
Any (though decent) reverence unto
Jesus
They will derive their names from Brown and Tom,
Nor do they so care to extract it from
Christ
Pluto laughs at them, promising that he
Who will persist thus in that way, shall be
his only son
But (O!) illuminate their errors now
Father of Heaven, and Earth, and still be thou
our Lord,
What is not theirs, is Romes, and popish dross,
Hence came the tumult about Cheapside Cross
which was
Thus is our Church condemned without hope
To be reformed, for 'twas (they say) byth' Pope
conceived
They Have bin so long from Church, that they have forgot,
But barnes and stables sure conceived were not
by the Holy Ghost,
They hate the nomination of Mass,
Nor will they observe the rules of him that was
borne of he Virgin
They Will have no Brothers name be called Dave
Nor Sisters Mal, cause of the Romish Ave
Mary,
They Are charitable, the naked they will see
Covered, and none (unless a Sister) now shall be
suffered under
Some will reforms religion, and some
To crucify Christ's Church, would even become
Pontius Pilate,
Some preach in tubs, that scarce become a chair,
The Bishops primacie in Lambeth Fair
was crucified,
The public Liturgy is condemned by most,
The Book of Common prayer is almost
dead and buried,
When Prophet Hunt did in the Gallery prate,
In Christ Church, and sent to Counter gate,
he descended
These Amsterdamian tunes which they do sing
In Conventicles, will them shortly bring
into hell,
When Spencer preached, and did his word fulfill,
He in his text continued until
the third day
When Hunt came from the Counter, went again
To the Old Exchange, and Westminster, O then
he rose again
These speak by inspiration, and are wise,
Their Doctrin's dull, as if it did arise
from the dead,
When How rose from his Cobblers bulk, and teacht
His fond opinions in the Pulpit preached,
he ascended
Those that will thus their souls health rashly venture,
To rob abused Levi, shall not enter
into heaven,
They are as fierce as Hercules with his Club,
The chief among them's placed in a tub,
and there he sits
At the left hand there sits a holy mother,
And there is likewise placed a purer brother
at the right hand
Thus are their new assemblies all abhorred,
And thus they do profane the facred word
of God,
We live and move by him that sits on high,
Whom I acknowledge seriously to be
the Father Almighty,
Marler for preaching a Brownisticke text,
Was sent toth' Gatehouse, and to Tyburne next,
from thence he shall come,
But stay disturbers of the time, I know
Your manners, but who authorized you
to Indge
Retract your foolish rage, I humbly crave,
Do not proceed to censure and deprave
both the quick and the dead
Why do you nourish th'Amsterdamian brat,
For ^loe) it is not your sect confusive that
I believe in
Thou Brownianisme that our religion mainst,
Thou often do protect the sin against
the holy Ghost,
He that can teach five hours inspired from high,
Denying Common Prayer Book shall be
the holy
Most words of popish Monuments are framed,
Religions Romish too, if it be named
Catholic
A Church to them's Apocrypha, a tree,
A Bame, or Stable they esteem to be'
Church
When the brethren, sisters, and brownistick Elves
Do meet together, they then call themselves
The Communion of Saints
They Will not confess, nor yet absolve, they will be
Competitors for the truth, and so deny
the forgivenes of sins
When they should exercise their talent, and do move
By the Spirit to a sister, oh then they love
the resurrection of the body,
Since they such obscure places will inherit,
Denying all good works, they cannot merit
the life everlasting.
And since they are led by the Spirit, oh then withal,
May th'Spirit lead them unto Tyburne all.
Amen.
