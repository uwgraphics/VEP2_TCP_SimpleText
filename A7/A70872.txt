ROCKS IMPROVED, COMPRISING CERTAIN POETICAL MEDITATIONS, Extracted from the
contemplation of the Nature and Quality of ROCKS; a barren and harsh Soil;
yet a Fruitful, and Delightful subject of Meditation. By WILLIAM PRYNNE,
late Exile, and close Prisoner in Mount-Orgueil Castle in the Isle of Iersy.

Psalm. 18. 2. 31. 46. 2 Samuel 22. 2. 3. 32. The Lord is my Rock and my
Fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my strength in whom I will trust, my
buckler, and the horn of my Salvation, and my high Tower my Savior, thou
savest me from violence. Who is a Rock save our God? The Lord lives, and
blessed be my Rock, and let the God of my Salvation be exalted. Psalm. 40. 1,
2, 3. I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my
cry: He brought me also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set
my feet upon a Rock, and established my goings, etc. London, Printed by T.
Cotes for Michael Spacke, dwelling at the blue Bible in Green A^bor 1641.

These Meditations, which did first arise
Within those walls, which your bright virtues grace,
And fitted were for that Mount Orgueil.

The Poem's like the Subject, barren, rude,
Vncompt, yet wholesome to an heart renu'd:
Your kind acceptance will it crown, and raise
Above its worth, and be the Poets Bayrs

Remained close Prisoner, Exile in Jerse.
Sequestered from all friends access, shall rest

ROCKS IMPROVED. Comprising certain Poetical Meditations, extracted from the
contemplation of the Nature and Qualities of Rocks; a Barren and Harsh Soil,
yet a Fruitful and Delightful Subject of Meditation.
THE PROEME.
WHen from the lofty Mount-Orguil.
Castle I epsy
The ragged Rocks, which round about it lie;
My Working thoughts begin from thence to raise
Some Psalm. 77. 12. Psalm. 19. 14. Psalm. 143. 5. Psalm 104. 34.
Meditations, to their Makers Praise,
And mine own Profit: which my heart may warm,
Yea mount to Heaven, and vain fancies charm.
Meditations of the first Rank, Parallelling Christ and Rocks together.
ANd first, the Rocks do lively represent
A complete Image, full of sweet content,
Of Christ our Rock; since that both They and He
In Name and Nature fitly do agree.
Are they called Rocks? So he in sacred Writ
A 1 Cor. 10 4. Psalm. 18. 2. 31. 46. Ps. 28. 1 Ps. 21. 3. Psa. 42. 4. Ps. 62.
2. 7. Psalm. 71. 3. Ps. 89. 26. Psalm. 92. 15. Ps. 94. 22. Psalm. 95. 1. Deuteronomy. 32.
31. 2 Samuel 22. 2. 3. 32. 47.
Rock is styled, in these regards most fit.
1.
The Stony Rocks no other Father know
But God who made them, from whose Psalm. 148. 5. Ioh. 3. 3.
word they flow
So Christ (both God and Man) no Father knows
But Ioh. 5. 17. 18. Ioh. 8. 16. 18. 19. 28. 38. 41. 49. 54.
God eternal; from whose Loins he flows

Men's shallow Thoughts, and in them wonder breeds.
2.
Rocks are the Mat. 7. 24. 25. Luke 6. 47. 48.
firmest ground whereon to lay,
And found such buildings as shall not decay.
But last and stand in spite of Floods, Storms, wind,
Which may beat on them, yet no entrance find,
So Isa. 28. 16. Mat. 16. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Psalm. 118 22. Act. 4.
11. 1 Co. 3. 11. Ephesians. 2. 20 21.
Christ's the only Rock, the tried stone
On which the Church is built: On Him alone
Our Souls so safe, fast, firmly, founded lie,
That they shall stand for all eternity
Unshaken, undemolisht, maugre all
The Mat. 7. ^4. 25. c. 16. 18. Romans 8. 35. to 39. 2 Pet. 1. 10. Psalm. 125. 1.
2 Cor. 4. 7, 8, 9. 1 Cor. 10. 13.
Storms, Flands, Winds, that on them beat and fall
Through Men or Devils Malice: Happy they
Who on this firm Rock, all their buildings lay.
3.
Rocks yield the sweetest Psalm. 81. 16. Deuteronomy. 32. 13.
Honey, Men to feed:
The 2 Cor. 1. 3. 4, 5, 6. Psalm. 71. 21. Cant. 2. 5. Isa. 40. 1. c. 51. 3. c.

From Christour Rock, Men's drooping souls to cheer
And sweeten all sour Crosses which they hear.

The first, in Man's eyes are a lovely sight;
The last in Gods eyes makes us shine most bright.
O let us then, these Jewels only prise,
Which make us Ezech. 16. 8. 10 15. Cant. 2. 1, 2. c. 4. 1. 2. etc. c. 5. 1. to

5.
The richest Mines of Silver, Gold, Tin, Lead,
Brass, Copper, in the wombes of Deuteronomy. 8. 9. Job. 28. 2.
Rocks are bred:
Whence not dug out with pains, they useless lie
And none are bettered, or enricht thereby.
Thus all the Mines, and Treasures of Gods Grace
Are Col. 2. 2. 3. 9. Ioh. 1. 15. 16 Ephesians. 3. 8. 18. 19.

Yet none do happy, rich, or wealthy grow
By these hid Treasures, though they overflow;
But those who take much Prove. 2. 3, 4, 5 Mat. 13, 44, 45. 46. Rev. 3 18. c.

With Prayers, Tears, Faith, Hope, and Patience.
O let us then be ever drawing Oar
Out of our Rock Christ, in whom there is such store
Of richest golden Mines, that all Rev. 3. 18. c. 22. 17. Is. 55. 1. 2. 3 Ioh.

May there their Souls, and Bags for ever fill.
6.
The purest, best, and pleasantst waters spring
Out of Deuteronomy. 8. 15 Psalm. 105. 41. Psa. 114. 8. Isa. 48. 21. Ps. 1^4. 10, 11,
12, 13.

To Man and Beast, whose Thirst they quench and stay,
Their bodies bathe, and wash their filth away.

Whence streams of waters gushed to redress,
And quench the Peoples Thirst, when Moses Rod
It smote, and pierced by command from God.
(Yea every Rock whence Cristall waters spring)
A lively 1 Cor. 10. 4.
Picture was, and is to bring
Our Rock Christ to our Minds, and to present
Him to our eyes, and Hearts with great content:
From whose pierced Hands and side with Nails and Spear,

Let Papists then behold their painted sticks;

Him whiles they view Him but with carnal Eyes.
And yet as Rocks, though ragged, vile and bare
In outward form, contain within them rare
And precious Jewels, Stones, Mines, of all Kinds;
So though our Rock, Christ, unto carnal Minds

Those Rocks they held before in such disgrace,
As the most strong, sweet, best, and safest place.
So, most this Rock Christ quite Isa. 53. 3. Psalm. 118. 22. Act. 4. 11. Mar.

extremities
Enforce them to Him, to protect and free.
Them from the Evils which they fear and flee.
And then no place so sweet, safe, delicate
As this our Rock before left desolate.
But yet as those who unto Rocks do fly,
Not out of love, but mere necessity,

Depart from Him, and will no longer stay,

22.
Rocks humble are, and never upwards tend,
Mount, swell, but Exodus 15. 5. Nah. 1. 6.
down their Heads and Motions bend.
So Christ our Rock, did Mat. 11. 29 Phil. 2. 5. 6. 7. 8. Joh. 6. 15. 16. Ephesians.
4. 9. Heb. 2. 7. 9. Zech. 9. 9.
humble and abase
Himself, but never sought high state or Place;
Moving from Heaven down to Earth below,
To quench all Pride, and make men humble grow.
Who then dares swell with Pride, or Haughtiness
When Christ, Himself did thus so low depresse;
Though Phil. 2. 5. 6. 7. 8. 1. Tim. 6. 15. Rev. 17. 14. c. 19. 6. Deuteronomy. 10. 17.
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, most High,
Nay second Person in the Deity?
23.
High Rocks a pleasant Number. 23. 9. Job. 39. 28. 29.
Prospect yield, whence Men
Sea, Land, nay Heaven may the better Ken.
And with delight see farther, and far more
Than they on lower ground beheld before.
Thus men high mounted on our Rock, Christ, view
From thence, with most delight, such 2 Cor. 5. 16. 17. 18. 1 Cor. 2. 7. to 16.

pleasant, new
And glorious Sights of God, and things above
As rap their souls, and make them sick of Love.
Thence they behold all Earthly things below
With other Eyes, and both discern and know
Them to be vile, base Eccles. 1. 2. 14. 1. Ioh. 2. 15. 16. 17. Phil. 3. 7. 8,
9. Prove. 23. 4, 5.
Dross, mere vanity;
And very small when viewed thus from on high.
24.
When Pro. 30. 19.
Serpents upon Rocks do creep or glide
They leave no tract, way, steps, that can be spide.
When that old Serpent Satan crept upon
Our Rock Christ, with his strong Temptation,
He Mat. 4. 1. to 10. Lu. 4. 1. to. 10. Ioh. 14. 30. Heb. 4. 15.
naught prevailed, and no print, step, trace,
Of him or his Assaults on Him took place.
25.
When Christ our Rock for forty days and nights
Hid fasted, then the Devil Him incites
To Mat. 4. 2. 3. 4. Luke 4. 2. 3. 4.
turn stones into Bread, Himself to feed;
Which He denide, though then he bread did need:
Yet of his tender Mercy to Mankind,
And their poor souls, which are with hunger pinde,
He daily turns a Rock (Himself) to Joh. 6. 32. to 64.
Bread
Of life, wherewith their hungry Souls are fed.
Yea, rather than his chosen, Bread shall need,
The Rocks and Stones their Souls shall fat and feed,
Nay feast with those sweet wafers, which their Mind,
By Psalm. 77. 12. Ps. 143. 5.
Meditations does within them find.
Let then our Hearts be right, we need not fear
A Psalm. 34. 9. 10. Psa. 37: 25. 1 King. 17. 6: 7: 11: 12* 13:
want of Bread, Food, them to feed, feast, cheer,
Since every Rock and Ston's a Magazine
To feed, store, feast them still with Bread Divine.
26.
When God himself of his abundant Grace
Showed forth his glorious Presence, and blessed Face
To Moses and Elias; he them placed
In Exodus 33. 21. 22. 23. 1 King. 19. 9. to 16.
Clifts or Caves of Rocks, and there them graced
With this grand Honor, Him to view. When we
Gods sweetest Mat. 3. 17. Joh. 1. 18. c. 6. 46. c. 14. 7. 9.
Face and Presence long to see,
Our Souls to ravish; we must stand, and hide
Within the Clifts of our Rock, Christ's pierced side
(Which these Rocks do but 1 Cor. 10. 4.
figure,) the sole place
Wherein we may with Comfort view Gods face.
O let our Souls in these Clifts dwell and stay,
Where God his Joh. 14. 7. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 19. 20.
Face and presence does display,
In such sweet manner, and such lively sort,
As will our Souls with Love and Joy transport.

Rough ragged Rocks and Stones, cause Men to Isa. 8. 14. 15 Luke 2. 34. To. 9.

fall
And stumble on them; yea, often times withal,
Themselves to bruise, maime, break, and hurt so sore,
That they expire therewith, and rise no more;
Thus Christ becomes to many a wicked one
A Isa. 8. 14. 15. Luk 2. 34 Romans 9. 33. 1 Pet. 2. 8.
Rock effensive, and a stumbling stone
Who on Him stumble, slip, and headlong fall,
And dash themselves in pieces therewithal.
O then beware how we against Him hit
Spurn, stumble, who to Luke 2. 34. Mat. 21. 44.
shivers will us split.
28.
Some Deuteronomy. 32. 13. Joh. 29. 6.
Rocks of flint yield softest oil, to swage,
And supple hardest swellings, when they rage.
Heal wounds, and Ulcers; supplest Oils of Grace,
Which Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26.
soften hard Hearts in a little space;
Mat. 11. 28 Psalm. 41. 4. Mal. 4. 2. Rev. 22. 2.
Assuage our Pain, our Aches, wounds, sores cure,
Proceed from Christ, a Rock most firm and sure.
Lord give us store of this soft Oil, that we
Our Hearts made soft, our wounds quite healed may see.
29.
The Mines and Treasures which in Rocks hid lie,
Isa. 2. Z.
Exceed Man's search and full discovery.
The Sacred hidden Treasures which do dwell
In Christ our Rock, are so Ephesians. 3. 8. 10. 19. 20. 1 Cor. 2. 9 Col. 2. 3. 9.
c. 1. 19.
unsearchable;
Vast, boundless, endless, that they far exceed
Saints largest thoughts and in them wonder breed.
O let us still contemplate more and more
The Ephesians. 3. 18. 19. Psalm. 62. 2. 6. 7. Psalm. 73. 25.
height, depth, length, breadth, of this searchlesse store.
To fill our Souls with sweetest joys, and make
Them for the Love of these, all else forsake.
30.
Rocks are most Patient and do not Joh 6. 12. Jer. 23. 29.
complain
Cry, stir, though Tempests, Seas, Winds, Axes, Rain,
Nay Sledges beat upon them, and them bruise,
Break, hew, cleave, pierce, cut, lance, and much misuse.
So Christ our Rock, endured Isa. 53. 7. Mat. 26. 63. c. 27. 12. Act. 8. 32. 2
Pet. 2. 23. Heb. 12. 2. Rev. 19.
patiently,
His Cross, wrongs, sufferings, Death without all cry,
Complainte, resistance; like a Sheep before
Her shearer, which does never bleate, stir, roar.
O let all Christians now at last from 1 Pet. 2. 19. to 25. Rev. 12. 12. Romans
13. 10. Jam. 1. 3. 4.
hence
Learn to bear crosses with like Patience.
31.
The Mat. 7. 25. Luke 6. 47. 48.
Floods, winds, storms against the Rocks often beat;
They still exposed are to Cold, or Heat:
Sometimes the Seas surround and drown them quite
And often the ye and snow them hide from sight:
So Christ on earth 1 Pet. 2. 12. 23. Heb. 2. 9. 10. 18. c. 4. 15. c. 12. 2.
Matthew. 4, 2. to 10. c. 27. and 28. Mat 15. and 16. Luke 23. and 24. Act. 2. 23.
to 37. c. 3. 13. to to 22. c. 4. 26. 27. 28.
assaulted was with winds;
Floodes, Tempests, Heat, Cold, Crosses of all Kinds,
Which for a time did hide, immerge, at last,
Quite over-whelme Him, till the Storm was past.
What Christian then can think himself Joh. 15. 20. Mat. 10. 22. 23. 24. 25.
secure
From Storms, Winds, Floods, since Christ did them endure?
32.
When Christ gave up the Ghost, the ( Mat. 27. 51
Rocks did rent,
The Death of this chief Rock for to lament:
Yea, to bear witness of his Deity,
Who though he died, made 1 King. 19 11. Nah. 16.
Rocks in pi^^es fly.
That Heart is harder, worse than Rock or Stone,
Which Christ's Death cannot rent, nor cause to moan.
Yea every Ezech. 22. 14. c. 36. 26. c. 11. 19. Luke 24. 32. Isa. 13. 7. Ezech.
21. 7. Jer. 23. 29.
Rockie Heart must melt, (...), fall
In pieces, when Christ shall it shake, smite, call
By his Almighty Hand, or voice which make
The hardest 1 King 19. 11. Josh. 2. 11. Amos. 9. 13. Nah. 15. 6.
Rocks and Hearts to melt, split, shake.
Lord let the Thoughts of thy Death quite relent
Our Rockie Hearts, and move them to repent.
33.
Rocks Job. 6. 12. c. 14. 24.
seldom rot, corrupt, or putrify:
Act. 2. 24. 31. c. 13. 34. 35. 36. 37. Psalm. 16. 10.
Christ rotted not, whilst he in Grave did lie;
That so he might our rotten Corpse thence 1 Cor. 15. 42. 43. 52. 53. 54. 55.
56. Phi. 3. 21.
raise
Free from corruption, Him for aye to praise.
O fear not then, though we return to dust,
Christ at the last Romans 6. 9. 10. 1 Cor. 15. 42. 43. 52. to 57.
will scour off all our Rust,
Dross, and Corruption; and our Corpse restore
To such a State, that it shall dye no more;
But live in endless Glory, and excel
The Joh. 13. 2. Phil. 3. 21. Mat. 13. 43. Dan. 12. 3.
shining Rays, which in Stars, Moon, Sun, dwell.
34.
Rocks though they drowned be, appear again,
And fixed in their Places still remain:
So Christ, though Dead, and laid in Grave, arose
Again the Mar. 26. 6. 7. Mar. 16. 6. 1 Cor. 15. 4. 5. 6. 12. to 23.
third day, yea to Heaven up goes,
Above the reach of Floodes; where he on high
Has fixed his Throne for all Heb. 1. 8. 12. Psalm. 145. 13. 2 Pet. 1. 11.

Here shall this ever-living raised Rock
For ever Rev. 22. 5.
reign amidst his chosen Flock.
35.
Our Rock Christ being dead entombed lay
Within a Mar. 15. 46. 47. Mat. 27. 60. Luke 23. 53.
Rock; where He grim death did slay.
We, Dust and Earth, when dead, to Genesis 3. 19. Eccles. 3. 10.
them return:
But our dead Rock, a Rock had for his Vrne,
Which Him received, and harbor'd even when,
He Slain, and quite Isa. 53. 3. 14 c. 4. 11.
rejected was by Men.
O Rocks of Flesh, and Bowels, which first Mat. 27. 51.
rent
Themselves, His bloody Passion to Lament!
And then Him in their Bosoms lodge, and placed,
When men Him slew, forsook, and most disgraced!
O men (more Jer. 5. 3. Ezech. 3. 5.
hard than any Rock, Flint, Stone,
Who never, pity, feel, regard, bemoane
Christ's cruel Death and Passion; nor receive
Him, when the Rocks rent, and Him House-roome give!
O let us learn from hence, how hard, unkind,
Ingrate we are to Him, who still shall Joh. 1. 10. 11. Mat. 8. 20. Luke 9. 58.
Job 24. 7. 8.
find
More pity, harbor, love, from Rocks than we,
Until our Hearts by Grace relented be.
And let this Thought our Hearts of Rock now thaw,
And Floods of bitter Tears out from them draw.
36.
In fine; when we consider that Mar. 15. 46. 47. c. 16. 1. 2. 3. Mat. 27. 60.

Christ lay
Intombed in a Rock; yet the third day
Rose up from thence: it makes each Hole and Cave
We see in Rocks, no other but a Grave:
And points us out the Job. 17. 1. 13. Psalm. 88. 3. 5.
Place where we must lie
Interred, ere long, and fits us still to 2 Timothy 4. 6. 7. 8. 1 Cor. 15. 31.
dye;
Which done, it then revives our souls again
With this sweet Thought, that we Psalm. 19. 9. 1^ Act. 2. 32. c. 13. 33. 1 Cor.
15. 1 These. 4. 14. to 18. 2 Cor. 4. 14. Romans 8. 11.

In Gr^ve for ever; since our Savior rose
From thence again, to raise us, and all those
Who are his Members, from the Dust, to Rev. 22. 5.
reign
In endless Bliss, where he does now remain.
Let these sweet Speculations ever cheer
Our drooping Souls, and banish all their Fear.
Thus Barren Rocks unto a pious Mind
May fruitful prove, it it 1 Cor. 10. 4.
Christ in them find;
When they in Name and Nature thus express
Unto the life, with Fruit and Pleasantness;
Far better than all Pictures which the Blind,
Dull Papists make, to bring them to their Mind,
As if His 1 Cor. 11. 25. 26. 29. Gal. 3. 1. 1 Cor 2. 2. Romans 1. 19. 2^.

The only Rock, where they full safe shall be.
Meditations of the second Kind, comparing Rocks and Sins together.
Again, Me thinks, the Rocks do typifie, the nature of those Sins which
in us lie.

1.
For first, all Rocks exceeding Pro. 27. 3. Zech. 12. 3. Isa. 32. 2.
Heavy are,
To those who them upon their shoulders bear:
Yet Light, not pondrous to their proper place:
So, to all Hearts renu'd with saving Grace
All sins more Ps. 38. 4. 5. Job 6. 3. 4. M^t. 11. 28.
heavy than Rocks are, and seem;
Though stony hearts them light and easy deem. Zech. 12. 3. Dan. 2. 34. 35.
Prove. 27. 3. 21. Chron. 25. 12. Ps. 137. 9. Eccl. 10. 9. Josh. 10. 11.

2.
Rocks press and bruise Them sore on whom they lie,
And for mere anguish make them Roar and Cry.
Sins do fo too; when God does once awake
Men's souls, their Pressure makes them Psalm. 38. 1. to 11. Ps. 32. 3. Ps. 22.
1. Joh. 3. 24. Ps. 88. 1. 2 3.
roar and quake.
O then beware of Sins, which Mat. 11. 28. Psalm. 38. 8. 2 Samuel 24. 14.
bruise, oppress
Our souls, and work naught else but their distress.
Rocks sink, and bend still Exodus 15. 5. Neh. 7. 11. Jer. 51. 63. 64.
down wards: Sins do so,
Tending to Psalm. 9. 17. Psalm. 55. 15. Pro. 5. 5. 2 Pet. 2. 14. Isa. 24. 24.
Hell the Place to which they go:
Each day they sink men lower than they were,
Till by degrees they them to Hell downe-beare.
Oh then betimes shake off these Heb. 12. 1. Amos 2. 13. Rev. 18. 21.
weights, which press
And sink our Souls to Hell, without redress.
4.
Rocks Exodus 1^. 16. 1 Samuel 25. 35.
cold, hard, dead and senseless are; Heb. 3. 13. Ezech. 3. 7. Ephesians. 2. 1. 2.
c. 4. 18. 19.
Sins make
All such, within whose Hearts they Lodgings take:
Beware then how such Guests we entertain,
By which our Souls are deaded, hurt and Slain.
5. 2 Chro. 25. 12. Isa. 8. 14. 15. Psalm. 14^. 6. Zech. 12. 3.

Rocks make men often to stumble, slip, and fall;
And break their Bones, Limbs, Necks, often times withal:
Sins Isa. 8. 15. Jer. 18. 15. Isa. 24. 20. Jer. 8. 4 12. c. 25. 27. c. 50.
32.
do the like. If then we would be free
From Slips and Break-neck-falls, we must them flee.
6.
Rocks are Isa. 2. 21.
deformed, horrid, barren, vile;
And so are Isa. 64. 6. Ezech. 16. 3. to 40. Pro. 13 5. Genesis 49. 4.
sins, with all whom they defile.
These make Men ugly, filthy, Steril, base,
And all their Glory, Beauty quite deface;
Yea, change them into Ezech. 21. 25. c. 22. 27.
Monsters, wolves, dogs, swine;
Nay Joh. 6. 70. 71. c. 8. 44. Act. 20. 29. 2 Pet. 2. 22. Rev. 22. 15.
Fiends incarnate. O then Sins decline!
7.
Where Exodus 15. 16. Job 18. 4. c. 28. 9.
Rocks once fix their Stations, they remain;
And none but God can move them thence again:
So Sins once settled in Men's Hearts, there Jer. 13. 23. Romans 7. 18. to 25.
Zeph. 12. Jude 10. 11. 12. 13.
stand
East ^entred, till Gods own Almighty hand
Expel them thence. O then let no Sins lie
Upon our Souls, but out them presently,
Lest they should Heb. 3. 12. 13. Ephesians. I. 1. 2. 3. c. 4. 18. 19. Romans 1. 23. to
29.
settle; for if once they rest
Within them, they are hardly dispossessed.
8.
Rocks are Jer. 5. 3. Mat. 7. 25. 26. Job 41. 24.
exceeding hard to batter, break,
Mine, pierce, demolish. So let all Men speak,
And they must say, that Jer. 13. 23. Ephesians. 1. 19. 20. 1 Cor. 9. 27. Romans 7.
18. to 25. Heb. 12. 1.
all Sins are so too,
We ruin, break them still with much ado.
He who does think his Sins with ease to quell,
Shall never tame, nor from him them expel.
9.
Rocks make their Dwellers Obad. 3. 4. Jer. 21. 13. c. 49. 16.
fearelesse, and secure
Of Foes or Perils, and to think all sure:
Sins Job 12. 6. Isa. 28. 15. 18. Deuteronomy. 29. 19. 20 Judge. 18. 7. 10. 17.
Ezech. 29. 2. to 12.
do the like to those that in them dwell;
Who fear no dangers till they sink to bell.
O then beware lest Sins make us secure.
No State's so ill, as that which seems most sure!
10.
All Rocks are Jer. 5. 3.
blushlesse, shameless, impudent;
Sins are so too, naught can then daunt, relent.
And by degrees Men's Hearts, Brows they so Jer. 3. 3. c. 6. 15. c. 8. 12.
Ezech. 2. 4. c. 3. 7. Heb. 3. 13.

That they no Sin, Blush, shame, disgrace can feel.
Take ^eede then lest Sin, first, us shameless make,
Then Senseless, Graceless, fit for Hells dread Lake.
11.
Rocks, stones 2 King. 3. 19. 25.
good grounds often spoil, and quite deface:
So Ezech. ^8. 24. 26.
sins good men deprave, mar sham^, disgrace.
12.
Rocks, Stones in fertile Soiles them Isa. 5. 2. 2 King. 53. 19. 25. Mat. 13.
5. Mar. 4. 5. 6. Lu. 8. 6. 7.
barren make;
And naught will spring, or grow there, till men take
Them thence: So Rocks and Stones of Sin decay,
And make Men 1 Pet. 2. 1. 2. Jam. 4. 1. to 12.
fruitless till removed away.
No fruits of Grace will ever grow, or sprout
Up in them, till these Stones be dug out.
13.
Great Rocks Ezech. 24. 7. 8. Rev. 6. 15. 16. Numb. 23. 9.
apparent are to each Man's eye,
And all both far and near may them epsy.
Great Sins in all, in 2 Samuel 12. 10. 11. 12. 14. Exech. 16. 36. 37. 38. Isa.

Themselves to all both far and near descry;
Whence Ezech. 24. 7. 8.

And do in 1 King. 13. and 14. and 16.
others worlds of Sins beget.
Let all, but Great ones chiefly, all Sins fly;
Which though kept close, will yet 2 Samuel 12 1. 12. Psa. 90. 8 Eccles. 12. 14.

Instruct us then, O Christ, our Rock, to shun

For fear of ruin, and still give us Grace
To fly these Rocks of Sin in every place,

Meditations of the third Sort, suiting Rocks, and Gods Elect together.
BEsides, these Rocks present before our Eyes
The State of Gods Elect, in lively wise.
1.
Rocks fixed are, not tossed to and fro,
With every Wind, Storm, Tempest: Even so (b) Job 18. 4. Mat. 7. 25. 26.

Gods Chosen Sheep with Romans 8. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39.
firm and stable Hearts
Adhere to Him in all their Troubles, Smarts:
No Storms, Winds, Crosses, Changes can remove
Them from his Word, Son, Spirit, Truth or Love:
When Joh. 6. 66. 67. 68. 2 Pet. 1. 10. 11.
Troops of others shrink, and fall away,
They cleave to him as to their only Stay.
2.
Rocks many Mat. 7. 25. 26.
Winds, Storms, Tempests undergo:
And do not all the Psalm. 34 13. Act. 23. 22. Psa. 73. 14.
Saints, whiles here, do so?
3.
Rocks meekely bear and suffer Storms that fall,
And never fret, rage, or repine at all:
Gods Psalm. 39. 2. 9. 1 Samuel 3. 8. 2 Samuel 15. 25. 26. 27. c. 18. 4. to 14.
Saints without all murmur, fret, or cry
Their Crosses, Losses bear most quietly;
Submitting unto God, whose Providence
All bitter Potions does to them dispense.
4.
All men on Mat. 7. 25. 26.
Rocks may safely build and rest:
And of all trusty friends, the Saints are best.
On 3 Ioh. ^. 6. Prove. 17. 17. c. 18. 24. Joh. 15. 13.
whom we may all times with trust rely,
And to them in all Dangers safely fly.

Poor,
In outward State; but seldom beg at door.
6.
Yet though Rocks Outsides be but base and rude,
They richest Mines within their wombes include:
So though Saints Outsides be but ragged, base,
Within them Jam. 2. 5. Psalm. 45. 13. Ephesians. 3. 19. Phil. 1. 11. Col. 1. 9. 10.

So Gods Elect, though vile whiles that they lie
In Natures Quarries in deformity;
Yet hew'de out thence, squared, polisht by Gods Grace,
And laid in order in their proper Place,
Become Psalm. 14, 4. 12. Isa. 11. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 17. 2 Cor. 6. 16.

rich Temples wherein God does dwell,
And do all other structures far excel,
In worth, and glory: Lord thus square, and lay
Us in these Sacred walls, which last for aye.

Rocks for the most part lowly are and meek:

35. 36. 37. 38. 2 Cor. 4. 9. to 13.
Saints are so, and no high places seek;
In this vain world; where they dejected lie
Till God advance them to the Starrie sky.
9.
Rocks Kingdoms, Islands guard and fortify
Against raging Seas, Floods, Storms, and Enemy:
Exodus 32. 11. to 15. Jam. 5. 16. 17. 18. 2 King. 2. 12. c. 6. 9. to 24. c. 8.
9. c. 2^. 6. Genesis 28. 23. to 25. Act. 27. 24. 2 King. 13. 14. 23.
Saints holy Lives, and frequent Prayers ar
States surest Guards; Forts, both in Peace and war;
These Shield-off Judgments, Foes, Plagues, yea Gods Ire,
Which else would wast, and scorch them worse than Fire.
10.
Rocks from their Sides send forth Numb. 20. 10. 11. 12. Deuteronomy. 8. 15. Psalm.

Springs sweet and pure,
Men's Thirst to quench, their wounds and sores to cure:
And who but Christ and Saints can Isa. 61. 1. c. 4^. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1, 4. 5.
Comfort bring
To Sinne-sicke Souls, and those who feel the Sting
Gripes, Torments, Flames of Hell and Conscience?
Or bind up broken, hearts, and chase from thence
All fears and horrid Terrors? Which an Hell
On Earth often make in those wherein they dwell?
Hence all such wounded Souls do ever fly
To 2 Cor. 1. 4. 5. 6. Act. 9. 10. to 20.
these for Comfort in extremity:
Since no ungodly wretch can cheer, or ease
A Sinne-sicke Soul, nor aching Heart appease.
11.
Rocks most despised and neglected are,
As worthless Creatures: Thus Gods Saints often fare
1 Cor. 4. 9. to 13. Heb. 11. 36. 37. 38. Mal. 3. 14. to 18.
Contem'd, abhorred of Most, as vile and base,
Though of Mankind the only Pearls, Stars, Grace.
12.
Rocks hurt no Ships, Boats, Men, but such as Act. 27. 29.
hit
Themselves against them; and so break or split:
So Gods Elect do never hurt, break, quash
Any, but those who 1 King. 13. 4. 6. Act. 9. 4. 5.
wilfully rune, dash,
Bruise, break themselves against them; who must check
And blame themselves, not them, for this their wreck.
13.
God first ingrav'd his Sacred Laws upon

They Time survive, and gain eternity.
The two first Stony Tables whereupon
God stamped his Laws, broke, lost were long agon:
These harder Tables of Saints Hearts remain,
And in them Gods blessed Laws for aye retain.
Lord, I my heart a Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26.

Therein thy Laws, from which it may not swarve
And since it shall out-dure the firmest Rock,
O, this rich treasure ever in it lock!
Yea, make each Saints Stone-Heart the Treasury
Of thy sweet Laws, for all eternity.

1 Pet. 1. 1. 2. Heb. 11. 36. 37.
Dispersed here and there, where hid they lie
In secret Corners in obscurity;
Driven from Country, Lands, House, Home, by those

Rocks burnt to Isa 33. 12.

And Stones of his Church here on Earth together,
And keep out Errors, Sects that would it sever:
Yea, sent to barren Soiles where grew no Grace,
They make them Act. 26. 17. 18. Romans 1. 13. c. 15. 18. 19. 20. Col. 1. 6

Meditations of the fourth Class, sampling Rocks, and Rockie Hearts, with
ungodly Men, together.
YEt more, me thinks Rocks represent to all
Man's Rockie Heart, and Nature, since the fall,
In some Respects, wherein they well agree
With Stony Hearts; from which God make us free.
1.
Rocks are exceeding Jer. 5. 3.
Shameless, Impudent,
Naught will them daunt, or cause for to relents
So men of Stony Hearts, have Jer. 3. 3. c. 5. 3. c. 8. 12. Ezech. 2. 4. c. 3.
7.

Faces of Rock, which no blush, shame can feel.
No shameful Sin, Convictions, or Disgrace
Will daunt, or cause them once to hide the Face.
It is their Phil. 3. 19.
glory to be void of shame,
And vaunt of that which does them most defame.
2.
Rocks show no mercy, but to Josh. 10. 10. Judge. 9. 53. 54. Zech. 12. 3. Luke
13. 4. 2 Chronicles. 25. 12.

Break, bruise, or hurt, all those on whom they fall.
So men of Rockie hearts are 2 King. 8: 12. 13. Genesis 5. 7. Psalm. 71. 4. Prove.

merciless,
And break, bruise, tear, crush, all they do oppress.
No Cries, Parts, Virtues, Merits can assuage
Their cruel Projects, nor divert their Rage.
O let me rather fall into the Paws

3.
Rocks make those Isa. 47. 2.

grind,
Press, bruise Gods Chosen, till they be refinde
From all their Husks of sin, and made meet Food
For Gods sweet Palate, to their greatest Good.
4.
Some Rocks burnt in the Furnace harder grow;
And naught but Deuteronomy. 8. 9. Job 28. 2.
St^ele, or Iron from them flow:
Which serves to break, hew, polish, fit, and square
Rude Rocks and Stones, and Stately piles to rear:
Gods fery Furnace Rockie Hearts makes more
Isa. 1. 5. 6. 2 Chro. 28. 22. 23.
Hard, and obdurate than they were before;
Yea all its scorching Heat the which they feel,
Serves but to turn them into harder Steel,
Or Iron; for to break, hew, polish, pare
The Rocks and Stones which God lays in the rare
And choifest Buildings of his Church: whose walls
Are Exodus 1. 12. c. 4.
built, not rased, with these hard Iron Malls.
And Tools of Steel, though they no Act. 8. 21.
Part nor share
Have in the Temples which they help to rear.
5.
The most mischievous Instruments of war
Wounds, Bloodshed, first from Job 28. 2. Deuteronomy. 8. 9.
Rocks extracted ar;
As Canons, Muskets, Bullets, Sword, Bills, Spears
With other weapons, where with Man kills, tears,
Torments, Maimes, Stabs his Brother in despite,
As if he did in naught but Blood delight:
So from Men's Stony Mat: 15. 19. Genesis 6. 5. c. 8. 21. c. 27. 41.
Hearts first flow and spring
All Mischiefs, Murders, Wars, Sins, each ill thing:
These were the Artists which did first invent
Each bloody, murdering, warlike Instrument;
The Shops in which they forged were, the Arms
That weild them still, and work a world of Harms.
O cursed Hearts of Rock from whence do flow
All Evils, Mischiefs, woes we hear, see, know!
Lord free and ever keep us from such Hearts,
Which are the Cause of all our Sins, Ills, Smarts.
6.
Rocker make those in them Obad. 3. 4. Jer. 21. 13. 14. c. 49. 16.

To make all Is. 47. 7. 89. 10. 11. c. 5. 19.

Them in great Mischieses ere they be aware.
Rocks are Job ^1. 24 J^r 23. 29. Nah. 1. 6. (...). 1. 3.
exceeding Hard; and sooner broke
Than squared or polisht with the Axes stroke:
Men's Stony Hearts so hard and flinty are,
That all Gods A^es, Judgments (...). 1^ 2 Chronicles. 2^. 2^. Exodus 5 to 13. I^r.
5. 3. c 2. 30. Isa.. 9. 30 Amo. 4. 6. to 1^ Romans 2. 4. 5.
cannot square
Them to his Rules, nor cause them to amend,
And sooner break than rent, or make them bend.
He who in hardest Exo. 31. 1^. c 34. 1. 4. 29.

Naught but Child's blood these Faech. 11. 19 c. 36. 26. Jer. 32 39.

Sunshine Mercies, and his sweetest Grace;

Affect, melt, change, nor more them to repent.

All Stony Hearts with these, still Heb. 6. 8. Romans 1. 24 to 22. c. 2. 4. 5.
overflow;
Fruitful in nothing, but those (...) of vice,
And sin, which bar them out of Paradise.

Rocks Deaf and Senseless are of good, and ill:
Hard Ephesians. 4. 18. 19. 1 Timothy 4. 2. Proverb. 23. 35. Deuteronomy. 29 2. 3. 4. Isa. 6.
9. 10. 2 Chronicles. 36. 15. 16.
Hearts are so, and neither can, do, will,
Gods Word, Law, Works regard, Hear, understand;
Nor, fear his angry; kiss, his soothing hand.
12.
The fiereest Storms, Mat. 7. 25. 26.
Winds, Waves, on Rocks do dash:
Gods Deuteronomy. 28. 15. to 68. 1. Sam. 5 7. 2. Chron. 21. 19. Ezech. 14. 21. Mich:
2. 10. Heb. 10. 29.
Sorest Judgments Stony Hearts do lash:
And though they seldom feel Gods stroke or Curse;
This nothing Mends, but Ephesians. 4. 18. 19. Romans 2. 5.
makes their Case far worse.
13.
The pleasant Showers, Drops, Dewes that on Rocks light.
Make them not fruitful, nor in better plight:
But glide away forthwith, not sinking down
To make them Mellow, good, or sin to drown:
So Rockie Heb. 6. 7. 8. c. 3. 13. 8. Mat. 13. 5. 6. Isa. 28. 10. 13. 2 Chro.

Hearty, though they receive the rain,
And frequent slowres of God, blessed Word; remain
Still Barren, Hard, and Senseless; naught will stay
That drops upon them, but all slides away
That Is Good or Sacred; only Floods of Joh 15. 16.
sin,
Sink down with speed, and freely enter in.
14.
None craggie Luke 8. 6. 13. Amos. 6. 12.
Rocks will Till, Plough, Plant, or Saw;
Their Labors lost who do it, naught will grow.
Obdurate Hearts few use to Plough or Till

The seed is lost which on the Rocks does fall.
15.
Rocks blunt, and hurt the edge of Tools that smite,
Or square them for good uses; yea in spite
Their Chips and Shivers dash against the Eyes,
Face, Shins of those that hew them. Lo the guise

16.
hurt and malice those
Who check their sins, and hate them as their Foes.
Yea, let their Pastors in their Ministry
But touch their Sores, into their Face they fly:
So zealous are they for those Sins, which end
In hell, when they will not Gods cause defend.
O that our zeal for God were half so much
As for our darling Crimes, when Men them touch:
Then would we let them Psalm 141. 5. Psalm. 139. 23. 24. Prove. 8. 9. c. 29. 25.
strike, wound, lance, yea Slay
Our dearest Sins; and thank, not them gainsay.
16.
Rocks Cold and Heavy are, and Job. 18. 4.

Out of their Places; nor mount up above
Unless perforce; and then they ever Rev. 18. 21. Jer. 51. 63. 64. Neh. 9. 11.
Exodus 15. 5. 10 Matthew. 18. 6. Mark. 9. 42. Luke 17. 2.
bend
Down to the Center; whence they did ascend
So Romans 2. 4. 5. c. 1. 23. to 32. Ephe. 4. 18. 19. 2 Pet. 2. 10. 21. 22.
Rockie Hearts are Cold, and lumpish still
To all that good is; prone to naught but Ill:
No Love, Heat, zeal to God within them flame;
His Cause they will not stir in for Love, nor Shame:
Their Thoughts, Minds, Cares are fixed on Phil. 3. 18. 19.
things below,
And never upwards Soar to view, mind, know
The things above; unless some Isa. 26. 11. 16.
sudden Fear
Of Death, Hell, Danger up them scrue or rear
Against their Wills: which past, to Earth they hie
With greater poyse, and there still grovelling lie.
17.
Rocks Hab. 2. 19.
Dumb and silent are: So Hearts of Stone
For good Discourse have neither Tongue, nor Tone
Sitting still Isa. 56. 10. Job. 15. 3.
Mute like stones without voice, sense,
When any fall to godly Conference.
18.
Rocks Ezech. 26. 4.
bare and naked are; whence all may spy
Their Nakedness, and gross Deformity.
All Stony Hearts, are Ezech. 16. 3. to 15. Rev. 17. 18.
naked, poor, and bare;
Their Bareness, vileness, wants exposed are
To all Men's view; till Christ's rich Robes of Grace
Cloth or Adorn them, and these wants deface.
19.
Rocks Livelesse are; and Stony Hearts are Mat. 8. 22. Joh. 5. 25. 19. Ephesians.
2. 1. 5. c. 5. 14.
Dead;
No life of Grace was ever in them bred:
Yea, all who now draw breath, must shortly (...). ^. 9. 27. Ps^^ ^9. 48.
dye,
(Who knows how soon) and dead as Rocks shall lie.
20.
Rocks till by force they broken be, and slit,
2 Chronicles. 2. 2. 18. 1 King. 5. 17. c. 7. 9. 10. 12.
Hewd, polisht, for all Buildings are unfit:
Thus Rockie Hearts till God them Ezech. 36. 26. Joel 2. 13. Hosea 6. 5.
rent, hew, square;
To build his House, Church, Temple, useless are.
21.
Rocks make Men Isa. 8. 14.
fall and stumble, to their Pain
And Hurt: That Romans 2. 5. Ephesians. 4. 18. 19.
Rockie Hearts do thus, it is plain;
Since all our Slips, Falls, Bruises, Sins proceed
From Stony Hearts, which make us take no heed.
22.
Rocks Act. 27. 29.
Shipwreck those, who do too near them sail;
And sunken Rocks to split Ships most prevail:
Thus Rockie Hearts unless we from them fly
Will Romans 2. 4. 5. Ephesians. 4. 18. 19. 1 Timothy 6. 9.
wrack us all; but yet especially
When neither Felt, nor Seen: for then we run
With full-saile on them, and are quite undone.
23.
Rocks feel no Burdens, weights that on them lie;
So Rockie Hearts do never Ephesians. 4. 18. 19.
sigh, groan, cry
Under the Weights and Burdens of their Crimes,
(Though Psalm. 38. 4. Matthew. 11. 28. Joh 6. 3.
heavier than the Sands a thousand times)
And why? because they never feel their poyse
Till it them sink to Hell, and quite destroys.
24.
Not all the Men on Earth, with all their Art
Can make one Rock, or Stone; much less an Heart;
But only Joh 1. 3
God himself: yet Men alone
Are the Psalm 95. 8. Exodus 8. 15.
Creators of all Hearts of Stone,
Not God: O wonder, that Men should create
Naught but Hard Rockie Hearts which God does hate:
Such Hearts can none else but Men, Fathers call,
Which sink still downwards, till to Hell they fall.

O then when ever we a Rock shall see,
Let these thoughts to our Minds recalled be:
Yea, ponder what Old Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 2^. Psalm. 51. 10. 17.
Rockie Hearts we have
By Sin and Nature: then New, soft Hearts crave,
With fervent Prayers, Groans, Sighs, Tears; so we
Our Hearts of Rock, to flesh transformed shall see.
And if we find, feel, know by signs most sure
Our hearts thus changed, and made soft, and pure;
Let us forever in Word, Deed, Life, Thought,
Extol and (y) praise Him who this Change has wrought;
Keeping a narrow Act. 2. 40. 47. Ephesians. 3. 20. 21.
watch both night and day,
Over our cheating Hearts; for fear lest the:
Should by degrees freeze, or grow Heb. 3. 13. c. 12. 1^. Pro. 4. 22.

Yea turn to Rocks, and so for aye remain.
26.
Sweet Jesus Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26.
take our Stony Hearts away,
And give us hearts of flesh, we humbly pray;
And of all other Plagues, from us avert
This as the greatest, an obdurate Heart.
And since of all our Parts Thou do require,
Seek, prize our Prove. 23. 25.
Hearts most; grant us we desire
Such broken, contrite tender Hearts, as may
Delight Thee most; and never from Thee stray.
Such Hearts Thou only can Psalm. 51. 10. 17.
create, not we;
Make our Hearts such; then happy shall we be.

When I consider that all Isa. 22. 16. Mark. 15. 46.
Tombestones, Urnes,
And Tombs, where Man, Genesis 3. 19.
mere Dust, to Dust returns;
Are broken pieces of some Rocks; I then
Behold my Tombe-stone, in each Rock I ken:
And say; Lo here is the lasting Monument
Wherein my Body must ere long be pent,
And shut Close Prisner, till the Joh. 5. 58. Rev. 20. 12. 13.

When all its Rust and Bolts shall fall away.

And they shall Treasure, Honey in it find.

When I behold some people dwell, live, lie
In Job 24. 8. Obad. 3. Jer. 48. 28.
Caves of Rocks; I then think presently;
He who a Cottage wants his Head to Hide,
Shall find some Rock, or Hole where to abide;
In which he may sleep freer from fears, Foes,
And Cares, than those whom Castles, Guards, enclose.
What need we care then here for House or Home,
If these should fail, yet Rocks will give us Room
To Lodge and hide in: Here 1 King. 17 1. 13. c. 19. 9. 11. 15. Heb. 11. 38.

And been more happy in these caved Stones

When we behold Men with much Danger, Swet,
Pains, Trouble, vilest wrack to gather, get,
And draw from Sea-Rockes, for to burn, or dress
Their tilled Grounds, and mend their fruitfulness.
Me thinks it should wring Phil. 3. 18. 19.
Tears from us, to see
What Pains these take for Dung, whiles they and we
Do not take half the Care, Pains, Travel, Sw^et
The richest Gems of Grace to dig, fetch, get
From Christ our Rock, which would not only cheer
And warm our Souls, and make them fruit to bear;
But them Rev. 3. 18. Psalm. 45. 13. 14.

That they all else as vile Dung would despise.

7.
When I a Rent or Clift in Rocks epsy,
It minds me of the dreadful Majesty,
And mighty Power of our God which make

When I behold Men, Tempests, Waves, Rain, Wind,

It makes me see what Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26.

At which though Christ (who seeks our Souls to save)
Does daily Rev. 3. 20. Isa. 53. 1. 3. Joh. 12. 37. 38 39. 40. c. 1. 10. 11.

seldom finds,
Or makes an Entrance: nay though many years,
He thus beats on them, yet no fruit appears:
O Hearts more hard than any Rock, Flint, Steel,
Which all these strokes upon them never seele!
O 2 Pet. 3. 9. Rev. 1. 9. c* 3. 10. Romans ^5. 5.
patient Jesus! who so long can bear,
With such hard hearts, which will not melt nor tear!
9.
When I behold Rocks, Stones, most ragged, base,
Rude and deformed in their Native place,
2 Chronicles. 2. and 3. 1 King. 5. and 6. and 7.
Hewed out from thence, and polisht by Mankind
Turned into goodly Structures of each Kind
And made rich Statucs, Zech. 9. 16. 2 Samuel 12. 30.
Jewels, Ouches, Gemmes,
Yea, set in Gold and royal Diadems.
I thence conclude, that God with much more ease
Speed, Art, can turn, when ever he shall please,
The Ezech. 36. 26. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 17. 2 Cor 6. 16. Ephesians. 2. 21. Mal. 3. 17.
hardest, vilest, rockie Hearts that are
Into rich Temples, Jewels, Gemmes most rare;
Yea set them in Christ's very royal Crown
Like precious stones unto their great renown.
As he did 1 Timothy 1. 13 14. 15. 16.
Paul, 2 Chronicles. 33. 12. to 20.
Manasses, and all those
Most glorious Saints which Heaven does now enclose.
Let no man then though never so mean, vile, base,
Lewd, sinful, once despair of Gods free Grace,
Which in a moment can Ephesians. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. c. 3. 20. 21.
change and transtate
Him from his wretched to a glorious state.
10.
When as I see the Job 28. 10. Ps. 105. 41.
waters that do stream
And gush from stony Rocks, me thinks they seem
A lively Image of those 2 King. 20. 5. Job 16. 20. Lam. 2. 18. Jer. 9. 1. 8.
Iuk. 7. 38. 44. Act. 20. 19. 31. Mat. 26. 75.
Tears that flow
From Rockie Hearts, when they once tender grow.
Through Gods sweet Grace and Spirit, which can melt
The hardest Hearts to Tears, and them relent
As He did Rocks of Old, whence Psalm. 105. 41. Exodus 17. 6 Numb. 20. 11. 12.
water gusht
By streams when He them either smote or crushed.
Blessed Lord Jesus, soften, break, relent
Our Hearts of Rock, and cause them to repent,
And send forth Streams, nay Floods of Tears to wash,
Our sins away, and all their force to quash.
11.
Job 39. 28. 29. Jer. 49. 16.
Eagles in lofty Rocks still breed and lie,
And from their Tops their Prey far off epsy:
Gods chosen Saints whom Scriptures often compare
To Psa. 103. 5. Isa. 40. 13. Mat. 24. 28. Luke 17. 37.
Eagles, upon Christ high mounted are:
(The tallest Rock) on whom they Ephesians. 2. 20.
build, lodge, stay,
And thence they seek, find, take their sacred prey.
Lord make our Souls with Eagles wings to fly,
To this sweet Rock, and there to live and dye.
12.
When I contemplate how Rocks Job. 28. 10. Psalm. 104. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14.
Crystal Springs
Which serve to moisten, soften other Things,
Make trees, herbs, grass, plants, flowers spring and grow;
And queneh the Thiest of all things here below;
Yet neither moysten, soften, fructify
The Rocks themselves, still barren, fruitless, dry:
Me thinks I view in them some Rockie Hearts,
Endew'd with rare, rich, profitable Parts
Of Art and Nature; which do good to many,
Yet to their Owners good, they do not any.
How many Preachers others help to save
Yet Mat. 22. 7. 1 Cor. 9. 27.
damn themselves? and whiles they others gave
The Food of life, have starved themselves to death:
Others made Fertile, themselves barren Heath?
How many 2 Samuel 16. 23. c. 17. 23.
wise to teach, rule, counsel all
Except themselves, and so through folly fall:
Its hardly worth the Name of Good Art, Skill
That betters others, makes the Owners Ill.
13.
When I epsy Rocks trampled on by all,
Christ's and true Christians States, to mind I call.
Isa. 53. 2. 3. 4, Mar. 9. 12. Psalm. 1 18. 22. 1 Cor. 4. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 2
Cor. 4. 8. 9. 10. 11. c. 6. 4, to 11. Heb. 11. 36. 37. 38.
Trod under feet, with all contempt, spite, hate
Throughout the world, and valued at no rate.
Complain not then of any dis-respect.
No greater Honor than Ill men's neglect.
14.
Each vaste, high-towring, massy Rock we eye
Presents to us the strength and Potencie
Of that Almighty God, whose Isa. 40. 12: 10 18. Psalm. 89. 13.
Potent Hand
Did in a moment, both by Sea and Land
Raise up so many vaste high Piles, and Pack
Such Massy Rocks on one another back;
Without an Engine, by his Psalm. 148. 5.
Word alone,
And them so strongly soder one to one
That all the Art, Wit, Strength, in Man's to weak
To raze these Mounts, and them in Pieces break.
We wonder much at See Camdens Brittania. Willshire.
Stonedge, where there lie
A few large stones, pil'd up not very high
On one another head, and think it strange,
How men such pondrous Stones eould rear and range,
In such a manner, though these great stones be
But Pigmies, Pibbles to the Rocks we see.
How much more then with wonder and amaze
Should we upon those Massy high Rocks gaze
Which them so far in Bulk, weight, height exceed,
And may true admiration in us breed
Of Gods Almighty Power, which could raise
Such grand, rare, lasting Trophies to his praise.
To which all Structures made by men do seem
But Mole-hills, Attomes, and of no esteem.
He who such heavy Rocks could make, lift, rear,
Isa. 40. 12. 15.
Weigh, toss with ease, as if they feathers were;
With greater ease can lift and elevate
His humbled Saints out of their Psa. 113. 7. 8. 1 Samuel 27. 8.

And in an instant into Psalm. 2. 9. Psalm. 107. 40.

All who with Him or Them presume to clash.

When we discern the Sea, and Time to Job. 14. 9.
wear
The very Rocks, and them to waste, eat, tear;
Think and contemplate then, how time, age, space
All things consume, waste, weaken and deface;
But chiefly Men, compact of Genesis 3. 19. Eccles. 3. 10. c. 12. 7.
Dust, not stone
Who fade like Ps. 103. 14. 15. 16. Psa. 90. 5. 6. Isa. 4. 6. 7. 8. Job 14. 1.
2. Jam. 1. 10. 1 Pet 1. 24.
grass, are in a Moment gone.
How can mere Dust and Ashes think to last,
When time and age the hardest Rocks do wast?
16.
Those who in lofty, fenced, steep Rocks dwell
Are Obad. 3. ser. 49. 16. c. 21. 13.
haughty, proud, secure, and far excel
Most others in these vices, slighting all,
As if no Mischief could upon them fall.
Whence sudden Dangers, Ruins them surprise
(To quell their Pride) from those they most despise;
Thus carnal Men advanced and fortifide
With potent Friends, wealth, Honors, swell with Ezech. 28. 2. to 29. Isa. 47.
7. to 12. Rev. 18. 7. 8.
Pride;
Deride all Dangers, Foes, grow so secure,
As if their Props and Stays should still endure.
Whence God their Pride to punish and abate
Casts them down headlong by some sudden Fate.
Which should make all, but great men specially
Beware of Pride, and gross Security,
The sad Prove. 16 18 Rev. 18. 7. 8.
Forerunners of a certain fall,
Which them and theirs will soon to pieces mall.
17.
When as we see Men with must cost and pain
To Mine the Rocks, and Treasures thence to gain
Of sundry Sorts; where with they much increase
Their wealth, and make things meet for war and Peace:
It forthwith minds us how with far more care,
Cost, Pains, Sweat, Labor all who Christians are,
Should daily Prove. 2. 4. Col. 2. 2. 3. Mat. 13. 44.
Search, and Mynefor richer Oar
In Christ their Rock; in whom there is such store
Of peerless Mines, and Treasures of each Kind
As well content, yea Ephesians. 1. 23 Joh. 1. 16.
fill the vastest Mind;
And store all Christians with all Things they need
In Peace and War, Life, death! Let this then breed
A Resolution in us, still to Mine,
And draw these Treasures from this Rock Divine.
18.
Whiles that we view Men Rocks to smite, pierce, rent
With Sledges, Axes, or like Instrument;
We then should ponder, how we all each day
Our blessed Rock Christ Jesus Amos 2. 13 Heb. 10. 29. c. 6. 6. 2 Pet. ^1.
Rev. 1. 7.
smite, stab, slay
A fresh with those accursed Sins and Crimes
Wherewith we grieve, pierce, wound Him at all times:
Which Thought should turn the Edge, and Point of all
Our Sins from Him; upon our selves to mall
Break, wound our Rockie hearts, because we rent,
Abuse Christ thus; and cause us to repent.
19.
When we epsy Rocks dart out Sparks of fire
When smote, or cut with Tools of Steel or I're:
It sweetly minds us, how the Hand of God
Smiting upon us with an Psalm. 2. 9. 10. 11. 12. Isa. 26. 9. 11. 16. Hos. 5.

Iron Rod
Should from our Hearts of Rock extract and draw
Such sacred Sparks, yet flames as should them thaw,
Purge all their Dross away, and them inflame
With a most ardent Love, unto his Name.
Lord when thy Rod shall ever on us lite,
Let it such Sparks, and Flames in us excite.
20.
Springs, Quarries, Mines in Rocks, never drawn quite dry;
Present most sweetly to each Mind and Eye
The Ephesians. 3. 8. 10. 19. 20. Joh. 1. 5. 16. Col. 2. ^. 8. 9. 10.
inexhausted, boundless, Endless Mines,
Springs, Treasures, Stares, and vastest Magazines
Of Grace and Goodness, which enclosed lie,
Within the Bosom of the Deity.
To feed, feast, fill, enrich, each hungry, poor,
Sad, pined Soul, with all their matchless store.
The very thoughts whereof our Hearts should fill
With sweetest Solace, and delight them still.
21.
When I perceive the smallest Pibble Exodus 15. 5. Neh. 9. 11. Jet. 51. 63 64.
Mat. 18. 6. Rev. 18. 21.
sink
In Floods, as deep as greatest Rocks; I think
How smallest Sins are deadly, and as well,
As soon almost, as Great, sink Men to Hell.
O then beware of all sins, since the small
As well as great to Rom 6. 23. c. 24. 25. Ec. 12. 18. Math. 12. 36. 37.
Hell thus ^^nd and fall.
Let Papists talk of Venial sins, I trow
No sin is venial, when all sink so low.
22.
The worthless Rubbish in each Rock exceeds,
And hides the Mines and Precious stones it breeds:
Yea, richest Mines have ever greater Store
Of dross and off all, than refined Oar.
Which pondred, learnes us, how each Place, Mat. 7. 13. 14. c. 13. 3. to 51.
Luke 13. 23. 24. Romans 10. 16. c. 11. 4. 5.
Church breeds
More Bad than Good: that Good Men's Ill, exceeds
Their Goodness: that the Bad, Good Men obscure
As Rubbish hides, Surmounts the Oar that is pure.
Hence Multitude, and visibility
Appear ill Marks a Churches Truth to try.
23.
When Josh. 10. 11 Judge 9. 53. 54. 2 Samuel 11. 21. Zech. 12. 3. Luke 13. 4.
Rocks or Stones fall on Men, and them dash
To pieces, or at least them bruise and quash:
It minds us how our Rock Christ Isa. 8. 14. 15. Luke 2. 34. Psa. 29. Rev. 2.
27. c. 19. 15.
grindeth all
To powder, upon whom be does once fall.
O then beware how we pull on our backs
This Massy Rock which Men to pieces crackes.
24.
Psalm. 41. 2. Psalm 61. 2.
Rocks keep from sinking those who walk or Stand
Upon them, whiles such, who on Bogges, Floods, Sand
Do walk, Psalm. 40. 2. Psalm. 69. 2. 14. Mat. 14. 30. Jer. 38. 6. 20.
rest, stay, sink down and mired are,
Yea often times drowned without special care.
Hence may we learn that those who walk, rest, stay,
Themselves on Christ (the surest Rock) always
Stand firm, safe, stable; never sinking down;
Whiles those who on Bogges, Sands sink, stand, and drown.
O let our feet on this Rock still abide
Then are we certain not to sink, fall, slide.
25.
Rocks those who dwell upon them fence, Isa. 33 16.
defend,
But those who Scale them, hurt, bruise and offend.
So Christ our Rock Joh. 10. 11. 14. 27. 28. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 5. c. 4 19
protects his Chosen sheep
Who rest upon Him, does them safely keep.
Yet hurts and breaks to Luke 2. 39. Mat. 21. 44 Ps. 2. 9. 10.
pieces all such Foes,
Who dare presume Him, and them to oppose.

Shall quake and shake for very fear; and call
Unto the Rocks and Hills on them to fall;
And into Caves, H^les, Clifts of Rocks shall fly
To hide them from the W^ath, S^^ht, Maje^tie

Till dragged perforce before Christ's Bar and Face,
Where tried, convict, condemned; with all disgrace

For ever scare us from all Sin, and make
Our Stony Hearts to melt, bleed, sigh, break, ache:
And cause us now with speed to fly and hide
Our selves within the Holes of Christ's pierced side,

Of endless Glory, in the Heavens high (q) Rev. 22. 4. 5.

Where we shall reign for all Eternity.
O Christ (our only Rock) of thy free Grace
Advance, and bring us to this blisfull Place:
And let each Rock, Clist, Stone we henceforth see
Instruct us thus, and bring us home to Thee.
The Conclusion.
With these sweet useful Thoughts, and thousands more
The Barren Rocks, our Hearts, and Minds may store
When we behold them: and if Natures Book,
And Rocks, whiles we upon them daily look,
Can teach us Nothing which our Lives may mend,
Or cause our Hearts, Minds, Thoughts up to ascend
To Christ their Rock, God, and the Things above,
Them to contemplate with the greatest Love;
Our Hearts are Rockie; We, quite void of Grace;
And Rocks than we, are yet in better Case.
FINIS.
