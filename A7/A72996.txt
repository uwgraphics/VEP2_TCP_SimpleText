DAVID'S MUSIC:

Or PSALMS OF THAT Royal Prophet, once the sweet Singer of that Jsrael:

UNFOLDED LOGICALLY, EXpounded paraphrastically, and then follows a more
particular explanation of the words, with manifold Doctrines and uses briefly
observed out of the same.

By R. B. and R. A. Preachers of Gods word in Somersetshire.

ZACH. 4. 10. Who has despised the day of small things? Vt olim quidam, sic
and nos. Scripta tibi leuia haec, and ceu vulgaria sordent;
At leuia haec fuerint, sigrauiora dabis.
Tu, quamuis, subtilia dic, subtilia prome,
Vtilia at nobis planaque scripta placent.
AT LONDON Imprinted by FELIX KYNGSTON. 1616.

THE EPISTLE TO the Christian Reader.
IT is a straight charge, which that master gives to his servants in
delivering to them his money, (...), Negotiamini donec veniam, The
consideration whereof as it has set all Gods servants formerly on work, in
their times to turn and put forth their talents, that they might give account
with gain: so the great vantage that they have already gotten, cannot excuse
after servants, in after times from this spiritual traffic: what though
their receipts be less? yet they carefully employ what they have* that their
master also may receive of them an answerable increase.

And this is the cause, why we in like sort, in conscience of this charge, at
this time put our one talent into the bank, which we have heretofore (for the
most part) employed in our private Ministry; and would now with the fishers,
when fishes wax scant at the shore, launch a little further into the deep;
and with the Merchants, thriuing a little at home, adventure further abroad, to
try in other coasts how we can make our markets. In this our present travel,
we have followed the manner of such Traders, making proof with these new
wares, what hope there will be of venting abroad more of the same kind, which
we are very ready to do, and that with speed, if we may know them for the
profit saleable; but if otherwise, as we may save further labor in this course,
so our loss shall not be much by so little: yea hereby we shall gain
somewhat to our selves, even a comfortable answer to make at that day of
account, that whatsoever our success is, yet such have our endeavors been,
hereby to do the best good we can to the Church of God, and with the
conscience of this we have hardened our foreheads against the many censures of
men, and set it as a brazen wall against them; choosing rather to be accounted
of such, foolish, vaineglorious, affecting bookishnes, or any thing else, as
pleases them in their salt humor to utter, then that not doing the good we
might, our own consciences should condemn us, yea, God himself, for evil
and unprofitable servants.

Now we have entered upon the book of the Psalms, drawn on hitherto by the great
variety of documents and instructions, suitable to all estates of men most
plentifully contained herein, so that we may boldly say, there is no
condition of any in prosperity or adversity, peace or wars, health or
sickness, inward or outward distress, with many particular cases in all these
kinds, but he shall find some Psalms, which he may think almost to have
been composed upon his own occasion, wherein he may praise God, pray unto him,
complain and open his particular griefs.

And for direction herein, we refer thee to the diverse Prefaces both of
ancient and late writers, chiefly of Athanasius, Basil the great, Augustine and
some others, who have commended this book unto us, as a storehouse of
instruction, and as an Apothecaries shop richly furnished with all variety of
spiritual medicines, by which we may have remedy against all and every our
several diseases and infirmities. And surely, as when Saul was troubled with
an evil spirit, by advise of his servants, he sought out one that might play
on the Harp, and they found David the son of Ishai, who played with his
hand, and Saul was refreshed, and had ease, the evil spirit departing from
him: so has God given unto his Church the same David still, even the sweet
singer of Israel, to modulate, as on his harp, these heavenly ditties,
whereunto if we resort, to hear, read, sing and meditate therein, our restless
perturbations, inordinate affections and passions whatsoever; which as so many
evil spirits do vex us many times, shall thus depart from us, and we shall
be cased and refreshed thereby.

If any say now to us, that very many have most profitably spent their travel
herein, making expositions, annotations, glosses, paraphrases, enarrations,
yea just and complete comments already, in which respect what use therefore is
there of further labors, hereby rather to ouerloaden the studious, than to
profit them? We answer, that most true it is, not only for this book, but all
parts almost of holy writ, God (his name be blessed) has stirred up the hearts
of many his servants, to bestow their strength, time, learning and means, not
only to profit the present ages wherein they lived, but by their writings
also, like careful Fathers to provide for posterity. Concerning all which,
Epist. lib. 8. epi. 65.
as Seneca to his Lucilius, veneror inuenta sapientiae, Inuentoresque adire
tanquam multorum haereditatem juuat: so do we honor their wise inventions,
and industrious pains, and praise God for it, that others having labored we
are entered into their labors: sed nobis ista acquisita, nobis laborata sunt.
This is no thanks to us, who have these as an inheritance already provided and
gotten to our hands. Agamus igitur (says the same Author) bonum patrem
familias, faciamus ampliora quae accepimus, major ista haereditas a nobis ad
posteros transcat. We shall not prove our selves good husbands, if having such
a rich patrimony left unto us, we spend only on the stock, and seek not to
leave it somewhat augmented to our posterity after us. May we not say as it
there follows: Multum adhuc restat operis, multaque restabit, nec vlli nato
post mill secula praecludetur occasio aliquid adijciendi? There is yet a great
deal of this spiritual work unperfected, and so will be left by us to
after-generations, neither is it the current of a thousand years (should the
world so long endure) which shall prevent the last man of all occasions to
bring something to the perfecting hereof. Or be it that all things are already
found out of the ancient, in such complete manner, that they can admit no
additament, hoc tamen semper novum erit, vsus, et Inuentorum ab alijs scientia
et dispositio: this shall always be new and helpful in all ages, even the
use, methodicall disposition, and fit application thereof to the present times.

And this is that which we have specially endeavored unto in this business:
not so much to try what we could say more, as out of that small treasury that
God has put into our earthen vessels, to propose what we have, whether old or
new, in that method and form, which may be best and most handy to the readers
use. For this purpose, to the Argument, the use of the Psalm, and the
resolution thereof prefixed in a table, we have subioyned a Paraphrase with the
text, and quotation of other Scriptures serving for the explanation thereof,
noted in the margines: wherein so near as we could, we have endeavored to
express the meaning of the holy ghost, with his own more plain phrases and
speeches in other places; not so much studying to find out pleasant words, as
an upright writing, Eccles. 12. 10.
even the words of truth. Also to the explanation of the words, are annexed the
observation of doctrines with the several uses, that any one may see from what
fountain they flow, and how thence derived, And these are briefly set down
without any further enlargement, more then the quotations of proofs, out of
the holy Scriptures, and that to avoid tediousness, Pinedae praefat. in Io.
ca. 8. sect* 8.
because as one says, Ingenia non desiderant repletionem veluti vasa, sed
accendi volunt seu materia, quo vis inueniendi simul cum appetentia veritatis
incitetur. Men's wits do not crave repletion, as vessels, but rather a fit
matter to set on work their own invention, and to kindle in them a desire of
further searching after the truth.

Now for these three first Psalms, Psalm. 119. 130.
of them it may be said, as David elsewhere speaks of Gods word, that the
entrance into the same shows light, so these the very entrance to this book,
Aug. tract. 1. in Psalm. 68.
light and comfort. For whereas Adam dum raperet diuinitatem, perdidit
foelicitatem, while he proudly did catch after deity, to be like God in the
knowledge of good and evil, lost that felicity wherein he was made: so here
are we directed the means, how we may recover the same again, and this is,
rapere sanctitatem vt inuenia^ foelicitate^, even earnestly to seek to be like
God in holiness, 2. Pet. 1. 4.
and to be partakers of the divine nature, by flying the corruption that is in
the world through lust, so shall we indeed find true happiness.

And further, lest the opposition against Christ and his kingdom, and the many
enemies that we shall here meet withal, should either suddenly move us from
all stedfastnes, or draw us away with the error of the wicked, we may in the
second Psalm see Christ's kingdom by Gods will and power established, and the
enemies confounded; and also in the third, behold the Lords taking part with
his; and making theirs his own quarrel, maintaining his Church against their
hostility, defending his servants against their violence, and in the midst of
dangers compassing them with deliverances, that so with confidence, Deuteronomy. 33.
29.
and tranquilly of mind, they can repose themselves upon his aid, who is the
shield of their help, and the sword of their glory, subduing their enemies. To
these therefore do we send thee; to find here blessedness against thy
miseries, to seek safeguard against thine adversaries, to gather comfort
against thy sorrows, and to lay thee as it were asleep in godly security
against all terrors and fears.

And briefly for all the rest, Aug. confess. lib. 8. ca. 1.
as Augustine resorted to Simplicianus desiring him, vt proferret sibi
conferenti secum aestus suos, quis esset aptus modus ad ambulandum in via
Domini; so do you much more resort hither to this book: by these impart unto
God thy troubles, thine anguishes and boiling affections: by these he will
rejoice thy soul: put thy hand in frame, say to thy-passions as Christ did to
the sea, Mark. 4. 39.
(...), cease and be still, and there will be tranquillitas magna, a great
calm. For the Lords grace shall be with thee, Psalm* 32. 8. and 43. 3.
he will instruct and teach thee the way that thou shall go, he will guide
thee with his eye, and he will send forth his light and his truth, that he may
lead thee and bring thee into his holy mountain, and to his Tabernacle. As we
hope, so the Lord guide our hearts to the honoring of his name, to the love of
him, and the waiting for of Jesus Christ, Amen.

THE PSALMS OF DAVID.
The Preface to the Psalms.
THis is the title of the whole book: Of the title of the book.
and it may seem to be taken out of the 145. Psalm, which is thus entitled,
Tehillah le David. The Hebrews call it the book of Psalms, Sepher tehillim:
and so is it called by Christ himself, Luke 20. 42. It is called Tehillim,
that is, praises: for that this book contains manifold praises and
thanksgiving unto God. Yet not these things only, but also most singular
instructions, and doctrines of faith, spiritual exercises of prayer in all
manner of adversity, sound reioycings in the Lord, heavenly consolations to
afflicted hearts, prophecies, and divine predictions of Christ and his Church;
and all for the comfort and edification of Gods people. It has the title of
Psalms, for that these things herein contained were in the service of the Law
to be sung with musical instruments: whereupon the Greeks called the book a
Psalter, (...). They be counted David's Psalms, because the most of them are
his, though there be besides, many Psalms of other Prophets, and holy men.

By this title we may learn, What to learn from the title.
I. That the holy men of God gave themselves to laud God, and to set forth his
praises. II. That praises and thanksgiving are a special duty, and chiefly
commended unto us, since they bear the title of the book, before all the rest
of the things therein contained. III. That these Psalms are inspired by the
holy Ghost, because they were delivered unto the Church by the Prophets of God,
David and the rest. This is approved by Christ, alleging a saying out of one
Psalm, yet names the whole book, confirming to us the book of the Psalms,
Luke 20. 42.

Which book (as many think) was collected by Esdras, after the Jews return
from the captivity of Babylon: and it contains holy songs, written by holy
men of God unto the heavy and lamentable time of that wicked Antiochus. The
book divided into five parts two ways.
Some divide this whole book into five parts thus. The I. from the first
Psalm to the 42. II. from 42. to the 73. III. from 73. to the 90. IV. from the
90. to the 107. V. from the 107. to the end. Some other according to the penmen
(which the holy Ghost used, as they judge) divide them thus: I. To David 124.
viz. in order from the 1. Psalm to the 41. then 51. and so to the 72. then 86.
and 91. unto the 150. II. To the sons of Corah. 12. viz. 42. to 49. then 84.
to 88. III. To Asaph, 12. viz. 50. 73. to 79. then 80. 81. 82. 83. IV. To Ethan
the Esraite one, Psalm 89. and V. To Moses one, Psalm. 90.

And as the book consists of diverse parts, so the Psalms are not of one,
but of diverse kinds.

They be either simple or mixed: Psalms of diverse sorts.
these mixed may be referred to the diverse kinds of the former: which are in
number these twelve.

121. 129. 140. By the knowledge hereof may we have recourse unto such Psalms
as may best fit us, at any time according to our present state. The number of
the Psalms are well known to be 150.

The first Psalm.
THE ARGUMENT.
THis Psalm has no title: it is not ascribed to any penman, but is of the
holy Ghost, whosoever writ it. Before some Psalms is showed who was the penman
thereof, and not before some others. By which we may learn, that as the
Scribes of God are to be esteemed, and their persons to be taken notice of,
where their names be mentioned; so is the word of truth to be entertained,
without respect of inquiring after the penman, where the person is not
nominated.

This Psalm is as a preface and introduction to the rest, and is Didascalical,
The principal doctrine of this Psalm.
teaching this one maine truth; That a godly man is the only blessed man: whom
first he describes, that it may be known who is a godly man; And then he
proceeds to prove him the only blessed man: which he does, first, in respect
of himself, who is made prosperous in all that which he does: which happy
welfare is illustrated from a tree planted by the rivers of waters, etc. verse.
3. Secondly, in respect of another sort of men, which are the ungodly: for the
Psalmist makes only two sorts of persons, the one godly, and the other
wicked: the former he avouches to be blessed, but these not so, ver. 4. And
therefore is the godly the only blessed man. Thirdly, in respect of God, who
only cares for, loves, and approves the godly man: and therefore only he
must needs be happy.

The use of this Psalm.
THe use of this Psalm is, I. To hearten, stir up, confirm, and strengthen,
them that be godly, that they may persevere in a holy and religious course unto
the end. II. To grace and give honor to the godly, whom here the wicked in
their earthly prosperity, do account as base, vile, and wretched Caitiffs, and
themselves only to be the happiest men. III. To teach us to know a godly man
from the ungodly, and the lively difference between them, that so we may
adhere too, and joy in the fellowship of the one, and fly the company of the
other. IV. To show what is true blessedness, wherein it consists, and who they
be that attain unto it. This fruit and benefit may be reaped from this short
Psalm full of doctrine, and full of true consolation.

The resolution of this Psalm.
This Psalm contains these two parts: 1. A twofolde description. 1. Of the
happy estate of the godly in regard of two things. 1. Of his piety, set down
1. Negatiuely in avoiding sin, and al ye degrees thereof, as to Walk in the
Counsel of the Ungodly. Stand Way Sinners. Sit Seat Scornful, verse. 1.
2. Affirmatively for their exercise in Gods law: which is 1. Delight. 2.
Meditation, ver. 2.

2. Of his prosperity, described by the similitude of a tree, to which the
blessed man is resembled, and that in three respects: 1. Of plantation. 2. Of
fruitfulnes. 3. Of perpetual flourishing, verse. 3.

2. Of the infelicitie of the wicked, set down two ways. 1. Priuatiuely, they
are not so as the godly, neither for piety, nor true prosperity, verse. 4. 2.
Positiuely, by showing what they be two ways: 1. By similitude, they be as
chafe, which notes three things: 1. Their unprofitableness. 2. Their lightness
and vanity. 3. Their fearful end, scattered from the earth, verse. 4.
2. By the consequent hereof, being as chafe, they shall not be able to endure
the trial, to stand in judgment, verse. 5.


2 A confirmation, showing the cause why it shall thus differently befall
these, and this is 1. Gods approouing and taking care for the godly, verse. 6.
2. His disallowing and forsaking the ungodly, verse. 6.


The general observations.
BLessed is, etc. This is gathered and concluded forth of all the Psalm: for
the holy Prophet meditating of the godly, and of the wicked, and rightly
judging of them both, breaks forth at length with this true conclusion, that
the only blessed man is the godly man. Blessed is the man (says he) that
walks not, etc. This collection made thus by the man of God in his holy
meditations, is prefixed before the rest, and first set down, The benefit of
the Psalms.
to show, as by a sign hung forth at the door, and entry into this holy
book. I. What entertainment the godly soul, traveling in this wilderness of
the world shall find herein, even comfortable refreshment in the knowledge of
true happiness. II. To allure all that consider but the very first word, to
read and study this book, which begins so comfortably. III. To teach us,
that blessedness is an encouragement to godliness. The Prophet therefore
propounds the reward, first to our minds, as the Crown to Conquerors: so
Psalm. 112. 1. and 119. 1. 2. and 128. 1. IV. To show what a sound conclusion
the Psalmist made upon his meditation, in comparing the godly and wicked
together in their lives and end. That the godly man is the blessed man. For we
must know (as is aforesaid) that although this be prefixed; yet it was the
conclusion of his meditation. From which we may learn this, that a mind well
informed, and truly comparing the godly and wicked together: cannot but with
this Prophet, conclude as he does: as also did David, Psalm. 73. and the godly,
Mal. 3. 15. 18. that not the wicked, be they here never so glorious, but only
the godly, are to be accounted happy, whatsoever their estate be in this
present world.

PSALM. I. VERSE. I.
Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly: Text.
nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.
Happy and thrice happy is that man, Paraphrase.
whosoever he be, that setting the fear of God before his eyes, does depart
from evil, Prou. 1. 10. 15 and 4. 14.
avoiding the fellowship of wicked men: Ephesians. 5. 11.
and though sinners do entice him, Psalm. 26. 4. 5.
yet does not consent, 1. Ioh. 5. 18. and 3. 9.
much less does accustom himself to evil, to make a practice of sin, or,
which is most fearful, to be a 1. Cor. 12. 3.
scorner of goodness* and as one expert and skillful in wickedness, to make it
his profession, to teach iniquity also unto others.

Blessed] The word is ashrei, Explanatio^.
and is the plural number, as if it were, said, blessednesses. It is
translated adiectiuely, happy, blessed, foelix, beatus, or aduerbially, well,
happily, blessedly, been, foeliciter, beat. It may be thus expounded: many
blessings to that man; or most happy is he; or succesfully well: or well fares
that man, etc. The consideration whereof affoordeth these doctrines.

That God bestows not one but many blessings upon the godly: Doct. 1.
Prou. 10. 6. Deuteronomy. 28. 2. 6. 1. Tim. 4. 8. Psalm. 68. 19. and 119. 1. 2. 3. and
128. 1. 4. and 112. 1. 2. 3. and 40. 5. Genesis 24. 1. and 49. 25. Psalm. 21. 3.

To consider hereby of Gods liberal hand to the godly, Use 1.
as he speaks in Malac. 3. 10. and Prou. 28. 20. to stir us up unto
godliness, as it did David, Psalm. 119. 5.

Comfort to such as be godly, Use 2.
for the many blessings which they may expect at the Lords hands: Deuteronomy. 28. 1.
Tim. 4. 8.

That many blessings are to concur together, Doct. 2.
to make a man a blessed man. Therefore does the Psalmist here use a word in
the plural number: Prou. 21. 21. and 2. 9. Romans 2. 10.

To know what are those many blessings, Use.
by which we may become blessed, and to labor for them, crying as Esau, but
yet with better grace unto our heavenly father so to be blessed of him.

That man] Ha, Explanatio^.
is put emphatically, ha-ish, that man, which is a singling out of some
special person, (yet so one, as all of that sort is to be therein
comprehended) to whom ashrei beatitudines, many blessings do belong, that is,
such a man, as is here meant in this Psalm, even the godly and religious man.
Hence we may learn,

That man, Doct. 1.
as he is a man, is not the blessed man: but as he is ha-ish, that man,
qualified with virtues, and heavenly graces, as these places do show: Psalm. 2.
12. and 32. 1. 2. and 34. 9. and 41. 2. and 65. 5. and 84. 6. and 112. 1. and
128. 1. 2.

Not to judge our selves blessed as we be men, Use.
but as we be virtuous, and religious; such as the Psalmists in all these
forenamed places, do describe men to be, whom the Lord accounts blessed.

That the godly man, Doct. 2.
which is here understood in Ha-ish, is the happy man. These places considered
together, prove it: Luke 11. 28 Deuteronomy. 28. 17. Psalm. 9. 17. and 37. 37. Matthew.
25. 34. 41.

To account therefore the godly blessed whatsoever their estate be. Use 1.


This is to condemn the blindness of the worldlings, Use 2.
who cannot judge so of the godly, to esteem them blessed, but such as be like
themselves. Mal. 3. 14. 15.

Man] ^sh, Explanatio^.
put for man and woman or for mankind, Hos. 11. 9. it is used indefinitly,
Exodus 2. 1. 1. King. 20. 20. Leuit. 20. 2. Hos. 2. 10. The Septuagint translate
it by (...), which is common to man or woman. The doctrine is,

That every one that is godly, Doct.
without any respect of person of what age, sex, state, degree, kindred, or
nation soever is blessed: Act. 10. 34. 35. Gal. 2. 28.

Comfort to the godly that they are blessed, Use.
be they whatsoever otherwise, lew, Gentile, man, woman, bond, free, rich,
poor, etc. For in these things before God there is no difference: Col. 3. 11.
1. Cor. 7. 19. Gal. 3. 28. and 6. 15. 16.

That, Explanatio^.
etc.] Here the Psalmist begins to describe this Ha-ish, the blessed man; that
we may not mistake him, but understand rightly, his judgment of a blessed man,
and whom he holds so to be, and to this point he leads us by a true
description of him, as it were by a line, to the lively view of such a one:
Hereby teaching,

That a wise and prudent teacher (as this Psalmist here) endeavors to guide
aright the judgment of his hearers, Doct. 1.
unto the true understanding of that which he delivers; lest his words of a
blessed man be mistaken, he expounds the same fully.

Teachers herein ought to follow this holy Prophet, Use.
making plain the doctrine of truth unto their auditorie, that the point in
hand be not mis-understood: we must be as Nathan to David, 2. Sam. 12. 1. 7.
and as the Prophet unto Achab: 1. King. 20. 39. 42.

That by a true description of a blessed man, Doct. 2.
our judgments may be rightly informed, to know who is indeed blessed, who
are not. The Psalmist here, and every where, by description sets out to us
this blessed man, so to know him: Psalm. 112. 1. and 128. 1. 2. and 119. 1. 2. 3.

To know a blessed man, Use.
find out the description of him, as he is in the holy Scriptures laid open
before us, hereby shall we judge rightly of our selves and of others, and not
erroniously account those blessed, that be rather accursed, nor those cursed,
which are indeed truly blessed.

In describing the blessed man, Explanation.
the Prophet does set out his godliness: but yet does not rest in general
terms, he lays him open in the several parts thereof, particularizing his
piety, and religious practices. By this, teaching

That a blessedman in the Lords sight, Doct. 1.
is to be found by his godliness. For before is proved, that the godly man is
the blessed man.

This confuteth their error, Use.
and condemns their practice, who seek in, and by worldly honor, pleasure,
profit, natural gifts, arts, knowledge of tongues, or in and by, the
compounded habit of moral virtues, to become blessed, and not by true
godliness.

That godliness does not stand of generalities, Doct. 2.
but of certain distinct parts, in which he that is godly does exercise
himself: as here the Psalmist plainly teaches, and so in Job. 1. 1. 8. and 2.
3. so Act. 10. 2. and Luke 1. 6. Genesis 6. 9.

To be held godly, Use.
show forth the parts of godliness, the general in specials, the whole in
parts, as the godly be in holy writ commended, according to the forenamed
Scriptures.

Therefore hereupon may be concluded: Doct. 3.
That where at least the maine and principal parts of godliness are not
practiced, there is not true godliness it self.

Consutation of such, Use.
as vainly do conceit themselves to be godly: and yet examine the parts, and
there shall be found none.

Blessed is that man] These words, Explanatio^.
as they are to be considered with the third verse and sixth, setting out the
reward of this godliness, so also to be conjoined with the words immediately
following in this 1. and 2. verses thus: That man is blessed that has not
walked, etc. To teach us,

That a man is blessed as well in his graces, Doct.
and practice of godliness; as in the benefits and comforts, wherewith the
Lord rewards him in mercy for the same. For else why are men said to be
blessed, because they be godly? Luke 11. 28. Psalm. 119. 1. 2. Matthew. 13. 16.
Psalm. 34. 8. and 40. 4. and 106. 3.

To hold our godliness, Use 1.
to be the first and principal part of our blessedness here, and that other
things are only the rewards thereof for greater encouragements to well doing.
Deuteronomy. 28. 1. Tim. 4. 8.

A reproof to such, Use 2.
as only think themselves then blessed, when they with profession of
religion, enjoy peace, and outward prosperity; when they also are blessed, who
suffer for their profession: Matthew. 5. 10. 11. 1 Pet. 4. 14.

Walks not] In the description of a blessed man's godliness, Explanatio^
the Psalmist shows, both what he does not, and what he does: but in the
first place, what he does not. By this may we learn,

That the practice of piety stands of two parts: Doct.
viz. the leaving of that which is evil, and the doing of that which is good.
This are we taught, in Isai. 1. 16. 17. Psalm. 34. 14. and 37. 27. Ephesians. 4. 22.
23. 1. Pet. 2. 1. Act. 26. 18.

To join these two together as inseparable companions, Use 1.
in one profession of piety.

A confutation of such as verily think themselves religious if they leave
evil, Use 2.
(if so they could indeed) though they do no good. But consider these places:
Mat. 3: 10. Luke 13. 7. Mat. 25. 42. Isai. 59. 4. Ier. 5. 28. and 9. 3. and 1.
17. Judge. 5. 23. and 21. 5. 10.

A reproof to such as do pretend well doing, Use 3.
yet are not reformed: of such speaks Esaias in chap. 58. and Solomon in Prou.
30. 11. but mark the exhortation in 2. Tim. 2. 19.

That the first part of religion is the leaning of evil. Doct. 2.
Tit. 2. 11. 12. Luke 1. 74. 75. Psalm. 119. 32. Let us therefore leave
wickedness, before we go on to practice goodness: else our labor will be in
vain, our service not acceptable to God: Esai. 1. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. Prou. 3.
7. 8.

Walks not. Explanation.
Or, does not walk. Here in this word is an act, noting an outward and visible
conversation: so in the word not stand, not sit: to note unto us,

That a godly blessed man, Doct.
does not only in judgment disallow, and in affection hate evil, but does
outwardly in his practice avoid the same: Prou. 14. 16. Psalm. 119. 101.

Therefore let us not only inwardly condemn and dislike of evil, Use.
but also outwardly eschew it and depart therefrom: Prou. 2. 7. as we may see
the godly do: Prou. 16. 17. and 14. 16. Psalm. 119. 101.

Walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Text.
nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful.

The Psalmist in this first part of the description of a godly man's
conversation, Explanation.
makes a threefold gradation, in a triple respect; to which, as to general
heads, may be reduced all the sorts of the wicked, all kinds of sin, and
every manner of sinning, with the progress therein. From this gradation may we
learn:

That there be degrees of wicked men, Doct. 1.
all not alike wicked, either for matter or manner, noted in these words,
ungodly, sinners, scornful: Gal. 6. 1. Esai. 31. 6. Ezekiel. 16. 46. 47. 51.

Not to judge of all alike, Use.
but to learn to discern of the wicked one from another: for some sin of
infirmity, other maliciously, as Scribes and Pharisees against Christ; some of
ignorance, is some Jews, Acts 3. others of envy, and premeditating thereof,
and therefore are not to be dealt alike with: Jude verse. 22. 23.

That there are degrees of sin, Doct. 2.
noted in these words, counsel, way, seat, 1. Ioh. 5. 16. 17. Psalm. 19. 12.
13. Ezekiel. 23. 43.

To know that there may be a progress in wickedness, Use.
to take heed of the beginnings thereof, that we come not to the height.

That there be degrees in the manner of sinning, Doct. 3.
expressed in these words, walks, stands, sits, the former Scripture in
the two other doctrines, do show this, being compared together.

To consider in our falls how we have offended: Use.
for thereafter are we to be humbled: and from hence also may there arise some
hope of mercy to comfort the afflicted soul of the penitent, when with S.
Paul they know they sinned of ignorance through unbelief, and not maliciously.

The blessed man here is said to avoid all these: Explanation.
he walks not, nor stands, nor sits with these wicked ones: to teach us,

That a godly blessed man eschueth all sorts of wicked persons, Doct.
all kinds of sin, and manner of sinning: Psalm. 26. 5. and 31. 6. and 119.
115. Ierem. 15. 17. Psalm. 101. 3. and 45. 7. 8. and 119. 101.

To endeavor to fly from (if thou would be held godly) all the sorts of
wicked men: Use 1.
Prou. 4. 14. and 1. 15. Psalm. 119. 115. and from all kinds of sin, hating
all false ways: Psalm. 119. 104. 128. and to fear to sin in what manner
soever. It is a part of a godly man's blessedness.

A reproof to such, Use 2.
as make no conscience to converse with the wicked, as Psalm. 106. 35. for
pleasure, for profit and advancement to marry with them, to live in some
pleasurable, or some gainefull sin; to sin in secret, though not openly,
etc. contrary to Psalm. 55. 1. Revel. 18. 4. 2. Cor. 6 14. Exodus 23. 32. Psalm.
119. 115.

Walks not in the counsel of the ungodly. Explanation
] These words are the first in the negative part, and the lowest in the
gradation, touching the evil men, their sin, and manner of sinning; yet are
such termed wicked and ungodly, showing

That even the lowest rank of such as be not godly, Doct.
may be accounted wicked, or ungodly, till they amend. Ezekiel. 33. 8. 9. and 18.
21. 27.

To be contented to carry this title, Use.
till thou be repentant. For God has set it upon thee by his Prophet, and
here the lowest degree of evil men are so called.

The word (rashang,) Explanation.
translated by some wicked, by others ungodly, by the septuagint, (...). It
signifies, one unstable, restless, and ungracious: teaching,

That men unreformed, Doct.
naturally through this corruption are restless, without peace in themselves,
disturbers of others, and as the raging seas. Pro. 4. 16. Esa. 57. 20. 21.

To take knowledge of this our unpeaceable nature, Use.
and to bewail the same. For hereby are we rashang, even condemned persons,
to whom this term is given. Psalm. 109. 7. Job 27. 7.

Counsel is ascribed here to the ungodly, Explanation
in these words, the counsel of the ungodly: whence we may observe,

That the wicked and ungodly have their counsel, Doct.
2. Sam. 16. 20. Numb. 31. 16. 2. Kings 6. 8. Matthew. 12. 14. Ierem. 18. 18.
Hest. 3. 1. Sam. 22. 9. Dan. 3. after which also they do walk, as the places
do prove, and stir up others thereunto, Prou. 1. 11. 1. King. 21. 7. 2. Sam.
16. 21.

To take heed therefore of them, Use.
and to learn to be wise as Serpents, and innocent as Doves, as our master
teaches. Matthew. 10. 26. and be not counseled by them. Proverbs. 1. 10.

The word gnatsah, Explanation
signifies the counsel decreed by deliberation, as the counsel of
Achitophell. 2. Sam. 16. 23. where the word is used, teaching

That evil men are wise to do evil, Doct.
and can advisedly proceed. Ier. 4. 22. see more, Psalm. 2. 2.

Therefore to pray with David against their wisdom and crafty policy, Use.
that God would confound it, as in the 2. Sam. 15. 31. for he can overthrow
their devises, Nehem. 4. 15. Psalm. 33. 10. Ioh. 5. 12. Esa. 41. 11. -- 16.

Walks. Explanatio^.
] so stand and sit, is here put indefinitely, for time past, present, and to
come, and do note a continued action, for that here is a general doctrine,
and not an historical narration. And to walk in the counsel of any, is
either to do as they advise, 2. Chron. 22. 3. 4. 5. or to imitate them, Mich.
6. 16. here it is said that the blessed man walks not in the counsel of the
ungodly. Hence we learn,

That a godly man is not to go to take wicked men's advise, Doct.
neither is he to be a follower of them, his conversation is not framed after
their counsel. Job. 21. 16. and 22. 18.

Reproof to those that do fashion themselves, Use.
to the wills and pleasures of wicked men, like those mentioned in 2. Chron.
22. 3. 4. 5. and yet would be judged godly and religious, but consider,
Romans. 12. 2. Psalm. 15. 4. Iam. 1. 27.

To walk properly, Explanatio^.
speaking of the body, is to set footing and to go forward, figuratively, it
is put for conversation of life, touching faith and works. Psalm. 118. 1. and
119. 1. Genesis 5. 24. compared with Hebr. 11. 5. 6. 2. Pet. 2. 10. Jude verse. 11.
A godly man thus walks not in the counsel of the wicked: teaching hereby,

That albeit a godly man may slip aside, Doct.
1. Kings 8. 46. Job. 15. 14. and be suddenly moved by the counsel of the
ungodly, yet he sets not footing still to go forward, to make it his whole
course to live and continue therein: as the falls and rising again of all the
godly do prove, and Romans. 7. 19. Galat. 5. 17.

To consider of the falls of the godly, Use 1.
and the ungodly, and to make a difference between them.

To tell us that though we do fall, Use. 2.
and slp aside, yet may we not continue in evil, for that the godly do not,
but walk with God. Genesis 5. 22. and 6. 9. and 17. 1. 1. King. 3. 6. Esa. 38. 3.
It is an Elimas the child of the Devil, and one full of mischief, that will
not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord. Acts. 13. 10.

Nor stand in the way of sinners. Explanatio^.
] This is the next gradation touching the rank of evil ones in the degree of
sin, and manner in sinning, and the second branch of the negative part: by
this we may learn,

That he that becomes a sinner, Doct.
and stands in their way, is entered farther into the kingdom of the Devil,
than those that walk in the counsel of the wicked.

To search into our estate, Use.
and to consider into what a degree of sin we are fallen: to work in us the
greater humiliation, fear, and repentance.

Sinners. Explanatio^.
] These are in an higher degree of evil than the rest called ungodly, or
wicked: Hence observe,

That there are not only such as be wicked, Doct.
(as are all by nature) but which may also be called, and accounted sinners.
Genesis 13. 13. 1. Sam. 15. 18. 1. Tim. 1. 9. Mat. 26. 45. For men may be
distinguished by names, as they rank themselves in sin.

To be contented to be called as thy course does deserve: Use.
as men will be deeper in sin, let them look for a greater disgrace, and
titles answerable thereunto. Esaias. 1. 10. Amos 4. 1. Zeph. 3. 3. Acts. 13. 10.
Ierem. 9. 2.

The word Chataim, Explanatio^.
coming of Chata, to err out of the way, here translated sinners, is meant
enormious persons, viciously given, so as they are reputed vile, as the word is
taken 1. King. 1. 21. and to such is this name given, Psalm. 26. 9. and 104.
35. Mat. 9. 10. 13. and 11. 12. and 26. 45. Luke 5. 30. and 7. 37. and 19. 7.
John 9. 16. 31. by this may we learn,

That these are to be counted sinners, Doct.
who err from the way of well-doing, and so give themselves to evil, as they
become vile, the places in the explanation prove this.

To discern a difference between having of sin, Use.
1. Ioh. 1. and to be a sinner: all have sin, but all are not accounted
sinners, opposed to them that are good, Eccl. 9. 2. in this respect, they that
are born of God, are said not to sin. 1. Ioh. 3. 9. They live not in a trade or
way of sinning; they perhaps may step at unawares, but not walk: stray, but
not stand; stumble unwillingly, but not sit down wilfully in wickedness; of
weakness they may turn aside a little, but they are not workers of iniquity,
but walk in the Lords ways. Psalm 119. 3.

The way of sinners. Explanation
] As counsel was given to the wicked, so here way to the sinners, to show.

That as wicked have their counsel, Doct.
so sinners have their way: of which read, Proverbs 2. 12. 13. 15. and 12. 15.
and this Psalm. 1. 6.

Learn to know their way to avoid it. Use.
Psalm. 119. 29. 101. 104. 128. whether it be their way in doctrine and
religion, or of life and manners, for the word way is thus large in
signification and use. Genesis 6. 12. 1. King. 15. 34. 2. King. 8. 27. Ier. 2. 23.
and 3. 21. and 10. 2. 3. and 26. 3.

The word derech, Explanation
way, properly is a common trodden path, or trackt. Genesis 49. 17. it is also used
figuratively, for an usual custom, Genesis 31. 34. so for a common course of
living, whereunto any are accustomed, and daily do tread in, teaching,

That the way of sinners is a common road, Doct. 1.
and a beaten tract of sinning; or the custom of sin is their ordinary course.

To separate from their fellowship, Use.
for they cannot but do wickedly. Prou. 4. 16.

That this custom of sinning, Doct. 2.
is a degree of wickedues, it is here in the second place.

To take heed of accustoming our selves to sin, Use.
and pray as David does, Psalm. 119. 133. and consider the words of Jeremy,
chap. 13. 23.

Their course is called a way: Explanation
to inform us,

That by their life and conversation, Doct.
as by a way, they may know, to what place they are going, up to heaven, or
down to hell.

By our lives and conuersations to judge of our future states, Use.
for thereafter shall we be rewarded. Romans 2. 6. Prou. 24. 12. 2. Cor. 5. 10.
Gal. 5. 21. 23.

Stand. Explanation
] The word gnamad, properly signifies to stand immovable. Psalm. 33. 11. as
one that has pitched his tent, to dwell there; figuratively it is put for the
setlednesse of the affection, and the hearts resolution, Psalm. 122 2. according
to that, Gal. 5. 1. though the wicked do thus, yet the blessed man here is
said, not to stand in the sinners way, and custom of sinning: learn

That the sinner is resolved to do evil, Doct. 1.
Ierem. 44. 16. and will not be removed. Example, Elies sons; Jeroboam, Cain,
Pharaoh. Exodus 5. 2. 3. Pro. 27. 22,

Take heed of resolving to live leaudly; Use.
it is the property of the sinner, the sign of a reprobate heart, and
desperate madness: consider. Prou. 29. 1. and 28. 14. Leuit. 26. 14. -- 21.
27. 41. Es. 9. 13. 14. 15.

That a blessed man, Doct. 2.
is not of a settled affection, resolved to pitch his standing in a custom of
sinning with wicked sinners: he may slide, and fall, but resolves not to
sin. For a David is purposely resolved to keep Gods Law, and applies his
heart thereunto. Psalm. 119. 112.

Stand not in the way of sinners, Use.
if thou would be held godly; for though the prodigal son fall, yet he
settles not himself in wickedness, but coming to himself, he resolves to
change his course. Luke 15. 18. Yea when David does consider his ways, he will
turn his feet unto the Lords statutes. Psalm. 119. 59.

Nor sit in the seat of the scornful. Explanation
] The third degree of evil ones, sin and manner of sinning, and the last
branch of the negative part, by this we may learn.

That there are scorners. Doct. 1.
Prou. 1. 22. and 9. 7. 8. and 14. 6. and 13. 1. and 22. 10. Luke 16. 14. 2.
Pet. 3. 3. Mat. 27. 34. 41.

Look to find such as will be deriders and mockers at goodness, Use.
scorning reproof, and making a jest of godly simplicity. Of mockers we
read, Genesis 21. 9. Acts. 17.

Mat. 26. 68. Act. 2 12. 2. King. 2. 22. Iere. 20. 7. Heb. 11. 36.

That these scorners are the worst sort of evil persons: Doct. 2.
A man is wicked by nature; a sinner, by custom and often practice of sin:
but a scorner is so, through hardness of heart, and contempt of religion,
Septuagint translate it by, (...) a pestilent person.

You scorners know your selves to be the grandchildren of the devil, Use.
and consider your end: Prou. 1. 22. 26. 27. and 9. 12. and 19. 29. and 3. 34.
Esai. 29. 20.

The word letsim, Explanation.
translated scorners, signifies such as be arrogant cauillers at words and
deeds, crafty, cunning to do evil, hating rebuke, malicious, deriding holy
exercises in words, gesture, countenance, etc. Hereby may we be informed to
know scorners.

That they be such, Doct.
as out of pride, hate rebukes, cavil at words and deeds, mocking at
godliness, contemning reformation, taking liberty to sin, making light of
Gods judgments, and do securely bless themselves. Places compared and
examples show this truth: Prou. 1. 22. and 13. 1. 2. Chron. 36. 16. Luke 16.
14. Esai. 28. 14. 2. Pet. 3. 3. 4. Jude verse. 18. Pro. 9. 7. 8.

Hereby learn to discover scorners: Use.
note also their vildnesse, to detest their sin, that we may not be like unto
them. And for this read Pro. 1. 22. and 9. 8. and 13. 1. and 21. 11. and 22.
10.

The seat of scorners. Explanatio^.
] As before counsel was ascribed to the wicked, and way to sinners: so a feate
to scorners. Seat, is properly taken for a place to fit in: 1. Sam. 20. 25
Job. 29. 7. figuratively for authority, Matthew. 23. 2. This shows,

That the course of scorners is unalterable, Doct. 1,
and their persons incorrigible: Prou. 13. 1. and 9. 8. for they take
authority to sin, as controllers, not be controlled.

Not to rebuke them, Use.
lest they hate thee, they will not hear thy rebukes, as the places show: for
they take pleasure in scorning, Pro. 1. 22. they are as the blackmoore, Iere.
13. 23. and as Ahab that sold himself to commit wickedness, 1. King. 21. 25.

That these wicked wretches, Doct. 2.
yet quick witted, often get the seat of authority with evil Princes: Ose.
7. 5. see it in Zedkiah, Pashar, and Amaziah.

To bewail this corruption in the world, Use.
in which, cursed scorners hated of God, yet get the seat among men.

That the scorners sinning, Doct. 3.
is made here the highest degree of sinning in this gradation. Counsel, is the
error, and misleading of the mind: way, the defilement of life; but seat, and
therein sitting, the height of both. One says: Ambulare, est humana
fragilitatis; stare, peruersae voluntatis; but in cathedra sedere, cordis
obdurati malignitatis.

Scornful men, Use.
learn hereby the nature of your sinning: if your will be the deepest in
transgression, your plagues shall be answerable in the day of judgment, when
God will reward every one according to his doings: Romans 2. 6. 2. Cor. 5. 10.
Pro. 24. 12.

Nor sitteth] This is spoken of the godly blessed man, Explanatio^.
that he sits not in the seat of the scornful. To sit, is to abide,
continue, and dwell: Psalm. 2. 4. and 101. 6. 7. and 132. 14. or to company
with, Psalm. 26. 4. 5. Seat, is further taken, for an habitation and dwelling,
Psalm. 107. 4. 7. and 132. 13. or for an assembly, Psalm. 107. 32. Hence we
learn,

That a godly man continues not with such wicked and evil men; Doct.
he does not familiarly company with them, neither joins himself to their
meetings: Psalm. 26. 4. 5. and 31. 6. and 119. 115. Iere. 15. 17.

This condemns them, Use.
which for fear, favor, hope of gain, or otherwise, can be content to be
companions with such, do frequent their meetings, and make one with them. But
it is a part of godliness, and of the godly man's blessedness (here noted) not to
sit in their seat.

VERSE. II.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord. Text.
And in his law does he meditate day and night.
THat is, Paraphrase.
he does indeed quite contrary, to wit, not only avoiding evil, with all the
steps and degrees thereof, with all occasions thereunto, but daily exercises
himself in Psalm. 101. 2. and 145. 2. Luke 2. 37. Acts 2. 46, and 10. 2.
good things. And howsoever the wicked make a sport, and a game of sin, Prou.
10. 23.
and cannot be merry except they have done some evil: yet this blessed man,
can solace himself in nothing but the holy Scriptures, the law of his God: And
these indeed do yield him such true Psalm. 119. 14. 16. 24. 72 and 112. 1. Ier.
5. 16.
delight, that they are the only subject of his thoughts, to be Psalm. 119. 15.
23. 148.
musing upon, as also of his words to be Psalm. 119. 46. 172. Pro. 10. 31
speaking of them continually.

Before is showed, Explanation. Doct.
what a blessed man does not, now what he does, and both conjoined to one
person, teaching

That a godly man, rests not only in leaving of wickedness: but he sets
himself forward, to the practice of goodness: Job. 1. 1. 8. and 2. 3. David
carefully avoided sin, Psalm. 119. 11. 133. but it was to keep Gods word,
Psalm. 119. 101. The godly are set out by their goodness. Cornelius, Act. 10.
2. Zachary and Elizabeth, Luke 1. 5. and 19. 8. Iam. 2. 25.

As we do leave evil, Use 1.
so let us endeavor to do well: it is our bounden duty, Psalm. 34. 14. Esai.
1. 16. 17. Psalm. 37. 27. Romans 12. 9. Of this further, see before, verse. 1.
toward the beginning.

Reproof to such as judge themselves good Christians by not doing evil, Use 2.
when yet they do not that which is good: but let such consider these places:
Judge. 5. 23. Matthew. 3. 10. and 25. 41.

But] This is a note of diversity, Explanatio^.
putting a difference of that which is before, and that which follows: by
this to note to us,

That a blessed man's course, Doct.
which he takes in hand, is differing from every course of all sorts of the
evil ones, whose ways he escheweth: See this in Jacob from Esau, David from
Saul, Michaah from Zedkiah, Jeremiah from Pashur, Joseph of Arimathea from the
other Elders, etc.

Let thy differing course which thou do practice, Use.
make thee to be discerned from the courses of the wicked, if thou would be
held, one leaving their ways: for it is not thy bodily leaving of their
company, that seuereth thee from the^: but thy contrary practices, in holiness
and righteousness.

His delight] Here the godly and blessed man's delight, Explanation.
is opposed to all that went before. As if he should say, he walks not in the
counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the
seat of the scornful; because his delight is upon another thing that is
better. Doctrine,

That the souls contrary delight in men, Doct.
causes one man's course, to be contrary to another man's. This is true
generally: so much more between the godly and wicked, whose delights so
gready differ, as here may be noted, also in other places of the Psalms and
Proverbs, in which their differing delights and courses are fully set down.

That we may differ in our courses, Use.
let us set our love and delight on good things, differing from the delights of
the wicked: for as our hearts are set, so will we meditate and practice. David's
delight was in Gods law, Psalm. 119. 14. 20. 24. 73. therefore he meditated in
them, Psalm. 119. 15. and refrained his feet from every evil way: verse. 101.
128.

The word Chephets of Chaphets, Explanation.
signifies to embrace with love; with good will, with a pleasurable love, and
an affectionate will and desire unto a thing: Esai. 62. 4. Genesis 34. 19. It is a
loving delight, or delightful love, and therefore are both read together,
Psalm. 119. 47. Hence observe,

That a godly man has his true delight and pleasure: Doct.
Pro. 29. 6. David speaks of great delight, Psalm. 119. 14. He daunced before
the Arc, 2. Sam. 6. 14. The wise men rejoiced exceedingly, Matthew. 2. 10. So
others, Act. 5 41. and 8. 39.

Therefore let us not think the state of the godly to be comfortless and
miserable, Use.
as the wicked imagine: for that they cannot know nor feel the godly man's joy;
because the godly delight in the Lord, Phil. 4. 4. Psalm. 64. 10. and in
goodness, 2. Chron. 6. 41. but not in the carnal pleasures of the world, as
the wicked do, Prou. 10. 23. and 14. 9. and 2. 14. which makes these to
speak evil of them, 1 Pet. 2. 12. and to wonder at them. 1. Pet. 4. 4.

Is in the law of the Lord.] Explanation.
Here is noted wherein a godly man is delighted, not in vanity, wickedness,
foolish books; not only in the laws of man, nor in the things of this life,
wherein the wicked take delight: but in the law of the Lord, that is in Gods
word, for it is put for the whole word of God, Psalm. 19. 7. Ioh. 10. 34. Iam.
1. 15. that is, the holy Scriptures, which is to us the word of God, and above
which we may not presume, 1. Cor. 4. 6. This here is opposed against the
counsel, way, and seat of evil men. From hence we may learn many things.

First, Doct. 1.
that a godly blessed man, is delighted in the holy Scriptures: he has a love
and desire to them: Psalm. 119. 16. 24. 35. 47. 77. Job. 23. 12. Psalm. 16. 10.
Deuteronomy. 33. 3.

To delight in the law of God; Use 1.
it is a part of a godly man's blessedness, and his property. Now what kind
of delight, and how great our joy and love should be thereunto, read Psalm.
119. 14. 54. 72. 97. 111. 117. See the motives hereunto in the same Psalm.
verse. 92. 104. 105. Pro. 2. 10. 16. and 8. 10. 11. and Romans 1. 16. and 10. 14.
Mat. 13. 44. Deuteronomy. 32. 47. Iosu. 1. 7. 8. Iere. 6. 10. 11.

Reproof to such, Use 2.
as take no delight in the holy word of God. Iere. 6. 10. but let such
consider, Psalm. 119. 150. 155. Ioh. 10. 27. and 8. 47.

Secondly, Doct. 2.
that therefore the word of God affoordeth pleasure and delight to the godly
man: Psalm. 119. 103. and 19. 10. Ezekiel. 3. 3. Revel. 10. 9. 10.

To labor to find this sweet and pleasurable taste of Gods word: Use.
for the saying of Solomon may be most truly verified upon Gods word, Pro. 16.
24. If we cannot perceive this excellency of the word, it is because we are
yet natural. 1. Corinthians. 2. 14.

Thirdly, Doct. 3.
that a godly man's piety and religion is not forced nor counterfeit, for the
word is joy and delight unto him. The word Chephets is voluptas and prompta
voluntas, Psalm. 111. 2. The Septuagint translate the words thus, (...).

This serves to condemn all those for hypocrites, Use.
timeseruers, and carnal people, who entertain religion of a custom, of
fear, for company; but not as the godly man, of a ready good will, Doct. 4.
out of a true delight therein.

That a godly man prefers this word of God before the counsel of the
ungodly, the way of sinners and seat of the scornful, all which he escheweth
for his delight heerin, Psalm. 119. 115 and by the power thereof is delivered
from them. Proverbs 2. 11. -- 16.

To prefer the holy word of the Lord before all men's devises, Use.
counsels, ways, and authorities: the godly man does so, and the word will
work this in thee, if ever thou do feel the lively efficacy thereof.

And in that law. Explanatio^.
] By Law as is aforesaid, is to be understood the whole Scriptures. viz.
Genesis. Gal. 4. 21. 22. Prophets. 1. Cor. 14. 12. Psalms. Ioh. 15. 25. it is
put for doctrine generally, Psalm. 78. 1. as the law of works and law of faith,
Romans 3. 27. Hence learn,

That the holy Ghost delivers the Scriptures in words sometime, Doct.
which may have diverse acceptions: instances are every where to be found.

To consider of the words of the holy writ, Use.
and not to take them rashly, but know first the variety of significations, and
the circumstances of the place, thereby to take thence the right meaning of the
words.

In that the Scriptures of God are called a Law, Explanatio^.
it may teach us,

That the word of God has a commanding power, Doct.
force, and authority, to govern and moderate, requiring obedience, as a law
of every one of the Lords people and subjects.

To entertain the word, Use.
and study the Scriptures, as a law, for thy guide and governance, and to
become thereunto obedient: otherwise to read them, is not to make a right use,
or to aim at the true end, for which the word was written: read Deuteronomy. 4. 10.
13. 14. and 30. 12. Psalm. 119. 33. 34.

The word Thorah, Explanatio^.
Law or doctrine, comes of jarah, to cast forth or to dart, and it implies
an orderly disposing of the doctrine. For in 2. Sam. 7. 19. the word is Law,
and in the 1. Chron. 17. 17. is disposition. Hence note,

That Gods word is an orderly manner of instructing, Doct.
and withal sharp and piercing. Eccles. 10. 11. Heb. 4. 12. Act. 2. 37.

Not to think the word to be immethodicall, Use.
and therefore to handle it too rudely: but to use it warily and wisely, as a
sharp too edged sword, piercing into the soul. Hebrews 4. 12.

Does he meditate. Explanation
] The word ichgeh of hagah meditate, is put indefinitely, has, does, and will
meditate, usually; the word imports study and exercise of the mind, which
often bursteth out into voice: it is used for musing in the mind and heart,
Prou. 24. 2. Esa. 33. 18. also for muttering with the mouth which the heart
minds. Psalm. 2. 1. and 37. 30. Prou. 8. 7. Esa. 59. 3. with a low and
imperfect voice, Esa. 8. 19. Learn,

That the godly which delight in the law, Doct.
do meditate, study, and exercise their minds in it, as David did, Psalm. 119.
15. 23. 97. 99. and 63. 6. yea, they will talk and speak of it. Ps. 37. 30.
31. Luke 24. 15.

To show our delight in Gods word, Use 1.
let us have our minds upon it, and speak thereof, Deuteronomy. 11. 19. 20. and 6. 7.
Psalm. 49. 3.

A reproof unto such as mind little Gods word: Use 2.
but delight in some other manner of learning, perhaps, and can speak thereof,
but out of Gods word little or nothing.

This condemns the folly and madness of Papists, Use. 3.
who will be held godly, and yet either very little, or not at all, study the
holy Scriptures. If these become godly they are such, as here the Psalmist
never dreamed of.

Day and night. Explanation
] By this saying he means continually, and here note, that the word day, is
not jom, but jomam, the last better, being added, to note a continuance of
days, by which speech we have commended unto us a godly man's meditation.

That it is, Doct.
first, frequent and often, Psalm. 119. 16. 164. being on the day time, and on
the night. Secondly, vigilant, he museth on the word, when others sleep. Psalm.
42. 8. and 77. 6. and 92. 2. and 119. 15. 62. Thirdly, fervent, Psalm. 119. 117.
Psalm. 39. 3. because in the day time no worldly occasions can withdraw his
mind, neither nights sleep cause him to forget it. Psalm. 119. 148. Fourthly,
Constant, because it is not said, a day and a night, but day and night. Psalm
119. 97.

To be frequent, Use 1.
vigilant, fervent and constant in our meditation on Gods word. Ios. 1. 8.
Psalm. 77. 6. Deutero. 6. 6. 7. 8.

This reproves; Use. 2.
First, the hypocrite, whose meditation is but perfunctory, and without
constancy; in adversity, but not in prosperity, etc. Secondly, the profane,
who meditate deceit, Psalm. 38. 12. mischief, Psalm. 36. 4. destruction, Pro.
24. 2. vain things and wicked, Psalm. 2. 1. Acts 4. 25.

VERSE III.
For he shall be like a tree, Text.
planted by the rivers of waters, that brings forth his fruit in due season,
whose leaf shall not fade, and whatsoever he does shall prosper.
AS if he had said, Paraphrase.
how can it therefore otherwise be, but that such a one should be most
fruitful in all Psalm. 112. 5. Acts 9. 35. 10 2
good works, and also Psalm. 112. 2. 3.
prosperous in all his ways? who cannot more fitly be likened to any thing,
than to a fruitful and green tree, (suppose the Psalm. 92. 12.
Palm or Psalm. 92. 8. Esa. 44. 4.
Olive, or such like:) For as such a tree being well husbanded, and planted by
the rivers of water, in a fruitful soil, Ier. 17. 8.
(where it needs not fear the year of drought, nor the heat when it comes)
does abound with seasonable and ripe fruit, and flourishes with neuer-fading
leaves, which the winter storms cannot cause to fall, nor the summer heat
make to wither: so this man much more, being John. 3. 5.
regenerated by God, and sanctified by his grace, and thus Psalm. 92. 13.
planted by his divine power, (the work of his spirit) in his Eden, the true
Church, and engraffed into his son Jesus, by the Ioh. 7. 39.
fountain of living waters, the sacred Scriptures, and effectual graces of
his sanctifying spirit, which he gives to every one that believes, cannot but
be Phil. 1. 11. Psalm. 92. 13. 14.
filled with the fruits of righteousness, which he yields opportunely, and
in very due time; and that not only once, or for a while, but Psalm. 119. 33.
111. 112.
perseuering in well-doing, he does continue unto the end, without fading
through adversity, or changing by persecution; God turning all things to the
best, and prospering him in all that he puts his hand unto.

The Psalmist sets out a godly man's blessedness, Explanation
as also the fruitfulness of his delight, and meditation in Gods law, and this
he does by a similitude, from a tree planted in a fruitful place, and
answerablie, in due season bringing forth fruit, hereby giving us to
understand,

That a godly man's blessed estate is not easily perceived, Doct.
or not so deeply considered of, as is worthy. Therefore is it here painted
out to the view of all, by this lively similitude. That the godly are not
esteemed after their worth, appears, 1. Cor. 4. 13. where they be called,
(...), filthes, and the off-scowring of all things.

To take a more serious and considerate view of the godly man's blessedness
(which the world indeed cannot truly take notice of) and mark how the Lord
sets him out, Use.
by godly comparisons in many places, which are considerately to be beholden,
as the pictures which God makes, painting out the godly man.

And he shall be like. Explanation
] The Psalmist might have set out the blessed man's condition without a
similitude, but the Lord hereby would show us,

That the minds of the godly can observe out of the works of God, Doct. 1.
that which may put them in mind of heavenly things, Psalm. 123. 2. and 125. 1.
2. and 128. 3. Eccles. 12, 2 -- 7.

Hereby let us learn so to look upon, Use.
and to consider of earthly things here, as thereby we may ascend up to
heavenly. Thus are the godly taught of God to do, but an unwise man knows
not this, Psalm. 92. 6.

That it is lawful to make resemblances, Doct. 2.
and likenesses between corporal and spiritual, earthly and heavenly things,
for our better instruction. Esa. 5. Psalm. 92. 12. Mat. 13. 3. 24. 31. 33. 44.
45. 47. Luke 13 6. and 15. and 18. Reuelat. 21. 10.

To use our liberty thus in teaching, Use.
wisely, and soberly, for the edification of the hearers. Christ Jesus the
chief shepherd, the Prophets, and Apostles, have used to teach by similitudes.

A tree. Explanation
] The word gnets signifies lignum aridum, Psalm. 74. 5. and is translated by
(...), which we call wood, a boule, a logge, but is also used for a green
tree. Genesis 2. and 3. and in this place; The kind of tree is not named, as in
Psalm. 92. 12. and Esa. 44. 3. but whatsoever it be, the comparison we see is
from a tree, not from fading grass, or such a weak thing, as a man naturally
is compared unto, Esa. 40. 6. Iam. 1. 10. 1. Pet. 1. 24. and so are the wicked,
Psalm. 37. 2. and 92. 7. but the godly are as a tree, teaching,

That the godly are solidly grounded, Doct. 1.
and stablished in their courses, as having taken deep root, Mat. 13. they are
as mount Sion, Psalm. 125. 1. Mat. 16. 18.

This serves to abate the spirits of wicked men who attempt to overthrow the
godly, Use.
but they meditate a vain thing, Psalm. 2. 1. for they are grounded and the
Lord will stablish them, as the Apostle prays, 2. These. 2. 17. and will
defend them. Esaias. 10. 16.

That they can endure heat and cold, Doct. 2.
blasts and shaking. Ier. 17. 8. Mat. 7. 25.

Labor then to stand fast, Use.
all that profess godliness; and consider, Pro. 24. 10. Mat. 7. 26. 27.

That their height ouertoppeth all the beasts of the field, Doct. 3.
that with their feet they cannot tread them down, that is, the power of the
wicked shall not prevail against them. Psalm. 68. 1. 2. 3. 17. 18. 20. 35.

Comfort unto the Church, Use.
and let not the godly fear their enemies: consider these Scriptures. Psalm.
46. 1. 2. 5. 10. 11. and 49. 14. and 97. 10. and 37. 13. 15. 17. and 29. 10. 11.

Planted. Explanation
] The word shathul is properly spoken of that which is removed from one place
to be set in another, Ezekiel. 17. 22. 23. showing,

That a godly man is not in his natural state and growth; Doct.
for by nature he is as others, gnets, lignum aridum, a dry logge or tree.
Ezekiel. 17. 24. flesh of flesh, Ioh. 3. 6. a child of wrath, Ephesians. 2. 3. but the
Lord has removed him from the state of corruption, and planted him in his
house, Psalm. 92. 13. that is, in the state of grace, and sanctification: thus
the Church is Gods plant, Esa. 5. 7.

Hereby let all natural men judge of their state, Use.
till they be removed thence, they are not to be accounted among the godly,
though they have never so great gifts of nature: they be not the trees of
righteousness, the planting of the Lord, Esa. 61. 3. but as fruitless trees,
in their proper soil of corruption.

That a godly man is so blessed, Doct. 2.
not by natures production, but by a spiritual plantation, in the state of
grace and regeneration by the Lords hand, Esa. 61. 3. and 60. 21. Ierem. 2. 21.
Romans 11. 24.

To acknowledge thankefully our grace, Use. 1.
and goodness, to be of God, and not of our selves; for it is he that works
will and deed, Phil. 2. 13. and makes barren and dry trees to flourish, Ezekiel.
17. 24. Esa. 44. 3. 4.

A confutation to such as exalt nature, Use. 2.
and man's power in his conversion, contrary to these Scriptures. Genesis 6. 5. and
8. 21. Ephesians. 2. 1. Phil. 2. 13. 2. Cor. 3. 5.

By the rivers of waters. Explanatio^.
] The word palge signifies the division of waters, it comes of palag, to
divide, and so may be translated brooks, becks, or as we may say, riueretts,
streams parted, Prou. 5. 15. 16. coming from a fountain, or head-spring,
Job. 29. 6. running in a pleasant valley: whether the waters come from above or
below: for Ma^m is the dual number, noting two sorts of waters, which this tree
has benefit of: from this similitude we may learn*

That a godly blessed man is planted in a pleasant and fertile valley, Doct. 1.
Ezekiel. 17. 5. as Adam in Paradise, Genesis 2. that is, in the house of the Lord,
Psalm. 92. 13. in spiritual Sion the joy of the whole earth, Psalm. 40. 2.

To judge the godly man's station most happy, Use. 1.
though it cannot be discerned with the mortal eye of man, in his natural
estate: but his place is so pleasant as the eye has not seen, etc. 1. Cor. 2.
9.

The godly to rejoice in their portion, Use. 2.
and in the lot of their inheritance. David desired to dwell in Gods house for
ever, so pleasant is that place: Psalm. 84. 1. 2. 4. and 27. 4. and 26. 8.

That a godly man is so planted, Doct. 2.
as he has the benefit of the spiritual waters: as the type shows, Ezekiel.
19. 10. Ierem. 17. 8. Now these spiritual waters, Ezekiel. 47. 1. -- are the
graces of Gods holy spirit, and the sacred Scriptures, of which we may read,
Psalm. 46. 4. Esa. 12. 3. and 55. 1. and 44. 3. Iere. 2. 13. and 17. 13. Zach.
14. 8. Ioh. 4. 10. 14. and 7. 38. 39. 1. Cor. 3. 6.

To labor to feel this benefit of the spiritual waters, Use 1.
as the tree does of other waters: to spread in the root, to be full of sap,
not to wither or to be dried up, for want of moisture: but to be green, and
flourishing.

This may show men how to judge of themselves, Use 2.
who are without the graces of Gods spirit, and without the ministry of the
word, they be no trees of Gods planting, they be without Christ, Romans 8. 9. and
in a perishing condition, Prou. 29. 18. but these waters cause life, Ezekiel. 47.
9.

A blessed godly man so partakes of these spiritual waters, Doct. 3.
as it is yet in measure: for he is not planted upon the full waters, but by
the division of waters: so every one receives according to his measure, 1.
Cor. 12. 11. Mat. 13. 23.

Every one to be content with his portion in heavenly things here: Use.
for none can in this life be perfect, and every member is to be so gifted,
as one may benefit another, and one stand in need of another.

That brings foorth] Iaten, Explanation.
will give, the future here, notes a continual act: it gives, that is, it
does bring forth freely, and is continually fruitful. Before is showed the
plantation, and watering, that is, our ingrafting into Christ, and
sanctification by the word and spirit, and here the fruit of both.

The godly planted by the Lord (as is said) are not barren trees, Doct. 1.
but fruitful, and so continue: Ezekiel. 47. 12. Ier. 17. 8. Ioh. 15. 5. Romans 7.
4. Psalm. 52. 8. and 92. 14. Revel. 2. 19. Mat. 7. 17.

To show forth the fruits of our plantation, Use. 1.
and ingrafting into Christ: such are fruitful, Ioh. 15. 3. 4. and such as
have truly tasted of the heavenly waters, Col. 1. 6. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 5. 6. 7. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 3. 2. Pet. 1. 8. called trees of righteousness, Esa. 61. 3. and 60.
21. fruitful seed, Matthew. 13. Mark. 4. 20. hereby God is glorified, Ioh. 15.
8.

This reproves two sorts: Use 2.
First, such as be fruitless in Gods house, Luke 13. 7. Ioh. 15. 2. Secondly,
such as a while are fruitful, but at the length do wither, not abiding in
Christ, Ioh. 15. 4. 6. Mat. 7. 18.

That planting, Doct. 2.
and that by the rivers of waters, goes before bringing forth fruit: that is,
the word, the spirit, and ingrafting into Christ, before fruits of godliness.
Ioh. 15. 4.

To judge hereby, Use.
the causes of men's unfruitful profession, they have not the effectual work
of the Spirit and word of God, neither are they in Christ, for then they should
be fruitful, Ioh. 15. 5. Romans 6. 5. and 8. 5. 11.

His fruit] His fruit, Explanation.
so called, as being the fruit of the plantation, not of it self, as it
naturally grew, for it has the proper fruit of the plantation, which is his
fruit: thus is it with the godly man: whence this doct.

That a godly man's fruit, Doct.
is not after the flesh, according to which he was borne, but after the spirit,
by which he was regenerated: Pro. 11. 30. Mat. 7. 17. 18.

To learn to discern of these spiritual trees by their fruits: Use 1.
for a good tree brings forth good fruit: Mat. 7. 17. 18. 20. Romans 6. 22. and
7. 4. 6. Gal. 5. 22.

Also to discern his fruits, Use 2.
as he is a man: from his fruits as he is a sanctified man, to wit, as a tree
planted by the heavenly rivers of waters.

In his season. Explanatio^.
] (...), in the opportunity of time, in the due and convenient season thereof,
so taken, Psalm. 104. 27. and 145. 15. Leuit. 26. 4. Eccles. 3. 2. Esa. 50. 4.
These words are not added to make any think, that good fruit is at any time
unseasonable, or that a man may use his liberty, to take his own time, to do
well when he list; but to commend a godly man's goodness. Teaching,

That a godly man's fruit is ripe fruit: Doct. 1.
it is done in judgment and truth, and not untimely, (as the hypocrites be,
and the vainglorious) according as is said, Psalm. 112. 5.

To learn to do good in mature deliberation, Use.
that it do not putrify and rot: as the untimely fruit of hypocrites, and
the vainglorious, which come not from a sanctified heart, as from them that are
ingrafted into Christ, whose fruit is durable.

That he does good in due time, Doct. 2.
when occasion fitly is offered, he takes it, as the good Samaritane, Luke 10.

To do good in season, Use 1.
when fit occasion is offered, Pro. 3. 28. for that is a good man's time, and
then is the fruit ripe, pleasant, profitable, and most acceptable.

Reproof to such, Use 2.
as have often occasion fitly offered, to show forth good fruits, and neglect
the same. They be not like the godly disposed Philippians, Phil. 4. 10. but
like Dives, that fruitless tree, or Nabal that churl.

His leaf also shall not wither. Explanation.
] By the tree is set out a godly man; by fruit, is to be understood his
godliness, and righteousness, in word and deed: and by leaves, may be meant
the outward beauty, and well managing of his holy profession, in his
countenance, gesture, and outward behavior, which be as pleasant green
leaves, beautifying his conversation before men. Hence note,

That one truly religious, Doct. 1.
is not a leafie tree without fruit, as the hypocrite, who is all in shows:
nor a fruitful tree without leaves, as the rash and headie person, wanting
discretion. For both leaf, and fruit, are here given to the godly man. So Ier.
17. 8. Ezekiel. 47. 12.

Not to be as the hypocrites, Use.
all in profession, and nothing in practice: nor to think, that it is enough,
to do bonum, and neglect been, a good thing may be marred in the making: the
word speaks of our face, Pro. 17. 24. of our words, Pro. 15. 28. and 16. 23.
and tells us of wisdom, and discretion, Pro. 19. 11. Psalm 112. and of
judgment in our courses, Pro. 13. 23. Hereby showing, that it is not enough to
do a thing, but to do it, as it ought to be done.

That such a one is ever green, never utterly destitute of spiritual moisture
and sap of grace: Doct. 2.
Iere. 17. 8. Ezekiel. 47. 12. Psalm. 92. 13. and 52. 8. Ioh. 10. 28. Phil. 1. 5. 6.

Consolation to the truly religious, Use. 1.
that they shall never wither away, Iere. 32. 40. 41. Ioh. 10. 28. Romans 8. 30.
not in the hot summer of persecutions, nor in the cold winter of a secure
carnal peace, nor in the lukewarm season, of a pleasing prosperous estate,
etc. God will not let his fade in grace, or fail of their duty wholly.

Instruction to strive to persevere in well doing, Use. 2.
Mat. 24. 13. Revel. 2. 10. Ezekiel. 18. 24. 2. Pet. 2. 21. not like Judas, Mat.
27. nor Herod, Mar. 6. nor Demas, 2. Tim. 4. 10. nor as the Angel of Ephesus,
Revel. 2. 4. but as Thyatira, Revel. 3. 19.

A confutation of those that hold that this planted tree may wither away; Use 3.
contrary to these Scriptures, Ierem. 32. 40. 41. Mat. 16. 18. Ioh. 10. 28.
Psalm. 37. 24. and 145. 14.

And whatsoeuer] The Psalmist speaks very largely of a godly man's prosperity:
Explanatio^.
teaching,

That there is a large extent of Gods goodness toward the godly. Doct.
Genes. 39. 2. 5. 23. 2. Sam. 5. 10. Deuteronomy. 28. 2. Chron. 32. 30.

To labor to be truly religious, Use.
sithen God does so bless his, which is most true, if we consider the end of
the godly, for all things tend to make their end happy. Romans 8. 28. Psalm 37.
37.

He doth] Neither before, Explanatio^.
nor yet after in this Psalm, (in which a godly man blessed, is described) is
any mention plainly of his speeches, but of his delight, meditation, and doing:
not that a godly man has not as well good words, as works, Psalm. 15. but to
teach us,

That a godly man is more to be measured, Doct.
and more certainly to be known, both to himself and to others, by inward
delight, and a mind set upon heavenly things, and by outward practices, then
by words, be they never so fair and glorious.

Therefore let us judge our selves, Use*
and others by our delight inwardly, and practices outwardly, in good things,
rather then by our tongues. It is neither profession, nor preaching, without
internal grace, and external fruits of piety, that can make us worthy the
account of sound Christians. Mat. 7. 21. 23.

Shall prosper. Explanation.
] Iatsliach, he shall make to prosper: being restrained to good things which
he takes in hand. We learn,

That a godly man is a cunning Artist in holy things: Doct.
they thrive in his hand. 2. Chron. 31. 21. Genesis 39. 2. Joseph was a man
that prospered, or as we say a luckie man.

To become a proficient in heavenly things, Use.
and to thrive spiritually by them, be a good man, and do that thou do
sincerely, as Hezekiah, so shall thou prosper, else thou will be (as we say)
but a bungler in good things.

If this prospering be referred to al things in general which he does,
Explanation
it must signify his good use he can make thereof, and so prosper thereby
toward God. For here is meant not the worldly, but spiritual prosperity.
Teaching,

That the godly man, Doct.
can (like a good husband) gain good to his soul, and prosper so in all his
doings, for so God instructs him. David and S. Paul show us this truth, if
we consider well of them.

Let us learn to be such heavenly good husbands in matters concerning our
souls, Use.
in all our doings to be rich toward God. This is one of the greatest points
of wisdom, to be able to make advantage to our souls of prosperity,
adversity, of health, sickness, of good and ill report, etc.

This third verse does teach, Explanation
wherein a godly man is blessed, by this similitude, and notes out the
particular branches thereof, showing,

That he is blessed. Doct.
First, in that he is planted. Secondly, that it is by the rivers of waters.
Thirdly, in being made fruitful, and that with good fruit seasonably.
Fourthly, by his green leaves, never fading. Fifthly, in his prosperous and
happy success, which by right belongs unto him: this God promises the godly
here, and Deuteronomy. 28. 2 -- 8.

To behold with comfort the particulars of Gods blessings to a godly man, Use
1.
thereby to judge of his happiness, and to strive to partake thereof with him.

To be provoked unto godliness: Use. 2.
for prosperity is promised for a reward: and the godly only have a right unto
it by promise. And if we enjoy not here prosperity; and that it go not well
with us, it is for that we do not well: and therefore God restrains us
here thereof, that we may not lose the perfection of happiness in the life to
come. Else he takes pleasure in his people. Psalm. 149. 4. He delights to
do us good, Ier. 32. 41. and desires our well-doing. Deutr. 5. 29.

To confute those that think it a vain thing to serve the Lord. Use. 3.
But let such consider, 1. Tim 4. 8. Psalm. 128. Genesis 29. 1. 2. Psalm. 119. 1. 2.
5. and remember, Mal. 3. 16. 17. 18. Psalm. 73. 17.

VERSE. IIII.
The wicked are not so, Text.
but as the chafe which the wind drives away.
NOw for the wicked and ungodly, Paraphrase.
their condition is most different, and opposite heereunto, as in regard of
their studies and affections, so of the success thereof also. They regard not
Gods Law, and God as little with his favor respects them. And howsoever for
a time they may seem to flourish like the Psalm. 37. 35.
green baye, or as a tree that grows in his own soil: yet being not Gods
planting, the root shall be Esa. 5. 24. Ier. 17. 6.
rottennes, and the same dry up like the dust, and they shall be even as
chafe it self, void of goodness and Hos. 13. 3. Job. 21. 8. Amos. 9. 9.
stability, being in their Psalm. 39. 5. 11.
best estate, altogether vanity, without durablenesse. For as the wind
seuereth the chafe from the corn, and disperseth it abroad; so shall the day
of the Lords wrath scatter them Zeph. 2. 2. and 1. 18.
abroad, and he shall make a speedy riddance of them, Explanatio^.
from off the earth.

Heeere the Psalmist makes the Antithesis between the Godly and the wicked:
to teach,

That a godly man's blessedness is better discerned, Doct.
by setting over against him in one view, the state of the wicked. Thus does
Solomon in many places of the Proverbs, cap 3. 32. 33. and 4. 18. 19. and 10.
3. and 12. 13. 21. So in Psalms 37. 9. 10. 11. 16. 17. 18. 20. 22. 28. 29. 37.
38.

To behold thus the godly and wicked together, Use.
hereby we shall better judge of them: to esteem highly of the godly, and to
neglect the wicked; to make us to continue in well doing, and to eschew the
paths of wickedness. This is a setting of life and death, blessing and cursing
before us, Deutr. 30. 19.

Not so the ungodly. Explanation
] Here Ha-rishangnim the lowest degree. verse. 1. is put for all three. Chataim,
sinners, and Letsim, scorners. Lochen non si^, notes an unlikeness between
the godly and ungodly: hence teaching,

That there is altogether a great difference between the godly and the wicked.
Doct.
The proof hereof are the places of the former doctrine. And also we may see
here, that what before is affirmed of the godly, is denied altogether of the
wicked.

To hold a great difference to be, Use.
between the wicked and godly; for that which is said truly of the one (not as
a man, but as a godly man) is denied to the other, (not as a man, but as a
wicked man.) It is godliness, and ungodliness, which makes the difference
which is here spoken of.

In taking these words (not so) and applying them to all that which is said of
the godly, Explanatio^.
not to be so to the ungodly: would afford many doctrines.

1. Doct. 1.
That a wicked man (whatsoever he be) is not blessed. Ps. 11. 5. 6. and 37. 38.
Prou. 2. 22. Matthew 15. 41. Psalm 9. 17.

To pull down the proud conceit of the wicked, Use.
living in pleasure and prosperity: they must know that yet they are not to be
accounted blessed.

That the wicked are not planted, Doct. 2.
but remain in their natural standing, though^ they be in the Church, yet
are not of it; Like Simon Magus, Ananias and Saphira, Hymenaeus and Alexander,
and such like.

So long as men live unreformed, Use.
never to hold them to be plants of the Lord, which are trees of
righteousness. Esa. 61. 3. but counterfeit, or rotten members, unfruitful
trees, which one day shall be cut down, and cast into the fire, Mat. 3. 10.
and 7. 19. Luke 13. 7. 9. John 15. 6.

That they have no linely root, Doct. 3.
nor do feel the saving operation of the rivers of water, as the godly do.

To judge our selves to be godly, Use.
or not so, as we take root in righteousness, and benefit by the word, and
power of Gods holy spirit: these sprituall waters of life.

As in these is showed, Explanation
that the wicked are otherwise then the godly: so the like may be noted out of
the rest: which here only is briefly set down.

That they be fruitless in good works. Doct. 4.
That which they do is rotten and untimely fruit. 5.
They in time wither for want of root, 6.
and moisture. Goodness prospers not with them; 7.
or, in the end they shall be known not to be prosperous. Ps. 5. 5. Job. 21.
18.
To discover by all these, Use.
who are to be judged wicked: and if we do find our selves hereby among them,
let us depart from the tents of these wickedmen, lest partaking of their sins
we receive of their plagues also.

But are. Explanation
] Before is showed what they are not, now is noted what they be.

True judgment is a certain affirming what a thing is, Doct.
and not only a denying what it is not: or, it is not enough to know what the
wicked are not, but also what they be.

Look to the well informing of our judgments; Use.
for sound knowledge can positiuely set down the tenent held.

Like. Explanation
] Here the Psalmist sets out the ungodly men, as before he did the godly
man, by a similitude; to teach us --

That the ungodly man's wretched and miserable estate, Doct.
is not easily discerned: and therefore here it is illustrated by a
similitude, and David acknowledges this, Psalm. 73. 16.

Not to consider superficially or slightly of the wicked men's estate: Use.
but seriously to take view thereof, by this and such like similitudes,
painting them out in lively colors: else if we behold them according to their
outward worldly and transitory glory, we shall be much deceived, and greatly
tempted, as was Jeremy, cap 12. David. Ps. 73. and others, Mal. 3.

Chafe. Explanatio^.
] Mots signifies chafe, or any light and contemptible thing: the Septuagint
translate it by (...), which is dust, as well as chafe. So are they compared;
also note, that in speaking of the wicked, and comparing them, he speaks
plurally, as understanding all: but of the godly he speaks singularly, in
one, to know them all. Teaching,

That one godly man is of more account with God, Doct. 1.
then all the wicked, as much as one godly fruitful tree, is better than all
chaffie dust, or dusty chafe in the world. See this in Gods favor to Noah
alone, among a world of wicked men. Genesis 6. So to Lot in Zodome, Genesis 19. so
also, Ierem. 39. 11. 16.

Great comfort to the godly, Use 1.
though never so few: the Lord takes pleasure in them. Psalm. 149. 4. more then
in all the rest of the world, Esai. 43. 4.

To teach us to esteem with God, Use. 2.
more of one good man, than of all the wicked. Psalm. 101. 6. and 119. 63. Prou.
10. 20. For the tongue of the just is as fined silver: but the heart of the
wicked is little worth: the godly are as the apple of Gods eye, Zach. 2. 8.
they be his peculiar people, right dear and precious in his sight, 1. Pet. 2
9. Exo. 19. 5. Psalm. 135. 4.

That all the wicked are alike: they are all, even the whole rank of them,
Doct. 2.
walkers as well as standers and sitters, the least in evil, as well as the
deepest in transgression, all are but as very dust and chafe, most
contemptible with God. Psalm. 119, 119. Esa. 17. 13.

Not to envy the state of the wicked. Use. 1.
Psalm. 37. 1. Pro. 24. 1. but to take them to be as very chafe, divided from
the corn, even light, unfruitful, of little use, or none at all, base, of
none account or worth, but to be trodden under foot and burnt, Mat. 3. 12. Job.
21. 16. 17.

Let the wicked hereby learn to know themselves, Use 2.
the best are but as very chafe, rich chafe, honorable chafe, witty chafe,
etc. This shall they know by the wind of Gods wrath, and flaile of affliction
upon them, which they cannot endure. Job 21. 17. consider what man is, Psalm.
62. 9.

Which the wind drives away. Explanatio^*
] This is added, to express more fully, the misery of the ungodly, subject to
the wind, to be tossed too and fro: the word nadaph, signifies to drive away:
hereby teaching,

That the wicked are as easily removed from their standing, Doct.
as chafe or smoke with the wind, Psalm. 68. 2. Esa. 17. 13. Job. 21. 17.
which wind the Lord will make, Mat. 3. 12. Iere. 51. 1.

The wicked not to brag of their power, Use 1.
strength, and authority: for God can remove them as easily, as wind does
light chafe, or melt them as wax, Psalm. 68. 21. he can make them as dust,
and stubble, Esa. 41. 2. yea with ye sound of a leaf chase the^, without
pursuing them, Leuit. 26. 36. 2. King. 7. 6.

Godly not to fear the wicked men's chaffie power, Use. 2.
but trust in the Lord, pray for his aid, who is irresistable as wind,
fearful as flaming fire, to melt and consume them. Psa. 62. 9.

VERSE. V.
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment, Text.
nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
THerefore they shall not be Matthew. 3. 12. Esa. 30. 28. and 14. 16. Iere. 51. 2.
able to endure the trial: Paraphrase.
but when the Ancient of days shall sit, and the Lord shall prepare his throne
for judgment, (though they do appear before him, as ( 2. Cor. 5. 10.
all must) yet as men cast in their suite, in stead of confidence in their
cause, fear and terror shall make them Mat. 24. 30. Luke 23. 30. Esa. 2. 19.
Revel. 6. 16.
hang down their heads. And howsoever here they live among the just, and
ouertop them too: yet then, as men confounded with shame, they shall not endure
the glorious presence of that blessed company, from whom, by the judgment and
sentence of God, that righteous Judge, they shall be Mat. 25. 32.
separated as Mat, 13. 30.
tares from the wheat, bound up in sheaues to be burnt, and as a cursed crew,
being made to depart, shall be cast into Mat. 25. 41.
everlasting torments.

Therefore] This verse is an inference, Explanation.
which the Psalmist makes, upon the consideration of the vanity of the
wicked, the chaffie people, because he knows them to be but chafe, he
concludes their overthrow and ruin, and that out of themselves: Doct. 1.
hence informing us in these truths,

That the true understanding and knowledge of the nature of the wicked* gives
us a right judgment of their end: which the Prophet David shows in many
places; for describing the^, he concludes thereupon their miserable end: Pro.
6. 12. -- 15. Psalm. 37. 12. 13. and 2. 2. 3. 4. 5. 9. and 52. 1 -- 5. and 53. 1
-- 5. but the conclusion made, Note.
is turned sometimes into a prayer, as in Psalm. 10. there is a description of
the wicked from verse 2. -- 11, then the 12. 14. 15. are a prayer: and in the
16 verse a prophecy. So Psalm. 28. 3 -- 5. and 36. 1 -- 4. 12. Sometime it is
an exhortation, as in Psalm. 50. verse. 16 -- 21. 22.

To judge wisely of the end of the wicked, Use. 1.
learn to know well their nature and conditions.

Let the wicked learn therefore to know themselves, Use 2.
that thereby they may consider of their end, and by fear of destruction, be
moved to leave off their sinning: The not knowing of themselves makes them
secure in their courses, careless of reformation, and presumptuously confident
of the joys of Heaven, the reward only of well doing.

To lay open the nature and properties of the wicked out of the word, Use 3.
that hereby they may see and discern themselves, and thereby their end,
except they be reformed. The Prophet David in the Psalms, and Solomon his
son in the Proverbs, do most excellently, and very largely teach the Church
of God this point, that by knowing what they are, the godly may judge rightly,
what they shall be, except they be reformed.

That the destruction of the wicked, Doct. 2.
is of, and from themselves: for the cause of their not being able to abide the
judgment, is their own emptines and vanity. The Prophet says of Israel,
that her ruin was of her self, Hos. 13. 9. See Numb. 16. 38. Esa. 3. 9.

To justify God in his judgments, Use.
as 2. Chron. 12. 6. Psalm. 119. 70. and to condemn our selves for our sins:
for our own wickedness brings upon us destruction. Esa. 9. 18.

The vngodly] As the Psalmists make them all like chafe: Explanatio^.
so here he speaks still plurally, to make them all subject to misery, in
the day of judgment: showing,

That as all the wicked are chafe: Doct.
so the same end shall be alike, at the last to them all, Psalm. 9. 17. Matthew.
25. 41.

Let not the wicked deceive themselves: Use.
they here indeed differ in outward state much; some rich, some poor, some
honorable, some base, some learned, other ignorant: but because they be all
of them chaffie, they shall all have the end that chafe is appointed unto,
Matthew. 3. 12.

Shall not stand in judgment. Explanatio^.
] The Psalmist may here seem to expound the similitude: meaning by chafe the
ungodly* by driving away, not standing: and by wind, judgment: to show,

That it is usual in Scripture, Doct.
and specially here in the Psalms, and Proverbs, to admit of variation in
words: as Deuteronomy. 32. 2. Psalm. 32. 1. 2. and 34. 1. and 33. 6.

To observe this, Use.
and for the better informing of our understanding herein: note, that this
variation is to express commonly one of these three things: Note.
I. The same sense: this most usual, and it is to explane the meaning more at
large: as the places quoted show. So Psalm. 33. 11. Prou. 7. 18. 25. 27. and 1.
5. 15. and 2. 3. 4. II. The sense that is nigh unto it, as Prou. 1. 8. III. For
contrariety, Pro. 14. 1. and 15. 1. Psalm 37. 21.

Stand vp] Opposed to bending, Explanation.
or falling down, Psalm. 18. 39. and 20. 8. God rises up to judgment, Psalm.
76. 9. To stand then, is to be able to abide the countenance and sentence of
the Judge, without fear, Luke 21. 36. And to arise or fall, is to be
justified or condemned, Mat. 12. 41. Revel. 6. 17. Hence may we be informed,

That there is a judgment, Doct. 1.
Psalm. 76. 8. 9. Eccles. 12. 14. Iere. 25. 30. 31. Psalm. 9.

To consider of this seriously, Use.
which the Lord exercises often in this life, against the world, Genesis 6. and
7* against a country, 2. King. 17. 10. against Cities, Genesis 19. 24. 25.
against families, Numb. 16. 27. 32. Ios. 7. 24. and against persons, 2. Chro*
13. 20. 2. King. 19. 22. 37. and 1. 11. Numb. 15. 35. 2. Sam. 19. 14. 17. so of
the great day of judgment, 2. Cor. 5. 9. 10. 11. Dan. 7. 9. 10. Act. 17. 31.
Mat. 25.

That albeit the wicked shall all appear, Doct. 2.
Iere. 25. 31. 2. Cor. 5. 10. Eccles. 12. 14. (the words are general) yet
shall they not arise up, that is, be justified; nor stand, that is, be
acquitted, but be condemned, and driven, as chafe with the wind, from Gods
presence, Mat. 25. 41.

Let the wicked that now stand up, Use. 1.
and bear a sway till judgment come, learn betime to humble themselves: for
God will overthrow the wall of their defense at the length, Ezekiel. 13. 13. Deuteronomy.
29. 19. Revel. 6. 15. and send fanners to fan them, Iere. 51. 2.

Let none esteem of the wicked as they be prised in their weight of earthly
honor and riches: Use 2.
but as they shall be found by judgment then, of a chaffie nature, lighter
then vatie, Psalm. 62. 9. like Balshazzer, too light in the Lords weights and
balance, Dan. 5. 27.

Nor the sinners in the congregation of the righteous. Explanatio^.
The word stand is here again to be repeated: and the wicked are called
sinners, Chataim, such as add sin to sin, living, and accustoming
themselves to sin: See verse. 1. of this word. These are they that cannot
stand in the congregation of the righteous. From this we learn,

That it is all one, Doct. 1.
to rise up in judgment, and in the assembly of the righteous: and they that
cannot stand up in the one, neither can they stand up with the other.

Hence let all consider, Use.
what it is therefore, to be with, or against, to approve or despise, Doct. 2.
the assembly of the righteous.

That not such as have sinned, but such as are sinners, shall not be allowed of
God among the righteous.

To take heed in judgment we be not found sinners: Use.
all have sinned, Romans 3. and none but has sin, 1. Ioh. 1. but all are not
sinners. It is not simply sin, but living without repentance in sin with
the sinner, that cuts men off from the godly.

That it is a punishment to the wicked sinners, Doct. 3.
not to be allowed among, but to be driven from, the assembly of the righteous:
either here, as 1. Cor. 5. 5. 13. 1. Tim. 1. 20. or as in the last day, Matthew.
Use.
25.

Let such as do (in contempt of the godly) divide themselves from them, know
that once it shall be their punishment. And as here they will not partake with
them in their godliness: so shall they not there in their blessedness.

The word gnedah, Explanation.
here translated assembly, or congregation, signifies a meeting together at a
certain place, at the time appointed by authority, coming of jagnad, which
signifies publica authoritate, locum and tempus certum, de re aliqua
conueniendi indicere, as in a synod or Council, 2. Sam. 20. 5. Psalm. 48. 4.
By righteous, we must understand (taking the word euangelically) such as
through Christ are accounted righteous. From hence we may learn,

That though the godly be now dispersed abroad, Doct. 1.
yet there is a most certain time and place appointed of God, for their
gathering together, to make a full congregation, Matthew. 24. 31. ^^d 25. 32. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 16. 1. Cor. 15. 52.

Comfort unto the godly dispersed, Use 1.
they shall one day be gathered into one.

To be patient, Use 2.
and wait the Lords appointed time, which assuredly shall be in time, for the
joy and happy meeting of all the blessed company.

That this assembly shall be only of the blessed, Doct. 2.
and righteous persons: though here they be mixed among the evil ones: or
rather these among them, Mat. 25. 32. Esa. 60. 21.

To work joy in the hearts of such as here do grieve, Use. 1.
that they cannot ever be with such in this life, as one day they shall be all
together.

To suffer the tares to grow unto the harvest, Use 2.
the Lords Angels will then weed them out, Mat. 13. 30. Psalm. 37. 10.

VERSE VI.
For the Lord knows the way of the righteous: Text.
And the way of the wicked shall perish.
But for a conclusion, Paraphrase.
would we know the cause, why all things do so differently befall these two
sorts of persons? Surely the just are taught of God Psalm. 25. 12.
the way that they shall choose: he Psalm. 40. 2.
orders their goings: Psalm. 37. 29.
the paths of a righteous man are directed by the Lord, for he loves his way,
and so makes him to prosper. He 1. Pet. 5. 7.
cares for the godly, his Psalm. 33. 18.
eye is ever upon them that fear him, Esa. 26. 12.
working all their works for them: He Ps. 37. 39. 40.
helps them, and of him is their salvation, and thus do they Esa. 26. 12.
obtain peace: whereas God withholding and withdrawing his grace from the
wicked, leaves them to themselves, not caring for them, they for want of his
aid and succor Psalm. 37. 19.
consume as the fat of Lambs, and as the smoke they vanish away, thus they
perish, Psalm. 37. 38.
destroyed shall they be together, and the end of the wicked shall be cut off:
Iere. 3. 24. 25.
confusion shall devour their labors, they shall lie down in shame, and
reproach shall cover them, this shall be their portion to drink.

For the Lord] The Psalmist, Explanation.
having set out the godly and wicked so differingly, being now to conclude, he
fetches the reason of all this from the Lord, and not out of the men
themselves: teaching,

That it is of the Lord, Doct.
and not of men, that there is such a difference of persons, some godly, some
ungodly, some righteous, some sinners, etc. Esa. 60. 21. and 61. 3. Psalm. 147.
2. Act. 2. 47. Romans 9. 16. 17. 18. 21.

Give glory unto the Lord for thy goodness, Use.
and pray to him; for thy brethren: for what thou have, it is received from him
and what they want, they cannot enjoy, but by him.

Knows the way of the righteous. Explanation.
] The word knows is not to be taken for knowledge simply, as Romans 1. 21.
Nehe. 6. 12. or to acknowledge, as Act. 19. 15. but for love, care, and to be
pleased with, Psalm. 37. 18. 23. and 31. 7. and 144. 3. Pro. 12. 10. Job. 9. 21.
as may appear by the contrary, Psalm. 101. 4. Matthew. 7. 23. The Doctrines from
these words are,

That there be such as are righteous, Doct. 1.
and so to be accounted: Psalm. 32. 1. 11. and 37. 29. Prou. 2. 20. Mat. 25.
37. 46.

To receive this truth, Use 1.
but yet not according to the law of works, Psalm. 143. 2. Romans 3. 20. Gal. 2.
16. Job. 25. 4. but after the law of grace and faith, Romans 3. 24. and 5. 1.
Galath. 3. 8. 11.

To rejoice that any man may be held righteous in Gods mercy, Use. 2.
seeing in our selves we are so wicked: for such righteous ones are blessed,
Psalm 32. 1. 2. 11. so verse. 1. of this Psalm.

That these righteous ones have a way or path to walk: Doct. 2.
for here it is said the way of the righteous, ascribing to them a way: see
Pro. 2. 20. and 14. 8.

To search out this way, Use.
to walk with the righteous in it, it is not the way of nature, nor a path
upon the earth, that men tread in, nor the way of corruption, Genesis 6. 12. Pro.
4. 14. but the good way, 1. Sam. 12. 23. 1. King. 8. 36. the old way, Iere. 6.
16. yet the new and living way, Heb. 10. 20. the way of peace, Romans 3. 17. the
way of wisdom, Pro. 4. 11. of perfection -- of life, Pro. 10. 17. and the way
of good men. Proverbs 2. 20.

That the Lord knows this their way, Doct. 3.
Psalm. 37. 18. 23.

To rejoice and comfort those that be godly, Use.
that the Lord approves and is well pleased with their way: though men be not.
Let them meditate on Psalm. 37. 5. 6. 7. verses.

That this knowing and approving of their way by the Lord, Doct. 4.
is the true cause of their happiness and salvation. Ephesians. 2. 8.

Not to look upon thy goodness, Use.
or grace, thy godliness, and justice: but magnify the Lords mercy, that is
pleased to approve of thee.

Note for a conclusion of this, Explanatio^.
that the Psalmist begins singularly, as speaking but of one, verse. 1. 2. 3.
but here he ends plurallie (saying the righteous) as including all: to teach,

That the description here set down, Doct.
is not of one singular godly man: but is the lively picture of all the
righteous.

Let all them behold this pattern to draw themselves thereby, Use.
if they would be accounted among the righteous.

But the way of the ungodly shall perish. Explanation
] Here the Prophet shows on the contrary the end of the wicked: and from
this may we learn,

That perishing in the end is the portion of the ungodly, Doct. 1.
even to all of them, from the wicked ungodly, to the lewd sinner, and from
this to the proud scorner: for here the word is in the plural number
rishangnim, Psalm. 9. 17. and 11. 6. and 37. 38. Mat. 25. 33. 41. 46. Pro. 11.
7. Romans 2. 8. 9. Revel. 20. 10. 15.

You wicked before the time of vengeance come, Use 1.
behold your end every one of you, and repent, and pray God, if it be possible,
that your wickedness may be done away.

Let not any godly, Use. 2.
be they never so poor, envy the prosperity of the wicked, Prou. 24. 1. and
3. 31. and 23. 17. 18. Psalm. 37. 1. 2. and 129. 6.

That their way, Doct. 2.
that is, their counsels, studies, endeavors, practices, also their glory,
power, honor, and authority, shall have a dismal day, and come to a
miserable end: Psalm. 37. 2. 14. 17. 35. 36. Pro. 11. 7. and 13. 9.

To look to our way what it is: Use 1.
if it be the way of the wicked, it is the way of wickedness, Psalm. 139. 24.
the way of darkness, Prou. 2. 13. the broad way leading to destruction. Matthew.
7. 13.

The godly to be content, Use 2.
and patiently wait, and not fear the power, policy, and practices of the
wicked; they shall have an end.

Note here that perishing, Explanation.
is opposed to the Lords knowing and approving of the godly, which is not
spoken of the wicked: to teach,

That for want of Gods approbation, Doct.
the wicked and their way do perish: His not knowing, that is, his not
approving them, is his reiection of them, and so their utter destruction.
Matthew. 7. 23.

Therefore above all things let us labor for Gods approbation: Use.
for if he justify, who can condemn? Romans 8. 33. 34. but if the Lord be
against us, who can plead for us? 1. Sam. 2. 25.

The second Psalm.
THE ARGUMENT.
THis Psalm is in order the second, Acts 13. 33. though some have held it all
one with the first, this ending with blessed, as the other therewith begins.
It has no title, but is ascribed by the holy Apostles unto David, Acts 4. 25.
who is thought to have penned it, after his victories over the Philistines, who
gathered themselves against him, when the people had made him King in Saul's
room. In which, as in many other things he was a type of Christ, of whom also
this Psalm speaks. Acts 4. 25. 26. 27. Here David the King, David's kingdom,
and his enemies, set out Christ the Messiah our King, his kingdom, and enemies
rebelling against him. It is a mixed Psalm, containing Doctrine, The princpiall
point of the Psalm.
Prophecy, and exhortation: the principal point in it, is this, that as David
by Gods appointment, was to rule in Sion; and to subdue the nations (maugre
their hearts) so Christ Jesus (as here is fore-promised, and now is fulfilled)
by the appointment of God his father, was to be established in his kingdom,
and therein to bear rule, as is showed in verse. 6. 7. 8. 9. in despite of all
his enemies, not being able by their power, or policy, to withstand him, as
verse. 1. 2. 3. 4. do manifest, but should in the appointed time, feel the
power of his heavy, and wrathful indignation? if they did continue to oppose
him. verse. 5. And therefore the Psalmist hereof certainly persuaded and
wishing salvation to such, as God has ordained to be saved, exhorts them to
be wise, to fear the Lord, to serve him, and to do him homage, least they
perish, pronouncing them contrarily to be most happy, which do yield all
humble subjection, and do put their trust in him. ver. 10. 11. 12.

The use and profit of this Psalm.
IT is a prophetical history, or an historical prophecy in David the type of
Christ Jesus the Antitype. I. Showing how he shall be King. II. That he shall
have many enemies of the meanest, as also of the mightiest, banding themselves
together against him. III. That yet for the Churches comfort, their attempts,
Psalm. 7. 14.
studies, consultations, power, policy and rage, shall prove to be of none
effect: let them travel with wickedness, and conceive mischief, they shall yet
bring forth a lie: for Christ shall confound them. So as in this Psalm the
godly may comfort themselves in an assured victory against their enemies, they
may hereby in their faith be strengthened, touching all their spiritual
assaults made for the overthrow of Christ's kingdom, against which the gates of
hell shall not prevail. In all their miseries, afflictions and troubles, they
may have recourse unto Christ their King and Sovereign, for aid and defense,
who is able, and will also revenge their just quarrel, with his iron scepter
upon those base and earthen vessels. And here the wicked that cannot away to
be under Christ's easy yoke, neither may endure to bear his light burden, may
in time learn to be wise, and to serve the Lord, rejoicing in trembling: lest
the Lords anger be stirred up against them, to their utter confusion. He is a
Lamb, he is a Lion: as a Savior, so a Judge. He has the sentence of
absolution, Come ye blessed, and the sentence of condemnation, Go ye cursed:
he treasureth up mercies for those that be his. Blessed are all they that put
their trust in him: but reserueth vengeance: vialls full of wrath to be poured
on the head and hairy scalp of all that rise up against him.

The resolution of this Psalm.
This Psalm has two parts: 1. A twofolde narration. 1. Of the attempts of the
wicked against ye kingdom of David, as the type, and of Christ as the
antitype, set down 1. By way of interrogation, admiring their folly to go
about that, which was impossible to effect. verse. 1. 2. By an affirmative
declaration, and that 1. Of their association, and leagueing together. verse.
2. illustrated from the 1. Persons conspiring: Kings and Princes. 2. Persons
against whom: the Lord and his anointed.
2. Of their encouraging one another to this rebellion. ver. 3.

2. Of Gods maintaining both the one and the other: and this again is twofold:
1. Of the power of God whereby he 1. Scorneth their attempts, as not able to
do harm. verse. 4. 2. Confounds them in his displeasure. verse 5. 3.
Annointeth his King, and sets him over Sion. verse. 6.
2. Of his mercy manifesting his decree, if this might move the^ to obey, and
that 1. Concerning the person of this King. verse. 7. 2. Concerning his kingdom
and the amplitude thereof. verse. 8. 3. Concerning the power and effects of it
against such rebellious ones. verse. 9.


2 An exhortatory conclusion, wherein is set down, 1. The things whereto he
exhorts these, are, 1. Wisdom to obey, verse. 10. 2. To worship him as their
God. verse. 11. 3. To do fealty, as to their King. v. 12.
2. Reasons to move hereunto, which are 1. His displeasure, and the evil that
will follow, if they do not obey. verse. 12. 2. Happiness, if they do betake
themselves to his protection. verse. 12.



The general observations.
IN this Psalm thus setting out Jesus Christ his person, his offices, his
kingdom, so fully before hand to the people of God in the old Testament, as it
is now verily fulfilled in our eyes, we may learn, I. That this Psalm was not
of any private interpretation, but was delivered by David, as he was moved by
that vn-erring spirit of God, as all holy men were, 2. Pet. 1. 20. 21. II. That
the doctrine of the Gospel of Christ and his kingdom was no new doctrine,
when he was incarnate, which he and his Apostles taught; but that pure and
most holy ancient truth delivered before in the holy Scriptures, as the word
shows, Luke 24. 27. 44. Acts 26. 22. and 28. 23. III. That as the knowledge
of Christ was reueiled unto the holy men of God: so they taught the same which
they did receive concerning him, (and as we now believe) unto the people of
God. So Jacob, Genes. 49. 10. 11. Mich. 5. 2. Esa. 7. 14. and 9. 7. and 35. 5.
and 53. and 61. 1. Zacha. 9. 9. and 13. 7. 11. 12. Dan. 9. 26. David here, and
Psalm. 22. etc.

PSALM. II. VERSE. I.
Why do the people rage, Text.
and the people murmr in vain?
GOd spoke Psalm. 89. 19. 20. 21.
sometimes in vision and said, Paraphrase.
I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have found David my servant, with
mine holy oil have I anointed him: mine hand shall be established with him,
and mine arm shall strengthen him: my Psalm. 89. 34. 35
covenant with him will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of
my mouth; I have sworn by my holiness that I will not fail David. And not
only for David himself, but for his Psalm. 89. 36.
seed also, the same God has promised that it should be for ever, and his
throne as the Sun before him: that of his seed he would raise up his son
Christ according to the flesh, to whom he has said, Psalm. 110. 1. 2.
Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool; be thou
Ruler in the midst of thine enemies: what then, not only wickedness, but
folly is this? worthy to be wondered at, both of the Heathen round about, and
the Jewish people, that they should so storm hereat, and mutter amongst
themselves, as if they could hinder this counsel and work of God, which is
most impossible.

Why? Explanation.
] David considering what is in the verses, 6. 7. 8. 9. in this, from a holy
security, and sure faith with which he concludes in the end, he admiring also
their folly and madness does demand, and thus as a religious insulting
makes a question: to teach,

That the godly in their certain knowledge of their safe estate, Doct. 1.
and in full assurance of victory over Christ's, and their enemies, do make
light account of their attempts. Esa. 37. 22.

To make a light reckoning of the enemies of the Church; Use.
and to do this, we must learn to know, and believe confidently, the sure
and the safe estate of the Church of Christ triumphing, verse. 6. 7. 8. 9. in
his members: conquering, Mat. 16. 18. Revel. 14. 1. 4. and 10. 11. -- 16. and
in the certain destruction of all them that rise up against them, Revel. 19.
18. -- 21. and 20. 10.

That the godly wise cannot but wonder oftentimes, Doct. 2.
at the acts of carnal and earthly people, they be so void of reason, yea
sometime God himself wondereth thereat. Esa. 59. 16.

Seeing people will be sometime so unreasonable, Use.
let us try, and as we find, so judge, and not for the number be brought into
a confederacy with them, but follow the holy and wholesome counsel of Isai.
chap. 8. 11. 12. 13.

Do the heathen] By heathen in David's time, Explanation.
are meant the people of any nation, except the Israelites, in Israel and
Judah, as the Ammonites, Moabites, Idumeans. Philistims compassing about David's
kingdom, 2. Sam. 5. 17. and 8. and 10. These were David's enemies nigh at hand.

They that border nighest upon the dwelling of the righteous, Doct.
if they become not one with the people of God, will prove hateful foes to
them: as all these nations did to David and Israel: and so other in Nehemiahs
days, chap. 4. 1. 7. 8.

To be wise and watchful with Nehemiah, Use.
and to have ever an eye upon those that will not be of our religion, and yet
be nigh us, these be enemies in heart, and when they can get fit occasion,
they will with Sanballat, Tobiah the Ammonite and others, show it to the full.
Explanation.


Rage] The word ragshu is tumultuously as in an uproar to come together, as
Psalm. 64. 2. and the word Ephruaxan, Act. 4. 25. notes rage, pride, and
fiercenes, as horses that neigh and rush into the battle: and all this was,
for that God had exalted David, who was a man seeking the welfare of Israel.

Some enemies of the Church, Doct. 1.
are violent, furious, and raging as beasts, Act. 19. 28. 29. 32. Luke 4. 28.
29. The word is used in Daniels case, Dan. 6. 6. 11.

Think to find some as beasts, Use.
mad and furious enemies: such our Savior found, Luke 4. 28. 29. Matthew. 26.
47. and 27. 22. -- So S. Stephen, Act. 7. 54. 57. 1. Cor. 15. 32. and therefore
prepare with patience to endure their madness, as the Saints formerly have
done. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 14. 15. Doct. 2.


The wicked take it grievously to see any advanced for the welfare of Gods
people, and do as enraged beasts oppose them. Nehem. 4. 7. 8. Act. 4. 2. Mat.
2. 3. 16. 2. Sam. 5. 17.

Those that wish well to Sion let them look for enemies: Use.
as Nehemiah found; David here; Daniel; S. Paul after his conversion: the world
only loves her own, Ioh. 15. 19.

And the people, Explanation
etc.] These were enemies to David within the Church, to wit, of the
Israelites: as Abner, with all that took part with the house of Saul, 2. Sam.
3. who were herein as the heathen: teaching,

That heathen, Doct.
that is enemies out of the Church, as were the Philistims, 2. Sam. 5. 17. the
Iebusites, chap. 5. 6. and heathenish people, the wicked within the Church, as
Saulists, unnatural Abshalomites cannot be willing to subject themselves to
the best, and most religious governors that may be. Number. 16. 2. 3. 1. Sam. 8.
7. and as David's example here shows: so Ierem. 41. 2. and 2. Chron. 20. 1.

To take notice of men's rebellious natures, Use. 1.
which cannot endure any subjection, no not to the best governors in the best
government. Fear therefore the Lord and honor the King, and meddle not with
those that are seditious. Proverbs 24. 21.

To learn therefore not rashly to lay the fault upon Princes, Use. 2.
because of the rage of the heathen, or tumultuous opposition and murmuring of
their subjects against them: for so should meek Moses, holy Samuel, and
zealous David be condemned.

As David found enemies both abroad and at home, Explanatio^.
of heathen, and of his own nation: so did Jesus Christ, Matthew. 2. Ioh. 9. 22.
Luke 4. 29. and 19. 47. Ioh. 11. 47. Luke 23. 11. Mar. 15. 15. Teaching,

That the enemies of God, Doct.
of Christ his son, and of his kingdom in the type and antitype, are many
and manifold wicked at tempters, not wanting many abettors both within and
without the Church. Psalm. 83, 6. and 38. 19. and 3. 1. 2. Chron. 20. 1. 2. Acts
4. Luke 23. 1. Math. 27. 1.

Let the Church look for troubles here, Use.
of the enemies thereof, both abroad and at home. Consider these places. Ioh.
15. 20. 2. Tim. 3. 12. Acts 14. 22. 1. These. 2. 14. 15. Mat. 10. 22. 16. 36.
37. Luke 9. 23.

The word vmmim translated people, Explanation
is of vmah, a people from one stock, as the Israelites were, which differs
from gnam, a people gathered of diverse, here it is put for the common sort.
Teaching,

That the multitude and commons are apt to become furtherers of evil, Doct.
and enemies to goodness, this found Noah, 1. Pet. 3. 20. Lot 2. Pet. 2. 7. 8.
Genesis 19. 4. -- Aaron, Exodus. 32. 1. Esa. 1. 4. -- Ier. 13. 10. and 44. 15.
Acts 19. 25. 28. 29.

Therefore to take heed of the common sort: Use.
not to hang upon them for their applause and favor, not to rely upon them,
and not easily to follow the multitude, Exodus. 23. 2. For the most are
commonly the worst, Mat. 7. 13. 14. They are of the world, Ioh. 15. 19. which
lies in wickedness. 1. Ioh. 5. 19.

Imagine, Explanation
or meditate. The word jehgu of hagah, significat cogitationem in rem aliquam
intendere: and as Molerus adds, sedulum, irremissum, assiduum, and indefessum
studium, teaching,

That the enemies within the bosom of the Church imagine mischief, Doct.
and without wearisomnesse, study to bring about their purposes. Proverbs. 4.
16. 17. Mat. 26. 3. 4. and 27. 1. John 11. 47. 48.

To look watchfully to the bosom enemies, Use. 1.
and the wicked within the Church, for they be very dangerous.

To bewail our wickedness that we can be weary in well doing soon, Use 2.
but never in devising and meditating upon our lusts, to satisfy our
pleasures, to gain profit, or to work our malice even against Christ and his
members.

A vain thing. Explanatio^.
The word rich is translated of the Septuagint by (...). So Acts 4. 25. which
is, to be without effect or fruit, lost labor, empty handed, Mar. 12. 3. Luke
1. 53. teaching,

That the study, Doct.
counsel and enterprises of the wicked against the godly are but vain, Psalm.
21. 11. Esa. 8. 10. and 33. 11. and 41. 11. See it in David, 2. Sam. 22. 1.
against Abner: 2. Sam. 3. 27. In Ishbosheth, 2. Sam. 4. 7. In the Iebusites, 2.
Sam. 5. 8. 1. Chr. 11. 8. in the Philistines, cap. 5. and 8. in Absalom, cap.
18. 9. 14. in Sheba. cap. 20. 22. and in Ioshuah against his enemies. Josh. 10.
3. 5. 10. and 11. 1-8. So in Christ and his Church, Phil. 2. 9. -- Revel. 19.
and 20. 1. Cor. 15. 57. Romans 8. 37. 38.

The wicked to take notice of their folly and vain attempts, Use. 1.
kicking against the pricks, they shall not prosper. Esa. 29. 8. and 54. 17.
Ier. 1. 29.

Great comfort to the godly, Use. 2.
that though many here suffer of the wicked, yet the victory shall be theirs,
for the wicked shall not win the field, Psalm. 37. 13. 15. 17. 40. and 46. 10.
11. with verses 2. 3. 5. Esa. 6. 4. 7. And therefore let the godly not fear,
Josh. 11. 6. but be of good courage, John. 10. 25.

In the first Psalm we read of the godly man's meditation, Explanatio^.
which was Gods Law, here of the meditation of the wicked, which is a vain
thing, teaching.

That the meditation of the godly, Doct.
and the meditation of evil disposed people, greatly differ: the one on good
things, Psalm. 119. 15. but the other on deceit. Psalm. 35. 20. and mischief.
Psalm. Use.
36. 4.

By our daily study, meditation, and thoughts of our hearts, to consider and
judge of our selves, whether we be disposed as the godly, or as the wicked: for
as our hearts are, such are we before God.

VERSE.II.
The Kings of the earth set themselves, Text.
and the Princes take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his
Christ: as if he should say,
YEt so it is: that not only the ignorant and common multitudes, but the Kings
of the 2. Sam. 5. 17.
Philistines, 2. Sam. 8. 2.
Moabites, 2. Sam. 8. 5.
Aramites, and other bordering nations, as by a mutual confederacy, set
themselves with all their might and maine against the kingdom of David: the
Princes also of Israel, 2. Sam. 2. 8. and 3. 1.
Abner, and the whole house of Saul take counsel together and war against
him. And not only against David, but against the Lord Christ also, of whom he
was a type, Acts 4. 27.
both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and people of Israel, have
gathered themselves together, and in so doing have banded themselves against
the Lord, and his kingdom, and are found fighters against God himself, since
they oppose themselves against him whom he anointed.

The Kings. Explanation
] Having spoken of the meaner sort, he now shows who else were his enemies,
even the mightiest: melech signifies any principal governor, Deuteronomy. 17. 14.
(...), the Septuagint, (...). even these were David's enemies, and such became
Christ's also, Act. 4. 27. and the Apostles, Mat. 10. 18. Teaching,

That by greatness none become more godly, Doct. 1.
but by grace, Psalm. 49. 20. this may we see in Nymrod, Nebuchadnezzar and
other Monarchs of the world.

To strive therefore more for grace then greatness, Use.
and without grace, not to think our selves better before God for our
greatness, if greatness makes us graceless.

That such as should be nursing Fathers to the people of God, Doct. 2.
may be enemies to them; and such as should lead the people to piety, may be
ringleaders to impiety. Esa. 3. 12. and 9. 15. 16. and 1. 10. Ier. 5. 5. Hos.
7. 7. Amos 7. 11. 12. Cant. 5. 7. Ezekiel. 8. 12. Ahab against Eliah, Saul against
David. Haman, and by him Ahashueros against the Jews, Herod against John
Baptist, Pharaoh with his Princes against the Israelites, Ioash against
Zachariah, etc.

As therefore we may not depend upon the multitude for number, Use 1.
no more upon the mighty because of their place, seeing the Roman Emperors,
were bloody persecutors, Jeroboam made Israel to sin, great Balaam of Rome,
even the beast deceived, and does deceive by his greatness, Reu. 13. 13. and
11. 2.

Not to be offended though great ones be enemies, Use. 2.
Matthew. 10. 18. Ioh. 16. 1.

To praise God and pray for good Princes and Governors, Use. 3.
that are not enemies, but fathers to Gods people as was Iehosophat, Hezechias
and Josiah, etc.

Of the earth. Explanation.
] This may be added to show from whence they be, e terra, what they be, terreni
and what they seek after, terrestria, such called men of earth, Psalm. 10.
18. teaching,

That earthly potentates are they, Doct.
which for earthly things do thus bestir themselves, making head against the
Lord and his people, as is seen here in David's enemies, and so in Herod's
practice against Christ, Mat. 2. And Pharaoh against the Israelites, Exodus 1.

To consider hereby, Use 1.
how the things of this world, and love thereof, make men of earth, to become
Gods enemies: and therefore are we to be renewed in the inward man, and to shake
off the love thereof.

Not yet to fear the power of these, Use. 2.
because they be but earthly Princes, their power therefore but weak.

Set themselves. Explanation
] Iatsab, signifies, to stand disposed, framed and addressed unto a thing, so
as there is both a ready will and a full resolution to perform the matter
intended, teaching,

That wicked mighty ones, Doct.
are in will readily disposed, in a settled resolution to oppose themselves
against God and his Church. Psalm. Use.
83. 4. 5.

The consideration hereof should stir up the people of God: First, unto
prayer for his aid, help, and power, to bridle and prevent them. Secondly, to
thank him daily, that they do no more mischief, seeing they be so ready
pressed unto evil.

And the rulers. Explanation
] The word rodsen signifies a counsel, or one next to a King, a Prince (...)
Iud. 5. 3. (...), Esa. 40. 23. (...). Prou. 8. 16. so do the Septuagint
translate the word. These are joined with Kings in this wickedness, as ready to
help forward their ungodly and proud attempts: teaching,

That wicked Kings want not their wicked Princes and Counselors, Doct.
to help them forward in that which is evil. 1. King. 12. 28. Genesis 12. 15.
Hos. 7. 5.

Therefore let Kings take heed of being authors of any evil, Use 1.
for they easily draw many, and those mighty ones also, with them into their
sin.

Let evil counselors be removed, Use. 2.
that the throne of Kings may be established in justice. Prou. 25. 5. and 20.
26.

Take counsel together. Explanation.
Iasad, is properly to lay a foundation, and here used for to take counsel,
which is the foundation of wise men's wary proceeding: and jachad, vna, pariter,
the Septuagint (...), simul, in one place, Genesis 13. 6. (...), unanimity, with
one heart to consent, Exodus 19. 8. Acts. 4. 24. (...), in id ipsum. Ios. 9. 2.
Teaching,

That the enemies of the Church proceed not all in a like manner, Doct. 1.
some rage, ver. 1. some rise in power and forcible means, as the wicked
Kings, others by policy also. Exodus 1. 10. Psalm. 83. 3. Ier. 18. 18. Luke 20.
20.

To prepare for the variety of enemies proceedings, Use.
in thy place, and think not to find them all after one sort, but some to rage
as savage beasts, and some subtle men, as crafty foxes,

That the wicked, Doct. 2.
even the enemies of God and Christ, want not circumspect wariness, being wise
in their generation, Luke 16. 8.

To be wise as serpents, Use.
in keeping the innocence of doves, against these wise and politic worldlings.

That therefore the subtle adversaries sin not of infirmity, as suddenly
overtaken, Doct. 3.
but deliberately taking counsel together, that they may effect their wills,
Psalm. 64. 5. 6. and 83. 3. 8. Nehem. 4. 8. Mat. 27. 1. Mark. 15. 1.

Let them look therefore for the more severe and terrible judgment: Use.
Psalm. 59. 5. and let not the godly fear them, nor their crafty counsel, but
mark what the Lord says, Esa. 8. 10. and 41. 10. -- 16.

That the wicked can come together, Doct. 4.
and consent without iarring, against God and his people. Ios. 9. 2. and 10. 5.
Psalm. 48. 4. and 94. 21. and 83. 6 -- 8. Acts. 4. 27.

Let the godly here learn to be one for goodness, Use 1.
as the wicked can be one for wickedness.

This may reprove such as profess to do well, Use. 2.
but yet cannot agree together, and be of one mind to further the same, as
indeed they ought.

Here is to be observed further, Explanatio^.
how Gods enemies, as they be of diverse sorts, so some rage, some plot and
devise, some proudly stand up in strength, some assist by counsel to bring
their devises to pass. Hereby teaching,

That Satan has his several instruments: Doct.
working in them and by them in a differing sort, against the Lord and his
people; as may appear here in the enemies against David and Israel, as this
history shows in 1. and 2. of Samuel, and against Christ, and the Christian
Church, as the Evangelists, the Acts and history Ecclesiastical witness.

The godly must hence be warned, Use.
to get a special assurance of Gods aid, to stay themselves with comfort, in
his wisdom against their policy, in his might against their strength, and in
his mercy against their wrath. For God is all sufficient for his people to
defend them, to supply what on their part is wanting, and to overthrow their
enemies.

Against the Lord, Explanation
and against his anointed.

By anointed we are to understand David the anointed King of Israel, 1. Sam.
16. 12. 13. Psalm. 89. 21. a type of Christ, who else where is called David,
Ier. 39 9. Ezekiel. 34. 23. 24. Hos. 3. 5. he knowing his calling insulteth over
his enemies, and tells them they fight against God, and shall not prevail:
teaching,

That the Resisters of Gods ordinance, Doct. 1.
and appointment in the ministry of his servants, are truly (...), fighters
against God himself, Acts. 5. 39. and 7. 51. Romans. 13. 1. 2. Luke 10. 16.

To be subject therefore to the power ordained of God, Use. 1.
and not to resist the same, Romans 13. 1. 2.

To be a comfort to such as be established by the Lord; Use. 2.
in this that their enemies are Gods enemies.

There are counsels and assemblies as well against the Lord, Doct. 2.
as for him. Mich. 6. 16. 1. King. 12. 28. 29. Dan. 3. 1. -- Mat. 26. 66. and
27. 1.

Therefore this confutes Papists, Use. 1.
who hold that counsels cannot err.

Not rashly to approve every thing that is concluded by counsels, Use. 2.
but follow the Apostles advise, 1. Thessal. 5. 21. 1. John 4. 1. Acts 17. 11.
Revel. 2. 2.

Not to be offended, Use. 3.
if authority have an eye unto assemblies, to prevent conuenticles and
unlawful meetings.

By anointed is also here meant Christ the Messiah, Explanation
the anointed, Acts 4. 24. He is called anointed because of his offices, of
which there were three types anointed, as Kings, 1. Sam. 16. 12. 13. and 24.
26. So Priests, Exodus. 30. 30. and Prophets, 1. King. 19. 16. who also are
called the Lords anointed, Psalm. 105. 15. to teach us,

That they be enemies to God the Father, Doct. 1.
who are against Christ his anointed, Luke 10. 16.

Such as will therefore think they worship the father, Use.
and have him their God, must also do honor to the son, for else they do
but make God their enemy, Ioh. 5. 23.

That Jesus our Savior is our anointed King, Doct. 2.
Priest, and Prophet. Our King here, verse. 6. Our Priest, Psalm. 110. Hebr. 4.
Our Prophet, Deuteronomy. 18. Act. 13.

To yield to him obedience, Use.
make him our advocate, and learn of him as the doctor of the Church.

David in the spirit prophesied, Explanatio^.
and foretold of this, and we do read in Acts the fourth, that it is come to
pass.

The enemies of Christ do nothing which is not already foreseen of God. Doct.
So the Apostles witness, Act. 4. 24. and Christ foretold also to his Disciples,
Mat. 10. 17. 18. 21. 22.

To be comforted in this that God foreseeth the attempts of all his enemies,
against his Son, and against his Church: for by Christ must we also
understand the body of Christ his Church, called Christ, 1. Cor. 12. 12.

VERSE.III.
Let us break their bands, Text.
and cast their cords from us.
THus they encourage one another in their rebellious attempts: Paraphrase.
let neither the Lord nor his Luke 19. 14.
anointed reign over us: but howsoever they think to impose upon us their
laws and ordinances, and with these as with strong bonds and cords to bind
and fetter us; yet let us be 1. Sam. 4. 9.
strong and play the men, and Ierem. 5. 5.
shake off the yoke of such servitude, and wholly reject their government.

This verse shows what all these enemies do especially aim at, Explanatio^.
even rebelliously to seek their liberty: which teaches,

That the wicked are rebellious, Doct.
and affect nothing so much as lawless liberty, to do what themselves like
without all restraint of laws and government. Psalm. 12. 4.

Men must therefore take heed of affecting lawless liberty, Use. 1.
lest they be noted for such wicked ones. Use. 2.


Also Magistrates (seeing this their nature) should labor the more with
wholesome laws to contain them in obedience.

Let vs] The words of encouragement one to another, Explanatio^.
to stir them up to the work. Teaching,

That the wicked can animate and hearten one another in their ungodly
enterprises. Doct.
1. Sam. 4. 9. Psalm. 83. 4. 12. and 64. 5. Iere. 18. 18. Prou. 1. 11. and 7. 18.

A reproof of our sluggishnes and want of love to God, Use.
when we have no heart to exhort one another to well doing, as we ought, Esa.
2. 3. Psalm. 95. 1. Eccles. 12. 13.

Break asunder. Explanatio^.
] That is, assay to break: for they cannot indeed, but here show their will,
what they gladly would do, and what ignorantly they suppose they could do,
against David and against Christ. Nathac signifies to unfold the linkes, or
twistings, and so to break it in sunder, Eccles. 4. 12. Learn hence,

That the wicked have great purposes and resolutions, Doct. 1.
and have a mind to do great matters, against God and his people. Psalm. 83.
4. 12. Esa. 7. 56. 7. Exodus 1. 10. Nehe. 4. 7. 8. 11.

We should therefore when we see that they bring not their purposes to pass,
Use.
acknowledge with thanks Gods providence over us, who preuenteth them, as we
see in Nehe 4. 15. Esa. 7. 7.

That they do think that they are able to bring their thoughts to pass,
Doct. 2.
even against the Lord and his Christ. Act. 26. 9. Use.


To behold hereby the proud conceit and presumptuous blindness of men's wicked
hearts, who think that they can do things impossible, as Nimrod and his
company; the Jews, and heathen against Christian religion.

Their bands] Bands, Explanation
the word musar coming of jasar, to chastise, is properly discipline and
correction, and so bands, by which the unruly are tamed: here it is put for
laws. He says not his, but their bands, as the laws of God published by
David, or of Christ, by himself and his Apostles; even by the Lord and his
Ministers, whom he uses in his rule and government. Teaching,

That good laws are as bands and cords for discipline, Doct. 1.
to keep people in obedience to God, and to his ordinances.

To receive willingly good laws, Use.
as necessary means, to keep the ill disposed within the compass of their
duties.

That rebellious hearts do hold themselves in bondage, Doct. 2.
and as prisoners in bonds, being made subject to Gods own laws.

This should teach all to bewail this corruption of our hearts, Use.
by which we count Gods easy yoke, and his commandments, which are not
grievous, to be so burdensome, and to pray with David that we may know and have
proof of the goodness of his laws, that we may love them. Psalm. 119. 140

That therefore such will not have Christ reign over them, Doct. 3.
though they as Kings would reign over others. Luke 19. 14.

This serves to condemn in them their pride and injustice, Use.
who desiring to rule over others, cannot endure that God himself should rule
over them.

And cast away their cords from us. Explanation.
] The word gnaboth signifies a cord twisted by foldings one in another, Exo.
28. 14. Here is but either one thing expressed in diverse terms, or (as some
others think) by bands are laws, by cords the discipline and rule with these
same laws: so taking it we learn,

That such as cannot away with Gods word and laws, Doct.
do cast away, as it were in contempt, his government, Luke 19. 14.

Therefore to bring men to a conformity in Christ's government, Use.
they must first be brought to the obedience of his word.

VERSE IIII.
But he that sits in heaven shall laugh: Text.
the Lord shall have them in derision.
But let earthly Kings rage never so horribly, yet God who is the King of
heaven, and Psalm. 9. 7.
does sit for ever there as on his throne, before whom the inhabitants of the
earth Isai. 40. 22.
are but as grasshoppers, he does set light of their impotent fury: and as a
valiant Champion, in stead of fearing, does scorn his feeble and ouermatched
adversary, so does God Psalm. 37. 12. 13. and 59. 8.
laugh at their vain attempts, and contemnes their weak opposition, which
cannot hurt, nor annoy him: and by frustrating their devices, shall propose
them to the derision of others also.

Here the Prophet does show, Explanation.
why he held his and Christ's enemies to imagine a vain thing, because he had
an eye unto God, whom he knew saw them well, and laughed at their folly:
teaching, Doct.


That the true consideration of Gods beholding and opposing the wicked, and of
his light account of them and their strength, is that which makes a godly man
to judge all their wicked enterprises to be but vain. Exodus 14. 13. 2. Chron.
20. 20.

To make light of all the rage, Use.
plots, power, and pohcies of the wicked, let us lift up our eyes unto God, and
consider how he sees, and laughs them to scorn: he being wiser and stronger
then all his enemies. 1. Cor. 1. 25. Ioh. 10. 29.

He that sits in the heavens. Explanation.
] David opposes only the Lord here to his and Christ's enemies: to teach us,

That he has strength enough, Doct.
that has God on his side, though never so many be against him. Romans 8. 13.
2. Kings 6. 16. 2. Chron. 32. 7.

If God be on thy side, Use.
care not what man can do unto thee. David opposes him here as his comfort
against all his enemies: So Esa. 8. 10.

The words are a description of God delivered for the Churches comfort against
their enemies: Explanation.
out of which words we may learn,

That God is in heaven. Doct. 1.
Psalm. 11. 4. and 115. 1. 3. Esa. 66. 1.

To reverence him, Use.
Eccles. 5. 1. to live holily, as under him, and before his eyes.

That therefore he sees all thing's on earth. Doct. 2.
Psalm. 14. 2. and 11. 4. and 94. 7. Hebr. 4. 13. Ierem. 32. 19. else David
would not allege this for comfort.

Comfort to the people of God, Use.
that the Lord sees his enemies, and that we have our defender over our
heads, Psalm 102. 19. 29. and the auenger of our cause over their heads.

That for this cause all the attempts of the wicked against him are vain;
Doct. 3.
whom he can from thence easily confound, and rain destruction upon them. Use
1.
Psalm. 11. 4. 6. Genesis 7. 11. and 19. 24.

The godly not to fear men, Use. 2.
but to trust in the Lord.

Let the wicked fear and tremble, when they rebel against Christ. The Lord is
in heaven, consider: Heb. 10. 31. He is above all his enemies, Psalm. 99. 2.
and 97. 9. and beholds what is done on earth. Psalm. 102. 19.

Shall laugh. Explanatio^.
] This is spoken of God, as elsewhere, Pro. 1. 26 Psalm. 59. 8. after the manner
of men: to set out the folly of the adversary and their foolish attempts, the
like reckoning he makes of their great stirs, and power, and authority
with men. Job. 41. 20.

The proud and giantlike practices of all the wicked against Christ (how
dreadful soever they seem to the world) are in Gods sight ridiculous. Doct.
Psalm. 37. 13. and 59. 8. and 33. 10. 11.

Let us esteem lightly of the power, Use.
policy, and rage of the wicked, and with Sion laugh them to scorn, Esa. 37.
22. for they cannot destroy the work of God, Acts 5. 35 --. For Gods counsel
shall stand for ever. Psalm. 33. 11. Pro. 19. 21. and 16. 1. and 21. 30. Iere.
10. 23.

The Lord] Here is expounded whom David meant before to sit in heaven,
Explanation.
even Adonaj the Lord, the vpholder and pillar of his people, as the force of
the word bears. Teaching,

That it is Adonaj the Lord Jehovah that has his throne and seat in heaven.
Doct.
Psalm. 11. 4. and 103. 19.

Hereby to know the true God from all false gods: Use. 1.
none the God of heaven but he Jonah. 1.

That also we hereby may understand for our comfort, Use 2.
that his rule and kingdom is over all the earth: therefore the Psalmist
puts these together, Psalm. 103. 19.

Shall have them in derision. Explanation.
] The same thing seems twice repeated, an usual thing in the Psalms to show
that it is most certain: yet indeed, as the words Shachach and lagnag are
diverse, so deriding is more then laughing, Pro. 1. 26. Psalm. 59. 9. Job. 29.
24. This therefore may be referred to the heathen and people, and the other to
the Kings and Rulers.

It is certain that it is no hard matter with God, Doct. 1.
to overthrow the raging heathen, the murmuring multitude, the proud Kings and
politic Princes of the earth, gathering together against him and his Christ.
2. Chron. 14. 11. and 20. 6. 1. Sam. 14. 6.

To believe confidently this truth in the greatest adversity, Use.
remember the story of Senacheribs hoasts overthrow: Esa. 37. 22. 29. 36. 38.
and the Ethiopians huge army, 2. Chro. 14. 9. 12. Sanballats policy
prevented, Nehe. 4. 15. and the Aramites secret counsel disclosed, 2. King. 6.
8. 9. 12.

That it is also as sure that he has them in contempt, Doct. 2.
and all their power, he laugheth at the foolish multitude, but he verily
derideth as contemptible, the high and mighty adversaries, Psalm. 59. 8.

Not to be dejected in spirit at mighty adversaries, Use.
for the greater they be against the Lord, the more he has them in contempt,
yea and will make them a derision and laughing stock.

VERSE.V.
Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, Text.
and vex them in his sore displeasure.
FOr howsoever for a while he may seem scarcely to take notice by Psalm. 10. 1.
suffering them to go on in their practices, Paraphrase.
so that they bless themselves in their Ibid.v. 3. and 13
imaginations, and say, God regards not; yet when the appointed time comes,
because they would not hear his mild voice inuiting them to obedience; then as
if Psalm. 18. 8.
smoke went out of his nostrills, so will he call to them by his wrathful
threatenings, and trouble and perplexe them with his plagues, the tokens of his
anger.

The Prophet having comforted the Church in the former verse, Explanation.
one way, here he continues it, by foreshewing how the Lord sitting in
heaven, will deal with these enemies: he will manifest his wrath against them.

God will not only laugh at and deride the folly of the wicked, Doct.
but in his wrath punish their wickedness, and plague them that hate those,
whom he has established. Psalm. 89. 20. 21. 22. 23.

This may serve for terror to the wicked, Use.
and to humble them, by considering that they are not only contemned and
derided of God, but also must expect other punishments, and judgments from
him, if they repent not.

Then. Explanation
] That is in the time appointed, not naming the time certain, but when the
Lord shall think it fit, as he has decreed, after he has beheld with
patience their wicked endeavors, and as it were sported himself with the
apprehension of their follies: then will he suddenly punish them: teaching.

That there is verily a time of punishment for Christ's enemies, Doct.
albeit we know not the very season; for Gods patient forbearing of the wicked,
will at length break forth against his enemies. Amos 8. 2. Luke 19. 43. Ezekiel.
12. 23. examples in Esaias 13. and 15. and 21. and 25. 10. -- 12. and 26. 20. 21.

Terror to the ungodly practisers against Christ and his Church: Use. 1.
let them look for a change, Psalm. 50. 22.

The Godly to learn patience, and to wait the Lords time, not fretting against
the wicked, Use 2.
Psalm. 37. 1. the godly shall not always be forgotten, consider the comforts,
Esa. 25. 8. 9. and 26. 3. 5 -- 8.

Shall he speak unto them in his wrath. Explanatio^.
] That is God shall speak, to wit, actually, declaring his anger against them:
for by speaking here is his deed doing, called speaking because his deeds are
the manifestation of his will, as if he spoke unto them; of this kind of
speaking we may read, Job. 33. 14.

That Gods works in punishing, Doct. 1.
are as his words, a kind of speaking unto us. Job. 33. 14.

To consider therefore of his chastisement, Use.
as of instructions which come to reform, when the word cannot amend, Job. 33.
16. 17. 18. or else to destroy such as are appointed for wrath.

Wrath is the reward which Gods enemies are to look for, Doct. 2.
as Christ foretells, Luke 19. 42. 43. Romans 2. 8. Zepha. 2. 2. 8. 9. 10.
Reuelat. 6. 17. and 20. 9. Psalm. 110. 5. 6. Obediah verse. 10.

To admonish the wicked to desist from their malicious purposes, Use.
if they would escape Gods wrath: they that love not blessing, it shall one day
be far enough from them. Psalm. 109. 17. Naum. 1. 9.

And vex them in his sore displeasure. Explanatio^.
] Both the former and these words also are spoken of God, after the manner of
men, to show that God does to the enemies of Christ, as men in wrath and
displeasure, who speak unto them, and punish them, so as the punished may
feel the stroke, but without respect of the parties reformation, not as a
father to amend, but as a Judge to execute justice.

That God is sore displeased with such as rise up against him and his Christ,
Doct. 1.
that is, David the type, and our Lord Jesus the antitype. Esa. 60. 12.

Fear to be enemies to such David's as God has placed over his people, Use 1.
godly Kings and governors: See Psalm. 3. 3. my glory.

Beware of withstanding Christ, Use. 2.
it sore displeases God, the vialls of his wrath powered upon the Jews, and
upon the beast and on the earth, Revelations 16. Show it to the full.

That the proud enemies of God and his Christ, Doct. 2.
in the day of wrath, shall be vexed and tormented. Revel. 6. and 16. 9. Prou.
11. 21. Esa. 8. 21. 22.

Knowing the terror of the Lord, Use 1.
to seek here to please him.

The godly to learn hence to be patient, Use 2.
though the wicked be now in pleasure, they shall be rewarded in full
vengeance. Revel. 14. 12.

That at that time, Doct. 3.
to such he shall show himself only as an auenger for things done, and not
in mercy to reclaim them, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 7. 8. but they shall have condemnation
merciless, Iam. 2. 13. Mat. 7. 23. and 25. 46.

Seek therefore betimes reconciliation with God, Use.
while he may be found, while the time of mercy abides us, Esaias 55. 6.

It may not be omitted here to consider, Explanation
how the Prophet notes the diverse sorts of enemies, and their differing
courses, and then sets God and his proceedings against them answerable in
every thing: as God to men, his sitting to their standing, heaven to earth, his
laughter to their rage and murmuring, his derision to their mightiness, pride
and policy, his speaking in wrath, to their purpose to break his bands, his
vexing them in displeasure, to their casting away of his cords: all teaching us,

That God is all-sufficient to answer the wicked every way, Doct.
wherein they are or purpose to be crosses to his holy proceedings, Psalm. 35.
1 -- 4. and 33. 10. and 3. 8. Job. 15. 12. Nehem. 4 15. the Lords preserving
the Israelites from Egypt to Canaan, and the overthrow of all their enemies, of
all sorts, every where, do show this at large, if the particulars be well
observed.

Comfort to Gods Church, Use. 1.
that God is so all-sufficient, either to bridle or overthrow our enemies every
way: with this he encouraged Abraham to walk before him. Genesis 17. 1.

To labor for his favor, Use. 2.
that he may be on our side, and to rest with him, in whom is all sufficiency
for his peoples welfare, and blessed are they whose God is the Lord. Psalm. 33.

VERSE.VI.
Even I have set my King upon Sion mine holy mountain, Text.
as if he said,
IT is not David's affecting of a kingdom: Paraphrase.
or tyrannous usurpation, but mine own work in favor toward him: Psalm. 78.
70. 71 and 1. Sam. 16. 1. 12.
he is a King of my making: even I the Lord took him from following the Ewes
great with young, and have made him King over my people Israel, and seated him
on Sion the Ps. 78. 68. and 132. 13. 14.
mountain of mine holiness, which I purchased with my right hand, and
consecrated for my temple and service. And as I called David, so for my Christ
also who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords. He Ioh. 5. 27. 43. and Heb. 5. 5.
took not this office to himself, but was by me called heereunto. I have
given him to be the Ephesians. 2. 22.
head of my Church, of which mount Sion is but a type, even my holy Church
which he has sanctified, Ephesians. 5. 26. 27.
by the washing of water through the word, that he might make it to himself
a glorious Church. Explanation.


Here David brings in God the Father speaking to these enemies of his son,
and shows why he takes David's and Christ's part, because he has appointed
them to reign.

God does not only punish, Doct. 1.
but also makes known to his enemies the just cause of his wrath. Genesis 6.
Esa. 5. 5. 6. 2. 24. Hos. 4. 1. 2. 3. 4. Ier. 18. 15. 16 17.

Therefore in stead of grudging against the punishment, Use.
they should search out the cause thereof, which God makes manifest to them, if
they would observe it, and by amendment remove the same.

That God will take part with those whom he exalts, Doct. 2.
Psalm. 89. 21 -- 24. and 105. 15. and 106. 10. 16. 17.

Great consolation to such as are put in their places by the Lord, Use.

mighty. Prou. 21. 30. Psalm. 33. 10. 11. Job. 5. 12.

and then consecrated and set in his place, so as here is anointing to note his
lawful authorizing into that high function and calling. teaching,

That David and Christ were anointed of God, Doct.

This is against such as take callings upon themselves. Use. 2.

does witness, Psalm. 78. 70. and the Lord so speaks of him. Psalm. 89. and is
called the God of David. 2. Kings. 20. 5.

Such as reign by the Lord, Doct.

who was anointed by God the Father to be our King, as is before showed.
Teaching,

That Jesus our Savior is of his Father made both Lord and Christ, Doct.
Act. 2. 36. Ephesians. 1. 20 -- 22. Psalm. 110. 1. 2.

To acknowledge him King, Use. 1.
as in John. 1. 49. and 18. 33. Mat. 2. Acts 17. 7. Phil. 2. 11.

To do him all due reverence and homage. Use 2.
Philippians 2. 9 -- 11.

Upon my holy hill Sion. Explanatio^.
] After the letter, spoken of David. he was King in Jerusalem. 2. Sam. 5. 5. 7.
9. 1. Chron. 11. 5. 7. and upon this mountain was the Temple built, and
therefore called holy, and by it meant the Church of God then, Ps. 48. 1. 2. and
50. 2. and 87. 2. 3. and 132. 13. --

That David was a King set over the visible Church of God, Doct. 1.
the people of Israel. Psalm. 78. 2. Sam. 5. 12.

To acknowledge that Kings under God may bear rule over Gods people, Use.
1. Sam. 15. 17. Psalm. 18. 43. Iud. 11. 9. 11, against the fantasy of
Anabaptists.

That places are holy that are destinate to holy uses. Doct. 2.
So Sion is here called, Esa. 65. 10. Joel. 3. 17. Zeph. 3. 11. So Jerusalem.
Mat. Use.
4. 5.

To esteem reverently of such places as are dedicated to Gods service, not in
respect of the place it self, but of the use, being set apart for the holy
worship of God, publicly to be performed of all good Christians.

Now hereby is also prefigured the Church of Christ, Explanatio^.
over which God has set him, Heb. 12. 22. 23. David was a type of Christ, and
Sion of his Church, true christian believers, whence we therefore may learn,

That Jesus Christ is the King and Lawgiver to the spiritual Sion his Church,
Doct. 1.
Iam. 4. 12.

To receive his laws and ordinances as from our King and dread Sovereign. Use.


That as David there dwelt, Doct. 2.
so Christ is ever with his Church, Mat. 28. 20.

Being of the Church, Use.
to behave thy self holy, for Christ is there: and therefore the place where
thou stand is holy ground. Exodus 3. 5. Josh. 5. 15. Act. 7. 53.

That the Church of Christ is answerable to Sion every way, Doct. 3.
as the antitype to the type, the substance to the shadow. Here a mountain;
so the true Church, Heb. 12. 22. Revel. 14. 1. Syon holy, so the Church of
Christ. 1. Pet. 2. 9.

Therefore whatsoever is spoken of the type, Use.
is much more to be believed to be true in the antitype. Now for Sion and
praises thereof, see Psalm. 48. 1. 2. 3. 8. and 50. 2. and 87. 2. 3. and 132. 13
-- Psalm. 74. 2. and 76. 2. apply them for instruction and comfort.

It may not be omitted that the Lord calls Sion his mountain, Explanation
which must be understood in a special regard, for otherwise he is the Lord of
the whole earth. Psalm. 24. 1.

As Israel then, Doct.
so the true members of Christ now, are the only peculiar people of God above
all under heaven. Tit. 2. 14. 1. Pet. 2. 9.

To rejoice in this chiefly, Use.
that by Christ thou art of the peculiar people of God. The Psalmist prayed to
see this happiness, and to rejoice therein. Psalm. 106. 5.

VERSE.VII.
I will declare the decree, Text.
that is, the Lord has said unto me, Thou art my son, this day have I
begotten thee.
NOw that already spoken, Paraphrase.
one would think should be sufficient to move any; and yet for their further
conviction, that either being thoroughly resolved they may obey, or else be
wholly left without all excuse, I the same David as a Prophet of God, do
declare this his will unto them: and if they will believe it, behold Gods own
act and decree concerning me: the tenor whereof is this: The Lord has Psalm.
132. 11.
irreuocably appointed, even he has said it, and will not repent, nor alter
the thing that is gone out of his mouth. Thou O David art typically my Psalm.
89. 26. 27 Ezekiel. 37. 24.
son, in as much as called and adopted to the function and government of my
kingdom, whom I did then as it were beget, when annoynting thee with oil, 1.
Sam. 16. 13.
and putting my spirit upon thee, and furnishing thee with gifts answerable to
thy calling, I 1. Sam. 10. 6. 9
changed thee into another man, and put another heart into thee. And thou O
Christ art truly my son, Matthew. 3. 17. Luke 1. 32. 35. Act. 13. 22. Romans 1. 4.
whom I begat eternally, yet manifested thee then, when being miraculously
conceived, through my power ouershadowing ye holy Virgin, I brought thee my
first begotten into the world, and raised thee from the dead: whereby I
declared thee mightily to be my son.

In this verse the Prophet David for himself, Explanation.
and also in the person of Christ, plainly shows, that what is done of them
both, was Gods decree, and therefore David knew their attempts against him and
Christ were vain.

The regiment of David, Doct. 1.
and so of Christ, was foreordained of the Lord, before they were established
actually. Psalm. 110.

Not to think that Kings do reign at their pleasure, Use.
but at Gods appointment: or that the Gospel, by which Christ reigns, comes
by chance, but as God has decreed.

That therefore such as then resisted David and Christ, Doct. 2.
now resist Gods decree in and upon them.

Therefore let such resisters know, that as the Apostle says, Use.
Romans 13. 2. they must receive to themselves condemnation.

I will declare the decree.

Thus David speaks as a Teacher, Explanation.
that he is willing to make known Gods decree concerning him, to stay the
enemies if it be possible. Teaching,

The true knowledge of Gods will in our standing, Doct.
is a strong bulwark of defense, to oppose against all enemies: therefore
D^uid here publishes it: so the Apostle, Act. 26. 19. 20. So Iere. 17. 16.

To ascertaine our selves of Gods good will and certain decree for our places
and standings, Use.
that we may be able to object the same to our enemies, either for their
conversion, or to leave them inexcusable, and is to us assurance of defense,
compare Iere. 17. 16. with 20. 11.

This being understood of Christ, Explanation.
who also did declare what he was, and what God had decreed concerning him, as
may be seen in all his disputations against his adversaries; we do learn,

That Christ was to be also a Prophet and a Preacher, Doct. 1.
as well as a King. Deuteronomy. 18. Act. 13.

To acknowledge then his prophetical office here foretold, Use.
and as the Father commands, hear him. Mat. 17.

That so he indeed preached unto the people his Fathers decree, Doct. 2.
as all the Evangelists do witness, and so this prophecy of him to be true.

To acknowledge David a true Prophet of God. Use. 1.


Behold Christ's love and mercy, Use 2.
who would not hide from his enemies his Fathers will, if they would have
believed it.

Reproof to such, Use 3.
first, as despise the calling of a Teacher: secondly, as being Teachers in
name, do yet neglect to declare Gods decree indeed.

The Lord has said unto me.

Understanding it of David first the type, Explanation.
who does show that this decree was made known to himself, Doct.
we learn,

That it is not enough to have the word of God to warrant the action: but for a
calling thereto in our place and standing: 2. Chron. 35. 21. Heb. 4. 5. Ios. 1.
9. Judge. 6. 14.

To be able to apply the word of Gods decree truly and rightly to our selves
in our place and calling: Use.
for that warranteth a good action to our selves.

Understanding these words of Christ, Explanatio^.
we do learn,

That God the Father is Christ's Lord (according to his humanity) as he here
acknowledges. Doct. 1.


Therefore all Kings to acknowledge the same much more, Use.
and show it by fear, Mat. 1. 6.

That he published that which he first heard his Father speak unto him. Doct.
2.
Ioh. 12. 49. and 7. 16. and 14. 24.

The Ministers of Christ to learn hence by him, Use.
to speak only what they learn from the Lord, so commanded, Mat. 28 Mark. 16.
1. Pet. 4. 11. so did the Prophets, Ier. 47. 1. Hos. 1. 1. Joel. 1. 1. Act. 26.
22. 1. Cor. 11. 23.

Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.

David might in some sort say thus as a type of Christ, Explanatio^.
and so above all Angels, and as a King, Psalm. 82. 6. and 89. 6. so in Psalm.
89. 26. 27. and as a boly man, the Child of God by adoption.

Kings, Doct.
especially the godly, are very near and dear unto God. Psalm. 82. 6.

Not to rebel against them, Use. 1.
they be the children of the most highest. David did not touch the lap of Saul's
garment, but with a check of conscience, though it was without an evil
intendment.

Let Iesuited Traitors and murderers of Kings take knowledge of this, Use 2.
and restrain their hellish malice against the Lords anointed: for who so
provoke them to anger, sins against his own soul: Pro. 20. 2.

This is spoken of Christ as of the verity, Explanation
and this is one part of that decree, which he was to publish to the world at
his coming: by This day, may either be understood the perpetual act of his
eternal generation, or else his manifestation in the flesh, especially by
raising him up from the dead, Act. 13 33. and it is, as if it were said: Now at
this time I have manifested thee to be my begotten son. From hence we may
learn,

That Jesus Christ was and is the very son of God, Doct. 1.
and thus three ways: first, By eternal generation: so the only begotten
son, Heb. 1. 15. Ioh. 1. 14. Secondly, by his perfect sanctification and
personal union of both natures, Luke 1. 35. Ioh. 10. 36. Thirdly, as King; so
Psalm. 82. 6. Ioh. 10. 34. -- 36.

To acknowledge this, Use. 1.
Ioh. 1. with Peter, Mat. 16. Ioh. 6. 69. and with the Centurion, and Martha,
Ioh. 11. 27.

To make a difference of all other sons of God from him, Use 2.
as he in sonne-ship differs from them, 1. Ioh. 3. 1. Galath. 4. 4. Ioh. 1. 12.

That in time he was declared so to be, Doct. 2.
Romans 1. 4. Act. 13. 33.

To confirm our faith in this truth to our great comfort, Use.
when we be sure that our Savior is the only son of God.

That this doctrine as a maine and most principal point, Doct. 3.
was to be taught unto the people as the scope of the Gospel. Ioh. 20. 31.

To study this point as the principal article of our Christian faith. Use.


If we consider this as a reason, Explanation
why God did anoint Christ, and set him over his Church as King, viz. for that
he was his only son, we learn,

That Jesus Christ has only right to be King over Gods people, Doct.
as the only son and heir of his Father. Heb. 1.

To yield therefore this high and sovereign authority unto Christ alone, Use 1.
as so ordained of his Father. Act. 2. 36.

To hold it high treason to place any other over ye Church, Use. 2.
as the spiritual head and sovereign between God and his people, but him
only.

These words are by the Apostle alleged to prove Christ's Priesthood,
Explanatio^.
Heb. 4. 4. and 5. 1.

Jesus Christ as he is our King and our teacher: Doct.
so our high Priest unto God. Heb. 4. 4. and 5.

By him only to seek an atonement with God, Use.
and to offer up our sacrifices. For in him only is he well pleased, Mat. 3.
17. Esa. 42. 1.

VERSE VIII.
Ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, Text.
and the ends of the world thy possession.
ANd as for thee, Paraphrase.
thou art so altogether after mine own heart, and have found such favor with
me, and I am in thee so well pleased, that Psalm. 21. 2.
I will give thee thine hearts desire, and will not deny the request of thy
lips. Ask therefore of me abundantly gifts, and honor and dominion, and I
will give thee not the one half of my kingdom, but all the Gentiles for thine
heritage Isai. 18. 7.
, which as a present shall be brought unto thee, though now a people scattered
abroad and spoiled: Psalm. 7^. 8. 11. and Ps. 22. 27. 28.
thy dominion also shall be from sea to sea, and the ends of the earth shall be
thy sure possession: all Kings shall worship thee, all nations shall do thee
service.

These words are another part of the decree, Explanatio^.
which the Prophet foretells, Christ should declare in his person to the people:
the former concerned his person, this his kingdom: teaching,

That another maine doctrine of Christ's ministry was, Doct.
to publish the nature and largeness of his kingdom and dominion: of which
the Prophets foretold, Psalm. 72. 8. Esa. 60. 3. and Christ himself speaks of
also, Ioh. 12. 32.

This doctrine must we take notice of, Use.
and labor to understand it: the error whereof did blind, and so does to this
day, the miserable Jews, who still look for an earthly pompous Messiah to
exalt them again in an outward earthly glory.

Ask of me.

Here the words of God the Father are brought in, Explanatio^.
to express his power to give, and readiness to enlarge David's and Christ's
kingdom, as another reason to confound the enemies, and to show their attempts
to be vain.

It is altogether vain to oppose, Doct.
and to keep straight, such as God is willing to make mighty, and to give
them large dominions. See in Nabuchadnezzar* Cyrus, Alexander, the Romans, Dan.
2. 17. -- 44. Iere. 27. 5. 6. 8.

This should admonish all in stead of opposing themselves, Use.
rather with quietness to take upon themselves the yoke of Kings and Princes,
whom God has established, and as the Prophet Jeremy exhorts concerning
Nabuchadnezzar* to pray for them, and seek their peace: for in their peace
shall themselves have peace, Iere. 27. and 29. 7.

These words are used to express Gods singular love: Explanation
for so the speech is used, when one would show how much he is well pleased
with another. Mar. 6. 22. 1. King. 3. 5.

David was greatly beloved of the Lord, Doct.
one after his own heart. Of this love read Psalm. 89. 2. Sam. 8. 14.

Princes to follow the steps of David, Use.
that they may be beloved of the Lord, as all the Kings of Judah were, that did
walk in his steps.

Understand these words of the father, Explanation.
so spoken to Christ, as Christ act: for the fathers will to him shows the
sons act indeed.

Jesus Christ is dearly beloved of his father, Doct.
and so well pleased with him, as he can deny him nothing, Mat. 17. 5. Ioh. 11.
42. 2. Pet. 1. 17.

To hear him: Use 1.
This use the Father teaches: Matthew 17. 5.

To rejoice that we have such an advocate with the father, 1. Ioh. 2. 1. whom
the Father will hear in any thing. Ioh. 11. 42. Romans 8. 34.

To believe constantly, Use. 2.
this authority of the Son to be so great with the Father.

And I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, Use. 3.
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

This is true in some sort of David, Text.
who did subdue all his enemies round about him, as his story shows, 2. Sam.
8. but this is most fully accomplished in Christ, if we do consider the
nature of his kingdom, which is spiritual, and therefore spiritually
discerned.

All the earth is in Gods hands to give as he pleases: Explanation.
Ier. 27. 5. Dan. 4. 29. which he gives to his son Jesus Christ the heir of
all. Heb. 1. 2.

Therefore to pray unto him to enlarge the kingdom of his son, Use.
to whom he has made this so large promise.

That Jesus Christ reigns over whom he pleases, Doct. 2.
and where he lists: for his father bids him but ask and it shall be
given him, Ioh. 3. 8. Act. 16. 6. 7. 9.

Exceeding comfort to the Church, Use 1.
that Christ is able to reign where he lists.

To humble such over whom Christ reigns not: Use 2.
for it is because he will not reign over them.

By heathen are meant all people excepting the Jewish nation, Explanation
the only people of God then visibly.

The Jews did not only appertain to Christ's kingdom, Doct. 1
but the Gentiles also, as appears this day, and in Esa. the 60. and Psalm.
72. 11. foretold.

To confute the obstinacy of the Jews, Use.
who cannot abide this doctrine, Act. 22. though taught by the Prophets.

That we are the gift of God the Father unto the son: Doct. 2.
the son has none but what are given him of the father. Ioh. 17. and such as
the father draws. Ioh. 6. 37. 44. 65.

To praise the goodness of the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Use.
who of his mercy has given us to his son: which we have great cause to do
if we consider what we Gentiles were. Ephesians. 2. 12. Col. 1. 21.

The bounds here noted are the uttermost parts of the earth, Explanatio^.
all the parts of the inhabited world: for so far the dominions of Christ
should extend: to teach,

That the Church of Christ which is his kingdom here, Doct. 1.
is Catholic. Psalm. 72. 8. --

To believe the Catholic Church. Use 1.


To confute those that tie it to a particular place, Use. 2.
as the Donatists did to Afric, and the Papists to the sea of Rome.

That Jesus Christ is the greatest Monarch of the world: Doct. 2.
Heb. 1. 2. Matthew. 11. 27. and 28. 18. Ioh. 3. 35. Dan. 4. 22. 29. and
therefore sent he his Disciples over all the world: Mark. 16.

All to acknowledge him King of Kings, Use.
Reuelat. 19. 16. And all to worship him and do him service. Ps. 72. 11.

VERSE.IX.
Thou shall crush them with a scepter of Iron, Text.
and break them in pieces like a potters vessel.
ANd for that the Scepter of thy kingdom is a Psalm. 45. 6.
Scepter of righteousness, Paraphrase.
and in thy days Psalm. 72. 7.
shall the righteous flourish, therefore the nations that will not serve thee,
them will I judge says God: such thou shall subdue through thy strong might:
in stead of a golden scepter, thou shall stretch forth an iron rod against
them, and in the severity of thy judgment beat them to pieces: and both easily
and utterly destroy them, for as the Ier. 19. 11. Isai. 30. 14. Revel. 2. 27.
breaking of an earthen pot with an iron bar, that cannot be made whole
again; so shall their breaking and destruction be without pity, without
recovery.

Here the Prophet shows the end of Christ's obstinate enemies, Explanation.
and therefore in vain they oppose his power, which is also another reason,
why he said they imagined a vain thing.

That vain are their enterprises (may we well say) whose end we know to be
destruction through the same, Doct.
for wickedness burns as fire.

To see the vanity of the attempts of the wicked against Christ and his Church,
Use.
consider their end.

Thou, Explanation
etc.] The words are the continued speech of the Father, as part of his
decree. The first of his person, verse 7. The second of his rule over his
people, verse. 8. The third, here the overthrow of his obstinate enemies: this
is also understood of David, who was a type of Christ herein and subdued his
obstinate enemies, 2. Sam. 10. 18. 19. and 11. 1. and 12. 31. and 8. 1. 2. 5.
14. 1. Chronicles. 18. and 19. 18. we learn,

That it is God that gives victory and power to Kings to overcome their
enemies. Doct.
2. Sam. 5. 19. 24. 2. Chron. 13. 15. 27. Deuteronomy. 25. 19. Ios. 10. 25. Psalm. 47.
3.

To pray to God in going to battle as Iehosophat, Use. 1.
2. Chr. 20. 6.

To acknowledge the victory from him, Use. 2.
and to give him praise, as the same good King Iehosophat did, 2. Chron. 20.
for it is not power or multitude, Psalm. 33. 16. 17. 2. Chron. 14. 9. 12. 1.
King. 20. 15. 16. 20. nor policy, 2. Chron. 13. 13. 15. that can prevail
without the Lord, Psalm. 127. 1.

Understanding it of Christ, Explanation
it teaches,

That God the Father has decreed, Doct.
that as Christ his son shall have a people and a large dominion, so in like
manner, invincible power to destroy his enemies, Dan. 2. 44. Revel. 2. 27 Psalm.
110. 5.

Not to fear the overthrow of Christ's kingdom, Use.
by any enemies: God has decreed the contrary, it shall stand for ever.

Shall break them. Explanation.
] The word ragnang translated break, or by some bruise, is out of displeasure
to handle roughly. Job. 34. 24. and thus will Christ do to his obstinate
enemies.

Though Christ be a Lamb to his people, Doct. 1.
yet is he the Lion of Iudab to his enemies; as he is meek and merciful to
his own, so can he be angry and handle roughly others. Matt. 21. 41. Luke. 19.
27.

To take knowledge of Christ's wrath, Use.
and that he will handle roughly his obstinate enemies: for whom Gods mercy
cannot move, those shall the sincerity of his justice break.

The Lord can break the conjoined power, Doct. 2.
and will do it, Esa. 8. 9. 10.

Comfort to the godly against the confederacy of all the wicked against them,
Use.
Esaias 8. 13. 14. Nehem. 4, 15.

With a rod of iron. Explanation
] Shebet translated rod, is used for a Scepter, and this put for power of
government. Genesis 49. 10* so it is the rod of his power, Psalm. 110. 2. and it
may be understood of the word, Esaias 11. 4. or punishment, and it is said to be
of iron for the strength and dureablenesse thereof, understanding it of the
word learn,

That the word of God is of great strength, Doct.
to beat down his enemies as an iron rod. 2. Cor. 10. 14. 2. These. 2. 8. Hos.
6. 5. Ier. 1. 10. Esa. 11. 4.

To fear and tremble at Gods word, Use. 1.
it is a two-edged sword, Hebr. 4. it is the Savor of life or death, 2. Cor.
2. 16. else took for judgment, Isa. 30. 12. 13.

Ministers to acknowledge it a special grace, Use 2.
Romans 1. 5. to be the bearers of Christ's scepter, and rod to smite the enemies;
who is sufficient for these things, 2. Cor. 2. 16.

Taking the word for his divine power in punishing as we may well, Explanation.
for that the same followers upon the contempt of his word, we learn,

That strong and irresistable punishments shall be laid upon Christ's enemies.
Doct.
They shall feel it as a rod of iron, Revel. 3. 27. breaking them as earthen
vessels, Ier. 19. 11.

For admonition to the enemies, Use.
to humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, 1. Pet. 5. 6. For they
cannot avoid his plagues when they come upon them. Consider, Isa. 47. 11. 12.
13. 14.

Thou shall dash them in pieces like a potters vessel. Explanatio^.
] This is a similitude, in which he compares the enemies power to an earthen
broken vessel of the potters, and his own power to an iron rod, by which he
breaks them to pieces and scatters them abroad, as the word naphats
signifies,

The power of Christ's enemies is but as a bruised or cracked earthen pot: Doct.
soon overthrown by Christ's iron power, Dan. 2. 44.

Let none of the enemies of Christ boast vainly of their power, Use.
behold here what it is.

The ruin of the wicked in the day of vengeance is irrecouerable. Doct. 2.
Psalm. 50. 22. Esa. 30. 14. Ier. 3. 11. and 19. 11. Nahum. 1. 8. 9. 10. and 3.
19. Zeph. 2. 9. Esa. 47. 9. Mat. 21. 44.

Terror to all the ungodly upon whom waits perfection of plagues. Use. 1.


Comfort to the godly, Use. 2.
that one day they shall see Christ utterly to destroy his enemies.

VERSE.X.
Be wise now therefore ye Kings, Text.
be learned ye that are Judges of the earth.
SVch is Gods counsel and decree concerning me, Paraphrase.
which in his mercy he would make known, least ignorance should mislead you
to your own overthrow. Now therefore O Kings and Judges of the earth, hearken
and consider, to you Ia speak by name: Ier. 5. 5.
you are Kings, and what more odious to you then rebellion, and banding
complotments of your seditious subjects? you are Judges, and what more heinous
then to contemn your just decrees? do not then rebel against your Lord and
King: withstand not his just and stable decree: howsoever hitherto out of your
foolish and rash Counsel, you have opposed your selves, yet be wise at last
and obey. It is not your greatness that can secure you from destruction, nor
exempt you from obedience: as you were chief in opposition, so be you first in
submission, and yielding your selves plyant, that the more flexible multitude
may follow you.

Now the Psalmist makes the use of this his former doctrine, Explanation
exhorting the mightiest well to consider of that which has been said, and to
become obedient, which is the third and last part of this Psalm.

The drift of all faithful teachers, Doct.
is by their doctrine to bring men in obedience to Christ: David's end here:
Peter Acts. 2. 36. 38. so S. Paul in all his Epistles concluding ever with
exhortations to practice.

In teaching to exhort to obedience as the scope of our doctrine: Use.
without obedience, neither hearing, Romans 2. Iam. 1. 22. nor knowledge. 1. John
2. 4. nor faith, Iam. 2. 17. nor calling on God, Esa. 1. Mat. 7. 21. nor
Preaching, Mat. 7. 23. nor fasting, Esa. 58. nor love, 1. John 5. 2. nor
coming to Church, Explanatio^.
Esa. 1. Ier. 7. nor baptism, 1. Cor. 7. avails any thing.

Albeit that David knew that some enemies of Christ should perish through their
obstinacy, as also many of his, for that they would stand out against him: yet
not knowing who would repent, he offers means to them here to reclaim them.

That hopeful charity makes Gods true messengers to speak to most wicked
men, Doct.
to gain (if it be Gods will) some of them. So Christ to the Scribes and
Pharisees: so the Apostles, Act. 8. 22. and 13. 46. and 7. 2. 51.

Ministers to have this charitable hope, Use.
that thereby they may do as David, as Christ, and his Apostles did, even to
preach to, and exhort the worst, to see if God at any time will give them
repentance, 2. Tim. 2. 25.

And now. Explanation
] Vau gnattah, the time is noted, to show when he would have them to repent,
even now without delay.

A faithful teacher wishes the present and speedy conversion of the people,
Doct. 1.
to whom he speaks. Colos. 3. 8. Psalm 95. Hebr. 3.

To be thus earnestly affected for the peoples salvation, Use.
as God is. Psalm. 95. Heb. 3. Col. 3. 8.

Repentance is not to be deferred off, Doct. 2.
but when the means is offered, then is the time. Act. 17. 30. 2. Cor. 6. 2.
Heb. 3. 7.

Not to put it off from day to day: Use.
for if the day of wrath come, then repentance will not avail us, to move us
to repent and consider. Luke. 12. 20. and 17. 27. 1. Thessal. 5. 3. Ier. 13.
23. Eccles. 12. 1. Pro. 1. 28. Psalm. 18. 26.

Be wise. Explanatio^.
] The verb shacal is to do considerately, David here shows what they do
want, and so what it is that makes them not yield to Christ, even want of
knowledge and true wisdom.

The ignorance of Christ makes natural men enemies unto him, Doct. 1.
1. Cor. 2. 8. Acts 3. 17. Luke 23. 34.

To learn to know Christ aright, Use.
to do this, learn the parts of Gods decree here, which David declares
touching his person, kingdom and power over his enemies, which David held
sufficient to teach, and to bring thereby these to Christ's obedience. Doct. 2.


That they are not truly wise (be they never so great) that are not obedient
unto Christ, yea S. Paul held himself mad, while he was raging against
poor Christians, Acts 26. 11.

To hold the wisest of the world fools and mad, Use.
so long as they be against Christ.

In that David here exhorts to wisdom, Explanatio^.
before service in the next verse, he would teach us,

That knowledge necessarily must be had, Doct.
before we can obey, therefore David asks knowledge, and then promises
obedience, Ps. 86. 11. Esa. 2. 3.

To become obedient, Use 1.
get knowledge, Prou. 4. 5. Ephesians. 5. 17. Col. 3. 16. without which we cannot
believe, Romans 10. we can have no conscience of our duty.

This is against our adversaries, Use. 2.
who make ignorance the mother of devotion, contrary to Mat. 22. 29. and 5. 39.

O ye Kings. Explanation.
] To these he first does speak, and not to the multitude, albeit he spoke of
them, ver. 1. as enemies, not in contempt, or carelessness of their salvation,
but for that they are Iedde by the mighty, and therefore to these he first
turues his speech.

It is a chief point of wisdom in the furtherance of Christ's kingdom, Doct.
1.
to win first the mighty. The godliness of an Hezechias or Josias makes all
the people to seek the Lord, so one Constantine makes a Christian world.

To use the best means for the conversion of the mighty, Use.
and to pray heartily unto God to turn the hearts of such, that by their
examples many may be provoked unto well-doing.

That it is their duty before all others to entertain religion. Doct. 2.
Deuteronomy. 17. Esa. 49. 23.

Kings and Princes to acknowledge this their duty before all others, Use.
because they owe the more unto God for their places and wealth.

Be instructed. Explanation.
] As some read, be ye learned, Iasar properly signifies to be chastified, but
yet as well with words, Pro. 29. 19. Ps. 39. 11. as rods, 1. King. 12. 2. Chr.
10. 11. 14. so it must be such a learning as may be a chastisement unto them.

The best may learn, Doct.
if they will become obedient unto Christ: for so Christ teaches his Disciples
to do, Matthew 28. 18. 19. 20. Mark. 16. Act. 2. 41. which who so refuses
cannot be of Christ's flock, Act. 13. 46.

To yield to the word though it may be mus^^^ Use 1.
a disciplining and chastisement unto you. This is to become truly wise, Deuteronomy.
4. 6. Psalm. 111. 10. Matthew. 7. 24. Psalm. 32. The title. Deuteronomy. 17. 19.

Reproof to the proud and mighty, Use. 2.
which commonly despise to be taught by way of reproof: but remember 2. Chro.
25. 16. Esa. 69. 12. Iere. 7. 13. Esa. 30. 12. 13. Act. 13. 46.

Ye Judges of the earth. Explanation.
] Here are meant those that exercise authority under Princes, called before
Rulers, here Judges. Shophet is one, that knows to judge between cause and
cause for the defense of the innocent, and punishment of the offenders: these
he exhorts with Kings, whom he calls Judges of the earth, as he did Kings
before, verse. 2. to teach,

That it is as necessary for Rulers and Judges to learn this wisdom, Doct. 1.
with their Kings, as for Kings themselves; else Kings can do little, where
their Princes and Magistrates be wicked.

If Kings become religious, Use.
let them take to them such as are also religious. It is true, Kings should be
first: but then next, their Nobles and Rulers; else Ioash will not continue
religious, if Iehoiadah be dead, and wicked Princes remain about him.

That as they be Kings of the earth, Doct. 2.
so also Judges of the earth, all earthly which are not in subjection to Christ.

Such as be not subject to Christ, Use.
let them know themselves to be but earthly, and therefore must pray unto the
Lord to be framed of a better mould, that as the Apostle speaks, Romans 6. 17.
they may obey from the heart, the form of the doctrine whereunto the word of
God does call them.

VERSE.XI.
Serve the Lord in fear, Text.
and rejoice in trembling.
NEither do I call you to my servitude, Paraphrase.
but Gods service: Psalm. 45. 11.
he is your Lord God, and worship you him. And as for this, did you well
consider, it is no matter of sorrow, but rather of joy, Psalm. 60. 8.
to be his servants, who rules only for your peace: rejoice therefore and
triumph: the Lord reigns, Psalm. 97. 1.
be you glad thereof: and yet forget not your selves to be subjects Heb. 12.
28. Psalm. 4. 4. Phil. 2. 12.
: mix the joy of your weal, with the reverence of his majesty, and so stand
in awe that you sin not.

Serve the Lord] Here is showed, Explanation
whereto they must be wise, and what this their wisdom is, even to do
service to the Lord: the word gnabad is to serve as a servant to his Lord. Genesis
29. 18.

The wisdom and learning that God requires, Doct. 1
is to do him service: this he accounts wisdom, Deuteronomy. 4. 6. Psalm 111. 10.
Matthew. 7. 24.

Not to think that thou have attained true wisdom and learning in profession
of Christ, Use.
till thou do him service: 1. Ioh. 2. 4. Romans 2. 13. Luke 12. 47. Iam. 1. 22.

That Kings and Princes are not to live as they list, Doct. 2.
but in subjection unto Christ. Esa. 60. 12. Psalm. 72. 10. 11.

To square their lives to the rule of Christ's will as his true servants, Use.
to whom they also, with the meanest, are to yield a strict account.

The Psalmist does not will them to cast off their authority, Explanation.
but calls them Kings and Rulers so to serve him. Learn,

That Christ's kingdom is not against the earthly dominion of Princes, Doct. 1.
to overthrow it, as Herod dreamed, Mat. 2. for his kingdom is not of this
world. Ioh. 18. 36.

Let not Princes therefore fear to entertain Christ, Use.
and to become his subjects: hereby they do nothing at al diminish their
earthly glory, but shall by thus doing live, more securely under Gods
protection.

That men may do service to God, Doct. 2.
and yet be Kings and Governors, as zealous David, godly Josias and other holy
Kings in Judah.

Against the foolish practices of such as gave over their rule, in conceit to
serve God better: when they could have honored Christ no way more, then in
using their high authority to Christ's service.

With fear. Explanation
] The manner of this service here is noted Ieraah is a reverend awe, commended
to be the beginning of wisdom, Pro. 1. 7. this is required in Christ's service.

Reverend fear is a special grace in Gods service, Doct.
1. Pet. 2. 17. Heb. 12. 28. Mat. 4. 10. with Deuteronomy. 10. 20. and 6. 13. Esa. 8.
13. Eccles. 12. 13. Mat. 1. 6.

To fear the Lord, Use 1.
and shake off carnal security in our profession of Christianity, as also
our pride, both which are contrary to true fear.

Reproof to the proud-ones, Use. 2.
to all that live in a worldly security, under the profession of Christianity,
though they be never so mighty. Genesis 42. 18.

And rejoice. Explanatio^.
] The word gil, is to rejoice internally: so it makes him skip for joy, this is
added to fear, and now is the time of Kings, and Princes, and others to
rejoice when they be under Christ's obedience, for now the Prophet exhorts them
to joy.

There is no cause of true joy to Kings or Princes, Doct. 1.
or any other, till they have been wise, learned Christ, and put themselves
into his service, with fear and reverence, Luke 15. 23.

To be a partaker of true joy, Use.
become a true Christian: for such may rejoice. Luke 10. 20. Psalm. 32. 11.
Phil. 4. 4. Esa. 51. 3. and 54. 1. and Zeph. 3. 14 --.

So is our service to Christ mixed with fear, Doct. 2.
as also there is true cause of joy, 1. Pet. 1. 8. Esa. 9. 3. and liberty to
rejoice, Psalm. 122. 1. and 68. 3. and 106. 5. Iere. 9. 24. Luke 10. 20. and it
is a voluntary and not a coacted service. Psalm 110. 3. Esa. 2. 3. Mich. 4. 2.

Not to think Christianity to be a heavy, Use 1.
lumpish and comfortless sadness, but that therein is true joy: and that it
is lawful for the godly to express also their joy in lawful things
outwardly. Deuteronomy. 12. 18. Nehem. 8. 10. -- 12.

To labor to feel this true joy in Christ's service. Use 2.
1. Cor. 1. 31. 2. Cor. 10. 17.

With trembling. Explanation.
] With fear is added rejoicing, and now to this trembling, as if he had said,
So serve with fear, as yet serve him with cheerefulnes, love and delight, not
constrained, and so be merry and glad, that yet you degenerate not into
carnal security and neglect of him.

God affoordeth joy unto his people, Doct.
and wills them to rejoice, yet so, as he will not have it break out into
licentious liberty, Galath. 5. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 16. S. Paul's example for this,
who was full of joy upon several occasions; yet he beat down his body, 1.
Cor. 9. 29.

Reproof to such as turn the grace of God into wantonness, Use.
when we are exhorted to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.
Christian religion is not an idle, secure, and wanton profession, but a
service, to be performed with fear and trembling. Phil. 2. 12. Heb. 12. 38.
Hab. 2. 4.

VERSE.XII.
Kiss the son lest he be angry, Text.
and ye perish in the way, if his wrath shall suddenly burn: blessed are all
they that trust in him.
ANd finally, Paraphrase.
as you have banded your selves, not only against the Lord, but his Christ
too: so must you not only serve him, but his Son and Anointed also: he is
your King, and Prince of your salvation Ioh. 5. 23.
. Do you homage and fealty unto him, in submitting your selves to his laws
and word: otherwise know, that you shall but provoke him to anger, Iere. 21. 12.
and kindle his wrath, the least spark whereof shall be sufficient to destroy
you, even in the midst of your intendments before you can effect them: yea
rather while you have time, before his whole displeasure like a fiery tempest
arise against you, hearken and obey, and by a sincere faith believe in him,
because all such, and they only, are truly happy who trust in him.

Kiss. Explanation.
] The Psalmist still continues his exhortation to urge obedience to the Lord.
Nasach to kiss, is put for reverence and high estimation, Pro. 24. 26. for
love and affection, Iere. 29. 13. and for obedience, Genesis 41. 40. so the word
is in the Hebrew, and all may well be here meant.

The service due to Christ, Doct.
is a reverend obedience, with an high estimation of him in love, Heb. 12. 28.
Phil. 3. 8. Ioh. 21. 15.

To do him all homage, Use. 1.
being obedient in a reverend love, and high esteem of his person, as our
dread Sovereign, all the Kings and Princes of the earth owe this unto him.

This reproves those that profess him, Use 2.
but will do him no service; or if they do service, it is without that
reverence and due esteem, which is required of them.

The son. Explanation.
] David before urging service to the Lord, now applies it to the Son:
thereby teaching,

That God is then served when his Son is acknowledged, Doct.
and obeyed as Lord and King, Ioh. 5. 23. 1. Ioh. 2. 22. 23. 1. Ioh. 5. 1.

This condemns all service of Turks, Use.
Jews, and Heathen, which honor not Christ as the Son of God, and as Lord
and King, John 3. 18. 1. Ioh. 5. 12. for Christ is God. Romans 9. 5. one with the
Father, Ioh. 17.

David might have said, Explanation
kiss the King, as he was ordained of God, verse. 5. but here he sets down the
title of Son: to learn,

That the chiefest honor to Christ is to be accounted the son of God: Doct.
in this title the Father proclaims him, Mat. 3. and 17. the Apostles confess
him, Mat. 16. 16.

To hold and acknowledge this chiefly, Use.
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the scope of the Gospel, Ioh. 20. 31.

Lest he be angry. Explanation
] By he is meant God the Father: David says not lest, as Eve did, Genes. 3. to
make a peradventure of his wrath, but to show that God is patient, if men
provoke him not to wrath. The word Anaph to be angry, signifies to be angry
as one in a rage.

That God the Father is he that is provoked to wrath, Doct.
when his Son is not obeyed. Therefore does Christ on the Cross entreat his
Father to forgive his enemies, Luke 23. 34.

To fear the wrath of God the Father in contemning his Son. Use.
Behold the Jews. Read Deuteronomy. 18. 19. Hebr. 12. 25. The consideration hereof,
should make men obey the son: it is David's argument here.

If the word he be referred to the son, Explanation
we may learn, That though Christ be meek as a lamb, Doct.
yet may he be provoked to fierce wrath by obstinate contempt of his person,
and can be very angry. See Mark. 3. 5. Revel. 2. 16. 22. 23. and 3. 16. and 6.
16. Luke 19. 27.

Consider this, Use.
that Christ Jesus can be angry, against such as will not yield him obedience,
that we may subject our selves unto him, lest we provoke him to wrath, who one
day will render vengeance to his enemies* 2 Thessalonians. 1. 7. 8. Luke 19. 27. Mat.
27.

And ye perish in (or from) the right way.

That is, Explanation.
ye which will not do him homage, perish, that is, be taken away, destroyed,
in, or from the way, that is, suddenly, whilst you are in your way, course,
and practice against him.

That the just anger of God and Christ against their enemies brings
destruction. Doct. 1.
Judge. 2. 14. 15.

Do not therefore offend him, Use.
nor provoke him to anger, but mere him in all humility. Amos 4. 12.

That destruction shall come upon the wicked, Doct. 2.
even in their way, or Pro. 5. 22. and 11. 5. Iere. 4. 18. and 2. 19.
from their course, when they least think upon it they shall be taken away.
Mat. 24. 5. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 3.

Be warned and shake off all security in sinning against God: Use.
lest that day come upon you unawares.

When his wrath is kindled but a little. Explanation.
] The word bagnar, here translated his wrath kindled, is properly to burn as
fire, and metaphorically to be inflamed with anger, like fire destroying
(without mercy) the parties with whom such a one is angry, Ester 1. 12. like
the rage of Nabuchadnezzar, Daniel 3. 13. 19.

The least degree of Gods wrath is like burning fire to destroy and devour up
his enemies, Doct.
Iere. 21. 12.

Tremble at the consideration hereof when by sin we do offend God: Use.
it is to bring fire and burning destruction upon us. Esai. 9. 18.

Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

A comfortable sentence to the Church of Christ as a motive to hold them
constant to him, Explanatio^.
which have betaken themselves to his protection: a fit conclusion to this
evangelical Psalm: whence we may learn,

That Christ can and does make His blessed: Doct. 1.
Revel. 2. 7. 11. 17. 27. 28. and 3. 5. 12. 21. Ioh. 10. 28. Genesis 22. 18. Gal.
3. 14.

Have recourse unto Christ, Use.
if we would be blessed: for else are we accursed and subject to the fiery
wrath of God.

That all that are Christ's without exception are blessed, Doct. 2.
they be the blessed company, Mat. 25. 34.

To account such as be Christ's, Use 1.
though never so mean, to be blessed ones.

Singular comfort that thou art a true Christian, Use. 2.
and so blessed from that burning displeasure of God, by thy Savior Christ
Jesus.

That all these blessed, Doct. 3.
are so by faith, and putting their trust in him. Ioh. 3. 16. 36. and 6. 40.
47. and 7. 38. and 11. 25.

To have our faith and affiance in him: Use.
the word Chasah is to have a firm assurance of protection, and to have
recourse to him, as to a place of refuge, as indeed the Lord is to His. Esa.
25. 4.

To conclude, Explanatio^.
though David in the former doctrinall part of the Psalm spoke to ye enemies,
as well of his, as of Christ's: yet when he makes his exhortation, he urges
them to obey the Lord, and to yield him service, thereby, being a King, and a
Prophet, he teaches,

That in claiming our right, Doct.
the drift and conclusion both of Kings and Prophets should be, to bring all
in obedience to the Lord.

All Kings and Prophets aim at this, Use.
in standing upon your dignities and callings.

The third Psalm.
THE ARGUMENT.
IN this Psalm (being mixed) David now driven out of his kingdom by Absalom,
does complain to God of the number and grieuousnesse of his enemies, not only
breaking forth into an open insurrection against him, but also with blasphemies
against God, and contumelies against himself, insulting over him, as a man
utterly forsaken and forlorn. Yet nevertheless he gathers comfort to
himself from Gods defense, which he assures himself of, from the experience
that he formerly had of his help at hand, when he called upon him. Thus being
confirmed, he shows his security and confidence against the greatest dangers,
and that through Gods protection, which he most earnestly craves, ascribing
the praise of his deliverance to him alone.

The use and profit of this Psalm.
THis Psalm is of great use and profit to the Church, especially to such as be
under the Cross and rod of God; for here a man may see as in a glass, by
David's behavior, what he is to do, to whom to fly, to whom to complain, how
to be comforted in such trouble and distress, how to shake off all worldly
fear, and in whom to trust; lastly how to be exercised in so great peril, and
to whom to ascribe the glory of deliverance and victory.

The resolution of this Psalm.
This contains, 1. The title, or inscription, showing 1. The Author, David.
2. The occasion, the rebellion of Absalom.
2. The Psalm it self, which has 1. A patheticall complaint: admiring and
questioning, concerning 1. The number of his enemies, verse. 1. 2. The danger
and grieuousnesse of them, aggrauated from their 1. Hostile insurrection, v. 1.
2 Insulting co^tumelies against him, verse. 2.

2. A narration, co^taining 1. A profession, and that 1. Of his confidence,
confirmed 1. From the office of God, who has undertaken for him to be his 1.
Defense. 2. Glory. 3. Adua^cer against their Rebellion. Contumalies.
Depressio^, verse. 3.

2. From the experience he had hereof in former times, when God heard him
praying unto him, verse. 4.
2. Of his security, amplified from 1. The adiunct or co^sequent hereof, which
is Sleep, and the quietness and soundness thereof.
2. The ground of it, which is Gods sustentation, verse 6.

2. A gloriation and triumph, not to fear 1. For the number of his enemies. 2.
Or the imminentnes of the danger, verse 6.

3. A prayer co^taining 1. Petition 1. For himself, wherein is noted, 2. For
his people, that his blessing might be on them, verse. 8. 1. The subject or
thing which he prays for, which is deliverance. 2. The reason, from his
wonted goodness in former deliverances, verse. 7.

2. A thankful acknowledgement of safety unto his people, ver. 8.



The general observations.
When David had been diverse years settled in his kingdom peaceably, it
pleased God after his fearful fall, to exercise him a little while with a sore
temptation, with a stormy tempest of rebellion by his own son, and many of his
hollow-harted subjects, for the trial of his faith and patience; upon which
occasion, as the title shows, he penned this Psalm for the instruction of
Gods Church, whence we may learn.I. That in Gods mercy, a David's afflictions,
that is, a godly man's troubles turn to the Churches profit, and make good for
the same: for hereby have we this and many other Psalms, the history of Job,
the song of Hezekiah, etc.II. That the best shall not want their trialls, nor
the greatest (sometime) their troubles. III. That nothing can make a faithful
man start back from cleaving fast to God, neither words nor deeds, Psalm. 112.
7. 8.
as here we see, verse. 1. 2. 3. and the same is confirmed in Job, who by
afflictions, and the words of his wife and friends, yet trusted in God: for
true faith surmounts all difficulties and distresses whatsoever. IV. That Gods
protection gives sufficient security, for if God be with us, Romans 8. 31.
none can be against us. V. And lastly, they that trust in God, come who will,
or how many soever against them, shall in the end have cause to praise him, for
his mercy in their safety from all enemies: for the eyes of the Lord behold all
the earth, 2. Chron. 16. 9.
to show himself strong with them that are of a perfect heart toward him.

Of the Title.
THis is the first Psalm that has a title, the titles are diverse in sundry
Psalms, and some of them make very much to the understanding of the Psalm,
containing briefly the argument of it, as this title does, and do show who is
the penman, and upon what occasion penned, and when it was indicted: the variety
may be observed in other places, as we shall come hereafter unto them, thus
much of this in general for the present.

A Psalm. Explanation.
] The Apostle mentions three kinds of songs, Ephesians. 5. 19. so are there in
this book Tehillah, in Greek (...), a hymn or praise; Shir (...), a song or
lay; and here this mizmor (...), it comes of zamar, to prune or cut off
superfluous twigs, and notes, that this kind is an artificially framed song,
in a certain full number of words and measure, superfluous words being cut
away. Note hence,

That it is lawful to use sweet songs artificially modulated, Doct.
(the ditty being holy and heavenly) as well as other, the Apostle gives
liberty in all, Ephesians. 5. 19. so it be in the heart, and unto the Lord, with
understanding and to edification.

To use herein our Christian liberty, Use.
so it be holy as becomes true godliness, and men endued with grace.

Of David. Explanation.
] Or to David, for to or of may be both one, the Hebrew speech uses these
indifferently, as the learned in that tongue affirm, as appears plainly in
the title of the Psalm, 120. and 121. where Hammagnaloth, and Pammagnaloth,
are made one; so in Greek we do read (...), Mar. 2. 18. and (...). So this
shows it was a Psalm of David which he did pen, and a Psalm to David for
his own instruction, as well as for others: teaching,

That it is nothing derogatory to the Majesty of Regal authority, Doct. 1.
for Kings with all Art and skill, to compose and to be cunning in Poems;
David a renowned King, wise and valiant, was herein excellent, so Moses, Psalm.
90. and Solomon, as Canticles show, and also Hezechiah, Esaias. 38. 9.

To esteem of this excellent gift, Use.
and none to vilify or basely account thereof: it was an excellent gift in the
Primitive Church, 1. Corinthians. 14. 26. The abuse only makes it contemptible;
there is profitable and singular use to be made thereof.

That David employed this excellent gift to the public good of the Church:
Doct. 2.
yet so a Psalm of David for others, as it was also to David, for his own
benefit.

To use our gifts to the Churches edification; Use.
therein excel, 1. Cor. 14. 12. but yet so be a teacher unto others, as we may
also profit our selves, speak to others and to our selves, Ephesians. 5. 19. that
while we preach unto others, we our selves be not reproved, 1. Cor. 9. 27.

When he fled. Explanation
] Bebarhu in flying or avoiding him: now did he pen this Psalm, showing,

That crosses and afflictions (though grievous) hinder not the piety and
devotion of Gods children, Doct.
but rather yield matter and further occasion thereof, Psalm. 7. 2. Sam. 16.
17. Psalm. 52. 1. Sam. 22. 9. there be many Psalms penned upon such occasion,
for God by troubles teaches his people many things, which else they would
never practice.

To bless God that gives such wisdom and grace unto his Children, Use. 1.
to make so happy gain to themselves, and to others, of their troubles.

To pray for this wisdom and grace, Use 2.
that we may be able to make this holy use of afflictions.

A condemnation to such as by crosses and afflictions are driven from all
devotion, Use. 3.
and through impatience and want of faith do forsake goodness.

David was a most stout champion, Explanation
and very valiant, and yet here he is noted to fly. A valiant man, sometime
(without any disgrace to him) may fly to avoid imminent and most certain
peril of death to him and his, as David does here, 2 Samuel 15. 13. 14.

Not to hold it a disgrace in such a case to fly: Use.
neither impute it to any for cowardlinesse: but rather to judge the desperate
hazard foole-hardlinesse, and such mad adventurers (if they dye) little less
then selfe-murtherers.

From the face of his son. Explanation.
] From the face, is from his person, so taken, Leuit. 19. 15. or from his wrath
and ferity. Genesis 32. 20. because the sign of wrath appears in the face: here
is a sons wrath kindled so against the Father (yet most unjustly) as he dares
not abide his presence.

Good and godly parents may have most leaud children, Doct. 1.
Adam a Caine, Abraham an Ishmael, Isaac an Esau, etc.

To make men know that grace is not by nature, Use.
example, or education: but by the holy ghost, and therefore to pray God for
them.

That the godly may have enemies arising out of their own bowels, Doct. 2.
as here we see the son against the Father, of such Christ foretells, Mat.
10. 35. 36.

When such afflictions befall any of Gods children, Use.
not to hold it strange.

This rising of David's son against him, Explanation.
came as God foretold, to punish his adultery and murder, 2 Samuel 12. 11. and
16. 22. thus the Lord raises up this instrument, and heavily does chastise
David's great offense, by which he had caused Gods name to be blasphemed, 2.
Sam. 12. 14.

God will and may raise up what instruments he pleases to punish offenders,
Doct. 1.
thus he raised Hadad, Reizen, and Jeroboam against Solomon, 1. King. 11. 14.
23. 26. and here the son against the Father, 2. Sam. 12. 11.

Learn therefore to fear the Lord, Use.
that we sin not against him: for he has his instruments such as he will,
and where he pleases to raise them up against us, if we provoke him to wrath.

Great sins receive heavy chastisements, Doct. 2.
(a David here feels it) if we do consider his sins, and hear his sons
act of rebellion, Use.
withal the circumstances of both.

As thou do sin, so look for punishment, behold Iezabels sins and
punishment, 1. King. 21. 23. 2. Kings. 9. 33. so Iehoram, 2. Chron. 21. 4. 14.
17. 18. 19. terrible vengeance for their execrable wickednesses.

It may seem very strange, Explanation.
that David a valiant man, who would so often be nigh to Saul, and come to
speak to him, when he came with an host against him. 1. Sam. 24. 9. and 26.
and yet dare not abide his sons coming: but the reason was, that David saw
him so unnatural, as he knew he would be most cruel, hereby teaching,

That none may be held more savage and mercilesly cruel, Doct.
then such as have lost the light and instinct of nature: see this in Caine to
Abell, Genesis 4. Iehoram against his brethren, 2. Chron. 21. 4. Abimelech. Judge.
9. 5.

To suspect the worst of these inhumane monsters, Use 1.
except the Lord bridle their fury. Genesis 32. 11.

To take heed that we become not unnatural, Use 2.
for then we will turn Tygres, and devouring beasts, without sparing the
nearest and dearest of our blood.

Absalom. Explanatio^.
] This is the Rebel and Conspirator, even Absalom David's darling, the son of
a King, and of a Kings daughter, 2. Sam. 3. 3. most comely, cap. 14. 25. and
well brought up, 1. Chron. 27. 32. Prou. 4. 3. 4. and 31. 1. beloved of his
Father, 2. Sam. 18. 5. 33. pardoned of his great offense. 2. Sam. 13. and 14.
allowed large maintenance, 2. Sam. 15. 1. yet now seeks his fathers death.

From whom in reason should come all comfort and kindness: Doct. 1.
from them often arises the greatest mischief. Example here: so in Hazael
against Benhadad, 2. King. 7. 8. 15. Senacharths sons against him, 2. Kings
19. 37. and Ioash against Ie^o^adahs son, who had done him great honor, 2.
Chron. 22. 11. 12. and 23. 11. 16. but he rewarded him evil in his Son. cap.
24. 21.

Not to expect always an answerable recompense to thy goodness: Use.
but rather (such is man's ingratitude) to receive sometimes evil for good: as
David complains in the Psalm. 35. 12 -- 16. and 38. 20. and 59. 3. And our
Savior who did good and no evil, found the people most ungrateful, and
wickedly bent against him.

It is not nobleness of birth, Doct. 2.
not nature, not good education, not benefits received, not comeliness of
person, that can restrain from hellish outrage, if grace be wanting: this is
apparent in this Absalom.

To esteem highly of grace and the fear of God, Use.
and earnestly to beg it at Gods hands, as being more forcible to bridle
corruption, and to make us to eschew evil, than al these.

In that a remembrance is kept of David's persecution, and that by the
unnatural rebellion of his own son, to glorify God, and to benefit the
Church: we do learn,

That the godly are not partial, Explanatio^.
in publishing things as they be without respect of persons: they record the
truth to the glory of God, and the Churches good. Such a Chronicler was Moses,
and all other penmen of Gods spirit.

A reproof to the deceitful and flattering records of men in our times, Doct.
in which truth is much falsified, by addition of virtues, where they never
were; by covering vices where they were most notorious, and by a licentious
enlarging or abbreuiating, so as stories become a fabric of flattery, and
almost a fable after the pen-mans pleasure.

Thus much touching the title of this Psalm, Use.
showing the occasion of David's penning thereof: the Psalm it self follows.

VERSE.I.
Lord how are mine adversaries increased? Text.
how many rise against me?
O Lord though I am now flying from my son, Paraphrase.
yet do I fly unto thee, and am bold to pour forth my complaint in thy
presence: truth it is that I did despise thy commandments Sam. 12. 11.
in killing Vriah with the sword, and for this thou did justly threaten to
raise up evil against me out of mine own house; but lo how now mine enemies
are multiplied, which bring me into great straights on every side! how many
rise up in arms and open rebellion? and that not only out of mine own house,
but out of my whole kingdom is evil raised against me; not only Absalom my
son, whom I so called, hoping he should have been the Fathers peace, is now
become the Fathers care and grief; but he has 2. Sam. 15. 6.
stolen the hearts of my subjects from me, verse 31.
Achitophell also is joined with him, and the Elders of 2. Sam. 17. 4.
Israel, and the conspiracy is great, chap. 15. 12.
yea the people flock unto him more and more.

Lord. Explanation.
] David in his afflictions when many came against him, has recourse only unto
God, to help him against them all.

The godly in their troubles have recourse unto the Lord, Doct.
as to their refuge and succor against the power of men, Psalm 7. 1. 2. Chr.
20. 4. 6. 12. and 14. 11. and 13. 14. Ex. 14. 15. Prou. 18. 10. 11.

Herein to follow the godly to seek unto the Lord, Use. 1.
for so are we commanded. Psalm. 50. and he will hear us. Psalm. 9. 12. and 10.
17. and 34. 15. 17.

A reproof to such as trust not in God. Use 2.
Psalm. 52. 7. but take advise of the wicked, as in Psalm. 11. 1. and do after
their way. To rely on men, as is noted, Ier. 43. 5. 6. contrary to Gods
commandment. Ierem. 42. 10 -- 14. as Achaz did, 2. Kings. 16. 7. 2.
Chronicles. 28. 16 -- 22. and as Asah did, 2. Chron. 16. 7 -- 9.

In that David being punished of God for his sin, Explanation.
as he well knew that this came upon him (as God had said) for the sin
against Vriah, yet now being repentant, David nevertheless, through faith,
which was not lost, (2. Sam. 15. 25. 26. 32.) goes unto the Lord for help, we
do learn,

That former sins committed, Doct.
and present afflictions sent of God for them, cannot withhold the repentant
faithful from seeking unto God. Such is the power of faith in a repentant
spirit, as David's was, 2. Sam. 12. 13. and Manasses, 2. Chr. 33. 12. 13.

Not to be daunted under afflictions for thy trespasses, Use.
to go unto God for deliverance, if thou be repentant, for God is exceeding
merciful, Psalm. 103. 8. 9. 13. 14. and 111. 4. Mich. 7. 18. He is nigh to all
that are truly repentant, Psalm. 34. 18. and 51. 17. Let this be our comfort
against the knowledge of our sin, and just deserts, in time of our trouble.

How] David is stricken into an admiration of this conspiracy, Explanation.
and also does make a complaint; which show, that he held himself unworthily
handled of them: else he could not have admired and complained justly.

God is just in punishing: Doct.
and we worthily deserve it: yet may we be innocent toward such as be Gods
rod, and so admire at them and complain of them, as David does here, and Psalm.
35. 7.

To consider of the instruments by whom we be afflicted: Use.
for God uses not always to punish us by them whom we have wronged, but
sometimes by them whom we have done good unto, or not offended; that in respect
of them, we might crave help of God against them, which is not a small
comfort: to have God one way for us, and not both God and man justly against us.

In that David here shows his grief, Explanation.
to be thus unnaturally, and unthankfully dealt with of those, whom he had
done and wished so great good unto, we may learn,

That a good man is troubled and grieved to have those to rise up in hatred
against him, Doct.
whom he wishes well unto. How heavily David took this, see 2. Sam. 15. 30.
Jeremy was herewith vexed, chap. 15. 10.

Not to pass over without any care such things: Use.
for as a learned man says, Mali animi indicium est, susque deque facere,
amerisne vel odio habearis ab illis, quibuscum viuendum est.

Are increased. Explanatio^.
] The history does show the conspiracy began but with a few, 2. Sam. 15. 11.
but after increased, verse 12. and 18. 7.

Nothing so wickedly and heinously begun, Doct.
especially by the mighty, but easily will get liking of a multitude: See this
in the conspiracy of Corah, Numb. 16. 1. 2. 19. and in Judas treason against
Christ, Ioh. 13. 30. with Mat. 26. 47. and 27. 1. 20. the like in Act. 19. 24.
29. see before Psalm. 2. 1. 2.

Not to judge well of a cause because of a multitude: Use 1.
for worst causes have usually most followers, because the worst are the
greatest number, whose hearts are set on evil, and they only want
opportunity; which once offered, they are as pressed soldiers, ready at the
least alarm to run to mischief.

To keep under the wicked, Use. 2.
for of small beginnings they will increase to a multitude: as did Antichrist
and his followers: Revel. 13. 11. 16. and 17. 2.

Mine adversaries. Explanatio^.
] The word Tsarim are enemies, which enclose and keep straight (without elbow
room, as we say) such as they come against, 2. King. 6. 1. 25. the word is
there used: and of this number was Absalom his son, Achitophel his friend and
Counselor, with other men of place, etc. 2. Samuel 15. 12. 13. and 16. 15. and
17. 4. whom he calls here adversaries to him. Whence note,

That such as be friends at one time, Doct. 1.
may prove malicious enemies at another: as these here prove to David, whom he
suspected not, 2. Sam. 15. 9. Psalm. 41. 9. and 55. 13. 14.

Seeing men are so wicked, Use.
it is meet to walk ever warily, and circumspectly, one toward another. All
are not faithful that are present friends, especially in prosperity when they
cannot be discerned well. Pro. 14. 20.

That as men show themselves, Doct. 2.
so are they to be taken and judged: for David here calls them enemies, and
so accounts them even in his complaint to God, who otherwise were before all
as friends, and some yet of his blood and kindred.

To use our liberty of judgment, if we find men adversaries indeed (though
never so nigh in blood, Use.
affinity, neighborhood, or otherwise) then so to hold them, till they show
the contrary: right judgment is one thing: and mercifully to forgive is
another; and both may stand together.

It may not be omitted that David here calls them adversaries only,
Explanation.
and not malicious, ungrateful, unnatural, and cruel, as elsewhere, Psalm
35. 11. and 43. 1. and 59. 2. 5. and 71. 4. for here was his son, but others
with him misled, 2. Sam. 15. 11. and all of them as Gods rod for the present to
afflict him: which no doubt he well weighed.

Natural affection to some that are our adversaries, Doct.
error in other some misled (as here, 2. Sam. 15. 11.) that all are also Gods
present rod of chastisement for sin: and lastly, not without hope to be
reconciled again, (as David hoped, 2. Sam. 15. 25. 26.) are great means to
restrain our thoughts, and to moderate our words toward them.

To temper our selves toward such as do show themselves adversaries against
us, Use.
even in an high degree, let us yet consider what they are to us, how they are
led, what hope of reconcilement, and that God by them does humble us, so shall
we not be enraged against them.

Many are they that rise up. Explanatio^.
] As before he calls them adversaries, so now he declares what manner of
adversaries, and the number to be many.

Godly men may be exercised and humbled, Doct.
not with one or a few, but with many adversaries, as David here: so Jeremy,
and Christ Jesus, S. Paul, etc.

Not to think therefore this trial strange, Use.
if so we thus be exercised, and find not one, or a few, but very many
adversaries.

Adversaries in an insurrection and rebellion: Explanatio^.
they at the first came together but at the sacrifice, 2. Sam. 15. 11. 12. but
after it proved a treasonable flocking, breaking out into open rebellion.

Popular flockings unto an aspiring spirit (as was Absolo^) breeds rebellion,
Doct.
which upon fit occasion, time, and place, will openly break forth, as we do
here see, and Chronicles show.

A caveat for Princes to see unto this: Use.
Absoloms are seditious, and the seditious seek only evil, Pro. 17. 11. The
saying of Solomon, verse. 14. is most true in strife of this kind for a
kingdom: but he that exalts his gate seeks destruction, verse. 19.

Against me. Explanatio^.
] Even against David a good and virtuous King, Psalm. 78. 72. yet against him
do these rise, who had no cause to be his enemies: but yet by these God
chastised him for his sin: teaching,

That most excellent good and holy men, Doct. 1.
Kings, and Prophets, may have adversaries, and traitorous rebels against them,
without any cause on their part: Daniel 6. 4. Psalm 59. 3. for some hate
goodness it self, Psalm 38. 20. and those that are good, Ioh. 15. 19.

Let not any, Use. 1.
whether Princes or Pastors think to be without adversaries in this world,
though they should live never so innocently.

Not to think therefore men are always worthy blame, Use 2.
because they have adversaries, though great, learned, noble, and many of them:
for so had innocent Daniel, yea Jesus Christ; nor to judge Princes wicked,
because some prove rebels and traitors against them, as were here against good
David.

That albeit Princes do not deserve such traitorous practices, Doct. 2.
and rebellions, from their subjects; yet may the same be Gods correction for
sin against them: as this was upon David, 2. Chr. 24. 25. and 25. 27.

The mighty to consider themselves in such rebellions, Use.
and be reconciled unto God, who subdueth the people under their hands, Psalm
7. For albeit they may be innocent toward their subjects, yet the Lord is
ever just in his proceedings.

Note that rebellion is called a rising up, Explanation.
(when other sins are compared to falling) in regard of high hearts, and
proud aspiring spirits, as also of the high dignity of Kings, which they
oppose themselves against rebelliously.

They that are rebels sin highly, Doct.
in pride of spirit, and against kingly majesty, the most high calling upon
earth: but as they arise high, they fall down low, as the example in hand
shows, and experience in all ages confirms.

Take heed of rebellion: Use.
Fear God and honor the King. David had a deadly adversary of Saul, he was
a troubler of the people, and a murderer of the Lords Priests: yet being the
Lords anointed, he would not meddle with him. We are forbidden to have evil
thoughts in our hearts against kings: Ecclesiast. 10. 20.

VERSE.II.
Many say to my soul, Text.
there is no help for him in God.
NOt content herewith to drive me out of my kingdom, Paraphrase.
many of them do further also persecute me with words of hatred, and Psalm. 69.
20.
vex my soul with contumelies and reproaches. For this indeed goes to the
very heart of me, that when I might have looked for some to have pity on me,
they contrarily extol themselves against me, with rebukes and taunts, as if I
were utterly forlorn, and past all hope, saying, There, there, so would we
have it; Psalm. 71. 11.
God has forsaken him, pursue him, and take him, for there is none to deliver
him Psalm. 41. 8.
; a mischief is light upon him, and now he is down he shall rise up no more,
God himself whom he did pretend to serve, and trust in for aid and succor,
has now 2. Sam. 16. 8.
taken him in his wickedness, and has no help in store for him.

Here David brings in his enemies words, Explanation.
by which no doubt they encouraged themselves in this foul fact, and sought to
confound the spirit of him hereby, of which he here does chiefly complain,
and mention unto the Lord.

Such as rely upon the Lord, Doct.
do tell him in particular of their enemies words and deeds, Psalm 10. and
22. 7. 8. Act. 4. 27. 29. 2. Chron. 20. 10. 11.

To learn to unfold our griefs into the bosom of God, Use.
as the godly have done: for great is the benefit in respect of the comfort,
and assurance which comes thereby, as the event shows in the examples of
holy men, and experience tells other in these times.

Many] That is, Explanation.
all that treasonable flock, and rebellious rout so said, and yet it was an
error.

Error and falsehood (and especially that which is for the overthrow of the
godly) gets soon many favorites, Doct.
as appears by that cursed false report spread by the soldiers, Matthew. 28.
15. so against the Apostle, Act. 16. 19. -- 22. and 21. 27. 28. 29. 30.

Therefore beware of credulity, Use.
and before we do entertain speeches, let us weigh them well, and only by
trial approve, lest we be deceived, seeing falsehood gets so soon favor
with men, many may say that which yet is not true.

Say] The word is saying, Explanatio^.
as showing in their rising up, they thus spoke of David, and heartened one
another: they do not only distress him with deeds, but vex him also with
words.

The wicked every way by words and deeds seek to vex the godly, Doct.
cruel in act, contumelious and despitefull in speeches, Psalm. 35. 15. 16. 22.
7. 8. 13. Mat. 27. 29. 30. -- 42.

To prepare our selves as well for reproaches, Use.
as other crosses; for the godly have had their part in both, Job. 30. 1. 9.
10. Lam. 3. 14. 63. Heb. 11. 36.

To my soule] Lenaphshi, Explanation.
this word some translate of my soul, and so the soul put for the whole man,
as is usual: but the word will bear the other sense, and is more forcible:
for David does not only show what they spoke, but how he took it, even as a
sword piercing to his soul.

Words (such may they be many times) will cause more trouble to the afflicted,
Doct.
and add sorrow to other present outward crosses: Psalm. 69. 20. and 42. 10.
Lam. 2. 15. 16.

Not to break out into insulting, Use.
contumelious taunting, or otherwise disgraceful speeches toward others,
especially the afflicted: for though they be but words, yet may they be
wounding, and increase anguish in soul, and may make sad the hearts of the
righteous; a sin which God one day will punish, Ezekiel. 13. 22. 23.

There is no help for him in God. Explanatio^.
] The Hebrew word Iesugnah is Iesugnathah, a letter added for to increase the
signification, as if it were said, there is no manner of help at all: the like
is in Psalm. 44. 27. and 92. 16. and 94. 17. and 63. 8. and 12. 1. 2. Job. 5.
16. This is their judgment of him, yet they encouraged themselves against him,
with this, that he could not now hope for deliverance from God.

This is the perverse judgment of the wicked, Doct. 1.
to think that if God afflict his children, and let them alone a while, he
indeed has utterly forsaken them: Psalm. 41. 8. 2. Sam. 16. 7. 8.

The wicked to learn hereby to rectify this judgment, Use 1.
seeing the case is far otherwise, Psalm. 103. 9. he chastises in love, and
not in hatred, Heb. 12. 6. Revel. 3. 19. Pro. 3. 12.

The godly not to regard what the wicked think of them, Use 2.
their judgment is perverse.

It is a strong motive in the wicked, Doct. 2.
being conceited (though falsely) that God is for them, and against the godly,
to rise up and vex them. Psalm. 71. 11.

Godly to pray for their enemies, Use 1.
to reform their opinion herein, which so heartens them in evil.

The wicked to consider, Use 2.
how they are by the lying spirit deceived, when they rise against the godly;
behold the end God made for David, against Absalom, Achitophel, and the rest,
who being in present prosperity, and perhaps remembering Nathans words against
David, 2. Sam. 12. 10. 11. conclude thus wickedly, as it may seem, 2. Sam. 16.
8. but the end shows they were deceived.

In that David complains of this speech, Explanation.
and not of his sons unnaturalness, the ingratitude of others, or of any other
outward evil done by them in particular in their rebellion, but only this it
does teach,

That to be judged as utterly forsaken of God, Doct.
is a greater temptation then all outward troubles, Psalm. 42. 10. for they
cannot overcome this heavy temptation but by the especial grace of God,
giving strength of faith in this combat.

Godly to pray with David, Use. 1.
Psalm. 35. 3. and to have hope, as he had. 2. Sam. 16. 10. 12.

Not to torment the poor afflicted with such a dart of Satan. Use. 2.


This may terrify the wicked: Use. 3.
for if the godly be troubled herewith, who know the contrary by the word: how
should not horror possess their hearts, when they may hear this against
themselves every where in the word, and shall at the last day be manifest to
the world? Matthew. 7. and 25.

God] The word is Elohim, Explanation.
his first name in Scripture, Genesis 1. 1. it is the plural number, commonly
joined with a word of the singular, 1. Chron. 17. 21. though sometime with a
plural. 2. Sam. 7. 23. Psalm. 58. 12. to teach,

That there is a plurality of persons, Doct.
in the singularity of the essence, expressed in his other name Jehovah, ver.
3. 4. both set down in ver. 7.

To acknowledge this divine mystery, Use.
that God is Jehovah Elohim. one, and yet three.

Selah. Explanatio^.
This word is read only in Psalms, and in Hab. 3. 3. 9. a note of
asseueration, or admiration, referred to the mind, it is to give attention to
music, it notes an elevation of voice. Shindelerus says, it is as vox
enclitica sine sensu, diversely translated: if here to mark then observe,

That it is worthy of pausing upon, Doct.
to consider the folly of the wicked in prosperity: how highly they think of
themselves, and contemptuously of the godly, as also yet how by faith the godly
overcome this temptation, verse. 8. there is Selah.

We may therefore by this observe a stay, Use.
or pausing time, and that we are not speedily to run over what is there
noted, as worthy our marking, as here in this place of these two things
observed.

VERSE.III.
But thou Lord art a buckler for me: Text.
my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
But let them think and speak contemptuously of me as they will, Paraphrase.
and sooth and please themselves with such fond imaginations; yet this is but
to sing the triumph before they have gotten the victory. For I believe Lord,
and am assured of thy desence. Psalm. 26.
I know that thou will help thine anointed, and hear him from thy sanctuary,
by the mighty help of thy right hand, for thou have taken it upon thee as a
part of thine office, amongst other thy servants to defend me also: to Psalm.
18. 2 and 27. 5. and 31. 3. and 62. 7.
cover me with thy defense, and set thy might as a fortification about me. And
though now they defame me and cast me out of my kingdom, yet Psalm. 21. 5.
my glory has been great in thy salvation, worship and honor have thou laid
upon me; thou have advanced me to the throne, and thou will restore me to it,
and my kingly dignity; my head which now hangs down with shame and sorrow, thou will lift up Psalm. 27. 6.
with joy and triumph, and cause the Crown to flourish thereon again.

But thou Lord art, Explanation.
etc.] David here recalleth his thoughts from his enemies comfortless
speeches, professing his faith in God, not believing their wicked speeches: but
rests in the Lords powerful protection, whatsoever they say against him: from
this course of this holy Prophet we may learn,

That the godly wise do so take knowledge of their temptations, Doct. 1
to be there with in soul perplexed, as yet they recall their thoughts from
thence, to comfortable meditations, which may give them strength in God, Ps.
119. 23. 92. Ps. 27. 13. 2. Cor. 4. 16. 18.

To admonish the soul drooping in temptations, Use.
not to refuse comfort as Rachell; but with David to turn our thoughts to
better comfort, and correct our selves as he did, Psalm. 42. 11. and say as he,
Psa. 71. 7. 20.

That the godly believe not what wicked men judge of their case between God
and themselves: Doct. 2.
they pass not of men's judgment, as S. Paul speaks, 1. Cor. 4. 3.

Not to be cast down with the judgment of wicked persons. Use.
For Gehezi sees the danger, but not the safeguard, 2. Kings 6. till his eyes
be open, but Elisha and David know that God is their defense, and that it is
far better with them than the wicked think.

David was now in a threefold distress, Explanation.
and for his comfort he considers, the Lord to answer him to them all,
teaching.

That he that has the Lord, Doct.
is sufficiently comforted against the wicked. For David was succourlesse, God
is his buckler; David was contemned, God is his glory: he was cast down, God
is his lifter up.

To rejoice more in the aid of God, Use.
than in all the strength of men, and let us not fear their oppositions, the
Lord is all-sufficient, Genes. 17. 1. and we are not alone, though all forsake
us, if God be with us, Io. 16. 32. 2. King. 6. 16. consider, Psalm. 27. 14.

A shield for me. Explanatio^.
] Thus he compares the Lord to express his protection. Clypeus, (...), or
(...), ab occultando, or caelando, for soldiers were hid and covered by a
sheeld from the strokes and darts of enemies, the word magen comes of ganan
to compass as an hedge or wall. It differs from Tsinnah, which comes of
tsanan, a buckler bearing out sharp in the middle.

God is a shield, Doct.
a protection, and sure defense to his children. Genesis 15. 1. Psalm. 18. 2. Deuteronomy.
33. 29. Psalm. 91. 1.

Comfort; Use 1.
not to fear the enemies of Gods people, Genesis 15. 1. he hides his, Psalm. 27.
5. He receives the strokes of the adversaries as a shield. Job. 15. 25. 26.

Wicked fear and consider your mad fury, Use. 2.
when you rise against the godly, who are hidden under Gods protection and
power, as under a shield.

My glory. Explanation.
] By godly, he understands his kingly dignity, and adorning, as Mat. 6. 29.
and he calls God his glory, for that he advanced him thereunto, and would
maintain it against his enemies. As he calls him his shield, that is, he
that will defend him, so now his glory, for that he will maintain his dignity.

Kingly dignity is glory, Doct. 1.
Mat. 6. 29. but yet weighty, as chabod also signifies.

Princes to look upon the glory of their places, Use.
as yet they withal consider the heavy weight and burden of their places.
Exodus 18. 18 -- 23.

The godly make the Lord to be that unto them which they are: Doct. 2.
if rich, glorious, strong, etc. they hold him to be their wealth, glory,
strength, as David here does.

Whatsoever we be, Use.
hold God to be that unto us, thereby shall we acknowledge him the author
thereof and preserver, and that we esteem him above them, while we have them,
and having lost them, yet do enjoy them having him.

That God is the maintainer not only of the bodily safety, Doct. 3.
but also of the dignity of his children, to which he exalted them. Psalm. 2.
4. 5. and 21. 5. 8. Ios. 1. 5. 2. Sam. 7. 9. Psalm. 62. 4, 6. Numb. 16. and 17.
5. and 12. 10.

Comfort to the godly exalted by God, Use. 1.
that he will maintain their standing, Psalm. 21. 1. if they trust in him.

Wicked not to rise against such as the Lord exalts, Use. 2.
they shall not prevail. Psalm. 21. 11. but be destroyed. Psalm. 62. 3. 4. and
21. 8. 9. for they be Gods euemies herein, as the Psalmist in the Psalm. 21. 8.
9. calls them.

And lifter up of my head. Explanatio^.
] That is, will make me to rejoice, for in sorrow the head hangs down. 1.
Kings. 21. 27. as David's did here: so when men's hearts are glad, they lift up
their heads. Psalm. 110. 7. Luke 21. 28. from this manner of speaking, and his
hope in God, we may note,

That a very godly man's heart will be heavy, Doct. 1.
and his countenance cast down in afflictions for his sins, though he know
that God does forgive him. 2. Sam. 15. 30. with 12. 13.

Justly to condemn such as be like 2. Use.
Chron. 28. 22. not humbled for judgments, and yet without assurance of
pardon: but if afflictions make sad such a one, oh! in the day of wrath how
shall other be overwhelmed with sorrows?

That it is God that lifts up his, Doct. 2.
and makes them glad in heart. Psalm. 9. 13. and 4. 7. and 30. 11.

To seek to God for gladness of heart, Use.
he causes true joy.

That such as be under Gods chastisements, Doct. 3.
yet knowing that God has pardoned them, as David did (see before, 2. Samuel
12. 13.) they can comfortably look for joy in the end, Psalm 27. 6.

In thy afflictions above all things labor for this, Use
the assurance of pardon of thy sins, then will thou in the midst of
troubles confidently expect comfort from God.

VERSE.IV.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice, Text.
and he heard me out of his holy mountain.
THis my hope (know ye. Paraphrase.
O mine enemies) is not vain or groundless, but I am persuaded hereof by
former experiments of his help at hand, when I called upon him: for this was I
went to do in all my troubles, and herein have always found comfort and
success, leaving the thought of all humane aid, I betook my self to earnest
prayer, and that not only in the secret sighs and silent wishes of my
troubled soul, but with strong cries did I importune his help, and lift up my
Psalm. 66. 17.
voice, together with my hearty desires, which ascended into his sanctuary on
mount Sion; yea into heaven it self the seat of his holiness, from whence he
has heard me, and not putting back my Ps. 66. 19. 20.
prayers, nor his mercy from me, has answered my requests, in giving me such
things as I prayed for.

David here begins to turn his thoughts to himself, Explanation
and considers what formerly he had done, and how God had dealt with him,
interrupting his complaint to God, to speak to himself thus in 45. and 6.
verses, before he brast out into prayer again, teaching,

That the experience of Gods former mercies and help, Doct.
is a good confirmation of our faith, to look again for help in present
perils. 1. Sam. 17. 32. 34 -- 37. 2. Chron. 20. 7-10. 2. Tim 4. 17. 18.

To take notice of Gods goodness toward us from time to time, Use.
that by former mercies we may be strengthened in our faith, to expect help
from God in present perils. Psalm. 77. 11.

I did call. Explanatio^.
] He shows the means he used for help in his former troubles, as also
now, verse. 7. to teach,

That invocation and prayer, Doct.
is one thing, in which the godly exercise themselves in adversity, and the
means they use for deliverance. 2. Chron. 20. 2 -- 13. Esa 37. 14 -- 20. Psalm.
18. 3. and. 5. 1. 2. 3. 10. 11. Act. 4.

In adversity and trouble, Use.
to give our selves to prayer, as we see the godly do: for God will help such
as do call upon him, Psalm. 50. 15. 2. Chron. 13. 14. 15. and 14. 11. 12. and
16. 9. and 77. 2. 3.

With my voice. Explanation.
] The word chara is to cry, and here voice is added: for there is a crying as
well without voice, as with it: Exodus 14. 15.

True prayer is a crying in the ears of the Lord, Doct.
and the feruencie thereof causes the sound of the voice, and the mouth to
speak aloud: Exodus 14. 15. Heb. 5. 7. Psalm. 66. 17. 2. Chron. 32. 20. 1. King.
8. 28.

To be fervent in our prayers unto God, Use. 1.
such prayers avail much. Iam. 5. 16.

A reproof to such as be remiss and cold in prayer, Use. 2.
never come to crying in the ears of the Lord: but pray superstitiously, or
formally, and not heartily.

Unto the Lord. Explanation.
] David shows to whom he prayed, even to the Lord.

The godly pray only to God, Doct.
and to none but him, Genesis 4. 26. and 12. 8. and so did all the faithful, and
no instance to the contrary.

To make our prayers only to God; Use.
not to Saints, Angels, or Virgin Mary, but to him whom we can call Father.
Matthew 6.

And he heard me. Explanatio^.
] Here is the success he found in prayer: God heard him. The word gna-nah is
to answer, which is to hear, as he certifieth that he hears, and grants
their requests which pray to him.

That the godly pray not in vain, Doct. 1.
it is not lost labor to call upon him, as examples show, 2. Chron. 13. 14.
15. and 14. 11. 12. and David witnesses experimentally, Psalm. 6. 9. and 22.
24. and 118. 5. So we may see also 2. Chron. 30. 20. 27.

To be hereby encouraged to this holy exercise, Use.
when we know the Lord will not lend us a deaf ear, and send us away empty,
but will hear us and grant our requests. Ps. 34. 17.

That whom God hears indeed, Doct. 2.
them he answers, that is, he by some means does show that he has heard
them: Esa. 30. 19. and 41. 17. -- 19. and 58. 9. 1. King. 18. 24. 36. 37. 38.

Pray therefore with David, Use 1.
as in the Psalm. 22. 21. Save me from the Lions mouth, and answer me in saving
me: and 1. King. 8. 30. 32. 34. 36. 38. 39. 43. 49 50.

Hereby to try the effectualnes of our prayers with God: Use. 2.
by the effects we may know: for he answers whom he hears. Esa. 30. 19.

Out of his holy mountain. Explanatio^.
] Of this mountain, and holiness thereof, see before, and Psalm. 2. 6. but he
is said to be heard from hence, because there was the Sanctuary and Arc, by
which Christ Jesus was prefigured, from whence the Lord promised to make
answer to such as should call upon him. Exodus 25. 22. and 29. 42. Hereby
teaching,

That God is faithful in his promise to perform it. Doct. 1.
This David hereby does witness. So Solomon, 1. King. 8. 20. 58. and so is he
ever to all his people, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. and 7. 9.

To trust the Lord in his word, Use.
he will neither fail us nor forsake us, Ioh. 1. Heb. 13.

That the godly have in their prayers respect unto Gods promise* Doct. 2.
this made Daniel turn his face toward Jerusalem, because he (would and
should but) could not be there, Dan. 6. 10. Esa. 37. 16. compared with Exodus
25. 22.

To consider of the promise of God in praying unto him. Use 1.
2. Chron. 20. 9.

As the godly in the old Testament directed their prayers toward the Arc of
the Covenant, Use. 2.
and so to receive help from that holy mountain: so are we to look for help
from heaven, believing in Christ Jesus the Prince of the Covenant.

That God hears them, Doct. 3.
that are unjustly driven out of the place of Gods presence; that is, from the
visible congregation of Gods people, as well as if they were there in personal
presence, so be it in heart they be there. So heard he David here: so Daniel,
chap. 6. as Solomon prayed, 1. King. 8. So does he yet now hear his people.

Comfort for such as are persecuted, Use.
and driven unjustly, from among the faithful, by Antichrist and his members,
the Lord will hear out of his holy mountain: though they be driven out of the
assembly of men visibly, yet are they not reject of God, but numbered among his
Saints, so long as they endeavor to please him.

VERSE.V.
I laid me down and slept, Text.
and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
IN which respect (namely that the Lord heard me) I was most confident and
secure: Paraphrase.
and although for others, usually troubles break sleep, and care cause it to
depart, when if they climb up to their beds, their eyes slumber not, nor their
eyelids take any rest, but Job. 7. 4.
measuring the evening by counting the watches thereof, they are full of
tossing to and fro, till the dauning of the day: yet did I lay me down in
peace, and took my rest; and my sleep was sound and sweet unto me. Job. 7.
13.
My couch relieved me, and my bed brought comfort to me: I was not affrighted
with dreams, nor astonished with visions: I was not raised up with outcries,
neither did sudden terrors stir me up, till being fully refreshed, I awaked
of my self: and that because Gods help was as the pillow whereon I rested my
head: yea this was a strong pillar, whereon relying, he has underpropped and
vpholden me.

Hear he proves to us how the Lord heard him, Explanation.
by safe keeping him in the peril.

The godly do not only pray, Doct.
but do observe also, how the Lord hears them, and keeps it in
remembrance: as he does here, and Psalm. 9. 13. 15. 2. Cor. 12. 8. 9. So the
Scriptures record the prayers of the godly, and how the Lord heard them also:
2. Chron. 20. and 14. Exodus 14. and 32. 14.

To observe the success of thy prayers, Use.
that by experience of Gods mercy, thou may be strengthened in faith to
pray, and therein to be frequent and fervent in all thy troubles.

I laid me down and slept, Explanation.
I awaked.] That is, I David in trouble became thus secure: for by these
speeches is noted a mind secure, and one safe from dangers: Leuit. 26. 6. Job.
11. 18. 19. Ezekiel. 34. 25.

Such as put their trust in God, Doct.
can quietly perform the ordinary actions of life, without anxietie of spirit,
and fearful distractions: Act. 12. 6. and 16. 25. Numb. 24. 9.

To check such as profess faith in God, Use.
and yet are in troubles overwhelmed with cares, and distracted with fears.

It is to be noted, Explanatio^.
that the Prophet does show first how he came to be so secure, to lie down in
his perils, even by prayer and faith resting in God, who did hear him before
he betook himself to sleep: teaching,

That a godly man's security, Doct.
is not of a senseless stupiditie, nor of a desperate temeritie, but of a sure
confidence in God, having earnestly implored his aid: Psalm 112. 7. Act. 27.
22. 23. 25. Psalm. 4. 8.

To labor for faith in perils, Use 1.
that we may rest securely: Pro. 2. 24. 25. 2. Chron. 20. 20.

To discern a difference between the spiritual security of the godly, Use 2.
and carnal security of the wicked, which comes not of faith and holy
prayer, but of a blockish benummednes, Pro. 23. 35. or of a desperate fool
hardiness; or of a presumptuous leuitie; or idle conceit of their own power,
or earthly strength, as 1. King. 20. 16. 18.

By David's example, Use. 3.
before we lie down to rest, let us learn to commend our selves to God in
prayer.

For the Lord sustained me. Explanation.
] By the Lord; it was not of himself, or by his guard or kingly authority,
that he thus was preserved in his rest and sleep. The word Samach is to
sustain one by putting under his hand, Psalm. 37. 17. 24.

The state of the godly is most secure through Gods protection: Doct.
Psalm. 91. Pro. 3. 24. -- 26. Ezra. 8. 22. 31. 1. Sam. 2. 9.

To give him the glory of our preservation, Use 1.
as David here, and Psalm. 4. 8. and 118. 13. 14. Exodus 15.

To shroud and shelter our selves under his protection, Use 2.
and to cast our selves upon him. Consider Psalm. 37. 5. Pro. 16. 3. Psalm. 118.
8. 9. and 33. 18. 2. Chron. 16. 9.

VERSE.VI.
I will not be afraid of ten thousand of the people, Text.
that should beset me round about.
FRom this experience of Gods help heretofore, Paraphrase.
I now dare be bold to glory in the same, and for the time to come not fear
what man can do unto me, nor be afraid of any distrustful care, neither for
the multitude of enemies, nor any straits, or disaduantages, that they can
bring me too: no, though never so many Psalm. 17. 3.
thousands and ten thousands of the people, swarming together like Locusts in
number, should besiege me round about, where flesh and blood would think it
impossible to escape: for the Lord Ibid. verse. 1.
is my light and my salvation, whom then should I fear? The Lord is the
strength of my life, of whom then should I be afraid? The Lord, I say, is with
me Psalm. 118. 7.
amongst those that help me: Psalm. 54. 4.
therefore shall I see my desire upon mine enemies.

I will not be afraid. Explanatio^.
] David having found God so sure to him, has gotten a spirit of valor and
true fortitude.

Assurance of Gods aid, Doct.
and experience thereof, causes true valor, and makes a man of an undaunted
spirit: 1. Sam. 17. 26. 32. 34. -- 36. Ezra. 8. 22. 31. and Psalm. 118. 6. Romans
8. 31. Psalm. 27. 1. Nehem. 6. 11.

To expel fear and become valiant: Use.
let us trust in the Lord, Psalm. 56. 3. 4. 2. Chron. 16. 8. So did Moses exhort
the people in their fear, Exodus 14. So in 2. Chron. 20. 20. This assurance of
Gods aid made Abijah courageous, 2. Chron. 13. 12.

For ten thousands of people. Explanatio^.
] A certain number for an uncertain, meaning an host of men.

The righteous (upon Gods assurance) are not daunted with the multitude of
enemies: Doct.
Psalm 27. 3. 2. Chron. 14. 9. 10. 11. 1. Sam. 14. 1. 6.

Not to be dishartned by a multitude of enemies: Use.
consider how God is with his. Ios. 1. 5. 6. 7. 10. and 10. 8. 9. and 11. 6. 7.
Not to be like the wicked, who fly and none pursue them. Prou 28. 1.

That have round about set themselves against me. Explanatio^.
] The word Sabah is to compass about as a circle, or a place besieged, Esa.
22. 7. David even in such a peril says he will not fear, of such strength
is his faith.

The faith of Gods children is firm, Doct.
not only in light perils, but in dangers (after man's reason) unavoidable.
Psalm 23. 4. and 118. 10. 11. Dan. 3. 17. and 6. 23. Psalm. 46. 1 -- 3.

In most desperate perils to have a firm and constant faith in God, Use.
as the examples of the godly do encourage us, for he that faints in the day
of adversity, his strength is small. Prou. 24. 10.

In this that David is so without fear, Explanatio^.
in this trouble which came for his sins, which the Prophet had threatened,
when all men almost had forsaken him: and he heard that it was published that
God had also left him. We may learn,

That incredible is the strength of Faith to cheer up the spirit of a godly
man, Doct.
beyond all humane strength and power of reason: both for temporal
deliverances, as all the former Scriptures and examples show, as also for
spiritual safety. Romans 8. 35 -- 39. so Job will trust in God though he kill
him: and was sure his redeemer lived.

Labor for this unconquerable virtue, Use 1.
which can do more to give sound comfort in the midst of al discomforts,
then all earthly power, honor, wealth, friends, etc. it ever gets the victory,
for it overcomes the world, 1. John 5. 4. see what faith can do. Read Heb.
11.

Not to condemn that for madness and folly, Use. 2.
which is by the power of faith warrantably either said or done, though it
cross all reason in man's natural apprehension.

VERSE.VII.
O Lord arise, Text.
help me my God, for thou have smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone:
thou have broken the teeth of the wicked.
NEither yet (O Lord) do I so much boast of thine aid, Paraphrase.
as with mine earnest prayers, again crave it at thy hands; and as mine enemies
rebelliously rise up against me, so do thou in thy righteousness arise for
my cause. Stand up O Lord and that soon, let not man prevail: do not now
Psalm. 44. 24.
by delaying make as if thou did not hear, or hide thy face, or forget my
misery and affliction: but by thy present and speedy help, show that thou art
most intent and watchful for my preservation. Yea according to thy covenant
and promise, by which thou do vouch safe to be my God, and to give me a Right
in thine own self; so I beseech thee to help me thy servant, and redeem me
for thy mercies sake. And I am bold to give a reason why thou should, even
from thy wonted goodness, and former deliverances, which have been ever of
old: in which respect thou should seem unlike thy self, except it please
thee to help me at this time also. But so it is that heretofore thou have
always helped me in my greatest extreamities, and have smitten Micah. 5. 1.
mine enemies with most ignominious and condign punishments: and when they
thought presently to devour and eat me up, like so many ramping and Psalm.
57. 4. and 22. 13.
roaring Lions, yet thou did then smite them all upon the Psalm. 58. 6. and
22. 21.
jaws, and break their teeth, and pluck me as a pray out of their mouths,
by bringing fearful judgments upon them, and abating their force, and
repressing their rage, that they had no power at all to harm or annoy me.

Having thus fitted himself to pray: Explanatio^.
first, complaining: secondly, by faith, repelling the temptation: and so
thirdly comforting himself from former experience: fourthly, being without
servile fear, he falls to prayer, teaching,

That men are then fittest to pray, Doct.
when their passions are allayed, their fear removed, their faith strengthened
to call upon the name of the Lord.

In coming to pray and to invoke Gods name, Use.
strive to have a quiet, a comfortable cheery spirit, and a faithful heart,
least wavering we obtain not our petition. James 1. 7.

O Lord. Explanatio^.
] In the fifth verse is noted his security, in the sixth, his holy boasting
against his enemies, as not fearing any of them, yet here he immediately
cries O Lord, and craves his help, to show,

That a godly man is so secure, Doct. 1.
so without fear, and so persuaded of Gods protection, as he yet neglects
not still to pray, and to implore his aid: as David's practice shows,
comparing these places, Ps. 37. 1. 3. with ver. 7. Ps. 56. 4 11. 9. and 118. 6.
17. 25.

So to believe, Use.
and to be secure of Gods help and succor, as yet we may not neglect to pray,
and call upon his holy name, neither to neglect lawful means appointed for
our safety, for else it is rather a tempting of God, then a holy trust in his
help.

That the best of Gods children in present dangers may have mingled thoughts,
Doct. 2.
even in a moment, by which the heart is now resolute, by and by somewhat
disquieted, experience yet shows this, which was in David, Psalm. 27. 1. 2.
with ver. 9. 12. and 42. 5. 6. and 86. 12. 16. 17.

In great measure of assurance and comfort, Use. 1.
not to be lifted up, but rather pray for the continuance thereof.

In this ebbing and flowing not to be dejected, Use. 2.
but in the disquietnesse of mind have recourse unto God, and pray for a new
supply of grace, and a reflowing of comfort into our souls again.

Arise. Explanation.
] This is usual in the Psalms, Psalm. 44. 23. and 7. 6. 10. 12. and 17. 13.
etc. which is attributed unto God, because while he suffers the wicked, he
seems to sit as careless, or as one asleep: but when he punishes them, he
seems to arise, Doct. 1.
hereby teaching,

That the patience of God (through which the wicked sometime reign and rule)
is not for ever, but short, and as a sleeping while, after which he will take
vengeance of the wicked: Psalm. 73. 20. and 12. 5. and 78. 65. 66.

To the wicked to consider that their time of reigning here is but short: Use 1.
let them look that God will awake at the length, Psalm. 9. 12. 18. and 10. 2.
-- 14. and 11. 6.

To work in the godly a quiet expecting of help in due season, Use. 2.
Psalm. 9. 18. he is patient, but sleeps not. Psalm. 121.

Save me] These words do express David's meaning in the former word,
Explanatio^.
and shows what is Gods arising, even his helping of him. This prayer
teaches,

That (as David here) so the children of God in their greatest security and
rest in God, Doct.
are not without a sense of their trouble, and do not presume of their own
strength, but do look for salvation from God. Psalm. 7. 10.

To consider of our miseries, Use.
to go out of our selves, and desire the Lord to save us.

My God. Explanatio^.
] Of the name Elohim, translated God, see verse. 2. before: but here my is
added, to show,

That albeit God is God to all, Doct.
yet to all the faithful in a special manner, Exodus 4. 22. Esa. 5. 7. yea and
every particular Saint of God, may call him his God. Psalm. 22. 1. and 7. 1. 3.

Comfort to all the godly, Use.
that they may pray unto God, as having a special interest in him to be called
their God, above all the people on the earth.

For thou have, Explanatio^.
etc.] A reason still drawn from Gods formerly experienced goodness, as if he
had said, Thou have saved me, and I now persuade my self, thou will also do
for me after thy wonted goodness.

Faith in prayer is much confirmed from experience of the mercies granted, Doct.
like to those which at the present we beg at Gods hands. David prays for
deliverance, upon experience of the like before. Psalm. 4. 1.

In our petitions made unto God for the strengthening of our faith therein, Use.
let us consider of the like favors bestowed, either upon our selves, or upon
Gods people, as did Iehosaphat, 2. Chro. 20. 6. 7. so Dantel, chap. 9. verse.
15. for the Lord is ever in mercy one and the same to his people.

Smitten all mine enemies. Explanatio^.
] Nachah, is also to kill by smiting. Psalm. 135. 10. 2. Sam. 11. 15. All, so as
God was for him against every enemy, and sparing none. Enemies, which came in
open hatred or conspiring maliciously his overthrow.

God can smite the enemies of the godly with a deadly stroke: Doct. 1.
Iere. 37. 10. Esa. 13. Exodus 12. 23. 29. and 15. 6.

To fear Gods stroke: Use.
for if he please to strike home, the blow is deadly. The word also does note a
certainty, to mark so where to strike, as to strike sure, as God can do.

God will revenge the cause of the godly upon all their enemies, Doct. 2.
and will take part with the godly against all that shall rise up against them,
Genes. 12. 3. Numb. 24. 9. The instances are in the enemies of Israel, of
Ioshuah, of David, Iehosaphat, etc.

Not to be enemies unto the godly, Use 1.
for they shall not only be frustrate of their purposes: but also bring evil
upon themselves: as David's enemies did here, and Psalm. 9. 3. 4. 5.

Comfort to the godly, Use. 2.
that they have such a one to stand for the^, one that can and will smite their
enemies. Ps. 9. 9. 10.

Upon the cheek bone. Explanation.
] To smite thus, is used in contempt and reproach, Job. 16. 10. 1. King. 22. 24.
but here also to set out Gods power, who can confound the enemy, as a strong
man can a child with his fist.

The Lord has all the wicked in contempt, Doct.
Psa. 2. 4. and 59. 8. and 37. 13. and can easily confound them: Example in the
overthrow of Babel, Genesis 11. the Egyptians, Exo. 14. the Aethiopians, 2.
Chron. 14.

Not therefore to fear the wicked: Use.
but wait on the Lord, Esa. 8. 13. 14. with verses 9. 10.

Thou have broken the teeth of the wicked. Explanation.
] Here is expressed the force of that blow upon the cheek bone; it breaks
their teeth, that is their means to hurt, Psalm. 57. 4. compared to teeth, Ps.
124. 6. as the wicked are to lions, Ps. 57. 4. and dogs, Ps. 22. 10. whose
jaws and teeth being broken, cannot hurt.

The revenging hand of God can so smite the wicked, Doct.
as he thereby depriueth them of the means, by which they become as savage
beasts hurtful unto the godly. He destroyed Senacheribs host, brake his
teeth, and put a ring into the bears nostrill to lead him home again. Esa.
37.

Let us therefore make our prayers unto God: Use.
who (as he can) so he would in mercy smite them, and break their teeth in
sunder, disarme them of their means to hurt his people, as David does, Psalm.
58. 6. 7. 8. so though they remain dogs barking, yet he will make them sure
for biting.

VERSE VIII.
Salvation belongs unto the Lord, Text.
and thy blessing be upon the people.
NOw for these and all other thy great deliverances, Paraphrase.
which thou have wrought for me, thine be all praise, and glory, Revel. 7. 10.
and 12. 10. and 19. 1.
salvation, and might, and power, be ascribed unto thee, to whom alone it
belongs: only for the people, let me request thy favor; even for these also,
who being misled, have fallen away to Absalom: for many of them went in the
simplicity 2. Sam. 15. 11.
of their hearts: not knowing any thing at the first of such a rebellious
purpose: therefore Lord whatsoever their sin has been, yet in stead of
cursing, do thou bless: bless Psalm. 29. 11.
them, I say, with peace and concord, with loyalty and obedience, with plenty
Psalm. 28. 9.
and prosperity, and all other thy benefits and graces heaped upon them.

Salvation to or of the Lord. Explanatio^.
] This verse is a general sentence concluding the Psalm, which David gathered
by good experience: the meaning is, that howsoever we be delivered, safety is
from God, who has ever means to save his.

The power of saving is with God: Doct.
for here it is not said that he saves: but which is more, salvation is of
him: Pro. 21. 31. Jonah 2. 9. Revel. 7. 10. and 19. 1. Esa. 12. 2.

To acknowledge all safety from the Lord, Use 1.
whosoever the instruments, or whatsoever the means be, as David does, praising
the Lord: Psalm. 18. 46. 47. 48. 49. and 144. 8. and 148. 7. Exodus 15. 2. Judge.
15. 18. 1. Sam. 11. 1. -- 13.

To trust in him, Use. 2.
and to rely upon him, Psalm. 57. 1. 2. Sam. 22. 3. because salvation is with
him, that is, he is never without means to save such as trust in him.

This reproves them that ascribe it to man's power, Use 3.
policy or chance, Saints, Idols, etc. but read Psalm 33. 16. 17. and 20. 7.
Esa. 10. 4.

Thy blessing upon the people. Explanatio^.
] By blessing is meant plentiful bestowing of good things, Genesis 24. 35. Deuteronomy.
28. 2 -- Ephesians. 1. 3. Gal. 3. 8. And thus David prays for the people even
rebelling against him: such is his love toward them.

That a gracious good King, Doct.
loves, prays for, and wishes all good to his people: 1. King. 8. 22. -- 2.
Chr. 29. 18. 19. even when they have showed themselves rebels also against him,
as Moses did, Numb. 14. 2. 13 -- 19. and David here.

Princes to be like minded toward their subjects in these days, Use.
to love them, to pray for them, and to wish them al happiness, Psalm. 28. 9.
and 29. 11. At the prayer of good Hezekiah, the Lord heard and healed the
people, 2. Chron. 30. 20. yea at his request also delivered them, and
confounded the devouring adversaries. 2. Chron. 32. 20. 21.

If the words be taken not as a prayer, Explanatio^.
but as a part of the sentence with the former; then it is, as if it had been
said, that he praised God for this salvation showed to him, which was Gods
blessing upon his people: for so here they be called: and so from hence may we
learn,

That the preservation of a godly and a gracious King, Doct. 1.
is the blessing of God upon the people, 1. King. 10. 9. That which may be said
of the setting up of such a King, the same may be avouched of the preserving
him. 2. Sam, 5. 12.

To bless God for the long life and reign of godly Kings and Queens: Use.
for their lives are the peoples blessing, as may appear in David, Iehosaphat,
Hezekiah, Josiah, etc. And the manifold change of Princes is a punishment of
God for the sins of the people, as Solomon tells us.

That the people committed to the charge of the mighty, Doct. 2.
are the Lords, and not theirs. 1. Sam. 2. 24. 2. Sam. 5. 2.

The mighty Potentates to consider of this, Use.
that their Sovereignty is a charge (as Moses speaks, Numb. 11. 11.) over
Gods people: and therefore to reign as did David, 2. Sam. 8. 15. knowing that
they shall make account unto God for his people, committed to their custody.
