THE CHRISTIANS SPIRITUAL CONFLICT. Derived from Scripture by a Learned Divine.
[1]
MUse often from whence thou came, but blushing muse: Psalm. 51. 5. 84. 3. Genesis
3. 19. Rev. 20. 12. Eccles. 2. Eccles. 12. 7. Matthew 13. 41, 42, 43. Revelat.
14. 13. Revelat. 20. 5.

From Dust thou came, to dust thou must return.
Muse often where go thou must, but trembling Muse:
What! cause to joy, sure cause thou have to mourn:
Thy Soul from God it came, and must return
In Heaven to rest, and joy, or in Hell burn.
[2]
Death certain is, and never fails his part: Genesis 6. 3. Job 14. 1, etc. Isa.
40. 6. Luke 12. 46. Mat. 24. 36. Mark. 13. 32. 1 King. 15. 14. 2 King. 18. 3.
22. Psa. 1. 2. 119. Mat 16. 18. Rev 14. 13. Psa. 37. 37. 1 Ioh. 3. 20, 21.

The Day's uncertain; more the Hour, and Way:
If thou the Lord have served with perfect heart,
Nor Hell, not Death, then may thee much dismay.
Against all Cares, yea Death, or what is termed grief,
A well led life's, a sure and sweet relief.
[3]
Thy humble Soul do wicked thoughts molest; Mat. 4 1. Romans 7. 18, 19 1 Cor. 10
13. 2 Timothy 1. 3. 12 Iam. 1. 2. 12. Heb. 2. 18. 12. Chap. 1, 2, 3. Rev. 7. 14.

Why? this is Satan's Sin, if no consent
To them thou give, but wholly to detest
And eke abhor them all, thine heart is bent:
Let them as freely go, as they do come,
The more thou striv'st, the more they will prove irksome.
[4]
With Sins presumptuous, though they Soul be gored, Mat. 12. 31. 2 Chr. 33. 9,
10, 11, 12, 13. Job. 6. 4. 13. 26. 10. 9. Ps. 6. 77. 31. 22. Mat. 18. 22. 9.
12, 13. Luke 4. 18. 2 Cor. 5. 20. Mark 9. 23. Act. 2 38. Mat. 3. 8. Mark. 1. 4.
Prove. 24. 16. Luk 13. 27. Ioh. 5. 14.

Or though Despair by fits thy Soul has seized;
Yea, or Relapse, dangerous to be deplored,
By Faith, and Sorrow, God may be appeased.
To err and fall is common and humane.
But to persist War, that is a divilish strain.
[5]
Then be not Faithless, nor in Sins persist, Ioh. 20. 27. Heb. 11. 6. Ier. 3.
23. in the Lam. Act. 2. 38. 2 Timothy 2, 19. Isa. 57. 15. Luke 15. 12. Vsque ad
finem Prove. 28. 13. Ezekiel. 18. 21.

With his, his Mercy God renews each morn,
Be penitent, from all thy Sins desist:
If truly grieved, then never thou art forlorn.
A fit of Sorrows, but a fit not right,
Repentance, but amendment's Gods delight.
[6]
Serve thou the Lord with pure and perfect will, 1 Samuel 30 6. 26. Romans 8. 28.
Ezekiel 43. 7, 8. Josh. 7. 10, 11, 12. 2 Samuel 11. 27. 12. 1. 14. Psalm. 32. 3, 4,
5. Iam. 2. 10. Ioh. 9. 31. Ioh. 3. 22.

Whatsoever befalls thee, then count it for best:
But if that thou persist in ought that is ill,
Till thou forsake it, never look for rest.
If thou but walk in one of Satan's Ways,
So long thou do Eclipse Iehovahs rays.
[7]
Else seventy seven times, though thou sin'st or more, Matthew. 18. 22, 23. 2 Chronicles. 23. 9. 10. Isa. 1. 18. Romans 5. 20. Ioh. 1. 29. Job. 19. 34. Ioh. 16. 26.
Matthew. 1. 21.

And eke in Sin have swom, as in a flood;
Where Sin abounds, there Grace abounds much more,
A world of Sin is cleans'd by Christ's dear blood:
Behold it streaming forth with Arms out-spread,
Thy Mediator, Savior, and Head.
[8]
Recall to mind how God has been thy friend, Psalm. 77. 10. Io. 10. 29. Heb. 13.
6. Isa. 49 15. Ezekiel. 18. 21, 22. Psalm. 19. 13. 1 Cor. 19. 9. 10. Numb. 14. 45.
Ez. 18 24.

God never his Glory will give to another.
Whom God once loves, he loves unto the end.
Sin, nor Satan, can his Grace quite smother.
Presume not yet, nor tempt the Lord on high,
Lest as the Tree that falls, block-like thou lie.
[9]
Unfeigned Desire, haste thou to cry and moan, Psalm. 10. 17. 145. 19. Eze. 9.
4. Psalm. 34. 18. 102. 20. Io. 7. 37. Romans 8. 26. Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3. Perkins Case
60. foll. 167. 2 Cor. 8. 12.

To grieve for Sin, in Christ for to believe.
Can Pray? or, Can thou not? Can sigh, can groan?
Of all thy Sins then thou thy self may shrieve.
Thy honest mind for deed, will be repute,
Blot out thy sins, and never them impute.
[10]
Do love a man, because he loves the Lord? 1 Io. 3. 14. Matthew. 10. 41. Luke
10. 6. Coll. 3. 14. Perkins Case, foll. 107. Isa. 43. 25. Mich 7. 18, 19. Mark
3. 16, 17.

Why? this is Grace; as in a fading Tree,
There Is life, if but one Branch her juice afford.
So in a Soul distressed if Charity;
For God accepts what is his, remitting thine;
So much his Soul to his, still does incline.
[11]
So though they Sins in dreadful tropes appear, Isa. 55. 7. Matthew. 11 28. Isa.
4. 10. Psalm. 34. 9. Isa. 57. 15. Matthew. 11. 29. Isa. 4. 7. 1. 12. 1 Pet. 1. 6,
7.

Draw near unto thy God, the humble Soul
He dwells with, to revive, and for to cheer.
If thou do seek him, Satan he will control;
What though he hides his face, his seal is sure,
'Twas but to try thee, if thy Faith endure.
[12]
Be humble, yet despair not though he hide Matthew. 5. 3. Isa. 4. 6. Psalm. 22. 2.
69. 3. Ephesians. 6. 18. Matthew 4. 17. Isa. 62. 6, 7. Heb. 13. 16. Matthew. 9. 23.
Perkins Case, foll. 101.

His face till death, his Grace stands sure for aye;
Believe, repent, amend, praying abide,
Then can he never leave thee, though delay:
Impenitent faithless hearts debar Gods face,
Else all thy Sins cannot exclude his Grace.
[13]
Exclude then by thoughts, limit not the Lord, Isa. 1. 2. Ephesians. 6. 13. 16.
Psalm. 145. 9. 1 Cor. 10. 13. 2 Cor. 12. 19. Heb. 2. 18. Matthew. 9. 12, 13. Acts,
10. 43. Acts, 4. 12. Rev. 22. 17. Heb. 11. 4, 5, 6.

For this, or that Sin, whatsoever thy grief;
Sufficient is his Grace, and will afford,
In all distress, some comfort and relief.
Take hold on Christ, on any terms whatsoever
If thou him lose, then thou art lost for ever.
FINIS.
