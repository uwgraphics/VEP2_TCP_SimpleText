THE CHARACTER OF A COUNTRY Committee-man, With the Eare-marke of a
SEQUESTRATOR.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1649. August. 21

MADAM,
NEver were the Scales so even between presumption and despair as they are
now poysed in the aspiring votary, for as the height of your Judgment makes me
justly diffident of my unworthy offering, so I am assured your censure will
relent in pardon; when you look upon it as an error of devotion, the same
alter which disdains the acceptance of my blemished sacrifice, will
nevertheless give refuges and protection to your grovelling offenders: Madam,
It is a violation of your worth, to present you with vanities, all sacrilege
is not dressed after the fashionable cut of this age, in Rapine and Robbery,
it may be committed in giving, where the gift is a demunition and by a
scandalous homeliness, profanesse, as it were the very consecration, but I
will not traverse your Ladyships commands by pleading the meanness of the
trifle you have deyned to require, I am resolved to obey you at all adventures,
and with the loss both of credit and modesty to inhance my observance, let
others in their addresses seek after fame, and by choosing Honorable Gossips
to their petty Issue, drive a luster from their Dedications, my endeavors are
of a more bashful Mode, then to ask blessing of the sun, yet since your
Ladyships summons has been pleased to entitle them to a room in your
Cabinet, that Cabinet which alone is Theater sufficient for all the rarities
and perfections of the Age, they shall attend you Madam, but striped of all
interest since a sinceere obedience, as you may see by my enclosed
Committeeman, who is so void of Ornament that he seems to be shaped, after his
new Model of self denial, Madam it is a British tribute that Antiquity paid
in the head of wolves, how aptly this present of the Committee-man revives the
Custom; for as his ravenous nature has a near alliance with that of the
other, so nonefitter to return to the first fruits, of his tributary
punishment.

Than your Ladyship who have suffered so much by the savage Beast in your
worryed fortune, in which my attempt of vindicative Justice, if my abillities
have not kept pace with my desire, if my revenge be not as keen and poynant as
the malice of my subject, it will be your Charity to imagine that I was dull
upon design, and did industriouslly rebate my Edge to prolong the Torment of
his execution, I desire Madam, let me be your supplyant in this, that when you
have gilded the Paper with the beams of your proposal, you will confine it
after to shade and sollitude, both because Satyrs like Bandog acquire a
fiercenss by being tied up, and withal because it is the opinion of your
servant that published Compositions are but so many Breves that wander for the
Al^^^s of approbation.

MADAM, He that with reverence admires your virtues. I: C.

The Character of a Country Committee Man with the Eare-marke of a Sequestrator.
A Committee man by his name should be one that is possessed, that is number
enough in the compellation to make it an Epithet for Legion; he is persona in
concreto (to borrow the Solecisme of a modern Statesman) you may translate it
by the red bull phrase and speak as properly, enter seven devils solus, It is
a well trust title that contains both the number and the beast. For a
Committee-man is a noun of Multitude, he must be spelled with figures, like
Antichrist wrapped in a pair, Royal of Sixes, thus the name is as monstrous
as the man, a complete notion of the same linnage with accomulative treason,
for his office, it is the resurrection of the Heptarchy or England fritters, it
is the broken meat of a Crumbling Prince, only the Royalty is greater, for it
is here, as in the miracle of Loaves the voyder exceeds the Bill of fare, the
Pope and he rings the Changes; here is a plurality of Crowns to one head, Join
them together and there is harmony in discord, the Tripple crowned Turn-Key of
Heaven, with the tripple headed porter of hell, A Committee-man is the relics
of Regal Government, but like holy relics he out bulks the substance whereof
he is a remnant, there is a score of Rings in a Committee as in the relics of
the Cross, there is the number of twenty, This is the Giant with the hundred
hands that weilds the Scepter, the tyrannical Beade-Roule by which the
Kingdom prays backward, and with a kind of Rebus at every Curse drops a
Committee man, Let CHARLES be wayned whose conducing clemency agravates the
defection, and make Nero the question, better a Nero then a Committee, There Is
less examination by a single Bullet then by case shot.

Now a Committee-man is a party colored officer, he must be drawn like Janus
with Cross and Pile in his countenance, as he relates to the Soldiers, or
face about to his fleecing the Country, look upon him Martially and he is a
Justice of War.

One that has bound his Dalton up in Buffe, and will needs be of the quorum to
the best Commanders, he is one of Mars his Lay Elders, he shares in the
Government, though a Nonconformist to his bleeding Rubick, he is the like
Sectary in Arms as the Platonic is in love, keep a flattering in discourse
but proves haggard in the action; he is not of the Soldiers and yet of his
flock, it is an emblem of the golden age (and such indeed he makes it) to him,
when so tame a Pigeon may commerce with vultures, Me thinks a Committee hanging
about a Governor and Bandleirs, dangling about furd Alderman have an Anagrame
resemblance, there is no Syntax between a Cap of maintenance and a helmet, who
ever knew an enemy routed by a Grand Jury, and a billa vera: it is a left
handed Garrison where their authority perches, but the more preposterous the
more in fashion the right hand fights while the left rules the Reins, the truth
is the Soldier and the Gentleman are like Don Quicchott and Sancho Pancha one
fights at all adventures to purchase the other, the Government of the Island, a
Committe-man properly should be the Governor Natrosse to fit his tackle, and
to new string him with sinnews of War for his chief use to raise assessements
in the neighboring Wapentake.

The Country people being like an Irish Cow, that will not give down the Milk
unless she see her Calf before her: hence it is, he is the Garrisons dry
Nurce, he chews their Contribution before he feeds them, so the poor Soldiers
live like Trochilus by picking the teeth of this sated Crocoadile.

So much for his warlike or ammunition face which is so preturnaturall that it
is rather a vizard then a face, Mars in him has but a blinking aspect, his
face of Arms is like his Coat party per pale, Soldier and Gentleman much of
a scantling.

Now enter his Taxing and deglubing face, a squeezing look like that of
Vespasians as if he were breeding over a closestoole. Take him thus and he is
the Inquisition of the purse, an Auchentick Gypsy, that Nips your bung with a
canting Ordinance, not a murdered fortune in all the Country but bleeds at the
touch of this malefactor, he is the spleen of the body politic that swells it
self to the consumption of the whole, at first indeed he ferretted for the
Parliament, but since he has got of his Cope, he set up for himself, he lives
upon the sins of the people, and that is a good standing dish too, he verifies
the Axiom Eisdom mutritur ex quibus componiter, his diet is suitable to his
constitution, I have wondered often why the plundered Countrymen should repair
to him for succor, certainly it is under the same notion as one whose pockets
are picked goes to Mol: Cutpurse as the predominant in that faculty.

He out dives a Dutchman, gets a noble of him that was never worth six pence,
for the poorest escape not, but Dutch like he will be dreyning even in the
dryest ground, he Aliens a Delinquents Estate with as little remorse as his
other holiness gives away an Heretics Kingdom, and for the truth of the
Delinquency, both Chapmen have a little share of Infallability, Lie is the
Grand Sallad of Arbitrary Government, Executor to the Star Chamber, and
High Commission for those Courts are not extinct, they survive in him like
Dollary changed into single monys, to speak the truth he is the universal
tribunal for since these times, all causes fall to his Cognizance, as in a
great infection diseases often turn to the plague it concerns our Masters the
Parliament to look about them (...) he proceeds at this rate, the Jack may come
to swallow the Pike, as the interest often eats out the principal, as his
commands are great, so he looks for reverence accordingly; He is very punctual
in exacting your hat, and to say right, it is his due, but by the same title,
as the upper garment is the vailes of the executioner; There was a time when
such cattle would have hardly been taken upon suspicion for men in office,
unless the old proverb were renewed, and beggars make a free company, and
those their wardens; you may see what it is to hang together, look upon them
severally, and you cannot but fumble for some threeds of charity, but oh they
are Tarmagants in conjunction, like Fiddlers who are Rogues when they go
singly, and joined in consort, gentlemen Musitioners. I care not much if I
untwist my Committee-man, and so give him the receipt of this grand Catholican,
take a State Martyr, one that for his good behavior, has paid the Excise of
his ears, so suffered Captivity by the Land-piracie of Ship Money, next a
primitive freeholder.

One that hates the King, because he is a Gentleman transgressing the Magna
Charta of delving Adam. Add to these a Mortified Bankerupt that helps out his
false Weights with some scruples of conscience, and with his peremptory scales
can doom his Prince with a Mean tecall. These with a new blew-stocking'd
Justice lately made of a good basket-hilted Yeoman, with a short-handed Clerk
tack't to the Rear of him, to carry the Knapsack of his understanding,
together with two or three Equivocall Sirs, whose Religion like their Gentility
is the Extract of their Acres, being therefore spiritual, because they are
earthly; Not forgetting the man of Law, whose corruption gives the Hogan to the
sincerer Juncto; These are the simples of this precious Compound, a kind of
Dutch hotch-potch, the Hogan Mogan Committeeman.

A Commettee-man has a Side-man, or rather a setter hight a Sequestrator, of
whom you may say, as of the great Sultans horse, where he treads the grass
grows no more. He is the States Cormorant, one that fishes for the Public,
but feeds himself, the misery is, he fishes without the Cormorants property,
a rope to streighten the gullet, and to make hime disgorge. A Sequestrator! he
is the Devils Nuthooke, the sign with him is always in the clutches. There Is
more Monsters retain to him, then to all the limbs in Anatomy. It Is strange
Physicians do not apply him to the soles of the feet in a desperate Feavour,
he draws far beyond Pigeons: I hope some Mountebanke will slice him, and
make the Experiment. He is a tooth-drawer once removed, here is all the
difference one applauds the Grinder, and the other the Grist. Never till now
could I verify the Poets description, that the ravenous Harpie had a humane
visage: Death it self cannot quit scores with him, like the Demoniack in the
Gospel he lives among Tombs Nor is all the holy water shed by Widows and
Orphans a sufficient Exorcisme to dispossess him. Thus the Cat sucks your
breath, and the Fiend your blood; Nor can the Brotherhood of Witchfinders so
sagely instituted with all their terror weane the Familiars.

But once more to single out my imbost Committee-man his Fate (for I know you
would fain see an end of him) is either a whipping Audit, when he is wrung in
the withers by a Committee of Examinations; And so the sponge weeps out the
moisture which he soaked before, or else he meets his passing peale in the
clamorous mutiny of a gut-foundred Garrison; For the Hedge-sparrow will be
feeding the Cuckoo, till he mistake his Commons, and bite off her head.
Whatever it is, it is within his desert, for what is observed of some
Creatures, that at the same time they trade in productions three stories high*
suckling the first, bigg with the second, and cliketting for the third; A
Committeman in the Counterpoint, his Mischiefs superfetation a certain scale
of destruction, for he ruins the Father, beggars the Son, and strangles the
hopes of all posterity.

FINIS.
