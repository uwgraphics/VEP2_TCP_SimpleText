AN ACT FOR ABOLISHYNGE OF DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS IN CERTAIN ARTICLES
CONCERNING CHRISTEN RELYGION. CAP. XIIII.
WHERE THE KINGS MOST excellent majesty is by gods law supreme heed
immediately under him of this hole church and congregation of England,
intendinge the conservation of the same church and congregation in a true
sincere and uniform doctrine of Christ's religion, calling also to his blessed
and most gracious remembrance, as well the great and quiet assurance, prosperous
increace, and other innumerable commodities, which have ever ensued come and
followed of Concord agreement and unity in opinions, as also the manyfolde
peryls dangers and inconveniences, which have heretofore in many places and
regions, grown spronge and ar risen of the diversities of minds and opinions,
especially of mattiers of Christen religion: And therefore desyring, that such
an unity might and should be charitably establysshed in all things,
touching and concerning the same, as the same so being establysshed might
chiefly be to the honor of almyghtye God, the very authoure and fountain of
all true unity and sincere concord, and consequentlye redounde to the commonwealth of this his hyghenes most noble realm, and of all his louinge
subjects, and other resiauntes and inhabitauntes of or in the same: has
therefore caused and commanded this his most high court of Parlyamente, for
sondrye and many vrgente causes and consyderations, to be at this time
sommoned, and alsoo a Synod and convocation of all the archebysshoppes,
bysshoppes, and other learned men of the clergy of this his realm, to be in
like manner assembled.

And for as much as in the said parliament Synod and convocation, there were
certain articles matiers and questions proponed and setforthe, touching
Christen religion, that is to say. First, whether in the most blessed
Sacrament of thaltar remains after the consecration, the substance of bread
and wine, or no. Secondly, whether it be necessary by gods law, that all men
should be communicate with both kinds or no. Thirdly, whether priests, that
is to say, men dedicate to God by priesthode, may by the law of God, marye
after, or no. Fourthly, whether vow of chastity or wydowhed made to God
advisedly by man or woman, be by the law of God to be observed or no. Fyftly,
whether private Masses stand with the law of God, and be to be used and
continued in the church and congregation of England, as things, whereby good
Christen people may and do receive both godly consolation, and wholesome
benefytes, or no. Sixthly, whether Auricular confession is necessary to be
retained, continued, used, and frequented in the church, or no. The kings most
royal majesty, most prudently ponderynge and considering, that by occasion
of variable and sundry opinions and judgments of the said articles, great
discord and variance has arysen, as well amongst the clergy of this his
realm, as amongeste a great nombre of the vulgar people, his loving subjects
of the same: And being in a full hope and trust, that a full and perfect
resolution of the said articles, should make a perfyte concord and unity
generally among all his loving and obedient subjects, of his most excellent
goodness not only commanded, that the said articles should deliberatly and
aduysedly, by his said archebysshops, bishops, and other learned men of his
clergy, be debated argued, and reasoned, and their opinions therein to be
understand declared and known, but also most graciously vouchesaued, in his
own princely person, to discende and come into his said high court of
Parlyament and council, and there like a prince of most high prudence, and no
less learning, opened and declared many things of high lernyng and great
knowledge, touching the said articles mattiers and questions, for an unity to
be had in the same. Whereupon after a great and long deliberate and advised
disputation and consultation had and made, concerning the said articles, as
well by the consent of the kings hyghenes, as by thassent of the Lords
spiritual and temporal, and other learned men of his clergy in their
convocation, and by the consent of the commons in this present Parliament
assembled, it was and is finally resolved accorded and agreed in manner and
form following. That is to say. First, that in the most blessed Sacrament of
the altar, by the strength and efficacy of Christ's mighty word (it being
spoken by the priest) is present really under the form of bread and wine, the
natural body and blood of our savior Jesus Christ, conceived of the virgyn
Mary: And that after the consecration there remains no substance of bred or
wine nor any other substance, but the substance of Christ, God and man.

Secondly, that communion in both kinds, is not necessary Ad salutem, by the
law of God to all persons. And that it is to be believed and not doubted of,
but that in the flesh, under form of bred, is the very blood: and with the
blood, under form of wine, is the very flesh as well aparte, as though
they were both together.

Thirdly, that priests, after the order of priesthode received, as before, may
not marye by the law of God.

Fourthly, that vows of chastity or wydowhed, by man or woman made to God
advisedly, ought to be observed by the law of God: and that it exempteth them
from other liberties of Christen people, which without that they might enjoy.

Fyftly, that it is mete and necessary, that private Masses be continued and
admitted in this the kings English church and congregation, as whereby good
Christen people, ordering them selfs accordyngly, do receive both godly and
goodly consolations and benefytes: and it is agreeable also to gods law.

Sixthly, that Auricular confession is expedient and necessary to be retained
and continued used and frequented in the church of God. For the which most
godly study pain and travail of his majesty, and determination and
resolution of the premises, his most humble and obedient subjects, the
lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons in this present parliament
assembled, not only render and give unto his hyghenes, their most high and
hearty thanks, and think them selfs most bonden, to pray for the long
continuance of his graces most royal estate, but also being desirous, that his
most godly enterprise may be well accomplysshed and brought to a full end
and perfection, and so establysshed, that the same might be to the honor of
God, and after to the common quiet unity and concord to be had in the hole
body of this realm for ever. Most humbly besechen his royal majesty, that
the resolution and determination above written of the said articles, may be
establysshed and perpetually perfyted by authority of this present parliament.
