Printed for the Author, 1682,

For the year 1682.
Of the late Comet that was seen in December 1680.
THIS dreadful Comet (the like whereof (I suppose) was never seen by many (if
any) generation before us) that appeared most manifestly in England in December
1680. Seemed (when I first saw it) to show it self about the beginning of the
second face of Capricorn, between the bodies of the Sun and the Planet Mercury,
and near the opposite place of Saturn; but I received advice from a friend of
mine, that this Comets first appearance was in the watery sign Scorpio, the
house of the fiery Plannet Mars; and that it was seen before the sun rising, on
the 25th of November, at six of the clock in the morning: But in what sign
soever it had its beginning or birth, it was observed to appear in a sign of
every Triplicity, which certainly denotes varieties of evils, distinguished
sufficiently in my last years little book, to which I referred the Reader; but
whereas it appeared most powerfully to us in Capricorn and Aquaries, and more
weakly in Pisses; (and Aries the assendant of England and France, where it was
supposed to have been extinguished) therefore those places under Capricorn and
Aquaries will be subject to the most woeful effects; never the less, I fear
those places under Aries will be subject to afflictions, that will be bad
enough, for though it appeared very weakly therein, yet it is probable enough,
that it appeared very powerful and dreadful in many other Countries under
Aries, as well as in England, at that time when we beheld it in Capricorn and
Aquaries, for Comets do not only manifest their effects in those Countries,
under the signs wherein they appeared, but also in those Countries where they
appeared most dreadful and most visible, and therefore it may be feared that
the effects of this dreadful Comet, appertains to many foreign Countries, and
that God is preparing woes for many Nations, if not for most nations in the
World. And whereas the Tail of this Comet was very long, and the time of its
continuance also long, it denotes the strength and powerfulness of its
operation (and by consequence the more dreadfulnesse of the effects) and the
durability thereof, which will shortly be seconded, and the effects thereof
continued, by the powerful operations of no less then three conjunctions of
Saturn and Jubiter in the fiery sign Leo; and as this Comet was swift in
motion, and run through many signs, so it may be feared that the influence
thereof will seem also by its effects to be swift in motion, from one Country
to an other; and whereas the Star it self (or Comets body) seemed to be very
small, that it ^uld not (first espeasily) be easily diserned, and a very
dreadful and visible stream or Tail issued from it, from hence it may (not
groundlessly) be conjectured that there will be many secret and close
conspiraces and contrivances in many Countries, out of which there will go very
visible streams of wrathful furious wicked and treaterous actions, (or more
plainly such effects from the violent breaking forth of some Plot or Plots) I
have heard reports of other Comets that have been seen, but I have not seen
them my self, but I received intelligence from a friend of mine that on
Thursday the 24 day of March 1681 about eleven of the clock at night, there
were seen in their town by diverse Persons of good credit two dreadful Meteors,
near the Moon, by their declaring the one in Virgo, before the Moon, the other
in Scorpio, following the Moon, which Meteors much terrified and affrighted the
spectatours. Comets and fiery Meteros are tokens of many hot and dry
exhalations in the air, which so dry up the humors in men, and increase
cholor that they are easily stirred up to quarrels, after which follows blows,
wars and bloodshed, and consequently alterations of Laws and Customs in many
places.

Comets are dreadful objects to men's eyes,
Gods angry Warnings, heavenly rarities,
That still proclaim Gods wrath, some Kingdoms w^,
Plagues, or great Sickness, bloody Wars also.
Of the signification of the two great Eclipses of the Moon in February and
August in the year 1682.
THe first great Eclipse of the Moon will be on the Eleventh day of February
about Eleven at night: Which denotes crosses, losses, and sickness to happen to
Saylors, Merchants, Scribes, Students, and many Noble men, and that many such
will be in danger of being oppressed some way by the wrath of Princes: It
denotes some kind of hurt to the fruits of the Earth, and to Corn, and I doubt
it will cause many discords amongst men, and many distempers of the brain, if
not absolute madness: It also denotes turbulant and pernicious winds, and much
thunder, and lightning, and some more then ordinary stir about Religion. Its
effects will chiefly be manifest in the countries and places under Virgo,
Pisses, Sagittarius (and Gemini the ascendant of London) and (according to the
oppinion of the Ancients) it will manifestly operate in July and so continue
for about four months.

THe second great Eclipse of the Moon will happen on the Eight day of August,
about Six in the morning (but invisible to us:) This threatens the Earths
Inhabitants either with the Plague, or some very dangerous and destructive
sicknesses, and mortality, and with scarcity or dearness of Corn. It denotes
the ruin of Ancient Buildings, Divisions, and hatred amongst Professors of
Religion: Imprisonment and Captivity: Great variances and disunity in Councils,
high winds and Tempests at sea, dangerous sailing. It denotes destruction to
Fishes, and to small Cattle, (it has a woeful signification, whether people
will believe or not:) it may cause madness or some very bad distempers in the
brain. It also denotes the overflowing of Rivers: it very much threatens
Samaria, Ethiopia, Italy, Sicily, Bohemia and some part of Turkey, Hamborrough,
Rome, Prague, Bristol -- and in a less measure Ireland, Russia, Persia,
Cappadocia, Barbary Frankford upon Odar, Valentia in Spain; But (according to
Astrologicall rules) it will not very manifestly operate till about the month
of July 1683 and from thence will so continue about four months.

Sorrows attend the world, when 'clipses great,
With many rare conjunctions opperate,
With Comets too whose strange united force,
May make unsetl'ed times yet worse and worse.
Let Us all lament, repent, and pray that we
May escape dearth, wars and plague, in eighty three,
And also in eighty four,
But in the world there are many unbelieving people, and ignorant enemies of
Astrological Predictions, that think I have too much affrighted the nation, by
my judgment in my other little book, and perhaps, may think I have done the
like now, and so will not believe that God has given such power to Stars,
Planets, Comets, or any Heavenly bodies to cause those effects on earth, but
rather (through their ignorance) think that God usualy causes most effects
without them: but let them consider the Moon, and how God is pleased to tumble
about the waters thereby, and not without the Moon: and let them consider the
Sun, and how God thereby causes the earth and trees to bring forth there
increase and fruit thereof, and not without the Sun; and as it has pleased God
to set the two great lights of Heaven in offices, very manifest to the world;
in like manner he was pleased to give all the other Planets, and lesser Lights
of Heaven; offices and power, (when the first treated them) according to their
natures, to effect his will and purpose on Earth: Moreover God that made all
things, can at his pleasure, make use of all other his creatures, so that he
will not be confined, to work only by the Stars, or only secretly and
internally by his spirit, but what other ways he pleases, so that the Maker
of all, works, in and by all, and is therefore God over all, and is worthy of
all praise, honor, and worship from all. Therefore it is no dishonor to God,
to say he causes effects on Earth by Stars above, but they rather rob their
Maker of his Glory, that contend against this Sublime and Heavenly Science; as
if it were unlawful for us to lift up our eyes to the Heavens, that declare
the Glory of God, and to the Firmament (wherein are fixed so many glittering
and glorius Ornaments) that shows his handy work. But there are ^iversities
of natural gifts, And therefore to one it is given to know those things above
another: and further, to convince those unbelievers of the truth, and certainty
of the Influences of all Celestial bodies, let them look back to the year 1664
wherein there appeared a Comet, and to the year 1663, where there happened a
great Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, in the fiery sign Sagittarius, and to
the year 1659, when the fourteenth revolution of the great Orb since the
Creation was perfected: I say, let them look back and consider if since those
years there have not happened very remarkable Terrestrial Changes, and
wonderful Events according to the rules of (and conseqently promotive to) the
rare, and highly to be esteemed Science of Astrology

The Loadstone's secret virtue can command,
And strangely turn the Needle to each hand:
So every creature, that has life and sense,
Is governed by the starry influence.
Of the Three Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter in the fiery sign Leo now near
at hand; whereof one will happen on the 9th day of October 1682. and one, on
the 30th of January following, and the last, on the 2d day of May following.
It is both rare and wonderful that those Two superior Planets should be no
less than three times conjoined (in somewhat less than seven Months) in the
fiery sign Leo; there having been but only one Conjunction there above these
700 years. And therefore those Three Conjunctions proclaim a threefold woe to
the Inhabitants of the Earth, (though many may not believe it;) but chiefly to
the Countries, Cities, Towns, Villages, and Persons, under the sign Leo:
Therefore woe, woe, and a third woe, to Italy, Sicily, Bohemia and some part of
Turkey, to the City of Damascus, and chiefly to the City of Rome, the fountain
of Popery, folly and wickedness, for those Conjunctions that happen in the
fiery ^rigon, do chiefly respect Men, Matters, and Places of the highest
account; (the Pope, Popery, and Rome have too long been so) that I conclude
this Triple, or Threefold Conjunction in Leo (the ascendant of Rome and all
Italy) will in a few years either strike of his Triple Crown, or give him
three terrible strokes, whereby he will loose the greatest part of his Honor,
Power, and Majesty on earth, for the strokes will be the more dreadful,
because of the Two other Conjunctions, viz. of Jupiter and Mars: and Saturn and
Mars, in the same sign Leo, near the degree of the first Conjunction of Saturn
and Jupiter: Jupiter is too virtuous a Planet to own the Pope, or his Orders,
but it being more natural to him to own good Christians, he has assigned the
Pope up to Saturn, the Author of Plots and mischief: and Saturn being weaker
than Jupiter in the conflict (for they will have a Combat when they are in
Conjunction because of the contrariety of their natures, Saturn being cold and
dry, and the greatest infortune, and Jupiter being hot and moist, and the
greatest fortne) therefore the Pope and his Orders, in a few years, must needs
have a great Downfall; for Jupiter is not only stronger than Saturn, but is
resolved to fight with his adversary, three times, in somewhat less than
seven Months, with the undaunted courage of a Lion. Oh Rome thy abominations
have been Great, and thy Great sins remaihst which thy Great head (the Pope;)
has to the Great dishonor ofned Great God undertook to pardon; But now the
Great year is at hand, and thy Great sorrows are approaching, and thy
foundation will Greatly be shaken, because it is not the Rock of Ages, the sure
foundation; Great Judgments are preparing for thee: Never yet (I suppose)
received thou such terrible strokes (Since thou wast first called Rome) as
those (in few years) are like to be. Quamobrem gaudeamus and maxim laetemur:

God has not made Celestial works in vain,
But in them power and virtue great remain:
They cause effects on earth, by them we know
That God is working changes here below.
Of the Lord of the year
Saturn lays claim to be Lord of the year, because he has the greatest
Dignities in the Hylegiacal places of the three Vernal figures, and he and the
Moon are both in the Lion, in an Angle of strife (the house of war) and his
Lord is with the body of Mars, partly through which, and partly through the
great Dignities that Mars has in the Hylegiacal places of the Vernal figure,
we may join him as a Copartner with Saturn: the Angles being also more fixed
than Moveable, that strong steadfast (and not much whiffling) will the
resolutions of many discontented Martial minded persons be, to carry on weighty
(but wicked) designs; that this is likely enough to be a year of evil
conspiracies and of great disunity, and rather of Martial activity than of
dronishnesse, and the better to satisfy all friendly Readers I refer them to
my Monthly Observations following

Monthly Observations, briefly containing the most remarkable events and
accidents that are likely to happen in every particular Month this present year
1682.
Ianuary's Observations
THe hearts of the Comonaltie now entertain much hatred and enmity against some
persons in Authority: some of whom act very politickly, and secretly against
them, as if they aimed at some further treacherous actions: that it is yet
improper to call this a month of complete unity: Rulers and Magistrates of many
Countries and Cities can hardly keep in any sound unity amongst themselves:
some great controversies now happen in Rome and in many other places under the
fiery sign Leo, amongst persons both of mean and great account: many are now
imprisoned: Scotland and Holland will now be more at peace than many other
places; and pretty good unity is likely to be in their Councills; yet I fear
some imperfection through some religious disputes (not very contentious)
amongst some of different religions: dangerous distempers amongst Cattle great
and small: some alteration of weather about the 12, or 13 day.

When stars dissent in heaven, on earth they sow,
Contentious seeds in humane hearts below:
That God by them our comforts would increase!
Banish our woes, proclaim Celestial peace!
Febuary's Observations
MUch hatred, trouble, and discontent, remains in peoples minds concerning some
late difference, and one domineers over another especially in those Countries
Cities and Places under the fiery sign Leo: Let us beware of The^veries, and
breaking open of shops, and houses, and all private mischievous actions; I
confess many benevolent Aspects happen this month, but all is not Gold that
glisters: Magistrates are now angry with some religious Professors: Seamen now
much perplexed with high winds and tossing weaves: Diseases of Melancholy now
chiefly take possession of men's bodies at the beginning of this month, and
diseases of Choler at the latter end: a probability of rain or snow, on, or
about, the 9, 22, or 23 day.

The smiling looks of wandering stars above,
Incline our hearts the more to peace and love;
But there is a seed that will arise I doubt
And turn unstable love to faling out.
March's Observations
THe hearts of the Comonalty are none pretty much linked to Superiors, but I
doubt the hearts of Superiors will not be so well linkt to each other: The
Comonalty of many places will be verl apt to be contentious amongst themselves
that this is likely to be a month of remarkable debate and variances, not only
in En. and France, but in man other Countries and places, that it is very
improper to call this a month of peace; though I could wish it were established
throughout all the Earth: The London Apprentices are now very Courageous and
high spirited, and will be very apt to give affronts: this month or the next
Magistrates will have inclinations to oppress some sort of Meeters: many
suffer by imprisonment, if not by Iron chains also; especially at London:
danger of some robberies and theeveries. This month ends; or the next begins
with come remarkable consultations: much sickness: much rain and wind, about
the 23 day, and at the months end.

What hurly burly's this in heaven, that I,
No less than Planets Five in Aries spy.
Lucina changes in that high degree,
Where Kingly Sol will still exalted be.
April's Observations.
GReat consultations, variances in Counsels: tumultuous contriversies in many
places: much policy in men's brains, and great conrage in many hearts: Rulers
or Magistrates some way displeased by some sort of religious Professors, whence
ensue hot and angry disputes and sharp words: a little danger, of some
disturbance in Ireland: some common persons promoted, or raised unto some
higher degree, or pretty high offices, others dejected: Cattle (especially the
smaller sort) now very subject to diseases and distempers: Close, secret, and
very private stealing: people will now either be subject to madness or some
kind of frantic fits: many suffer punishment by the French disease (ergo
cavete and abstinete qui amatis valitudines) a sickly season: much rain during
the first half of this month, or till the 20 day.

When Sol and Luna both together move,
And are conjoined in heavenly Orbs above,
It Is rare to see Five Planets of the Seven
Parling and jarring in the midst of heaven.
May's Observations
THe thoughts of some late quarrel yet remain in many hearts, who being but
subjects are now so high and lofty spirited and courageous, that they even
scorn to be trodden by those of higher degree: I am afraid this will prove
ahmonth of very great controversies in many places especially in Br -- and ce
places under Leo: all is not well in Ireland: let us beware of all close
^ontrivances and treacherous actions which are now much to feared: let Br --
beware of fire and all evil events: very great contentions arise in bargaining
and between men and their wives: very dangerous sicknesses, hard and very
difficult to be cured now sceiz on the bodies of men, and it will strike hard
ta the heart and head: much rain on or about the 16 day, and the 29 or 30.

Next Month (I deem) will shows the reason why,
Five Planets now consult in Gemini.
They parle, and with great fury are possessed,
And if some past debate's yet in the breast
Iune's Observations.
I Confess the two fortunes are now both in Cancer, which may well be supposed
to be a good preservative to Scotland and Holland: but about the beginning, and
latter end, great variances in many places may be feared: I doubt the latter
end of this month, or some part of the next, will prove a season of some evil
activity; that some Plot and treacherous disign may very secretly and
politickly be carried on in the City of London, against the Rulers and Supreme
Power of the Nation; let the places under Gemini and Leo chiefly beware of all
evil events. Let none be offended at my good counsel; forewarned, half armed:
many theeveries and robberies happen this month and dangerous sicknesses seiz
on the bodies of people: rain about the 12 or 13 day, and about the 26, or 27,
day: a probabilty of thunder about the 8, and 23 day.

Great secrets are in heavenly sheets enrolled,
And I the secrets of the heavens unfold;
Those heavenly words of Starry letters made,
I now Translate, that every one may read.
Iuly's Observations.
MIschieveous intents possess the hearts of many: great envy reigns and rules
with great subitlty, policy and secrey in the hearts of some pretended
subjects, whose aims are to effect their evil designs, against the Powers and
Rulers, which they ought to be submissive unto: very great variances amongst
high and low: great wrath and fury, and great disturbances in many places,
especially in those Countries, Cities, and Places, under the signs Gemini,
Sagittarius, Leo, and Aquarius: Let London beware of some Plot: Holland and
Scotland are some what disquieted. I do not possitively couclude that this
great wrath will produce wars or battles this month, though it may be feared
yet I rather believe the matter is not yet ripe enough but however the ripening
time is at hand, and the next year draws nigh, without doubt wars and great
disturbances amongst many Nations are near: The great Eclipse of the Moon in
February begins now manifestly to operate: The month is like to prove extreme
sickly, abundance dye: a probability of Rain on or about the 10 day, and the
23, and 24, and the likeliest days for thunder and lightning are the 7, 14, and
22 day, if not rain withal.

When Kingly Sol to Saturn comes; the Moon
Comes quickly to him too; but then to soon
She hastens to the discontented Sun
And from him with Saturnine light does run
August's Observations
THe Comonalty now sigh for quiet times and mightily desire peace but at the
latter end of the month (and I doubt in the next month also) very terrible
actions and tumultuous controversies and great wrath (if not worse) are likely
to be the sad events thereof, which I greatly fear will be carried on with very
great subtilty and with close and secret conspiracies: what Plots and
mischievous designs are now in our days in the hearts of men! it is no Joy to
me that I cannot bring tidings of peace: great variances, divisions and
distractions in some part of ^urky, in Bohemia, in Italy, especially at Rome,
many quarells in the Cities of Br -- and O -- many leagues and friendships
broken: so that the latter end of this month, and I doubt the next month to,
(chiefly in the places aforesaid) will prove time of much action and
consultation, and great controversies amongst high and low: differences in
Councills and amongst Superiors in Scotland and Holland: this month man great
robberies: terrible strife betwixt men and their wives: dangerous sea voyage:
an extreme sickly season, abundance die, I mean at the letter end of the month
schiefly, and at the beginning of the next: likel hood of some thunder and
lightning with rain about the 5, 6, or 7, day, also rain on, or about, the 21
day, and the 27, and 28 da.

Tour Planets in the Lion fierce conspire:
Why they will associate in the western angle,
The house of strife where Planets best can wrangle
September's Observations
I Cannot yet find the tokens of a peaceable season, but rather of great
desunity and controversies amongst high and low this month (and I doubt the
next to) and they are both likely to prove months of remark able actions and
events, and turbulent doings: this month there happens one Conjunction of
Jupiter and Mars, and another conjunction of the two unfortunate Planets Saturn
and Mars, and therefore I cannot but believe that tumultuous controversies (if
not worse effects) will attend many Nations, Cities, and places: I doubt the L
-- Apprentices will be resolute for some Martial activity this month or the
next also it will not be amiss for London chiefly to be some what wary of fire
this month or the next: we may expect abundance of rain, wind, and blustering
weather this month, and it chiefly happens on or about 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 30, days so that we are like to have turbulent weather
most part of this month.

Just as bright Sol the spring of glorious light,
Does equallize and balance day and night.
The three Superious in the heavens contend,
And darts of fury to great powers do send.
October's Observations.
THis is the month wherein the two superior Planets Saturn and Jubiter make
their first conjunction in the fiery sign Leo; that this is not like to prove a
month of great variance and disunity but also we may expect henceforth Martial
preparations in many Nations, and they will more certainly assure us of those
earthly troubles, b^ their two other Conjunctions, in next January and May,
that I must needs conclude that the year 1683, and 1684, will make many men
sensible of a great part of the sad effects of those three Conjunctions: a
likelihood of rain or hail, on or about, the 8, 9, 10, 15, 28 day.

This month the two Superiors are conjoined,
And in the fiery Trigon are combined,
Their meeting still great changes does foreshew
To happen in the Regious here below.
November's Observations
THis month is likely to be more peaceable than the former, but I doubt their
will happen disunity and differences in Councills: the Commonalty are very apt
now to deride some persons in Authority: Women with Child now very apt to
receive hurt, therefore they ought to have the greater care to prevent
miscarriages: high winds at Sea, and tossing waves obstructing the Seamen
Cattle great and small pretty subject to distempers and sickness: Magistrates
oppose Professors of Religion with very high words: dark, cloudy, if not rain,
hail, or snow, on or about 2, the 10, 11, 24, 25, da^

False cow'rdly Saturn backward slinks from Jove,
Jove spies him, and soon backward to does move;
He runs with Lions strength; be seems not weary,
He over takes his foe in January.
Decembers Observations.
THe hearts of most Professors are now full of zeal, and are apt to be
disquiated by some inferior persons: Magistrates now apt to deride Professors
for their ways and practices, and withal to use some kind of violence to
disturb some sort of meetings this month or the next: many suffer imprisonment:
many theeveries happen or losses: sea voages will be dangerous this month and
the next: some shipwracks and skirmages on the waters: the Planet Mars is now
entered into Libra the opposite sign to Aries ( the ascendent of England and
France) and staes there in no less time than about seven months and a half; I
wish this quarelsome Planet cause not tha: which is worse then common variences
and disturbances in, or against England the next spring or summer France will
be in the same danger: yet I do not conclude that Mars alone so posited is a
sufficient ground for us to fear any such thing, but he will then be more to be
feared than in any other years, because he will he assisted no less then with
three conjuuctions of Saturn and Jubiter in the fiery sign Leo, after one of
which alone usual follows Wars, in or amongst Nations and Kingdoms; let us
consider then what great Wars and terrible bloodshedings are likely to follow
Three: I fear sad times are near at hand, with diverse great changes and
alterations, though diverse ignorant selfconseited persons may now be apt to
deride me, but they may become a derision themselves when my Predictions are
fulfilled: we may expect some change of weather on or about the 21, 22, 23, and
29th day.

When Phoebus bright his downward course has ended,
And to the winter Trophick has desended,
Mars claims high rule, stands at the door of bliss,
As if he would Jov's real friend opresse,
this month or the next.
IT is known to my self, and some others, that most things that I Predicted in
my last years monthly observations, have hitherto been fulfilled, and where I
failed, there I hit very near, but bitter envy and doting ignorance have ever
been apt to despise and trample upon the works of prudence and experience,
though ever so ponderous and consideraete. However to all the real lovers of
Celestial Sciences I benevolently commit my Annual and Monthly Observations
for the year 1682.

FINIS.
