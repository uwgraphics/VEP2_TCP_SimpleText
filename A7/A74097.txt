J thank you twice: Or, The City Courring their own ruin, Thank the
Parliament twice, for their treble undoing.
THe Hierarchy is out of date,
Our Monarchy was sick of late,
But now it is grown to an excellent state,
Oh God a mercy Parliament.
The Teachers know not what to say,
The Prentices have leave to play;
The people have all forgoten to pray,
Still God a mercy Parliament.
The Roundhead, and the Cavalier
Have fought it out almost seven year,
And yet (me thinks) they are never the near,
Oh God etc.
The Gentry are sequestered all,
Our Wives you find at Goldsmiths Hall,
For there they meet with the Devil and all,
Still God etc.
The Parliament are grown to that height,
They care not a pin what his Majesty faith,
And they pay all their debts with the public faith,
Oh God etc.
Though all we had here, is brought to naught,
In Ireland we have whole Lordships bought,
And there we shall one day be rich, it is thought,
Still God a mercy etc.
We must forsake our Father and Mother,
And for the state, undo our own brother,
And never leave murdering of one another,
Oh God etc.
Now the King is caught, and the Devil is dead,
Faireface must be disbanded,
Or else he may chance to be Hothamed,
Still God etc.
They have made King Charles a glorious King,
He was told (long ago) of such a thing,
Now he, and his Subjects have reason to sing,
Oh God a mercy Parliament,
Mr. Fink.
Mr. An. Dom, 1647.
