William Catons Salutation and Advise unto Gods Elect, of what County, Meeting,
or Family soever they are; Mercy and Peace, Joy, and Everlasting Refreshment be
multiplied among you all.
DEarly beloved Friends, my Spirit is and has been under a deep sense of your
joy and pure rejoicing, of your sorrow and sufferings; And in the midst of it,
my heart has been melted and overcome, with the unspeakable love which has
flowed from my life to youward, when I have beheld your glory and beauty, your
comeliness and purity, your innocence and simplicity; And these things my spirit
has viewed, and I have beheld them with much delight, and my heart has been
so ravished with them, even in the night watch, that sleep has vanished from
me; And instead of being overtaken with that which nature is subject unto; My
heart has been filled with joy, my mouth with the high praise of the Lord upon
my bed; And therein my soul has Solaced it self, being abundantly revived with
the fresh streams of my fathers love, which from my soul has flowed forth
like unto a mighty stream: And though my life has breathed forth praises
abundantly unto the Lord, yet my heart is full, and my cup does overflow, and
my soul is poured forth into your bosoms, where my Fathers love and life is
shed abroad, in which I do most dearly salute you.

Oh friends! your work is weighty, your adversaries many, and your temptations
not a few, and these things my soul have weighed, and seriously pondered upon;
And I have observed how the Nations in the most parts where your residence is,
are angry with you, and bends their brows against you, and great have your
sufferings been (in which the Lord has not left you comfortless.) And so is it
with our brethren beyond the Seas, those faith and patience the Lord tries, by
their being exercised in manifold Tribulations, but it appears by their
writings that the Lord is exceeding good unto them, and that their consolation
by his Spirit abounds even in the midst of them, which tend to the furtherance
of the Gospel; And truly I am glad when I consider how patiently you have
suffered violence to be done unto you, without doing violence to your
adversaries, which thing is become of good report among all that fears the
Lord, who have heard of your long suffering and forbearance, which we have
learned of our Lord and Master, who pleads our cause and clears our innocence,
and test f^^th to the faces of your adversaries by his witness that they have
measured that measure to you which they would not have met unto themselves, but
when the cup of trembling comes to be put into their hands, then shall they
with sorrow and grief of heart remember what they have done unto you, who have
patiently sustained grievous sufferings from them, but without controversy
many of them who have affl^cted you, must drink of that cup of suffering which
they have put into your hands, and then shall the oppressions wherewith they
have oppressed you, become their exceeding heavy burden; But however friends,
if the Lord should yet suffer your sufferings to be prolonged and continued for
a season, faint not you in your minds, but be strong in the power of the Lords
might, and be ye tender affectionated one toward another, for an unspeakable
necessity I see in the Light of the Lord of your being tender one over another,
that you may be a comfort and a refreshing one to another in the Lord, in your
several Counties, Meetings and Families, where you are dispersed and scattered
abroad in the Nation and Nations, as lights in the World.

And Friends, beware of giving place to that which would gender strife among
your selves, and bring you into varience one with another, for that spirit is
not of God but of the World, and that will not easily pass by offenses, but
will both give them and take them, neither will that bind up breaches, but make
them worse, neither will that edify the body, but will bring suffering upon
it, and the suffering which that spirit brings upon it, is more intolerable
for the body then the sufferings that its open adversaries brings upon it, for
it will rejoice in the failings of the weak, and it will be lifted up when the
Righteous are cast down, and will look more at the failings of others, then at
its own; Now my advise to you is, to beware of it and watch vigilently against
it, as against one of your greatest and subtilest enemies of your souls and
eternal peace.

And Friends, you that are dispersed abroad in sundry parts of the Counties,
and it may be, are not above two or three Families in a Parish; and
paradventure some of the family are friends, and some are not; Therefore you
had need to be vigilent and circumspect; and also beware of letting in the
spirits of them that are of another spirit then that which you are of, lest
thereby you loose your Authority and Dominion over them, and so bring trouble
upon your selves, which may easily befall you, if you be too intimate and
familiar with them.

Again, you had need to watch over one another in tender love for good, that if
you see evil appearing in one another, you may betimes mind one another of it,
though I know it will be a greater cross to you to speak to the party that is
guilty, then it would be for you to speak to another of the thing, and when
they come to hear of your acquainting others, with that which concerned them,
and you not minding them of the thing before, hence may prejudice arise.

Which when this is gotten up, they in whom it is seated will strive to beget
it in others against such as they have prejudice against, and this will tend
rather to the making of parties then unto peace; Therefore be advised (Oh!
friends) to take heed of that, and I beseech you in the bowels of love, be
persuaded to live in love, peace and unity one with another, and be ye good
paterns and examples one to another in all things, least that you should bring
burdens upon one another, which (the Lord knows) you had not need to do, for
I know all of you in your several places wherein you are set, who are truly
under the yoke have much to bear already, so that there is more necessity for
your bearing ^ne another burden then there is for your adding unto one
another burden. Therefore keep t^ the life in your selves, that in the love
which bears all things you may be comprehended more and more.

And all you who are Rulers of Families, who have the oversight both of
children and servants, be ye Paterns of love, of meekness and wisdom, of
diligence and long-suffering, that so your Families may be brought into these
things, to the praise of God, and to your comfort; And beware of tollerating
any evil vice in your families, by giving too much liberty to that which would
be Idle, Wanton, and Extravagant; Oh! let not that be nourished neither in
children nor servant, but stand you in power of God, that his living witness
may answer all your words and actions, and justify you in them all then will
you be at error to that in your families which would work wickedness, and a
praise to that which breaths after the Lord.

And you that have unbelieving Wives or unbelieving Husbands, unbelieving
Children, and such servants in your families as are out of the Truth, walk
wisely toward them in all things; And strive not with them in your wills in
that nature which they are in, least you hurt your selves thereby and harden
them; And know this, that such will sooner be won to the truth by your Loving
and Courteous behavior toward them, then they will by your striving with them
in the heat of your spirits; and when you feel indignation arise in your hearts
against their Uncleanness, Rudeness, and Wantonness, and so upon the feeling
of that may fall a threshing and judging that in them which the indignation in
you rises against; then take heed of a mixture, I mean of that which is hasty,
and forward in your selves, mixing it self with the godly zeal in you, and that
may kindle a strange fire in them, which will not consume that which the Lords
indignation burns against, but will rather set their whole course of nature on
fire, and then you may show more wisdom in your forbearing to strive with them,
till that be somewhat over, then you would by your continuing beating and
threshing that which is not capable of your judgment; for this I have observed
(to wit) that the truth of God has much more place in a man, if it be spoken
to him when he is calm, temperate and patient, then it has if it be declared
to him when he is roufe, boisterous and passionate, which naturally many men
are subject to upon provocation, as we our selves heretofore have been, when we
were where they are; therefore let us the rather bear with them, considering
how our Lord and Savior has born with us, who have obtained mercy from him,
Glory, Honor and Renown be to his Name for ever and ever.

And Oh ye Children and Servants! be subject and obedient unto your Parents and
Superiors in the Lord, and be not froward and perverse, wilful, nor obstinate,
but dutiful and submissive, tractable and condescending to every of their equal
and just requirings, that there may be no varience, strife, emulation nor
contention in your families, but that love and peace may abound among you all;
And see that you flee and avoid all youthful lusts, and that you put away
childishness, and become grave, sober, and discreet, daily provoking one
another to love and to good works, and not to lightness nor wantonness, nor to
folly and vanity which does not become Saints; And withal be ye persuaded and
advised to dwell together in unity, love and peace, and be ye helpful one to
another in what you may; And thereby engage you one another in love to serve
one another, and thereby you will come to be indeared one unto another, and so
will come to be refreshed together with the sweet sincere milk of the Word of
life from the breasts of consolation.

Moreover Friends, as touching your meetings, let them be kept duly and
orderly (while you may) in the Wisdom and Counsel of the Lord, and observe the
time that is appointed for friends to meet, that it may no longer be observed
by friends, that it is oftentimes an hour or two, after the time appointed
before friends be wholly gathered, this ought not to be, for several
inconveniences attends this neglect, wherefore from henceforth (Oh friends!) be
persuaded and advised to amend it.

These things were upon me to lay before you, Oh! my dearly beloved, to whom my
heart is open, and often does my life extend it self from Sea to Sea to meet
you, and dearly to falute you in the bowels of entire love, which full often
yearns toward you; Oh! you fairest and dearest of all the Families of the
Earth, God Almighty multiply his peace among you, and with his living presence
perpetually accompany you, so shall all Nations call you blessed; Farewell in
the Lord from henceforth and for evermore.

Let this be read in your meetings and Families, when you see a service for it.
