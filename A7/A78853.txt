HIS MAJESTY'S LETTER IANVARY the 24th. IN ANSWER TO THE PETITION OF BOTH
HOUSES Of Parliament, as it was presented by the Earl of Newport, and the Lord
Seymer. Ian. 21. 1641.
HIs Majesty having seen and considered the Petition presented unto Him, the
one and twentieth of this instant, by the Earl of Newport, and the Lord
Seymer, in the names of both Houses of Parliament. Is pleased to return this
Answer. That He does well approve of the desire of both Houses, for the speedy
proceeding against the persons mentioned in the Petition; wherein His Majesty
finding the great inconveniences by the first mistake in the way, has endured
some delays, that He might be informed in what Order to put the same; But
before that that be agreed upon, His Majesty thinks it unusual, or unfit to
discover what proof is against them, and therefore holds it necessary, lest a
new mistake should breed more delays; (which His Majesty to His power will
avoid.) That it be resolved whether His Majesty be bound in respect of
privileges to proceed against them by impeachment in Parliament; Or whether He
be at liberty to prefer an Indictment at the Common Law, in the usual way, or
have His choice of either: VVhereupon His Majesty will give such speedy
directions for the prosecution, as shall show His Majesty's desire to satisfy
both Houses, and to put a determination to the business.

London Printed for HENRY TWYFORD. 1641
