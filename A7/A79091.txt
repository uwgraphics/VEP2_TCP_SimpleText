HIS MAJESTY'S SPEECH
At Shrewsbury, on Michaelmas Eve last, to the Gentry and Commons of the County
of Salop, there Assembled. October: 6 1642
Gentlemen,
IT, is some benefit to me from the Insolences, and misfortunes which have
driven me about, that they have brought me to so good a part of my Kingdom,
and to so faithful a part of my people; I hope neither you nor I shall repent
my coming hither, I will do my part that you may not: And of you, I was
confident before I came; the residence of an Army is not usually pleasant to
any place, and mine may carry more fear with it, since it may be thought
(being Robbed and spoiled of all my own, and such terror used to fright and
keep all men from supplying me) I must only live upon the aid and relief of
my people; but be not afraid, I would to God my poor Subjects suffered no
more by the Insolence and violence of that Army raised against me (though they
have made themselves wanton even with plenty) then you shall do by mine, and
yet I fear I cannot prevent all disorders; I will do my best; and this I Will
promise you, no man shall be a loser by me if I can help it; I have sent
hither for a Mint, and will melt down all my own Plate, and expose my Land to
sale or morgage, that if it be possible I may bring the least pressure upon
you. In the mean time I have Summoned you hither to invite you to do that for
me and your selves, for the maintenance of your Religion, the law of the Land
(by which you enjoy all that you have) which other men do against Us: Do not
suffer so good a cause to be lost for want of supplying me with that, which
will be taken from you by those who pursue me with this violence, and whilst
these ill men sacrifise their Money, Plate, and utmost industry to destroy the
Commonwealth, be you no less liberal to preserve it. And assure your selves
if it please God to bless me with success, I shall remember the particular
assistance every man here gives me, to his advantage; However, it will
hereafter (how furiously the minds of men are now possessed) be honor and
comfort to you, that with some charge and trouble to your selves, you did your
part to support your King, and preserve the Kingdom.

I desire M. Sheriff, and the rest of the Gentlemen, to distribute themselves
in that Method, that they may best receive the expressions which you shall make
of your best affections, the which I will have particularly presented to me.
