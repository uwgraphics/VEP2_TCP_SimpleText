A Brief and exact Treatise, declaring how the Sheriffs and all other the
great Officers of this Kingdom have been anciently elected and chosen.
I Conceive that by the ancient frame and constitution of this Kingdom, all
Officers were chosen by the people, over whom they had Jurisdiction; and that
they had such to govern them, as they most confided in; And an Office is but a
trust committed to certain Persons, for their orderly and peaceable
government, and securing them in their persons and estates from violence and
wrong, as appears by the ensuing particulars.

1. Officers of a Tithing, as (anciently) of ten families, were chosen, by the
Inhabitants of the Tithing only, and by no other; and was by them presented (as
their pledge and ruler) unto the Leete to be sworn, to the due execution of
his office within his Tithing.

Constables were in former times (as yet are in most places) chosen by the
persons over whom he was to exercise his Jurisdiction, whether it were of a
particular Town, or Parish, and they presented him to the hundred Court, or
Leete, where he was sworn to execute his Office, within the precinct of his
Jurisdiction.

The Coronner was and is an office whose Jurisdiction was of a larger extent,
for it extends over the whole County; and therefore he is chosen by the
Freeholders of the County, and sworn in the County Court, upon a Writ de
coronatore eligendo. Fitz. not. br.

The Sheriff also being an Officer of the County, was in former times also
chosen in the County Court, as appears by Lambert in his Saxon Laws Fol.
136. and Stat. 28. Ed. 1. Cap. 8.13. and afterward taken from them, and given
to the King, by Stat. 9. Ed. 2.

There was also in former times other Officers chosen in every County, by the
people of the County, to see the great Charter of 9. H. 3. duly observed, and
to punish such as went against the same in any point, as appears by Stat. 28.
Ed. 1. Cap. 1. who were also to enquire of, and punish such, as offended
against Stat. of Winch. An. 13. Ed. 1. as appears by Stat. 28. Ed. 1. Cap. 17.

The Lieutenant of every County in former times known by the name of Heretoch,
who had the Militia of the County committed to his charge. This Officer also
was chosen by the Inhabitants of the County (or as some conceive by the
Parliament) as appears in Lamb. Saxon Laws Fol. 136.

Mayors and Bailiffs of Towns Corporate, are chosen by their Corporations, and
so continue to this day.

Knights. of the Parliament are chosen by the Freeholders of the County for
whom they serve, Stat. 7. H. 4. Cap. 15. Stat. 1. H. 5. Cap. 1. Stat. 8. H. 6.
Cap. 7. Stat. 10. H. 6.2.

It seems also that the great Officers of the Kingdom, whose Jurisdiction
extended over the whole Realm, were under the same rule, as the Lord
Chancellor, who has the custody of the great Seal of England (being the
public Faith of the Kingdom) and being an Officer over the whole Realm, was
in former times chosen in Parliament. Lamb. Archdion. page 48. Daniels
Chronicl; page 139. 148. 195. The life of H. 3. page. 22.

The chief Justice being a public Officer, unto whom the Justice of the
whole Kingdom, in matters cryminall was committed of trust, was also chosen by
the Parliament, as appears by the places before quoted.

The Lord Admiral, to whose care the defense of the Kingdom by Sea was
committed, was in ancient times chosen in Parliament, as is expressed in the
Parliament of Rich. 2. and Seldens mare clausaum page 169. 186. 188. compared
with Lambb. Saxon Laws; Foll. 136.

The Lord Treasurer, to whom the Treasure of the Kingdom was committed, was
also chosen in Parl. L. Ar. page 48. Dan. Chr. page 139. 195.

The Captain of Callis, Rich. Earl of Warwick in time of H. 6. refused to
give up his Captainship of Callis unto the KING, being required, because (as he
says) he received the same in Parl. and was to resign it to them again.
Cowells interpreter, in the word Parliament.

Anno 15. Ed. 3. the KING was Petitioned in Parl. that the high Officers of the
Kingdom might (as in former times) be elected in Parl. to which the KING
yielded, that they should be sworn in Parl. Dan. Chr. page 195. see the
Petitioners of Parl. de anno 15. Ed. 3.

The King himself cannot give away his Kingdom, because of the Interest which
the Subjects has in it, as was resolved in KING John's case, Davies Reports
fol. 94. Rot. Parliament. 40. Ed. 3.11.7.8. neither could he give away his
title to Scotland, though not in his actual possession, as was resolved 1. H.
7. fol. 10.

The KING cannot by will give away the goods of the Crown, in case he makes
executors by his Will, but shall remain to the Crown, and go to his
Successors. Cook lib. 11. fol. 91.92. Neither can the KING Issue his treasure
without warrant under the great seal, or privy seal; Cook lib. 11. fol. 91.
Br. prerogative 5.35. H. 6.25. The KING cannot release the fealty of his
Subjects 8. H. 7. fol. 12.13.

The KING cannot grant away his prerogative, as to give power to another to
pardon Fellons, because of the trust between him and the Subject, 20. H. 7.
fell. 6. or to make a Justice of Record, or to make Denizens Ibid.

The KING cannot pardon a common Nuisance, because of the Interest of the
people, Br. Nuisance 15. 11. H. 7. fol. 20. 35. H. 6. fol. 29. b.

There is a league between the KING and his Subjects, 20. H. 7. fol. 8. The
KING cannot arrest a man, upon suspicion of Felony or Treason, because the
party cannot have his action against him for it, Br. prerogative 139. 1. H. 7.
fol. 4. 22. H. 1. 6. fol. 46. p. Newton.

The KING cannot dispense with a Stattute which does ordain Law, 8. H. 6. fol.
21. Cooks institutes fol. 120.234.

If the KING command a thing not warrantable, it is as if they had no command;
Dyer. 13. Eliz. fol. 297. Dyer fol. 175. pl. 26. snaggs case.

The KING cannot by his Charter, Out the common people of their Rights of
Inheritance, which they have in the common Law; Stat. 27. H. 8. Cap. 26. 19. H.
6. fol. 63. Plod. Com. 55.120. b.
