THE CASE Of the Captains of his Majesty's Fleet humbly offered to the
Honorable House of Commons.
It being generally believed, that the Captains who have served in his
Majesty's Ships, during the late War with France, have been rewarded extra for
their Service by double Pay, which on the contrary is of Loss to the said
Captains, and a considerable Sum saved to the Nation.
l. s. d. A Captain of a 1st Rate having 754 Men allowed him, his former pay
was 21 00 00 per M. His Allowance of Servants being one to every 20 Men is 33
06 00 per M. which amounts to 54 06 00 per M. The double Pay is 42 00 00 per M.
His Servants now allowed being 8, is 07 04 00 per M. The Allowance with double
Pay 49 04 00 per M. So the Captain of a first Rate has less than formerly 05 02
00 per M. Saved to the Nation by the Servants Provisions and Deductions from
the Captains Pay 36 11 00 per M. A Captain of a 2d Rate's former Pay having 640
Men was 17 10 00 per M. His Allowance of Servants being 32 comes to 27 16 00
per M. Which comes to 45 06 00 per M. The double Pay is 35 00 00 per M.
Servants now allowed being 8, is 07 04 00 per M. The Allowance with Pay doubled
is 42 04 00 per M. The Captain of a second Rate has less than formerly 03 02 00
per M. Saved by the Servants Provisions and Deductions from the Captains Pay 31
14 00 per M. A Captain of a third Rate having 476 Men his former Pay was 14 00
00 per M. (...) being ^^ comes to 20 00 00 per M. A Captain of a 2d Rate's
former Pay having 640 Men was 17 10 00 per M. His Allowance of Servants being
32 comes to 27 16 00 per M. Which comes to 45 06 00 per M. The double Pay is 35
00 00 per M. Servants now allowed being 8, is 07 04 00 per M. The Allowance
with Pay doubled is 42 04 00 per M. The Captain of a second Rate has less than
formerly 03 02 00 per M. Saved by the Servants Provisions and Deductions from
the Captains Pay 31 14 00 per M. A Captain of a third Rate having 476 Men his
former Pay was 14 00 00 per M. His Allowance of Servants being 23 comes to 20
00 00 per M. which is 34 00 00 per M. The double Pay is 28 00 00 per M.
Servants now allowed being 6 comes to 05 08 00 per M. The Allowance with double
Pay 33 08 00 per M. The Captain of a third Rate has less than formerly 00 12 00
per M. Saved by the Servants Provisions and Deductions from the Captains Pay 20
01 00 per M. Saved to the Nation out of every 1st. Rate 36 11 00 per M. Saved
to the Nation out of every 2d. Rate 31 14 00 per M. Saved to the Nation out of
every 3d. Rate 20 01 00 per M. In all 88 06 00 per M.

And so proportionably for the rest of the Navy, which amounts to considerably
more than the half Pay desired to be established.

And it appearing by the foregoing Scheme, that what his Majesty was pleased to
design as encouragement to the said Officers, has been detrimental, yet they
were easy under it, in expectation of the promised Benefit of half Pay whilst
out of Employment; and it is hoped this Honorable House will take their Case
into their most mature Consideration, and do (as they always have) promote the
Honor of his Majesty, the Good of their Country, and Welfare of those who have
ventured their Lives to make this Kingdom Happy; which the preserving of
Officers to serve upon any Emergency will undoubtedly do, especially if it be
considered how fatal the want of them was likely to be in the beginning of the
late War, and the encouragement given in Peace to other Captains abroad.
