The XIII. Chap.
A Dialogue / between the Father reversed;or Oldest-elder; of the Famelye of
Love / and his obedient Son reversed;or Disciple; in the godly Wisdom.
Wherein there are many special Questions / by the Son / and many groundlie
Resolutions and Instructions / by the Father / contained and declared.

The Son.
SEeinge now that I have heard many good Documentes reversed;that do
demonstrate to the true Life and Godliness; Eccli. 4. a 6. c
submit myself under my Fathers Doctrine / live according to his Counsel /
take-heede to his Instruction / and order and apply me thereafter / To the end
that I ouershoote not myself / in my young-alge / nor beco^ Luke 15. b
deceived by my young Understanding nor-yet seduced by any Romans 12. b
Self-wisedom / Ier. 7. c
Goodthinking / or Imagination of the Knowledge.

2. For-that-cause reversed;O my Father in the Love; I submiet my-self (and
wholly geeue-ouer myself and all mine Understanding) under the Wisdom of thy
Doctrine: and desire to demand of thee / my Father / also to hear / and to
answer thee: and to live and walk obedientlie / according to all thy Pro. 1.
a
Counsel / in the Nowse of Love.

The Father.
3. O My Son reversed;my Beloved in the Love; stands thine Heart Pro. 2. a
4. a
inclyned to the Wisdom / and is thy Lust bent / to the holy Understanding /
for to live and walk vprightlie in the House of Love: then speake-on reversed;
my Son; / and demand all that wherein thou desire to be instructed: And
there shall good Instruction be geeuen thee thereof / according to the godly
Wisdom / and the Declaration of all that whereof thou demaundest me / shall
reversed;out of the Wisdom; become opened unto thee.

The Son.
4. FIrst-of-all reversed;my Father; my Demand is to thee: Whether it be
permitted / and requisite either beseeming / for Me reversed;and all Disciples
and Littleons of Understanding; / to demand the Eldest in the holy
Understanding reversed;or the Father of the Famelye of Love; of all Things /
for to know the difference thereof / and to require of him / to be instructed
and resolved in the same: For many suppose / that to know the Difference of
all things / is the right Knowledge of the Wisdom?

The Father.
5. Eccli. 24. b
of the Mosthighest; geeue thee good Instruction. and declare unto thee
reversed;according to the Truth; the right Difference / out of what manner of
mind and Intent / that it is permitted the Disciples and Littleons of
Understanding / and also very meet or requisite for them / to demand for the
Resolution and Instruction in the Wisdom: and in what maner-of-wise / they
ought to submitt and behave them / toward the Eldest in the Love / of whom
they require the holy Understanding / for to become rightly taught and
^^structed / in the godly Sap. 7. c Iam. 3. b
Wisdom.

6. BErelye / to know the Difference of all Things / is no right 1. Cor. 8. a
Knowledge of the godly Wisdom: but the Love reversed;with her vericous Nature
and Beeinge; is the upright Wisdom of the godly Knowledge:

7. And whosoever is taught to the same / or has inherited the same / in her
Service reversed;as that She be planted in him with Iam. 1. c
Meekmyndednes; / He has the right Knowledge of the true Wisdom / and the
mostholie Understanding: and is a Fellowe-elder and Father in the House of
Love / which bringeth-fourth reversed;out of the Treasure Mat. 13. f
of his Heart; the upright Instruction of the Wisdom.

8. Seeing then that thou demaundest of me / whether it be permitted the
Disciples / to demand the Eldest in the godly Wisdom / of all Things / for
to know the Difference thereof / and to require Instruction therein / of him /
So geeue-eare then and understand / how they all which are year young in the
holy Understanding / and desire to demand the Eldest in the godly Wisdom /
for to be instructed and resolved in all things / ought to stand-minded: and
in what-maner of wise also / that they reversed; with their Hearts; ought to
submitt them to the Eldest.

9. Iam. 1. b
Disciples of the gracious Word and his Service of Love / and that they Reb.
12. a 1. Pet. 2. a
turn them away eaue^ so reversed;according to the Requiring of the gracious
Word and his Service; from al their 1. Cor. 3. c

take nothing in-hand them selves / out of their own Counsel: nor-yet
stand-perswaded / that they the^ selves reversed;before their new John. 3. a
Birth out of the Doctrine and Spirit of the gracious Word; know Gal. 6. a
anye-thing / nether-yet can reversed;according to the Truth; 1. Cor. 8. a

10. Secondly / it behooves / that all their Minder Will / and Meaning stand

know the same) but only this / namely / Which are the upright Ways of the
Lord Eccli. 2. a 3.5.

11. Thirdly / they ought to beware / that they distrust Deu. 17. b 13 a
not the Eldest in the Famelie of Love / nor suspect any-maner of evil or
vnwisedom by him: nor-yet also in anywise persuade themselves / that the

13. Behold and mark this well / my Sons In such a State / Mind / and Will

/ together with all Goodwissingons to the Righteousness / to demand and hear
the Eldest the Father of the Famelie of Love and to require the good

13. For that there are many / which do both suppose and also say / that they
have the Mat. 24. c

and yet have not their communion / with our Co^munialtie of the Love / Whereby

reversed;the True / in His Form / and the False / in His Form;: and
where-out ether-other proceeds or has his Original? To the end that I
reversed;O my Father; and all that hear thee / may understand the Difference
betwirt the true and the false Light / and so followe-after the true Light?

The Father.
14. THe Difference betwixt the True and False Light / and from Whence
ether-other proceeds / we have largelye reversed;with full Resolution and
clear Distinction; witnessed and declared in the 4. Gla. 4.
Glass of Righteousness / and in the spiritual Land of Promise / or heavenly
Io rusalem. But seeing now that it falleth-out at this present in our
Communication / to speak thereof / therefore I will reversed;briefly; witness
and declare also the Truth thereof / unto thee:

The XV. Chap.
THe true John. 1. a 17.
Light (understand it / my Soune) is the everlasting Life itself: John. 1. a
a Light of Men / to the Presernation in the Godlynes / of all such as believe
therein.

2. Thissame true Light / Pro. 8. c Eccli. 24. b John. 1. a
has his Original or Fourth-cominge out of the lovely Beeinge / and true
Mind of the eternal and lininge God: and therefore it is also the eternal
Life itself.

3. This true Light and eternal Life / brings with him the Heb. 5. a
Mercye-seate of the kingelie Malestie reversed;which is / 1. John. 4. a 5.
God / Christ / and the Holycoste itself; / also all spiritual Treasures Col.
2. a
and heavenly Riches / and all Love and Peace / in the Godlynes.

4. And eauen so reversed; out of this high Majesty of God; does this true
Light shewe-fourth his Service / through the illuminated Act. 2.3.4.5 6. etc.
2. Cor. 4. a 2. Pet. 1. b 1. John. 1. a
or godded Man / with whom the Most-highest reversed;through the selfsame Light
and his Service; is also manned: Witnessinge and declaringe / how that the true
Light / consists not in the knowinge of This or That. but is an upright and
true Beeinge of God John. 17. c
/ and his eternal Life.

5. Whosoever now therefore reversed;through the Service of the holy and
gracious Word; becomes comprehended of this true Light / in the Love / and
in the Obedience of her Service / and is growen-vpp eauen so therein / till unto
the manlye Ephe. 4. b
Oldnes of Christ and Mat. 13. f
taught in such-sort to the Kingdom of Heaven / He ministreth-fourth then the
same / according to the true Beeinge.

6. Not reversed;verelye; for that anyman should have onite the Knowledge
thereof: but that they all reversed;which hear / believe / and are obedient to
the Service of the holy Word; might become 2. Pet. 1. a
partakers reversed; Ephe. 4. c
in the Renewinge of their Spirit and Mind; of the same true John. 1. a 3. c.
8. b. 12. d

incorporated reversed;with their inward Man's unto the same. and that they
should eauen so live and walk in the same 1. John 1. a 2.
Light / in all Love.

7. But / the False Light / is the Imagination of the Knowledge or the Riches
Genesis 3. a
of the Knoweledge itself / which men reversed;out of their Ingeniousues or
Humaine-prudentie; take unto them / ere-euer that they have been obedient unto
/ and fulfilled reversed;til-vnto the second Birth Romans 6. a
from the Dead; the holy and gracious Word / in the Service of his foregoing
Testament. With which false Light / all wicked Nature / and all goodthinkinge
Men and false Hearts of the Seripturelearned and Ier. 14. b 33. c
unsent Preachers / together with such as turn them away from the true
Doctrine / seruinge to the Unity of the Heart in the Love / and eauen so
take-on the false Light / or geeue-fourth themselves through the same / to be
Teachers and Ministers of the Word / or to be esteemed and heard for Such /
have in all ayges Mat. 21. d 26. Act. 21. d 24.25
persecuted the Vpright-heartes. belyed and defamed them with false matters.
yea / and also judged Sap. 2. b Act. 3. b. 7. f
or condemned them for Seducers and wicked Men.

8. Seeinge then that the false Light / has not his Ministration unto the
second Birth or Renewings of the Life / for to live and walk reversed;with an
upright Heart and a meckeminded Spirit; in all Love and Concord: and that it
brings with it / all Presumpieous-boldnes and Lies / and all Infamye /
Sclaunder and Contempt / over the upright Hearts / Therfort do all false
Hearts and unregenerated Ier. 6. b 8. a
Seripturelearned; which are arrogant and proud / in these mind of the own
Wisdom; / and all such / as reversed;with an unrenewed Heart / and false Col.
2. c
Holiness / or show of God service; administer the ceremony Services therout /
and set-forwarde or maintain the same in Dissension / gladly take-on and
embrace the same: and also busily apply them ther-in / with a fervent zeal
nearnestnes. For ther-vnder they can best-of-all reversed;before all vnlighted
People; cover their wicked Nature / Mat. 23. c
and the falshod of their Hearts: and get the Mat. 6. a 23. a
Estimacion at men's hands / that they have the right Doctrine / and that they
do no wrouge / in their Persecution / Sciaunder / and Lies or Euel-speakinge
against the Vpright-of-heare.

9. But they will not humble themselves obedientlie unto the true John. 3. c
Light / nor-yet by Those / where through The same and his upright Doctrine
becomes administered / under the Obedience of the Love: but John. 7. a 15. b
hate the true Light / and also the upright Doctrine / that becomes taught out
of the same. And for this cause they hate the true Light / and the godly
Service of his Docirine / namely: because their wicked Hearts become John. 3. c
chastised ther-by and their ungodly Works and false Witnessinges
made-knowen unto them. and also / for that they are Ier. 23. c
not sent of God / for to teach.

10. WHeare now therefore thissame Riches Ier. 8. a. 23. c d.
of the Knowledge (above rehearsed) is talgninge. Ezech. 13. b
of the true Wisdom: and that also any Service of the Word / becomes
setfourth and administered by them / for an holy Word many Service / for a
right God service / theare is then the same Ministration false: For it
stretches no farther / but to the breedinge of Mat. 24. a 2. Cor. 3. a (...) 3.
b
Schysme / Parcialitie and Sedition among the People: Where through each Sece
or Congregation / or the vnilluminated unsent Teachers of the same / busye and

Nature or Mind is full of Iniquitye / and full of all false Witnessyuges /
against Gods gracious Word / and his Ministers: and they are not eis-what /
but a Nest of Deueis / and of all wicked Spirits.

11. Therefore suerly / the Riches of the Knowledge reversed;in all false Hearts
of the Scripture-learned / and in all presumpteous or arrogant Self-wise; is
the false Spirit 1. (...) 4. b

12. Seeing now then that it all is nothinge-els but Knowledge / and a painted

Falshod and Deceit becomes in^^^^ mixed / among the Children of Men. and the

The XVI. Chap.
The Father.
THe false Freedom of the false Light / is this: Genesis 3. a 1. Cor. 8. a
Knowledge / and will likewise reversed;out of his Knowledge; make himself holy
and righteous: and so persuade himself / that the Riches of the Knowledge / is
the Wisdom of God itself. Wher-with he supposes / to have / to know / and to
inherit / all what is needful for him / and that he lacks not anything
more. Wherthrough he siueth freemindedlie reversed;out of his Knowledge; in
all thing to that he uses. But it is all false and a mere dece^^ For the
false Rom 2. c Apo. 2. b
Light [the which is the Imagination of the Knowledg] has seduced his Heart /
to the Applisement on the Knowledge / and so begyled him.

2. Out of thissame Appaisement of the Heart on the Knowledge / there arises
manye-maner of false Dealinges: as also certain false Mat. 15. a 21.22.23 2.
Tim. 3. a
Exercises or Vsa^es / which bear a good Show / wherewith many ignorant People
reversed;that know not any Difference / betwirt the True and the False Light;
2. Pet. 2.23. a
become seduced and deceived.

3. For certain take-in-hand and use / out of the Inagination of the Knowledge
reversed;whereon they set their hearies at peace; false God-seruices Col. 2. b o
/ which they notwithstanding institute or bring-in / for true Godseruices /
Religions / Laws / and Commandments of God: and plant the same Knowledge /
into the People / As-though they ought reversed;of right; to be oxdient
thereunto.

4. Certain other bring-fourth reversed;out of the Freemindenes of their Heart;

The-same / (...) Ezech. 13. b Mat. 24. c

same unto them / and that ^^y are the Testimonies of the holse Ghost.

5. Again / certain Other (whilst that they per^^ade themselves / that the
Knowledge / is the John. 8. d
Truth / which makes them free) suppose (because they now know much / and
that the Knowledge does daily ima^he much in the^) that it is the Spirit of
Truth / that ^^ueth or leads them into such an high Vnderstan^^ge 2. Tim. 3.
a Tit. 1. b
of Much Knowledge: and that they far excel est simple People. Wherthrough
certain 2. Pet. 2. b. ludae. 1. b.
take-occasion to boste them of the Freedom: and affirm that it is all free
to them / and lawful for them / to dease-in and use what they will / and what
pleases themselves.

6. Heer-out now there becomes the tradinge or iuuringe of many-maner of false
and inordinate Freedoms / taken-ourwhich accord not / nor yet are
dealtwith-all / by the Children of God. But with these false Freedoms / the Man
deceaueth himself / and 2. Tim. 3 a 2. Pet. 2. a
seditceth or deceaueth also all them that hear / believe / and follow him.

therout.

8. Oh what shall I say more unto thee heerof reversed;my Son; but that thou
apply chee always obediently / to the Requiringe of the gracious Word and
of his Service of Love / and followe-after the Counsel of the godly Pro.
1.2.3.4.
Wisdom: and that thou Rob. 4. b
have a sharpt regard for falling reversed;into the danger of the false
Freedoms / which are so many and manyfolde. For there are Many seduced and
deceived / that tooke-on reversed;out of the Imagination of the Knowledge; a
Freedom to themselves: which could not become made-free by the Truth / nor by
the true Light / Because they rose-vpp John. 10. b
before thissame true Light of the Love or / er-euer they were implanted
obedientlye / to the gracious Word in his Service: and so took to them the
false Freedom / out of the false Light / as also bosted and set-fourth
themselves to be free Mat. 14. a
Christians or free Children of God.

9. Therefore / the holy nor the mostholie / the true nor the most-true Light
(Which the Most-highest has presently reversed;in his mostholie Service under
the Obedience of the Love; geeuen unto us / for to be declared-fourth) has
Heb. 9. b 10. ^

must yeat demand somewhat of (...) / To thend that I may submit myself so-much^
more vprightlie / according to the upright Truth:

12. Wherefore reversed;my Father; termest thou this also a false Freedom
[to-weet] to sett-fourth Godseruices / Religions / and Doctrines / out of the

false Freedoms more / but the inordinate and false Vsages or Doings / which
become taken-on and used reversed;according to the Sap. 14. c Romans 1. ^
