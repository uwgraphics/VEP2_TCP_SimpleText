Loves up to the elbowes.
To the tune of Codlings.




YOu men that loving be, love not too fondly,
Let still your mind live free, yet use them kindly.
Use not in love excess,
For here I will express
I am in love no less
then up to the elbowes.
^spide a dainty Dame of fairest feature
^he was of natures frame a comely creature,
Her beauty did excel,
And her sight pleased me well
With her in lou^ (...) fell
up ^o the elbowes.
Often have I meet this maid yet near spoke to her,
Bashfulnes did persuade, I should not woo her,
Still this most beauteous prize
So dazeled mine eyes,
I fell in woeful wise
in love to the elbowes.
Once at a Wake I met my lovely sweeting
When I did clean forget the use of greeting,
She merry made with Ale,
Whose acquaintance was but small,
In love (...) further fall
up to the elbowes
Dancing upon a Green next time I spide her,
She seemed like Flora's Queen all th'time I eyed her
Such frolic roundelaies
She danst to win the Baies
I fell: while she got the praise
in love to the elbowes.
Trasing the fragrant fields one morning early,
To see what nature yeeldes, Wheat Rye and barley,
A milking I did find
This maid of Venus kind
Fate has my love assignde*
up to the elbowes.
Selling of Apricokes I spide her standing
Laid out with golden locks my heart commanding
I cheapned her ware
It looked so passing fair
But her looks cast care on care
being up to the elbowes.
Once I occasion took to speak unto her,
Such was her Beauteous look I feign would woo her
But speech was spent in vain
Such words of coy disdain
From her: my heart has slain
being up to the elbowes.
The second part.
To the same tune.




ONce at a marriage feast we dinde together,
I viewed her among the rest though minds did souer
I feasted on her sight
She would not looks requite
Yet still I took delight
being up to the elbowes.
Like Helens is her face with Golden tresses,
Which shows such splendant grace like young Narcissus
Her eyes like Lamps do shine
Her looks are so Divine
She does my love confine
up to the elbowes
Her pretty Dimple Chin, Cheeks red as Cheries
Her neck like Iuory thin with Amber Berries
Wast short and body tall
And fingers long and small
Forced me in love to fall
up to the elbowes.
From wast unto the foot complete of nature
None sees but still does praise this comely creature
Did face and mind agree
She then would pity me
That by loves cruelty
am up to the elbowes.
Once more I Would court this dame but am asham(...)
And by my rash attempt I might be blamed
My loving heart does ache
For my fair Mistress sake
What course should lovers take
being up to the elbowes.
I have seen lovers pine for such like crosses,
I have seen lovers die for such like losses
But in extremes of woe
I neeuer yet (...) know
In love, a young man so
up to the elbowes.
Will man that is a man be slaued by woman
But it is a fault in man grown too too comme
To love, yet love in vain
And be not beloved again
I plungd am in loves pain
up to the elbowes.
Vanish all fearful fear I will unto her
Vanish al careful care for I must woo her
If we can well agree
And she can fancy me
No longer love shall be
up to the elbowes.
FINIS.
