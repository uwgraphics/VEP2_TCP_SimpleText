The Citizens Vindication Against the Down right ^ountrey-man. (alias Boobee)
Let Rusticks spit their V^nome still,
Against the Dames of London,
^

T^ (...)










What silly senseless Country Clown
has put this wit in Print?
To abuse the Dames of London Town
though there is nothing in t:
Only to show his apishness,
and prove himself an Ass,
For all men know where e're they go.
none's like a London Lass.
Yet every Plow-boy now a days
most sawcily will prate,
And set forth Doll's and Molly's praise,
hatched in his noddle pate:
Through England, Scotland, France, and Spain
or wheresoever you pass,
You Will find all Noddy's that disdain
the gentile London Lass.
See how their Clothes do fit in Print,
and mind Joan's draggle-tayle,
See how she like a Puss does squint,
Crow^'d with her Milking-paile:
Or, if you mind how she does splay
as she goes through the Grass,
You then without all doubt will say,
give me the London Lass.
If you but walk to the Exchange,
there you may ^reatures see,
That to the Bumkins may seem strange,
they are Natures rarity.
Such in the Countries there are none,
then blame that simple Ass,
Whose folly needs he must make known,
to blame the London lass.
A Citizen an Angel seems
that in the Country goes,
All men their Company esteems
that any breeding knows:
While Tom and Robin stands and stares
to see them as they pass;
For in this Land there is none compares
with a brisk London lass.
Besides the bonny City Lads
like Gentlemen do go,
While Country Bumkins ride on Pads
say nothing but gee ho,
Instead of Leather-bottles, they
to the Tavern post with speed,
And merrily pass the time away:
these are brave boys indeed.
While Citizens in Coaches ride
the Bumkin rides in's Cart,
And there he sits puffed up with Pride,
though he is not worth a f -- -
And if he to a Pudding gets
he Farmer like does feed,
While London Lads live by their wits,
like Gentlemen indeed.
A Whip must serve a Country Clown*
instead of Belt and Sword,
He whistling passes through the Town*
and thinks himself a Lord.
Whilst London boys, when they do meet,
full quickly are agreed
To drink a Glass of Wine that is neat,
these are brave boys indeed.
It Is true, we have some cracks in the Town,
perhaps have had a Bearn
By some lascivious Country clown
no danger could discern,
And then they up to London come
more Bastards for to breed,
Perhaps they have deluded some,
the worst of men indeed.
Match but a Bumkin to a man,
or Iuggs to London Lasses;
And then distinguish, if you can,
how Londoners surpasses:
The Rustick-bore that knows not how
for to repeat his Creed,
Knows nothing more than drive the Plow,
a gentile Curr indeed.
