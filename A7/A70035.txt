TO THE READER.
MAny and various are the opinions of Writers concerning the continuance of the
world before Christ: insomuch that it is grown into a Proverb; Chronologi non
magis congruunt, quam horologia. Victorin. Strigel. Prolegom. in Chron.
Melancth.
Chronologers agree like Clocks. Vix duos reperire licea^, qui omnibus in l^cis
inter s^ conveniant. Func. Epist. dedicat.
Scarce two of one mind throughout.

The chief and maine ground of these differences is, because most, neglecting
the Word of God, are drawn away with Fables, humane traditions, and uncertain
authorities, whereby they Vide Sleidan. de 4 sum. Imper. l. 1. Genebrard

exceed the just and true number, some forty years, some one hundred, some one
thousand, nay some two thousand years, and upwards. Others, who seem much to
follow the Scriptures, and Hebrew expositours, (unto whom Lyra annotat. in Genesis
c. 15. v. 13.
without all peradventure we ought in this point to subscribe) do indeed In
accompting Terahs age when Abraham was born; and the time of the promise to
Abraham, and the Captivity of Judah, etc.
renounce them, when there is small cause to suspect them of falsehood; and
embrace them, when we know they seek by all means to obscure the truth. As,

in beginning Daniel's 70. weeks from the first year of King Cyrus; which
Aben*Ezra, a malicious Rabbi, affirmed; not that he did so believe, (for then
he must have confessed that the Messiah was come, because he himself He
perfected his Comment on Daniel Anno Dom. 1126.
saw more then thrice 70. weeks finished) but that he might confound the
Christians account, and render them ridiculous both to the Greeks and Persians.

His design is by this computation made frustrate: All Scriptures seemingly
jarring in point of time are here reconciled; many places cleared; especially
in the Books of the Judges, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel: Prophecies are showed in their due time to be
accomplished: Christ Jesus is proved be the true Messiah; and Gal. 4. v. 4, 5.

THE SCRIPTVRES HARMONY:
Containing A brief, plain, and perfect computation of the years and times
from the Creation of Adam, unto the death and passion of our blessed Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ, according to the Scriptures;

As follows.

FRom the Creation of ADAM unto the ceasing of NOAH'S Flood, are 1656. years.
FOR,

Adam was 130 years old when he begat Seth. Genesis 5. verse. 3.


Seth at 105 years begat Enos. Verse 6.


Enos at 90 years begat Cainan. Verse 9.


Cainan at 70 years begat Mahalaleel. Verse 12.


Mahalaleel at 65 years begat Jared. Verse. 15.


Iared at 162 years begat Enoch. Verse 18.


Enoch at 65 years begat Methuselah. Verse 21.


Methuselah at 187 years begat Lamech. Verse 25.


Lamech at 182 years begat Noah. Verse 28. 29.


Noah was 600 years old when the Flood was upon Chapter 7. ver. 6.
the earth.

THE waters of the Flood began in the six C. 7. v. 10. 11. C. 8. v. 13.
hundred year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the
month, and were dried up in the six hundred and one year, in the first
month, the first day of the month. So that the Flood continued ten months
and thirteen days; which being the same with the six hundredth year of Noah,
are not to be accounted.

The said times accounted are 1656 years.

From the ceasing of NOAH 's Flood unto ABRAHAM'S departing from VR of the
Chaldees, are 362. years.
FOR,

Shem Noah's son, begat Arphaxad 2 years after Chapter 11. verse. 10.
the Flood.

Arphaxad at 35 years begat Salah. Verse 12.


Salah at 30 years begat Eber. Verse 14.


Eber at 34 years begat Peleg. Verse 16.


Peleg at 30 years begat Reu. Verse 18.


Reu at 32 years begat Serug. Verse 20.


Serug at 30 years begat Nahor. Verse 22.


Nahor at 29 years begat Terah. Genesis 11. v. 24.


Terah at 70 years begat Abraham. Verse 26.


Reasons why it cannot be admitted that TERAH begat ABRAHAM at 130. years old.
Abraham; The one before his departure out of Ur of the Chaldees; The other
after Terah's death, before his departure out of Haran: Which is a mere
conceit, and cannot be proved out of the Scriptures. For Saint Stephen by
repeating the words of Moses, Get thee out Acts 7. v. 2. 3, 4 Genesis 12. v. 1.
of thy Country, etc. shows plainly, that Moses and he did both speak of one
and the same promise, which (he expressly says) was made in Mesopotamia
(containing at that time the land of the Chaldees) before Abraham dwelt in
Charran. And indeed had Saint Stephen at that time spoken any thing differing
from Moses (though by divine revelation, yet) he Sr. W. Ral. Hist. l. 1. c. 1.
Sect. 3.
had offered the Jews, his accusers, too great an occasion of scandalizing
him, and the Gospel of Christ.

Moses, who so punctually and largely has set down the life of Abraham, did
leave out, and not at all mention the first and chief promise made by God unto
Abraham: which would savor of no less impiety then improbability.

English Translations, render not the words of Moses thus; Terah Genesis 12. v. 1.
died in Haran. And the Lord says, or, then the Lord said; but, Now the Lord
had said unto Abraham, in the Preterpluperfect Tense, showing, that the Lord
had made this promise before Terah's death, and (as Saint Stephen says) in the
land of the Chaldees. Junius and Tremelius translate it by the Preterpluperfect
Tense Dixerat enim: So Beza annot. in Act. 7. Vatahl. in a. locum.
And Vatablus a learned Hebrician confirms it, Hebraice per futurum legitur,
quod pro praeterito perfecto ponitur: and perfectum pro plusquam perfecto; Lege
Actor. caput* 7. in principio. Vertendum igitur, I am vero dixerat Dominus.

And as Gods promise, so Abraham's departure out of Haran, was also before
Terah's death. Neither does the relation of it after the death of Terah any way
hinder: For the Scriptures do frequently Judge. 10. v. 5. 6. 8. So c. 13* v. 24.
etc. 15. v. 20. compared with c. 13. v. 1. So Number. 9. v. 1. compared with c. 1.
v. 1. So Ezekiel. 26. v. 1. comp. with c. 26. v. 1. Genesis 25. 1. Genesis 2. v. 3. 22.
etc. 3. comp. with c. 1. v. 27. So Jer. 26. v. 1. compared with c 25. v. 1. So
c. 49. v. 34. compared with 2. 39. v. 1. So Dan. 7. v. 1. comp. with c. 5 v. 30.
in Story place that after, which was done before in time. As we know, that the
eighteen years wherein the Philistines and Ammonites oppressed Israel, were
in the days of Jair the Judge, yet it is said, And Jair died, and was buried
in Camon. And the children of Israel, etc. where the story of the oppression is
placed after Jairs death. So Abraham's taking another wife, is mentioned after
the death of Sarah, which was long before her death, in her time. So the
relation of the making of woman, and the fall of man follows after the seventh
day, yet we know, that both were created on the sixth day. The Prophets,
especially Jeremiah and Daniel, afford many such examples.

Stephens words, that Abraham departed not out of Haran till his fathers death:
for he says, from thence when his father was dead, (...), God transplanted
him, that is, fully and absolutely removed him into this Land, tam animo quam
corpore; Flac. Illyr. Gloss. in Act. 7. v. 4. Vide Genebrard Chronol. l. 1.
which indeed could not be before his fathers death, because of the duty and
natural affection, which he did and ought to bear unto his Father. So that he
departed thence at 75. years old, as Moses says: but was not transplanted
thence till his fathers death, as Saint Stephen says, at which time Abraham
was 135. years old.

Terah lived 70. years and begat Abraham, Genesis 11. v. 16.
Nahor, and Haran. Now if the 70. years be not referred to Abraham, then they
are inserted ambiguously, and to no purpose. Ambiguously, because it cannot be
determined whether they belong to Nahor or Haran. And to no purpose, because
what matter is it to the continuance of the Church (which was the scope of
Moses in that Chapter) to mention how old Terah was when he begat Nahor or
Haran, who were Idolaters, and not of the Church?

Abraham should beget a child at 100 years old; whereas the Scriptures record
it for an extraordinary act of Gods power, beyond the course of nature. Shall a
child (says Abraham) be Genesis 17. v. 17.
borne unto hm that is an hundred years old? Therefore C. 18. v. 11. 12.
Sarah laughed within her self, saying, After I am waxed old, shall I have
pleasure, my lord being old also? Abraham's age (as well as her own) was the
cause of Sarah's laughter. And Saint Paul says, there sprang even of one and
him as good as Heb. 11. v. 12.
dead, so many as the Stars of the sky in multitude. Nay more, He considered
not his own body now dead, when he was about 100 years old. Romans 4 v. 19.
Whence it is clear, that Abraham's strength of nature was in his hundredth
year quite spent, his body was unable to beget children; and therefore the
wonder was wrought on him, as well as on Sarah.

But in truth I cannot see, how they should account this a wonder, who give
Abraham a wife and six sons of her after Sarah's death; the eldest of whom
should we suppose that Abraham begat him Genesis 17. v. 17. compared with C. 23.
v. 1.
the same day that Sarah died, must be begotten in the 137 year of Abraham's
age: and (if some may be credited) all six were begotten in less then four
Sr. W. R. Hist. l. 1. c. 1. Sect. 4.
years. Sed ex uno absurdo mill sequuntur.

Terah begat Abraham at 70. years old. As, Joseph. Ant. l. 1. c. 7. Eusebius.
Chron. fol. 6. August. quaest. 25. in Genesis Beda de 6. aetat. mundi. Func. fol.

fol. 3. Isaacs. fol. 30.

Nevertheless Abraham was not the eldest, but the younger son of Terah, and
is placed first, because Compare Genesis 11. v. 29. with C. 17. v. 17.
of his excellency and dignity.

Abraham departed from Ur of the Chaldees when he was 70. years old.

His departure was immediately after Gods Covenant with him, Acts 7. v. 2, 3,
4. which is employed, Genesis 11. v. 31. and c. 12. v. 1. Now Gods Covenant was
when Abraham was 70. years old. For from the Covenant to the Law were 430.
years; but from the 75. of Abraham to the Law, were but Gal. 3. v. 17.
425. years; Therefore the Covenant (and so his departure out of Ur) must be
five years before, which was in his 70. year.

The said times accounted are 362 years.

From Abraham's departing from Vr of the Chaldees, unto the departing of the
children of Israel out of Egypt, are 430. years.
FOR,

Abraham going forth from Ur of the Chaldees Genesis 11. v. 31. c. 12 v. 4, 5.
Beza in Act. 7. v. 2. 4. 6.
came unto Haran, alias Charran, in Mesopotamia, where he dwelt 5 years; and
so (leaving his father Terah) was 75. years old when he departed thence into
the land of Canaan.

Note, that as in the loins of Adam all men sinned; Romans 5. v. 12. Heb. 7. v.
9. 10.
and as in the loins of Abraham the Levites paid tithes: So the children of
Israel in Abraham went forth from Genesis 12. v. 6. 9. 10.
Ur of the Chaldees toward Egypt, and passed through the land of Canaan,
journeying still toward the South, until they came into Egypt.

Isaac was borne unto Abraham when he was 100. C. 21. v. 5.
years old, and in the 25 year after his departure out of Haran.

Isaac was 60 years old when Rebekah bare C. 25. v. 26.
Jacob.

Jacob, alias Israel, went into Egypt with all Genesis 32. v. 28. C. 47. v. 9.
his family, when he was 130 years old.

The children of Israel were in Egypt 210 Joseph. ben Gorion de Stat. Macca. Et
Hebr. plerique omnes, quibus potissimum in Chronicis credendum. Lyra in Genesis 15
v. 13. Beza in Act. 7. v. 6.
years. Which was by their father Jacob Prophetically implied in this word,
Descend ye, or, Get you down; the letters whereof in Hebrew (...), signify
210. Genesis 42. v. 2.

(These 210. years may be thus set forth in particular.

Kohath with his father Levi came into Egypt: Gen 46. v. 8. 11 Exodus 6. v. 18.
unto whom Amram was borne about 60. years after.

Amram was 70. years old when Moses was C. 2. v. 1. 2. 10. C. 6. v. 20.
Epiphan. l. Ancorat.
borne unto him.

Moses was 80. years old when he conducted Compare Number. 10. v. 11. 12. etc.
13. v. 26. with Deuteronomy. 2. v. 14. etc. 34. v. 7.
the children of Israel out of Egypt.

The time of the ten plagues of Egypt is the same with the latter part of the
eightieth year of Moses, Exodus 7. verse. 7. And it is necessarily concluded
Exodus 7. v. 19. to c. 12. v. 29.
from those many testimonies of Moses his being in the Wilderness 40. years.
Wherefore Saint Stephen, Joseph. Antiqu. l. 2 c. 6.
Acts 7. v. 30. did not there intend a full and complete expiration of 40.
years, as he did before, verse 23.)

The said times accounted are 430 years, which are mentioned, Exodus 12. v. 40.
41.

But when the Scriptures speak of 400. years, as Beza annot in Acts 7. v 6.
Genesis 15. verse. 13. and Acts 7. verse. 6. The account is to be taken from the
birth of Isaac.

From the departing of the children of Israel out of Egypt unto the laying of
the foundation of Solomon's Temple are 480. years.

FOR,

Moses remained in the Wilderness 40 years, Deuteronomy. 2. v. 7. Psalm. 95. v. 10.
Amos 5 v. 25. Acts 7. v. 36. 42. etc. 13. v. 18.


From the Covenant that God made with Abraham, saying, IN THEE SHALL Genesis 12. v.
3. Acts 3. v. 25. Gal. 3. v. 8.
ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED, (upon which he departed from Ur of the Chaldees) unto
the giving of the Law Exodus 19 v. 1. 18 etc. 20. v. 1
in Mount Sinai are 430. years and almost three months: But the Apostle Gal.
3. v. 17. leaves out the months as an imperfect number.

Joshua in the 7 year after the death of Moses Comp Deuteronomy. 2. v. 7. 14. with
Josh. 14. v. 7. 10.
divided the Land of Canaan; and after that governed 10 years, (which the
Scriptures call a long time in respect of Joshua's age) and may Josh. 13. v. 1
etc. 23. v. 1.
be proved by deducting the evident and certain numbers out of the 480. years
mentioned, 1 King. 6. verse. 1.

Othniel judged Israel 40 years. Judge. 3. v. 11.


Under whose government Israel served the Lord Josh. 24. v. 31. Judge 2. v. 7 10.
all the days Which were 17. years according to the Hebrews; others say 20.
C. 3. v. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
of the Elders, who had seen the great works of the Lord; But when the Elders
were dead, they fell to Idolatry, and much wickedness: till at last the Lord
sold them into the hand of Chushan-Rishathaim King of Mesopotamia: by whom
being eight years grievously oppressed, they cried unto the Lord, and the
spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel their Judge, and he delivered them.

Note, that when the Scriptures say the Land had Judge 3. v. 11.
rest 40. years, and Othniel died; it is not to be understood that the Land
was in peace 40 years together under Othniel, but that the Land had rest or
peace unto the end of 40. years from the decease of Joshua; Or, until the
fortieth year of Othniels Ad annum quad^ages^inum. J^n. and Trem.
government: But in what year before the fortieth the peace began, the
Scriptures express not. So understand Judge. 3. v. 30. c. 5. v. 31. etc. 8. v.

neglected, and every man did that which was Judge. c. 17, 18, 19, 20. and 21.
right in his own eyes, were those days, wherein the Scriptures say, There
was no King in Israel.

Shamgar, was a deliverer, but no Judge; for the C. 3. v. 31.
Scriptures neither mention that he judged, nor that the Land had rest in his
days.

Deborah 40 years. C. 5. v 31.


The 20. years wherein Jabin King of Canaan C. 4. v. 2. 3, 4.
mightily oppressed Israel, were at that time when Deborah judged.

Gideon alias Ierubbaal 40 years. C. 6 v. 32. C. 8. v. 28.


Presently after the death of Deborah, Midian oppressed C 6. v. 11. to the 33.
Israel: and though Gideon, a mighty man of valor, was in the first year of
their oppression (otherwise there could not be forty years in his C 8. v. 28.
days) by the Lord in special manner called to the government, and had the
Lords promise, that he should save Israel from the hands of the Midianites: yet
until the seven years oppression (which God C. 6. v. 1. 34. C. 7. v. 9. 22 23
had appointed) were finished, and until the spirit of the Lord came upon him,
he did not deliver them.

Abimelech 3 years. C. 9. v. 22.


Tola 23 years. C. 10. v. 1, 2.


Iair 22 years. Verse 3.


In the end of the fourth year of Jair, the Philistines C. 10. v. 7, 8. C. 11.
v. 29.
and Ammonites began to vex and oppress Israel, which they continued 18.
years, until the Lord raised up Jephthah to deliver them.

Iephthah judged Israel 6 years. C. 12. v. 7.


About 34. years after that Sihon King of the Number. 21. v. 24, 25, 26. etc. 22.
v. 2. compared with c. 33. v. 38. 48.
Amorites had fought against the predecessor of Balak the son of Zippor King
of Moab, and had taken all his Land, even unto Arnon; Israel smote Sihon and
all his people, and possessed his Country: which was in the last year of
Moses. From whence unto Jephthah were but 266. years current; yet by adding
the years of their own possession unto Sihon's, whose right they had by the
Law of Conquest, Jephthah did justly say, that they had dwelt in or Judge. 11.
v. 26.
possessed those Countries three hundred years.

Eli Judge and Priest 40 years. 1 Samuel 4. v. 18.


Observe here, that from the death of Joshua unto Broughtons Advertisement, page
65. 67.
Samuel are 339. years: whereof the times of oppression and afflictions of
Israel were 111. years: which added together according to the Jews manner of
speaking, make 450. years. And therefore Saint Paul says, that God gave the
Israelites Judges Acts 13. v. 20. (...), quasi.
after a sort 450. years.

Samuel and Saul 40 years. See Expositours upon Acts 13. v. 21. 1 Samuel 6. v.

of Israel, and of Jehoshaph. King of Judah.

Or, from the time he first reigned in his fathers absence; and so he began to

(commonly called the Captivity of Babylon) with the utter destruction of
Jerusalem.

The said times accounted are 430 years and 10 days.

Reasons why it cannot be admitted that the Captivity of Judah (alias the 70
years Captivity) began in the third year of Iehoiakim.
First, because the fourth year of Iehoiakim was the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar; How then could Nebuchadnezzar Jer. 25 v. 1.
come up in the third of Iehoiakim? And to say that Nebuchadnezzar began to
reign and came up in the end of the third of Iehoiakim, is contrary to the Text
alleged, and also against reason; For what man can imagine, that
Nebuchadnezzar should receive his Crown, raise immediately a mighty host,
subdue all Syria, march afterward with an Joseph. Antiqu. l. 10. c. 7.
Army into Judea: (which is near 400. miles from Babylon) the very sight
whereof caused Iehoiakim to become his servant, and all this to be done in the
very 2 K. 24. v. 1.
end of the third of Iehoiakim?

Jehoiakim was See Broughtons consent of Scriptures. Mores Tables.
carried to Babylon, and sent home again Read Jer. 22. v. 18. 19.
: That Daniel and the rest were carried away Captives in the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar: That Jehoiakim rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar in the sixth
year of his reign: That Nebuchadnezzar came not against him till five years
after: That the Chaldean Kingdom continued but 70. years; Which they seek to
wrest from the words of Jeremiah, but in vain; Jer. 25.
for though in the fourth of Jehoiakim he prophesies of the just continuance
of the Chaldean Kingdom until the end of the 70. years Captivity, yet he
says not that the 70. years Captivity began in the fourth of Jehoiakim: for
the Scriptures declare that they began not till the end of the reign of
Zedekiah, which was eighteen years after the said prophecy.

Jehoiakim, as also of his son, was but a particular Captivity of some few,
though (I grant) many Nobles were then carried away. But the Captivity of
Judah, or the 70. years Captivity, was not the Captivity of a few, or only of
the chief, but of the whole Land of Judah; of Prince and people, with the utter
destruction of Jerusalem, in the end of the reign of Zedekiah. Of this
Captivity it is said. So Judah 2 K. 25. v. 21.
was carried away out of their Land. And Jehozadak 1 Chr. 6. v. 15. compared
with 2 K. 25 v. 18.
the son of Seraiah went into Captivity when the Lord carried away Judah and
Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. Thus Judah was carried away Captive
out Jer. 52. v. 27.
of his own Land. And the word of the Lord came unto Jer. 1. v. 1, 2.
Jeremiah in the days of Iehoiakim, unto the end of eleventh year of Zedekiah,
unto the carrying away Jerusalem Captive in the fifth month. What words can
plainer express the time when the Captivity of Judah began?

Them that had escaped from the sword carried 2 Chr 36. v. 20. 21.
he away to Babylon: where they were servants to him and his sons, until the
reign of the Kingdom of Persia: to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth
of Jeremiah, until the Land had enjoyed her Sabbaths: for as long as she lay
desolate, she kept Sabbath, to fulfill three score and ten years. See here
the 70. years desolation must be fulfilled from this Captivity in the end of
Zedekiah.

Jehoiakim were carried away captive in his third year, then must Jeconiah's
Captivity be in the ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar. For ^ Chr. 36. v. 59.
Jehoiakim reigned eight years after that, and his son Ieconiah three
months and ten days: But this is contrary to the Scriptures; which say
directly, that Nebuchadnezzar took Iehoiachin, alias Ieconiah, 2 K. 24. v. 12.
in the eighth year of his reign. And Jeremiah says, in the seventh year.
Jer. 52. v. 28.


Jeremiah, where the several Captivities are reckoned up, there Jer. 52. v. 28
29, 30.
is no notice taken of the Captivity of Iehoiakim, nor of the Captives at that
time carried to Babylon, being none but a few children chosen out of certain
of the children of Israel, and of the Kings seed, Dan. 1. v. 3. 4
and of the Princes, such as had ability in them to stand in the Kings Palace,
and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. Whereas
the Captivity of Zedekiah is there, and also in the 39. Chapter, and in the
latter book of the Kings and Chronicles largely related, as being the grand
and most remarkable Captivity, The Captivity of Judah.

From the beginning of the Captivity of Babylon unto the Commandment to
restore and to build Jerusalem again, are 152. years.
FOR, 2 Chr. 36. v. 21 Jer 25. v. 11 etc. 29. v. 10. Dan. 9. v. 2.


The Captivity continued 70 years.

The next year after, being the first year of King Cyrus, Israel returned
from Captivity. Ezra 1. v. 1


They began to build the Temple in the second Ezra 3. v. 8.
year of the said Cyrus, And it was finished in 29 years after, which was the
sixth year of King Darius, the son of Hystaspes. C. 6. v. 15.


Of this Temple it was prophesied, that the glory thereof should be greater
then of the former; which was, Hag. 2. v 9.
not in respect of the beauty in building, but because of the presence of the
Messiah, our Savior, who John 18. v 20.
should teach therein.

Artaxerxes in the end of his seventh year, which Ezra 7. v. 8. 11
was 52 years after the finishing of the Temple, sent Ezra, and gave him
Commission to restore and to build Jerusalem again.

Here began the 70. weeks revealed by the Angel Gabriel unto Daniel. Dan. 9. v.
21. 24


The said times accounted are 152 years.

Reasons why it cannot be admitted that Daniels 70. weeks should be accounted
from the first year of King Cyrus.
that the 70. weeks must be accounted from the going forth of the Commandment
to restore and Dan. 9. v. 25.
to build Jerusalem: which Commandment was not given forth by Cyrus; for the
Commission of Cyrus (twice rehearsed by Ezra) was only Ezra. 1. and 6.
to build the Temple. And though it be also true, that Cyrus gave Commandment
to build Jerusalem, yet Esa. 44. v. 28. etc. 45. v. 13.
he gave not Commandment to restore Jerusalem: Whereas that Commandment which
the Angel spoke of, was both to restore and to build Jerusalem. This was given
forth by Artaxerxes in the seventh Ezra 7. v. 11.
year of his reign; As may be seen by the tenor of Ezra his Commission. For
Jerusalem was then restored when the Laws were taught, and Religion
established: and it was then built, when Magistrates and Judges were set
therein. Without Religion Jerusalem could not be restored: without Magistrates
it could not be called a City. To settle both these, Ezra only received
authority and had Commandment.

Mr. Mores Tables.
reigned but three years: Cambyses after his fathers death four: But Mr. More
will have it that Cambyses reigned with his father six years, and one after
his fathers death. Both alike true. For if Cyrus and Cambyses reigned so short
a time, how could Cambyses, the Prince of the Kingdom of Persia, withstand
Dan. 10. v. 13. compared with v. 1.
the building of the Temple 21. years, as the Scriptures affirm; and are so
understood even by Mr. Broughton himself? Broughton ibid.

forth in the Book of Esther, but also in profane histories. And though it be
true, that in the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus they wrote an accusation
against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem: yet this accusation was so
far from hindering the building of the Temple, that it procured from Darius,
alias Ahasuerus, a Decree for the speedy finishing thereof. C. 6. v 1. unto v.
13.

sixth chapter, in whose reign the Temple was finished. But this cannot be.
For Ezra ending his story of Darius in the sixth chapter begins his seventh
thus: Now after these things in the reign of Artaxerxes King of Persia, etc.
Which words show plainly that he spoke of another King, and of things done long
after Darius. Besides, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, Ezra had Commission
to set Magistrates Ezra 7. v. 8. 25.
and Judges over the people, which could not be the next year after the
finishing of the Temple, unless we will suppose that Zerubbabel the Governor,
and Hag. 1. v. 1. Zech 4. v. 6.
Ieshua the High Priest, and the other Magistrates, did all die together on a
sudden, as soon as the Temple was finished.

That Xerxes hindered the building of the Temple; Broughtons Advertisement page

That Artaxerxes Longimanus was brother to Xerxes; whom all Histories with one
consent declare to be his son: That he reigned but 36. years: that
Artaxerxes Mores Tables.
Mnemon reigned 11. years with his father, and 10. alone; and infinite such
like absurdities.

Neither can they excuse themselves, because of the diversity of Writers
touching the time of these Kings. For the best and soundest Writers do not
differ: and that which is, and has from time to time been generally received,
must be taken for truth. But Vincent. Ler. contra Haeres. c. 3.
these follow none at all, and cannot so much as find one pur-blind Author to
countenance their inventions. And therefore they do cautiously omit the
particular account of Daniels 70. weeks.

More tells us, that Daniels 70. weeks must needs begin at the very end of their
70. years captivity, Mores Tables. page 94, 95.
or else the analogy of their 70. years captivity, and 7. times 70. years
liberty, could not stand: and also the comfort were not so forcibly brought by
the Angel, if there were any mean time between the end of their captivity,
and the beginning of their liberty.

An analogy is a proportion, similitude, or resemblance, which one thing has
unto another. Now that any intervenient time can destroy an analogy, is a
mere paradoxe. For in matter of proportion and similitude, neither time nor
place are considerable. Between the Paschall Exodus 12. v. 3. 21. Luke 23. v.
33.
Lamb in the first Passover, and the passion of Christ the Lamb of God, there
was a true analogy: yet there interceded 1552. years. Between the lifting up
of the Serpent in the Wilderness, and the lifting up of the Son of man,
there was a true Numb. 21. v. 9. John 3. v. 14.
analogy: yet there interceded 1512. years. Between Jonas his being three
days and three nights Jona 1. v. 17. Matthew. 12. v. 40
in the Whales belly, and the Son of man his being three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth, there was a true analogy: yet there
interceded about 820. years. Between Christ's suffering, and the signs now
administered in the Lords supper, there is a true analogy: yet the time since He
suffered is more then 1600. years. Therefore it is manifest, that the analogy
between Judah's 70. years Captivity and Daniel's 70. weeks may well stand,
though the weeks do not immediately begin in the end of the Captivity.

Nor does any mean time between the Jews Captivity, and their liberty,
diminish the comfort thereof more then the 46. years till the Israelites were
peaceably possessed of the Land of Canaan, diminished their comfort of being
freed from Egypt the house of bondage.

From the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem again, unto the death
and passion of our Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST, are 490. years.
FOR,

It is expressly declared unto Daniel, that from Dan. 9 v. 25.
the going forth of the Commandment to restore, and to build Jerusalem, unto
the Messiah, The Prince, shall be 7 weeks (so long it was before the
Reformation could be fully perfected and Religion established) and 62 weeks
(which make 69. weeks) and Verse 26. 27.
after 62. weeks, in the week following (which added to the said 69. makes
full 70. weeks) shall Messiah So Numb. 14. v. 34. So Ezekiel. 4. v. 5, 6. So Dan.
10. v 13 So Revel. 2. v. 10.
be cut off, and He shall confirm the Covenant, etc. Now accompting each day
for a year (as the Scriptures do frequently) 70. weeks do amount unto 490
years.

The full time from the Creation of Adam, unto the death and passion Which
Ezekiel. might happily intend by 4000 Cubits c. 47. v. 3, 4, 5.
of our Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST, is 4000 years and 10 days.

A particular proof of the times from the beginning of the Captivity of
Babylon unto the death and passion of our blessed Savior JESUS CHRIST, whereby
the former computation, as also many places of the Scriptures, are cleared.

Of these three Jeremiah speaks, c. 27. v. 6, 7.

Note, that when Cyrus the Persian overcame Astyages King of the Medes, (whom

The building of the Temple went forward two years, but from the beginning of
the third year Ezra 4. v. 24. Dan. 10. v. 1, 2. 4. 13.
of Cyrus (accompting from Darius his death) Cambyses withstood it, and caused
it to cease 21. years: which was, until he himself died. Allowing therefore
eight years unto him with Smerdis the Mage, it is plain that he hindered the
building in his fathers absence 13. years; Whereunto adding those two years,
when it went forward, the time of Cyrus his reign after Darius, was 15. years.

Cambyses when his father Cyrus invaded Scythia, Herodot. l. 3. Grimston Estat.

was appointed King according to the custom of the Persians, which was, to
leave the nearest in blood to rule in the Kings absence; In which Expedition

by Alexander the Great.

One Argument Mr. Broughton brings, wherewith (as he conceives) he disproveth
al computations but his own; and it is drawn from the ages of Zerubbabel,
Jeshua, Mordecai, Ezra, and Nehemiah; which See Broughtons consent of Scripture.
(says he) must be stretched beyond all likelihood, if the Kingdom of Persia
continued above 130. years.

Zerubbabel. Jeremiah tells us, That Jehoiakim, alias Jeconiah, was brought
forth of prison in Jer. 52. v. 31. 33, 34.
the 37. year of his Captivity, which was the 26. year of the Captivity of
Judah; and did eat continually before the King of Babylon, until the day of
his death: which admit to be two years after; then were 28. years of Judah's
Captivity passed. Salathiel, alias Matthew 1. v. 12. 1 Chr. 3. v. 18, 19.
Shealtiel, was the son of Jeconiah by succession: Salathiel begat Pedaiah,
Pedaiah begat Zerubbabel.

Now admit, that Salathiel immediately after he succeeded Jeconiah, begat
Pedaiah, and that Pedaiah at 24. years also begat Zerubbabel, (which probably
was not sooner) then was Zerubbabel 18. years old in the first year of King
Cyrus, and 48. when the Temple was finished, in the reign of Darius Hystaspes.

As to Jeshua. He was the son of Jozadak, alias Ezra 3. v. 2. 1 Chr. 6. v.
14, 15. 2 K* 25 v. 18. 21
Jehozadak, the son of Seraiah, the chief Priest, who was slain by
Nebuchadnezzar. Now admit that Jehozadak was ten years old when he was carried
into Captivity, and that 30. years after he begat Jeshua; then was Jeshua 40.
years old in the first year of Cyrus, and 70. when the Temple was finished.

As to Mordecai. Admit that he was five years Esth. 2. v. 6.
old when he was carried away Captive with Jeconiah, then was he 122. years
old in the 12. year C. 3. v. 7.
of Ahasuerus, when the two days of Purim were by the Decree of Queen Esther
made feastivall; after C. 9. v. 1. 32.
which should he live eight years, he then died at the age of 130. which was
not unlikely in those 2 Chr. 24. v. 15
times.

As to Ezra. Admit that he was five years old when his father Seraiah the
chief Priest was slain, then was he 170. years old in the 20. of Artaxerxes
Longimanus, when he read and instructed the people in Neh. 2. v. 1 etc. 8. v.
3. 13.
the words of the Law: after which, should he live ten years (though
peradventure he lived not one year) he then died at the age of Isaac 180. years
old. And what unlikelihood is there but that God for the good of Genesis 35. v. 28.
his Church might as well preserve Ezra unto this age, as he did Phinehas the
son of Eleazar to a far Moses Aegyptius in suo Misna, ut citatur l. 2. chr.
Genebr.
greater, whom the Jews affirm to have lived 300. years?

Nor will it further extend the age of Ezra to show, that Ezra went into the
Chamber of Johanan, and that he wrote the Books of the Chronicles in Johanan's
time. For Johanan, alias Jonathan, was the son of Iehoiada, the son of
Eliashib, the son of Ioiakim, Neh. 12 v. v. 10 11.
the son of Ieshua. Now admit each of these to be begotten in the thirtieth
year of their fathers age, (observing what we spoke before concerning Ieshua)
then was Iohanan borne in the fifth year of Artaxerxes Longimanus; and so Ezra
might very well in the beginning of Artaxerxes his eighth year go into the
chamber of Iohanan, who was then about Ezra 10. v. 6.
three years old. And what hinders but that he might write the sons of Levi,
the chief of the fathers, Neh. 12. v. 23.
in the Book of the Chronicles, even until the days of Iohanan, seeing he
lived in the 20. of Artaxerxes, at which time Iohanan was 15. years old?

But if Mr. Broughton may prevail, the said Priests shall be much more forward
in procreation. For he will allow but 87. years from the Captivity of Zedekiah
See Broughtons consent of Scripture.
unto the 7. of Artaxerxes. Whence it follows, that though ten years be
granted to Iehozadak at the time of Captivity, yet every one of them must begin
to beget children before 19. years old, otherwise Iohanan could not be borne
when Ezra came to Jerusalem.

True it is, Nehemiah says, that the Levites and Priests were recorded unto
the reign of Darius, but by Neh. 12. v. 22.
whom this was done, he tells not; it is plain, not by Ezra, for he wrote but
until the days of Iohanan. 1 Chr. 9. compared with Neh. 11.
And though Nehemiah concludes, these were in the days of Joiakim, and in the
days of Nehemiah the Governor, and of Ezra the Priest, the Scribe; yet it C.
12. v. 26.
cannot be understood, that they were all of them in every one of their days,
for that is impossible: but that all of them were in all their days; some in
the days of Joiakim, some in the days of Ezra, some in the days of Nehemiah.

As to the age of Nehemiah. Admit that he was 25. years old when he came to
Jerusalem, and lived unto the end of the Persian Monarchy, he was then Neh. 2.
v. 11.
130. years old when he died, which is nothing unlikely. Func. fol 74.


Thus we have the continuance of the Persian Kingdom unto 210. years, and
probably the ages of Zerubbabel, Ieshua, Mordecai, Ezra, and Nehemiah; without
the diminution of the one, or stretching of the other beyond reason.

The first Monarch of Grecia.
Alexander the Great, after the full overthrow Justin. l. 11. Bacholz. page 53.
of Darius, reigned 7 years.

Upon his deathbed he parted his Kingdom among 1 Mac. 1. v. 6. 9. Dan. 11. v.
5. to the 30.
his servants, such as were honorable; who all after his death put Crowns
upon themselves, and soon fell into wars one against another. Of whom the
chiefest were four: Seleucus King of Syria, Joseph. Antiqu. l. 12. c 1.
Justin. l. 13. Sleidan. l. 1. Dan. 7. v. 6 c. 8. v. 8. 21, 22. etc. 11. v. 3, 4.
Ptolomeus of Egypt, Antigonus of Asia the less, and Cassander of Macedon. And
of these the two former excelled in power: between whom what leagues and
conflicts should be, Daniel foretold under the names of The King of the North,
and the King Dan. 11.
of the South. For Syria lies Northward, and Egypt Southward, from Judea. The
whole chapter is paraphrased by Joseph Hall Bishop of Exceter.

Note, That the Grecian Kingdom Func. fol. 75. Bucholz. page 56
so often mentioned in the Books of the Maccabees, began 13 years complete
after the death of Alexander the Great.

Antiochus King of Syria, a King of fierce countenance, a vile person, that
wicked root, after his brother Seleucus was dead, began to reign in the end of
the 137 year of the Grecian Kingdom.

year, the transgression of desolation began, and the daily sacrifice decayed
by the gross idolatry of those, who (with the license of Antiochus) joined
themselves to the Heathen, and were sold to do mischief. And in the 143. year,
he took Jerusalem, polluted the Sanctuary, hindered, and afterward forbad the
daily Sacrifice, and compelled the Jews to all manner of ambition. Whom
Mattathias the Priest for 1 Mac. 2. v. 1. 19 to the 48. and v. 66. 70. etc. 3.
v. 1, 2. Joseph. l. d. c. 8.
some times courageously and prosperously resisted; but he quickly deceasing,
Judas Maccabeus (according to his appointment) rose up in his stead, and became
both the Captain and Governor of Judea, in the end of the 146. year of the
Grecian Kingdom,

Antiochus having then reigned 9 years.

Judas, surnamed Maccabeus, was slain in 1 Mac. 9. v. 3. 18 Joseph. l. d. c.

month.

In the second year of his government on the 1 Mac. 4. v. 36. 10 ^he 60.
five and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the 148. year, he finished the
cleansing of the Sanctuary, and restored the daily Sacrifice. So that from the
time that the transgression of desolation began, and the daily Sacrifice
decayed, unto the cleansing of the Sanctuary, and the full restoring of the
Sacrifice, are 6. years 3. months, and 17. days; which contain those 2300.

Alexander, surnamed Ianneus, 27 years. Joseph. l. d. c. 20 and 23.


Salome, whom the Greeks call Alexandra, Joseph. l. d. c. 24.

Aristobulus, compelling his brother Hyrcanus Joseph. l. 14. c. 1 and 8.
the High Priest, to submit unto a private life, took upon him both the
Kingdom and Priesthood; but in the third year of his reign he was taken
prisoner by Pompey, and carried to Rome.

Presently after, Gabinius the Roman General, Joseph. l. d. c. 10.
vanquishing Alexander the son of Aristobulus, erected five seats of Justice;
The first at Jerusalem, the second at Gadar, the third at Amatho, the fourth at
Jericho, the fifth at Saphor in Galilee, and so changed the Kingdom into an
Aristocracy; which was immediately Joseph. l. d. c. 11.
interrupted by Aristobulus, who escaped from Rome, but was soon taken by the
said Gabinius, and again sent back.

Aristobulus reigned (including the time of his Joseph. ibid.
Captivity) 3 years and 6 months

Afterward the said Aristocracy continued Joseph: l. d. c. 15. schol.

15 years and 6 months.

Antipater by Julius Caesar made Governor of Judea, in the end of the third
year Joseph. l. d. c. 15. and 17 schol. illustrat. Func. Chr. fol. 89.

surnamed the Great, and reigned 34 years.

Of whom Matthew. 2. v. 1. to the 19. Luke 1. v. 5.

He was nine years and six months in repairing Iosoph. Antiqu. l. 15. c.

Zerubbabels Temple; which was in building (including the times of
interruption) 29. years. Solomon's was built in seven years and six months.
Now add these three sums together, and according to the Jews manner of
speaking, (which they frequently used for memory sake) The Temple was in John
2. v. 20.
building 46. years.

Our Savior Jesus Christ was borne in the Joseph. l. 17. c. 10 Func. Chr. f.

beginning of the 34. year of Herod.

And in the beginning of the 42. year of Augustus, Eusebius. Chr. fol. 69. D.

accompting from the death of his predecessor Julius Caesar.

At that time Augustus made a Decree that all the world should be taxed.

Note, That when Jacob said, the Scepter shall not depart from Judah, until
Shiloh come, It is not to be understood that the Crown should continue in the
Tribe of Judah from the time of the said Prophecy until Christ's coming. For
before David Calvin. institut. l. 1. c. 8. Sect. 7.
the Prophecy took no effect; And after Zedekiah, even until the Maccabees
(excepting only Zerubbabel Neh. 5. v. 14. 15 Ezekiel. 21. v. 25, 26, 27. Genebr.
Chr. l. 1.
and Nehemiah, who yet were no Kings, nor absolute Governors) it is altogether
uncertain who ruled in Judea: and from the Maccabees until Christ, it is
manifest the supreme authority was not in the Tribe of Judah. The true sense
thereof is, That after David's reign, in whom the Prophecy first took effect,
The Scepter, that is, the right and just title unto Comment. vulg. in 1. Matthew.
the Crown, should not depart from the Tribe of Judah until Christ came;
which is clearly proved Matthew. 1. v. 1. to the 17.
by Saint Matthew. But at our Saviors birth or coming the Jews were not
only dispossessed of the Baron. apparat. ad Annal. Eccl. Chemnit. Harm.
Evangel. c. 2.
Crown, but also had lost the very right and title thereunto, by swearing
fealty unto King Herod not long before: and so Jacobs Prophecy was fully
accomplished.

Archelaus succeeding his father Herod, reigned Matthew. 2. v. 22. Joseph.
Antiqu. l. 17. c. 10. and 13. Gerhard. Comment. in Harm. Evang. c. 10. Joseph.
l. d. c. ult.
3 years, but was then degraded by Augustus Caesar, and made President only
of half Herod's Kingdom; the other half was divided betwixt Herod's two other
sons, Philip and Antipas. Seven years after Augustus confined the said
Archelaus for his Tyranny unto Vienna a City of France, where he died.

Herod, surnamed Antipas, and Philip, at the aforesaid division of Herod's
Kingdom, were by Augustus made Tetrarchs, the former of Galilee, Luke 3. v. 1.
the latter of Iturea, and of the Region of Trachonitis.

This Herod beheaded John the Baptist, and was by our Savior termed a Fox, for
his deceit and treachery: Matthew. 14. v. 1.
Whom Saint Mark, using the phrase of his own people, calls a King; And in
respect of his Mark* 6. v. 14. 26. Luke 9. v. 7. etc. 13. v. 32.
power and greatness it is, that the Scriptures place him before his elder
brother Philip.

Our Savior Jesus Christ was crucified when Joseph. Antiqu. l. 17. c. 13. and
l. 18. c. 3. schol. illustr. Func. Chr. fol. 91. 92.
Herod the Tetrarch had governed 29 years, and about 3 months.

And in the eighteenth year, about the beginning Eusebius. Chapter f. 71. Beda. l. d.

of the fourth month of Tiberius Caesar, who succeeded Augustus, having
reigned 57. year.

And in the seventh year of Pontius Pilate, Governor Func. Chr. f. 92.

of Judea.

The age therefore of our Savior Ignat. ad Trall. Niceph. Hist. Eccles. l. 1.

was 33. years and about three months.

And may be thus set forth in particular.

Upon the expiration of the 30. year of His age, Luke 3. v 21. 22, 23. comp.
with Numb. 4. v. 23. 30. 47. Matthew. 4. v. 12. 17. Mark. 1. v. 14. Chemnit.

comp. with Deuteronomy. 16. v. 1. 9, 10. Genebr. l. 2. Chemnit. Harm. Evangel. c. 45.
He was baptized and entered into His Ministry; though He did not publicly
show Himself, till John was cast into prison, which was almost a year after.

Neither can any inconvenience follow from the season of the year, that Christ
should then go into the river Jordan to be baptized For in Judea there is very
little winter, and that only in October, and the beginning of November. And
the Scriptures tell us, that on the second day after the Passover, which was
the 16. day of the month Abib alias Nisan, and is with us the 27. of March, a
sheafe of the first fruits of Harvest was offered.

The first Passover after His Baptism was about the end of three months,
John 2. v. 13. 23.

The second Passover is expressed, John c. 5. v. 1. where the word Feast, by
way of eminency is put for the Passover, which was the chiefest feast of the
Jews. So Matthew. 27. v. 15. So John 4. v. 45. compared with c. 2. v. 23. So c.
11. v. 56. So c. 12. v. 1, 2. So c. 13. v. 1. 29.

The third Passover, John 6. v. 4.

The fourth Passover, John 13. v. 1. On the Eve Mark. 15. v. 42. John 19. v.
31. 42. August. de Trin. l. 4. c. 5.
whereof Our Savior was crucified, which the Jews call the Preparation day;
And was the 25. day of March, on which day He was also conceived in the womb.

From whence these particulars are manifest.

1. That from the beginning of the Captivity of Babylon, unto the first of King
Cyrus are 70. years; from thence unto the end of the 7. of Artaxerxes
Longimanus are 82. years; which added together, make 152. years. And from
thence unto the death and passion of Our Savior, are 490. years, or, as the
Angel informed Daniel, 70. weeks; In the end of Dan. 9. v. 24.
which last year of the said 490. Our Savior was crucified.

2. That near the midst of the last week of the said 70. Our Savior entering
into His Ministry, began Dan. 9. v. 27. John 4. v. 23. Matt. 27. v. 51. Mark.
15. v. 38
to cause the Sacrifice and the Oblation to cease, but by His death He did
utterly abolish them; which was signified when the veil of the Temple rent in
twain.

3. That near the 25. day of December, and most August. in Psalm: 132. and de
Trin. lib 4. 2. Chrysostom. in c. Lucae. 1 v. 29. Niceph. Hist. Eccles. l. 1. c.

finem. Chemnit. Harim. Evangel. c. 8. Gordon. Lesinor. Chr. Tom, 2. in apparat.
probably on that day Our Savior was borne.

Lastly, That from the Creation of Adam, unto the birth of Our Savior, are
3966. years, 9. months, and 10. days. Unto which 9. months and 10. days,
adding the 5. days before the Creation of Adam, Genesis 1. v. 23. Exodus 12. v. 2.
compared with c. 13. v. 4. Beda de ratione Temp. c. 28. and 40. Polan. Synt.
Theol. l. 5. c. 7.
and then accompting 9. months and 15. days from the 25. of December
backwards, It is evident that the world began on the 10. day of March, when the
Sun enters into Aries, and makes the Equinoctial.

Soli Sapienti DEO, sit laus and gloria in omne aevum. Amen.
