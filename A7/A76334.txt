A NEW YEARS GIFT For Ao 1686.
WHO lives in this mortal life,
That does not understand,
The mighty Works that God has done,
And wrought with his right Hand,
The heavens and earth he did contrive,
And brought thom to a frame,
Then let all Souls that live on earth,
Give praise unto his name.
Then all the works that he had done,
He saw that they were good,
But woeful wretched wicked man,
From his obedience fled,
And brought on his posterity,
Both sorrow, pain and grief,
But he decreed most graciously,
To send our souls relief.
He chose a People on the earth,
Which was his whole delight,
But oh how often did they revolt!
And wrought him mikle spite,
On Sinai Mount he gave a Law,
Which they should well observe,
But that did not keep them in aw,
They from that Law did swerve.
Full forty Years they did him grieve
Into the wilderness,
But still his thought was to relieve.
Them from their sad distress,
He brought them to the promised Land,
Which he a promise made,
Even to the blessed Patriachs,
When they from Egypt fled.
It seems these times are now renewed,
Which daily we may see,
When Christians full sore pursue'd,
Must from great Tyrants fly,
And forced to shelter where they can,
For to escape their rage,
Let any one think what he will,
It is a sad presage.
Lord thou that sits in Heaven above,
And looks down below,
Do thou revenge thy Servants blood,
That suffers overthrouw,
Reward these persecutors so,
That they may dread and fear,
When God's strong hand shall them ov'rtake,
And them in pieces tear.
We must not in Gods Secrets Search,
Nor dive in his de^ree,
For certainly this wicked World,
Shall sadly punished be,
For faith and truth is fled away,
But pride and greed remains,
The poor oppressed, the rich at rest,
Have all things to their minds.
That wickedness and cruel Vice,
Does in those times abound;
For honesty will give no price,
The World's turned upside down;
For pure Religion's made a mock,
Which daily we do see,
And some do wear it for a Cloak
To hide their Villainy.
But Christ, his true Church will protect
In spite of Devils and Men,
Their Plotts shall never take effect,
Do Wizzards what they can.
Though Men and Devils all combine
To damp that Glorious light,
The Lord will frustrate their design,
When it is at the height.
And as for Conscience that poor wretch,
It Is Coat is so Thread bare,
It quakes and trembles when it thinks
The truth for to declare.
It never feels nor finds the smart;
Because it wants the sting,
There Is few Men conscience take to Heart,
If it can profit bring.
Blessed be the Lord that has now lent
To us a good new Year,
And it may be, before it end
With Christ we shall appear.
Then shall poor conscience tremble sore,
When Christ shall it accuse,
That willingly, and wittingly
It did it self abuse,
Lord do thou bless this Church and State,
Here where we have abode,
Give grace to mend our wicked lives,
And still depend on God,
And seek him till he can be found,
And still implore his grace,
That his good Sprit may us conduct,
Into our Heavenly place.
How often has the Lord spoke home
Unto this congregation,
By powerful Preachers of his word,
And by good approbation.
When they take pains to preach the word,
For our eternal good,
If we neglect and slight the means,
They are free of our blood.
The Lord has lent us many years,
Still waiting for our turn,
Oh! plant in us thy precious fear,
That we for sin may mourn.
That we may live a godly life,
Until the day we dye.
Let every man be feared to sin,
Grant Lord, that so may I.
ALEXANDER BEG.
