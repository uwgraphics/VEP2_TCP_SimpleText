HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER TO THE Humble Petition of the Gentlemen, Freeholders,
and Ministers of the County Palatine of CHESTER, delivered to His MAJESTY at
YORK the seventh of May, 1642.
At the Court at YORK 9 May 1642.
His Majesty has given me express command to give you this His Answer to
your Petition.

THat He sees plainly that this Petition of yours has been framed without
having heard the Answer His Majesty gave to His Parliament, upon their
Petition to Him for desisting from His Journey into Ireland; for He cannot
think that that Country (from whence He has received formerly so good
expressions of their loyal Intentions, by two former Petitions presented long
since to Him and the Parliament) would have been so much mistaken, as to have
made this Petition, after they had seen and well considered His Majesty's said
Answer. And His Majesty observes very well, that this Petition is not like
others, which by an untimely Zeal, have desired Him to return to His
Parliament; You only desiring Him there to reside, where with more convenience
and security He may consult with His great Council, then by going into
Ireland: His Majesty being confident, That your well weighing of His Answers
concerning that subject, has been the cause that you have not imitated some
few other Countries in that particular; And that you have well considered the
Rebellious Affront offered to Him at Hull, by a hostile opposition of His
entrance; and therefore believes that the same Reason which made you, at this
time express your tender care of His Person, and the former good expressions
you made of your Loyalty and right-set Affections to the good of the whole
Kingdom, may sooner induce you to Petition the Parliament to apply themselves
to a right understanding of His Majesty's ways and intentions, and to do Him
Justice for that Affront, then make you to prefer any such ill-grounded
Petition. And that you may be the better informed of His Majesty's proceedings
in those particulars; He recommends to your view and consideration, His Answers
to the Declaration presented to Him at New Market, to the Petition presented to
Him at York the 26 of March last, concerning His journey into Ireland, His two
Messages and Declaration concerning Hull; all which, when it shall be fully
represented to the rest of your County, He doubts not but that you will rest
very well satisfied of His constant Resolution for the maintaining of, and
governing you by the Law of the Land, His unmovable Resolutions for the
maintenance and defense of the true Protestant Profession, and the suppression
and chastising of the barbarous Irish Rebellion, As for your apprehensions of
danger of being left naked, and not put into a Posture of Defense, His Majesty
assures you, That He will take care that it shall be done in the true old
legal way which has been used in this Kingdom, without bringing in strangers
to govern you, or admitting new and exorbitant Powers, derogating both from His
Majesty's undoubted Legal Authority, and the Liberty of the Subject, which, as
He has constantly denied, so He expects, and no ways doubts, but that you
will give Obedience to that, and that only, which shall proceed from His
Majesty in a Legal way.
