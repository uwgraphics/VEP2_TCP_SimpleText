THE EMPEROVRS AMBASSADORS SPEECH AT HIS DAY OF AVDIENCE, the 7. of April
1622. before his Majesty of Great Britain, etc.
MOst high and Mighty Prince KING of Great Baittaine, France and Ireland, etc.

The Emperors Majesty, being also King of Hungaria, Bohemia, and my most
gracious Lord and Master: desiring of all other things to salute your great and
Kingly Majesty, has thought it convenient to manifest and propose his most
entire love, and brotherly Embassy unto you, appointing me (though unworthy)
to deliver that in words, and that publickely, which he privately conceiueth
and apprehends in his heart, befitting your Greatness: Wishing withal both
to your Majesty and your Royal house such blessings, as belong to mighty
Princes, especially happiness in government, health of body, tranquillity of
mind, love of your people, and peace withal the World, even as he wishes to
himself, and his own establishment, peace being a thing more acceptable unto
him, then his own prosperity and greatness: peace being a thing, which I
have in charge chiefly to insist upon, and request your MAJESTY to accord unto.

Besides, his Imperial Majesty has imposed this task upon me, to present
these letters of credit and justification of of his true heart and meaning
into your Royal hands, and withal the behalf of his Imperial Majesty to
impart, and further make known unto your MAJESTY, that from his first step
into the Throne, and entrance into his Imperial dignity, yea at all times
since to this present hour, and as he hopes to the consummation of all
hours, no one thing has or can be more acceptable unto him, then the
entertainment of love, friendship, and amity not only with such Princes, to
whom his predecessors have made profession formerly of peace and concord, in
contracting of leagues, and combination of covenants, but is also ardent in his
desire, and would feign express the same by his endeauours toward all other
Christian Princes and Potentates, though farther remote, as far as the
enlarging his love, maintaining of friendship, and keeping correspondency in
all things befitting their honor, and his dignity. But especially with your
MAJESTY, toward whom he bears such an affectionate love, and burning zeal,
that he would feign enter into conditions of everlasting peace, and hold an
indissoluble contract of real, sincere, and most perfect amity, a blessing not
only commendable and proper for Princes to embrace, being indeed more comely
then their ornament of State, but also most requisite and necessary for their
own welfare, the good of their subjects, the enriching their countries, the
enlarging their revenues and manifestion of their profession of Christianity:
to illustrate which with oratory, precept, cautio^, or example is to great a
work at this time, and neediesse to such a Princely wisdom and mature
apprehension.

But that this great care and Princely desire did ever appear in his Imperial
Majesty, even from his first entrance into the dignity which God bestowed upon
him with many other of his own hereditary kingdoms, and dominions to this
present hour, howeuer some strange wind has thickened up clouds of
disturbance, which threaten grearer and greater tempests. It has pleased your
MAJESTY to ratefie and confirm, yea, you have given him great assurance of
sincere love, and affectionate friendship, and this has not been barely
performed by cursory letters, or missiue gratifications, but by magnificent
Ambassadors, and sumptuous expenses, and that diverse times to assure his
Imperial Majesty you did not only approve of his good intent, and purposes:
but desire the continuance and ratification of the same, still endeavoring by
all means possible to re-establish and restore the pristinate contracts, and
tranquillity of the chiefest Princes, and Potentates of Christendom: and
whereas now some untoward hand had attempted to be-spot the beautiful face of
Europe with troubles, or made wrinkles in the same with fearful turmoyles,
your MAJESTY, and none but your self, has endeavored to make it smooth
again, that it may show her former hansomnes and unmatchable glory: yea as
far as was possible' you have appeared like a rising Sun, to dispell and
dissipate these cloudy vapors and untoward mists of dissension, that in steed
of tumultuous enmity, and fearful clamours of war, true contracted
friendship might step in, and the sweet concord of peace sound the comfortable
Diapason of good Music, to please the Ears of all good Princes, and cheer
the hearts of true and honest people, wherein as you have out-stripped other
Kings in the race to high honor, and great renown, so that your Royal name
for extraordinary wisdom, learning, and moderation of passions, has an
extraordinary passage throughout the world for praise and admiration: so does
his Imperial Majesty pray, and request you to continue the same motives, and
still and still to set forward the same practices, that the Princes of Europe
may not only participate with the benefit of peace by your means: but you
your self assure unto your Princely heart the present fruition of all
applauses, and the future enjoying of immortal fame, and glory.

To the end therefore, that your MAJESTY may evidently understand, and
iudiciously apprehend, how much, and how highly his Imperial Majesty does
estimate, and make account of your MAJESTY'S love and affection, and with what
embraces and amplexure he would entertain your friendship, yea endeavor
withal earnest desire to gratefie the same, as far as honorable
correspondency, and reciprocal requital may extend, he has thought it
convenient without protraction or ambiguous disputing the matter to send me as
his Ambassador, to acquaint you with his gracious intent, and assure you, that
he does no less affect the common good of Christendom, then your Princely
self, or any king in Europe: but especially the welfare and prosperity of
your MAJESTY'S house, though there has bin cause of displeasure and
discontent, yea it is part of his care, and study to labor out the means, and
give way unto all occasions, that may raise up again the decayed and bruised
peace, which has bin so unfortunately pashed down to the ground, and as I may
say trampled under feet, and no question long since some gentle hand had lifted
her to better firmness, or brought her within the strength of supportation, if
as ungentle arms had not gone by force, and violent courses to work their
own ends, and affects their designs, wherein they have without question
started out of the smooth and even path of your great wisdom, and judicious
Council, sauering all princelines, charity, love and religious care to run
into the by-ways of their own wilfulness, and ambitious proiects, so that
whereas you like a fair moving planet have still kept one acceptable course
toward peace and tranquillity: they like turbulent Meteors and prodigious
exhalations have violently run forward to the vexing of themselves, and
disturbing of others, whereby their unjustifiable actions may truly, and
sufficiently be said to have bin the cause of so much bloodshedding, and
fearful destruction both of countries and people: so that his Imperial
Majesty is willing to acknowledge, and withal the world to confess that
these kind of violent proceedings, or if you will, unkind courses, have been
greatly displeasing unto your MAJESTY, and so far distasting, that from time
to time out of mature judgment and regal piety, you have endeavored to divert
the mischief, and turn the stream as it were of these unkind ouerflowings:
nor has this been barely done by running messengers, missiue letters,
polliticke entreaties, charitable wishes, or such like shows of goodness, but
by most honorable Ambassadors, sincere affection, extraordinary charge, and
unmatchable Princelinesse, and all as well for the general good of
Christendom, as the particular re-establishing the peace of Germany, which
hitherto has been torn a pieces by the cruel hands of reuolters, and
unkind snatches of tumultuous dissension, and and therefore is not only to be
wished to be recovered, but endeavored by all possible means to be brought to
true and perfect reformation.

And whereas I must confess, his Imperial Majesty has unwillingly taken arms,
and raised his forces for his own defense, and maintaining his honor and
renown, a thing wherein far inferior Princes would have bin startled, and
could perform no less: he will as willingly be enduced to lay them down
again, and be as speedily entreated to desist from hostility, and violent
prosecutions, if others without reason, and true or just intimation do not show
themselves perverse and obstinate, to which he is questionless the more
tractable, because your MAJESTY can so nobly act his part; not only in
defending the dignity of Kings, and the prerogatives of Monarchies, but in
expropriating the timorous proceedings of subjects, or any other that shall
take up tumultuous arms to disturb the peace of provinces. For although at
first it may carry a show of glorious enterprises and heroicke actions: yet
when the miserable effects of the best war are considered, nothing will prove
so fearful and lamentable, nor is their any thing that I know of in the
world, that draws on repentance, and compunction of soul so suddenly, as
unjustifiable hostility, and unconscionably practices.

I must and will forbear at this time to importune your MAJESTY to this
atonement by unseasonable repititions of precedent occurrences, raising the
causes of unkindness out of the circle of other men's distempred humors, or
turbulency of spirit, it is sufficient that all the world may know; how
contrary these proceedings have been to your wholesome advice, judicious
Council, and pious inclination, so many ways and times published, and made
known to all Christendom: and as for his Imperial Majesty they have crossed
his intents, opposed his offers, and made him sad again to think there should
be such occasions of displeasure. I will therefore only insist upon this that
your MAJESTY may be assured and confident, that his Imperial Majesty has an
absolute worthy intent toward you, and resolves sincerely, really, royally,
and without cunning or fraud, to treat with you about these affairs, and so
compass business, that all tractates between you may be firmly ratified,
and faithfully performed, wherein he does but only give away unto that, which
your MAJESTY formerly desired, and in all Princelinesse wished, as is apparent
by your several letters, and magnificent Embassy, and because it pleased his
Majesty of Spain to apprehend the same, and manifest his earnest willingness
to this pacification. From his Imperial Majesty I have a charge to give you
notice or as much, which when it pleases your MAJESTY to vouchsafe the
hearing, I shall at large impart unto you, and make known with what readiness
both their Majesty's will hearken to your propositions, and as you shall think
convenient tractate about the same: nor make they any question, but that the
work being generally so good and charitable, and particularly so effectual
and profitable to all the Provinces of Europe, will come to as happy an end, or
period considering nothing is meant but truth, sincerity, and the hope of
indissoluble amity whereby God shall be glorified, all your Majesty's honored,
the countries blessed, and people recomforted, whose hearts are now sadded, as
much with the fear of future misery, as the endurance of present clamity.

Thus humbly beseeching your Majesty to believe, that his Imperial Majesty
will endeavor by all possible means to give you assurance of his love and
respect toward you. I am the bolder to warrant the sincerity of his intent, and
that there is nothing proposed but truth, faith, and good meaning. In which
resolution he wishes unto your Majesty the happiness of your Kingly estate,
and the prosperity of a long, and blessed reign, with the increase of many
years, health, honor, contentment, and felicity.

Finis.
