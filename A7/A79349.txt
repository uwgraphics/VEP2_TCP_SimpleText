A PROCLAMATION For the preventing of the Exportation of Wools, Wool-Fells,
Woollen-Yarn, Fullers-Earth, and other Scouring Earths, out of this Kingdom.
CHARLES R.

FORASMVCH as the making of Woollen-Cloth, and other Manufactures of Wool,
which has been, and is the great Staple-Trade of this Kingdom, (whereby the
Commerce of this Kingdom, and many thousand Families therein have been, and are
principally maintained and upheld) has nevertheless of late years been much
impaired and decayed; And whereas it is apparent, That the Exportation of
Wools, Wool-fells, Yarn made of Wool, Fullers-Earth, and other scouring Earths,
are a great means and occasion of such decay of the said Trade, by enabling the
Foreign making of Cloth, and thereby hindering the Vent of Our Clothes made
within this Our Realm of England:

We taking into Our Princely consideration, the weighty consequence thereof;
and desiring to advance the Wealth of Our People, and to provide an effectual
remedy against such a growing evil, at the humble request of the Lords and
Commons in Parliament assembled, have thought fit, and do by this Our
Proclamation, straightly charge, prohibit, and command, That no manner of
Wools, Wool-fells, Yarn made of Wool, Fullers-earth, or other scouring Earths
whatsoever, be at any time or times hereafter, by any person or persons,
whether natural born Subject, Denizen, or Stranger, exported, transported, or
sent out of this Our Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, or the Town or Port
of Berwick upon Twede, or any the Isles, Ports, Creeks, or places thereof, into
the Kingdom of Scotland, or into any Foreign parts beyond the Seas, upon pain
of Our highest indignation, and the severe Penalties that by the Laws and
Statutes of this Our Realm may be inflicted as well upon the Offenders
themselves, as their Aiders, Procurers, Abettors, and Favorers:

And to the end, that all Customers, Officers, and Ministers, in or about the
Ports of England, may more strictly look to the observance of Our Will and
Pleasure hereby signified, for the benefit and advantage of this Our Kingdom;
We do hereby further straightly charge and command, That if any Officer or
Minister of or belonging to Our Customs or Ports, or attending at any the
Havens, Creeks, or places adjacent, or carrying to the Sea, shall consent or
connive at the unlawful Exportation of the Premises, or any of them; that then
every such Customer, Officer, or Minister, who shall offend in any of the
Premises, shall not only forfeit his Office, place, and employment, but shall
also incur all other the pains and penalties aforesaid. And if any Minister or
Officer of or in any Ship or other Vessel, shall permit and suffer any Woolls,
Wool-Fells, or any other of the Premises to be transported in any Ship,
Bottom, or other Vessel wherein or whereof he shall be Master or other Officer,
That then every person so offending shall be subject to such pain and penalty
as aforesaid.

And We do hereby further command and enjoin, That not any more or greater
quantity of Wooll-Fells, Woollen-Yarn, Fullers-Earth, or other scouring Earths,
be sent or conveyed into the Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Sarck, or Alderney,
other then the proportions of Wool following, viz. Two thousand Tod for
Jersey, One thousand Tod for Guernsey, Two hundred Tod for the Isle of
Alderney, and One hundred Tod for the Isle of Sarck, which is to be employed
for the use and manufacture of the said Islands.

And for the better and more certain execution of this Our Will and Pleasure,
We do hereby likewise command, That no transportation of any Wool, Wool-Fells,
or other the Premises, be permitted into the said Islands, but upon good
Bonds, with sufficient Sureties, responsal and resident within this Realm; for
whose sufficiency, the Officers of Our Customs taking the same Bonds, will be
answerable for the landing of the same. In which Bonds the number and weight of
the Bags or Sacks of Wool, the number of Wool-Fells, and weight of
Woollen-Yarn, the quantity of Fulling Earth, and other scouring Earth shall be
set down. And the Governors and other Officers upon the said Islands, are
hereby required and straightly enjoined to take special care, That what Wool,
Wool-Fells, Woollen-Yarn, Fulling, or other scouring Earths, shall be so
landed, be not reshipped thence into any Foreign parts.

And for the better regulating of so much of the aforesaid Premises as shall
be permitted to be transported to the aforesaid Islands, We do further
straightly charge and command, That the same and every part thereof be shipped
only at Our Ports of Southampton, Weymouth, or Pool, and from no other Port,
Haven, Crak, or place whatsoever. And in case there be now in force any former
Licenses or Authorities heretofore given and granted by any of Our Predecessors
for Transportation of Woolls, or any other the Premises, We do hereby disannul
the same, and are resolved that none such shall be by Us granted for the future.

Lastly, For the better encouragement of all such as shall take care and pains
to disclose or make discovery of the frauds and other practices to evade and
defeat the true intention of this Our Proclamation, Our further will and
pleasure is, That every such person that shall be the first discoverer of such
Offender, shall be rewarded with the moiety, or one half of such sums of money,
and other forfeiture as shall come unto Us, by reason of any the offenses
aforesaid: Giving also charge and command, that all persons of what degree,
quality, or place soever, to whom it shall appertain, do diligently observe,
and readily assist the due performance of this Our Proclamation in all things.

Given at Our Court at Whitehal the Fifteenth day of September, in the Twelfth
year of Our Reign, 1660.
