THE CONFESSION OF Capt. George Baker, At the Place of EXECUTION, In
Justification of Mr. Stains, Druggist.
I Do here give it under my hand, and do own that I did endeavor to Rob
Esquire Man as he went to Newmarket upon the Heath, the last Michaelmas day was
twelve Month, and the Gentleman that he did accuse is not guilty, I think his
Name is Stains; I do this generously upon my own accord, without any deserts,
but to clear the Gentleman that is not guilty, as help me God in the Words of a
Dying Man.

March 3. 1684. Geo. Baker.

Memorandum, That I Samuel Smith, Ordinary of Newgate, being in company with
Samuel Stains, Citizen and Druggist of London, at the Execution of Captain
George Baker, on the Fourth of this instant March 1684. at Tyburn: The said
Captain Baker being acquainted that Mr. Stains was then and there present, was
desired to do him right in this particular: That whereas Mr. Jeremiah Man (as
Mr. Stains affirms) did bring an Indictment against the said Samuel Stains
for Assaulting him on Newmarket-Heath on Michaelmas day last past was a
Twelvemonth, with an intent to Rob him:

Captain Baker aforesaid, did at the said place of Execution declare openly to
all the People there present, that he the said Baker was the very Person who
did attaque Jeremiah Man, which did so much trouble his Conscience, that he
could not die in peace, without the declaring the Truth in that particular.

And also begged Mr. Stains pardon for all the trouble was given him for that
Fact, and desired him to pray for him. In witness whereof I set my Hand, the
day and year above-written.
