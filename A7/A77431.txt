A BRIEF DISCOVRSE OF THE PRESENT MISERIES OF THE KINGDOM: Declaring by what
practices the people of England have been deluded, and seduced into Slavery,
and how they have been continued therein, and by what means they may shake off
that bondage, they are now enthraled under.

Written by a lover of his Country, for the good of all such who are not
contented to be slaves, but desire to live Freemen.

A brief discourse of the present Miseries of the Kingdom, etc.
THe sad and deplorable condition of this unhappy Kingdom, is remarkeably
evident to all intelligent persons of all degrees, who have any share or
interest in the Commonwealth; and by all those who are honest as much
lamented. Yet every man is not sensible by what practices and endeavors, our
Laws have been subverted, or who have been the Authors, and contrivers of the
Kingdoms misery: or at least all men will not seem to understand, who have
blown the bellows to kindle this unnatural War, which has almost wasted and
consumed (although not in their persons, yet in their Estates) all the chief
Nobility, and Gentry of the Land. I have therefore out of my zeal, to rectify
those understandings, who are not wilfully blinded by their own ignorance and
folly, written this ensuing narrative; wherein is discovered, how, and by what
practices the Subjects of England have been seduced, and made the unhappy
instruments, to contribute to their own undoing: by which they may easily
discern, who have been the Authors, and contrivers of their misery: and may
hereby if they become sensible of their past errors, find a means to recover
their lost Liberty, and redeem themselves from the Slavery and Thraldom they
have so long endured.

No man is ignorant in how happy a condition this Kingdom was, before it was
destroyed by this unhappy Parliament; neither am I so partial to the foregoing
times, but that I could discern that there were faults then, for there was
pride, sloth, and covetousness in some of the Clergy, Bribery and corruption
in some of the Judges, partiality and selfe-interests in many Magistrates, an
aiming at an exorbitant power in the Court, managed to His Majesty's
disadvantage, by those He employed and trusted, who studied their own ends and
profits, without regard to His Majesty's Honor. These were the personal
crimes of men, which could not justly occasion complaint against the whole
frame and order of our settled constitution of Government, yet the offenses of
these evil Ministers, were accounted great grievances, and multiplied in their
number, and aggravated in their nature, by those Schismatics, who could not
make a rent and division in the Church Government, to which they were enemies,
because they were curbed and restrained by the Ecclesiastical power; and
hindered from introducing innovation into the Church, which they could not
effect, unless they first beget a distraction in the Civil Government. And
therefore there was no pressure put upon the people (and they counted all such,
whether legal, or illegal, if it concerned them in their purposes) but these
Schismatic people, presently put themselves in opposition against it, and by
that gained an opinion amongst the common sort (who are still of least
understanding) that those men were the chief Patriots: believing according to
their hypocritical demenors, that they had no indirect ends, but aimed only at
the good of the Commonwealth, and to maintain the Laws and Liberties of the
Subjects. These men having by these subtle insinuations, crept into the good
opinion of the vulgar people, the Clergy and Laity of the same Sect,
magnifying each the others integrity, and both deluding the ignorant people,
the one by an humble and feined piety, the other by pretending to a strict
observation of the Laws, in so much that the common people imagined that there
was no way left to recover the golden age, but by bringing these men into power
and Authority, and to make them the directors, and Governors both in Church
and State. Then was raised a general complaint that all things were out of
order, by reason we had no Parliaments called, but how to reduce His Majesty to
a necessity to call a Parliament, and to make that necessity such, as that He
might not be able to dissolve that Parliament: this was the study and practice
of these underminers of our happy and peaceable Government.

The people of England had been so long inured to Peace, and with it were
grown so rich, that it was difficult to stir them up to any commotion or
Rebellion: And therefore there must be some way found out by His Majesty's own
Instruments, and Ministers of State to disturb the Kingdom; and no man was
found so fit for this as the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose zeal to advance
the dignity of the Protestant Church within His Majesty's Dominions, by
reducing it to an uniformity, and decency in Gods worship, and by endeavoring
to increase the Wealth of it, that so the Clergy might not become
contemptible, was cherist in these pious endeavors, and became so passionate
in the pursuance thereof, being I am afraid a little transported with the
vanity of being styled the author of so glorious a work, that without mature
consideration he swallowed all proposals, that he imagined might conduce to so
good an end: And so became unfortunately engaged in the reforming of the
Scottish Kirk, by endeavoring to conform it to the Doctrine and Discipline
of the Church of England. In this undertaking I am confident his Lordship had
no end that aimed at any thing but Gods worship, but I have been on very good
grounds ascertained that those who put his Lordship on this work, had an
intention thereby to destroy the Bishops in that Kingdom; that so they might
be disposers of the Churches patrimony. This gave the first rise to our
miseries, for the Scots imediately oppose our Lyturgie, branding it as Popish,
and Superstitious, that Lyturgie which in the time of Queen Elizabeth, when
She protected them against the Invasions of the French, they embraced with all
reverence and thankfulness, and made use thereof in their Churches, as long
as they had need of the English Protection, and then it was neither Popish nor
Superstitious, but a most holy worship, divinely composed for the decent and
true honor of God: but they had not then been instructed in Mr. Calvin's
Doctrine, or at least knew not how to wrest it, and make use of it to throw off
obedience to Kings, as the true Protestant Religion had taught them to throw
off the usurpt Authority of the Pope.

Cardinal Richlieu, who was undoubtedly the most vigilant, and wisest
Counselor of this latter age; who industriously studied his Princes
advancement, and enlargements of his Dominions, and had been long studying and
contriving to disturb the Peace of England, and watching every opportunity to
do it, for he well knew as long as the King of England enjoyed Peace, he held
the balance of this part of Christendom, and by joining with any Prince in
opposition to the French King, would be able at any time to give a stop to his
increase of Empery, and restrain his enlargement of Dominion, which this
Cardinal aimed at: And for that cause he covetously embraced this occasion
offered by the Scots refusal of our Book of Common Prayer, and presently
endeavors to insinuate the Ancient League between their Nations, how willing
the French would be to assist them in the defense of their Religion, Laws and
Liberties; But the Language which the Scots best understood was the French
crowns, for that wise States man well knew, how little gold was generated in
that cold climate, and how affected that Nation was to that metal, for he
believed they might be purchased not only to forfeit their Allegiance but to
sell their God for that coin. And therefore he subtilely dispersed his crowns
amongst their poor Nobility, who received them with condition of Rebellion, but
yet durst not enter openly into an hostile opposition of their Kings commands,
until they were assured of a party in England, and therefore the Puritanicall
party of this Kingdom must be tampered withal, and accordingly were, and
found right for their turn; but these were but of the meaner sort of people,
and such as were not able to raise any considerable power to countenance their
undertakings. And therefore it was necessary that some eminent Lords should be
drawn into the Plot, of which there were not many, that were Puritannically
affected, and therefore they must seek to gain such who were discontented,
because they were not countenanced, and enjoyed offices and honors at Court,
to which their ambitions prompted them. This was by the industry of these men
effected, and accordingly diverse of the Nobillty were wrought upon to be of
this party, of which I believe diverse of them who looked not into the depth of
this Conspiracy, have since heartily repented; seeing, and now knowing, what
instruments they were made, to contribute to the ruin of this Kingdom. But
they understood His Majesty had money in his purse, and was beforehand with the
world, and until that was wasted and He become poor, there was no hope of
bringing Him to comply with their ends, and therefore there must be a show of
War, before a real War, and for this reason His Majesty must be persuaded to
carry an Army to the borders of Scotland, to compel the Scots to conformity,
and there He must have instruments to persuade Him to lie still, until His
stock of money was spent, Treating, and making, and receiving overtures of
Peace, which at last was concluded, and the observation thereof solemnly
protested to continue so long, until their Brethren in England were ready to
assist them, and then the Religious Scots had liberty to break all Oaths, and
Protestations, and Rebel again. And so shortly after they enter into England,
with a pretense to Petition His Majesty, but not to fight, but for their
safety. This Petition must be presented by an Army, and this Army must possess
themselves of Towns in England, and must have all things granted unto them,
which they could possibly desire, within the Kingdom of Scotland, and this
must be confirmed unto them by Acts of Parliament, wherein His Majesty must
divest Himself of all Regal power, and give up all into the hands of His
Scottish Subjects, to be at their disposal, which could not have been an ill
bargain for His Majesty, if He had had but some tie upon them to make good the
compact; for if an Earthquake should swallow up those that are perfidious of
that Nation, it could be no loss unto the Crown of England, unto which they
have ever been false and burthen-some: For what was there wanting to that
Nation, that they could desire from their native King? His bounty, affection,
and protection they were sufficiently sensible of, if they could be sensible of
benefits, but nothing can obliege them to hold their faith, or become grateful.

These Scots being in a hostile manner entered the Kingdom, whom all good
Subjects were bound to oppose and resist; it was so far from that, that those
Soldiers which His Majesty raised for that purpose were disheartened, and
discouraged, in their undertakings, and their Officers branded with the names
of Papists, and the Soldiers encouraged to mutiny against their Commanders.

The Scots being Invaders were welcomed, and to make it good that they were
Invited into the Kingdom, they were well recompensed for their pains. And no
doubt this money was given them that they might be ready on all occasions to
enter the Kingdom again when the Parliament should call for them to second
and assist them in their attempts against His Majesty: For truly now the
Parliament have a very fair pretense, to challenge the same grants from His
Majesty that the Scots have obtained, and they are sure of their Brethrens
assistance, for they desire that this Kingdom should be as far engaged in
Rebellion as themselves; for by that being become equal sharers in iniquity,
they are thereby mutually obliged to potect, and preserve each other against
the power of the King, whom they are bound to oppose and suppress, lest His
justice enabled by power, should overtake and punish their Traiterous Rebellion.

The Scots being now gone out of England, and His Majesty having been in
Scotland, and there according to His promises confirmed all by Act of
Parliament as aforesaid, He returned hither to assure His subjects here that He
was willing to do for them whatsoever they could demand for the good of the
Commonwealth, and by the presidents of having already condiscended unto more
then ever any of His Ancestors did for the Subjects, they are not at all
stirred up to a gratitude for His grace and favor already conferred, but are
thereby encouraged to make greater and higher demands, and must now invest
themselves with all Regal power and authority, and His Majesty must be but a
cipher, whilst they rule, govern, order and dispose all things at their
pleasure. And that they may the better gull and abuse the people, and so lead
them on to believe in them, they must in generals traduce the whole government,
the Church they must bespatter with Popery, and therein all decency must be
accounted Superstition, and the Bishops who labored for uniformity, and
punished non-conformists, must be branded with the names of Popish innovators,
and the chief crimes laid to their chare was Church Ornaments, which they
styled rags of the whore of Babell. Sure if God had commanded these reformers
to have built the Tabernacle or the Sanctuary, they would not have obeyed him,
but told him he was Popishly affected, and would have built him a Temple after
their own fancies and imaginations.

The Church being now the object of their furious zeal, the wisdom of this
grave Senate is not bound to particularize the faults therein, for so they
might come to be disputed, and might either in the reason and opinion of the
people prove no faults, or else by that course it might only produce a
Reformation, but that was not the Parliaments aim, for they endeavored to
throw the whole Kingdom into combustion, especially the Church Government, that
must be destroyed, that so they may therein frame a new Vtopian government,
agreeing with their phanatique zeal: The people greedy of novelties, willingly
embrace and entertain these changes, and with an easy credulity, believe all
scandalous reports that are by these men's factors and abettors, raised to
calumniate the Church, they doubt not if these men tell them so, but that there
lurkes Idolatry in a Tipet or a Surplice, and if these men incite the mad
multitde thereunto, they will presently disroable their Ministers of their
decent vestments, and for no other cause then that they are conformable to the
established Government of the Church of England, they will assist to drive them
from their Cures, and without any legal authority, to divest them of what they
are possessed of by the Laws of God and the Realm: if any Inhabitant within
those Parishes where these enormities were committed, was so conscientious as
that he would not adhere to these exorbitant courses, he was sure to be
presently branded with the name of Papist, or at least Popishly affected, and
that alone was sufficient to declare, that he was disaffected to the Parliament
proceedings, and must be presently new Christened by his Parliament
godfathers, with the nickname of Malignant, and Delinquent. And if this new
named creature does not forthwith seal up his lips, and not dare to speak or
mutter against those, who prosecute these illicit acts, a Messenger shall be
ready to fetch him to the Parliament, where in custody he shall attend at an
extraordinary charge their honors leisure, who by reason of the high and
weighty affairs of the Kingdom, cannot admit to hear so petty a complaint,
until this poor Malignants purse grows empty, and the Messenger has
sufficiently drained his pockets; and then peradventure he will carry him
before a Committee, where he shall be examined upon captions gueres, whereby he
may entrap himself, he shall neither know his accuser, nor his accusation, but
he shall be told in general, that he is a notable opposer of the Parliament,
and for that he shall be sure to be committed to some Prison, that so his
example of punishment may terrify others from daring and presuming to be
honest men. With this manner of proceeding, the most rational men, who
discovered and disliked these practices, were deterred from opposing them, and
those of the vulgar and ordinary rank of people, were persuaded by other
arguments, which were more prevalent on their understandings, which was
impunity and profit: for they were informed that they should neither pay
Tithes, nor be be subject to Ecclesiastical Courts: by this they were engaged
to take part with these new Reformers. But as yet the Parliament durst not
declare against the Common-Praier Book, for they thought the people were too
well inclined to that form of Worship, to be suddenly deprived thereof: And
therefore they declare that they intend not to abolish the Book of
Common Prayer, but by authority confirm the use of it throughout the Kingdom,
and withal they tell the people that it is a scandal raised by the Malignant
party to make them odious, to report that they intended any such thing as to
take away the Common Prayer Book, only there may be some things in it that
may be fit to be reformed; which hereafter with the advice of an Assembly of
Reverend Divines they mean to perform: Yet at the same time they connive at
such Ministers as leave it off, and suffer scandalous pamphleteers to traduce
that Sacred Lyturgie, abstracted from the Scripture, Composed by the most
Reverend, Learned, and pious Divines, and sealed by the blood of Martyrs: By
these Instruments they first undermine it, and afterward when they have
occasion to make use of their Scotch Brethren to Conquer the Kingdom, then
they are fitted with a packt Assembly, that must declare against the Book of
Common Prayer, as Popish and Superstitious, that so they may introduce a thing
called a Directory, that may bring them to a conformity with their Brethren in
Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline.

Now give me leave to tell you by the way, that these men who have so
universally changed, and altered the settled, and professed Protestant Religion
within this Kingdom, abused the people with telling them that His Majesty by
the advice of His evil Counselors, and assistance of the Bishops, meant to
change and alter Religion, by throwing a supposed infamy on His Majesty, which
they really intended afterward to effect themselves, as is manifest by the
sequel, for they have absolutely changed our Religion, and His Majesty
remains a constant perseverer in the maintenance of the old established form,
both of Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline; and I will be bold to affirm, that
the Kingdom is almost if not altogether, the unparalled president that have
Rebelled against their King, and fought, and destroyed the Nobility and Gentry
of their Kingdom, because they will not consent to introduce the Religion and
Laws of another Nation, and of such a Nation as Scotland, whose people for the
most part are not yet civilized, and for their rudeness, and poverty, are the
scorn and contempt of all Christendom.

This could not be that the gallant English should be so deluded, but that for
their sins God has infatuated them to be seekers of their own destruction.

This much by way of digression; The Parliament now finding the people so apt
to believe all that they suggest, they begin to decline, not only against His
Majesty in relation to Religion, but also accuse Him of misgovernment in Civil
affairs, but like the rest, they will not strike point-blanke at His Majesty,
but wound Him through His Ministers sides, telling the people, that He has
been misled by evil Counselors, and thereupon they frame a Remonstrance,
which I may call an appeal to the people, whereby they asperse and traduce His
Majesty by enumerating all the pressures, and supposed grievances, wherewith
the Subjects have been burdened, since His Majesty came to the Crown, and
they therein proceed so far as to accuse His Majesty's intentions, saying that
He intended to put an Excise upon his people. Every man imagined that they did
this to declare to the world what Taxes the Subjects groaned under, and no man
could suppose that the Parliament would multiply and increase these grievances,
and that they would impose an Excise upon the people, and so would induce that
into Act, which they pretend only was intentionally in His Majesty, but time
shows us otherwise, for now the little fingers of these Counselors are
weightier in oppressing the Subjects, then the loins of His Majesty's
Counselors.

The Freeborn Subject must be imprisoned, disseised of his Estate, and no
Legal cause shown, Taxes imposed, all things managed by Arbitrary power, and
no appeal but to them that do the injustice, this is part of the present
misery we groan under, but more of this in its due place.

The Parliament finding an inclination in His Majesty to reform all that is
amiss, and willing to comply with His Parliament in all that they can propose
for the good of the people, they grow fearful that if His Majesty be suffered
to comply with them so fast, all that is amiss in the Commonwealth will be
reformed too soon, and then there will be no work for them, but they must
return home, and become private men again, which is contrary to their
intentions; for they resolve to Lord it over their fellow Subjects perpetually,
which they cannot do, unless they devolve the Kingdom into greater miseries
and distractions, by contriving a Civil War within the bowels thereof: for the
effecting of which, they use all their art and industry to inslave the people,
by pretending that there is a Malignant party in the Kingdom of Papists, and
such as are Popishly affected, who are machinating treacherous plots against
them, by destroying of this glorious Parliament, which intends so much good to
the Commonwealth; and in the ruin of this Parliament, to bury all hopes of
future redress of our grievances.

These fears and jealousies are fomented amongst the people, by their active
instruments, who are especially those of the Clergy, and these by their
pretended sanctity of life easily gained credit amongst their simple auditors,
besides such as are divulgers of these reports, are directed to insinuate, that
His Majesty has a hand in these contrivances, by which obliquity He must be
represented as the object of the peoples fear, who ought to be the protector of
them and their Laws, and they the security of His Power and Person: By this,
distrust of His Majesty being begotten, and nourisht amongst the people, His
Majesty's Person, together with His Royal Consort and Children, are exposed to
all calumny and reproach; that so they may become contemptible. Yet
notwithstanding all these practices, which were the contrivances of particular
plotters in both Houses: yet there was a party of honest able Gentlemen in the
House of Commons, and the Bishops and some Noble Lords in the House of Peers,
that crossed and thwarted the proceedings of this violent party. How to remove
these was now the great endeavor, and the Bishops they must first be thrust
out of the House of Lords, and the better to effect this, the people they must
be stirred up to Petition the House of Commons, that the Prelates who by their
Votes in Parliament hindered the intended Reformation, might by an Act of
Parliament be excluded out of the House, and their Votes taken away.

And to the end that these people might not err in the form or manner of
Petitioning, they had good friends in the Parliament that could pen their
Petitions according to the sense of the House: these Petitioners were commonly
attended by a tumultuous rabble of the City and Suburbs, who were summoned to
meet together for that purpose, and although they came together, and flockt to
the Houses, more like an unlawful assembly of riotous, and mutinous persons,
who imperiously demanded, rather then humbly Petitioned for what they desired,
and therefore for their manner of coming, rather deserved to be reprehended
then cherisht, yet they were welcomed, and thankt for their great care of the
Commonwealth, and encouraged to draw together in such unlawful assemblies.

The Bill being now formed for the excluding the Bishops out of the House, they
press His Majesty to sign it, and that they may work Him thereunto, they make
use of all those Instruments about Him, who are either afraid to be lasht by
their exorbitant power, or else are desirous to partake with them in their
ways, and these who are truly the evil Counselors, obtain of His Majesty
to pass this Bill.

I wish with my soul His Majesty had never been betrayed by these evil
Instruments to do so ill an act as to deprive the Church of that power next
under Him should govern and protect it, and by their consent to wholesome Laws
in Parliament preserve their flocks from the ravenous Wolves that have since
devoured them.

I am no Lawyer to determine how essential a part of the Parliament the
Bishops were, but I believe they were one of the Estates that made up that
great body, and this I am sure is consonant to reason, for if each Member of
the Commonwealth be obliged to obey the Laws made in that Convention, because
they consent unto them by those who are present at the making of those Laws as
being Persons chosen by them by whose Votes they oblige themselves, I know no
reason that the Clergy who are so eminent a part of the Commonwealth, should
not have fit persons by them chosen to sit and Vote likewise in the House, by
whom their consent unto all Laws might be included.

And it will appear a strange irregular course in the opinion of foraine
Nations, and that which will be a dishonor and a disparagement unto this
Kingdom, that the doctrine and discipline of our Church, is subverted, and
that we have in a manner a new Religion framed, and no Clergyman has either
an affirmative or a negative Vote in the composure; an Assembly of Divines
being picked out and packt together by no lawful authority, and only made use
of to color out and countenance the acts of those who are altogether Laymen.

It will seem strange hereafter when these proceedings shall be maturely heard
and debated, that it should appear that a business of so high a nature as the
dispossessing the Bishops of their just rights should be transacted, and that
those who are parties should be made their Judges, to condemn without hearing
those who are so eminently their Superiors both in degree and dignity: but it
is now too apparent to all the world what it was that provoked this violent and
irregular prosecution, the end being that these Reformers might rob the Church
of that patrimony which the piety of their Ancestors had invested the Bishops
withal.

And it will be well if the legislative power which these men exercise can
secure them from being guilty of sacrilege, and quit them at the dreadful
Tribunal from horrid impiety.

Those honest and able Noblemen and Gentlemen who were chosen and trusted by
their Countries, and whose tender consciences scrupled at these injurious and
impious proceedings, and according to the dictate of their reasons dissented
from these unjust and irregular actions, these were traduced amongst the people
as members Popishly affected, and not fit to continue in the Houses.

And to deter them the more, the rabble and scum of the people were brought
down often to Westminster, and there were taught to know those men that opposed
their Faction, and to revile them with scurilous and opprobrious language, and
so to menace them as they thought it not safe for them to stay longer in the
Houses, especially after they had with the like Tumults driven away His Majesty
from White Hall, the Protector of them and the Laws being chased out of the
Town, there was little security left for those Subjects who did desire to
regulate their actions by the Law, when their King that should maintain the
Law, and unto whom all His Subjects did owe and had sworn obedience, could not
secure Himself from the insolence and violence of the enraged multitude.

Sure all this while the people were in a dream, or else they could not have
been drawn so madly to violate all Law, and to contribute to their own undoing.

For, by driving away these sober and temperate men from the Parliament, and
His Majesty from their protection, they put all Power and Authority into the
hands of furious Schismatiks, and submitted themselves and their Estates to be
disposed by them, whose phrenaticall spirits never knew temper and moderation
in any of their actions.

By their Votes and Ordinances the Kingdom is immediately thrown into all
disorder and distemper, unlimited tyrannous regal authority usurpt by
Subjects, who like Phaeton gotten into the Suns Chariot set all the world on
fire, it never happening otherwise but that when such unskilful Pilots get to
the helm, all Passengers are shipwrackt on the rocks. So it fell out with
these men, as how could it be otherwise imagined, that Shopkeepers and poor
mechanique Tradesmen (for such were the major part that were left in the House
of Commons) should be able to manage and dispose the great affairs of the
Kingdom. I do not say that all the House of Commons consisted of such, for
there were some cunning Contrivers left in the House, who either out of malice
to the present settled Government, or envy that they were not preferred to
eminent Places and Offices at Court, at which their ambitions aimed, who guided
and governed the rest of the Members to consent unto, and Vote what they
designed for the disturbance of the Commonwealth.

These having driven away His Majesty, and also their fellow Members that
opposed them, it was now necessary that they should still infuse fears and
jealousies into the hearts of the people, thereby to prevent that they may not
return unto their wits and settled judgment: For, then their Treasons would be
unmasked, and their Plots and contrivances discovered, and then the people
would fall upon them as the Authors of their misery.

To avoid this, these cunning Artists shifted the scene, and according to the
common Proverb, cried Whore first. And divulged that His Majesty intended to
raise War against His Parliament, whereas the truth was, they intended to raise
a War against His Majesty, and to this purpose all the lies that the Devil the
Author of lies could invent, were printed and published by their allowance,
Papists every where mustered invisible Armies under ground, and forain Forces
were landed in every Port, and daily intelligence pretended to be brought to
the House of strange Massacres intended for the cutting the throats of all
their Members, especially the most eminent, they were aimed at to be destroyed:
and yet all these pretenses could hardly prevail with the people inured to
long peace and quiet to put themselves into Arms, and therefore they would not
rely on the giddy multitude, although they had incensed them with strange
malicious reports, which was, that His Majesty's Commissions of Array which He
directed into the several Counties of the Kingdom to muster the Forces
thereof for the preservation of their peace according to an ancient and known
Law, was intended for their ruin and destruction, and thereby to subject them
unto a tyrannical and arbitrary power, whereby they should be robbed of their
Estates, and enslaved in their persons. This rumor wrought much with the
ignorant multitude, yet not so much as that the Parliament would build upon
this foundation, an assurance of protection from the people, but would make use
of the peoples affections and inclinations toward them as a good second to
their maine support, which was an Army of mercinary Soldiers, raised by His
Majesty's consent, to suppress the Irish Rebellion, but employed by these men
to fight against his Majesty, and upon the forementioned pretenses to destroy
Him and all those who adhere unto Him, out of their Loyalty, and the conscience
of the duty they owed Him: The horrid acts committed by the barbarous Irish, in
massacring the poor Protestants in Ireland, was so strong a motive to engage
people to take arms to suppress those Rebels, and revenge their injuries,
that every man was willing to undertake that War, little thinking that the
design of Ireland should only be made the pretense, whilst a Civil War in
England was principally intended.

And if men were not stupidly ignorant, they might still discern, that the
Irish War is kept on foot, without intention to end the same by a vigourous
undertaking of it, that so they may have a pretense still to leavy and keep
Soldiers here in England, thereby to oppress the people by their Taxes, and
enslave them by their power.

For if this had not been their end, why would they not permit His Majesty who
was willing at first in Person to undertake that War, to be the manager
thereof, as it did properly belong unto Him? why did they impose such hard
conditions on those poor people? wherein the innocent with the guilty were all
involved, disposing of their Estates, and selling of it to Merchant
Adventurers, before they begun the War, thereby rendering the people desperate,
by leaving no gap open, whereby they might enter by way of Treaty, mercy or
accommodation? Why do they now proceed so slackly in that War, by sending over
inconsiderable Forces, and starving those before they recruit them by fresh
supplies? or why have they taken such care, and used such industry to dissolve
all Treaties, which His Majesty's pious endeavors framed to compose the
differences in that Kingdom? unless they intend still to continue and prolong
that War, that so they might have specious pretenses from thence to enslave and
poverish the people here.

But now Forces being raised for Ireland, they did delay the sending of them,
alleging that His Majesty seduced by evil Counselors, was raising an Army to
fight against the Parliament, and to enthrall His Subjects, depriving them of
their just rights and Liberties, and therefore these Soldiers with as many
more as they were able to raise, must be employed to fight against the
Cavelieres, for with that honorable appellation, they were pleased malitioufly
and ignorantly to style all those, whose Loyalties prompted them to adhere unto
His Majesty.

Being now resolved upon a War, their next study was how to be assured of the
sinews thereof, MONEY, and they find the certainest means to be furnished
with that metal, is to engage the City in their Rebellion, whose purses
overflowed with abundance, indirectly gotten by false light Wares, Weights, and
Measures, and therefore it was not unlikely that what was gotten by the cunning
of the Devil, might be exhausted to be spent by his ministers: but yet the
knave and his money are not so soon parted as the fool and his money, and
therefore they must use some artificial, and cunning suggestions, to divorce
the Citizen from his God.

And therefore first, they sell him very cheap pennyworths of Land in Ireland,
and having once bit at that bait, and disburst some money for that purchase, it
was easy to persuade him to shoot one arrow after another, until he be drawn
by the perusal of a fair survey, with the title confirmed by an Ordinance of
Parliament, to buy the Manor of Hell with the fishing of Styx, and the ferry
of Charon. Else who would imagine that there could be a generation of Christian
people so given over to work wickedness, without any the least show of legal
title, or justice for their warrant or security, that could be induced to
purchase other men's Estates, nay to purchase that Land which the Religion and
piety of our Ancestors conferred on the Church, nay that these Sacrilegious
villains, ravenous birds of prey, can unplume the Sacred birds of Paradise and
pride it in their feathers, exposing the reverend Clergy naked to the frozen
charity of these unchristian times?

Pride and plenty are the diseases of this City, and War which by bloodletting
cures this sickness must do it; but there is a great deal of hazard in it,
the remedy being commonly worse then the disease; for some time it kills in
stead of curing, and most times it so ruins and destroys the fabric, and
constitution of health, that it leaves a weak, miserable, and consumptive body
ever after.

In all ages of the world this has been experimentally manifested, and I wish
it may not be prophetically now spoken of this City. For all the flourishing
and most famous Cities of the world, when their pride and luxury had debaucht
them into such sins as London is guilty of, they have been at last miserably
swallowed in the ruins of that War, which their own Rebellion first begot.

But the Parliament now had their ends, which was to engage the City as deeply
in this Rebellion as themselves; for so they became masters of their Estates,
and so were enabled to manage and continue the War at their pleasures. And
truly it was no difficult task for them to go through with their
undertaking, for now being possessed of the money bank (the City mines) they
could do all things.

There the Army is now raised, and wants nothing now but a popular General to
conduct this Army. Essex, who being scorned, laughed at, and contemned at Court
amongst the Lords, for his disability, being angry at his slighting, he was
thought fit to be the man, for upon his Fathers score, no merits of his own,
he was esteemed amongst the people: besides, he was bold and blockish, so his
confidence might lead him into action, and his ignorance not discover their
artifice that employed him: By this he appeared to be a fit subject for their
election, and rejection at pleasure, and accordingly afterward they used him,
rejected him, and scorned him, when he had served their turns.

The Army being now raised and marched, both was done under the specious pretext
of fighting for the King, to bring Him to His Parliament, and to withdraw Him
from His evil Counselors, to reside with His great Council, who intended to
make Him a GREAT and GLORIO10

S KING. A Battle is fought pretended for the King, where His Majesty opposed
them in Person, and their undistinguishable bullets let fly against His
Majesty, the Prince and Duke of York, and yet all this was still pretended for
the safety of His Person: in this Battle it pleased God to protect His
Majesty, that He came off with Honor and safety, for He kept the field, took
diverse Colors, and some Cannon. Yet this must be other ways represented to
the City, and those who pretended to be in the Battle, but were indeed hid in
Sawpits, must be instructed to make ample narratives at the Guild Hall, thereby
to gull the City with an opinion of a Victory, lest they should be disheartened,
and so withold their contribution.

It is most true His Majesty lost gallant men there, and it could not be
otherwise, for He had none but such in His Army, and playing like a prodigal
gamester, gold to brass, it must of necessity follow, that by the chance of
War, He must lose some of the Nobler metal, by adventuring it on that odds.

But His Majesty went on with his design, and took Banbury, which His enemies
durst not attempt to hinder, and from thence marched toward London, and having
beaten the enemy at Branford, might undoubtedly have pursued His success into
the City, where certainly he had then a strong party to have assisted Him, but
His Party restrained Him, being unwilling to expose that rich City, to the fury
and rapine of the greedy Soldier. His Majesty therefore retreated unto Oxford,
where He might study that Logique which the Parliament had taught Him, which
was, how Subjects might fight against their King, for His preservation: but
finding not learning enough there to instruct Him in this strange and unheard
of doctrine, He takes the field again, and sometimes winnes, and loses
according to the hazard of Battles. Yet at last He grew so successful, that
our Brethren of Scotland were called to the aid and assistance of their
distressed friends here.

And now the solemn League and Covenant was contrived, and these accursed
Traitors as they had abandoned their Loyalty, so they must swear to forsake
their Religion, thereby to engage the Scots to their assistance. This
accordingly they perform, and so a Scottish Army is brought into the Kingdom,
hired by these miscreants at the price of their Religion, to gnaw out the
bowels of their native Country: by the help of these and their money, and by
the evil conduct, emulating pride, and perfidious treachery of His Majesty's
Officers they prevail, reduce the whole Kingdom to their obedience, and at
last purchase His Majesty who was fled to the false Scots for His protection,
and refuge, and by them to the dishonor of their Nation be it ever spoken, and
with this Character of ignomy and infamy, let them be branded to all posterity,
who had any share therein: His Majesty was treacherously and basely delivered
up into the hands of His Rebellious and disloyal Subjects, who in so many
several Battles had sought His life, and therefore could not be imagined but
that they would expose Him to contempt, and as they have robbed Him of His
Liberty, when they found it necessary or convenient for them, would deprive him
of his life also.

I have now brought the Parliament, or rather they have brought themselves to
the highest degree of power and Sovereignty; I beseech every man seriously to
weigh and consider by what means and instruments they have ascended to this
Supreme height, each step by which they have climbed have been multiplied
Treasons, new in their invention, unparalled in their condition, sins of the
blackest nature have been their props and supports, the fowlest impieties, and
the most irreligious practices, the basis and foundation of all their
structure: public faith they have prostituted like a common whore, and taught
her to pick the pockets of her fornicators: Lying and perjury has been the
untempered mortar they have daubed withal: Murder, Theft, and Rapine, has
been the chief materials they have wrought withal. But lest you should
imagine me too invective, although I speak nothing but the truth, I will give
you my observations of the difference, between the present and preceding
times, wherein if every indifferent understanding be not able to discover a
remarkable disparity, and how we are declined into a much worse condition then
formerly we enjoyed; I must conclude he wilfully shuts the eyes of his reason,
lest he should be made sensible of that ignorance he has lived in, or be found
guilty of conniving at those plots and practices which during this Parliament
have been used, to ruin and destroy his Country.

It were enough to let you see the difference, if I only tell you the Kingdom
before this Parliament enjoyed peace, and that it is now embroyled with a
Civil War: but I shall address my self more particularly to each man's
understanding; and in the first place I shall begin with our Religion, which
was so reformed and settled in this Kingdom, as that it was an honor unto our
Nation, a fear and terror unto the Romish party, and the hope and wish of all
Protestant Churches beyond the Seas, that they might be rendered in a capacity
to imitate us; for we had excluded the novell introductions and superstitious
fopperies of the Papists, and yet retained a decency of order and Divine
worship in our Churches, such as would not admit of parity to confound, or
fancy to disturb the wel-composed harmony in the government of the Church.

That God, who is the God of Order, and is delighted in it, as appears by the
consent and union in the Creation, and disposing of all things, was here served
with Order and Reverence; Humility was the Garment we put on when we entered
into the holy places, expressed by our humble Gestures and civil Comportment in
the time and place of Adoration, and each degree according to his eminency had
that duty and respect paid him, which was due according to the superiority of
his calling, from his inferior and subordinate Officers.

A remedy was provided for each inconvenience, and no crime could escape
unpunished, unless by the corruption of the Judge, and that nothing can
prevent; for whilst Jugdes are men, some of them will still be wicked and
corrupt, and private passions and interests will lead them to connive at
offenses, or to pass indirect and unjust Sentences, according to their
affections and relations. We had as many eminent and learned men in the Kingdom
as any Age ever produced, and the Universities and Innes of Court as
flourishing in their several Professions as ever they were. The Word and the
Sword, Religion and Justice, were equally administered through the Kingdom; each
man knew where, and how to pray according to the Pattern and Form prescribed
by our Savior, and to join with united hearts and voices in the most sacred
and best composed Lyturgie of the world. The first rudiments of Christian
Religion were learned by heart, by being only Auditors and Assistans at our
Church service. The Lords Prayer, the Greed, and the ten Commandments, which
are the principles of Christian Religion, was a part of our Lyturgie; and we
are daily taught how to praise God for the benefits we had and did daily
receive, and how to pray unto him for the supply of our wants. And sure, on
these two maine pillars of Praise and Prayer, the structure of Religion is
erected.

This was the Sacrifice we offered three or four times a day in our Cathedrals,
and at least as many times a week by injunction in our ordinary Churches; and
now this sacred Offertory which by Act of Parliament was Enjoined, by Ordinance
is Abolished, as if it were a crime to serve God in any other form or method
then the two Houses shall prescribe. Instead of this Decency and Uniformity,
what confusion is introduced is obvious to every man; how these divine Collects
are enforced to give place to extempore Nonsense, and the admirable composed
Prayers extracted out of the most patheticall parts of the Scripture, must be
banished the Church, whilst Heresies and Blasphemies are planted within the
walls of the Church, whereby whole Congregations are infected and become
Separatists in their tenants. Pious, Religious, and Orthodox Ministers are
Voted out of their Free-holds, and violently ejected, because they will not be
perjured, and conform to worship the Presbyterian Idol, or the Independent
Monster, these novell Reformers would set up. And in the Cures of these
Reverend Divines for the most part, ignorant Non-conformists and factious
Schismatiques are placed, by which they have new modeled the Church, and
settled therein fit Chaplains for such Patrons, who must instruct the people to
believe nothing to be Orthodox Divinity but what they read unto them out of a
Parliament Ordinance, or a City Diurnall. And if they can but continue the
people in this slavish Ignorance, to forget their duty to God, and their
Loyalty to the King, and to submit by an implicit faith to the power of the
Parliament, then their great work is done; for all their great labor is to
keep up their Diana the Parliament, and to keep the people from knowing that it
is the Devil that utters those Oracles which are vented from that Shrine. But
sure the Blood of those Martyrs who have suffered for good Consciences, and
have either dyed in Prisons, or for want been starved abroad, being unjustly
robbed by these merciless men of all their Estates and Lively-hoods; cry loud
for vengeance, and will one day awaken the patience of our long suffering God:
And draw down his revenging wrath on these counterfeit Zealots, and impious
Hypocrites, who have indeed really no Religion, but only make use of that
sacred Cloak to disguise all their villainy. For what have these great Reformers
done, but introduced will worship into the Church, and Lawlesnesse in the
Commonwealth? For who can now discover the face of any Church in this Kingdom?
where every several Congregation use a distinct form of worship, and where
there is no Coercive power to compel Uniformity in Doctrine, or to punish
Deformity in manners. The sacred Scripture is profaned, and by the Liberty each
man appropriates to himself to Interpret according to his own Fancy, or rather
to apply that divine writing to serve for the advancing his own designs; the
sense thereof is so inverted by these Scripturists, who use it no other ways
then the Devil did to entrap and circumvent their hearers; so that those
divine Oracles which were bequeathed us, to instruct us in the right way to
Heaven, are by these lying Prophets become bypath that lead to destruction.
Our Laws which are each Subjects Birthright, how miserably are they
perverted? what man can now be secured in his inheritance or possession, being
so enslaved and subjected to an Arbitrary power? when by a Vote of the House of
Commons we are dispossessed of all that we enjoy, and if we plead our title and
appeal to any Court of Judicature, expecting Justice according to the known
Laws of the Land, our proceedings are obstructed by some Order from the House
of Commons, or one of their Ordinances, (of which they have made so many, that
they know not what they have made; and besides, diverse of them are
contradictory in themselves) and by these, without dispute, we are debard of
our legal Rights.

This is now our miserable condition, that we know not what we may call our
own, or how to preserve those ancient Inheritances descended from our
Predecessors: for it is in the power of a Knave to style an Honest man and a
Loyal Subject either Malignant or Delinquent; new terms in the Law, invented
this blessed Parliament; and to inform this underhand to a Committee, where
himself dares not publicly appear to avow his information, or to be cross
interrogated concerning his accusation; and this is sufficient to turn a man
out of all his Estate, expose his Wife and Children to beggary, and no way left
to repair this injurious proceeding, but by appealing to them that do the
wrong: whence it is probable you may expect equal justice, when your Judges
have equally divided your Estate amongst them: For Informers they share with
Sequestrators, Sequestrators they share with Committee Men, and Committee Men
they share with the Members of the House, who are their great Masters that
protect them against all complaints in the House of Commons; and thus the
honest Countryman, who knew no offense in maintaning his Allegiance which he
was bred in, and had sworn unto his King; is taught by suffering to conform to
what he understands not, nor his rulers declare not, the inscrutable
unlimitable Privileges of Parliament: from offending whereof he is no sooner
cleared by submitting to a large Fine, but that he is presently subject again
to the like mischief, if he obeyes the Law of the Land, or the malice of his
neighbor prosecutes him. Rebels and Traitors shall be protected to rob and
plunder by Ordinance of Parliament, and honest men and Loyal Subjects shall be
ruined and destroyed for adhering to the Established Religion and the known
Laws.

I will appeal to every honest Countryman, whether he were not in a much
better condition when he was unacquainted with the terms of Plunder,
Free Quarter, and Contribution, when he understood not the iniquity of a
Sequestrator or a Committee, but upon occasion of any injury done him, had
immediate recourse to the next neighbor, the Justice of Peace, where he
complained, and had redress according to a known Law: When he went to Church,
and knew how to Pray, and had good life and manners taught him out of the
Pulpit, and not Parliament Orders and Declarations read every Sunday which he
understands not; when holy Feasts were kept and observed, by which he was
taught the History of the Church, and Martyrologie of the Saints, at which time
Hospitality was observed, and thereby Amity and Friendship maintained and
continued amongst neighbors.

These were the blessings of peace; what has succeeded instead of this, they
have fresh in memory: I need not particularize, but I am sure they have,
according to the old proverb, removed out of Gods blessing into the warm
Sun: for I am sure they have changed Peace and Plenty into War and Poverty:
by which, as they sowed, they are assured to reap the unpleasant fruits of
their labor. I am confident, if men are not mad, and possessed with such a
spirit of Frenzy, as that they cannot discern between Good and Bad,
False-hood and Truth, Religion and Irreligion; they must needs confess, that
all they have done or acted for six or seven years last past, wherein they
have complied with the Parliament, they have endeavored to advance evil,
false-hood, and irreligion, thereby to destroy themselves and their
Posterities, and to make themselves slaves to the Arbytrary wills and powers of
the usurped Authority of their fellow subjects; by which they are not masters
of their own Estates, but at the wills and pleasures of those they have set
over them. And let them ingenuously judge of their own actions, and then they
will confess that they have wilfully perjured themselves in forfeiting their
Allegiance to their Sovereign, for no profit or advantage to themselves, but
to render themselves in a worse condition of Slavery and Vassallage then ever
they were in, for now they are disposable at the wills and pleasures of their
fellow subjects, as their absolute Vassalls and Slaves, and can call nothing
their own, when they, that is, the House of Commons have a desire to call for
it. For this is a Maxim in our new reformed Government, that all we possess,
belongs to the State, and that when the State bath occasion to make use of it,
all is at their disposal. O happy Subjects! what a blessed Government have you
fought for! no doubt the whole Christian world will admire your Ignorance, but
not follow your Example, for that were to become fools like you, and from
being Subjects free and happy under a gracious King, to make themselves Slaves
to their Fellow Subjects, as you have done to M. Ash the Clothier, M. Martin
the Atheist, M. Blackston the Peddler, M. Birch the Carrier, and therest of the
Reverend rabble, of which the House of Commons is now composed. Oh you Subjects
of England! if you have any sense of your own miseries entaile them not to your
Posterities, but at length rouse up your selves, and shake off the servile youk
you have drawn in, return in zeal to your God and his Worship, in duty to your
King and his Just Rights, in love to your Country and your Legal liberty and
vindicate your selves from those aspersions which now lie heavy on you, and
make the King (according to your Protestation) a great and a glorious King,
your selves free from Slavery; and make the Parliament know, they are but your
Fellow Subjects, trusted by you, and that you will call them to an account,
wherein they have exceeded their Commission.

And when you dare to become so bold, as to call the Parliament to account for
their past actions; ask them whether you gave them any Authority to destroy
the Church, to extirpate Episcopacy, root and branch, to abolish Common
Prayer, to exclude you from the blessed Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords
Supper, to introduce a form of Marrying and Burying into the Church, fitter
for Pagans then Christians, to remove the Ten Comandements, written with the
Finger of God, out of the Church, and to place instead thereof, their
new-invented damned Covenant? After them, whether you gave them Authority to
levy War against your King, and to pursue Him, and endeavor to kill Him,
because He would not perjure Himself by taking that Covenant, contrary to the
Oath He took at His Coronation? Whether you gave them Authority to imprison
Him, etc? Ask them, whether you gave them Authority to overthrow all Laws,
according to their will and pleasure, and to usurp to themselves, nay, to
exceed Regal power, and to dispose of your Persons and Estates as they think
fit? Ask them for an account of all the Money they have raised out of your
Estates? Ask them concerning all things that have been done amiss in the
Kingdom during their reign, either by their command or tolleration; and if
they cannot give you very good satisfaction in all the particulars, proceed
against them as guilty of the breach of the trust you reposed in them, and
punish them according to their deserts; or if in Clemency you think fit to
pardon them, at least remove them from their Rule and Government; and let not
those, who have so ill behaved themselves in the discharge of their trust, be
any longer employed by you, but humbly desire His Majesty to call another
Parliament, and desire that you may have free leave to choose new Members, in
whose honesty you have better hopes. This may be a way to re-setle the
Kingdom, and restore our Peace, else we shall all be miserable: for if these
Parliament men continue to govern us, who have designed themselves Princes,
and us their Slaves, what can we expect but by our own consents, to be made
despicable?

It was the cunning of the Church of Rome when she intended to become
Catholic, and rule over all her sister Churches, when she introduced novell
superstitions which she was taxed for, and could not justify; She still
maintained her errors by the power she invested her self withal, which was,
that what the Church declared either in doctrine or discipline, ought not to be
contradicted or disputed, for the Church of Rome was the sole interpreter of
Scriptures, and where they were not able by their glosses and interpretations,
to justify and defend their Tenants, they had un-written tradictions, which on
all occasions supported their doctrines.

Is it not so with the Parliament, I mean the House of Commons, for that
usurpes the whole power of the Parliament, (the Lords being become no ciphers
but blankes in their accounts) do not they invest themselves with a Sovereign
power, apropriating sole dominion unto themselves, and that nothing is Law, but
what they declare to be so? and if any act of theirs be questioned to be done
contrary to the known Law, have they not an unknown Law, one of their
unwritten verities, which are as necessary and useful as the Popish
traditions, to justify them in their erroneous proceeding? have they not their
Parliament privileges, which is their Catholocon, a medicine for all diseases,
a principal help at Mawe, by which they always with the prize, for by virtue
of this mystery of iniquity, they defend and maintain all their illegal
actions, and are protected from all inquiry into their proceedings, by telling
the people it is a breach of their Privileges.

But I wish the same course were taken with the Parliament, that our Protestant
Divines took with the Church of Rome, to enquire when those superstructures
were built in the Church, so when these Privileges were begotten in the
Parliament; and then it would appear, that those privileges were illegitimate,
begotten by Rebellious parents, and nursed up in factious times, and that the
Law of the Land neither ownes them, nor knows them. Let the Parliament be
required to produce some good authors, that have aunciently written concerning
their fundamental Laws, which they so often mention, and of their unbounded
Privileges, which they so often make use of: that the people may know that
they are not their own inventions, that they are not fictions and chimaer as
to delude the vulgar, and to disguise the truth, and bluster out their own
iniquities: Let them show how an Ordinance becomes a Law, or is able to destroy
the Law: Let them declare where that privilege is that protects a Parliament
man to commit Felony, or Treason, and that it is a breach of privilege to
indict him for it. Let them produce Records that are authentical, that divdes
the power from the Person of the King, and incorporates that Power into the
House of Commons. Let them show in any times that the House of Commons ever
disposed of the Militia of the Kingdom, usurped authority to make Peace or
War, and to contract leagues with foreign States, to condemn or pardon, to
make Judges to dispose of the Kings Revenue, to Imprison the King Himself,
etc. Nay was it ever heard or read of, that a Speaker of the House of Commons,
an inconsiderable contemptible person for his birth and breeding, should
arrogate to himself, and assume by the permission of that House the ensigns of
Regal Authority, and usurp the Kings Chair and cloth of State, and give
public audience to Ambassadors? Oh unheard of arrogance, never to be
paralleled by precedent or future presidents, and cannot be exceeded, unless
by that of the Devil who attempted to be like the highest.

Let these exorbitances suffice to put the Kingdom in mind what pressures
have been put upon them, what usurpations the two Houses, (but especially the
House of Commons) have injustly arrogated to themselves, and then let them
consider how they are robbed of their just rights, and into what a slavery they
are inthral'd, and whether they have not slept those years past, whilst the
Devil and his instruments have sown these tares amongst their good corn, and
so spoiled the plentiful harvest, they hoped to reap by this Parliament; and
that they must be compelled to hazard to pluck up the tares, though therewith
the good corn be endangered, for the field must be cleansed, to sow and prepare
for a new crop, else in a short time the people of this Kingdom will be
starved for want of Bread.

I could enlarge my self further on this subject, for there is no want of
matter to swell this discourse into a volume, but I resolved not to make my
Countrymen more miserable, by enumerating too many of their miseries, or by
paraphrasing on them, Rhetorically argue them into too deep a sense of their
Sufferings; it shall suffice me, if they become sensible of their present
condition, and thereby endeavor a Manumission from their Slavery, that they
remember what they were, what they are, and what they ought to be, and as true
borne Englishmen, shake off their Fetters, with the same hands they have
imposed them, depose the Tyrant Parliament, and Re-inthrone their lawful
Sovereign, expel Rebellious Presbytery, and establish moderate and limited
Episcopacy, provide for tender consciences who will conform in obedience to
Civil Magistracy, and then no doubt we shall return to a settled Government,
and Peace will be restored with plenty, and we shall again be a happy and
united people, as formerly, under our gracious King, whom God preserve.

FINIS.
