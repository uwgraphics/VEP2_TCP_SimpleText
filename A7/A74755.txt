THE IRISH MASSACRE; OR A true Narative of the Unparalleled Cruelties
exercised in IRELAND upon the BRITISH Protestants, etc.
THat causeless Antipathy which uses to administer unavoidable endless matter
of dispute betwixt Magistracy and Populacy, betwixt those which command, and
those which obey, has in all ages and countries proved fatal, and productive
of sad events. This is imputed almost by all Politicians (being no other
commonly then Court Parasites) to the fault of those many, whose lot it is to
be subjected to government, upon pretense that these never think their liberty
loose enough; but for my part my reason rather leads me to impute the fault
hereof to those few, which are entrusted with government, forasmuch as these
scarce ever think their authority full enough. For that end which the
diffusive body of the people aims at is probably its own weal, and this is
no improper or just end, nor is it at all inconsistent with the true weal and
happiness of those, which are placed above them: but that good which
Commanders in chief aim at, oftentimes extends no further then to their own
persons, or families, and this ever remains improper, or unjust, because it
cannot stand with the welfare of those which are placed below them. Irrational
creatures by instinct of Nature are directed to that which is their peculiar
good: wherefore if we degrade the multitude to a brutish condition, if we deny
them reason, and if under the name of multitude, we comprehend also all that
are not invested with supreme power: yet unless we will deny them natural
instinct too, we cannot suppose them utterly incapable of that benefit and
assurance which a well tempered polecy holds forth to them. And if the gross
number be not held so intelligent, as authority makes those which sit at the
Stern, yet this hinders not, but that the gross number may act as regularly
and pursue as just ends, as those which are deeper read in politics. And as
for story, and antiquity, in all my reading I could never yet find one
precedent, where the generality of a State convened or represented in an
orderly form, did unjustly quarrel or unlawfully capitulate with their Lords,
but the contrary is most remarkable every where, Quicquid delirant reges, etc.
In these Civil wars, which now infest England, Scotland and Ireland, much
has been pleaded in behalf of the Kings Prerogative, and much Rhetoric has
been used to lay the blame upon the Subjects disloyalty, and some think that
in this war there is an intervention of some new matter, never before
precedented or paralleld in any Age. But in my conceit, the first moving cause
which imbroyles us all, is the same pretense of Soveraignity, which has always
produced the like effects else where, and though the King seem to disowne the
Irish, as not Isntrumental to his purpose, and the Irish disownes us, as not
concurring with their projections; yet still there is no Novelty in the
business, besides a more artificial and dark disguise, then formerly pieces
of this nature have been covered with. Diversity of Religions has been a
wicked means to heighten enmity amongst our Nations, and is become an
expedient which the Court makes great use of for a vizard to its designs; but
diversity of Religions has been long favored at Court, and therefore we may
conclude it is but subordinate to that cause for which it was so favored. The
Irish now murder us for aspiring to that liberty, which they themselves claim
with less moderation then we do, not that they think us enemies to their
liberty but to their Religton, nor because they are enemies in truth to our
liberty but to our Religion. Nevertheless Religion, as Religion is not the
supreme motive, or incentive of the Irish n this deadly feude: for the true
Religion (which is but one and contented with a small train) may be loved for
it self, by such as are truly zelots to it; whereas all false religions, and
all false professors of the true Religion have other engagements then mere
conscience. To pass by the vulgar therefore or common herd of people, which
are but passive, as the waves are under the winds, and which do but borrow
Religion from education merely, and naturally are most docile in that religion
which is accompanied with the greatest present temporal emoluments: if we
look upon the primary active party in Ireland (whatsoever their nugatory
simulatory pretexts were, for the Kings Prerogative) the true intent of their
insurrection was the enlargement of the Romish faith, and their zeal to that
faith was only inflamed by the many civil advantages which seemed attendant
upon it. Popery has now long since been discovered to be an imposture or
nothing else but a sly sophisme, to establish Empire in the long Robe, and
wrest it from such as they account secular men, and as the Priests and Jesuits
have been the maine Incendiaries in all our differences, so we well enough
know what their particular Interest was therein.

It Is strange that any Princes, especially such as are capacious, and
intelligent should think it any addition of Royallty to them in the State to
admit of a Superior in the Church, and to stoop to any rivallity of dominion
(though distinguished, and blancht over with the Epithet of spiritual) but it is
more prodigious in Protestant Princes. Yet we must take notice Popery is an
intoxicating potion mingled with all the force and skill of Magic, and as it
sometimes soothes and smoothes the people by curbing Princes for the Churches
better accommodation, so also at other times and most constantly it saddles and
bridles the people for both Priests and Princes satisfaction. And least
protestant Princes should wholly abominate it, as adverse to their Grandour,
with extraordinary professions of devotion to them it labors to infuse and
insinuate these fragments of Machavell. First, that Subjects in general are
enemies to Authority, nay the chiefest enemies that they ought to countermine
and plot against. Secondly, that this enmity is best broken by breeding, and
maintaining divisions among them. Then having laid these grounds, its next
superstructions are, first that of all Subjects none are particularly so
malignant to Royallty as Protestants, and of all Protestants the British hold
their Kings to the most narrow limits.

Secondly, that none are so fit to be opposed to British Protestants herein, as
those which are the professed Vassalls of the Sea of Rome: and are now in a state
of persecution. How far these poisonous, cursed suggestions have prevailed with
our King, may be read in characters of blood all over our three Nations, and it
is my intent at this time more fully to relate. The Irish Rebellion which with
so much horrid fury, and slaughter broke forth upon the 23 of October, 1641. is
my maine subject, and I doubt not but that (discovered as it is already, though
very much of it remain as yet in obscurity, in regard that the Court ever
stood as in the dark to us, whilst we are placed in the light to the Court)
will sufficiently verify that the prime Engeniers and Masters of this
infernal plot had not religious but politic ends therein, and those not
peculiar to Ireland, but common to all the three Kingdoms, and such as I have
already intimated. But I must not frame a mere narrative, or play the
Historian, I have to do with a shameless and lying generation, with whom
Authorities themselves are scarce authentical: wherefore for my chief
fundamental, I will insist upon that confession which was made, and penned by
the Lord Macqueir himself. This confession was voluntarily written by the said
Lord about June, 1642. whilst he was a prisoner in the Tower, and it was
afterward avowed by him at the day of his death in the presence of the
Leiutenant of the Tower and of the two Sheriffs of London, and many others.
And because it seems something concise in some passages, and a little too
dark in others, and hitherto has not been printed in so exact a Copy as it
might, I shall now publish it, more perfect, and more punctually agreeing with
the original, (which still remains in Master Becks hands of Lincolnes Inn)
and for the better understanding of such as are not so inquisitive, or
inspective I shall add some Observations, and give a few unquestionable
Illustrations of mine own.

The Confession follows in haec verba.
JUNE 1642. BEing in Dublin Candlemas Term last was twelve month, the
Parliament then sitting, Master Roger More did write to me desiring me that if
I could in that spare time I would come to his house (for then the Parliament
did nothing but sit and adjourn, expecting a commission for the continuance
thereof, their former commission being expired) and that some things he had to
say to me, that did nearly concern me, and on receipt of his Letter, the new
Commission for continuing the Parliament landed, and I did return him an
answer that I could not fulfill his request for that present, and thereupon he
himself came to town presently after, and sending to me, I went to see him to
his lodging, and after some little time spent in salutations, he began to
discourse of the many afflictions and sufferings, of the Natives of that
Kingdom, and particularly in those latter times of my Lord of Straffords
Government (which gave distaste to the whole Kingdom) and then he began to
particularize the suffering of them that were the more ancient Natives, as were
the Irish, how that on the several Plantations they were all put out of their
Ancestors estates; which sufferings as he said did beget a general
coffeehouse over all the whole Kingdom in both the Natives; to wit, the old
and new Irish, and that if the Gentlemen of the Kingdom were disposed to free
themselves furtherly from the like inconveniency, and get good conditions for
themselves for regaining their Ancestors (or at least a good part thereof)
estates, they could never desire a more convenienter time, then that time, (the
distempers of Scotland being then a foot) and did ask me what I thought of it.
I made him answer that I could not tell what to think of it, such matters being
altogether out of my element, then he would needs have an oath of secrecy from
me, which I gave him, and thereupon he told me that he spoke to the best
Gentlemen of quality in Lemster, and a great part of Conaught touching that
matter, and he found all of them willing thereunto, if so be they could draw to
them the Gentlemen of Vlster, for which cause said he, I came to speak to you;
then he began to lay down to me the case that I was in then, overwhelmed in
debt, the smalnesse of my estate, and the greatness of the estate my Ancestors
had, and how I should be sure to get it again, or at least a good part
thereof, and moreover how the welfare and mainteining of the Catholic
Religion, which (he said) undoubtedly the Parliament now in England will
suppress) does depend on it, for said he it is to be feared, and so much I
hear from every understanding man, the Parliament intends the utter subversion
of our Religion; by which persuasions he obtained my consent, and so demanded
whether any more of Vlster Gentlemen were in Town, I told him that Master
Philip Rely, Master Torrilagh O Neile, brother to Sir Phillim O Neile, and
Master Colloe Macmahone were in town, and so for that time we parted.

The next day he invited Master O Rely and me to dine with him, and after
dinner, he sent for those other Gentlemen Mr. Neale, and Mr. Macmahon, and when
they were come, he began the discourse formerly used to me, to them, and with
the same persuasions formerly used to me, he obtained their consent, And then
he began to discourse of the feazebility and easines of the attempt considering
matters as they then stood in England, the troubles of Scotland, the great
number of able men in the Kingdom (meaning Ireland) what succors they were
(more then) to hope for, from abroad, and the Army then raised all Irish men,
and well armed (meaning the Army raised by my Lord Strafford against Scotland)
then of the manner how it ought to be done.

First, that every one should endeavor to draw his own friends into that act,
and at least those that did live in one Country with them, and when they had
so done that there should be a set day appointed, and every one in his own
quarters should rise out that day and seize on all the Arms he could get in
his country, and send to the Irish in the low Countries, and Spain, to let
them know of the day and resolution, so that they be over with them by that
Day, or soon after with supplies of Arms, and Ammunition as they could, and
this Day to be near winter, so that England could not be able to send forces
into Ireland before May, and by that time there was no doubt to be made, but
that they themselves would be supplied by the Irish beyond Seas, who he said
could not miss of help from either Spain or the Pope; But that his resolution
was not in all things allowed. For first it was resolved nothing should be done
until first they had sent to the Irish over Seas, to know their advice, and
what hope of succor they could give; for in them as they said, all their hope
of releife was; and they would have both their advice and resolution, before
any further proceedings more then to speak to, and try the Gentlemen of the
Kingdom, every one as he could convenietly, to see in case they would at any
time grow to a Resolution, what back and strength they might trust to. Then
Master Moore told them that it was to no purpose to spend much time in speaking
to the Gentlemen, for there was no doubt to be made of the ancient Irish, that
they would be ready at any time, And that all the doubt was in the Gentlemen of
the Pale, but he said that for his own part he was really assured when they
had risen out, the Pale Gentlemen would not stay long after them, at least that
they would not oppose them in any thing but be Neuters, and if in case they
did, that they had men enough in the Kingdom without them. Moreover he said,
that he had spoke to a great man (who then should be nameles) that would not
fail at the appointed day of rising out to appear and be seen in the Act,
but that until then he was sworn not to reveal him. And that was all that
was done at that meeting, only that Master Moore should the next Lent
following, make a journey down into the North to know what was done there, and
that he also might inform them what he had done, and so on parting Master
Philip Rely and I did importune Master Moore for the knowledge of that great
man that he spoke of, and on long entreaty, after binding us to new secrecy,
not to disclose him until the day should be appointed, he told it was the Lord
of Mayo, who was very powerful in command of men in those parts of Conaght
where-he lived, and that there was no doubt, to be made of him, no more then
was of himself, and so we parted.

The next Lent following Master More according to his promise came to Vlster,
and by reason it was the time of Assizes in several Counties, there he met
only with M. Rely, and nothing was then done, but all matters put off until
the May following, where we, or most of us, should meet at Dublin, it then both
being Parliament and Term time; In the mean time there landed in Ireland one
Neale O Neale, sent by the Earl of Tyrone out of Spain, to speak to those
Gentlemen of his name and kindred, to let them know that he had treated with
Cardinal Richelieu for obtaining succor to come for Irrland, and that he
prevailed with the Cardinal, so that he was to have Arms, Munition and Money
from him, on demand to come for Ireland, and that he only expected a
convenient time to come away, and to desire them to be in a readiness, and to
procure all others whom they could to be so likewise, which message did set
forward the proceedings very much, so that Master More, Master Rely, my Brother
and I, meeting the next day in Dublin, and the same Messenger being there too,
it was resolved that he should return to the Earl into Spain with their
resolution: which was that they would rise out 12. or 14. days before or after
Alhollantide, as they should see cause, and that he should not fail to be with
them by that time; (there was a report at that time and before, that the Earl
of Tyrone was killed, which was not believed, by reason of many such reports
formarly which was found to be false) and so the Messenger departed with
directions, that if the Earls death were true, he should repair into the
Low Countries to Colonel Owen O Neale and acquaint him with his Commission from
the Earl (whereof it was thought he was not ignorant, and to see what he would
advise, or could do himself therein, and return an answer. But present after
his departure the certainty of the Earls death was known, and on further
resolution it was agreed that an express Messenger should be sent to the
Colonel to make all the resolutions known to him, and to return speedily with
his answer, and so one Tool Connilly a Priest (as I think Parish Priest to
Master More) was sent away to Colonel O Neale.

In the interim there came several Letters and news out of England to Dublin,
of Proclamations against the Catholics in England, and also that the Army
raised in Ireland should be disbanded and conveied into Spain, and presently
after several Colonels and Captains landed with directions to carry away
those men, amongst whom Colonel Pluncket, Colonel Birne, and Captain Brian O
Neale came, but did not all come together, for Colonel Pluncket landed before
my coming out of town, and the other two after: whereupon a great fear of
suppressing Religion was conceived, and especially by the Gentlemen of the
Pale, and it was very common amongst them, that it would be very inconvenient
to suffer so many men to be conveied out of the Kingdom, it being as it was
said very confidently reported, that the Scottish Army did threaten, never to
lay down Arms, until an uniformity of Religion were in the three Kingdoms,
and the Catholic Religion suppressed. And thereupon both Houses of Parliament
began to oppose their going, and the Houses were divided in opinion; some would
have them go, others not; but what the definitive conclusion of the Houses was
touching that point, I cannot tell, for by leave from the House of Lords I
departed into the Country before the Prorogation: but before my departure I
was informed by John Barnewall a Friar, that those Gentlemen of the Pale, and
some others (Members of the House of Commons) had several meetings and
consultations how they might make stay of the Soldiers in the Kingdom, and
likewise Arm them for the defense of the King (being then much injured both of
England and Scotland, as they were informed) and to prevent any attempt against
Religion, for it was said (but very secretly) that the King did in those times
say to Master Nicholas Plunket (one of the Irish Committee then in England)
that if they would stick to him, he would stick to them; this I heard (I
think) from the said John Barnewell, but in truth I am not sure whether from
him or no, but certain I am, that he from whom I heard it, did confidently
report it. And presently after I departed into the Country, and Master O Rely
being a Member of the House of Commons stayed till the Prorogation, and on his
coming into the Country sent to me to meet him, and I came to his house, where
he told me that he heard for certain that the former narration of Barnewall to
me (for I did acquaint him with it) was true, and that he heard it from
several, there was also Emer Macmahone, (made privy formerly to all our
proceedings) at Mr. O Relyes, lately come out of the place, where he met with
the aforenamed John Barnewall, who told him as much as he formerly told me, and
moreover that those Collonells that lately came over, did proffer their service
and industry in that act, and so would raise their men under color to convey
them into Spain, and then seize on the Castle of Dublin, and with the Arms
there Arm their soldiers, and have them ready for any action, that should be
commanded them, but that they ^^d not concluded any thing, because they were
not assured how the Gentlemen of the remote parts of the Kingdom (and
especially of Vlster) would stand affected to that act, and that assurance of
that doubt was all their impediment; then we three began to think how we might
assure them of the assistance and help of Vlster Gentlemen: It was thought that
one should be sent to them to acquaint them therewith, and they made choice of
me to come, by reason, as they said, that my wife was allied to them, and their
Country woman, and would believe and trust me sooner then another of those
parts, they or most of them being of the Pale, and so (without as much as to
return home) to furnish my self for such a journey, (volens nolens) they
prevailed, or rather forced me to come to Dublin to confer with those
Collonells, (and that was the last August was twelvemonth) coming to Town, I
met Sir James Dillon accidentally before I came to my lodging, who was one of
these Collonells, and after salutation he demanded of me where my lodging was,
which when I told him, we parted. The next day being abroad about some other
occasions of mine own in Town I met him, (as he said) coming to wait on me
in my Chamber, but being a good way from it, he desired me to go to his own
Chamber being near at hand, and then began to discourse of the present
sufferings and afflictions of that Kingdom, and particularly in Religion, and
how they were to expect no redress, the Parliament in England intending, and
the Scots resolving never to lay down Arms until the Catholic Religion was
suppressed, then he likewise began to lay down what danger it would be to
suffer so many able men (as were to go with them) to depart the Kingdom in
such a time, neither (says he) does these other Gentlemen that are Collonells,
and my self affect our own private profit, so as to prefer it before the
general good of the Kingdom, and knowing that you are well affected
thereunto, (and I hope, said he, ready to put your helping hand to it on
occasion) I will let you know the resolution of those other Gentlemen and mine,
which is, we are ready to raise our men, and after to seize on the Castle where
there is great store of Arms, and arm our selves there; (this was the first
motion that I ever heard, of taking the Castle, for it never came into our
thoughts formerly nor am I persuaded never would, if it had not proceeded from
those Collonells, who were the first mentioners and contrivers thereof, for
ought known to me) and then be ready to prevent and resist any danger, if the
Gentry of the Kingdom like thereof and help us, for we of our selves neither
are able nor will do any thing therein without their assistance. I began
according to the directions that were sent with me, to approve of the
Resolution, and also to let him know how sure he might be of the assistance of
those of Vlster, then he told me that for my more satisfaction, I should
confer with the rest of those Collonells themselves, as many as were privy to
that action, and accordingly a place of meeting was appointed that afternoon;
and at the time and place appointed I met Sir James himself, Collonell Barn,
and Collonell Plunket, and that former discourse being renewed, they began to
lay down the obstacles to that enterprise, and how they should be redressed.

First, if there should war ensue, how there should be money had to pay the
soldiers.

Secondly, how and where they should procure succor for foreign parts.

Thirdly, how to draw in the Pale Gentry.

Lastly, who should undertake to surprise the Castle, and how it should be done.

To the first it was answered, that the Rents in the Kingdom every where, not
having respect whose they should be, due to the Lords and Gentry thereof,
should be collected to pay the soldiers, and moreover they might be sure (my
that there was no doubt to be made thereof) to procure money from the Pope, who
gave several promises formerly to my Lord of Tyrone (in case he could make way
to come into Ireland) to maintain six thousand men yearly at his own charge,
and that notwithstanding that my Lord of Tyrone was dead, yet that he would
continue the same forwardnes now.

To the second it was answered by Collonell Birne, that help from abroad could
not fail them, for (said he) Collonell O Neale told me, that he had, or would
procure in a readiness, I do not remember which of those the Colonells spoke,
or whether he spoke positive that Collonell O Neale had the Arms, or would
procure them,) Arms for ten thousand men. And moreover (said he) I make no
great question that if we send into Spain we shall not miss of aid, for I
being in London the last year, in the Scots troubles, I was in conference with
one of the Spanish Ambassadors there then, and talking of those troubles then
a foot, he said, that if the Irish did then rise so, and send into Spain,
their Messengers would be received under Canopies of gold; these last words he
told me, and some one man that was present privately, whose name I cannot call
to mind (neither well I remember whether he spoke to them all or no,) then it
was thought that when they were once in Arms for the defense of the Catholic
cause, they would be succored by the Catholic Princes in Christendom.

To the third it was answered by Collonell Plunket, that he was as morrally
certain (for those were his words) as he could be of any thing that the Pale
Gentry would join with and assist them, for (said he) I have spoke to several
of them since my landing in the Kingdom, and I find them very ready and
willing withal, I have at London spoke to some of the Committees, and
particularly to my Lord of Gormonstone to let them know this Resolution, and
they approved of it very well, and with all, they knew of the former
consultations by those Gentry, told me by Barnewall. All this was not done at
the first meeting, but at three or four meetings, and so at the last meeting
it was resolved to the last doubt touching seizing the Castle, That Collonell
Plunket and Collonell Birne should undertake that task, and they were named
that first should succor them, that should take the Castle with men presently,
namely Sir James Dillon who did undertake to be with them, within three (or at
the most) four days with one thousand men, and so many more should come to
them out of the North, for those two Collonells did not intend to use above one
hundred men in the surprizall, whereof they were to have twenty good able
Gentlemen; for they made account that having the Castle, they with the
Artillery would Master the Town until they were releived from the Country,
and then there was a set day appointed for the execution thereof, that was the
first of the ensuing October, this being the latter end of August or the
beginning of September, Anno 1641. (I do not know whither) and every one should
make provision to rise that day, and also seize on all the forts, garrisons,
and other places, where they think, any Arms should be, and in particular
Londonderry, which should be undertaken by those of Vlster, and because there
was a doubt made how all this could be done in so short a time, they did
appoint that all that were there present should not fail to meet again there
the twenty of September, to give an Account of all things, as well hopes as
impediments, and if at that interveiw all things should happen to be well that
they go forward, or if otherwise, to prolong the Execution of it to a more
convenient time, and so we parted, every man into the Country, about his own
task: and I in my way home, came to Master O Relyes house, and there I
received a letter from Sir Phelim O Neale, that his Lady was dead, and to be
buried on the Sunday following, this being on the Saturday, and desiring me in
all kindness to come to the burial, and Master O Rely having received another
letter to the same effect, would needs have me go thither, (whereunto I was
very unwilling, being weary, and withal not provided to go to such a
meeting,) as well (said he) to prevent any jealousy from the Ladies friends,
as also to confer with Sir Phelim touching all these proceedings (for neither
he nor I did ever speak to Sir Phelim concerning those matters before) but to
his brother Mr. Tiloragh O Neale, and coming thither, we found Capt. Bryan O
Neale, lately come out of the low Countries, sent over by Col. O Neale to
speak to, and provoke those of Vlster to rise out into Arms, and that he
would be with them on notice of their day; the same day, or soon after it; and
it was asked of the said Captain, what aid he could send or procure, being
but a private Collonell, or where he could get any? He replied that the said
Collonell told him, that he had sent to several places that Summer to demand
aid, and in particular to Cardinal Richeleiu into France, (to whom he had
sent twice that year) and had comfortable and very hopeful promises from
them, and especially from that Cardinal, on whom he thought the Collonell did
most depend; so that there was no doubt to be made of succor from him, and
especially when they had risen out, that it would be a means to the Cardinal
to give aid; we did the more credit him in regard of the former treaty
between the said Cardinal and the Earl of Tyrone, (as formerly is said) for
my own part, I did and do believe that the Collonell does depend on France
for aid, more then on any other place, as well for these reasons, as also,
that Omer Macmahone formerly mentioned, told me that presently after the Isle
of Rees enterprise (he being then in the Low Countreies) did hear for certain
that the Earl of Tyrone, together with the Colonells, did send into France to
the Marshall of France (that was the General of the French forces at the Isle
of Rees) to deal with him for procuring of aid, to come then for Ireland, and
that he received in answer from the said Marshall, that he was most willing and
ready to contribute his indeaveours for his furtherance therein, but that for
the present he could not answer my Lords expectation, by reason that the King
had wars then in Italy, which he thought would be at an end within half a
year, or little more, and then my Lord should not doubt of any thing that he
could do for his assistance, but those wars continued a great deal longer;
so for that time that enterprise failed: and after the burial was done, I gave
those Gentlemen knowledge of what I had done at Dublin, and how I was to
return thither, and then they began to think how to surprise Londonderry,
they being near it, but could not then agree in the manner, and so Sir Phelim
desired me to take his house in my way going to Dublin, and that I should have
a Resolution to to carry with me touching Londonderry, and thereupon I parted
home, but soon after came to Dublin, to the afore-appointed meeting with those
Colonells: But first, I took in my way Sir Phelim O Neales house, to be
certain what he had done; and his answer was, that he knew that matters could
not be put in execution by the fifth of October, as was appointed, and that they
would make another longer day for it, and that he would provide for the taking
of Londonderry by that day; and so I came to Dublin, to give an account of
that was done, and also know what further should be done: I was not two hours
in my lodging when Master Moore came to me (who knew of what was done by those
Colonells formerly by Coll. Birne, and told me that the Messenger sent to
Colonel Neale was come with answer, desiring us not to delay any time in
rising out, and to let him know of that day before hand, and that he would not
fail to be with us within fourteen days of that day with good aid, also
desiring us by any means to seize the Castle of Dublin if we could, for he
heard that there was great provision in it for war, and Mr. Moore moreover
said, that time was not to be over-slipped, and desired me to be very pressing
with the Colonells to go on in their resolution, but on meeting with them they
were fallen from their former resolution, because those of the Pale would do
nothing therein first, but when it was done, they would not fail to assist, as
Collonell Plunket did affirm, and so on several meetings, it was resolved on
by them to desist from that enterprise for that time, and to expect a more
convenient time; but before that their resolution, Sir Phelim O Neale, and the
aforesaid Capt. Brian O Neale followed me to Dublin (as they said) to assist
and advise me how to proceed with that Colonel (but neither they nor Mr.
Moore would be seen therein themselves to those Gentlemen, but would meet me
privately, and know what was done at every meeting, alleging for excuse, that
I being first employed in that matter, it would not be expedient that they
should be seen in it; and moreover they would not be known to me to be in
Town, but by a few of their friends, until they were in a manner ready to
depart, at least, as long as I was in Town, for I left them there, but when I
made them acquainted with their determination of desisting from that
enterprise, they thought it convenient that we should meet with Master Moore,
and Collonell Birne, to see what was further to be done concerning the former
intention of their own, and accordingly we did send to them, that they should
meet us, and at that meeting, where were only Sir Phelim, Mr. Moore, Colonel
Birne, Captain Neale, and my self: after long debate, it was resolved, that
we, with all those that were of our faction should go on with that
determination, that was formerly in May concluded, to wit, to rise out, and
moreover to seize on the Castle, (as the Colonells were purposed) for if it
were not for their project, and the advice sent by Colonel Neale we would
never venture to surprise it, neither was it ever thought on in all the
meetings and resolutions between us, before that those Colonels did resolve on
it, but by reason that the other Gentlemen that were private to their
proceedings were not present, the certainty of the time, and the manner how to
execute it, were put off to a further meeting in the Country; and this was
resolved in Dublin on the Saturday at night, being the 26. or 27. of September.
and that meeting was appointed on the Saturday following at Mr. Collo.
Ma^^^hones house in Far^^y, in the County of Monaghan, but by reason that at
the meeting the Gentlemen of Limster could not be present, considering the
remoteness of the place from them, it was thought fit that Mr. Moore should
there meet to receive the final resolution, and should acquaint them
therewith, and in the mean time Col. Birne, who had undertaken for Col.
Plunket, should inform them all of the intention conceived, and dispose them
in a readiness against that day that should be appointed, and thereupon we all
left the Town, only Sir Phelim staide about some other his private occasions,
but did assure his being there at that day.

On the Saturday I came to Mr. Macmahones house, there meet only Mr. Moore,
Mr. Macmahone himself, Captain Neale, Emer Macmahone, and my self (and
thither the same day came that Messenger that was sent to Coll. Neale, and did
report the Colonells answers and advice verbatim, as I have formerly repeated
from Mr. Moore) and by reason that Sir. Phelim his brother, or Mr. Philip O
Rely that were desired to meet, did not meet, we st^ied that night to expect
them; and that night I received a Letter from Sir Phelim, intteating us by any
means not to expect him until the Monday following, for he had not, nor could
dispatch some occasions nearly concerning him, but whatsoever came of them, he
would not fail on the Monday. And the next day after receipt of the Letter,
being Sunday (by Mr. Moors advice) we departed from Mr. Coll. Macmahones
house, (to prevent (as he said) the suspicion of the English living thereabouts
to Lourosse, in the County of Ardmaugh to Mr. Torilagh O Neales house, not Sir
Phelims brother, but Son to Mr. Henry O Neale of the Fues, Son in Law to Mr.
Moore, and left word that if Sir Phelim, or any of those other Gentlemen did
come in the mean time they should follow us thither (whether only went Mr.
Moore, Captain O Neale, and my self) and there we expected until the Tuesday
subsequent, before any of those did come: On the Tuesday came Sir Phelim and
Mr. Emer Macmahone, all the rest failing to come, Mr. Collonell Macmahons wife
was dead the night before, which was the cause that he was not there, but I
gave his assent to what should be concluded to join therein, and execute what
should be appointed him, and then we five, viz. Sir Phelim, Mr. Moore, Captain
O Neale, Emer Macmahone, and my self, assuring our selves that those Gentlemen
absent would both allow and join to what we should determine, did grow into a
final resolution, grounding all, or most part of our hope and confidence on
the succor from Collonell Neale, to seize on the Castle, and rise out all in
one day, and the day was appointed on the 23. of that month, this being the
fifth day of October, having regard therein to the day of the week whereon that
day did fall, which was the Saturday, being the Market day, on which day there
would be less notice taken of people up and down the streets: Then began a
question who should be deputed for the surprizall of the Castle, and then Mr.
Moore said he would be one of them himself, and that Coll. Birne should be
another, and what other Gentlemen of Leinster they could procure to join with
them, and seeing the Castle had two gates, the one the great, and the other the
little gate, going down to my Lord Leiutenants Stables, hard by which Stable
without the Castle was the stotehouse for Arms, they of Leinster would
undertake one Gate, and that should be the little Gate, and the great Gate
should be undertaken by those at Vlster, (and said he) of necessity one of you
both (meaning Sir Phelim and me) must be there for the better countenance of
that matter, it being the glory of all our proceedings; his speeches were well
liked of all present, but Sir Phelim would be exempted from that employment,
and so would I; but then all of them set on me, desiring me to be one;
alleging for reason that their proceedings and resolutions were very
honorable and glorious, being for Religion, and for to procure more liberty
for their Country, as did (said they) of late Scotland; and that in taking the
Castle consisted all the glory and honor of the said Action, all which should
be attributed to them that should be employed therein, and so by consequence
all or most part to me, being (as they said) the chief in that enterprise; and
moreover Sir Phelim said, that he would endeavor to take or procure others to
take Londonderry the same day, and if he should be away, that place would not
be taken. With these and many other persuasions they obtained my consent, and
then the Captain offered himself. We began then to consider what number should
be employed in that act, and they concluded on two hundred men, a hundred from
each Province, for those Gates which they seize on, of which number Sir Phelim
O Neale should send forty with an able sufficient Gentleman to conduct them;
and likewise Captain Neale twenty, Master Collonell Macmahone ten, Master O
Rely ten more, and I should bring twenty. Then began a doubt how they should
raise those men, and convey them to Dublin without suspicion; and it was
answered, that under pretense of carrying them to those Colonels that were
conveying Soldiers out of the Kingdom, it might safely be done; and to that
purpose Sir Phelim O Neale, Master More, and the Captain had several blanke
Patents with deputations to make Captains to those Colonells, which they sent
to those Gentlemen, that should send men to Dublin, for the more color; Then
they bethought of what was to be done in the Country that day, and it was
resolved that every one privy to that matter, in every part of the Kingdom,
should rise out that day, and seize on all the Forts and Arms in the several
Counties, to make all the Gentlemen prisoners the more to assure themselves
against any adverse fortune, and not to kill any but where of necessity they
should be forced thereunto by opposition (which those that were appointed for
taking the Castle should observe) and in particular they bent all their aim in
Vlster to take that day Londonderry, which Sir Phelim did undertake;
Knockfergus, which they thought Sir Henry O Neales brother would do, and to
that end Sir Phelims Brother Terilaugh O Neale should be sent to them; and the
Nurie, which should be undertaken by Sir Margeriasse, and his Brothers, for
whom Sir Phelim (in regard they were his brothers in law, his deceased Lady
being their Sister) did undertake. Moreover it was agreed, that Sir Phelim,
Master O Rely, Master Coll. Macmahone, and my brother should, with all speed
they could, after that day raise all the forces they could and follow us to
Dublin, both to arm the men and succor us, and defend and garrison the Town
and Castle, and likewise Master More should appoint Leinster-Gentlemen to send
like supply of men. All which I was by their appointment to inform Master O
Rely, I being next him, together with what he was to do for his own part. Then
there was fear of the Scots conceived, that they would presently oppose
themselves, and that would make the matter more difficult; to avoid which
danger it was resolved not to meddle with them or any thing belonging to them,
and to demean our selves toward them as if they were of us, which we thought
would pacify them from making any opposition, and if the Scots would not accept
of that offer of Amity, but would oppose us, we were in good hope to cause a
stir in Scotland, that might divert them from us. And I believe the ground
for that hope was, that two years before in or about the beginning of the
Scots troubles, my Lord of Tyrone sent one Terilagh O Neale (a Priest) out of
Spain (and this I take it was the time that he was in Treaty with Cardinal
Richelieu) to my Lord of Argyle, to treat with him for help from my Lord, for
him to come into Ireland, and as was said for a marriage, between the said
Earl and my Lord of Argyles daughter (or Sister I know not which) and this
messenger took Ireland in his way thither, with whom Master Terilagh O Neale,
Sir Phelims Brother, had conference, from whom this relation was had. That said
messenger went into Scotland as I did hear from the said Master Neale, or from
Emer Macmahone before named, I know not from which of them; but what he did
there I could never hear, by reason that my Lord of Tyrone was presently after
killed; they were the more confirmed therein, hearing that my Lord of Argyle
did say (near on the same time as I guess, and when the Army was raised in
Ireland as I think) to a great Lady in Scotland; I know not her name, but did
hear that she was much embarked in the troubles of that Kingdom, then; she
questioning how they could subsist against the two Kingdoms of England and
Ireland, that if the King did endeavor to stir Ireland against them, he
would kindle such a fire in Ireland as would hardly or never be quenched; And
moreover we knew my Lord to be powerful with the Ilanders, or Red-shankes in
Scotland, whom we judged would be prone and ready to such Actions, they for the
most part being descended out of Ireland, and holding the Irish language and
manners still; and so we parted, the next day being Wednesday, from Lough
Rosse, every man about his own task; and so when I came home I acquainted my
brother with all that was done, and what they had appointed him to do, and did
likewise (according as they appointed me) send to Master O Rely to let him know
as much. And the eighteenth of the same month I began my journey to Dublin,
and when I came to Dublin being the day before the appointed day of putting
that resolution in execution there, I met with Captain Con O Neale sent out of
the Low-Countryes by Colonel O Neale, (who came after the messenger sent by us
formerly to the said Colonel, and was by him dispatched with his Answer) to
encourage us in our resolution, and to speedy performance, with assurance of
succors, which he said would not fail on the Collonells behalf; And for the
more certainty of help from him, and to assure us that the Colonel had good
hopes to procure aid from others, he said that it was he himself that was
employed from him to Card. Richelieu twice that Summer, who gave them very
fair promises to answer the Colonells expectation, with which he said that the
said Colonel and himself were really assured of the Cardinals aid, and that
he was likewise commanded by the Collonell upon our Resolution of the day to
give notice thereof to him, and that he would be within fourteen days over
with us with aid; but he the said Con O Neale landing 9. or 10. days before,
and meeting with Captain Brian O Neale, who made him acquainted with what was
resolved, he did write all the matter to Colonel O Neale; so as he was sure of
his speedy coming. And that Evening he and I came to meet the other
Gentlemen, and there we met Master Moore, Collonell Birne, Collonell Plunket,
Captain Fox, and another Leinster-Gentleman, a Captain I think of the
Birnes, but I am not sure wheiher a Birne or a Tool, and Captain Birgan O
Neale; and taking an account of those that should have been there, it was
found that Sir Phelim O Neale and Master Collo Macmahone, did fail of sending
their men, and Colonel Birne did miss Sir Mergan Cavanagh that had promised
him to be there, but he said he was sure he would not fail to be that night or
the next morning in Town, and of the two hundred men that were appointed, there
were only eighty present, yet notwithstanding they were resolved to go on in
their Resolution, and all the difference was at what time of the day they
should set on the Castle, and after some debate it was resolved in the
afternoon, and the rather hoping to meet the Council there then; for they
said, if they should take the Castle, and be enforced by any extremity for
not receiving timely succor out of the Country, having them, they could not
want; and so parted that night, but to meet in the morning to see further what
was to be done; and immediately thereon I came to my Chamber, and about nine of
the clock Master Moore and Captain Fox came to me and told me that all was
discovered, and that the City was in Arms, and the Gates shut up, and so
departed from me, and what became of them, or of the rest I know not, but think
that they escaped, yet how or at what time I do not know, because I my self
was taken that morning.

After a deliberate reading and rumination of this account (given by Macquir) I
shall desire the Reader to be distinct in these particular considerations.
First, I would have him observe here the principal Agents in this desperate
Assassination. Secondly, I would have notice taken what the end and pretenses
were which moved, and enraged these Agents. Thirdly, what the opportunities and
contingencies were which made that very season pitched upon for action.
Fourthly, what the stratagems and policies were which attended their
enterprise. Fifthly To what degrees of cruelty they did at last arrive. These
particulars being truly and clearly laid open, together with some other
additionall evidences of the like authority, conclusions will issue of
themselves, acquainting us with the causes of all our miseries, and amounting
to no less then what I have already premised and presumed.

1. First therefore we see here a difference is to be noted between the most
eminent plotters, and the most violent executours of this mischeife: the Lord
Macquir gives a good relation of the executours, but not being acquainted with
the conspiracy it self, till it had been matured by others, and was
communicated to him by Roger Moore, about nine months before the general
eruption; He says nothing thereof; but it is plain, that these Counsels were
laid long before by the Popish Clergy: for by the connivence of our Governors
in Ireland, that Country had its Titular Archbishops, Bishops,
Vicar-generals, Provincial Consistories, Ecclesiastical Deanes, Abbotts,
Priors, Monks, Nunns, Jesuits, Priests, and Friars without number, besides all
Hierarchicall Officers, and as well in Towns as in the Country had free use
of the Mass. Dr. Jones had it from the mouth of a Fransciscan, that before the
dismal day of October, there was a great meeting at a religious house in
Westmeath of the Romish Clergy, and some others, whereat the question was
debated, what course should be taken with the English, and how the government
of the State should be new molded. And in May 1642. there was a general
congregation held at Kilkenney wherein the Church of Ireland was annexed to the
Sea of Rome, and the State made no less in effect then purely Democraticall:
and one Act was passed for sending Ambassadors in behalf of the whole
Kingdom to the Pope, the Emperor, the King of France and Spain, and those to
be of the Church Prelates, with one of the Nobility and a Lawyer: Moreover all
the acts of Kilkenney were only subscribed by three Archbishops, six Bishops,
and twenty others either of the Clergy, or some holy orders, or officers
belonging to the Hierarchy: whereby it appears that the Nobility, Gentry, and
Commonalty of Ireland (though the adventurous and active part of the war be
left to them) have as yet but very little or no share in the directive or
gubernative part; much less had they whilst the matter was but in
consultation; Besides, we know the Ecclesiastics, were ranged into fit
stations, and as there was a just number appointed to attend at home for
managing of business in Ireland, so there was as vast a proportion distributed
abroad into the Court of Rome, and all other Courts of Europe for foreign
Agency and correspondency. Wherefore if the Apostolic sea ever did lively
represent the bottomless pit reeking forth thick fumes, or darkening the sky
with swarms of odious Locusts, doubtless at this time by the emission of so
many Regulars and Seculars, upon such confounding messages, it did verify and
explain that dim prediction.

Well: but after the Jesuits and Priests had been long in conjuration about
this woeful tragedy, at last the troubles of Scotland have occasioned a
Parliament in England, and raised an Army of Papists in Ireland; and now all
advantages concurring, such of the Lords and Gentry, as are most apt for
innovation are to be solicited, and rightly instructed how to draw in other
concurrent parties in all the four several Provinces.

The common people are not to be trusted with the knowledge of any thing till
the very night it self approaches; nay the very Gentry themselves, except some
few chosen ones, are not to receive this secret till all things are ready for
execution: the Sacraments of the Mass, and of Confession (which are made
Vmbrages to draw the multitude together, and mysterious attractives to engage
in this hellish sacrifice,) are not to be solemnized before the day appointed.
There was fear that the multitude could not be prepared without discovery; but
there was no fear that the multitude would not consent without preparation. At
a meeting therefore in Dublin 8 months at least before this infamous October,
when one of the Conspiratours advised to employ time in speaking to, and trying
the Gentry of Ireland, till advertisement could be received from the other
undertakers beyond the seas: Master Moore replied, that it was to no purpose to
spend much time in speaking to the Gentry; for there was no doubt to be made
of the Irish, that they would be ready at any time; but all the doubt was in
the Gentry of the Pale. Howsoever for his part his affirmation was that he was
really assured, when the Irish were up, the Pale Gentry would not stay long
after. He further proceeded also to entreat that the Lord of May (who was
very powerful in command of men in those parts of Connaught wherein he lived)
had been spoken to by himself, and that his consent was granted, yet not
without an oath for concealment of the same. But I will go on with the Lord
Macquir, to mention the principal Lay-conjuratours who were not only taken in
by the Ecclesiastics for mere action, but were also admitted to some part of
the contrivance at least nine months before; and we shall see some use may be
made of the same. The first instanced in, is Roger Moore, alias Roei Morace of
the family of the Moraces of Leix in Lemster, which County together with the
Territories of Offali were escheated to the Crown by Act of Parliament, and
were planted with English in the Reign of Queen Mary. Nevertheless also the
father of this Roei being civil and of peaceable disposition, though a Papist,
was by Queen Elizabeth cherisht and sufficiently provided for by a grant of
fair and large possessions in the County of Keldare and Mead to him and his
heirs in fee, and the same did descend to this Roei. Here was Justice done
long since by a Popish Queen to his damage, here is grace showed lately by a
Protestant Queen to his advantage: what pretense of quarrel therefore can
this afford to R. Moore for Papists against Protestants, or for former times
against latter? The Lord Macqueir himself, and his family may next take place;
and we must take knowledge, that Sir Conor To. Macqueir his Grandfather was
divested of the dignity of Macqueir, and the County of Termanagh, and unable to
right himself, was reinstated by the aid of the English, after which also he
had not only the Barony of Maghere staffana, but also a yearly pension for
life granted out of the Exchequer by King James. And not long since Bryan the
Son of Sir Connor, and father of this Lord, obtained a Patent from King
Charles of the Barony of Eviskillim; if these offices be accounted
disobligations or provoke the Irish against the English, or stir up Papists
against Protestants, certainly either the Irish differ from other Nations, and
Popery differs from other Religions, or else the nature of ingratitude must
needs be changed from what it was.

Philip O Rely comes now in view; and his Father Captain Hugh Mac-shane O Rely
had from King James a grant and confirmation in fee of a fair estate in Lands,
lying within the County of Oavan, one of the escheated Counties of Vlster. Of
all the Rebels none scarce ever did pursue the English and the Reformed
Religion more perfidiously, and desperately, then this Philip and his family,
yet here is to be seen what it cost King James to incense him so deeply
against us.

Sir Phelim O Neale, and his brother Torilah may present themselves after the O
Relies; and these in their minority being left Orphans by Oge O Neal their
father, were liberally bred up in learning, and carefully recommended by our
State to the tuition of the Lord Calfield, and when they had attained to full
years, their fathers inheritance with some additions was settled upon them.
Yet it is conjecturable that for as much as the Province of Vlster did escheat
by the several treasons and attaindors of the Earls, Tyrone, Tyrconell, and
others, if Tyrone had again restored himself according to the design of
these O Neales, the titles and possessions of this Family in Vlster would have
been shrewdly shaken, or at least their power ecclipsd. Nevertheless the O
Neales now for such offenses as these, butcher a thousand of English, and for
their first sacrifice slay the young Lord Calfield their old Guardians son, and
yet it must pass by the laws of Popery for a very fair, equitable, and
grateful retaliation. Colonel Mac-Mahon and his Family next in order, never
could complain of any molestation, or disinherison by English plantations, but
all the Mac-Mahons of Farny and their chief had been extirpated by the O
Neales, if the power of the English had not supported, and preserved them. Sure
such meritorious obligations upon any other then either Irish, or Catholics,
would have procured some other acknowledgement. We may now conclude with Sir
Con. Mageniis and his brethren, and Sir Arthur his Father; and it is apparent,
that upon the settlement of Vlster, though he was in actual rebellion with the
Earl of Tyrone, whose daughter he had married, yet he obtained from King James
a grant and confirmation of the territory of Ireagle in the County of Down to
himself and his heirs in fee. Had an Indian, or Mohammedan been so treated, we
may well expect he would have studied some other requital then the total
extirpation of those which so treated him, or he would have thought something
else had appertained to gratitude besides murder and revenge. I thus rank
these conspiratours by themselves, because their task was domestical, and
most of them were of Vlster; and therefore policy required that where the
greatest difficulty was, most industry was to be used. For it is to be noted,
that in Munster, and in Conaght, where the English were thinner planted, and
less fortified, there was not that fear of opposition as in Vlster and
Lemster, where the Scots and English were closer embodied, and surer garrisond,
but especially near Dublin where the Seat of Justice was, and the five
adjacent Counties, (...)
