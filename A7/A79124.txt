CHARLES by the grace of God King of great Britain, France and Ireland,
defender of the Faith.
To Our Lovits Messengers, our Sheriffs in that part conjunctly and severally
specially constitute, greeting.
Forsameikle as the Estates of Our Kingdom of Scotland presently conveened,
taking into their most serious consideration the great and imminent danger of
the true Protestant reformed Religion, and of the peace of their Our Kingdoms
from the treacherous and bloody plots, conspiracies, attempts and practices of
Papists, Prelates, Malignants, and their adherents, Have after mature
deliberation thought expedient to enter into a solemn and mutual Covenant
with Our Kingdom of England, for the defense of the true Protestant reformed
Religion in the Kirk of Scotland, and the reformation of Religion in the Kirk
of England, according to the Word of God, the example of the best reformed
Kirks, and as may bring the Kirk of God in both Kingdoms to the nearest
Conjunction and Uniformity in Religion and Church government, And siclike to
preserve and defend the Rights and Privileges of Our Parliaments, and
Liberties of Our Kingdoms respective, And to preserve and defend Our Person
and Authority in the preservation of the said true Religion, and Liberties of
Our said Kingdoms, And to observe the Articles of the late Treaty and Peace
betwixt the two Nations, And to assist and defend all that shall enter into
this Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof, as the same more fully
proports: Which as it will be a comfort and encouragement to all Christians who
fear God, and love Religion, to all good and loyal Subjects who truly honor
Us, and to all true Patriots who tender the liberty of their Country: So
doubtless it will exasperate and inrage the said Papists, Prelates, Malignants,
and their adherents, to practice and execute all the mischief and cruelty they
can against this Kirk and Kingdom, as they have done in Our Kingdoms of
England and Ireland. For preventing thereof, the Estates of this Our said
Kingdom (according to the practice of Our Council, Convention of Our Estates,
and of Our Parliaments in former times of the like exigence) have resolved to
put this Our said Kingdom, with all possible speed, in a present posture of
defense, And for the better safety and security thereof, have statute and
ordained, and hereby statues and ordaines, that immediately after the
publication hereof, all the sensible persons within this Our Kingdom of
Scotland, betwixt sixty and sixteen years of age, of whatsoever quality,
rank, or degree, shall provide themselves with forty days provision, and
with Ammunition, Arms, and other warlike provision of all forts, in the most
substantious manner, for Horse and Foot, with Tents, and all other furnishing
requisite, And that the Horsemen be armed with Pistols, broad Swords, and Steel
caps, And where these Arms cannot be had, that they provide Jacks, or Secrets,
Lances and Steel-bonnets, And that the Footmen be armed with Musket and Sword,
or Pike and Sword, And where these cannot be had, that they be furnished with
Halberts, Loquhaber axes, or Jeddart staves and Swords.

OUR WILL IS HEREFORE, and We charge you straightly and commands, that
incontinent their Our Letters seen, you pass to the Market Cross of
Edinburgh, and several Burrowes of this Our Kingdom, and Parish Kirks
thereof, and there by open Proclamation make publication hereof, wherethrough
none pretend ignorance of the same, And that you command and charge all and
sundry Our subjects foresaids, being sensible persons, betwixt sixty and
sixteen years, to provide themselves in manner foresaid, and to be in
readiness to make their Randevous thus armed at the places to be appointed by
Our said Estates, or Committees having power from them, within eight and
forty hours after they shall be lawfully warned by order from them to that
effect, as they will testify their affections to the true Protestant Religion,
the Liberties of Our Kingdoms, Our own honor, and the peace and safety of
that their native Country; and under the pain to be esteemed and punish as
enemies to Religion, Us and Our Kingdoms, and their whole goods to be
confiscate to the use of the public.
