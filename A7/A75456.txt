AN ANTHEME SUNG At the Consecration OF THE Archbishops and Bishops of
IRELAND, On Sunday the 27. of January 1660. AT St. Patricks in Dublin.
Treble. NOw that the LORD has re-advanc'd the Crown;
Which Thirst of spoil, and frantic zeal threw down:

Tenor. Now that the LORD the Miter has restored
Which, with the Crown, lay in the dust abhorred:

Treble. Praise him ye Kings,


Tenor. Praise him ye Priests,


Chor. All Sing,
Glory to CHRIST, our High Priest, Highest King.

Treble. May Judah's Royal Scepter still shine clear!


Tenor. May aarons Holy Rod still Blossoms bear!


Treble and Tenor. Scepter and Rod, Rule still and Guide our Land!
And These whom GOD Anoints, feel no Rude Hand,
May Love, Peace, Plenty wait on Throne and Chair,
And may Both share in Blessings, as in Care.

Chorus. Angels look down, and Joy to see
Like that above, a Monarchy.
Angels look down, and Joy to see
Like that above an Hierarchy.
