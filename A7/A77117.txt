To the Readers.
WEll? Then it must to the Press? yet Readers, ye being of many Constitutions
and Sizes; my words therefore to you (though I am truly yours) are in
general, and but few, and those not very pleasing neither; (save only that my
Constitution compells me to declare my Bow to Noble Natures, to the truly
knowing, wise, good man.) It is published out of pure Love and Pity (in the
true concernments) of Mankind: And may it be judged, Ex visceribus causae; I
am not therefore minded to beg any thing, claiming allowance of the necessary
Incidents to a manly Action: I therefore wish every one of you (at least)
either so much true Wit or Honesty, as will suspend reproof only, till you
will be public in it, my Ingenuity subscribes, to refer to the generation of
Wisdom, who is the Fool or Knave in Print.

DEO
Maximo Optimo.

Dicatur Consecratur.

Actio Persona.

For Right Advance of Understanding.

For Certain Resolve of Judgment.

For Effectual moving the Will.

For Due and constant Operation.

Hoc ipsum est Coelo in terris frui: Quando men's humana in charitate movetur;
In providentia quiescit, and supra Polos veritatis circumfertur.

Suave est in littore stanti Naves, etc.

Suave ad Arcis fenestram stanti, etc.

Sed nulla suavitas vel voluptas aequiparari potest huicipsi, nempe ut quis
stet super clivum excelsum veritatis, atque inde errores, caligines, and
Tempestates in convalle subjacenti despiciat.

Man's mind is not a Paradise, unless there be planted in it the full
knowledge of good and evil.

The Subject.
Of the first Beings, Essence, Operations. Of the End in its external
Operations. How this End is to be performed, and of the ill finding and
performing. Where is the true Rule for performance, and the way for full
Restoration.
Religio Iurisconsulti.
Of the first Beings, Essence, Operations.
AS every Beginning has a cause thereof, for there is not any thing can give
that to it self; so, In causis non datur progressus in infinitum: We must
therefore come to a first cause; for among Infinity of causes, the True, the
Prime is not, therefore in causa datur progressus in infinitum, to a Precedent
eternity of Duration, and a Being there is, without Beginning, the which is
incident to an Infinite Being, to which any thing, (consistent with the
absolute Perfection) either in its Being, or in the manner thereof, cannot be
denied: and infinite this is in its Being; For all Finites conjoined cannot
make up an Infinity of Duration or otherwise: for that a finite thing should
be infinite, is a contradiction, as well as that an infinite thing should be
finite. And also humane Reason being finite, and therefore its effect
comprehending any finite thing, it being the cause thereof, must be infinite;
as in its Operation and Adjunct, so in its Subject or Essence: this Being
therefore is necessary and independent, Infinity being Absolute, and Present,
without aid of possibilities or succession, neither partaking of motion and
change, but has an eternal samenesse in it self, and its necessary
Operations, as well to, as from eternity: The world therefore is not (as the
Epicure first broached, and Aristotle, and the Peripateticks held, contrary to
the former Votes of Philosophers) necessarily eternal (their lower Degrees,
of Independent eternities, wherein there can be none, are by themselves ranked
together with time) it being finite, and the finite parts to sense, appearing
to be several and divided Beings, not made up all one, and the whole being
(as it must be) of a limited Operation, neither has it absolute perfection;
for whence proceeds the invention of Arts and Sciences, and our better
performance of Actions? whence the diversity of Entities? subordinate and
subservient, (which also is not to be admitted among eternals, which are
equal, and also among whom, there can be no end, or consideration precedent,
they also consisting of Contraries as appears hereafter) one unto the other?
And why was not the Prime Essence by them acknowledged, the author of all
motion, and source of all perfection, admitted (among their highest degrees of
Eternities) to a Deity? Nor is the World so constant in any its properties and
qualifications, as in its inconstancy, alterations, variations and decay,
necessarily consequent from the contrary matter, whereof it consists, its
succession helps not, as aforesaid; and also where the causes and parts are
temporal and measured, the effect and the whole, cannot be of it self
eternal; and man sure, if any, is to be eternal, he being the principal,
and all other things for him, as appears hereafter. But he is not, as of this
world; for his temper, his mind, is here constant in inconstancy, unsatisfied,
imperfect, and inthralled to the Laws of Mortality; and though it be
admitted, particulars resolve into their Principles, and all things relieve
nature in common, (which therefore needs it) yet those Principles partake of no
further Being than before: And therefore Datur annihilatio, without an infinite
power, (the contrary parts invading and absolutely devouring one the other,
though where the subject is finite there be no need thereof, as aforesaid) as
well as a higher being by Degrees, insensibly passes to a lower: All things
therefore in this world, being under Motion and Time, have a cause, which is
either accidental, or works by an intended due Operation; not accidental,
that is not eternal, as the first cause must be, as aforesaid: Nor does it
give any Being, but only alters, and therefore rather helps to destroy Being;
and also the several parts of the World consist even of contraries in their
particular Beings, and are of so high a fashion, stored with such manner of
varieties, and so proportionable, and useful, in the total, one unto another,
that in Galens opinion, (who endeavored otherwise) it was a sovereign
Wisdom, a Perfectly Good, and Heavenly mind that caused it. The fashion of
man likewise is wonderful, even a miracle; and as he is the Lieutenant of the
world, as appears hereafter, so he is the abridgement of it, being capable to
partake of every part thereof: All other things are also as fitly answering
their proper Natures, and Degrees; And though Perfection in each kind, be
accruable by Degrees, yet never by mere accident, which only produces
disorder and Confusion; And then also the course of the World would not be so
like it self, in its Operations, nor keep therein the Order and Harmony it now
does, and for all time has done. All things therefore are caused by some
intended due Operation, contrary to the hap-hazzard Opinion (which can extend
only to Accidents) (upon proportionable Alterations of the World; for the
better Entities, the greater Alterations, for the other, the lesser; as by
Moats of the Sun, collected together, etc. (a Production inconsistent, with a
duration to eternity) received by the Epicures (from Democritus their Founder)
and other Accidental Philosophers. This Cause or Being, (though with Plato,
Plotine, and others, it is far more excellent than Being, it giving it) is
but one: for it being eternal, it is infinite, as aforesaid; and therefore
though it be not material, as appears hereafter, yet it having no limits in
its Being, and therefore having all Being in it self, no being can be
consistent with it, but must be of it. Absolute Perfection also consists in
Unity, and according to the Opinion of Proclus, Plotine and Zeno (the Patron of
the Stoics) the denial of its Unity, is therefore an absolute denial of its
Being: The original also of every thing is Unity; And of reasonable Creatures
which are to perform the end of his Operations external, as appears
hereafter, there is but one kind, and all things in the world, though made up
of contraries, tend only to one General Being, without difference or faction:
And though two, and many Beings, are acknowledged by many Philosophers, yet
when they would be serious, most of them acknowledged only One, Supreme, the
cause of all others. And the Poetical Philosophers, and Orpheus the first of
them, which among their vain imaginations first imagined several first
Beings, when they were Real, acknowledged only One; yet it is possible, for
this first Being, to make another Infinite Being, (contrary to Aristotle's
impossibilities) he being an Infinite Cause, and it not being a Contradiction.
This first Being is therefore also Infinite (it being of an indivisible single
Perfection, thereby the Infiniteness of One excludes not the other) in all its
Properties; and it is Spiritual because eternal, and Simple, and Pure, (and
therefore fully capable of all things) compositum, being latter to the things
whereof compounded, and also contains varieties, which produce Motion and
Change, is also Good and Perfect; for Vice and Imperfection, are deviations
from a true Operation, and departers from Eternity. It has also in it self an
Infinite Perfection of all things that have Being, or that any Being wants, or
can imagine: For, Nil dat, quod non habet: This first Being is therefore a Pure
Act, and therefore (though ever at rest in it self) is always necessarily in
Operation: And therefore (though Simple and One it self) has Word, or
Conception, and Operation, which is not a mere Reflection of his Understanding,
Minding and knowing himself, (though that must be in his perfect Being, and
also, though all Understanding must be his Being, it being the Beginning of all
Ends, as Plotine says) as is generally conceived for an action of Reflection,
Only, is not the full Operation of Reason and understanding, (which this Word
and Conception must be) neither are there thereby produced any external
Operations, they not being of the Essence of the first Being, as appears
hereafter: And also therefore upon external Operations, another Word would
then be substituted; the third Power also, as appears hereafter, would then
also be made up of diverse Beings or Possibilities, which cannot be in Infinity,
as aforesaid. And though Word signify Speech, yet therefore it does not, as
Mercurius Tresmegistus uses it, stand for external Speech only; for that is
not an internal subsistence, nor an eternal necessary Operation of the first
Cause. It is therefore the Internal Adaequate, necessary and eternal
Operation of the first cause, and therefore a Coessentiall, Coequal, Coeternall
Subsistence with it. This Word, as it is the perfect adaequate Operation of his
Understanding, has been by Philosophers, called the Wisdom, and Maker of all
things, as it, wherein all the treasures of wisdom are hid, but as begotten
by him, so called, his Issue or Son: There is also in this first being, a
Spirit or Power, proceeding from it, called by Mercury a Fiery God, which does
infinitely act upon the foresaid Conception or Operation, otherwise, there were
no contentment, yea a mere insensibility in the first excellent active Being;
and also, external operations, would be without vigorous Liveliness and
Effect. This Power was by Ancient Philosophers, called perfect Love, and
Eternal, in relation to the Eternal Operation of the internal word. This
Spirit is also a subsistence, Coessentiall, Coequall, Coeternall with the first
Cause, and Internal Word is for the reasons aforesaid, of the Word, and does
in Order, though not in Being, proceed from the first Being, through the Word,
though not Begotten, as the Word is from the first Being. As there are these
three (Power, Wisdom, Goodness) (rather Powers than Persons, as most term
them) so there are no more; for all other Operations must be external, and
pass emanantly out of the Agent: neither can these Internal be multiplied,
they being necessary and proceeding from one, absolutely single, and
Indivisible, even Unity it self, as aforesaid: there are therefore no further
Operations of Consultation, and holding Parliaments by this perfect infinite
Trinity, as many men express, whereby a fourth subsistence for the reasons
aforesaid, of the Word and Spirit, would be substituted, which is inconsistent
with the Being, and infinite Perfection of this Trinity; This first Being as
aforesaid, causing all other Things, there is not any thing that has an
eternal Being with it, but must be from it: All other things therefore are
produced as the Terminus, a Quo, (though not as the Materia ex Qua; whereupon
the Philosophers grounded an absolute impossibility, and therefore not at all
Feasible, no not by an infinite cause) of nothing; the general Vote of the
later Philosophers following Aristotle, that they are eternal, because ex
nihilo nihil fit, is therefore erroneous, and holds not (though between nothing
and something, though not between something and nothing, as appears before,
there be an infinite distance) concerning the acts of an infinite Agent, with
whom infinite things are as finite, and as feasible, by a bare Emanation,
without any Motion or Mutation, in any pre-existent matter: And if there were a
precedent Chaos, then this unlick'd confused Chaos should be infinite and
perfect, etc. and then there would be two Eternities, and the one should have
Power over the other, neither of which can be, as aforesaid. And why may not
the matter be created, (as the Terminus a Quo) of nothing, as the former?
according to the Platonists Tenent, the Form being by their opinion the
higher: And if there were Matter, there would be also Form; for without it,
(or deformity it self, which then would be the Form of it) there is no matter;
and so against their opinion, by their opinion, a World is to be Eternal. But
how can a Chaos? which has neither Understanding nor Sense, but is the
comprehendable Object of them, contribute to them, which are so far above it?
Do not the Philosophers thereupon agree, that there are diverse things in
Nature, which must have other kind of Beginning than from a Chaos? Do not the
constant defects and prevarications of all kinds, argue, that the matter
desires to revert to its Original and Terminus a Quo, after its confusion even
to nothing? It is therefore proportionable to a higher Understanding, that it
is made from nothing; for the disproportion arises only from the not
apprehending the power of the Agent: And so it is a truth above our Reason, but
not against it: we apprehend it not, it being above our Sphere, and ability
of working. This Creation is made from the first cause, through the Word, by
the Spirit, they being entirely coessentiall in Order aforesaid, and is
external, and therefore not at all essential (they also being temporary and
measured) nor necessary in any kind (as the Aristotelians would have it)
either as an effect, or for the use, and behoof of the first Being, though the
Word, Making it, be necessary. And therefore though this Essence be a Pure
Act, yet external Operations may be deferred; And as the Philosophers say, he
was Eternally in himself, and therefore also might have done external
Operations, (as the Creation of Spirits, etc.) even from Eternity; and
therefore this world might be from Eternity, though not eternal, by Creation.
It is made by Word, there is no precedent Matter; and this Word must have an
infinite Spirit, which by the Ancient Philosophers, is called, the external
Word. The Conclusion therefore is, that a most Excellent, Eternal, Infinite
first Cause, necessarily begetting a Coessential, Coequall, Coeternall Word;
from which necessarily proceeding a Coessentiall, Coequall, Coeternall Spirit,
through and by them has Created all things Good, according to pleasure. And
though (as Mercurius says) he is best expressed in silence, no Name or
Description being able to reach him by an infinite Distance; yet it being
necessary to have some expression whereby to Mean him, he shall be termed out
of the Premises, Jehovah, and (with Plotine) described that He is, what He is:
It is therefore evident, (though no Syllogisticall Demonstration lies in the
Case, it being a Cause) Per demonstrationem in Orbem, That it is not Fear, or
Weakness of Nature, which Creates a God, (according to the Atheists Opinion)
though it also proves a God, as appears more hereafter.

Of its End, in its external Operations.
BY Negation, there might be more uttered, of this great Jehovah; but that
being only private, and it appearing that our Apprehensions and Judgments are
to attribute the highest unto him, a negative Manifestation shall not further
be insisted upon, but a further positive knowledge of him, comes not within
the sphere of Reason, it being a Created thing which cannot comprehend its
maker, and whereby Creatures below it are also but in part known, he being
thereby discovered only ab effectu: and as the predicate is included in the
nature of the Subject, and appearing to us only wonderful, which is a weak
broken knowledge, therefore also not fitly further to be enquired into; but as
the Philosopher Damascius says, is to be honored in silence; our
Apprehensions carrying no proportion to that Essence, and our judgments unable
to conceive it; our imagination partakes only of corporeal things, and is but
a part of our sensitive faculty: And though our Understanding is the higher
part of us, yet we do not understand but through the Senses, though above
them: (And so it may be said, there is something in the Understanding, which
never was in the Senses;) And therefore I may justly judge that to be which I
cannot apprehend. My finite narrow Understanding, also must be astonished and
confounded, in further Inquiry in it; for finite cannot understand infinite:
Settle I therefore my judgment, maugre the jealousies of Apprehension (which
not any Truth is Proof to withstand) yea, or the narrow confounded Conceits
(which necessarily are in my understanding, as aforesaid) which (not
acknowledging Aristotle's conceit, That alteration must consequently be in
Jehovah, if the World be not Eternal, it no more (yea not so much) altering
him, than the Argument alters me) think it much forsooth, that there should be
an Infinite Being so absolute One, (though of necessity it must be so, as
aforesaid, being so solitary, as not to have, or admit any other, (the which
denotes only imperfection, to be relieved by another) yea such a Being, which
neither has Beginning, or Capability of End (though they are mere
Contradictions, as aforesaid) yea they become confounded, with their own
Nonsense and Contradictions; That it should be of it self, yet altogether
without it self, fix I my Poles, and Atlas, upon this certain Truth, to guard
this understanding, non-plussed, not by due reason, which has agreed unto me,
these very things; but by astonishment, being dazzled by them, which is to be
expected, as aforesaid; and not look for more Light than noonday, or suspect
an understanding and heart so much my own, etc. (The same things also, must
be agreed, upon any supposition whatsoever: As if Aristotle would state the
world to be Eternal, etc.) But though I am not capable of further knowledge of
his Essence, yet it ought not to drive me backward: But seeing all my good and
happiness depends, and must be terminated upon him, Inquire I of him, wherein
he may, and is to be known, so far as belongs to man's Duty, and is requisite
to Man's Good and Happiness; which must consist in knowing and doing what he
has appointed to be known and done, by man. Inquire I therefore, what he
wills in his Creatures, which will be gathered and concluded from his End in
the Creation; and the Qualifications and Indowments of the Creatures, they
being the Laws whereby they are to work, and behave themselves: It is
certain, every voluntary Operation, is done for some end; and the better the
Operation is, the more proportionable, and determined is the purpose of it: As
the best Operation is from him, so the highest the creature is able to
perform, and most determined, must the end of it be; honor and worship
therefore, (man being fitted for it, as appears hereafter) (which is the
perfection of Glory) is to be performed unto Him: And also a right mannagement,
or behavior among the Creatures (though that therefore cannot be the sole end
of the Creation, as some conceive, every Operation being done for the Makers
End, and not for the end of the thing made:) Good and Happiness therefore
consists in doing these, it being the true and full Operation of the Creature
so made: And it must be done, because determined. This end of his Operation
terminates upon Man, and upon no Creature below him; for the Creature must be
fitted, and have a proportion to that, for which it is appointed, (beside the
fitness of the matter appointed) and those that are fitted, and have a
peculiar proportion, must be so appointed, otherwise the Actions of Jehovah
would be vain: The other Corporeal Creatures are not able to know any thing,
of any Spiritual thing, as the first Essence is, as aforesaid; or of honor and
worship due unto him, as aforesaid; or the Dictates of Reason, what is Good, or
Bad, etc. But keep only a sensual single course, being guided by the Rule of
Sense only. But man, (duly qualified in his Reason, although he differs not
in any visible Principle from Beasts) pierces into the Greatest, and most
Contrary Material things together, and is the better for it, makes universal
Conclusions, and will not be confined by particulars, takes material things
abstractedly, and merely in understanding, knows also his own material
Being, and therefore he is more than any such Being: Is able also to conceive
of Virtue and Vice, Reason and Wisdom, Folly and Madness; which proceeds not
from any Consequence, or Excellency of Sense (as some would have it) It being
altogether of an abstracted nature, is able (notwithstanding his great
Depravation, as hereafter appears) to perceive, and judge of spiritual
things, yea the great Jehovah, and that he is to be Honored, and Worshipped,
and that by him, as aforesaid; he is likewise appointed for Eternity, although
it cannot be proved, as many endeavor it, from the very Being of his Soul,
(yet tell not what his Soul is, not any finite created thing, being able, to
understand its utmost and highest grounds; for it gives the power to Understand
and Judge) for that Contraries do not pursue, but as they ensue one another,
in understanding; and though destructive, each to other, maintain the mind,
and themselves to, each from other; and for that the mind (as they suppose) is
not liable, to outward or inward violence, in respect of the near Conjunction
of his mind and body, and that so outwardly correspondent with other Creatures,
which therefore their further blind, and lame Arguments, from the eyes and
legs, maimed, either in the Instrument, or sensitive Faculty, without
prejudice to the understanding, reach no more than my horse: And in respect the
Reasons which should prove it, to be Eternal in its very Being, must be from
the soul it self, which is finite, and therefore cannot be eternal in it
self, as aforesaid; yet in respect of the Temper and operation of the mind,
it will lively and indenyable appear, that it has pleased Jehovah to appoint
him for Eternity: For man understands any material temporal Things, and is
not satisfied with their fullness, but they are empty and unsatisfactory unto
him: There is nothing great in this Material world to man, nothing in man to
his soul, and therefore takes full delight and enjoyment in Spiritual
Eternal things; I^ vast and unlimited in the Desires and Operations of his
mind, and is only to be satisfied in the great Jehovah, who therefore is to
be the Eternal Object, of his Understanding; he is also able to understand
Mortality, and its difference from Immortality: So that when he argues for the
former, he is concluded by the latter; but the desire attributed to him, to
continue his Memory by his Statues, Writings, etc. and produced, in evidence
for his Immortality, is but Temporary, and in respect of man, and many times a
world is short of it: Neither can he have the Imaginary ability ascribed unto
him, to apprehend subsequent Eternity, though not precedent, he being finite.
But whether he is sensible, that upon his dissolution his soul dies not with
him, and seeks for comfort in another place, seeing one must be dead first,
before it can be determined, it must here be let alone by me, till it shall be
determined, how it has pleased Jehovah to appoint him for Eternity. Of which
hereafter.

Man's soul therefore, according to Gallens second better opinion, is of a
better being, than the perfectest material, temporal Being, his Form
likewise is toward Heaven, and his Aspect looks to Eternity. And if he be not
Eternal, why is he possessed with good or bad affections concerning a
succeeding Being? Are not Justice and Injustice mere fopperies, and Virtue and
Vice only fantastical, if there be not a succeeding time (and therefore
Eternal, as appears hereafter) for Rewards and Punishments, there being not
any good without its bad, no Virtue without its Allay here in this World, since
Man's depravation, as appears hereafter? (So that humane actions receive their
sentence in this world, only according to the exigences of Mutation, and that
justly in Foro saeculi, it being fit and proper to the Condition and Temper of
their Real Being, the sentence belonging to them upon their Internal,
Eternal Being, only is by Jehovah, to whom only vengeance, and the absolute
universal Power, to sentence belongs.) And therefore exact Virtue and
Goodness is neglected, and a certain sufferer in this World, and a Politic
Vice the flourisher, and the fortunate: And therefore also, why do vicious
Actions, though laid under the obscurest Mantle, and above all temporal
control bring Anxieties, (not to be relieved, by any temporal thing (though
through depravation and darkness of mind, there may be a slumber, and
insensibility of them:) and therefore are not the punishments, as some would
have them, they also not being, but as fearing punishments, which must be
Eternal, as appears hereafter) upon Man? and good delight to the Perfectest,
the greatest. Likewise, if we consider the Perfection of Jehovah's External
Operation, the Creation of the world; And also the Perfection of his Providence
(which is of necessity upon his Being, and his Creatures depending, as
aforesaid, (contrary to the opinion of the Epicures) unlike it self) (though it
be (as it must be) granted, Man's best Fortune to consist in the best things. If
thou have goodness and Knowledge, what if another partake of perfect Health?
and Beauty? of Honors? or Pleasures? Or the earthinesse of Riches? Who would
get by the Exchange? These things are too low for Jehovah to give, or man to
receive: And though it must be granted, this Providence being according to his
Being, must be beyond our Apprehensions, in ordering present Ills, to some
great succeeding good) they will evidence that there is a further account to be
made: The soul of man therefore, contrary to Pliny, Lucian, Lucretius,
Epicurus, and others of that Habit, which only judge Corporeally, and
Sensually, and confine themselves to the Operations of their sensitive Power,
is appointed for Eternity; And their sensual low conceits, not reaching
Reason, which is the height, and true Nature of man, should no more prevail
with us, than their mad Opinions, as Atheists, as aforesaid. Have not all
People, Wise and Foolish, acknowledged a Deity? (of which the Scicilian
Saturn, Cham the son of Noah, was counted the Father. Vain Superstition is
here a good Natural Witness for true Religion) to whom Honor and Worship was
to be given by them; and thereupon also, That Man is for Eternity, Religion,
Providence, and Man's Immortality being inseparable, as before, (beside which
nothing was general in the World, and therefore was not received into the
ears by Tradition, but must be natural, the Religions also being so
different, of which hereafter.) Have not the most learned, and most perfect of
mankind, perceived and rejoiced, even to Ravishment in Immortality? Have not
those of the contrary Faction, been held generally vain? Man is to take his
Directions from the General and most Perfect: Error, Beastliness,
Insensibility may go with others, and the Natures of most Creatures have sway
and powerful Operations in particular men; can therefore such a Conclusion be
consented unto, that Man is happy only when he is Beastly? It is not therefore
a mere Fancy in man, that there is an Eternity for him, because (as Pliny
says) he has a mind swelled by Ambition to be Immortal. Nor is it a vain
speculation of a strained apprehension, or a Conclusion which has been
received into the ears by man, and intoxicated his Brains, and so exercises
a superstitious Tyranny over his mind: Neither is there only a mere
capability in Man, to receive the Impressions of the Universal mind, (as the
Sun enlightens all eyes) wherein the variety should arise, either in respect
of the diversity of Actual Imaginations, or Possible, by reason of
Constitutions, as Averrhoes, and Alexander Aphridiceus, flashingly imagined;
for then all men could not agree in some things, and then also, all of the same
Constitution must in all; and therefore then, they two, could not so
immediately have disagreed about the manner of the variety of Reception: Also,
no man could then vary from his Imagination and Will; neither could he imagine
any thing, but he must understand it: and also, there must then be a sudden
Perfection of understanding and knowledge, without study and endeavor; Man's
soul likewise by them is held to be only One, therefore the sensitive and
vegetative Powers arise also from receiving the Impressions of the universal
Mind. This soul is also, therefore, an Image of Jehovah, having a Resemblance
of Him, and Spiritual Things, as the Body has of the World, and Temporal
Things. There is therefore no Pithagorian Transmigration of Souls in the
Literal Sense, but only as aforesaid; this Transmigration being no
satisfaction to Justice, as appears hereafter; Nor any Punishment or Pain,
but rather an Indulgence, suitable to a regenerate soul: And therefore the
other Creatures, (yea the most loathsome, seemingly vain, or refractory) being
only proper for the use and Powers of Man, are therefore, as Hermes says,
appointed for his use and service. The Conclusion therefore, that Jehovah
created man, to Honor him in his Infinite Perfection, Power, Wisdom,
Goodness, (as the lower Entities do the other) to Worship him with Fear and
Love, for giving him such an excellent Being, with such several Comforts and
Delights; And to demean themselves fitly among themselves, and toward the
other Creatures.

How this End should be Performed: And of the ill Finding, and Performing.
IT appearing that Man is to give Honor and Worship, even the fullness of
Glory to Jehovah, and also rightly demean himself toward Mankind, and the
other Creatures; It is necessary to determine wherein they consist, and what is
the full performance of them, which must appear, upon taking a full
consideration of the Premises, concerning Jehovah, and also a true Examination,
of the Qualifications of Man, they being the Laws whereby he is to behave
himself, as aforesaid, what therefore is proportionable and fit for us to do,
Directly or Relatively, as the Rule for our performances. But stay, we are, and
always have been, deeply taxed with Prevarication; and that we are disabled of
those proportionable Endowments wherewith we were fitted, that we are now
become full of Inconstancy, Weakness, Vanity, Vice, that our Opinions are
merely Complexionall, and that we will adhere to them, more than to the
clearest closest Truths; And that we will sacrifice our selves in this our
madness to any lawless Opinions; and such our desperate and disorderly
frenzinesse, it is therefore necessary for us to examine our selves: For till
we have rightly disposed, or balanced, or fadomed our selves, our
Apprehensions, Judgments, Wills, and Affections, must be, not only as we are
distempered, but also lead us amiss. It appears before, that Originally we
were Right, and being created by Jehovah, for those ends aforesaid, we had
therefore ability so to continue, without any Inclination, or disposition to
the contrary: Blasphemous therefore is the opinion, which concludes a necessity
of man's prevarication, in that he consists of Contraries, which warring
civilly among themselves, must procure it. Be it agreed to conclude man now
fallen; As Jehovah created Man good and perfect, from nothing, so he created
him to continue so, from nothing, as aforesaid: It is not therefore necessary
that man should fall, though it appears of necessity that he is fallen, which
will be made also apparent, in each particular, by sifting the endowments of
man particularly. It appears before, we were made to give full Honor and
Worship to Jehovah, etc. But are we not now scarce able to acknowledge him,
whom we ought to Honor and Worship? And unable to conceive the Honor and
Worship which is to be done unto him, (of both which more hereafter:) Neither
have we any free constant disposition, and motion to perform it. Our minds
also are grown fully and wholly ill and vicious, and are as infectious one unto
another, as a Plaguefore in one body is to another: Our minds delight in
madness, and it is a pleasant thing sometimes to be foolish, and there is not
any vanity which will not produce; our sensitive Power has now the chief Rule
of us, and even devoured our Understanding, and we run Riot, being violently,
wilfully, and without regard of Understanding and Knowledge, of Goodness, or
the Honor and Worship due to Jehovah, which are shaken off as unjust
Tyrannies, transported to our Fancies and Lusts: Yea, our Understanding has
also made a League too with it, is become a mighty inventer of Mischiefs, and
prosecutes them with Ignominious Industry, whereby we are become a Torment to
our selves and others. Do we not chiefly inslave our selves, to sensual,
momentany, earthly things, and care not for Goodness, Advance of
Understanding, and those Durable things, which properly belong to us? But as
Plutarch says, We are far worse than Beasts, which keep their courses and
measures: Where is that charitable Affection? that sociable, suitable behavior?
that simple eaven clearenesse, which is due to our fellow Creatures? Sure it
consists not in Savage Gripings, Extortions, or Fawnings; in Simulations, and
Professions of Virtue and Goodness, thereby to gain advantage to our selves:
and setting the stamp of Virtue and Goodness only upon that which conduces
to our own Ends: Nay, there is no exact Virtue and Goodness to be found, no
Mundane Graces without their spots, (it not consisting in covering or avoiding
Vice, or doing good, for something else;) no Good without its Bad: And
therefore as it is useless and unprofitable here, so also it is not safe (I
mean a Noble and universal Virtue, and Goodness, not a severe Habit, for
particular Occasions, which is the highest Vice habiting her self with, and
seating her self in the place of Virtue) but is of necessity, to be
Artificial, and receives its estimate according to its Condition here, from
the Proportion it carries, with the Exigencies of Mutations: What need our
Moral Instructions, our Laws and Governments, (which were impertinent, but
that we are Fools and Knaves) if we are not out of Order? But how should this
come to pass? Certainly man could not set himself to work out his own
Ruin; nor could he take Pet against Jehovah, or have a mind averse from
serving him; neither would Jehovah carry any hard hand over him: It must be
therefore some Pride, or such aspiring, overweening carriage, as Plotine,
Mercury, and Hieroclius say, that must procure this disability: Upon which
overweening, aspiring carriage, must follow of all; not to its true height and
sovereign goodness, but to Vanity and Darkness, below it self, even to
Sensuality; Virtue and Goodness being wounded, and annihilated by ruining
Vice: And Virtue and Goodness dying, Man cannot but dye to Goodness. Which
has been of long long continuance, even beyond all humane Antiquity, (yet must
arise from One, from whom all have descended, all being so alike defiled, and
arises not from any Constellation, or Imitation) and for ought as appears
yet, it may be from Eternity, it appearing before the World, may be from
Eternity: However Jehovah is Eternal, and therefore Man is an infinite
Transgressor; And so has with all his Pudder, reduced himself to a infinite
worse condition than just nothing: Consider we but the Vanities, Vices,
Hobgoblins, of one days Words, and Actions, what say we when we shall have
such a Collection of our whole lives? When we shall see such Forests of Wild
Beasts, and such Sources of Errors and Vices? and yet we are not Sensible of
these Truths; and therefore we are Ill to Death, and our Malady is Mortal, or
rather Immortal: It appearing Man is an infinite Transgressor, and that there
is an Eternity for man to come, wherein are Rewards and Punishments; and
therefore Punishments being our due, we must expect an Eternity in Punishment.
What course shall we take to be freed from this overwhelming Misery? Can an
Infinite Excellent Being be brought to enter into a Reconciliation with a mere
Animal, an unjust nothing, which has entered into a Rebellion against his
Sovereign Good, for mere Vanity? Thereby destroying the end of his determined
Operations, as aforesaid: What if there be Perfection of Heroic Virtue in
him, keeping him from Revenge, and taking occasion to torment Man; but making
him, slight, yea pity him? Yet it appears he is necessarily just, and cannot
admit Vice to go unpunished: What if man humbled himself, for that the
Trespass was by Pride? yet was not justice satisfied, and right administered,
though there be therefore Infiniteness of Heroicke Virtue in him, and Humility
enough in us: yet against the Opinion of Hierocles, (because sure he could go
no further) man, unless he make satisfaction to Justice, cannot be discharged:
And how can Man that is finite, suppose he were not vicious in all his Actions,
satisfy for his Offense Infinite, as aforesaid? Only, by suffering an
Infinite time, that, which he being finite, cannot suffer in time; therefore
he cannot be relieved for that satisfaction to Justice must be given by that
very kind which has offended. Well therefore may the Platonists confess,
That they know not how it may be done; yet it appears, that one man's
satisfaction, will satisfy Justice for all: for it is not a mere personal
fault in man, as the Philosophers hold, but is in the Nature of man, it coming
by one man's fault, as aforesaid; and therefore exact Justice is satisfied by
one man's suffering: But it appears before, as impossible for man to give
satisfaction, as for a finite thing to make an infinite: There can therefore
be no means for Man's Relief, but from Jehovah himself, even miraculously;
And therefore miracles must be done to make it known unto us. And has not
this Excellent Infinite Jehovah, to Actuate his Goodness and Wisdom,
ordained some way, whereby Man may be discharged? Is he not Infinitely
merciful, and as much Mercy as Justice? and does it lie suspended, though it
be a pure Act, as aforesaid: And seeing many have found out their
prevarication, and disabilitie, and endeavored to have avoided it, as
aforesaid; Has not Mercy strove with Justice for a Reconciliation? Are not all
men absolutely in this case? And does not Jehovah desire, even Will, that there
be a performance of the End of his External Operations, and that there should
be a joyful partaking of Eternity for man (and a Reparation of the Ruin
introduced by the Fall of Lucifer and his Angels, as some conceive) as at first
was allotted? Sure it is not in the strength, much less in the weakness of
man, and in his possible imperfections, to hinder him: And sure there is some
way of accommodation, otherwise Justice would long ago have seized upon many,
even temporally here. Also Jehovah is as Infinitely merciful, beyond our
Conceivings, as his Being is, as aforesaid. Let it be carefully considered
therefore in our ensuing Discourse, if any such action can be discovered, and
then stick we there, when we are well; and there must we find the Excellent,
Infinite Jehovah, as aforesaid; And it will be an undeniable Argument, That we
are in the ready way to perform the end of his External Operations. Therefore
also the true examination of the Indowments, and Operations of man, must be
transacted, with a mind Strong, Fair and sound, and duly tempered, freed
from all Self-love, Intemperancies, Vanities of Imagination, and Anxieties;
Goodness and Simplicity must possess the heart: Then let a clear, bright,
high understanding, advanced and regulalated by Arts and Experience, take the
strict Dictates of our own minds; then soar abroad and take a view, of the
Virtues and Goodness of old time, (and of all times) and let their Actions
where they are Good and Virtuous, be a Proof even Demonstrative unto us, they
being near the Truth; for though the knowledge of the Creatures, and things
produced by reason, receive Advance and Perfection in time, yet ingrafted
Principles cannot, they being not capable of Addition; and also they being
near an Obliteration, through our Prevarication, as aforesaid: Observe we
therefore, what the strong, Good, unsuspected Sages, and Fathers have left unto
us; And that no Errors, Vices, Deviations may defile us, let not any Custom of
manner of Education, Tradition, Ipse dixit, virtus specifica contra negantem
Principia; no ornament of Speech, no Extravagant or specious Pretenses, or
Actions, exercise any Tyranny upon our duly enfranchised mind, or put a Cheat
upon us, with Error to boot. The Conclusion therefore is, That man could have
known, and done, the end for which he was made; but that he is totally
prevaricated, unable to satisfy Offenses past, to know or do for the time to
come, and must use his best means to look out for his Cure and remedy.

Where is the true Rule for Performance; And the way for full Restoration.
IT appearing that herein must be set down the true Rule for the performance
of Iehovah's End in its External Operations, which must be done as we would
have Good and Happiness, and avoid Infelicity: As also that here must be
discovered our Cure and Remedy, whereby we may be relieved against our
extreme Disabilities and ensuing misery, as aforesaid; Use therefore is to be
made of our most Impartial, truest examinations, and exactest diligence; we
being utterly and Eternally wretched, if it be mistaken. This Rule of
Performance, (usually called Religion, as the Tie or Bond upon the Creature to
perform the Duties belonging to the Creator) is but one, in Substance; for
Jehovah is but one, to whom it is to be performed; and all men are absolutely
in the same Condition, as aforesaid. This Religion requires only such
Performances, as are Proportionable for Man to know and do to Jehovah; and as
are agreeable to the Powers and Qualifications of Man, as aforesaid: wherein
though there are General and Grievous Disabilities; yet man's mind duly
disposed, has Ability to discern and judge rightly, as before; For though it
appears, Man lost his good Qualifications, yet not his Reason and
Understanding, we also continuing men as before: and it appearing also
hereafter, that Jehovah has appointed a way for man's Direction and
Restoration. Let us therefore examine our Religion by them; and in those
things for Knowledge or Action, which consist in Quality, as Goodness,
Badnesse, Virtue, Vice, either Positive, or in Degrees, Let us therefore
embrace them, though they are thwarting, or above our present Tempers and
Natures. Therefore we cannot miss the Truth, for that either there has been,
or will be, some right Service and Worship performed unto Jehovah, it being the
end of his external Operations, as aforesaid, whereof he cannot be
disappointed or hindered. Examine we therefore the Religions of the World,
Beginning before the four first Monarchies, (which cannot be very far from
the Infancy of the World; for then was the Invention of Sciences, there being
also not many People, or any Record or Memorial extant of further time, but
only that there had been a general Deluge of the World: yet all Sciences
could not thereby be quite destroyed and forgotten, seeing some of Mankind
did and must remain, neither their Memorialls totally destroyed; for their
Letters were ingraved in Tables of Lead, etc. And sure there was but this one
general Deluge, for the Reasons given before: And also, sure we should have
had some notice of them, as of this and other Particular Deluges.) Hermes,
says one, the true God, made man; Man made gods; and into these Images,
Fiends, Evil Spirits, partly voluntarily, partly by the Art Magic of Man,
entered into them, and were worshipped by men; and that Mercury shi Grandfather
at that time was worhispped as one of the greatest gods, he having set up his
Statue, and by Art Magic, brought a Fiend into it. Thus was Religion, except
the Religion declared by Moses, who lived in Egypt, which Religion is the most
Ancient, that is recorded or remembered; of this Religion, (our end and stay is
there) hereafter. In the Monarchies among the Assyrians, there were so many
gods, as Towns, among the Persians, as Stars, among the Grecians, as
Fancies, among the Romans, as were in the World (and more too) except only the
true God, as appears hereafter; which was not there admitted, though allowed
some respect by them, in the Country of the Jews, because (as Cicero says)
That God beseemed not the Majesty of their Empire ( Anabis and Pryapus did.) It
is true, the great Jehovah became not that Majesty of their Empire, which was
not only as High but Above their Worshipful gods, which were created by it,
whose Temples were their Tombs: The Devotions done unto them, Old Wives Tales,
Their Originals, Educations, Life's, Deaths, Pedigrees, may be easily set down:
for Varro has been very careful of his gods, lest (as he says) they might
partake of so great a misfortune as to be lost. Sure it is impossible, that so
learned, so gallant a Man should be so senseless, so mad Quoad hoc; so that
it is to be thought, he feared men (as well he might do) more than those his
gods. Well then might this be a time to make men gods; their flattering
Minions making them by their Images and Idols mere Idiots; yea the most
vicious, unhewen, and Beastliest men (for none else sure would be) sought to
be, and were made gods forsooth. We will not meddle more to open our
Predecessors Nakedness, than to perceive the truth of things; only the honest
Tooth-Drawer, god Esculapius, (no less I promise you) because the half-headed
Julian forsook Jehovah for him, (wherein this our Discourse renders him more
Knave than Fool) because he had not so good a mind to serve Jehovah as
Abraham did, it being but of latter time we cannot so easily pass over; Julian
has been at the pains, in Honor of him, to draw this wonderful gods
Pedigree from Jupiter; and descending by the Sun, styled him Child of Heaven:
but seeing no less Pdi gree will serve his turn, under Favor I shall style
him this once. Child of the Earth: for he was (as a man may say) A Bastard, be
it by Apollo's Priests, or Apollo himself, (it matters not whether) by fair
Corinis: Poor Julian thou art a little mistaken; For Coronis was but one of
the lower Form, Venus at most. What though these Gods (that would be resembled
by Images, man's workmanship, and those none of the best neither, but ugly
infavoured Images (like themselves) wherein they were as wise as their
Worshipers, who may very well go together) have done things beside the
ordinary course of man, (it is very hard if their Fiend, their Devil, or their
Godhead could not do something extraordinary) As their Hocus Pocus
Legerdemaine Miracles, which were not done, but to their Favorable, Gentle
Spectators, who at most, had rather trust than try. And their Prophecyings,
(the wisest whereof those at Delphos were usually infused into young Wenches by
their Privy parts) which were always in generalties and and incertainties, and
ordinarily in the untruths too; and were done only by Natural Causes, Apollo
diverse times complaining, that he could not resolve things moved unto him, the
Position of the Stars being diverse from his Observation and Rules. And it is
said, that Man is capable to do any such Actions, yea any Action that a Fiend
can do; Man's soul is an Image and Resemblance of spiritual things as the
body of temporal things, as aforesaid: And these Actions were done by vicious
Agents, their Actions being vicious, dishonorable to Ichovah, and Mankind
also. The Services done to these gods were not only Vicious, but Cruel and
senseless, men Offering their Children, and themselves unto them: Actions that
proceed not from the Qualifications of Man, as aforesaid: And all the mysteries
of their Service were but Schools of Villainy: yea these Gods themselves being
more capacious, and partaking of a greater Latitude of Evil, commanded even
the greatest Evils to be done, over and above their Ordinary Service, as a
satisfaction due unto them. Also as Cicero observes; Why was there not a course
taken concerning the Inward Motions of the Mind? Or a punishment for them? Nay
there was no Prohibition or Punishment, but fullest Instructions, and directest
means were made use of by these gods themselves, for the utmost Advance of all
Vice and Brutishness, and for the making of Men, Devils indeed, like
themselves. The inward evils, the evil of the heart, is known only by
Jehovah, the true God, who made the mind, and knows it; and with which he is
chiefly to be honored and worshipped, as before: Is there here any
satisfaction to justice for man's offenses, which must be in the true Religion,
as aforesaid? Can it consist in the Barbarous killing of Men and Children?
which can be no other than Heaps of Villainy, and Blasphemies against Jehovah,
or in Offering to him the Quintessence of Vice? an Offering for the devil. It is
too evident these kinds of gods reach not our former Conclusions, and there
are too many of them to be good: Vanity therefore, and beastly Brutish
Idolatry was and is in a great part of the World, which (to satisfy only
their Follies, not meddling further with their vices) under a Tyrannical,
Ignoble, Scoundrell Superstition, even to the shame and abashment of Mankind,
make finite weak Beings, foolish mad Opinions, and Conceits, yea meare
Phantasmes a Deity, their God; Though if we should pieke and choose, some of
their Gods were Men, some of them as Gods, and some as Devils among men, yet
dependant and Mortal, not Gods of Men. The sayings of some of their wise men,
which would speak out a little, nay of a whole Nation, that they were not
clean sottish, to account such things gods, but only allowed them a
superiority for some excellency in them, (Although it is true, Civil Respect
was only in the Beginning thereof; but afterward being disguised in History
became changed) clears them not of it; For those that they accounted of for
Civil Government, or State-Merit, or notorious villainy, were by them
worshipped, as Demi Inferior Gods: Those which found out or performed, and
perfected, some material Thing, for the sustenance or well Being of Man, had
the highest Worship, as to the greatest gods, done unto them; Scavola a High
Priest among the Romans ranked his Gods into Poetical, Philosophical, and
Political, whereof some of them were not at all to be known by the People.
Having had enough of these gods, Come we now (discarding all Thought or Memory
of them) to the other Religion, which is ancientest, and was received in
Palestine, Canaan, or Judea, by the Israelites or Hebrews, which obtained the
Province of Syria to themselves; with whom alone from the Creation of the world
the Knowledge and Worship of the true God, and the first form of speech
continued, and is contained in a Book usually called the Old Testament, not
destroyed, or corrupted, or altered, in the many sad Desolations of that
Kingdom, or the Ruins of any time; that in the Front contains; In the
Beginning God Created, etc. And in all points as there manifestly appears
runs parallel both in Relation to the Creator, or Creatures, either in
themselves, or in Relation one unto the other, either directly or consequently,
with our former conclusions: And therefore it is the true Religion; And
therefore, and for the Reasons hereafter we must agree with all those which
have received it, That the Book called the Old Testament, was compiled by the
special Ordination and Assistance of Jehovah in man, notwithstanding the
Objections, That it appearing Man has the proportion in him as aforesaid; And
also for that the Israelites had express rules by Tradition, to relieve their
disabilities, contracted by Man's Prevarication; for they would not have
received and undergone many things, therein contained, as upon the Opinion and
Will of a Man; And for that the great Jehovah, would sure have done it by some
higher course, whereby it would have appeared clearly and manifestly to have
been done by him; Therefore it may be done by man only, who is too ready to
do mischievous Actions, and to fall into Error, to which Suspicion and Doubt
it is liable. But this cannot be the sole Act of man without Gods special
Ordination and Assistance: For man here truly, and always Declares the vices
and weaknesses of himself, and all his, charge and condemns himself and
them fully, and thoroughly; affects not Reputation or Honor, or any thing, but
neglects and waves Honor, Ease, and any other thing, and willingly undergoes,
chooses, glories and delights in misery, even death it self that he may
perform Iehovah's Honor and Worship, and declare the good and right way,
though there was no formal humor thereof, then in fashion. And though merit
and Praise were worthily allowed there by other Authors, which were no great
Friends; And can these things so near and dear to man, be always waved by
him, without any reservation or alteration? No more zealous or loud, not more
frequent in finding out useful Directions, where Profit, Honor, Popularity,
or some other Interest is concerned, or some glimmering thereof may be
perceived, than where it concerns Iehovab's Honor and Worship, and Goodness,
and Truth, with the loss of them; so that Iehovah's right Honor and Worship,
bare Goodness, and naked Truth, are the full Design, and only End: And in
Order whereunto all of man is fully and wholly waved, and laid aside. It is
also concerning matters Eternal and Infinite, and many other things, not
consequents, or derived from Nature, out Concomitant. And (notwithstanding it
was made not long from the Infancy of the World, when it was but in an
unfurnished condition, as aforesaid) is in the whole fit and proper, and
altogether free from vice and error, (although its subject matter be various,
above the apprehension or conceit of man) and in some parts exceeding full and
significant, (as the containing all virtue and goodness in ten Commandedements
(the which are abridged in two Sentences, Love God with all thy heart, thy
Neighbor as thy self.) Its several Prophesies (being the maine part thereof)
made by several Persons at several Times, so far distant from themselves,
or their accomplishment, so particular, certain, of such concordance, and so
fully accomplished though not at all depending upon Natural Causes, or to be
foretold by them, (which only hold a mean betwixt Necessity and Chance)
although they were fully and exactly known, demonstrate it to have been done
by the Ordination of Jehovah; The Prophets were likewise men stricken in
years; so that though it could be proved, whereas Frustra fit Potentia que
non reducitur in Actum, That Prophesying is a power Natural (or Artificial,
or Daemoniacall, or what they will) as Conceiving is for the present, and
Memory for things past, yet they must have such want of Heat, and defect of
Imagination, that they could not thereby so truly perform it; for it is
agreed, those must be intended, even to destraction, if it be not rationally
concluded from true Principles. Also man of so much Sense and Honor, could not
be so Foole-hardy, upon his own credit, and his bare word, so positively, and
majestically, without Grounds of Reason, and Principles maintaining his
Conclusions, to have justified his discourse, (which though the Philosophers
therefore slighted, though it be an Argument against them, it being also
concerning Principles and Grounds of Being which ought not, not cannot come
within the virge of Proof by Principles, but only be declared) although there
were no written, Footsteps before, and have charged the observance thereof,
even in things of highest Concernment equally upon all. He by whom it was
done, must either be a wise good man, or a foolish and bad man: If he were wise
and good, how dared he to Arrogate so much to himself, even many times the
Person of Jehovah himself? And how could he do such an Act to befoole Man
kind, where there is no Advantage to himself? If he were foolish or bad, how
could he do a good thing so exactly? be so fully for Jehovah's Honor and
Worship, and Man's Welfare? be so thoroughly for virtue and goodness? and trace
so exactly the ways of Truth, the Birth of uprightness? For though the
veriest Devil many times will seem an Angel of Light, yet it is merely an
affected Outside, under a fair visage, to make an Advantage, not to be stable
there, but driving on to some Conclusion Destructive. And although man had such
a Proportion as aforesaid, yet it appears how grievously he is disabled, so
that man in general, nay the greater part, nay the exactest of men, cannot
attain to a due knowledge, nor discover a means for their discharge and
repair; as appears by the confused rambling erroneous Opinions of the able
Philosophers, who though they vented many things concerning our present Truths,
yet in Truth, they missed, (neither can there be gathered from them scarce good
Problemes) they being mixed with so much foppery and vanity; And to attain so
far, they also were either Egyptians, or came into Egypt for Instruction,
or received Moses Principles by Tradition, (though they slighted them, because
there was no Probation of them, yet gave their approbation to them) and
generally the farther in situation of Region, or succession of time, they were
from Moses, the more phantastically, vain and erroneous. That which a wise man
knows also, he delivers not so certainly, and possitively; nor has it
sufficient steadfastness, for as Richelieu joins them, Reason is
contradicting, Nature is corrupted; That also which procured the greatest
Admiration, in the Certainty and Beauty of Truths, which procures the greatest
Delight, is subject to fall off. And Porphiry, one of the exactest Knowers,
notwithstanding his great knowledge, betook himself (as to the surer side for
the Present) to the Faction of the second School of the Epicures. And although
the Israelites had express Rules by Tradition, (yet not concerning most things
contained in this Scripture, neither was the Scripture compiled (except in some
main things) til Tradition was silent: Good and gracious therefore was Jehovah
in giving us our duty Writing, for if we were not able to know the general and
plain parts of it, how should we every particular and higher Action? Jehovah,
before it was written, had tried all other means with us; for when our vices
and errors, had in a manner blotted out the Law, first imprinted on our
Natures, then was there, through a due Constitution of Mind, a Tradition, as
Sir Walter Rawleigh has it, of this Law: It was then the next course, unless
he had left man in his blindness, for Jehovah to take, when man became so
corrupted, that his Law was choked and razed out of Man, and Tradition also,
(except in some few principal things) ceased. This fully satisfies the other
Cavil, for that Jehovah did not in some higher course manifest it and set it
off with a greater clearness, it being concerning ingrafted Principles, and a
Law imprinted upon the Heart; and the next way to Tradition, which was next to
that imprinting of it on man's heart, and therefore certain and sufficient to
man. It follows therefore, notwithstanding the Cavills, That it was made up of
the pickings and chusings of the vanities of former time, (they being so like,
I trow, as appears before) and that it is a Remnant of the Religion of the
former Times, (which is true only, as before, and no more, than as the Truth
is before the Fable,) And that it was the more exact, because the Jews, were
perfect in Astronomy and Magic, (than which nothing is there more forbidden,
nor any thing made more use of, by the false gods, etc.) That, that which is
duly contained in the Old Testament, is done, by a special power, and
Ordination, of Jehovah; It being also clear by the respective Histories of
Nations, (which contain many things, over and above what is therein contained,
though they were no Friends to the Jews) the matters of Fact (being the works
of a God) to be true, And that it was not compiled at one time, and so
cunningly made up, each part to answer the whole, but directly that it was made
in Succession of Time, and at those times either of which the Inditors write;
or those they particularly mention. And though the Jews were but few, (One
true Understanding is better, than a hundred thousand, Counterfeit or
Deficient, it not being there, as in Burdens where through many, help may be
contributed: And we are to follow one cleare-sighted, before a blind or dark
World) and almost in greatest and constant Afflictions (Temporal things be
neither fit for Jehovah to give, or Man to receive) yet thereby every man,
became a Preacher for the True God; and as Seneca observes of that Nation, That
they being overcome always prevailed, and though vanquished, (by what means
he knows not) overcame their Conquerors, and gave Laws and Religion unto
them; For many of the Conquerors acknowledged, the Jews God and his Worship to
be the true: yea, no serious Heathen man ever absolutely denied it: But the
Jews never would acknowledge any other, And rather suffered all miseries than
forsook it. Therefore also notwithstanding this Direction or Rule from
Jehovah, contrary to the forward Conceits of Ignorant, Narrow minds, Man must
be prepared with those things which are required to make him of a true
Understanding and Judgment, For its chief purpose is for the redress and
Direction of Qualities and Manners, as aforesaid; as also for the Inabling our
understandings, where the Best present state of our Natural Abilities are
deficient; It being also subject to several Senses and Constructions, as other
things are, and requiring our Prudence and Understanding. Look we therefore
constantly into that perfect Rule, which therefore will show unto us our ugly
Deformities, whether outward or inward (a Discovery fit only for the true God,
as aforesaid.) And therefore this Scripture will be a Schoolmasters to show
us, and to drive us to look for our proper Cure and Remedy, without which we
remain still utterly lost, as aforesaid; And without such a Cure and Remedy
revealed in it to what purpose? Unles to breed Desparation, which produces
violent fearful effects, which would be but Cruelty and Vanity? Should a Rule
or Scripture be discovered to vicious Man? And also in seeking for a Cure and
Remedy, we must look only toward Jehovah, as aforesaid: And in it we find,
that upon the Examination of the Original sin, there was a Savior declared:
and it appears there, That he should be the Eternal Word the Son of God,
who should take upon him the Seed of man, become flesh, and suffer for man's
sin; there being one Truth in Scripture: and Reason; is not here according to
our former Conclusions, Man to suffer for the Offense, God to overcome? and by
reason of the union contracted with man's Nature, to suffer also thereby to make
up a full infinite Satisfaction, even as Infinite as Jehovah himself, as it
must be, as aforesaid; But as it is not therefore requisite to Justice, so it
is impossible, according to the Conceits of some, That this Word, or Son of God
should suffer in his very Essence, it being the same with Jehovah himself, as
aforesaid. Also, though it were necessary, in respect of Union with the Divine
Nature, that it should be pure, that was to suffer; yet it was not necessary to
Satisfaction, as is conceived, for a sufficient Infinite satisfaction by Man's
Nature must discharge Man kind to exact Justice, as aforesaid. Let us
therefore see if this satisfaction be performed, although it be not necessary,
as some have weakly Imagined, That this should be performed before there is any
Benefit to be received thereby, for a certain, though after performance, of
what is due to Justice is sufficient, especially to Jehovah, to whom, all Time
and Things, are as Actually and Really, as they are in themselves present. In
this Old Testament we find it only declared, not performed: for although in
many parts of it, it speaks a present performance; But that is only in
determination, and benefit of it, at that present time to them: Seek we
therefore if we can find since any performance of it; for it is necessary that
it be sometimes done. In a Book called the New Testament, or Gospel, We
find there was a full punctual performance; This Book running also parallel
with our former conclusions, partaking likewise of the Sense of those Reasons,
which concluded us, that the old Testament was by the special Power and
Ordination of Jehovah in man; we must agree that this is so also, and that the
Savior therein mentioned, is the right Savior. But in this our rational
Discourse, we neither meddle with Jews nor Turks, which admit the Old
Testament, (and especially the Jews) the Controversies chiefly depending upon
Scripture Contents, and therefore is not proper to be decided in this place.
These two Testaments therefore laying down and declaring what man is to know
or do to or concerning Jehovah, and Declaring the Means for man's full
Restoration, has therein all, that man is to know, or do; and Declares
Iehovah's will fully. Here is the true Religion, it declaring a true God, a
right Service, and a sufficient Savior for Mankind: To what purpose serve the
Pagans and Infidells Barbarous Sacrifices, in Offering men Infinite only in
Offenses? The Jews Lamb, a vain and smoaky savor? Mahomets Prayers,
Injuries and Treasons against Jehovah? The Beginnings only and no other, (as
Porphery says) being able for it. And must we not now, in wonder, and
ravishing Astonishment adore the Infinite goodness, Wisdom, and Power of
Jehovah our Creator and Recreator? Was not the Act of our Redemption, the Act
of Wisdom, the second Being in the Trinity: And are not Goodness and Power
Infinitely appearing in it? We are therefore Bound, and Bound again to make
good our second Conclusion, with our Mouths and Hearts, and to kindle our
benumbed Abilities to a constant zealous endeavor of Obedience, making Jehovah
our only end, He being the Aiming Point, for our Understanding and
Judgment, the Perfect welfare for our Will, and the sole continuing resting
Point to the whole man, and far more, in the Fruition, and Actual partaking
of, then in the Desire, or Speculation, which is his sole Felicity, which must
be above that it makes happy: casting away Riches, as Earthly things,
consisting only in Fancy, and Opinion, and mighty procurers of Vice,
uncertain, and not fit to be desired for themselves: Voluptuousness as
Sensuality, soon partaking of Turmoiles and discontents, Unless that of the
Understanding, which is the highest Pleasure, and must terminate on Jehovah, as
aforesaid, Honors, as Blasts of men, and Shadows of other things, even
Vanity, a Multiplication of many Mischiefs for nothing, And Policy which
meddles only with the Vain Things of this world, and and has such a Tincture
and Mixture of Vice and Mischief, (We speak not of true Wisdom (which also
is only a cure to make Mankind it self) the dearest Gift in Nature, borne
to relieve Humane Imbecility, and preserve Humane Society) that it is merely
Brutish. Settle we our selves therefore stable upon our True Interest, as
aforesaid, All other things being either Vicious and Brutish, or Froth and
Smoke, against all Cavills of Imagination, with a firm Resolution, Maugre our
Distempered Natures, which admit, not only our Habitual Complexionall
Opinions, but also our Suspicions and Hearsayes, to oppose and bear down in
our Minds fully proved Truth: So our Reason, shall make us steadfast, and our
Belief, sure.

Let this suffice for our Rational Discourse, upon these Subjects; This
Conclusion being, That the Books of the OLD and NEW TESTAMENT, Commonly
called the Scriptures, are the True and Perfect Rule for the Performance of
JEHOVAH'S Honor and Worship, And that they Declare a Right Way and Means for
Man's full Restoration.
