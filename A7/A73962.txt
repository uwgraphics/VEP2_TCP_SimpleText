royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHereas the custody and safe keeping of our several Counties and Shires of
our Realm of England, are by our ancient Commonlawes committed to several
Shiriffes, being ancient Conseruators of the Peace, and Ministers of Justice
within the same, who by force of their Offices may assemble, and take the power
and strength of our said Counties and Shires committed to their charge, not
only for the due execution of Justice, but also for the preservation of our
Peace, and the speedy and timely dissolution and suppressing of all
Insurrections, Rebellions, outrageous Riots, Routes, and other exorbitant and
unlawful assemblies, to the end that such dangerous attempts might be
suppressed in their beginnings, and our loving Subjects live and exercise their
several vocations in all peace and plenty; The good effect of the execution of
which Laws has well appeared, in that the most detestable and diabolical
Rebellion of Percy and his Accomplices in our Counties of Warwick, Worcester,
and Stafford, (that had been so secretly contrived, and so long in hatching)
was by the peaceable Ministers of our Laws, and by due execution of their
Offices, without any extraordinary power or forces, most loyally, resolutely,
and speedily suppressed: And whereas some question or scruple has been (as we
are informed) moved amongst some of the vulgar, Whether any of our Sheriffs
may, with the Power of their several Counties or Shires, in pursuit of Rebels
and Traitors, follow them into any other County, Albeit by the Laws of this
Realm, Sheriffs, as it falls out in daily experience, in private cases
between party and party (matters of no such eminent and public danger and
consequence as this is) justly and lawfully do the like, whereof We presume
few or none can be ignorant: Yet We meaning to give satisfaction to all, do
hereby publish and declare, That such pursuit of Rebels and Traitors into other
Counties, is not only in such cases lawful and justifiable, But, that if any
of our Subjects being thereunto required by any of our Sheriffs, shall not
follow and assist them in such pursuit, that they are to be severely and
sharply punished for their high contempt and offense in that behalf.

But if in such pursuit the Sheriff of the same County or Shire (whereunto
such Rebels or Traitors shall fly or escape) shall also come with the power of
his County before such Rebels or Traitors be apprehended or suppressed, Then
the Sheriff so pursuing from any other County or Shire shall assist and join
with the Sheriff in his proper County or Shire, for the apprehension or
suppressing of such Rebels and Traitors. And it such Rebels or Traitors shall
fly or escape into any house or other place of strength and defense, and shall
not yield themselves being thereunto required by the Sheriff or any of his
company that so shall pursue them, but obstinately and wilfully make
resistance, That then it shall be lawful for every such Sheriff so pursuing
with such power and strength, as he shall collect, or shall assist him, to
beat down, burn, or otherwise wast any such house or place of defense for
the better apprehension or suppressing of such Rebels and Traitors. And albeit
we desire that such industry and care may be taken, as that such offenders may
be apprehended alive, Yet we let it be known, that if otherwise through their
rebellious obstinacy and resistance, such Rebellion cannot be suppressed; That
it shall be lawful and justifiable in those cases of necessity, for the
Sheriff and his Company assisting him, to kill and destroy such Traitors and
Rebels. And as the faithful endeavors of our loving Subjects with such
alacrity as they have showed in this late Rebellion, is very acceptable unto
us; So if in any such case any person or persons shall under pretense of our
public service, maliciously and unjustly seek to revenge any private
quarrel, We let them know that they shall not escape without severe and
condign punishments according to their demerits in that behalf.

Given at our Palace of Westminster, the nineteenth day of November, in the
third yeereof our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
