The Cities Corporations poor Their Founders bless, their help implore.
THE glorious Founder of the world
Was first in our foundation,
The Parliament was next to him
In our origination:
Englands chief City next to these
Appears in our Creation,
What Hospitals Such Founders have
As our Poors Corporation?
Their Founders death, gave Life and Breath
To Hospitalls Foundation,
Our Founders Life, is Life to us
And to our future Station.
A happy death we pray for such
Whose death breaths Life to others,
Long be our Founders life, whose Life
Inspires exspiring Brothers.
Our first admission was not got
By friends, or Rich Allies,
By great men's lines, by promise made
Of grateful Curtesyes:
Deep poverty did plead our Cause,
The ghost we were up giving,
With naked backs, and hungry Jaws
And worms did eat us Living.
Friendless and harborless were we
Exposed to wind and weather,
And starving under stalls we lay
Wandering we knew not whither.
In filthy rags, we clothed were,
Begging about the City,
That was our case, then was the time
Of our Blessed Founders pity.
For ever blessed be our God,
Blessed be the Parliament,
Blessed be our Corporation,
Blessed, our Lord President, Lord Mayor, for the time being, President.

Blessed be our Friend his Deputy, John Cutler Esquire. Deputy President.

Our Treasurer; and All, Mr Maurice Gething Tresurer.

Whose tender hearts, whose hands, whose purse
Have quit us thus from Thrall.
Our backs, and bellies bless you all
And your Posterity;
We beg, this work begun by you
May have prosperity.
Help, help, blessed Founders, build upon
This newly laid Foundation,
The Generations yet to come
Shall bless your Corporation.
