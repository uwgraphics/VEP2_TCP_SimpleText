The bloody Game at Cards.
THe Commonwealth may in many respects be compared to a pack of Cards,
wherein there is much shuffling, and by ^he hand of Fortune the four Suites
are mingled together, that is the Clubs, the Country Spade men, the rich
Diamond men, and the Loyal hearted Subjects that stand for the King of Hearts
who challenges a Pretogative above them all. This King of Hearts desires that
there might be fair play above board, and has made many Declarations and
Protestations that He intends all fair dealing, and desires only to be King
in His own Commonwealth, and not to be opposed by the Common Cards; But they
little regarding what the King of Hearts power is in the game of the
Commonwealth, presently began to rank themselves into several Suites and
to oppose the King of hearts, and call all the Adherents unto Him malignants;
after the Game of the times had thus far proceeded, a quarrel arose between
the chief Cards who had packed themselves together against the King and the
King of hearts Himself, and the controversy was about the Militia and the
Commission of Array which the King of Hearts sets on foot and would maintain it
to be good fair play, the Common Cards dissented from it, and alleged that
the Militia ought to be in their hands and that there could be no fair dealing
in the Commonwealth if the Kings Commission of Array went forward, hereupon and
upon some ot^e^ dissentions the City Clubs made a great tumult and with staves
clubs ^nnd swords ran to the King of Hearts Hall, and put the King of Hearts
into such an aff^^ght ^^a^ as Himself does express in many of His
Declarations.

The City-Clubs coming thus in a mutinous manner made Him cast about how to
get away from such a pack of knaves, and so forsaking the City Clubs he
purposed chiefly to repose His confidence in that Suite whereof He and His
Father were King, and that was the Loyal Hearts of His other Subjects, and so
away the King of Hearts went and by His fair dealing in the Country His suite
of Hearts was so much increased that he had soon collected a great Army and
under the Ace, which is the true Protestant Religion one in substance and
essence, He intended to defend the Liberty of the Common cards, the just
Privileges of the Commonwealth, the Laws of the Land and the just government
and good dealing therein, and thus the game of the Commonwealth should be well
and fairly played on all sides, He stakt His Royal word and called God often
to witness How free He was from deceiving His people, and that He would
always govern the Common Cards according to the Laws of this Land, de^^ring
them all to comply with Him and with hearty affection to follow Suite in
maintaining the Liberty of the Subject, and the Protestant Religion which He
promised (as He was ^ing of hearts) ever to maintain and defend. But the
Common Cards namely the City c^ub^^ the Country Spade-men and the rich
Di^mond-men, would believe nothing of the King of hearts good intentions, but
would ^ee^es bring all former quartels to the stake, and in a Batta^le all the
Common cards resolved to play about with the King of Hearts in the open field.

Hereupon the city-clubs ^h^se themselves a King who was indeed a brave noble
Earl whose Title is expressed by two of the last Letters, under him there were
many other petty Kings of clubs, some in gowns like the Mayor of a City
besides a number of others who would needs play Rex in the Kings absence so
the game of war went on and then there was one company of City ^^ub-Aces or
Asles in blew coats, the Duces were the City Captains, the Tray of clubs was a
third Company and they would have laid three to one that they should have done
somewhat, the four of clubs was the Tro^ers and horsemen, who chose to be
horsemen that they might have four legs to run away fast enough the ^^th was
a company of fine young men with ribbonds in their hats which they wore in
re^embrance of their sweetehearts the fixed company of clubs were Red-coats and
Butchers most of them and these would have laid six to one that they would have
be^te the Cavalleirs, the seventh eight and ninth companies, were a mixture of
C^^kolds Pimps punie boys broken citizens and unruly prentises. All these went
under the King of Clubs. The knave of clubs seeing this great preparation,
being a kind of broken merchant having a Roundhead full of ^itty sermons, and
loving to talk treason in Taverns being a fellow that scorned all learning and
Gentilitie, and thought himself a king in the parish where he lived, he gave
en^ouragement to the citie-clubs and told them that the King was led away by
malignants and evil Counselors, and that He was more then half a P^pist,
and he told them they might kill the King and bear arms against the King, and
yet fight for the King and Parliament; and he would never call Him the King of
Hearts: And moreover the knave of clubs assured them that he would trump the
King and win the field from Him, This was no sooner agreed upon by all the
City-Clubs, but the Queen of Clubs being the wives of the inferior sort of
Mechanics, began to talk in a free manner of the King and His proceedings,
and at feasts and gossippings the King of Hearts was still made their subject,
Nay some thought they could not be got with child enlesse their husbands
stood, for the Parliament and did oppose the King of Hearts. And thus the
Queens of Clubs were the precise women of the City, the City Clubs were
the City soldiers who under the command of the General of Clubs would needs
march, out, The Spade-men shussled themselves into their number and being
country fellows of all suites red and blew and tawnie, because they would
have all some Colou^e for their knavery, they have left their Sweet hearts with
child in the Country would needs advance forward Some calves came from Essex,
some Beef and Bacon eaters from Hartfordsheire, and others from other Counties
to defend the Public Faith of the Parish wherein they lived; And were
instructed by sermons how to be Rebels against the King of Hearts: The knave
of Spades was a kind of an ignorant turbulent fellow that sat in all
companies with a bold face and a white staff in his hand, and he went abroad
into ^ll Towns and Villages and sought to sow Treason and Rebellion every
where, and having ^ead the Kings weekly Protestations and Declarations, he
would pick out matter enough to make the King of Hearts no King in an
Alehouse, and then he would whis^er unto them that as they looked to have any
Property in their own goods they should resist the King and His Commission of
Array for else by an Arbitrary government they should have a hundred tricks put
upon them, and the Country should be all but a company of loosing Cards and
fit to be cast out of the Game of the Commonwealth, and none should be
respected but court cards, that is Papists Malignants and Parasites, and
therefore (said he) Let all true contrymen stand for the Liberty of the
Subject the Privileges of Parliament, and the Protestant Religion of our
Town, let us carry Pick-axes and Spades, and dig up the two Universities,
being profane and wicked Gardens, and also with our Spades let us entrench
upon all Authority and Power, and even dig the King up by the Roots, and by
the help of the Parliament so Hedge and Ditch in the Commons, that neither I
yons nor Asses, that is, the great men of the Commonwealth, nor the Droanes of
the Clergy may feed upon us, but that Sp^des joining with the other common
Cards, may undermine the Scepter of the King of Hearts, for we Spade-men are
all kings, by our descent from Adam.

This being whispered into the ears of the Spade-men, they all began to follow
Suit in a mutinous manner, to set forth many thousand Spade-men against the
King of Hearts, having only learnt this Lesson from the Knave of Spades, That
they stood for the King and Parliament; the greater Spades, that is, the
Country Gentry were divided amongst themselves, and men from an hundred to ten
hundred a year, were of several sorts and opinions: some followed the Knave
of Spades, and would oppose the King of Hearts, and all his Proceedings; others
shuffled themselves into the Rings Army of Hearts, and ^^orned to think, that
the Spade-men should domineere over the Ring of Hearts.

The Diamond men were rich in Stones of all sorts, and in wealth and treasure
in City and Country, and therefore they embraced Rebellion thinking that the
Common Cards would defend them. The Queens of Diamons being Goldsmiths wives,
and others that like slow say^ing Pinnaces walked along the street by the
steering of a prentise for a Pilot, these were shrewd cards against the King of
Hearts, yet some were well affected to His Majesty in regard the Courtiers did
often pleasure the Cit e wives with Court-stones which they exchanged for
Diamon Rings.

The knave of Diamonds was sometimes a rich citizen that had broken often,
married and wronged many widows, and run through all the ways of City
po^cie, and he cried out, Silver and gold does all the world command,
Therefore for it and not the King I stand.


This was a kind of witles wealthy knave living and dwelling in all Parishes,
these persuaded the Common Cards to play the fools in parting with p^ate and
money to win the day of the King of Hearts. So now suppose the three Suites
have cut and shuffled and packt the Common Cards into a mut^nous mixture of
Rebellion; whom would they play against? Not the B^^hops they were laid in
prison already for foul play in Religion, the Earie of Strafford had stakt his
head for the King of Hearts and lost it, Sr. John Suckling, Mr. Jermy^ and
other gamesters that had formermerly won much at Dice; yet durst not stand to
the par^ede game of the Common Cards: Now those common cards before men^^oned
would needs Vi and Armis that is with handy strokes against the K ng of
Hearts, His Majesty taking notice hereof and how the common cards had undue^y
assumed unto themselves to direct and order all things and, like players act
their own par^^ (...) ^^oun er^e^ted Crowns as if they were all Kings, the King
of Hearts spoke thus unto His Suite of valliant-hearted soldiers.

The Scepter is and must be mine. Unite your selves to maintain so Honorable
so Just a Ca^se, and what one hand cannot infringe, Let many mainetaine: You
have God for your cause, you have me for his second, and since both are
together who can oppose us?

This being said the Kings men were all Hearts not only in color but in
courage, So the Game of war began in Kenton field where the Cannons played
sorely and many of the Common Cards were lost the Kings Suite put tricks upon
them but yet were some time shrewdly beaten themselves, the chafing Drum and
bragging Trumpet kept away other sounds of dying or flying Cards, in the hea^e
of this b^oody Game where all were players none were spectators or lookers on
Prince Robert began to play foul play and to plunder the Common Cards and
took away their wagons and killed their Waggoners and was not this foul play?
But some Gamesters or soldiers may say that Prince Roberts foul play in
plundering the wagons was a great help to advance the fortune of that day for
otherwise the Common cards had lost more lives if Prince Robert had not
employed some troops to pillage the wagons. Well the Game went forward very
hotly kill kill was the word instead of play follow suite was trun'd to fall on
upon the right wing thus they continued the Game of war, but the left wing of
the Common Cards showed the basest trick that ever was, for they took their
wings and fled quite away like beaten gamesters or else ran to the Kings side
the red Cards on both sides that day performed and played their parts very
courageously, But some of the city clubs ran away for knaves will be knaves
and toward will be cowards upon occasions, but to say truth there was brave
fair Cards on both sides, and such hot play as the like Game was never played
in any other Nation; the French-mans Pell Mell is but to let out his sweating
humors and make him have a stomach to his meat and a wench, but this game of
pe^ mel did let out their dearest blood and this letting of blood made them
have more courage and stomach to fight, so that the Common Cards lay torn and
cast upon the ground, so did the Kings Hearts blows being dealt equally in
this bloody game; at least they having spent their fury a long time on one
another, like strong Gamesters full of money and therefore scorning to yield
they retreated and breathed a while intending to have another bout, and from
the top of Edgehill the king of Hearts viewed the common Cards killing them
with murdering eyes full of fury, when they could not reach them with their
swords, but at the last considering that they as well as the Common Cards had
lost many of their Suites they had no stomachs to play out their loosing hands
any longer, but to save some of their Cards to make bloody sport at some other
time, So they drew stakes for that night the victory being not gotten on either
side, but blows enough dealt about both by the foot play and the horse play,
when the Game was done the King of Hearts side and the Common Cards side began
to count and reckon their lesses, and both found whole Regiments wanting, most
of the Red Cards on both sides were lost; many of the Clubs knoc'l down
trump'd and beaten by the Kings Hearts, the country Spade-men had rather have
been t^^lough or playing at Cards in Alehouse rather then venturing their
lives at this bloody and temble Game; so that many of them were lost Cards
their commanders rub them on with encouraging words, but yet some of them ran
away, and so some of the Diamond men proved themselves counterfeite and when
they saw their own red blood, there was nothing red about them but their
scarlet coats, for their color was as pale as if a dish of milk had been
thrown in their faces, well a great many of the Kings hearts were lost also,
but they played their Game without fear and put the noblest best cards
forwards. But at last when both sides had counted their Cards some say the
common cards lost most, and others that were Gamesters at Kenton field affirm
that the King lost more of His Hearts then they did of Common Cards, But
indeed it is to be thought that they lost Cards and Cards and though their
losses were equal or very near alike. To conclude lets al pray that the like
Came may never be played between the Common Cards and the King of He arts, but
that all may follow Suite and love Him with their Hearts, You Common Cards how
durst you play your parts?
In open field against the King of Hearts.
We know you win in every Country Town
Both Pence and Pots of Ale, but against a Crown?
To stake your Coxcombs, may such Cards, I pray,
Be burn, that against the King of Hearts will play:
For know your Loss is certain, and you win
Naught but Dishonor, that resist the King.


This Game has bin played over and over, and although the Clubs make a great
d^ring, and think themselves the only Gamesters, they have of late bin
shrowdly Trumped, witness the last Game which was played at Ciren^ester in
Glouc^^^ershire, wherein the Suit of Hearts did play their Game so bravely, and
so much whi^k^ the other Pack, that there is scarce left a Stock to Deal
another Game by; the Diamonds made the Spades their Sextons, and happy was he
could get the honor of a private Grave. The Clubs, that played so well at
Bradford in Yorkshire, have by Trumping others bin so extremely Trumpt
themselves, that they desire no longer to be in the number of the Pack.

It is now thought high time to leave off Playing, for by many after-Games the
Pack is grown so poor, that they are unable to Show themselves; and although
they believe, in their Losses, that it is but Gamesters hard fortune, yet let
them look to it, Fair Playing always carries away the Bell. The King of
Hearts, as his Suit is best in Color and in Courage, so they are such
understanding Gamesters, that they will not be taken in any oversight; there
are no Bunglers there, nor any fumbling in all their Play, but all expert and
cunning Gamesters: it is therefore no wonder if Success does attend them, and
that they still come Winners off in all the Games they Play. The rest of the
Pack have therefore done very well and wisely, to crave a Truce of the King of
Hearts, who is more willing to forgive them, then they have bin apt to oppose
him.

Since they on both sides have him cross't,
And both have won, and both have lost,
It now is thought high time of Day
Friendly to part, and leave of Play.
FINIS.
