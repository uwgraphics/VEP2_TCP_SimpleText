DAVID'S PSALMS IN METER. Agreeable to the Hebrew, To be sung in usual TVNES.
To the benefit of the Churches of Christ.

By the Reverend Mr. John White Minister of Gods Word in DORCHESTER.

I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also,

1 Cor. 14, 15. LONDON, Printed by S. Griffin for J. Rothwel, at the Fountain
and Bear in Goldsmiths row in Cheapside. 1655.

A PREFACE CONCERNING THIS METRICALL VERSION.
THE Holy Scriptures one calls the Magna Charta of a Christian: the Psalms, an
Epitome of the Holy Scriptures. (Rivet. Praefat. in Psalm.)

The singing of Psalms was under the Law, is under the Gospel an Holy Ordinance
of God, in right performanee whereof, Churches and Christians make heavenly
melody in their hearts unto the Lord. Ephesians. 5.19.

What has been objected to breed a discord, Mr. Jo: Cotton singing of Psalms,
a Gospel Ordinance.

Mr. Tho: Ford singing of Psalms, the duty of Christians under the New
Testament, in sundry Sermons on Ephesians: 5.19

Mr. Tho: Manton, Pract: Comment, on James 5.13.


and what has been answered to maintain this holy Harmony, may be read by such
as consult (amongst others) the Reverend Authors quoted here.

The Metrical Version of these Psalms now tendered, needs no other praise, then
to know the Author and the hand that made it: In honor of whom being
requested to say something, I hold my self obliged to give testimony to three
things concerning my famous Predecessor, and this his work.

I. That deservedly great is the name, and good the memory of Mr. John White
late of Dorchester, especially in these Western parts, where he was a burning
and a shining light many years: and though he be dead, yet by his works that
follow him he still speaks.

II. That this Version perfected by his own hand, and much desired by many, had
in his life time been Printed, were it not that some others were at that time
under Consultation, and struggling which of them should get the Civil sanction;
that contest now over, his Son (with whom he left the Copy) was prevailed with
to publish this which was his fathers: and now let it go forth and prosper.

III. That though many have done worthily in their essaies to render a better
Meeter then the old English Translation (from which some wedded to custom will
not vary) yet many more together with my self do think this Reverend Author,
if he have not surpassed them all, (comparisons are odious) yet at least may
challenge a place, not amongst David's thirty, but amongst his first three.

He that desires,

1. To sing David's own Psalms as near as may be in Meeter, in David's own words,
without Paraphrase, (which is so much desired in others) shall find this
Version Keep close to Tremellius in Latin, and the new Translation in English,
or (where it leaves them) to some elegancy of the Hebrew (wherewith the Learned
Author was well acquainted, if he do compare them.

2. Thus to sing them in good Meeter, and easy Tunes, shall find Vulgar
quantities, and smooth Verse, without harsh Synalaephas, as in some other
Versions.

3. No new Versions, For he says the old is better, has not well drank of
either; for the old prose needed not more new Translation, then in many places
does the old Meeter: yet where they have done it well, the Author testifies
his Reverend esteem of those Translators, by retaining lines, and sometimes
whole Verses of that Translation.

To conclude, if this present Version find that acceptance which a former book
of his has done, (called the way to the Tree of Life, discovered in sundry
directions for the profitable reading of the Scriptures; wherein the Morality
and perpetuity of the fourth Commandment in every circumstance thereof is
discovered and cleared, and the nature of a spiritual man described) it will
encourage the publication of some other excellent labors of his that are to
follow; which that it may, and especially that the singers of these Psalms may
observe the rules set down by the Authors aforesaid, is the prayer of his
unworthy successor,

Stanley Gower.

The Second part:

Among the people his great acts
and works declare and tell:

Forgetting not the cries of men
distressed when they pray.

Who even from the gates of death
did lift me up again.
That in the gates of Zion I
may show forth all thy praise,
In thy salvation shall my soul,
O Lord, rejoice always.

Their foot is taken in the net
which their own hands have laid;

which he has strangely wrought,
When sinners hands do make the snares
wherein themselves are caught.

And so shall all the Nations
that God remember not.

And the expectations of the poor,
deferred, yet perish not.

And that they are but poor weak men

Nor yet in any time to come
adversity shall see.

And mischief, and iniquity
under his tongue he lays.

he lurks, and secretly
The harmless slayes, against the poor

And when he has him in his net,
the weak his prey does make;

he bows himself withal,
That such as are but poor and weak
by his strong ones may fall.

He turns away and hides his face,
and will not see at all,

Neglect not Lord too long to save
the humble soul from harm.

Presumptuously within their heart,
God will it not repay:

observe mischief and spite,
And it in thy due time thou will
with thine own hand requite.
The poor, that has none help besides,
on thee relyes alone,
Thou do support the fatherless,
to thee that make their moan.

and all their power confound,
And search out all their wickedness
till it no more be found.

and by his mighty hand
The heathen folk are perished,

Upon the string, to shoot at those

Then Jacob greatly shall rejoice,
and Israel glad shall be.

And to make haste to other Gods

And of my cap, thou do my lot

The heritage assigned to me

Because he is at my right hand,

Fullness of joy, at thy right hand

And hear my prayer which comes forth

And thou have me as metals tried,

Unto my God, my voice he heard

My cry came up before his face,
entering into his ear,
Immediately the earth did shake

And sorely shook, because his wrath

And on the wings of whirling winds

Waters obscure and dark, enclosed
in thick clouds of the air,

and so before him went,
His thick clouds past away, hailstones
and coals of fire were sent.

the Highest gave his voice,
Hailstones and burning coals of fire
he threw with fearful noise.

and his foes scattered,
His lightnings he sent forth in wrath,
and them discomfited.

And at thy blasting breath, the worlds

And out of many waters deep
