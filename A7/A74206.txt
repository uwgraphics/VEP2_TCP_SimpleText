ENGLANDS Congratulatorie Entertainment, OF HIS MAJESTY Out of Sccotland, and
his welcome to LONDON.
To welcome home our good and gracious King,
England this Canto joyfully maysing.
WElcome sweet Charles most mighty Sovereign,
True Faiths Defender, truth you still maintain;
Long may Christ's Gospel flourish, and the law,
To make proud Antichrist to stand in awe:
Welcome, yea welcome, thrice welcome unto us,
By you in Christ we shall be prosperous,
Unwilling we were for to let you go
From us sweet David, God would have it so;
We are contented, it was for our good,
To stint the shedding of great Britains blood:
Welcome to London, welcome to us all,
You come with joy to make great Babell fall,
Whereas proud Rome did seek to domineer,
You come in Christ to give her whipping cheer;
She thought to bring us all to her subjection,
But you in Christ have given her rejection;
She thought to spread amongst us great contention
By civil discord sowing great dissension,
But that our God did check her for her pride,
Has spared us and makes her ill betide,
Whereas she thought all Protestants to quell,
It Is found in mischief she does most excel;
She plots, she projects after such strange fashion,
She seeks to conquer every land and nation:
But God that sees her pride will make her bow,
That her foul baseness every Saint shall know;
And since she could not work her malice here,
In Ireland she would make her spite appear;
But God that Britain does defend and keep,
For Ireland watchful is, he will nor sleep,
He stands for those that for his truth contend,
And he for ever will their cause defend:
Then courage take, brave Monarch, you shall have
Our hearts, our hands, our purses, what you will crave,
So long as you Gods Battles take in hand,
We all will fight under your sweet command;
Your Princly Son Prince Charles great Britains heir,
In prowess, courage, he is without compare,
To fight Christ Battles he is your chief Viceroy,
True Christians comfort, and great Britains joy:
Go on my Liege, God give you good success,
You have done well in Christ God will you bless,
So long as you his faith and truth defend,
God will you bless until the world shall end:
Long may you prosper, and your royal blood,
In Church and Commonwealth for Britains good,
And for the welfare of true Christian hearts,
Since God by you to them his love imparts;
Stand for the truth, proceed in Christ his name,
You prosper shall with everlasting fame;
Ireland calls for you, craves your helping aid,
You must help them, they must not be denai'd:
The helbred Papists mighty mischief work,
Thei'r worse by far then is the heathen Turk;
Their spirit foul Christ Jesus he will quell,
Stand you for Christ your prowess shall excel:
The Pope shall have but little biding there,
If you there make Christ's Banners to appear:
If you Christ's Standard bear on Irish ground,
All Popish Prelates you will quite confound,
All Popish Brats will then go hide their head,
The truth of Christ will strike them all for dead;
Yea your sweet Gemme shall pass the River Rhine,
By his sweet aid the Romans shall decline,
Their end is near, their downfall is at hand,
By Christ under Prince Charles his sweet command,
By Cherlamaines the Father and the Son,
In God through Christ the Romans are undonne.
Rejoice sweet Lady Elizabeth, rejoice,
King Charles in Christ has made the chiefest choice,
He fights for you and for your royal blood,
He is ordained in God to do you good;
Though he long time has been withheld by Rome,
He comes at length to give her final doom,
Rejoice true Protestants rejoice ye all,
Christ Jesus gives great Babell now the fall,
The fall of Antichrist does now draw near,
Supposed to be within this eighteen year;
He is condemned he has had his trial,
His downfall now appears without denial:
Then welcome home sweet Charles to London town,
You come with joy to pull great Babell down,
You and your blood the Crown shall ever wear,
So long as you for Christ the Scepter bear:
Then courage take, you shall in Christ excel,
You shall the Roman Eagles forces quell;
Which that you may let all good Christians then,
To my well wishes ever say, Amen.
JOHN CRAGGE for England and true Britains weal, Has pend this Canto, would
not it conceal.
