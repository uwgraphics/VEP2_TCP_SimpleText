Exon. April 8. 1643.
HAving lately seen a Pamphlet, mis-called a Sermon, and fathered upon my
name, under this Title, [A Sermon preached in Exon, before the Deputy
Livetenants, Captains, etc. in the County of Devon, by John Bond, Minister of
the word of God in the City of Exon] The text being, Prove. 25. v. 5. and
perusing those broken notes upon it, contained in some 35 pages. I thought it
my duty (so soon as I could recover my self from astonishment at the
injurious boldness of the publisher, T. B.) to tell the world, that not only
my self, but, which is far more near me, the very Cause, Text, and Reader,
are abused in that bastard-copy. I may not, for the matters sake, be forced to
hatch a Cuckco's eggs, or to father another bratt, especially when it is a
monster.

And therefore mine entreaty to the Reader of these lines is this, that for his
own sake as well as mine, he would save the labor of reading those shreds, or
at least the charges of buying them; and if he will needs see something of mine
upon that Text, let him but hold-in his purse, and lay-out a little patience in
staying a few weeks (perhaps days) until I can finish my beginnings upon
that Scripture, and then he may have the Commodity at first hand, perhaps
cheaper and sweeter then it can come from such regrating, and soyling
Hucksters. Mean while, pray for him that is,

The Causes Jo. Bond.
