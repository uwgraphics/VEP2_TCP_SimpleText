Mr. Vicars Letter to Dr. Bastwicke, concerning Leiutenant Colonel Lilburne.
MVch honored Doctor, and my most worthy friend, being abroad this Saturday, I
heard that Mr. John Lilburne, has again printed another lavish Letter, which I
have not yet seen or read, wherein, together with others, he has sorely, and I
am persuaded most unjustly taxed you, to have done him a great deal of wrong,
in his late miscarried business about the Parliament, whereas I have ever
observed that you have always, since you were first acquainted with him,
shown your self his singular good friend, ready to do him all good in word
and deed, yea and in these later times of his uncomely miscarriages have spoken
very tenderly and friendly of him; and therefore I cannot (I say) be persawded
that you have given him any just cause so to complain or exclaim of you, I
therefore humbly desire you (most honored Sir) to vouchsafe to satisfy and
certify me in a word or two, whither any such thing be between you or not at
this time, though I say for mine own part I am confident of the contrary, but,
then I shall be the more groundedly able upon occasion to vindicate your
integrity and innocence therein, and the more fully to stop the mouths of any
other traducers of you herein: Thus, most noble Sir, whom from my Soul, for
your faithfulness to God and his Truth, I can never sufficiently prize and
honor, praying pardon for this my boldness, emboldned thereunto by your own
Christian Candor and even genuine ingenuity, with the humble tender of my best
services to your most worthy self and virtuous Consort, I ever rest, Yours in
his best poor Services, in the Lord to be commanded,

Aug. this 9th 1645. John Vicars.

A Just defense, of John Bastwicke, Doctor In Physieke, Against the Calumnies
of John Lilburne, Leiutenant Colonel, and his false Accusations.
Mr. VICARS;
AS I have ever found you a truly loving friend to me and mine heather to, and
that in my greatest adversity and hottest conflicts, which with all
thankfulness I do acknowledge, and have with reciprocal affection answered
your love: So I hope there shall never on my part, any just occasion be given
of violating this our mutual affection: for to the uttermost of my abilities,
I shall endeavor to keep peace with all men especially my Christian
acquaintance. And so confident I am of your good opinion, that there is not any
calumny how high so ever it fly, and how loud soever it speak, and by what
multitudes soever it be spread obroad and divulged, that can in the least
alienate your charity from me before you have heard my just defense. And truly
at this time though I should not return an answer to your Letter in way of
justification of my own integrity, so assured I am of your Love, that al^
those foul aspersions that are now causlesly published concerning me, by
reason of a Letter printed by Leiu. Col. Lilburne should not in the least
stagger your good esteem of me or estrange you from me: much less would they
extort a censure from you before you had heard what I had to reply in my own
behalf. But seeing you have desired for the satisfaction of others to hear
from me concerning the business between me and the Leiut. Colonel, I thought
fit to gratify you in a few lines, not that I am sollicitous about that
matter, or that it does in the least trouble my mind, or disquiet my thoughts:
for such is my innocence in this cause, that besides the testimony of my own
Conscience, I have the witness of the whole Parliament, the great Council of
the Kingdom to acquit and free me from the Colonells crimination: so that all
men may see that it was maliciously laid upon me, only to make me hateful to
all good people. You know that Calumny (who is quicker then Martial Law) does
ordinarily arraigne, accuse and condemn men before they have been heard
speak for themselves, and men are usually put to death and murdered in their
reputation, and their fame taken from them before they know of it: and thus at
this time it has happened to me, who am made as odious and infamous as the
tongues of Revilers can make me, and that upon no just grounds; as you shall
see by and by. It is a sin that many in this Nation are highly gui^ty of, who
deal not with others as they would be dealt with, and easily receive a
reproach against their Neighbor, both which notwithstanding are against the
Royal Law of love. Neither is there any man that would not complain if one
should either spread an evil report of him, or embrace one against him; yet
that they condemn in others is the practice of too too many in these our
days: and they that sit at the Stern of Government cannon keep themselves
from the Obliques of such as owe their lives unto them for their care and
watchfulnes for their good, and therefore we that are of the low degree may not
think our condition miserable, when we see our Rulers and the chief
Magistrates of the Kingdom, and that not only in tongue and word, but in
every scurrilous Pamphlet, hour^^^ traduced: But now to the matter in hand. You
tell me, you heard That Master John Lilburne has again printed another
Letter, where in together with others, (...) has sorely taxed me, to have done
him agreat deal of wrong, etc. What he has published concerning others, I
leave them to an^wer to that, but what he has printed concerning my self, it
is most false, and no way beseeming him a brother, so to deal with one, that
had loved and honored him, more than he did himself, and so far, I have
ever been from wronging him in the least measure as all that know me, or ever
heard me speak of him, when he was accused of pride, rashness, malversation
factiousnesse of spirit, etc. I say, when I have heard many bla^^ him, as well
friends as en^mies, they can all witness for me, he had ever my good word,
either wholly to excuse him, and vindicate his reputation, or at least to
extenuate his offense: so that I am not in the lest thing guilty of
disaffection to him, much less of that, he lays to my chrge, yea, had it
been true, that he charge me with, yet it had been no more a crime in me,
then it was in himself, when he not only communicated a business concerning
Col, Hollis to Mr. Samuel Goose, but afterward made it known to some Members
of the House; which says he, we did without any design in the world saving
the discharge of our duty. Thus he speaks in his Letter concerning himself
and Master Goose: Now if they thought it a discharge of their duty, to inform
the House of such things as concerned the State, because Robinson said he would
justify it to the death, why should any think it a crime in me, to inform
the Par^iament of those things that others affirmed* with as great a
probability of verity as Robinson did? Especfally when it concerned the whole
Kingdom? Yea in the 8th page of his Letter he speaks of three Citizens,
that were come down from London to Westminster, namely Master Prity a Draper
and one of his neighbors in Dowgate* and one Master Worly that lives about
Morefields, and all these (says he) were come down to Westminster, and did
give information to 4. Members of the House of Commons, namely to Colonel
R^gby, Sir Walter Earl, Col. Long, and Masterr Corbet, concerning Sir John
Lenthall and the Speaker, as they had heard it from others, and the which was
known (as he affirms) to thousands of Citizens by the hearing of the ear:
and all this the Colonel in his Letter, says, those men were informing the
House of; when he came to Westmin. And in all there so doing I do conceive he
thinks they did but their duty. Why therefore should the very same men, think
it so heinous a crime and offense now in me, if I made the same information it
to the whole House, which they had done to some particular Members of was it a
virtue in them, and a thing praise worthy, and it is a crime and P^aculum in
me? But it was against a friend and a brother to whom, I was exceedingly
beholding. First therefore I shall desire you to take his own expression
concerning the business, and after my reply. His words are these.

It seems Doctor Bastwicke (a man that stands obliged to me, with as many ties
of friendship and respect, as I am confident he does to any man in the world,
for whom I have often both in England and Holland adventured my life, and all
that was mine, and for whose sake and cause, as an earthly instrument I
underwent all the sorrows and miseries, that I suffered from the Bishops for
diverse years together) s^nt in a paper to the Speaker to inform him, that I
had accused him for sending threescore thousand pounds to Oxford (though with
the said Doctor Bastwicke to my remembrance, I had not any discourse at all
about any such business: for the discourse I had about that business was with
Leiutenant Colonel Roes, the Scout-Master General, whom I brought up out of
the Guarden to the aforesaid three Citizens, that had newly given in their
information under their own hands. Master Worley, one of the three, being
Leiutenant Col. Roes old acquaintance, told him more (I am confident of it) by
many degrees, then before he had from me. Yet (as I am informed) upon Doctor
Bastwickes paper^ barely, the Speaker g^t a Vote (before ever I knew any thing,
though I all day waited upon the Parliament) to pass the House in these words.

Resolved upon the Question by the Commons assembled in Parliament, that
Leiutenant Colonel Lilburne, ^ee forthwith taken into custody by the Sergeant
as Arms attending the House, and so kept till the House give further Order.

This is his own expression; by the which it is manifest, that the information
was made to four members of the House of Commons, before my Paper was sent in
to Master Speaker, which was about three a clock in the afternoon: So that I
did nothing, but what had been acted by the three Citizens before. Now if they
were not base and paultry fe^lowes and Knaves for doing this, then there is no
just ground, nor cause why either Leiutenant Colonel Lilburne, and Mr. Worley
and there companions should asperse me with those odious terms, and many
more, calling me an Apostate, as they have been often heard speak, and for
no other cause but for informing the House of that which they themselves had
done before me, yet all these calumnies I now under go from these men and of
all their fraternity, and for no other offense but for that they applaud in
themselves for a virtue. But now for answer to that which Leiutenant Colonel
Lilburne charge me with, and for a replication to your request, know this
Master Vicars, that it is most false, and that I may express my self in the
words of a Parliament man (when he had read the printed Letter) it is a most
impetuous lie, for so said a Member of the House to me, that Lilburne had
printed a most impetuous lie against me, whiles he upbraided me, and my ever
to be honored brother Master William Prynne of lying, and to speak the
verity, I do not think there was a more gross and wilfuller untruth ever
printed against any man: for I understanding that Leiutenant Colonel Lilburn
had given out that I had informed against him, I sent him word by one Mistress
Barber, which told me that she was very sorry to hear that I should do such a
thing against a brother and a loving friend and fellow sufferer, to whom I
merely replied, that it was a groundless report, and that I never did it, and
with all told her, that it was one Hawkins, and desired her to signify it to
my Brother Lilburne, that he might be undeceived, and fearing that she should
not relate it unto him, (though she was then going to him) and promised me that
she would) the next day finding him waiting on the Committee, I blamed him that
he should report such things of me, and told him that he had exceedingly
wronged me in so doing, in raising such a report and withal signified unto him
that it was his friend Hawkins that had accused him: Notwithstanding all this,
such is his inveterat malice toward me, because I writ against the
Independents, that he printed that falsehood against me, only as I suppose to
bring an Odi^^s upon me through the Kingdom (for his Letter is now as public
as weekly news, and in every bodies hands) and I am induced to believe that
this was the design both of himself and those that are of his society,
because it has ever been their ordinary practice, to abuse such in tongue and
print withal manner of callumnies and blasting language as they think
Malignant and Leiutenant Col. Lilburne by name, is notorious, and famous for
this faculty of reviling, as this his printed letter does specify and his many
other Pamphlets, and that which not long since he printed against Col. King a
Lincolnshire Gentleman who had deserved as well from the Parliament and his
Country (if famelye not) as most of those that have bin in public service for
the State* and who exposed himself to as many dangers, and did as faithfully
discharge his place and the trust committed to him as any man: yet this man,
because he opposed the Independent party, and would not whiles he was in Come
mand, suffer them in a disorderly manner to leave the public Assemblies where
the word was faithfully and Orthodoxly preached and vent their own novelties,
to the seducing and misleading of the poor people and making a faction in
Church and State: For no other ground (I say) that ever I heard of, saving that
he being a man not only of integrity, but wisdom also and courage, and could
not endure to see his Countrymen made a pray of to pur^oyners, and such as
aimed more at their own honor and private emolument then at the public good
and dignity of the Parliament; for these very causes and no other, that ever I
could learn what I say with that party hating him, and the Independents
joining with them, by their false informations and clamorus against him and
their malicious suggestions, as that he was of a troublesome and contentious
spirit, they have made him as odious as any man in the Kingdom, excepting my
self and my learned and honored Brother Mr. William Prynne. And Lieutenant
Colonel Lilburne not satisfied to rail of this gallant Gentleman wheresoever
he came, but printed a most notorious lying Libell against him, and such an
one, as all the truly Godly and honest men of that County do affirm, they
never saw more prodigious untruthes published against any man: and such of his
Country men as are acquainted with him and his abilities know very well, that
if he had but fair play, he is able for wit and worth to deal with a whole
Army of Indepents, and all his enemies, and for valor and skill in Arms he is
inseriour to none of them, and whiles he was in their good esteem, and before
he opposed their faction, they neither thought nor spoke otherwise of him, but
as of a brave and diserving Gentleman as can be proved by a cloud of witnesses
and under the hands of the best of them: but now, because he is adverse to
theer way, as with all good reason, he and all good men, such as love the
peace of Sion, and the welfare of the Kingdom, ought to be, to their whimsy
of Independency, therefore that party and their abbettors do most horridly
abuse him with all manner of reproaches, and my Brother Lilburne by name, (as I
said before) has published such beastly lies of him, as scarce the Sun ever
saw greater, and in the same tracke and path do all the Independent faction
walk in, blasting all those they hate with vilifying language, and for this
very end and for no other purpose, I persuaded my self he published that lie
against me, that he might make me despicable, and of no reputation amongst
honest men: for in his accusation, he charge me with two crimes, Lying and
Ingratitude, either of which were enough to make me infamous through the
World, much more they being both joined together, and that with aggravation for
there is nothing that all ingenious men hate, and abhor more then alyat, and
an ungrateful fellow, and that deservedly neither can any honest man keep
such men company with safety, as are guilty of those crimes. And truly, if I
were such a man, the world might justly distaste and abjure me. Now to prove
me a liar, he thus argues. The Doctor (says he) sent in a paper to inform
the Speaker, that I had accused him for sending threescore thousand pound to
Oxford, though with the said Doctor Bastiwck I had no discourse at all about
any such business. And therefore he is a notorious ly^t, to affirm that I
accused Master Speaker, when I had no discourse with him about any such
business. And to prove me an ungrateful fellow, and one that had done him
evil for good, which is yet a degree of Sin above ungratitude: He thus
dispureth. Doctor Bostwicke, a man that stands obliged unto me, with as many
ties of friendship and respect, as J am confident he does to any m^n in the
world, for whom I have both in England and Holland, adventured my self and all
that was (...), and for whose sake and cause, as an earthly instrument I under
went all the sorrows and miseries that I suffered from the Bishops for diverse
years together. And for this man to make an information against me and thus to
reward me, rendering me evil for Good, he proclaims himself to the whole
world to be an unworthy and ungrateful man, and therefore ought deservedly to
be abhorred and abominated of all good people, as a liar and an unthankful
fellow, and this is the scope of this gallant sword-mans disputation, to wound
and distroy his Brothers reputation, and this effect it has already produced,
that amongst all those of that fraternity (for they take all pro confess that
he either speaks or Printeth) they talk no otherwise of me then of a base
fellow, calling me knave and paultry fellow at every word, and this dialect
they have learned of Lieutenant Colonel John Lilburne, who when he speaks
of me, gives me no other name, although it is well known until I had
declared my self against Independency, there were no praises though great
enough both for me and my Brother Prynne, such is the sicklenesse and vanity of
the poor creature, one day crying Hosanna, and another day crucify him, if in
the least ye displease his humor, and so he deals with the Parliament, who,
but the Parliament not long since with John Lilburne? and now they are a
company of Tyrants? and the supreme Court of Judicature is with him as bad as
the High Commission, and the Star Chamber, and worse and all the Judges in the
great Council, as bad as Strafford and the Prelates, trampling down Magna
Charta, and the liberty of the Subjects under there feet, so that if their
dealings toward the Subjects be just, he professes he has lost his judgment,
and must begin to learn A. B. C. again, etc. But to wave his dispising of
Government, and railing of dignities, a Sin which God so much abhorrs, 2 Pet.
2. Jude and which belongs to those in authority to redress, and whom it most
concerns. I come to his particular charge against me, and first, where he
accuses me that I put up a paper against him to the Speaker, he begins his
crimination with calling, for I never put up a paper against him, neither did I
ever in my life inform against him unto any Parliament man, or ever open my
mouth to any of the House in his least prejudice to this present day, but have
ever spoken well of him to the Parliament, and for this I now say, all the
Parliament can witness for me: and so far I was from making an Information
against him about this business, that I knew not at that time, that he had
ever heard that Mr. Speaker was accused of any such thing, nor had not known
it, had not he himself in his letter signified so much that Pendrid had told
him such a thing, and therefore I could not inform against him, and in the
first paper that I and Colonel King put into the House, we were so careful
of preserving others reputations, that we named none in it but Haukings. But
after we had sent in the first paper, and understanding from others, that
Hawkins varied in his relation, and whereas to us he had only by name accused
Master Speaker, and Sir Robert Harlow, saying that many more were equally
guilty, and hearing that, to others he in his relaton said there were ten more
specifying a certain number upon this new intelligence, we conceiving that if
he would communicate these things to us which were strangers unto him, he
would much more impart his mind to his familiers and those of his own faction,
and seeing him in the company of many of that way from whose sosiety he then
immediately came and related those things to us, we verily persuaded our selves
that he had told them also the same things, and thinking with our selves if
Hawkins should deny his words as probably he might, that then we might the
better corroberat and strengthen our witness with their testimonies, which
would also have added great force and life to our information as being men of
reputation and of good esteem and credit in the Parliament, and against whom
there could be no just exception or suspicion of hatred to that party, they
being Independents and no Presbiterians, I say for the strengthening of our
witness, in the next paper we sent in to the House, we put in the names of
some of those that were in Hawkins company, as Colonel Iret^^, and Lieutenant
Colo^^ll Lilburn, for such was the honor we then bare to them, as we had
thought to have had their testimony and witness, joined with ours, (in case
that Hawkins should have jugled with us, or denied any thing he spoke to us)
and truly Colonel Iret^n might as well have picked a quarrel with none at
Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne, if he had been of a malicious and contentio^s
spirit: for all that we intended by naming of them in the paper presented to
the House, was for no other end, but to produce their testimonies with ours, if
(as I said before) Hawkins should have denied his words. And whether the naming
of these men were any wrong to them, or any just cause of a quarrel from
Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne, I refer it to the judgment of any Sober and
discreet man! But for the saitisfaction of your self Master Vicars and all
good men, teke the information as it was put up in its formal words, which I
am not now afraid to publish because the business is now in print by John
Lilburne, Lieutenant Colonel, and is now publicly known: and because also
the innocence of the parties accused, is now vindicated and commonly taken
notice of, there being nothing made good against them, so much as with any
seeming probability, much less proved it being well known also, that there
was not any one of reputation that were either the accusers or prosecutors of
the business. But the last information that was put up into the House of
Commons was this; Colonel Ireton, Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne, Havvkins, and
others, having been serious in discourse in the Court of Requests; Havvkins
coming immediately from that company said there were strange things discovered
against many Members in the House of Commons, and went as high as the Speaker,
against whom it would be proved, that he had with his own hand sent
threescore thousand pounds to the King to Oxford, and that many Members had
made their Peace, and done strange things, amongst whom Sir Robert Harlovv was
one, and that if God had not blessed our Army to be in a good condition, the very
discovery of these things, would have been enough to have undone us all. These
words were spoken by Hawkins before us, and we are ready to witness the same.

Edward King. John Bastwicke.




These Mr. Vicars, are the very words we put up to the House, now I appeal
unto the judgment of all juditious and moderate Christians, whether there be
any one word of accusation either made by me or Colonel King, against
Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne, so that it may now appear unto all men, that it
was a most malicious lie, fained against me by my good Brother Lilburne, and
published only to defame me: and which is more to be taken notice of, that
howsoever there were many more besides my self tha^ put up informations to
this purpose against Hawkins, and in this very paper Colonel King by name
joined with me, and that in the first place, yet he baukes them all and
singles me out to make the Theme of his scurrillity, and expose me to the
hatred of all good men. So that now M. Vicars I am confident that you and all
who shall see this are satisfied by my just defense for this first point, and so
you will all free me from his accusation, and account him for his pains a
mere calumniating liar, as he most justly deserves.

And now I will answer to his other crime of ingratitude. But that you Master
Vicars, and all to whom you shall communicate it, may the better see into the
temper of this man, and all that are of his faction, I shall now communicate
unto you, first the original and beginning of my acquaintance with Mr. John
Lilburne and of the mutual affection and reciprocal. Offices that passed
between us until he fell into the boisterous way of separation and did
prosecute it with, such violence: and then I will relate unto you his carriage
of late toward me, besides his aspertions, in his Letter of lying and
ungratitude, and with all tell you some words and passages also of those of his
faction, and how causlesly they have abused me in word and deed.

When I was a prisoner in the Gate House, I lay there a whole year, and a
half to my best remembrance, before I saw any Citizen in London, saving my
own kindred, and such people as in whose Houses I had Lodged, when I was
forced by the tyrany of the times and my malicious enemies, to wait upon the
Courts of Judicature all the term time, for there was scarce a Court in the
Kingdom where, Tom Newcomin, Danet, and Richard Daniell, those impious and
treacherous fellows out of the rancor and hatred had not put me,
notwithstandiug I had bin a means to preserve the said Daniel, the Brother of
Thomas Newc^min from the jaws of famine, as all the people of Col^chester can
witness, yet all they conspiring against me out of malice, hoysted me up into
the Court of Chancery, Kings Bench, High Commission, etc. so that I was
constrained to dance attendance all the Term long upon one Court or other for
many years together, until I was by their prosecution cast into Prison, so
that of necessity I was forced into some acquaintance, at for my friends
generally, they were like the Rivers of Arabia, when I was in the greatest
heat of affliction, and had most need of them to refresh me, they were all
dried up, and as Jobs and David's friends, either out of base fear of the
Beast, they stood a far of, and so declined me, or else proved miserable
comforters and added affliction to my bonds, so that I found that of Solomon
true, confidence in an unfaithful friend, is like unto a broken tooth or a
foot out of joint, for as a broken tooth and a foot out of joint, not only
fails men when they have the greatest need of them, for their sustinance and
supportation, but pain, hurt and anoy them, and many times exceedingly torment
them, even so it happened to me, they seldom came to me, except it were to
rate me, and revile me, and join with my enemies, yet though they failed
me, I had got some acquaintance by these my sufferings, who now and then came
to visit me, and were kind unto me, and these excepted, no Citizens did ever
accost me, or come nigh me in all London for eighteen Months. And that which
also made me not regarded, nor looked after, some black mouthed Physicians that
made Religion their stalking Horse to get into practice, one of the which also,
stood really obliged unto me, in as many Obligations of respect and frindship,
as Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne falsely affirms, I stand bound to him, and yet
this man also forgetting al courtifies and humanity, for no other reason, but
because I could not applaud all his distempers joined with the other men
unknown to me by any familiarity, and with whom to this present day I yet
never Changed a word, and they all as it were in a confedracy combined together
to defame me, and spoke all manner of evil of me (and continue the same
trade to this day) so that in the judgment of all the Citizens that heard of
me and through their calumnies, I was thought worthy of no pity, and esteemed
of a^ man no way to be regarded: yea I was condemned by the most of them that
heard of me, as an evil doer, and my punishment thought to little for me,
and they spoke generally of me as of a debaushed fellow and a madman: and all
those aspertions were laid upon me partly out of malice, and partly for fear,
least any should make use of me for their Physician, for they were sure they
should ever find me at home, when others perhaps would be in the Country when
they had greatest need of them, and therefore for fear (as I say) least I should
hinder Gri^^s from coming to their Mi^l, and out of envy they often traduced
me, and vilified me every where an ordinary practice especially of the
independent Physicians, and all that I now say Master Vicars, I think you in
part can witness: so that I remained a Prisoner of hope, destitute of friends
and in a despicable condition, and knew not the face of any Citizen but my
kindred, and some few that I formerly made mention of, until one Mr. Wharton
an old Disciple, an honest and a godly man, was sent unto me by a Doctor of
Divinity, as prelaticall a man as he told me, as any in England, which made
the good-old man to wonder, yet he being a learned man took pity of me, and
sent me twenty shillings in Gould, which was the first present I ever received
from any man of that function, forbidding him to tell me his name (which he
concealed faithfully) with this Message also, that if I were in any necessity,
I should make Mr. Wharton acquainted with it, and then I should hear from him,
and he likewise charged him to take a care of me, ^elling him that he never
read any Puritans writings from which he had better satisfaction, and gave me
hyperbolicall praises as he related unto me; whereupon the old man began to
ask me, how I subsisted there, and I told him in particular, all my means
that was left to support me to a Penny (and I bless God I sp^ake it to his
Praise) I was as well contented with water-gruell in P^^^lon as ever I was with
greatest plenty at liberty, God blessing it to me and mine, it sustained us
and if my poor Wife could purchase one roast joint of meat in the Week, we
thought our selves happy, and our little Children would skippe as much to see a
piece of roast meat on the suit, as others would do at any thing of greatest
delight or wonder, and would cry out one to another rost-meat, roast-meat, that
it would draw tears many times from my Wifes eyes to hear them (and that that
I now speak the Lord in Heaven knows it is true) and all this while blessed
be God, we had our health; and looked well, And in this low and contented
conditi^n we could have continued without starving, though we had never had
aid from any mortal man, but I had a very loving Kinsman (whom you know well
Mr. Vicars) Mr. S^rang by name, who suspecting the worst showed me may
kindnesses and his Children likewise, and he lent me money upon any occasion,
and that was no small comfort unto us, but otherwise I was friendlesse and
helpless, until old Mr. Wharton by that Docters means came to me who much
encouraged me, and entreated me I would write something in English, for the
people (says he) understands not Latin, and therefore can reap no benefit
by your labors, neither will you ever be known unto them and so he extremely
urged me that I would write something in English, whereupon I demanded of him
what theme he would put me upon, by any means (says he) write against the
Bishops, for he could not endure them, they having utterly undone him two or
three times and prosecuted him for the space of forty years, whereupon I told
him that in few days I would do something concerning that Subject, and
perceiving that he was a good cheerful, merry old man, I began with my Letany
which when he had heard it made him laugh as if he had bin tickled, so that I
never saw a man more pleasant at a piece of grillery. And the very day he
brought some Citizens of good repute into my Chamber, who bestowed a dinner on
me, and after they had heard my Letany once, they were so highly pleased at
it, that they int^eated to hear it read again^, and desired each of them a
copy of it, and at their departure they showed themselves very Christianly
noble and kind, and gave me ten peece^, which set me up, and this was the first
curresie that ever I received from any Citizens that were strangers to me,
neither were they loving to me at that time, but now and then they both came
and sent to me, delighting in my company, so as they commended me unto their
Neighbors with compassion grieving as they said, that I should be neglected
and no more regarded, and they read my Letany to them also, and so from one to
another, by this means I came to be knovne, and to be in esteem among some
Godly Citizens, and to be acquainted with them, who showed me many courtesies,
which was not a little comfort unto my bands which I acknowledge with all
thankfulness to God and them (and all these were the old Puritans of E^gland
and now Presbiterians, not one of them independent) and this was the first
occasion of my being known to the City, And not long after this, the good old
Father, brought me acquainted with some young men towardly and fearing God, and
they also took pleasure in my society, and I was as glad of theirs, amongst
the which was Mr. John Lilburne, who as his occasions permitted him, would now
and then visit me, of whom I had then as good an opinion, as of any young man
in the Town, and conceived of him as an honest hopeful and godly youth, and
gave him as good council, as I could give to any, and loved, and esteemed of
him, as I did of any of my Christian Brethren, and after some familiarity and
more intimate acquaintance, he made known unto me his condition, and told me
(as I remembered) that he was now, either out of his time, or that it approached
that he should be a Freeman; but withal related unto me, that his stock was
very small to begin with (and if my memory fail not) he told me he had
but fifty or threescore pound for his portion, which says he, you know, is
very little to set up withal, (But what trade he was of I know not to this
day) and he entreated me, that I would be pleased to give him a Copy of my
Let any, and my answer to the Bill of information put up against me in the
Star Chamber, saying that he doubted not but he should get money enough by
them, for he perceived that they were well approved of by all that read or
seen them: whereupon I diswaded him from thinking of such a thing, telling
him, that it would expose him to great danger, and that it might prove his
ruin: but withal, I said, if that he did really conceive or believe that it
might bring any benefit unto him and might raise him a stock, that withal my
heart, most willingly I would give it him, or any other Copies of anything I
had either in Latin or English: but I told him for my Letanies they were all
gone, and I had never a Copy left. Then he demanded where he ^ight procure
one, and I told him, that one Master Vicars a School Master in Christ church
had one, and I thought that he would be willing to let him have it, whereupon
He entreated me to write unto you Master Vicars, and so I did earnestly,
desiring you to let him have yours, which you most willingly and readily
condescended unto: with all you may remember Mr. Vicars, that I used this
Argument to make you more willing to pleasure him, that he was a hopeful
young man, but he had but a little stock to begin with, and he conceived that
it might be a means the better to set him up, to which you the more willingly
listened unto, and freely gave him my Letany. And all this you can witness
unto. Whereupon John Lilburne repayers to me, returning many thanks, and told
me with all, that he had my Letany, and was now taking his journey into the
Low Countries to print it, and brought with him a young man, whom he said, he
would employ for the dispersing of his books, that he should send over before
his return: but I dissuaded him for confiding in that man (though I had never
seen him before) for I told him I liked not his looks, and I was afraid that
he would betray him: but notwithstanding what I said, he ^eied most
confidently upon him, professing that he would put his life in his hands,
assuring that he had experience of his fidelity, and seeing that I could not
prevail with him to make use of some other, I left him to himself, telling
him again and again, that I was persuaded he would prove a false friend unto
him, for he looked like a knave. And all this John Lilburne cannot deny, and
as I told him it came to pass, for he betrayed him to the Prelates afterward,
but it was carried so cunningly on the Prelates part, and so craftily by that
fellow, that it did not appear to John Lilburne that he was deceived, though
it was palpable to all men besides. But now a word or two of John Lilburnes
success in the Low Countries, when he came thither, he made all speed to
print the Letany, with my answer to the Bill of information, and it was no
sooner published, but he got threescore pounds clearly by it in a few days,
as he himself has often related it to me and others, as I can prove: and
had not that base fellow betrayed him, he might for ought I know, have gotten
five hundred pounds by it: for never did any apolegy sell better: but as soon
as the Books were landed in England, and that, that Judas had intelligence of
it by John Lilburnes Letters, he immediately informed the Prelate of Canterbury
of it, who could not endure the very name of my Letany, and forthwith he sent
down a Pursevant with plenary authority, to the place where they landed, and
surprised all the books and burnt them there where he found them, (if I have
not bin misinformed) and as soon as John Lilburne was arrived he caused him to
be apprehended and cast into rison and after to be censured in the
Star Chamber, and made him most barbarously and cruelly to be whipped, pillired,
and gagged, and afterward to be most tyrannically abused in the Goal,
against all Laws both of God, Nature, and all humanity, all which he might
have escaped, if he would have followed my counsel, and had not trusted to
his own wit, and confided in that treacherous fellow, who was his overthrow.
This is all true, Master Vicars, that I have now related unto you, and both
your self and many more can witness for me, that I have not in my relation
falsified any thing. Now I shall desire you, and all those that shall read
what in truth I have written, to consider, whether I stand obliged to John
Lilburne, with as many ties of friendship and respect, as to any man in the
world (as he affirms) or whether or no, he is not obliged rather to me in
all those ties of friendship and respect, that was so willing to gratify him
merely, for a few visets: for I never at that time had received a farthing of
money from him of his own? Or whether he ventured his life in England and
Holland for my sake, or for his own profit and hope of gain? Or whether he
underwent those miseries he speaks of for my cause, or for his own emolument
and benefits which he affirms? All these things Master Vicars, I refer not
only to your judgment, to be considered of, but to the wisdom and discretion
of all moderate minded men, who if they shall impartially judge, I am most
assured, they will determine that the obligation lies on John Lilburnes part
toward me, and not on my part toward him, especially if they shall seriously
way all other passages between us, which in the following discourse will
appear for I freeley gave him the Copies of both my Letany and answer, never
expecting any profit to my self by them, or ever looking for any reward from
him, or any other thing but his love. And I am most confident, if I could have
been mercenary, as yet I never was, (who never took a penny of my Printer for
any thing I did) I might have had forty pieces at least for the Copies of them:
and it will not be a difficult thing to prove what I now say. Now then whether
or no, John Lilburne be not for this my humanity obliged to me, I leave it to
all men's consideration. And whereas he says he adventured his life at home
and abroad, and underwent all those miseries for my sake and cause, it is most
false: for he exposed himself to all those dangers, as Mariners do to all the
perils of Sea, for hope of gain, and of getting a livelihood for themselves
and their Families; And it is well known that John Lilburne at that time was
not so well instructed in the controversies of the Church as uow he seems to
be, who dares all the World to dispute with him: Neither was it so much his
zeal to the Cause, that put him upon that employment, as the eye he had to his
own honor and profit, which in all probability, if he had not been betrayed,
he would have concommitated his endeavors: and if John had not forgot
himself, he would as formerly he has done acknowledge that I was the best
master, and instructour that ever he had for matters of controversy, and
Religion; so that next unto God he owes his greatest ski^l to me, who was a
good Tutor to him, and I would have him to know that I am yet able to teach
him, and a better Scholar then any independent in England, who are yet to
learn their Primer in Politickes, and their Catechism in Divinity, though
through the judgment of God upon this Nation which affect Novelties the people
are infatuated with that generation of men: and as it is in the song of Moses,
Revel. 15. Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty, and just in
all thy ways, thou King of Saints, to give men over to error because they
receive not the truth, in the love of it, that they might be saved, 2 These. 2.
ver. 10. 11. And if John had but grace in him he would not disdain at this
present, to be advised by me who so long as he followed those wholesome
principles, and the good council I gave him, he had true honor indeed and
might have lived and dyed with comfort and repute, whereas taking those idle
courses, and following a company of unstable guidy-headed people out of vain
glory and ambition to have a name of a Champion of the Independents he
perpetrates those unwarrantable things that brings dishonor to God and
scandalls all Christian Religion, and his holy profession, so that whiles he
would be thought to be a Teacher and Doctor as Saint Paul speaks, 1 Timothy
chap. 1. He understands not what he speaks, nor whereof he affirms, who
has erred from the truth, and is now turned in to vain janglings, not knowing
that the end of the Commandment is love out of a pure heart, and a good
Conscience, and of faith unfeigned, which forbids him to rail of dignities and
to speak evil of Government, and injoynes him to obedience, and teaches him
in love, to think better of others then of himself, and to prefer others
before himself, Romans 12. v. 10. Phil. 2. and not out of a vapouring humor,
proudly and arrogantly to vaunt himself, and dare all others, and our of his
turbulent and tumultuous spirit to raise a Faction to the disturbing of both
Church and State and the disquieting himself and others, to the grief of all
such as wish his good both for soul and body. Now as I have related unto you
Master Vicars* the beginning of our acquaintance, and showed you what the
Obligations were that he says, I stand so much engaged unto him for, so I
think it not amiss to speak of some other passages of love both from my Wife
and my self toward him. As for my Wife in the time of my banishment at his
sufferings, she was failing to him in no offer of friendship but withal tender
affection, she was ever ready to yield him her best assistance in any thing
and night and day she was solicitous for his good providing for him a most
faithful and diligent Surgeon, often visiting him, and stirring up friends
to do him good and according to her own abilities pleasuring him, in any
thing he stood in need of continually taking order that he wanted nothing
that was sitting for a man in his condition, and had as great a care of him, as
if he had been his own Father, and that when he was diserted of his friends
(as can sufficiently be proved) and after he was set at liberty, and I was
returned from my banishment, we lived in as great amity and affection, as ever
any two christian Brethren did, and there was no office of love that I have
ever hitherto been failing to him in, either in his sickness or in health,
notwithstanding in the time of his imprisonment, he falling into acquaintance
with sectaries and straglers, was much swarved from those ^uthes, and that
purity of doctrine he had learned of me; yet all this in the least alienated
not my affection from him, but I continued as cordial as ever, rejoicing
either to see or hear of him, and of his welfare, and he had my praises
wheresoever I came; and all these were obligations, and so would any others
have thought.

And this I may also say, that he may thank me as an earthly instrument (that
I may make use of some of his own language) for all the honor he had in the
world; for his acquaintance with me, and his suffering about my books (as many
of the Parliament have often told me) was the cause that he became so famous,
and so well known and honored, whereas otherwise he might have lived and dyed
in obscurity, and been known no farther then a man can shoot a pelle^ with a
Trunk, and perhaps not to his next neighbors door, as it happens in London to
many thousands of eminenter men, otherwise for all parts then he, though his
abilities are very considerable; and therefore i^ that also he is beholding
unto me.

Besides, I taught him some courtship by being in my company, and made him sit
for all Gentlemen's and Noble-mens society; whereas when he came first to be my
Scholar, though he were Honest and Religious, yet he was but a mere country
courtier, and very rough hewn, so that he could neither make a leg with
grace, nor put off his hat seemly, till I had polished him, and taught him all
his postures of courtship, and now he is become a very gallant Fellow, and has
commenced Lieutenant-colonell Lilburne; and who but John among the
controleresses of dripping-pannes, the Independent sisters?

Besides, by my society he bettered himself, and that not a little in his
language and dialect, and is still beholding to me for many of his best and
choysest expressions, as all that know him can say, and all these were
obligations, which many a grateful man would have thought he could never have
cancelled, though John has forgot all, which makes me therefore (though it be
contrary to my complexion) to enumerate them, that every indifferent and
intelligible man may see, that Lievtenant-colonell John Lilburne is not always
to be believed, though he be in print: And that Master Vicars, you may see how
fairly I deal with him, I will conceal no courtesy that ever he did me, that
all men may behold the extremity of my engagement^ toward him. Whilst he was
in a good mood, he was very loving and kind unto me in word and deed, and when
I was a prisoner in Yorkshire, he labored much for my exchange, and writ many
Letters to my Wife about it, and sent his Drum once or twice to me to
Knarsbrough castle, which was two miles or thereabou^^ from the place where he
billited, and one of those times he sent me ten shillings, which I esteemed of
as a great favor, and in way of thankfulness, I gave unto his Drum eleven
shillings, as the Captain and Soldiers there can witness, who stood by all
the time he or any man talked with me: But by the way, Master Vicars, I will
say thus much, that this ten shillings was the first and last money that ever I
received from John Lilburnt; and withal I profess unto you, that
notwithstanding all our acquaintance, I never yet brake my teeth with any of
his capons, or ever eat of his bread; yet at that time especially, he showed
his readiness to pleasure me; and through his means, as I conceive, many
other great commanders labored my exchange, and sent their Drums and Trumpets
about it to me, as the Earl of Manchester, and General Crumwell; to both
which Honorable Personages, I stand still engaged, for that excellent favor
of theirs: And at my return, he came lovingly out of the city, with others, to
bring me into London. But here let me tell you also Master Vicars, and what I
shall say I am able to prove; that all this time my brother John Lilburne
showed me so much kindness, and was so solicitous for my liberty, and came so
friendly out to meet me, he not only conceived me to be an Independent, but
reported it that I was of their way, and one of them; and this, I say, I can
prove; so that it was not pure charity and unfeigned love, but all under the
notion that I was of his judgment, that he showed me so much favor: For since
that I declared my self that I was of a contrary opinion; it is well known
that he has not only relinquished and abandoned me, but in words most
reproachfully abused ^e, with all manner of calumnies behind my back, calling
me base fellow, paltry fellow, knave, apostate, an enemy of the Generation of
the just, a persec^ter; and all this before his Letter was printed, wherein he
has to the purpose rayled both upon me and my highly honored brother Master
William Prynne; but it is his usual custom thus to asperse the very Nobility
and Peers of the Kingdom, if they do^ not in all things humor him, as the
Illeistrious Earl of Manchester, yea, he spares not the King his Highness,
nor the Parliament.

And for his accomplices, all that Rabble rout, tagragge and bobtaile, that
followed him in these his needless and sought for troubles, as Worly by name,
and others, they told me, and that in a crowded assembly, that I was very high,
but they had known me low enough, and that not long since I lived on their
alms, and affirmed, that they had kept me from hanging, but now I was turned
an Apostate, a persecuter, and an enemy of the godly party, and joined with the
wicked, against the Saints (it seems they are all Saints) and that I had ever
been factious, insomuch that they could not entertain me in their hearts, nor
so much as pray for me: All these reproaches, and a great many more, they cast
upon me in the presence of many, when they were in a tumultuous manner
attending upon the Committee of Examinations, and that without the least
occasion on my part given them, any more then my presence in that place,
whether I was summoned to be a Witness: And for these men that did thus
ignominiously and injuriously relvile me, they were all Lieutenant-colonell
Lilburnes followers and abettors, and seconded by him, and all of them unknown
to me, and such as I had never seen (to my best remembrance) so much as the
very face of any one of them before that day, neither did I ever amongst
christians behold such odd complexions and strange looks; if ever you had seen
the picture of Hell, M. Vicars in York-house, where all the postures of the
damned creatures, with their grisly looks are described, and had also taken
notice, what ghastly, ugly sower and musteds faces, out of dolor, pain and
anguish they made, and had been amongst this company, and had seen what grisly
looks they out of malice, rancor and envy to the Presbyterian party, and
especially to my self had made, and had withal heard their confused, hiddious
noyses, calling for the liberties of the Subjects, and for the benefit of Magna
charta, and the Petition of Right, and for a public hearing, you would have
thought your self in the very Suburbs of Hell, and that these had been the
sons of Pluto or Pinus ascended out of Orco; the complexion also of many of
them being like the belly of a Toad; and to speak the ttuth, Worly was one of
the properest Gentlemen amongst them all, and he was the most remarkable and
taken notice of, by reason of his habit and busy diligence; he went that day
in a great white and brown basket-hilted beard, and with a set of teeth in his
head, much like a Po^-fish, all staring and standing some distance one from
another, as if they had not been good friends; it may be conjectured, he picks
them twice a day with a bed-staffe, they look so white and clear; he was
mighty diligent about the Commonwealth that day, and the Privileges of the
Subject, and all the fraternity came flocking about him upon all occasions, as
a company of Turkyes do about a Frogge, wondering at her as at a strange
sight: Without doubt when the Parliament comes to be recruted, the Independents
will make him a Member; and I am confident he will prove a rotten one, for he
looks as if he had gotten a blow with a French colt-staffe, and it is notorious
he is a bankrupt of all goodness, and whatsoever show he makes now of
Independency, Anabaptisme, or any of the new ways, or to stand for the
Commonwealth, both he and Saint Sprat their Soliciter, have been knaves from
their mothers womb; and therefore Master Vicars, if you have any hand in
choosing of Members, let not him have your voice.

But now to speak something of their babble; how can any man living that either
saw them or knows them perfectly, with reason, imagine that I should ever have
lived of these men's alms? most of which, by all conjectures, live and depend
on other men's courtesies, and are only supported by being of that Faction; for
more obscure and ill conditioned fellows did I never behold: And what a base
lie it was in them, to affirm that they kept me from hanging; whereas I never
was (as all men know) so much as questioned at any Earre, or in any Court for
my life, and therefore had no need of the Psalm of mercy, much less of their
help in that kind; and I bless God, I was never brought so low, that I could
not have subsisted without starving, with the stumps of that estate my Father
left me, after all the vast expenses I was causlesly put unto, by my malicious
enemies in all their Courts, although my children would have fared the worse
for it, and I should not so comfortably perhaps have undergone my imprisonment,
had not my christian friends been some help unto me; and I can truly say this,
and make it appear, that all that ever I received by way of curtifie, does not
amount by a thousand pound and more, to that means my Father left me, besides
my Wives portion; so that I am above two thousand pounds worse, in real money
and estate at this day, besides the loss of my time, for these twelve years,
since which my troubles began, above eight of which I was kept a close
Prisoner, and three of them in banishment; and they that know what I am now
worth, can witness the same for me, men of reputation: And therefore they were
barbarously insolent so to speak to me; and indeed all the standers by
wondered at their rudeness and inhumanity toward me, affirming that they
never saw a more uncivil and ill conditioned people.

But here we may take notice what a slavery it is for any man to be beholding
to such a generation of creatures, who upon the least conceived displeasure,
will cast their courtesies (if any) in the teeth of those to whom they have
shown them, if in the smallest punctillio you be not of their mind: And
therefore we are councelled by Saint James, if we want wisdom or any good
thing, to ask it of God, who (says he) gives liberally and upbraideth not,
Jam. P. 5. And if these men had ever given me any thing, as I am most confident
they never did, yet all the world knows, that when they gave it, it was for
this reason, that they were then of my mind (for they say now they cannot pray
for me) which argues their want of charity, their levity, fickleness and
instability in all their ways; but this is that that all their fraternity
daily cast in my dish, though I am most assured, if all that ever I received
from them, or any of those that are now of that society, it will not all amount
to three score pounds, and I am able to make good that I now speak: And yet
these are the daily claimours of this people, and only for my constancy; for
all that have read my books for which I suffered, and know me, can free me from
that aspersion of apostasy and faction, and from being an enemy to the truly
godly party, and to the Saints, who I honor and love with my life. And after
the very same manner, not long since, Master Samuel Goose, one of that way, a
man that I never saw, to my best remembrance, till my last enlargement from
prison; yet he also upbraided me with his curtisies, and told me, I had forgot
my self, and that I had grieved and sadded the hearts of the Saints, and that
he was very sorry for me, to see me side against the godly party; and in a very
imperious manner told me, that whilst I writ against the Independents, I writ
against Christ and his truth; and thus did Saint Gander hiss a^ me, and
Grollise, who is a plaguey Stickler amongst the Independents, and a very busy
Solicitor of their affairs, which I am afraid, if they be not speedily looked
unto, will bring ruin upon the whole Kingdom.

Master Vi^ars, I have been something longer then I thought to have been, (...)
I was willing to set before your eye, the full^Narration of all passages
between me and Lievtenant-Colonel Lilburn, with his accomplices and the occasion
of our acquaintance, that you and all men may the better judge, whether I stand
engaged to this man in so many obligations as he pr^tends, or whether he be not
rather obliged to me in them all, and has proved very ungrateful unto me, who
for my good will and love to him, a mere stranger to me at first, and never
giving him any just occasion, has so maliciously and falsely aspersed me to the
whole Kingdom, and causelessly brought all the Independent party upon me, who
in all places and in all companies (which I account of for my honor) most
unhumanely rail on me; for if he had not laid that calumny upon me, and
incensed them against me, I am persuaded whatsoever evil opinion they might
have conceived of me secretly, because I differ from them, yet they could never
so shamefully have vented themselves in public, so that he has proved
himself guilty of both these crimes, lying and ingratitude, that he accused me
of, and wronged both me and all his party, and made all his associates
offenders in many respects, by these his pactices; for in complying with them
in his unwarrantable ways, they have made themselves equally guilty before God
and men, and have a great deal to answer for their tumultuous disorderly
carriage in all that business, which to speak the truth, concerned them not;
neither had there been any just cause of offense given by me (if they would but
deliberately weigh all things with reason among themselves) if I had indeed
informed against Lieutent-Colonell Lilburne, (which I did not) neither could it
deservedly have been accounted a crime; for there is no tie of friendship that
ought to make me desert my duty to the public, and to break my Covenant, and
violate my Protestation; by virtue of both which, I ought to inform the
Parliament and State of any thing that I thought of common concernment, made
for the peace of the whole Kingdom, and the honor of the Parliament, which I
am bound to maitaine with the reputation of every Member of that Supreme and
Honorable Court; for they are our Fathers, Magistrates and Protectors, and
every Subject that is under obedience (and that has taken the Covenant and
Protestation) is tied in as much as in him lies, to preserve and defend them in
their lives and reputation: And if any be informed concerning any one in that
Council, that he should either do, practice or attempt any thing that tends
to the ruin of the rest, and of the whole State and Kingdom, he is in
conscience bound to reveal it, (that if false, the divulgers of such calumnies
may receive condign punishment; if true, evil may be prevented) and this I
say he ought to do, though it should be to the prejudice of his nighest alies
and intimatest acquaintance; and this I conceive among the Independents may be
thought no unjust act, which this information of mine could not have done,
(...) I by name, put it up against Lieutenant-Colonell Lilbure (as he falsely
(...) me) for he might as well have freed himself from all danger, and (...)
reputation (if he had told me those things as well as Hankins, who (...)
^ithstanding he related them unto us, not as hear-sayes and (...) others, but
as truths, which he said should be proved; yet this (...) questioned about it,
and but relating that he received and heard it (...) Colonel Lilburne, he was
forthwith discharged; even so might he have been, if he had modestly told where
he had heard that report, and not in a disguised, rebellious and proud manner
behaved himself: And it makes all men wonder to see the inconsiderable
rashness of all that party, who fall so violently upon me, for but putting up
my paper against Hankins, when Saint Worly and his associates (for so they
would be accounted) made the same information to four Members of the House
before, and have ever since with Spirit Sprat been the only prosec^tors of
that but business; especially they ought not to have been so furio^s against
me, when Hankins reported it, that he related it to Colonel King and my self
for this very end, that the whole matter might be fully searched into, saying,
after I had lodged it with the Doctor and Colonel King, I left it, desiring
that the nail might be droven to the head, and that the truth might be found
out: This was his expression.

Now when I have gratified Master Hawk^ns desires, who is the Sagamore of the
Independants, and done but my duty and what he and his company would have me to
do, and what they themselves do act; may it not seem a strange thing both to
your self Master Vicars, and all that shall understand the true relation of
these things, that the Independants should thus clamor against me, and that
for no other cause Lieutenant Colonel should accuse me for lying and
ungratitude in the face of the Kingdom? I am almost of opinion, that many of
the Independants when they shall hear the truth, will condemn all their
rashness in this point; and truly if ever there were not only temerity and
uncharitableness but unjustice in an action it does appear in their dealing
toward me and the Parliament; for their malice extends not to me only, but to
many Members of the House, yea, it redounds upon the whole Parliament and every
particular Gentleman of the same that are Presbyterians; for Lievt. Col.
Lilburn blams them al as guilty of unjustice and unrighteous dealing, and so
did all his company, and spak it openly in the presence of hundreds, that there
was no just proceeding amongst them, and that they had not the liberty of
Subjects and their privileges, according to Magna Charta, and the Petition of
Right, and this they with one accord affirmed openly at the Committee door; so
that Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburne is but their mouth, and the foreman of that
Tribe, and what he did, they all own, and to this day persevere in it; and not
only so, but labor to spread his Letter through the Kingdom, that so they
may with the more facility spread abroad and publish the sentence given by the
Lieutenant against the whole Parliament, the better to bring an Odium upon them
all; for in his book he pronounces sentence against them all, being party,
witness, jury and judge in his own cause; and in his so doing, whiles he calls
to Heaven for justice against the Parliament, he shows himself very unjust,
and behaves himself rather like the wicked Judge, that neither feared God, nor
cared for men, then the most righteous Judge of the whole world, who would not
condemn the innocent (...) wicked, as we may see in the 18. of Genesis.

(...) do believe that the Lieutenant conceives very worthily of his own party
in both Houses, and thinks that they are just, upright righteous men, and the
only godly party in the Parliament (for so I have heard the Lieuten. Col.
speak) and I persuade my self also that he is not so uncharitable, as to think
all the Presbyterian party in both Houses unjust and unrighteous; now then if
there be any either of the Independent party, or of the Presbyterian, that are
truly just and righteous in their proceedings, he ought to have spared them;
there is an old saying, we ought not per lutum uni^^ totam gent^m perstr^^gere,
he should indeed (if he had known any guilty of crime, and if he would have
dealt justly) have singled them out, as he did me, and by name have aspersed
them, and not have condemned the whole Council in one blast, and with one dash
of his quill: Any as he deals unjustly with the Parliament, so he he deals
not very righteously with me and my Brother Pryn for he condemns us both of
lying, yet never convinced me of a lie, nor I hope never shall be able, for I
writ nothing in my books against the Independents, but what upon my own
knowledge I can affirm to be true; yea depose it, having had what I wrote from
the Independ^^ts own mouths, but that which coroberates what I say; I can
prove all I wrote against them by a cloud of witnesses, the worst of them being
better then the best of those witnesses they produced against Sir John Lenthall
and Master Speaker; and therefore that which I writ against their Faction, is
so far from being a crime (...) a lie, as I stand upon my justification, and
undertake upon my life to make good the charge in my postscript against the
Independents, or whatsoever I writ in any other book against them.

Nay, I undertake to prove a great deal more then I have yet published, and
that that may concern all Presbyterians especially, and make them look to
themselves; for if they get the day and prevail, they will spare none of them,
for they have a purpose to put down all the Nobility and Gentry in the
Kingdom, (I speak nothing but what I know,) howsoever their design is
carried very cunningly; but let them once attain unto their purpose at the
recruting of the Parliament, which is, to bring in out of all the Countyes, the
Independent country Courtiers, to whom they will give instructions for this
purpose, and you shall see such an alteration in a little time, that the Nobles
and Pears of the Kingdom, and all the Gentry of the same, the Flower and
honor of all Nations, to be the most contemptible, and the only men to be
suspected, who by all the Independent party at this day, have been accused to
be the ruin of the Kingdom, and to be of rotten hearts, and the Kings
friends; and this I have heard many of them my self speak, and I am confident,
it may by many be proved, but this has ever been their evasion, when we accuse
them of any thing they say, that they may not all be blamed and judged for the
rashness of some, when notwithstanding they that uttered such words, spoke
nothing but what they had learned from their faction, or what they had received
from the chief heads of them: And it is well known that Lieutenant-Colonell
Lilburne is upheld by that party, and (...), yea animated in all that he does,
as all the crowds and (...) after him may sufficiently witness, and they look
upon him as their Champion, applauding all his actions. And it will not be a
difficult thing for me to prove whatsoever I have written in my books against
the Indepedent party, from their own books, and even from his own Letter,
and the proceedings of that company that followed him to the Committee of
Examinations, and their behavior and carriage there, may abundantly prove my
charge in my book against them; for they gave laws to the Committee, and
would not be examined but upon their own terms, crying out of injustice, and
threatening that they would bring up the whole City, and a thousand such other
insolences they used there for many days together; all which do manifest,
that if in time their party grow a little stronger, they will give laws to the
Parliament, and make them do what they would have them, or else they will take
the authority into their own hands; for Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburne has
plainly taught his Disciples, that the power that now resides in the
Parliament, is inherent to the people, and that those of the Parliament are not
to act according to their own will and pleasure, and boldly takes upon him to
instruct the Parliament and teach them their duty; and affirms, that the power
is the peoples birthright, and that they have but entrusted them with it; so
that it seems if they shall once conceive that the Parliament does not
discharge their trust they have committed unto them, they may resume it when
they please, for that must necessarily ensue from his premises; and this is the
Doctrine that he infuseth to all his followers, and only for to stir up a
commotion in the Kingdom, and to put the people in a heat; which if the
Parliament timely prevent not, they will run the greatest hazard of being
destroyed, that ever any Council in the world did.

And whereas he says, that when the King went to Oxford, he left many of his
friends behind him: I for my part believe that he is one of them; for I am most
assured, that never any friend the King had, has done the Parliament more
wrong and indignity than Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburne; for it was not an
apparent enemy to the great Council, that has done them this wrong, it was no
Aulicus, for then they would have laughed at it, and made themselves merry with
it, but it was their friend, their familiar one, that the Commonwealth had fed
at her table* and one that the Parliament had in special honored, favored, and
confided in, and who they had stood by in his greatest difficulties, yea, and
had preserved his life; and for this man now to lay so foul things to their
charge, as unjustice and tyranny, and trampling down of the liberties of the
Subjects; oh let not this be spoke in ^^b and Askelon! truly such friends as he
is, both are, and will prove, I am afraid, their greatest enemies; and
howsoever he often boasts and tell^^h them, that he has drawn his sword in
their defense; it does appear, that it was for his own base ends, for liberty
of conscience (as they call it in their dialect) which is mere licenciousnesse,
and lawless liberty, under the pretense of conscience which they aim at, that
they may both speak, print and do whatsoever please^t the^^^lves, both
against the Law of God, Nature, and the Religion, and against the great
Council of the Kingdom, Synod, and all good men, which is their daily
practice, as all their Pamphlets witness, and this his Letter; for had
Colonel Lilburne with a good intention and an honest mind, drawn his sword in
the defense of the Parliament, he would not now have drawn his pen to have cut
all their throats, and to enrage all the people against them, as in this his
Letter he has done: He tells many stories of his service for the State, and
what danger he has exposed himself unto in their quarrel, and upbraiderh
them all with their ingratitude, and how little requital they have made him
for all; there are many in this Kingdom that have adventured themselves as
far as ever he did, out of their love to the public, and have I believe
suffered as much as ever he did, yet make no noise, but with modesty and
patience, wait and attend till the great and weighty matters in the Kingdom,
will give leave for private businesses: And all men know, that the public
good, the preservation of the whole body, is to be looked unto in the first
place; and then afterward as occasion does offer it self, without damage to
the public; private bus^nesse and the relief of the necessiited, are taken
into consideration, and satisfaction is given unto them that can justly
complain; and this has ever been the practice and custom of all Nations, as
the Annals and Histories of all times relate: Neither have such as have been
forced to wait, forthwith published disgraceful books, and mutinous complaints
against the Councels and States of any Country, to bring them into hatred
amongst the people; neither would such proceedings be thought tolerable in any
well governed Country.

It is well known, that there are many Noblemen and great Gentlemen also of
honor and eminency in the Kings Army, that have not only ventured their lives
and all their estates, but are at this day brought to such extremities and
necessities, as to relate would exceed belief, so that many of those that had
some three, some four thousands by the year, some more, are brought to such
streights, as they have not bread to put in their families mouths, nor
clothing to p^t on their backs; yet I never heard that they did ever print
Letters in disgrace of the King or his Council and upbraid him with ingratitude
toward his Soldiers, because their particular necessities were not satisfied,
or because they conceived they were wronged by his Majesty's Council: And I am
most assured, that if any of those that follow the King should do any such
thing, or durst attempt to disparage the Kings proceeding, being one of that
party, he would not only be abhorrid by all the Cavaliers, but thought worthy
of severe punishment, whatsoever former service he had done his Majesty.

Nay, I will speak my knowledge, I have heard a Cavalier say, that if any of
their party should have done any thing in this kind against his Highness or
his Council, the other Cavaliers would have cut him in pieces: And truly all
sober minded men, and such as stand really well-affected to the Parliament,
cannot think those the Parliaments friends, that in this kind write against
them and their proceedings: For were it granted, that Lieutenant-Colonell
Lilburne had done as good service, as he pretends, though there be many that
say, that the devisions that he has caused at Bosterne, and through
Lincolnshire, with his preaching up his new Doctrine of separation* has done
more hurt to the souls and bodies of the people, then all the good that ever
he is able to do.

But I say, were it granted that he had done all good service without
exception; yet the disgrace and evil he has now done to the State, has
surpassed all the good he speaks of: Many Cowes you know Master Vicars
ordinarily give good milk, and then scummer in the payle, by which they spoil
all that they had given down; even so it is in this case with
Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne, what he has formerly built up, that he has now
thrown down: He may remember what the Lord says, Ezekiel. 10. If the righteous
turns from his righteousness, and does that which is evil, I will forget
all his righteousness, says the Lord etc. So if a Commander do faithful
service for a time to a State, as the Hothams did, or as ^holmly, and
afterward turn traitors, must the memory of their former service hinder the
course of justice? I trow not; if a servant for some time shall do good
service for his Master, and afterward prove unfaithful, or purloyne his goods,
and labor to destroy him, is his former service to be taken any notice of? it
is perseverance in any good that crowns all; and therefore it is but a poor
grollety to speak of good service formerly done, when they are acting all the
evil that men can well act against a State or Kingdom.

But one thing is very observable, he would brand me with great ingratitude,
and as if I had forgot what he had done for me, and in the mean time he is
guilty of the same crime: For it is well known, that the Parliament not only
saved his life, but delivered him from his slavery and captivity, and greatly
honored him, and for ought I know, would have made him a full satisfaction for
all his damage and suffering by the unjust Courts, when from their public
affairs, they could have been permitted to have listened to private grievances;
yet he has forgot all this their courtesy, and singular humanity, and now
flings dirt in all their faces, and so despightfully abuses them, as no
ordinary well bred man would abuse an ordinary base fellow: But because this is
a business that concerns the honor of the whole House, which he has so
contumeliously blasted, I shall leave that to their grave wisdom; only out of
my duty to that great Council, the Supreme Court of the Kingdom, I may say
thus much, that the whole Kingdom owe the preservation of their Religion,
lives and liberties, to their care and watchfulness, and that all our
Posterity are bound to be thankful to them for their fidelity, diligence and
infatigable prayers in their common defense, who, all reason will dictate,
could have no end for what they have done, but the common good and safety of us
all: And therefore it concerns all the people to take heed how they join and
adhere to Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburne, and such factious spirits, who under
pretense of defending the Subjects Liberty, raise tumults to bring all to a
confusion: And let them ever set before their eyes the story of Cora, Da^^an
and Abiram, and seriously weigh what they brought upon themselves by their
rebelling against Moses their deliverer and preserver, they cannot be ignorant,
that while they assent unto him, and applaud and own what he rashly and
unadvisedly does, they make themselves equally guilty; for as David says,
Psalm. 50. He that consents with evil doers, makes himself as guilty as
they: So does the Apostle Paul teach all men, in his Epistle to the Romans,
chap. 1. 2. they that consented to those impious and wicked men, were in Gods
account as equally guilty as if they had perpetrated al those facinourus
actions; yea, it is the practice of all Courts in all the Kingdoms and Nations
of the whole world to condemn the accomplices of treasons as well as the others:
And as no men, no not the Independents themselves, can indeer those that comply
with such as they conceive to be their enemies, so they should now make the
Parliaments Cause their own (for it is their own indeed) and think that it
highly concerns them all, and i^ may be their condition ere long; for destroy
once the power of the Parliament, and enervate their authority, and you shall
shortly see every Country Courtier, fly not only in the face of the Gentry and
Nobility, but indeed every servant become a Master and Mistress, and cast off
the yoke of obedience to their Superiors, whether Parents, Masters or
Governors; and therefore it concerns all men, as they will avoid both the
wrath of God and inevitable danger, now to take special heed what they do, in
abetting with Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburne, in these his temerarious
proceedings; for I well perceive the poor people are all deluded by his false
information, and think his imprisonment, and the proceedings of the honorable
Committee of Examinations, to be against the liberty of the Subject, and
against Magna Charta, and the Petition of Right, all which inviolably remain
to the Subject, notwithstanding whatsoever he pretends to the contrary: And
as he has traduced the Parliament causlesly, so likewise in his own defense
he has abused the holy Scripture; for there is a vast difference between Saint
Paul's ca^se and his, as will quickly appear, if there be but a true
information made of Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburnes business, for the story of
Paul's sufferings is sufficiently known.

The verity of the matter is, the Parliament in their proceedings with John
Lilburne, have done nothing contrary to the Law of God or nature, or the
custom of Nations, and the Laws of the Kingdom, and therefore so horrid an
accusation of the great Counsel is unsufferable: He quarrels the Parliament
amongst other things, that he was sent to prison, the cause not being specified
of his commitment: If indeed he had been arraigned and condemned before he had
been heard, then there had been a just cause of complaint; but that they did
not in their Warrant set down the cause both of his apprehension and
Commitment: I must confess for my part, I see no cause why he should make so
loud a complaint; for if there should now in the City of London a conspiracy be
discovered, and some of the Conspirators should be appprehended (under
reformation) I conceive it will not stand with the wisdom of the City
Office^s, and with the discretion of those that are in authority, to set down
the cause of their apprehension and sending them to prison; for if their
accomplices should have intelligence of this, that their plot was discovered,
they would all either escape away, or attempt some desperate thing that might
be destructive to the whole City, and that that might endanger the whole
Kingdom; therefore in such a case as this, it is for the wisdom of the
Officers to conceal the conspiracy till they have apprehended all the
Delinquents; and in such a case as this is, and many more, the Magistrate may,
as I conceive, send any man to prison without signifying the cause why unto the
prisoner: For I read in many places of the Scripture that prisoners have been
committed, and there was no cause given either to him that was committed, or to
the Jailer, wherefore he was committed, and yet they are not condemned of
unjustice for so doing: But when men have been condemned without hearing, or by
false witnesses, this has made it a crime.

Neither hitherto have I ever read, that it was counted a crime in a
Magistrate, or an unjust thing, or a thing against the Law of God, nature or
Nations, to ask any man that is apprehended a question; or to demand of him,
whether he either spoke any such words, or heard any such, or did such a thing,
or did it not; for none of both these proceedings were counted a crime in
either Joseph or Joshua, or any other of the Rulers in Israel; for Joseph cast
his brother into prison upon suspicion, and questioned all his other brethren
upon a pretended jealousy, and yet they accused not the Governor of Egypt of
unjustice to their good old Father: Neither was it a crime in Joseph to
question his brethren (if the business had been real;) or in Joshua to ask
Achan whether or no he had taken the wedge of gold: And if either Joseph's
brethen or Achan had refused to have answered to the question propounded unto
them, til either Joseph or Joshua had told them the cause of their apprehension
or commitment, I believe they might have lain in prison till Doomsday in the
afternoon (the time that John Lilburne thinks the Parliement will pay him what
they owe him) and no wise man would have condemned the Governor of Egypt for
so doing; and therefore he most shamefully abuses the Parliament for their
proceedings against him, which stand very well with the Laws of God, and all
well governed Nations; and the Scripture that he cites, concerning Paul, was
nothing to the purpose, for Paul stood committed, and that upon suspicion: But
the Judge thought it unjustice to proceed to sentence, before that they had
heard what Paul could say for himself in his own defense, and so the
Parliament will do to him; and I am most assured, he shall have all the fair
hearing in the world; but all this is nothing to Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburne's
cause, who might have been released, as Hawkins was, and without any dishonor
unto him, if he had not disobediently behaved himself to the honorable
Committee. For they demanding of him a question, which by all the laws of God
and nature, and Nations, they might do, and to which without offending, he
might well have answered; he contemptuously not only refuses to answer, but
asperseth them with unjustice, which was the cause of the conti^uation of his
commitment, and then his publishing of a libellous and a most dangerous Letter,
was a cause of his new commitment to Newgate: And in all this that the
Parliament has done, I am confident when the people shall have a full hearing
of the same, and be rightly informed, they will be abundantly satisfied of the
justice of the Honorable House.

Much I confess I could say for the justifying of the Parliaments proceedings,
not only in this business about John Lilburne, but all their other grave and
weighty employments, to free that great Council from those aspersions that not
only John Lilburne lays upon it, but all his accomplices; but I shall leave
this work to those that it concerns, only by the way let me say thus much
both to John Lilburn and his confederates, that they ought alwai^ to have
special care, that whiles they study and labor to offend their enemies, they
do not destroy their preservers, and abuse those men causelessly as wish them
as much good as they do themselves, though they tell them of their faults and
errors; and amongst others all the Independents have most injuriously in word
and deed abused my ever honored brother M. Prynne; and John Lilburne in this
his Letter in special, to my knowledge has most basely and falsely belyed him;
for it is well known he was never a favourer of Malignants and such as
betrayed strong Holds, as the business of Bristow can well witness, for the
prosecuting of that so cordially enraged many of the Independents against him;
and there be many that can witness for my brother Prynne that he was not the
cause of the loosing of Gernsey, for had his counsel been followed both those
Islands at this day had bin under the command of the Parliament; and what he
published concerning the two Captains it has been proved by sufficient
witness, whatsoever they say to the contrary; and Sir Samuel Luke, a man of
honor and approved integrity, would never have questioned them without
sufficient witness for what he chageth them with; and as I have bin credibly
informed, every thing he accuses them of is abundantly proved by two or three
witnesses. But this is the practice daily of the Independents, that they will
own nothing of that they have said or done, but put men upon the proof, and
then asperse all those that justly question them for liars and persecutors; as
at this time that confounded tailor Paul Hobson and Richard Beawmon a sucking
Apothecary do, who snip and dose out their Sermons by weight and measure to
the infecting, misleading and seducing of the poor people, and the making a
disturbance in Church and State; and these seducers notwithstanding would
persuade the world they are sent from heaven, when as it is most apparent they
are mere juglers and imposters, and only make a pray of the people and lead
them captive to liberty and licenciousnesse; such Teachers as these are so
far from a just call from heaven, as they run before they were ever sent;
so that a man may truly say of such Teachers and Ministers Diabolus caccavit
illos: and therefore my reverend brother Master Prynne has writ nothing but
the truth concerning them, and is most maliciously and causelessly abused by
Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne, and therefore this that he speaks concerning
him it not to be believed, it being an untruth: And as little credit is to be
given to that he relates of himself, how he dared Master Prynne to dispute
with him, but the Simpleton, as he calls him, durst not.

If Lieutenant Colonel Lilburne had really challenged him in that place, it
had bin very incivily done in him; for the Committee, as it is well known, does
not sit there to hear Disputations, and I believe, if he should have showed
himself so vain and light, as to have vented his folly in this kind, they
would not only have sharply reproved him for his temerity, but have clapped him
by the heels, as they might not have done; but as I have been credibly
informed, it is nothing so, he never challenged him; and therefore it is a
notorious lie, although it be in Print. And whereas he says, my brother
Prynne is besotted and out of his wits in collecting and publishing Marty^^
Books and the scurrilities of the Independent party, with many of the
blasphemings and railing speeches against the great Council of the Kingdom
and their proceedings, and against the reverend Synod and Assembly, and indeed
against all Authority. I conceive he has done a very good and acceptable work
in reducing their railings, revilings and blasphemies into a volumne, that they
may be left to all postity and future ages, that in times to come the following
generations may hear what a hideous and monstrous Sect in these last and worst
times of the world is now risen up, which speak evil of dignities and all
government at pleasure.

Neither has my brother Prynne in this transgressed, but has imitated all the
Prophets and the blessed Apostles and Evangelists, who have lest upon record
all the blasphemies of Senacharib, and of all the wicked men in their several
ages; David has done the same concerning the enemies of God and his people in
his days; the Evangelists also have recited all the blasphemous speeches they
spoke against Christ and Saint John Baptist, and all the other Apostles have
done the same, as Peter in special and Jude; so that by their writings all men
may see what a wicked generation of men were then living, and what judgments
of God lighted upon them for their so doing, to lesson all people in future
ages to take heed by their examples, lest they provoke God by the like
wickedness; for whatsoever was written was written for our instruction, upon
whom the ends of the world are come.

Now when my brother Prynne has in this done nothing but what he has
presidents for, and that out of Gods Word, he is neither besotted nor out of
his wits, as he maliciously and falsely asperseth him; but they rather are
besotted that either write, read or entertain in their houses with delight
such wicked Books as tend to no other end, but to the corrupting not only of
good manners, but the adulterating of the true Religion and perverting of men's
judgments: and yet Books of this nature are continually to be found in the
hands and houses of all the Independents, and I know few other that are by them
either regarded or looked after; so that it is just with God to give such as
they are over to fearful errors, who leave the fountains of living waters
and dig unto themselves such broken cesternes that hold nothing but puddle
and s^inking filth.

This I thought by the way to speak in my brother Prynnes behalf, nothing
doubting but himself, or some friend for him will shortly publish his just
defense, against all other reproaches, to the world.

And now Master Vicars, I hope you are satisfied concerning John Lilburnes
calumnies against me and my brother Prynne, but for a corolary let me say thus
much, that whereas John Lilburne would accuse me of ingratitude, I may justly
complain of his unthankfulnes and uncharitablenes toward me, who has rewarded
me evil for good; for all that know me can testify for me, that I was ever his
friend to my power; but it is not he alone that would make me an ungrateful
man, but all of that way asperse me with the same crime; many of the which
notwithstanding, have for small favors done to me in the time of my
imprisonment, been six times over requited for it, as I can prove, and yet they
cry out of my unthankfulness, and others of them that sent me now and then a
Piece, as a token of their love, and as a free gift, when they turned
Independents, demanded it all of me again, and I have paid them every penny,
four pounds at a time, according to their asking, and yet they cry out of my
ingratitude, and have to my face most basely upbraided me with their kindnesses.

Solomon says, he that contends with a fool, whether he rage or laugh there
is no peace; so he that has to do with the Independents can have no peace
with them, if in the least they differ from them; for if ye be merry with them
in telling them of their grolleries, then they say ye jeere them, if ye be
serious then they say ye rail, so that no man can tell how to please or humor
them or how to enjoy the laws of civility amongst them, or to have any peace
in their societies, neither the Parliament, nor Synod, nor Presbytry, or any
government can please them, for if the Parliament will have them fast, then
they will feast, and if they would have them feast and be merry, then they will
mourn, and set days apart for humiliations, and say, they are sad times,
nothing can please the Gentlemen, as their practices can witness: And truly if
ever there were a contradicting people, and an ungrateful generation of men to
all sorts of benefactors, these are; if a man consider things, either in
general or in special.

As for the Parliament, it is well known, that they have honored that Sect,
as much as ever any authority did any, for they have the principal Offices in
the Army, and through the Kingdom places of chief trust and government put in
their hands, the prime places of gain and emolument likewise bestowed upon
them, through all Counties, and are ordinarily as well paid for their service
as any, and yet none speak more unreverendly of the great Counsel, more harsh,
more bitter invectives against them and their proceedings then they, and more
asperse their authority, by their practices then they do, as all their words,
pamphlets, preachings and actions can witness.

As for their ingratitude toward our brethren the Scots, and it is notorious
to all men, for they cannot give them a good word for all their love to us, no
not at this time of their di^^esse, when it appears to the whole world, that
they have by assisting us, not only exposed all their lives to peril, but
endangered their whole Country, and now lie wallowing in their blood at home
for being friends to us; and yet for all this their love, they cannot neither
think nor speak well of them; such ingratitude was never seen in any Nation; a
sin so great, and crying so loud in the ears of Almighty God, that were this
Kingdom guilty of no other, it were enough to bring down the plagues of God
upon us.

And howsoever their Ministeus enjoy all our Pulpits, and have such privileges
and immunities without all control, as was never by any State granted to any
sect; yet they cry out of persecution and ill usage, whiles they themselves
abuse the whole world, and persecute in tongue and print, every living thing
that in the least does not please their humor: And for such as have done
incomparable favors and courtesies to many of them, and who have entertained
them in their houses, by the six months together, gratis, with their Wives
and Children, and shown them surperlative humanity, yet in their greatest
extremities, when they have been plundered of all, stripped naked, and some of
them have fled to London with scarce a rag of their backs, and have applied
themselves to some of these Ministers, thinking that they would have retained a
memory of former courtesies, they would not own them or scarce look on them; and
when poor Gentlewomen, that lived in time of their prosperity in reputation
and honor, and had servants then to wait on them, and being now deprived of
all, and brought to beggary, and did only desire them to get them but a
service in some friends house of theirs, professing that they would willingly
submit themselves to the lowest condition, rathet then be a burden to any, so
long as they had their health; yet they could not by all their importunity
extort a good word out of their heads in their behalf; and when they desired
but their wives to give them but one of their old petticoats to cover their
nakedness; for answer, they were told* that they were now going over into the
Low Countries again, and that they had sent over all their clothing, so that
they had nothind left to give away; and this was two years since, and they are
yet in England, and have got very fat Congregations and of chief women not a
few; so that had not some Presbyterians and strangers too, taken some
compassion of them, they might have starved for all the Independent Ministers
and their Wives, as can be proved, notwithstanding they were obliged unto them
with all the ties of friendship; and when they were in their friends houses, as
they had all respectful usage so they looked for it, and expected daily to eat
and drink of the best, or else they might hear of it.

But as the ingratitude of the Independents is generally taken notice of, so
especially of their Ministers toward their Benefactors; and their
covetousness is very remarkable, so that it may be proved, that some of the
Independent Ministers have got more in a year here in London, then ten
Presbyterian Ministers, and yet they are as covetous as ever they were, and as
much as ever complaining of want, and of the hardness of the times, and for
their pharisaicall pride, it is incomparable, and commonly they insinuate
themselves into rich acquaintance, and love ever to be where good cheer is
stirring, only in this they differ from the Pharisees, for they fasted often,
twice or (...) a we^ke, and th^se feast and fare deliciously every day; and if
they spare a dinner under pretense of an humiliation, they will be sure to sup
exceeding well and of the best; there is some of them gone down to the Army, I
presume they may trayle them all through Cornwall and Devonshire with a
White-pot; and there is no child shall leap so at the sight of a Baby as they
will skip at the fruition of a Custard; they will smell a Feast to the remotest
parts of Ireland, and the gravy of a chine of Beef into the midst of Wales,
so sensible they are of good cheer; I dare boldly say that, let a Venison
Pasty be the Text, four Independent Ministers shall open and devide it better
and more acurately handle it then any eight Presbyters in the City of London;
so that if ye behold them sometimes at a Feast, you would take them to be the
Nephews of Helliogabalus. There is not any man that shall seriously think of
them but will say they have very accute senses, that can out of the Americans
and out of the Low Countries smell the good ^heere and plum-pottage into
England, which was indeed one of the chiefest causes that made these men leave
their charges and flocks there, and choose rather to live among Wolves, Bears,
Lions and Tygars, (for so they term us) for certainly if it were not good
cheer, and their belly that made them dwell amongst us, they would never have
lived here, but as long as that last we shall have their company, but when that
ceases, their zeal will grow cold; for they have sent over their treasuries
into Holland and into New England; but as long I say, as there is a carcass
left, they will stay by it; for our Savior says, where the carcass is,
thither the Eagles fly, and therefore they are here yet fluttering about, and
when they have picked the bones of it well, then they will take take their
flight and be gone; the Lord send us peace and fair weather after them.

But in in the mean time Master Vicars, it concerns us all to take heed of
them, for they are a very dangerous people in all respects; for besides their
good conditions that I have now named, they are terrible dissemblers, and
notorious liars, as their daily language and libels can witness, and this
Letter of Lieutenant-Colonell Lilburne testifies; and you also know what a
notorious lie one of their chief Pastors told not long since of my reverend
brother Waker, and he did not only divulge it, but stands in the justification
of it; and yet there are diverse men, and them of reputation, can witness the
contrary to what he affirms, so that no man of a contrary mind, can with
safety converse among them; for they will lay any thing to his charge, and then
swear to it, yea they turn ordinary tale-bearers, the worst of men, and
violate many times all the laws of humanity to satisfy their spleen, and will
peccare contra jura jovis hostitatis, and all civility, to do a Presbyterian a
mischief; and thus unchristianly dealt that independent Pastor with my
reverend brother Master Waker, to make him od^ous; and I have taken notice,
that it is their practice to tell tales and lies, and therefore I shun them
all; saving my good Cozen.

I must confess, if at the recruting of the Parliament, the Independent
Country Courtiers creep in there, I do verily believe that the Greeks (...)
never so pollute the Temple, as they will defile the Honorable House, and then
down also goes the Gentry and the Nobility, and all Churches; for they begin
already to piss in them, and to scummer in the Pewes of Gentleman, out of a
hatred they bear to that name, disdaining that any should be thought greater
then themselves; telling them when they forcibly crowd into their seats, that
the Saints have more right to those places then they, and therefore partly for
the stinking of them out of their seats, as Baggars do Foxes out of their
holes, by defiling them, these Independent Country Courtiers scummer and piss
in their Pewes; and partly also they do it out of hatred to the very structure
of the poor Churches, which say they, having been consecrated to Idolatry,
ought to be demolished, or else made a Tophet on, and a place of easement, and
therefore it is now grown an ordinary thing with the Independents thus to
pollute Churches; and some of them would have given seven thousand pound, not
long since, for Paul's, that they might have demolished it as an Idol Temple,
and so in their judgments the Gentry and Nobility are Idols, and have too long
been adored and venerated, and they now desire that honor themselves, and
therefore if once they have the power in their hands, and get into the
Parliament, then out go all the sons of Belial, fot so they call the Gentry:
Therefore if you have any acquaintance with those that are to choose Burgesses
for the Parliament, give them a special caviat to take heed how they make any
of that fraternity Parliament Men; let them have an eye to the godly and truly
religious (without faction) and understanding Gentlemen in the Country, that
know what really belongs to government: For consider what a deal of misery all
the Countries through the Kingdom are involved in, by reason of the Committees
that are composed of those independent Country Courtiers, who generally
domineer over the very Noblemen and Gentlemen every where, where they are in
authority, and exercise more severity over the Parliaments very friends, then
the Lords and Peers of the Kingdom, and the great Counsel do ever against
Delinquents, as all the poor Countries can testify; therefore persuade your
friends again and again, that they make choice of no Independent Country
Courtiers to he Members, for then all the Kingdom will be made Linfie-Woolsie,
for they will have all Religions, and give a greater tal^^oti^^ then the Devil
himself, for he will not tolerate all Religions, for you know he persecuted
the Woman, the true Religion, in the Wilderness, but these would tolerate all,
and therefore in that point they are worse then sat^^: Therefore if you would
avoid an inevitable confusion, persuade your friends to take heed of the
Independe^ts, who have made a combustion in Church and State already.

It is said of our Savior that he would not commit himself to (...), because
he knew them, John 2. now we have some experience already of all these men, let
us therefore take heed of them: Others you know will not commit themselves unto
men, because they know (...) not* and (...) is very good reason why they should
not; now for my part I do believe that there is no man can ever know the
Independents, and therefore they ought to shun them, for they themselves
profess, that they keep a reserve d^^es ad triarior^s redierit res, and tell
us that we put them upon too unreasonable a task, to satisfy us in all things
they do or desire: Now when we know them already by all their actions to be
disturbers of Church and State, and violaters of all the Laws of God and
humanity, and enemies of all good people, and notorious liars, and they
themselves confess unto us, that they have yet a reserve of grolleries, they
justly ought of all people to be abominated, for they profess openly, we shall
never know them: And thus much I thought fit in way of answer, to reply unto
John Lilburnes false accusation, and to speak of all the Independents practices.

One thing I may not pass by before I shut up my Discourse; Lieutenant
Colonel Lilburne complains of some affront given him by some of the
Parliament; as that they slighted him, and made themselves merry with him
(which intimatest friends usually do with their familiars) and that much
troubled his patience. What would this man have done, think you Master Vicars,
if he had been openly abused, as I was by some of the Independent party, and
favorers of their way? (...) I but wri^ for the Presbytery, and in defense of
the Parliament, and the reverend assembly of Divines, against the Independents,
who had Printed most scur^ilous Books against them all; and I was not only
roughly reproved, but threatened also, that they would complain of me to the
Parliament, for undertaking to prove the Presbytery to be jure divine; which
they told me was against the sense of the House, and therefore punishable in
me; telling me also in a very furious manner, that I was an incendiary and a
maintainer of the Kings party: and whereas they had me in their Catalogue,
intending upon occasion offered, to have preferred me; seeing, they said, I
took this way, I should never have their good word. If he bad (...) party as I
was by the Independents, and that at the Parliament door, what daggers would
not this man have writ and spoke think you? For my part, if all the
Independents in the Parliament should have spoke that which two or three of
them did, it should not have moved me so much as the biting of a Flea; much
less should it have made me (...) any thing in disgrace of the whole Council,
or in the least to have impeached their dignity: nay, had I suffered as much
for the Parliament, and from it as any man, I would not for some men's
miscarriages, or some necessitated failings, have writ any thing to the
dishonor of the whole House (and God forbid that any Presbyterian in England,
should either do such wickedness, or favor it in any.) I shall (...) or for
some (...) for offenses (...) come: and therefore I neither thought nor never
shall think the less venerably of the Parliament for the affront that was put
upon me by the Independent party; for as there (...) no Family, though never so
honest, that has not a Whore or Knave of their kindred; so it is impossible in
such a great Council as the (...) is, but they should have some ninnyes and
grols, and men that have no (...) wit then will reach from their nose to their
mouth, and are only sensible; and therefore people ought not, for a few men's
sakes, to traduce the (...) Parliament. Neither will I ever suffer it in any
whiles I live, but shall ever (...) my life defend the honor of the parliament
against all Independents, notwithstanding the failings of some Members. And
although John Lilbur^^ Master Vicars be valiant, yet in defense of my Religion
and the Church of England, and for the honor of the Parliament and great
Council, I shall not only dispute with all the Independents; though I
understand by some of that fraternity, that they have Giants for learning, as
well as Pigmyes, (...) I shall also dare in the quarrel of either fight with
John Lilburne with (...) weapon from a Bodkin to a Pike.

But leaving him to his A. B. C. which is a great deal better employment for
him then the grave and weighty matters of State, and the study of po^^^ticks,
and the great Mysteries of Divinity; and commending you and yours to his
preservation, who is the keeper of Israel, that neither slumbereth (...)
sleeps, with my earnest prayers for a happy peace in this Kingdom, (...) the
establishing of the true protestant Religion, and of the Parliament; I remain

Yours, JOHN BASTWICK.

FINIS.
