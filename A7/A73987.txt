A License for a Collection throughout England and Wales, toward the
maintenance of the Exiled Ministers of the Palatinate.
CHARLES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
defender of the faith, etc.
To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting.
WHEREAS We have heretofore received certain Information, as well by the
Ministers and Elders of Dutch Churches, both in the parts beyond the Seas, and
in Our City of London, as by the special and earnest recommendation of Our
dearest Sister, and her Royal Consort, Our dear Brother the Prince Elector
Palatine, of the most distressed and lamentable estate of the poor exiled
Ministers of the Palatinate, their Wives and Children, who falling into the
power of their cruel enemies, have been spoiled of all their Temporal estates,
and exposed unto inexpressible miseries, and are now enforced, as Exiles, to
retire and hide themselves from the violence of their adversaries, in several
Cities, Towns, and other places, where they live in very great penury and want,
most of them having formerly had plentiful and liberal means to sustain
their own charge, and to be helpefull to others, whose cases are the more to
be deplored, for that this extremity is fallen upon them for their sincerity
and constancy in the true Religion, which We, together with them, do profess,
and which We are all bound in conscience to maintain to the uttermost of Our
powers. Whereas these religious and godly presons, being inuolued amongst many
others their Country men in that common calamity, might have enjoyed their
estates and fortunes, if with other backsliders, in the times of trial, they
would have submitted themselves to the Antichristian yoke, and have renounced
or dissembled the profession of the true Religion: WE taking these things into
Our Princely consideration, and being moved with the bowels of compassion
toward them, as feeling members of the same body, whereof Christ alone is the
head, and being certainly informed, that those of the United Provinces, and
diverse other Protestants in other places, have bountifully contributed toward
their necessities, and being well assured, that all Our loving Subjects of this
Our Kingdom, who have long enjoyed the freedom of the Gospel, and have tasted
largely of the comfort thereof, will not be inferior to any, in a work so
full of piety and charity toward their distressed brethren, did heretofore by
Our Letters Patents of the nine and twentieth of January, in the third year
of Our Reign, commend the distressed estates of these poor souls unto the
charities of all the people of this Our Realm. Bur Our gracious intention not
having yet taken so good effect for the relief of those distressed souls as
We expected, We have now resolved to continue the same for a longer time.
KNOW ye therefore, That We, of Our Princely grace, do order and grant,
that a general Collection be made of the charitable devotions, and
liberalities of all Our loving Subjects throughout this Our Realm of England,
and Dominion of Wales, in all places whatsoever, as well within Liberties as
without, toward the relief and succor of the said poor Exiles, living now
dispersed and distressed in such sort, as aforesaid: which Collection We will
and command, shall be made and ordered in manner and form following: That is
to say, We first will and grant, that by the discretion of the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, Our own Printer at Our own charge, shall forth with
print so many Briefes of these our Letters Patents, as shall be sufficient to
disperse them into every Church and Chapel, where public and Divine service
is usually celebrated, in, and throughout this Our whole Kingdom and Dominion:
And that the Letters Patents themselves under Our great Seal, be left with
the Archbishop of Canterbury; and that the Archbishops of Canterbury and York
do receive all these Briefes from Our Printer, and shall with all speed send
so many of them unto every Bishop within this Realm and Dominion, as shall be
requisite for every Church and Chapel within their several Diocesses to have
one of them: that every Bishop in every Diocese do disperse them into every
Parish Church and Chapel, to be delivered to the Minister of that place: that
the Minister and Curate in every Church and Chapel receive them, and in the
time of Divine Service on some Sunday publish them, with an exhortation to the
people for the stirring up of their Christian devotion to a work so full of
charity: that the Churchwardens and Overseers of the poor make diligent
Collections of all the Parishioners, at their dwelling houses: that after the
money shall be collected, the sum collected be endorsed on the back of the
Brief, and that it be publicly declared unto the Congregation what the sum
does amount unto, which is there collected: that every Bishop do nominate in
every Deanery within his Diocese, one able and fit Minister to be Receiver of
all the money collected within that Deanery, to whom the Church wardens and
Overseers of every Parish being within that Deanery, shall within three days
after the Collection, pay over the money collected, and deliver the Brief
endorsed, receiving from him a Note under his hand of the sum so paid: that
every such Minister within six days after the receipt of the moneys within
that Deanery, pay the same over to the Lord Bishop of the Diocese, or his
Official: that the Bishop of the Diocese deliver or pay the same over to the
hands of the Archbishop of the Province, within fourteen days after: that
the said Archbishops, as they shall receive any sum of one hundred pounds, or
above, do forthwith send and deliver the same to the Ministers and Elders of
the Dutch Congregation in London, at their meeting in their Consistory, and
receive from them a Note in writing, under the hands of four of them at the
least; that the Ministers and Elders of the Dutch Congregation in London, on
whose fidelities and honesties in this behalf We will trust, do with all
convenient speed send, or by exchange make over the same into the parts beyond
the Seas, and divide and distribute the same unto, and amongst those poor
distressed souls for their relief and sustenance, in such manner as for their
cares, faithfulness and discretions, they will be answerable unto Us for the
same. And to that end, that they keep a perfect account in writing of all
their receipts, paiments, and distributions of the said moneys, to be showed
unto Us, whenever, for Our satisfaction We shall call for the same. In
witness whereof We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patents for the
space of two years now next ensuing the date hereof to continue. Witness Our
Self at Canbury, the nineteenth day of August, in the sixth year of Our
Reign.

God save the King.
Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: and by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. M.DC.XXX.
