The Passionate Lover.
To the Tune of I Loved thee once I Will love no more.


AS I sat in a pleasant shade,
under the arch of a thick Grove,
Where Nature had an Arbor made,
I did begin to think of Love;
Me thought it was a peevish toy,
Because Loves God was but a Boy,
and deeply vowed that in my breast
such braineles phrensies should not rest.
As I thus thought, there passed by
one seemd a Goddess, yet a Creature,
Who did transpire me with her eye,
and wound me with her heavenly feature:
Wy heart she did so deeply wound,
That I fell senceles to the ground,
and was of senses quite bereaud,
till with her hand I up was heaud.
But her soft hand, diuiner touch
was cause of greater misery,
The virtue of her hand was such,
that it pierst deeper then her eye,
Her fingers are those veuomd darts
By which she pierces tender hearts:
her eyes be shafts, and if she aim
she does the mark or kill, or mayme.
I gazd so long upon her eyes,
that I was taken in a snare,
And made her captive, and her prize,
bound in the tresses of her hair:
As I upon her beauty gaze,
My erring thoughts are in a maze,
whereas they wander round about,
(...) can^^t find a passage out.
I thought she was the sovereign cure
to salve this heart sick malady,
Because she did the wound procure,
I thought she would be remedy:
But she unkind denied releife,
Like a bad Surgeon lancht my grief,
and left it not as it was before,
but cared less, and wounded more,
The more I looked, the worse my heart.
the more I grieve, the less she cares,
The more she smiles, the worse my smart,
and she does laugh when I shed tears:
This is not Balsame for my sore,
It helps it less, and pains it more,
and she may know if she be wise
I cannot be curde by contraries.
Beauty is like a blasing light,
that simple fools do flock unto,
Like silly Flies to that by night.
till they themselves do quite undo,
For while they dally with the Torch,
They presently themselves do scorch,
then soon they fall, as soon they dye,
oh that I were not such a Fly.
I thought in Love were only joy,
continual truce, and never war,
But now I see naught but annoy,
fears and dispaires the ofspringer:
Sow Men perchance do Hunny find,
If that they meet with one that is kind,
but I have found that in this Be
there is no sweet, but sting for me.
The Second Part.
To the same Tune.




SHe was the white at which I shot.
but aiming wide I could not hit her
Scorns and disdaines was all I got,
she was to coy, I could not get her:
But as for her, she shot so right
That none her arrows hinder might,
She is so skillful and so quick.
That if she shoots she hits the prick,
Unhappy I that face to view
whose every look shootes death at me,
Whose every glance does greiue renew,
and add degrees to misery:
Then let those eyes in darkness languish,
that were my Conduit's to this anguish,
And let the Curtains of sad night,
Debar them of the joy of light.
O thrice unhappy I to go,
unto the grove where she was seen,
It was the cause of all my woe:
I wish that there I bad not been,
Then let my legs wax dry and wither,
that were my porters brought me hither
And let them fall and broken lie,
like pillars by times injury
When that I heard the fatal voice,
that she pronounced against my bliss:
My heart for very anguish stird,
and ready was pale death to kiss,
If her least word can do such wrong:
why was she borne with such a tongue,
And I* to heavens will put this suite,
that I were deaf or she were mute,
Why should dame nature make such faces,
and so adorn these heavenly creatures:
When they do want those milder graces,
That do add grace unto their features
Like to the Sirens they allure:
that no man can their Charms endure,
And in the looks where grace should ly:
sharp frowns sits in and puts grace by
I thought in that soft Satin skin,
which being touched does seem to melt,
And in that breast which tempts to linne:
and ravish men when it is fealt,
There had not been so hard a heart;
since softnes was in every part,
Oh why should Nature make a Jewel,
to be so Lovely and so Cruel:
The burning fever of fond love,
has now corrupted every part:
My legs too weak can hardly move;
and love has festered to my heart,
My sinews shrirke my hart-strings ache,
My pulses leap my joints do shake:
And every limb and every sense,
is plagued for my eyes offense.
Then let my soul post hence away,
And with swift flight from me be gone,
Why should it with me longer stay:
in such a rotten mansion;
O Let it take the last farewell,
in such a house no longer dwell,
While I for grife would farther speak,
my soul flies out my heart strings brek
