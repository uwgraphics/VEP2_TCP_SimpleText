To the Christian Reader.
I Can not but earnestly lament (good christan Reader) as I hope thou do with
me, these miserable times wherein we live behoulding the great number, already
grown and daily increasing, of wicked atheists, superstitious papists,
profane wordlings, carnal gospellers, vain and idle professors and great
multitudes of ignorant people even in the principles of religion in this land.
Notwithstanding the gospel has been so long and plentifully preached amongst
us, so many godly books published, both of the interpretation of scriptures and
also of other learned and holy treatises by sundry worthy men, so many
excellent and profitable catechismes, set forth and fitted for teaching the
grounds of religion to all sorts of people. So as we may justly weep over
cities, towns, and villages as the Lord Jesus did over Jerusalem. Luc. 19.42.
Oh that you had known even in this your day those things that belong unto your
peace. But now are they hid from your eyes; for ah alas who sees not, almost
in all places, the mighty sins of the land, crying for vengance: That that
may justly be pronounced unto us which the prophet denounces to Israel. Hosea.
4.1.
Hear the word of the lord O people of England. The lord has a controversy
with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, no mercy, no
knowledge of God in the land, by swearing and lying and stealing and killing
and whoring they break out, and blood touches blood. Wherefore it is greatly
to be feared that seeing wisdom has cried unto us so long, Pro. 1.20.25.26.
etc.
and uttered her words so loud abroad in the streets, in the assemblies, in
cities and towns, and all sorts have refused, none would regard her calling,
least she also laugh at our destruction, and mock when our fear comes like
a sudden desolation, and our destruction like a whirlewind and a tempest, to
sweep us away headlong into the gulf of all miseries and calamities. The Lord
in mercy raise us up out of our deadly sleep of sins and security that we
may awake to live righteously and sin no longer. Many of us have in our
mouths, vainly boasting as the people of Israel, Ier. 7.4.
the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, we have the temple of the
lord, so we the gospel of Christ, the gospel of Christ, we have the gospel of
Christ, but ah alas many thousands of us know nothing what the gospel
means. A multitude of people throughout the land have not yet learned the
very beginnings of the doctrines of Christ, of repentance from dead works: of
faith toward God, of baptism, of laying on of hands, of the resurrection from
the dead, and of eternal judgment, nay not so much as what sin is, or how
they becam sinners, what the punishment of sin is, or how they may escape it.
Many thousands know nothing what sins are forbidden, what duties are required
in any of the commandments, they understand not any article of the faith
aright, any petition of the Lords prayer, the meaning of the sacraments, or any
thing that belongs to a christian life. O that we would learn in time to
repent and turn unto the lord, Ier. 4.4.
before his wrath break forth upon us like fire, and burn that none can
quench it, for the wickedness of our inventions. Even this were one good means
if all parents and householders would set apart some hour every day to pray
with their children and servants, and use some for catechism to inform
themselves, and their family in the grounds, and principles of religion, Deuteronomy.
6.6.7.8. and 11.18.19. Ephesians. 6.4. Genes. 18.19. Iosu. 24.15. Act. 10.21
as they are bound in duty by the commandments of the Lord and taught by the
example of Godly fathers and howseholders in the scriptures, namely Abraham,
Joshua and noble Cornelius. So should themselves, their children and their
servants be better prepared and fitted to understand the word of God and the
doctrines thereof delivered unto them by their godly pastors and ministers,
which now they hear most unprofitably, and after much and long teaching learn
nothing at all. Among other catechismes I have found by long experience this
one to be of very fit and profitable use, for the instruction of a family,
being plain and easy and not longer then may every seven days be repeated
through, being fitly divided. For the questions concerning fasting and
government may be omitted, except there be special occasion, this may be
done and prayer joined withal in little more then half an hour at one time. I
confess some good part of this was published many years since, gathered out
of another cathechisme by a godly and reverent preacher M. Moore of Norwich,
which I have altered and enlarged in many places with such questions and
answers as I thought meet for the instruction of the simple and unlearned,
unto which I have added certain prayers for the help of such as are not yet
able to conceive a prayer of themselves. I wish thee (good Reader) whosoever
wilt use it, to examine with the doctrines the places of scripture quoted, some
of them at the least though not all: otherwise thou shall deprive thy self of
a great benefit and comfort.

This poor mite amid my ordinary labors at the request of some friends, I
have cast into the Lords treasury, If thou profitt by it remember me in thy
prayers. And so I commend thee to god and to the word of his grace, who is able
to build further, and to give thee an inheritance among them which are
sanctified.

And the Lord give thee understanding to grow in grace and in the sound
knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom with the father and
the holy Ghost be ascribed all glory and praise power, majesty and dominion
now henceforth and for evermore.

Thy poor loving brother in Christ, James Leech.

Question.
What ought every man first and cheifely to labor for all the days of his
life?

An. The kingdom of God and his righteousness and to be assured that his name
is wrtten in heaven. Math. 6.33. Luc. 10.20. Ihon. 6.27. Reuela. 3.5. and 20.15.

Q. Why so?

An. For hereby we are made partakers of everlasting blessedness which is the
fulness of joy and fruition of glory, otherwise men are more miserable then the
vilest creatures of the earth, for we are else condemned wretches unto
everlasting death and damnation in hell fire.

Q. May not men be perfectly blessed by enjoying the things of this life?

An. No, Eccles. 1.4. Luke 9.24. 2 Philip. 3.8.
for all things under the sun are but vanity and vexation of spirit, and
what shall it profit a man if he win the whole world and loose his soul.
Math. 16.26.

Q. How may we then be perfectly blessed?

An. In the attaining of everlasting life. Mat. 19.29. 2. Cor. 5.1, 2, 3, 4.

Q. What mean you by eternal life?

An. That life which all they whose names are written in heaven shall possess
with all fulness of joy and unspeakable glory in the kingdom of God for uer
and ever. Revel. 21.3.4.24.27. and 22.5. Mat. 25.34.

Q. How may we attain to that eternal life?

^oh. 17.3. Romans 7.7.9. etc.
An. By the true knowledge of the only true God; and whom he has sent Jesus
Christ and also by the knowledge of our selves.

Q. Where is this knowledge to be learned?

An. In the written word of God which we call the holy canonical scriptures.
Ioh. 5.39. 2. Tim. 3.16.17. Romans 15.4.

Q. What mean you by the canonical scriptures?

Luc. 24.27. Ephesians. 2.20.
An. All those things which are written in the books of the old and new
testament. 2. Pet. 1.19. and 3.2.

Q. Why be they called canonical?

An. First because they differ from other writings called Apocrypha.

Secondly, because they are the rule of Gods will containing all things which
we ought to believe and do, for this word Canon signifies a rule. Gal. 6.16.

Q. How must we use the scriptures that we may learn to know God and our
selves?

An. We must search them. John. 5.39. Act. 17.11.

Q. How must we search them?

An. By diligent and reverent reading of them 1. Tim. 4.13.
by diligent and reverent hearing of the word of God Romans 10.17.
preached Psalm. 1.2.
By diligent and careful meditation of that which we have read and heard and
by earnest and hearty prayer that God would open our understanding. Ephesians.
1.17. Luc. 24.45. James. 1.5.

Q. What must we know in our selves?

An. Who and what we are.

Q. Who and what are we?

An. The children of Adam and Eve. Genesis 5.3. Romans 5.14.18.

Q. Who was that Adam and Eve?

An. The first man and woman that ever were upon the earth; the most excellent
and principal creatures of god upon the earth, the father and mother of all
mankind. Genesis 1.27. Genesis 2.7. Genesis 2.21.23.

Q. Wherein stood this excellency of man and woman?

An. In that they consisting of sensible bodies although created of the dust of
the earth Genesis 2.7.
they had also understanding souls, and were made according to the image Genesis
1.27. Collos. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.
of God in perfect holiness and righteousness to serve God according to his will;
and were also placed at the first in paradise Genesis 2.8.15.
and had dominion over all the creatures of the earth, the fishes of the sea,
and the fowls of the air. Genesis 1.28.

Q. Did man and woman continue in this happy place and excellent estate?

An. No, they were quickly thrown out from thence for their sin and
transgression through the subtlety and malice of Satan, Genesis 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6.23.24. 2. Cor. 11.3.
rebelling against god their creator, and so cursed and condemned to eternal
death and damnation both of soul and body, in which estate they had remained
and all their posterity for ever, if God of his free mercy had not provided a
wonderful way of deliverance. Genesis 3.15.

Q. Art thou then such a one as Adam and Eve were?

An. Yea surely, and not only I, Genesis 5.5. Romans 3.10.11.12.23. Romans 5.12.14.18.
but also all the children of Adam and Eve (only Christ Jesus excepted) (that
is to say) all men weomen and children which ever have bin, are, or shall be
borne into the world since Adam the first man unto the last, are even such as
Adam and Eve were after they were cast out of paradise, (that is to say)
wretched sinners, corrupted in nature, cursed and condemned creatures before
the judgment seat of God, except we can find that remedy which God of his
free mercy has provided for us.

Q. What is that remedy or what have we to answer before the judgment seat of
God that we should not be condemned for ever?

Ioh. 3.17.36.
An. This is our only remedy and it is the full satisfaction of gods wrath and
our deliverance from condemnation to believe that Jesus Christ the son of God
has vouchsafed to become man for us, and has so pacified gods wrath due unto
us, 2. Cor. 5.21. Rom 4.25. Romans 5.8. 1. Cor. 15.21.22.
by his death and bloodshedding upon the Cross and has purchased for us the
favor of God and everlasting life.

Q. What had become of thee if Christ had not thus died for thee?

An. I had bin condemned to eternal death and damnation both of soul and
body in hell fire with the devil and his angels for ever. John 3.36.

Q. What shall become of thee now seeing Christ has died for thee?

An. If I believe faithfully in Jesus Christ that he has paid the full price
of my redemption and is become my savior then am I justified both in soul and
body, Ioh. 5.24. Ion. 17.2.24. Romans 8.29.30. 2. Cor. 3.18.
and shall after this life ended be glorified both in soul and body with
everlasting life in the kingdom of heaven to live in everlasting joy and
blessedness with Christ and his angels for ever.

Q. What does God require at thy hands for these his great mercies toward thee?

An. That I should seek to glorify him.

An. In words and deeds Romans 6.13 Romans 5.29.30. Romans 3.12.13.1^ 15.

Q. Are all the actions of all me^ finne?

An. There are natural actions in all ^en which of themselves be not sin ^ut
as they proceed from our corrup^^d nature they are made sinful. To. ^ 18.
Job. 14.4.

Q. Does no man then any thing ^ut sin in all his actions?

An. The natural man does nothing ^ut sin in all his actions. Romans 8.6.7.
Psalm. 14.3.1. Cor. 2.14 Romans 7.18.
^ Pro 15.8.9.26.

Q. what mean you by the natural ^an?

An. He whose heart and conscience (...) not renewed, 1. John. 3.10. Romans 12.2.
purged and sanctified ^y the spirit of grace, through faith and ^^pentance in
Jesus Christ. Act. 15.9. ^ Cor. 1.2. Romans 8.9.

Q. Is there any man that does not ^^nne in his actions?

An. The Regenerated man does not ^ommit sin, 1. Ioh. 3.3.6.9.
because he is led by the ^^irit of God. Romans 8.11. Ephesians. 4.20. ^1, 22, 23, 24.
Gala. 2.20.

Q. Is there no sin in the actions ^f a regenerated man?

An. Yes; Ies. 64.6. 1. Cor. 13.9.12.
for all our righteousness is ^s a stained clout, and there is no perfection in
this life.

Q. Why say you then that the ^^generate man does not commit sinn^

An. He is not said to commit sinn^ because it is not he that sins, Romans
7.15.17.20.
b^ sin that dwells in him.

Q. What is the punishment of sin^^

An. The curse of God. Deuteronomy. 27.2^ Gal. 3.10.

Q. What mean you by that?

Deu. 28.15. etc. Mat. 25.41. Romans 6.23. Ies. 66.24. Mark. 9.43.44.
An. It is an eternal separation from the favor of God and all his merci^
which has adjoined unto it all mis^ries and calamities of this life, death
(...) the end, and eternal torments both (...) soul and body in hell ever
after. Man 5.29. Math. 22.13. Revel. 20.1^ 14.

Q. Is there nothing which a man may do to serve as a sufficient recompense to
God for one sin?

An. No, although I should give Luke. 17.10.
all my goods to the poor, or suffe^ my body to be (b) whipped all my li^
long, Col. 2.23.
or suffer any other punishme^^ which might be devised, yet it were no^
sufficient for one of my least sins.

Q. Why so?

An. For sin is infinite, because it offends the infinite majesty, and
therefore deserves an infinite punishment. Psalm 51.4.

Q. Yea but God 1. Cor. 1.3. Psalm. 18.45. and 86.15.
is merciful will he therefore punish sin so sharply?

An. Our God indeed is merciful but he is also Psalm. 7.9. Psalm. 11.5. Romans
3.4. Ioh. 3.33.
just and true, and therefore of his justice and truth he must needs punish
man's sin with that punishment which he has appointed.

Q. Seeing then this punishment must needs be suffered, are we in our selves
able to suffer and overcome it?

An. None is able to suffer Psalm. 130.3. Math. 19.25.
and overcome this great punishment of sin being only man.

Q. What learn you out of this?

An. That my state is most miserable in respect of the greatness of my sin and
the horrible punishment due unto the same. Romans 7.24.

Q. What profit is it to you to know this your miserable estate?

An. First I am taught thereby to know mine own unworthiness, and that I
should not seek to be saved by mine own works or merits Deuteronomy. 7.7. Deuteronomy. 9.6.
Dan. 9.18.
Secondly to bewail this my miserable estate with a godly sorrow Romans 7.24. 1.
Cor. 7.9.10.
Thirdly to detest and abhor sin because it brings nothing with it but
the curse of God Romans 6.21.23.
Fourthly to call heartely upon God, and sue for his grace, that I may find and
apprehend the riches of his mercy for my redemption Ephesians. 1.17. and 3.16.17.
and 4.1.2.


Q. Is there any means whereby we may be delivered from this miserable estate?

A. Yes: there is a means which is taught unto us in the 3. of John. For God
so loved the world, John. 3.16.
that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believed in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life.

Q. What learn you out of this?

A. That whereas the pains which our sins deserve must needs be suffered by
man, because God of his justice must needs punish sin in man, which was
committed by man: therefore our Savior Christ being everlasting god, became
also Gal. 4.4. Heb. 2.9.10.14.15.16.17. Heb, 4.15. 1 Timothy 2.5. Romans 8.3.4.
man, and has fully Gal. 3.13. Romans 4.25. Ioh. 1.29. 2. Cor. 5.21. Esaias 53.6.
Romans 8.3. 1. John. 3.16.18.36.
suffered whatsoever was due for man's sin in his own person.

Q. Are all people discharged, seeing the punishment is paid?

A. None are discharged saving those that took Col. 2.2. 1 John. 3.2. Ephesians.
3.12. Romans 8.38.39. Ephesians. 1.18. Ephesians. 2.8. Acts. 15.11
hold upon Christ and his merits by a true faith.

Q. What call you this true faith?

A. It is a special work of Gods spirit in our hearts, whereby we believe to
be saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Q. What do you see by this true faith?

A. My sins both to be forgiven me, and yet fully punished.

Q. How can that be?

A. For in Jesus Christ to 2 Cor. 5.21. Romans 3.25.
satisfy Gods justice they be 1. Ioh. 2.1.12. Gala. 3 13. Romans 4.25.
fully punished, and yet to me they be 1. Cor. 5.9.
forgiven, because in me they be not punished, but in Christ for me to set
forth Gods mercy: and therefore they shall never be laid to my charge: in this
manner therefore I see the Lord my God to be both merciful and just.

Q. Yea but although the punishment of thy sins be fully discharged in
Christ, yet seeing there can no unrighteousness dwell with God, how can thou
stand before the judgment seat of God as just and righteous, seeing thou have
no righteousness but that which is stained with many sins?

A. I stand as just and righteous before the throne of God, not clothed with
my own righteousness, but with the 1. Cor. 1.30. 2. Cor. 5.21. Romans 3.28.
righteousness of Jesus Christ, which righteousness being taken hold upon
Ephesians. 3.17. Romans 3.28. Ioh. 3.18.
by a true faith, is made mine: thus am I just and righteous in the sight of
God, not in respect of my own works which I wrought in my own person, but by
taking hold upon Christ's works to be mine by faith.

Q. Does not this doctrine make men careless, and so run into all sin and
wickedness?

A. No: for this true faith as soon as it is wrought in us Ioh. 3.3.5. Ephesians.
4.20. Colos. 3.9. Romans 6.6. and 12.1.2.
through the holy Ghost, does frame our hearts anew, and causes us to Romans
7.23.
detest, hate, loath, and abhor sin in all men, but especially in our
selves, and makes us to have our Romans 5.12.11.
whole delight, joy, and comfort in those things which be agreeable to Gods
will, and causes us also to Romans 6.11.1.13. Mat. 7.17. Ioh. 15.5.
express the same in our godly living and conversation, or else it is no true
faith but a Iam. 2.17. Iam. 2.17.20. Ioh. 15.6. Psalm. 92.12.13. Ioh 15.5. Math.
7.17.18 etc. Gala. 5.6.
dead faith.

Q. What difference is between a dead faith, and a true faith?

A. A dead faith is like a barren and withered tree that brings forth no
fruit: a true faith is like a living and fruitful tree that ever brings
forth good fruit to the glory of God.

Q. What be the fruits of a true faith?

A. A continual and true repentance, and every good grace of Gods spirit, and
all the good works which he has ordained for us that we should walk in them.
Ephesians. 2.10. 2. Pet. 1.5.9.11.12. Ephesians. 415.

Q. What mean you by repentance? Gal. 6.15. 2. Cor. 7.1. R^^ 12.1. 2 Ephesians.
4.20.21.22. etc. 1. Pet. 1.13. ^^ 15.1. Pet. 2.1.11.12.


A. That change and renewing of the whole man that brings forth a new,
Christian, and holy life and conversation, growing and increasing more and more.

Q. How many things be required in true repentance?

A. Two: the mortifying and subduing of sin, and the living and growing in
the practice of true godliness and righteousness: 2. Cor. 7.1. both which do
proceed from the virtue of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, ^om.
6.2.3.4.5.^1.12. ^m. 12.1.2. ^l. 3.1.2.5.9. ^1. Pet. 1.2.^.23. Gal. 6.^ 15.16.
into whom we are ingrafted by faith.

Q. Seeing then we be saved by Christ's works, without our deseruings, whereto
serve our wel-doings, or what avails it to do good works?

A. We must do good works, not to deserve Esaias. 46.6. ^b. 35.7. ^al. 17.2.
^ik. 17.10.
salvation by them; but by our works to ^at. 5.16. ^or. 6.20. ^t. 2.12. ^ol.
1.10. ^l. 1.27. and 2.
glorify God in These. 2.12. ^h. 4. and 4.1.
walking as becomes Gods children Romans 6.11, ^3. and 12.1.2.
, declaring thereby our thankfulness to God for our redemption. Secondly, by our
works to make our ^. Pet. 1.10.
election more certain to our selves. Thirdly, to Pet. 3.1.2. ^m. 14.29.
win others to Christ by our holy life and conversation.

Q. What works call thou good works?

An. Our work can never be acceptable and good in the sight of God unless in
doing of them we keep these two things; first that Ephesians. 2.10. Collos.
2.10.22.23. Esaias 9.13. Mat. 15.9. Romans 14.23. Heb. 11.6. 1. Cor. 5.7.
they be framed according to the will of Gods laws and commandments and not
after our own devises.

Secondly that they proceed from an heart purged by fairh; if either of these
points be lacking our works are abominable in the sight of God although they
appear never so glorious in the eyes of men.

Q. What things ought every one to believe which has this true faith in Jesus
Christ with out the which none can be saved? 4. part.


An. All those things which are contained in the articles of our christian
faith.

Q Rehearse the articles of our christian faith

A. I believe in God the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and in
Jesus Christ his only son our Lord which was conceived by the holy ghost
borne of the virgin Marie suffered under Pontius Pilat was crucified dead and
buried he decended into hell the third day he rose agane and ascended into
heaven and there he sits at the right hand of God the father Almighty, from
thence he shall come to judge both the quick and the dead. I believe in the
holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness
of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

Q. What ought we to believe concerning God in his nature or essence?

A. First, that he is one infinite, invisible, and eternal spirit, of
unsearchable majesty, most holy, mighty, wise, just, and merciful (a).
Secondly, (b) that the self same God, being one in essence has made himself

Ghost. Romans 11.34.35, 36. Rom 9.11.22, 23.
Deuteronomy. 6.4. Ies. 43.11. and 44.8. and 46.5. and 46.5. Ies. 57.15. and 66.1. 2.
Ioh. 4.24. Ioh. 1.18. 1. Tim. 1.17. Romans 9.33. Exodus 34.6, 7. Psalm. 103.8, 9,
10, 11. Psalm. 33.6. Genesis 1.31. Ie^ 10.10.11.12.16. Col. 1.16.
Matthew. 3.16, 17 and 28.19.

Q. What ought we to believe concerning God in his actions?

A. First, Romans 11.34.35, 36. Rom 9.11.22, 23.
that he has decreed and ordained all things in his eternal purpose and
counsel before all worlds. Secondly, that by his Almighty power he has made
the heavens and the earth, and all the creatures therein. Thirdly, Mat.
10.39.30. Psalm. 115.3. and 135.6. Psalm. 145 17.
that he does rule and govern them and all their actions according to the good
purpose of his own will most holily, righteously, and wisely.

Q. Why is God called Almighty?

A. Because he is of all-sufficient power in himself to work all things
according to the good purpose of his own will, Ies. 42.8. and 4^ 13 and
44.24.2^ and 49.7. Mat. ^ 29.30.
so as nothing can be done in heaven, earth, or hell, without his providence.
Act. 4.28.

Q. Why do you call God father?

A. First, in respect of creation. Secondly, in respect of adoption.

Q. Why in respect of creation?

Romans 11.38. Acts. 17.25.38.
A. Because of him, from him, and by him all things have their being and
beginning.

Q. Why in respect of adoption?

Ephesians. 1.5. Gal. 4.5.6.
A. Because he has adopted those whom he has chosen to be his children in
Jesus Christ.

A. I learn thereby that he loves me, and has a most tender care over me.
Psalm. 103.13. Romans 5.5.8.

Q. What comfort have you in this that God whom you call father is Almighty?

A. I learn thereby that he can and will defend me from all evil, so as

Q. What duty do you learn here concerning your self?

An. That I should honor him as my heavenly father. Malech. 1.6.


Q. How?

An. In loving him, fearing him, reuerencing him, and obeying him the sixth
commandment.

Qu. Wherein must we show forth this?

An. In the care that I have to keep his commandments.

Q. Wherein stands the keeping of the commandments?

An. In doing those good things which the lord has commanded; and in leaving
undone those evil things which the lord has forbidden.

Q. What beleeuest thou in the second part concerning god the son?

An. I believe that Jesus Christ one Romans 9.5. John 1.1. Ioh. 14.10.
God in subtance with the father and the holy ghost Romans 1.3. Mat. 1.20.2.
took flesh of the virgin Marie and is become perfect man as I am in all
things, Heb. 2.14.15. Romans 8.3.
sin only excepted Heb. 2.14.15. Romans 8.3.
and in my nature has wrought whatsoever was needful for my salvation.

Q. What meanest thou when thou say he suffered under Pontius Pilate

An. Because that manner of death which men do suffer by the sentence of the
judge and under the title of justice, is more shameful, slanderous and
terrible, then if a man should die naturally in his bed: Therefore our savior
Christ took upon him our person to show himself Psalm 2.2. Acts. 4.27
before an earthly judge and to be Mat. 27.16. Ioh. 19.1.13.23.
condemned by the mouth of Pilate he being then Judge, that thereby we might
be cleared before the judgment seat of God.

Q. What meanest thou when thou say Christ was crucified dead and buried?

An. First I mean in that he was crucified that he suffered Luke 23.33.
the death of the Cross which was an abominable and cursed death Gal. 3.13.14.
to deliver me from the curse which was due for my sins. Secondly for as much
as death was a punishment due to man for sin; therefore our Savior Christ ^d
suffer death and by suffering ouer^^me death; for in his death did lie (...)
principal point of our salvation; ^r if he had not bin truly Esaias. 53.12. Romans
5.8. 1. Cor. 15.3. 1. Pet. 2.24.
dead we ^d bin yet subject to eternal death ^d damnation. Thirdly he was
buried ^r the greater assurance and confirma^on of his death, and resurrection,
and (...) the intent to make it more certainly ^owne unto us, it pleased him
also to ^e buried after the common manner of men, and that by two Notable
persons Mat. 27.57. Mar. 15.43. Luke 23.53.
Nicodemus and Joseph of Ara^athia, which was also done by the will and
consent of Pilate who caused the body to be delivered unto them.

Q. What meanest thou concerning that Christ descended into hell?

An. Where it is said that Christ descended into hell thereby I believe that
Christ did not only suffer in his body the punishment due to my body, Esaias.
53.4.8.10.
but also in his soul the punishment due to my soul, Luke 2^.44.
which was the torments of hell, Luke 23.46. Math 27.46.
second death Act. 2.24. Math. 26.38.
sorrows of death, abiection from god as it does appear by the anguish of
(...) soul in the garden Luke 22.44.
when drops blood issued out of his body and a^^ upon the cross Luke 23.46.
Math. 27.46.
by his lamentab^ cry unto his father for in a miserab^ case had we bin in if
he had only su^fered the punishment due to our body and not to our souls.

Q. What fruit have thou by the death of Christ?

An First I believe that this dea^ and punishment which Christ suffere^ is the
whole appeasing of Heb. 9.12.13.14.28. 1. Pet. 2.24. 1. Ioh. 2.1.
go^ wrath and a full satisfaction to god f^^ all my sins.

Secondly that Gala. 5.24. Gala. 2.29.7.8.^1.
as he is dead f^^ sin so he will cause sin to die i^ my mortal body.

Q. What profitt have thou by the rising again of Christ?

An. First I am assured by this risin^ that he has 1. Cor. 15.55.56.57. Romans
8.33.34. Romans 4.15.
overcome death hell, sin and finished my justification* Secondly that as he
is risen from death so he causes me as a member of hi^ Romans 6.4. Colos. 3.1.2.
to rise from sin and delight i^ righteousness. Thirdly his rising again^ ^a
sure pledge 1. Cor. 15.16.^0.
to me that my body shall in like manner rise again.

Q. What is the meaning of this ^at Christ ascended into heaven?

An. Christ as touching his man^ood is Act. 1.11. Act. 3.21.
only in heaven: but Mat. 28.20.
as ^ouching his godhead and comfort of ^is holy spirit he is with us to the
end ^f the world.

Q. What good gettest thou by the ^scending of Christ into heaven?

An. First Christ his ascending into ^eauen is a sure pledge unto me that Ioh.
14.3. Phil. 3.21. 1. Cor. 1.7. 1. These. 4.16.17.
^ shall in like manner as a member of ^y his power be received into heaven
(...) the same nature wherein he is ascen^ed. Secondly Christ having ascended
unto heaven 1. Ioh. 1.2. Heb. 9.12. Romans 8.32.
makes continual inter^ession for me.

Q. What mean you by this that Christ sits at the right hand of the father?

An. Christ sits at the right hand of the father, that is, he has Mat.
28.18. Ephesians. 1.20.21.22.
all power given him of the father over all things, being exalted into the full
power of his kingdom and preisthood and made the only head of his Church.

Q. What fruit do thou receiue^ this that Christ shall come to iudge^ quick
and the dead?

An. To me that am a member (...) Christ it is singular comfort Mat 24.31. Mat.
25.34. Mat. 19.28. 2. These. 1.10.
when do know assuredly that none shall (...) my judge but he that is my
Savior; b^ terrible will it be to those that flee from Christ 2. These.
1.4.7.8. Luke 21.25. Mat. 15.41.
when they shall see him com^ to judge them whom they in their li^^ time have
refused.

Q. What beleeuest thou in the thi^ part concerning God the holy Ghos^

An. I believe that God the hol^ Ghost the third person in the godhead, equal
God with the father and the son, finisheth and maket^ perfect all the works
of God, and Romans 8.9.10.11.15.16. Gala. 4.6.
seals into my heart all Christ's benefits to be mine, and Ephesians. 1.17. Ephesians.
4.23. Psalm. 1.3. Col. 2.11.12.13.
maket^ sin to die in me and stirs me up to holiness and righteousness of
life.

Q. What call you the chatholike Church?

An. The chatholike Church is the Romans 8 20. Ephesians. 1.10.11.12.13. Mat. 16.21.
Ioh. 10.26.
whole company of faithful people which ever were since the beginning of the
world in all places, which also be ^ow and shall be to the end of the world, of
the which number I believe that 1. Ioh. 3.21. 2. Cor. 13.5. Romans 8.16.
I am one, I believe that God 2. Tim. 2.19. 1. Pet 5.7. Esaias 49.15. Mat.
10.29.30.31.
knows them all and has a most tender care over them.

Q What call thou the communion of Saints?

An. The communion of Saints is that society that all we which believe have
one with another as 1. Cor. 12 12.13.14. etc. 5.30. Col. 1.18. Romans 1.12.5.
members of one head Jesus Christ. Whereby we are 2. Cor. 11.28. Gala. 6.2.
Phil. 2.1.23.4.
ready to communicate all gods benefits both spiritual and temporal to the
mutual help and comfort one of another according to the measure which we have
received of God in this life.

Q. What believe you of the forgiveness of sin.

An. I believe that Jesus Christ has 1. Ioh. 2.2. Col. 1.14.20.21.22. 1. Cor.
1.30. Esaias. 53 45.6.8.12. Romans 3.24.15. and 5.8.10. 2. Cor. 5.19.
wholly appeased Gods wrath for my sins and has paid the full punishment due
unto them: and therefore that they are freely forgiven me, and shall never be
laid to my charge.

Q. What beleeuest thou of the rising again of the body?

Ans. I believe that after this life ended Luke 16.20. and 12.20.
my soul shall go to God that gave it and my body shall rest i^ the grave
until the appointed time and then I shall Job. 19.26.27. 1. Cor. 15.53.
Philip. 3.21.
see God in my flesh and these my eyes shall look upon him and this my body
shall be made like to the glorious body of Christ without al^ corrupion.

Q. What believe you of life everlasting?

An. I believe that when God shall raise again this my body and join it
together with my soul that then I shall live with 1. Cor. 15.53.54. ^. these.
4.17.
Christ for ever in his everlasting kingdom of glory.

Q. Is it in our power to believe and to attain to this true faith?

5 part.
Ans. No, it is the special work of gods spirit in our hearts by those means
which he has appointed.

Q. By what means then may we attain unto faith?

An. The holy Ghost has appointed the preaching of the word to be the
ordinary means whereby he Rom 10.14.17. 1. Cor. 1.21.
works in our hearts this true and lively faith and without the preaching of
the word we can never have faith by any ordinary means.

Q. What danger is it to be without faith?

An. Without faith it is impossible to please god. Heb. 11.6. for whatsoever is
not of faith is sin. Romans 14.23.

Q. By what means does God increase and strengthen this faith and the fruits
thereof?

A. This faith and the fruits thereof does God strengthen and increase in us by
four means: 2. Cor. 8.7. and 8. 2. Pet. 3.18.
by the self same preaching of the word; by use of the sacraments; prayer; and
Christian government.

Q. What call you Sacraments?

A. Sacraments are Gene. 17.11 Exo. 12.3.4.5. etc.
outward signs ordained of God for the greater assurance and strengthening of
our faith, being unto us Romans 4.11.
sure seals and pledges of those benefits of our salvation which we receive in
Christ to be ours, and are represented unto us by the outward signs of water
in Baptism, and bread and wine in the supper of the Lord, they serve also for
a mark of our profession whereby we differ from other people which be heathen.

Q. Tell me more shortly what is a sacrament?

A. An outward sign ordained of God, Romans 4.11.
and a seal to assure us that we are made partakers of Christ Jesus and all
his benefits unto salvation, if we do truly believe in him.

Q. How many things are to be considered in a sacrament?

A. Two: the outward sign, and the inward thing signified.

Q. What mean you by the outward sign?

A. The outward element, appointed by our Savior Christ, and all the rites
belonging to the ministering and receiving thereof, according to his institution.

Q. What mean you by the inward thing signified?

A. Christ Jesus himself with all his benefits unto salvation, offered unto us
in the sacrament, and so also received of every faithful believer.

Q. How many sacraments be there?

A. There be 1. Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4.
two. Baptism, and the supper of the Lord.

Q. What is baptism?

A. The sacrament of our new birth, whereby we are incorporated into the
society of Gods people. Romans 6.3.

Q. What benefits of your salvation are sealed to you in baptism?

A. I am taught and assured by Acts. 22.16. Mar. 1.4.
Baptism that my sins are forgiven me. For as the water washes away the
filthiness of the body, even so should I by the holy Ghost be thereby fully
certified and persuaded, that 1. Pet. 1.2.19. 1 Ioh. 1.7. Ephesians 5.26. Tit. 3.5.6.

hand of faith, has washed away both the guiltiness of my sin, and the
horrible punishment due to the same, the fruit and effect whereof appears
herein that through the power of Christ's death and resurrection I am dead Romans
6 3.^ 6. etc.
as touching sin, and raised up again 2. Cor. 5.17 Gala 5.24.25
to newness of life. Which two things in whomesoeuer they appear not, they
may well have the name and title of baptism, but indeed they are no true
Christians.

Q. What mean you by the supper of the Lord?

A. The sacrament of our growth and spiritual food, whereby we are to be
nourished till we come to a perfect age in Christ.

Q. What benefits of your salvation are sealed unto you in the supper of the
Lord?

A. The supper of the Lord through the holy Ghost does strengthen my faith,
that I should not doubt but believe assuredly that as I receive the bread and
wine into my body to become wholly mine, so my Mat. 26.20.^7.28.
soul receives withal, through faith, Christ with his Cor. 10.16.17. ^
11.26.27.28. 1. Cor. 1.30. ^om. 4.23. Cor. 5.31.
passion, ransom, righteousness, and obedience, to become wholly mine, as
surely as if I had performed all in mine own person. 1. Cor. 1.30.

Q. Are not the bread and wine in the supper of the Lord turned into the body
and blood of Christ?

A. The bread and wine as touching their nature and substance Mat. 26.26.27.28.
1. Cor. 10.16.17. and 11.24.25. and 12.13.
are not turned, but as touching the use of them they differ from common bread
and wine, in that they are appointed of god to serve unto us as Romans 4.11
sure seals and pledges of those benefits of our salvation which Christ in his
body has wrought for us.

Q. What persons are fit to be partakers of this sacrament?

A. Such as are able and do fitly prepare themselves.

Q. In what manner ought thou to prepare thy self to receive such holy
mysteries?

A. In preparing my self to receive the supper of the Lord, I ought diligently
to observe these three things. First, to 1. Cor. 11.28.
examine my self whether I 2. Cor. 13.5.
stand in faith or no, which I shall know if I feel my Ephesians. 1.13. 2. Cor.
1.22. and 5.5.
heart inwardly Romans 8.15. Ephesians. 3.12.
assured by the spirit of God, that the 1. Ioh. 2.1.2.
punishment of my sins is fully discharged in Christ, and that whatsoever he
has wrought for man's salvation pertains not only to others, but even Ephesians.
3.17.18.^9.
to me. Secondly, to examine my self whether I find my heart Mat. 26.75.
^erem. 4.4. ^oel 2.12.
inwardly sorry for my sins with an inward hatred and loathing of sin, and
an Romans 6.4.5.6.^.8. Phil. 3.13.14.
earnest desire and sure purpose wholly to conform my self to the will of
Gods word. Thirdly, if any offense be betwixt others and me, that I Mat.
5.23.24.
reconcile my self unto them all, which things although they ought earnestly
to be considered in the Luke 1.74.75. ^. Peter. 1.15.
whole course of our life, yet then especially when we come to receive the
supper of the Lord.

A morning prayer for a family.
O Most mighty, eternal, and everliving Lord God, maker of heaven and earth,
and in Christ Jesus thy deare^ beloved son, our most patient, gracious, and
merciful father; we thy ^oore unworthy servants here humbling our selves
before thy divine Maie^^e, do unfeignedly acknowledge that ^e are not worthy
to lift up our eyes (...) heaven, nor to enjoy the least of thy ^ercies, being
in our selves most vil^ ^d wretched sinners, guilty both of ^at original
corruption which we ^e received from the fall, and disobedience of our
forefather Adam, and al^ of most grievous and innumerable ^^^nsgressions of all
thy holy laws and ^^mmandements, in our thoughts, ou^ ^ctions, our words, and
deeds, ^erein we have fearfully sinned and ^elled against thee: both in
omitting (...) good things thou do command us, and in committing those evil
things thou do forbid us, in the duties of thy holy worship, the love of our
brethren, and the labors of our calling: we have infinitely dishonored thy
holy name and taken it in vain, in that we have not walked worthy of thy
Gospel, and our holy calling and profession: we have defiled thy sanctuary and
plac^ of thy holy presence, coming before thee with unprepared hearts to offer
v^ our sacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving and to hear thy word, our lips
ha^ come near unto thee, but our hea^ have been far from thee; whereb^ all
the heavenly instructions of thy h^ly word have been stolen away from us, and
made unfruitful, and we (...) come unprofitable hearers. O Lord, (...)
confess we are not able to reckon (...) the least measure of our sins, for
the are more then the hairs of our he^ whereby we have fearfully provoke thy
wrath and indignation against (...) from day to day, and from time (...) time;
giving thee just occasion to (...) prive us of all blessings, and to pow^ down
all thy curses upon us in all plagues and miseries of this life, and to cast us
out of thy presence into everlasting torments of soul and body in hell fire.
Notwithstanding, O Lord, seeing thou have taught us that mercy pleases thee,
and that if we confess our sins, thou art faithful and just to forgive us
our sins, and to purge us from all our iniquity: we fly unto this thy
mercy, and that in the only name, merits, and mediation of thy son Jesus
Christ, in whom only and alone thou art well pleased, beseeching thee for his
sake, to pardon and forgive us all our sins, original and actual, to wash
away all the guiltines of them in his most innocent blood, to bury them ^or
ever in his most precious death: to ^urne thy face away from them, and from us
all thy judgments and curses which we have worthily deserved for them, either
public or private.

And we beseech thee vouchsafe with ^e precious water of thy spirit, daily to
^ash and cleanse our hearts and minds, ^ir souls, and bodies, from all
uncleanness of sin, from all iniquity and ungodliness, from every evil work,
and evil way, to work in us more and more a true sight and hatred of all ou^
sins, with that Godly sorrow tha^ may bring forth in us repentance neue^ to
be repented of, to arm us with a^ that spiritual armor, that may mak^ us to
stand steadfast and fight manfull^ under thy banner in our holy profession of
thy gospel, make thy holy word t^ dwell plentifully in us with all wisdom^ that
it may be unto us the sword of the spirit whereby we may get victor^ over all
the power, malice, and subti^tie of Satan, and all the wickedness (...) our
own sinful, and rebellious nature, over all the courses, customs,
o^casions, and examples of this sin f^^ evil world: yea over every sin the
hitherto has passed us, even those the have most strongly prevailed again^ us,
wherein we have most often a^ fearfully fallen, and to that which w^ are most
prone and subject: that he^ forth we may walk in the ways (...) good men, and
in the paths of the rig^teous, that is, in the way of thy laws, and the path
of thy commandments, hating all works of darkness, and behauing our selves in
all things as the children of light.

This must be added for the day.
And now, Lord, we further commend our selves and this whole family, and every
member of the same, unto thy most gracious government and protection the rest of
this day, beseeching thee to watch over us for good, and to preserve us from
all dangers and evils that otherways may come upon us in soul or in body,
or in any thing that belongs unto us, stirring up our hearts and
strengthening us with thy grace to walk diligently and faithfully in our
several callings, making conscience to bestow this day, and all the days of
our life, and all thy precious time which thou do vouchsafe us more
profitably then ever we have done hitherto; furnish every one of us with all
gifts and graces necessary for our callings, both governors, children, and
servants, that every one of us in our several places may know how to behave
ourselves, and faithfully to perform every good duty with all simplicity and
godly pureness, as thou do teach us in thy holy word; truly loving one
another, truly caring one for another, to the glory of thy name, the peace of
our own consciences, our mutual comfort and the good example of all those
with whom we live. Sanctify unto us the use of all thy good creatures this
day, bless us and prosper us in all our labors, provide mercifully for all
our necessities, supply our wants, make us every way cheerful in thy service,
and so guide us in all things that we may carry out the profession of thy
glorious gospel in a holy, blameles, and christian conversation all the days
of our life, that we may make a godly, christian, and comfortable end of this
pilgrymage, with full assurance of eternal life, through our Lord and savior
Jesus Christ.

stand and rejoice under the hope of thy glory; we thank thee also for all
other blessings which we daily receive by thy graci^ providence in preserving
us from manyfold dangers and evils where unto we are subject, in feeding

Finally that thou have kept us (...) night past; for the quiet and comfort^ble

thy heavenly wisdom an^ incomprehensible love do know v^ or any of thine
to stand in need of, for our lord and savior Jesus Christ hi^ sake in whose
name we pray further^ Our father which art in heaven, etc.

An Evening prayer.
O almighty and eternal Lord God father of our Lord Jesus Christ we thy
poor unworthy servants, being come together to offer up unto thee our
evening sacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving according to our bound duty do
first of all acknowledge against our selves that we are al of us most vile and
wretched sinners, not worthy the least of al thy mercies; being guilty of the
fall of our forefather Adam, of our own original corruption and of
innumerable and most heinous transgressions of all thy ho^^ laws and
commandments both (...) our sinful thoughts, words and deed and so much the
more guilty, because we have not regarded the good mean which thou have
mercifully ordeyne^ for us, to have wrought in our heart true knowledge and
understanding o^ thy will and commandments, repentance of our sins and
amendment of our life; we confess therefore that we have infinitely provoked
thy wrath and judgment against us, and justly deserved all curses, plagues and
miseries to be poured upon us in this life and to be cast for ever hereafter
into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone; but good Lord we appeal
unto the unsearchable riches of thy mercies in Christ Jesus, beseeching thee to
wash away all our sins and guiltines in his most precious blood, to bury them
all in his most glorious death, that they may be removed for ever out of thy
sight and be unto us as though they had never been, let thy blessed spirit of
Adoption good lord seal unto our hearts ^he full assurance of this thy
everlasting ^oue and mercy* and lord work in us ^ayly more and more a godly
sorrow ^or all our sins with hearty and vnfei^ed repentance, and so work in
our ^earts by thy holy spirit that all the ^ower of sin may daily die in us
more and more, and all good graces of ^hy spirit may daily grow and increase ^n
us, that our hearts may be strengthened with an unfeigned faith and we may be
purged from evil consciences and made fruitful in all duties of christian
love, so as in the whole course of our life hereafter we may walk before thee
in all simplicity and godly pureness and serve thee unfeignedly in all the duties
of true holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.

And now lord we further commend our selves and every member of this family
into thy merciful protection this night, beeseeching thee to preserve and
keep us from all dangers and perils to which we are subject in soul or
body, or any thing that belongs unto us* to give us quiet and comfortable
rest with the continuance of our health peace, and saftie to the glory of the
name that we may be more fit for the duties of our calling when thou sha^^
raise us again and so to guide us and sanctify us throughout, that whethe^ we

A morning prayer for servants by themselves.
O almighty Lord God our most gracious and loving Father in Jesus Christ we
do unfeignedly confess before thy majesty that we are all of us most vile
wretched sinners, conceived and borne in sin, altogether corrupted and
defiled in our own nature, guilty of innumerable and heinous transgressions
of all thy holy laws and commandments, unapt to all goodness, proane to all
sin and wickedness, unworthy of any of thy blessings, even the least of all
thy mercies; and worthy of all thy fearful curses contained in thy law, in
all miseries of this life, and of eternal death and damnation in the life to
come; but most merciful father we beseech thee look upon us in Jesus Christ
pardon and forgive us all our sins for his sake, work in us more and more
the sight and feeling of all our sins, with a true loathing and hatred of
them, a godly sorrow for them, and an holy repentance; give us faith in thy
precious promises that we may trust perfectly upon that salvation that is
brought unto us by Christ Jesus, with the full assurance of our eternal
election unto immortal life. Increase in us care and conscience to use all
good means that thou have ordained for our instruction, and write in our
hearts all the good lessons that we hear out of thy holy word that we may
daily grow and increase in all grace and godliness.

Receive us this day into thy holy protection, keep us from all dangers and
evils of body and soul, work in us all dutiful reverence to our superiors,
all diligence, and faithfullnes in our labors. Keep us from slothfulnes,
negligence and idleness, and all manner of unjust dealing in our service. Bless
and prosper us in all our labors; wherein we are to be employed that we may be
profitable to our governors to whom we owe our service, and carry the
testimony of good consciences in our souls, to thy glory and our everlasting
peace and comfort, through Jesus Christ our only savior and redeemer in whose
name we pray further as he has taught us. Our father, etc.

unto thy holy word, and delight in thy commandments, give us grace to seek

delivered unto us, upon all the labors of our teachers, and all our own
studies and endeuoures that we may daily grow and increase in all good learning
