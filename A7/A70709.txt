A NEW SONG: BEING A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIGG and TORY.
Concerning the Election of Sheriffs.
TORY, Come, let us all at last agree, Debate's a Cursed Fashion:
It Is only base Disloyalty, Infects the King and Nation.

Whig. HOw! What, in such a Case Unite?
'T would be a plain Repentance:
A Whig, can never turn Proselyte,
Before he hears his Sentence.

Tory. Whence are you thus inspired with Zeal?
Sure it is the Devil's Motion;
Two Sheriffs never made a Commonweal,
That Is but a Formal Notion.

Whig. In troth, the depth you do not see,
Of all our Stir and Fury;
Our Guilty Crimes must never go Free,
But by a well-pick't Jury.

Tory. If then it be self Preservation,
That you from Sheriffs claim,
Why may not We, and half the Nation,
Expect and seek the same!

Whig. Alas! with us it is otherwise,
Though we don't draw our Swords;
We may be hanged for being wise,
Or speaking dangerous Words.

Tory. But now you see, by the Effect,
Since all is past and done,
That North and Rich are true Elect,
And have the Conquest won!

Whig. Then needs must Tyburn have us all,
For which we were created;
For when You rise, We needs must fall,
And with our Noise be hated.

Tory. Take heed then of the good Old Cause,
Be sure to rule your Tongue;
These honest Men must rule by the Laws,
Which never will do you wrong.

Whig. Tell me no more of wholesome Laws,
Which hold with Reason still;
By Factions I must get Applause,
And gratify my Will.

Tory. Come Whig, it is time to leave this way,
And change your bad Condition;
In all things now the King obey,
And not your own Ambition.
