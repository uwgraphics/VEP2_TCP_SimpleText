The first part of the History of the famous Euordanus, Prince of Denmark;
with his adventures, and fortune in Love.
CHAP. I. How King Frederick and his Queen walking to take the air, were
assaulted by a company of Out-lawes, and how the Queen was delivered of a
child in the Forest.
YOU may read in the Chronicles of Denmark, of the great love between King
Frederick, and the famous Allisonne, Countess of Flaunders. And how that after
a long contention, between the said Frederick, and Griffory Duke of Holland,
the King married her in the great City of Gaunt, to the extreme grief of
the said Griffory, who thereupon gave over all martial exercises for a season,
until such time as he was revenged, as you may more at large read of in the
said Chronicle, written by one Cleonido a Dane.

Not long after the said marriage, the King having settled the estate of that
Earldom, returned into Denmark with his beautiful Queen, where at the
arrival, they were received with great honor and triumph by his subjects, who
loved him as entirely, as it was possible for any subjects to love their
Prince, as appeared by their solemn processions, ringing of bells, staitly
pagants, and other gallant shows, which were presented unto him in every Town
he passed through. But coming into Maiance, which then was the chief City
of the kingdom, he was presented with such variety of pleasing shows, that
it passes my capacity to describe them, likewise there were many excellent
and learned Orations, pronounced by the chief scholars of the University of
Maiance, setting forth the great love of the people toward their Prince, and
the joy conceived of his marriage with so excellent a Lady as was his Queen.
On the otherside, the King to gratefie his subjects loving minds, showed
himself bountiful and liberal unto all, to some by gifts, to others by
promises and fair words, and to all by pleasing iestures, so that one might
rightly say, there was in him the lively portrature of a most grave and prudent
Prince, and in them the true show of faithful and loving subjects.

But as it always happens, when men think themselves in greatest felicity,
then whether it be by the instabilitie of Fortune, or else that the Fates and
destinies have so appointed it, they are oftentimes suddenly tumbled down,
into grief and misery. Even so it happened with the King and Queen, who living
a while in this content, were suddenly driven into great cares and perplexity.
Whereby we may perceive, the divine power of God to be such, that he can pull
down Princes from their thrones, and restore them again at his pleasure, as
sometimes he did by Nabucadnezar and others, to the setting forth of his
glory and power.

Now was it hard about the Month of May, when as the fields and woods were
decked with Floras brood, and on each spray sat lovely birds, resounding
heavenly harmony. The pretty Nitingall, setting her speckled breast against a
bryer, regarded not fond Terius foul desire, but chaunted forth her pleasant
ditties. When as the King and Queen, accompanied with a small train of Lords
and Ladies whom they loved, one morning early stale forth of the Court
secretly, to disport themselves in the forest, which was hard adjoining unto
the City walls, where they had not long remained, beholding the broad-shaded
Oaks, and stately lofty Pines, before that a company of Out-lawes, who were
banished the Kingdom of France, had espied them, and seeing they were no
better provided, set on them. Where one might have beheld the Queen and her
Ladies so affrighted with this sudden accident, fling up and down, some hiding
themselves in one bush, some in another. Others again being more timorous,
suncke down where they stood, not being able to fly away. But all was one,
fly or tarry, for being pursued, they were all taken, and brought back,
saving only the Queen, who being carried forwards with the wings of fear,
made such have that she escaped them all, being so appointed by the
providence of God.

The King likewise and Noblemen being amazed at this unlooked for event, knew
not well suddenly what to determine, but in the end, seeing no other remedy,
resolved to defend themselves as well as they might. The King being at that
time one of the most accomplished Knights in all Europe, laid on such blows
amongst them, that he made an evident show that he was determined to sell his
life at an extreme dear rate. But being unarmed, and having no other weapon
but his sword, and all his company being slain outright saving two, who were
likewise grievously wounded, was forced perforce to yield to their pitiless
mercy: who having obtaind victory, stripped them all, as well Lords as Ladies of
their coin, and abilliments which were ought worth. And binding those whom
they thought might any ways work them displeasure, as by raising power to
pursue them, or unbinding their fellows, they determined speedily to depart
toward the Sea coast, where some of their company remained, with two small
Barks, wherewith they crossed the seas. But as they were ready to depart, it came
into one of their minds, that some of them whom they had robbed, might
peradventure be such persons, for whose ransom, they might get more coin
then all their booty was worth: wherefore demanding of one of the Ladies who^
they had bound, what they were, was given to understand, that he who made the
greatest resistance was the King, the other two which were living, both noble
men of his Court. Then calling to his mind, the great hate between the said
King, and Griffory Duke of Holland, determined if he could, to carry him with
him, and to present him to the Duke, of whom he hoped to receive some great
reward. Wherefore entreating his fellows, who knew not who^ they had robbed,
so grant him so much favor, as to permit him to have that Knight for his
prisoner, in regard as knowing him heretofore in France, fayning that there
he had done great despite to a friend of his, in revenge whereof he would
deliver him into his hands, whom he knew would keep him in eternal prison for
his former offense. Now if they would be contented to grant this unto him, he
would seek for no other part of their booty.

They all being more greedy of pray then of prisoners, who they thought might
rather be a charge, then profit unto them, were content to grant unto his
request. Who presently went and unbound the King, and so led him directly
toward their shipping. And having wind at will, presently wayed Ancor, and
set into the Sea, where we will leave them for awhile, and return to the
Queen, who by her swift flight, mist the hands of the thieues, but fell into
as great or greater ill. For whilst the King and the other Lords held the
thieues somewhat short, by defending themselves, as is before declared, the
fearful Queen flying into the wood for safety, strayed two and fro she wist
not whether. At length, being wearied with running, and fainting still with
fear, she sat her down under a Juniper bush, to refresh her self, where
after she had awhile rested her self, she began to call to mind, and
consider in what great danger she had left her Lord and husband, then
reproving herself, for that she had not rather made choice to have stayed and
ended her days with him, then thus to have romed she wist not whether. Then
rising up, she determined to have returned to the same place where she left
them fighting, but strayed further, so that tracing and traversing up and down
the wood, she spent the whole day to her no small grief. And now dark night
having spread her sable mantle over the face of the earth, the sorrowful
Queen, not knowing what to do, or whether to go, determined to take up her
lodging for yt night, under a broad branched Oak, fast by a fountains side,
whereas the wild beasts of the Forest did commonly resort to drink, where good
Lady she was forced to content herself with a hungry pittance, tears being
her daintiest dish, whereon she fed, sometimes exclayming on cruel fortune,
whom she accused to have brought her into these miseries: then presently her
husbands portrature seemed to appear unto her mind, whom she thought to be
murdered by those robbers, which was such a grief unto her, that many times she
was minded to have slain her self, had not God mightily preserved her to a
further setting forth of his glory.

Thus past she away most part of the night with weeping and lamentations,
until such time that Somnus with his leaden wings seized her eyelids, and
caused her for a while to slumber. In which sleep, she thought an Angel sent
from God, being clothed all in white raiment, appeared unto her, saying, Be of
good heart and fear not, for these crosses which now are come upon thee, the
Lord has sent to prove thee with all, and therefore it behooves thee to bear
it patiently, until such time as the Lord shall ease thee of them. As for the
King thy husband he lives, but yet in bands, and shall do still, until such
time as the child that now is in thy womb, shall be his deliverer, whom thou
at his birth shall name Euordanus, this now am I sent to tell thee, because
thou should not despair.

The Queen heereat awaked out of her slumber, and looking about if she might
see any body, but could not, then perceiving it to be a dream, or vision,
meruailed what it might signify, and was greatly troubled with devising
thereof: so that all the night after she could take no rest, sometimes
thinking of her husband, and sometimes what the childs deliverance might
mean, at length determined to refer all to the merciful providence of God.
Thus sits she poor sorrowful Lady, till such time as by the singing of the
cheerful Lark, and by the roaring of the wild beasts, she was preparing to
forsake Dame Thetis lodging, and that nights sable mantle was changed into a
hoary gray. When lo, as was their wont, the savage beasts came unto the well
to drink, there did she with fear behold the stately Unicorn, with the
cruel Tiger, ye roaring Bear, and gaudy Panther, the bellowing Bull, and
foming Bore, the ravening Wolf, and crafty Fox, with diverse more, which put
her in such fear, that she had thought presently to have been devoured, when
salling on her knees, and holding up her hands, she said these or such like
words.

O most merciful Lord God, I do here acknowledge before thy divine majesty,
my manifold and innumerable sins committed against thy divine majesty both in
thought, word, and deed, O Lord I am not worthy so much as once to look up to
heaven, much less to receive any thing at thy hands O Lord. Yet merciful
Father, trusting in the merits of thy dearly beloved son, our Lord and
Savior Christ Jesus, I come unto thee in his name, craving forgiveness of all
my sins and iniquities. And further, O Lord God, I humbly beseech thee to
save and deliver me, from this present danger, and perrill of my wretched
life, O Lord bow down thy heavenly eye, and behold me thy woeful handmaide,
and likewise this poor infant that is within my womb, defend it, O Lord, and
grant that according unto the vision which thou by thy holy Angel have showed
me, it may live to set forth thy glory and power, and in the end, when it
shall be thy blessed will, to call us out of this wretched vale of wickedness,
thou will receive and place us in thy Celestial kingdom, whether O Lord for
thy sons sake bring us I beseech thee.

These, or such like were the words, which she distressed Lady then uttered:
when behold a mighty surious Lion came rushing out of the wood toward her,
bringing in his mouth a cake of Bread, which he most gently laid down at her
feet, fawning upon her, as if of long time he had bin acquainted with her, and
would not depart from her. At length, somewhat to recomfort herself, then
smoothing his rough bristles with her tender hand, she made much of him laying
his head on her lap, whereat he seemed to take great content. Then taking up the
cake of bread which he had brought her, and giving thanks unto God, imagining
as sometimes in the wilderness he had sent Ravens to feed the Prophet Elias,
so likewise had he now sent the Lion to comfort and bring her food, she
refreshed therewith her hungry stomach. After which repast, the Lion very
softly paced toward the wood again, ever casting back his head, as if he
looked whether ye Lady followed him or not, which she at length perceiving,
determined to follow him, hoping thereby either to get out of the wood, or else
to find some better place of safety. Thus went they together, till at last he
brought her unto a Cave underneath the ground, with a very narrow entrance in,
but being entered, she found it a reasonable large room. Thus determining for
a while to remain th^^ (...) such time as God should send her better fortune,
passing away the time some whiles with walking about the woods near the Cave,
otherwhiles with playing with the Lion, who every day brought her in meat,
such as he got abroad in the Forest, which she sometimes scorched and dried in
the sun, otherwhiles was forced to eat it raw, until such time as by hap
one day walking abroad, she found a flint stone, with which afterward she
used to strike fire, and therewith would broyle her meat. Thus continued she,
until such time, that according to the natural course of women, her time of
childe-birth was come. When as good Lady, feeling the pains thereof, to her
most strange and extreme, not having any to comfort and help her, she fell
again into her wonted passion of dolor, complaining of her cruel fortune,
which had deprived her of all help and comfort, and had brought her into this
extreme sorrow and pains. But even then, in the midst of her complaints, God
pitying her grief, sent her safe deliverance of a most goodly and beautiful
boy, which when she beheld, according to the saying of the Scripture, she
forgate all her former sorrow, rejoicing that a man child was borne into the
world: and giving thanks unto God, she took the child up in her arms, and
beholding it, she imagined that in him she saw the lively figure of the King
her husband. And making such shift as she could to wrap him up in clothes,
she beheld on his right shoulder a well proportioned cross, which seemed
far redder then the rest of his body, whereat she greatly meruailed: then
calling to mind her vision, she hoped that in time he should prove a famous
man, and a scourge unto the enemies of the Christian faith, as she thought the
sign of the Cross did already foreshew, then likewise remembering the name
which the Angel had told her in her vision, as soon as she had recovered
strength to go, went with her son to the fountain, where she baptized him,
naming him as she was willed, Euordanus, then returned she again to the Cave,
where we will leave her for a while with her young Infant, and return to
speak of the King her husband.

CHAP. II. How King Frederick being carried away by the Out-lawes, after a
great storm at sea arrived in Holland, whereas he was sold to his mortal
enemy, the Duke Griffory.
AFter the Out-lawes had brought their booty and good King aboard, and had set
sail, minding to have gone for some place of France, where they might have
secretly stolen ashore, to learn some news of their own affairs, and
having the wind large, determined to have landed in a small cricke not far
from Rotchell, because most of them were heretofore inhabitants of that Town,
but even as they were come within the sight of Land, on a sudden the Skies
began to ouercast, the sun was clowded, and the face of heaven was so
darkened, that one could not discern at that present time, being about no one
days from the darkest midnight: the winds began to blow on all sides, as if
that Eolus had unstopped all his ayrie Cave, and had determined with one
assault to have subdued Neptunes Regiments. Or as when the angry Goddess Juno
greeuing at the quiet passage of the poor vanquished Trojans, desired Eolus to
sink them in the sea: so fared it with them, by reason that the seas on all
sides being so assaulted of the winds, did so cruelly rage and storm, that
sometimes their small Barks did seem to touch the very clouds, and presently
again were thrown down unto the sands, every man imagining that to be the
last hour of their lives. Some, as is commonly the custom of such people
being in extremity, fell to prayer, othersome to cursing and swearing: the
Master cries in with the sails, others cry down with the Mast, some again,
to lighten their Bark of her burden, the more yarly to rise with the Seas,
begin to throw over board all whatsoever comes to hand, hoping thereby, as
with a pleasing sacrifice, to appease the angry Seas.

But even as they were thus busied, some on one thing, others on another thing,
a mighty gust in manner of a Whirlewind, coming out of the South-west, bears
both masts and sails by the burden. The Bark wherein the King was, having
spent both their fore and maine Mast, were forced to put to hull, yielding
themselves to the pitiless mercy of the wind and seas, which every minute was
ready to have devoured and swallowed them up. Thus continued the storm by the
space of three days, the wind sometimes in their forshyp, then in their poupe,
now in the quarter, and presently again in their bow, continuing with such
force, that the best man aboard was scarcely able to stand on the hatches. But
at length, as every storm has an end, so now Neptune rousing himself out of
his fair Queen Amphitries bosom, and beholding she poor distressed
Mariners, took pity on their miseries, and lifting his hoary head above the
waters, assuaged them, and with his three-forked Mace rebuked the Winds,
threatening to punish their arrogant presumption, if he hereafter happened to
find them with the like offense.

The storm being thus broken up, and the Sun beginning again to lighten
the earth with his splendant beams, the weather-beathen Mariners looking
abroad for their comfort, espied the Land, which after they had a while with
joy beheld, they made to be the Land of Holland. Who then so glad as Martinus,
for so was he called which had the King to his prisoner, for whom he hoped ere
long to receive such a sum of money, as for ever should make him rich: the
King on the other side was in as great perplexity, knowing that they were
arrived on the coast of his greatest enemy, yet comforting himself somewhat
with the hope of not being known, as also of not knowing Martinus meaning, he
showed himself the more cheerful. Thus between hope and fear, they
altogether passed away the time, in merry discourses of their former danger,
till such time as they were come on land, at a Port called Alentmaer, where
Martinus fayning himself to be very ill at ease, by reason of the late
storm, craved leave of the rest of his company, to go with his prisoner unto
the City of Hanstance, which was not passing three leagues of, now called
Ansterdam: where he determined to rest himself, until such time as he found
himself thoroughly amended, which they soon granted him, not knowing his
intent, and being also willing to be rid of his company, because of his
double charge.

So departed Martinus with his prisoner, whom he swore so continue true unto
him: as fearing his escape, being to travel but they two together, but the
King being in his enemies country, durst not make himself known, which he
must needs, if he had made any resistance. Thus traveling on together toward
Hanstance, they arrived there at such time, as the blushing sun plucking in
his smiling beams, making his steedes to mende their wonted place, and
plunging down into the Ocean streams, there in the frothy waves did hide his
face, leaving the earth covered with nights darksome shade: wherefore that
night they took up their lodging, Martinus learning of his haost, how Duke
Griffory having ever since she marriage of the King of Denmark, and the fair
Lady Allison of Flaunders, given over all pleasure, was withdrawn from his
Court into the Country, some eight miles distance from the City: where having
built a lodge in a maruilous solitary place, he passed the time in
mellancholly humors, somewhiles playing on the Lute some mournful ditties,
otherwhiles, ingrauing in the trees on the ground Verses and Sonnets, feeding
his humors with such vain toies, to the great grief of all his subjects: and
how in all that time he never had sufferd any one to come into his presence, or
to speak with him, saving a small company of his attendants, which remained
there with him. When Martinus had heard all this, he determined ye next day to
go thither, and to make known unto him those things, which should soon put
him out of his melancholy dumpes. The next morning very early he was rissen up,
and coming to the King, told him how that he had some occasion of business in
the Country, which would cause him to be away a day or two, wherefore he was
determined in the mean time, leaving him behind him, to cause him once more to
swear unto him, to remain until his return, which if he refused, that then
he would commit him unto some prison within the City, whereas he should be
always forth coming at his pleasure. The King listening attentively unto his
speech, was driven into a thousand imaginations, not knowing what was best for
him to do, at length considering his former oath, which rather then he would
violate, he would choose to endure any death whatsoever, so much did he esteem
of his Kingly oath: he answered him thus. I know not what your meaning may
be, in this sort to doubt my former promise, and to go about by a new oath to
assure your self of me: if to set me to ransom, I here freely proffer my
self to go a long with you into any place, out of this accursed region, and
there to remain, until such time that the same be paid unto you, although
it should amounte unto an hundred thousand pounds, rather then that you should
deliver me, into the hands of the Governor of this accursed Country, who is my
mortal enemy.

Nay, nay, replied Martinus, being blinded with covetousness, and hoping for a
greater sum of money: there is no such matter meant, but I have not far off
a friend, whose council I mind to follow herein: in the mean time choose
whether you will remain in prison, or upon your oath. The King seeing no
remedy, swear unto him again to continue his true prisoner, although it cost
him his life.

Then departed Martinus, toward the Dukes lodge, where being arrived, and
desiring conference with his grace, touching such matters as nearly concerned
him, he was at length brought into a garden, in form much like unto an
endless laborinth, so many were the diverse and sundry walks and allies,
covered with many kinds of trees, which yielded such a close shadow, that the
Sun with his splendant beams could scarce shinne through: and passing thus
from one walk into another, he came at length where the Duke sat in an Arbor
of Baies, being clothed all in black, signifying his great sorrow which he
sustained, and having a Lute in his hand, was playing a mornefull dittie, which
he even then had framed, to which Martinus and his guide a while listened,
unseen by reason of the thicknes of the Arbor.

At length coming nearer, and with reverence saluting his excellency,
Martinus spoke as follows.

Most mighty and puissant Prince, I cannot but wounder that you who
heretofore, were wont to spend your time in most honorable exercises, as Tilt
and Turnie, and following hautie deeds of Chivalry, should so give your self
over unto this solitary kind of life, neither regarding your own estate, nor
the estate of your loving subjects and Country: which would spend their very
lives to work your content. But if I be not deceived, this strange humor
wherewith you are possessed, proceeds from contrary occasions, the one is the
extreme hate you bear unto the King of Denmark, the other over much love
toward the beautiful Queen his wife, not knowing with your self what way to
be revenged of him, nor how to regaine her love. But suppose most mighty
Prince, I should work the means of your revenge, by delivering him into your
hands, would not it content you? yea would you not more rejoice thereof, then
to have gained the greatest City in Christendom, and likewise reward him,
that should effect the same to his content: speak O worthy Duke, were not
these the occasions of thy grief, and would not this likewise be the chiefest
medicine to sease thy sorrow.

Scarce were these last words uttered, when the Duke starting up, and staring
him in the face, as one wakned out of sound sleep, thus replied. Friend,
whatsoever thou art that seek by a feigned and filed tale, to drive me out of
my sad passions; know that to jest with Princes is not tolerable: But if thou
can perform, that whereof thou have made show of, I will not be slack in
rewarding thee for thy pains, though thou should demand half my
Dukedom. Therefore tell me by what means this may be accomplished: then
effect and bring it to pass, and I will reward thee to thy own content.
Worthy Duke replied Martinus, if I perform it not, then let my head be
stricken from my shoulders, conditionally that if I do deliver into thy hands,
that unhappy King, I may have for my reward the City of Hanstance during my
life, with the profits thereof: and this confirm unto me before your
Nobility, and then I will deliver him into your hands, within this eight days
next coming.

The Duke being filled with joy, with this his so comfortable news, consented
unto whatsoever he demanded, and calling for a Knight which was nearest unto
him, willed him to sommon his Counsel the next day, to be attendant to hear
a matter of importance, which he would show unto them: which was forthwith
accomplished, every one the next day at their hour appointed, being ready in
the Counsel chamber, to hear what should be their Princes will: every one
greatly meruailing what soden motion, was entered in his head, considering that
by the space of a year before, he had never conferred with them of any matter,
no nor once suffered them to come into his presence. They being as I have said
gathered together in the Counsel chamber, the Duke leading Martinus by the
hand, came unto them, where he declared his intent, with the promise of
Martinus: all which was consented unto by them, hoping thereby to have their
Prince in his former estate of content: Assuring unto Martinus under their
hands and seals, that whatsoever the Duke had made promise of, they would see
it performed, so soon as he should deliver the King of Denmark into their
hands. Here will I leave them to tell of the great grief, made through all
Denmark, for the loss of their King and Queen.

CHAP. III. How the King and Queen being found missing, were sought for, and
how the Lords and Ladies that were with them were found.
THe same morning that the King and Queen went to recreate themselves in the
forest, as is before declared, they were not found missing, till such time as
ye tables being spread for diner, and many Lords and Ladies, Knights, Squiers,
and Gentlemen, being assembled together to give their attendance on his
Majesty, maruailed that he was so long, before he came down into the great
Hall, contrary to his use, which was always wont to be by ten of the
clock, where he remained until dinner time, passing away the time with mirth
and pleasant disports. At length having expected his coming until twelve of
the clock, and seeing that he came not, the Lord Treasure, whose name was Sir
Henault, musing what the cause might be, and doubting that all was not well, in
regard he neither came himself, neither any of the Squiers, which were
attending nearest unto him were seen to come down, to declare the cause, at
length went up unto the Kings bedchamber, where he found the Chamberlin with
diverse other Gentlemen, which always attended on the Kings own person. And
demanding of them where his Majesty was, that he came not down in the Hall
as he was accustomed, they all gave him answer, that the King and Queen,
accompanied with the Lord Gwaltero his Cousin, the Lord Bewdall, and the Lord of
Menew, with some Ladies and attendants, in the morning very early went forth at
the Posterne, toward the Forest to take the fresh air, and that since that
time they were not returned, neither did they know farther what was become of
them, but doubted least that they had strayed so far within the wood, that
they had lost their way forth. When Sir Henault had hard this, he was much
amassed, and greatly troubled in mind, fearing least there had been some
treason wrought against his Majesty: wherefore causing the reporters of these
news, to be in sure keeping, he went down, and declared the same to the rest
of the nobility, and taking counsel together, they determined forthwith to
make ageneral search, as well for the King and Queen, and nobles found
wanting, as also for all suspected persons, which might be thought any ways
guilty toward their absence: likewise they determined, to make a general
search throughout all the Forest, least peradventure, they were happened to go
astray, and could not find the ready way back again, or if that they were any
way distressed, either by thieves or wild beasts, that then they might rescue
them, or find what was become of them.

Thus having determined, they armed themselves, to the number of three
thousand, Knights and Gentlemen, and being mounted on their horses, they took
the way directly toward the Forest, where being arrived they separated
themselves into diverse companies, seeking up and down, and looking almost in
every bush, but could not find them whom they sought for, at length Sir Henault
with his company happening to pass that way, wherein the morning the fight had
been, chanced first to find some of the dead bodies, and looking farther,
saw whereas the Lords and Ladies lay bound, being almost dead with the pain
and grief which they sustained, ye Lords by reason of their wounds, and Ladies
by the fear wherein they were put: then coming more near unto them, they
found the Lord Gwaltero, and the Lord of Menew grievously wounded, the Lord
Bewdall with some four or five other Gentlemen slain out right, which sight
struck such a grief and sorrow into the hearts of all the beholders, especially
of Sir Henault, that he had much to do to sit on his horse, yet at length
recovering his senses, and causing them to be unbound, he demanded what was
become of the King and Queen, and by what misfortune they were brought into
this pitiful case.

The Lord Gwaltero having his wounds bound up, and being somewhat refreshed and
revived with such restoratiues, as some of the company had brought with them,
answered, how that walking to take the air, and to view those pleasant shades,
they were suddenly and unawares set on by forty thieves or Outlawes, whom by
their apparel and speech, they judged to be frenchmen, where defending
themselves as well as they might, were in the end thus overcome and wounded:
and as for the King, after they had bound us and were departing away, having
before stripped us of the wealth we had about us, they returned and took him
with them, toward the seaside. But of the Queen, we know no certainty, for
whilst we were fighting she fled into the wood, with the rest of the Ladies,
who were all brought back again save the Queen only, by some of the Outlawes
who persued them: more I know not, but fear least they likewise happened on
her, and have carried her with them: wherefore he thought it fit that pursuit
might be made after them to the seawards, where if they were not already gone,
it might so fortune as they might recover the King and Queen again, otherwise
there would be no hope left for seeing them in have.

When Sir Henault had heard this discourse made by the Lord Gwaltero, he was so
grieved inwardly, that with extreme sorrow he fell from his horse in a
trance, and being brought again to himself, seeing all things were to be
followed according to the occasion and time, first he commanded, some part of
his company to conuaie the Lords and Ladies to the Court, whereas they that
were wounded might find help for to cure the same: and they likewise that were
slain, might every one have burial according to their estates: himself in
the mean space being accompanied with a hundred Knights, would follow after
the thieves, hoping that if they were not put to sea before their coming, not
only to rescue the King, but also to give them such a reward as for ever should
be an example, to those who should go about to attempt the like. With this
determination they rode on toward the sea side, whereas they arrived, about
the time, when Vesperus, in the west had set the cunning watch, and silent
night richly attended by his twinkling train, sent sleep and slumber to
possess the world, and fantazie for to hazan idle heads, whereas they found
their labor fruitless, by reason that they were departed long before: and
seeing the night begin to wax dark, they all together determined on the
plain, hard by the sea side for that night to rest themselves, making fires
and great lights to cause the rest of their companies to come unto them, who
likewise had made a long and bootlesse search in the wood, and at length being
almost all come together, where Sir Henault remained, they determined the next
day to make preperation to follow them by sea, whom they could not recover on
shore.

CHAP. IIII. Of the general lamentation that was made throughout all the
Kingdom, and how that after a council held for the governing thereof, the
Knights and noble men took on them the search of the King.
THE next day, no sooner had dark night taken his leave, and that the day
began to appear in the East, but Sir Henault with the rest of his company,
were mounted on horsback, taking their way toward the sorrowful City of
Maiance, where being arrived, they found the City all full of heaviness, by
reason of the late news, which at their coming was so much the more
augmented, being returned without any certain knowledge what was become of the
King and Queen. There might you have seen the true description of sorrow, not
in one only creature, but in general through the whole City: some fell to
shutting up their doors and windows, as minding for very grief to enclose
themselves prisoners in their own houses, shunning the day light, which had
given light to those Robbers, who had dispoyled them of their joy and comfort.
Others again clad in black mournful attire, with their cheeks be spread with
tears, which like streams trickled down from the fountains of their eyes,
went up and down lamenting and bewailing the loss of their so loving and
gracious Prince. The late costly shows, and stately Pagants, were turned into
sad objects: yea, no noise was heard through the whole City, but weeping
and lamentation, so that the sorrow sustained by the Trojans, for the loss of
their chief Champion Hector, when by the Greeks, at the commandment of
cruel Achilles, he was three times dragd about their City walls, being
before hand cowardly slain with his accursed Spear, was not to be compared
with this of Maiance. The grave and modest Matrons, were seen with their
garments rent, and their hair dispersed about their shoulders, in most
doleful manner to repair to the Temples, where before the most Highest, they
poured forth their prayers for their Sovereign, bathing themselves with the
tears which fell from their eyes. The young damsels pleasant songs, which with
clear and cheerful breasts they were wont to record, were now turned into sad
and mournful ditties, bewailing the loss of their Countries protector. Yea,
so general was the grief unto all manner of estates, that for the space of
forty days together, there was neither shops opened, nor any wares or
merchandise sold in their markets. So that the town, which was wont to be so
filled with all sorts of people, now seemed in a manner to be void and
desolate, none, or very few seen at any time to walk in the streets. Neither
was the grief in the country any less, yea throughout the whole kingdom: so
generally was he beloved of all his subjects, yt he was counted not only a
just Prince, but also a loving Father to his Country, always defending the
poor from the oppression of the rich, and the desolate widows and Orphans,
from the violence of those, who by any means sought to wrong them.

Sir Henault, as we have before said, being returned to Maiance, caused
forthwith some small Barks to be well manned and sent forth after the
Pirates, with command not only to scour their own Coast, but also to pursue
the^ unto the borders of France: where they took many, but could not meet
with any of the^ which they sought for. Then calling a general Counsel of all
the Nobility and Peers of the Land, where after a long and learned Oration by
him pronounced, describing unto them, the fickle and dangerous estate wherein
their Country now stood, by reason of this sudden and unlooked for alteration
of crooked Fortune, with the mutabilitie of the minds of the common people,
whose natures are always to listen after novelties. which things being
considered, it could not choose but to appear impossible, to keep the
Commonwealth in safety: without some certain form of government to be
established. Desiring all of them to bend and join their willing minds
together, to devise some course or means for the same, until the King might
again be heard of and recovered. Which he thought could by no means better
be effected, then by a general search made by a chosen number of Knights, who
should travel through all the Dominions and kingdoms of Christendom, and
elsewhere, as by them it should be thought fit and convenient: of which
number, he himself God willing intended to be one, who would either find him
out, or end his days in the search.

This his speech was listened unto of all, but especially applauded and
commended by the Lord Gwaltero, and the Lord Menew, who as then were
indifferently recovered of their wounds, which they received at the loss of
their King: and being both young and valerous, especially Gwaltero, who was
then the absolute best Knight in all the kingdom of Denmark, hoped by this
means not only to find out their King, if so be he lived, but also to win
to themselves eternal renown, by their haughty deeds of Chivalry, which
they hoped to obtain in strange Countries, where their fortunes should conduct
them. But as for the government of the Commonwealth, in their conceits, they
thought none more fit then Sir Henault himself, who being both sage and
discreet, and also being as we have said before, Lord Treasurer, and always
in great favor with their late King, had in a manner the whole managing of the
affairs of the Kingdom in his own hands, by which means, as they supposed,
he knew how, better then any other, to continue the same in the former estate,
which would be far better then to alter the same, by any other order of
government.

This their opinion was held for current of many, and consented unto by most of
those that were present, who desired no alteration, but thought their former
manner of rule to be best, and without fault.

But as there is no man so virtuous, but shall have some that will envy at his
goodness, especially great and mighty men, who no sooner grow into the good
liking and favor of the people, be it by never so just or well deserved
occasion, (yea though by him only the Commonwealth has been in a manner
preserved and defended from the inuasiue power of their enemies, (yet shall you
have some, like dogs in a manger, that will neither do good themselves, nor
willingly hear of others well doings,) being pricked forwards with envy, will
not stick to turn any his good deseruings into evil, and all their counsels,
be they never so profitable to the Commonwealth, they will go about to
persuade, that it is rather to benefit and raise themselves, then to do good
to their Countries: yea further, let them accomplish any notable piece of
service for their country, they will not be afraid to whisper into men's ears,
that it was done but for vain glory.) Even such there were in this Counsel,
who not only for envy, disliked the choice which the Lord Gwaltero and the
rest had made, but also disliked of the search which Sir Henault had motioned
for the seeking of the King, alleging that by making such a quest, they should
not only dispoyle themselves of their chief Captains and leaders, but also
leave their Country naked, and ready for every invasion of the enemy, when it
would be too late to call home those for their defense whom they should not
know where to find. Some again thought it better to send forth Ambassadors
into diverse Nations, thereby hoping to gain knowledge, what was become of him:
thinking that if the Out-lawes had kept him alive, that then they had sold him
to some Prince, who would be content to put him to ransom. Others held, that
to send forth spies, which by diligent inquiry might hear of him, would be
the best course. Thus diverse men were of diverse minds, sitting a long while in
counsel to no end, neither determining any order for the government of the
Commonwealth, nor means to find out their King and Queen. But at length, by
the means of the Archbishop of Maiance, who desired change and alteration,
they grew to determine of their government, which should be in this manner
following.

First, they should choose of the most sufficienst of the Nobility, and Laity
of the Realm, the number of sixe-score, out of which number by lot they should
choose ten, and of the Clergy thirty, out of which number likewise they
should choose two by lot, so that of the Nobility there should be always ten,
and of the Clergy two, which twelve so elected, should have the government of
the whole kingdom for a year, and at the years end, to give up an account
unto the other sixe-score and eighteen, of the employment of the treasure
belonging to the Crown: and then other twelve to be chosen in the same manner,
for the next year. And this order and manner of government to be kept
inuiolate, until such time as they should hear some certain news, either of
the Kings death, or return. To this they all consented, setting thereto their
hands and seals, presently making choice of those whose hap should be first
to govern this their new devised state. The Lots being cast, the first twelve
to whom the government lighted, was of the Clergy, the Archbishop of Maiance,
and the Bishop of Odelstoe: and of the Nobility, the Duke of Louenborge, the
Duke of Newmister, ye Lord Harding, the Count Hermes, the County of Mildorpe,
the County of Opencade, the Lord of Londen, the Lord Itzenho, the Lord of
Newstat, and the Lord of Rensborge. These twelve, according to former
agreement, took on them the government of the kingdom, first setting all
things in quiet within the kingdom, and making diverse laws and statutes for
the preservation thereof. And then made preparation for the defending of the
same, if so be yt any neighbor Prince should now in the alteration of their
government, make any war or invasion upon them, thereby not to be taken
unprovided. They therefore fortified diverse Castles, and strong Holds upon the
borders of the Kingdom, repairing those that were weak, and erecting new
where they thought any need to be, placing garrisons in them all, for ye
defense thereof. Likewise they took order, for the defense and sure keeping of
the Country of Flaunders in their subjection, fearing least upon the report of
the loss of the King and Queen, there might be some alteration moved, either
by some neighbor Potentate, or the inhabitants themselves, who at that time
were given altogether, to desire change and alteration.

Now amongst all these discourses we must not forget the Lord Gwaltero, the
Lord Menew, and Sir Henault, whose heroicke minds not being able to be
contained within the confines of Denmark, missing their only comfort and
solace, their noble Prince, whose presence was more dear to them, then any
thing in the world besides: provided according to their former determinations,
to travel in his quest throughout the whole world, but that they would either
find him out, or hear some certain news of him, which being made known, to
diverse other Lords and Knights, there were to the number of a hundred, all of
the mind, bent either to find him out, or never to return. Thus every one in
the best manner they could, made preperation for their journey, fitting
themselves both with armor, and store of money for their needful expenses in
their travel. And being all in a readiness to depart, they divided themselves,
some into one Country, and some into another, appointing where many times to
meet, being in strange Countries, where we will leave them, to declare what
befell to the King and Martinus, being in his enemies Country, as is before
mentioned.

CHAP. V. How King Frederick, was delivered by Martinus, into the the hands of
Griffory, by whom he was imprisoned, and how Martinus by the Duke was
afterward put to death.
YOu have heard before, how Martinus had agreed with Griffory of Holland, for
the delivery of the good King Frederick, in recompense whereof, he should have
for term of his life, the City of Hanstance, withal the customs and
profits thereof.

The next day after this conclusion, the Duke going along with him to
Hanstance, where being arrived, was by Martinus brought into the Burgesses
house, where he left the King, who according to his oath he found there still
remaining, little fearing that which suddenly happened unto him, for Martinus
coming unto him, and taking him by the hand, as if he would have conferred
with him about his ransom, brought him at length into a chamber, whereas he
had left the Duke, accompanied with some few of his nobillitie, unto whom
Martinus spoke as follows.

Most high and mighty Prince, according unto my faithful promise made unto
your excellency, I here before these your nobillity, deliver up into your
hands, this unfortunate and unhappy King of Denmark, of whom you may now at
any time, be fully and sufficiently revenged, of any former wrong by him
committed against you, or of any displeasure, which worthily you have conceived
against him, and likewise so clip his wings, for ever hereafter being able, to
do you the least offense whatsoever.

When the Duke had heard him speak this his pleasing, and to him most
delightful speech, scarce suffering him to make his conclusion, having also in
the mean time thoroughly viewed the King, whom by diverse signs he verily knew
to be the same, he could scarce content himself, but would immediately have
slain him with his own hands, so deadly was the hate he bare him, and such
the inciuillitie of his churlish and reuengfull nature: yet being stopped by
some of his nobility from killing him, he fell out into these or such like
railing speeches. O thou most accursed and vild caitife, whom were it not (that
I mean to put thee to more extreme pain and torments,) I would with these my
hands, rent that detestable body of thine to pieces, and with my teeth tear
and gnaw the flesh from thy bones, so endless is my malice against thee, and
so many thy wrongs and villainies committed, which causes me to muse and
invent, what or how many kind of torments, I might inflict upon thee. But would
to God that disloyal strumpet, that infernal Queen, the causer of all my
miseries, yea she whose bewitching beauty, thou so much and with such a
greediness have desired, yea and by thy comurations, and other thy detestable
and execrable means, thou have hetherunto to thy content inioyed: O that she
were here present, to behold and take part of those continual pains and
torments, the which not only for the hate I bear thee, but also to be
revenged on her, for her most odious, whorish, and execrable dissimulation
toward me, I mean to inflict upon thy wretched carkas.

The good King being no longer able to forbear, these inhumane and oprobrious
reuilings, proffred him by his currish and spightfull enemy, replied in this
sort: Griffory I cannot but muse, how God having endued thee, with reason and
understanding like unto other men, that thou notwithstanding, should abound
in vicious, wicked, and detestable conditions above all other men, which can
not be content with the misery, which thou see me brought into, being thy
prisoner, and at thy disposition, to be either kept or ransomed, wrought by the
most base and odious means that might be, yea after such a sort, that the
beriest Infidel under the heavens, would not so much as once have gone about
or imagined, but also now (contrary) to all humanity, reuilest me with such
oprobrious speeches, whom heretofore thou durst not to look me in the face
for fear, and also revile at her, whom neither thy self, nor no man living is
able to touch with yt least crime whatsoever, and that would I make good
against she, and three of the best of thy Knights with my body, were I at
liberty, having horse and armor. It Is true, it is true, replied the Duke, we
know your valor to be great, but we will soon abate that your hot courage,
and place you where your Goddess whom you so much esteem, shall neither have
power, nor means to help you.

Do thy worst replied the King, and since it is the will of God to inflict this
punishment upon me, I will endeavor my self with patience, to endure what
torments soever shall happen, hoping in the world to come, to enjoy therefore
eternal blessedness: but in ye mean time think not thou, but that thou
may fall in like mishap, and that I have yet remaining in the Kingdom of
Denmark such Subjects, that when they shall know of this my ill fortune and
thy cruelty, will not leave bearing Arms, till such time they shall have laid
wast, this thy accursed Country, not leaving thee any Town, or Fort to hide
thy self, from their reuengefull swords: wherefore advise thee, and determine
either to set me at liberty, or otherwise expect those evils, which will
surely fall on thy Country. If thou consent to my enlargement, for my ransom
thou shall receive a whole million of gold, which shall be paid thee
forthwith out of my treasury.

No, no, replied Griffory, thy gold is but dross, and cannot work in me that
content, which my heart shall enjoy by thy imprisonment, neither do I fear thy
power which thou so much vauntest of, for thou shall see, and that shortly,
that I will not only possess my self of thy darlings County of Flaunders,
but also by the strength of this right arm, in despite of all thy power,
Crown my self King of the Kingdom of Danske, whilst thou in the mean time,
shall lie rotting thy bones in my prison. The^ turning about to a Knight of
his, named Sir Ragdand, he willed him to convey the unhappy King prisoner
unto his Castle of Coruew, and there to put him into the dungion of the said
Castle, and to allow him every day, for the continuance of his most wretched
life, a quart of water, and apound of bread, made of the coursest branne,
thinking this, that continually pining away by reason of his course fair,
would be a far greater pain and torment unto him, then any present death
whatsoever. Likewise for the more sure keeping of him, he ordained a guard of
fifty Knights, always to be within the Castle, who should see that no Knight
should enter therein. This Castle of Coruew, was of marvelous strength,
environed about with deep ditches, and mighty heigh walls, and had but only
one way in, which was over a draw bridge, the which was always defended by
ten of the said fifty Knights, five at ye one end, and five at the other, this
guard grew at length to a custom, by reason of the hundred Knights of Denmark,
which went in search of their King, and was devised only to entrap and imprison
them, as you may read toward the latter end of this book. Here now will we
leave the woeful King enclosed in a miserable prison, bewailing his cross
fortune, where he passed away many a year, and although his fare was as we
have said before both course and short, yet did God so bless him, that he
continued always healthy and strong of body, never grieved with any kind of
sickness, saving only discontentednesse of mind, which with patience he much
delayed, and return we to speak of Martinus, (who had not long after the
imprisonment of the King, quietly inioyed the city of Hanstance, withal the
profits thereof before granted him, to the extreme grief of the chiefest of
the City, who disdained much to be in subjection to so base a person,) for
the Duke, some eight days after possession delivered, fell in consideration
with himself, of the great benefit which he had lost, by giving away the
chief City in his Dukedom, devised which way he might with his honor recover
the same again: at length having resolved with himself, he brought it thus to
pass.

One day being with diverse of his Nobility, and Martinus being in company,
the Duke fained himself to be very merry, and in his mirth, for his further
content, desired Martinus to declare, how he happened to take Frederick
prisoner. Martinus not distrusting any thing, began to make a large repetition,
beginning with his former life in France, then the cause and manner of his
banishment, and their ariuing in Denmark, with their robbery and murder,
committed in the Forest of Maiance, with their cruel storm sustained at Sea,
as is before declared, by which they were put on that Coast, and lastly, the
profer of a hundred thousand pound by the King, which he refused, only to
pleasure the Duke. All which when Griffory had attentively listened unto, he
suddenly start up from the place where he sat, commanding the standers by to
lay hands on Martinus, saying that it was not lawful to suffer such a one, who
had so many ways deserved death, as by his own confession did appear,
neither to live, nor to be accepted into the society of men: wherefore he
willed the^ forthwith to lead him to the place of execution. Which when
Martinus perceived, and saw that the Tyrant was fully minded to execute,
whatsoever he had said, he fell down on his knees, desiring mercy, and
offering for the safeguard of his life, to redeliuer his right of the City of
Hanstance. But he who never was acquainted with mercy or compassion, doubtting
if he should pardon him his life, the whole world would condemn him of
injustice: and seeing he might as well by his death as his life enjoy his will,
answered, that by the Law he had deserved to die, and he being appointed by
God, to be a minister of justice, could do no less then cause the laws to be
executed: wherefore for an example to all others who for the desire of this
worldly gain, are content to betray the innocent, he was led to the market
place, and had his head smitten of. Now will we return to speak of the Queen
and her young son, whom we left in the Forest, being accompanied with
brute beasts.

CHAP. VI. How the Queen going into the Forest, lost her young son, for
whom she made great lamentation, and how he was found, and carried away by the
Duke of Saxony.
YOU remember, how the Queen and her little son, being still in the Cave,
were nourished by such meat as the Lion used to bring them: and many times for
her recreation, would go walk amongst the trees near adjoining to their
Cave. Thus continued she by the space of one whole year, never seeing other
company then the wild beasts: although there were diverse searches made through
the Forest, as well by the Knights that west in the quest of her and the King,
as also by others for diverse occasions. It happened one day that the Lion having
brought in a young Kidde, which he had taken, the Queen went forth to break
some wood to roast the same withal: and taking her young son with her, who by
this time was able a little to go and craule, and setting him down in the
sun whilst she went up and down, to break rotten bows and sticks for the
use aforesaid, thinking her child would continue quiet enough, playing with
such toys as she had left him, went somewhat far from the place. He in the
mean time, either being weary of his sport, or disliking the place where he
was, or more likely by the special will of God, who pitying his and others
mishaps, had otherwise determined of his bringing up, caused him to go from
place to place: so that by the time his Mother had provided her wood, and was
come to the place she left him in, he was gone astray clean out of hearing.
Which when she beheld, and had awhile called and sought after him, not knowing
what was become of him, a thousand imaginations came into her mind: sometimes
thinking some wild beasts had devoured him, then imagining again, that the
Lion seeing him in that place by himself, had carried him to the Cave, as
oftentimes he would be playing with him, and bear him from place to place:
and being a little comforted with this hope, she hasted her to the Cave,
where likewise she was deceived of her hope, which put her into such grief,
that not being able to contain herself on her feet, she fell into a
trance. Where we will leave her awhile, and declare what became of the child.
You shall understand, that the very same day, Mauris Duke of Saxony passing ye
Seas from England toward his own Country, was driven by force of weather
upon this Coast, where being safely arrived, with a few shyps of his Navy,
the rest being dispersed with the storm, and being weary of the Sea,
determined with some twenty or thirty Knights, and Gentlemen in his company,
to take some recreation and pastime in the Forest, which was hard adjoining
unto ye seaside where his ships then rode, as is declared in the first chapter
of this Book. So taking their horses and Armor, for fear of any danger which
might happen, they altogether set forth into the Forest, whereas they had not
long rode, before such time as a marvelous great Stagge appeared unto them,
which when Duke Mauris beheld, with his Lance in his hand, he set spurs to
his horse, willing the rest of his company to follow him, hoping by the
swiftnes of his horse to have slain the Stagge: which he pursued so far,
that at length he had lost the sight of all his company, and was entered so far
in the Forest, that he knew not well which way to return again, so thick
were the trees and bushes, and so many the small trodden paths which led two
and fro, made by the wild beasts.

Thus roming to and fro, fearing to loose himself, and hoping to find his
company, at length he passed by the place, where as the young child had
gotten himself by his crauling, whilst his Mother was gathering sticks (even
about the time that she good Lady was returned to the Cave to seek for him)
which when Duke Mauris beheld, he alighted down from his horse, and seeing it
to be so fair and no body nere it, he mused from whence it should come, or
by what means it might be brought into a place, so desert and void of humane
company: then taking the child up in his arms, and earnestly beholding it,
he thought that it did very much resemble his young son lago, who was then
about the age of 18 or 20 months old, wherefore after he had a while called
to see, whether any body would come to seek for the child, and saw that none
came, he mounted again on horse back, taking the child with him, determining
to have him nourished and brought up with his son, because they did so much
resemble and were so near of age, imagining that it might be some Gentleman's,
or Nobles man's child, that by some great misfortune was brought into this
extremity, thus sometimes musing of one matter, and so of another, he rod
onwards he knew not well whether, but by chance he happened on a small beaten
way, which brought him out of the Forest, almost at the same place where he
entered, where he found all his company in a great fear, and doubt what was
become of him, minding to have returned again into the Forest to seek for
him. But when they saw him coming, they were all filled with great joy, and
went to meet him, to whom he recounted all his adventure, and of the finding
of the child, which when they had heard, and beheld him, they much admired as
well his strange finding, as also the rareness of his beauty, then which they
imagined never to have seen any more accomplished: some imagining this, some
that, and all they knew not what, this past they away the time until they were
come, where their ships ancored, and going aboard the next day, having the
wind fair, and the seas indifferently calm, they set sail in so happy a
hour, that within four days after they arrived in the Duchy of Saxony, at
a port called Leton, from whence they rode toward the City of Brensweke,
where then the Duchess was remaining, of whom and the whole City, the Duke
was most lovingly received, and welcomed home, who presently after his coming
to the Palace, he demanded for his young son, who being brought before him,
he caused likewise the child which he found in the Forest to be brought also,
who being both together, a man might very hardly know the one from the other,
but that the Saxon Prince, was something the bigger, as being elder by six
months, hand had also as then somewhat the better cullor, being norished with
more wholsomer diet. After they had a while beheld and played with the
children, the Duke declared unto the Duchess, and rest of the Lords and Ladies
there present, the manner of his finding, as before is recited, and likewise
willed to have him brought up, as acompanion with his son, desiring the
Duchess to be as careful of him, as of her own, assuring her that his mind
gave him, how that the child was issued of a Noble blood: and because they
knew not by what name to call him, the Duke willed him to be called the
Gentleman of the Forest, which name we must use until such time, as fortune
shall make known, from whence he is proceeded. Here again will we leave
him, and return to speak of the Queen his mother, whom we left in a trance
in the Cave, where having line a long while, and at length come unto herself
again, and remembering the loss of her child, fell to weeping, and renting,
and tearing her face with her nails, pulling her hair from her head, and
cursing herself which had taken no better care of him: then coming forth of
the Cave, she went crying up and down, causing the woods to resound the echo
of her son, seeking whether she could in any place perceive, either by blood
or other sign, if he were devoured of the wild beasts, and finding none, she
fell again to seek in every bush, if happily he might be crept therein, but
all in vain bestowed she her pains good Lady, to seek for him which in that
place could not be found, for God had otherwise ordained, for the bringing up
of the child, as you have already heard, though unknown to the good Lady his
mother, who was now in such extreme grief, not finding nor knowing what was
become of her child, that she became as frantic, weeping, and crying, up and
down the Forest all that day, and most part of the night, till being forced
with weariness she sat down, and rested herself. Where sitting a while, and
contemplating her sorrows, one whiles there would come into her mind, the
remembrance of her husband, and her former estate, being in joy and
prosperity, the calling to mind whereof, did strike into her the greater
sorrow: for being in misery, there is no greater grief, then to call to
mind forepassed pleasures: then again, would come into her mind her vision,
which she saw in the Forest, and the hope of future joys, which thereby was
promised, which did somewhat again mittigate her sorrow, thus passed she
away all that night, in weeping and lamentations, neither caring nor thinking
what might become of her, so excessive was her grief.

CHAP. VII. How the Queen the next day got out of the Forest, and how she
placed herself in a Monestrie, near to the City of Maiance.
THE night being past, and beautiful Aurora coming again to the view of
this hither world, whose welcome the cheerful Birds rang forth, with many a
pleasant tune, to the comfort of all earthly creatures: the woeful Lady, who of
all the night had not once suffered her eyelids to close, nor given nature her
due by fleepe, rising up from the place where she had remained all night, began
again to renew her former sorrow, sometimes cursing and raging at her evil
fortune, then again blaming herself for her impatience, which was not able to
endure those crosses which God for her trial had laid upon her.

Thus at length somewhat comforted with the hope she had, that the providence
of the most Highest, might turn all her afflictions and crosses, into joys
and blessings, and likewise that in time, she might recover, according to the
Vision which she had seen at her first coming into ye forest, both her
husband and son, she determined to make trial if she might get forth of the
Forest which if she could; she would unknown travel unto some Monestary, or
religious house, where she meant to spend ye rest of her time to her souls
comfort: but first she determined to make trial if her husband were returned
or not. So happening on a by path, onwards she went so far, that by the time
that Phoebus golden Chariot was ascended into the middle heavens, she found
herself even at the place, where first in company of the King, and their
train of Lords and Ladies, she entered the wood, at such time as they were set
on by the Out-lawes. Where beholding the place, and calling to mind that there
began the head and wellspring of all her troubles, and miseries which she
had since that time endured, brake forth into these, or such like speeches.

O thou accursed place, reserved only of the divine powers to be a plague and
hell to those, who willingly not so much as in thought offended against them. I
beseech the Almighty protector of heaven and earth, that thou may for
euer-more prove barren and unfruitful, and that these thy goodly trees and
bushes, which were a covert unto those damned wretches, which separated me from
that peerlesse Prince and my dear love, may hereafter never bear neither
fruit nor leaves, but may presently wither away and die: as did that fig
tree which thou, O Savior Christ, did curse for not yielding of fruit in
ye time of thy hunger, going from Bethania to Jerusalem. Thus accursing that
place, and the whole Forest, she directed her course toward Maiance, where
by reason of her long absence, and the altering of her apparel, through time
and her best skill, she entered unknown of any, where she found such an
alteration, that she could scarcely believe that to be the City, which in
former time she had seen so much to flourish, in costly and brave shows: and
not knowing well what to imagine, she secretly inquired as well the cause of
this strange alteration, as also whether there were any certain news of the
Kings being alive or dead. All which at large was declared unto her, as well
the cause of sorrow, which generally did appear through all the City, for
the loss of the King, as also the new government of the state, which was
disliked of many: but whether the King were living or no, that was not known,
so secretly did that Tyrant Griffory cause his imprisonment to be conceald.

But at length, having made what inquiry she could, not minding to make her
self known, she returned again out of the City, and went unto a Monestary
some three miles distant, called the Monestry of our Lady, where coming to the
Gouernesse, she entreated to be entertained amongst the Religious Votaries.
Affirming herself to be a poor desolate widow, who being by death dispoyled
of all comfort, had determined to end the remnant of her life in prayer, and
thanksgiving unto her Creator, trusting thereby to find comfort for her soul
in the world to come. The Abbess being a very devout and religious woman,
marking not only her outward gesture, which was a plain demonstration of
inward grief, but also considering her rare beutie, which though it were not
set forth by any Art or abiliments, yet in that careless and covert sort, did
it appear to be most singular, demanded of her many questions, which she
answered in such good and modest sort, that she grew thereby in great liking,
and good opinion of her, entertaining her amongst the rest of her Sisters,
where she behaved herself in such good sort, that in short time she gained to
herself, not only the love of all the house, but also the fame of her godly
living, was spredde abroad through all the country adjoining, to the great
commendation, and famousing of the Monestry. Where we will leave her in her
godly meditations, and return a little to declare what happened to the Lord
Gwaltero, and Sir Henault, with the rest of their company, that took on them
the search of their King.

CHAP. VIII. How the Lord Gwaltero, the Lord of Menew, and Sir Henault, with
diverse others, were divided by a strange adventure: and what happened unto the
Lord Gwaltero thereby.
IT is to be remembered before, how the Lord Gwaltero, the Lord of Menew, and
Sir Henault, with diverse others, taking on them the search of their King, began
their journey from Maiance, resolving not to return with out some certain
news of him who^ they sought for: thus travailing on together through most
part of Denmark, they happened at length coming into a Forest, to meet a Squire
on horsback, making all the speed that possibly he might: ever looking
backwards, as if some body had pursued him. At length, meeting with the Lord
Gwaltero, and the rest of the company, who were in all to the number of twelve
Knights, besides their Squires, and thinking by the costly Armor which he ware,
him to be the chiefest in the company, alighted from his horse, and falling on
his knees, with the tears standing in his eyes, spoke as follows.

Most courteous Knight, for so much my mind assures you to be, I humbly
beseech you, and the rest of your company here present, for the honor of
knighthood, and the love that you ought to bear to all distressed Ladies and
Damsels, that you will do so much as succor and revenge a most beautiful
Lady, who even now in this Forest being travailing to a brothers house of
hers, some 3. leagues distance from her own, being accompanied with her
husband, my Lord and Master, and some four or five attendants more, whom I
fear me by this time are all neerehand slain, or grievously wounded, by a
rank Traitor, who having long time sued unto my Lady for lascivious love, and
not being able to maintain the same, by reason of her chaste and honest
denials: this morning, knowing that she was to pass this way, accompanied
himself with some ten or twelve, as wickedly disposed as himself, whom he
had made acquainted with his villainous pretense, unawares set upon us, and at
the first encounter grievously wounded my Lord, by reason he was unarmed,
having nothing but his sword to defend himself, as not douting any such evil.

Thus concluding his tale with whole floods of tears, which issued from his
sorrowful eyes, which moved pity in all the beholders, especially in the
Lord Gwaltero, who not long before had tasted the like mishap: willing ye
squire to stand up, and comfort himself, assuring him, that he had met with
those, who would revenge the wrong which he had declared unto them. Wherefore
willing him to show which way he should take, he set spurs to his horse, and
galloped as fast as he could, hoping to come soon enough to their succor:
which when the rest of his company beheld, they followed after as fast as they
could, but had not rodden long before they had lost sight of him, by reason of
the thickness of the wood, and the swiftnes of his horse, which was accounted
to be the best in all the Kingdom. Thus galloping onwards, at length he came
where ye way divided it self into three several paths, and taking that on the
right hand, as thinking it to be the right way, he rode on still, never
looking back for his company, so earnest was his mind, set on the rescue of
the Lady and her husband. The rest coming after, when they came unto the place
where the way divided it self, knew not well what to do, nor which way to
take, yet at length, being directed by the Squire, the most of them, as Sir
Henault, and the Lord of Menew, took that way which led directly forth
between the other two, appointing some to take the other ways to follow the
Lord Gwaltero, if peradventure he had missed in his way. Amongst which his
Squire, and two other Knights, the one named Sir Brewes, the other Sir Cadrus,
took the way which he before had roden.

The Lord Gwaltero, as we have said before, being pricked on with a desire
to rescue those which were distressed, made such have, that after he had passed
the place where the ways divided it self, and having rodden about two miles
from the place, met with a peasant driving of cattle before him, of whom he
inquired, whether he had seen any company thereabouts fighting? or any Knights
or gentlemen slain? The peasant made answer he saw no such, but some half a
mile before, he met four Knights crossing the way toward a little Castle,
some two leagues of, leading a very fair Lady pitifully weeping, who^ he
thought they constrained to go onwards against her will. When Gwaltero had
heard this, he assured himself that this was the same Lady whom he went to
rescue, wherefore demanding which way they went, the peasant showed him where
they were riding up a little hill, almost a mile before him, which when he
beheld, he spurred on faster then before he had done, so that before they
were attained unto the sight of their Castle, he had overtaken them in a fair
meddow, between two small hills. And calling to them, said, Traitors turn,
and deliver me that Lady, whom so villainously you have carried away, or your
lives shall pay my sword her ransom.

They hearing him call, and looking back, seeing but one Knight alone persuing
them, stayed, and he who led the Ladies horse by the raines, being a very
big and comely Knight, answered: foolish and most simple Knight, think thou
me so fond or faint hearted, that only at thy threats, who art able to perform
nothing but in words, I will deliver this my prize whom I have gotten so
hardly, and with the price of much blood, or that my love toward her is so
small, so lightly to part from her. No, no, I counsel thee rather for thy own
safeguard to depart away, or else this my Lance shall make your passe-port to
old Caron. Gwaltero hearing this, and being no longer able to endure those
braues, placed his Lance in his rest, and setting spurs to his horse, they
ran together like lightning, and at the encounter their spears slew into ye
air, Gwaltero passing on without any hurt at all, but the other Knight whose
name was Brandoll, being wounded a little in the left side, was so sore
astonished with the stroke, that he could hardly contain himself, from falling
from his horse: which Gwaltero perceauing, his carreare ended, returned again
with his sword in his hand, then meeting the one the other, there began a
fierce and doubtful combat, which had forthwith ended by a stroke that the
Lord Gwaltero gave him on the right shoulder, which was so mighty, that
breaking his pouldron, wounded him shrewdly in the shoulder, and sliding down
farther, cut him into the thigh, with pain whereof he fell from his horse:
which when the rest of his company beheld, all at once they assailed him,
charging him so roughly, that he was likely to have gone besides his Saddle,
had he not taken hold on the horse maine with his hands, but they had no great
cause long to boast thereof, for gathering all his forces together, and raising
himself in his stirrup, he took one of them so sound a blow on the Helm,
that the steel not able to keep out the stroke, claue his head to the teeth,
to the great discomfort of the rest. Who seeing one of their company slain,
and their Captain lying on the ground, in little better sort, determined
either to be revenged, or else to follow them in the like misfortune: raging
and chafing, ye one only Knight should be able to make resista^ce against them:
assaulted him more fiercely then they had done before. One of them whose Lance
remained whole, determined to charge him on the back, and coming behind him
with his full carreare, at such a time as he was raising himself in his
stirrups, to have stricken one that was before him, gave him such a cruel
stroke, that caused him tumble headlong over his horse neck, and had not his
Armor been exceeding good, that blow had made an end of the combat: but he
who was reserved for other purposes, feeling himself so cowardly stricken,
quickly recovered his feet, and defended himself valiently, though with more
disadvantage then before, whereby he received many wounds, and was likely to
have been overcome, for by this time Brandoll had again recovered his
scences, and seeing the Knight who had brought him into that case, to continue
still fighting, against his Knights, and had already slain one of them, being
urged forwards, both with shame and grief, taking his sword in his hand, he
ran upon him like a fierce unskillful mastiue, who being once tossed by the
sturdie bull, comes on more hastily then before: but Gwaltero perceauing him
coming, seeming to meet him lightly, made a thrust at one of the Knights
horses, which charged him on horseback, which thrust lighted so luckily, that
so piercing his belly, he caused him with his Master to tumble to the ground,
where by reason of one of his feet being in the stirrup, he could not so
suddenly rise again, by which means Gwaltero the more nasier dealt with
Brandoll, and the other Knight, who seeing his fellows mischance, dismounted
himself for fear of the like mishap: now grew the foot combat more hot and
fierce then that on horseback, by reason that Gwaltero perceauing himself
almost wearied, and fearing the coming of the other Knight, whose foot was in
the stirrup under his horse, laid on with all his might, but Brandoll being a
strong Knight as most in that Country, seemed to set light by his fury, and
charged him again with so many mighty blows, as well he gave him to
understand, that he knew better how to fight on foot, then on horseback.

The good Lady in the mean time sat weeping on her palfrie, being held by two
of Brandolls Squiers, ever praying and beseeching God, to preserve and defend
the strange Knight, whose virtue and prowess she much admired, and whom she
feared was not long able to endure the brunt of the battle, for that the
other Knight having recovered himself from under his horse, came likewise to
to the combat, to her great grief and sorrow. But casting away her head from
the sight of the battle, as loath to see the death of him, who had so
valiantly fought in her defense, she espied two Knights with a Squire, come
galloping as fast as their horses could run, whom she likewise feared to be
some of Brandolls company, but therein she was deceived as you shall hear in
the next Chapter.

CHAP. IX. How Sir Brewes, and Sir Cadrus, with the Lord Gwalteros Squire came
to his rescue, and how they conducted the Lady to her Castle.
SIR Brewes, and Sir Cadrus the two Knights, which took the way after the Lord
Gwaltero, accompanied with his Squire, thinking because he had taken the wrong
way, that he should have had no occasion of fighting, made the lesser speed
after him, until such time, that coming unto the top of the hill which he had
passed, where the peasant showed him the four Knights that led away the
Lady, from which place they beheld them fighting, and thinking that it might be
Gwaltero, they set spurs to their horses, and galloped so fast, that they
were come within the calling, even as the Knight who was hanging by the
stirrupe had recovered himself. Then Sir Cadrus cried to the said villains,
give over fighting with that alone Knight, and defend your selves from the
force of my Lance, and there with gave one of them so sound a buffet, that he
had no need at all to seek for a Surgion, for his Lance entering in at his
breast, passed through his heart almost a yeard. Sir Brewes ran at the other
and missed course, but turning again with his sword in his hand, gave him such
a blow on the head, that cleaving his Helm, and wounding him somewhat deep,
caused him half astonished to fall to the ground. Gwaltero seeing this
unexpected aid, being almost before in utter despair of victory, gave
Brandoll a sore blow on the right leg, and closing with him, by clean force
overthrew him to the ground, then setting his foot on his neck, he rased of
his Helm, and with one blow parted his head from his shoulders. And coming to
the other whom Sir Brewes had wounded, would have done as much for him, but
that he immediately fell on his knees, crying for mercy, protesting for ever
after to be at his command in all places whatsoever. Gwaltero upon this his
promise, granted him pardon, swearing him for ever after, not to offer wrong
nor violence, to any Lady or Gentlewoman.

Then turning to Sir Brewes, and Sir Cadrus, he gave them hearty thanks for
their succor, without which he had been doubtless slain. Demanding of them
likewise, what was become of the Lord of Menew, sir Henault, and the rest. And
they told him how they parted at the 3. ways, to go succor the Lady whom he
had so well rescued, telling him likewise, that they did admire how or by what
means the Lady was brought thither, seeing it was in the other way that led
directly forward that they set on her and her husband, as the Squire informed
them.

By this time the Lady being let go by the two Squiers that held her, (who
seeing their Master slain, made have by flight to save their own lives,
which they might easily do, for that no man pursued them,) came unto the Lord
Gwaltero, and falling on her knees before him, gave him most humble thanks, as
well for the safeguard of her own honor, which she esteemed far before life,
as also for revenging her husbands death: whom Brandoll in the former fight had
slain, with some two or three of their servant, who put themselves in their
defense, with all, offering him many large proffers for reward. But Gwaltero
taking her by the hand, raised her from the ground, willing her to be of good
comfort, assuring her whatsoever he had done for her, was but his, and the
duty of every good Knight, and therefore willed her to attribute it, not to
him but to God, who is the revenger of all wrongs: and to account of him but as
an instrument, appointed by God to minister justice on those murderers. Then
the Lady entreated him and the rest, to conduct her unto a Castle of hers,
some two leagues of, where she would entreat them to rest themselves, until
such time as his wounds were thoroughly cured, which should be done by a
damsel of hers, very expert in the Art of Surgery. Unto which request, they
easily consented, especially the Lord Gwaltero, whose heart was already wounded
with the Ladies beutie. Then binding up his wounds as well as they could, they
mounted on horseback, directing their course toward the foresaid Castle, and
the better to pass away the time, Gwaltero began to question with the Lady
of many matters, especially of the cause of the late combat, which she
declared unto him, with such a modest and comlie grace, that he being before
a little wounded with Cupids shaft, was now so altogether overcome with love,
that either he must needs sue for grace, or die by concealing his affection:
so fervent was the flame, and so weak his resistance.

By this time were they passed most part of their way, and were come unto the
Castle, even about the time, that the Sun drawing into the West, seemed to
take leave of the view of these hither Regions, where by the Lady they were
most kindly received: and welcomed with such cheer, as the suddennes of the
time could afford. After Supper, the Lord Gwaltero being brought into a most
goodly and fair Chamber, had his wounds carefully looked unto, and dressed.
Then being laid in a rich bed, imbrodred very costly with gold and pearl,
and curiously wrought with imagry, and other sumptuous shows, where being
laid, the good Lady courteously bad him good night, willing him to command for
all things in the Castle as his own. Then departing away, leaving him in a
world of imaginations, she took order for the interring of her Husbands
body, which the next day was effected with great solemnity, according to the
custom of the country then used.

CHAP. X. How Gwaltero, with his company, staying the healing of his wounds,
made his love known to the Lady, with his success therein, and of his
departure in his quest.
THE Lord Gwaltero and his company, staying the curing of his wounds, which
were most carefully looked unto, and dressed by the same Damsel which had them
in cure, was every day visited continually by ye Lady of the place, who showed
herself so thankful unto him, that she almost never would depart from his
presence, which bred in him such ardent desire, that not being able longer to
conceal his love, one day she being sitting by his bedside, none being in
presence, but his Squire, and the damsel that attended his wounds, taking her
by the hand, and fixing his eyes steadfastly on her face, said.

Gracious Lady, I do not know, nether can I immagine, how these my speeches,
which at this time I shall be forced to vetter, may be by you accepted, yet
trusting in the gentleness of your kind nature, have made choice rather to
open my grief unto you, then by concealing thereof, or ever to languish in
pain. Know then, that since the first time it was my hap (when I fought with
Brandoll and his company) for to see you, that then your rare and singular
beauty, wounded me more far deeper, then did either their swords or Lances,
which since by your continual courtisies, and by your many exquisite virtues,
which I have behold in you, are so much augmented and increased, that unless
you of your excellent bounty, take pity and compassion on me, and with speed
yield some relief, unto this my oppressed passions, I know not what to expect
save death only, which if you should prove pitiless, it would be most
welcome unto me: wherefore let me entreat you, to consider these my passions,
and to ease them with pity, and thereby shall you gain unto your self for
ever, a true Knight, and a constant lover. Thus concluding his speech with a
most deep sigh, proceeding from the bottom of his heart, he remained silent,
attending her answer, which should be to him either as life or death, to which
she replied.

My Lord, I cannot but muse at this your discourse, neither can I choose but
smile, to see your honor so merrily disposed, to jest at me in this kind of
sort, hoping that mirth is a sign of ye amendment of your wounds, which to me
would be most joyful, seeing that in my defense you received them. But if
these your speeches proceed from you in earnest, know then, that the beauty
which you say has inflamed you, in my conceit is of no such force, as to wound
a man of your worth, neither is it likely that so sudden a liking as you speak
of, should be able to work any such effect, if my courtesies have been the
cause, they were never more then you deserved, and therefore to be esteemed by
you as a debt due from me to be paid: if my virtues which you speak of, they
alas are so few, and small, that they are not to be accounted of, but yet such
I hope, which rather should give you an occasion, to seek to others, then any
show to yield unto your lawless love: for know for a suerty yt Menea, for so
was she called, regards more her honor and good name, then she does all the
riches or wealth of this world, knowing the one to be but momentarie, the other
perpetual: wherefore I beseech your honor to give of these vain suits. But if
you seek to enjoy me as your wife, which I think you will take scorn of, I
being but a poor Lady, and descended but of a mean Parentage, in respect of
your Lordship, yet notwithstanding consider I beseech you, the late death of my
husband, whom if I should so soon forget, it would for ever be accounted a
great ignomie, and shame unto me.

The Lord Gwaltero, at these last speeches interrupting her, replied, most
beautiful Lady, think not that I go about any way to dishonor you, neither
that those my former speeches to be fained, but whatsoever I have spoken to
proceed from the sincerity, and bottom of my harf, which is, and for ever
shall remain yours, whilst the fates shall permit me to enjoy this breath,
which I wish no longer to continue, then I remain your faithful and constant
Knight protesting before the almighty God: never to accept of any other wife,
so you thereto consent, in witness whereof, I here deliver you this ring:
then taking a fair Diamond from one of his fingers, he would have put it on
hers, but she withdrawing her hand, made him answer, that she had made a
solemn vow to God, which she was minded to perform, which was, that for one
whole year, she would never consent to marry with any one whatsoever, but if
it pleased his Lordship, so to esteem of her, as to accept her for his wife,
at the end of that appointed time which she had set: he should find her most
ready and willing to obey unto his will, in any that might not be to her
dishonor.

Gwaltero gladded to the heart, with this heavenly conclusion, and being as one
newly revived out of some dead trance, took her in his arms and kissed her,
protesting that he would most willingly remain so contented, until the fixed
time were expired, and then God willing, he would return and espouse her: in
ye mean time he entreated her, to accept of that his small Ring, which should
be a cause for her to remember him by, which she then most willingly accepted,
and in requital thereof, gave unto him a Jewel of hers, which he always
after either in Tilt or Turnie wore, being fastened in the crest of his Helm,
and which at all times put him in mind of his Lady and Mistress. Thus by the
coming in of Sir Cadrus, and Sir Brewes, with diverse Gentlemen and Damsels,
which came to see the Lord Gwaltero, their love talk gave over for that time,
entertaining the others with diverse pleasant and merry discourses, wherewith
they accustomed to pass away the time, ever thinking it long till they might
be in their former quest, which was the sooner, for that Gwaltero being
comforted, with the hope of future pleasure and content, was healed much the
sooner of his wounds, so that within fifteen days, he was able to bear
Armor: and finding himself indifferent strong, took order with the rest of
his company, the next day to depart onwards, on their way toward the confines
of Denmark, where they hoped to have some joyful tidings of him whom they
sought, or at least ways to meet again with the Lord Menew, and Sir Henault,
whom the Lord Gwaltero dearly loved. Thus having taken order for the preparing
of their iourny, the next day they all took their leave of their kind hostis:
and Gwaltero taking her aside, desired her with the tears standing in his
eyes, to be mindful of her former promise, assuring her, if God did grant him
life and liberty, he would return against the fixed time by her appointed, to
solemnize their marriage, in the mean time he would commend her into the
protection of the almighty God. But she good Lady, not being able to speak for
weeping, held him about the neck, often kissing him, as one loath so soon to
forgo his company, yet at the last, seeing no remedy, entreated him to
remember her and his promise, until which time of his return, she would spend
her days in prayer, for his safe and prosperous success. Thus departed these
two Lovers, whom we will leave for a while, to speak of other matters.

CHAP. XI. How the Lord of Menew and Sir Henault, happened to arrive in the
City of Parris, and of the Turnie there proclaimed by the Duke of Orleance.
THe Lord of Menew, and Sir Henault, taking the direct way which they were
informed, to rescue the Lady, and her husband, rode on a great pace, till such
time that coming unto the place, where the battle had been fought but a
little before, found ye dead bodies of the ancient Knight, and diverse of his
servants: but for the murderers, they could not know what was become of them,
because they had taken a bie and unknown way, which led them as before is
said, unto their destruction. Wherefore taking their way toward the next
Town, they rode on hastily, minding to stay there until they might hear some
news of the Lord Gwaltero, whom they imagined would likewise arrive there, the
next day at the farthest. But hereof being deceived by reason of the occasions
before recited, after they had remained there some three days looking for him,
they departed toward the Seaside, and coming to a Town called Forefront,
they found diverse Ships bound to several coasts, wherefore dividing their
selves, some to one Country, some into another, the Lord of Menew, and Sir
Henault, being loath to part company, shipped themselves for France, hoping
there either to find him whom they sought for, or else to purchase fame by
their prowess within that Kingdom: and sooner then in any other might it be
obtained, if they showed themselves valerous, by reason of ye continual
tournaments, which were daily used there by the Nobles, and Knights of tha
region. And being shipped, and having wind at will, they set sail so
prosperously, yt within eight days after they landed at Calice: where they a
while stayed, as well to refresh themselves after their coming from the Sea,
as also to view the Town and Country thereabouts, and to make inquiry, if
peradventure they might hear of him, in whose Quest they went.

Thus having stayed there twelve or fourteen days, not learning any news at
all of their unfortunate King, they took their way toward the royal City
of Paris, where the King then kept his Court, with a great assembly of Lords
and Ladies, which were then drawn together to behold a great Turny, proclaimed
by the Duke of Orleance, by the Kings consent, against all strangers: the
occasion of which Turny grew by this means. The Duke being a lusty young
Knight, was inamoured on ye Kings eldest daughter, a most beautiful and goodly
Lady, who for her grace, virtues, and beauty, had not her equal in all the
kingdom of France, being called Emilia, whose perfections had so entangled
his heart, that he could not by any means free himself from being thrall to
her beauty: and thinking no means better to win a fair Lady, then by
showing himself valiant, he continually frequented Tylts and Turnyes,
oftentimes carrying away the cheifest prizes of valor: which was a means not
only to obtain great love, and favor of the King, but also drew to him some
liking of his Lady and Mistress, the Princes Emilia, which she sometimes would
make show of, by her kind countenance, and pleasant speeches to him: which
courtesies put him in such an exceeding hope, and pride withal, that thinking
himself half sure of her love, and that being grast with the same, no man
was able to compare with him, neither in happiness nor valor: one day
perceiving the King to be walking alone, in a pleasant and delightful Garden,
adjoining to the Palace, came unto him, and falling into some conference with
him, at last entreated his Majesty to grant him leave to proclaim a Turny,
which he, and some certain number of Knights of the Court, would defend
against all comers, for the space of 3 days. And that after, by the space of
six days more, he himself would keep the field, and defend against all
comers, his Mistress the Princess Emilia, to excel all others in beauty,
whatsoever.

The King hearing his demand, and considering the great danger which thereby
might happen to him, dissuaded him from it, assuring him, that it would be
impossible to continue against so many, as would hazard themselves in that
enterprise: and that although he by his valor might overcome many hardy and
gallant Knights, yet at length, being weary, and tired with overmuch labor,
might peradventure be vanquished, by one inferior to those whom before he had
subdued, whereby he should lose his former reputation, gotten with no small
perrill and danger. This and many other matters, did the King allege unto him,
to cause him to give over that enterprise. But he being as is before said, so
puffed up with a self conceit, and assurance of Fortunes favor, imagining
that on whom Venus smiled, Mars would not seem to frown, continued still
very importiue, till at length, the King being overcome by his earnestness,
granted to his suit. Presently causing Heraults and messengers to be sent
abroad into diverse places, to give notice thereof: that every one which
desired to try his fortune in his Loves commendation, might be there to make
trial at the day appointed.

In the mean time, the Duke ordained a place for the Tylt-yard, which was hard
adjoining to ye Palace, which he caused to be environed in with railes of
great height, appoynting at each end a large gate or entrance, that ten
Knights on horseback might enter in front. The space within the rayles, was of
that bigness, so that 5000 knights might well turny togethers, and round about
were scaffolds erected for the beholders to sit on, saving that part next to
the Palace, which was open for the King, the Queen, and their Lord and
Ladies, who standing in the windows, and battlements of the Palace, might
with more safety behold the Turny. Likewise he caused another place to be
enclosed, with only one gate or entrance, hard adjoining to the part of the
Palace, where the King with the rest, might more conuenietly stand, to behold
the single combats which by him should be foughten: and at the other end, he
caused a rich Tent to be pight, which was of Blew velvet, set thick with
stars of gold, and Flowre-deluces, showing that he was descended from the
blood royal. Upon the top thereof stood Cupid, all naked, with his bow and
arrowe in his hand, aiming directly at a fair picture of Marble, which stood
fast by the said Tent: on the top whereof was placed the portrature of the
beautiful Princess Emilia, which was so artificially made, that it seemed to
be the princess herself: under whose feet were diverse places made, for
placing of their pictures, whose Knights should be over come by the Duke.

In this sort was all things ordained against the turnie, when the Lord Menew,
Sir Henault, and diverse other Knights, came into the City, some two days
before the Turny began, where they took up their lodging in an honest
Burgesses house, making preparation for such things as they should want against
the day.

CHAP. XII. How the Duke, and the rest of the Lords and Knights bare themselves
in the Turny, and how Prince Edward the last day bare away the Prize.
THe day being come that the Turny should begin, and many Knights, and great
Lords of diverse Countries come thither, some only to see, others to prove
themselves therein. The Duke of Orleance, as chief Challenger, accompanied with
the Duke of Aniowe, the Lord Mompenscer, the Duke Robert of Normandy, the
Marshall de Berone, Francis the young Prince of Condy, together with two
thousand other Knights, entered the Lists at one end, at the other entered
Charles the young Prince of Spain, accompanied with Edward Prince of England,
the Duke of York, the Lord Mowbray, the lord Dowglasse of Scotland, the County
of Zeland, the lord Mongomery, the young Henry of Burbon, two French lords, who
because they were not entreated by the Duke, and partly by reason they meant to
prove themselves against him, in the behalf and trial of their Mistrisse
beauty, entered the field against him, with the number of two thousand, taking
their places as he before had done.

The King and Queen being placed, all the other princes, Lords, and Ladies,
took also their places, where Emilia sitting amongst the rest, seemed like
Cinthia, placed amongst the lesser Stars, being in the fulness of her power:
or like Diana following her chase through the woods and launes, accompanied with
her train of Nimphs, whose pain in pursuit, had raised in her Alablaster
cheeks, a lively vermilion die: so seemed the beautiful Princess, having in
her well proportioned face, the lovely rose and lilly, striving for
maisterdome, which caused the lusty young Duke to be of such a courageous
mind, that not being able longer to desist from the battle, desired the Duke
of Britain, and the County Palatine of Rene, who were appointed Judges of the
field, to cause the signal of battle to begin, which was presently done, by
the sound of a trumpet, and the Heraults crying to the Knights, every man to
do his best.

Then ran together, the Duke of Orleance, and Edward Prince of England, and
met so fiercely together, that the Duke breaking his Lance on his enemies
shield, caused him to stagger, and had he not taken hold by his maine, he had
gone to measure his length on the ground, but the English Prince met him with
no lesser might, for piercing his shield, his Lance lighted on his Gorget,
causing him to loose both his stirrups, and with his head almost to touch the
pummel of his saddle, which being seen by the King, was greatly commended: the
Prince Charles of Spain, and Robert of Normandy met likewise, and breaking
their spears, past on without once moving on the other, the Marshall of
Berone, was dismounted by the Lord Mowbray, but rescued by the Duke of Aniow
and others. By this time were the greatest part of the Knights met together, so
that the clouds seemed to be covered, with the splinters of the Lances which
were broken many on both sides were unhorsed, and again remounted by their
fellows, there might you have seen some using swords, other maces of Iron:
twice that day was ye Prince Charles, beaten from his horse, and again
remounted by the Duke of York, and Henry of Burbon. The Lord Douglas, this day
showed, that the Scots were not much inferriour unto any Nation for feats of
Chivalry, for being acompanied with the Lord Montgomerie, the Lord of Menew,
Sir Henault, the County of Zeland, and some ten or twelfe other Knights,
beat down all those which put themselves against them, which being seen to
the Duke of Orleance was worse the^ death, who being held very short by Prince
Edward, the Lord Mowbray and others, so that he could hardly help any others,
yet seeing the havoc which was made by the Scot and his company, fearing
least they were prevented, he should loose the day: set spurs to his horse,
and with his sword in his hand made such way, that at last he came where they
were, and lifting up his sword, gave ye Scottish Earl such a blow, that
brusing his Helm, caused him to fall besides his saddle, which blow being
seen by Sir Henault, was likewise partly revenged: for with one blow which he
struck, he cleft the Dukes shield, and sliding downwards, wounded his horse
in the shoulder. In the mean time the Spanish, and English Princes with their
company, were like to have won the day, for that ye French, no longer able
to endure their extreme blows, began for to turn their backs: which being
perceived by the Judges, they forthwith caused the retreat to be sounded,
thereby to save the Challengers from shame. Then departed every man the Lists
for that night, returning to their lodgings, to refresh themselves against the
next day: the King to show the more honor unto ye strange Princes, sent for
them, desiring them for that night, to sup and rest themselves in his Palace:
unto which many of them consented, where at supper they were roially feasted,
and welcomed by the King and Queen. And after the Tables being with-drawne,
they fell to dancing, masking, and courting of the Ladies and damsels: where
the young Prince Edward dallying with the fire, was scorched by the flame, for
taking the Princes Emilia by the hand to dance, after they had ended their
measure, fell to court her with pleasant speeches, which she still most
wittily answered, which Cupid beholding, wounded his heart with a poisoned shaft
of love, turning his jest into earnest: thus past they away most part of the
night in dancing and reuelling, until such time, that Jove his eternal
lamps, wherewith he lights the nether world were half spent, and Atlas moist
daughters strove into the Ocean deep, to drive their weary drove: then departed
these to their beds, where every one quietly took their rest, except the
English Prince, who of all the night could not enjoy any sleep, so sorely did
the remembrance of his new love torment him, sometimes determining to ask her
of her Father, then thinking the Duke to have a former promise of her, seeing
he undertook the defense of her beauty, was minded to fight with him for her,
hoping either to kill him, and so to get her, or else by vanquishing him, to
win away her love. With these and many such like imaginations, past he away
the wearisome night, until about the break of the day, Somnus seized on his
ouer-watched eyes: so that he slept until the sun was two degrees from the
earth ascended, then rising up he apparrelled himself, and went down into
the great Hall, where he found the King, withal the other Princes and great
estates, ready to go to the Chapel, to hear divine service: whether
likewise he accompaned them, afterward returning to the Palace, they found
the Tables covered for dinner, where they were all served according to their
estates, with most costly and dainty cates. Dinner being ended, every one went
to arm themselves for the Turnie: where the strangers bare themselves so
valiently, that they won the honor from the Courtiers, which was such an
extreme grief unto the Duke of Orleance, that for that night he would not
come to the Palace, vowing the next day to be revenged, especially on the
English Prince and his company, who twice that day had beaten him from his
horse. Most part of the rest spent the time, as they did the night before in
dancing, and such like pastime, where again the English Prince, found means
to Court his Lady, declaring unto her his love and affection: but she, who as
yet was another ways minded, made small account of his prattle, scarce
believing any thing that he said touching love. The next day the trumpets
sounding, warned the Knights to prepare for the Turnie, every one desirous to
show himself valiant and hardy: when entering the Lists at the first
encounter, the English Prince seeing the chief Challenger coming against him,
and looking up to the window where Emilia sat, calling to mind his former
determinations, was resolved to do him the greatest disgrace he might: the
Duke on the other side was of the same opinion, for he greatly feared least
the Prince would prove his coriuall in love, by the ofen casting up of his
head to the window where she sat. Thus being both resolved, they met together
so furiously, that the Duke was forced to forgo his saddle, and measure his
length on the grass, the Prince passing forwards sorely shaken, having lost
both his stirrups: at length recovering himself, entered the prease, where on
all sides he beat down Knights, and vnbarred Helmes, making such way where he
went, that he might easily be followed of his company, especially the Prince
Charles, Henry of Burbon, Sir Henault, the Lord of Menew, the Lord of York,
the Lord Mowbray, and others, who following the young Prince, overthrew all
they met, causing the French to give back and retire, every man thinking
himself happiest, when he was farthest of.

On the contrary side, Robert of Normandy, the Prince of Condie, the Duke of
Aniow, and the Marshall: with the aid of their followers, made that part where
they were very hot and dangerous to the strangers, vnhorssing and beating
down many. The Duke of Aniow, with his Lance before he brake, struck down
three Knights to the earth, at last, being incountred by the Lord Douglasse,
was dismounted and taken prisoner, in dispight of all his company. The Duke of
Orleance, being again remounted, went raging up and down seeking for the
English Prince, and coming to the Lord of Menew, gave him such a blow, that
he drove both horse and man to the ground, which being seen by Sir Henault,
like a man enraged rod to him, and gave him such a blow, that he caused him to
bow his head to his breast. But the Duke recovering himself, returned him the
like payment. Thus continued they two, laying the one on the other, like two
Smithes, striking with their sleadges on an Anuill: till such time as the
English Prince, with a mace of steel in his hand returned, and gave the Duke
so puissant a blow therewith, that breaking his shield in pieces, so amassed
him, that his horse carried him from place to place in a sound, which being
seen by the King, and thinking the Duke to be sore hurt: imagined likewise
that it was impossible for any man to endure those mighty blows, which he
continually saw the Prince to give, caused the Judges to make an end of the
battle, which was presently done, every one attributing the chief honor to
the English Prince, especially the King, causing forthwith a Herault of Arms
to proclaim him, the cheifest Knight in the asembly: and being brought to the
window where ye King say, by the Judges of the field, had a Garland of
flowers set upon his head by the fair Emilia. Which as she was doing, unawares
was something touched with love toward him, which being by her then suffered to
kindle, afterward grew into a great flame. Thus being crowned as King of all
Knights, he was conducted with great honor to the Palace, the Duke of
Orleance, being mightily grieved with his disgrace, as also fearing the dislike
of Emilia, retired to his Tent, minding not to come forth of the Listes, till
such time as he had recovered some part of his lost honor.

CHAP. XIII. How the Duke defending his Ladies beauty, overcame diverse
Knights, and how the English Prince being disguised, entered the Lists.
THe next day, no sooner had bright Aurora vnbard her crystal gates, and
bridgrome like stepped forth, the glorious sun spreading her silver rays on
old Neptunes face, but that the lusty Duke pricked on with his former days
disgrace, hoping to recover his lost honor, was all armed, sitting on
horseback with his Lance in his hand, causing the trumpets to sound, to summon
unto the battle those, who in defense of their Ladies beauties, would hazard
themselves, to try the doubtful verdit of angry Mars. The Duke bare in his
shield the portrature of a man, with the one hand renting his own bowels, and
with the other presenting his heart to a fair Lady, which seemed little to
regard or to esteem the same, with this word or motto written over their
heads, I live through hope: all the rest of his Armor was set full of flaming
hearts, which seemed very lively to burn.

He had not long remained on horseback, before such time that the King, and
most part of the Lords and Princes, having taken their places to behold the
issue of his enterprise, there entered the listes a gallant young Knight, son
unto the Marcus of Ferara, his Armor all green, and in his Shield he bare two
hearts combind in one, with these words, Nil timeo. He brought likewise a small
chest covered over with thin plates of silver, in which was enclosed the
lively portrature of his Lady, who was daughter unto the Duke of Millaine. In
this sort coming unto the Duke, he told him, unless he were misinformed, the
contents of his Challenge was, that those Knights that by him were overcome,
should leave behind them their coate-armors, and also their Mistrises
portrature, to be placed at the feet of the fair Emilia, and so to depart:
but whosoever should overcome him, should likewise have the desposing of the
portratures that there were hanging, and to defend the Challenge the rest of
the time, except he happened likewise to be vanquished. The Duke answered, that
the same was his Challenge: but the coate-armors were to be put of presently if
they were unhorsed, and afterward, if they would hazard the Combat with him,
they should. And as for the portratures, he hoped his should be the first
which should be placed, seeing the difference of their beauties did already
manifest it.

Then departing the one from the other, they placed their Lances in their
rests, and setting spurs to their horses, they met together so fiercely, that
their Spears flew into the air: and coming together with their bodies, they
struck one the other so rudely, that the Duke lost both his stirrups, and was
forced to stay himself by his horse neck, but the other was overthrown horse
and man to the ground, and by chance not able to clear himself, was sore
bruised by his horse, not being able to get up again: then ye Duke
dismounting, help to get him from under his horse, which courtesy the other
perceiving, presently put off his coate-armor and departed the Listes, being
by reason of his bruise not able to combat. Then the Duke caused his Ladies
picture to be placed at the feet of Emilia, and calling unto him one of his
Pages, sent her the Coate-armor, which she received, willing him to tell his
Master, he had done more then she desired.

Next unto him of Ferrara, entered the Lists that day, the Lord of Montgomery,
bringing with him the picture of the Duke of Poyters daughter, whom he
earnestly loved, and was likewise at the second course unhorsed, to his great
sorrow, but yet not minding to hazard the Combat, because the Duke was accounted
the best combatter on foot in all France, departed. After him came diverse
others, who were all served in the same sort, for that day he unhorsed in all
the number of 22. Knights, placing their Ladies Pictures according to their
deserts. The next day came into the Listes young Henry of Burbon, very desirous
to be revenged, for the disgrace of the Lord Montgomery his cousin, yet also
bringing with him the picture of a Damsel whom he somewhat loved: but his
coming was more to win honor on the Duke, then to obtain his Mistrisses
favor. He bare in his Shield, Paris and the three Goddesses, but giving the
Apple to neither, with this motto, Cuique nescio, signifying thereby the
inconstancy of his mind in love. At the first course they brake their Lances
to their hands, not so much as once moving one the other: then taking new
Lances, they met again so furiously, that Henry had much to do to keep his
saddle, and the Duke loosing one of his stirrups, and his raines of his bridle,
past on likewise, and making an end of their carreare, Henry returned with his
sword in his hand, which the Duke perceiving, drew forth his also, beginning
between them a right fierce and dangerous conflict. But the Duke being better
experienced fought with the greater advantage, giving Henry leave a while to
follow the rage of his fury, thereby the sooner to weary himself. Which
indeed he did, when the Duke more fiercely then before assaulted him, causing
him to seek how to cover and defend himself under his shield. At length,
being wounded in many places, and having lost very much blood, he fell from
his horse in aswound, to the great grief of the King, and all the beholders,
who greatly feared least he had been slain. But being conuayed out of the
field, and his wounds bound up, and stanched, he was soon brought to himself.

After him, the Duke overcame twelve other Knights, not any of them being able
to endure against him, so intolerable were his blows: which the English
Prince perceiving, and grieuing to behold, the next day determined unknown to
any one, to enter the Listes disguised, where he did not doubt but he would
soon abate his pride, and resolving hereof, the next morning he armed
himself, and being mounted on a good horse, his Armor seeming all rustie, and
his sheeld covered over with leather, painted with a Kite and an Eagle flying
after a Dove, with this word, Not to obtain, he entered the lists, even at such
time as the Duke had overthrown an Enlish Knight which put himself against
him.

CHAP. XIIII. How Prince Edward overcame the Duke, and afterward continued in
the Listes the rest of the time, ouercomming diverse Knights, and of his
declaring his love to Emilia.
THE Prince being entered as before is declared, gave cause of admiration unto
all beholders, as well by reason of his furniture, as also the device of his
Shield, yet was he by the King and diverse others much commended, for his
cunning proportion, and gallant managing of his horse, the King saying unto the
Queen and the Duke of Britain, that he much feared, least that Knight would
bear away all the honor from the Duke, which in the two former days he had
won. But the Duke himself being puffed up with the former victories,
nothing at all esteemed him, and coming unto him, demanded for his Ladies
picture, for whose favor he was to undertake the Combat.

The strange Knight replied, that her pieture was enclosed in his heart, and
travailing through that Country, hearing of his Challenge, came purposely
the other to try his fortune against him, not having the time to provide any
other portrature, then that which he had already told him of. The Duke made
answer, that then he could not combat against him, in regard that ouerco^ming
him, he should loose the guerdon of his Conquest. But yet seeing he had such
an earnest desire, he should in steed of her picture, leave behind him both his
Ladies name, and his shield, to be placed at his disposition.

The Prince heereto willingly consented: and casting his eye to ye place where
the Ladies were standing, after a little pause, said. Know then Sir Duke that
the Lady whom I so much love and esteem, and whose virtues and graces are so
deeply fixed in my heart, that naught but death can extinguish the same, is the
most exquisite, and beautiful Princess Emilia here present.

The Duke being no longer able to harken to his speeches, being his coriuall:
answered, no doubt but thy folly, has overcome thy brains, and rightly does
ye figure on thy shield signify thy madness, which is the self same Kite
there represented, which seeks before the Eagle to obtain the Dove: but thou
shall presently feel, the reward of thy folly, if thou abide but the stroke of
my Lance. Then turning about his horse, not staying for any farther reply,
went to fetch his course, the other doing the like, and setting spurs to
their horses, placing their staves in their rests, they ran together furiously,
and like two fierce rams striving for superiority, leaving a great distance
between them, that with the more might, they may come together with their
horned heads, so met these worthy Knights, causing their Lances to fly into
the air, being broken into a thousand sheeuers, and meeting together with
their bodies, causes their horses to reele backwards, to the wounder of the
beholders, but quickly recovering themselves, they began to assault the one
the other: seeking by all means, either, how most to endanger his adversary,
and to save himself: at length the English Prince lifting up his sword aloft,
stark the Duke directly on the upper part of his shield so strong a blow, that
cleaving it into two pieces, his sword passed forwards wounding him in the left
thygh, but that blow was not long unrevenged, for lifting up his sword with
both hands, and raising himself in his stirrups, gave the Prince such a blow
on the head, that had he not taken it with his shield, that blow had ended the
battle: but nevertheless, passing through both shield and Helm, he gave him
a small hurt in the head, causing him half astonished to reele from side to
side, but before he could deliver another blow, the Prince had recovered
himself, and coming in more fiercely then before, struck at his head, but by
reason of the starting of his horse, the blow lighted on his shoulder, breaking
the buckles and reuits of his pouldron, and sliding down, gave his horse such
a wound, that being no longer able to contain his Masters weight, fell to the
ground, which the Duke perceauing, made the greater speed to avoid his Saddle,
and clearing himself, recovered upon his feet: which the Prince seeing,
alighted also, then taking their swords and shields in hand, they began a
most cruel and dangerous foot combat, to the amazement of all the beholders,
who never had seen the like: for being both enraged with envy and disdain,
like Lions meet, or Bulls, or Tigers, fierce pricked on with hungers rage,
finding a pray, or booty to their minds, fall out and strive, and both with
teeth, horn, and nails, wound one the other, renting their entrails, and
dying themselves, and grass with blood, so strove these two, and with their
continued equal fight, their steely Armor being not able to hold out the
blows, nor defend the thrusts, wherewith the one still wounded the other, no
man being able to judge, to which side the victory would incline, every one
meruailing who the strange Knight should be: at last the Duke began somewhat
to shrink back, and to bare the remnant of his shield very low, which the
Prince perceauing, seemed to increase his strength, and followed him more
fiercely then before, driving him from place to place, till at last coming
before the window where Emilia stood, the Prince casting up his sight toward
her, imediatly stood as one in a trance, which the other perceauing, began
again to gather courage, and gave him two or three mighty blows, telling him
that he would bring him out of his dumpes. It Is true replied the Prince, being
half ashamed at his folly, but to your pain. Then plucking up himself, they
renewed their battle, which seemed like to the burning of some hidden flax:
having a while escapt the extremity of the fire, which had before consumed
great woods and trees, and seeming to be extinguished, presently renewes a flame
again, and so goes out. Such was their latter strife, for the Prince being
rowsed from his slumber, persued him with so many weighty blows, that the Duke
being no longer able to hold out, fell to the ground in a trance: which the
Judges perceiving, came speedily unto them, fearing least the strange Knight
would have proffered him farther violence, but he, putting up his sword,
demanded whether there was ought else to be done. The County Palatine
answered, nothing but to defend the place as the Duke had before. Then the
Duke was conuaied away, and being unarmed, was dressed by the Surgians, which
found no dangerous wound, but that his great loss of blood, caused him to be
extreme weak and faintie. The Duke being couayed away, the King was very
desirous to know who the strange Knight should be, and being about to send one
unto him, to that end. The Prince presented himself before him, and pulling of
his Helm, desired his Majesty to grant him leave to continue the Dukes
challendge: when the King beheld him, and saw that it was the Prince, who had
subdued ye Duke, his grief for his hurts, and overthrow was somewhat eased.
Then speaking to the Prince, he said, my Lord I did not think you would have
thus dealt with us, as unknown, thus to have put us into such grief, as you
have done by the wounding, and vanquishing of the Duke our Cousin: yet seeing
it was his own folly in making the challendge, it does the less grieve us.
But for your request in continuance thereof: I would wish you rather, to give
it over then to endanger your self therein, but if so be you are so minded, we
freely grant you leave, praying to God send you better hap, then the Duke has
had before you. The Prince humbly thanked his Majesty: and then turning to the
Princess Emilia, entreated her likewise to grant him leave, as her father had
done to defend her beauty, seeing that it was his hap to obtain the same by
his good Fortune. The Princess being before hand a little touched with his
love, and now seeing the pains and danger, which he undertook for her sake,
was altogether overcome: wherefore dying her cheeks with a maidenly blush, she
told him the pains which he already took, and that he would again endure for
her sake, was unknown unto her: yet because she would not prove discurtious,
nor ungrateful, seeing the King her father had thereto consented, she was
content to accept him for her Knight, and to allow of that which he requested.
The Prince heerewith being marvelous contented, returned her hearty thanks,
and so departed again to the Tent, where he was met by the Spanish Prince,
the Duke of York, and Sir Henault, and many others: and was by them disarmed,
and after dinner, his wounds being bound up, he armed himself again in a
most costly Armor, set all with true love knots, wrought of pure gold, and
being attended by the foresaid Lords, he entered the Lists: where he had not
long remained before such time, that there came a Knight of the Kingdom of
Naples: a man in those parts famoused for his valor and hardiness, and being
inamored on a young Damsel of that Country, promised her to come into France,
whereby his valor, he would cause her to be for ever famoused: but his hap
was so hard that at the first encounter, he was sent to measure his length in
the ground, not being able to combat. After him that day, and the next day, he
unhorsed to ye number of 40 Knights: the last day there came very few to try
themselves, the most part having in the five former days, been by the Duke
foiled, by means whereof he past away the time in company of the Spanish
Prince, and other great Lords, until it was almost Sun set, at which time
there entered an ill favored withered face fellow, something heigher then three
horse loaves, by birth a pagan, but brought up by the Queen of Portugal, as
her Dwarf, this proper aplosquire falling in love with a Damsel, almost as
hansome as himself, being likewise attending on the Queen, and having
obtained her good liking on that condition, that he should in all places
maintain her beauty: desired the Queen that he might be made Knight,
assuring her that he would so behave himself, that thee and all others should
think the order well bestowed upon him. The Queen seeing his earnestness
yielded unto him, and caused him to be Knighted, who no sooner having received
the order, and hearing of the Duke of Orleance challendge, but he determined to
fight against him, and cause him to confess his peate, to more beautiful then
Emilia. Continuing in this imagination, he caused her Picture to be drawn, and
therewith came unto Parris, entering the Lists at such time, as the Prince with
the other Lords were ready to depart, and coming unto the Spanish Prince,
demanded which was he that had overcome the Duke. The Prince meruailing to see
such a gallant in that equipage, demanded what he would with him, marry quoth
the Dwarf fight with him, and cause him to confess, that the Damsel which I
love, does excel in beauty all others: the Prince smilling, having much ado
to contain himself from laughter, demanded who was his Lady, and where her
Picture was. He answered she was attending on the Queen of Portugal, and
therewith drew forth her Picture, at sight whereof every one burst forth in a
great laughter. The Dwarf being heerewith angry, asked the Prince whether it
were he or no that he had inquired for, the Prince answered no, but showed him
the English Prince, withal telling him that the time was past, whereby he had
lost his labor, unless he could entreat him to Just willingly.

Then the Dwarf coming unto him, entreated him if the time were past, that
yet in courtisie he would break a Lance with him: he smilling answered, that
between that and Sun set, he was bound to Just with any that should come,
wherefore he was contented. Then taking each of them a Lance, they ran
together: the Prince missing his course of purpose, but the Dwarf with much
ado brake his Lance, almost dismounting himself with his own stroke. The
King, and Queen, withal the Lords and Ladies, laughed heartily heereat: the
Duchess of Burbone telling Emilia, that now her Knight was like to loose all
his former honor.

The Dwarf had no sooner broken his Lance, but presently he drew forth his
sword, but ye Prince entreated him, to run one course more, which he easily
yielded unto, then taking a new spear, they ran again: the Prince taking
him in the midst of his Shield, bare him out of his saddle a whole spears
length, not being able to rise from ye ground. Then was sent unto him by the
King, the young Prince Phillip his son, to entreat him to come to the
Palace, whether he went, being accompanied with diverse great Lords and
Knights, and was very roially received by the King, the Queen, and their fair
daughter, and feasted with many sumptuous and rare sorts of viands, after
supper, they fell again to their wonted sports of dancing and masking: where
the English Prince again made his love known unto Emilia, assuring her, that
unless she pitied his estate, he was but dead, for without her, he was but
as a shadow without substance, or as a body without a soul. The Princess, who
by this time was as much scorched with the flame as he, and did feel as great
force of love, knew not well what to answer, but at last yielding to love,
she told him, that if he loved her as he made show of, she had no reason but
to requite him with the like, but as yet she was young, and at her Parents
disposition, without whose consent she could not make her own choice, but if
he could obtain her Fathers consent, she was likewise contented to accept of
him as her Lord and husband.

Here will we leave of to speak of these Lovers, and return a little to
speak of the Gentleman of the Forest, and his education.

CHAP. XV. How the young Princes of Denmark, and Saxony, being brought up
together, were so like, that they could scarce be known one from the other,
and of their mutual love.
YOU remember how the Duke of Saxony bringing with him the young Prince of
Denmark into his Duchy, caused him to be brought up with his own son,
calling him by the name of the Gentleman of the Forest, because they knew no
other name that he had. The Duchess, partly by the commandment of her husband,
and partly for the beauty she beheld in him, made great account of him, using
to play and dandle with him, as much as with her own son: by means whereof,
in short time he began to recover a fresh and lively color, and still the
elder they grew, the more like the children seemed the one to the other: and as
in likeness, so also grew they in love one to the other, delighting always to
be together. And being but children, if any one had happened to wrong either of
them, the other would always help to be revenged, which bred in the Duke and
Duchess, so great content as might be. But coming to the age of 7. years,
they were instructed in the Latin and Greek tongues, by a Tutor who^ the Duke
had appointed them for their bringing up. He being a very wife and discreet
Knight, who in former time had spent his youthful days in traueling strange
Countries, and seeking after adventures, as was the usage of Knights arrant:
he having as before is said, the charge of education of the two Princes
committed unto him, instructed them so well, that in short time they profited
very much in those languages, especially the Gentleman of the Forest, as
being of a more quick and ready wit, but otherwise, their dispositions, and
constitutions both of mind and body were so like, that the Duke was forced to
set marks whereby to know them: and their love in like manner was so great,
that had the one been sick or ill at ease, the other seemed to be a partner
in his grief: if the one laughed, the other was joyful, if the one wept, the
other must needs mourn to bare him company, such a simpathy of love had
Nature infused in them, that it was almost impossible for the one to live
without the others company.

And coming to the age of twelve years, they were instructed by their Tutor,
to ride and manage horses, wherein they so much profited, that in short time
they wexed very skillful, especially the Gentleman of the Forest, who both in
aptnes of mind, and agilitie of body, passed the most exquisite of his time:
which caused the Duke so much ye more to love and esteem of him, hoping that
in time, God would manifest from whence, and of what parentage he was
descended, imagining as well by his beauty, as also by his rare forwardnes, yt
he must needs be issued of noble blood. The Duchess likewise grew into so
great a liking of him, for his diverse rare and singular virtues, yt she many
times devised with herself, how and by what means she might cause him to love
her daughter, whom he esteemed as his Sister, a Lady for beauty excellent, and
for the perfections of the mind, able to compare with any then living. She I
say, being of this mind, oftentimes resolved to motion the matter unto him,
and to discover unto him the manner of his finding, which unto him was
unknown, by reason he was always held and accounted as their natural Child:
yet thinking that course might be a means, when he should come to age, for to
forsake their Court, to seek for his true Parents, she gave over that
determination, minding to confer with the Duke her husband thereof. And
finding him one night very merry, and pleasantly discoursing, and commending of
both the young Princes unto her, she declared unto him her mind, and affirmed,
that in her conscience, there could be no better match for her daughter, seeing
his virtuous behavior, which was more to be esteemed then my riches
whatsoever. The Duke did not greatly dislike hereof, but yet thought it
fitter to be left alone, until such time as both of them should attain to a
more riper years, for as then he was but 12 years old, and she nine years
old. Here again will we leave them, to speak of the Lord Gwaltero, and his
company: who after they departed from the Ladies Castle, took their ways
toward the confines of Germany.

CHAP. XVI. How the Lord Gwaltero, traveling through Germany, arrived in the
City of Viena in Austria: where he undertook the defense of a distressed
Lady, wrongfully accused.
THe Lord Gwaltero, departing from the Ladies Castle whom he had rescued, at
time such as he parted from the Lord of Menew, and Sir Henault, being
accompanied with Sir Cadrus, Sir Brewes, and his Squire: rode on a long time
without finding any adventure worth the remembrance, ever inquiring after Sir
Henault, and the Lord of Menew, with the rest of their company. At length
passing through many Towns of Germany, they arrived in a City of the
Dukedom of Austria, called Viena: bordering almost on the confines of
Hungaria, being as then the chief City of that province, and as then under
the governance of a most stirne and rigorous Prince, named Duke Otho. Who for
his tiranous cruelty, was greatly feared of all his neighbor Potentates, and
scarcely beloved of his own natural Subjects: he was a man for valor, and
hardiness greatly esteemed, and had not his outrageous cruelty, and beastly
sensuallity stained his Virtues, he might well have been compared with any
Prince, then living within the confines of Christendom: but rage and sensual
appetites does commonly so abound, especially in the hearts of great men, whom
God has given over to themselves, that virtue is altogether choked, and
swallowed up in vice, as might well appear in this Duke Otho. Who (so he might
have) cared not by what means he came by it: as by the sequel of this
Chapter, you shall more plainly understand.

This Duke had within his territories, a most gracious and virtuous Lady,
being sole heir unto her father, who was a man of large possessions, and
greatly beloved in his Country, for his virtuous and upright dealings to every
man. This noble Gentleman dying, and leaving his daughter about the age of 15
or 16 years, was sought unto of many great and mighty Lords: some for her
lands and livings, others for her beauty and virtues, and diverse for both. But
to make short this discourse, she was at last wooed, and won by a Knight of
that Country, called Hostinius: a man who for his virtues and valor in
Chiualry, might be thought equal with any Knight, in Austria, and being married
unto the young Lady Vitella, they so well loved and liked together, that they
scarce one ever gave cause of dislike to the other, which caused them to be
commended, and praised through all the Dukedom, and the confines there abouts:
but this joy and content, had not continued fully the space of three years,
before that froward Fortune envying their blessed state, caused her fame to be
resounded in ye ears of the Duke Otho. Whose lustful heart being set on fire
with report of her beauty, caused both her and her husband to be sent for to
his Court, where being arrived, he at the first most kindly received them,
and as the old proverb is, made much of the child for the Nursses sake: so
he entertained Hostinius, using him with all the familiarity that might be
for his wifes sake, always seeking opportunity, to make known his lustful
love unto Vitilla. And one day finding her standing at a window, looking into
the Palace garden: he came unto her, and after a little idle prattle,
fetching a deep fained sigh, he declared unto her his love, vowing and
protesting, unless she took pity on him, and yield to his desire, there was
no way but death with him, aleaging that as her beauty had wounded him, so was
it her part to relieve and comfort him again, declaring that as by nature she
was fair, so likewise ought she to be kind and merciful.

The good Lady being half in a maze with this unlooked for process, and scarce
knowing how to answer him, considering his nature to be such, that an absolute
denial might cause him to grow into choler, both with her and her husband,
and thereby to work both their confusions. And likewise to feed him on with
fained speeches of love, might bring her name in question of slander, and
though for a time by that means she might put him off, yet in the end, seeing
himself deluded, he would revenge himself with the greater cruelty,
determined therefore of two evils to choose the least: wherefore she replied in
this manner.

My gracious Lord, I do not think that you will so much dishonor your
self, as by forcing of me to violate the holy rites of marriage, and to wrong
my Lord and husband in that sort, as by your speeches you pretend, which if you
go about to perform, know for certainty, that God who created all things of
naught, will severely punish and revenge so great a crime: and likewise assure
your self my Lord, that whilst I have power and strength to resist, you shall
never obtain the same, wherefore I would wish your honor to give over all such
wicked imaginations. And herewith she flung away from him in a great chafe,
leaving him musing on her short answer, and devising which way he might bring
his will to pass, at last resolved with himself, that there was no way to
accomplish the same, but only by the death of her husband, hoping that he
being dead, she might be brought to any thing. And being thus resolved, he
went down into the great Hall, where finding diverse of Hostinius servant,
he made choice of one, whom he saw continually most near unto him: and taking
him a side, declared unto him his intent, and at last, with large promises
won him, both to consent, and also to be the Actor of his Lords tragedy,
which in this sort was acted. About some three nights after their agreement,
Estonio, for so was that false servant named, having gotten a sleeping powder,
so cunningly co^uayde it into the wine which both his Lord and Lady drank of,
with some of the rest of their nearest attendants, that being laid in their
bedds, none of them awaked till the morning. In the mean time, even about
midnight, when both by nature, and effect of their drench, they were soundest
asleep, then entered the damnable Traitor, and drove into his Lords head a
nail, which he had no sooner performed, but hiding the hammer wherewith he had
committed that cruel homicide, under the bed, he departed to his own bed,
where he remained until the next day, that all the rest of his fellows, were
risen, and the Chamberlain, as was his custom, came, and softly knocked at
his Lords chamber-doore, wherewith the Lady awaked, and turning about, she
found her Lord and husband as cold as Ice, which struck such a terror in her
heart, that fetching a great shreeke, she likewise fell into a trance. Her
damsels which attended her, hearing the shreeke, fearing she was not well,
entered the Chamber, where they found their Lord dead, and their Lady in little
better case, but at length, having recovered life in her, they called in the
Gentlemen his attendants, who being entered, it is impossible to describe the
sorrow and lamentation which was made, where Estonio, in outward show, seemed
not to be least sorrowful, so well knew he how to dissemble the matter. At
last, the rumor hereof came to the ears of Duke Otho, who presently like a
man enraged with grief, he came posting to the Chamber, where at his first
entrance, to make show of the love which he bare to the dead body being
living, he rent his hair, beating his breast, protesting that he would have
given half his dukedom, to have him alive again, although (GOD knows) he
himself was the only cause of his death. The good Lady, she in the mean
time swounded, and reswounded, and had it not been for the damsels, without
all doubt she would have borne her husband company amongst the dead, seeing
she was deprived of him amongst the living: so extreme was the grief which
she felt, and so great the love which she bare him.

The Duke in the mean time, for the better obtaining of his purpose, caused ye
dead body to be imbaulmed, saying he would have him buried with the greatest
solemnity that might be, as the man whom he most loved: and because it was
impossible to be performed so suddenly, he would have him keept unburied, by
the space of a month, against which time he warned all the chief of his
Subjects to be there. Hoping in ye mean time by one means or other, to work
Vitella to his will, wherefore every day he would come to visit her: many
times declaring his passions unto her, desiring her to consent and yield
thereto. But she good Lady, not minding so soon to forget him whom she loved
so dearly, neither yet to make choice of one whom for his wicked life, she
could not choose but hate: and also, by his important suit, imagining that to
gain her, he might by some kind of poison, have made away her husband, seeing
that so suddenly he died: gave him this answer.

My Lord, I know not the cause of this your importunate suit, neither can I
think but that it proceeds from a vild and sinful mind, that professing so
great love as you did to my late Lord and husband, you would tempt me his
woeful wife so soon to forget him, and commit so vile an offense before God:
wherefore know for a certainty, that I neither can, nor will consent to love
him, whom my mind perswads me to be ye destroyer of my late deceased Lord and
husband: for without you had therein been guiltfull, you would not have
persisted in this your wicked persute after my honesty.

The Duke knowing himself guilty, in that wherewith she had accused him, and
also growing into chollor with her rude denial, briefly replied. Lady I
perceive that, that which cannot be obtained by fair means, must now at
length be won by foul: and seeing that you will not willingly consent unto
the thing, which in kind and mild sort I have entreated of you, know for a
certainty, that I will win it by force: and whereas you accuse me of
murdering of thy unfortunate husband, assure thy self that the guilte thereof,
shall lighten on thy own head: which I my self will justify against thee.
And thus saying, he departed her chamber, changing all his former love into
cruel hate, always pondring in his mind revenge, till such time, as his
Nobles being come together, for the solemnizing of the funerals, at which time
(coming as if he would have viewed the dead corpse) with some of his
nobillity, laying his hand on his head, on a sudden he seemed to feel ye
nail: when fetching a deep sigh, he cried out, that his dear friend
Hostinius, had been slain by treachery. The nobles beholding this sudden
accident, came and beheld the same, every one imediatly judging, that by that
wound he received his death. The Duke above all others seemed most to wounder
heereat, and at length turning to the company, said, that he hoped to find out
the murderers, seeing God so strangely had given knowledge of the deed, which
until now was not so much as once dreampt of.

Wherefore presently causing Vitella, with all her Damsells and attendants to
be atached, he examined them every one, and coming to Estonio, whom he before
had instructed, examined him in such sort, that he declared how that the Lady
Vitilla, had many times made proffer of her love unto him, and that he as often
had denied her, because he would not wrong his Lord and Master: how that she
had proffered him, both to murder her husband, and afterward to marry with
him, if he thereunto would give his consent: still clearing himself as much as
it was possible. This confession being uttered, she poor distressed Lady was
forthwith condemned, not being suffered so much as once to speak for her
self, Estonio was likewise committed to prison: there for to remain a while
to bleere ye peoples eyes, who could hardly believe that, which he had
justified.

The same day the Duke proceeded in judgment, against Vitella, where he judged
her for her fault, to loose all her lands, which he imediatly seized on, and
that except within six months, she could find a Knight yt should maintain her
cause, against ye Duke in single combat: for he as a dear friend unto her
deased husband, would be the man that would prove that she had committed
treason, and murder against him, with these conditions, that if he were
vanquished, that then she should be delivered free, and all her lands and goods
restored unto her, but if it hapne^d that he remained Victor, that both she
and the weak Knight, which should put himself in her defense, should be
burned a live at one stake, which he caused for the same purpose to be set up
in the midst of the Market place.

This sentence pronounced, she good Lady was committed under safe keeping: no
body but such whom the Duke appointed, being suffered to come unto her. Which
caused many to judge the Duke rather to be guilty then she, especially such who
had known the great love between her, and her deceased husband: considering
also, that only by this means he had gotten her inhearitance into his hands,
which was the chiefest mark he aimed at.

Now to return again to our purpose, the Lord Gwaltero and his company,
coming as before we have said into Viena, happened to take up his lodging in a
kinsmans house of the Lady Vitellas, who (by reason of her mishap) was very sad
and pensive: and being sitting at supper, was demanded the cause of his
sorrow by the Lord Gwaltero, unto whom he declared the former discourse, with
the love of the Duke unto Vitella, which he had likewise learned of her, not
forgetting in any one point, to declare the common wickedness of the Duke,
thereby the easier to persuade his crime likewise in this.

Gwaltero having attentively listened unto this discourse, meruailed greatly at
the strange tyranny of the Duke, and being half resolved of the Ladies
innocence, determined with himself, to put himself in her defense, wherefore
demanding how he might come to speak with the Lady, and also, how near the
time appointed for her execution was expired, (for that he was loath to tarry
ouer-long in any place, because of his return unto his Lady and Mistrisse) his
Host replied, that the time of her death was now within six days, and that as
yet she was not provided of any Champion, because ye Duke was a strong
puissant knight, and the condition of the combat such, that every one feared to
entermedle therein: and as touching the means to speak with her, if he would
vouchsafe to take the pains, he would (supper being ended) conduct him to the
place, where he should from her own mouth, hear what she would say to
clear herself. Gwaltero being by nature pitiful, and also by oath of
Knighthood bound to help, and succor those that were distressed, consented
to go with him to the prison. Where being come, and brought into the presence
of Vitella, her Cousin declared the cause of their coming, who after thanks to
them given, and lifting up both her eyes and hands toward heaven, protesting
her innocence, she declared as much as she knew touching the same, utterly
denying any love toward Estinio, or any other, save only her Lord Hostinius.
Gwaltero being fully resolved of her innocence, demanded if she would put her
case into his hands, who would for her delivery adventure his life, and no
doubt but her cause being just, God would prosper their quarrel. She humbly
thanking him, answered, that seeing he so courteously offered himself, to him
and God only she committed her case: desiring, that according to her
innocence he might speed therein, and no otherwise. Then taking their leave,
till the day came he departed, leaving her somewhat comforted with hope of her
Knights good success, and equity of her cause.

CHAP. XVII. How Gwaltero combatted with the Duke, and slew him, and of the
kind proffers that were made him by Vitella and the Nobility, with his
departure thence.
THE day being come, wherein the Lady Vitella was either to bring forth her
Champion, or else to commit her body to the fire, the Duke being royally
accompaned, entered the Lists, causing her in continent to be sent for, and
being come, demanded for her Champion, she answered, that God had provided
her one, who at ye sound of the trumpet would likewise appear. The Duke
hearing that she was provided of a Knight, wondered what he should be, and
being pricked in conscience with the guilt of his fault, grew half into
despair, and would willingly (if it might have been with his honor) have
desisted from the Combat. But God who hardened the heart of Pharao, likewise
hardened his, thereby the more evidently to make known unto the world, his
mercy and loving kindness, toward them that fear him, and his justice on them,
which against their own consciences commit sin and iniquity. So that
causing first the Lady to be conuayed toward the stake, the trumpets were
sounded, but no Knight was seen to approach, which caused him to grow more
proud and insolent, thinking then, that no man dared to combat against him.
But at the second warning the Lord Gwaltero appeared, mounted on a mighty
Courser, with his Lance on his thigh, and his Helmet on: in this sort came he
before the Judges, and lifting up his beuer, made a little show of reverence,
then proceeding on with his speech, he said, that being accepted of Vitella as
her Knight, he was come to defend her innocence: and that he marueiled, that
they being appointed Judges of the field, would contrary to all reason, send
her toward the place of execution, before the Combat were ended: then desiring
that she might again be sent for, he held his peace: which they forthwith
caused to be done, placing her whereas she might behold the issue of the
battle. In the mean time, the Duke coming unto Gwaltero, demanded what, and
of whence he was, who answered, that he was a Knight arrant, of the kingdom
of Denmark, and passing through his Country, had heard of his cruelty showed
unto the distressed Lady, and being moved with pity, was come to undertake
her defense, which he hoped so well to perform, as before night to cause him
confess his treason against her. The Duke raging hereat, replied, that
doubtless he was some one of her Minions, that being weary of his life, was
come for company to be burnt with her, which should be performed with all the
torments that might be.

Now by this time Vitella being brought back and placed, the Judges caused
both Knights to be sworn, then being warned by a Herault every one to do his
best, they set spurs to their horses, and incountred so rudely, that the Duke
was thrown out of his saddle, being wounded a little under the right breast,
and sore bruised with the fall, Gwaltero was not wounded at all, but yet by
reason of the mightiness of the encounter, his horseback brake under him,
wherefore he was in like sort driven to alight, and being both on foot, they
began a cruel and fierce fight, cleaving their shields, and hewing their armor
in pieces, so that every blow caused the blood to trickle down, dying the
grene grass into a scarlet hue. Thus continued the fight a long time very
uncertain, no man knowing to who^ victory would incline: some-whiles the one
tryumphing in the others loss, and by and by again, the other rejoicing to
see his enemy stoop. Thus continued they the space of three hours, the
beholders meruailing they could endure so long: at length standing to breathe
themselves, the Duke spoke unto him, saying, Knight, thou see that as yet I
have the advantage, but the great valor which I have found in thee, makes me
to pity thy estate, wherefore I am contented to remit thee the Combat,
conditionally that you wilt remain with me, and also I will give unto thee
half of her lands whom thou defendest. Nay, nay, replied Gwaltero, I scorn
thy proffers, but if thou will restore the Lady and her goods, and confess
here before this company, thy treason committed against her, I will grant thee
thy life: otherwise look for no mercy at my hands. Then taking their swords in
their hands, and covering themselves with the remnants of their shields, they
fell again to their former conflict, which continued not long before that
Gwaltero delivered a mighty blow on his head, which cleft his Helm in two,
and wounded him so sore that he fell to the ground, which Gwaltero seeing,
stepped unto him, and would have slain him outright, had not he entreated
mercy, promising to confess the whole circumstance of the treason.

Then the Judges coming unto him, he confessed first his love to Vitella, then
the murder of Hostinius, and lastly his hate toward her for refusing him, from
whence grew this manner of revenge which be intended.

No sooner had he made his confession, but turning about his face he immediately
dyed. Then the Judges caused his body to be carried away, to the intent to have
him interred, but they were saved of that labor, for a flock of Wolves coming
from out of the woods there adjoining, devoured his accursed carcass, to the
great admiration of all the beholders. Then immediately was, Vitella brought
down, and greatly honored, and Estonio being apprehended, was burned in the
fire prepared for his Lady. Gwaltero being conducted to his lodging by the
Nobility and Vitella, was by them unarmed, and his wounds very carefully looked
unto, where he remained the space of eight weeks, during which time he had
many great prosfers made him by Vitella, as the inioying both of herself, and
all her inheritance, and by the Nobility he was proffered to be accepted as
their sovereign Prince and Duke, if so be he would accept of Vitella to be
his wife. But he who had settled his mind in another place, gave the^ all
hearty thanks for their good wills toward him, excusing himself as well as he
might, and desiring them to bestow it on some one more worthy then himself,
with whom Vitella might be coupled in marriage. Thus excusing himself from
receiving that which most men would have coueted, he remained there till his
wounds were thoroughly whole, then taking his leave of Vitella and the rest, he
departed toward the confines of Belgica, having received of Vitella both horse
and Armor, for a remembrance of her, in steed of his own, which in the battle
against the Duke was broken and spoiled.

CHAP. XVIII. How Gwaltero passing through Belgica, arrived in Holland, and
coming to the Castle of Coruew, was taken prisoner.
THus being departed from Viena, he was accompanied by diverse of the
Nobility, till such time as passing the bounds of Austria, he directed his
iourny toward Flaunders: at which time the Austrians commending him to God,
and desiring him at his return to come that way, they departed again toward
Viena, by whom Gwaltero commended to Vitella. In this sort being departed, he
rode onwards toward Flaunders, disguising himself, because he would not be
known in that Country, where he was beloved of many: at last coming to the
City of Gaunt, he found it still defended, and kept under the Subjection of
the Danes, there likewise he heard of the custom of the Castle of Coruew, in
the Duchy of Holland, made by the Duke Griffory. Which was (that whosoever
would enter ye said Castle) must first alone Just with the five Knights, who
kept the foot of the bridge, one after another, and if it were his hap to
overcome them all, then was he to Just also with the other five: first with two
at once, then against the other three, but and if it were his fortune likewise
to vanquish them, then was he to fight with the other 40, by five, and by
five, so that it was impossible for one man to vanquish them all. But if it so
happened that the strange Knight, were by them overcome, then to loose both his
horse and Armor, and so to depart: unless it were such a one whom they knew to
be their enemy, and then was he sure to be imprisoned. This custom he raised,
because thereby he hoped to imprison as many of the Danske Knights, as should
pass that way in search of their King.

Gwaltero hearing of this custom, and being desirous to see the strength and
situation of the place (so much spoken of, together, imagining that
peradventure their King might be there imprisoned, as indeed he was) minded to
go see the same, and then if his mind served him, to make trial of the
adventure. Thus being resolved, he secretly departed Gaunt, accompanied only
with his Squire, leaving behind him both Sir Brewes and Cadrus, not knowing
what was become of him: in this sort he shaped his course the next way
thetherwards, where the tenth day after he arrived, about nine of the clock in
the morning: and coming to a shield that hunge on a Tree thereby, struck the
same so hard, that the whole Castle resounded thereof. Then came forth the
first five Knights, one of them demanding what he sought: Gwaltero told him he
would very willingly enter the Castle, to behold whether it were so fair
within, as it showed beautiful without. Yea replied the Knight, but first you
must according to our custom Just with me, and my fellows, whom except you
overcome, you are not like to gain entrance: I have heard (replied he) if I be
not deceived, your custom, which makes me something the more desirous to
enter, in regard I think that a place so fenced and defended without, cannot
choose but have things worth the beholding within: wherefore I am contented to
make trial of my fortune, by the strength of my arm. Then couching their
Lances, they two ran together so fiercely, that the Knight of the Castle was
tumbled headlong over his horse tail, not being able to rise again, by reason
of the weight of his Armor, which so sore bruised him in his fall. Then ran
another of the Knights, but for have missed his course: but Gwaltero being
more circomspect, in having a great deal of work to do, met him so rightly,
that his Lance passed through his body above a yard, causing him to fall dead
to the ground: then his Squire brought him the Lance of the dead Knight, with
which he met the third so soundly, that he sent both horse and man to the
ground, wherehence he was not able to arise in have, by reason that both his
feet were so fastened in his stirrups, yt he could not clear himself, but
lay still under his horse, which striving to get up, had almost squised out his
Masters breath. The fourth whose turn was next to run, knew not well what
to do, for willingly he would have desisted from that carrere, but being
ashamed to show himself so cowardly: he likewise set spurs to his horse, but
in ye encounter was sent to bear his fellows company. The fifth had somewhat
better luck then ye rest, for at the first course he was not not dismounted,
by reason Gwalteros horse being wearied with his former travel, even as they
came to meet, stumbled under him, whereby he mist his course, the other
breaking his spear in the midst of his shield, past on without doing any
farther hurt: then taking a new Lance they ran again, where the second time
Gwaltero met him so directly, that casting him out of his Saddle backwards, he
pitched on the ground with his head forwards, falling so heavy that he brake
his neck withal. The^ Gwaltero alighting, made choice of ye best of their
horses, and mounting thereon came to the bridge foot, where he found great
store of Lances, and making choice of ye best, he delivered a couple unto his
Squire, to keep for him if occasion served. Now by this time were two of the
other five on horseback, providing themselves for the Just: and all the rest
of the Knights of the Castle, were gathered together on the battlements, to
behold the issue of the battle: arming themselves likewise, who should be the
next five. Thus the two Knights being mounted and furnished at all points,
cried unto Gwaltero to defend himself: then placing their Lances in their
rests, and setting spurs to their horses, they ran together with all their
force, breaking their staves in the midst of his shield, with such might, that
they caused his horse to stagger backwards, having much ado to recover
himself from falling, but he himself seemed to move no more, the^ if they had
run against some huge Oak, but his stroke was not to so small purpose, for
charging his Lance against him on his right side, gave him such a sound blow,
that piercing both his shield and armor, the spears head entered clean through
his heart, causing him to fall as dead as a dog to the ground. Then turning
about (their course being ended) demanded whether he must just with the
other Knight again, and they answered yes: then calling to his Squire to bring
him another lance, they ran again, where the other Knight was forced to
measure his length on the ground, bearing his saddle between his legs.

Then again changing his horse, he provided himself against the other three,
who being all mounted on very good horses, charged him at once, two of them
breaking their staves on his shield, and the other missing his course, was sent
headlong to the ground for being over hasty.

Gwaltero being sore shaken with that encounter, could have been contented to
have given over running for that time, but yet being compelled to it by reason
of the custom, took a fresh Lance in hand, and therewith met one of them so
right, that for ever after he made him sure enough for running. The other
perceiving his fellows to be slain, and that no force was able to prevail
against him, determined at the next course to kill his horse under him, hoping
thereby to save himself from the stroke of his Lance: and being thus
resolved, ran again, directing the point of his Lance full against
Gwalteros horse breast, where entering, he slew the horse, but escaped not him
self so well as he hoped for, by reason that the horse coming so fiercely,
gave something back, but brought his Master so near him, that he struck him
full in the fight of the Helm, and the bar being weak, gave passage for
the spear to his brains, so that they fell to the ground both together. And
Gwaltero clearing his feet out of the stirrups, lightly recovered himself
again, and adressing his shield on his arm, with his sword in his hand, he
marched toward the Castle gate, minding (seeing that he had proceeded so
far) either to enter, or die in the pursuit. But before he was come fully to
the entrance, the five Knights, who were appointed to combat first with him,
came forth, and all at once assaulted him: then began there a most fierce
and bloody fight, very hard and unequal, by reason they being five, and he
but one, and also before ouerlabored with his former travel, was not able to
do as otherwise he would: yet notwithstanding, he laid on such cruel blows,
that every one judged himself happiest when as he was farthest from him, the
lookers on admiring how it was possible for one alone Knight, to show such
prowess, as by defending himself against so many, but at last being
ouerwearied, and wounded in many places, having lost much of his blood, was
forced through faintnes to fall to the ground, having before his fall slain two
of them outright, and very sorely wounded the others, then being no longer
able to resistance, he was carried prisoner into the Castle, where he had his
wounds bound up and dressed, being pitied of many who had beheld his valor,
but being cured of his wounds, and examined of whence he was, he was
committed prisoner into the dungion where the woeful King lay, thereby thinking
the more to grieve him. Who no sooner was let in-the dungion, but they one knew
the other, making the greatest lamentation and sorrow that might be, but at
length comforting themselves as well as they might, they made relation of their
fortunes each to other, hoping that in time God would send them deliverance
from all their troubles. Here will we leave them, to tell a little what happened
in the Kingdom of Denmark, through the malice of the Governors one to
another.

CHAP. XIX. How the Archbishop of Maiance, the County Hermes, and the Lord
Harding, disliking the government, went about to make a King amongst them.
THe Kingdom of Denmark, having been without their King, by the space of 17
years, and under the government of a certain company of States, elected as is
before declared: many began to dislike with ye government thereof, amongst
whom the chief and principal, were the Archbishop of Maiance, a man very well
learned, but given altogether unto novelties and change, the County Hermes, and
the Lord Harding, all three great men, and such as were in a manner, the only
Authors of that government: and the first year were themselves chief
governors in that established estate, as appears in the fourth Chapter of
this present Book.

Yet notwithstanding, (all this and their solemn vows, ratified under their
hands and seals, for the continuance, and performance of that kind of state,
and government) they were in a manner, the first that repined against it,
seeking by all the means they could, to overthrow and extinguish the same,
either for the envy they bare toward those who were Governors, or for that
themselves had never since the first year happened to be of the twelve, or else
(and that which I think to be most likeliest) being stirred up by the devil,
they desired greater superiority, then either became them, or by any ways they
were worthy of, yet doubting to agree within themselves, being but three,
having the governance in their own hands, determined therefore to elect and
choose a King: who being by them so raised, could not choose likewise but to be
ruled by them, and that under the color of the King, they might revenge
themselves of their enemies: and likewise prefer their friends to honor and
dignity. And having thus resolved between themselves, they solicited the
Scottish King to accept of the Diadem, promising him by their letters, that if
he would but send over ten thousand Soldiers, under the conduct of some
expert Leader or Captain, that then they would so aid him, that in less then
a year, he should have all Denmark in his subjection: conditionally, that
they three might continually have and enjoy to themselves, the chief offices
belonging to that Kingdom.

The Scottish King (harkning unto this jolly proffer) at the first made small
account thereof: but afterward waying with himself the great benefits and
proffits, which thereby might rise, not only to him: but to all his Kingdom
and Subjects, if he might so easily obtain the same, as in their letters they
made show of: and being again by them solicited anew, writing unto him in
their letters, that unless he accepted thereof, they would give it unto the
King of England, or some other Prince, whom they knew would more thankefully
accept of their kind offer. The County Hermes in a private letter besides,
wrote how that if his Majesty would (having conquered the Kingdom) make him
Viceroy or Deputy thereof, he would send over his eldest son to remain as
pledge, until such time as he had performed, whatsoever he made promise of:
and that then he would render him such tribute, as by his Majesty should be
thought fit. Now when he had himself perused these letters, (and cast all
doubts he could) he made them known to his privy Counsel, who after long
deliberation, at length gave him this answer, that they were also of the
mind, his Majesty should accept their proffer of the Kingdom a gift well
worth the acceptance, and farther, to grant them their own desires, in that
which they should demand, till such time as being Master of the Country,
he might at his pleasure, then alter any thing that he would. In the mean
time, to receive pledges of their meaning, least otherwise he might repent too
late. Thus having determined, the King sent over secretly unto them, to
certify them of his intent, assuring each of them the greatest dignities and
honor, that the Kingdom would yield: entreating the^ likewise, to send over
their Hostages, upon whose arrival his forces should be ready to be shipped,
under the conduct of his Cosen, the Lord Douglasse, a man for his experience
and valor excellent.

These letters being thus secretly conuaied, were most welcome news unto those
arch Traitors to their Country, who forthwith sent for Hostages the County
Hermes his eldest son, a gallant young youth, and one whom in time might have
proved an honorable man. The Lord Harding had but one only daughter, and her
he sent under color to be brought up with the Scottish Princess, and for the
Arch Traitor (Archbishop I would say) was sent an Nephew of his, an excellent
good Scholar, and a notable Pollitician. These being sent into Scotland, they
appointed the Kings forces to be ready by the tenth of May then next ensuing:
and they in the mean time made all the provision that might be, where we will
likewise leave them.

CHAP. XX. Of a strange adventure happening in the Court of Saxony, and how the
Gentleman of the Forest, and Iago were Knighted, and how the adventure was
ended.
THere was in the Kingdom of Spain, a noble man called Segnior Adresto,
famous for his virtues and Chiualry: and having passed over a great part of the
world, in seeking and following of strange adventures, always having fortunate
success in all his enterprises, especially in his love, which he bare toward
a noble Lady of his own Country, called Leonarda, daughter and sole heir unto
ye Duke of Tolledo: one who for beauty and comeliness of body, was the only
paragon of all Spain, sought unto by many, but only inioyed by Adresto,
between whom there grew so great love, that whosoever had seen or known the
same, would have sworn, that then love there had been no greater dietie.
Which when the Duke her father understood, being loath to match her unto one of
so mean estate, although for his virtues he might compare with any, yet was
his livings very small: therefore he often warned her to avoid his company, and
at length grew in great displeasure with her, threatening to disinherit her, if
she did not obey unto his will herein. Which the young Lady doubting, at their
next meeting, made him privy withal, assuring him that for his love she could
be contented to forsake all. But yet seeing that in time her fathers good will
might be obtained, she would entreat him for a while to absence himself:
assuring him, that for her part, she would always continue faithful and
constant unto him, and never accept of any other husband, though thereby she
were disinherited. Adresto hearing her kind and loving speeches, answered,
that seeing it was her pleasure, he was contented, although to be out of her
presence would be a hell unto him: and whereas she had made him so free a
grant of her love, he protested before the heavens likewise never to forsake
her, and that before he would consent to love any other the^ herself, he would
be torn to pieces with wild horses: then delivering each other asigne of
their passed faiths, he departed. And within short time after left the
Kingdom, traveling many strange and unknown Regions, till at last coming
into the Kings of Ireland, he happened to fall in likingly with a beautiful
Damsel of that Country, but of mean parentage: her father being but a
Merchant of that Country. On whom he so doted, that he had clean forgotten,
and forsaken the chaste and virtuous Lady Lenarda: although the good Lady having
intelligence hereof, by a friend of hers, a skillful Magitian, often times sent
unto him, to cause him to call to mind his former love. At length the Duke her
father dying, and leaving her sole Mistirs and Duchess of his Dukedom, she
having with great pomp and solemnity celebrated his funerals, one day sent
for her friend the Magitian to come unto hor, of whom she demanded if there
were no means, to recall her lover Adresto again, without whom she was like
to spend her life time in care and heaviness. Adriano, (for so the Magitian
was called) made her answer, that he could not directly answer her
demand: because that she (whom he so loved) wore always on her finger a
Ring, which was the only stay of his love, which except they could get from
her, it was impossible, ever to remove his affection. Also this Ring had one
other virtue, which was that whosoever did wear it, should not loose so much
as a drop of blood in any battle whatsoever: wherefore when he combatted with
any one, (as often times he did for her love,) then had he the Ring. And unless
there could be found a Knight, that might by force conquer him in single
battle, and take away the Ring from him, it was impossible to get the same by
any deceit whatsoever. Lenarda hearing this, was as one half besides herself,
but being comforted by Adriano, (who assured her he would try the uttermost of
his skill to find out the Knight, as he had spoken of.) Then taking his leave
of her, he returned home: where by his art he framed a most rich and fair
sword, excellent curious to the eye, and to cut, the best that was then in the
whole world: this sword he inchaunted in such sort, that no man but he to whom
the conquest of Adresto appertained, might draw the same: then bringing it to
Lenarda, willed her to send one of her Squires therewith, to seek out the
Knight who should by his valor recover her love: then delivering it to one of
her Squires, whom she esteemed for his truth and secricie, with this command,
that whosoever should offer to draw forth ye sword, should first make promise
of a boon, which was to go over into Ireland, and to combat with Adresto,
accusing him for falcifying of his faith to Lenarda.

Thus the Squire (having the sword) traveled to all the Princes Courts in
Spain, and Countries thereabouts: then into France, Italy, and Germany,
never finding any one that could once move it in the Scaberd: although many
stout and hardy Knights made trial thereof, to this great grief, fearing his
travel should never have end, nor his Lady ease of her sorrow. In this manner
having traveled through most part of Germany: he arrived at the Court of
Saxony, desiring the Duke yt his Knights might make trial, if it were any
their fortunes to accomplish that, for which he had travailed she greatest
part of Christendom. Then showing his sword, he declared, that bearing the
same a whole year, he could never find any one yt might draw the same. The
Duke wondering heereat, immediately after Dinner, caused all his Knights to make
trial thereof, himself being the first, but al to no end applied they their
forces. Which when the young Prince Iago, and the Gentleman of the Forest
beheld, they presently fell on their knees before the Duke, desiring his grace
to grant them the order of knighthood, hoping that for one of them this
Adventure was reserved.

The Duke being unwilling at the first, by reason of their young age, that
being knighted, they would hazard themselves in seeking after strange
adventures, advised them to stay a year or two more, before they took so
waitie a charge on them: affirming that it was unlawful to dubbe any one,
before the age of twenty, at which time they would be strong, and able to
endure the weight of their Armor and travel, and not before. All which could
not cause them to desist from their suit, but still more earnestly they craved
the same, alleging many sundry examples of those who at younger years had
inured themselves to as great labors, as Reynaldo at the age of fifteen
years stealing from his fathers court, went into Palestina to the Christian
Army, where under great Godfry of Bullen, he obtained to be the chief scourge
to the Sarasins, and without whom, it had been impossible to have won the
holy City of Jerusalem. This and many other such like arguments they alleged,
whereby at length they obtained the Duke to consent unto them: willing them for
that night, according to the ancient custom, to watch in the Chapel. Then
turning to the Squire, he entreated him to tarry till the next day, seeing the
two young Gentlemen were so desirous. The Squire, to satis-fie the Duke,
willingly consented, although he had no great hope of their success.

The two Princes careful of their charge, having their Armor and other
necessaries provided, kept their devout watch all night, sometimes accompanied
by the young Princess, and diverse other Ladies, they passed away the time till
the morning: at what time the Duke coming unto them, accompanied with many
Lords and Knights, with his own hands buckled on their spurs, and then
drawing forth their swords, gave them the gentle Accolado. Then raising them
up, desired GOD to make them both good and valiant Knights. Then hearing divine
service, they returned into the great Hall, to make trial of the inchaunted
Sword, where first the Prince Iago as the elder, made trial, but by no means
was able to draw it, then taking it to the Gentleman of the Forest, he said,
Brother God give you better luck then I, or else this Squire is like to endure
more labor. True replied he, and I doubt it greatly, seeing that you have
mist: then putting his hands on the Hilts, he drew it forth as easily, as if
it had been an ordinary sword, to the great wonder of the Duke, and all the
beholders. Then the Squire falling on his knees, told him, that the boon
which he required, was to go into Ireland with him, where he should combat
with a Knight, being the falsest Lover that might be: and therewith declared
the whole discourse of his Lady and Adresto, as is before recited. Here we
will leave the Gentleman of the Forest, preparing himself to go with the
Squire into Ireland, to combat Adresto, concluding the first part of our
History.

FINIS.
The second part of the famous History of the two Princes, Euordanus Prince of
Denmark, and Iago Prince of Saxony, with their several adventures and
fortunes in Love.
CHAP. I. How Euordanus called the Gentleman of the Forest, having received
order of Knighthood, departed toward Ireland with the Squire of Lenarda,
Duchess of Toledo.
YOu may remember, how that in the former part of this history, the young
Princes Euordanus and Iago, having received the order of Knighthoode, and the
adventure of the inchaunted sword, being finished by Euordanus, he was
thereupon to travel into Ireland, to combat with Adresto: and now having
stayed by the Duke and Duchess entreaty, some three or four days, in which
time there was a small Bark prepared, for his better transporting himself,
and such necessaries as in his iourny should be needful unto him: and now the
wind serving fitly for their intended course, he was hastened on by the Squire
to depart, who declared unto him the great grief and heaviness, which in this
mean time his noble and excellent Lady the Duchess Lenarda endured, then which
he was sure there could be no greater torment possible.

And now all things being fitted in readiness for their departure, he came
before the Duke to take his leave, where falling down on his knees, proffering
to kiss his graces hands, the Duke lift him up from the ground, embracing him
in his arms, and with tears trickling down his manly cheeks commended him
to God, desiring him that he would return again unto his Court his adventure
being finished, with as much speed as might be, whereas he should be as
heartily welcome, as his own natural son ye prince Iago. These and many other
such like speeches the Duke then used unto him, which drove the Knight into a
great admiration, especially of the words that he should be as welcome unto
him, as the Prince Iago. By which and the strange name he was called by, it was
to be doubted whether he were the Dukes son or not: which before this time
he had never heard, nor so much as once dreampt of, so secret had his finding
been consealed from him. And being about to demand the same of the Duke, he
was put from his purpose by a messenger, which was sent unto him by the
Duchess, to will him to come unto her in her chamber: where hearing of his
taking leave of the Duke, she attended his coming, being accompanied with her
daughter the Princess Egisena, who was now attained to the age of 15 years,
and by continual frequenting the company of the Gentleman of the Forest,
somewhat touched with love toward him, and understanding by her mother (who
desired nothing more then to see them joined together in marriage) that they
were no kin, had set down her rest, if he thereto consented, to accept of no
other husband.

Thus leaving the Duke, not a little grieved for his departure, he came unto
the Duchess her chamber, where as he found both the mother and daughter, so
ouercharged with sorrow for his departure: that of a long time they were not
able to utter a word. But at length the Duchess, recovering the former use of
her tongue, with a deep sigh proceeding from her heart, which manifestly showed
the inward grief, she sustained for his departure, and with her eyes
steadfastly fixed on him, spoke as follows.

Gentleman of the Forest, for son I may no longer call you: the great love
which I have always borne unto you, I am sure you know to be no less then
that, either to your supposed brother the Prince Iago, or your sister Egisena,
although as by my former speeches, you may perceive you were not my own
natural child, but in your infancy found by my Lord the Duke in a Forest, in
the Kingdom of Denmark, of which place you have ever since been called the
Gentleman of the Forest: no man knowing of what parentage you are descended,
nor what other name then this, which the Duke gave you to call you by. These
things I have now thought good to declare unto you before your departure, that
being absent, you may the better if occasion so happen, to find out your true
and natural parents, whom I doubt not but to be such as your self shall have
no cause to grieve at, nor we cause to be sorrowful for the education bestowed
upon you, your virtues already manifesting the same.

Farther would she have proceeded, but the tears trickling down her cheeks,
stopped the passage of her farther speeches: when the young Knight having
attentively listened unto her former words, to the which those of the Duke
seemed to concure?

Replied, most worthy Princess, these your speeches has struck such an
amazedness into my understanding, that I know not well what to speak or
think, but my vntowardlinesse did always foreshowe, that I was not descended
of so royal an offspring, as my Lord the Duke: yet notwithstanding, my mind
foretells me, I am not so basely descended, but that I may hope for to
challendge my self to be a Gentleman: and make known this high order, which
my Lord the Duke has bestowed upon me of Knighthoode, not to surpass my
estate: wherefore I vow and protest before God, here in your Graces presence,
not to rest nor enjoy quiet abode in any place, until such time as I have
found out those from whom I am descended. In the mean time, I humbly entreat
you to esteem of me, though unworthily as your faithful and devoted servant:
farther desiring yt Princess Egisena, to honor me with ye title of being her
Knight, under whose protection I cannot look for ought other then good
success.

The Duchess being as joyful of this his conclusion, as sorrowful for his
vowed determination, stood still a while making no answer at all. But at last
being resolved in her mind, that now or never it was time to follow her
devised drift: fixed her eyes steadfastly on him, and turning her speeches to
her daughter, said. Egisena, I perceive now that which I always feared is come
to pass, concerning the love between you and this our new Knight, which since
I perceive to be true, and that to strive again destenie is bootelesse, I both
will and command you, on pain of incurring my displeasure, and by the
natural love you ought to bear me, I conjure you, not to conceal, but to make
known unto me, whether there be any such loue-liking between you, as outward
shows seem to make manifest: which if there be, I will seek some means to
work both your contents, which will be a cause to draw this Gentleman, the
sooner again unto this our Court.

The Princess that had already been instructed in her mothers drift, and
being likewise thereunto of her self very willing, dying her cheeks with her
maidenly blush, made her this answer. Most gracious Princess and loving
mother, I do not well know whereunto these your speeches may intend,
considering that these vain toys of love, as yet I was never acquainted with,
but yet thus much I must needs confess, that the liking which I have always
had to this Gentleman of the Forest, proceeded as I have still thought, from
the natural love of a sister toward her brother: and since the knowing of the
contrary, has continued, or I may say, bred a greater liking then to any other
whatsoever: but not in such sort, as by making choice of him, either to
displease you or my father.

The Knight being as joyful as might be, to hear them in these terms: for
howsoever darkly she spoke, yet love had so sharpened his wits, yt he gessed
very near their meaning, and coming to the Princess kissed her hands for
those unseen kindnesses, desiring her in all humility, to accept him as her
humble servant, and faithful Knight: in token whereof she would bestow some
thing on him, which in all his adventures might put him in mind of her
excellency, although her kind courtesies were already, so settled in his heart, as
it was for ever impossible to be worn out.

Farther would he have proceeded, but that the Squire earnest of his Mistrisses
charge, sent up to haste^ him away, which both the Duchess, and her daughter
unwilling to yield unto, at last consented.

Egisena for a favor delivered him a fair Diamond, which always she worn on
her finger. Thus taking his leave of them, being accompanied with the Prince
Iago, and diverse other noble men, he was conuaied unto the Seaside, where they
found his ship ready provided, and having wind at will, were ready to set
sail. There he took his leave of the Prince, and others his friends,
embracing one another with such shows of sorrow, that caused the whole
company and beholders, to dew their cheeks with tears. The Prince Iago many
times entreating to accompany him in his voyage, regarding more his company
then his fathers displeasure. But he having determined a longer voyage in his
mind: then suddenly to return, would by no means consent unto the Princes
request. Thus at length, as each thing has his time and end, seeing no
entreaty would serve, he committed him to the tuition of the almighty God,
desiring his prosperous and speedy return.

CHAP. II. How the Gentleman of the Forest, sailing toward Ireland, landed in
Northwales, where he fought with a huge Monster, and what was the success
thereof.
THE Gentleman of the Forest, being aboorde, and having taken his leave of
the Prince, and the rest of his friends, they set sail, having the wind fair,
and the Seas calm, even as if Neptune had roused up himself to welcome some
dear friend, the Dolphins, Porpises, and other strange fishes, playing above
the waters round about the Ship, as being sent of purpose to show pleasure
to the passengers: whereat our new Knight took no small content. Thus passing
away the time, somewhiles in beholding the fishes, and other sea sights, and in
pleasant and merry talk with the Pilot, and Master of the Ship, concerning
the customs and manners of the Seas, they sailed by the space of eight days,
with a prosperous and large wind, when toward the evening, the Master looking
abroad, to see whether he could discern any land, happened to see in the West
north west, a small cloud, rising in manner of a man's hand, which the more he
beheld, the blacker still it seemed, which caused him to doubt some ensuing
storm: therefore willing his company to take in their top sails, and also to
unlace their drablets and bannets, determining to try with their Cosses only.
Scarce had they obeyed half his commandment, when the Sky being before very
clear, began to ouercast, and the winds to blow in such sort, that in less
space then an hour, the Seas were grown so outrageous, that it seemed every
billow straue one with the other, which should first board their distressed
burden: the boat-swaine and his fellows, indeuouring with all their might, to
take in that little sail which they bare, and although it were but their
cosses, yet could they not do it without great danger and pain. Others found
themselves busied in pomping and casting forth the water, each man employing
his best help for their lives aid. And the Prince, although unskillful, yet
laboring as hard as any of the rest, sometimes taking his turn at the pumpe,
sometimes to lift ouer-boord such things, as might any ways be a hinderance,
to the more light working of their ship on the Seas: so that his labor was
profitable two ways, the one of it self, wherein he did as much good as any
man, the other his example, which caused every one to be the more willing to
perform their labor. Thus continued the storm for the space of two days, to
the great discomfort of all the company, but especially of the Knight, who
being ouertrauailed with labor, and his body not being to-fore used unto
the Sea, repaired into his Cabin, and casting himself on his bed, hoping to
take some easement to his restless body: but sleep, the comforter of those
that are weary, yielded him small relief, for no sooner were his eyes closed,
but that the memory of the Princess Egisenas beauty represented it self unto
him: then would he consider with himself the likelihood of his obtaining her,
as the great favor which both the Duke her father always showed unto him, and
the kind speeches at their last farewell, as also the vowed love betwixt
himself, and the Prince her Brother, which seemed to promise unto him an
assured obtaining. But on the contrary side, he would object his own
unworthiness, as being but peradventure of base or mean Parentage, then the
great and mighty Princes which were desirous of her love: and last and not
least, that his absence, (as often times it does) in her likewise might breed
forgetfulness.

Thus reuoluing many things in his mind, he determined, if God so pleased,
after his enterprise against Adresto ended, he would travel into Denmark,
hoping there to learn somewhat concerning his estate, or else peradventure to
travel along with the Squire and Adresto into Spain, where he doubted not but
that Adriano should resolve him of that doubt. In this manner passed he away
most part of the night, till toward the morning, Morpheus pitying his
restless estate, closed his eyes, causing him to enjoy a short slumber. But
long he had not slept, before yt he was awaked by a joyful cry, made by the
whole company, upon the sight of Land: but the wind being come to ye
Northward, they were forced to put in for a harbor, called at this day
Milford-hauen, where coming ashore, they determined to rest themselves, and
provide such necessaries as they wanted, against the wind should serve for
Ireland, which from thence was but a short cut.

The next day, the Gentleman of the Forest being (as is before-said) weary of
the Sea, determined to go recreate himself ashore, wherefore taking his horse
and armor, accompanied only with his Squire, he rode forth to view the
Country, which he found to be indifferent fruitful and pleasant, but could see
very few or no Inhabitants, which caused him not a little to marvel: thus
rode he on ye space of two leagues, beholding many goodly streams, and
pleasant shadows, the delight whereof, caused the way to seem very short. At
length, coming to a small Rivers side, he alighted to rest himself, and
delivering his horse to his Squire, he laid himself down at the feet of a
stately Beech tree, whose thick branches were a shelter unto him from the
piercing heat of Phoebus golden rays, where he was quickly luld asleep, with
the chirping tunes of pleasant birds, and bubling noise of the soft-slyding
stream. Long had he not rested in this pleasant place, before such time as he
was wakened by a pitiful outcry, and starting up half amazed, he beheld a
most huge and mighty Monster, in form somewhat bigger then a Cammell, his head
and face not much unlike a man, his mouth very large, as about a yard in
widenes, his teeth upwards of a foot long, his breast and forefeete, much like
to a Lion, his back large and long, and for his hinder parts they were like
unto a Bear: all his body being thick set with bristles, so hard as it was
impossible for any sword to pierce his skin. Which at the first sight caused
him to stand some what amazed, till perceiving the Monster almost to have
overtaken his Squire, whom he pursued to have devoured, he clapped on his Helm,
and taking his Lance in his hand, he ran to succor him, and coming near
unto him, smote the Monster such a blow, as well might have overthrown a good
Knight, but to him it did no harm at all, which caused him greatly to doubt
the issue of their conflict: the beast feeling himself stricken behind, left
the pursuit of the squire, and turned about to the Knight, thinking to have
devoured him, and at the first laid hold on his shield with his two fore-feete,
and with his mouth seized on his Helm, pressing the same with his long teeth,
to the no small doubt and astonishment of the Knight, but as good hap was, he
might then thank have, for in clasping on his Helm he had forgotten to fasten
it, which was an occasion, that at the first pull it came from his head, which
otherwise would have pierced his brains. This happened not a little to the
advantage of the Knight, who although his head were unarmed, yet that want of
Armor so armed the Monsters teeth, that for his life he could not clear
himself thereof. Which gave the Knight occasion to make a full thrust at his
breast, where the skin being not so hard as in the other parts of his body,
gave entrance to his trusty blade, which pierced so deep, that it caused
great abundance of blood to follow after it: which the beast perceiving, gave
a loud cry, and withal let go his shield, and took hold on his left
shoulder, giving him so kind a salutation with his sharp nails, that he
brought away the armor and flesh, hard to the bone, receiving in the mean time
a sound blow on the deformed head, which caused him to reele backwards. But his
skin was so hard, that it pierced no more then if he had stricken upon an
Anuile of steel. Thus continued they a great while, the Monster still
assailing, and he avoiding, watching his best advantage to make thrusts, seeing
blows did nothing at all avail. At length, being weary, and something
fainting by reason of his hurt, he gave back a little to refresh himself,
which the Monster perceiving, lay down, and with his claws sought means to
clear himself of the Helm which hung fast in his teeth, but before he was
able to free himself thereof, the Knight who slacked not to take the least
advantage that might be, gave him so sore a hurt in the belly, that it caused
both his blood and guts to issue out together, which the Monster feeling, and
striving to recover himself on his feet, strained so much, that he caused
his hellish soul to depart from his damned body.

The Knight seeing himself Victor, kneeled down immediately on the ground,
rendering praise and thanks to the almighty GOD, for his prosperous and happy
success in this his first enterprise. Then his Squire coming unto him, he
made have to bind up his wounds, and to depart toward his Ship, where he
might with more ease and less danger, be cured of his hurts, which grieved him
not a little, especially yt in his left shoulder. But before such time as they
were fully ready to depart, there came unto them an old man, clothed like a
Hermit, his head and beard being as white as milk, bearing in one hand a
small viole of water, and in the other a box of ointment, and when he came
unto them, he saluted them very curtiously, telling the Knight, that of long
time he had expected his coming into that distressed place.

The Knight as courteously regreeted him, and afterward demanded, if he knew
any place where he might be cured of some small wounds which he had received,
so which the Hermit replied, that within less then half a league he had a
small Cell, whether if it pleased him to go, he would not doubt but within few
days to cure him: in ye mean time, he would a little wash and anoint the
same, with such water and ointment, as he had for the same purpose brought
with him, the Knight glad hereof, gave him hearty thanks, and having had his
wounds dressed, departed with him toward his Cell, where his wounds were cured,
as hereafter you shall hear, with the occasion of the Monsters being in that
place. In the mean time, we will roturne to speak somewhat of the Lord of
Menew and Sir Henault, whom the former part of of this history, left remaining
in the Court of France, in ye company of the English Prince, and diverse other
Noblemen.

CHAP. III. How Sir Henault, and the Lord of Menew, departed from the Court of
France, and arrived in Holland, where they heard of the adventure of Coruew:
and how they were both taken prisoners.
AFter Prince Edward had overcome ye Duke of Orleance, and continued the
defense of the Princess Emelias beauty, to his great honor and renown, he
remained a while in the French Court greatly feasted: where for a time he
stayed with him the two noble Danes, the Lord of Menew, and Sir Henault,
intertaining them with great familiarity and kindness. But being at length
weary of idleness, and desirous to follow after their quest: they departed
toward Belgica, being earnestly entreated by the English Prince to have
accompaned him into England. Thus departed they onwards on their iourny, still
making diligent inquiry after their King, of whom, nor of Sir Gwaltero they
could learn any certainty. In this manner rode they together, through most
part of France, leaving behind them in all places, a famous memorial of their
virtuous acts: which caused their names to be spread far and near. But at
length, passing the spacious Kingdom of France, they arrived in the
unfortunate Dukedom of Holland: unfortunate in regard of ye many vilde
customs erected, by the tirrany of their ungodly Duke: as is in the first part
of this History declared.

Scarce were they entered one whole days iourny within this province, before
that Fame, the Herault of reports, had brought unto their ears, the custom of
the Castle of Coruew, with the many famous explots there exercised, with the
innumerable number of Knights, which had there lost themselves: among whom
there was one Knight for his exceeding valor, far famoused above the rest,
who by the description of body and Arms which he bare, they presently imagined
to be the Lord Gwaltero.

Wherefore determining either to recover him, or loose themselves, they set on
thetherwards, where the next morning they arrived so me two hours before that
Phoebus untired steedes, with their never resting Chariot, had attained the mid
heavens: and coming within the view of the Castle, the strength thereof struck
a sudden amazedness in them: but considering the cause of their coming, was
to deliver him whom they entirely loved, and also that to a valiant heart,
nothing should seem difficult, and withal, the harder the enterprise, the more
is the honor obtained by the victor: they determined rather to die, then to
return not making trial of the adventure being soneere, which would be for
ever a great dishonor unto the^. The Lord of Menew desiring to make the first
trial, whereunto Sir Henault willingly consented, hoping that if he were
overcome, his honor in obtaining the victory would be the greater.

Thus being agreed, tthe Lord of Menew went presently unto the shield, giving
it such a blow that he cleft it in two in the midst, which being seen by
those that guarded the bridge, immediately one of them arming himself, came
forth mounted on a mighty steed, of a brown bay color, with a little white
star in the forehead, and one white foot: and coming with an easy trot
unto the Lord of Menew, demanded of him wherefore he sought, and what was the
occasion of his so outrageous striking of the shield. The Lord of Menew
answered, that his coming thither was to seek for a Knight, which bare in
his shield two Lions rampant sable, in a feeld argent, who as he understood,
had been by treason subdued and imprisoned within that Castle, and for the
striking of the shield, he listed not to give him any other reason, then that
he hoped with ye fame Lance, to pierce both his shield and his heart. The other
replied, that such a Knight indeed was there imprisoned, whose hauty heart,
caused him attempt that which he could not accomplish: in pursuing whereof, by
force and not by treason he was vanquished, and according to the custom of
their Castle, made forfeiture of his life, but that for his valor, they were
contented he should a while live to help to strengthen their guard, if he
could thereto be won. Then turning about his horse, they both prepared to
fetch their carrere: and placing their staves in their rests, they met together
so rudely, that the Knight of the bridge was sent to measure his length on the
ground, being mortally wounded with a splinter of the Lance in the visage, the
Lord of Menew likewise, being so sore shaken with ye encounter, as he had much
to do to keep his Saddle: then presently came forth other two Knights, well
armed, and mounted, crying to him to prepare himself to encounter them: which
he presently did, and meeting together, struck one of them so strong a blow,
that missing toward it with his shield, his Lance passed clean through his
body: but the other Knight, breaking his Lance in the midst of his shield,
caused him to tumble over his horse tail, but it was not long before such time
as he had recovered his feet, his Squire being ready with the horse of the
first Knight, on which he presently mounted, and drawing forth his sword, was
presently ready to assault the other, who seeing him dismounted, made no great
have, but with vain glorious bravery, passed on his carrere, when turning
about and perceauing him to be remounted, drew forth his sword, saying, Sir
Knight, well may you thank your Squire for so quick puruaying of a new horse
for you, but I fear me he shall but little steed you against the force of my
arm, which has once already sent you to measure your loutish length upon the
ground.

The Lord of Menew, being madded with rage, stayed not to answer him with
words, but with his sword lent him so friendly a blow, that caused him to bend
his head even to his breast: but quickly recovering himself again, he struck
the other such ablow, that had he not warded the same with his shield, he had
gone near to have cleft his head in two: thus continued they a while,
sometimes the one, sometimes the other seeming to have the better, Fortune so
equally guiding the balance, that it was hard to judge, whether side should
obtain victory. At last, the Lord of Menew, imagining with himself that to be
long in conquering, would be a cause that himself in the end should be
overcome, determined either to obtain a speedy conquest, or a speedy death:
wherefore, uniting all his forces together, and raising himself in his
stirrups, he gave his enemy such a recombendibus on the head, that the steel
being of too weak a force to resist ye weight thereof, gave free passage to
the sword, which found a ready way to his brains, causing him to fall as dead
as a herring unto the ground.

But before he could have any space to rest himself, or almost to breath, came
forth other two, charging him both at once, and he as gallantly answered
their charge, receiving both their staves upon his shield, which caused his
horse a little to stagger backwards, but as they passed by, their Lances being
broken, he gave one of them so sound a stroke on the side of the head, before
he looked for any such matter, that he left him but half a face to court his
Mistress withal: then providing to encounter the other, betwixt whom there
passed a fierce and bloody conflict, but in the end the victory remained unto
the Lord of Menew, who although he were grievously wounded, yet his heart being
not a whit feared or any way dismayed, went forwards unto the bridge, whether
Sir Henault likewise came, persuading him to give over the enterprise to him,
considering he was so sore hurt, but he that never knew what fear was, could
not be so lightly persuaded, wherefore desiring Sir Henault, if he were
overcome to do his best, he made choice of such parts of arms as he wanted,
and taking a strong Lance, he went forwards toward the end of the bridge,
where he was incountred by two of the five Knights that kept the same, betwixt
whom there was a long and dangerous conflict, but in the end, through
faintness and great loss of blood, the Lord of Menew striking a full blow at
one of them, sent himself after to the ground, his legs being no longer able
to sustain the weight of his body, yielding thereby the victory to them, who
were not able long to enjoy the same: for the one of them even as he fell,
being in as weak estate, struck likewise at him, and missing his blow, sent
the whole burden of his body to embrace him in death, whom in life he had
persued so deadly. The other likewise being in little better state, seeing his
companion fall, thought to help him, and stooping down to lift him up, fell
himself likewise into a trance.

Sir Henault fearing least his companion had been slain, went presently to
have taken up his body, but was hindered by the other three Knights: who all at
once assaulted him, and being afoote in like sort as he was, there began a
bloody, though unequal combat, each party seeking to overcome. Thus fought
they a long time, giving and receiving many wounds: Sir Henault giving such
blows, as well made show he meant to sell his liberty or life at a dear rate:
so long they fought, that at length two of them fell dead at his feet, the
other seeing his fellows slain, thought it more for his lives safety to trust
to his legs then his hands, so that turning his back he ran toward the
Castle, from whence presently issued, five other Knights armed, putting
themselves between Sir Henault, and the runne-away.

Here again began a more fierce conflict then the former, by reason they
were five hardy approved Knights, and his former battle having served, but
as whetting of his courage, caused him to lay on such blows, that in short
time he had sent two of their souls to seek passage at Charons ferry:
himself and the other three being greatly wearied, stood still a while to
rest themselves: when Sir Henault considering with himself the cause of his
fighting, as to release his noble friend Gwaltero, and also to be revenged for
the death of the Lord of Menew, he was so repleat with ire, yt running upon
them as a man enraged, he struck one of them such a blow, as he severed his
head from his shoulders, then laying on at the other two such mighty blows,
that he forced them in the end to yield up their souls, as a sacrifice to his
sword: which being ended, he himself being-ouer traveled, and having lost
great abundance of blood, sat himself down on a stone, where he had not
long sitten before he fell into aswound, which being seen by the Knights of the
Castle, they came forth and took both him, and the body of the Lord of Menew,
with the rest of whom there was any hope of recovery, and carried them into the
Castle, where in respect of their valor, they caused to be carefully attended,
and their wounds to be cured: persuading them in the mean time to be partners
with them, in garding this their lewd custom. Which when they being well,
refused, were immediately put down into the prison, where the King and Gwaltero
remained.

CHAP. IIII. How the Hermit declared unto the Knight, the discourse of the
Monster, and afterward being cured of his wounds, was brought unto an old
Chapel, where he gained an excellent Armor, being sometimes the Armor of
the famous Prince Lionell.
THE Gentleman of the Forest, being brought by the Hermit and his Squire unto
the Hermitage, he was forthwith disarmed, and laid on a silly coutch, on which
the old Hermit used to lie, and being carefully looked unto, and attended on
by the Hermit, within 3. days he was indifferently well recovered, and
sitting up in his bed, he desired the old man to declare unto him, as he
before had promised, the discourse of the Monster which he had killed.

The old man glad to see him so well recovered, and also desirous to pleasure
him in any thing he could, began thus. Most worthy Knight, not long since there
was remaining in this Country, a most vile and wicked Governor, named
Querenus, a man for the detestable wickedness which he lived in, hated both of
God and man, for what virgin or beautiful wife was there in this Country,
which if he liked, but he would force to accomplish his lustful appetite: yea
to such a height of evil was he grown, that he neither feared God nor man,
knowing no heaven but his worldly pleasures, nor fearing no other hell but the
misery of this life, the which he continued to the mortal grief of all his
subjects: who in the end, being wearied and ouerburthened in this intolerable
misery, chose rather to end their lives speedily, then continually to be
tormented by this blood-thirstie Tyrant. Wherefore gathering themselves
together, they made head against the Tyrant, and after a long war, they
prevailed so against him, that he was forced secretly to abandon his Country,
and being only accompanied with two men, taking a small boat, which he
found ready provided, fled away to the Sea, where having been some fix days,
at last was put a shore in an Island, not far distant hence, where in times
past, the excellent and famous Magitian Bardus sometimes dwelt, where being
landed, and calling to mind the estate which he now was brought into,
determined there to take up his habitation, and to prevent both himself and
his company, from any hope or desire to escape, immediately suncke the boat
wherein they had escaped, and afterward, being diligently searching in a
certain Cave, happened to find diverse books of Magic, which he took great
delight in, minding to study and practice the same. And so mightily profited
he therein, that in very short time he grew very expert in the same: and at
length, growing old, and calling to mind his former life past, and considering
the wrong which he thought he had sustained by his subjects, it caused him to
determine how to be revenged on them, which in this sort he brought to pass.

There is in the westermost parts of America, a small Island very fruitful, but
whether by nature, or by some other accident, or determination of Fortune,
only inhabited by diverse huge and execrable Monsters, there-hence by his
deuilish Art, did this ungodly Querenus cause to be brought the huge monster,
which you to your endless honor have so valiantly slain: and placing him
here, by that means thought fully to be revenged, where by the space of
twenty years he has now remained, to the utter ruin and destruction of this
Country, laying it utterly wast and desolate, having devoured so many Christian
bodies, that it grieves my very soul to think of, no man before this your
coming, ever daring to adventure himself against him, although many times
there has many great companies assembled themselves, to have assailed him, but
coming into his presence, the very sight of him has put them in such a fear,
as not able to endure, they have been forced to turn their backs and fly,
trusting more to their heels then their hands, many of them being not able to
fly so fast as their fellows, where forced to stay behind, and remain as
food unto the ugly Monster: but now (God be thanked) by your noble prowess,
brought unto his end.

The Prince received no small admiration heereat, wondering that a man should
be so wicked, as to revenge his wrong by so hateful a means. But to bring him
out of this his imaginations, the Hermit would discourse with him of diverse
other matters, sometimes of one matter, and then of another. And now the Knight
having remained by the space of ten days in the Hermitage, he was
indifferent well recovered, during which time he was many times visited by his
own company, and also by the inhabitants of the Country, which came daily to
see him. For by this time had Fame so spread abroad his hautie exployt, that
there came many from diverse Countries adjoining, offering themselves, and all
that they had to be at his disposition: but he being not minded to stay there
longer then that his wounds were thoroughly whole, gave them thanks for their
kind proffer, telling them yt he could not accept of the the same, by reason
he was to follow a certain earnest adventure which he was in quest of. Thus
passing away the time until he was fully whole, the day before he meant to
depart toward his ship, the old Hermit being in talk with him, told him of a
certain adventure not far of, which in his younger years, he did remember
to have seen many to make trial thereof, but never heard of any to have
attained the accomplishment of the same.

The Knight being desirous to know the same, desired the Hermit to declare it
unto him, which he did in this manner. Not far hence (quoth he) there stands a
small Chapel, situate at the foot of an hill, now altogether ouergrowne
with briars and bushes, by reason of the Monsters cruelty, which lately to
your eternal renown, you so famously have vanquished and slain: in former
time this Chapel was dedicated to the divine service of GOD, by the renowned
King Flintus, Prince of the Brittons, in the time that the Romans ruled here
with their mighty Legions, and afterward beautified and adorned by ye famous
Prince Lionell his son, with many sumptious and costly ornaments. In the
midst of which a little before his death, he caused his own Armor, being one
of the best in ye world, and with which he had accomplished many excellent
atchieuements, to be hanged up there, to be kept for his eternal memory. Where
it remained a great while untouched of any, only through the privilege of the
place, until the time of the famous Arthur, at which time ye excellent
Magitian Merlin knowing that there would be many, which not respecting the
sin of sacrilege, would not stick to take away so precious a Jewel as was
the same, cast forthwith so mighty an inchauntment on the Armor, that none but
such a one, who in his time should excel all others, both in valor, courtesy
and loyalty, should be able to take down the same.

Now not long after, according to his imagination it fell out, for many being
desirous to obtain so good an Armor, made trial to take the same away, but
hetherunto there was no man so hardy, as once to move it. Wherefore I am fully
persuaded, that it was ordained only for you, in whom I may boldly say,
remains the greatest valor and magnanimity, that may be possible in any
Knight now living, as already your deeds have manifested. The prince thanking
him for his undeserved praises, attributing them rather to his love and
affection toward him, then for any merrite he knew in himself worthy the
least of them: withal desiring the good old man, to accompany him thither,
where he would likewise make trial of his fortune, as many others had done
before him, albeit he had no hope to attain that, which so many good Knights
had failed of.

Thus departing from the Hermitage, they went the next way toward the
Chapel, where they arrived about the time they were wont to sing their
evening Mass there, at their coming they found it desolate, the doors and
windows ouer-growne with briars and nettles, the walls ruinous, and all things
else grown into decay, which caused not only the ancient Hermit, but also
the whole company to shed tears from their eyes. Then at the request of the
Prince, the Hermit sang Even song unto them, which had not been heard there in
twenty years before.

Their prayers being ended, they went up in a small I Will of the Chapel, where
hung the foresaid Armor, with diverse other Relics, which he beheld, with a
great desire to enjoy the same: then lifting up his eyes to heaven, imploring
God to be his aid, he stretched forth his hand to take them down from their
place; which he (...) without any pain at all, to the no small admiration of
the beholders. Then pulling of his own Armor, he armed himself with this
which he had gotten, which fitted him so well, as if it purposely had been
made for him. The Armor was of a green color, representing a field full of
Orange trees bearing fruit, some fallen, some ripe as ready to fall, and some
again green, as but now budding, which wrought such a content unto the
Princes mind, as not any thing might be greater. The shield also he took on
his arm, and although it was impersable, yet was it framed of such a
substance, that it was as light as any ordinary shield, the device being in a
field Verte, three Lions rampant, or signifying indeed, three Lions which the
famous Lyonell slew in the Kingdom of Spain, as you may read in that
History, and from which likewise he was called Lyonqueller.

CHAP. V. How the Prince Euordanus departing out of Walls, arrived in Ireland,
naming himself the Knight of the Lions, and what happened unto him on his way
toward Dublin.
THe Prince having thoroughly recovered him self of his wounds which he
received of the Monster, and having gained the Armor and shield of the famous
Lionell, departed toward ye harbor of Milford, taking his leave of the
courtious Hermise, and the rest of the inhabitants of the Country: many of
whom were desirous to have kept him company, but he would not in any wise
accept thereof. And now being come unto the harbor, he found his ship in a
readiness, and having the wind indifferent fair, they set sail toward
Ireland, where the next day they arrived in the famous River of Waterford:
where being come to an ancor, they went on shore to view the pleasantness of
the Country.

Which at that time was indifferent delightful, by reason of the many pleasant
springs, which descended from the Mountains, causing with their rumbling noise
a most delightful harmony. The next day the Prince accompanied only with his
own Squire, and the Squire of Lenarda, whom he willed in any wise not to make
him known, otherwise thenby the name of the Knight of the Lions. Departed
toward the City of Dublin, whereas Adresto remained, in the delightful
company of Valeria, for so was the Merchants daughter named, of whom he was so
greatly enamored, and for whose sake he accomplished diverse and sundry combats,
defending her beauty against al comers, to his no small fame and renown: for
that within the space of two years he had overcome and subdued, above a
thousand Knights, not at any time himself having received the foil.

Thetherwards rode the Knight of the Lions, coasting over Mountains and
Valleys: the first day not happening on any adventure worth the recital. The
next day in the morning, a little after he was departed from the place whereas
they had line that night, there met him a Damsel, mounted on a small hackny,
making marvelous have, and coming unto him, casting her self from her horse
to the ground, spoke in this manner. Most courtious and valiant Knight, for so
much my mind assures you to be: let the humble petition of the most
distressed Damsel in the world, move your nohle heart to pity and relieve
this my cruel disaster, which without the aid of you or some other valiant
Knight is now incurable, wherefore by your solemn oath of Knighthood, by
which you are bound to defend all distressed persons, especially Ladies and
Damsels, and also by her whom you love most, I conjure you, to aid and defend
me in a most right and just quarrel.

The Knight beholding her woeful iesture, with her solemn coniurations, which
she uttered with such abundance of sighs, and tears flowing down from the
fountains of her eyes, as might have moved the hardest heart to relent, caused
her to stand up, and willed her to declare the effect and cause of this her
complaint, assuring her, that if her cause were corespondent to her sorrows,
she had met with one who would either loose his life, or work her content. The
Damsel being comforted with this his promise, rose up from the ground, and
wiping the tears from her eyes, began thus. Most worthy Knight, know that not
passing five leagues hence, there dwelt sometimes a famous and valiant Knight,
who in the flower of his age proved still fortunate in all his enterprises,
especially in his love toward a noble Dame of this Country, named Molenda,
whom at length by the consent of their friends he inioyed in lawful marriage,
and lived together a long time in great joy and content: and in their latter
years GOD blessed them with a fair daughter, whom they named Modesta, happy
in that she was descended from so virtuous Parents, but afterward most
unfortunate, as by the process of my speeches you shall understand. For
Eugenius, (for so was the ancient Knight my father called) being stricken in
years, and having no more children but my self, who then had attained unto
the age of twelve years, my Father (as I have before said) being stricken in
age, and also grievously vexed with an extreme malady, called unto him my
mother and my self, and after some fatherly exhortations to me given, he
turned unto my mother and said.

My dear and most beloved Molenda, knowing that my fatal time is at hand, and
that death, who spares no man, has already seized on my body, I have thought
good before my death, to recommend this our daughter unto your most loving and
motherly care, desiring you in any case, not to permit or suffer her, being
come unto ripeness of years, to match with any of this Province, which unto
my soul would be most grievous: and yt during her nonage, you would see her
most carefully instructed in virtue, whereby she may be worthy of this patrimony
whereunto she is borne. My father having uttered these or such like speeches,
and finding himself to draw toward his end, embraced us both in his arms,
and turning about his face, immediately departed out of this wretched world,
leaving us to bewail this our cross fortunes. Now after we had solemnised
his funerals, and had according to the use of this Country, by the space of
one whole year, in mournful attire bewailed his death: it happened on a time,
that my mother being desirous to recreate her ouer-troubled mind, with some
delightful pleasures, desired a great number of her neighbors, as well
Knights, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Damsels, as also others of meaner sort, to come
unto her Castle, where they were all heartily welcome, and worthily feasted by
the space of three days, during which space, they past away the time with many
sundry disports, to the content of us all.

But alas here began the head or spring of all my grief, as by the sequel of
my speeches you shall perceive, for amongst this company, there was a Knight
whose liuelihood joined with ours, a man endued with rites sufficient, had the
Gods graced him so well with virtue and good conditions. This Knight, I say,
fayning himself to be attached with my beauty, desired me of my mother in
marriage. But she respecting more the riches of the mind, then the worldly
wealth of the man, gave him a flat denial, alleging my youth to be such, as
was very unfit for a husband: and that to match a young gerle without a settled
affection, was the next way to lead her into a life far worse then death:
for then to be matched where one cannot love, there is on earth no greater
torment.

He taking this denial in very ill part, departed unto his own Castle,
being not passing three leagues of, where he remained awhile, contemplating
revenge in his heart, and devising by what means he might accomplish the same,
at last determined to win yt by force, which by fair means he could not hope
to attain. And being settled in this resolution, he gathered together the
greatest forces yt he could: and within a month after, no one suspecting such
villainy, in the night time most traitorously assaulted our Castle, where
having gotten the possession thereof, slew all those who made any resistance
against him. And taking my mother in her Chamber, threatened her with she like
cruelty as he had showed unto the rest, if forthwith she did not give me
her woeful daughter, to be his Concubine: for now having gotten our possessions
by force, he disdained to have me to his wife, which I being in the next reeme
and hearing, immediately threw my self out at a window, where by chance faling
to the ground without any great hurt, I found his Palfry ready tide, on which
forthwith I mounted, flying away as fast as I could, never staying in any
place, until now meeting with you, of whom I hope to receive help and comfort.

Hare she stayed her speeches, pouring forth abundance of tears, which caused
the young Knight greatly to pity her: vowing unto her, if that they remained
his coming, he would so punish their detestable treasons, as should be both to
her content, and also an example to all those, who should afterward attempt the
like. And willing her to lead on the way, they rode onwards most part of the
day, not meeting with any one till evening, about the time that Vesperus
appearing in the West, gave them warning to take up their lodging, which
forthwith they did: for coming into a little thick wood, and the Sky waxing
dark, whereby they feared to miss their way, they laid themselves down under
a thick tuffe of trees, where after they had refreshed themselves, with such
viands as his Squire had brought with him, they betook themselves to sleep,
the Prince not so much as putting off his Helm, for fear least they might be
set on in their sleep: and he also appointed the two Squires to watch by
turn, so much did his mind misdoubt the wickedness of those people, who
inhabited thereabouts, given only to rapine and theft.

CHAP. VI. How the Knight of the Lions sleeping in a wood, was set on by a
company of thieues: and after, how he came to the Castle of the woeful Lady
Molenda, where he slew the traitor Calepin.
THE Knight being accompanied with his two Squires, and the Damsel, had
scarcely slept until midnight, when his Squire, whose turn was to watch, gave
him notice that he did hear a noise not far off, which he did judge to be
of some company coming toward them. The Prince, immediately taking his shield
on his arm, and putting himself in a readiness, commanded them to lie still,
fayning themselves to sleep, which they did, when presently they beheld ten
thieues armed with swords and other weapons, who coming near them, conferred
amongst themselves, whether it were best to kill them as they slept, or else to
set upon them, and having bound them, to rob the^ of that they had: which
when the Knight heard he immediately start up, and taking his sword in his hand,
ran upon them, where the first he met with he sent to Pluto his kingdom, to
give an account of his wicked life: his fellows beholding his mishap, laid on
with all their forces, vowing to be revenged for his death, whom soon after
they did accompany: for the Knight being both strong, and also well armed
with the Armor of Sir Lionell, made no account of their blows, which to him
did no more hurt then if they had laid on their blows upon some flintie
Rock. Thus continued the fight by the space of an hour, in which time he had
dispatched six of them: the others thinking to save themselves by flight, were
stayed by the two Squires, who slew one of them outright, the others falling
on their knees desired pardon, which the Knight forthwith granted them, causing
the^ to swear to give over that kind of life, which they did: the one of them
being something stricken in years, betook himself afterward to a Hermitage,
where he spent the rest of his life in prayer, and bewailing of his sins, an
other entreated him to accept of him as his slave, which the Prince was the
more willing to do, in regard that he should serve him as a guide, during his
travel in that Country, which unto a stranger is very perrilous.

And truly afterward he did not repent the saving of his life, for that he did
him good service, as you shall read in the sequel of the History. After this
conflict, the Knight and his company remained all the remnant of the night
discoursing of many matters, in which the thief declared unto him the fashion
of the Country, which unto the Knight seemed very strange. Now beautiful
Aurora having changed her mourning weed, and cladde herself in her richest
robes, to welcome her dear beloved bridegroom the sun, the Knight of the
Lions with his company mounted on horseback, all saving his new entertained
servant Gillimo, for so was the thief called whom he had received into his
service: and taking his nearest way to the Castle of Molenda, they traveled on
until it was about nine of ye clock, at what time they arrived there, (even as
Callapin having rifled the same, was ready to depart, causing two of his
companions to dreg the good old Lady by the hair, minding to carry her unto a
Castle of his, where she should remain prisoner, until such time as she
should deliver her daughter, with the whole inhearitance into his custody,)
which when the Knight of the Lions beheld, he set spurs unto his horse, and
having almost overtaken them, said, Stay villains, and declare wherefore you
use that Lady in such vile sort, or else you shall dearly abide it. Callapin
turning about, and seeing but one Knight pursuing them, said, I list not to
declare the cause unto thee, but if thou get thee not packing, my Lance shall
teach thee the guerdon due for thy too much over boldness. Then placing their
staves in their rests, they ran one against the other with all their forces,
and meeting together, their encounter was so furious, that Callapin was thrown
to the ground being very sore bruised with the fall. The other passed on half
astonished, as never having received the like buffet. Then turning about his
horse with his sword drawn, he rode toward Callapin, who by this time had
recovered his feet, which the Knight of the Lions perceiving, dismounted
himself, delivering his horse unto Gillimo, who by this time was come unto
them: here began a most dangerous and fierce foot combat, for Callapin was
one of the best Knights in all Ireland, and knew well how to defend himself,
but yet far unequal to the other: who pursued him with so many huge and
weighty blows, breaking his shield and Armor in pieces, that he caused the
blood to issue forth abundantly: himself through the goodness of his Armor
not having received any wound, so that it manifestly appeared, which way the
victory would bend it self: had it not been that the rest of Callapins
company, (who perceived him almost overcome) put themselves in his defense:
Here again the battle began to grow doubtful, they being eight, and all on
horseback, whereby they had the far greater advantage: which the good Knight
perceiving, and seeing there was no way to avoid this danger but by his own
prowess, gave Callapin so sound a blow on the head, that cleaving both Helm
and head to the teeth, caused him to fall dead to the ground: and making as if
he would have fled, he came to Gillimo, and mounting himself on horseback, he
incountred one of them, who breaking his staff on his good shield, was sent
besides his saddle to measure his length on the ground, where to make him sure
for doing any further harm, Gillimo took pains to cut off his head. But now
was the other seven come unto him, who all at once charged him with their
Lances, in such sort, that his horse not being able to endure the encounter,
fell under him, but soon was he again remounted by his Squire, who brought
him Callapins horse, then began he to lay on such blows, as well he gave them
to understand, yt they could not long endure against him, from some cutting
their arms from their bodies, overthrowing others to the ground, who never
could rise again, for that the two Squires and Gillimo made them safe, by
cutting their throats: thus continued the battle two long hours, the Knight
of the Lions never having leisure to breathe himself, so obstinate were they
in the seeking of their own deaths: which by this time six of them had
gained: the other two, seeing their fellows all slain, betook themselves to
flight, hoping thereby to save their lives, but being pursued by the Knight,
they were soon overtaken, leaving their lives for a satisfaction of their
former offenses. Which when Molenda perceived, with her Daughter, who by this
time was come unto her, cast themselves at his feet, and gave him most hearty
thanks for their delivery, proffering him all that they had, if he would
accept thereof. But he raising them from the ground, willed them to render
thanks to GOD, who had sent him as a scourge to punish such wicked offenders,
as were those whom he had vanquished.

Then taking their way into the Castle, they remained there all that night,
where they were feasted by the Mother and the Daughter, who seeing him so young
and beautiful, admired how he could be of such force, to effect such deeds as
he had brought to pass: therefore desiring to know what he was, Molenda
began in this sort: Most valiant Knight, seeing you will not receive any
thing of us, whereby we might manifest unto you the thankfulness of our minds,
yet I beseech you let us know unto whom we are so much bounden, whereby in our
prayers we may record this your memorable action. The Knight answered, As for
that you demand, I cannot satisfy you, because I know not mine own estate,
but where I am known, I am called the Knight of the Lions, by reason of these
Lions which I bear on my shield. Farther they would have questioned with him,
but fearing to displease him, they gave over: and having brought him unto his
Chamber, they committed him to GOD, where that night, by reason of his extreme
weariness, and his watching the night before, he slept very soundly.

Where we will leave him awhile, and return to declare what happened in the
mean time to Prince Edward of England, whom you may remember in the former
part of this History, intended to demand the beautiful Princess Emilia, of
her Father the King of France.

CHAP. VII. How the Prince of England demanded Emilia of her father in
marriage, and of the strange adventure that happened in the French Court, whereby
all the chief Knights were forced to forsake the Court.
IT is declared in the first part of this history, how that Prince Edward of
England, being in the French Court, where he overcame the Duke of Orleance, and
after maintained the Princess Emilia, to be the beautifullest Lady in the
world, of whom he grew so far inamoured, that he determined to demand her
of the King her father. Wherefore one day being in a melancholy humor, walking
in a delightful garden, joining to the Palace to recreate himself, the King
likewise came thither, being accompanied with one page only, and finding the
Prince somewhat pensive, demanded the cause thereof: to which he replied. The
cause of this my dumpes, in which you say I now am in, proceeds partly from
your self, in regard I fear your denial in a matter, for which I mind to be
a suter unto you: which fear drives me into a doubt, whether I were best to
speak in the same, fearing to be denayd, or else conceals the same to my
self, which likewise may breed a farther danger.

The King a while studying with himself, what the matter might be, at length
gave him this answer. Most noble Prince, the love which I bare unto you is
such, that it causes me not to dissemble with you, wherefore know that I
cannot choose but take these your speeches, in very unkind part, howsoever by
you spoken: for if the matter be reasonable which you would request, then how
far you wrong me in doubting my consent therein, I refer to God only, who
knows the thoughts of my heart. If unreasonable, to your self, who knows what
it is from ones friend to expect those things, which he cannot well without
his great prejudice grant: wherefore declare boldly what it is that troubles
your mind, and assure your self, you shall find me willing to satisfy you
therein, if it be not greatly to the prejudice of my honor, and state of this
my Kingdom. The Prince hearing this friendly, and to him joyful conclusion:
replied, that he did greatly thank his Majesty, for that great love which he
did assure him of: wherefore now putting all fear and doubt aside, he would
declare the same unto him, which was this: that being greatly wounded with the
virtues, and beauty of the Princess Emilia his daughter, whom in heart he had
vowed to love, and fearing least he had otherwise disposed of her, indeed was
the cause of his pensiveness.

Which when the King heard, with a smiling countenance made him this answer:
and is it possible, that beauty can cause such alteration in you, or else that
love can so soon take possession of your heart, as coming free to this my
Court, where you have scarcely remained one month: but indeed your combat with
the Duke our Cousin, and after hazarding your self in the same Challenge, did
cause me, in sort to imagine, that you were somewhat entangled in those nets.

But now to the purpose, as she is my daughter, so do I think she will not
make her choice without my consent, neither I being her father, will force her
consent where she does not love, but if by fair means she may be won
heereunto, assure your self, that the house of France, is most willing to
link it self in love and amity with the Prince of England, whose noble
valor, deserves to be highly had in estimation.

The Prince for this his kind grant, would needs have kissed his royal hands,
which the King would not suffer him to do, but embracing him in his arms,
departed immediately into the Palace, and coming into the Queens chamber of
presence, called for the Princess Emilia, and willing all save the Queen, and
her to a void the presence, he demanded of her, whether there were any love
between her and the English Prince: at which demand, she dying her Princely
cheeks with a maidenly blush, and falling on her knees, answered. Most
gracious father, considering that in concealing the truth from you, being
thereof demanded, I shall not only break the bounds of duty by being
disobedient, but also offend God in making of a lie: know therefore, that
since the day wherein he overcame the Duke of Orleance, I have so entangled my
self in his love, which before being by him sued unto I made scorn of, that I
can find no way to alter the same, but by death only, which rather then it
should be to your dislike, I would willingly endure were it neuere so cruel.

The King being joyful heereat, yet seeming to be discontented, said: In
faith and is it possible, that thou most fond and foolish gearle, should so
much forget the bounds of duty and virtue, as without my consent, so to settle
thy fancy on a stranger: but I doubt not but thou will as soon repent thy
choice, as thou have forgotten thy duty in choosing, for who knows whether he
being a young amorous Prince, has not made some other choice already, where
then are thy hopes, or what will become of thy love. The Princess hearing her
father in these terms, knew not well what answer to make, but at length
with tears in her eyes, and fetching a deep sigh from her heart, she besought
him to consider she force and power of love, which was of such might, that who
most sought to strive against it, was the more cruelly therewith in the end
wounded: and that as yet her love being known to none, seeing it so greatly
disliked his Majesty, she would for ever keep close, although it did cost
her, her life: which she was sure it would do, seeing it had taken already
such deep rooting in her heart. The King seeing her constancy, and loath to
grieve her any farther, took her by the arm, and raising her from the ground,
bid her to be of good comfort, for seeing that her affection proceeded from
virtue, and not of any wanton or lustful appetite, he did both allow of it,
and yield consent unto the choice which she had made, willing her farther, to
esteem of the Prince, as one who not only dearly loved her, but also was
worthy to be beloved, both for his valor and magnanimity of mind, of the
greatest Lady in Christendom.

Thus leaving her not a little comforted, he went to impart the same to the
Prince, unto whom this news was more welcome, then to have been made Lord of
the greated Kingdom of the world. And taking order with ye King for the day of
their marriage, against which time there should be prepared a great Turny, he
also sent over into England the Duke of York, to certify the King his father
hereof, which was to him most welcome news, being now greatly stricken in
years. Also there were many Heraults sent forth to proclaim this great
Turny, which should beheld in the City of Parris, at the nuptials of the
Prince of England, and the beautiful Emelia: against which time there came
daily, many brave and gallant Knights, from diverse Kingdoms, as well
Christians as Sarasines: for that the King had granted by his proclamations, a
safe conduct for all comers.

Now in this mean time, the Duke of Orleance being thoroughly recovered of his
wounds, which he had received against Don Edward, and finding that with the
loss of his honor, he had likewise lost his love, grew therewith into so great
rage, that he would have slain himself, had it not been for some of his
servants, who always gave dilligent attendance unto him: and devising with
himself on revenge, at last resolved by unknown treachery, to bring it thus to
pass. There was in this his Dukedom a great Inchaunter, who with his accursed
spells, was able in a manner to pull the stars out of their places: to this
man the Duke resorted, and making him privy to his intent, desired him to
devise some means how unknown he might be revenged on the English Prince.
The Inchaunter willing to show his love unto the Duke, immediately devised a
mean, how not only to be revenged on ye prince, but also on as many as were
welwillers unto him: which he did bring to pass in this sort. There was in ye
Kingdom of France, some ten leagues from Parris a great Forest, in which
this Inchaunter by his deuilish art, erected a stately Castle environed about
with high walls, and deep ditches, so as it seemed one of the strongest, and
fairest Castles of the Kingdom: likewise he inchaunted it in such sort, that
though a thousand Knights had sought for it, yet notwithstanding there should
none have found the same, but such as they thought should not be of such force,
as to conquer the gardants, who were two fierce and mighty Giants, far
exceeding the common stature of others of that kind. Also there was a Knight a
kinsman of the Dukes, who being accompanied with 20 or 30 attendants, always
remained herein: the Giants who kept the guard, the one of them was called
Brandofell, with him first must those Knights have to do, that came to make
trial of this adventure, the other was named Furioll, excelling in strength
all the Giants of his time, to him belonged the combat with those Kinghts, to
whom fortune was so favorable, as to overcome Brandofell. In this manner having
provided for the guard of this inchaunted Castle, they devised a mean by which
to bring the Prince unto the same, which was in this manner. The Inchaunter
Ligustargo, for so was he called, had a daughter indifferent fair, who in
dissimulation was as skillful, as her father in the art of Magic, for she had
her tears at command, and could so well frame her countenance to sorrow,
that there was none but would have taken her to be very sorrow it self: to
her was referred the means to seduce the Prince, who coming unto the Court,
with her hair disperssed about her shoulders, her garments rent and torn, and
being conducted into the great Hall, she was admired at of every one, and
greatly pitied, for the outward show of sorrow, which did seem so much to
afflict her: in this manner being conducted where the King, with many Princes
and great Lords were sitting togethers, she demanded which was the English
Prince. Who hearing himself named, immediately stepped forth, demanding what
she would with him: she presently falling on her knees, fetching many
vehement and deep sighs, pouring forth such abundance of tears, as a while
detained the passage of her speech, which caused great pity in all the
beholders, but especially in the Prince, who naturally was very pitiful: at
length having recovered the use of her tongue, with a deep sigh proceeded in
this manner. Most worthy and valerous Prince, if the tears of the most
distressed and wofullest creature in the world, may move pity and compassion,
in your heroyick and noble mind, then let these my complaints have access
unto your virtuous heart, which I have heard reported to be such, that causes
me rather then unto any other of these noble Knights, to make my complaint,
hoping by you to receive some comfort in this my great heaviness, which happened
in this manner. Being sent by the beautiful Duchess Gelnarda, Duchess of
Strauonia unto a friend of hers, whose fame peradventure you have heretofore
heard of, called Segando, who now remains in the Kingdom of Island, in the
company of a beautiful Damsel, clean forgetting both my Lady and her love,
which heretofore to him was esteemed most dear, my Lady having made diverse
trialls for recovering of him, now as her last refuge sent me unto him with a
packet of letters, and a ring which was of such virtue, that he should no
sooner have put the same on his finger, but he should presently be so overcome
with her love, yt he should not be able to rest quiet, until such time as he
were com into her presence. And now having traveled through most part of
Italy, and coming into this Kingdom, not passing ten leagues from this
City, coming through a Forest, I was taken by almighty Giant, to me most
fearful, who after he had taken from me the casket with diverse Jewels that
I had, he returned into a Cave from whence he came: this my Lord is the cause
of my grief, and likewise will be the death of the most gentlest Lady living,
if you, or some other noble Knight take not pity upon us, by slaying that ugly
Giant, whereby I may regaine the ring: here again powered she forth such
abundance of tears, as if her eyes had been a fountain, or lively
velspring, intermedling ye same with so many deep sighs, as would have moved
a flinty heart to compassion: much more then think you did it move the English
Prince, who willing her to be of good comfort, promised her that either he
would work her content, or loose himself in aduenturing the same: for which
with a demure and sad countenance she yielded him hearty thanks. What followed
hereof you shall read in the Chapter following.

CHAP. VIII. How the Prince Don Edward departed from the Court, with the
sorrowful Damsel, and how coming into the Forest, he fought with the Giant
Brandofell, and how he was taken prisoner, for whose mishap there was made
great sorrow in the Court.
THe Prince having promised help and succor, to that vilde counterfeit
Damsel, took order ye next day to depart toward the Forest: in the mean
time, coming up into ye Princess Emelias chamber, and falling into discourse
with her of this his intended iourny, from which she greatly dissuaded him, her
mind foretelling, the great damage which he should sustain thereby: but no
disswations could prevail with him herein, so earnest was he bent to follow
this his cross fortune, appointed to him by destenie: but after long speeches
between them of this and other matters, they fell from talk to dalliance, so
that of a beautiful maiden, the Princess became the fairest woman in all
France, at which time she was conceived of two goodly children, as you shall
read of hereafter. Now let us return to our former purpose: the next day, no
sooner had the Sun rising out of Dame Thetis lodging, mounted himself on his
never resting Chariot, but the valerous Prince being accompaned with the
Damsel, and one Squire only, for more company he would not accept of, armed at
all points saving his Helm, which his Squire carried by reason of the heat:
took his iourny toward the unfortunate Forest. Most part of the day rode
they onwards, the Damsel for the better hiding of her treachery, declared unto
him a large discourse, of the love between the Duchess her Lady and Mistrisse,
and the Knight Sergando, with many his valerous and hauty deeds of arms,
whereof some part the Prince had heard of, which caused him to give the more
credit to the rest. Thus passed they away all that day, till coming unto a
small village, some two leagues distant from the Forest, even about the time,
that Phoebus with his golden beams, was some three degrees descended from ye
Meridian: and because it was too late to combat with the Giant, they determined
for that night to take up their rest, whereby the next day he might not be
altogether wearied with travel, and also to have if occasion served, the
longer time to finish the combat. Thus having taken up their lodgings in a
small cottage, they refreshed themselves with such viands as that Country
village would afford: and after their repast, betaking themselves to their
rest, where the Prince of all the night could scarcely enjoy one slumber, till
toward the morning cloosing his eyes, he slumbred alittle, in which he
thought that he came before a goodly Castle, one of the fairest that ever he
beheld, having but one entrance which was at a small wicket, through which it
seemed unto him, he saw very many enter, but none to return back again, at
which he seemed very much to marvel, and going about to enter, he saw a
mighty Giant coming unto him, the which sight so amazed him, that
foorthwithall he wakened. And blessing himself, called his Squire unto him,
and demanding whether it were day or no, he rose and armed himself: then
taking a small repast, he departed toward the Forest, where he arrived by
the time that the splendant Sun with his glistring beams, began to light
the earth, causing a silver show appear on the face thereof.

Long had he not rode in this Forest, (musing very much what his dream
should mean, sometimes imagining that it foreshewed some great misaduenture to
ensue, then wishing his dream had continued, whereby he might have had some
notice of the end, as well as of the beginning) but the Damsel calling unto
him, told him, that now they were come even unto the place where the Giant had
robbed her, and that she doubted he was not far of. Wherefore calling for his
Helm, and clasping it on, taking his Lance in his hand, behold there appeared
before his sight the same Castle, which in his dream he thought he had
seen: and casting about his head, he saw coming toward him a mighty Giant,
the greatest of stature that ever he beheld, mounted on a Courser aunswerable
to his weight, which caused the Prince at the first almost to be afraid, yet
well considering the usual vnlustinesse of those huge monsters, he took
courage unto him, minding to do his uttermost to win himself immortal fame,
by vanquishing so huge a lump.

The Giant coming near unto him, bid him provide himself for the Combat,
for that without leave he was come so near unto their Castle whereof he was
appointed Gardant. The Prince immediately replied, that seeing he was by
adventure come thither, and being offered ye combat, which he was sure would
breed him immortal fame, he could do no less then accept thereof. The^
setting spurs to their horses, and placing their slaves in their rests, they
met together with such fury, that breaking their Lances into a thousand
shyuers, they met with their bodies likewise together so furiously, that they
tumbled both horse and men to the ground, being both greatly astonished with
their rude encounter: and rising from the ground, they betook them to their
swords, the Giant drawing forth a mighty Semiter, as much as another
reasonable Knight with one hand was able to lift from the ground: and
brandishing the same about his head, began to deliver many mighty blows at his
enemy, which the Prince perceiving, and fearing greatly to endure the same,
not being by force able to withstand the same, avoided them by the quicknes of
his body, causing him to spend his might in vain, and many times did he both
with thrusts and blows endanger his mighty adversary, although his Armor
were of pure steel wellneere a finger thick, which the Giant perceiving, and
therewith growing enraged, he determined with one blow to end the conflict,
and lifting up his Semiter aloft, made offer of a blow, which the Prince
thought to take on his shield, hoping to have given him a wound in one of his
legs in the mean time, as indeed he did, but the Giant having by this means
a full blow at him, lighted upon his shield, cleaving it in two pieces, and
passing farther, entering through both his Helm and coyse of steel, wounded
him in the head, causing him to reele backwards half astonished therewith: but
yet recovering himself before the Giant could deliver another blow, determined
with the skillful Massiue, who being once tossed to his damage, by the horn
of the sturdy Bull, minding no more so to endanger himself with the like,
begins to lie low on the ground, thereby hoping both to avoid his enemies
might, and eake to be ready to take the least advantage when it should be
offered: even so played the valiant Prince, who to his cost having made trial
of his enemies strength, determined no more to hazard himself to the like,
trusted wholly to the quickness of his body, which policy served him to good
use, for thereby he caused the hudge monster, not only to weary out himself,
by his multitude of blows which he bestowed in vain, but also many time had
the means, to give him diverse great wounds, causing his blood to issue out in
such abundant sort, that the green grass was dyed into a vermilion blush, as
being ashamed, that humane men should have so little reason, as to seek the
ruin and overthrow of each other, upon so small occasion.

Thus continued the fight most part of the day, no one knowing to whom victory
would attain, both of them being wounded in many parts of their bodies,
especially the Giant, who by reason of the great effusion of blood, which he
sustained, began to bear his shield low, and even almost breathless, the
Prince being in little better case, was contented to suffer him to take
breath: and leaning awhile on their swords, the Giant told the Prince, that if
he would yield unto him, he would cause him to be used with ye greater lenity,
otherwise, he should expect naught save death. To which the Prince made no
reply, but willing the Giant to defend himself, they renewed their Combat,
which continued awhile with great fierceness on both sides. But at length, the
Giant being ouer-wearied, and fainting for want of blood, began again to give
back, which the prince perceiving, and considering that to be long in
conquering, would be the means that he himself in the end should be
vanquished, took Time by the front, and pursuing the Giant, gave him such a
blow on the Helm, that it caused him to reele: and before he could recover
himself, he gave him another, which caused him to fall to the ground. The
Prince minding to follow his good fortune, stooped to unlace his Helm, whereby
he might have parted his head from his shoulders: but hereof he was hindered
by the mighty Purioll, who coming unto him, willed him to give over the
vanquished, and to defend himself against the force of his arm.

The Prince looking about, and beholding his terrible countenance and gesture,
began greatly to doubt, considering that already he was ouer-wearied with his
former Combat: then calling to mind the words of the Princess Emilia at his
departure, he wisked he had been ruled by her counsel, which if he had
followed, he had not fallen into this unlooked for mischief. And now again
casting of all fear, the Giant being come near unto him, he minded to sell
his life and liberty at as dear a rate at he could, determining if he could,
to prolong the fight as long as he might, hoping in the end to weary out that
Giant, as he had done Brandofell, but hereof he was deceived, by reason that
his wearines, together with his loss of blood, had so taken away the agilitie
and quicknes of his body, that he was not able to avoid the blows so lightly,
but yt the Giant many times met with him, causing the blood to issue forth in
sundry places: and again, his strength was so diminished, that he could not
(if at any time by advantage he happened to strike the Giant) so much as once
pierce his massy Armor. Thus continued they by the space of half an hour, the
Prince ever receiving wound upon wound, until at length, being altogether
wearied with his ouer-long travel, (as having continued in fight from seven
of ye clock in the morning, until five in the afternoon, and having lost
great abundance of blood,) gathered all his forces together, and minding
before he died, to indamage his enemy what he could, struck at the Giant,
which he avoiding, the blow descended to the ground: and the Prince not being
able to recover his might, being so far spent, fell therewith to the ground
also in a trance. Which the Giant beholding, and (contrary to his nature)
pitying his overthrow, considering the great valor which he had seen in
him, went and pulled off his Helm to give him air, and taking him up in his
arms, carried him into the Castle, where he was laid on a good bed, and his
wounds carefully looked unto. For Sir Pestrill, who under the Duke his Cousin
was Commander of the Castle, was a very virtuous Knight, and one who greatly
pitied the Princes captivity: considering what grief would thereby rise, both
to the King, and all the Nobility of France. He also caused the body of the
Giant Brandofell to be brought in and cured: whose wounds though they were many
and great, yet were there none of them mortal. The Damsel seeing things sort
according to her mind, departed away highly contented.

Now return we to the Princes Squyre, who having beheld this unhappy
ouer-throw of his Master, together with his imprisonment, not knowing whether
he were living or dead, fared like a man out of his wits, and ran raging up
and down the Forest, crying and exclaiming against fortune, and the destinies
which had permitted such great inuistice: and at length, the morning being
come, he determined to return unto the City of Parris, where the next day he
arrived, and coming unto the King, before him and all the nobles of the Court,
he recounted his Masters misaduenture, together with all that happened in the
battle with ye two Giants: which bred such a grief and amazedness in all
the hearers, as well you may judge if the like event should hapen. Every one
determining to hazard their lives, or to set him free if he lived, all
concluding it to be an inchauntment, knowing that in that place, there was
never any Castle heard of. But when this news came to the Princess Emilia,
you may well think her grief was not small, for falling presently into a
trance, her Damsells had much to do to recover life in her again: and being
in the end recovered, bursting forth into bitter exclamations, both against
the heavens and powers thereof, thus continued she all that night, sounding
and resounding in the arms of her Ladies and Gentlewomen: the King her father,
and the Queen using all the means they could, by persuasions to comfort her.
Here will we for a while leave them in this general lamentation, for the
loss of the English Prince, every one making provision to go try the same
adventure: and will return to speak, of the Prince Iago of Saxony.

CHAP. IX. How the Prince of Saxony remaining, discontent in his fathers Court
after the departure of Euordanus: departed secretly as a Knight arrant, to
seek adventures.
YOu may remember how discontented the Saxon Prince took the departure of his
supposed brother, the Gentleman of the Forest: who having seen him aboard,
and being again returned unto the Court, began to wax so melancholy, that
he seemed to take delight in nothing, although the Duke his father perceauing
it, and for remedy for the same, devised all the means he could to work his
content, as by proclaming Iusts and tournaments, wherein he heretofore was wont
to receive great content, and other times hunting of the wild Boar, and such
other exercises, still fearing his departure.

But neither this, nor yet the delightful company of the Princess his sister,
whom he entirely loved, could in any sort work him that content, which he was
wont to receive in the company of the Gentleman of the Forest: whose want,
together with the desire of following strange adventures, wherein he hoped to
atchieue immortal renown, by his valiant and heroic deeds, which he
doubted not but so perform, increased in him such an ardent desire to travel.
Whereof many times being denaied by the Duke his Father, at length having
resolved with himself to depart, he called unto him one of his Squires whom
he entirely loved, and on whose secrecy and good service, he more depended
then on any other, and declaring unto him his determination, willed him to
provide for their departure, which should be with all the secrecy that might
be. His Squire, having understood his Masters resolution, departed to
provide for the same, and coming to the harbor, found a ship ready bound for
England: and agreeing with the master thereof for their passage, the next
night conuayed aboard both horse and armor, and such other things as should be
requisite for their iourny: and having informed the Prince hereof, the next
day, the Prince being accompanied only with his Squire, as many times he was
accustomed, departed from the Palace, not suspected of any one, having left in
his chamber window, a letter written to his father, declaring therein the cause
of his departure. Thus walking a foot, they arrived toward evening at the
port where the ship ancored, and coming aboard, having the wind fair, they
set sail, directing their course for Dover, of which harbor the ship was.
Thus being at Sea, and having the wind and weather fair, ye Prince betook
himself to sleep, being with cares ouerwatched, for in three nights before he
had not slept, so earnest was his mind bent on this his iourny: and now being
as he thought in security from being stopped of his purpose, he slept
soundly, till it was toward the morning, when he thought there appeared
before his sight, ye beautifullest Lady that ever he beheld: who coming unto
him, cast herself into his arms, desiring his protection against a fierce and
ugly Giant, who pursued her. The Prince heerewith awaking, began to ponder
with himself, concerning his dream, musing what it might signify, but the
beauty and comely grace of the Lady, stuck so fast in his memory, that by no
means he could put ye same out of his mind: which caused him in the end, to
conclude, that it must needs be some Lady, whom the destinies had ordained
him to love, determined to yield himself prisoner, before the assault should
grow too hot: thus continued this amerous young Prince, entangled in her
beauty whom he never had seen, minding to rest in no place, until such time
as he had found her out, whom in his dream he beheld. By this time had they
continued at Sea by the space of eight days, not meeting with any adventure
worth the memory, having the wind fair, and the Seas so calm as might be,
till on the ninth day coming almost on shore on ye caost of France, they
perceived a ship with sails and ores, as much as they could to make toward
them: which the Master and the rest of the Sailors, presently knew to be a
Pyrat, and calling the Prince unto them, to know what counsel he would give
in this extremity, they all being minded to yield, rather then to fight,
considering the vnequalnesse of the match, and the cruelty the Pirates commonly
used to those, who made resistance. But the Prince not minding to submit
himself into the hands of such villains, gave them counsel not to yield, but
to fight it out to ye last man, and calling for his Armor, immediately armed
himself: swearing them all to perform their best endeavors, for to defend
themselves.

By this time was the Pirate come up with them, and warning them to yield unto
his mercy, the Prince standing aloft upon the deck, with his sword drawn in
his hand, and his shield upon his arm, replied, that they meant to defend
themselves, as not being accustomed with words to be daunted. The Pirat
Geroll hearing this answer, commanded to grapple with the English ship. The
prince at the first incountring with a great lubber, who proffered to leap
aboard their ship, gave him so sound a blow on the sconte, that it caused him
out of the shrowdes to tumble headlong into the Sea, and after him another, and
another: so that in the part of the ship where he was, the fight began to grow
exceeding hot, many of the Pirates soldiers being gotten aboard, but by the
help of his Squire, and the Masters mate, who was a lusty fellow, they
quickly cleared their ship again, and the Prince having received a wound by
one of the Pirates, who was aboard their own ship, not knowing which way to be
revenged, leapt forthwith into their ship, and being enraged, laid on such
blows, that every one thought himself happiest when they were farthest from
him: for by this time there were slain above twenty of the Pirates. Which
Geroll perceiving, and knowing right well that if the Knight were slain, he
should easily vanquish the rest: and hoping to perform it with his own hands,
he came stealing behind him, but the Prince who was ordained to finish greater
matters, perceiving his intent, turned his face toward him, giving him such a
salutation with his sword, that it caused him to bend with one of his knees
even to the deck.

Now began between them two a most cruel Combat, the Pyrat being a strong
and lusty fellow, and one that had foughten many dangerous battles, and also
being aided by those of his party, assaulted the Prince with great fury, and
were as gallantly by him resisted, to their no small prejudice: for within less
then half an hour, he had slain six of them, wounding ye rest very
grievously. And by this time the English Ship, having tackt about, came to the
rescue of the Prince, which so dismayed the Pirates, that being but ten of
them left alive, and they for the most part hurt, as before-said, determined to
entreat for mercy, and falling down upon their knees, besought the Prince
with one voice to save their lives: which he easily yielded unto. And taking
course for the safe custody of the ship, they having with great devotion given
thanks unto almighty GOD for this so happy victory, which they had so luckily
obtained without the loss of any one man, and dressing those that were hurt,
with such salues and other needful things, whereof they found good store
aboard the Pyrat, they directed their course for Dover, where the next day they
safely arrived: where the Prince, at the request of the Owner of the Ship,
stayed by the space of three days, during which time, there arrived many of
the Country people to behold him: for by this time was his fame spread abroad by
the Mariners, to his great renown. And the Lieuetenant that had the
government of that Fort under the King of England, being then returned from
certain affairs which he had to do, entertained him with the greatest honor
that might be. To whom the Prince would not make himself known, but as a
Knight arrant, minding to travel to the Court of the King of England, the fame
whereof had brought him from his native Country.

And now having rested himself by the space of ten days, for the curing of
such wounds as he had received in the former conflict, and seeing the Pirates
executed, according to the Laws of that Realm, determined to depart the next
day toward London, where the King then kept his Court, having remained a long
time in great pensiveness for the loss of his son Prince Edward.

CHAP. X. How Jago coming to the English Court, took in hand the defense of
a Lady falsely accused: and what happened thereof.
THE Prince Iago, having taken his leave of the Governor of Dover, took his
way directly toward London, accompanied only with his Squire, unto whom for
the more pleasant passing of the time, he recounted his dream, in a vision
which he had seen at his coming out of Saxony. Thus past they away their
wearisome journey, till on the fourth day coming within five miles of the
City, they heard one most pitifully weeping: and drawing somewhat near the
same, there being a high bank between them and the voice which they heard,
they stayed awhile to understand the cause of that lamentation. When suddenly
they might hear the weeping cease, and the party to fetch a deep and grievous
sigh, saying: Is it possible, that God will altogether forsake the distressed
innocent, and suffer such great injustice, not raising up any one to help or
succor their rightful cause against so evident a treason: O yt it would
please him to raise up another Daniell, to find out their accursed forgeries,
and to free this his distressed Susanna, or that it would please his almighty
power, to indue me with strength and courage, whereby I might force them to
confess their most wrongful and false accusation, against the most virtuous
Lady living: but alas, I see mine own forces, being a weak and feeble woman,
too too far unable to accomplish the same, and the ears of the Almighty so
stopped against my prayers, that he does not hear the^. But what do I mean,
so much to blaspheme his holy Name, as to say he does not hear, when alas it
is our sins which causes him not to grant what we require: or peradventure
he may defer the same, to the greater setting forth of his glory: that when
all hope is past, even then he may show his omnipotent power by some strange
deliverance. Here again she paused.

And Iago mounting up the bank, perceived that she was a comely young
Gentlewoman, whom he saluted, and being by her again resaluted, he demanded
ye cause of her grief, which by her complaint he imagined to be very great:
assuring her withal, that if the matter were correspondent unto truth, and to
be tried by dint of sword, she had met with one, who would willingly hazard his
life in defense of the innocent. The Damsel hearing his kind proffer, and
withal, viewing the comely proportion of his body, began somewhat to comfort
herself, hoping yt God had sent him of purpose, to defend the just cause of
her distressed Lady, answered him. Most courteous and valiant Knight, for so
much my mind does assure you to be, I render you infinite thanks for this your
kind and willing offer, hoping by the time you have heard my woeful narration,
you will be thoroughly assured of the equity of the cause, which has moved in
me, and many more this sorrow, which even now you found in me, and the unjust
and treacherous dealing, of the most disloiallest Knight that lives. Know then,
that whilst this Court of England enjoyed their most vallerous Prince Don
Edward, who now by the space of eyghteene years has continued imprisoned in an
inchaunted Castle in France, did flourish with many brave and hardy Knights,
amongst whom there was a noble Gentleman, called the Lord Mowbray, a man for
his virtue and valor greatly esteemed of all, but especially beloved by the
Prince, with whom he went into France, where by his valor he won immortal
fame: and after the loss of the Prince, hazarding himself for his
deliverance, was likewise there taken prisoner. This Lord left behind him at
his departure, a son and a daughter, his son being of the age of seven
years, and his daughter called Beleriza, of the age of five years, both under
the custody of their virtuous and noble Mother: who having brought them up in
virtuous and godly living, until they were of ripe years, departed this
world, leaving both her children unto their own governments: Beleriza had
been of long time beloved and sued unto, by a gallant young Knight, named
Francisco, whom she likewise entirely loved, yet minding to prove his
loyalty, entreated him to go into France, to combat with the two Giants,
Brandofell and Furioll, who kept the Inchaunted Castle, where the Prince and
her father, with diverse other famous Knights were imprisoned. Francisco willing
to have so fit occasion, both to pleasure his Lady and Mistrisse, and also to
show forth his valor, which he thought even unmatchable, presently
consented, promising to work wounders, and so fitting himself, departed
toward France. But before his taking ship he wrote unto his Lady, as near
as I can guess, these ensuing verses.

Beleriza Goddess mine,
Whose beauty Venus slaines,
Whose only chaste virtuous mind,
Solely Diana daines.
Thy Majesty not far unmeet,
To stately Jove his Queen:
Thy pregnant wit to Pallas cake,
Full rightly I do deem.
Thou thou, I say, my heart have bound
In chains of servile love:
My heart that erst full free I found,
Inflamde is from above.
Do thou o then vouchsafe my dear,
To ease those fiery flames:
By being constant unto him,
That burn with those same flames.
Then shall my vigor so increase,
And arm grow so strong:
That Brandofell and Furioll both,
On ground I Will lay a long.
And from Inchauntment free I will,
That noble Sire of thine,
Together with our nature Prince,
That there so long has line.
Yours if his own, Don Francisco.

Having written these verses unto his Lady, he departed, what sithence has
happened unto him I do not know, but imagine he has sped as ill as those, who
heretofore have made trial of the same adventure. Now being departed, there
was another gallant, which likewise fell in liking with my Lady Beleriza, one
whom indeed the inheritance of my Lord their father, if they both happened to
die without issue, of right did appertain. This gallant called Signior
Roberto, imagining that my Lord their father, and his kinsman was either dead,
or never to be delivered, devised which way to assure himself of his
possessions: and thinking if he could devise how to obtain my Lady to be his
wife, the matter were in a manner assured, considering that her brother, whose
name was likewise called Roberto, being a man of a valient and hauty mind,
would hazard himself in the adventure of the Inchaunted Castle, wherein he did
not doubt, but that he would be either slain, or taken prisoner, and then of
right it should appertain unto him. And being resolved heereon, he used all
the means he could to obtain her liking. But she having settled her affection,
as is before said, on Don Francisco, made small or no account him: which he
perceauing, turned all his fained love into hatred, devising which way to bring
to pass by treachery, that which he could not hope for by the love of my Lady,
which in the end he thus brought to pass.

Having many times animated his Cousin Don Roberto, to hazard himself for the
delivery of my Lord his father, which the young Gentleman himself, had a great
desire unto, and now having taken the order of Knighthoode, and made
preparation for his iourny into France: and being accompanied the Seaside,
through which he must needs pass, was at unawares set on by a cupple of
villains, and before he could draw his sword, was by them slain: his Squire
flying away, with in less then a mile, met with this graund homicide, his
Masters kinsman, unto whom he recounted the murder of his Master.

Don Roberto hearing this, making as if he had grieved thereat mightily,
raising the Country to apprehend those murderers, the one of them taking a
River, hoping thereby to escape, was drowned therein: the other being taken,
was known to be a servant to the traitor Don Roberto, who coming where he
was, after he had privately talked with him, and instructed him what he should
say, examined him openly, where the villain most falsely avouched, that they
were hired to commit this murder, by my Lady Beleriza, which he no sooner had
confessed, but Don Roberto, fearing least the fear of death should make him in
the end to confess the truth, with his poniard suddenly stabbed him to the
heart. Then posting to the Court, he caused my Lady to be apprehended, accusing
her before the King of the murder of her brother, which alas, was more
grieuious unto her, then the sentence of her own death, which presently by the
King was pronounced against her: if that within twelve months she were not
provided of a Knight, who in combat with Don Roberto, should maintain her
innocence. And now there is not passing ten days to come of the prefixed
time, she good Lady not having any one, who will hazard himself for her
deliverance, although she is greatly pitied of every one: yet so much is the
number of good and hardy Knights in this Kingdom abated, by the occasion of
the Princes loss, that there is scarce any one thought able to match the
traitor in single fight. Lo here most noble Knight, have I as near as I can,
declared unto you the truth: hoping that God will so guide your mind, as to
undertake the defense, of the most virtuous and sorrowful Beleriza.

The Prince Iago, having attentively listened unto her whole discourse, by which
he assured himself of the innocence of the Lady, bad her recomfort herself,
for if at his arrival at the Court, by inquiry he should find the matter to
be as she had declared, he would, if Beleriza would accept of him as her
Champion, hazard his body for her defense, not doubting but to make her accuser
confess his treason against her. Thus taking the Damsel with him, they rode
toward the City, where they arrived a little before night: The next day
having rested himself, and viewed the stateliness of the City, which to him
seemed the goodliest that ever he beheld, he did what he might to inquire, the
truth of the Ladies imprisonment: where by diverse he was informed in the same,
even as the Damsel had declared unto him. Thus having stayed some four or
five days in the City, being continually visited by the Damsel, and now
being thoroughly resolved of the innocence of her Lady, was desirous to see
her, and to know whether she would accept of him as her Champion. And being by
the Damsel conuaied unto the place where she remained imprisoned, he was by
her most kindly welcomed, giving him a thousand thanks for his proffered
kindness, by her not any ways deserved, and admitting him for her Champion,
she said. Noble Knight, I here freely deliver unto you, the defense both of my
life and honor, desiring God no other way to speed you, then according to the
truth and equity of my cause, which he knows best: assuring you farther, that
the death of my brother for which I am accused, is more grieuious unto me, the^
any torment I can endure. It is true replied ye prince, every virtuous wight,
regards more ye loss of their friends, then of themselves, and I believe the
same of you: wherefore I do not doubt, but to your eternal fame, I shall make
manifest your innocence. Thus departed he away, making preparation against the
battle: what happened therein, you shall read in the Chapter following.

CHAP. XI. How the Prince Iago fought with Roberto, and caused him to confess
his treason against Beleriza.
THe day being come in which the beautiful Beleriza. was either to present her
Champion, or suffer death, for the surmised murder of her brother. The King
with diverse of his Nobles, being already placed on their scaffold to behold the
battle: the prisoner was brought fourth attired all in black, having a far
white Laune cast over he head, being accompanied with many beautiful Ladies
of the Court, attired also in mourning apparel, bewailing her misfortune: thus
was she conducted unto a scaffold appointed for her, after her came the
Appelant, mounted on a stately bay courser, all in tauny armor, as sorrowing
for the death of his kinsman. And coming before the King, bending himself in
his Saddle, as doing obedience to his Majesty, spoke as follows. Most dread
Sovereign, I humbly beseech you to cause that detestable murderer, either
presently to bring forth her Champion, if she be of any one provided, whom I
may forthwith, to ye manifestation of her crime overcome, or if she be not
provided, that then according to the law she be forthwith executed.

The King disliking this is presumption, as also greatly affecting Beleriza,
for her fathers sake, said. Signior Roberto, I know not whether ye prisoner be
prepared of a Champion or no, but your presumptious boldness, in going about
to teach me what I have to do, causes me think that your great pride will
soon take a fall, for you might well have stayed your have, until I had
caused the trumpets, according to the use of Arms, to summon the deffendant:
and then if he had not come forth at the third summons, you might boldly have
demanded justice.

Then staying a while, the trumpets were willed to sound to warn the
defendant, who forthwith being mounted on a milk white Steed, his Armor all
green, beset with Couslips of gold, and bearing in his shield in an Azure
field a beautiful Lady, with his word in letters of gold, Vbi nescio:
representing thereby, the Lady whom he saw in his dream. In this manner
entered he the Lists, and trotting with a comely soft pace toward the King,
with his Beauer lifted up, to whom he did reverence, demanding which was the
Knight, who had so falsely accused the sorrowful Lady. The King beholding his
comely grace, and perceauing by his speech that he was a stranger, most
courtiously, showed him Signior Roberto: unto whom Iago spoke as follows.

Sir Knight, I do not a little marvel, how you being a man honorably
descended, could harbor so base and vild a thought, as to accuse this Lady your
kinswoman, of a murder wherein your self seems to be an Actor, otherwise you
would not so suddenly have killed that wicked homicide your servant, but have
suffered him to have lived, and openly to have confessed that, which you in your
conscience did greatly fear he would deny: but I doubt not but God, by my
arm, will manifest that, which by his death you did hope to have concealed.
Roberto raising him self in his stirrups, and raging to be so touched with the
truth, and trusting in his own might and force, replied in this manner.

Foole-hardy Knight, thou shall soon know what thy folly has gained, by
being allured with her looks to hazard thy life in a cause so unjust as this
is which thou do defend, and how far thy false and opprobrious speeches
has incensed my choler against thee, that when as recreant thou shall ask
mercy, in steed thereof thou shall receive cruel death. The King hearing these
proud speeches, commanded the Judges of ye field to take the oaths of both
knights, then the trumpets sounding, warned the^ to prepare to the battle.
Thus being by the Judges placed in the lists, having wind and sun equally
distributed unto them, they set spurs to their horses, and placing their
Lances in their rests, they met together with such fury, that breaking their
staves to their hands, Roberto was thrown from his horse, and the Prince
having likewise lost one of his stirrups, passed on without any great semblance
of moving: and coming to the end of his course, turning about his horse, he
saw Signior Roberto addressing himself for the foot combat: which he no
sooner perceived, but alighting from his horse, and drawing forth his sword,
went to meet him, where between them began a most cruel and doubtful combat,
no man knowing to which party victory was like to ensue, Don Roberto being a
very strong and mighty Knight, laid on blows amain, as trusting in his great
strength, which surely was much, and had he been endued as well with virtue
as valor, he might well have been esteemed for one of the best Knights in
England.

Don Iago, on the other side, being very nimble and quick of body, although
not altogether so strong as his enemy, avoided his blows with very great
skill, many times wounding his adversary, both with thrusts and blows,
himself sometimes receiving wounds likewise: so that the ground was
besprinckled with their blood, which issued out in many places through their
Armor. Thus continued they by the space of one whole hour, never so much as
once taking breath, by which time their Armor was broken in many places,
especially that of the Prince Iago, which being not altogether of the best,
though gallant to the eye, was broken the sooner with his huge blows: although
on the contrary side, Roberto had received more great and dangerous wounds,
through the thrusts which the Prince had made. And now being both breathless,
they rested themselves awhile, viewing each other, and studying which way most
how to indammage his adversary. At length, they having well rested themselves,
they fell to their combat afresh, the Prince Iago seeming more lusty and
quick then at the beginning, began now to follow his adversary with many
mighty blows and sharp thrusts, causing him in a manner, nothing but to
defend himself: and imagining indeed that he was not long able to continue,
very unadvisedly pursued him with blows and thrusts, not having any regard to
defend himself, but to offend his foe. Which Roberto perceiving, gave him so
cruel a blow on ye right side, that pearcing his Armor, which was not of
sufficient force to defend the might of his arm, wounded him to the bone:
which the Prince feeling, and considering that it came by his rash
carelessness, determined to have a greater regard to himself: and following
his fortune with good aduisement, gave Don Roberto to understand, that ye blow
was to him a good school point, so that at length having driven him from place
to place, being no longer able to withstand his force, having lost great
abundance of blood, he fell on his knees, desiring him to save his life, and
he would confess ye whole truth.

The Prince heereunto soon granted, and bringing him before the King, Roberto
confessed, first how he had devised to come unto the inhearitance of the Lord
Mowbray his kinsman, by marrying with his daughter, and afterward being by
her refused, how he had devised this means, as in the former Chapter is
declared. Which when the King with the rest of the Lords there present had
heard, they did not a little marvel hereat: and presently causing the Lady
Beleriza to be fet, and greatly honored, extolling the strange Knight highly,
the King demanded of Beleriza of whence and what he was: to which she
answered that she knew not. Then the King demanded of himself of what
Country he was. And he very courteously answered him, that he was borne in the
Dukedom of Saxony, and having given his mind to travel, was commonly called
the Knight of Fortune: and now happening to arrive to this Country, and coming
to view this Court, the statelines whereof he had many times before heard of,
was by chance given to understand, the wrong which was done unto Beleriza by
her Cousin Don Roberto, and considering that it is the part of all Knights to
defend the innocent, especially Ladies and Gentlewomen, who are not able to
defend themselves, I undertook the same, which by the assistance of ye
Almighty I have accomplished.

The King hearing this his speech, which he uttered with a most comely grace,
greatly commended him in his heart: and giving charge unto his Surgions for the
curing of his wounds, whereof he had great need, he determined to proceed in
judgment against Signior Roberto. But he by this time, through the many
grievous and mortal wounds which he had received, had given up the ghost:
whereby he prevented the King of inflicting the punishment which he worthily
deserved, and which assuredly, if he had lived, he should have suffered. But
now seeing he was already dead, the King commanded him to be buried in the
same place where the battle was fought, causing him to be laid for the honor
of the House, from whence he was descended, in a Tomb of Marble, very
curiously wrought, with this Epitaph written thereon.

Here lies Don Roberto murderer vilde,
a Knight by birth of high dissent,
Who for the hope of gaining this worlds pelf,
his kinsman he most vildly slew,
And for the same a courteous noble Dame
his sister dear he did accuse:
But now at last, Jove pitying her estate,
and lothing cake so vild a deed,
For which the earth did vengeance crave,
as when first murder did befall,
Heaven sent this murdrer vild for to confound,
the Knight of Fortune calde by Fame.
The King being come unto the Court, cause the Lady to be restored unto all
such things, as during her imprisonment had been detained from her, greatly
honoring her for her virtue, which by this her former troubles did more
clearly appear. Also he entertained the Knight of Fortune, with the greatest
courtisie that might be, visiting him continually each day, during the time
that his wounds were curing: Where we will leave him for a while, to declare
what happened unto ye noble Prince Euordanus, whom we left in the Kingdom of
Ireland, going to combat with Adresto.

CHAP. XII. How the Knight of the Lions departing from the Castle of Molenda,
arrived at Dublin, where he fought with Adresto.
THE Knight of the Lions, having awhile remained at the Castle of Molenda, to
rest himself and his company, departed toward Dublin, whereby the good
conduct of his servant Gillimo, having past many woods, Mountains and Bogges,
he arrived ye next day following a little before night at Dublin, and taking up
his lodging in an honest Burgesses house of the Town, was by the owner thereof
well entertained: and making inquiry, was given to understand the great
prowess of Adresto, daily showed on those Knights that came to try themselves
against him, whereof there had been very few who ever had the honor to Combat
with him, such good fortune had he always following him in his Iusts.

Which the Knight of the Lions understanding, and fearing the weariness of his
horse might be to him some loss of honor, determined to rest himself a day
or two, in which he wrote unto hime this letter following.

To the disloyal and false forsworn Knight, Signior Adresto.
MOst false and disloyal Adresto, I cannot a little admire, that thou being a
man of such inestimable valor, as by fame thou art reported to be, can so
far dispense with thy conscience, (as setting at naught all thy forepassed
vows and oaths, made unto the most virtuous, and excellent Princess the
Duchess Lenarda, whom in truth thou art not worthy so much as to serve,) do
notwithstanding all those graces and favors, which she has bestowed upon
thee, most falsely forsake her, and leaving her to bewail thy untruth, do
here sollace thy self in the company of a vilde curtizan. Let me admonish
thee, to give over this thy lewd kind of life, and return to her who
languisheth in thy love, or else if thou will not, I defy thee unto mortal
battle, in which I doubt not but to make thee confess thy disloyalty:
return me thy answer by this bearer, by which I may know thy mind:
farewell.

Thy friend or foe by thy choice, the Knight of the Lions.


This letter being delivered unto Adresto, by Gillimo, put him into an
exceeding chafe at the first, but afterward duly considering the contents
thereof, it something mittigated his chollor, and calling for pen and ink, he
wrote back this answer.

To his unknown foe the Knight of the Lions.
THy proud and arrogant reuilings, wherewith thou beginnest thy letter,
causes me the less to regard thy defiance, which in the end thou pronouncest
against me: considering that such words most commonly proceed from effeminate
persons, who can do nothing but rail, of which number I do think thee to be
one. ^^s for the matter contained in thy letter, touching my unfaithful
dealing with the Duchess Lenarda, my sword and Lance shall answer for me:
and likewise give she to understand, if that to morrow in the morning, then
dare meet me in the Lists, how much thy ouer-weaning folly has desceaued
thee: farewell.

Thy undoubted enemy Don Adresto.


The next day, no sooner had beautiful Aurora, rolling herself out of old Nox
his couch, stepped forth into the view of this world, being raide in her wonted
garments of gray, and as it were half blushing to have remained so long, in
the loutish arms of her late old bed-fellowe, went to welcome her new
Bridge-grome the son, but our two noble Knights being mounted on their
stately Steeds, and armed at all points, entered the Lists: scarce dayning one
to speak to the other. And now having fetched their carere, met together with
such force, that their Lances were broken into a thousand shiuers, the
splinters thereof flying into the air, themselves both passing on without any
motion of moving in their Saddles: and having ended their course, and turning
about their horses, Adresto entreated the Knight of the Lions, to break a
staff or two more, until such time as one of them were dismounted, to which
he willingly agreed: and at ye commandment of Adresto, there was a bundle of
Lances brought, the Knight being willed to choose first.

Then running again, they incountred with such force, that Adresto loosing
both his stirrups, was likewise forced to take hold by his horse mane, the
other being in the same sort driven to take hold, having lost his right
stirrup, and she reins of his bridle, yet passed they both onwards, and
coming to the end of their course, took new Lances, each confessing to
himself, never to have received the like encounter: and then setting their
spurs the third time to their horses, Adresto used these or such like
speeches to him self: Fie, fie, Adresto, what is become of thy former valor,
which wast wont to send every one with whom thou incountredst, to take measure
of his length on the ground: is thy strength grown weaker then it has been,
or does thy conscience accusing thee of disloialtie toward Lenarda, cause thy
force to diminish: no, it is neither, but only the valor of this Knight, with
whom thou do contend. On the otherside, the Knight of the Lions calling to
his mind his beloved Lady the Princess Egisena, said: Dear Lady, see here
thy feeble Knight, as it were mated by this false Adresto, nay, only the fear
of your dislike, is the cause that he has been able to endure against me: but
I beseech you call to mind your former kindnesses, and confirm the same with
your constant assurance, and then I doubt not but to be well able to vanquish
this Knight, whom for his valor I cannot choose but love.

These speeches on both sides were scarce ended, when meeting together, they
brake their staves hard home to their Gauntlets, and meeting with their bodies,
they rushed together in such sort, that their horses had much to do to stand
under them, but were forced to ramble backwards, but at length, having
recovered themselves, the Knights being both wearied with their rough
incou^ters, not minding any more to Just, drew forth their swords, and
preparing themselves to the Combat, the Knight of the Lions was the first that
assailed his adversary: and tutching his horse with his left spur, came close
with Adresto, delivering him such a blow on the shield, that slyeing away a
great part thereof, wounded him a little on the left thygh: which Don Adresto,
soon requited, for coming in with his left side, and making as if he would
have given a thrust at his body, suddenly by the agillity and quickness of his
horse, he was on the other side of him, and delivered a full blow at his head,
taking him so sound a knock, that had it not been for the goodness of his
Armor, he had then ended the battle: but the Armor being of approved
goodness saved his Master from any hurt, although ye weight thereof did half
a stony him, but coming soon to his memory, and raising himself in his
stirrupps, he gave Adresto a mighty blow, which had he not warded with his
shield, had assuredly claue him to the teeth, for notwithstanding, the
goodness of the shield, which was of pure and well tempered steel: he claue
it in the midst, and entering through both Helm and coyfe, wounded him in the
head, to the great astonishment of his senses. Thus continued they a great
while with equal odds, not one knowing which had the a vantage: for although
Adresto had received many wounds, yet the virtue of the King which he wear on
his finger was such, that he lost not one drop of blood: Thus having
continued by the space of two hours, at last the Knight of the Lions, having
given him a mighty blow on the head, which caused him as one in a trance to
reele on his horse, and before such time as he could recover himself, having
delivered another blow between his head and shoulders, caused him to fall
from his horse in a trance, which the Knight of the Lions perceauing,
immediately dismounted, thinking to have taken off his Helm, and to have given
him air, but before he could come unto him, Adresto had recovered his feet,
and taking up his sword, which hung by a small chain fastened unto his arm,
said: Knight of the Lions, I had thought before this time there had not been
any Knight able to match me on horseback, but now I find my self deceived:
wherefore I suppose thou may thank thine Armorer, which has so well fitted
thee, but I doubt not now being on foot, to deal with you some what better.
It is well said, answered the other, and were not my cause more just then
thine, I should greatly fear me of the victory: but considering the wrong
which thou do unto that virtuous Lady Lenarda, it causes me to hope the
best: wherefore once more let me entreat thee to consent to return unto her.
Nay, answered Adresto, I both defy thy intreates, and her love, and therefore
defend thy self. Then again hurred they together more fiercely then at the
first, but not with like advantage, for Adresto before was greatly aided by the
quicknes of his horse: and now being on foot, although he were very quick and
nimble, yet the pain which he sustained by his wounds were a great hinderance
unto him. On the contrary side, the Knight of the Lions, being before on the
back of a horse daily used to travel, was not altogether of the quickest, but
now being on foot, and in his chief prime, not having received any wound,
was far more quick then his adversary, by which means he both saved
himself, and hurt his enemy even at pleasure. And at length, taking Adresto at
advantage, gave him a sound blow on the side of the head, which caused him so
ramble, and before he could recover himself, gave him one or two more, so
that he was forced in a trance to fall to the earth: which the Knight
perceiving, stepped unto him, and before he would give him air, took of his
gauntlet, and then finding the ring, took it from his finger: and unlacing his
Helm, he soon brought him to himself, and perceiving him to offer to rise,
said, Adresto yield thy self, and promise to forsake this wicked kind of
life, and to go into Spain to the Duchess Lenarda, or else thou die.

Adresto being thoroughly come to himself, and hearing the name of Lenardo,
began to call to mind his former love toward her, and in a manner clean
forgetting the Merchants daughter, said. Most noble Knight, I do not only
yield my self unto your mercy, but also willingly will do as you command me,
where I will yield me to the noble Duchess mercy: whom I must needs confess,
greatly to have wronged. The Knight of the Lions immediately taking him up from
the ground, imbrast him in his arms, saying: that if he did as he had
promised, he should do right well, and in so doing, he should find him for
ever an assured friend. For which Adresto gave him infinite thanks, vowing to
him the like.

Now by this time was the Lady Lenardas Squire come unto them, and saluting
Adresto, demanded how he did, Adresto beholding him, immediately knew him, and
embracing him in his arms, demanded how his Lady fared, to whom the Squire
declared, the great sorrow wherein she had remained ever since his departure.
And now having bound up the wounds which he had received in the combat as well
as they could, (for as soon as the King was taken from his finger, his wounds
fell on bleeding) they returned into the City, where they remained by the
space of three weeks, for the curing of his wounds, and providing all things
necessary for their departure. Then taking leave of the fair Damsel whom he
left with child, and the rest of his acquaintance, they departed toward the
City of Waterford, where they were in hope to find the ship in which the
Knight of ye Lions had there arrived, leaving all Dublin sorry for his
departure.

CHAP. XIII. How the Knight of the Lions traveling toward Waterford in the
company of Adresto, was like to have been murdered, by the means of the
Damsel of Dublin, and by what means he was preserved.
THE Knight of the Lions, being accompanied with Adresto, and his Squires, rode
on so far the first day, that they arrived in a small village some 15 leagues
from Dublin where was only one Castle, and some few cottages, in which Castle
there dwelt a Knight yt was some kin unto the Damsel, which was so entirely
beloved of Adresto: and here the Knights minding to rest themselves for that
night, were welcomed and entertained by the Lord of the Castle, called Mack
Gillum, with the greatest show of kindness that might be, the more secretly to
conceal the evil which he intended in his heart, (as it is for the most part
the common use of those Country people, which will not stick to laugh you in
the face, and presently to cut your throat:) even so dealt this Traitor, who
having rece ued into his house as gests these two notable Knights, binding them
welcome with a Judas kiss, and feasting them with all the delica's that the
shortness of the time could afford, yet his enueterate malice toward the
Knight of the Lions, for carrying away Don Adresto from his Cousin, was such,
that notwithstanding all the former courtesies which he showed him, minded in
the end to rob him of his life: which he thought to bring to pass in his sort.

There was under one of the fairest Chambers in the Castle, a dark and deep
vaute, having no way into the same but by a trappe-doore out of the foresaid
Chamber, over which he caused a bed to be made for the Knight, and having
placed two or three villains in the vaute, with charge to murder him, caused
in steed of ropes, nothing but small sticks to be laid under the bed, which
might sustain the weight thereof: so yt the Knight once laying him down
thereon, must of force tumble headlong into the vaut, where the villains being
ready to receive him, should soon have ended his life: had not GOD otherwise
provided for his safety, and appointed him to a farther setting forth of his
glory, and thus it was. His servant Gillimo, whose life he saved, when as he
slew the rest of his company, the night before he rescued Molenda, and of a
thief entertained him to be his servant: he I say, contrary to the common
use of such fellows, who according to the old saying, (Save a thief from the
gallows, and he will be the first that will cut thy throat) having an
especial love and care unto his Master, as thinking that time ill spent,
which was not to his profit or content, and that in doing the same he did God
good service, was always very careful and diligent about him, especially,
where he did any way suspect evil to be meant toward him: but now more the^
at any other time, knowing the wickedness of Mack Gillum, he listened and prided
about, to see if he could perceive them whisper amongst themselves. A little
after supper, coming suddenly into a dark entry, he heard some talking, and
listening a while unto them: one of them said: Well, and my Master and they
above, do their part kindly, in causing the bed to fall, this dagger shall
pierce his heart, far sooner then Adrestos sword could pierce his Armor. Nay
replied another, I will surely give him the first wound, for robbing Valeria of
her Lover. Gillimo hearing this knew presently that it was his Master whom
they meant, wherefore dilligently noting the place, he returned safely into the
room where he left his Master, and finding them ready to go to their
Chamber, he could not conveniently make it known.

Now Mack Gillum having called for lights, willed his wife and two of his
daughters, to accompany Adresto unto his chamber, and he himself would
accompany the Knight of the Lions unto his (where he hoped ere long to be
sufficiently revenged, for the wrong which he had done unto his Cousin.) Thus
having brought him to his chamber, he continued discoursing of many matters,
until he was almost unready, then bidding him good night, he went toward the
door to have gone forth, and coming somewhat near the bed: on a sudden
Gillimo stepped unto him, and before he was ware thereof, took him in his arms,
and by clean force threw him into the midst of the bed: from whence immediately
the sticks breaking, he tumbled headlong into the Vaut, where he was
presently slabde to death by the villains, which he had prepared to have kilde
the Knight of the Lions: so that the saying of the Scripture in him was rightly
fulfilled, he has laid a snare for another, and himself is fallen into the
mischief thereof.

The Knight of the Lions, and the rest of them that were in the chamber, at the
first were greatly astonished heereat: but seeing the sequel, and considering
that it was devised of purpose for to have murdered him, fell on their knees,
and gave thanks unto almighty God, who had delivered him, out of this iminent
danger of death. Then calling for his Armor, he forthwith armed himself, and
giving Gillimo thanks for his good service, willed him to tell by what means
he came to ye knowledge of this treason: to whom Gillimo declared the form
before recited. Then went he up and down the Castle, killing such as he
thought any way culpable in the same: and coming into the chamber where
Adresto was, in the company of the Lady and her daughters, who by this time had
heard of all that which was happened, they came and fell down at his feet
pitifully weeping, beseeching him to have compassion of them, and not to
revenge the fault committed by one, upon them all, assuring him they were not
any way privy to ye which had happened. The Knight, partly through compassion,
which he always bare toward Ladies and Damsells, and partly at the entreaty
of Adresto, whom had he not entirely loved, he should likewise have suspected
to be consenting to this treason, willed them to stand up, and warning them
ever hereafter, for attempting ye like treason against any one, he forgave
them: then taking order for their safety that night, they betook them to their
rests, where they slept soundly until the next day: when taking their leave of
the Lady and her daughters, whom they left busy in burying of the dead bodies,
they departed onwards on their iourny toward Waterford, where within two days
they safely arrived, not having met with any adventure worth the reciting: and
coming to the Harbor, they found the Bark in a readiness, all the company
earnestly expecting his coming. Where we will for a while leave them, looking
for a wind for Spain.

CHAP. XIIII. How the Scottish King sent over into Denmark, under the conduct
of his Cousin the Earl of Douglasse, ten thousand Soldiers, and how the
Archbishop and the other Traitors, joined their forces with him.
YOu may remember how in the former part of this History, that the Archbishop
of Maiance, the Count Hermes, and others of the chief states of Denmark,
disliking the government, whereof themselves were in a manner the chief and
first beginners, had practiced with the Scottish King, for the sending over
forces, promising to deliver the Kingdom of Denmark into his hands, and
farther, to that end had delivered pledges for sure performance thereof.

Now therefore the King of Scots, having mustred up his forces, made choice of
ten thousand of his approved and best men of Arms, and having fitted them
of all things needful for that war, gave them in charge unto his kinsman the
Earl of Douglasse: a man for his valor and courage highly to be commended,
and for his wisdom and policy, to be compared with most in Christendom: as
having great experience, especially in matters of affairs, wherein he had
spent the greatest part of his time, being now about the age of forty eight or
fifty years: unto him did the King deliver this Army, with free commission to
dispose thereof, and of the whole affairs of Denmark. With this Army he
departed toward the Seacoast, accompanied with many brave and hardy Knights
who vollentary went to bear him company, with hope in these wars to gain
same by their valor: and being come to the town of Helfue, they took
shipping, and the wind serving the^, they directed their course toward
Denmark, having before hand sent intelligence of their coming, unto the
traitors to their Country, their confedrats, who likewise upon this news, used
all the diligence they could, for the leauying of their forces to join with
the foreign power: causing Libels, and other means to be wrote, to seduce
others likewise from their loyalty toward their Governors and Country, and to
fall into the same treason with them. Of which sort there were a great many,
who for diverse causes were soon drawn into the same, especially such as by
any means had offended the laws, and feared the penalty thereof: which by
the Governors was severely executed.

Who now upon this rumor and hurliburly, were not a little troubled, and
perceauing such great men to be actors herein, feared a general revolt,
wherefore drawing themselves together into counsel, they devised all the
means they could, to prevent the same: and having sent unto the Arch Bishop
and his accomplices, by fair means to have caused them to lay down their
weapons, and not like madmen as it were to rip their own bowels, which they
must needs do in stirring up this civil contention, which is the greatest
enemy that possible may happen to any commonwealth, and that in calling in
foreign powers, was not only to bring into bondage their Country, and native
soil, but also themselves and their whole posterity: for what Conqueror is
there, that having brought into subjection any Kingdom or Province, will not
cause his own laws and customs to be embraced by the vanquished, which he
cannot well do, except first he not only root out those, whom he thinks may
be any way a hindrance unto his proceedings, then likewise must he place as
Governors and Rulers over his people, such as he shall think readiest to obey
and fulfill his commandments, which can be no other but of his own native
Country: and then how grievous it will be unto you to be commanded by
strangers, do but consider. But peradventure you will say, that the King of
Scots has promised, not only to continue you in your former estates, but also
prefer you to higher dignities, and you will rely upon his royal promise.
Consider we beseech you, how that he, nor no man living whatsoever he be has
any term or assurance of his life in this world, and that though he keep his
promise with you, yet your felicity is of no longer assurance then his life:
but suppose he should live a long time, know you not, that he that by ambition
gains a Crown, no sooner comes to the possessions thereof, but he
presently cutteth down the prope, by which himself did clime thereunto,
fearing by the same likewise to fall as he did rise.

This, or the like exhortation, the Governors at the first used toward the
rebellious Traitors, which could nothing at all move them to give over their
pretended treachery: and then seeing there was no way, but by force to
withstand their fury, knowing also that the Scottish forces were on the coast,
and daily expected to land, they took order forthwith for the leauying of
forces, placing new and great supplies in their garrison Towns, furnishing
them both with munition and vittailes, as well as the shortness of the time
would permit them. And now having gathered togethers thirty thousand soldiers,
the greatest part whereof were men taken from the Plow and Cart, fitter with
the sharp Colter to tear up the ground, then with sword and spear to
encounter with the enemy in the field, and their Leaders most of them as
unskillful as their soldiers, knowing how better to dance a galliard or a
Pauine in a Ladies Chamber, then to marshall a band of men ready to encounter
their enemies: so much had the lack of use of Arms, since the loss of their
King, altered that flourishing kingdom, which in former time did greatly abound
with many stout and hardy Knights, a great number whereof were either dead or
lost in the search of their King. The one half of which Army being given in
charge unto the Lords of Opencade and Londen, marched toward the Archbishop
and his confederates, who with the number of 12 or 14. thousand soldiers,
being on the other side the river of Estate, began to spoil and sack the
Country, putting to sword, all those that made any resistance against them, and
having taken Cargue and Londen, two Towns of great strength, placed therein
garrisons, then marching toward Opencade, they heard of the coming of the
Lords of Opencade and Londen, and fearing to be taken at advantage, they
altered their course toward Rensborge, where the Earl Dowglasse with his
forces was landed, hoping to join with him: which the Lords of Opencade and
Londen understanding, pursued him so eagerly, that being come within sight
almost of the Scots, they set upon their rereward, putting a great number of
them to the sword: and even at the same instant, was the other Army, which
which was led by the Lord Itsenho, and the County of Mildrop, likewise come
in sight, which caused a great fear in the hearts of the Traitors, so that had
it not been for a company of two thousand Scots, which came to their rescue
under the conduct of Sir James Lewrence, Cousin german unto the Earl, they had
been all either slain, or put to flight: but the coming of this succor, so
animated their almost fainting courages, that, where before they were in a
manner ready to turn their backs, they now began to recover their ground that
they had lost, the fight growing very hot and bloody on both sides, there
being slain of the States above a thousand soldiers, and of the Rebels 800.

Longer had the fight continued, but that the Lord Harding, and the Count
Hermes, fearing the coming of the other power, which was hard at hand, caused
the retraite to be sounded, and so with an easy pace marched to the Scottish
Camp, not minding if they could choose, to fight in two or three days, because
of the wearines of his soldiers, who coming newly from Sea, were many of them
distempered. The States likewise, having joined both their Armies, entrenched
themselves: thus lay they by the space of seven days, within view of each
other, daily skyrmishing together, in which the States always had the worst,
through their unskillfulness in martial discipline, where we will for a while
leave them, and return to speak of other matters.

CHAP. XV. How the Prince Iago naming himself the Knight of Fortune, departed
out of England, and arriving in France, travailing through the Forest of
Towers, he delivered a Lady from a mighty Giant.
PRince Iago, having delivered the Lady Beleriza, naming himself the Knight of
Fortune, was greatly honored in the English Court, where at the entreaty of
the King, he stayed by the space of a month, where daily he heard many
strange reports of the Inchaunted Castle in the Kingdom of France, and being
desirous to try the adventure thereof, his Squire giving him to understand that
there was a ship ready bound for the River of Nainse, determined to pass
over therein: wherefore taking his leave of the King and Queen, and others who
had showed him great honor during his abode in England, the Lady Beleriza
having made him many large proffers, for the unspeakable kindness which she
had received at his hands, all which he refused: but because he would not
show himself altogether discurteous, he received a fair Diamond, which he
promised always for her sake to wear upon his finger. And now having provided
all such things as he had need of, and agreeing with the Master of the ship
for his passage, he went aboard, and having the wind fair, they set to Sea in
so happy a time, that within six days, they arrived at a Port called Old-bay,
where going on shore, they directed their course toward ye City of Nanse,
where, he staying awhile to rest himself, he understood that the Queen, with
a great train of Lords and Ladies, were lately arrived at the City of Towels,
whether, because it lay not much out of his way, he determined to travel to
see the fashion of the French Court, which then flourished with noble Dames,
among who^ was the Princess Emilia, and her fair daughter Oliua, whom as
before we have said, was begotten by the famous Prince Edward, her betrothed
husband, the night before he departed toward the enchanted Castle, together
with a goodly son called Hendritio: both which Children, were very carefully
educated by the good King Carolus their grandfather. And being now come unto
the age of sixteen years, the young Hendritio was exercised in riding of
horses, and running at tylt, wherein he showed himself not any way unlike to
the noble Prince his Father, having a great desire to be knighted, whcih by no
means his Grandfather would permit, fearing least he would hazard himself in
that adventure, whereof there had so many failed.

The Princess Oliua in like sort, being of most singular and rare beauty,
could scarce be suffered to be once out of the sight of her Grand mother, who
loved her more then any of her own Children: and being now as we have said, at
the City of Towers, (the Queen partly for her own content, but chiefly for
to delight the Princess Emilia her Daughter, who continually since the loss
of the English Prince, had spent her time in great sorrow, only the comfort
which she had in her children, did a little mittigate the same) did daily use
to ride forth on hunting, into the forest which was even hard adjoining to
the City, in which forest, there was great store of all manner of wild
Beasts. And being the same day that the Knight of Fortune was coming to the
Court, gone forth very early, the Huntsmen had roused a mighty Heart, which
making way before the hounds, caused all the Lords and Ladies to follow after,
and gallopping very swiftly through the Forest, had quickly separated
themselves into many companies, so that with the Queen there was left no more
but the Princess Oliua, and two or three other Ladies, and some three or four
Knights, when suddenly a mighty great Giant, all armed, issued out from the
thickest of the wood, and with a marvelous fierce countenance came toward
them, to the great astonishment of the Queen and the other Ladies, who began
to fly as fast as their horses could carry them. One of the Knights that was
with the Queen, being more hardy then his fellows, stayed to make resistance
whilst the others escaped: but alas, small was the defense which he could make
being unarmed, against so mighty a foe, whose huge Armor he was not able to
pierce, although thereon he brake his Borespeare which he had in his hand all
to shiuers: and drawing out his sword to try if that would do any better,
before he could deliver any stroke there with, was himself cloven to the
middle. And leaving him there, the Giant persued the others, which by this time
had gained a great way before him: and coming into a rough stony way, the
horse whereon ye Princess Oliua rode stumbled and fell to ye ground, not being
able to recover again. Which she perceiving, began to fly on foot, whereby
in short space, the Giant had gained a great deal of ground of her, so that
within less then a quarter of a mile he must needs have overtaken her, had
not the Knight of Fortune, (being as is aforesaid, riding toward the City
Towers) happened to arrive: who at the first seeing a far of one running so
fast, was presently touched with the remembrance of his former vision: and
calling to his Squire, put on his Helmet, and taking his Lance in his hand,
rode toward them, when presently the Lady (being clean wearied and out of
breath) cast herself down before him, not being able to speak a word.

The Knight viewing her singular beauty, knew presently that it was the same
Lady who^ in his fancy he had vowed to serve: wherefore encouraging himself,
thinking that now was the time, if ever, to show himself valerous, being in
her presence, and in her cause, for whose sake he could endure a thousand
deaths, spoke unto her in this manner. Most beautiful Lady, comfort your self,
and fear not this huge lump of flesh which has pursued you, for I doubt not,
but God will so strengthen mine arm, as I shall soon be able to make him
confess his folly, in going about to wrong so heavenly a creature. Then
setting spurs to his horse, he ran against the Giant, who by this time was
come almost unto them, and hitting him full in the midst of the massy shield
which he wore, hanging by a stirrup about his neck, gave him such a blow, that
piercing the same, he caused him to ramble backwards, being hardly able to
stand upon his legs, breaking his Lance all to pieces. Thus having ended his
course, he turned about, and fearing that in fighting on horseback, he might
be in great danger if the Giant should kill his horse, he allighted, and
dressing his Shield on his arm, he drew forth his sword, going boldly to
meet his huge enemy: who having recovered himself of the encounter, likewise
went toward the Knight, with a mighty Semiter in his hand, thinking at the
first blow to have cleft him in two. But he being wary, easily avoided the
same, by shifting his body aside, the Giant having mist his blow, was not able
to recover his Semiter so lightly, (which was entered almost a foot into the
ground) but that the Knight taking the advantage thereof, gave him a sore blow
on the left arm, almost at the shoulder, which piercing his thick Armor cut
him to the bone, the grief whereof was such, that he could not afterward
rule his massy targe so well as otherwise he would, by which means he had
great advantage: for now the Giant being forced to lay on, and only to trust
to his sword both for offense and defense, many times received wound upon
wound: sometimes likewise fastening blows on his adversary, he would cause him
to bend his knees to the ground, renting his Armor where he touched, and
causing the blood to issue out thereof in many places. Thus continued they a
long time, the advantage, if there were any, remaining with the Knight of
Fortune.

By this time had the Princess Oliua recovered herself again, and although
she saw the Knight to have the better side, yet the fear which she had was
such, that she would have fled away she wist not whether, had it not been for
the Knights Squire, who coming unto her, persuaded her with many arguments to
stay and see the end, which he was certain could not be without the death of
the Giant, for that his Lord did continually increase upon him, and whose
valor he knew to be such, that the longer he continued, the more increased
his courage: but put case the Giant should have the victory, yet would it of
force be with such danger to himself, that they needed not to fear his
pursuit. The Princess being something heerewith comforted, was contented to
stay the end, yet not being fully resolved of fear, she entreated the Squire
to help mount her on his Masters horse, which he did, then sitting to behold
the combat, she questioned with him of many matters touching his Master, whom
in her heart she greatly commended, demanding what and of whence he was. To
which his Squire replied, that he was descended of noble blood, but for his
name and Country, he might not disclose to any one, being commanded to the
contrary, only this, he called himself the Knight of Fortune. Then declaring
unto her his first combat at Sea, and the battle with Signior Roberto, when
he delivered the Lady Beleriza: where hearing of the strange reports of the
inchaunted Castle, he determined to make trial thereof, not forgetting to
declare unto her his Masters Vision at Sea, which more then all the rest did
cause her to admire, thinking with her self that it was only by the work of
God: then considering what it was to be loved by such a Knight, whose equal
she never had before seen, began deeply to fancy him. Thus past they away
the time, whiles the two fierce Champions continued their combat, both giving
and receiving many wounds, all the ground being stained with their blood: and
now the Giant being altogether enraged, rebelling and cursing his false Gods,
foming at the mouth like a mad man, ran upon the Knight, thinking to have
taken him in his arms, but he perceauing his intent, and lothing such
imbracements, prevented him by avoiding through the quickness of his body,
delivering withal so sound a blow on his right arm, which he had stretched
forth, that he caused both it and his heavy Semiter to fly into the field,
then persuing his victory, he never left wounding of him, till such time as he
caused him to fall dead to the ground.

And then parting his head from his shoulders, he kneeled down on his knees,
rending thanks to God for the victory: and taking up the head, he went and
presented the same to the Princess, desiring her to accept the same, as the
first show of his love, who had vowed himself wholly to her service. The
Princess dying her cheeks with a moddest blush, giving him hearty thanks for
preserving her life, she entreated him to conduct her to the City, where she
would cause him to be honored according to his desert. The Knight easily
consented heereto, and having bound up this wounds, caused his Squire to place
her behind him, in this sort rode they onwards, the Knight declaring unto her
his love, which he had vowed long before he had seen her, only by his vision
which he had seen, when first he left his own Country. Whilst they were thus
discoursing of love, they perceived a great troop of Knights, coming
galloping toward them, which when they were come near unto them, the
Princess knew them to be the Queens Knights: who being gathered together,
and finding her wanting, were sent to pursue the Giant, and now having found
her so well rescued, they were not a little glad thereof: meruailing greatly
how she had escaped. And demanding of her, were given to understand, the whole
discourse before recited, wherein she did not fail to extol the Knights
valor to the uttermost: but he attributed his victory more to her beauty then
his own valor. Thus rode they on till they came to the City, one of the
Knights carrying the Giants head, to ye great wonder of the whole City, who
highly commended so vallerous a deed. And coming to the Court, they were
received with great joy by the Queen, and the Princess Emilia. who assuredly
esteemed her lost: but when they understood the manner how she was delivered,
they gave God hearty thanks, greatly honoring and commending the Knight of
fortune, feasting and intertaining him with all the kindness that might be,
and being lodged in the Palace, was every day during the cure of his wounds,
visited by the Princess Emilia and her daughter, unto whom many times he
declared his passions: which the Princess perceauing to be extreme, began
something to pity him, which Cupid perceauing, and minding to show his divine
power, wounded her to the heart with one of his impoysoned shafts, whereby she
could never be in quiet but in his presence: which he perceauing, began
far sooner then otherwise he could have done, to recover his strength, so
that within fifteen days he was thoroughly whole, and being able to bear
Armor again, determined to travel toward ye inchaunted Castle, but first he
thought good once more to try the Princess, as you shall hear in the Chapter
following.

CHAP. XVI. How the Knight of Fortune, made himself known to the Princess
Oliua, and having obtained her love, departed toward the Inchaunted Castle,
and how he was there taken prisoner.
THE Knight of Fortune, being thoroughly healed of his wounds which he had
received in fighting with the Giant Latron, when as he delivered the Princess
Oliua, and minding to make trial of the adventure of the inchaunted Castle,
one day finding the Princess sollitarie, walking in the Palace garden, came
unto her, and after salutations past between them, began as follows.

Most excellent and beauteous Princess, if the cruel pains of a faithful
Lover, may any way move compassion in a Ladies heart, or the endless sighs
and tears of a Knight wounded by Cupids shafts, may deserve to be pitied,
then I beseech you Madam to behold him, that not only languisheth, but is even
ready, through the extreme passions which I feel, to suffer death for your
love, being appointed by the Destinies to love you, before ever I had sight of
this your heavenly and divine beauty, since which time it has so increased in
me, that I find no other remedy if you prove cruel, but death only: which
if you should, would be to me most welcome.

The Princess hearing this, which unto her was most pleasant, answered, Knight
of Fortune, what other name to call you by I am utterly ignorant of, the love
which you say you bear unto me, may be great, neither do I think the
contrary, as the hazarding of your self to save my life, I must needs
confess deserves ye greatest recompense that I can bestow on you. But how
far unfitting it is for one of my estate, to place my affection on a
stranger, whose name nor Country I know not, yea peradventure on such a one,
who though now he seems to love, yet having gained what he seeks for, may as
soon leave me: but put case I were so fondly bent, as not looking before I
leapt, should place my affection on you, do you think, that either the King
my Grandfather, or ye rest of my friends would give consent to my choice,
surely I am persuaded they would never yield thereto.

The Knight having attentively listened to her discourse, and withal noting her
change of culler whilst that she was speaking, especially when she seemed to
make doubt of his constancy, replied. Worthy Princess, whose beauty
excels the most fairest, and whose wisdom excels that beauty, my name,
which unto none since I left my own Country I have declared, is Iago, my
native soil the Duchy of Saxony where my aged Father gouerns, not knowing
what is become of me his unhappy son, who for the desire of seeking strange
adventures, stale secretly out of his Court, what since has befalne me, I
think partly by my self, and my Squire you have already heard. But where you
seem to doubt of my loyalty, I beseech God no longer to permit my life, then
unto you I prove faithful: and whereas you likewise doubt your friends
consents, think not but both your Grandfather, yea and the Prince your Father
likewise, who I doubt not ere long to see at liberty, will easily give their
consents, seeing you desirous to accord thereto. The Princess no longer able
to conceal ye love which she bare him, and knowing him to be the Prince of
Saxony, whose forwardness long before by fame had been bruted in the French
Court, together with that of his supposed Brother, the Gentleman of the
Forest, demanded whether it were himself or his Brother, that had achieved
the adventure of the inchaunted Sword. The Knight answered that it was his
supposed brother, whose absence was the chiefest cause of his travel. And
herewithall he declared unto her, the strange finding of Euordanus, together
with the great love and affection between them, as is before declared: at
which discourse the Princess took great delight, and in the end, having fully
resolved with herself, she was contented to take him for her husband. And
having thus vowed each to other faith and loyalty, he took his leave of her
with many a chaste kiss: the next day preparing himself to travel toward the
inchaunted Castle, where within six days after he arrived, reasonable
betimes in the morning. And being come even to the Bridge foot, he was
willed by a Squire to pass no further, then presently came forth the Giant
Brandofell, mounted on a mighty Courser, bearing in his hand a Lance big
enough to have been the Mast of a small ship. Which when the Knight of
Fortune beheld, he greatly admired the same, yet not being any thing afraid,
he set spurs to his horse, addressing his shield, and placing his Lance in
his rest, which he directed right against the Giants breast, who by reason of
his huge stature, bare his Lance so hie, that coming together, he ran the
same clean over his head, not so much as once touching him therewith: but the
Knights Lance hitting in the midst of the Giants shield, brake into a
thousand shiuers, causing the huge tower to bend backwards, but yet keeping his
saddle, they met together so furiously with their bodies, that they were both
horse and men tumbled to the ground, (to the great marvel of the prince Don
Edward and the other Knights, which were standing on the battlements of the
Castle beholding the same, who greatly commended him in their hearts,) then
quickly recovering themselves, they drew forth their swords, and coming
together, they began a most cruel and dangerous combat: the Knight still
fearing his mighty blows, did often void the same by the quickness of his
body: but yet many times received wound upon wound, himself likewise giving
many.

Thus continued they the spare of two hours without any great advantage to be
discerned between them: the Giant at length beginning to be out of breath,
began to give back a little, which the Knight perceiving followed him the
faster, and the Giant still giving back, happened to stumble on a piece of the
Knights Lance, wherewith he fell to the ground: so that before he could
recover himself, he had received two great wounds, the one in his thigh, the
other in his right arm, whereby (being again gotten on his feet) he could
not so well handle his Semiter as before he did, which was soon the occasion
that the Knight of Fortune got the victory, yet very deerly, for having the
Giant at this advantage, he determined to end the Combat quickly, and croching
near, the better to give a full blow at his head, he performed the same with
such force, that he caused him to tumble to the ground, receiving withal so
mighty a blow from the Giant on the right side, that cleaving his shield in
two, he was thereby sore wounded in the shoulder and in his arm.

But even as he was going to be revenged thereof, by cutting of his head, the
Giant Furoll came unto him, and by force taking him in his arms, do what he
could, he carried him into the Castle, where being disarmed, he had his wounds
very carefully looked unto, at the entreaty of the Prince, who greatly liked
him for his valor, which he had showed in the combat with Brandofell. And
being cured of his wounds, was always by the Prince held as a companion, unto
whom he declared the delivery of his daughter from the Giant Latron, and of
the great sorrow which the Princess Emilia endured for his imprisonment. All
which was a great increase of the love and amity beetweene them, whereby they
passed away the time of their imprisonment with ye greater content, which was
not now very long: for God pitying the loss of so many brave and hardy
Knights, sent not long after the imprisonment of the Knight of Fortune, the
Knight of the Lions, and Adresto, as you shall hear hereafter. But first we
will speak of the sorrow of the Court of Saxony, for the sudden departure of
their Prince.

CHAP. XVII. Of the great sorrow that was made by the Duke of Saxony, and the
whole Court, when the Prince was found missing, and how by finding a Letter in
his chamber window, it was known what was become of him.
I Have a long time forgotten to declare unto you, the great sorrow and
grief, which the noble Duke Mauris, the Duchess, and all the rest of the Court
sustained, when the Prince Iago was found missing, which was the next day after
his departure: for the Duke his father finding him wanting the next day,
demanded where he was, as being given to understand yt his Squire Stephano,
only in his company departed toward the Sea side, and that since they were
not returned. Wherefore the Duke caused inquiry to be made for him, and hearing
no certain news thereby, he grew marvelous discontented therewith: and
coming into the Duchess her chamber, he found both her and her daughter in as
great perplexity, not knowing what to conjecture of his absence, and demanding
whether they knew the cause thereof, the Duchess told him that since the
departure of the Gentleman of the Forest, she had never seen her son to
show any content, and being denied often to follow him in seeking strange
adventures, her mind did give her, that he was now departed by stelth, to
follow that which otherwise he could not be permitted to do. The Duke being
almost of the same opinion, began to rent his hair from his head, and to
rage and take on mightily: the Duchess, his daughter, and all the rest that
were present bearing him compapany in his grief, but even as they were in ye
midst of this sorrow: the Prince Iagos Chamberlain came and brought a letter,
which the Prince had left behind him in his chamber window, the contents
whereof follows.

To my Sovereign and loving Father the Duke of Saxony.
MOst high and mighty Prince and loving father, let not I beseech you, this my
sudden and disobedient departure, any way vex or trouble your noble mind, but
consider and judge of the same, not with this your ripe and stayed gravity,
but look into the same with a remembrance of your more young and youthful
years, when by your noble prowess and heroyick deeds of Arms, you caused
all the Regions of Europe, and Asia, to resound with ye echo of your name:
consider I beseech you, what a grief it is to a noble and vallerous mind, to
be kept always in the bounds of his own native Country, yea like a Hawk to
be as it were cubbed up in a mewe, and think withal I beseech you, what the
world does already, and will hereafter say of me, if I should still spend my
days in this easy kind of life: will they not say that I do degenerate from
being son unto so noble a Sire as your self, and that this effeminate
bringing up, under the wings of my mother, and in a Court given altogether
unto pleasure and idleness, will in the end be the only subuertion of this
flourishing estate, when it shall please God to call you hence unto a more happy
and delightful life. Call to mind I beseech you, the flourishing state of the
Roman Empire, and consider how many noble youths rose to honor by sloth and
idleness: nay rather, were not by those means the overthrow of their
families. What think you of Tarquinius Superbus, was not his sloth and
effeminate living in his youth, the cause of his inordinate lust, and his lust
the cause of his ruin. What shall I speak of Nero, Commodus, and diverse
others whom I could recite, that only by effeminate and ill education,
degenerated from their noble predicessors: on the contrary side, look into
Caesar, the Catoes, yea and the Scipioes, who not lying at home, but even in
their childhood as it were, followed the wars to their great and immortal
fame. What shall I say farther, to commend the following of strange and hard
adventures, considering that you already know the same better then I can
discribe: wherefore pardon I beseech you this my departure, which I doubt not
will be prosperous unto me, and to the future benifit of your Country. I have
directed my iourny into England, from thence I intend to travel in search of
my brother, the Gentleman of the Forest, in whose company I doubt not but to
gain honor and renown: thus beseeching the Almighty, to continue your aged
years in peace and happiness, I commit you into his protection.

Your unworthy son, Don Iago.


The Duke having red this Letter, and now by the contents thereof knowing
certainly what was become of his son, was somewhat appeased of his grief,
and departing into his Closet, with more aduisednesse to consider of the
contents thereof, began with reason to debate his sorrow, and having thoroughly
wayed each matter with himself, he could not choose but in his heart highly
commend the noble mind of his son, whom he did not doubt but in time would
prove a famous Prince. Thus by little and little the old Duke recomforted
himself, but the Duchess, and her daughter the Princess Egisena, could not so
soon shake of their sorrow, especially the Princess, who now being destitute
of her Brothers company, and also wanting ye sight of her Lover, whose very
absence was a hell unto her, and whose return she feared would be very long,
by reason of his vow at his departure: which was not to rest in any place,
until he had found out his Parents. Many times would she debate with herself
hereof, somewhiles imagining, that he travailing through so many strange
Countries, might peradventure be won to the love of some more beautiful
Dame: then would she run straight ways to behold herself in her glass, and
with the minds of many women, thinking herself exceeding fair, she would
begin to blame him of inconstancy: then suddenly reproouing herself for
condemning him without true knowledge, she would say, Ah Egisena, unfortunate
wench, how can thou conceive so ill a thought against him whom thou so
dearly love: O that it were lawful for me like a man to go to seek thee
out, whereby to manifest the love I bear thee, but alas I cannot, wherefore I
will only direct my prayers unto almighty GOD to preserve thee.

Thus would she many times under color of lamenting her Brothers absence,
bewail her friend, which together with the grief of the Duchess her mother,
caused the whole Court to remain a long time in heaviness, giving over all
their former pastimes and exercises of pleasure, wherein the Court did very
much abound. Here again will we leave them to speak of other matters.

CHAP. XVIII. How the Knight of the Lions and Adresto, shipping them selves for
Spain, were by force of weather driven on the coast of France, where going on
shore they heard of the Enchanted Castle, and how coming thither, the Knight
of the Lions ended the same.
THe Knight of the Lions and Adresto, having remained a long time at Waterford,
staying for a wind to sail toward Spain, whether the Knight of the Lions
determined to accompany Adresto, to see if he could by ye wise Adriano, learn
any thing touching his parents, whom he as yet knew not: and now having
remained by the space of eight weeks idly in Ireland, the Mariners brought
them news of a North-east wind, wherefore making have, being furnished with
all things needful for their voyage, they went aboard: and having hoised there
sails, they committed themselves to the mercy of the Seas, and the wind
blowing a reasonable good gale, they soon had lost ye sight of the Irish land.
The next day by noone, the Master of the ship, told them that they had gone
very fast, for by sounding he knew himself to be within five leages of an
Island now called Silly: wherefore directing their course somewhat to the
Southward, they sailed on merrily by the space of three days, but on the
fourth day the wind altring and much increasing his force, caused them after
much striving to put themselves with the land, which they found to be a port in
France called Rokestay. Where coming on shore to refresh themselves, they
were given to understand of the adventure of the Inchaunted Castle, wherein so
many brave and hardy Knigts had lost themselves. Which when the Knight of the
Lions heard, and being very desirous to prove the same, he entreated Adresto
to accompany him thither, who being as desirous as himself to win honor,
easily consented: upon condition that himself might have the first trial of
the adventure. And being heereon concluded, they directed their course toward
the Forest, where within ten days after they arrived, and being at length
come to the Castle, in the morning somewhat early, having rested themselves the
night before in a Village on the edge of the Forest: where they were given to
understand, of the great valor of the Knight of Fortune, who some fifteen
days before was taken prisoner, whose loss was greatly bewailed in ye French
Court: the Knights being as I have said come unto the Castle, had not long
stayed, before such time as Brandosell being thoroughly cured of his wounds,
which he had received of the Knight of Fortune, came forth mounted on his
wonted Courser, at whose hugeness both ye Knights did greatly wonder, yet not
being any whit dismaide, Adresto according to their agreement, took the other
part of the field against him, and setting spurs to their horses, they met
together with such fury, that breaking their Lances to pieces, they passed on
half astonished: and having ended their course, Adresto turning his horse drew
forth his sword: but the Giant who never before had fought on horseback, was
going to alight, which Adresto perceauing, called unto him, telling him it was
not the part of a Knight to forsake his horse, as long as he was able to keep
him on his back. Which the Giant hearing, and thinking with himself, that if
fighting on horseback, he should find any disadvantage, he might easily
sley his enemies horse, it caused him drawing his heavy Semiter to use these
speeches. Knight, I was willing to have delayed thy death for a while, which on
foot might have been deferred by thy quickness: but now seeing it is thy own
doings to fight on horseback, blame none but thy self for thy folly. Then
coming both together, the Giant had thought to have delivered a blow upon his
shield, but Adresto being very wary avoided the same by the quick shifting of
his horse, giving the Giant a mighty blow on the right side, which he taking
with his shield, slyced away a great part thereof. Which the Giant perceiving,
wondered at his strength, so likewise did Prince Edward, Don Iago, and many
other hardy Knights, who stood on the battlement of the Castle to behold the
combat, greatly commending the brave managing of Adresto.

But Prince Edward casting his eye on the Knight of the Lions, who was still
sitting on horseback, began to have a marvelous opinion of him, so ye turning
to Iago he said: that if his mind did not misdeeme, that Knight on horseback
was the better of the two, and that if they did both fail in this attempt, it
was in vain for them ever to expect deliverance. Now had Adresto and the
Giant, continued their battle by the space of half an hour on horseback,
both of them having received many wounds, but especially the Giant, who for
want of skill received many more then otherwise he needed to have done: which
caused him to fret and chafe exceedingly. And being minded to delay ye fight
no longer, he raised himself in his stirrups, and delivered a full blow at his
enemies head, who seeing it coming, and being afraid to take the same, he
lightly raind back his horse, so that the Giant missing his mark, was not
able to recover his blow, which lighted so fully on his own horse head, that
he cleft it in two, and therewithal tumbled himself to the ground: but as
great hap was, he freed himself so well in the fall, that before Adresto could
take any advantage against him, he had recovered his feet, which he
perceiving, likewise allighted, and addressing himself, they began a more
fierce combat then that on horseback, the Giant still having the worst, till
at last, Adresto stepping back to avoid a blow which the Giant made at him,
he unluckily stumbled, and withal fell to the ground, receiving in the fall a
great wound on his right thigh, which the Knight of the Lions perceiving, and
fearing the death of his friend, he leapt lightly from his horse, and came to
save him, which was done with such speed, that ye Giant could not execute the
cruelty which otherwise he would, but was forced to turn about to defend
himself from his new adversary: who began to deliver him such blows, as
made the beholders soon judge who should have the victory. For he gave not one
blow in vain, but it did either break in pieces his Armor, or wound his body,
which now through loss of blood began to grow weak. On the contrary side, his
blows which he gave unto the Knight, had not ye force so much as once to
pierce his shield, so impregnable was the strength thereof, which caused the
Giant to curse and blaspheme his Gods, who were not able to deliver him from
one alone Knight. And being in this rage, he thought with one blow to have
finished the battle, wherefore uniting all his forces together, he struck the
Knight such a blow on the shield, that had it been of any other mettell, he had
cleft it in the midst, but to this it did no harm at all, but with that blow
he brake his Semiter, causing the Knight to set one knee to the ground: but
being again recovered, he pursued the Giant with such fierce blows, that
soon he caused him to fall at his feet: which Furioll perceiving, cried unto
him to save his life, but the Knight not seeming to harken unto him, cut off
his head.

The Giant Furioll seeing his companion slain, drew forth a mighty broad
Fauchon, and running at the knight said: Villain, wherefore have thou slain
him that was not able to defend himself, I having likewise cried unto thee to
have spared him, but seeing thou have so cruely dealt with him, I will send thy
soul for a sacrifice unto him. Do thy worst replied the Knight, for I slew
him because I did not fear thee: and if thou look not the better to thy
self, I doubt not but to send thee to bear him company with the dead, whom
living you have been a companion unto in many mischiefs, then hurling together,
they began a cruel combat.

The Knight having borne some two or three of his weitie blows, (which
although by the goodness of his Armor did not wound his body, yet were they of
such force yt they did compel him to bend with his knees to the ground, and
now minding with himself to avoid the same) began to round and trauerse his
ground, often avoiding his enemies force, and indangering his huge body both
with blows and thrusts, which he gave with such good and skillful knowledge,
that the blood issued forth abundantly, to the great joy and admiration of the
English Prince, and the rest of the prisoners, who in a manner hereby were in
assurance of their delivery: wondering in their minds what he might be, that
with such force was able to contend with the Giant Furioll. Thus continued they
fighting by the space of two hours, not so much as once taking breath, whereby
the Knight had the advantage, as being more used to such combats then the
Giant, who now was in a manner clean wearied, and so far out of breath, that
he did nothing but pant and blow, which the Knight perceiving, pursued him the
faster, dealing such blows with the trusty blade of Adriano, that caused his
body to lie open to the keen edge thereof, so that the grass whereon they
fought, was clean covered with his blood, himself not having given any wou^d
to his aduersay, although in many places he had bruised his Armor: and now
being ouercharged with his enemies blows, and growing faint through his great
phlebottomy, fell to the ground in a swound. The Knight thinking to have slain
him, was called unto to hasten unto the wicket, which if he did not make ye
greater speed, would be closed against him, wherefore leaving the Giant
sweltring in his own blood, he ran unto the gate, and finding one closing
the wicket against him, he gave him such a blow that he cleft him to the
breast: and entering in, he began to deal his dole amongst the^ that made any
resistance, which were not many.

Then came unto him the English Prince Don Iago and ye rest, giving him infinite
thanks for his great pains, which he had taken for their delivery: desiring
him to put off his Helm, that they might see his face and know him, who had
so nobly wrought their deliverance. The Knight being loath to deny their
request, especially that of ye Prince Iago, whom he perfitly knew, and of
whose being there he did not a little marvel, whithout any more ceremonies
put of his Helm. But when the whole company beheld his young years and great
beauty, which by his heat was the more augmented, they did greatly admire his
rare prowess: but what man living is able to express the exceeding joy, which
the Prince Iago inioyed when he beheld him: who running presently unto him,
imbrast him in his arms, saying. O brother, how happy am I so enjoy this your
presence in a time so needful: whose absence has been a greater grief unto
me then my tongue can express. The Knight of the Lions being as glad to see
him, used him with the like kindness, demanding by what adventure he came
thither, and how the Duke his father, his Mother, and the Princess his sister
fared, all which was deferred until a more convenient time. Then was he
embraced of the Prince Edward, and the rest, at whose entreaty he pardoned Sir
Pestrell the Dukes Cousin: and for the courtisie which he had showed them,
during their imprisonment, they used him very kindly. Then the Knight of the
Lions commanded Adresto to be sent for, and his wounds to be dressed,
declaring unto the Prince Iago, that it was the same Knight for whom he left
Saxony to go into Ireland to combat with all. Here after they had rested
themselves by the space of five days, having sent word of this fortunate
deliverance, to ye Court of France, they determined altogether to ride
thither, where in three days they arrived with easy iournies, by reason of
the wounds of Adresto. And at their coming forth of the Castle, with a mighty
clap of thunder, the Castle and dead bodies of the Giants were vanished clean
out of sight, to the great astonishment of them all.

And now being as I have said come to the City of Parris, they were royally
welcomed, and entertained by the King, the Queen, the Princess Emilia, Oliua:
and all Nobles of the Court, unto whom the Prince of England, declared the
whole discourse of every particular accedent, touching their imprisonment and
delivery. Which when the King had heard, he made a solemn vow to be revenged
on the Duke of Orleance, and his whole family: but at the entreaty of the
Prince, he pardoned Sir Pestrell, who afterward proved a good and hardy
Knight. Thus passed they away the time in the French Court, by the space of
three weeks, each friend recounting to other their several adventures, and
making preparation for the solemnizing of the marriage between Prince Edward
and the Princess Emilia, in which time Adresto was fully recovered of his
wounds, and being desirous to see his old love the Duchess Lenarda, hastened on
the Knight of the Lions to depart: whereunto he was very willing, by reason of
the desire he had to speak with Adriano.

CHAP. XIX. How the Knight of the Lions, departing from the French Court with
Adresto, landed in Holland, where coming to the Castle of Coruew, he
delivered the King his Father.
ANd now being ready provided to depart, they came both into the great Hall,
where with many ceremonious courtisies, they took their leave of the King, ye
Queen, the Princess Emilia, and Oliua, with all the rest of the Nobles of the
Court. The two Princes, Edward, and Iago, seeing they would needs depart,
accompanied them two days iourny onwards on their way, during which time the
Prince Iago desiring pardon of his brother, for not bearing him company, made
known unto him his love to the Princess Oliua, which by his abode in Court,
he doubted not but to obtain, considering the great love and amity, which was
between him and her father. The Knight of the Lions being well contented
heerewith, desired him at his return, or sending into Saxony, to remember his
duty to the Duke, and Ductches, and his beautiful sister the Princess
Egisena, whom he entirely loved: assuring him that as soon as he could learn
any certainty, of that which he now went to seek for, he would return thither
likewise, which he did not doubt but would hapen very shortly. Then taking
their leave of each other, with many kind imbracements, the Prince Edward most
earnestly entreated him, to see him at his return out of Spain at the English
Court, to which he easily consented. Thus they departed, ye two Princes toward
ye Court, and the Knight of the Lions and Adresto, toward the Seaside, where
their ship remained for them: where being arrived, and setting into Sea, they
sailed merrily by the space of two days, but on the third day the wind
altring, and the Seas growing very foul, they were forced to put to hull: and
being thus tossed to and fro by the wind and Seas, by the space of five days,
they were at last put on shore on the coast of the Duchy of Holland: where
going on shore, and taking their horses and Armor, minding a little to take the
air after their storm at Sea, they rode onwards in a narrow way, fast by a
pleasant groves side, where they heard one very pitifully weeping, and
listening attentively, they might hear these few words pronounced. And is it
possible that God will suffer such cruel and iniust customs to continue, to
the destruction of so many brave and hardy Knights, as have been by this
wicked custom of Coruew destroyed. O false and disloyal Griffory, that
fearing to show thy malice openly, have ordained so vild a custom.

The two Knights hearing this complaint, and imagining thereby yt there was
some cause extraordinary which moved the party so to complain, alighted, and
went into the Grove, where they found a Squire lying on the earth, his face all
blubbred with tears, and demanding him the cause of his sorrow, was given by
him to understand of the custom of Coruew, where not long since the Duke of
Litsenburge his Lord and Master, having bin by the space of 20. years
traveling in search of his sovereign, the noble King Frederick of Denmark,
during which time he had accomplished many great and hardy deeds of Arms, and
now returning home into his own Country, with intent no longer to seek after
ye which was impossible to be found, travailing along by a Castle not passing a
days journey hence, where the Duke of this Country has erected a custom,
that no Knight shall pass that way, but first he shall leave his horse and
Armor behind him, unless he conquer the Gardants, which is a thing
impossible, because of the number: and then he declared the fame as it is more
at large expressed in the first part of this history.

The Knight of the Lions and Adresto hearing of this custom, and greatly
pitying the loss of so many hardy Knights as were there daily imprisoned,
began to grow into a great longing to make trial of the same: wherefore
sending back Gillimo unto the ship for such things as they wanted, and to give
direction to the Mariners, that if with in ten days they did not return,
that then they should direct their course for Spain, whether they would
peradventure travel by Land: and willing Gillimo to follow them with as much
speed as he could, they departed toward Coruew, that night lying at a
Village not passing a league and a half from the Castle. And the next day
early in the morning having heard Divine service, and taking a small repast,
they rode directly toward the Castle. Adresto having desired to make the first
trial of his valor, and now being come unto the place where the Shield hung
at the bridge-foote, Adresto struck the same so hard and rudely with the blunt
end of his Lance, that he caused the whole Valley to resound with the noise
thereof. Presently issued forth one of the Knights gardants, and mounting on
his horse, came unto Adresto demanding what he sought. Entrance answered
Adresto, which if it be denied I will purchase with my sword. Then setting
spurs to their horses, they met together with such fury, that the Knight of
the bridge was sent headlong to the ground: and after him came forth another,
who was likewise sent to bear him company, breaking his neck with the fall,
Adresto never so much as once moving in his saddle: and to be brief, so good
was his hap, that with one spear he dismounted the first five Knights, not
any of them being able to rise from the ground. Then taking choice of a fresh
horse, and a new Lance, for that his old one was remaining broken in the body
of him whom he last dismounted, he went on to the farther end of the Bridge,
where he found two of the other five ready mounted, and vailing their Lances,
they ran together in such sort, that breaking both their Lances on his
shield, it caused him a little to stagger: but he with who^ Adresto met, was
sent to measure his length on ye ground, then encountering with the other
again, he ran his lance clean through his body, himself being a little
wounded on the right side.

Then taking a new Lance, he prepared to run against the other three, but
before he ran, the Knight of the Lions entreated him to give over the Iousts
to him, as being more fresh and lusty: but heereunto Adresto would not in any
sort agree, but desired him to permit him to end the adventure if he could: and
if he did fail therein, then that he would proceed in the same himself. And
heerewithall again he set spurs to his horse, and encountering with them
all three at once, gave him that was on the right side of him such a blow, that
he caused him to fall over his horse tail: but the other two meeting him fully
at one instant, brake their Lances in the midst of his shield, causing both
horse and man to tumble to the ground, but soon had he recovered his feet,
and was again remounted by his Squire, who brought him his own horse, and
presented him with a Lance. Then being mounted, he incountred again with the
other two, who at the second course he likewise sent to bear their fellows
company, himself being sore bruised and wounded in two or three places of the
body, whereby he lost a great deal of blood: and likewise his horse was so
ouerwearied, that he was no longer able to bear his body. Wherefore he
dismounted, minding to have changed his horse, but as he was so doing, he
espied the five Knights with whom he was to deal withal coming toward him
on foot, wherefore drawing forth his sword, and dressing his shield on his
arm, he went against them with a most bold and undaunted courage: and being
come together, was the first that gave the onset, which he performed with such
inestimable prowess, that within less then twenty blows, he had sent one of
them to seek passage of old Caron: the rest perceiving the death of their
fellow, began with more fury to assault him, whereby he was driven to his
trumps, for they were all four stout and hardy Knights. Thus continued the
fight by the space of an hour, many wounds being given on both sides, so that
the ground was all covered with blood: and now Adresto feeling himself
grievously wounded, and his strength through wearisomnesse and loss of blood
to decrease, minding to show courage to the end, united all his forces
together, and determining to end his life with honor, ran fiercely upon
them, giving one of them such a blow on the head, that he cleft him to the
teeth: then turning to another of them who had wounded him behind, gave him
such a discharge, that for ever after he was free from any more such combats,
having both his arms cut off. The other two seeing this, and fearing the like,
would willingly if they could have desisted from the battle: but he pursued
them with so mighty blows, that at length they fell both at his feet, the one
of the^ stark dead, the other crying for mercy, which he obtained.

Then Adresto being very faint, sat down on ye grass, which the Knight of
the Lions perceiving, came toward him to help him, but before he could come
unto him, Adresto was fallen into a swound: wherefore commending him unto their
Squires, he prepared himself against the other five Knights, which by this
time were come even unto him: and at the first encounter, gave one of them so
rude a blow, that cutting away both shoulder and right arm, he caused him to
fall dead to the ground, then turning to another, he took of at one blow his
head.

The other three seeing this, beset him round about, laying at him withal
their force, which was far weak to do him any hurt: so impierceable was his
Armor, which at this time stood him in good steed, for he being sure from
wounding, needed not to take any pains but only in offending, which he did
with such agillity, that in less then half an hour, he had sent them all to
seek passage into another world. Then had he time a little to breath himself,
and also to see Adresto, who by this time, by the careful industry of the
Squires, was come to himself again, and had his wounds bound up, being
somewhat weak and fainty, with his great loss of blood which he sustained.
And now the Knight of the Lions, seeing there was no great doubt of his
recovery, went toward the Castle, to provoke the Gardants, if otherwise they
would not com forth, to the battle.

But even as he was come to the gate, five whose lot was next to fight came
forth, and all at once set on him, but he like a second Hercules, amidst the
eleauen Gyant-like brethren, first received al their blows upon his shield, to
try the strength of their arms, and having once felt the weight of all their
forces, he directed his sword against him, whose blows he thought might do
him the greatest damage: and giving him a full blow beneath the shield, parted
him right in the wast, then laying on amongst them with equal dole, he made
from some their heads, from others their arms and legs to fly into the
field. And now four of them being killed in the place, the other began to fly
as fast as he could toward the wicked, but before he could attain half of
the way, the Knight of the Lions ouertooke him, and gave him so full a blow
upon the head, that he cleft him down to the girdle: to the amazement of the
beholders, who stood upon the battlements of the Castle, almost fearing to go
forth to fight with him, but being urged, both by their oath, and also by the
commandment of their Captain, the nex five went forth, but were in a manner
no sooner issued, but that they sought means to return again, such
incredible fear had they of his weighty blows. But he seeing their intent,
and minding to prevent the same, got lighty between the gate and them: and now
having already slain three of them, and wounded the other two, he began to
fall into consideration with himself, that if he did not take the time, whiles
it presented it self unto him to enter into the Castle, he might when he
would, peradventure be bard of the like opportunity. And considering withal
the goodness of his Armor, and unwillingness of the defendants to come
forth, determined to enter whilst the wicket was open: wherefore stepping a
little to the right hand, he gave one of them so sore a blow on the left
shoulder, that caused him to fall to the ground, and heerewithall he lept
suddenly to the wicket, and got in thereat: which they of the Castle
perceauing, and with all fearing the sequel, be ganne to arm themselves, and
all at once to assault him, some with swords, other with Lances, some others
again betook them to throwing of stones, and diverse engines of iron at him,
where with he was greatly troubled. But seeing no remedy, but either to conquer
or die, he covered himself with his shield, and with his trusty blade in his
hand, he made such way amongst them, that he thought himself surest, that was
farthest off from him: so that within ye space of two hours, he had not left
above six of them living: all which were likewise very sore wounded, and
being utterly void of hope to escape his conquering arm, determined to submit
themselves to his mercy, hoping thereby to save their lives, which otherwise
they could not long preserve. Wherefore falling on their knees, with one voice
they craved mercy, which he soon granted unto them, being as I have many
times before said, naturally inclined to pity. And willing them to stand up,
he demanded what prisoners there were in the Castle, and for what occasion
that custom was there erected: all which one of them at large recounted,
declaring how that the King of Denmark as yet remained there, with diverse
other noble and gallant Knights. Which when the Knight of the Lions heard, he
commanded straight ways to be conducted unto the prison: and likewise that
Adresto should be brought in, and his wounds dressed by the Surgian of the
Castle, which was a man greatly experienced in that science, all which was
presently performed. And one of the Knights running to one of them that was
slain, took from him a bunch of keys, wherewith he opened a little iron
door, and discending down a narrow pair of staiers, they came to a dungion
underground, at the entry whereof was another iron door, which they likewise
opened: then having a torch lighted in their hands, they unchained all the
prisoners, amongst whom they found King Frederick, ye Lord Gwaltero his Cousin:
the Duke of Litsenburge, the Lord of Menew, Sir Henault, and diverse others, to
the number of a hundred, all or most part Knights of Denmark. Many of which
were sore pined away, and almost famished through their extreme grief and
course fare: but the King, the Lord Gwaltero, and Sir Henault, were little or
nothing altered for all their long imprisonment. And now being all brought
forth into the great Hall of the Castle, they with one accord gave hearty
thanks unto the Knight of the Lions, and then falling on their knees, with one
consent they gave praises to almighty God, which being ended: the King with the
noble men came unto the Knight of the Lions, desiring him to declare who he
was, that they were so much bound unto for their deliverance. To which he
answered, that he was commonly called the Knight of the Lions: But as
touching his parents or Country, he knew not, only this he had heard, that
being a child, he was taken up in a Forest, in the Kingdom of Denmark, by
the Duke of Saxony, who since that time had carefully brought him up as his
son. Which when the King had heard he imbrast him in his arms, desiring him
to accompany him into his Kingdom, where he would show himself so thankful
unto him, as he should not think his labor ill bestowed. The Knight being
by the instinct of nature, greatly affected unto the King, soon consented
heereto, although it were far out of his way toward Spain, whether he was
traveling. For which the King gave him hearty thanks, and withal began to
have an inward love toward him: here continued they by the space of eight or
ten days, to refresh their weak bodies, as also for the curing of the
wounds of Adresto, and making preparation for their Armors, whereof they had
great store in the Castle, and some horses: others they got abroad in the
Country near adjoining for their moneys. And now hearing that Grifforie was
gathering his forces to come against them, they departed toward Flaunders,
where hearing of the wars and rebellion in Denmark, they determined unknown
to hasten thither, and naming themselves to be all Knights arrant, met together
by chance: and hearing of these wars were, minded to entertain themselves in
the army of the States. With this determination arrived they at the City of
Gaunt, which was still held by the Danes: and here they remained, to provide
themselves of such things as they needed.

CHAP. XX. How King Frederick, the Knight of the Lions, and the rest of their
company, arrived in the Army of the States, and how the next day they gave
battle unto the Scots, where, by the valor of the King, the Knight of the
Lions, and their company, the States got the victory, and how the King made
himself known.
THe King and the rest of his company, having provided themselves of all things
necessary for their journey, departed from Gaunt toward Denmark, being in
all to the number of an hundred Knights, well furnished and provided for the
war. And marching thus together through Flaunders, and other provinces of
Germany, they arrived within thirty days at Rensberge, where the two Armies
by the space of six days had line encamped one against the other, continually
skirmishing, but neither side daring the one to assault ye other. And now
being here arrived, the King and the rest being disguised for fear of being
known, came unto the States, desiring entertainment, and withal, declared a
long fained circumstance how they had met together: and being all minded to
aid their right and just cause against the Scots and traitors, they were come
together to proffer their services. The States being glad of this succor, and
withal knowing diverse of them, as the Duke of Litsenburge, and others, whom
they received with great joy, and gave entertainment to all the rest, who by
the means of the Duke were placed in command: and entering into counsel, they
determined to send presently unto the Scots to demand battle, which by the
Earl Dowglasse was soon granted: and the next day it was appointed that it
should be tried by a pitched battle who should have the victory.

The morning being come, and both Armies ranged in the field, the States had
divided their forces into three battalions, the first whereof was led by the
Lord Louden, and the County of Mildrope, containing eight thousand, the second
or maine battle, was led by the Duke of Litsenburge, and the Lord of
Opencade, containing twelve thousand, the third and last battalion, containing
nine thousand, was led by the Lord Itzenho, and the Lord of Rensberge. The
King, the Knight of the Lions, with their company, and some others, to the
number of two hundred, would not at all join themselves with any of the
troops, but in a loose manner, would make a trial to break in on ye backs of
their enemies as soon as the battle should begin: each one of the^ for their
better knowledge to their friends, wearing on their Helmes a cross of green
and corronation colored silk: in this sort was ranged the whole battle of
the States.

On the contrary side, the Earl Dowglasse placed his Army in another manner,
making as it were but one maine battle of his whole Army, in the midst
whereof he placed for his own guard five thousand Scots: the rest he intermixed
with the Danes, the greatest part whereof he placed in the forefront of the
battle: his wings consisted most of a light kind of people, which did use to
cast Darts, being armed only with a short sword and target, with which when
they came to join blows, they did great spoil to their enemies.

And now both Armies being thus ranged in battle array, the Drums and
Trumpets sounded, making a most joyful sound, to them whose hearts not daunted
with fear desired to encounter with their enemies: every Captain encouraging
his men to fight valiantly, and to do their best to win the victory. The
chief of the states encouraging their soldiers with the justice of their
cause, as being urged to fight for their freedom and liberty of their
Country. By this time were both Armies come together, the Lord Louden giving
the first charge upon his enemies, brake his Lance valiantly, and drawing out
his sword, being followed by his company, made way through his enemies ranks,
but soon he was stopped from going far: and had it not been, that the Duke
of Litsenbege, and the Lord of Opencade came with fresh succors, they had
been all put to the sword. For the Scots seeing the violent rashness of the
Lord Louden and the Count Mildrope, opened their ranks of purpose, and having
suffered them to enter* enclosed them round about, but now at the coming of
the Duke, the battle began to grow very hot, insomuch that there were many
slain of both sides.

The Scots ever keeping themselves close together, made themselves the
stronger, whereas the States for want of skill and knowledge, suffered their
troops to break their ranks, to their great damage. Which the Earl
Dowglasse perceiving, with some twelve or fourteen thousand entered in amongst
the^, making great slaughter where they went. The Earl this day showing that
his years had not any way taken away the valor which in his former days he
had showed, for it was thought yt this day he slew with his own hands above
threescore Knights.

Now began the Danes to fly, trusting rather to their heels then the defense
of their swords, which the Lord Itzenho, and the Lord Rensberge perceauing,
came in with the rereward, and again renewed the fight, which before was
almost ended, gathering together the disperced troops of the Duke. But alas to
small purpose had this their new onset been, had it not been that the King
with his company of Venturers, having fetched about a great hill, which lay on
the side of the battle, came at the same instant on the back of their
enemies, and withal their might charging them, entered pell mell amongst them,
killing a great many, before such time as they could turn their faces, to
know from whence this mischief came. The King accompanied with the Knight of
the Lions, Adresto, and the Lord Gwaltero, made a plain way for the rest to
follow them, especially the Knight of the Lions, who never struck stroke but
was either the death or dismembring of some Knight. The Lord of Menew, and Sir
Henault, did likewise the part of noble Knights: so as in short space the odds
began to appear on the side of the States, who before were even vanquished.
Which when the Earl Dowglasse saw and grieuing to behold, he with his elected
company came to make head, where he saw most danger, and perceauing that the
Knight of their Lions, was in a manner the whole overthrow of his Army, he
set spurs to his horse, and coming unto him, gave him a great blow on his
Helm, causing him to bend his head forwards. But he soon requited the same,
for lifting up his sword, he gave the Earl such a blow, that had he not
warded the same with his shield, he had ended therewith his life, for
notwithstanding his defense, it caused him to fall from his horse in a trance,
and so was taken prisoner: to the great discouragement of the whole Army, who
presently put themselves to flight, but were so hotly persued, that they were
but few that escaped, but were either slain or taken prisoners. Of men of
name, there was slain of the States the Duke of Litsenburge, the Lord Londen,
and the Count of Mildrope. And of the Scots and traitors, there was slain Sir
James Lewrence the Earls Cousin, the Lord Crecon a Scot, and the Count Hermes,
with some twenty thousand of the Commons. There was taken prisoners the Earl
Dowglasse, the Vicount Barwicke, the Archbishop of Maiance, and the Lord
Harding, which two latter, were the next day executed for their rebellion.

Thus the victory being obtained by the States, they gave thanks to GOD with
public and solemn prayers, then causing the wounded to be cured, they called
a counsel to determine on their affairs, where all the chief of the Army
being assembled, every man commended the great valor of the Venturers, but
especially that of the Knight of the Lions, the green Knight which was
Adresto, and the two tawny Knights, whereof the one was the King, the other the
Lord Gwaltero.

The King now seeing it was not good longer to conceal himself, stood forth
in the midst of the Assembly, and taking of his Helm, discovering his face,
spoke with a reasonable loud voice.

My friends and well-beloved Countrymen, I perceive the long absence of your
King, has worn out in many their natural love and obedience which they ought
to have to their native Country: and also in most of you the knowledge of me,
who by the providence of God, and valor of this noble Knight, (poynting to
the Knight of the Lions) am delivered from a long and grievous imprisonment,
which my Cousin Gwaltero, and many others here present can well witness, and
now am come unto the aid of you my true and loving Subjects. Wherefore it is
my will, that the chief of those conspirators who have raised this rebellion,
be to morrow next (to the example of all others) hanged, drawn and quartered.

The whole Assembly hearing and seeing their King, who for the space of twenty
years they all imagined to be dead, with one voice cried aloude, Long live
King Frederick to rain and rule over us, and withal, ran each striving to
come first to kiss his hands, and welcome him into his kingdom: greatly
desiring to hear the cause of his long absence, which was deferred till some
other more convenient time. This news was presently spread through the whole
Army, to the great joy of all men, which they evidently showed by their shoutes
and bonfires which they made that night. The next day, the King having seen
the execution of the chief Traitors, and pardoning the rest, dismissing all
his Army, saving some few, which he sent to the Towns that were in rebellion,
which presently yielded unto his mercy, he departed toward Maiance, having
still in his company the Knight of the Lions and Adresto, whom he entirely
loved, and to whom he made many large proffers, if they pleased to have stayed
in his kingdom. And being come to Maiance, he was received with the greatest
joy that might be by the Citizens, where he remained by the space of a month,
in the greatest joy that heart could wish: save only the remembrance of his
Queen did something hinder the fulness thereof, which was awhile sweetened with
the delightful company of his unknown son, where I will leave them, and so
conclude the second part of this history.

FINIS.
