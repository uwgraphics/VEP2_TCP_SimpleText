An Echo to the Plea for limited Monarchy, etc. Written and presented to his
Excellency, the Lord General Monck, in January last, and now re-asserted, by
the same Author.
My Lord,
WHen I presented my humble Address to your Excellency, in defense of the
Monarchy of England, Though we had lively hopes, grounded chiefly on the
presumption of your Virtue and prudence, yet had we no certain prospect, That
your Excellency would so generously promote, or could so fortunately effect,
this blessed and wonderful revolution; It has since pleased God to use you as
his glorious Instrument, in redeeming your Country from the Captivity, and
Chaos, of a monstrous Oligarchy; and restoring it to the Beauty and Freedom of
a lawful Government; under our natural, Prince: Wherein, as your Excellency
has the principal merit, the whole Nation the Benefit and Triumph; So have I,
my Lord, this satisfaction, that all my assertions are already verified by such
public evidence, as malice it self cannot contradict.

My first Position was, That the Laws of England, being of Monarchical
constitution, calculated, as it were, to that meridian, would not easily
conform to the manners of Greece; or learn the language of Vtopia; and most
remarkable, indeed, it is, that whereas the whole body of our Law was lately
out of Joint, like one tormented on the Wrack by Tyrants, to extort from him
confessions against himself, and our Apostate Lawyers forced to double their
files of Impudence, that, like goodly Oracles, they might pronounce, as they
were prompted; our Laws are suddenly in frame, our Lawyers have soon recovered
their Mother tougue, and forgotten that beggarly and Gypsy Dialect, which
Committees had taught them; Our Juries are rescued from ye terror of those
Dilemmas, which daily propounded to them ruin, or perjury; our Judges are
confident of their Authority, and fear not, least they murder, whom they
condemn; We are entirely possessed of our birthrights, not the footsteps of
violence remain amongst us, under a Government so dear, and gentle, as if it
were not national but paternall, and our daily amendments are as visible, as
those of young men, after the Crisis of a feavour: surely the difference of our
temper, and complexion, since February last, evinces that the Physic, we took
this spring, was very proper, and kindly.

That Providence had singularly adapted our Government to our Genius, was my
next assertion; For which I alleged, That English men having naturally an
equal sense of honor and freedom, do no less contemn the Mechanic policies
of a republic, then disdain the Insolences of a Tyrant; and that the late
Protectours, (as odious and scandalous, as they were) found entertainment too
good for such usurpers, not upon their own account, but for that their Empire
was in it self, a kind of Bastard Monarchy, and an approach to the legitimate:
Let our public and unaffected Triumphs, the shouts and Echoes, which filled
the Air, at his Majesty's appearance; let our mutual embraces in the streets,
as persons meeting at home, after their long and various exiles; Let the
brightness of innumerable saces, which are now come forth their Dongeons, like
just and happy souls with their renewed and refined Bodies, proclaim the
general resurrection of our State, the re-integration of our being, and
consummation of our worldly bliss, and let it be confessed; that our latter
motions were as voluntary, and natural, as the former were violent, and
Eccentrick.

I Observed, That our ancient policybest agreed with our sober interest. Now
the interest of a people consists in security and prosperity; our security, of
late years, has been no other than theirs, who live in a ruinous house, and an
inffected air, or border upon the Turks and Tartars; What fatal Comets! What
furious changes have we seen! And in how short a time! Wherein the City was
manifestly threatened with sacks, the Country with Massacres, The Nation tossed
like a Tennis-ball, betwixt the mutiny of Soldiers, and spleen of factions;
Beside the danger of foraigne enemies, hovering over us, and gathering like
Clouds, which (as terrible as now they seem,) were the best relief, we could
reasonably then expect: How his Majesty's peaceable return has redeemed and
preserved us, (as in reason, it only could,) none I trust, wants either sense
to discern or religion to acknowledge: We thrived like Bankrouts, or
Prodigals, who having consumed their estates with luxury, seek to repair them
by Projects; our very streets were prisons, and the whole Nation outlawed both
for debt and felony; our trade, (the Nutriment of the body Politic) scarce
yielded us a present subsistence, and that with such a manifest Declination, as
tended to speedy famine: What a Jubilee to our Captivity! What Alms to our
necessity! what omens of future happiness has his Majesty already, brought
us! It appears, indeed, we were sick of the Kings evil, and he has cured us,
merely with his touch.

And whereas our late Empyricks have, (with their wonted arrogance, and an
imposture answerable to their treachery in all that they undertook) long
entertained us in fools Paradise, and fed our credulity with mountainous hopes,
till even bread began to fail us; Fondly surmising, that our wealth and
welfare consisted in the form of a Republic; if our late woeful, and former
happy experiences did not enough confute them; I would examine First, Whether
were likelier to enrich us, that Government, which settled our distractions,
diminished our burdens, confirmed our Charters, and established peace with all
our neighbors, Especially those, with whom we principally hold commerce, or
that, which, to infinite obstractions and discouragements at home, added our
perpetual molestation and Ruin abroad by letters of Mart, the just reward of
our rebellion; Next, Whether (waving projects,) they can reasonably propound to
the Merchant, any solid advantage in a Free State, which may not as well be
admitted in our Monarchy, Where the Prince, (besides his security and
satisfaction to govern a flourishing people,) has an immediate dependence on
our Trade, in the maine of his revenue, and may therefore be presumed to
advance, but never to obstruct it.

My maine Proposition was; That the English Monarchy did eminently include all
the benefits propounded in a Commonwealth, and had the luster of a Diadem with
the substance of a Free state; Neither I suppose has experience herein been
wanting to my reasons; Already have we seen an Election of our Deputies, as
popular, as in the freest of States, (unless perhaps, the Royal party should
complain of Qualifications, for certainly none other ought, or can,) by this
convention has our KING been remitted to his Regal power, with such a
suffrage That being convinced either in the clearness of his title, the
greatness of his merit, or necessity of the Act all concurred, like streams
to the Ocean; Already have we seen his Majesty, (waving his advantage in a more
equal choice, nay suspending the exercise of all his Prerogatives,) confirm,
(or rather constitute) this convention, and make them Arbitratours of his
dearest concernments; we have seen him hitherto, I am sure; as little
interposing in our Laws, or controuling the Parliament, in the debate of his
interests, as if he had no negative, and were indeed, that Cipher or chief
Magistrate, which some have insolently designed him; If by consenting, he wound
us not through his own side, There is little fear, that he will prejudice us
by Refusal.

Nor does, or ever, I suppose will the upper House obstruct the Passage of any
Bill, which may innocently tend to the setlement or enlargement of our
Liberties. But remembering by whose Writ they were summoned, and withal whose
safety they consult as just and wise Mediators, study to reconcile the service
of the King with the good of the People, on both of which their own wellbeing
seems equally to depend, for that they are subjects, as well as, Peers. This
doubtless is the happy temperament, which will with Gods blessing intercept
discord, and prolong our Peace; their Lordships, serving as a Rampart to the
Nation against Arbitrary Power, as a skreene to his Majesty against popular
encroachments: Wherein the History of former Errors has furnished them with
such future cautions, as they cannot, methinks again miscarry without supine
default: However we are already (by the restitution of Monarchy, and Peerage,)
abundantly secured from those Precipitated Counsels, and abortive Votes, which
rendered all our policy fantastic, whilst, being Governed at random, we were
only shuffled from one Anarchy to another. And what the wisdom of many ages
had maturely collected, could in one morning, be dissipated with the breath of
Factious and Capricious Juntos, who were indeed, too dextrous in demolishing,
but knew not how to build.

The settlement of the Militia in the ancient way of Trained Bands, under
Lords, and Deputy Lieutenants, men of Interest in their Countries, and without
other dependence on his Majesty than their Allegiance, how does it proclaim the
innocence of the Kings intentions? How does it vindicate the present Authority,
as the gentlest and happiest in the world, which after such accumulation of
indignities committs it self (as it were) to popular Protection, and demands no
greater security, than it affords the meanest! How does the equal distribution
of his favor, and prudent choice of his servants, considering the number and
variety of pretenses, and comparing it with the partiality of late usurpers, at
once stop the Mouth of Calumny and vest in his Majesty, a peculiar Right to be
the sole Judge of Merit! Those, who professing to tie him up to rigor of Law,
grudged him the exercise of his Clemency, how are they ensnared and confounded
in their pretenses; whilst, from the verdicts of enraged Juries, and pursuites
of deserved Vengeance, they resort for shelter, to that sanctuary, which they
so lately, and spitefully profaned.

His Majesty's frugality, (whose example promises even a reformation of our
manners, as it has already confuted their envious presages, who for want of
greater Objections, made use of a scare crow, by suggesting to us (forsooth)
the ruinous pomp and expense of a Court; so I hope, it may give us occasion to
consider, how chargeable it is to maintain usurpers, and factions, in
comparison of a lawful Prince; Even as Wives are commonly cheaper than
Concubines; Neither would his Majesty, I presume, complain, or require our aid
upon any Ordinary account; But alas, we may not in reason look for miracles at
his hand, nor in Justice, expect that he should pay our debts: For who does not
see, That in all public engagements, (but especially the present,) we our
selves are Principalls, and the King our surety; he certainly had no part in
contracting them, unless perhaps, the Phanaticks have taught us to make use of
our own wrong, by charging him with the Occasion, because indeed, they were
contracted to drive and keep him out: Would he have taken advantage of legal
forfeitures and late examles, Haberdashers Hall and Drury House might both have
satisfied the Public debts, and filled his Coffers; If submitting his
interests to our wishes, he have no retume, his Clemency is not well requited,
and it will behoove us to want it no more: However, not the proudest Champion
of freedom, or foulest detractour of Prerogative can deny, That his Majesty
has been truly tender of our concernments, modest in his demands; And his
beginnings will at least appear very favorable to our Purse-strings, when we
remember, how they were lately worn out with handling.

The Great Charter, and Petition of Right, which were even buried in their own
dust, (being supplanted by instruments, and Projects of Government, framed to
the passion or humor of Intruders,) are now revived and celebrated as a kind
of civil Decalogue for his Majesty's practice. Liberty and Freehold, then
which nothing has been rendered cheaper are already so sacred; That in stead of
detaining, or seizing our persons upon bare and general surmises, the m^st
obnoxious are permitted to find bail; or if the fact be not too notorious,
upon examination, without further suit discharged; And in liew of prejudicate
Committees, we have impartial Juries to decide our property: We have done, I
hope, will that reason of state, which was wont to fill all our prisons,
without an impeachment, and professed the punishing of men for their supposed
principles, without any thing prooved or alleged against them. Our Laws which
like porters or mean Solicitours, were employed and sent on Errands, by every
faction, are now grown stately, and will not step aside, for any man's
business, but their own; nor is any for presumed Guilt, so proscribed, as to
forfeit the Interest of his Country, without contempt recorded, since by being
offenders, we cease not to be English men, And for that the Public is more
concerned in the lawfullness then greatness of punishments. We have learned,
God be thanked, like freemen and our Fathers Children, again to challenge our
Birthrights, and think our selves no longer tenants at will of our Estates; Nay
Justice is now the least of our demands, it is favor and bounty which we
pretend to.

The Legislative and Ministerial power are, I suppose, sufficiently severed,
or if they be not, his Majesty I am sure is not in fault, who referring all
things to the determination of the Law, without assuming any cognizance of
private Interests, contents himself religiously to provide, That our Courts of
Justice be filled with Persons of the greatest honor and ability, and nothing
decided by unsworne Jvdges; Nor does he interrupt any legal, or countenance
any Illegal course, or to any public Act, to distinguish his Government from
the exactest of Commonwealths; The Nation (once so happily united,) is now
Alas distributed into several tribes, with names and marks of enmity, and
reproach; And though such distinctions are too apt to create a Partiallity in
the administration of Justice, (as, to our sorrow, we have lately felt,) yet
since our princes return, none, I am confident, will affirm, that his judgment
or private Character has prejudiced his right, which his Majesty holds himself
oblidged, indifferently to extend to all, even as the wisdom of God
communicates his daily providence, and Bounties: hitherto tend those pious,
and candid purposes and endeavors to abolish (if possible) even the mention of
late miscariages, so frequently declared so solemnly recommended to us; A
fingular Omen of our future satisfaction, For, what soundness of health may
we hereafter expect, who are already in so good a temper? And why should we
not, with Gods blessing upon such hopeful overtures of his Majesty's
Government. Promise our selves all the beauties of spotless Justice, All the
comforts of flowing equity, All the influences of a benign Constelation?

Neither need we doubt but that our prince will readily complie with our
requests in whatsoever can modestly be desired of him, either to prevent any
just fear, or supply any real defect being thereunto incited by his goodness,
his promise, and indeed his Interest: so as, for ought I see, such as are yet
dissatisfied, will find more trouble, in consulting the wantonness of their
Appetites, then obtaining what they fancy; wherein, no difficulty can arise,
but this, That his Majesty may perhaps, think it more fit and just, to gratify
the sobriety of the Major part, in maintaining, then the Curiosity of a few, in
altering our ancient, and approved establishments; And thus, I fear, he will
have frequent occasion to advise; being importuned by factious, and
unreasonable addresses.

It appears my Lord, I hope to your excellency, How notably you have merrited
of your Country, by one loyal and memorable expedition which with success,
equal to its desert, has at once translated us from Egypt to Canaan, without
any Wilderness in our way; has redressed all our complaints, and answered all
our temporal expectations; wherein as men indeed we are fully satisfied, but
as Christians there yet remains something so considerable to us, that neither
our blessing nor your Triumph is complete without it: See my Lord, how Christ's
Vineyard lies yet uncultivated and unfenced, The Church of England, I mean,
once so amiable and glorious, now so despicable and forlorn, her Alters
poluted, her Temples profaned, her truth confounded, her priesthood vilified,
her possession alienated, and her bread given to the dogs: Your Excellency is
sommoned to assist in the reparation of this fatal breach, in the restoration
of this goodly fabric, both piety and charity requires it: The end is
Excellent, and the work methinks, not difficult; she has already the Law for
her Warrant, the King for her advocate the Nation for her Witness, and no
adversary, but devout sacrilege without any coulor of title but the same
violence, which excluded Monarchy, peerage, and common right: on your generous
Resolutions, My Lord, it depends with that courage of yours, which so lately
asserted the freedom of our Parliaments, now to secure, and if need be, so
rescue his Majesty from there insolence whose requests are menaces whose very
loyalty is seditious, and who appealing still to their own Passions will
neither be tied by the duty, nor tried by there Country; In a word who are
only modest and just when they are weak with whose virtues we are not now to
be aquainted.

My Lord, If proceeding in your great atchivements, your Excellency shall for
the future prove an Equal Champion of the Kings Authority, the Peoples
liberty, and consequently, the Churches Rights (for I take it, it is now
manifested, that they all hold by one title your name will be great in our
stories, and Precious in our memories, your Garlands will every year bud with
fresh flowers and the love and honor of your Country will if Possible) exceed
the Rewards conferred on you by his Majesty.
