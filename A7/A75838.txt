An Epistle written in the movings of Gods holy Spirit unto the Elect People of
God every where.
DEar Friends, Brethren and Sisters of the birth of the morning of the day
which is sprung from on high, which has visited us; unto you all is the
breathing of my Fathers love through my vessel; and in the tenderness of my
heart, and moving of the spirit of life do I dearly salute every one of you,
having you all fresh in my mind before the Lord, wishing well unto you all, as
my own soul, and desiring of the Lo^d that ye may never want the enjoyment of
his life and love, which at this time I am filled withal toward you, and
which I feel is still in sto^e for y^u and all that are not yet brought home,
my soul travelleth for them and you, that all may be brought into the rest, and
also continue in it, for great shakings of heart may still be to come, to try
every birth, that that which is born of God may only stand and be approved in
his sight, and all false births will fail and fall before the Lord, and will
not stand in the day of trial, though it may make a great show for a time, and
boast it self in its many sufferings, and conquests, and glory over others,
with its many words and great show, yet it will come short of the blessing, and
the inheritance of God is not for it: therefore dear friends, I warn you all in
Gods fear and holy awe, that ye watch diligently over your own hearts, that
such a birth be not found amongst you, for that is it will betray the just for
something of this world therefore beware of it, for it seeks it self and its
own honor, and not the good of all, nor Gods glory; by this ye shall know it,
it breathes downwards, and will say, save thy self; but the pure holy gentle
Seed and birth of the holy God, its cry is unto him, and its eye is toward
him, and it says, shall I not drink the cup which my heavenly Father gives
me? and shall I not follow the Lamb through the great tribulation, and lie down
in the will of the heavenly Father, and be content in all conditions, and it
murmures not at any trial, but cheerfully and joyfully passes through all,
rejoicing that it is found worthy to bear his testimony, and that it has a
cross to bear, though it meet with a Crown of thorns, from the world, and
spittings and mockings from the men thereof; yet the present enjoyment of its
God, in the midst of them makes up all, and constrains it to say (in the
strength of his love) all these things is but little; in comparison of what
thou art to me, how can I answer thy love, oh my God! so it wearies not in its
journey, nor faints not by the way, because the Lord is its portion, and the
place of of its rest; oh dear friends feel this birth in your hearts which
breathes upwards, and seeks those things which are above, and is not entangled
with the things of this world, with the cares of it, and fears of it, but casts
its cares upon God, and believes beyond all, and its faith removes the
mountains, and it has the evidence thereof in its self, and is of Abraham, For
it staggers not concerning the promise, though Sarahs womb be dry, this is the
birth that my life travelleth for, and that which my God will stand by, and
deliver out of all its afflictions, and will raise it up in the brightness of
his arisings and glory of his appearance, and blessed and happy are they that
has part in this first resurrection, for over them the second death shall have
no power, and they shall be reckoned in the number of Gods elect, which cannot
be deceived, and they are builded on that rock which the gate^ of hell cannot
prevail against, but all others shall beshatter'd and scattered, the mouth of
the Lord has spoken it, and it must shortly come to pass, therefore be
awakened, oh every one of ye who profess the name of the Lord, and put on your
beautiful garments (which is the covering of Gods holy pure spirit) and meet
the Bridegroom; prepare, prepare to meet him, for in power and great glory is
he come, and coming, and every eye shall see him, but the slumbering spirit
shall be shut out; but the bride that is prepared for her husband shall enter;
for now is the Kingdom of Heaven like unto ten Virgins, therefore it is in my
heart, from the mighty God, to warn all to watch and be diligent, that none
lose their Crown, and miss of their rest after so long a travel; for surely
my cry is, Lord save thy people, that none of them perish in the wilderness,
but that Iosuah's spirit may be found amongst them, that all may pass the
River Jordan; even So be it, Amen, says your Brother in the tribulation,
kingdom, and Patience of our Lord Jesus Christ.
