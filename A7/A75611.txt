THE ARRAIGNMENT Of the DEVIL, for stealing away PRESIDENT BRADSHAW.
To the Tune of, Well-a-day, well-a-day,
IF you will hear news that is ill,
Gentlemen, Gentlemen,
Against the Devil: I will
be the Relator.
Arraigned he must be,
For that feloniously,
'thout due solemnity,
he took a Traitor.
2
John Bradshaw was his name,
how it stinks, how it stinks,
Who Will make with blacker fame,
Pilate unknown.
This worse than worst of things
Condemned the best of kings,
And what more guilt yet brings,
knew 'twas his own.
3
Virtue in Charles did seem,
eagerly, eagerly,
And villainy in him
to vye for glory;
Majesty so complete,
And impudence so great
Till that time never met.
But to my Story.
4
Accusers there will be
bitter ones, bitter ones,
More than one, two, or three,
all full of spite.
Hangman, and Tree so tall,
Bridge, Tower, and City-wall,
Kite and Crow, which were all
robbed of their right.
5
But Judges none are fit,
shame it is, shame it is,
That twice seven years did sit
to give hemp-stringdome;
The fiend they would befriend,
That he might in the end
To them like favor lend
in his own Kingdom.
6
Swordmen it must be you,
boldly to it, boldly to it,
Must give the Devil his due,
do it not faintly;
But as you raised by spell
Last Parliament from Hell,
And it again did quell
omnipotently.
7
The charge they wisely frame
(on with it, on with it)
In that yet unknown name
of supreme power.
Which six weeks hence by vote
Shall be, or it shall not,
When Monk's to London got
In a good hour.
8
But twelve good men and true,
Caveliers, Caveliers,
He excepts against you,
Justice he fears.
From Bar and Pulpit he
Craves such as do for fee
Serve all turns: for he will be
Tried by his Peers.
9
Satan, you are guilty found
by your Peers, by your Peers,
And must die above ground,
Look for no pity.
Some of our Ministry,
Whose Spir'ts with yours comply,
As Owen, Caryl, Nigh,
For death shall fit 'ee
10
Dread Judges; mine own limb
I but took, I but took.
I was forced without him
to use a Crutch.
Some of the Robe can tell
How to supply full well
His place here but in hell
I had none such.
11
Devil, you are an Ass,
Plain it is, plain it is,
And weakly plead the case;
Your wits are lost.
Some Lawyers will out-do't,
When shortly they come to it,
Your craft, our gold to boot,
They have engrossed
12
Should all men take their right,
Well-a-day, well-a-day,
We were in a sad plight,
Of The Holy Party.
Such practice has a scent
Of Kingly government;
Against it we are bent,
Out of home-Char'ty.
13
But if I die, who am
King of Hell, King of Hell,
You will not quench its flame,
But find it worse;
Confused Anarchy
Will a new torment be;
Never did these Kingdoms three
Feel such a curse.
14
To our promotion Sir,
there as here, there as here,
Through some confused stir
does the high Road lie.
In hell we need not fear
Nor King, nor Cavalier,
Who then shall dominere
But we the Godly.
15
Truth then, Sirs, which of old
Was my shame, was my shame,
shall now to yours be told,
You caused his death.
The House being broken by
Your selves (there is Burglary)
Wrath enterr'd forcibly,
And stopped his breath.
16
Sir, as our President
taught by you, taught by you,
Against the King away went,
most strange and new:
Charging him with the guilt
Of all the blood we spilt,
With swords up to the hilt,
so we will serve you.
17
For mercy then I call,
Good my Lords, good my Lords,
And Traitors I Will leave all
duly to end it.
Sir, Sir, it is frivolous,
As well for you as us,
To beg for mercy thus,
Our crimes transcend it.
18
You must die out of hand,
Satanas, Satanas,
This our Decree shall stand,
without control,
And we for you will pray,
Because the Scriptures say,
When some men curse you, they
curse their own soul.
19
The Fiend to Tiburn's gone,
There to die, there to die,
Black is the North anon,
great storms will be:
Therefore together now
I leave him and the Gallow:
So Newes-man take 'em thou,
Soon they will take thee.
Finis, Fustis, Funis.
