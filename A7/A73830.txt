A Pleasant new Ditty called the new, So Ho.
To a pleasant new Tune.


COme let our sports with our songs be renownd,
unto the ample fields:
Our cups in the blood of Neptune be drowned
That merry Nectar yields,
Graced be the Sun, as he
Salutes the modest Morn,
when he leaves the earth below:
And the grace to the stars in chase,
That with him were borne,
To a new so ho, so ho.
Health to the Muse and the Queens of the Fountains.
that our delights befriend:
Fortune to pan, and the Nimphs of the Mountains,
that our Flocks defend
Life and blood to the Cipresse wood,
That was a hunter young:
when he first in Groves did grow.
And a shower, to the Purple Flower,
That from Adonis sprung,
When he sight his last so ho, so ho.
If that the Lord of Olympus had ever
hunting truly known,
Jove in the Bed of his Mistress had never
injury done unto none,
Tryton old, to the foiled mould,
Would the wanton Dolphin strain,
and the toil soon did forgo:
And the said old timelesse God,
Recall past hours again,
To a new so ho, so ho.
Often would it cost jolly Hermis a journey
to run over the race:
Mars in his course would as well in a iurney
win Zepharies grace:
Smiles of Lampse with horses houes:
Shodde with a golden Pen,
would amaze the earth below:
And the Boy, does often joy,
To shake his nimble heels,
To a new so ho, so ho,
Man to himself, like a woman delighted,
is to himself a foe:
Gold he that loves, with the shade shall be frighted
and out of wealth drinks woe,
He that pleasure loves with measure,
Lives with a friend combind,
and effects no glistring show:
He drinks in the Horns Unicorns,
And daily feasts his mind.
To a new so ho, so ho.
Slaves to the World, shall be washed with the Billows,
of eternal Care:
Servile to Love shall be crowned with the willowes,
of deceitful fears,
Tunes his mones to dumpish Drones,
And ielous life consumed,
in the song and sighs of woe:
While away, we spend the day,
With a lusty Paean tune:
To a new so ho, so ho.
The second part.
To the same tune.




HEroes beloved kind Leander,
had his delight been woods,
Then should his life have felt no danger,
in Helespontus floods
Didoes heart by Cupids dart
Had not burned so with fire,
as lovers use to do:
Woeful Queen hat still was seen
Consuming with desire,
To a new so ho, so ho.
Oh then what Angels were fare women,
if Angels could not buy them,
Their beauties that he both bright and golden,
draws too many nigh them,
Feigned cries shows in their eyes,
Like April springing showers,
that fancy weeds might grow,
Foolish then we love sieke men,
That have no seeing powers,
To leave their new so ho, etc.
Youth if it was with age advised,
women wear no woes to men,
The world then Divine and purely prized,
would be Paradise again,
Bewties book if we ore look,
The leaves we shall find torn.
and the mergent filled with woe,
Youths delight so fair and bright
A moments time has worn,
To a new so ho, so ho.
All our desters are fading pleasuers,
and but minutes of content,
Resting with us lik wasting treasures,
no sooner gaind but spent,
Years of sorrow, we still borrow,
But for one minets joy,
returnign tribble woe:
Delightful bubles, change to troubles
To feed us with annoy,
To a new so ho, so ho.
Man by his shape is the stamp of heaven
plast on the earth as King,
The world unto him for a Court is given
to rule each living thing.
Bewties blazing to our gazing.
That sweet beloved tree,
Where saving follies grow,
A winding sheet and Coffin meet,
More fitter for us be.
Then the new so ho, so ho.
FINIS.
