The Declaration of the Esquire at Arms.
FOrasmuch as the Barons of the Exchequer and other Judges of the Commonwealth
of England have in their Judicature made a doubt whether the Parliament be
dissolved or not, It is declared that the Parliament is dissolved, And that all
the actions of Oliver Cromwell Esquire, Captain General of all the English
Forces, be just, honest, and legal; and that he is a just and honest man in
whatsoever he enterprised in the said affairs. And if any person or persons
shall, by any color or pretense whatsoever, attempt to question the Authority
of the Lord General Cromwell, or disturb the peace of this Nation, the Freeborn
persons of England under his protection will call them to a severe account.
