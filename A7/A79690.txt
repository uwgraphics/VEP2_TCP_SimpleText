A PRAYER For HIS HIGHNESS The Prince of Orange, etc.
ALmighty God, who in Times of Trouble, and Danger, do raise up Deliverers of
thy People, and fillest their Hearts with zeal for thy Service, We beseech Thee
to bless his Highness the Prince of Orange, whom thou have sent to be the
Defender of our Laws, and Religion; Protect his Person, strengthen his Hands,
let thy holy* Fear evermore Rule in his Heart, that, having Thee only before
his Eyes, he may in all things seek thy Honor and Glory, and study to Unite
this divided Nation, and Establish it upon the sure Foundations of Mercy and
Truth, Righteousness and Peace. This we beg for Jesus Christ his sake, our only
Lord and Savior. Amen.

FINIS.
