His Majesty's gracious Answer to the Message sent from the Honorable City of
LONDON concerning PEACE.
Mr. Secretary:
YOu could not have presented Us any object of more welcome consequence, than
those desires of our well respected City of London, of which we have always
retained that good opinion, that it was as impossible for the Inhabitants of
that our Capital City, to forget their duties and due respects to Us their
King, as it was impossible for Us to give off the just opinion We have always
had of their loyalty to Us, or the good affections We have always held of
them, the maine Upholders of the dignity of our Kingdom: the wealth of that
City is not unknown to Us, nor the zeal We have found continually in them to
our service. Neither are We ignorant of the many notable supplies our
Ancestors have received from their contributions to the maintenance of the
wars in foreign parts. All which considerations meeting with our own royal
inclinations to the weal and commodity of that City, must needs render Us
very willing and concurrent to any propositions which shall arrive from them,
concerning an accommodation for peace, which We have always coveted with as
much ardour, as We have detested the miseries and oppressions of this present
war, this lamentable and calamitous civil war, which has unmade the peace and
safety of our Kingdom; nay, as it were, uncreated our native royalty,
dependent upon Us from our Ancestors, and left Us a King in title rather than
in essence, the best Pillars of our Kingdom being shrunk from Us, our High
Court of Parliament, whom had We never so unfortunately, by some idle mutinous
spirits, been as it were enforced to desert, when We were in a manner driven
from our palace at White Hall, our subjects had not in such numbers
relinquished Us. But We hope the best; time, moderation, and good counsel
will give a happy period to these distractions which the present wars do
continue, to the destruction of our people and diminution of our regal estate
and dignity. We are sensible of the horrid and great afflictions and
oppressions, that like fatal clouds over-shadow the face of our Dominions, the
many bloud-sheds, rapines and spoils, which have been acted upon the persons
and estates of our good subjects, especially the detriments that have fallen
with a heavy hand upon our City of London. We know these wars have deprived
the Merchant of the benefit of exporting his commodities into foreign parts,
and importing others from thence into our City of London, which must needs
occasion a general defect of trade there, which has been ever held the chief
supportment and increase of the riches of our English Commonwealth, which as
rivers derive themselves from fountains, have been devolved through all our
Dominions from London; it being the spring of commerce and traffic, that
flows through all parts of this Nation. But surely We have just occasion in
this to vindicate Our Selves, that We have never in our soul occasioned these
fatal miseries; violence in some, and misunderstanding in others, having
begot these Hyara-headed confusions, which Heaven no longer prosper Us, than We
shall with our utmost endeavor strive to reduce to a sudden and certain
conclusion, that all our people may evidently perceive We desire no longer to
be esteemed their Sovereign, than we shall give them occasion to credit We
intend merely their advancement, peace, and profit.

Subjects are a Kings best inheritance, the flower of his Crown, and glory of
his Scepter; which far be it from all just Kings (and We include Our Self in
that number) to abridge or violate: the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, We
have ever maintained, and so shall ever do, with our best abilities and power,
the privileges of our High Court of Parliament, and the liberty and the
property of the Subject: In especial, the Immunities and Franchises of our
City of London, which We always esteemed so precious in our thoughts, that
We shall study always to augment rather than decrease them. You have, Mr.
Secretary, delivered Us the intentions of our City of London, presented by
their Agents now in our Court, the maine of which (as you have delivered to Us)
is that We would please to let them understand, whether We will receive any
propositions from our said City, concerning an accommodation of peace between
Us and our High Court of Parliament. Certainly We should appear a strange and
public enemy to Our Self, the peace and prosperity of our Kingdom and
People, should We neglect to embrace any such just and honest propositions.

We are assured, since our City of London can desire this really and heartily,
as by this express is manifested, the rest of our People, Cities, and
Corporations, must be of the same mind; and surely Our high Court of Parliament
must needs concur with them in the same intentions, they having by diverse of
their Declarations given the world to understand, that they have made it the
maine cause of their endeavors, to seek peace and ensue it. We do therefore
(Master Secretary) give you to understand Our Royal will and pleasure,
concerning this precedent point of their Message, that We shall not only be
ready to receive graciously any such Propositions for an Accommodation of Peace
between Our self and Our high Court of Parliament; (for We have much and
evident reason, when We see Our Kingdom torn in pieces by these civil
dissensions, Our People up in Arms one against another, and shedding the blood
of each other, who are all Our native subjects; Our Towns, Cities, and
Villages impoverished by daily plundrings, firings, and outrages) but likewise
to propound them Our selves. The true Religion of God Almighty lies and
languishes under a storm of fatal schisms and opinions; Our own Royalty
has not half its wonted attributes, its train or attendants; Our Laws are
neglected, Laws, which are the Ensigns of Majesty, and the immediate
Ministers of Our Justice, the safeguard and patrimony of Our Subjects, and the
staff and upholder of their liberties. We must therefore, considering all the
fatal misfortunes and incombrances of a civil War, and the immediate
blessings and overflowing benefits of a settled and continued Peace, have
rather a greater propension in Our self to peace, then can be any way in any
of Our People, We being diverse ways more interessed in the common utility then
they can be possible.

Never had any (We may speak that without any partial boast) more desires to
acquire and atchieve the good of his subjects, then Our self; nor ever has
any King been more crossed in his determinations and intentions then Our self,
frequent and fatal jealousies arising between Our high Court of Parliament
and Our self, which have thus long separated Us from the body of Our Kingdom,
and Our Kingdom from Us.

The Parliament We will not blame, nor by any means seek to rip up old
discontents betwixt Us; would they had never been, or at least so ended now,
that by an absolute Act of oblivion they were utterly forgotten; We shall
labor to throw balm and oil into the wounds of the Commonwealth, and so
comply with the desires both of Our Parliament and Our City of London, that if
it be possible a sudden and happy Union may once more be knit up betwixt Us;
that all the inconveniences happening to the Commonwealth by these intemperate
distractions, may be utterly wiped away from the face of Our English Earth, and
that We may live to govern the Natives of this Island as their King, and they
live to honor and obey Us as Our People.

Furthermore (Master Secretary) We would have you intimate to these Agents from
Our City of London, that We in all love embrace their request, concerning Our
return to Our said City and Parliament, and would have them believe it were
far more correspondent to be in quiet at White Hall, Hampton Court, or any of
Our Palaces thereabout, then here at Oxford; where though We have all the
accommodation the country can afford, yet do they not countervaile with
those We could have (as We are confident) in or about Our City of London, which
has always been the supreme chamber of Our Ancestors, and Our own best
beloved residence, till these fatal stirs dis-united us, and forced Us to
depart from thence; whither (you may certify them) We would with as much
willingness return, as ever We did in time of the happiest tranquillity from
any of Our sedentary Progresses, never believing Our Person in more or better
security, then when guarded with the faithful hearts and valiant hands of
those courageous and well-experienced Citizens, who have always had and ever
shall have a near and dear room in Our Royal intention and well-wishes. But
such is the necessity of Our affairs, so urgent the consequence of Our
presence to Our Army, that We are utterly impossibilited of transferring Our
Person from them, who conceiving themselves discountenanced and neglected by
Our absence, would be very apt to grow into dangerous distempers. But for their
Propositions concerning an Accommodation of Peace, let them be sent to Us, and
We shall give them so ample and gracious hearing as shall be fit Us to give,
and them to receive: And as soon as things shall by fair treaty be made ripe
for an enter view between Our self and Parliament, We shall with all
convenient haste repair (according to their desires) to Our City of London. In
the mean time, desire them from Us to continue their good intentions
concerning Peace, and We shall esteem it a principal demonstration of their
loyalty toward Us, and ever study the advancement of their City, and the whole
Commonwealth.

FINIS.
