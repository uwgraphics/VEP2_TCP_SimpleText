His Majesty's love to the Aldermen of London at Hampton Court.
HIs Majesty's goodness and care of this Kingdom, has always bin
wonderful, to the comfort of all his loyal and well-affected Subjects. London
in his returning home, showed its love unto his facred Majesty, and he his
Affection by the honor which he showed down upon it. First of all, in
knighting the Loid Major, and Recorder, at Kingsland, Then by suffering the
Lord Major in such a triumph to bear the sword before him. the like of which,
was never known in England, but the sword was always presented, as an Honor
to some Noblemen.

At Guild Hall his Majesty graced the City with his presence to dine there,
accompanied with his Spouse and Princely children, Gifts were presented there
unto his facred Majesty. And he rewarded them with as great a benefit by
granting unto them (so soon as it shall please God to fet a period to the
wicked Designs of treacherous Rebels in Ireland) Londonderry.

Also upon Thursday, December, 4 about seven of the clock in the morning, so
express his extraordinary love to the city, he sent for five of the Aldermen
of London to Hampton Court, his Majesty's royal Palace, 12 miles distance from
London, and made them all Knights.

What encouragement can Subjects have more, as to love and obey a King, then to
have such favor and love shown by a King; for whose prosperous, happy, and
successive reign, it behooves us all to pray: else there is no question to be
made, but that judgment will be flowred down upon our heads, by the Heavenly
King, for not loving so good a heavenly King.

FINIS.
