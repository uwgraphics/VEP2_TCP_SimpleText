said king of Scotts Ruge Cross purseuaunte at. Arms to show unto him that
for somoche as he the said king contrary to his honor all good reason and
conscience And his oothe of Fidelite for ye ferme entartnynge of perpetual
peace between the kings hygnes our. Sovereign lord and him had invaded this
Raalme / spoylad burnt and robbyd diverse and sondery towns and places in the

murdered and slain many of the kynnes liege people he was common to give him
bayta^. And desired him yt for / somoche / as he was a king and a great Prince
he would of his lusty and no / ble courage consent thereunto and tarry ye same.
And for my said Lords party his lordeshyp promised ye assured
Accomplysshement and perfourmance thereof as he was true knight to god and the
king his master The king of scotts herynge this / message reynued and kepto
with him ye said Ruge Cross pursenau^ta and would not suffer him at ye time to
return again to my said lord

The.v. day of Septembre his lordshyp in his approchynge nyghe to the borders
of. Scotland / mustred at Bolton^ in glendayll and lodged that night therein
yt field with all his Army.

The next day being the.vj day of Septembre the king of scotts sent to my
said lor of Surrey a^ harolde of his called. I lay and demanded if that my
said Lord would iustefye the message sent by the said purse ^ scotts had been
slain and taken prisoners loving unto almighty god all the noble men of
England tha were upon the same field both lords and knights are safe from
any hurt / And none of them a wantynge save oonly master Harrgy Gray sir
Huinfeide lyle both prisoners in Scotla^de sir / John^. Gower of yorkeshyre
and sir John^ Boothe of Lancasshyre both wantynge and as yet not founden

In this battle the scotts had many great Auauntagies / that is to wit
the high. Hills and mountains a great wind with them and sudden rain all
contrary to oug bows and Archers

It is not to be doutbted but the scotts fought manly and were determined
outher to win ye Field or to dye They were also as well appointed as was
possible at all points with Armoure and harneys so that few of them were
slain with arrows Howbeit the bylles did bete-and hew them down woth some
pain and danger to Englysshemen.

The said scotts were so plainly determined to abide battle and not to flee
that they put from them theyr-horses and also put of their bo^tes and shoes and
faught in the vampis / of their hooses every man for the moost-pertie / with a
kene and a shape spear of.v. yerdes long and a target aforh him And when their
speres failed and wera spent / then they faught with great end sharp swerdes
making / little or no noys / vithoue that / that for the-pertie many of them
would desire to be saved.

The field where ye scotts did / lodge was not to be reprouyd but rather to be
commended greatly for there many and great nombre of good iyl tenttes and much
good stuff in the same and in the said field was plenty of wine (...) for
such a great Army Albeit our Army doutynge that the said vytallyes had been
poisoned for their distruccyon would not save but utterly distroyed them.
