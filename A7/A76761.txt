To the King, And both Houses of PARLIAMENT, Thus says the LORD;
MEddle not with my People, because of their Conscience to me; and banish them
not out of the Nation, because of their Conscience: For, if you do, I will send
my Plagues upon you; and you shall know that I am the Lord.

Bristol, the 25th of the 9th Month, 1664, Written in Obedience to the Lord, By
his Servant, Geo. Bishope.
