A Worthy Speech made by the Right Honorable the Lord Brook, at the election
of his Captains and Commanders at Warwick Castle.
GEntlemen, Countrymen, my noble friends and fellow Soldiers, I have a few
words to deliver to you which may deserve your attentions; and will I hope meet
as good welcome and acceptance from you, as they came from me, with the true
zeal to your safeties and the wel-fares of the afflicted Country: we behold
the flourishing and beauteous face of this Kingdom, overspread with the
leprosy of a Civil War: In which, since we are forced for the safeguard of
our lives, the preservation of our liberties, the defense of Gods true Religion
(invaded by the practices of Papists and Malignants) to become actors: I doubt
not but each of you will play your part with that noble resolution and
Christian courage as the greatness and meritoriousnesse of the work does
challenge. No man is born for his own use only, says that great
Common-wealths-man of the Romans, Cicero, his friends and Contrymen claim an
ample share in his abilities, as your friends, your Country, nay your Religion
and God himself demands in yours. And surely it would be both unnatural and
impious to deny such powerful suitors your assistance. I need not remonstrate
what it is you are to fight for, the Cause is so open and obvious to every
understanding. It is for your wives, your children, and your substance, your
lives and liberties, nay that which is more powerful to move men's affections,
the testimony of good consciences, and what ever can be to humane frailty dear
and precious; all these, as if they sought the way to new mischiefs through
the old ones, are pointed at by the Popish malignants now in arms against us:
they have plundered our neighbors, ravished their estates out of their
possessions, and committed inhumane and unheard of barbarousnesse in every
place where the tempest of their fury has had license to show it is malice: And
can you imagine they would stay there, that their insatiate avarice and thirst
of blood will be quenched and appeased with these petty spoils: No Gentlemen,
they aim at you, at all our ruins, desolations, and deaths, are machinated by
these vipers, who would know a passage to their ambitions, through the intralls
of their mother the Commonwealth; whose destruction they have pursued as
craftily and violently, as is possible to be expected from persons of so much
acrimony and spleen to the Subjects liberties, and aversion of true Religion
and all goodness: persuasions to valiant men, as I know you to be, are
useless, and if I thought there were any of you that was not incited more by
the justice of the quarrel, then my Oratory to fight in this Cause, surely I
should rather wish his room then his company; for if the Nobility and bravery
of the Cause be not sufficient to animate cowards, and make the meanest
spirits courageous. I know not what possible can stir up mortal men to put on
undaunted resolutions: Behold your wives with tears in their eyes, and their
little infants at their breasts or in their hands, imploring safety and defense
from your arms, and should you desert them and expose their innocence to the
rapine and fury of the Malignants. I doubt not but they would be ready to meet
you as those Roman Matrons of old did their flying persons and husbands, and
ask if they thought to creep again into their mothers wombs and hide
themselves. Nay, which should be more prevalent, to excite your courage to
fight this good fight for the Lord of hosts; your Religion and freedom of your
Consciences, which far transcends your corporeal liberty, invoaks you to stand
up it is champions against those Papisticall Malignants; who would strike at God
through the very heart of his known truth, so long practiced amongst us: And
surely nothing can be dearer to any of Conscience, then the security of this
his Conscience, and it is unvaluable freedom: you have viewd and heard my good
friends and Contrymen, with what severity and spightfulnesse these
adversaries to all truth and humanity, have depopulated the neighbor Towns
and Countries, leaving them neither money nor victuals, and which is worse,
depriving them of all means to supply those necessities, or rectify those
wants, by carrying away their cattle and horses, the instruments of their
husbandry and tillage: expect you the same measure, Gentlemen, if you quit not
your selves like men: and whereas the going against the King may stagger some
resolutions, I shall easily disabuse you from those vain surmises and
uncertain imaginations, it is for the King we fight, to keep a Crown for our
King, a Kingdom for our Sovereign and his posterity, to maintain his known
rights and privileges, which are relative with the peoples liberties, from a
sort of desperate State incendiaries, that in seeming to fight for his Majesty
brandish open arms against his sacred Crown and Dignity. For if you will but
observe the men of whom the adverse army is compounded, you shall find them
either notorious Papists or Popishly affected persons, and then be convinced in
your own reasons, if it be possible, that those men should take up arms in the
Kings defense whom by so many divellish plots and hellish stratagems, have
sought not only his precious life, but the lives of his Predecessors Queen
Elizabeth, and his Father of sacred memory, as that never to be forgotten
powder plot shall for ever testify to their shame and confusion of face:
wherein they would at one blow not only have destroyed our pious King that now
reigns (and long may he live and reign over us) but his Father, brother, and
all the royal Progeny with the chief of the Nobility of the Kingdom. And if
these men be competent persons to be entrusted with the Kings safety, who have
so apparently sought his ruin, let all indifferent men be judge, or that
Papists and Jesuited persons will ever fight to maintain that Religion which
they manifestly oppugn in their lives and doctrines, and have both by foraign
and domestic treacheries sought to root out from the face of the earth, as by
88. and other of their attempts is manifest and perspicuous, that they should
be patriots to keep our laws and religion from violation or alteration, whose
Justice points them out for disturbers of the public Peace, and renders them
able to punishments in their estates and persons, as notorious and convicted
Malefactors; as well we may believe the light is a friend to darkness, or that
the warring Elements should cease their perpetual difference, as allow that
paradox.

But I would not, Countrymen, be too tedious to you. And touching these
Gentlemen, who being strangers come hither to proffer us their service, and in
testimonial of their abilities and that they have been Commanders in the
Germane Wars, have here produced their several Certificates.

I must needs thank the Gentlemen for their kind proffer, and yet desire
license to be plain with them, hoping they will not take it as a disparagement
to their valor, if I tell them we have now too woeful experience in this
Kingdom of the German wars; and therefore cannot so well approve of the aid
of foreign and mercinary auxiliaries. In Germany they fought only for
spoil, rapine and destruction, merely money it was and hope of gain that
excited the Soldier to that service: It is not here so required as the cause
stands with us; We must rather employ men who will fight merely for the Cause
sake, and bear their own charges, than those who expect rewards and salaries,
for by such means we shall never have a conclusion of these wars; for
mercenaries, whose end is merely their pay, whereas their subsistence rather
covet to spin out the wars to a prodigious length, as they have done in other
Countries, then to see them quickly brought to a happy period; we must
dispatch this great work in a short time or be all liable to inevitable ruin.
I shall therefore freely speak my conscience, I had rather have a thousand or
two thousand honest Citizens that can only handle their arms, whose hearts
go with their hands, than two thousand of mercinary Soldiers, that boast of
their foreign experience. For such make money merely the end of their
endeavors, without looking into the Justice of the Cause, when those
well-affected Citizens being acquainted with the cause which is for Almighty
God, their Religion, the Laws of the Land, the Subjects Liberty and safety will
now be a means to be encouraged and be animated to go on courageously in this
great work, (knowing that good deeds are rewarded in themselves) if God be not
pleased to give a blessing to the work in hand by a fair and honest
Accommodation between his Majesty and Parliament to give a cessation to these
wars. And yet I hear of many who will neither lend their money nor give
their aid and assistance in this so weighty a matter, (as I have said before;)
yet look to be defended and kept from violence as well as those men which so
freely and voluntarily contribute to the great charges, why should such men
stand, and only looking on like ciphers, yet hoping to have share and benefit
in the common good; when other men both take the pains, hazard their lives, and
spend their estates for them and theirs, what man would not give the twentieth
part of his estate to save the other nineteen from being taken from him, nay,
and it may be his life too. And so I shall concinde my Speech, and turn into
prayer this my Discourse; That God Almighty will arise and maintain his own
cause, scattering and confounding the devices of his enemies, not suffering the
ungodly to prevail over his poor innocent flock. Lord, we are but a handful
in consideration of thine and our enemies, therefore O Lord fight thou our
battles, go out as thou did in the time of King David before the Hosts of
thy servants, and strengthen and give us hearts, that we show our selves men
for the defense of thy true Religion, and our own and the King and Kingdoms
safety.

FINIS.
