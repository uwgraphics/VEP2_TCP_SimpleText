The Cities thanks to Southwarke, for giving the Army entrance.
We thank you more then we will say,
But it is the clean contrary way.
WE thank you Neighbors for your love
For sending for the Army,
Which cannot prejudicial prove,
Alas, they will never harm ye.
Nor to the City will they do
But what is good and fair,
They will help all the Suburbs too,
When frogs fly in the air.
You clownes and fools that nothing know
But are made for the slaughter,
By you ou^ fears do daily grow
Weel fit you for theereafter.
Did ever men before like you,
Send for their bane unto them
And court their presence, whom they knew
Would but at best undo them?
And give possession of their works
To those whose undertakings
Show they will force men like the Turks
To serve Gods of their makings.
You knaves and dolts that etc.
May those that on the Thames do plow
And unto our side ferry
Break Oars and arms as they do row
And each man split his Wherry.
May the huge Porpoise swallow them,
And near, like Jonas, shore them,
And may their sins still follow them,
And dead, no man deplore them.
You skabs and varlets nothing etc.
Dee think the Army will regard
Men that are so perfidious,
And not at length give you reward
That shall be home and hideous?
They wisely do the treason love,
But yet the traitors hate,
And may you them to mercy move
When it shall be too late.
You lumpish Elves that etc.
Did we make you our trustees, to
Do as you thought fitting,
And did we give our lives to you
Unto our selves unwitting?
If not, how durst you be so bold
Our foes for to invite
And with them treaty for to hold,
Ere we thought requisite?
Ye traiterous guls etc.
May boystrous Thames swell high with rage
And cause an inundation,
Which nothing but your lives may swage,
Let Boreas take his station
Upon your houses, and with them
Into the River sweep you,
Where slaves to Neptunes Diadem
May he for ever keep you.
Ye cravens that do etc.
And what now have you galnd, since that
You did that sordid action,
You may expect we know not what
In way of satisfaction?
But shall we tell you what it is
That we for thanks intend you?
We know you for our foes in this,
And let the Devil mend you.
Ye sordid coxcombes who naught know etc.
Alas, you wanted those would swill
And drink your hogsheads dry,
That made you have so good a will
To send for the Army.
They paid you ready money then,
But theyl do so no more,
We owe you, and time will be when
We will wipe off our score.
You scoundrels that do etc.
Now to conclude we give you thanks
For that your kind intention,
And those many other prankes
Which now we will not mention.
And we assure you when time serves,
We amply will requite you,
Even as it at our hands deserves,
But so as it shall spite you.
And so ye Rogues that nothing know,
But are made for the slaughter,
We shall to you your own play show*
And fit you fort hereafter.
FINIS.
