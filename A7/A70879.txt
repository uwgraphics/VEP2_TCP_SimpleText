SOME FEW OBSERVATIONS upon his Majesty's late Answer to the Declaration, or
Remonstance of the Lords and Commons of the 19. of May, 1642.
Page 1. Or of following the advice of our Council of Scotland.
OUr case is not as Scotlands was in all points, though in many it be very
like, for our malignant party here is far greater and stronger, and more
enraged against us, by their own greatness, and more animated by our
weakness. Yet we desire but the same satisfaction which Scotland had, without
so much reluctance given them by the King. For their Militia, and all other
subordinate power in that Kingdom, is settled in such hands as are publicly
confided in, and yet this is utterly denied us. And our holding Hull is not
like their holding Newcastle, yet their Honor is saved, whilst we are called
unpararalel'd Traitors, and they are restored to all demanded rights and
securances, whilst we are charged of unpardonable Rebellion, and satisfaction
is not offered to us, but required from us, in the most approbrious language
that can be, yet still we will not refuse the Council of the Scots Lords, in
yielding to a pacification, nor depart from the example of them, in the manner
of securing the same.

Page 2. That we should fancy and create dangers to Our Self.
We have little cause to think that the same malignant party which has shed so
much Protestant blood in Ireland, and about the same time plotted a villainous
massacre in Edenborough, has been supinely snorting in England all this
Parliament, since their vigilance is more concerned here, then in either of
these Kingdoms; and since they have advantages to do mischifes in England,
far greater than in Scotland, and almost as great as in Ireland, and for the
Plots themselves, diverse of them have not been invisible, and yet if the King
had not concealed, and did not yet conceal, some passages (as being below him)
they had been more visible; but jealousy in such cases is not unpolitique, and
the less jealous the King is, the more we have cause to be so: Ireland a few
days before its ruin, had less ground of fear then we have had; some of our
Treasons here have not been planted in Trains and Mines, so deep and dark, nor
so much resembled the Cockatrice eye, as that of Ireland, and if the King be
not privy to the Plots, yet as long as the Plotters having aims beyond him,
plow with his heifer, and act by his power, our condition is the more desperate
and remediless, and since the King cannot see into the breasts of those his
followers, whom we suspect, he ought not so far to despise the public
iealousies of whole Nations, or the distractions or insecurity of such
considerable multitudes as he does; but the King appeals to Gods all-searching
eye, and we do the same, imploring of him to be the more vindicative in this
case, the more destitute* we all are of any other recourse or redress upon
earth.

Page 5. Wherein they usurp the word Parliament.
The King frequently vows to maintain Parliaments in their Privileges, yet
his Papers many ways derogate from them; For first if he please to sever
himself, those great Councels are not to be named Parliaments. Secondly,
whatsoever name is due, the virtue of public representation is denied them,
they are not to be looked upon as the whole Kingdom, and this is destructive
to the essence of Parliaments. Thirdly, if the concurrence of both Houses,
Nullo contradicente, be of some sanctity and authority, yet the mayor part of
both Houses is not so vigorous as the total, and here is another devise to
frustrate all Parliaments. Fourthly, if the maiority shall bind, and the
minority acquiesce therein, yet if it be objected that some few factious
spirits mislead and befoole the majority, all is void, Parliaments thus are
made ridiculous Assemblies, and all Justice at the last resort is to be
expected from the Kings sole breast, or else no where; for if the King will
withdraw himself, all Courts as well as Parliaments are thus defeated and
disabled, and then if the King assumes not sole power to himself, all
Government is expired, and no way is left for the Kingdom to preserve it
self, and what can be more unnatural? In policy then, if we are grown weaty
of Parliaments, and will dissolve them into nothing, we ought to erect some
other Court above them, or in their stead, or else to resign all into the
Kings sole boundless discretion, for any form of Rule is better then none at
all; and before we demolish old structures, we ought to be advised of the
fashions of new.

Page 6. And whose advise we are resolved to follow.
But what if the major and better part of the privy Council concur with the
King, if Parliaments must down, that Rule is better then Anarchy; But hitherto
neither both Houses, nor the Judges, nor the Lords of the Council have
concurred, but if the concurrence of Parliaments be not necessary, how can any
other seem but unnecessary, and at mere discretion, has not the King the
same right to shake off inferior Councels, as that which is supreme, or shall
he have cause to confide in the knowledge of less Honorable Courts, more then
of that which is the quintessence of all his Subjects, which is indeed the very
Throne it self whereon he sits so sure, and whose consent and council is that
very Diadem which inriches his Temples, and that Mace which arms his hands;
who would have thought in time of Parliament to have heard the name of Privy
Councellor cited to the lessening of Parliaments, yet here nothing but the very
name too is cited, nor no compsiance promised but arbitrary; so many ways are
Parliaments blown away like bubbles, yet none is so much insisted on, as that
which seems most incredible, that Master Pym, and four or five of his
consorts should besot and stupifie two or three hundred Gentlemen chosen out of
the flow^e of the Kingdom, when as the King has in Parliament some spirits as
Mercuriall, and heads as watchful, and hearts as resolute, without some
extremely violent Magic, may seem incredible, nay, were it certain that
Master Pym were the greatest Nigromancer living, and the deepest read in black
infernal arts, I should hardly trust the efficacy of his spells in such
expedients.

Page 8. That those Rebels publicly threaten the rooting out of the name of
the English.
That the Irish Rebels by their success are now intentive to root out the
English, is probable, but their first aim and cause of commotion might be some
other more particular inducement, for the English Government was long before in
the same manner irksome to them as now, but some other invitation now happened
of shaking it off, and not before.

Ibidem. As they have invaded that power of ours over the Militia.
The Question is not to be put indefinitely, whether or no the King ought to
order the Militia in times of no extraordinary danger; our case is now upon
supposition, if the King in extraordinary danger will not yield to such a
Posture as the Kingdom thinks most safe, whether the Parliament may not order
that Posture of themselves, so the Parliament puts it. But the King puts it
thus. If the Parliament invades his power over the Militia causelessly, whether
they may not as well seize any Subjects estates. That question then which must
decide all, is this, whether that Posture which the Parliament chooses, or that
of the Kings, be most safe for the Kingdom at this time, and who shall judge
thereof most properly. Till now that the ancient Pillars of Law, and Policy
were taken away, and the State set upon a new basis, no evil was to be
presumed of the representative body of the Kingdom, nor no Justice expected
from a King deserting his grand Council, but now every man may arraign
Parliaments, and they which understand no reason, must have reason, not
authority to rely upon; no King was ever yet so just but that Parliaments have
in some things reduced them from error, nor no Kings so unjust that Parliaments
did seduce into error, yet Parliaments are now charged of being enemies to
Religion, laws, liberties. And the King to preserve these, absents himself
from Parliaments, but since we must dispute for Parliaments; first we say they
must in probability be more knowing then any other privadoes; Secondly, in
regard of their public interest, they are more responsible then any other, and
less to be complained of in case of error. Thirdly, they have no private
interest to deprave them, nothing can square with the Common Council but the
common good, and if 500. of the Nobility and Gentrey should aim at an
Aristocraticall usurpation, or any other power of oppression, they could never
compass their ends, it were folly in them. Some such objections have been
made against this Parliament, but finding little credit, at last some few of
the Parliament are pitched upon, as if it were credible that all the kingdom in
whose hands all real natural power consists would inslave themselves to 500.
or those 500. voluntarily become slaves to five men. (good God) the King is
presumed to have the hearts of the majority, and to be trampled upon by some
few, and yet the magical incantation is so strong, that neither the Kings
Authority, nor the justice of his cause, nor the oppressed Commonaltie can
prevail against the Parliament, or the Parliament it self, against such an
inconsiderable number in Parliament. O that some Mercury would reconcile my
understanding in this Court Logic, or give me some clew of thread to disingage
me out of this blind Labarinth; but to come more particularly to the Militia it
self, now settled by the Parliament, the King excepts against the Parliaments
ordinance, for two reasons, first because it excludes him for the disposing of
it, and secondly from determining it at his pleasure, but we must know that the
Kingdom trusts the King with Arms as it does with the Laws, and no
otherwise, and since the King in Person is not most fit always, nor can in all
places be present, to execute either military or judicial offices, therefore
the maine execution in both is entrusted to substitutes; the end of all
Authority in substitutes is, that the kingdom may be duly and safely served,
not that the Kings mere fancy may be satisfied, and that end is more likely to
be accomplished where the Kingdom, then where the King chooses, but whosoever
chooses the substitutes, the King is not excluded thereby, for the King has
more cause to confide in men recommended by his highest Court, then the people
have in men preferred merely by the King, against the consent of his highest
Court; and if it were not so, vet the confidence and assurance of the people,
in times of distractions, is more requisite then the Kings, but in this new
Militia, the King is not so much excluded from his general superintendance,
and supreme influence, as he is in subordinate Courts of Justice, and yet even
in the Kings Bench, where the King in Pleas of the Crown may not sit as Judge,
he may not be said to be excluded, neither is it any prejudice to the King in
the second place, that he cannot determine these new Commissions at his
pleasure without publik consent, except upon misdemeanour, for though all men
naturally desire absolute command, and to be uncontroleable in things that are
bad as well as things that are good, yet this is but the exorbitant desire of
corrupted nature, and wise men do not seek always to satisfy it, but rather
to suppress it. In case of misdemeanor no man's commission shall justify him
agains the King, and where no misdemeanour is, what would the mere power of
determining the commission avail the King. For we see in diverse Monarchies
and free States, some Princes which are limited from evil are not the more
disabled from good, and if they be sometimes, that nation is perhaps happier,
which intrusts Princes too little, then that which intrusts them two far, and
yet nevertheless I desire to see no innovation in our English Monarchy,
neither if this King shall upon this or that emergent occasion yield to some
temporal restraint, would I wish to see it perpetual, except in things only
tending to evil, for example, the King had a Prerogative to discontinue and
dissolve Parliaments at pleasure, and the abuse of this Prerogative was the
cause of all our late sufferings, but this Prerogative being restrained, what
injury is likely to follow either to the King or State, for in such
restrictions, which are from greater evils, but from less good, the King ought
not to be difficult, and in such restrictions which may disable from good, as
well as evil, the people ought not to be importunate; but it is further
objected that by the same power Parliaments may disseise both the King and
Subjects from their estates, as they make ordinances for the Militia, but in
truth is not this a strange result, the Parliament have power to do good
offices by the consent of the people, and therefore they may have power to do
ill offices against the consent both of King and People, it is of dangerous
consequence to suppose that Parliaments will do any injustice, it loses one
of the firmest ^inewes of Law to admit it; but to conclude that Parliaments can
do such injustice as may oppress both King and People, from whom all their
power is derived, is unnatural: and whereas the King claymes an interest in
the Militia as legal and proper as ours are, in our Lands or Tenements, we
must avoid mistakes herein; for in our goods and inheritances we have not so
pure and unconditionall a right, but that it is inconsistant with the common
right also, and in this respect the Kings possessions are not privileged more
then a subject, for the States propriety cannot be excluded out of either,
the same man also may have several proprieties in several things, for that
propriety which the King has in a Subject, is not the same, nor so entire as
that which he has in his horse, for that right which he has as a Prince, is
by way of trust, and all trust is commonly limited more for the use of the
party trusting, then the party trusted; in some cases also there are mutual
proprieties, and so the King ownes us as his Subjects, and we own him as our
King, but that ownership which we have in him as our King, is of a far more
excellent and high nature then that ownership which the King has in us as his
Subjects; that occasional interest which the Scots had in Newcastle, or the
Parliament in Hull, did not wholly drown the Kings interest, nor the
Particular owners, such temporary possessions may sometimes happen without the
utter disseisin or dissinherison of each other, and we see in a breach of
peace, the Constable by force takes my sword from me, and in such manner as he
may not take my cloak, although my interest in my Sword is as good as in my
cloak, and yet my property in my Sword is not altered by that property which
the officer seises to himself; and doubtless had the same arguments been
pressed against disseisin of Lesley, as have been since against Sir John
Hotham, they would have been held much more impertinent then now they are, so
much more are we vilipended and harder treated then other nations are; let not
common sense then be so much baffled as to make this temporary possession of
Hull taken by Sir John Hotham, upon an extraordinary necessity of State so
declared by the Judgment of Parliament, for the preventing of civil War;
and consequently for the preventing of great dis-service, both to King and
State; the same thing, as the violent intrusion of a private dis-seizor upon
the just inheritance of his Neighbor: he which confesses, That the King has a
true and perfect interest in the Kingdom, does not deny, That the Kingdom has
a more worthy and transcendent interest in it self, and in the King too: This
is so far from contradiction, that he is far from reason, that so conceives
it. And he which does not conceive that that which is the judgment of the
major part in Parliament, is the sense of the whole Parliament; and that which
is the sense of the whole Parliament, is the judgment of the whole Kingdom;
and that which is the judgment of the whole Kingdom, is more vigorous, and
sacred, and unquestionable, and further beyond all appeal, then that which is
the judgment of the King alone, without all Council, or of the King, with any
other inferior Clandestine Council, most raze those rocky Foundations, upon
which, this State has been so happily settled, for so many ages now past.

As to the impeachment of the fix Members of Parliament, Page 10. 11. That no
retractation made by us, nor no actions since that time committed against us,
and the Laws of the Land, under pretense of vindication of privileges, can
satisfy the contriver of that Declaration.
the King pleads retractation and satisfaction, his retractation is an
acknowledgement, that it was a casual single mistake; yet in form only; for
the grounds of his charge when they shall be published, he assures us, will
satisfy the world; But in the mean time, these grounds are kept unpublished,
contrary to the desire of the Parliament, and the whole Kingdom, and till that
publication the world remains unsatisfied, nay it is most wonderful, that so
desperate and horrid a plot, as that yet seems to be, should be so long
neglected, to the Kings vast dis-advantage, and the peoples miserable disquiet,
if clear satisfaction could be so easily given, every man sees, that the
charge, if it had not good grounds did stab furiously at the heart of all
Parliaments, and at all Liberties in Parliament, but till publication of these
grounds be, no man will presume to judge; yet it is of great concernment to His
Majesty's honor, and the Kingdoms peace, that it be not too long delayed. But
in the next place, the King conceives, That the Parliament has been injurious
to him in Vindication of Parliament privileges, and therefore ought to be
satisfied; the Parliament still begs for that publication, for nothing else can
make them appear to have been injurious; and till they appear to have been
injurious; they ought not to be condemned as injurious, for de non entibus and
de non apparentibus eadem est ratio; As for the Kings coming into the House of
Commons so armed, till publication of the cause of that coming, the
circumstances cannot be duly waighed.

executing such Authority.
though of the most undoubted privileges, or rights, by a kind of after game,
he must seek remedy in the future; but for the present, he is remediless, But
if this be Law, I think every man sees that the English man's liberty, and share
in the grand Charter, is a thing easily deseasable, for it is as likely, That
the King may justify and protect His Ministers, after the execution of unjust
commands, as to urge them by undue Warrants to the same, and if so, then where
is the Subjects of England, freedom and Patrim^^^; what is it still but held
upon the Kings mere courtesy.

any notorious malicious crime can be proved, if we shelter or protect any such,
let our injustice be published to the world.
who has incensed Him against His Parliament, and who have given Council
derogatory to the honor, and destructive to the essence of all Parliaments,
and to the Parliament this is utterly unknown; yet the King desires evidence of
these things from the Parliament; Nay, though he disavow the sheltring of ill
Ministers, yet he conceals such as have traduced and slandered the Parliament
in some things notoriously false; and yet to an ordinary understanding, it is
the same thing to conceal, as to shelter a Delinquent; and if it be below a
King to reveal a traiterous Incendiary, that has abused His ear with
pernicious calumnies, It is below him too to leave him to justice being
otherwise revealed.

He which will not accuse the King for want of zeal against the Irish Rebels;
Page, ibid. They have employed our connivance, as want of zeal against the Rebels
in Ireland.
yet may truly say, there is not the same zeal expressed, as was against the
Scots, though the case be far different, for the Scots were Protestants, and
had been greatly agrieved, and were not imbrued willingly in blood, and yet the
English Nation against their wills, were most rigorously hastened, and enforced
to Arm against them; but now, when the English Nation and Scots too, were moved
to indignation, and horror, against the most bloody perfidious ungrateful
villains in the world; their proffered supplies are retarded, and
opportunities are neglected, and nice exceptions framed, and the cursed
reproaches of the Rebels themselves, calling the Parliament disloyal and
Traitors, are countenanced and seconded.

our privity the Army was in agitation.
do not evince beyond all doubt, that any such agitation was with the Kings
privity; but according to humane judgment, which do not always proceed upon
certain appearances of things. Some such things were in agitation, and some
presumption there is of the Kings privity, and if in other cases such
presumptions as these do not always pass, for good and strong proofs; yet I
in my experience, did never here before, that they were rejected as light
discourses, though the King now contemn them so; Neither is the mere
miscarriage of the plot without the prevention of the Parliament, any good
argument that no such plot was, for so the Irish may be excused in all those
places, which they failed to surprise, for treason were no treason, if it were
not more obscure and hard to be discovered, and that as well by the ill as good
success of it.

As for those tumults about Westminster, Page 19. We will have Justice for
those tumults.
how far the Londoners were engaged in them, offensively, and defensively,
and how far the soldiers which were entertained at Whiteball, were raisers
of them, and how far thieves, and boutifures intermingled themselves for
rapines sake, rests yet in judgment; and I conceive the Parliament is as
desirous to have justice seasonably done therein, as the King; But sure, the
English Nation, nor the City, nor the Parliament, cannot be suspected of having
any intent to raise Arms against the Kings Person, or His Children: this were a
great scandal and unmerited, and if the Kings flight was for fear of any
cursed Assassinates; for which the English have not been infamous, His ordinary
Guard had been as safe to him here, as it is at York.

Here it is supposed, Page 21. Where is every man's property, every man's
liberty, if a major part of both Houses declare, That the Law is, That the
younger Brother shall inherit, what becomes of all the families and estates in
the Kingdom*
that Parliaments may make an Ordinance contrary to Law, Nature, Reason, Sense;
and it is inferred therefore, That they are dangerous, and may bring the life
and liberty of the Subject to a Lawless, and Arbitrary subjection; this
supposition is inconsistent with one of the most sacred and venerable pillars
of all Law and policy; and yet here it is insisted upon, Let all Chronicles be
searched, and let one Story be cited of any Parliament, which did tyrannize
over King and Subject, or ordain any thing to the mischief of both; yet Kings I
think will not make the same challenge, the best of them have done Acts of
oppression, and the Reasons are apparent for it; but no Reasons can be given
why Parliaments should usurp, or how they can usurp; yet the Kings inference
runs against all Parliaments: He does not say this Parliament tyrannizeth, and
therefore he resides from them, and pronounces their Votes invalid, but because
Parliaments may tyrannize; therefore they have no power in their Votes at all,
at any time whatsoever, further then the King ratifies them. The Parliament
says not so much; they say he is now seduced by wicked Council, and therefore
rejects their requests, to the danger of the State: In such cases they conceive
there is a power in them to secure the State without his concurrence: At other
times, when the Kings are not seduced, they ought to do nothing without their
consent; for non recurrendum est ad extraordinaria in iis quae fieri possunt
per ordinaria: Whether this or that Doctrine enwraps the greatest danger, let
all the world judge.

As for seditious Preachers and Pamphlette^rs, Page 27. Seditious Pamphlets and
Sermons.
the Parliament will not protect any, when greater matters are provided for,
the Law shall have a free course against them; and account shall be given by
all which have favored them. In the mean time the Parliament only desires,
That it may not be put is these times of general extremity, to intend
universal enormities, and in the le^all pursuance thereof be made Informers,
Solicitors, Witnesses, and Judges, and that they may not be bound to give an
account for all misdemeanors, or to remedy all men's abuses in an instant, and
not withstanding all opposition, give general satisfaction to all the world,
or aspire to a condition above man.

We hold Parliaments in England, Page 24. That such are continually preferred
and countenanced by us, who are friends or favorers, or related unto the chief
authors or actors of that arbitrary power heretofore practiced and complained
of.
as the Apples of our eyes; and we know all liberty must stand or fall with
them; And we conceive Parliaments were never more endangered* nor by more
conspiracies assailed, then they have been since this Parliament began: And the
persons which possess the King against them we cannot nominate, but he knows,
and favors, and employes them. If he have any Counselors which suggest advice
to him, as his late papers carry in them, they are the malignant party; and
their study is, That some way may be found out, so to master and quell this
Parliament, as that is may president future times to do the same. Nothing is
more visible, then that Parliaments are odious to Court parasites; and the same
disposition which discontinued them so long, and dismissed them so often, still
labors to frustrate and ruinate them for ever. What parties have been framed
in the Country, in the City, in the Parliament it self, in England, in
Scotland, in Ireland, in other Nations, to blast this Parliament, and to make
it scandalous; and yet we all see they are Traitors, they are unheard of
paralleled Traitors: for seeking their own defense, for entertaining any
jealousies, or for mentioning any plots: what late change there is in the King,
or alienation from the defendors of arbitrary power, is not evident by his
papers; for if they do truly represent him and his Counselors to us, we may
doubt that Parliaments are not gotten into better grace at Court, then they
were in my Lord of Straffords time; and yet it is undoubted, That if we suffer
in the Rights of Parliaments, no other rights can be done us: And as we were
better have no Parliaments, then Parliaments maimed in their privileges, so we
had better have no being at all in England, then no Parliaments,

The main thing begged by the Parliament, Page 27. We require no other Liberty
to our wills, then the meanest of them do, we wish they would always use that
liberty, not to consent to any thing evidently contrary to our conscience and
understanding: and we have, and shall always give as much estimation and
regard to the advice and counsel of both Houses
is the Kings return, and that all subordinate power and honor (especially
during our distractiors) may be put into men's hands as the generality is
assured of: How this should be contrary to His conscience and understanding
here, and not in Scotland, I do not see; and yet that which was there
reasonable, is here treasonable; nay, and though we be denied in it, yet we
must not believe cur eyes, for still it is pressed that the Parliament has done
nothing for the King, and have been denied nothing from the King, in the least
degree necessary to the peace, plenty, and security of the Subject; and yet in
public matters, conscience, and understanding are not always to be too far
trusted, where we depart from Maior-parties, or such who are more to be
trusted, then our selves, few Cases are in Law or policy beyond all dispute and
scruple; and if the King in disputable Cases will charge His Own Apprehension,
rather then His other Judges and Counselors, His breast must prove at last the
sole unappealable Judge of all things.

How the King is to given an account of His Royalty here, Page 27, 28. The
office and dignity of a King, is not within their determinations, and of which
we must give an account to God, and our other Kingdoms.
to His other Kingdoms, more then to this; or how it is beyond the cognizance
of Parliaments, because he is accountable to God for it; I apprehend not,
subordinate Magistrates are also accountable to God, and their power is derived
from God, and yet it is not beyond human determination, but some Courtiers do
suggest that all supreme dignities are so founded by Gods immediate hand alone,
as there remains nothing human in them, and that public consent of such, and
such Nations, as to such and such limits, and conditions is nothing at all
requisite; this is the ground of all Arbitary unbounded sway; for if Nations by
common consent, can neither set limits, or judge of limits set to sovereignty,
but must look upon it as a thing merely divine, and above al humain consent or
comprehension, then all nations are equally slaves, and we in England are borne
to no more by the Laws of England then the Asanine Peasants of France are
there, whose Wooden shoes and Canvas Breeches sufficiently proclaim, what a
blessedness it is to be borne under a mere divine Prerogative; but I hope that
Prerogative, in defense of which, the King intends to sacrifice his life, is
that which is settled, and bounded by the known Laws of the Land, and whose
surest* Basis is the common consent, and whose most honorable end is the
common good, and not such a divine Prerog^ti^e; which none understand, but our
ghostly Counselors, which always express sufficient Enmity and Antipathy to
the public Acts and Pacts of Men: It is generally believed, That these late
expressions of the Kings had not been so sharp, if there had not been more of
the divine, then either of the Lawyer or Statesman in them; But God send our
Scholars more grace to think more honorable of their Pulpits, that the Church
may be more edified, and the State less pert^^^ed by them hereafter; it was
heretofore Levi and Simeon the heads of the main Malignants, whose union breeds
our disunion, were Papists and Hierarchists, they now are Hierarchists and
Papists.
