Carisbrooke, September. 7. 1648. My Lord, and M. Speaker,
I Have received your Letter of the 2d. of this Month, containing the names of
those who are to Treat with me, and though they do not come at the time
appointed, I shall not wonder at first, judging it too short, in respect of my
two Houses, not my self, that I did not imagine it could be kept; (I then
commanded Sir Peter Killegrew to tell by word of mouth) and therefore it shall
be far from me to take exceptions for their having elapsed the appointed time;
for God forbid that either my two Houses or I should carp at Circumstances, to
give the least impediment to this Treaty, much less to hinder the happy
finishing of it: I say this the rather, because I know not how it is possible,
(in this I shall wish to be deceived) that in forty days Treaty the many
distractions of these Kingdoms can be settled; and if so, it were more then
strange, that time enough should not be given for the perfecting of this most
gteat and good work, which as I will not believe can be stuck on by my two
Houses, so I am sure it shall never be, by

Your good Friend, CHARLES R.
I think fit to tell you, because J believe in this Treaty there will be need
of Civil Lawyers, J have sent for my Advocate Rives and D. Duck.



For the Lord Hunsden, Speaker of the House of Peers pro tempore, and William
Lenthall Speaker of the House of Commons.
