THe testimony of Christ was Truth, Peace his Legacy; he came into the World to
bear witness to the Truth, and at his departure bequeathed Peace to his
Disciples. This Author walking in his Masters steps, has contended for Truth
against Heresy in his former Labors, in these for Peace and unity against
Schism: A bold undertaking in these distracted times, but yet necessary, and
hopeful. Truth is strong, and will prevail against Heresies, and that Peace may
be established in the Churches is the scope of this TREATISE, and the Prayer of
him who approves it to be Imprinted,

useful formality, and at all times an innocent Ceremony. Only for thy
satisfaction take this brief Epistolary Declaration.

Mistake it not. It is not New England that I have here to deal with, nor yet
properly New Englands way, commonly known by the name of Independency. Which
though I cannot in all things subscribe to as [ the] way of Christ precisely
laid forth in the Word for all the Churches to walk in, yet, were I there,
rather then make a Schism in the Body, I would quietly submit to, blessing God
that I might sit down in it, and enjoy the comforts of it. It is Separation
that my quarrel is against. And that not Separation in a Church, by purging of
it; but Separation from a Church, by departing from it, and forsaking communion
with it. For the former of these I plead, as the most hopeful means to heal our
breaches. The latter I implead, and that by the name of Schism properly and
formally so called. Whether this plea be just or no, let the sequel speak:
Which as I was necessitated to Preach (meeting with so just a ground for it in
the Text, which in my ordinary course (passing through the Epistle) I fell
with, and but too just an occasion for it in the place where I live), so am I
now to publish; and that, as for other ends, so for the vindicating both the
Truth of God and my Self from those unjust and unchristian imputations, which
have been charged upon both by some who have taken upon them to Censure what
they would not vouchsafe to hear. I know the subject is such as must look for
little better entertainment abroad at many hands. Naturally all men are given
to think well, and to desire to hear nothing but well of their own opinions and
ways. What herein crosses them, goes against the grain of nature, and so no
wonder if it seem harsh and unpleasing. But this, as it has been no invitation
to me to deal with it, so neither is it now any discouragement to me in the
publication of it. The Work (I trust) is Gods; not undertaken (I am sure)
without an eye to his glory, and his Churches good. And therefore I shall leave
the success thereof unto him to whom I have consecrated my Labors and my Self.
Possibly somewhat of man may be found in the managing of it, (as in agitations
of this nature it is hard not to mingle our own Spirits with Gods); If so, upon
the discovery I shall freely acknowledge it. In the mean time my conscience
bears me record that my aim has been to inform, and not to irritate; to make
up our breaches and not to widen them. May my poor endeavors contribute the
least to so a happy a Work, I shall acknowledge it an abundant recompense for
whatever I am able to do, or am subject to suffer. In the desire and hopes
whereof I shall quietly wait, and rest

THE SAD SCHISM OF New Separation IN Old ENGLAND.
1 COR. 1. 10. Now I beseech you Brethren by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no Divisions (no Schisms)
among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in
the same judgment.


HAving read this Text, Introduction.
me thinks, I could now deal with it, as Origin is said once to have dealt with
a Text which he met with at Jerusalem. Being there over-entreated to Preach,
opening his Bible, he fell with that of the Psalmist, Psalm. 50. 16. Unto the
wicked God says, what have thou to do to take my words into thy mouth, etc.
Seeing thou hate to be reformed. Having read the words, and being conscious
to himself of what he had formerly done in offering sacrifice to an Idol, and
so denying the Truth, he presently closes up the Book; and instead of
preaching, falls to weeping, all his auditory weeping with him. And truly even
thus (me thinks) could I deal with this Text which I have now read unto you.
Having read it, I could even close the Book, and instead of preaching upon it,
sit down and weep over it, inviting you to accompany me, considering how far we
in this Kingdom, nay in this place at the present are, from what is here
desired. What? All speak the same thing? No divisions? A perfect union in the
same mind and judgment? Alas! nothing less. What multiplicity of divisions
are here to be found? Tongues divided: Hearts divided: Heads divided: Hands
divided: State divided: Church divided: Cities divided: Towns divided: Families
divided: the nearest Relations divided: Scarce a field to be found where the
Envious man has not sown some, and many of these Tares. Just matter for all
our mourning. But I remember what the Lord once said to Josh^a, being fallen upon
his face, weeping and lamenting over that unexpected repulse which a party of
his Army (till then reputed invincible) had met withal at Ai. Josh. 7. 10. 13.
Get thee up (says the Lord) wherefore lie thou thus upon thy face? Up,
sanctify the people, etc. Josh. 7. Brethren, it is not weeping and lamenting;
without further endeavors, that will heal our distempers. Somewhat else must be
done. And the Lord teach every of us in our places to do that which may be most
proper for this end. For my self, seeing God here by his providence in this
juncture of time puts a Talent into my hand, I shall endeavor to improve it
as I am able; though happily therein I may disappoint the hopes of some, and
the fears of other, in not handling this subject in such a way as either of
them made account of.

To close with the words. Divisions.
Therein we have a grave, but earnest Obtestation, or Request; an Obsecratory
Charge directed by Paul to his Corinthians; wherein we may take notice of two
things. The Manner; the Matter. The Manner of propounding; which is by way of
Obtestation, in an Obsecratory, Supplicatory way, entreating, beseeching, [ Now
I beseech you Brethren] which also he does with a great deal of sweetness, and
a great deal of earnestness. Sweetness, in the Comp^^lation. [I beseech you
Brethren] Earnestness. in the Adjuration. [I beseech you Brethren, by the Name
of our Lord Jesus Christ.] The Matter propounded and pressed, is in one word
Unity. Touching which we have here a Dehortation, and an Exhortation. The
former dehorting from what is contrary to it. [ Let there be no divisions among
you.] The latter exhorting to what makes for it, viz. Agreement in Language,
Mind, Judgment. [That ye all speak the same thing, and that ye be perfectly
joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.] In this method
(God assisting) I shall handle the words: Beginning with the Manner of
proposal, of which as briefly as I may.

Now I beseech you Brethren, Paul's affection insinuated. Huic morb^
exulceratis^imo primu^ malag^^ata quaedam adhibet. Pareus, ad Loc.
etc.] An Introduction full of affection, fall of sweetness. Thus the Apostle
here, (like a skilful, but tender and wary Surgeon, who being to lance an
Impostume, a tumor in the body, he first supples, and ripens it, and draws it
to a head, by mollifying Playsters and Pultesses, before he make an Incision)
intending to deal sharply with these his Corinthians in reproving of their
errors, he first applies himself to them in a mild and gentle way. Being to
come to them with the Rod, he first comes in the spirit of meekness;
lightning before he thunders, entreating before he chides.

Thus Nails dipped in Oil, Observe.
they drive the easier. Affectionate insinuations, and declarations, A fit
preparative for sharp Reproofs.
are apt and proper preparatives for tart reprehensions. The Smith first heats
his Iron, then strikes upon it. The Ministers of God in public, Christians in
private being to reprove others, let them do it with all tenderness, and
demonstration of hearty affection that may be. By this means, their words will
take place the better. But this by the way.

Come we nearer the words, wherein (if we will resolve them) we shall find
couched a threefold Argument made use of by the Apostle, A threefold Argument
here couched. Each considered first simply.
for the letting in of this his charge. The first, in the Observation [I
beseech you.] The second in the Compellation [I beseech you Brethren.] The
third in the Adjuration [I beseech you Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.] These three I shall take up severally, looking upon each in a double
aspect: First, Simply in themselves; then Relatively in reference to the thing
here desired.

I beseech you] So the word ((...)) is here most fitly rendered by precor, 1.
obsecro, I entreat, I beseech you: rather then by Exhortor, I exhort you, The
Obsecration. Estius ad loc.
as elsewhere it signifies.

A language which (as Peter Martyr here notes upon it) is seldom or never to be
found amongst the Prophets. Obs.
They Exhort, Dehort, Command, P. Mart. Com. ad loc. A language peculiar to the
New Testament.
Threaten, and sometimes Promise, but seldom or never entreat, never beseech.
Such language we meet not with in the Old Testament; but in the New Testament
it is frequent, specially in the mouth of this Apostle. Now I beseech you
Brethren, Romans 12. 1. We entreat you be ye reconciled, 2 Cor. 5. 20. I beseech
Euodias, I beseech Syntiche, Phil. 4. 2. Thus speaks Paul not only to whole
Churches, but even to particular persons, dealing with them in an obsecratory,
supplicatory way, entreating, beseeching what as an Apostle he might have
enjoined, Ph^l. v. 8, 9.
commanded. So he tells Philemon, Verse 8, 9. of his Epistle, Though I might be
much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient; yet for love sake,
I rather beseech thee. I bese^ch thee for my son One simus, etc. Paul might as
an Apostle have enjoined things convenient, much more then things necessary;
yet such is his sweetness, that often times laying aside his Imperative
Authority, he falls to entreating, beseeching.

Such sweetness is there in the Gospel above what was in the Law. Obs.
In the Law God commands, The sweetness of the Gospel above the Law.
forbids. Thou shall; thou shall not. That is, the Language of Mount Sinai;
the Language of the Law. But in the Gospel it is otherwise. Here God himself,
as it were beseeches men. As if God did beseech you by us, says the Apostle,
2 Cor. 5. 20.

And does God stoop to do it, Applicat.
much more may man. The Ministers of the Gospel they are not Lords over Gods
heritage, What language Ministers are to use to their people. They may command.
2 These. 3. 6
they are but fellow servants with their Brethren, (as the Angel tells John,
Revel. 19.) And being so, for them to use entreaties, can be no disparagement.

Not, but that they may sometimes make use of other Language. Paul who here
entreats his Corinthians, elsewhere he commands his Thessalonians. Now we
command you Brethren, etc. 2 These. 3. And what himself does, he bids Timothy
do. These things command and teach, 1 Timothy 4. 11.
1 Timothy 4. This may the Ministers of Christ do. What they teach, they may also
command. Only in the Name of Christ. So Paul there qualifies his command. Now
we command you in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Not in his own name. To
the married I command, yet not I, 1 Cor. 7. 10.
but the Lord, 1 Cor. 7. Officers speak not in their own names. If they do,
their commands are nothing worth. Shall the Ministers of Christ impose ought
upon the Church in their own names (as some of late have done) their commands
may as well (it may be better) be rejected, as obeyed. But speaking in the Name
of Christ, now they may not only entreat, but command. I, and where occasion
is, And Rebuke. 2 Timothy 4. 2 Cum auctoritate summa tanquam Dei Legatu^. Beza ad
Loc.
rebuke. Preach the Word, be instant in season, and out of season, Reprove,
Rehuke, 2 Timothy 4. Rebuke, and that if need be, sharply. So Paul wills Titus
to deal with false Teachers, Tit. 1. 13. Rebuke them sharply. This the
Ministers of Christ upon occasion may do, and that with all authority, as Paul
bids Titus to do, Tit. 2. 15. (...), Cum omni Imperio; viz. As Ambassadors of
Jesus Christ, having authority from their Master to do it in his Name. Such
Language the Ministers of God sometimes may use: Not always entreat, not
always beseech.

Yet, But sometimes beseech.
this sometimes they may do, must do, where there is any hope of prevailing for
God in this way, they must not think much to fall upon their knees (as it were)
and to become supplyants unto their people, begging that from them, which
otherwise they might in the Name of Christ command. So does the Apostle here.
Now I beseech you.]

Brethren] There is ^^e Compellation [Brethren.] 2.
A word very frequent in Paul's mouth. The Compellation.
Almost in every Chapter of every Epistle, upon all occasions, still, this is
his Language, Brethren, Brethren. To let pass the proper signification of the
word, which is well enough known. Brethren, such are all men by nature. Whence
are ye my Brethren? says Jacob to the men of Haran, Genesis 29. 4.
Genesis 29. All partaking of the same common nature, issuing from the same Womb,
having the same first parents. Such are Christians by Grace. All that profess
the Faith of Christ, holding the same God for their Father, and the same Church
for their Mother; they are Brethren; and so were these Corinthians in reference
both to Paul, and one to another. Brethren.]

A word full of sweetness, Brethren a word full of affection.
breathing forth more then ordinary affection and love. So the servants of
Benahad apprehended it, when they heard that word fall from Ahabs mouth
concerning their master, He is my Brother; 1 King. 20. 32, 33.
they presently take it up as a word importing more then ordinary respect, and
thereupon (echo like) return it back to him again, Thy Brother Benhadad.

Such Affections should all true Christians bear one to another. Obs.
Look upon one another as Brethren, Christians should look upon each other as
Brethren. Loving as Brethren. 1 Ioh. 3. 18. 1 Pet. 3. 8. Performing Brotherly
offices each to other.
not as strangers, as the guise of these dividing times is: but as Brethren.
And that not only calling one another so, but really acknowledging one another
such. Loving not in word, neither in tongue (as Saint John presses it) but in
deed and in truth: That is, to love as Brethren, as Saint Peter urges it, 1
Pet. 3. Love as Brethren. Such should the Church of God be, a true
Philadelphia, where all the Members should be (...), Lovers of the Brethren,
and loving as Brethren. Withal, expressing their love by a ready performance
of all brotherly offices each to other. Under the Law there was a brand of
Ignominy set upon the Brother which refused to build up his brothers house, by
raising up issue to him for the upholding of his family. Deuteronomy. 25.
The Law was that, beside spitting in his face, he should have his shoe pulled
off; and so was ever after called (as the Rabines tell us) The man that had his
shoe pulled off. Vid. Aynsworth ad loc.
The meaning of which Ceremony was to show how worthy he was accounted and
adjudged to go barefoot himself, that would not do the office of a Brother to
his Brother. An ignominious and infamous thing it is for Brethren by nature,
not to be ready to brotherly offices; much more for Brethren by grace.
Christians, in the fear of God remember your relation, and let it be your care,
and end^^vour to answer it. Expressing Brotherly affection to such as are your
Brethren; specially to such as are so indeed, not only before men, but before
God: such as in whom the Image of your heavenly father is conspicuous. To such
show your selves Brethren indeed, helping, comforting, succouring, releeving of
them: stepping in to them in their necessi^ies. For such a time a Brother is
born. Prove. 17. 17.
A Brother is born for adversity (says the Wiseman.) Then to be helpful is the
part of a Brother indeed. Thus should Christians in general stand affected each
to other.

And thus should the Ministers of the Gospel in special stand affected toward
their people, Obs.
looking upon them as Brethren, bearing and expressing Brotherly affection unto
them. Ministers must look upon their people as Brethren. Though not deserving
so to be accounted
I, notwithstanding they be such as in respect of personal wrongs and injuries,
deserve nothing less. That was Paul's case here in the Tex^. Some of these
Corinthians dealt very unkindely and unworthily by him. Notwithstanding God had
made him to them their Father in Christ, to whom they were as truly beholding
for their spiritual, as ever they were to their parents for their natural
generation. So much himself puts them in mind of 1 Cor. 1 Cor. 4. 15.
4. Though you have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many
fathers: For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel. Yet for
all this, some of them would not now so much as own him, nor his Ministry: no,
they were of Apollos, they were of Cephas. Paul was now no body with them, now
they had gotten to themselves new Teachers. An unkind requital for all the
pains he had spent upon them. Yet for all this, see how Paul still bears his
old affection unto them: though they were changed, yet he was the same: though
they would not own him, yet he will own them, Appl^c.
and that as Brethren. Now I beseech you Brethren.]

A pattern for the Ministers of the Gospel in these dividing times, A pattern for
Ministers in these dividing times.
wherein some possibly may meet with the very like measure that Paul here did.
They have bestowed their pains upon a people, and God has blessed their
labors amongst them, making them instrumental in converting of some, and
building up of others of them: yet now, meeting with new Teachers, the old are
despised in their eyes, their Ministry slighted, their persons dis regarded,
if not un-Christianly traduced. An ill requital it must be confessed: But what
of this? Still look we upon them as Brethren; specially apprehending the work
of grace truly wrought in them, let not all this unkindness make an
alienation of affection from them: still love them. I, though it do fall out
with us, as Paul complains of, and to these his Corinthi^ns, 2 Cor. 2 Cor. 12.
15.
12. Though the more abundantly we love them, the less we be beloved of them;
yet be we content and willing to spend, and to be spent for their sakes, (...),
for their souls (as the Original there has it.) In so doing we have the
Apostle for a pattern. N^y, herein we have God himself for a pattern. The people
of the Jews how did they requite the Lord, Isai. 1. 2.
for all his fatherly mercies which he had shown to them? Here himself
expressing it in that Pathetical complaint, Isai. 1. 2. Hear O Heavens, and
give ear O Earth, for the Lord has spoken; I have nourished and brought up
children, but they have rebelled against me. For children thus to requite their
parents, is an unnatural thing; much more for a people thus to requite their
God. Yet for all this, still God tenders that people, owns them as his people,
and it ready to do any thing for them that might tend to their good. Hoses 6. 4.
O Ephrain^, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? Is
it so that the Ministers of God meet with the like measure from a people, whom
God has made them instruments to beget, and bring up to and for himself, yet
let them tender them, still bear them good will, still with Paul here, look
upon them as Brethren. This do we.

And this do you. How Christians should stand affected toward their separating
Brethren.
Your Brethren, however by their unkind withdrawing themselves from religious
communion with you, they may seem worthy to be unbrothered, yet still
acknowledge that relation, and though they will not own you, yet do you own
them: still looking upon them as Brethren. So did Joseph upon his unkind
Brethren, who had cast him into the pit, and sold him into Egypt, yet still he
looks upon them as Brethren, his bowels yerned over them, and as occasion
was, Genesis 45.
his hand was enlarged toward them in the supply of their wants: thus stand
you affected to your unkind Brethren of the Separation. Suppose by their
uncharitable censures they should cast you into the pit, excluding you from
their communion, and send you to Egypt, to Rome, as some of them have done by
their rash and un-Christian censures past upon the Church of England, and the
Members of it; yet, still let your bowels yern over them, and be ready upon all
occasions to do all good offices to them: Ipsum fraternitatis nomen, utcunque
Donatistis fastidiosum est, tamen Orthodoxis erga ipsos Donatistas necessarium.
Optat. lib. 3.
Looking upon those of that way, and dealing with them as Brethren. Brethren of
the Separation. That was the style of the last age which our fathers gave un^o
theirs, and let not us grutch it their children. So call them, so own them (I
mean such of them, as in whom the Image of God appears). Such still they are,
or may be, to u^, even as Joseph's Brethren were to him, Brethren by the Fathers
side, though not by the Mothers: though they will not acknowledge the same
Church for their Mother, yet they acknowledge the same God for their Father;
and in that respect, let us yet look upon them as Brethren. I beseech you
Brethrer.]

By the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.] 3. The Adjuration. Eos per nomen
Christi adjurat ut quantum ipsum amant tantum studcant concordiae. Calvin ad
loc. The name of Jesus, what. Estius Com. ad loc.
There is the Apostles Adjuration; so I may not amiss call it: For what is an
Adjuration, but the requiring or commanding of a thing, by interposing the Name
and Authority of God or Christ? And thus does Paul here back his Obtestation or
charge, by the sacred Name of the Lord Jesus.

The name of Jesus Christ is the same with Christ himself. I know some Romish
Expositors would make more of it; placing a great deal of weight in the very
name it self. In obtestationibus etiam nomina ponderantur, (says the Jesuit
Estius upon it.) In obtestations, requests and charges of this nature, names
themselves have their weight.

Thus amongst the Jews (says he) they had ever a special regard to that nomen
Dei tetragrammaton, that four-lettered name of God (as they called it) viz.
Jehovah. The name it self was sacred unto them, and consequently they took it
as the most solemn Obligation which was bound with it. And of such account
(says he) should the name [ Iesus] be unto Christians. Nomen sacrosanctum and
super omnia venerabile, a sacred name, and a name above every name. And
therefore Paul in his Obtestation (says he) here makes use of that name as
presuming it would carry a great deal of sway with them. But this we decline as
smelling too much of the Jesuit, Who by advancing the name [ Jesus] above all
other names, thinks also to advance (...) is own Order above all other Orders.
Leaving them the shell, seek we for the Kernel.

To beseech by the Name of Jesus Christ here, is no more but to beseech for
Christ's sake, or by Authority from Christ. Take it either way, we shall find
it a prevalent Argument. 1. For Christ's sake.


1. For Christ's sake. For the love of Jesus Christ; so Calvin explains it. A
prevalent Argument.
Quantum ipsum amant. As you love Jesus Christ, as you bear any true respect
unto him. And can there be a more forcible persuasive to a Christian then this?
Paul himself having felt the working of this love in his own Breast, he found a
compulsory force in it. The love of Christ (says he) constrains us. 2 Cor.
5. 14.
And hereupon he makes use of it as an Argument to others, as conceiving that
if this would not prevail with them, nothing would. And surely so it is. Where
the Name of Christ, love to Christ, respect unto Christ, unto his Honor and
Glory, will not prevail with Christians, there is little hope of prevailing.
The name of Christ, it should be dear and precious to every Christian, a thing
always in his eye. Like the Pole Star to the Mariner, which way soever he
stears, yet he has an eye to that. Thus in what ever a Christian undertaketh
he should have a respect to this name. Col. 3. 17.
So Paul presses it upon his Colossians, Col. 3. Whatsoever ye do in word or
deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus. viz. With a respect unto him, in
reference to his Honor and Glory. What ever may tend that way, that do we. What
ever is dishonorable to Jesus Christ, that avoid.

2. 2. By Authority from Christ.
Or (secondly) By the name of Jesus Christ, that is, by Authority from Jesus
Christ. Thus Officers speak, and act not in their own, but in their Masters
name, the Kings name, by Authority from him. And thus the Ministers of Christ
being Church Officers, what they say or do to the Church, 2 Cor. 5. 20
it must not be in their own name, but in the name of Jesus Christ. In his name
they must Preach, as Ambassadors for Christ. 1 Cor. 5. 4.
In his name dispense Sacraments and Censures. In the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, when ye are gathered together in the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
deliver such a one unto Satan: So Paul would have his Corinthians deal with
that scandalous person. And so himself here deals with them, The Arguments
looked upon in reference to Churchunity.
not in his own name, but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I beseech you
Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.]

Thus have I cast a glance upon the words severally, and simply considered,
finding somewhat in each branch not unuseful. Give me leave now, before I part
with them, to reflect upon them again; looking upon them as they stand in
reference to the thing here so much desired by the Apostle from these his
Corinthians: Obser.
Which is, Unity, Peace, Church-Peace, Churchunity a thing of high concrnment.
and agreement amongst themselves.

A thing certainly of very great consequence, of high concernment to the
Church. Otherwise (questionless) Paul would never have laid so much weight
upon it, never have put so much strength to his r^qu^st and charge concerning
it. Wise men do not use to entreat for trifles: Much less to beseech, Solent
aut^^ prudentes viri non nisi in rebus gravis^tmis a^hibere obtestationes
scrias. Aret. ad loc.
and that with such earnestness. It is Aretius his note upon the Text, and it
is a good one. Wise men (says he) will not make use of such serious
obtestations (much less of Adjurations) except it be in matters of great
importance and weight. Now if this be a truth (as undoubtedly it is, and I wish
it may be so looked upon by those who are so ready upon every slight and
trivial occasion, to break out into such deep and solemn protestations, not
sparing to make use of the name of God to bind them; surely this cannot be the
part of wise men, much less of wise Christians) then certainly there is scarce
any one thing of greater concernment unto Christians then this. A Pearl in
Paul's eye.
Sure I am, there is no one thing that Paul does (nor I think any man can) more
earnestly make suit for, then he does for this. Witness but that one
Rhetorical and Pathetical Obsecration, and Adjuration of his, Phil. 2. 1, 2.
which we meet with Phil. 2. 1. If therefore there be any consolations in
Christ, if any comfort of Love, any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and
mer^i^s. Did you ever hear more earnestness in any cause? And what is the
matter? The next Verse will inform it. Fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like
minded, having the same love, etc. Let it be so in ours.
Such a Pearl was Church-Peace in Paul's eye. O that it were so in ours, and our
Brethrens.

That it may be so to us, To that end consider.
give way to that threefold Argument which the Apostle here makes use of in
handing this request to these his Corinthians.

1. 1. The Apostles Obsecration.
Let his Obsecration, his Supplication move us. [ I beseech y^^]. Surely (as I
said) it is not a trifle that brings a man of Paul's spirit to his knees: It is
not for nothing, nor yet for a small matter, that so great an Apostle should
here become a suppliant to the Church of Corinth, begging this at their hands,
that they would be at unity amongst themselves. Let this make us think the more
of it, and set more by it then we have done.

2. 2. His Compellation.
(secondly) if this Obsecration move us not, yet let this Compellation prevail
with us. [ I beseech you Brethren]. It was Moses his Argument which he made use
of to the two Hebrew Combatants, Sirs, ye are Brethren, why do ye wrong one
another. So Stephen relates the story, Acts 7. 26.
Acts 7. And the same argument Abraham had made use of before him, in composing
the difference betwixt his Kinsman Lot and himself, Genesis 13. 8.
and their Herdmen. Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee,
etc. for we be Brethren, Genesis 13. Christians are Brethren. And if so, why do we
fall out? Why do we not speak the same thing? Why are not we joined togeth^^ in
the same mind, and in the same judgment? Why do any amongst us breed and
foment divisions, by separating and withdrawing themselves, both from public
and private communion with those whom yet they dare not but call Brethren? If
Brethren, then let us live together, and love together as Brethren. So live.
Brethren in their Fathers house do not use to part Tables: For Christians to
withdraw Religion, Communion with their Brethren, to set up table against
table, is a most unbrotherly part. Heb. 13. 1. Cum consensu deponi videtur
fraternitas. Aret. ad loc.
And so living, so love, even as Brethren. Let brotherly love continue. So the
Apostle presses it, Heb. 13. To lay down holy unity and agreement, is to lay
aside fraternity. I beseech you Brethren.

3. But in the third place. If neither of these will take place, yet let this
Religious Adjuration prevail with us. I beseech you Brethren by the name o^ our
Lord Jesus Christ. Here is a Cord of many Strands, strong enough one would
think to bind us to the peace. 3. His Adjuration containing many Argum^^ts
pressing the c^re of Churchunity.
Scarce a word, but we shall find a several Argument couched in it.

1. By the [ Name] of Jesus Christ. Have we any love to Jesus Christ, any
regard to his Authority, any respect to his Honor and Glory? endeavor we after
unity. It is a thing wherein the name of Christ is much interessed and
concerned, in point of honor, or dishonor. In the holy unity and agreement of
Christians, the name of Christ is honored. In their divisions and dissensions
it is as much dishonored. By the name of Christ then be we entreated, Argu. 1.
nay, adjured to seek after peace.

2. Argu. 2.
By the name of [ our Lord] A Lord, and our Lord. Being so, what he commands we
are bound in duty to obey, and observe. Now amongst other his precepts to his
Disciples, Mar 9. last.
this is one. Have salt in your selves, and have peace one with another.
Besides, being our Lord, we are now fellow servants; and consequently for us to
fall out, it cannot be without dishonor to our Lord, and disturbance to his
House. Therefore endeavor we to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace, Ephesians. 4. 3, 5.
in as much as we have one Lord; so the Apostle presses it, Ephesians. 4.

3. Argu. 3. Aret. ad loc.
Our Lord [Jesus]. There is yet more. Jesus, a Savior, our Savior. And being
so, he does only salubria suadere, persuade and command nothing but what is
safe for us to observe and obey. Withal, as a Savior, amongst other benefits,
he has procured this for one, even Peace. Ephesians. 2. 14.
He is our Peace, (says the Apostle) Ephesians. 2. viz. The Author of our Peace,
as betwixt God and us, so betwixt one another.

4. Argu. 4.
Lastly, Our Lord Jesus [Christ]. One anointed by God his Father, to be a
Prophet, Priest, King, unto his Church. Now as a Prophet he has taught, Verse
17.
and does teach us peace. He came and preached peace (says the Apostle). This
he did in his own person. This he has done by his Apostles. Isai. 52. 7.
This he does by his Ministers, all which are or should be as Messengers and
Ambassadors of peace. As a Priest, by the offering up of himself he has
purchased peace, breaking down that (...), Ephesians 2. 14.
that middle wall of separation, taking away the ground of division which was
betwixt Jews and Gentiles, that so he might make both one. And shall we go
about to set up what he has pulled down, to set up walls of partition and
separation amongst our selves? As a King, he is the King of Peace, the true
Solomon, Pacificus, the Peacemaker (as the word signifies,) the Prince of
Peace, Isaiah 9. 6.
Isai. 9. Who governs his subjects in peace, having made Laws to bind them to
the peace, putting his Spirit into them, which is a Spirit of Peace.

Now put these together, here are Arguments enough. Et quae non prosunt singula
--. If any one of these should not be sufficient, yet (me thi^ks) all together
should be superabundant to persuade us to yield to what the Apostle here so
earnestly presses. Which what it is, will more fully appear in the sequel,
wherein we have the matter of this his request, or charge.

Therein (according to the method propounded) I shall look first upon the
Dehortation, (...). Are^. ad loc. Quod secundo loco posuit, ordine primum est:
ut scilicet caveamus dissidia, Calvin ad loc. The Dehortation. Schism, the word
expounded. Schisma est proprie corporis solidi sectio qualis in lignorum
fissura, Aretius Problem. de Schismate. (...) Scapula ex Xenop. and Plat.
then upon the Exhortation. Begin with the former.

I beseech you, etc. That there be no divisions among you.] Here is the
substance of what he dehorts from, in one word, Divisions. (...) (says the
Original) Schisms. For the opening of which, give me leave to look first upon
the word, then upon the thing.

For the word [ Schism]. The learned know the root whence it springs to be the
Greek (...), which signifies scindere or lacerare, to cut or rend. To cut or
cleave, or rive, as wood is cloven or riven. That (say some) is the proper
signification of the word. Or to rend as a garment is rent. So then, Schisma, a
Schism, is the same with Scissura, a violent division and rent. So our Savior
uses the word Matthew. 9. 16. where speaking of the putting of a new piece of
Cloth to an old Garment, he says, that thereby the rent is made worse. The
word in the Original is the same with that in the Text. (...), the Schism. Here
is the proper signification of the word. By a Metaphor it is translated from
inanimate things unto men, and applied to their divisions; which we know are
either Civil or Ecclesiastical. Civil in the State, Luke 23. 25
Ecclesiastical in the Church. The former of these is properly called (...),
Schism, a word peculiar to the New Testament. Chamer. lib. de Ecclesia, c. de
Schismate.
Sedition; the latter (...), Schism.

A word (as the Learned Chameron notes upon it) not to be met with in any
profane Writer, nor yet in the Old Testament. True, the root from whence it is
derived, is found in both, and used in this sense. Thus we read of the rending
of the Kingdom of Israel, which was done in that seditious falling off of the
ten Tribes from the House of David. And so men of different opinions are said
to be rent a sunder. But the word it self [ Schism] it is peculiar to the New
Testament, 1 Kings 11. 11, 12.
from whence Ecclesiastical Writers have taken it, and appropriated it to the
Church, Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgu^. Jure quodam Ecclesiae
facta sunt Ecclesiastica. Cham. ubi supra. Schism, the thing explained.
and the affairs thereof. So they have dealt by some other words, as
Sacramentum, Idolum, Haeresis, Sacrament, Idol, Heresy. Ecclesiastical Writers
have appropriated them to the Church, affixing a peculiar sense and
signification to every of them. And so is it with this word Schism, an
Ecclesiastical, or Techno-Logical term (as they call it) a term of Art. This
for the word.

For the thing. A Schism (take it in the latitude of it) is any division in the
Church. When the unity of the Church is (as it were) rent and torn by any kind
of divisions. The Church (we must know) is to be considered as one entire body,
having many members, whereof Christ is the head. Now where that unity is
broknn, that body (as it were) rent and torn by the divisions and disagreements
of the Members, there is said to be a Schism. Even as it is in the natural
body; where the Members do not agree to perform mutual offices each to other,
there, 1 Cor. 12. 25.
in Paul's Language, is a Schism in the body; so you have it, 1 Cor. 12. So is
it in this mystical body, the Church. The divisions of the Members make a
Schism in the Body, a Schism in the Church.

Now this division amongst Church Members (I beseech you follow me close a
little, Church-divisions in opinion or practice.
least I loose you) it may be either in Opinion or Practice. And each in a
large acceptance of the word may be called Schism. Ioh. 7. 43.
Division in Opinion. Of such a Division we read, Joh. 7. There was a Division
among the people; a Schism, (says the Original). And what was it about? Why
about Christ himself, viz. What he was, and whence he was.

But more properly divisions in practice are notified by this name of Schism.
The latter properly Schism.
As for the former of these, it is properly called Heresy, the latter Schism.
Which two, how ever they are sometimes indifferently used, 1 Cor. 11. 18, 19.
and put the one for the other. (So they are 1 Cor. 11. 18. l hear that there
are Divisions [Schisms] among you; For there must be al^o Heresies among you.
Schisms and Heresies used in the same sent.) Yet ordinarily and in proper
acceptance they are distinguished.

About the distinguishing of them, Heresy and Schism how distinguished.
Schisma est congregationis dissidiu^ ex diversitate sententiarum. Haeresis vero
Schisma inveteratu^. August. contra Crescon. Grammat. Inter Haeresin and
Schisma hoc interesse arbitramur, quod Haeresis perversum dogma habet, Schisma
ab Ecclesia separat. Hieron. in Epist. ad Galat. Aquin. 22. q. 39. Calvin
Instit. lib. 4. c. 2. s. 5. The Schisms in the Text, chiefly Divisions in
practice, which are either Without Separation,
we find some difference amongst the Ancients. Augustine conceived the
difference to lie only in the continuance. As if the one were a recent and
new, the other an old and inveterate division. But Jerome more rightly. Heresy
(says he) is properly a perverse opinion; Schism is a perverse Separation. The
one a Doctrinal, the other a Practical Error. The one opposite to Faith, the
other to Charity. These are the two bonds and ligaments by which the Church is
united, and knit together. By the one ( viz. by Faith) all the Members are
united unto the head. By the other, ( viz. by Charity) they are united one to
another. Now the breaking of the first of these bands, is Heresy, the latter
Schism. Thus they are distinct, the one from the other. So as a man may be the
one, and not the other. A man may be an Heretic denying some Article of the
Faith; and yet not a Schismatic in as much as he may still keep communion with
a Church which does profess the true Faith. And on the other hand, a man may
be a Schismatic, forsaking communion with a true Church, and yet not be an
Heretic, in as much as he may rightly believe all the Articles of the Faith.
Distinct they are. Yet so as they are near a kin, and the one making way to the
other. Heresy makes way for Schism, and Schism makes way for Heresy; the
one for the most part falling into the other.

But not to detain you here. The Schisms which we meet with in the Text, import
chiefly divisions in practice. Such were these divisions amongst the
Corinthians. In Doctrinals, they were for the most part agreed. In Practicals
they differed.

Now these Divisions (to follow the point home to the head) they may be either
without Separation, or with it. Without Separation from the Church; when men
holding communion with the same Church, yet divide themselves into parties,
siding, and banding, making head one against another, either in maintenance of
some opinion, or way, or in regard of their Teachers. Such were the Sects of
the Pharisees, and S^duces, and Essens, amongst the Jews, who notwithstanding
that they did all hold communion with the same Church, yet they had several
opinions and ways, and about them they were divided into Sects and Factions.
And such were these Divisions amongst these Corinthians which the Apostle here
speaks of. Divided they were, but not wholly Separated. Divided about their
Teachers, some crying up one, some another, so siding, and making of parties,
yet all holding communion with the same Church. So much we may learn from the
Apostle, 1 Cor. 1. 18.
1 Cor. 11. 18. where he ^ells them, that when they came together in the
Church, there were Divisions amongst them. (...), Schisms, Factions, and
part-takings, tending to the breach of Charity, and disturbance of the Church.

Other Divisions there are which are with Separation. Or with Separation. Quia
autem haec scissio maxim perficitur and apparet in debita communioue
Ecclesiastica (...) recusanda^, idcirco illa separatio per appropriationem
singular^m recte vocatur Schisma. Ames. Cas. Consc. de Schismate.
When men shall withdraw themselves from fellowship and communion with a true
Church, so breaking themselves off from the Body. And this (says our judicious
Ames) by way of special appropriation, deserves most rightly to be called by
the name of Schism: In as much as Heresy in this Division is perfected and
brought to a head, as also most clearly manifested, and declared, viz. in
refusing of due Church Communion.

Which refusal may be either partial, Separation Partial, or Total. The latter
most properly a Schism. Separation from the Church-Catholike, Don^^ism. From a
particular Church, Separatism. Which is either Negative,
or total. Partial, in some particular Acts and Exercises, wherein a man cannot
(or at least conceives he cannot) communicate without sin. Total, a rejecting,
and renouncing of all Religious Communion. This latter all Divines look upon as
a Schism, and that most properly so called.

Which (again) may be either from the Church, or from a Church. From the Church
Catholic, the whole Church. That was properly Donatism (the direct Error of
the Seekers at this day): Or from a particular Church; and that is properly
Separatism. My eye is chiefly upon the latter of these.

Of which (to advance yet one step further, following the conduct of the
learned Chameron) there are two kinds, Secessio Negativa, Positiva. Cham. de
Eccles. cap. de Schism.
or rather two degrees. There is (to use his terms) a Negative, and a Positive
Separation. The former is simplex secessio, when one or more do quietly and
peaceably, withdraw themselves from communion with a Church, only enjoying
themselves and their consciences in a private way, not making a head against
that Church from which they are departed. The other, or Positive.
when persons so withdrawing, do consociate, and draw themselves into a
distinct and opposite body, setting up a Church against a Church: Exercising
the Worship, and Service of God, Administering the Ordinances, Word, Sacraments,
Censures apart in a separated body, and in a separated way. This is that which
Augustine, and other Divines after him (alluding to that act of King Ahaz's, 2
Kings 16. The highest kind of Schism. Altar adversus altar erexit. August.
de Donato lib. contra Crescon. Gram. Hoc est quod Schisma Autonomasticos
dicitur and (...). Cham. ubi supra.
in setting up an Altar of his own making, after the fashion of that which he
saw at Damascus, besides the Lords Altar) call the setting up of an Altar
against an Altar. And this it is (says that judicious Author) which in a
peculiar manner, and by way of eminency is, and deserves to be called by the
name of Schism.

And thus you see both the name and thing in measure opened unto you. What
Schisms are. viz. Church Divisions. Which if they be in Doctrine, are properly
Heresies; in Practice, Schisms. Which may be either without Separation, or with
it. The former are Sects and Factions; the latter more properly Schism. Which
consists in an unwarrantable separating and withdrawing from
Church Communion. Whether it be from the whole Church, which is Donatism; or
from a particular Church, which is Separatism: Which may be carried either in a
private way by a simple secession and withdrawing, or in a public and
open-way, by setting up a Church against a Church; the former a Negative, the
latter a Positive Schism.

Now these are the things which the Apostle here with so much earnestness and
importunacy diswades his Corinthians from. Reas.
And surely not without cause is it, Schism a great evil.
that he should be so zealous in this cause; as will appear, if we do but
rightly consider the nature of such Divisions, such Schisms, which are Evils,
and great Evils.

Evils. 1. An evil of Punishment: A great Judgment. Amos 6. 11.
Take it as you will, for the evil of punishment or sin. We shall find it true
in both:

1. Schism is an evil of Punishment, a Judgment, and that a great one. It is
one of the judgments which the Prophet Amos threatens against Israel, Amos 6.
Behold, the Lord commands (says he) and he will smite the great house with
Breaches, and the little house with Clests. That place Joramo applies and that
not unfitly to Here^^^s. and Schisms, which are as Br^a^hes and Clests in the
Church. A sad Judgment. Psalm. 60. 2.
Such are Divisions in the State. Heal the Breaches thereof for it shakes,
(says David, speaking of the Civil Commotions in his Kingdom). A judgment
which we all feel of, and groan under at this day. And such are Divisions in
the Church, a judgment, a sad and sore judgment. Such are the Ecclesiastical
Breaches in this Kingdom at this day. The Schisms and Divisions which are
broken in, and that amongst God own people: for my own part. I cannot but look
upon them as one of the blackest Clouds, one of the saddest judgments which
hang over the head of this Kingdom at this day: Of sad influence for the
present, and unless they be healed, of dangerous consequence for the future. A
great Judgment.

2. 2.
And (in the second place) a great sin. Such are heart divisions amongst a
people. A great sin. Hos. 10. 2.
They are both a judgment and a sin. Their heart is divided (says the Prophet
Hosea) now they shall be found faulty. Their heart is divided, or, He has
divided their heart, (as the Margin reads it). This had God done. In as much as
they had divided their hearts from God, God in his just judgment divided them
amongst themselves, taking away his spirit of peace, and communion from them,
giving them over to Seditions, and Fractions, which afterward proved the ruin
of their Kingdom. And being thus divided now, they were found faulty, guilty of
many and great evils. Such is Sedition in the State, and such is Schism in the
Church, each a^ evil, a Mother evil, an inlet to an Ocean of Evils.

We have to deal with the latter ( Schism) which is a sinful evil, and that no
small one. Schism^ ^^^prie dictu^ est (...) gravi^^^mu^*
Peccatum gravissimum. So our judicious Casuist determines it concerning Schism
properly so called. It is a most grievous sin. Musculus informs me of some, who
in point of sinfulness have compared it with H^resie, and others who have
aggravated it beyond it, Ames, C^^ Consc. de Schismat. Sunt quidi peccatum
Schismatis ad aeque^t peccato* H^^re^^s, sunt qui illud adhuc pra ist^
exaggerent, Musc. loc. Com. de Schism. Sacr^legium Schismatis vestr^ defen^^r^
non v^^c^is, Aug* contra (...) lib. 2. exp. ^.
as the greater evil of the two. Himself concludes it a sin of a high nature.
And therein all Divines agree with him.

Augustine that famous Doctor of the Church, disputing against the Donatists
about their Schism, (which was a Separation from the whole Church) he calls
it by the name of Sacrilege. Sacrilegi^m Schismatis. The Sacrilege of Schism:
Withal, not sparing to tell them that that Schism of theirs was a greater sin
then that which they took such high offense at, and which was the ground of
their Separation, because it was not so severely proceeded against as they
judged fitting, but some that were guilty of it, An ut dicere ceperam, graviora
sunt crimina Traditorum quam Schismaticorum? Aug. ibid.
were still admitted to intermeddle in the affairs of the Church, ( viz. The
sin of the Traditores (as they called them) such as in time of persecution had
through fear delivered up their Bibles to the Persecutors to be burnt). This
sin that judicious Father compares with their Schism. And to try which was
heaviest, he brings both to the balance of the Sanctuary: Where he finds this
out weighing that. So much he collects from the grievousnesse of the punishment
inflicted by God upon this sin above that I, or any other.

Three sins he takes notice of, each of which was grievously punished. The
first was the Israelites Idolatry in worshipping the Golden Calf, Exodus 22. The
second was a sin not much unlike to that of the Traditores, though for
circumstance far more heinous, viz. That foul act of King Jehoiakim in cutting
and burning the prophetical Roll, Iere. 36. 23
Jere. 36. The third was that Schismatical and Seditious attempt of Corah and
his company, rising up against Moses, and assaying to make a rent, a breach
amongst the people, by dividing, and separating themselves from the rest. All
three heinous sins, and each grievously punished. But none of them like the
last. The first, the Israelites Idolatry, was punished with the Sword. The
second, Jehoiakims contempt, was punished with Captivity: But the third, Corahs
Schism, with an unheard of judgment. Numb. 16. 31, 35.
The earth it self, as not able or not willing to bear so great an evil, that
cleaves asunder (one Division punished by another), and swallows up some of the
Authors of it; Fire from Heaven consuming the residue. Quis jam dubitaverit hoc
esse sceleratius commissum quod est gravius vindi^atum, Aug. ibid.
Never such a judgment do we read of in all the Scriptures executed up on any
sin as this. Now then (says he) Quis dubitaverit? Who can make any doubt but
that this was the more heinous sin, which was avenged with the more grievous
punishment? Whether so or more: Sure I am a grievous sin it is, and must needs
be so.

1. In as much as first it is opposite to so great a Grace as Charity is*
Charity the Queen of Graces. 1.
So Paul makes it, preferring it both before Faith and Hope. Schism opposite
to the great Grace of Charity. 1 Cor. 13. 13
Now abides Faith, Hope, and Charity, these three, (three prime Theological
virtues, most necessary to salvation), but the greatest of these is Charity. So
it is in some, in diverse respects, greater then Faith, I, then justifying
Faith, (for of that the Apostle there speaks, as appears by joining it with
Hope). As first, In regard of the Object, which is larger then the object of
Faith. Faith respects God only, but Charity both God and Man. Secondly, In
regard of the manner of working. Faith works Intra mittendo, by receiving and
letting in Christ and his benefits; but Charity Extramittendo, by giving out
the soul and what a man has, bestowing them upon God and man. Now Paul tells
us from the Lord Jesus, that it is more blessed to give, Acts 20. 35.
then to receive. Thirdly, In regard of duration and continuance. Faith and
Hope are Temporary, of use only in this life. Charity is for Eternity; not
only going to Heaven with the owner, but there receiving its full perfection.
Thus if Graces be weighed, in some respects Charity weighs down all. The
great Grace. And if so, then that evil which is directly opposite to this great
Grace, must needs be a great Evil: But so is Schism; being a breach of that
unity whereof Charity is the bond. Ephesians. 4. 3. Schisma vinculum pacis dirumpit,
Charitatem scil. Musc. l. c. de Schism.
Keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace, (says the Apostle). Now
what is that bond of Peace? Why, Charity. This is the bond whereby the Members
of the Church are united one to another. As they are united to Christ by Faith;
so one to another by Love. Now Schism breaks this bond, and consequently must
needs be a great evil.

2. 2.
And as it is opposite to Charity, so it is injurious to Christ, who seems by
this means to be (as it were) divided. So Paul urges it in the third Verse
after the Text. Schism injurious to Christ.
Is Christ divided? Using this as an Argument to induce his Corinthians to
eschew all such Divisions, and Schisms, 1 Cor. 1. 13.
in as much as Christ himself seems hereby to be parted, and torn in pieces.
The unity of his mystical body being hereby dissolved, and himself made the
head of two disagreeing bodies; which is dishonorable and monstrous to conceive
of him.

3. 3.
As it is injurious to the head, so to the body. As to Christ, so to the
Church. Schism injurious to the Church
And that many ways.

1. Shaming it. The Churches unity is her glory. My Dove, my undefiled is one,
Cant. 6. Now to break this unity, to divide the Spouse of Christ, 1.
as the Levites Concubine was, into many p^ices, what a shame is this? Shaming
it. Cant. 6. 9. Judges 19. 1 Cor. 11. 22.
A shame in special to the Church, from which this Separation is made. Paul
writing to his Corinthians of their excluding the poor from communicating with
them, he tells them, that herein they shamed them: (...). They shamed them
which had not as themselves had.

2. 2.
Despising, and contemning it. So Paul there again charge it. Or despise ye
the Church of God? Despising it.
Why, wherein did they despise it? Ibid.
This they did (^s by other ways, so) by their schimatical practices, dividing
themselves from their Brethren, making their Love Feasts, and the Sacrament it
self (both which were instituted and ordained for bands of Union) to be an
occasion of somenting their Divisions, viz. By celebrating them apart from
their Brethren. So the Apostle the^e taxes them, Verse 21.
Verse 21. In enting, every one takes before other his own Supper. (...),
praeoccupat. Each prevented other. This they did in their Love Feasts. And this
most probably they did in the Lords Supper it self (as Parcus conceives of it)
communicating apart, Ad^o divisi crant, ^t invicem communicare sacram caenam
non dig^are^tur. Singulae factiones id agebant ut alia aliam praeverteret.
Paulini, verbi gratia, primi venientes suam caenam celebrabant, non expectatis
Petrinis, Apollime is, etc.
each faction by it self: Those that were of Paul by themselves, and those
which were of Peter by themselves, and those which were of Apollo by
themselves: None of them staying for those which were of Christ (the best and
truest piece of the Church) nor yet one for another. But each seeking to
prevent other, that so they might communicate apart. This Paul calls here
their own Supper; in as much as they so made it, by appropriating it each to
themselves and their party, contrary to the Insti^ution of Christ. Christ had
instituted i^, that it should be (...) and (...) totius Ecclesiae, a Communion,
a Common Supper, wherein the whole Church should communicate together. But they
by their celebrating it in such a separated way, had made it their own Supper.
A ^oul perverting of the Ordinance. Not only an abusing, and corrupting of it,
but plainly a destroying of it. So Paul there tells them in down right words,
in the Verse foregoing. When ye come together into one place, this is not to
eat the Lords Supper. What then? Their own Supper. Of such dangerous
consequence is it to celebrate this Ordinance of God, the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, in a separated way. 1 Cor. 11. 20.
If Paul's judgment may be taken in the case, it is not only a corrupting, but
a perverting of the Ordinance. A celebrating not of the Lords Supper, To
celebrate the Sacrament in a separated way is a perverting of the Ordinance.
but of our own Supper.

Which who so do, what do they therein but despise and contemn the Church of
God? viz. That Church from which they so separate. Now this, if it be a true
Church, can be no small evil. To contemn and despi^^ a private Christian, by
shutting him out from desired communion, there being no just cause for it, is a
great evil. But to despise and contemn a Church, a true Church of Christ, by
shutting it ^ut from communion, and by separating from it, this is a far
greater.

3. 3. Disqueting it.
As the Church is hereby despised, so it is disquieted. Even as it is in the
natural body, if there be a solutio continui (as the Physicians call it), so as
it be divided and parted, it breeds smart and pain, which sometimes puts the
body into Feverish distempers. And surely such are the symptoms of Schism.
The mystical body cannot be rent and torn by Divisions, but it goes to the
heart of all the sensible Members of it: Judge. 5. 25.
The Divisions of Reuben were great thoughts of heart, Judges 5. Reuben
dwelling on the other side Jordan, they kept themselves separate, not joining
with their Brethren against their enemies, but stood as neutral, regarding more
their own private then the public interest. And possibly they were divided
amongst themselves, distracted with several opinions what they should do. Some
would join, others would not. Now these Divisions they were great thoughts of
heart, working many strange impressions in the minds, both of themselves and
others; of very sad consequence to all the Tribes of Israel. And truly, such
are Divisions in the Church of God, specially when they are boy led up to
complete and perfect Schisms (as it is in the case of Separation, specially
when it comes to the setting up of Churches against Churches). O these are sad
thoughts of heart to the Israel of God; causing grief to the particular Members
of the Church, and great disquiet and disturbance to the whole Body. Oft-times
breeding those Feverish distempers, those un-Christian heats of hatred,
variance, emulation, wrath, strife, seditions, envyings, I, and murders too,
as the Apostle puts them together, Gal. 5. 20.
Gal. 5. These, all these are the fruits of Schism, by reason whereof there
cannot but follow a dreadful combustion in the Body of the Church tending to
the great trouble, and disquietment of it.

4. 4. Hindering it.
As the Church is hereby disquieted, so hindered. As disquieted in the peace,
so hindered in the edification of it. We know what it was which hindered the
building of Babel, even a Schism in their Tongues, Division of Languages. (What
do we think, a Schism in their hands would have done, if one should have saln
to pulling down what the other built up?) And surely, there is no one thing
that can more hinder the building of Jerusalem, the edification of the Church
then this, when Christians shall be divided in their heads, hearts, tongues,
hands; in their judgments, affections, language, practice. How should the work
of the Lord now go on? Even as it is in Civil Wars, whilst the parties are
contending, the Commonwealth suffers: So is it in Church-divisons, whilst the
parties are contending, the Church suffers. As it is with a Ship brought to the
back-staies, one Say^ bears the one way, and another an other, in the mean time
the Ship stands still. The Wall and Temple of Jerusalem went slowly on in
troublous times. So will Church Work do, where ever Schisms, and Factions break
it.

5. 5. Endangering it. Hoc consensu stat and subnixa est salus Ecclesiae,
Calvin in Text. Corpus Organicum non potest dissecari quin pariter and totum
and parts inter^ant. P. Mart. in Text. Schism dangerous to the person engaged
in it, being the way to Heresy.
Again (in the fifth place), as the Church is disquieted and hindered, so
endangered by it. As disquieted in the peace of it, and hindered in the
edification of it, so endangered in the state of it. The cutting off of one
member from the body is dangerous to the whole. What is the dismembring of a
Church? The withdrawing of communion with it, the breaking off of all
fellowship and communion with it by an actual and posi^ive Separation.
Certainly, this cannot but endanger the state of that Church, from which this
separation is made. Which if it live and continue, no thanks to them who have
thus withdrawn themselves, who by their separation have done what in them lies
to destroy it. Thus is Schism injurious to the Church of God.

To these I might add. It is also of dangerous consequence to the persons who
are involved in it; who by dividing themselves from the body, are in a
dangerous way to divide themselves from the head. So our judicious Casuist
lays it down. Schism makes way to Heresy, and so to Separation from Christ.
So Jerome observed it in his time. Nullum Schisma, etc. There is no Schism
(says he) but ordinarily in process of time it inventeth and broacheth some
Heresy, that so the Separation may seem to be the more justifiable. And
Aquinas seconds him, Sicut amissio charitatis, etc. Even as the losing of
Charity (says he) makes way for the losing of Faith, (pardon the error in
that supposition) so does Schism make way for Heresy. A truth sufficiently
experimented in those ancient Schismatics, Schisma viam facit ad Haeresin and
separationem a Christo. Ames. Cas. Consc. de Schism. Nullum Schisma non sibi
aliquam confingit Haeresin, ut recte ab E^clesia recessisse videatur, Hieron.
Com. in Tit. Sicut amissio Charitatis est via ad amittendam fidem, ita etiam
Schisma est via ad Haeresin. Aquin. 22. q. 39. ad 3.
the Novatians and Donatists, who from Schism fell to be the Authors or
Defenders of Heretical Opinions, and those some of them most dangerous. But we
shall not need to look so far back. We have a late and dreadful instance for it
in those pernicious Schismatics in New England, who falling foul with the
Churches, and despising the Ministry there, fell afterward into most
desperate, and damnable Heresies, and those so many and so foul, as I think no
place or age could ever parallel them. Neither shall we need to travel so far
for instances. Would to God we had not some even amongst our selves, who from
Schism are already advanced very far that way, even as far as may be on this
side Hell; nay, (if it were possible) a step beyond it, even to the jearing at
God himself. But I forbear to proceed any further.

You now see some of the streams which fall into this Ocean; some of the Evils
which contribute their malignity to the making up of the sinfulness of this
great Evil. Concerning which yet I may say that Lo the one half is not told
you. But let this suffice for Explication, Confirmation, Illust^ation. That
which remains is the Application.

Which I shall direct in Saint Paul's way, Applic. Let there be no Schisms
amongst us.
and words: Beseeching, nay, adjuring you in the Name of the Lord Jesus, that
there be no divisions, no Schisms among you in this place.

Quest. Why, but are there any such? Such there were in the Church of Corinth.
But are there any such among us that should give ground to such an Adjuration?
Quest.


Answ. Answ.
Yes; That there are say our Adversaries of Rome. You are all involved in a
Schism, Separation from Rome charged with Schism.
and that far more dangerous then any were to be sound in the Church of
Corinth. In as much as you have departed from the unity of the Church
Catholic, (the Donatists Schism). You have broken off, and separated your
selves both from the head, and body; in withdrawing due subjection to the
visible Ministerial head of the Church, the Vicar of Christ, and renouncing
communion with the body, the Roman Catholic Church.

Reply: Discharged.
In reply to this I shall not waste much time, it having been already done by
many more able Tongues and Pens. A departure we acknowledge, and a separation,
but not a Schism. However, not such a Schism as they charge us with, a sinful
Schism, a Schism properly so called.

Which that it may appear, give me leave yet a little more clearly, and
distinctly to show you what such a Schism, A complete Schism described.
a complete and formal Schism is. Will you have a Definition, at least a
Description of it? Take it thus. It is A voluntary, and unwarrantable
separation from a true Church. Wherein, you may take notice of four ingredients
to make up this compound.

There must be, Parts of the Description four.
first a Separation; secondly, a separation from a true Church; thirdly, a
voluntary; and fourthly, an unwarrantable Separation.

1. 1. Schism a Separation.
A Separation. So much the word (as I told you) imports. Schism, from the Greek
(...), or the Latin scindere, both signifying one and the same thing, to cut,
to rend, to tear, to divide in a violent way. Such is Schism. A formal Schism
is a Separation, a breaking off, viz. of Religious communion. Which first
presupposes an Union. Where there was no union, there can be no separation,
and consequently no Schism. Hence it is, that neither Turks nor Je^s stand
chargeable with Schism, in as much as they never were united to, nor held
communion with the Christian Church. Schism is a withdrawing and breaking off
of Church Communion. A going out from the Church, as Saint J^h^ phraseth it, 1
John 2. 19. They went out from us (says he) speaking of Antichrists,
Apostates, Heretics, Schismatics.

2. 2. A Separation from a true Church.
A separation from a true Church. So it must be, otherwise it cannot properly
be a Schism. A separation it may be, but not a Schism Schism is the cutting off
of a Member from a true Ecclesiastical body. A cutting off. Not a partial
withdrawing from communion in some corruptions incident to a true Church, which
being done in a quiet and peaceable way cannot be called Schism. But a total
withdrawing, a renouncing of all Church communion with such a Church.

3. 3. A voluntary Separation.
Which separation (in the third place) must be voluntary. Not necessitated, not
enforced, whether in a natural, or moral way. Where persons are unduly excluded
and cast out of the Church by an unjust censure of Excommunication; where they
are driven away by unsufferable persecution; or where they cannot hold
communion with a Church, but they must also have communion in their
Corruptions, their sins; here is no voluntary secession or departure. In these
cases the persons withdrawing, are fugati, not fugitivi, not separating, but
separated, and consequently are thereby freed from the guilt of Schism, which
must be a voluntary separation.

4. 4. Unwarrantable: Whether Secessio Injusta, T^meraria. Cham. de Schism.
And that (in the fourth place) unwarrantable. Unwarrantable either for the
ground or manner. The former an unjust; the latter a rash separation, each a
Schism.

1. Unjust. When there is no just ground for dislike or distaste. When there is
no persecution, no spreading Error or Heresy, no Idolatry, no Superstition
maintained or practiced; but the Church is peaceable, and pure, and that both
for Doctrine and Worship: And in a good measure free from scandals (which no
Church ever wholly was). Now in such a case to separate is an unjust
Separation. 1. Unjust: or Chamer. ib.
And such a Separation (as Chameron says of it) is extrema schismatis linea,
the very highest pitch and top of Schism.

2. 2. Rash; either
Rash. Which again may be in two cases:

1. Where a ground and cause is pretended, but it is but a light cause.
Possibly some slight opposition or persecution, it may be by some small
p^cuniary mulcts, 1. Upon a light cause.
or the like: some lesser Errors in doctrins, not fundamental, nor near the
foundation; some Corruptions in or about the worship of God, but those not
destructive to the Ordinances, being not in substance, but in ceremony; and
those such as the person offended is not enforced to be active in: Scandals
few, and those only tolerated, not allowed: All tolerable evils, such as
charity may well bear with. Now in this case to separate, it is a rash
separation, because it is upon a ground not sufficient, a light ground.

2. 2. Carried in an undue manner.
Where the separation is carried in an undue way and manner. Though the ground
of the separation be just; yet if it be sudden and headie, without due
endeavor, and expectance of Reformation in that Church, it may be a rash, and
consequently, an unwarrantable separation, in as much as it is opposite to
charity. So is an unjust separation: 1 Cor. 13. 6.
Charity (says the Apostle) does not rejoice in iniquity; (...), in
Injustice: and so is a rash separation; it being the nature of Charity to
suffer much and long. Much: Charity bears all things, Ibid. very.
indureth all things, (...) (says the Apostle in the same Chapter.) It bears
with the infirmities of others, it endures the burdens which are laid upon it
self, viz. if they be tolerable: for so the Apostle (...) must be restrained;
All things, that is, all things which are sufferable: and suffering much, it
suffers long. Ver 4.
(...), (says the fourth verse of that Chapter) Charity suffers long, it is
not presently distasted, so as to fly off upon every small and trivial
occasion; no, nor yet upon a just and weighty one, without first assaying all
possible means of remedy. So deals the wary and careful Surgeon with his
patient: not presently fall to dismembring upon every slight aylement; no,
though the part be ul^erated, yet so long as there is any hope, he forbeares
that extremity, reserving it for the last remedy. Even so deals Charity by
the Church: not presently separate and break off communion (which is the
dismembring of a Church) for some supposed errors or corruptions, no, though
really such: No, this (says Chameron) is not Chirurgia, Cha^^r. de Schi^^ate.
Epistle to M Williams.
but Carnificina; which Master Cotton in his Disswasive from separation
Englisheth rightly, applying it to the case in hand, Not Surgery, but Butchery.
Put these together, you see what Schism properly so called is.

Now then, Separation from Rome not such a Schism: because,
come we and bring our separation from the Church of Rome to this Beam, to
this Touchstone, and see whether it deserves the name of such a Schism or no.
A separation we confess and acknowledge; so far are we from denying of this,
as that we rather glory in it, standing to maintain and vindicate it from all
just imputation of Schism.

1. 1 Not from a true Church. Bish. Hall in his Reconciler.
In as much (first) as it is not a separation from a true Church. Let none here
be deceived and deluded with the ambiguity of a word: There is a twofold
trueness; Natural the one, Moral the other: In the former sense a cheater, a
theife may be said to be a true man, and a whore a true woman, and (till she
be divorced) a true wife; yea, and the Devil himself, though the Father of
lies, yet a true spirit. And in this sense, we shall not need to grutch the
Church of Rome the name of a true Church: if not so, why do we call her a
Church? A Church she is, in regard of the outward profession of Christianity;
but yet a false Church: true in existence, but false in belief. Those Divines
of ours who have indulged her the one, I say, She is a true Church: but I say
withal* she is a false Church, Bish. Hall ibid.
have yet still charged her with the other; with the same breath (it may be)
calling her both true and false; not one Protestant pen ever yet dissenting:
Such she was at that time when the Waldenses, Wickliffe, Luther separated from
her; a just ground and warrant for their separation. And such is she much more
since, specially since their last Council of Trent, being thereby so much the
more riveted into, and settled upon her old corruptions. So as now all that
Charity it self can afford her is, Field of the Church, in Append.
that which that acute Doctor of our Church has granted her; she may be vere
Ecclesia, but not vera Ecclesia; truly a Church, but not a true (much less
the true) Church: not so a true Church, but that she is also a false Church,
an Heretical, Apostaticall, Antichristian Synagogue.

Being so, here is now warrant enough for what we have done in separating from
that Church (or rather, from the errors and corruptions of it, Jun de Eccles
cap. 17. Parem in Romans 16.
from the Papacy in it, as the learned Junius and Pareus, and others of our
Divines rightly distinguish); in so doing, we have not separated from a true
Church.

2. 2. Not voluntary: but,
Nor yet (in the second place) can it be truly said, that this our separation
was voluntary, but necessitated, nay, enforced.

1. 1. Necessitated.
Necessitated through their obstinacy in their errors: which, notwithstanding
the discovery of them, and that so clear, as that some of their own have been
enforced to an acknowledgement of them, and all ways and means used for their
reformation, they still persist in; so as we may well conclude their wound
incurable, and themselves incorrigible: What then remains, but a cutting off?
Jer. 51* 9.
So says the Prophet concerning Babylon, We would have healed Babylon, but
she is not healed. What then follows? Forsake her, and let us go every one
to his own Country: A warrant sufficient, not only for a negative secession,
but for a positive separation from mystical Babylon. We would have healed
her, but she is not healed; no ways, no means that could be thought of, have
been neglected for her cure. How many Physicians have had her in hand? Luther,
and Zuinglius, and Calvin, and the rest of our learned and pious Reformers, a
whole College of Physicians; but all to no purpose; she is not, she will not
be cured. What then remains, but that we should withdraw and forsake her;
which cannot be construed as a voluntary, but a necessitated separation. Nay,

2. 2. Enforced.
Enforced, and that through her violence exercised upon all those who will not
hold communion with her in her corruptions; not permitting any to trade, Rev.
13. 16, 17.
to buy or sell, to have either Religions, or Civil communion with her, except
they receive her mark in their hands, or foreheads. But on the other hand,
Anathematizing them, thundering out Excommunications against them, which (for
fear they should be forgotten) are solemnly renewed every year upon their Holy
Thursday (as they call it:) Die Jovis mag^^^ Heb. don^ad^^, etc. P. Mart. loc.
Comm de Schis.
withal, prosecuting them with fire and sword, to confiscation of estates,
loss of liberty, and life it self. These things considered, let God and the
world judge betwixt us and them, whether our separation from them be voluntary
or no.

3. 3. Not an unwarrantable separation.
However, (in the third place) whether voluntary or no, sure we are, it is not
unwarrantable, being neither unjust, nor rash.

1. Not unjust: Being warranted both by authority of Scripture, not only
allowing, 1. Not unjust.
but commanding this Separation, and that under a dreadful penalty, Come out
of her, my people (so says the the voice from heaven concerning mystical
Babylon) Revel. Re^. 18. 4.
18. As also by the ground and cause of this separation, which is not some
light and tolerable errors; but Heresies, Idolatries: Errors in doctrine, and
these, if not directly, yet by consequence, and that immediate consequence,
fundamental. Corruptions in worship, both foul and gross; and that such, as
those which hold communion with her, cannot but partake in. Now, whether this
be not a warrantable ground for separation from her, let the same voice from
heaven speak; Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her
sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: No unjust separation then.

2. 2. Net Rash.
Nor yet Rash: There having (as I said) all the means been used for her
Reformation and cure that possibly could be thought of; but all to no purpose:
So as after this, what remains but a positive secession and separation?

Now put these together, and see whether this our departure from the Church of
Rome deserves to be stigmatized and branded (as by them it is) with the name of
Schism, Schisma aliud malum, aliud bonum: malum quo bona, bonum quo mala
scinditur unit^^s, Muse. Ioc. Com. de Schismate.
or no: or yet to be drawn in, and made use of by any (as by some it is) for
the patronage or countenance of any of the Schisms of the times. If this be a
Schism, it is a good and a warrantable Schism.

Qu. But are there any amongst us which are not so?

Answ. Here I wish I could make answer with the like cleernesse and freeness
as before. But, alas, What means the lowing of the oxen, Many s^hi^ms amongst
our selves.
and the bleating of the sheep? I mean, the confused noise of our lesser and
greater divisions, which ring so loud in the ears of the whole Christian world
at this day. Scarce any part of the Kingdom free from some kind or other of
them: The Church therein following the temper of the State, as the soul
oft-times does of the body: Divisions both Doctrinall and Practical. The Text
confines me to the later: Of those, how many everywhere? And that not only
such as these in the Church of Corinth were, divisions without separation,
sects, and sactions: but divisions of an higher nature, amounting to no less
then direct separation; and that not barely to a negative, but to a positive
separation, to the setting up of Altars against Altars, Churches against,
Churches. That it is so de facto, I think it will not, it cannot be denied.
Would to God the Church of God in this Kingdom, and in this place did not feel
the smart of it.

Qu. New separation, whether properly a Schism, or no.
But is this New separation a Schism in earnest, or no? There is the question.
In the answering whereof I shall deal as tenderly as I may, (only so, as I may
not betray the truth and cause of God, or the peace of this place wherein God
has made me one of his (though unworthy.) Ministers) having an unfeigned
respect to the persons of many who are engaged in this unhappy cause.

Answ. T^ed by the at res^d description of S^^im.
For Resolution, I shall deal with this as I dealt with the former; bring it
to the same balance, weigh it at the same beam. What Schism, and Schism
properly so called is, you have heard, and I think the description will not be
excepted against; viz. A voluntary unwarrantable separation from a true Church.
Now whether this practice be such a schism, or no, let it be enquired of in
the particulars. Quest. 1. Whether out Churches be true Churches.


1. Where the first inquiry will be, touching the Church, from which this
departure is made, whether it be a true Church, or no. Here it is not my
purpose, to multiply Controversies, which I rather desire (if it were
possible) might be brought to a unity. And therefore I shall wholly wave the
dispute about a National Church: Whether the Church of England be a true
Church, or no. Letting that go; let the Question be about particular
Congregations, Parochial Churches, (as we call them.) Whether these (I dare
not say all, but some of them; suppose that wherein we now are, and the like,)
be true Churches, or no. True Churches, and that not only Physically, but
Morally such. Not only Truly Churches (which is granted to the Church of Rome)
but True Churches.

Now as for this, Vindicated to be such.
(me thinks). I might well spare the labor of proving it, and take it for
granted, having so much Charity as to hope, that whatever any rash and violent
spirits amongst us may think and speak, yet those who are Judiciously godly,
have more Charity then to disclaim us for such. If they dare, I wish they would
speak out. But so it seems it is, T. Goodwi^s Zo robab^l.
that even this Bitter Root of rigid separation (as a Reverend Brother rightly
calls it) begins to grow and spring up again amongst us, there wanting not
some, who stick not to maintain and justify this their Separation from this
ground, because we are no True Churches of Christ. For their sakes, (or rather
for yours in defense of the cause of God agaainst them,) let me speak a few
words, and but a few.

1. Argu. 1. Here are Pillars of truth.
are not our Congregations. True Churches? What are not here the Pillars of
Truth? Is not the Word of Truth, the Gospel of Salvation, here held forth, and
that in an ordinary and constant way, even as the Edicts and Proclamations of
Princes are wont to be held forth by Pillars to which they are affixed? Now if
so, shall we question whether here be true Churches of Christ or no? Hear the
Apostle, 1 Timothy 3. 15.
1 Timothy 3. That thou may know how thou ought to behave thy self in the
House of God, which is the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground (or
stay) of Truth. Where the Pillar of Truth is, there is the House of God, the
Church of God. Where the light of Gods truth is set up and held forth in a
loving way, to the guiding of passengers in the way to Eternal life; The
Golden Candlesticks.
are not here the Golden-Candlestick? And if so, shall we question whether
here be true Churches or no? Let the spirit of truth decide it. The seven
Candlesticks, which thou saw, are the seven Churches, Revel. 1. So many
golden Candlesticks, so many Churches. Here is a first evidence; where the
light of the Gospel is held forth ordinarily in a public and Ministerial way
to a people that professes to walk by the direction of it, can it be questioned
whether there be a Church, a true Church or no?

Secondly, Arg. 2.
where the Seals of Gods Covenant, the Sacraments of the New Testament, Here
are the Seals of the Covenant, and consequently the Covenant it self.
are for substance rightly dispensed, according to the Institution of Jesus
Christ; can it be questioned whether there be a true Church or no? Where the
Seals of the Covenant are, there is the Covenant it self; the visible
Covenant; and where that is, there is a Church. To them pertained tho Covenants
(says the Apostle, speaking of the Church of the Jews.) Now who will deny
these appurtenances to our Churches? Romans 9. 4.
Here are the Seals of the Covenant, and consequently the Covenant it self.

Arg. Here is the presence of Christ in his O^dinances.
3. And as the Covenant, so the Glory. To them pertained the Glory of the
covenants, (so Paul puts them together.) The Glory, ^iz. the Arc of the
Covenant; a Testimony of Gods gracious and glorious presence. Now where this
is, shall we question whether there be a true Church or no? Where there is the
presence of Christ, in the midst of his Ordinances, so as in an ordinary way,
they are made effectual to the conversion, and salvation of many; where Christ
sits, Revel. 1. 13.
walks in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks, displaying his Power and
Glory, can it be questioned whether there be true Churches of Christ, or no?
But that he has done, and does this in some of our Congregations, I think it
will not be denied. It must be an envious hand that will dare to write [
Jchabod] upon the doore^ of some of these houses.

Argu. Here are Societies of visible Saints
4. Where there are societies of visible Saint^, all such by outward
profession, and some of them, a considerable part of them, walking in measure,
answerably to that profession; can it be questioned whether there be true
Churches of Christ, 1 Cor. 1. 2.
or no? To the Church of God, which at Corinth, to them which are sanctified in
Christ Jes^^, called to be Saints. It is the Apostles superscription to this
Epistle, in the second verse of the Chapter; where the latter clause is but an
Exegesis, an Explication of the former. A true Church of God, and a company of
visible Saints, are one and the same.

Ob. Why, but we are not all such.

Answ. No more were they in this Church of Corinth. The incestuous person, and
many others amongst them, they were strange Saints: yet a Church, a true
Church. A company of visible Saints joining together in the Ordinances of God,
though there be an unapprovable mixture of some heterogeneous members amongst
them, makes a Church a true Church.

Now, as for these, all these, I think it cannot, it will not be denied, but
that they are to be found in some of our Churches: Here are pillars of Truth,
golden Candlesticks, the doctrine of the Gospel truly and purely preached:
here are the seals of the Covenant, the Sacraments (for substance) rightly
administered: here is the glory, the presence of Christ in his ordinances,
ordinarily concurring with them, and giving efficacy to them, for the begetting
and nourishing up of Christian souls unto eternal life: here are
Congregations prefessing subjection to the Ordinances of Christ; a considerable
part whereof are visible Saints, walking answerably to that profession.

Object. Objections cleared.
True, says the Brownist, (for so I must look upon all those who shall deny
the truth of our Churches, as Separatists, and that rigid ones) Suppose all
this be granted; yet here are great defects, and those no less then
destructive, making your Churches to be no true Churches. But what are they?

Why possibly some of them will not spare to say, Object. 1. We ha^^ no true
Mi^^stery.
that we have no true Ministry.

Answ. If not; why then do they retain that Baptism which they received
through our hands?

Qu. Alleg. 1. We have our calling from Rome.
But why have we no true Ministry? Here possibly some will cry out upon us as
Antichristian, charging us, That we have received our calling from Rome, viz.
by the imposition of the hands of those who had their Calling and Ordination
from thence.

Answ. As for them, I shall put them and the Church of Rome together to debate
the point, and so leave them. The Church of Rome challenges us, that we are
no true Ministers: Why? Because we have not received our Ordination from them.
The Separatist on the other hand, he cries out upon us, We are no true
Ministers: Why? Because we have received our Ordination thence. Sure both
cannot speak truth. I shall therefore here leave them to dispute it out;
whilst in the mean time I speak a word or two with those who are of somewhat
more cool and (...).

Object. Alleg. 1. We have not our calling from the people.
We are no true Ministers (say they.) Why? Because we have not received our
calling from the people. We are neither Ordained, nor Elected by them.

Answ. To this charge, take this Reply in brief.

First, As for our Calling, we acknowledge we have not received it from them,
but from Jesus Christ our Lord and theirs. His servants we are, and in his
Name do we execute our Ministerial Offices and Functions, not in the Churches.

Secondly, As for our Ordination, we acknowledge the same. We had it not from
the people, and we bless God we had it not. In as much as we find neither
Precept, nor President for it in Scripture; neither until this Last-last age,
was there ever any such custom in the Churches of God.

Thirdly, As for our Election, if a Popular Vote be in this case needful, some
of us, many of us, can herein plead a Fore-consent, most of us (I presume) an
After-consent. Now let me ask this question, What was it that made Leah Jacobs
wife? She was not so the first night he bedded with her. Subsequens ^onsensus
Jacobi in Leam, fec^ eos conjuges.
Why? there came an After-con^ent, a Ratihibition (as the Lawyers call it)
which made the marriage valid. And such a consent (I presume) must, if not all,
the godly Ministers in this Kingdom have. If not an Explicit; yet an Implicit
consent, which is ejusdem valoris, of the same weight. So as if their first
entrance were not so orderly, yet, this after-act makes, or rather
acknowledges them to be true Ministers.

Object. Object. 2. We want Discipline.
2. But supposing our Ministry to be true, yet we want an Ordinance, and that
one of the three, the first three, viz. Discipline?

Answ. Suppose this defect, yet cannot that destroy the essence of a Church. It
was not the want of the Golden-snuffers, or some other like utensiles in the
Temple, that could make it to be no Temple. Discipline makes for the well
being, not for the being of a Church.

Secondly, Potest^ ipsa seandala removendi, etc. de jure and quoad a^^um primum
non potest ab Ecclesia vera separari Ames. Cas. Conse. de Eccles.
(But in the second place) however the Exercise of this Ordinance, be in some
particular acts for a time suspended, yet is not the Ordinance it self
alienated, which, being an Appendix to the word and Sacraments, cannot (in
respect of the right of it) be separated from the Church.

Object. 3. But here is no right Constitution. Our Churches were not Rightly
gathered at the first, neither are the Members of them combined in a
Church Covenant, Object. 3. We have no right constitution.
which is the form of a Church.

Answ. Suppose this also, that there were some Errors in the constitution of
our Churches; yet will not that make them no true Churches: inasmuch as
Constitution in that way is only an appendance of an external form, no part of
the essence of a true Church.

2. But neither must this be granted: Master Cotton himself in this case
pleads our cause, remembering us (not without warrant from Antiquity) that The
first Churches in this Kingdom were gathered either by some of the Apostles
themselves, Mr. Cottons way of the Churches,
or by Apostolical men: which being so, Cap. 7. See Acts and Monuments
( as himself inferres) we cannot but conceive that they were rightly
gathered and planted according to the rule of the Gospel. So that all the work
now is ( says he) not to make them Churches which were none before; but to
reduce and restore them which are, to their primitive institution.

3. Vinculum hoc est soedue vel ex^ress^^, vel implicit^^, Ames. Medul c. 32.
As for combination by Church Covenant, Doctor Ames truly states it, That an
implicit Covenant in this case is sufficient: Now such a Covenant do all make,
who join themselves to a Church, holding a constant communion with it in the
Ordinances of Christ. So much and no more can be extorted from that phrase of
joining to the Apostles, Joining to a Church, what.
of which we read, Act. 5. 13. where it is said, that after that exemplary
judgment executed upon Ananias and Sapphyra for their hypocritical
profession, Of the rest, (says the Text) no man durst join himself unto them.
And so it is said of Paul, Act. 9. When he came to Jerusalem, he assayed to
join himself to the Disciples; that is, to have fellowship and communion with
them: The word is the same with that which we meet with Act. 8. 29. where the
Spirit speaking to Philip, bids him go and join himself to the Eunuchs chariot:
(...), proxime adjungitor; that is, go near it, so as he might have converse
and conference with the Eunuch. And so do they, who in a constant way come and
sit down under such a Ministry, holding communion with such a people in all
the Ordinances of God, they join themselves to the Church in that place: which
being an implicit covenant, cannot be denied to be sufficient to the
constituting of true members of a Church.

But I shall waste no more time upon this subject, in vindicating the truth of
our Churches* which has already been done so strongly* so convincingly by
others; that certainly it cannot but be either great wilfulness, or great
weakness, not to acknowledge them so to be. Taking this then for granted,
which is by our judicious Brethren acknowledged, and, I think, will not be
denied by any moderate spirit; now proceed we to a second inquiry; and that
is, Quest. Qu. 2. Whether here be a separation from these true Churches.
Whether here be a separation or no from these true Churches?

Answ. That there has been so, I presume it will not be denied by any who ever
heard of the Brownists error; of which rigid way, I wish there were not yet
too many to be found, both in this, and other places of the Kingdom; such as
profess Separation, and glory in it. But I pass by them: the persons I have
here properly to deal with, are such as would be thought to come nearer to us,
and yet are divided from us; such as (in word at least) own us for true
Churches, and yet withdraw communion with us: and that, not only in a negative
way, (as Peter and some other of the Jews are said to have separated from the
Gentiles, Gal. 2. 12. 13.
Gal. 2. Before that certain (that is, certain Jews) came from James (viz.
from Jerusalem) he did e^t with the Gentiles: But when they were come, he
withdrew, and separated himself, etc. And other Jews dissembled likewise with
him. The very case of some in this and other places of the Kingdom: Before
that certain of another way came from the other side, they did eat with us,
they held communion with our Churches; but upon their coming, they have
withdrawn and separated themselves:) but also in a positive way, combining
themselves into separated societies, ^etting up of Churches some of them in
Churches, and against Churches; exercising the worship of God in a separated
way, refusing communion with us, whether for them to have communion with us, or
for us to have communion with them. So is it in diverse parts of the Kingdom;
and I wish I might not say, that it were so in this place.

Repl. Separation dis^laimed.
But do we not charge them wrongfully? Separation is a thing which they
profess against, and they call in their practice to bear witness to their
profession. Occasionally they will join with us in some acts of public
worship, viz. in hearing, and preaching the word; hearing our Ministers, and
preaching to our people.

Answ. Yet justly ^harged.
True, some of them happily will do the former: Some, I say, not all; for we
must know, that in this division (as commonly it is in all divisions) there are
subdivisions. Some of this way will hear us in this place; a second sort will
hear their own Ministers here, but not ours; a third sort will neither hear
ours, nor their own within these walls. But some of them will. And so they may
by their own principles, and yet have no Church Communion with us: Hear us as
gifted men, not as persons in off^^^: Hear us as Teachers, but not as
Ministers, (a distinction without a difference.) Besides, hearing (say they) is
no act of Church Communion. See M. Rutherford, Due right of Presbytery, page
270.
Eating one bread at the Lords Table, that indeed is properly Communion (say
they;) but not hearing one word. And as for occasional hearing, it is agreed
at all hands, it is not properly an act of Church Communion, which is no more
then Infidels and Heathens may do, who have no communion with the Churches of
Christ. And so for preaching to us; this they may do occasionally, nay
constantly, and yet have no communion with us, nor yet preaching to us as
Churches of Christ (which some of that way have openly and freely disclaimed in
way of Preface to their Sermons) no more then they may do to Turks and
Indians, with whom yet they have no communion. As for that Ordinance wherein
Church Communion (as they conceive it) properly lies, therein they totally
decline us. From my heart I wish there were not so much truth in this charge.

Repl. M. Burrough^ Irenic. ^ag. 172. No separation, because no praeunion.
But this cannot properly be called a Separation; a separation imports a
praeunion, a union by a Church-agreement: Now where there never was such an
agreement, there cannot properly be a separation, and consequently, not a
Schism.

Answ. Church Covenant, how far necessary.
To this I have laid the foundation of an answer already, by distinguishing
betwixt an explicit and an implicit Church-agreement or Covenant: the former
is verbal and formal, the later real. Now as for this later, an implicit
agreement, I presume it will not be denied to our Churches, otherwise they were
no Churches. And if it be granted, then to withdraw communion with them may
stand chargeable with the guilt of separation, and consequently, of Schism, as
truly, as really, as if they had been gathered by an explicit formal
Church Covenant. As for such a Covenant expressed in words, however some may
conceive it to make for the been esse, the well being, the orderly gathering of
a Church, (which my self will not wholly deny;) yet for the esse, the simple
being of it, I think few or none will affirm it. And if there may be a Church
where there is no such Covenant; then there may be a separation from that
Church, and that separation a Schism: Otherwise the Brownists, nay, the
Donatists separation had been no Schism, in as much as they did not separate
from Churches so gathered, and combined by an explicit Church Covenant: which,
whatever may be pleaded for the conveniencie of it, yet certainly, as it is
distinct from the Covenant of grace, it is but a prudentiall way, no other then
a humane, and that a novell invention. So then, as yet the charge runs on: Here
are true Churches, and here is a separation from these Churches.

Qu. Qu. 3. Whether this separation be voluntary. Schismatici pr^rie dieun^ur,
qui propria s^ionte separant, Aquin. Suit. 22. qu. 39. Conclus. 1. Here i, no
coaction.
A third inquiry follows, Whether this separation be voluntary and
spontaneous, or no. If so; this will contribute much to the making up of the
formalitie of this Schism. Now whether so, or no, let it be enquired, what
coaction, what necessity there has been, and is, for such a departure.

7. For the former, Coaction, and violent Expulsion, whatever the former times
might have done, yet I hope the present will not take up that plea: if so be
the violence and rigor of the one did drive some away, yet, me thinks, the
lenity and indulgence of the other might invite them to return to communion
again with that Church, those Churches which are so willing, so desirous to
receive them into their bosoms.

Repl. 2. A necessity pleaded.
But there was, there is a necessity of this departure. Why so? 1. A natural
necessity in so^e places, where congregations are too great.
Why, were there no more but this, the unequal division of your Congregations
in many places necessitates a division. For instance, In this (and so in many
other places of the Kingdom) your Congregations are too great, too numerous,
the people too many to join together in a convenient way in church communion.
Now in this case, a withdrawing of some is necessary; as it is for bees to
flight, when the hive is too strait for them.

Answ. In answer to this, I shall not spare again to acknowledge what I have
formerly both preached and published; The soverain ^hur^^-remedy, prin^ed an
1645.
That in this place (and so I suppose it is in diverse other in the Kingdom)
there is but too just a ground for this complaint: and my desire still is, (as
I then expressed it) that this inconvenience might be remedied by an orderly
division. Far be it from me, and from all the Ministers of Jesus Christ, to cry
out against divisions upon so base and unworthy a ground as this, because we
would ingrosse a people wholly to our selves, though too many for us to have
the inspection over. This it was which made the soldiers in the Gospel so
unwilling to have the seamlesse coat of Christ divided, John 19, 23, 24.
because each of them hoped and desired to have it whole and entire to himself.
And this it was (as Musculus aptly applies that Story) which made those four
Colonels, Muse^^l^* com. de Schism.
the four Patriarchs of the Church, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Alexandria,
Constantinople, and Rome, each to complain of the rending and tearing of the
Church by divisions: Why? Because every one of them aspired to be Commander in
chief, Universal Bishop, and so to have had the whole to himself. And this it
is which ever since has made that grand Schismatic the Pope, (so he is the
greatest Schismatic in the world) to cry out so much against Schism, because
by every such division his greatness suffers some diminution. Now far be such
base ends from the thought of any Minister of Christ: for my self, (I profess)
I am so far from grutching an orderly division in this place, that I shall not
rest satisfied till I see it accomplished: which I do not wholly despair to do,
if some of those who take up this complaint for their own advantage, be not the
hinderers of it.

2. But yet in way of Reply, I might (in the second place) mind them who take
up this plea in this place, that however this Congregation be great, and too
great, yet can it not be imagined to be so great as that at Jerusalem must
needs be; which yet is so earnestly contended for by those of that way, that it
was but one Congregation, one Church.

3. However, (in the third place) whether this be the true ground of this
Separation or no, let the empty seats of diverse engaged in this division,
being constantly in my eye, let them give evidence. If so be they for their
parts want no convenient accommodation, for participating in public
Ordinances; this plea in reference unto them, must be acknowledged to be in a
great measure, (if not wholly) void and null.

Repl. 2 A moral necess^ty pleaded, in regard of our sinful Mixtures.
But though here should be no Natural, yet there is a Moral necessity of
separating. And why so? Why, in one word, we cannot hold Communion with you
without sin. Why not? Why, in regard of those sinful mixtures which are
tolerated among you. Your Congregations are miscellaneous companies, of all
gatherings; wherein there is not that due separation of the Wheat from the
Chafe, the precious from the vile, which ought to be: But all sorts are
admitted even to Sacramental Communion. Now this your not separating,
necessarily puts us upon separating, that so we may not be entangled in the
guilt of your sin.

Answ. The chief a^gument for Separati^^n^.
Here is the common and great argument; the strongest hold which our Brethren
of that way put most confidence in. But how weak, how unable to defend this
their practice, when we have veiwed it a little, it will soon appear.

Answ. Mixtures in Church communion, the common stock upon which schism has
usually been graffed.
1. In the first place, I might here mind them and you, of what is very
considerable, how that this has been the common stock. whereupon Schism has
usually been grafted; the common plea and pretense, which for the most part
has been taken up by all Schismatics, in defense of their separation from the
Church. In the third and fourth Centuries, the third and fourth hundreds of
years after Christ, we read of three great and famous Schisms, the first of
the Novacians, the second of the Audeans, the third of the Donatists, all
separating from the Church. And what was the pretended ground of that their
separation? Why, still the over great Indulgence of the Church, (as they
thought) in receiving into, or keeping in her bosom, some whom they conceived
unworthy of her Communion. This was the thing which Novatus cried out against,
that any of those who in time of persecution had fallen, should be received
again into the fellowship of the Church, I, though upon the manifestation of
their Repentance. And because he could not therein be hearkened to, he and his
party separated from the Church, petending to greater purity in their way, then
was to be found in any other Churches upon Earth: Whence they were called (or
rather called themselves) by the name of Cathari, Cathari, qui seipsos isto
nomine quasi propter mundiciem super^^issime atque ^^tosissime nominant August.
de Haeres.
Puritans, a word which the Devil has since made great use of, for the
discountenancing of all power of godliness. And this it was which Audaeus, the
Father of that second Schism took so great offense at; First the Pomp and
pride of the Bishops of his time, together with their Imperious insolency, in
Tyrannizing, over the flock committed to them; which being a great eyesore to
him (and that justly,) he had often openly and tartly declamed against. Nimia
jam Episcoporum Christian^. rum in ipsum gregem Dei insolentia, and in vivendi
more and genere superbia, lux^^, etiam, (...) opes and lanticia, quibus vir
ille, and merito quidem (ut Epiphan. scribit,) offensus saepe eos coram acerbe
increpavit. Dinaeus de Here Is. ex Angust. and Epist. Propter hominum vitia
coetum orthedoxa Ecclesiae descrunt Andaei, (vel Audiani,) (quod Donatistarum
erroris fu^^ postea seminarium,) sc. propter foenora Christianorum, and
concubinatus coelibu^^. Danaeus ibid. and vid. Simpson de Haeret. et Theodor.
And besides, through the remissness of Discipline, there were diverse Usurers
and Unclean persons tolerated in the Church.

And the very same ground it was, that Donatus afterward separated upon. Being
offended at the connivence showed toward those Traditores (of whom I told you)
he falls off from Communion with the Church, Se ab eorum caetu separant quos
peccatores and non satis puros judicant, ut seorsim cae. (...) colligent, and
Schisma faciant. Danaeus ibid. de Donatist.
setting up his Altar against her Altar (as Augustine says of him,) gathering
a Church, in and against the Church, pretending to greater strictness and
purity, then was elsewhere to be found, severing from their Communion all those
whom they looked upon as Sinners, and judged not pure enough to join with
them. From this head then sprang those first and famous Schisms in the Church.

And from the same root sprang that latter Schism of the Anabaptists, which is
now putting up here again in many parts of the Kingdom at this day. Cum omnia
sceleribus plena sint inter nos, promiscue ei^^am ad. mitti omnes ad Coenam
sine graviori vel censura vel disciplina, etc. Arct. Problem. de Anabapt. ^. de
Schismat.
The first, and great distaste which they took at the Reformed Churches, and
whereupon they separated, was, the scanlous lives of Ministers, and people,
that they did not walk answerably to their professions, but were given over to
all manner of scandalous evils; and yet notwithstanding that they were
promiscuously admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, without any
censure or discipline exercised upon them.

And I shall not need to tell you that it was the very same stone at which
Brown and his followers first stumbled, renouncing our Church upon this very
ground.

Now, This new Separation justly rendered suspicious.
were there nothing else, me thinks this alone might render this pretense very
suspicious, in that it has still been taken up by most Schismatics in most
ages of the Church, and made the ground of their separations, which ye^ have
ever been universally condemned as unjustifiable and unwarrantable for all
that. That Rock which so many have been split upon, me thinks it should make
Christians very shie and wary how they dash against it.

But I will not wholly prejudge this cause, The Allegation in reference to our
Churches further examined.
let it have a fair hearing, that so we may see what strength (or rather
weakness) there is in this plea in reference to the Church, or Churches of God
amongst us at this day.

Alleg. Alleg.
We have unwarrantable mixtures among us, and that even in our Sacramental
Communion.

Answ. Answ. Sinful mixtures a just scandal.
Here is a blot (I must confess) which I heartily wish I were able wholly to
wipe off from the Churches face in this Kingdom; mixtures there have been,
mixtures there are; and for my part I shall not undertake the Patronage or
defense of them. From my heart I wish that there were in all our Churches a due
and orderly separation, for the healing and preventing of that which is, or may
be disorderly (such a Purge could not but be very proper in this Spring time of
Reformation and Errors.) However that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper may be
kept (as it ought to be) as a sacred and holy Mystery, not to be prostituted to
all comers, how visibly unworthy, and incapable soever: which, where it is
allowed or practiced, I must acknowledge it a just scandal.

But yet let not the Church of God in this Kingdom be too deeply charged with
this guilt. But no^ so justly charged upon the Church of England.
Suppose it that ( de facto) such unwarrantable mixtures have been, and yet ^^e
to be found, yet cannot be properly put upon the Churches score. What her
Ordinance was touching the keeping back of scandalous persons from the
Sacrament, they which have read her ancient Rubric, cannot be ignorant; and
what at this day it is, let the late Directory speak, which expressly excludes
all persons ignorant and scandalous, as not meet to partake in that holy
Mystery. Now, what though there have been, and (it may be) yet are some
deplorable failings in the execution hereof, thorough some past and present
unhappy obstructions in the exercise of Discipline, yet cannot the Church
properly stand charged with them.

Nor yet are all particular Congregations so deeply chargeable with this
particular Error. Much less upon all particular Congregations.
What care has already been taken in this place for the removal of this
scandal, it has not been so privately carried, but that all in the place (I
presume) have been either eye or ear witnesses of it; and I doubt not but
there has been the like, if not greater circumspection that way in many other
Congregations of the Kingdom: So as this pretended soar of mixed communion may
be conceived to be in a fair and hopeful way of Cure.

Quest. Whether our supposed mixtures be a just ground for separation.
But suppose the worst, that it should not be so thoroughly healed, our
Congregations not so thoroughly purged as our Brethren desire they should be;
yet what is this such a Plague-soar, as that there is no abiding in the House
with it? does this enforce a necessity of Separation?

Answ. Enquire first whether they be unwarrantable.
Here (in the first place) let it be enquired, whether the purging which our
Brethren desire, be such as the word requires or no? Possibly in this case they
may fish with a net of a larger and wider mask then ever the first Fishermen,
Peter, and the rest of the Apostles did; a net which will take none but grown
fishes. As for weak Christians, and persons inoffensive in their lives and
conversations, unless they can give positive, clear, and demonstrative
evidences of the work of grace in their hearts, it may be they will adjudge
them unworthy of their Communion. Now, if so, we must here crave pardon if we
go not up with them to the height of strictness, which we think the word will
not bear us out in; herein we must profess to exercise as much Charity as a
holy discretion regulated by the Word will permit us, accounting it the safest
course rather ampliare favores, to enlarge Gospelfavours and privileges,
reaching them forth to all such as we have no just and clear exception against,
then to withold them from any to whom they of right appertain. And herein we
presume we shall do no more then what we have good warrant from our Lord and
Master for, who in the days of his flesh made good what was foretold of him,
not breaking the bruised reed, not quenching the smoking flax; Is. 42. ^.
but dealing gently, and tenderly with weak and feeble ones, reaching forth
supportation and comfort to them as occasion was offered.

2. But (in the second place) suppose it, 2 If unwarrantable, whether yet they
enforce a separation.
that herein we should fall short, not coming up to such an exact separation as
the Word requires, but that still some persons be retained in the bosom of the
Church, and received to her Communion, which are in truth unworthy of it. What
then, does this Laodicean temper in the Church enforce a separation from it?

Alleg. The affirmative pleaded for by our brethren
To this our separating Brethren will plead that it does; And that upon the
forenamed ground, because by communicating with such persons, they shall also
be entangled in their sin, at least in the Churches sin, in tolerating
them. Now in this case (say they) the warrant runs clear. Rev. 1^. 4.
Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins; where it
once comes to this, that in holding Communion with a Church, we must of
necessity have communion in her sin, here is a necessity of separation from her.

Answ. Answ.
To join with them upon this issue: In the first place, we might not without
just cause here demur upon the Proposition; No sufficient warrant for
separation, because we cannot join with a Church in a^ particular acts of
worship.
In as much as put the case a man cannot hold communion with a Church in some
particular act or exercise without sin, yet is he not thereupon bound to
separate from her. It was the case of the pious and reverend Non-conformists of
the last age, they were persuaded (many of them) that they could not hold
communion with the Church of England in receiving the Sacrament in the gesture
prescribed without sin, yet did they not thereupon separate from her. True, in
that particular act they withdrew, but yet so, as they held communion with her
in the rest; far from a Negative, Answ.^. Communion may be held with a Church
where in there are some unwarrantable mixtures, without sin. Reas.
much more from a Positive separation. But letting that pass.

That which we shall insist upon, is this. That communion may be held with such
a Church wherein there are some unwarrantable mixtures tolerated, and yet
without sin.

The reason is plain. God has not made all private Christians Stewards, nor
yet Surveyours in his House, so as that every one should take an exact notice
of the conditions of all those whom they hold communion with, All private
Christians are not Stewards in Gods house
who are fit to be members of the Church, and who not; who are fit to come to
the Lords Table, and who not. No, let them look to themselves. 1 Cor. 11. 23
That is Paul's rule, 1 Cor. 11. 28. Let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat of that bread, and drink of that cup^^ Here is an exercise proper and
usual for private Christians, each one to try and examine himself: which if
rightly and thoroughly done, it would make men less intent upon others. As for
others, they must stand or fall to their own Master. Look thou to thy self; if
others be not what they should be, see that thou be what thou ought to
be. In the mean time be not distasted with the Church for their sakes. It is
Cyprians counsel cited by Aretius, and it is very wholesome and proper for
these times. What though there be some Tares discovered in the Church, Vide
Aret. Problem de Schism.
(says he) yet let not that be an impediment either to our faith or charity,
so as to make us desert that Church wherein we see such a mix^ure; But let us
for our parts labor every of us that we may be found good corn, that so when
God shall come to gather his crop into his garner, we may not be cast out. ^
Tim. 2. 20
In a great house (so he goes on) the Apostle will tell us, that there are not
only vessels of Gold and Silver, but also of Wood and Earth: Now let it be our
care and endeavor to make this sure that we are of the former sort, that we be
vessels of honor: As for the other, leave them to their maker. God has not
made private Christians Stewards, or Surveyours in his house.

2. 2. Much less fanners in his floor. Matthew. 3* 1^.
Much less (in the second place) Fanners in his floor. This work is primarily
Christ's, who has his Fan in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his
floor. And ministerially the Church Officers whom Christ has betrusted with
the ordering of his Church according to the Rule of the Word; them has he made
the Porters in his house, for the opening and shutting of the doors of the
Churches communion, by the Keys of Doctrine and Discipline. Now in this case,
if either their hands be tied by any human restrictions of civil Authority,
not permitting them to exercise that power which Christ has committed to them,
and of right belongs to them, or if thorough remissness and negligence they
shall let loose the reins of Discipline beyond what is fitting; In this case
themselves may be guilty, Private Christians by communicating with wicked men,
are not thereby entangled in the guilt of their s^^.
others may be guilty: But as for private Christians, being not accessory to
either of these, how they by their bare communicating with persons so
tolerated, should come to be entangled in the guilt of that sin, it cannot be
conceived.

Repl. Object.
No? The Apostle says it expressly, 1 Cor. 5. 6. Know ye not that a little
leaven leaveneth the whole lump? This he speaks touching the incestuous person,
who by his continuance in the Church of Corinth uncast out, endangered the
whole Flock.

Answ. The Church endangered by toleration of mintures.
Endangered? True, so he did, and so do scandalous sinners wherever they are
tolerated in a Church; they do endanger the rest of the members, viz. by their
evil examples, and in that respect ought to be cast out from communion, Vnius
homini^ contagi^ne tota sap^ inficitu^ multitude. Calv. ad loc. Impunitas
vitiorum alios ad peccandum invitat, Pareus ad loc.
that so the Church may be preserved from infection: But yet it does not
thereupon follow, that all the members should presently be made guilty by that
toleration. True indeed, in case they do not lay that sin to heart, be humbled
for it, and use all lawful means for remedy, (which was the case of the
Church of Corinth at that time, notwithstanding that, and many other scandalous
evils were tolerated amongst them, yet they were secure, thinking highly of
themselves, glorying in their Church State, But not all the members thereby
presently made guilty. Calv ad loc.
perinde acsi omnia fuissent apud se aurea, (to use Calvin's words) as if all
had been pure and perfect with them; this glorying of theirs Paul here tells
them it was not good, Your glorying is not good, that is, very evil and
sinful:) in this case indeed they may make themselves accessory to the sin;
but not barely through communion with that Church wherein such an evil is
tolerated: The similitudes are obvious and common, -- Greu (...) in agris (...)
scab^e ca^^t and poirigine po^ci; Vu^que contacta livorem ducit ab (...)
Juvenal.
One scabbed sheep, one rotten grape, one gangrenated member, in continuance of
time will infect the whole flock, the whole bunch, the whole body, viz. by
transmitting and communicating the malignitie which is in themselves to the
rest. But it does not therefore follow, that the whole is infected, because a
part is so: Or, to hold to the Apostles proverbiall Allegory there, A little
leaven, by lying long in a mass of paste, will in time leaven the whole, viz.
by transfusing its sowrenesse into all the other parts; but it does not
therefore follow, that the whole lump is presently leavened, because the leaven
is there. Thus a scandalous person, one or more, tolerated in a Church, may by
his or their evil example, made the more dangerous through impunitie,
communicate the infection of his or their sin unto others: yet are not all the
members of the Church thereupon presently involved in the guilt of that sin to
which they are no ways accessory.

To enlarge no further in a case so clear. You see how the charge of Schism
still runs on: Here is a separation; A separation from a true Church; A
voluntary separation from a true Church.

Quest. The fourth and last inquiry is yet behind; and that is, Whether this
be a warrantable separation or no. Qu. 4. Whether this separation be
unwarrantable.
That some separation may be so, I have shown you already. Whether this be so
or no, that is the question. And yet no question, in case it shall be
demonstrated to be either an unjust, Demonstrated so to be; being
or rash separation: Both which, I fear, upon the trial it will be found to
be.

1. 1. Unjust.
An unjust separation: Such ever is a total separation from a true Church.
True, a partial separation in some cases may be warrantable; but a total
separation, Sec^ssio totalis cum absoluta renuntiatione out rejectione omnis
communionis, non potest licite adbiberi erga Ecclesiam veram: sed partialis
tantum, quatenus communionon potest exerceri sine peccato, Ames. cas. de
S^^his^n.
a renouncing of all communion with a true Church, can in no case be so: So our
judicious Casuist rightly determines it.

No more is this separation (whatever it be) which is made from our Churches.

1. 1. Having no warrant from the Word.
In as much (first) as it has no warrant from the Scripture to bear it out.

Repl. Object. 1. Rev. 28. 4.
No (say some of that way)? Yes that it has: What else means that known
charge, Come out of her my people?

Answ. We answer, It is the voice of God calling his people to separation from
mystical Babylon. Now, let those our rigid Brethren once prove us a limb of
that Antichristian body, and then we shall acknowledge their separation just.

Alleg. Our separation from Rome no warrant for this separation from us.
But yet Rome both was, and is a true Church, So as there may be a total
separation from a true Church, and yet not unjust.

Answ. How Rome may be said to be a true Church, I have shown you already; not
so true, but that she is false: So to grant her the one, as to deny the other,
is larger charity then ever Protestant pen yet afforded her. Now, if our
Brethren will acknowledge us to be a true Church in no other sense but that (as
I fear, the charity of some of them will reach no farther) we shall have
little cause with thankfulness to acknowledge their acknowledgement.

Repl. Object. 2.
But what say we to that express Text which speaks so full for Separation, 2
Cor. 6. 17. examined.
both name and thing? 2 Cor. 6. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye
separated (says the Lord) and touch no unclean thing, etc. (...), Be ye
separate.

Answ. True, from Infidels and Idolaters; of such the Apostle there speaks:
And with such, Christians are not to have intimate society and communion, lest
thereby they be drawn to the imitation of their sins, and so to the
participation of their punishments; specially, to have Religious communion with
them in their Idolatry. In this case (says the Apostle) Touch not the unclean
thing. However a civil converse and commerce may be had with such; yet into
their secrets, their mysteries, let not our souls enter: More then this cannot
be extorted from that Text. Now let the charge be made good against us, that we
are such, then we shall acknowledge a separation from us just.

Repl. Object. 3.
Why, but that known place in the former Epistle will reach us and our mixed
communion, which is there clearly held forth as a sufficient ground and warrant
for separation: 1 Cor. 5. 11. examined.
Now I have written to you ( says the Apostle) not to keep company. If any
man that is called a Brother be a fornicatour, or covetous, etc. with such a
one no not to eat.

Answ. What meant by eating: Not religious, but civil communion. Commisc^ri,
est familiariter versari cum aliquo, and e^us Consuetudine implicari, Calv. ad
loc.
To this, how specious and promising soever, an answer is soon returned: That
which Paul there prohibits is not properly a Religious, but a Civil communion;
that he means by not companying: (...), non commisceri; not to mingle
themselves with such scandalous livers, as that incestuous person was, viz. by
a voluntary, familiar, and intimate conversation: so he explains himself in
that other clause, [ with such a one no not to eat:] that is, in an ordinary
way repariring to their tables, or inviting them to yours, which is a token of
intimate familiarity and friendship. But what is this to the Lords Table, or
to religious communion?

Repl. If the former be unlawful, much more the later.
Yes (say they) that it is. If we may not have civil, much less religious
communion with such a one: if we may not eat with him at our tables, much less
at the Lords Table.

Answ. Difference betwixt civil and religious communion.
Not so neither: In as much as the one is an arbitrarie and voluntary, the
other, a necessary communion. Whether to have intimate society, civil
familiarity with such a one or no, it is in our own choice: not so in
religious communion. Now of such a communion must the Apostle there be
understood, 1. The one arbitrary, the other necessary. Calv. Com^. ad loc.
a voluntary and unnecessary communion: Quatenus liberum est (says Calvin upon
it) so far as we are left to our own liberty, we ought to decline the
society of persons openly scandalous, (specially, in case once they be brought
under the censure of the Church, the censure of Excommunication (which is the
particular case in that Chapter:) Persons scandalous, they ought to be excluded
from religious communion with the Church; with such the Church should not eat,
they ought not to be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: and being
excluded from her Communion, Christians ought not to entertain unnecessary
society with them.) Otherwise, civil communion with them may be had. p. Mart
ad loc
Peter Martyr puts one case: Suppose a travellour in his journey (a case too
ordinary) cannot be commoded with diet or lodging but in a profane Inn or
Alchouse, Calv. ad loc.
may he not therefore take in there? And Calvin puts the like: Suppose a man
coming to an Ordinary, see an excommunicate person there, may he not sit
down and eat with him? In these cases a man is not left to his own liberty
and free choice: no more is a Christian in his religious communnion. Whether
he will come to the Lords Table or no, it is not left to his own choice; it
is his duty, not his liberty. And therefore, suppose the company
communicating with him be not every ways such as he could desire, suppose
some of them apparently unworthy, yet is he not thereupon to abstain from
that Ordinance, much less to separate from that Church whereof God has made
him a member. To this I might add, The one of these is an inward, the other
only an outward communion: the communion which a believer has with an
unbeleever in eating of the Sacrament, is no other but what the unbeleever
there has with Christ, an outward and visible communion: But in intimate
society there is an inward communion; so as there is a broad difference
betwixt the one and the other. Here then is no warrant which can yet be found
in Scripture to make this separation warrantable and just.

Repl. 2. Unjust, because no warrantable cause for this s^paration.
But is it not sufficiently warrantable in the ground and cause of it?

Answ. Not so neither in reference to our Churches (I speak still for some, not
for all) wherein, whatever blots may be found, let me yet say, There were as
great (if not greater) in the Church of Corinth. Have we some some scandalous
persons tolerated amongst us? So had they. Have we a mixture in our Communion?
So had they. Tertim abusus erat luxus, quod epulando usque ad e^rietatem
p^tarent. Ille vero (inquit) est ebrius. Non a^cipi^ haec quasi ^yperbolice
dicta, sed quod vere sic profanarint sacrum Ch^sti ordinent Corinthii. Pareus
ad l^c. G^la plus. se is indulgebant. Estiu^ad loc.
A strange mixture, specially if that word be to be taken properly, (as some
Expositours conceive it must be,) which the Apostle lays in their
Sacramental dish, 1 Cor. 11. 21. where he charge them, that when they came
together to Celebrate the Lords Supper, and to have Christian Communion in
their Love Feasts, (which were annexed to the Sacrament, immediately either
going before it, or following after it, Dubium esse possit an hoc genus convi^^
pre^esserit apud Corinthios, aut consecutum sit sacra mysteria. Chrysostomus
aperte dicit consecutum fuisse, quod videtur moribus veterum fuisse co^sonum,
quia jejuni sumebant; test Tertullian^, and Hieronymo. P. Mart. Com. in 1. Cor
11. 21.
uncertain whether, though most probably the latter) some of them were Hungry,
and others Drunken; however, if they were but intemperate in the use of the
Creatures at that time, which Expositours generally conceive the word there to
import; If so, here was such a Mixture, as I hope our Congregations will not,
cannot be charged with. Yet, for all this, and many other abuses tolerated in
that Church, we hear not a word from the Apostle, by way of advice and counsel
to his Corinthians, that the godly party should withdraw themselves from
Communion with such a Church; Or that they should mould and incorporate
themselves into a new body, a new Church, consisting of a select party taken
out of the old one. Which yet surely, had it been so necessary, or expedient,
as now it is conceived by some to be, he would not have neglected to put them
upon: Still then it must remain an unjust Separation, notwithstanding what ever
ground can be alleged to the contrary.

3 Unjust in regard of some Ministers who are hereby deserted. Whether people
may change their Ministers as often as they please.
To which I might yet add, (what is not altogether inconsiderable) the
Injustice of this practice, in reference to those Ministers, and those
Churches, from which this Separation is made. Those Ministers are hereby
deserted by those whom (it may be) God bath made them his Instruments, to
beget, and bring home to himself, or at lest to nourish, and bring up for
himself; Strangers entering upon the fruit and comfort of their labors:
Themselves no more owned, then as if there had never been any such relation
betwixt them, and their people.

Repl. Why, but, is this such an act of Injustice? What, may not people make
choice of what Ministers they please, putting themselves under such a Ministry
as by which they may edify most?

Answ, Suppose it that a people have such a Power and Right, to choose their
own Ministers; yet having once chosen them, and God by giving a blessing to
their Ministry, having ratified and confirmed that choice, evidencing that
they are the Ministers of God to them; whether may they now upon your pretext
of greater Edification, take a liberty to themselves to chose new ones, toties
quoties, as often as they please, Master Buroughs. Ire. nic. c 22.
and to run from one to another: This the moderate Author of the late
Irenicon, will by no means allow, but condemns as the direct way to bring in
all kind of disorder and confusion into the Church. And I think none, who are
impartially judicious, but will therein subscribe to him.

As Ministers are hereby injured, 4. Injust in regard of the Churches Separated
from.
so Churches. The Churches from which this Separation is made, though true
Churches of Christ, yet hereby they are Shamed, Contemned, Condemned,
Disquited, Hindered, Endangered. And If this be not an Act of high Injustice,
let any, but those who are interested in the guilt of it, speak.

Sure I am, Separation not agreeable to the Rule of common equity. Matt. 7 12.
Totius justitiae breviarium Hieron. ad Celant.
it is not agreeable to that Breviate of the second Table, the Rule of common
equity and justice, laid down by our Savior, Matt. 7. 12. Whatsoever ye
would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them. What Ministers,
what Churches would willingly have such measure meated to themselves? And if
not so, let them see with what pretext of equity and justice they can offer it
unto others.

I know there will be found some Figleaves to cover the nakedness of this
practice. But they are such as will soon be blown away.

1. In the first place, it is alleged, that in this kingdom at present there
is no way laid forth for the. Alleg. 1. No way yet stated.
Churches to walk in. And then why may not they take liberty to set up their
Way, as well as others theirs?

Answ. Judge. 17. 6.
Now truly so it was in Israel, when there was no King there, every one did
that which was good in his own eyes. So they did; but whether they should so
have done or no, there is the question, (and yet no question.) And so it has
been in this intermysticall season, this unhappie Interregnum of the Church.
Multitudes have taken a license to do what seemed them good, broaching of new
Doctrines, The present unsetlednesse of Discipline, no just ground for
Separation.
and setting up of new ways. But quo jure, by what right, and with what
warrant they have done it, let them make answer; for I cannot. True it is, this
unhappie Anarchie, no Church Government, must be acknowledged to have been the
occasion of them all, but a just ground or warrant for any of them, it cannot
be said to be; not for Separation, I am sure.

1. 1. The church not dissolved.
In as much as the Churches frame and fabric has not been hereby dissolved
and taken down. The Church-work which has been, and yet is in hand in this
Kingdom, is not new b^^lding but repairing. No just reason why the Inhabitants
should forsake the house for that.

2. 2. The church seeking out, her way.
But suppose the Church has not her way as yet laid out, yet it will not be
denied but that she has been all this while seeking it out. Now for any in the
mean time to withdraw and separate themselves from her is an advantage taken,
not given. The story tells us of Ezra, Ezr. Ezra 8. 21.
8. how that he with his company in their return from Babylon to Jerusalem
celebrated a Fast at the River Ahavah, setting themselves in a solemn manner to
seek of God a right way, for themselves and theirs. Now whilst they were at
their prayers, should a party have broke away from them, upon pretext of a
perfect knowledge of what they were seeking for, whether this had been a
warrantable separation, or no, I dare put it to them who take up this plea for
themselves.

3. 3. That way in part laid, out.
But neither (in the third place) can it truly be said, that the Church is so
wholly destitute of a way to walk in, whether for Worship, or Government. The
former of which is (and for some good time has been) fully agreed upon. The
latter how ever not fully completed, yet is it for substance both determined,
and held forth.

2. Alleg. 2. The Churches way not held forth jure divino.
But it is not held forth as jure divino.

Answ. I. Suppose it be not, yet is it not held forth as not jure divino.

2. Though it be not held forth as [ the] Government expressly laid down in the
Word, yet is it held forth as that Government, which is conceived to be most
agreeable to the Word. Ans.
Otherwise it should not come up to the National Covenant.

3. Alleg. 3. A Separation intended in our Churches.
But your own practice will shortly justify ours. You intend a separation in
your Churches, and what do we more?

Answ. 1. A Separation in a Church by purging of it, will not justify a
Separation from a Church by departing from it.

2. Ans.
Neither will it follow, that because we purge our own floors, therefore others
(strangers) may come and set their fans on work in them. Alleg. 4. What if
Separation be tolerated by Authority.


3. Nor yet will a Separation which is orderly and regular, justify that which
is disorderly and irregular.

4. But suppose this our separation be tolerated by Authority.

Ans. Suppose it (which yet for my own part I cannot suppose), yet will not
that make it warrantable. In as much (first) as Toleration is properly of evil.
Thou toleratest that woman Jezabel, Revel. 2. 20. However (in the second place)
Toleration does not change the nature of the thing, but leaves it as it
finds it. Much less (in the third place) will a Toleration for the future
justify a precedent act done before tha^ Toleration.

Such and the like Allegations I might reckon up many. But they are but (as I
said) fig leaves, though the best covers that can be found yet not sufficient
to bide the injustice of this way.

Much less the rashness of it. 2. The rashness of this new Separation, proved
That is the last particular, which if this practice of new Separation cannot
be acquitted from, this alone will be enough to render it an unwarrantable
Separation, and consequently a Schism. Now whether so or no, will soon appear,
if we consider either the ground, or manner of it.

1. 1. From the ground of it, which is not so weighty.
For the ground, what ever can be pretended there will be sound none sufficient
to bear it out. Suppose some just grievances may be found amongst us. Yet are
they tolerable? If so, then is Separation upon this ground intolerable,
unwarrantable. In as much as it ought not to be, but upon a very great and
weighty cause, and that where there is no remedy. Si error est tolerabilis, non
oportet fieri secessionem. Chamer. de Schism. Etiam secessio fit temere cum fit
ob morum corruptelas. Cujus rei baec ratio est, quod ubi cunque viget puritas
doctrinae, Deum in eo caetu necesse est habere Ecclesiam tametsi obrutam pene
multitudine scaudalorum, Ch^mer. ibid. 1. As that which the Brown^st^s had. 2.
As to wish down Shism.
Suppose there be some, nay many just scandals amongst us by reason of
corruption in manners. Yet is not this neither a sufficient ground for
Separation from a Church, wherein there is purity of Doctrine and Worship, with
some power of godliness to be found. So as should it be granted that there is
a cause, and that cause weighty, yet is it not so weighty as to turn the scale
for Separation. Surely, how weighty soever it may be pretended to be, yet

1. It is not so weighty as that which the Brownists had to plead for their
Separation, most of those blocks which they stumbled at, being now taken out of
the way. And yet for all that, theirs was, and yet is universally censured by
all but themselves for a rash Separation.

2. Neither (in the second place) will it be found to be so weighty as to weigh
down, as to justify Schism. This being the weightier and greater evil of the
two. This was Augustines Argument (as I told you) against the Donatists: And we
may as truly take it up in this case. Though Toleration of some unwarrantable
mixtures in a Church be an evil, yet is it not so great an evil as Separation
upon that ground. Put them into the balance together, and it will be found,
that this preponderates, and weighs down that. The unadvisedness of the new
Separation in many of the followers of that way: whose grounds are
And, if so, needs must this be an unadvised Separation.

Unadvised. So it must be concluded to be in the Leaders (how advised soever in
other things), much more in many of the followers who are carried away upon
very light and slight grounds. Instance in two or three of them.

1. The worthiness of some of the persons who are leading-men, going before
them in this cause. Is it likely that such men should be deceived?

Ans. 1. The worthiness of their Leaders.
And what (I pray you) were Peter and Barnabas? Were not they worthy men? And
yet for all that we find them taken in this snare, guilty of an unwarrantable
separation.

2. But this way prospers. Many come into it daily.

Ans. Acts 11. 24 Gal. 2.
And did not Arianism so? Though a damnable Heresy, yet how did it fly like
lightning? over-spreading the world of a sudden, breaking in like a Land flood,
2. The prospering of their way. Ingemuit totus orbis and Arrianum se esse
miratus est. Hieron. advers. Lucifer.
carrying all a fore it. And do not many Errors, acknowledged Errors, the like
in the Kingdom at this day? And yet never the better to be liked for that.

3. But here is a great deal of strictness, holy strictness in this way.

Ans. And was there not so in most of those first, and famous Schisms of the
Church? The Novatians, Audians, Donatists, Luciferians, all strict in their
way: strict in their personal walkings; strict in their Church Order; in all
likelihood more strict then the rest of the Churches which they separated from.
Neither is it to be wondered at, 3. Strictness in that way.
that we should meet with extraordinary strictness in a righthand Error. But
the question is, whether there be not too great a strictness. Whether the way
of the Gospel be not in this way made narrower then ever Christ made it, 2. The
rashness of this Separation proved from the Manner.
or his Apostles left it. Such weak grounds they are which multitudes are
carried away with. Now needs must this be in them a rash and unadvised
Separation who have no better principles to bottom their practice upon then
these.

In the second place, consider the manner of it. And here we shall find some
no small aggravations of this unadvisednesse, and that both in the leaders, 1.
Separating in a time of Reformation.
and followers.

1. In separating at such a time, in a time of Reformation. That has been the
practice here, and I presume it has been the same in many other parts of the
Kingdom. Whilst public Authority has been at work to find out Gods way,
private persons have taken the advantage to set up their own. Whilst the one
has been reforming, the other instead of joining with them to strengthen their
hands, have been withdrawing, and separating themselves and others from them.

And what? To separate from a Reforming Church a great aggravation.
Separate from a reforming Church? A Church that profess^th so much
willingness, and readiness in every thing to be conformed to the rule of the
Word? Brethren, let me tell you, there is more in this circumstance then
happily some have been, or are aware of. When God is coming toward a Church,
then to run away from it? When God is turning his face toward it, then to turn
our backs upon it? When God is building it up, then to be active in pulling it
down? This is a sad thing, and surely if rightly apprehended, must sit sad upon
the spirits of some.

Had it been some years since, when God seemed to have been about to depart
from us, when Innovations, and Corruptions were breaking in upon us, then to
withdraw, then to forsake the Church (however I d^re not a vouch it for a work
so transcendently meritorious as some conceive of it, yet) I grant it
tolerable. But now to do it, now that (as themselves conceive of it) the Church
is coming up out of the wilderness, now that she begins to boil out her scum,
now that she begins to be more refined, and reformed, now to forsake her,
truly this is no small aggravation to this desertion.

For Mariners at Sea to forsake their ship when she is ready to sink, (though
possibly it may be an Error and oversight in them so to do; yet) it is
pardonable. But if the ship shall begin to rise and float again, so as they see
apparent hopes, that with a little pumping and baling she may be saved, now to
leave her, (much more to cut holes in her sides) their owners will give them
little thanks for it. Some years since the Church of God amongst us seemed to
be in a sinking condition. Then to leave her might be pardonable. But now, now
that through the mercy and goodness of God, she begins to be somewhat
floatsome, and boyant, so as a little industry and labor in the pumping and
purging may free her and save her, shall we now desert her? (that I do not say
cut holes in her sides). Separation from this Church now more unwarrantable
then ever.
Surely, surely, never was Separation from this Church so unwarrantable as it
is at this day: warrantable it never was since she was a true Church. In the
last age an Error it was, a Schism; and that not only Mr. Aynsworths more
rigid, but Mr. Robinsons more moderate Separation. So accounted and censured at
all hands. Surely then at this day it cannot be warrantable. Make the fairest
of it, an unadvised Separation it is.

2. Unadvised, being (as is charitably conceived) undertaken without due regard
to, and consideration of the consequences following upon it, whether Civil, or
Ecclesiastical, both which upon experience are sound to be very sad. In the
Civil state, how many divisions and fractions have broke in at this door? Even
to the dividing and breaking the nearest relations, betwixt Masters and
Servants, Parents and Children, Husbands and Wives. In the Ecclesiastical
state, in the business of the Church, what a stop, what a hinderance has this
been? The Churches sayls were filled with a fair gale for Reformation, but this
Remora how has it stayed her course? Besides, what an inlet has it been to
all sorts of pernicious Errors and Heresies, wherewith this Land at this day is
annoyed as much as Egypt ever was with Lice, or Flies?

3. 3. People withdrawing without ever consulting with their Ministers.
To these I might add the apparent unadvisednesse in the greatest part of the
followers in this way, of whom I cannot say that ever I yet knew any that came
to advise and consult with their own Ministers (though Orthodox and pious)
about the warrantablenesse of withdrawing from them and their Ministry, before
such time as they were actually alienated from them, and engaged against them.
Now whether this be an advised course or no, I dare leave it to the world to
judge.

And thus you have heard this Indictment traversed with as much brevity as
conveniently might be. The issue of it is no more but this. If there be amongst
us a Separation from a true Church, and that both voluntary and unwarrantable,
(which I suppose the evidences given in have sufficiently evicted) then must we
give sentence, that here is more then either Crimen nominis, or Nomen criminis,
then either the Crime of a name, or the Name of a crime, no less then a Schism
formally and properly so called.

And if so, then suffer the stream of this Exhortation to pass on a reach or
two further.

In the second place I might apply my self and this truth, Use 2. Exhortation
to such as are withdrawn, that they would return.
to those of our Brethren and Sisters, who are already fallen under the guilt of
this indictment: Entreating and beseeching them in the Name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, that they would entertain thoughts of returning back again by the way
by which they are gone, returning to the flocks from which they have strayed,
to communion with those Churches from which they are departed, not persisting
and going on to shame, contemn, condemn, disquiet, hinder, endanger them, as by
this their practice they do, and must do. But I have little heart to spend my
tongue in speaking unto them, who have less heart to lend an ear to hear what
is spoken. And therefore let me direct my speech unto you, and that

1. Use 3.
By way of Caveat. Take you heed that you be not involved in the same guilt, A
caveat to such as yet stand. Let them take heed of being
and that whether as Principals or Accessories.

1. As Principals. Such I must conclude them to be, who deserting the Church
wherein they have been begotten unto God, and nourished and brought up for God,
shall join themselves to any of these separated bodies, holding communion with
them in a separated way.

2. 1. Principals in
As Accessories. Such may Magistrates be by their Toleration, and connivence.
If they shall not improve their Authority which God has put into their hands
for the staying of the course of so great an evil. 2. Accessories to this evil.
Nec pro ^is aliquid promulgasse quis invenitur, nisi Apostata Iulianus, cui pax
and unitas Christiana nimium displicebat. August. contra Parmen. lib. 1.
Iulianus Apostata Donatistis Basilieas restituit. Marg. ibid.
Much more if they shall improve it to the abetting and countenancing of it:
then which they cannot lightly do a greater disservice to the Church. It is
noted by Augustine of Julian the Apostate, (the worst of men) and, that as none
of his best acts, that he, and he alone of all the Emperors, favored the
Donatists (those famous Schismatics) indulging them their liberty, restoring
to them their Basilicas, their Cathedral meeting places, which before had been
sequestered, and confiscated. All which, he did not out of any love that he bare
to their way, but out of an envy which he bare to the peace and unity of the
Church.

And such may Ministers be. Not only by being active in this way, (which for
the most part some of that coat still are. Veteres scrutans historias inventre
non possum scidisse Ecclesiam praeter cos qui sa cerdotes a Deo positi fuerant
and prophetae. Hieron. in Hos. 9. 8.
It was Jeromes observation, that in all his reading he could never find the
Church rent by any Schism, but still the Ministers had a chief and principal
hand in it. An office very incongruous, and unsuitable to our office. God has
made us Pastors to gather his flock, not to scatter it. Not only so, but when
by their sinful silence, their politic reservednesse, their not appearing
against it, they shall suffer so great an evil to grow to an head. Which they
ought not to do out of what ever respects they bear to the persons of any that
are engaged in it, or appear for it. Paul wanted no true affection unto Peter,
and yet when he saw him fallen in^o that unwarrantable Separation, he would not
forbear him. No, he withstands him to the face, Gal. 2. 11. Reproving him
openly, Verse 14. And this he did not fainedly, and in show only; (as Jero^^
construes that phrase (...), [ to his face] as if it had been a packt business
betwixt Peter and him, for which misconstruction he is justly taken up by
Augustine) but seriously and ex animo; so the next words declare it, [ For he
was to be blamed, Verse 12.]

Such may Husbands be by permitting their Wives (so far as they can hinder it)
to join where themselves will not, dare not. Such may Parents, and Masters of
Families be by permitting Children and Servants to engage in such unwarrantable
ways, whilst they are under their tuition. And such may private persons be
not only by yielding maintenance, or countenance; but even by affording their
presence in an ordinary and constant way at such meetings, whereby the open
profession and practice of Separation, there is a flag of defiance held forth
to the rest of the Churches. Use 3. Labor to heal this, and prevent the like
evil. Odi operosas compositiones, Crato.
Now then in the fear of God take we heed every of us how we entangle our
selves in the guilt of this Evil.

On the other hand, do what we may for the healing of this, and the preventing
of the like.

Quest. What shall we do?

Ans. In answer to this, I shall not multiply directions for either, having
ever been of the mind of that famous Physician, who never approves those
operosas compositiones (as he calls them) such medicines as are compounded of
too many several ingredients: Besides, The healing of Isreal's breaches, printed
Anno 1642. Mr. Buroughs Irenicon.
it is a work which my self have some time since done in this place, in showing
you how Isreal's breaches might be healed. And since that, I find it done more
amply by some other hands.

Take a word or two for each.

Quest. What shall be done for the former, for the healing of this Division,
this Separation.

Ans. Here I shall not meddle with what civil restrictions may be conceived to
be necessary or expedient in such a case. Quest. What shall be done in way of
cure.
I know what Imperial laws were made by the good Emperor Theodosius, and
others for the suppressing of the Schism of the Donatists. But these I shall
leave to wise and Religious Authority, Answ. Civil restrictions left to
Authority. Vide Augustine. contra. Parmen. lib. 1.
which I shall be far from instigating to any ways of violence and rigor, but
where apparent and eminent necessity is for the preservation of the whole
(which was the late case of New England) in which case that may be mercy, which
otherwise were cruelty: My hopes are, and my prayers and counsels shall be,
that our Divisions may be healed in another way, a way of gentleness and
sweetness. For that end follow me a little.

Two ways of Cure there are practiced by Physicians, the one is Paracelsus
his, the other Galens; the former to cure similia similibus, like with like:
the other, contraria contrariis, one contrary by another. And we shall find
them both useful in this Cure.

For the former; 1. Similia similibus.
here is a Division, a Separation, let it be cured by a Division, by a
Separation.

1. 1. Cure Division by Division.
Cure this Division by a Division. Thus Physicians oft-times cure bleeding at
the nose by Revulsion, by opening a vein in another part of the body: A topical
remedy, very proper for this place (and so I conceive for many other in the
Kingdom) where one pretended ground of this Division, is the numerousnesse of
the Congregation. Now let there be a Division to heal this Division: A Division
which may be orderly to heal this which is disorderly: A Division warranted by
Authority to heal this which is made without, and against it.

2. 2. Cure Separation by Separation.
And (secondly) Let there be a Separation for the healing of this Separation.
Thus Physicians sometimes cure fluxes with Purges, by carrying away the noxious
and peccant humor, which caused that Dysentery. A remedy very proper both for
this and all places in the Kingdom. The chief pretended ground of this Schism
it is out unwarrantable mixtures in Church Communion. Now let this Separation
(in the name of God) be cured by a Separation. This Separation which is
irregular, let it be healed by one that is regular, viz. by a due purging of
all the Congregations in the Kingdom, making a due separation, between the
precious and the vile; that so such may not be received to Church Communion,
who are apparently unworthy of it. This (I presume) is the great design of all
the Religious party in the Kingdom at this day. And truly till it be in measure
effected, we cannot expect a healing of our Divisions: And therefore all of us
further it what we may; only observing our stations, public persons in their
place, and private persons in theirs: And the Lord herein give a blessing to
the desires and endeavors of his servants.

Which if they be not every ways so successeful at the first, as might be
desired, yet take we heed of stumbling at those imperfections. Who art thou
that dispisest the day of small things? Zach. 4. 10. Ezekiel. 24. 6.
May we but once see this Pot beginning to boil out her scum, see these
Churches in a way of purging themselves, let us acknowledge God in these
beginnings, quietly waiting upon him for the completing and perfecting of his
own work in his own way and time. Here is the former way of cure.

2. 2. Contraria contrariis. Cure division by unity.
The later is to cure one contrary by another. And this we shall also find
proper in this case. Here is confusion, and how shall that be cured, but by
Order? Here is Division, how shall that be cured but by Unity? viz. By setting
up one way for the Churches to walk in. For this we have a promise. I will give
them one heart, and one way. This God will do for his people. Ier. 32. 39.
Pray we for the performance of it to us. This we have most of us engaged our
selves by Covenant to endeavor: viz. To bring all the Churches in these three
Kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in Religion and Government,
etc. And this let us earnestly contend for, that there may be but one way
amongst us, (and that Gods way); one way of Worship, and one way of Government.
This latter ( viz. Discipline) it is the Churches hedge, which is of use (as
for other ends, An established Discipline the only way to cure our Divisions.
so) to keep her sheep from scattering. No way so probable to heal our
divisions, and confusions as the establishing of this. In the second days work
of the Creation when there was nothing but a Chaos, a confused Mass, Heaven
and Earth mingled together, God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of
the Waters. O that Authority would now say the same in this Kingdom at this
day. In this second day of Reformation what a Chaos of Confusion is there upon
the face of this Kingdom, Genesis 1. 6.
by reason of the multiplicity of divisions and disorders in it? O that
Authority would now say (and not say it, but do it, for such was Gods saying,
Dei dicere est facere,) Let there be a firmament, a Rakiah (as the Hebrew has
it) an Expansion, a Rule and Order, which may spread it self in a uniform way
from one end of the Kingdom to the other; and that a (...) (as the Septuagint
renders it) a Firmament, a Discipline firmly settled and established in the
Church. It is the want of this that has bred, and it is the establishing of
this that must heal our present, and prevent our future distempers.

2. 2. What shall be done in way of prevention of Schism.
That is the second (...) I propounded. Now how may that be done? How may
Schism for the future be prevented? Here also take three or four Directions
which I shall briefly propound, and so take leave of this subject.

1. 1. Take heed of lesser differences.
Take heed of lesser Divisions. Small wedges make way for great ones. Small
differences sometimes rise to divisions, and those divisions (if not healed)
grow up to Schisms, and those Schisms run out into Heresies. And therefore (as
much as may be) be we precise in keeping the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace; not leaving the beaten rode whether for doctrine or practice, unless
upon clear evidences.

2. 2. Be not over affected with novelties.
Be not over-affected with novelties, new Truths, whether such only in
appearance, or in reality. Of the latter sort (what ever noise there has been,
and is about them) few there are which this present age has yet brought forth.
As for those new Lights which have set this Kingdom on fire at this day, for
the most part they are no other then what have been taken out of the dark
Lanthorns of former Heretics, Schismatics, and Sectaries. Take we heed of
having our eyes daz^led with them, or following after them, least they prove
(as many of them already have done) to be no other but ignes fatui, false
fires, useful only to mislead those that will run after them. Not that
Christians should shut their eyes against any truth, which with good and clear
evidence is held forth unto them. Truth is lovely, and ought to be embraced in
what ever dress she comes, whether now or old. As not antiquity, so neither
should novelty be any prejudice to verity. Only take heed least whilst we
over-affect the one, we be mistaken in the other.

3. 3. Take heed of Scandals
Take heed of Scandals. Whether of Giving, or Receiving. Of Giving, to drive
off others. Of Receiving, to set off our selves. The former will come, must
come. But, Woe be to the man by whom they do come. 1. Of giving. Matt. 18. 7. 1
Cor. 10. 32.
And therefore have a care every of us to demean our selves in regard of our
personal walkings inoffensively, and that toward all. Give none offense,
neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.

And being wary not to give, 2. Of taking. 1 Cor. 13. 7
be not ready to receive. Doubtful matters still construe them in the better
part. So does Charity. It believes all things, hops all things: that is, if
credible, if possible. Not looking upon the infirmities of Brethren, or
blemishes of Churches through multiplying, or magnifying Glasses, so as to make
them more, or greater then they are. But (so far as may be without sin) hide
them, cover them. With Shem and Japhet go backwards, and cast a garment upon
this nakedness. Genesis 9. 22.
Cursed Cham he espies the nakedness of his father, and makes sport with it.
Let not Christians dare to do the like by the nakedness of their mother.

4. 4. See God in our Congregations.
In the fourth place. Labor to see, and acknowledge God in our Congregations.
There he is, dwelling betwixt the Cherubins, walking in the midst of his golden
Candlesticks, manifesting the presence of his grace in the midst of his
Ordinances, by a lively concurrence, and effectual operation with them, and by
them. If we see him not, suspect our selves least the God of this world have
blinded our eyes with prejudice or unbeleef. Certainly some vail, some film or
other there is over our eyes. Genesis 28. 16, 18.
Now if he be here, how dare any withdraw? When Jacob apprehended God present
with him at Bethel, (surely the Lord is in this place) he sets up his pillar
there. Are we convinced that God is present in our Congregations? Have we our
selves had some clear and comfortable visions of God there? Have we met with
him, had communion with him in his Word and Sacraments there? Why do we not set
up our pillar here? How dare any forsake that Church, which God has not
forsaken?

True, were it is, that the glory of the God of Israel were gone up from the
Cherub, Ezekiel. 9. 3.
to the threshold of the house, (as Ezekiel saw it in his vision) that God
should make it manifest by clear evidences, that he were about to withdraw, and
depart from his Church in this Kingdom, then for us also to entertain thoughts
of withdrawing, there might be some plea for it. But so long as he dwells
betwixt the Chorubias, manifesting his presence amongst us in a constant way,
and in a gracious manner, 2 Cor. 3. 18.
so as we may with open face (as the Apostle speaks) behold as in a glass,
(the glass of the Gospel) the glory of the Lord: In this case for us to
withdraw communion with them, with whom God is pleased to hold so gracious a
communion, how shall we answer it? But I hasten.

5. 5. Despise no^ the day of small things.
In the fifth place. Take heed (of what I touched upon before) of despising the
day of small things. What if the foundations of the second Temple be not so
large, so august and stately as the former was? What if the present Reformation
do in some things fall short of the pattern, and of what was expected and hoped
for? Yet be not discouraged, be not discontented with these weak beginnings,
Zach. 4. 10.
be not distasted with these imperfections, so as to cast of all because we
have not what we would have. So indeed do children, but so let not Gods
children do, who should be content with, and thankful for their fathers
dispensation, though their portion be not so large as themselves could have
wished.

6. 6. Have not the persons of men in admiration Jude 16.
And lastly, Take heed of having the persons of men in admiration. This it was
which occasioned all these Divisions in this Church of Corinth, they had the
persons of men in admiration; being taken with the gifts and parts of their
Teachers, some addicted themselves to one, others to another, making themselves
their Disciples. I am of Paul, and I am of Apollo, 1 Cor. 1. 12.
etc. Take we heed of being taken in the same snare. Let not our eyes be so
dazeled with what ever eminency of parts, or graces, which we apprehend to be
in others, that we should set up their examples for our Rules. This it was that
drew many of the Jews (and Barnabas amongst the rest) into the Error of an
unwarrantable Separation; Gal. 2. 12, 13.
they saw Peter a leading man, a prime and eminent Apostle going before them.
And surely this it is which has misled many a well meaning soul in this
Kingdom, drawn them into the same error, to separate from their Brethren,
because they have seen some prime leading men, whose persons they honor, (and
that it may be deservedly), to go before them. And this is the main Loadstone,
the principal attractive that inclines them to look that way. No wonder in this
case, if they be subject to miscarry. So has many a ship done by following her
Admiral, which carried the Lanthorn in a dark night, not heeding her own course
as she should have done, both have been bilged upon the same shelf. A dangerous
thing it is to shape our course by another compass. And therefore (to draw to
a conclusion) take we heed how we look too much at man, what ever he be. It was
Paul's resolution concerning those who seemed to be somewhat, men of reputation,
such as the Apostles were (for of some of them he there speaks), Gal. 2. 6.
What ever they were (says he) it makes no matter to me; God accepts no
man's person. It is rule, not example, a divine Rule, not a Humane example that
we are to walk by. Let this be our guide, the Rule of the Word. Being led
thereby, now are we in the way to peace, and that both inward, and outward,
with God, our selves, others. As many as walk according to this Rule, Gal. 6.
16.
Peace shall be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.

And thus I have at length dispatched the negative part of this Apostolical
Obtestation or Charge: Wherein if any conceive I have dwelt too long, I shall
make them amends in handling of the latter part of the Text, the Positive part
of this Charge, which I shall pass over with as much brevity as possibly may
be.

That ye all speak the same thing, and that ye be perfectly joined together in
the same mind, and in the same judgement].

We have here the Apostles Exhortation, The Apostles Exhortation to unity. A
threefold unity.
which in one word is to (that which we so much at this day in this Kingdom
want) Unity. A threefold unity, consisting in three particulars; in Tongue, in
Heart, in Head. So Calvin and Beza distinguish the parts of this Gradation. In
Tongue, [That ye all speak the same thing.] In Heart. [That ye be perfectly
joined together in the same minde]. In Head, [And in the same judgement]. So
the Apostle here places them in a retrograde Order. Beginning first with that
which in order of nature is last. Tongue-unity flows from Heart-unity, and
Heart-unity from Head-unity. Men first agree in judgment, think the same
thing: Then in Affection, minding the same thing; then in Language, speaking
the same thing. The Apostle here goes backwards, ab imis ad summa, from the
bottom to the top, from the stream to the fountain, from the effect to the
cause. And in that method I shall follow him; beginning with the first.

1. 1. Tongue-unity. That Christians may speak the same thing.
Tongue-unity. Such a unity should all Christians, specially the Members of the
same Church strive after, and labor for. A unity of tongues. This is that
which Paul wishes for his Romans, Romans 15. where he prays, that they might
with one mouth glorify God. And this is one thing which here he so earnestly
begs for, from these his Corinthians, (...), That ye all speak the same thing.
Romans 15. 6.


(...). The same thing both for Substance, and Expression. Christians should
have an eye to both.

1. 1. For substance.
For substance, that they may speak the same thing, though it be in different
Language. So did the Apostles at the day of Pentecost, Acts 2. They spoke
diverse Languages, but the same thing. A remarkable difference betwixt that
division of Tongues at Babel, and this at Jerusalem. At Babel they spoke
different things as well as different words. One speaks of Brick, another
answers him with Mortar. But at Jerusalem the Apostles however they spoke
different Languages, yet they all spoke the same thing, all Preached the same
Gospel, delivered the same Truths. One Language in this Kingdom, how desirable!


O that there were such an happy unity amongst us at this day in this Kingdom!
That there were but one Language to be heard in this Island. One Language
amongst Ministers, amongst people.

Ministers, 1. Amongst Ministers. Acts 14. 12. Iere. 15. 19. Luke 1. 70. Acts
3. 18, 21.
they are by their office speakers, (as it is said of Paul, he was the chief
speaker). Gods Mouth to his people. Thou shall be as my mouth. O that this
mouth might still speak the same thing; having but one Tongue in it: A mouth
which should have more tongues then one in it, we would look upon it as a
strange monstrosity. O let it not be said, or thought that the Mouth of God
should have so. One Mouth. So runs the phrase of Scripture. As he spoke by the
mouth (not mouths) of all his holy Prophets. One tongue for one man. 1 Timothy 3.
8. Diodate ad loc.
And one Tongue.

One Tongue for one man. It is one of Paul's qualifications which he requires in
a Deacon, he must not be (...), Double-tongued; speaking sometimes one thing,
and sometimes another. A foul blemish to a Minister of Christ to be so; to
speak one thing to day, another tomorrow, to say and unsay, to have more
tongues then one. If all should speak the same thing, then much more the same
man. But that by the way.

One tongue for all. One Tongue for all.
That all the Ministers of Christ might speak the same thing, the same Truths
for substance: so as though they deliver several points of Doctrine, yet they
may be such as are no way repugn^^ to another, or to the Truth. Truth we are
sure is but one, Error be various. And the Word of Truth (as Saint James
calls the Gospel Preached) it is no more. Iam. 1. 18. Ephesians. 4. 4.
It is but one Word. One Faith, one Baptism (says the Apostle), one Doctrine
of Faith.

How is it then that amongst us there should be more then one? Division of
tongues amongst us a sad presage.
How is it that not only Parlors, but Pulpits and Presses, ring with such a
contrariety of Doctrine? And that not only in some smaller differences, (as in
the Interpretation of an obscure Text of Scripture, or the like, wherein men
sometimes may safely disagree, each abounding in his own sense); but in points
if not of, yet near the Foundation, Surely a sad hearing, presaging no good to
the Church, or cause of God in this Kingdom. This it was (as I have said) which
hindered the building of Babel. And surely, hence it is that the building of
our Sion rises no faster. Our Tongues, the tongues of the builders are
divided. D. Hall, Contemplat. Babel.
O how happy were it for us, and for the Church of God, did we all speak but
one Language! Whilst we thus differ (says one truly) we can build nothing but
Babel. Difference of Tongues caused their Babel to cease, but it builds ours. A
truth, whereof we have lamentable experience at this day. O what a Babel is
this our Sion at this day turned to, all through this confusion of Languages;
because all do not speak the same thing, 2. Amongst people. New Annot. in Genesis
11. See Mr. Edwards Gaugraena.
not Ministers.

Much less people. Among them how many several Languages to he heard at this
day? More then ever there were at Babel. At Babel some conceive that one Tongue
was divided into seventy two Languages, But our divisions far exceed that
number. At Babel others conjecture that there were as many tongues as several
kinreds and families. With us there are more. Kinreds and Families being
subdivided. The husband speaking one thing, the wife another; the parent one
thing, and the child another; the master one thing, and the servant another.
Thus it should not be. Christians who have one Head, should have but one
Tongue, all speaking the same thing for substance.

2. 2. Speak the same-thing for Expression.
And as much as may be for expression also. However, not affecting a
difference. A vain and dangerous affectation: so it is to decline common and
received expressions, whether laid down in the Word, or else being consonant to
it upon good ground taken up by the Church. The later of these, many ancient
Heretics took great exceptions at, and sought to make advantage of. Some words
they met with in common use in the Church, but because they did not find them
syllabically and expressly in the Scriptures, therefore they rejected them, and
with them the things signified by them. Thus the Arrians, because they found
not the word (...) Consubstantiality in the Text, therefore they rejected it,
and with it the Orthodox doctrine of the Church, touching the sons being of the
same substance with the father. And so the Sabellians because they found not
the word Trinity in Scriptures, therefore they denied the Trinity of persons in
the Godhead. Upon like ground the Photinians denied the two natures in Christ,
and the Nestorians the Hypostatical, the personal union of those two natures.
See Mr. Edwards, ibid.
Thus it was of old. And thus it is in many places of this Kingdom at this day,
where all these old rotten Errors are again revived, and raised out of their
graves; and that upon the very same pretenses. A dangerous affectation, which
Christians should beware of. Ex praecepto Apostoli quantum fieri potest, cum
illis Loqui debemus, eum quibus credere videri volumus. Pareus ad Text. Qui
novas phrases, terminos, defivitiones rerum excogitant, plerun que etiam nova
dogmata moliuntur, etc. Pareus ibid. Disagreeing in words ingendereth
dissension of mind, whereof proceeds repugnancy of judgment, which is the
mother of Schism and Heresy, Genev. Annot. in Text.
Do we believe with the Church, let us not (without just ground) refuse to
speak with the Church, in the Churches Language, and Dialect. Specially in the
phrase of Scripture.

This is that which the Ministers of Christ should affect as much as may be to
speak in that sacred Dialect. Not setting the Min^ of their Brains on work to
coin new, and high, and far-fetcht expressions, purposely to amuse the hearer,
(a practice much in use with Familists and Antinomians, and some other Sects of
the times). Of such Pareus observes truly, that giving themselves first to
find out new phrases and terms, afterward oft-times they come to broach new
Doctrines, new Opinions, and so to make Sects and Schisms in the Church. And
therefore to prevent this, the Apostle here desires his Corinthians that they
would speak the same thing. Therein (says the foresaid Author) tacitly
pointing at one of these heads from whence their Schisms, and Factions were
sprung, viz. From their different Language in and about matters of Religion.

And let this his advice to them, Applic.
be as acceptable to us as it is seasonable. That we may avoid the like evils;
in speaking of the matters of God take heed of affecting an unwarrantable and
wanton singularity. Ministers, 2 Timothy 1. 13.
hold we fast that (...), that form of sound and wholesome words, which we have
received from Christ, and his Apostles, and from the Orthodox Churches of God;
speaking the same things in the same manner that they have done before us: Not
crossing, not interfering with them, nor yet willingly with our Brethren.
Pulpit against Pulpit is next to Altar against Altar. As much as may be, let
such clashing be declined by the Ministers of Christ, whose endeavor should be,
that they might all speak the same thing. This do we.

And this do you.

Quest. Quest.
I, but how shall both we and you attain to it? How shall we come to this unity
of Language?

Answ. Answ.
Why; labor we for unity of Hearts and Minds. Anatomists tell us of an Artery
which goes from the Heart to the Tongue. If Hearts be agreed, 2. Heart-unity.
Tongues will soon be accorded. And thus I am got upon the second step of the
Apostles gradation, which leads me to the third. That ye be perfectly joined
together in the same mind, and in the same judgement]. I shall not stand long
upon either.

Only the first word will stay me a little, being a word full of Emphasis and
significancy.

(...) That ye be perfectly joined together]. The word [(...)] explained. The
proper signification of the word. (...) significat ita apt and congruenter
aliquid componere and coagmentare, ut parts inter se and cum toto congruant,
Corn. a Lapid. (...), i. e. Coadunati ac compacti ut totum quippiam quod suis
omnibus partibus apt inter sc cobaerentibus compouitur. Beza. ad Text.
Quemadmodum membra humani corporis optima symmetria inter se cohaerent. Cato. ^
loc. Perfect union desirable in a Church.
So our Translation renders it by diverse words, not knowing how fully to
express it in one. The word properly signifies Compagination, when the parts
of a thing are aptly joined together, so as they do fitly agree with the whole,
and amongst themselves. Even as it is in the body of man, wherein the Members
are all fitly joined and knit together in a due symmetry, and proportion, so as
they are each serviceable to other, and all to the whole. This is properly
(...). And this it is which Paul here begs for his Corinthians, that they might
be thus united and compacted together.

A blessing very desirable for every Church. Thus in the Church invisible
united. Col. 2. 19.
The whole body is knit together by joints and bands, having nourishment
ministered to it from the Head (as the Apostle speaks) All true Believers they
are incorporated into one Mystical body, knit together by the bands of Faith
and Love. By the one united to their Head Christ; by the other one to another:
And such a union, such a coagmentation is a thing very desirable for every
visible Church.

This it is which makes it a complete and perfect Church. Union makes a
Church complete.
So the vulgar Latin here renders the word in the Text. Sitis autem perfecti.
Be ye perfect. Then is a thing said to be perfect and complete, when it has
all the parts thus aptly and fitly put together. And thence it is that the word
(...) is sometimes used in that sense. So our Translation renders it, 2 Cor.
13. 11.
2 Cor. 13. Finally Brethren, Fare ye well, be perfect. (...). That is,
perfectly united unto Christ, and one to another, (as the Jesuit there fitly
expounds it). Corn. a Lap.


Now to this perfection and compleatnesse ( as Beza here prosecutes it) there
are two things requisite. To Church perfection two things requisite. 1. Ut pare
^nlla defit, aut superfit. 2. Ut omnia apt inter se cobaereant. Beza Gre.
Annot.
1. There must be no part either wanting, or superfluous. 2. There must be an
apt coherence and conjunction of those parts, both requisite to a complete
particular Church.

1. 1. The due parts of it.
There must be the due parts of it, none wanting, none superfluous.

1. 1. None wanting. Ecclesia per Ministerium habet Organicum quendam statum,
quoniam apta jam redditur ad omnes illas operationes exercendas quae pertinent
ad bonum totius. Ames Medul.
None wanting. There must be Ministers and People; Officers and Members;
Governors and Governed. This it is (says Dr. Ames) which gives a Church an
Organical state, which makes it an Organical perfect body, when it has all
the several parts and members belonging to it, whereby it is rendered apt and
fit to exercise such operations as tend to the good of the whole.

2. 2. None superfluous
None superfluous. Such Officers, and only such as Christ has appointed in
his Word. This is one thing which makes the Church of Rome a monstrous body,
because she has a superfluous Head. And such Members, such and only such as
are fit to join in Church Communion.

2. 2. A combination of those parts.
The second requisite is an apt combination of these parts, that they be fitly
knit and joined together: first to the Head, and secondly one to another. The
former is done by Faith, by a Profession of Faith. So it is in the Church
visible, where the Profession of Faith makes a Member and (if there be no
other bar) intitles it to all the Ordinances. The later is done by Love, by a
professed willingness and readiness to perform mutual offices each to other.
Put these together, and here is a complete visible Church for the outward frame
of it.

And O that all the Churches of Christ in this Kingdom were but thus complete!
Applicat. Seek we such perfection for all the Churches in this Kingdom.
(...), such compacted bodies, made up of all their due parts; such Officers,
and such Members, as Christ has appointed; such and no other: And that they
were so combined and knit together in the profession of the same Faith, and in
the declaration of the same mutual love each to other. How beautiful, how
glorious would this render them? Every of us in our places therefore do what we
may to bring them to this perfection.

But in the mean time not forsaking them, In the mean, time depart not from
them.
not departing from them upon pretense that they are not every ways such. It
is no good reason for a Member to leave the Body, because it wants an Eye, or a
Hand, or it may be has a finger too much, or because the parts are not put
together in such due proportion as they should he. What ever deficiency, what
ever redundancy there is at present in the Churches of Christ amongst us, yet
is it no sufficient cause for any to renounce or forsake communion with them.
No, that is the way still to render them more imperfect, which take we heed how
we be any ways accessory to; and a thing directly contrary to the Apostles
direction here in the Text, which is not for Separation, but for Coagmentatur.
Many disorders there were at this time in Corinth, but Paul does not thereupon
advise any to withdraw, but to be so much the more compacted, and combined
together. That ye may be perfectly joined together.

There is the proper signification of the word. The Metaphorical signification
of the word (...) by Physicians applied to bonefetting
But I must not so leave it: I find another sense peculiarly affixed to it.
Among Physicians this word is commonly applied to Bone-setting. When a Bone
which was out of joint was set, and put into the due place again, this in their
Language is properly (...), and (...). And in this sense (as Beza conceives)
the Apostle himself uses the word, Gal. 6. If a man be overtaken in a fault,
restore such a one. The word rendered [ restore] is the same with that in the
Text, (...) Galene est luxata membra in suum locum restituere. Beza ad Text. P.
Martyr. Gal. 6. 1.
(...), set him in joyn^ again. P. Mart. Aretius. Parcus. Observations from the
Metaphor.
And so diverse Expositors of note conceive that the word may most aptly be
understood, and taken here in the Text. That ye be perfectly joined together;
That ye may be put in joint again. An elegant and significant Metaphor, which
will give us the hint of diverse useful Observations.

1. That as there are diverse Members in a Church, so every one has his due and
proper place. Even as Bones in the Body of man every one has his proper joint,
his socket in which it turns and moves.

2. So long as they keep that place they are useful to the Body. So are bones
to the natural; and so are the members of a Church to the Ecclesiastical body.
Schismate luxantur membra Ecclesiae, Pareus ad Text. Schism a disjointing in
two respects.


3. Schism in the Church puts the members out of joint. This it is (says
Pareus) that Paul here in this word insinuates to these his Corinthians, how
that they by their Schisms had disjoynted that Church. They were thereby become
as so many bones out of joint. And very fitly may Schism be resembled hereunto.
And that (as P. Martyr goes before me) in two respects.

1. 1. Membrae luxata inepta sunt ad sua munera obeunda. P. Mart.
Because hereby the Members of the Church are rendered unserviceable, unapt and
unfit to perform such offices and duties as belong to them. So it is we see in
the natural body. A hand or foot out of joint it is no longer useful to the
body. Though active before, yet now made unserviceable through that
dislocation. And even so is it with the Members of the Church, being put out of
joint by Schism, they become unuseful to the Body, unapt to those duties and
services which before they performed. A truth whereof we have daily sad
experience in this and many other parts of the Kingdom. How is it that those
who were wont to join with the Churches of God in this Kingdom in religious
exercises, in Hearing the Word, in Prayer, Sacraments, and were so ready to all
mutual offices of love, they are now fallen off from all? Alas, they are as bones
out of joint, disjoynted by Schism, and therefore no wonder that for the
present they are no more useful to the body; which if once set in joint again,
they will be.

2. 2. Membra luxata gravissimo d^lore corpus afficiunt. P. Mart.
Bones out of joint are not only unserviceable, but painful, affecting the
whole body with grievous dolours. Thence it is that David to set forth the
greatness of his distress, he borrows this expression, All my bones are out
of joint. And such are Schisms in the Church. They are grievous things, causing
sad thoughts of heart, (as is said of Reubens Divisions): causing great trouble
and disquietment to the Church, Ps. 22. 14. Iud. 5. 15, 16
and great dolor to all the living members of it. A truth never more sadly
experimented then it is in this Kingdom at this day. O what trouble, what
disquietment has Schism procured to this Church and State! How dolorous a
thing is it to all the sensible members of this body? For Christians to see
their Brethren thus divided; to see their Mother thus set upon the Rack, and
her bones (as it were) thus put out of joint. Certainly they must be dead (at
least stupefied) members which are not sensible of these disjoyntings.

In the fear of God then suffer this word of Exhortation directed here by this
Apostle to these his Corinthians to take place with us: Applicat. Be we set in
joint again.
(...). Suffer we our selves to be put in joint again. To that end yield we up
our selves to the skill of those whom God has appointed to the Bone-setters to
his Church in this her shattered, disjoynted and broken condition: those who
are now consulting for the healing of these breaches, harkening to their
Counsels and Directions so far as they shall counsel from God, and for God,
that so through his concurring with their and our endeavors, we may yet be
restored to so happy a Unity, as to be perfectly joined together.

Q. How a Church may be perfectly joined together. The same mind and judgment
explained.
But how shall we be thus joined together?

A. Why, I have hinted it more then once. There are two bonds and ligaments
whereby the members of this body are united together. By the one they are knit
to the Head; by the other one to another. The one Faith, the other Love. And
both these Calvin conceives to meet u^ here in the Text. That ye be perfectly
joined together in the same [minde] and in the same [judgement]. The one of
these he refers to Faith, the other to Love. And not unfitly may we so conceive
of them. In all probability (as both he and Beza agree it), the Apostle in
these two words [ Mind and Judgement] intends a partition and division of the
whole soul, which consists (as we know) of these two noble and principal
faculties, the Understanding and the Will. Now the one of these words seems
to point at the one, the other at the other. Which is which, those two foresaid
Authors are not agreed. The former (says Calvin) points at the Understanding,
the later at the Will. (...) ege hic pro voluntate accipio. Calv.
Beza on the other hand. The former says he points at the Will, the later at
the Understanding. And to him I shall therein subscribe, as apprehending that
Construction both most proper for the words, and most accommodate to the place.
Wherein (as Beza conceives of it) Paul ascends by three steps; viz. from the
Tongue to the Heart, and from the Heart to the Head. The one of which (as I
told you) has a dependence upon the other: Tongue-unity upon heart-unity,
(...) Gracis idem est quod Latinis concordia, Beza Gr. An. ad Loc.
and heart-unity, upon head unity. Why do men speak the same thing? Because
they are Concordes, of the same mind, of the same heart and will. And how come
they to be of one mind, one heart? why, they are of the same judgment.
Agreement in judgment, breeds agreement in affection, and agreement in
affection, breeds agreement in speech. Fitly then may we so construe the
words here, [ mind and judgement] Taking the former as relating to the will,
the latter to the understanding, the former importing an agreement in
affection, the latter in opinion.

Both very desirable for every Church of Christ, Agreement in affection and
opinion, desirable for the Churches. Act 4. 32. Beza An. Gr. in Act. 4.
that there may be such an harmony and agreement amongst the members of it.
Such a harmony there was among the Primitive believers in the church of
Jerusalem. They were all of one heart, and of one mind, (says the Text) Act.
4 agreeing both in affection and opinion; so as there was no division, no
dissension amongst them. Such an addition, both Beza and Beda tell us, that
they find in some ancient Greek copies there. They were of one heart, and one
mind, (...), and there was no difference, [no controversie] among them. Non
erat in eis separatio ulla (so Beda renders it.) There was no separation
amongst them. O that it were so amongst us!

To that end labor we for this double unity, agreement both in affection and
opinion. Such an unity it is that Paul exhorts his Philippians to, pressing
it upon them with as much earnestness as his pen could express, Phil. 2. 1, 2.
Phil. 2. 1. If therefore there be any consolations in Christ, etc. fulfill ye
my joy that ye be like minded. There is the general exhortation, which in the
following words he subdivides into two particulars.

1. Having the same love and being of one accord, (...), as it were having one
and the same soul, dwelling in several bodies.

2* And of one mind, that is, agreeing both in affection and judgment. Such
an agreement let all the Lords people strive after; which is the second kind
of unity, which I spoke of heart unity, Agreement.

1. 1. Heart unity. Ier. 32. 39. Romans 12. 16
In affection, that they may have one heart: (That the Lord promises to bestow
upon his people, I will give them oue heart) that they may be like affected
each to other. So Paul presses it upon his Romans. Romans 12. Be of the same
mind (like affected, says the Geneva translation) one toward another. That
so they may praise God with one heart, as well as with one mouth. So Paul
prays for his Romans, Romans Romans 15. 5, 6.
15. Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one
to another according to Christ Jesus, (secundum voluntatem, and exemplum,
according to the mind of Christ, and the example of Christ) that ye may with
one mind and one mouth, glorify God. The later of these, Christians do, when
they profess and confess one and the same faith, and when they join together
in the public exercises of Religion, particularly in singing of Psalms (an
exercise which begins now to grow out of fashion, as all harmony does) now they
glorify God with one mouth. O let us strive to do the former, to glorify God
with one mind, one heart.

Quest. Quest. Oneness of heart how attained.
But how shall this blessed heart unity be attained? what shall we do, that we
may come to this oneness of heart?

Ans. 1. To this end all of us (first) labor after new-hearts. The old heart
is (like Isreal's) a divided-heart, divided from God, and divided from men,
Answ. Get new hearts, Hos 10. 2. P, Martyr ad Text.
at least ready so to be upon any occasion. So it is now become through the
corruption of nature (as P Martyr rightly observes.) Hence it is that man is
now naturally so prone to Divisions, to Sects and Schisms. From the beginning
it was not so. At the first man was created a sociable creature, affecting
communion with other of the same kind. He was then created after the Image of
God, who as he is one in himself, so he requires unity in others. How is it
then that man is so far degenerated, that he is so prone to division? why; this
is the vitiosity and corruption of his nature. As we affect unity labor to get
our hearts changed, renewed. To that end yealding them them up to the spirit of
grace, that it may work upon them for the subduing of that frowardness and
fierceness of spirit, that pride and selflove, that highmindednesse and
selfconceitednesse, that selfishnesse, which is in every man naturally more or
less. These are the grand enemies to unity. Give way to the spirit of grace
for the subduing of these: that however, they may be kept in, and kept under,
not suffered to mingle themselves with our counsels and actions. Such a holy
care Paul presses upon his Philippians, Phil. 2, 3, 4.
Phil. 2. Where having exhorted them to a holy unity, he subjoyneth by way of
direction, Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory. Look not every man
on his own things. But on the other hand. In lowliness of mind, let each
esteem other better then himself: Every man also looking upon the things of
others. Not but that Christians may look at their own things, but not
impropriate their care to them, not so look at their own profit or honor, or
ease, or pleasure, as not also to have a respect to others.

2. 2.
Above all (which might be an other direction) having a respect unto the glory
of God, Propound the same end, Gods glory.
propounding this as our chief aim. And O that Christians did but all agree in
this, their hearts all meeting in this Center, all minding this same thing,
making the glory of God the mark which they level at. No readier way to an holy
agreement then this. Quae convenient in uno tertio, etc. Lines meeting in the
Center agree there. The hearts of Christians meeting in the same God, as the
ultimate end of all their counsels and actions, it is the most direct way to
b^ing them to a holy unity.

3. 3. Walk by the same rule, the word, Phi. 3. 16.
Propounding the same end, let us also make use of the same rule. So Paul
presses it as a direction to unity. Let us walk by the same rule. The same
rule of faith and life, viz. the word. By this rule let us walk, not setting a
step, not undertaking any counsel or action, but as we have the direction of
the word for our guide and warrant.

4. 4. Be jealous of our own hearts.
Be ever jealous over our own hearts. And good reason we should be so; they
being like unto tinder or gunpowder, ready to take fire by the least spark
which falls into them, ready to take and improve every occasion that is
offered for division; ^, to take up occasions sometimes before they are let
fall, through jealousies, and suspicious misapprehensions of things. Much more
where there is a reality. Now, the least spark is enough, if not looked to, to
set them on fire. It was no great matter that Paul and Barnahas differed upon.
Only, about the taking of an associate along with them, Act. 15. 38.
John Mark, whom Barnabas thought worthy, but Paul, in regard of his late
desertion of them, not going with them to the work, adjudged unworthy of their
Communion and Fellowship. Yet the difference betwixt them rose to a height, to
no less then Separation. (...), there was a very sharp and eager contest
betwixt them (says the Text,) ver. 39.
) inso much, that they departed, [separated] the one from the other.

Brethren take we heed of dashing upon the like rock. A useful caveat.
Suppose it that a John Mark, a person one or more should be admitted to our
Communion, to the Table of the Lord, (a thing which I plead not for) whom in
your judgments you conceive not so worthy of it, in regard of some former
slips, whereby they have given just scandal (that was the proper case there)
yet let there not be a (...), an over eager contest about it, however, take
heed of separating upon it. It was a weakness in Paul or Barnabas, one or both
so to do. It will be wilfulness in you to do the like, having now had warning
of it again, and again.

5. 5.
For other directions, I might send you to that of the Apostle Ephesians. ^orbearand
^^rgive. Ephesians. 4. 31, 32. Col. 3. 12, 13.
4. 31. Let all bitterness and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil
speaking, be put away from you, with all malice. And be you kind one to
another, tender hearted, for giving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
has forgiven you. Seconded by the same Apostle, Col. 3. Put on therefore
bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering,
forbearing one another, and forgiving one another. Mark those two last,
Forbearing, and forgiving. This must Christians be much in, otherwise no hopes
of unity.

6. 6. Neglect not the sacrament, an uniting ordinance.
To these I might add. Would we be thus united, then neglect not means of
union, such means as God has appointed for that end. One chief whereof is the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper: An Ordinance of God instituted (as for other
ends, so) for the confirming and increasing of that union which is betwixt the
members of the mystical body; as betwixt the members and the head, so betwixt
the members themselves, for the knitting of their hearts together. When this
shall be offered, take heed how we slight, how we neglect it. Surely it cannot
but be conceived, that the unhappy intermission of the administration of this
Ordinance, has been not a little accessory to the increasing and heightning of
our heart-divisions. Through the mercy of God we hope you shall have it now
again reached forth to you, in a more constant and comfortable way, then
formerly. You therefore who are living members of the mystical body, who find
your hearts already in measure united unto Christ by faith, and to the Saints
by love, do you with care and conscience attend hereupon, that by this means
this your union may be confirmed and increased, that you may be perfectly
joined together.

7. 7. Labor for unity in judgment.
Take but one more. And that is that which we next meet with in the Text, in
the last clause of it, which I shall only touch upon in a word, and so
dismiss it and you. Would we be of one mind, of me heart, labor to be of the
same judgment. Surely there is a great sympathy betwixt the head and the
heart. As the one is affected, so will the other be. In vain to look for unity
in the one, where there is division in the other. True (I confess) so it
should not be. Christians though differing in judgment, yet they should be one
in affection. I, but so it will be, as long as men are flesh as well as spirit,
carrying the remainders of corruption about with them. For my own part, I must
profess, A Dream ^f the (...).
I cannot but wonder that men, and some intelligent men, should be so taken
with their own dreams, as to fancy not only ^possibility, but a fair
probability of a holy concord and agreement amongst Christians in the midst of
the greatest diversity of opinions. The Prophet Amos puts the Question, Amos 3.
3.
Can two walk together except they be agreed? And if not two, how shall twenty,
nay a hundred several and contrary opinions and ways do it? A thing contrary
to all experience. What bitter contentions have ever in all ages attended upon
these differences in Religion? For instance, I might bring in the Jews and the
Samaritans; the Arrians and the Orthodox Christians; Papists and Protestants;
Lutherans and Calvinists. Remonstrants, Contra-Remonstrants: amongst our selves
of late, Conformists and Non-Conformists; at present, Presbyterians and
Independents, (as they are called). Not to speak here of those many other Sects
in the Kingdom, many of which with little less then a mortal hatred do
prosecute each others way, if not persons, to the not only present breach and
interruption, but (unless God be the more merciful) to the utter endangering,
if not destroying of Church-peace and unity in this Kingdom.

And if a bare connivance at these divisions have already occasioned such a
combustion, Toleration of several opinions and ways destructive to unity.
what do we think would a Toleration do? A Toleration of all sorts of Sects and
Schisms, and Heresies, and Blasphemies, which is by some (and those more then a
good many) under the abused notion of Liberty of Conscience, so earnestly
pleaded for. For my own part, should this be once yielded (which I hope their
eyes shall first fail who look for it) I should look upon it as the Passingbell
to the Churches peace and glory, if not to the true Religion of God in this
Kingdom. Surely, blessed Paul was of another mind; otherwise he would not have
been so earnest with his Corinthians for unity in judgment, as well as in
affection. Never had he any thought of such a politic principle for the
according of his Corinthians, to indulge every of them their several opinions
and Ways. No, Obj. Unity in judgment not possible.
this he knew well enough was the high way to confusion. And therefore he
presses upon them unity in judgment as well as in affection. As we desire the
one, endeavor after the other.

Obj. 1 Cor. 11. 19.
Why; but it is a thing impossible that there should be such an agreement among
Christians. Such a general consent in judgment, that all should be of one
opinion. It never was so: it never will be so. Paul himself tells us expressly,
There must be Heresies.

Answ. Ans. 1. No plea for broaching, or tolerating Ueresies.
True, so there must be. It is an unavoidable evil through Satan's malice, and
man's corruption. I but so there ought not to be. So as this is no plea, no just
excuse; either for the broaching, or contenancing, or tolerating of them.

2. 2. Not simply impossible.
Neither (in the second place) is it a thing so absolutely impossible for
Christians to attain to such an agreement in the Truth. A thing in one
Congregation very possible, and or^^nary; why then impossible in many?

3. 3. Agreement in fundamentals possible and necessary.
However (in the third place) though there be some difference about
circumstantials in some points of lesser consequence and concernment, yet in
the fundamentals, the chief heads and principles of Religion, there may and
ought to be an agreement amongst the Churches of Christ. This we are sure in a
true Church is not only possible, but necessary. Such an agreement there was
in the last age betwixt the Church of England, and other Reformed Churches, as
also betwixt her own members in her own bosom. Some differences there were
about Order, Government, Discipline, Ceremonies, but for Substantials, matters
of Faith, they were agreed, witness the sweet harmony of their confessions.
And O that there were but the like concord and agreement to be found amongst us
at this day! That our differences were confined wholly to the Hem of Christ's
Garment. Such were the divisions of the last age in comparison of ours: And yet
even those divisions were then thought sad enough. What would not the godly
party on both sides, have given to have bought them of? O what then shall we do
for the healing of our present Breaches! All of us implore the help of the
great Physician, that he would undertake the cure; which if he do not, vain is
the help of man, the Church of God among us is in a lost condition. For this
mercy let the Favorites of Heaven ply the throne of Grace with their prayers,
all of us second them with the best of our endeavors; striving after a holy
unity in judgment, as much as others do after division.

To that end. Conclusion.
Whereto we have already attained (as the Apostle advises) let us walk by the
same rule. Truths upon good ground received and believed by the Churches of
Christ, Phil. 3. 15.
and our selves, hold them fast. In other things, if we be otherwise minded,
differing from our Brethren in some points of inferior concernment, let us
carry these our differences in a humble, and (as much as may be) in a quiet and
peaceable way; rather somthering our private opinions in our own breasts, then
to suffer them to break forth to set the Church on fire, to the disturbance and
breach of the public peace, which ought to be more dear to us then many of the
children of our own brains: So waiting upon God until he shall further reveal
his Truth to our selves, or others.

And thus I have with as much brevity as I could, dispatched also this latter
branch of this Apostolical Charge. Concerning which I shall now only pray,
that God by his Spirit, which is the Spirit of peace and unity, would imprint
it upon your hearts, and upon the hearts of all his people in this Kingdom.
Amen.

FINIS.
