A Declaration of the Marquess of Argyle, with the rest of the Lords, and
others of the Estates of the Kingdom of SCOTLAND.
THe Lords and others of the Committee of Estates of Scotland, according to the
great trust reposed in them, whereof they are to make account to God and His
Majesty, the next ensuing Parliament, taking into their deepest and most
serious consideration the best ways of preserving the peace of this Kingdom,
that all His Majesty's good and dutiful Subjects may enjoy their Religion,
Liberties and Laws, which God in a singular and wonderful providence has
vouchsafed them, and of the peace betwixt the two Kingdoms so unanimously and
happily established in the late Treaty of Peace, and in the Parliaments of both
Kingdoms, have faithfully (by all good means) endeavored to settle His
Majesty's Kingdoms, which through the unnatural cruelty of many disaffected
and revolted persons, were from a peaceable condition turned into a Stage-of
unexampled and unexpressable miseries to be looked upon as an horrid and
dangerous example by this Kingdom; and by their earnest supplications to His
Majesty, and their Declarations to the Parliament of England, but especially
by their earnest desires for establishing unity of Religion, and uniformity of
Kirk-Government, and by the humble offer of their mediation to remove the
unhappie differences, and quench the fire of a wasting war begun betwixt His
Majesty and his people, wherein His Majesty's Person was exposed to so great
danger, and so many thousands of his Subjects have already perished: But
finding to their great grief the success no way answerable to their
endeavors and expectations, and the trouble of the neighbor Kingdoms, and
the dangers of this Kingdom daily rising to a greater height then they by
their care, counsel, and diligence, were able to remead or obirate, they
resolve for this and other causes which exercise and heavily press the
Kingdom at this time, to call a Convention of Estates, as the only means
which might by common Counsel, consent, and resolution take the best course
for representing yet more sensibly these manifold evils and dangers, and for
overcoming by greater wisdom the difficulties which were above their power.

And for acquitting themselves in their trust, and for the safety of the
Kingdoms, they do make the same publicly known to all His Majesty's good
Subjects, that being forewarned of their danger, they may be upon their
guards, and prepared against Foreign invasion, and Intestine plots and
insurrections, and especially that the Noblemen, Commissioners of Shires and
Buroughs, perceiving greater and more apparent necessity of the Convention
then they could have wished or expected, meet in such celerity, and with such
public affection and disposition of heart, as the present condition of
affairs does require and call for at their hands, and as beseems the Lovers
of their Religion, King and Country, which are in so great danger, from
Papists, Atheists, and other degenerated Contrymen, who are no less enraged
against this Kingdom even since the late Reformation of this Kirk, then were
their Predecessors at the first Reformation of Religion, when their negotating
was so restless, and their attempts so many and malicious against the work of
God in this Land; nor is it without observation, that while His Majesty and
the Parliament of England were about a Treaty, they conspire, plot, and
practice against the Religion, Rights, and Liberties established, and against
the lives of His Majesty's good Subjects, whereby they do really manifest to
the world what the Kings Majesty against his Declarations, and his Subjects
against their confidence grounded thereupon, may look for from their malice and
power, if they shall prevail in the end.

Therefore as we cannot but acknowledge the unspeakable goodness of God for
our present deliverance, so shall we not be wanting to make mention of the due
honor and worth of those Worthies, that were the instruments thereof, and give
unto us their brotherly assistance at this time, when many of this Kingdom out
of fear to preserve themselves, their wives and children from destruction of
the sword and fire, were fled, the Enemy roaring and tryumphing, possessing
themselves of the houses, Lands and Estates of many Noblemen, Gentlemen and
others of the best affected in both Kingdoms, to whom nothing was left but
families without maintenance, honor without means, to support it, and were
under all the grievances of war.

Neither can any man of conscience or honesty, but remember the Treaty and
Declarations of both Kingdoms, which are the strongest bonds between man and
man, and Nation and Nation, before the world: no man has true zeal to
Religion that will shrink for such adversity and opposition as has been
ordinary in the like work, and has been obvious unto us since our first
undertaking; but has been always overcome by the assistance of God: how
great was the advantage the common Enemy thought they had attained, when they
followed the old maxim, DIVIDE and IMPERA; and thereby concluded, that the
greatest favor either Nation could expect, was to be the last that should be
devoured.

As for His Majesty, we earnestly entreat the Lord, that he may be furnished
with wisdom and council from above, that he be not involved in new snares, to
the indangering of himself and these Kingdoms; but that his heart may incline
to such resolutions as will contribute for settling of Religion and
Righteousness: And we hope that the Parliament of England, the Assembly of
Divines and all such in that Land as unfeignedly fear God, will not be
discouraged nor swerve in the day of temptation, but that all of them in their
stations, and according to their several places and callings, may be furnished
with light and strength for doing of their duty with faithfulness and zeal.

And it is the firm resolution of our selves, and the rest of the Godly party
in this Kingdom, (by Gods grace) never to forsake their Brethren of England;
but against all opposition with courage and constancy, to live and die with
them; and as long as there is one drop in our veins, we resolve never to
relinquish this work, but to put our confidence in the justness of the cause,
and in the invincible Power of God, trusting he will deliver us and all his
people.

Ordered that this Declaration be published at the Market Cross at Edinburgh,
and other Burghs of this Kingdom, for the information of all His Majesty's
good Subjects within the same.

A. P. Cler.
