AN APPEAL TO THE WORLD IN THESE TIMES OF EXTREME DANGER.
THe variety of dangers, unto which this Parliament, and in it this Kingdom
is now subject, and the manifold distempers, which are the causes of these
dangers, together with the multiplicity of those evil influences, which are
the causes of these distempers, as also the great mischiefs and miserable
destruction, not only threatened, but really intended, and at this time
attempted against this Parliament by the Manassites of the times, has
necessarily occasioned this ensuing Appeal, as well to generations to come,
as to those now present.

The common and Epidemicall disease wherein this Kingdom at this time lies now
gasping under (being filled with nothing but fears, jealousies, and
perplexities, as may be observed by the miserable complaints of all men, whose
hearts are tender of the good and welfare of the Commonwealth) has a
Superior and universal cause from the evil Counsels and wicked designs of
those, who under his Majesty threaten to carry all before them, against the
Parliament, and all others who will not stoop to the illegal demands of the
King: These evil influences has been formerly the cause of the preparations
for War wirh Scotland, and the procuring a rebellion in Ireland, and now is the
cause of distractions and divisions betwixt the King and his faithfullest
Subjects; and of procuring preparations of War here in England, by his Majesty
seduced by wicked Counsel, principally aiming first at Hull, and then at
London, which are become the objects of the Kings hatred, not excluding the
Parliament.

The Parliament is the foundation and basis of Government, and consequently of
the peace and happiness of the Kingdom; as it creates the Law by which we are
ruled and governed in peace and quietness; so it preserves the Law in power
and authority: It has not only power and authority to preserve good Laws
being made, but also to create such new Laws, as by which the Kingdom may be
ruled and governed in peace, and also to repeal such Laws as are opposite to
the peace and prosperity of the same, all Laws lying at their feet, to use them
for the best advantage for the King and Kingdom. First for the King, to reduce
him from that seduced condition wherein he is: And secondly, for the Kingdom,
to rescue and deliver it from those dangers and miseries it is liable to at
this time, by reason of his Majesty so seduced.

For all the power which Princes have, is but derivative and secondary: The
fountain and efficient cause is the people, and from hence the inference is
just; The King, though he be singulis major, yet he is universis minor, for if
the people be the true efficient cause of power; it is a rule in nature,
Quicquid efficit tale, est magis tale, And hence it appears, that at the
founding of Authorities, when the consent of societies convayes rule into such
and such hands, it may ordain what conditions, and prefix what bounds it
pleases, and that no dissolution ought to be thereof, but by the same power by
which it had its constitution.

And as for the final cause of Princes power, or Regal Authority, his Majesty
does not in any of his papers deny, that the same people are the final cause,
which is the efficient cause of it, and indeed it were strange, if the people
in subjecting it self to command, should aim at any thing but its own good in
the first and last place, Power originally being thus inherent in the people,
which is nothing else but that might and vigor which such or such a society of
men contains in it self, and when by such or such a Law of common cons^nt and
agreement it is derived into such and such hands, God confirms that Law, and
so man is the free and voluntary Author, the Law is the Instrument, and God is
the establisher of both: Therefore not that Prince which Tyrannizeth over his
Subjects, but that Prince which rules, and is most Po^ent in his Subjects, is
indeed most truly Potent.

Now if Kings are so inclinable to follow private advice rather then public,
and to prefer that which closes with their natural impotent ambition, before
that which crosses the same, are without all limits; Then they may destroy
their best Subjects at pleasure, and all Charters, and Laws of public safety
and freedom are void, and God has not left humane nature any means of
sufficient preservation.

But on the contrary, if there be any benefit in Laws to limit Princes, when
they are seduced by wicked counsels, and will not hearken to the great
Counsel of the Land, doubtless there must be some Court to judge of that
seducement, and some Authority to enforce that judgment, and that Court and
Authority must be the Parliament, or some higher Tribunal; now none are so
ignorant to affirm, a King in his single person is a Court (either in time of
Parliament, without his Parliament, or out of Parliament, in his own person
alone) to judge in any cause, nor his mere fancy authority sufficient to
enforce judgment in any cause, much less, nay altogether is he unfit either
to judge of his own seducement, or to enforce such a judgment by any
Authority, though he were not seduced, for the King is not above the Law, but
in subjection to it, his mere will being not the rule of the Law, but the Law
the rule of it, therefore the will of a King is not an unlimited will, and in
case a King be seduced by wicked Counsel, and will not rule by Law, nor
heathen to the Petitions of his three kingdoms, then the Law is free to reduce
him.

Now it is not unknown to all the world, how powerful and active the wicked
counselors about his Majesty has been, and still are, for the accomplishment
of their own ends, seeking to destroy and extinguish that power, the true
Religion, the Liberty and Laws of the Kingdom, by many traitorous endeavors,
from time to time. First to keep off Parliaments, then either to dissolve them
when they are gathered, or to raise in his Majesty a disaffection to his
Parliament, and so at last to draw him into the Northern parts from them, to
prevent all their just and lawful designs, and now infusing into his mind
such false reports, as has raised in him an inveterate hatred against them and
all others who will not assist him in his demands and designs, publishing in
his name diverse ignominious reproaches against the Parliament, in king his
Majesty's Court a Sanctuary for all kind of Delinquents, against the justice
and lawful privilege of Parliament, and drawing to Torke by Letters, and
other means, diverse Members of both Houses, whereby they set up a counterfeit
imaginary visage of a Parliament, to the great danger, not only of the
disturbance, but even of the subversion of the fundamental constitution and
frame of this Kingdom.

Now whether this Parliament has not to this day vvatched over our Religion,
the Liberty and Laws, of this Kingdom, the preservation of his Majesty's
person from the wicked designs of his and our enemies; and that with great
care, labor, and industry, to the hazard of their lives and fortunes, let the
world judge. If they should call heaven and earth, God and man to witness
the same, they might do it with a more safer and peaceable conscience then,
etc.

There needs no other Plea for them, than those good and legal Votes,
Ordinances, Remonstrances, Declarations, and Pititions, which has issued from
them since his Majesty's absence; since which time he has refused to assist
them in their lawful Designs, for the settling of the three Kingdoms in peace
and prosperity: but has rather hearkened to the destroying Counsels and
reproachful speeches of the Ishmaelites of the Times, as the effects does
declare, to the saiuing of the spirits of his best and most faithful Subjects
of his three Kingdoms, laying all the blame upon the Parliament. Indeed, if
there be any thing in them blameworthy, certainly its only their too much
lenity and patience toward those offenders, who have been the prime causers
of all those distractions, namely the Prelates, who have been formerly accused
of High Treason by both Houses of Parliament, and since they have taken bail
for all or most of them; the evil effects whereof has lately appeared, in the
practice of one amongst the test, to wit, that Archenemy Jo. Eborac. who is ^ow
gone to York in a Warlicke manner, and for ought that can be gathered, to
assist the King (seduced by evil Council) in his intended war against the
Parliament, whose adherents have, and still do foment nothing but threats
against those, whom the Kingdom of England confideth in, and has chosen to be
their guide, Resolving not only to obey them in all their just and lawful
Commands; but also to defend them against all illegal oppositions what or whosoever they are, witness their frequent free and larg bring^ng in of money,
plate, and horse, and also their acknowledgements, published in the Petitions
of most of the Counties of Endland, as may hereafter (in time convenient) be
printed together, and compared wi^h a few Collections of Pititions; many of
which collections are pretended (though falsely) to have been delivered to his
Majesty, and others to his Privy Council; To instance one amongst the rest
(viz.) That false Petition of the Nobility, Gentry, Burroughes, Ministers, and
Commons of Scotland, delivered to his Majesty's most honorable Privy Council;
and printed at his Majesty's Printing House, to delude the world, and make them
beleve it was a true Petition. Now let all the world judge whether his
Majesty's intentions can be good, and whether it be not below himself, to
suffer such things to pass in silence, without requiring ( from the
Parliament) Justice to be execured upon such persons.

There has been Printed diverse times, many false, scandalous and invective
Pamphlets against the Parliament, and those who stand for the public good, and
they have never been inquired after* nor complained of to the Parliament from
York, or those parts; To instance some few of late, (viz.) the New Orders of
the Parliament of Roundheads, the Round Heads race, the Wardens Speech, the
Declaration or Resolution of the County of Hereford, with many more, which
might be named, and shall if need require; and as for the new Orders of the
Parliament of Roundheads, it was observed that John Thomas, (for whom it was
Printed, as is credibly reported) was known to set out of London for York
that very day it was published, and there resides to send to his wife to Print
here in London, whatsoever is there Printed in York; but as for such Books
which ha^ve been Printed, or such Sermons which have been preached, for, and
in the behalf of the Parliament, justifying their legal and righteous
proceedings; The Authors, Printers, and Publishers thereof, must be found out
and proceeded against by Law, as Treasonable, Factious, Seditious,
Schismatic, and I know not what persons.

These things being premised and compared together, an Appeal is here made to
the whole world, for the vindication of the Parliament, in Six particulars, to
consider of and judge.

1. Whither the Parliament has protected any such Preachers and Pampheteers at
any time (as is unjustly laid to their charge) (when it has bin discovered to
them who and what they are) by stopping the course of Justice from taking place
against them, it they have been proved Treasonable, Factious, Seditious, or
Schismatic.

2. Whether the end of such con^^i^ance, or taking notice of such false
scandalous Pamphlets, be not purposely intended to suffer the affections of his
Majesty's subjects to be drawn away from the Parliament, that so an utter
extirpation of the v^ry being of Parliaments, may be obtained, as well for
future Generations, as for the time present. For it is well known, that if
this Parliament could once, be either exringuished, or its power weakened,
which is all one; Then all will be at the Kings mere Will, and the mercy of
His and the Parliame^ts Enemies. Nothing then will stand in their way to oppose
them; but a flood of violence will run over and cover the whole surface of
the Kingdom, and carry away all, both present enjoyments, and future hopes of
Religion, Liberty, and whatsoever else is precious and dear to the whole
Kingdom.

3. Whether it has not been (since this Parliament first begun) the policy
of evil Counselors (who are the greatest enemies the King and the three
Kingdoms can possibly have) to strike at Parliaments, or divide Parliaments,
by making factions, and casting in Diversions and Obstructions to hinder and
interrupt the proceedings of the same, and to persuade the King so to do,
whose advice and counsel he has adhered unto, as evidently it does appear by
the evil effects that has followed thereupon, to wit, the causeless division
betwixt him and his Parliament continuing solong, that it has caused a very
great jealousy of much danger and misery, suddenly to come upon this Kingdom,
if it be not speedily prevented by the wisdom of the Parliament, and the
concurrence of the well disposed Subjects of the Kingdom; the which if they
shall so do, they will manifest to the world, that they are carried by no
other respect, but of the public good, which should always be preferred
before their own lives and fortunes.

4. Whither there has not been a Succession of designs against the
Parliament, first, to awe it, secondly, to take away the freedom of it by the
terror of an Army, and then to bring force against it actually to assault it;
witness his Majesty's coming to the House of Commons, in such a manner, and
with such a troop to demand those five Members, which He accused of High
Treason, and other misdemeanors, which is judged by both Houses of Parliament,
to be a high breach of their Privileges. The deliverance of which Members at
that time, the whole world is Appealed unto, whether an Annual day of
Thanksgiving ought not to be kept unto God through the whole Kingdom of great
Britain: for as much as at that time it was seared (and that not without
cause) an intent was with the sword to cut in sunder this only Band, with
ties, and knits up King and People together in one firm and indissolvable knot
of Peace and Unity.

5. Whether the Obstrucing the proceeding of the Parliament were not absolutely
intended; first by the Rebellion in Ireland, to the consuming of that Kingdom;
the heads of which Rebellion, many, if not most of them, were transported into
Ireland by the Kings special Warrants; the names of which Rebels may be seen
in an Answer of both Houses to the Kings Message, sent to him, March 16. 1641.
which Answer was set forth by their Authority, to be Printed and published.
Secondly, whether the hindering of the proceedings of Parliament were not
absolutely intended, by the distempers, distractions, and jealousies fomented
here at home to tear out the bowels of this Kingdom; the Parliament being by
that means disabled from helping it; witness that Master piece, whence all
the rest receive countenance and support, (viz.) His Majesty's absence from,
and not agreeing with his Parliament, but withdrawing his influence, whereby
such remedies could not be applied as was necessary, but what was done, it was
with infinite trouble to the Parliament, and excessive charge to the Subject,
double and treble, what otherwise would have served the turn. So the Subject
is grieved and oppressed with charge, and the blame of all is laid upon the
Parliament, as being unjustly charged to be the cause of all those evils,
which the Authors of them have made.

6. And last Appeal, Whether the wicked practices of enemies at home and a
broad are not the cause of hindering the Parliament from their Actings and
Operatings toward the settling of the great Affairs both of Church and State,
and providing for the defense and safety of his Majesty and his Kingdom,
both from foreign Invasions abroad, and secret stirrings of the discontented
party at home.

Unto this last Appeal, there are several particulars as gradations to
Confirm the same, and left to the World to Judge.
1. When the Parliament was in a fair way, by the blessing of God, to wade
through, and overcome those difficulties which lay in their way. Then there was
an Assay made by the Malignant party, to weaken the proceedings and power of
the Parliament, utterly to subdue it; first, by his Majesty's departing from
his Parliament, in such a manner, as gives all his loving Subjects just
occasion to suspect He intends not good to His three Kingdoms; and then by
gathering of Forces, commanding a Garrison of soldiers to be put into New
castle, under the command of the Earl of New Castle, who should have formorly
seized upon Hull, had he not by the providence of God, giving wisdom to the
Parliament to prevent him, and sundry Commissions granted by his Majesty for
the raising of Horse, and diverse Officers being thereunto appointed; likewise
his Majesty upon a Monday morning, being the fourth of July, came to Beverly
with an Army of a considerable number, of horse and foot, and some Regiment of
Trained bands commanded to be raised, amongst which Soldiers in this Army,
are diverse Papists, and other persons of desperate fortunes, ready to execute
any rapine, violence, and opptession, besides several troops of horse were
sent into Lincolnshire, to the great terror of the well affected people, who
are thereby forced, either to forsake their dwellings, or to keep them with
armed men. Now in these, and many more which might be instanced, here is an
Appeal made to the world, whether his Majesty intends not the subversion of
the Parliament, together with the distuction of the whole Kingdom, and has
not already begun the war.

2. Consider under what vain pretenses his Majesty is pleased to gather
forces at York, (viz.) to have a Guard for his Person, as if his ordinary
Guard was not as sufficient to protect his person there, as they were when he
was at White Hall, there being no other cause of fear then was here near
London, unless himself produces the causes. For if there be any cause of
fear, it may rather arise from the Parliament, lest his Cavaliers and his
Counselors there about him take away his Majesty's life, when they have
accomplished their own ends by his means, for fear lest he should not prove as
faithful to them hereafter, as is feared he has not to those now who have
ever proved faithful to him at all times, and upon all occasions, and never
gave cause at any time why he should be so opposite to the Parliament, and by a
strong hand to support Delinquents, in such a manner, that no order of the
Parliament can be obeyed, but rather slighted, and scorned: Witness the Report
of his Majesty's Cavaliers upon Haworth Moore at York, June 3. 1642. as may be
seen in a Letter sent from York to a friend in London, declaring that they
were wholly for the King, against the Parliament. Whereupon the County of York
being summoned by his Majesty to appear that day, to propound some things to
their considerations, and nothing was then propounded to require their Answer,
they went away very much unsatisfied and discontented. Yet before they
departed, in answer to those Cavaliers they declared unto them, That they came
not with any intent or resolution to divide the King and Parliament, nor would
they ever condeseend thereunto.

3. When the Parliament understood by evident demonstrations, that the King
seduced by evil counsel, intended to make War against the Parliament, the
doing whereof is enough to destroy both Himself and his posterity for ever,
from enjoying any of his three Kingdoms hereafter. Then they petitioned his
Majesty to disband all such forces as were by his command assembled, and to
rely for security upon the laws and affections of his People, as his
Predecessors have done before him, etc. notwithstanding it is evidently seen he
proceeds in his illegal courses against the Parliament, making good every
day more and more the expressions of his Cavaliers, expressed upon
Heworth-more, and now has set forth a Paper in form of a Declaration, and
printed at York, and reprinted at London for Robert Young, wherein is expressed,
that He will defend every one of them, and all such as shall refuse any
Commands, whether they proceed from Votes and Orders of both Houses, or any
other way, from all dangers and hazzards whatsoever, and yet he further
declares in the same Paper, that He will not engage any in a War against the
Parliament, except it be for his necessary defense, etc. If this be not to
delude the World, as Himself is deluded, let the World judge whether his
intentions are not to hinder the preceedings of the Parliament in their Actings
and Operatings, toward the settling of peace and quietness in the Kingdom,
and principally intends nothing less then War against them, and his Kingdom.

His Majesty says likewise, that He will defend the true Protestant Religion,
etc. How can that possibly be believed of any wise man, seeing there is no
other means so effectual as to advise with His Parliament, for if the
Parliament would side with the King in whatsoever he would have them to do,
then there would be no greater argument to aggravate the sin of disobedience in
any person, then to disobey the Laws and Ordinances of the Parliament, which
now he so contemnes, and villifies, as is obvious to the sight of the world in
Print.

But in stead of punishing offenders against his Parliament, he causelessly
departs from them, and forbids any to obey them.

Now let the world judge whether his Majesty's expressions (which he had often
professed in his Papers) and his practices or Actions are not different; he
professes to maintain that Religion which is established by the Law of the
Land, and ye^ he is pleased to countenance and protect those against whom the
Law is principal intended.

Lastly, it appears that the enemies to the peace of the Kingdom are the
cause of hi^dering the proceedings of Parliament, by provoking and instigating
his Majesty to senseverall Papers in form of declarations and messages, and
in them expressing bitter invective speeches against the Parliament to perplex
them, and engage them in the expenc^ of time to answer those Declarations and
Messages, now let the World judge, whether i^ be not better to say less and
do more, by a speedy proceeding (according to Law) against the offenders, who,
or Whatsoever they are.

The world now is wearied out with reading of Declarations, Remonstrances and
Petetions from both Houses to the King, and with Declarations and Messages
from the King to them again, together with their replies to the King from time
to time. The Spirits of men begin now to languish, considering the malignant
party daily increases, and according to their strength such are their
designs; first cunningly to insinuate and infuse into the people (by false
colors and glosses) an evil opinion and dislike to the Parliament, and then
Jehu-like in a hostile manner to rise against the Parliament (and in it all
other Parliaments) to the ruining of them, their wives and children.

Now let the World judge, every man's conscience being appealed unto, as the
case now stands, (his Majesty being seduced by the wicked counsel of such
desperate persons, whose care, study, and industry is not only to provoke his
Majesty to be the head of their Rebellion, but also to bring the King and
Kingdom either to utter desolation, or to an Arbitrary and Tirannicall
Monarchy) whether in these extreme distractions and distempers, your lives
and all you have being in continual fear to be lost, it be better to obey a
Seduced King, then the wise representative body of the whole Kingdom, so
constituted by the Laws of the land to manage the affairs of the Kingdom.
Judge ye whether it be not better and more suitable to a good conscience to
stand or fall, live or die with the Parliament according to your protestation,
and so with your hands upon your Swords be ready at their command to perform
your vows to God, and your oaths of fidelity to his Majesty in rescuing him
from his enemies, by taking up arms to desend your selves against those false
flattering Traitors, who abuse his Majesty's Royal favor, intending (under
the glorious title of his name and Standard) to fight against the peace and
Honor of their Sovereign, against Religion and the Laws, and so make a prey
and spoil of three flourishing kingdoms at once.

Therefore quit your selves like men, and strengthen your selves in the Lord
your God, rouse up your drooping spirits, and strengthen your feeble knees, and
resolve to spend and be spent in the defense of the lives and liberties one of
another, a harmonious union in the cause of Jesus Christ is an astonishment to
the enemy, and half the victory is then obtained, delays prove dangerous, and
faint heartedness gives strength and advantage to the adversary, therefore now
if ever stand fast, and show your selves friend for your King and Parliament.

Let it appear before God and all the Nations of the world round about you,
that tru^ generous blood runs in all your veins, consider the honor and cause
of God, the good and happy success of this present Parliament, your lives,
your laws, and liberties, your Temporal and Spiritual vvelfare lies all
bleeding at your feet, earnestly supplicating your bes^ assistance: give your
consciences leave a while to expostulate with you: will you live, and the
Parli^ment die, can it possibly go well with you, whilst it goes ill with
them O no, rather purchase their life by your death, so shall you be a good
example to all generations yet to come, being considently assured there was
never a greater prize in your hands than at this time is in the Kingdom of
England, (viz.) The Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Peace of the Kingdom,
each of which, in value and estimation (in respect of enjoyment) far exceeds
all the wealth the whole world can afford: What comfort and contentment can
you take in your health, wealth, houses, lands, wife, children and friends,
when in the enjoyment of these, you are bereaved of peace and quietness with
them, when (on a sudden it may be, before you expect it) the enemy rusheth in
upon you, and presently makes your habitation desolate, ravishing your wives,
and ripping them up before your faces, using all violence and mischief upon
you, as they have done to our neighbor Nations, Germany and Ireland, and have
attempted the like upon Scotland. Therefore be entreated once more, and that
without delay, letting no opportunity slip, join your heads, hearts, and
spirits together with one consent, to present to his Majesty one Petition more,
not in the name of some particular County, but in the name of the whole
Kingdom of England, that he would be pleased to vouchsafe the influence of
his Royal presence to his great Counsel, the high Court of Parliament, that
so the bleeding wounds of this distracted England may be prevented.

Let the Kingdom of Scotland and Irelands practice induce you to it, but more
especially you London, Show not your selves so backward in this main work, you
have showed your selves most courageous and free in all other business, slack
not therefore in this great work, seeing you, O London are the chiefest object
upon whom the eyes of all the Countries are sixed. Now O England help the Lord
against the mighty, stand in your ow^^ defense, but strike not the first stroke
(in case it comes to such an exigency) lest you kindle such a fire in England,
that will never be quenched, but rather manifest with humble boldness, your
extreme unwillingnesse unto such a straight, that so the peace of God, and the
God of peace may dvvell amongst us.

FINIS.
