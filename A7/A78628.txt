His Majesty's ANSWER, BY WAY OF DECLARATION To a Printed Paper, entitled, A
Declaration of both Houses of Parliament, in Answer to His Majesty's last
Message concerning the Militia.
WE very well understand how much it is below the high and Royal dignity
(wherein God has placed Us) to take notice, much more to trouble Our Self with
answering those many scandalous seditious Pamphlets and Printed Papers, which
are scattered with such great License thorowout the Kingdom (notwithstanding
Our earnest desire, so often in vain pressed for a Reformation) though We find
it evident, That the minds of many of Our weak Subjects have been, and still
are poisoned by those means, and that so general a Terror has possessed the
minds and hearts of all men, that whiles the Presses swarm (and every day
produces new Tracts against the established Government of the Church and
State) most men want the Courage or the Conscience to write, or the opportunity
and encouragement to publish such composed sober Animadversions, as might
either preserve the minds of our good Subjects from such Infection, or restore
and recover them when they are so infected: But We are contented to let Our
Self fall to any Office that may undeceive Our People, and to take more pains
this way by Our own Pen, then ever King has done, when We find any thing that
seems to carry the reputation and authority of either, or both Houses of
Parliament, and will not have the same refuted or disputed by common and vulgar
Pens, till We are thoroughly informed, whether those Acts have in truth that
Countenance and Warrant they pretend. Which regard of Ours We doubt not but in
time will recover that due reverence (the absence whereof We have too much
reason to complain) to Our Person and Our Messages, which in all ages has been
paid (and no doubt is due) to the Crown of England.

We have therefore taken notice of a Printed Paper, entitled, A Declaration of
both Houses of Parliament, in Answer to Our last Message concerning the
Militia, published by command; The which We are unwilling to believe (both for
the Matter of it, the Expressions in it, and the Manner of publishing it) can
result from the consent of both Houses; Neither do We know by what lawful
Command such uncomely, irreverent mention of Us can be published to the World.
And though Declarations of this kind have of late (with too much boldness)
broken in upon Us and the whole Kingdom, when one, or both Houses have thought
fit to communicate their Counsels and Resolutions to the People, yet We are
unwilling to believe, that such a Declaration as this, should be published in
Answer to Our Message, without vouchsafing at least to send it to Us as their
Answer; Their Business for which they are met by Our Writ and Authority,
being to Counsel Us for the good of Our People, not to write against Us to Our
People, and no consent of Ours for their long continuing together, inabling
them to do any thing, but what they were first summoned by Our Writ to do. At
least, We will believe, though misunderstanding and Jealousy (the Justice of
God will overtake the Fomenters of that Jealousy, and the Promoters and
Contrivers of that misunderstanding) might produce (to say no worse) those very
untoward Expressions; that if those Houses had contrived that Declaration, as
an Answer to Our Message, they would have vouchsafed some Answer to the
Question proposed in Ours, which We professed, did and must evidently prevail
over Our understanding; and in their wisdom and gravity they would have been
sure to have stated the Matters of Fact, as (at least to ordinary
understandings) might be unquestionable; Neither of which is done by that
Declaration.

We desire to know why We were by that Act absolutely excluded from any Power
or Authority in the execution of the Militia, and We must appeal to all the
world, whether such an attempt be not a greater, and juster ground for Fear and
Jealousy in Us, then any one that is avowed for those distructive Fears and
Iealousies, which are so publicly owned, almost to the ruin of the Kingdom.
But We have been told that We must not be jealous of Our great Council of both
Houses of Parliament. We are not, no more then they are of Us their King, and
hitherto they have not avowed any jealousy of, or disaffection to Our Person;
imputed all to Our evil Councillors, to a Malignant party that are not of
their minds: So We do (and We do it from Our soul) profess no Jealousy of
Our Parliament, but of some turbulent, seditious, and ambitious Natures, which
(being not so clearly discerned) may have an influence even upon the Actions of
both Houses; And if this Declaration has passed by such consent, (which We are
not willing to believe) it is not impossible b^t that the apprehension of such
Tumults, which have driven Us from Our City of London for the safety of Our
Person, may make such an impression in other men, (not able to remove from the
danger) to make them consent, or not to own a dissent in matters not agreeable
to their conscience or understanding.

We mentioned in that Our Answer Our dislike of the putting of their names out
of the Bill whom before they recommended to Us in their pretended Ordinance,
and the leaving out by special Provision the present Lord Major of London, to
all which the Declaration affords no Answer, and therefore We cannot suppose it
was intended for an Answer to that Our Message, which whosoever looks upon,
will find to be in no degree answered by that Declaration.

But it informs all Our Subjects, after the mention, with what humility the
Ordinance was prepared and presented to Us, (a matter very evident in the
Petitions and Messages concerning it) and Our refusal to give Our consent,
notwithstanding the several reasons offered of the necessity thereof, for the
securing of Our Person, and the Peace and Safety of Our people, (whether any
such Reasons were given, the weight of them, and whether they were not clearly
and heartily answered by Us, the world will easily judge) that they were at
last necessitated to make an Ordinance by Authority of both Houses, to settle
the Militia, warranted thereunto by the Fundamental Laws of the Land: But if
that Declaration had indeed intended to have answered Us, it would have told
Our good Subjects what those Fundamental Laws of the Land are, and where to be
found; And would at last have mentioned one Ordinance from the first beginning
of Parliaments to this present Parliament, which endeavored to impose any
thing upon the Subject without the Kings consent; for of such, all the inquiry
We can make could never produce Us one instance. And if there be such a secret
of the Law, which has lain hid from the beginning of the world to this time,
and now is discovered to take away the just Legal Power of the King, We wish
there be not some other secret (to be discovered when they please) for the
ruin and destruction of the Liberty of the Subject: For no doubt, if the Votes
of does Houses have any such Authority to make a new Law, it has the same
Authority to repeal the old, and then what will become of the long established
Rights and Liberties of the King and Subject, and particularly of Magna Charta,
will be easily discerned by the most ordinary understandings.

It is true, We did (out of the tenderness of the Constitution of the Kingdom,
and care of the Law, which We are bound to defend, and being most assured of
the unjustifiablenesse of the pretended Ordinance) invite and desire both Our
Houses of Parliament to settle whatsoever should be fit of that nature, by Act
of Parliament; But were We therefore obliged to pass whatsoever should be
brought to Us of that kind? We did say in Our Answer to the Petition of both
Houses, presented to Us at York the 26. of March last (and We have said the
same in other Messages before) that We always thought it necessary the
business of the Militia should be settled, and that We never denied the thing,
only denied the way, and We say the same still, since the many Disputes, and
Votes upon Lords Lieutenants, and their Commissions (which were begun by Us, or
Our Father) had so discountenanced that Authority, which for many years
together was happily looked upon with Reverence and Obedience by the People; We
did, and do think it very necessary, that some wholesome Law be provided for
that business; but We declared in Our Answer to the pretended Ordinance, We
expected that that necessary Power should be first Invested in Us, before We
consented to transfer it to other men: Neither could it ever be imagined,
that we would consent that a greater Power should be in the hands of a Subject,
then We were thought worthy to be trusted with Our Self; And if it shall not be
thought fit to make a new Act, or Declaration in this point, We doubt not but
We shall be able to grant such Commissions, which shall very Legally Enable
those We trust to do all Offices for the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom, if any
Disturbance shall happen.

But that Declaration says, We were pleased to offer them a Bill ready drawn,
and that they (to express their earnest zeal to correspond with Our desire)
did pass that Bill; yet all that Expression of Affection and Loyalty, all
that earnest desire of theirs to comply with Us, produced no better effect then
an absolute denial, even of what by Our former Messages (as that Declaration
conceives) We had promised; and so proceeds (under the pretense of mentioning
evil and wicked Counsels) to censure and reproach Us in a Dialect, that We are
confident Our good Subjects will read with much indignation on Our behalf: But
sure if that Declaration had passed the Examination of both Houses of
Parliament, they would never have affirmed that the Bill We refused to pass,
was the same We sent to them, or have thought that Our Message wherein the
difference and contrariety between the two Bills is so particularly set down,
would be answered with the bare averring them to be one and the same Bill; No
more would they have declared (when Our Exceptions to the Ordinance, and the
Bill are so notoriously known to all Our People) that care being taken to give
satisfaction in all the particulars We had excepted against in the Ordinance,
We had found new exceptions to the Bill; And yet this very Declaration
confesses, that Our Exception to the Ordinance was, that in the disposing and
execution thereof We were excluded. And was not this an express reason in Our
Answer for Our refusal of the Bill which this Declaration will needs confute?
But the Power was no other then to suppress Rebellion, Insurrection, and
foreign Invasion, and the Persons trusted no other then such as were nominated
by the great Council of the Kingdom, and assented to by Us; and that
Declaration asks if that be too great a Power to trust these persons with?
Indeed whiles so great Liberty is used in Voting and Declaring men to be
enemies to the Commonwealth (an English phrase We scarcely understand) and in
censuring Men for their service and attendance upon Our person, and in Our
lawful Commands, great heed must be taken into what hands We commit such a
Power to suppress Insurrection and Rebellion. And if Insurrection and
Rebellion have found other definitions then what the Law has given them, We
must be sure that no lawful Power shall justify those definitions; And if
there be Learning found out to make Sir John Hothams taking Arms against Us,
and keeping Our Town and Fort from Us, no Treason or Rebellion, We know not
whether a new Discovery may not find it Rebellion in Us, to defend Our self
from such Arms, and to endeavor to recover what is so taken from Us: And
therefore it concerns Us (till the known Law of the Land be allowed to be Judge
between Us) to take heed into what hands We commit such Power: Besides, can it
be thought, that because We are willing to trust certain persons, that We are
obliged to trust them in whatsoever they are willing to be trusted? We say, no
private hands are fit for such a Trust, neither have We departed from any thing
(in the least degree) We offered or promised before, though We might with as
much reason have withdrawn Our Trust from some persons We before had accepted,
as they did from others whom they recommended. For the Power which We are
charged to have committed to particular persons, for the space of fifteen years
by Our Commissions of Lieutenancie, it is notoriously known, that it was not a
Power created by Us, but continued very many years, and in the most happy times
this Kingdom has enjoyed (even those of Our renowned Predecessors Queen
Elizabeth, and Our Father of happy memory) and what ever Authority was granted
by those Commissions which were kept in the old forms, the same was
determinable at Our pleasure, and We know not that they produced any of those
Calamities which might give Our good Subjects cause to be so weary of them, as
to run the hazard of so much mischief, as that Bill We refused might possibly
have produced.

For the Presidents of former ages in the Commissions of Array, We doubt not
but when any such have issued out, that the Kings consent was always obtained,
and the Commissions determinable at His pleasure, and then what the extent of
power was, will be nothing applicable to this Case of the Ordinance.

But whether that Declaration has refuted Our Reasons for Our refusal to
pass the Bill or no, it has resolved and required all Persons in authority
thereby to put the Ordinance in present execution, and all others to obey it
according to the fundamental Laws of the Land; But We whom God has trusted
to maintain and defend those fundamental Laws (which We hope He will bless
to secure Us) do declare that there is no legal power in either or both
Houses, upon any pretense whatsoever, without Our consent, to command any part
of the Militia of this Kingdom, nor has the like ever been commanded by either
or both Houses since the first foundation of the Laws of this Land; and that
the execution of, or the obedience to that pretended Ordinance, is against the
fundamental Laws of the Land, against the liberty of the Subject, and the
right of Parliaments, and a high crime in any that shall henceforth execute the
same. And We do therefore charge and command all Our loving Subjects, of what
degree or quality soever, upon their Allegiance, and as they tender the peace
of this Kingdom, from henceforth not to Muster, Leavy or Array, or summon, or
warn any of Our Trained Bands, to Rise, Muster or March by virtue or under
Color of that pretended Ordinance: And to this declaration and command of
Ours, We expect and require a full submission and obedience from all Our loving
Subjects upon their Allegiance, as they will answer the contrary at their
perils, and as they tender the upholding of the true Protestant profession, the
safety of Our Person, and Our Royal Posterity, the Peace and Being of this
Kingdom.
